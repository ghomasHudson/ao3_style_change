When Cas roars his release, Dean feels the warmth seep into him. He tries to push back to help Cas through the throbbing waves of orgasm, but he is held firm. He stays quiet, lets Cas pant through his exertions. All too soon, he pulls out, lets go of Dean’s body, and steps away. The shock of losing all connection to Cas makes him shiver.
Castiel orders the closest guard to fetch the physician and prepare the man for transportation. He gives the guard’s partner a laundry list of tasks that must be done. When they both remain staring at them, he snaps his fingers at them. “Now, gentlemen.”
Dean squints at him. “Has anyone ever told you you’re like an eighty year old man in a super-hot package?”
“Fuck, I hope not,” Dean agrees. Cas chuckles at his answer. Dean’s earlier shyness has long since dissipated. This is the Dean that challenges him, demands his best.
“He will never cast me aside,” he sneers emphatically. “I’ve been riding his cock for years, and as soon as this ridiculous infatuation is out of his system, that’s where I’ll be again.”
Cas goes back into the bathroom and wets a face cloth to clean away some of the blood, but Dean stops him. “Cas, she did this to protect her kid. I know it feels heartless to leave her like this, but if we clean her up then her story isn’t going to work.”
On the next Christmas Eve, they show up together with shiny new rings on their left hands and dark tans that make them stand out. They tell Patty all about their extended trip to Thailand and how beautiful the simple beach ceremony was, which makes her tear up.
These pictures are unfamiliar, but they really could be of him. Every feature is an exact mirror of his own. The man staring back at him is smiling with such joy that he finds himself burning with envy, even knowing that he’s dead. He thumbs through the pictures, one after the other of his doppelganger and Dean as they are smiling and laughing. In one, their lips are touching, but the kiss isn’t quite happening because they can’t stop smiling.
Dean uses his melodic voice to coerce him. “C’mon, sweetheart. I’m pretty sure I hear water close by. We’re both filthy, and not in a good way. After we clean up, we can go burrow deep in our little den and sleep the morning away.”
Having Dean unguarded like this is an embarrassment of riches to Castiel. Dean moves with wild abandon, chasing only pleasure, feeling everything he never allows. When Dean comes, Cas’s thoughts turn blasphemous. There is not a more beautiful sight under heaven or earth. He basks in the visibly sated desire of his beloved. Satisfaction settles in him now that Dean has been taken care of.
At first, Dean had argued with him over every new gift. He didn’t want the prince to think that he was interested in him because of his title and what it could provide for him. Dean knew that titles came with responsibilities and money came with strings attached. For a man like Castiel, expensive things were easy.
There’s nothing inherently masculine or not masculine about being gay or bisexual. It simply is. He’s just as manly, just as virile, and he’s a whole lot more satisfied. Cas would be worth any type or amount of humiliation they might think to heap on him, but he somehow doubts that the homosexual relationship bothers them all that much. Cas is very openly gay, and apparently that hasn’t hindered him in the slightest. It's simply the easiest thing to use to humiliate him. The Pakhan is using his sleights to get under his skin, to make him break. He’s underestimating Dean based on how young men typically react. He’s in for a shock.
His phone rings again and again. Always Cas. Dean’s head is throbbing. Whatever Michael dosed him with makes for a nasty hangover. He hopes that Cas finds him soon. If Michael gets him out of this building, he might never be found.
The additional light steals some of Dean’s confidence, but then Cas’s fingers slip back inside him like they’re meant to be there. After a few smooth strokes, Dean is ready for more. “I’m good, Cas. I want to feel you stretch me wide.”
Cas leans over the bed and sweeps an emotion-filled kiss across his lips. Tipping their heads together, he confides, “I was terrified.”
The universe may be cruel, but surely he wouldn’t get to start a life with the perfect man, only to have it yanked away from him a few short months later. He has to find a way back to Dean. He’ll be damned if he gives up without a fight.
“How could I refuse to let him learn from the head of the organization?” Cas smiles tightly, with teeth in his tone.
Dean does as he commands, watches the faint blue glow under Cas’s skin turn up until every shadow is erased.
They both turn immediately honing in on the voice. It’s an older guy, clearly trying to relive his misspent youth. “Are you going to inhale your husband or bring him over to meet everyone?”
Dean is almost done with his shower when he notices Cas watching him. His hands drift over his chest and stomach, trying to catch his interest. Cas licks his lips, his eyes tracking every movement.
Cas leans up to capture his lips in a heated kiss. “I assure you, that was not my reaction. I was so relieved, Dean.”
That finally gets a reaction other than concern. The beast yells something in a language Castiel has never heard before and darts to grab it out of the fire. He jerks his hand back when the flames leap and lick at his skin. Shaking out his burned hand, his captor runs toward the back of the cave which Castiel has not yet explored. Suddenly, it dawns on him that this is his opportunity for escape.
He turns the phone to face him and Cas glances away from his no doubt riveting words. “It’s a fisher cat. Why?”
Dean grins into the feathery edges of his hair touching the nape of his neck. Dean loves the way they tickle against his eyelashes,  especially now that they are covered in the potent scent of Castiel’s sweat. He’s never liked the scent of anyone else’s sweat; it’s too cloying and stale. Cas’s, though, is different. It is raw and elemental. It’s just another component of his true mate.
His upper body is easy for Cas to work on without distraction. He can keep talking and maintain eye contact, feeling connected to Dean in a nurturing way. Working down his guard’s hips, legs, and feet; only to work back up his inner legs, is so much harder to do without his thoughts turning lascivious. Instead of tapping his hip bones, Cas wants to grip them tight, pulling Dean’s groin to his own. Once or twice, it has taken entirely too much restraint to keep himself from burrowing his face into that enticing bulge.
“Everything, Cas? Will you let me suck your cock? Can I bury my tongue between your ass cheeks until I have you writhing and begging? Will you let me fuck you, baby?”
“I’ll bet you can guess,” Cas challenges. Dean loves this playful side of Castiel. He’s only seen it when they are alone, which makes it all the sweeter.
Dean is so close, and it’s like being next to a radiator. The heat of him is warming the surface of his own skin and soaking in. All it would take is the slightest of movements, and he could feel that heat under his fingers. He won’t though. He will do as Dean asks, but he can’t help but comment. “You’re putting off so much heat.”
Dean can’t wait any longer for Cas to wake up. He burrows under the heavy weight of the blankets. The trapped heat swallows him and he sighs. He can find Cas without his eyes, chases the sultry warmth to its source. Feathery ink tickles his nose as he tucks himself behind his back. When Cas stirs, he smiles into his neck.
Dean doesn’t have any inhibitions left. He is a seething mass of raw nerves. He immediately thrusts up into the tightness of Cas’s hand. It doesn’t take long to fall into a devastating rhythm. On every down stroke, he can feel the thick length of Cas’s cock prodding and sliding against his ass. That, more than anything else, is what has him trembling again. He pictures Cas’s earlier fantasy, and he wants it. He wants Cas to fuck him. He wants to be mounted, pounded, and owned. Holy shit.
Cas snarls at the smaller man and then turns his back on him to test his words. As soon as his fingers touch Dean, the man gasps from the rush of shimmering blue grace that floods his body. His muscles practically seize as they repair themselves so rapidly. Dean moans in relief, a visceral sound that affects Castiel in ways that surprise him. A shiver runs down his spine, and his chest aches both in satisfaction and something not so easy to identify.
Seeing Dean light up with childhood nostalgia makes Cas’s heart flip in fascination. His memories don’t make him grin. They don’t make him feel light and carefree. In fact, every nightmare he’s ever had spawned from his actual life. He’s never been afraid of the bogeyman. His neighbors were typically much scarier.
Cas hums his pleasure at the rich timbre of his voice. “Have I told you how sexy you are when you are are pushing all of my boss’s buttons?”
When Dean’s plate arrives, Jimmy is jealous. His warm apple pie is melting the scoop of vanilla ice cream so that it is pooling in each of the indentations in the latticework. It’s dribbling down the sides like a cool, sweet, waterfall.
“Oh, Castiel,” she huffs in annoyance. “Your piece was spectacular, but just like you, it wouldn’t be appreciated by just anyone. You aren’t trying to reach the average patron. You’re more exotic than that.”
They are both distressed enough to make an accident with chemicals seem completely believable. Dragging Dean to his feet, he takes him into the kitchen. He turns water on full blast and wets a towel, placing it over Dean’s eye. Leaning in to speak quietly, he asks what’s wrong.
He’s still nervous, but Cas doesn’t seem the least bit concerned, too busy fanning the flames by touching him everywhere. He had no idea the side of his neck was so sensitive, but Cas is teaching him wonderful things about himself.
The prince notices from surreptitious side glances that Dean looks like he’s been pulled through a keyhole backwards. Good. He hopes it hurts.
“Yes, Cas. Yes, you do. Whatever you want, you deserve to have it. If it’s me that you want, then I consider myself incredibly lucky.” Dean dips his head to take tenderness from his lips. They trade soft, silent kisses, starting the inexorable climb to lust when Cas suddenly breaks away and ducks his head.
His urge to explore just how much of Cas’s sensory input he can feel becomes emergent. It’s obvious that Cas is following his thoughts, because he licks his lips and nods, going up on his knees to peel off his jacket. Dean stands to take off his fitted coat, kicks off his shoes, and drops his pants while he’s there.
He has to fight his way through the increasing crowd of admirers, but he finally makes it to Cas’s side. Thankfully, Cas seems relieved to see him.
Cas sits back on his stool, letting his hand drop from Dean’s arm. He knows where this is heading, and he really doesn’t want to lose Dean now that they’ve found each other again. Maybe he won’t. Maybe Dean isn’t going to be uncomfortable with his sexual orientation. He waits for the inevitable questions.
“Why? Why would you kidnap me and ruin the only thing in my life that I cared about?” Castiel is aware that he is shrieking and wailing, pulling at his hair, but it seems an appropriate response to such a travesty.
His hand refuses to relinquish his beloved instrument, even though he might have a chance to escape if he wasn’t restricted by its weight and awkward shape. Castiel is also quickly running out of land to back into. He’s cornered, and the monstrous figure in front of him obviously knows it.
Marius looks up at him and leans in to tell his gossip. “Your master is...adventurous. Sex, for him, is frequent, varied, and often includes many others.”
Cas’s hands are itching to have access to more of Dean’s skin. He’s lucid enough to realize that here is definitely not the place to give in to such urges, and he communicates his desire to Dean through flashes of images burning behind his retinas.
“I knew you had some ink hiding under there, but I had no idea you were keeping an entire gallery hidden away.”
Dean sits facing him and Cas waits patiently for him to explain. “Okay, do you remember that morning in your room when you realized that you didn’t know if you were actually Irish?”
This new information is posing more questions than offering answers. He’ll have to go to the castle and look for himself with a few men. One thing is certain. Whoever this personal guard is, Sam is going to have to separate him from the prince so they can find out what has happened to his brother.
“Now I see why they call you fairies,” Dean goads the Fae who is trying to get him back in his pen. He is weaving on his feet, dizzy, and seeing spots, but he won’t relent. “You hit like little girls.” He doesn’t see or feel the hit, just rolls with its force and bangs against the wall of a tree. He must be worse off than he thought.
When Cas pushes down on his abdomen and perineum, essentially massaging his prostate from the outside, Dean cries out and rocks back into him. That’s all it takes to snap the last threads of Cas’s control.
Dean leans over him, placing loving kisses along his cheek and jaw. “The money is great, and it will make things so much easier, but the fact that you did this to help me? That’s what is making me so happy.”
Cas leans forward to hand him his jeans and shirt that he scooped up off the floor on his way back. He plants a firm but gentle kiss on his lips. “Yeah, that was...fuck. Mind-blowing.”
The dark-haired man looks like he is enjoying Dean’s discomfort a little too much. “Good kisser, no?”
Dean wraps his arms around his shoulders and cradles his head in his palm as he takes a chaste kiss. Keeping his lips within kissing distance, Dean murmurs, “How I feel about you isn’t location-dependent, Cas. I loved you there; I love you here.”
When he’s done chuckling at the image of gay dolphin frolicking, he pacifies Cas with a kiss to his temple. He has to duck under the high arc of his wings, but the approving hum is worth the effort. Tenderness fades seamlessly into adoring looks that lead to more intentional touches.
“I know. I really am sorry. It wasn’t fair to leave you like that. But thank you for trusting me enough to let me go.”
Dean’s eyes remain flinty and unyielding, but he stays quiet. Cas supposes that remorse is a little much to expect at this point.
Dean chuckles, and it’s then that he realizes that none of the words between them for the past minute have been spoken out loud.
The vulnerable position only becomes more so when Cas climbs up behind him, fully-clothed. “So goddamned beautiful,” he praises as he separates Dean’s cheeks with his thumbs. Before Dean can brace himself, a flat, firm tongue drags across the cleft of his ass. Cas growls deep in his throat as he moves in for another lick. Dean huffs in surprise, and then pushes his hips back to meet Cas.
Clearing his throat, he glances up to catch Mikhail’s amusement. Dean’s mind supplies an entire diatribe of curses that he would love to unleash.
“I’m kissing your ass, Dean,” he teases, hoping to ease him. He huffs out a shaky laugh, so Cas continues. “It’s called rimming, dorogoy. Will you let me?”
Cas rolls over onto Dean, straddling him. “I would really love to see what we could do with all those arms.”
He received a truly malicious glare in response. He smiled into his book and kept reading. Dean flopped down in the chair next to Cas, moaned, and closed his eyes.
John is staring straight ahead, far enough to his side to allow him to watch Cas in his peripheral vision.
Even knowing that Cas is going to speak to him in English doesn’t prepare him adequately. It is surreal. For weeks, he has associated that rocky, smoky voice with the elegant lilt of French or the guttural grip of Romanian. So many thoughts are warring for his attention. He knows he is staring with a gob smacked look on his face. He finally huffs out a humorless laugh and stares at the sky.
Hester jumps in to tell the story. “You don’t have to be quiet, Mal. He doesn’t speak a word of Romanian.”
“Point taken,” he concedes graciously. He is making a valiant attempt to keep the smile from his face. He already told Alex that he did not want to court the woman, or any other noble, for that matter.  He is fourth in line for the throne, so he is hardly a catch for the politically-aspiring aristocracy across Europe. His brother never listens, so he refuses to make this newest obsession easy for him.
“Good, you’re awake, my beautiful pet,” he coos when Dean smiles. Slipping a finger into his mouth, he tugs on Dean’s jaw. “I have such plans for this mouth.”
The entire experience of being in the Fae realm has taken more out of Dean than he thought, and he tires quickly. Staggering on his feet, he finally takes a seat in one of the beautiful chairs in their living area.
When the driver stops the car, Dean exits and before he can take a breath, the grand, double-doors of the house swing open. The Rococo monstrosity is meant to intimidate, and it certainly does its job. The outside is leafed in gold wherever there is a break in the solid slabs of marble. Instead of beautiful, the result is off-putting. That isn’t what he says to the Mashkorevs, of course.

“Look. We’re here, essentially imprisoned; we’re waiting to be given permission to leave. I appreciate everything you are doing to get me out of this mess. I’m not going to do anything to jeopardize that.”
“Oh fuck, Dean. It’s gorgeous,” he sighs as he aims the rest of the pulses just above where he wants it so he can watch all of it slowly slip down and be swallowed by the greedy hole. One little trickle escapes, and Cas gathers it up with his thumb and guides it home.
The man tries to take Dean’s hand, and Cas is done playing games. He bats it away and then lifts the edge of his shirt to give the man a view of his gun. His eyes go wide and he takes a step back.
He clears his throat. He might as well take advantage of Ion’s loose tongue. “You don’t think it’s-”
“I’m not going to give away whether we’re going somewhere indoors or outdoors. Give up, Cas. Surprises are fun.”
Even as the words are spoken, he is at odds with himself about giving too much information to this man. On one hand, duh. On the other hand, though, he lives here and probably knows some kids that need Dean’s help. Hell. It isn’t the first time he’s done something incredibly stupid to help a kid in trouble. It isn’t even the first time this week, if he’s honest.
Dean wakes in the night, blinking owlishly at the bedside lamp that is still on. Cas isn’t beside him, but he feels his presence. Propping himself up on his elbows to look around, he finds Cas sitting cross-legged at the far corner of the bed. A sketchbook is in his lap, but he’s not drawing. Instead, his hands bracket the book like he’s receiving divine revelation.
They fall into their new routine, if not with ease, then with complete devotion. They are both worn around the edges from sleep deprivation and the constant newness of having a tiny human be completely reliant on them. Cas takes the middle of the night care because he can get up whenever he wants and Dean has to be downstairs to work at nine in the morning. Cas brings her to Dean for part of the day, and she stays with him for the rest.
He feels like a petulant brat, but he can’t be in the same room with Dean right now. Castiel is vacillating between wanting to throw his arms around his neck, thankful that he is still here, and wanting to wrap his hands around his neck and squeeze the life out of him. Regardless, Dean needs to be out of sight for awhile.
While Dean had been eager to teach him how to give blow jobs and how to use his fingers and mouth to loosen up his hole, he had been hesitant about taking things any farther once Cas conveyed the idea that he hadn’t ever had penetrative sex before. It took a full week of cajoling and using his newly-found skills of seduction before Dean finally gave in and fucked him.
Parting his lips, Cas locks on Dean’s. The plump beauty is tucked between Dean’s teeth as he chuckles. “Oh, you like the sound of that.”
Meg squeezes Dean’s arm to get his attention. “Hey, it happens. It’s a lot more common than you might think, too. Don’t worry about it. I’m a professional, I’ve seen it all.”
There are enormous cushions laid in a circle all around the fire, distant enough to warm, but not overheat. The cushions are large enough to seat two large people comfortably. Above them, large vines filled with blooms the size of their heads wave in the breeze.
Cas does huff out a laugh, but stops abruptly when Luke winces. “Is there anything I can do, brother?”
She yells out to the man at the counter. “You doing okay, Doug? I’m starting on line work, so I'll be busy for a bit.”
Dean kisses him sweetly on the lips. “Now that I’m sharing this part of my life with you, there’s something important I want you to see. Sex can wait.”
Dean leans in close enough to speak without the possibility of being overheard. “You owe me big, Redbull. I intend to collect as soon as we are tucked away in our tent tonight.”
“Sounds like grown up Dean is still pretty awestruck. I hope it rains tonight. Can you imagine how amazing it will sound on that metal roof?”
Cas doesn’t come in to join him. He doesn’t come in to sleep before Dean turns out the light. When Dean gets up to make coffee in the morning, Cas is still in the little alcove of the kitchen they’ve given him for painting.
Cas lays down next to him and tugs him over onto his side so they are facing each other, Cas’s head level with his chest. Looking up at Dean under those sooty lashes, Cas drags his flattened tongue firmly across the raised flesh. Dean bites back the whimper of pleasure, firmly squeezing his bottom lip between his teeth. On the next swipe, he lets it go as he moans. Fuck, that feels good.
“You stole me away from my home! Why? What do you want? What are you going to do to me?” Every question gets louder and more frantic, while Castiel hurls everything in his reach at the man who shrinks smaller and smaller in response.
“Cas, we had barely met, and yet we were desperate to get our hands on each other. The location isn’t what was important. There was something raw and primal about every time we met in those first few weeks. You swept me away with your intensity.”
Cas scowls. He needs to be more observant. He hasn’t noticed that vile man lurking about. “I spoke to Alex about him before they went back to the city. He promised me that if Alastair made another wrong move, he would get rid of him.”
Cas almost left his backpack in the room too, but Dean managed to convince him to bring it for storage purposes, to which Cas grumbled about being expected to be a pack mule. In reality, Dean knows that Cas’s sketch book is in there, and he’ll want it where they’re going.
He hears the gasps of surprise from the high court and a singular, feminine laugh filled with power.
“You are. I can feel it. I can smell it.” Dean takes his arm away and settles as far back into his chair as possible. His thoughts are filled with harsh words; betrayal and perfidious the ones that stand out as blocking most of his logic.
Dean stops his ministrations, dropping his hands to the slick pool edge. “I’ll give you a bit of advice, Casanova. Your current lover does not ever want to be reminded of all those that came before- even if the comparison is in their favor.”
Cas’s words are a little too earnest, and Dean knows that if he looks into those big blue eyes, he’s going to see sadness. The solution is simple; he refuses to look. After a minute of silence, Cas gets up from his stool abruptly and plasters himself to Dean’s back. The long, graceful fingers spread over his chest to expand their influence as much as possible. Dean closes his eyes, soaking in the comfort from him before he uses his tough guy persona to protect himself.
When Cas raises an eyebrow in surprise, Dean scoffs. “Have you seen you? Are you really surprised that I can’t take you and another cock?”
“Fuck, I missed you so much,” Cas says before pressing into his husband forcefully enough to merge their bodies together.
Cas pops the button and zipper on Dean’s jeans with one hand while he walks them toward the couch. He stops to slide his palms over Dean’s firm ass, taking his jeans along with the sweet caress. “Thank god? Still after my soul, missionary?”
Cas’s skin is charmingly flushed over his cheeks and down his neck. The color makes the hue of his eyes more pronounced, and Dean can’t get enough of them. Whenever he turns to say something to Cas, he gets caught by their beauty, a crystal pale ringed by deep royal.
The smug patience of the man is making Castiel’s blood boil. Barbarous, savage thoughts are taking over his brain. He snatches the rifle from the closest man and aims it at the captain’s temple.
Dean ducks his head, and speaks softly. “I understand. I’m embarrassed for humanity, and I want to scream at the injustice of it; but I understand.”
“Son, I would spend a little more effort on assisting me and a little less on pissing me off if I were in your shoes.”
With sudden revelation, Cas knows the piece he wants to create as the centerpiece of his portfolio. Flipping the page on his sketchbook, he begins drawing out his idea for what will be named “Loss”. It is an image of him reaching up towards a heavenly light, but large “bricks” of himself are coming loose and falling away. They start at his center and are expanding outward.
This is so much more. Dean feels ensnared in his gaze, uncertain of what will be asked, but knowing he will deliver. He’s pledged his fealty, after all. He will give Cas what he wants. What is the word Cas keeps demanding? Oh yes, enthusiastically.
Laughing bursts from Dean’s body where it is crushing him, which makes his own body rock with amusement. He can’t help but echo his laughter, which starts the most ridiculous feedback loop.
Their lips touch, but still do not press. Cas encourages by sliding them gently against each other. Dean finally takes, giving firm pressure. He keeps the kiss chaste and leans back too soon. Cas opens his eyes and whispers, “Do you want more?”
Dean has offloaded quite a few of his normal tasks onto his staff so that he can help out more at home, which is why he is walking in the door two hours ahead of schedule. He can’t wait to get his hands on that sweet little baby. Having her fall asleep on his chest is one of the most fulfilling things he’s every experienced. When he opens the door, he realizes that he’s too late. Cas and the baby are knocked out together on the couch. His heart flips to see them. Sitting down on the floor next to them, he watches them sleep peacefully.
When no one moves except to look at each other with gaping mouths, Dean draws his kukri. The men are so focused on the blade that it gives him a minute to check on Cas visually. No injuries are evident, just the red line on his throat.
Benny smiles coyly. “I don’t know, but you sure seemed to like him. I’ve never seen you so...affectionate in public.”
“A novobranets is a recruit, someone selected by leadership to groom for a specific position. Being recruited is an honor that carries a great deal of prestige, but it also puts a target on your back. The men working their way up the traditional way will resent you.”
“What in the hell is going on in here?” John yells. He takes in the scene before him like he must still be dreaming. Two grown men jumping on a bed in the middle of the night makes no sense.
“Of course. We’re still your best defense, but things can happen quickly. Even the threat that you’re not going to go down easy is sometimes enough to scare off an attacker or at least buy you time for us get there.”
Sadness falls over Cas. It slumps his shoulders and drops his head. “This is horrible. She doesn’t deserve this.”
The creature approaches, back on two legs again but he has kept the human illusion. He’s naked, but Castiel is too infuriated to even consider that fact. He runs at the beast, who smiles at his approach, until he makes impact. With fists swinging, Castiel takes every bit of his anger out on the abomination who took him from his home.
“I, uh. I was under the impression that this was something that you wanted, potentially...long term.” Dean looks away, not willing to see what Cas’s eyes are showing him. “Am I mistaken?”
He’s going to wreck Dean with this experience. Not to be vain, but Cas knows he’s masterful at sucking cock. He’s reduced men to incoherent babbling only to later receive reverent praise of his skills.  The trick is to really enjoy it. He loves it too much not to be good at it. Getting Dean’s thick cock into his mouth is going to be a joy.
“I don’t ever want you to leave, but I don’t know how your body is going to respond to being separated for so long. I don’t want you to push too hard, too quickly, and hurt yourself.”
The older woman has a wicked gleam in her eye that Cas would never have expected to come from such a kind-hearted lady.
Dean sniffs and nods, meeting his eye finally. “It made me think, though, about how much can change in an instant. If I had lost you, I would have regretted so much, Cas.”
This flirty Dean is more than he could have hoped for. Cas is still half-convinced that Dean will panic, but he puts it out of his mind. He won't let doubt in.
Their lips meet first, and there is nothing timid or gentle in the way Dean takes his mouth. Walking them the short distance to the wall, he continues his assault. Hands cupping his face, Dean speaks against his mouth.
Dean breaks the kiss to whisper to him, “Jesus, I don’t know what you’re doing to me, Cas. One good kiss and I’m desperate for you.”
Wordlessly, he gets up from his seat and moves in front of Cas’s armchair. The wide, high back is perfect for what he intends. Climbing into Cas’s lap and straddling him brings an unexpected sense of calm. He sighs in relief at the friction, wishing only for skin on skin contact.
When the enraged man takes a step forward, his jaw clenched in fury, Cas darts up the path that winds farther into the mountain. Without his torch, the way is dark and treacherous. Still, any danger is better than ending up in that lunatic’s grasp. The path narrows as it wraps tighter into the core of the rock. ‘Please, please do not let this be a dead end,’ he prays as he staggers over another loose rock.
Dean huffs out a steadying breath and then takes Cas back into his mouth. He does exactly as Cas says, and he is able to get him deeper this time. He sinks deeper with each pass until he feels a tickle and tries to keep from gagging.
When Dean withdraws and sits back, he smiles. Picking up a small morsel, he slides closer. Wrapping his arm around the back of the seat and leaning over into his personal space, Cas nudges the small bite to Dean’s mouth. He doesn’t open immediately. This is a bizarre thing for Cas to ask, but he’s been raised to have manners, and so he relents. Salty, spicy, and crunchy bacon explodes on his tongue. He hums his approval, which ignites the spectacular smile on Cas’s face.
Cas raises an eyebrow at Meg in question. “If you want to, I’d appreciate it. I’ll charge him a custom artwork fee for you. Could be worth a couple hundred bucks.”
Dean’s eyes go wide. That’s a first. Trying to get under Cas’s defenses, he teases, “So, all that talk about never getting enough of me, being hungry for me all the time; that’s worn off already?”
Breathless and floating with endorphins, Dean feels the strong pulsing of Cas’s cock. He hums his approval. He wishes that he could feel the warm splash of come filling him. It’s not possible, but he thinks it would be amazing to feel.
Dean is huddled by the door of their hotel room, trying to carry on the conversation with his dad without waking Cas. He wouldn’t have taken the call this early, but he pointedly ignored a call from him yesterday, and he knows his dad well enough to know that it won’t be tolerated a second time.
“I know,” Dean teases seductively, “You just like the idea of your sperm catching because you’re so virile and you bred me so good, pushed it so deep.”
Cas smooths his hands over Dean’s shoulders, fingertips gripping over biceps and curling around his elbows. He gently guides his arms forward, toward the back to the couch. “Hold on tight, sweetheart.”
Dean chuckles and does a visual perimeter sweep. They haven’t seen another soul on their journey, let alone any trouble, but something is setting his teeth on edge. It’s probably just the thought of being out of the castle, out in the open. He feels vulnerable.
Dean stands up, and in his haste, the stool scoots and skitters on the tile behind him. He can hear that his client is trying to speak to him, but it is all just static over the pounding of his own heart and the whoosh of blood in his ears. He opens his mouth to speak, blinks to clear his vision, but he’s still there, and almost passing from view. Dean can’t let him get away.
“Are you going to keep the clothes or what?” he snaps. Castiel squints at him, his cupid bow lips tipping down. With a blink, the clothes and the wings disappear, leaving a very naked, incredibly beautiful man standing in front of Dean.
Dean takes a long sip of his coffee, adding, “I’m not going to push. I promise you that I won’t ever do anything that you don’t give me explicit permission to do. But, if there’s ever something that you want to try, I’m here. I’m willing.”
Dean is more impressed by the grounds than all of the rest combined. The manicured gardens spread out over at least an acre of the most valuable real estate in all of Russia. The night has a bite of coming winter to it, but they are still expecting moderate temperatures for a few more days.
Disquiet clouds his mind as he realizes that Cas isn’t in their bed. He had been hoping to rouse him for more breathless kisses and heated touches. That simmering arousal that he felt when he woke is now bubbling higher, his typical reaction to thoughts of Cas.
Cas sighs. “I am not berating you.” He walks over and extends the bottle to Dean, who takes it and swallows down a healthy gulp. “I’m sorry. My frustrations aren’t your doing.”
Cas slides to the head of the bed, so he is leaning against the headboard, legs spread in invitation. Dean is scowling at him.
Cas seemed to disappear into his memories, and Dean felt he needed to buoy their conversation. “I spent several months in Normandy a couple years ago. My experience was not at all similar to yours.”
Dean snorts. “I grew up with the law, Benny. I already know anything he could tell me in a hypothetical case. Nothing can be done until after a crime is committed. They don’t have the resources to put manpower on potential stalkers, just confirmed ones.”
“Whoever planned my fake life screwed up. They didn’t even try to Photoshop pictures of me. That was a huge sign that something was wrong. And why would they make me marry a woman? Did they make me straight?”
“Dean, look at yourself. Even if you weren’t having medical problems, you haven’t been yourself in weeks. Your obsession with books is unhealthy. You’re stealing them and talking to them. You broke into my dorm room to get to them, and then I find you completely battered and screaming at a novel.”
The creature dives into the water, bringing a multitude of tentacles up to the surface, including the one gripping Castiel. He can’t help but scream as he’s taken down under the surface; the horror of what he is experiencing too insane to process in any other way.  Water pours into his mouth as he is dragged deeper and deeper.
Dean kisses his nose and takes his hand. “Doesn’t matter. I’m content, you’re done with your meeting, and we can go back to your chambers.”
Using authentic ingredients like real sugar cane and Cuban rum was important to Dean, so Cas had made the extra effort to find everything, despite the rarity of some of them in Boston. Now that he’s muddling the mint and lime together, the sharp tang is mixing with the delicious spices coming from the kitchen and Cas can see why Dean insisted. Everything smells heavenly and it’s creating the perfect atmosphere.
When they’ve been waiting on blood test results for over an hour, Sam volunteers to go find some food and hopefully someone with information. He isn’t gone more than a few minutes when the nurse comes in to check on Dean.
Dean huffs out his indignance. “So while I was falling all over myself in the cathedral, you knew what had me so flummoxed?”
They go back to thinking, and Cas can feel their eyes on him after a minute. Without looking in their direction, Cas says, “Hell, no.”
“How? Reflexology. The nerve endings in your feet map to all your major body parts. The toes are your brain, which is why that helped alleviate that nasty headache.”
How long does it take to grab something from their beach, anyway? It’s only a few hundred feet long, for fuck’s sake. Cas doesn’t know the best way to handle this situation. He doesn’t want to do anything to encourage the man, but he also doesn’t want it to continue.
“How? I’ll give you anything you want. Everything you want.” The pledge might be made in the heat of the moment, but it is no less sincere for its circumstances. He clenches Dean’s body to him, letting his hips do the work so that he can kiss down his neck and nip at his neck.
No one in this kingdom would dare raise their hands against a prince, so there aren’t any sparring partners available. Except, of course, Dean, who currently has him pinned against a wall with his forearm across Cas’s throat.
Encouraging Dean to lose all control probably isn’t the smartest idea, but Cas is caught up in it as much as his alpha. Their fucking is savage and necessary, and it has garnered more attention than they realize. The predators of the forest are watching, but they admire from afar.
The queen rolls her eyes. “Oh, for fuck’s sake. He needs your seed, Castiel. Your seed is the cure for the poison.”
In the span of a heartbeat, his identity completely changes. There’s an entirely new cultural construct in which to frame himself.
Dean sits, predator still, and waits. The bewitching grin on Cas’s face makes so many promises, and Dean is itching to cash in on them all.
“He is gone.” Bart pops the bubble, the heartless bastard, and Dean deflates, slipping to the ground.
Part of him wants to let go of the anger and take Dean apart the right way, make him scream for Cas’s cock to fill him. The rest of him, though. He can still feel the harsh bite of the cuffs, feel multiple hands grabbing and shoving at him. The worst part? The thing that sends Cas’s temper into orbit? Dean actually believed that he was capable of such vile behavior. Talk about a crushing blow to one’s ego.
Castiel pats his hand, lips trying to quirk into a smile but giving up midway. “Don’t worry about me, dear brother. We’ll be fine here while you whisk your lovely bride away to Bucharest.”
“Am I hurting you?” Dean notices the question comes without even a minute decrease in speed or intensity.
Cas shakes his head. “Our experiences are so different, Dean. I’ve never even had a savings account, and you aren’t concerned about pulling $300 thousand out of yours.” He runs his hand through his hair and gapes at Dean. “I can’t even fathom being wealthy like that.”
The first hand on his arm makes him jerk away. The second makes him flail. By the time there are too many hands to identify, he is thrashing. Why won’t they let him go? Why are they stopping him?
Their eyes meet and a million conversations happen silently. Dean knows that he and Cas will make it. They will be together in 50 years, still as much in love with each other as they are right in this moment.
“He tried to get me to believe that you were pleasuring yourself before we came home. He obviously-”
“That’s hardly kinky, Dean. I’ve had your mouth on me enough to know that I’m completely addicted. I would ask to have you suck me just about anywhere and anytime. Scratch that. I’d beg for it.”
Dean kisses him with the magical salty kiss of air blown into his lungs and then they descend. They go so much deeper than Cas can believe before finally leveling out and exiting the cave. There’s no way he ever would have made it on his own.
Dean knows the tremor in his hands is spreading, but his body is aching for contact, so he can’t keep them away. Gripping Cas’s arms firmly helps contain the fire, but desperation is sneaking up. “Please, Cas. It’s been so long.”
Cas scowls at him. “Why the ever-loving fuck would you take the subway when you have this beautiful car to drive?”
“Well, sweetheart, my friends and I just came from a brawl on the platform, and I’m sure you know how horny a fight can make someone.”
Back in their room at court, Cas continues his ritual of laying in bed with Dean, letting his beloved sleep against his chest as his hands drift through feathers. He keeps Dean enshrouded with his primary wings as often as he can. It settles his more primal instincts to care for his potential mate. Their bond is strong, but strengthens daily. Now that they have some time away from the prying eyes and ears of the court, Cas needs to talk with Dean about angelic relationships and his desire to take Dean as his mate.
Luke diverts the conversation to something positive. “Speaking of Michael, he and Alexander are leaving for Bucharest in the morning. They’ll be gone for a few days.”
Castiel rounds on Dean, loosening the reigns on his true form. His wings, all six of them, erupt from his back while his voice shakes the foundations of the building. His presence fills the great cavern as he yells, “Enough!”
Running his hand soothingly along Dean’s side, he says, “All of the difficulties you mentioned are temporary, Dean. They’re happening because the bond is not fully formed. I promise that it won’t always be this way. You don’t see me experiencing the same struggles because the bond on my side has been there since the beginning.”
Too soon, while Dean is lost in his daydreams, Castiel stands and heads toward the closest door. He hears the tell-tale screeching of brakes again. Relief wars with disappointment that he appears to be leaving. Watching him closely, Castiel stops and tilts his head, contemplating. Before the doors open, he changes his trajectory, and instead makes his way toward Dean, as if he changed his mind because of something he saw in Dean’s face.
A dangerous smirk is on his lips. “I have an idea of how we can get at Boyar. Tell me if you’re okay with this.”
“Right to the point, hmm? No foreplay at all.” There’s an edge of humor there, but Dean isn’t reckless enough to grab hold of it. Not with the results of his last impetuous action still looming ominously. Not with his life at stake.
Dean is as enthusiastic and responsive as always, making Cas’s heart race to catch up with his urgency. With a huffed out moan, Cas arches his hips up into the glorious wetness. Dean wraps his arms around Cas, pulling him tighter and closer as his lips descend on Cas’s thick cock.
“No, no, no,” he says in horror, trying to identify the cause of his abrupt return. He looks down to see the book on the floor and another pair of feet near him. When his eyes follow them up, a perky redhead with a high ponytail gives him a pinched look. “What?”
The reaction that surprises them the most is John’s. His eyes are shining with emotion as he looks them both over. With a lop-sided grin, he remarks, “When I told you to do right by him, Cas, I didn’t mean you had to propose right away.”
Unflinching arrogance glares back at him. “I have every right, Captain Winchester, but that is beside the point. If you had let me finish before devolving into this tantrum, I would have given you the reason for my decision.”
When Dean pushes that thick finger all the way in, they both moan. Cas drops his forehead to Dean’s. When he starts the sweet rhythm, in and out, it makes Cas already want to rock with it in the circle of his arms. “Push out all around the edge, try to stretch me.”
Cas stares, connecting with Dean on an elemental level as he takes control, takes Dean’s breath, takes his life into his hand. Dean sinks into the feeling of breathlessness, the full flush of blood in his face, the dizziness a lack of oxygen provides. He’s underwater but the weight centered just under his jaw is pulling him down instead of buoying him up.
Dean’s eyes roam over each section of the long canvas that he has completed so far. “Kevin is going to flip over this.”
The young man has already made an impact on their morale as well as their bottom line, and he’s barely had time to get his feet under him. Cas couldn’t be prouder. Dean’s strategic competence is the sexiest thing he’s seen in a long time. Well, until now.
‘What the ever-loving hell, Winchester,’ he chastises himself. He’s never looked at another man with any kind of interest other than friend or enemy. Suddenly, he can’t keep his eyes to himself?
Cas nods and the picture becomes clear. His collar isn’t a symbol of Cas wanting to own him, it’s a symbol of his care and protection. He quietly responds, “I’m honored to wear it...sir.”
Dean scoffs. “You don’t have to say that for my benefit, Cas. I know you don’t want to be involved in any of this.”
“Cas, please.” Dean is desperate to make his reality true. If he believes it strongly enough, he can make it true. Dean is shaking his head, forcing the other man’s words to disappear with his denial.
“So, my lovely pet. Which shade shall we go for? Vermilion, Red lake, Rose Madder, Crimson, Magenta?”
Cas is focused on capturing images for his client, just as he’s been all afternoon, but Dean enjoys this quiet time with him. They talk in between shots, and Dean has brought his sketchbook out here with them.
The piercing scrape of metal signals their first stop. Dean holds his breath as the station comes into view, frame by frame in the windows. By sheer will, he tries to force the platform to be empty. Instead, he encounters a melee of bodies, thrashing together in a brutal assault. Shit. There are at least eight of them that he can separate into individual bodies. There might be more underneath.
When he feels Cas nuzzle the side of his head while their lungs are still heaving and their hearts are still pounding, he can’t contain his emotions any longer. A horrifying sob jerks out of him. Worse, more follow. Cas grips him tightly, tucking him into his chest as he slips out and onto his side. He coos and shushes Dean through the body wracking cries.
“So fucking good,” he whimpers. “Cas, I-” His words are lost to a waterfall of sweet agony, his cock spurting out pearly come in high arcs. It falls all over his chest, while his ass squeezes around the thickness of Cas.
The tension in the room is suddenly suffocating. Nervous, twitchy movements flicker from face to face, wondering how John will handle her comment. He’s not known for his tolerance. Before he has a chance to respond, though, Dean chuckles. “You’re not wrong. Continue.”
He performs a cursory search of the room, digging through the desk and the closet looking for clues. There are papers on the desk, but they are all written in a language he doesn’t know. He assumes it is Turkish.
He hasn’t been able to calm himself enough to relax. Something is going on with these handsy, obnoxious Fae, and it’s maddening. He knows how incredible Cas is, but tonight everyone else seems to have figured it out. They flirt shamelessly with the angel, offering all kinds of sexual pleasure with Dean standing right next to him. Cas flushes and kindly rejects them, one by one, but Dean has had enough.
Dean nods, “They are absolutely breathtaking, man. The feathers are indescribable; like digging your fingers into the softest, thickest fur.”
Cas finally looks back to Dean’s satiated face. He is seconds from sleep, his long lashes dipping lower with each blink. Pride lights up his chest. He is finding that caring for this man brings him contentment unlike anything he’s ever experienced.
When Bart, Alexei, and Grigory enter the cell with somber expressions, he knows that the ache in his heart is about to be given a name. He doesn’t want to believe it. He doesn’t want to know the truth. He wants to live in this in-between place when nothing is certain and there is still hope.
He climbs the ropes with burning muscles and chafed palms, straining to ascend the peak before the storm clouds on the horizon reach him. Being this high up in the midst of a storm is a fantastically bad idea. Racing the wind, he pulls himself to the top just as the rain starts to fall.
When Cas tries to speak, Dean kisses him, filthy and deep, adjusting his head to get a better angle. After the heated kiss goes on for long, searching minutes; Dean lets up the pressure to murmur against his lips. “I know it doesn’t mean anything, but I have a couple of decades of bigoted beliefs to overcome here. It is going to take some time.”
Dean scowls but he’s listening now. “I’ll tell Alexei what I need him to do, and then we can go back to our room.”
Lost in his thoughts, he doesn’t notice Cole leave and come back into the room with an envelope. “Hey, this came for you a few weeks ago, but you haven’t really been around much.”
Walking through a packed restaurant with a hard-on is tricky. There are so many people loitering in the lobby and bar area, that Dean has to brush against a few random pant legs. That unwanted contact thankfully quiets the desire bubbling in his blood enough to get him down to their room without incident. The second the door shuts and locks behind him, Dean turns and is slammed into the wall before he can process what’s happening.
The shock makes the entire scene surreal, but his eyes fill with matching tears. He’s nodding and pulling Cas up to his feet to wrap him in his arms. “Yes, Cas. One hundred percent, yes.”
Dean grins, bashfulness making him quiet while he confesses, “I think I’d like to stay here for a while, honestly. I know we aren’t actually married, but could we take a honeymoon and just settle in with each other without interruptions?”
“Actually, that’s the definition of accidents, dad.” Dean isn’t sure why he’s feeling so combative today, why he’s acting like a petulant kid. This whole thing just rubs him the wrong way. Before his dad can work up the head of steam to respond, Dean puts his hands up and apologizes. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be antagonistic. I’m just nervous as hell and I expected this to be a heart to heart with my dad, not the formation of a task force.”
Dean leans down and nuzzles into his neck to cause him to squirm away from the ticklish touch. “It’s late. Let’s get some sleep and we can talk about it in the morning?”
Just as he turns away toward the setting sun, he hears his name being called from several yards away. He scours the crowd now, trying to find his husband. Cas is moving toward him as rapidly as he can over the stone steps in flip flops. Dean chuckles at the picture his gorgeous omega makes. He’s dressed to fit in with this under 30, hip crowd. Wearing only frayed jeans and a white t-shirt, Cas looks like summer and fun. He licks his lips and tumbles over the edge of the girder, grabbing on with his hands at the last second, and dropping noiselessly to the ground.
Cas tugs him closer and cradles him in a gentle hug. In his ear he confesses, “Even if I never saw you again, you are the love of my life, Dean. Your name is the only one that belongs there.”
Dean sucks in a deep breath, and nods his agreement as Cas continues working. “Okay, but hurry up. You don’t have to be a perfectionist about it.”
“You’ll have forgotten all about me by then,” Dean says sadly, cupping his jaw and guiding him down.
Dean hates seeing the tears, but his watery voice is worse. “I know. They would have, but you saved me. Again.”
The more he rationalizes his feelings, the hotter he stokes the fire of his anger. He shakes his head in disbelief and then, with the impulse to get himself out of this insane situation, reins the horse in hard away from the castle and kicks his flanks.
His heart races as he walks. Where is Cas? Why aren’t they here together? What is going on? Dean practically growls when he thinks of their companions.
Castiel blows a frustrated puff of air and stares into the queen’s eyes. There is mischief there that annoys him. She is practically admitting that she toyed with Dean and got him to compromise himself.
“Dean,” Cas chastises, “My love for you isn’t based on the facts that you know. I fell in love with your compassion, your diligence, and your love of life. Every time we met in the past, I found an overabundance of new things to love about you.”
Now, though. Now, the blanket is the only barrier keeping his erection hidden while he bandages Dean’s hand. He struggles to keep his breathing even and his eyes on his task. Temptation to touch, to lean closer, to soak up Dean’s heat and his smell are making Cas dizzy. His toes are curling in an effort to keep him from giving himself away.
Dean is a British soldier who gets caught spying on his allies. Cas is a hedonistic prince who takes an immediate interest in Dean. He isn't the only one. Alastair is obsessed with Dean, but for different reasons. Dean is completely heterosexual, except that he's not, especially where our prince is concerned. There is UST for days until Cas fucks someone else, and then they stay away from each other until Alastair rears his ugly head. They fight against a primal chemistry between them until Dean finally gives in. Cas is mentoring him sexually, which brings us to the last chapter, where Sam snuck in to try to rescue Dean. It didn't go as he had planned.
Cas wraps his arms around him and pulls his body in tight. Their lips clash, teeth bruising and nipping, while Cas presses his fingers along his back. Moans erupt as Cas’s painstakingly-detailed work devolves into muddy smears. In just moments, Cas has him pinned to the wide, blue chaise lounge against the wall. The front of the artist’s clothes are saturated in color, as is half of his face. Dean’s natural skin color is showing through in places, as is that mischievous light that Cas loves so much.
Cas pistons his hips in small thrusts, letting himself slide in incrementally as Dean starts to open up to him. If they hadn’t fucked hard last night, there’s no way this would have worked. Dean’s muscle memory of his cock is just recent enough to let him relax around the thick intrusion.
“Well, in any other situation, I don’t need someone treating me like a china doll, so why would I need that after one particular type of sex act? I mean, we’ve had some seriously exhausting, savage sex and neither of us brought up aftercare. We just took care of each other.”
“Okay, I think that’s a good idea, actually.” Cas is proud of Dean for being proactive about this, since forward thinking tends to run counter to his MO. Well, they should have talked before they had sex of any kind, but their first time together wasn’t exactly conventional.
“Here, let me help.” Bart whispers in his ear, the words almost lost to the annoying hum in his skull. One of his free arms comes up around Cas’s neck and starts to tighten. At first, it just tips his head up and makes his eye sockets join in the ‘woosh, woosh’ throb of his heart. He almost welcomes the imminent, blissful black of sleep as an escape from the pain. It would definitely be easier than remembering this vile hour, than being present for the ultimate insult to his body and his spirit.
Their bed backs up against a freestanding wall in the center of the room. To the left, where Cas is heading, most of the master bath is located. It is the strangest, yet beautiful arrangement Dean has ever seen. A free standing glass shower enclosure is closest to them, with a sink made from a rocky pillar next to it. The true piece of art, though, is the tub sitting farther back under a glowing light. The shining porcelain is in a tall bowl shape. It is so deep that it must take forever to fill up.
Dean’s eyes widen in shock and confusion. He doesn’t ask. He instinctively knows better. Instead, he freezes.
Dean barely has the car door unlocked when Cas is on him. He slides both hands up underneath his shirt to wander over his chest; he mouths at the junction of his neck and shoulder like he wants to take a bite. Dean’s eyes snap closed to focus on the frenzied attack. “F-fuck, Cas,” he gasps.
That’s all it takes. Dean’s shaking gives way to thrumming as his cock kicks out thick, milky pulses. He sways forward and Cas pulls him down to his chest to let him get his breathing under control and bask along with him.
There are moments in life that become lasting memories, and you wonder: why that particular day? Why that moment?  What was so special about it that my mind chose to never let it go? Some moments, though, you know as they’re happening that they will be precious; put on the highest shelf and taken down to admire when you need a little warmth and happiness. This windows-down, sunshine drive with Cas; this ridiculous game played to the soundtrack of classic rock, car horns, and easy laughter will forever be etched on his heart and in his mind.
I actually had to set it aside to get another little idea out of my head, and once I posted that one, this chapter wouldn't let me make any headway. Pouty little bastard.
Dean cries out in tortured pleasure, loud and raw in the heartbeats just before orgasm. When the first pulse erupts from him, he lets out a veritable roar of relief.
Cas rolls his eyes, but he is secretly loving this possessive display. It feels good to be desired, but it feels even better to inspire such primal, proprietary behavior. He rubs it in slowly, maintaining eye contact even when he licks his fingers clean. Dean devours the sight.
When he meets Dean’s eye, his gaze is steady; sad but not pitying. “I immediately went into the system because she didn’t have family, either. I was at an orphanage for most of my childhood, and they were severely understaffed. Babies were not held unless they cried, and apparently, I hardly ever cried.”
Cas hums that gorgeous sound that is an almost purr. Dean shivers and sighs. Cas smirks at his beautiful guard. Challenge accepted.
The envoy reappears and timidly announces that the queen has graciously given him a limited selection of his powers back.
Dean’s trying not to feel like he’s less than what he was, that he is just as manly as he’s ever been, even if he can’t wait to feel Cas invade his body again. He’s trying to feel like the independent young man he’s been for years, even though he hasn’t quite reached thirty years.
Dean shrugs and starts packing up. “It’s worth a look. I don’t like the idea of staying in one place too long anyway, especially since we invaded the mother ship earlier. The farm is a little too close for comfort.”
When he gets to his landing, though, exhaustion consumes him, and all he wants to do is black out and forget for a few hours. Upon opening the door, the first person he sees is Gabriel, sitting on the couch with a beer in his hand and a smarmy grin on his face.
Dean is never shy about sex, so it shouldn’t surprise Cas when he pulls him forward by the hips and takes the head of his cock into the heat of his mouth. Intense suction forces a curse from his lips as Dean draws on him.
Cas shakily grabs the arm of the closest chair and sits heavily as his legs go wobbly from picturing what John tells him.
Of course not, he scoffs at himself. Dean never kills unless it is absolutely necessary. In the short months that they’ve been together, Cas has learned so much about Dean that he feels absolutely certain about that judgment. Even the pelts for their blankets, including the one that Dean had made him repair as both a consequence and a teaching tool, were found objects. He only takes them from animals that have died.
Cas waits his turn, but the closer he gets, the more tense he gets. Dean moves closer at his back, gives him a touch of contact and then moves back. It isn’t significant enough to be noticed by anyone else, but it does its job. Cas’s shoulders loosen and settle. When they get to the front of the line, Mikhail turns to block the door. Cas stops a short distance away, well within his personal space and waits.
“I know it looks bad, but you’re going to have to trust me. This is just a temporary thing. I’ll be fine soon.”
“I just have to pack all of this into your car, and then we can leave. Most of it is food and supplies that I took from the church kitchen. I was going to stop at a store on the way, but this is so much more convenient.”
The adrenaline panic makes him feel desperate. At that moment, he would give anything, do anything, to keep Cas safe. Instead of letting his turmoil show, he snarls at his friends, his family with cold, merciless rage.
“Cas, I want you so bad, baby. You’re so incredibly hot.” Even though his words sound a touch melodramatic, Cas feels their honesty in the way Dean is holding him, in the tremble in his voice.
Even after weeks without Dean, the compression at his center keeps pushing deeper and with greater force. The pressure and weight of loss will have to give eventually, unless he is destined to become a black hole.
Normally, the psychological control would be Cas’s favorite part of playing with dominance. Not with Dean, though. Rewarding him, wrecking him with pleasure, will be the best part.
Dean looks up and shrugs his shoulders. “I should probably call around and figure something out. If I can’t find a place to crash, I’ll probably drive around randomly and pick a hotel.”
I know I left you on a cliff hanger of sorts last time, and everyone was VERY vocal about how they felt about Cas's actions. So, this chapter is the fallout. It's sad. I actually cried while I wrote parts of it because it hurt me to hurt them.
Dean sighs at the thought of the delicious man that he has been getting to know physically. Everything about him is perfection. Dean licks his lips, remembering the kisses they shared before they packed up the tent this morning. The angel is beautiful beyond reason.
He’s felt sick since Dean handed him the MLA listings this morning. He was rudely confronted by the chasm of differences between them for the first time in weeks, and he hasn’t been able to get his feet back under him. Dean assured him that he didn’t have that kind of cash on hand. He’s counting on the federal funding that he’s been pursuing for a little over a year. He’s in the final steps of the process, and finding the location is one of those steps. Even with federal grants, he has to put down a substantial down payment. For this particular place, Dean will have to write a check for a minimum of $300k. When the realtor broke it down for him, he didn’t even flinch.
Cas allows a predatory smile to slide up and recites a nasty little bit of Latin. “Dormīs cum puerīs mūtūniātīs, et non stat tibi, quod stat illīs.”
“I doubt he would raise a hand to protect me,” Castiel denies. “I imagine he would rather have the privilege of running me through.”
“So, they didn’t mind you being there after all,” Sam comments before he takes a bite of his third slice.
Cas looks up with what could only be described as a pout, but Dean can’t quite believe he’s seeing it on his face. “It’s already six something. It’s not that early.”
Cas peeks at him with one eye. “You really aren’t bothered by me getting off on the idea of impregnating you?”
“If you come here, we could make it twice the reason to celebrate…” she suggests, leaving her meaning open to interpretation. As if it wasn’t obnoxiously obvious. Ever since they asked if they could get married at their house, she’s been chomping at the bit to make it happen.
After their impromptu shopping excursion, where they outfit not only Dean, but their entire camping trip, they settle in for a late breakfast before heading on to the interior of Poland.
Dean scrambles to comply with Cas’s request. Hell, it wasn’t a request. He can’t really call it anything but an order. Dean’s never been very submissive, despite his love of pain. He’s too mouthy. Cas takes the reins so beautifully, though. It’s giving him ideas to add to their ever-expanding exploration.
Dean can’t see a thing but red. He’s been in Greece since the morning after Cas left him in Provence, which was two full days ago. He started looking for Cas this afternoon, but no such luck. Either his omega isn’t on the island yet, or reconnecting is going to be more difficult than they thought. He won’t let another alternative into his mind. Cas is fine. He will arrive soon.
He chances a glance to confirm that his pursuers are still, well, pursuing. They are, but slowly. He grins. This could enlarge his lead. They don’t look nearly as deft and agile as he is in this terrain.  Years of training in the wildest corners of the planet have honed his body into a war machine. His strength is unsurpassed, his survival and fighting skills highly coveted, and his tactical mind the best in Her Majesty’s Royal Navy. He has earned his place of leadership, despite his young age.
Dean is losing his mind to hear that his mate had almost been run down in the street while he was wrapping up a meeting. He pledges to never let Cas be anything but top priority from now on.
He would crack a joke and push the tender emotion away if anyone else said something that sappy, especially during sex. With Cas, though, he leans into it.
“No, he would be the first one to smack me and tell me to get the fuck over it.” Dean lifts his lips in a sad approximation of a smile. “But it still guts me, Cas. After seven years, thinking of him still has the ability to bring me to my knees.”
Cas lays back on the bed, stretching his body out in a provocative display designed to entice. “I would be fine with that.”
Dean swallows hard, legs shaking and knees wobbly as he sits on Cas’s bed. He leaves a respectful distance, but Cas urges him forward. Arousal makes Dean’s gut clench. There is something erotic about being this close to one of the most dangerous men in the world while he’s at his most vulnerable. Dean can feel his cock fill, knows that soon it will be impossible to hide his body’s interest. The thin fabric of the prison uniform conceals no secrets.
“You do not have to be Bratva to be with me. We will find a way without you pissing your life away.”
At that moment, their bottle of lube, Dean’s hairbrush, and Cas’s black belt hit the bed one by one, right in Dean’s line of sight. Fuck. Seeing the implements of pain make everything more real, more imminent. Dean sighs and dips his back into a lower arch, trying to tempt Cas to get started.
Dean bites his lip, fidgeting with the thought as he stares into the floor. Sighing, he gets up and moves over to the bed and quietly asks Cas if he would take it off.
Dean brings him to the surface so they can talk, but Cas beats him to it. “Is that magma that is glowing down there? What are all those little things in the water? They’re too big to be plankton, right? Where are we?”
Dean is much thirstier than he’d thought and finishes the entire bottle. When he looks back at Cas, he’s taken off his pants and shoes, but left his shirt on. The challenging look in his eye says that he’s done it on purpose. “Something wrong, pet?”
After the first two weeks, Cas is well enough to go back to his apartment. He is able to focus more, and should be able to work more hours, too. To be honest, though, he’s in no hurry to go back to his life in South Boston. It isn’t the luxurious surroundings, although they’re nice too. It’s being a constant and expected part of Dean’s life. That’s the real draw.
Dean doesn’t hesitate. He’s never been body shy, and he adores the way that Cas watches him. He practically drowns in the lust radiating from his Dom. The energy is tense and highly controlled, which is an amazing feat considering that Cas is simply sitting in a chair and watching.
Looking back over the past few weeks, he realizes that he should have seen the signs. In Brugge, Cas was so scared that his body put out distress pheromones that drugged him. Everything was great until they were leaving the brewery. Before then, they were having the time of their lives. Afterward, he was panicky and scared.
Dean gulps. “I’m clean, too. I was tested six months ago, and I hadn’t had sex in over a year before you.”
Michael looks positively apoplectic. It’s far too easy to get under his sibling’s skin, and Castiel should feel ashamed for such adolescent behavior. He’s not.
“He didn’t matter to me. He propositioned me, I turned him down. He followed me to my rooms and caught me in a moment of weakness.”
Cas follows his eyes to the road in front of them. They are leaving the open plains and entering a thick wood, but up ahead, in the shadows, the road is obstructed. Dean reins in to force the entire group to a halt. One quick look tells Cas that Dean has slipped on the armor of his training. He is in warrior head space, and Cas needs to let him lead. His jaw is set, his eyes eagle-sharp. There is an economy of motion to him now, a silence as he slips to the ground and goes to investigate.
Dean can’t concentrate on anything but the feeling of Cas taking ownership of his body, mind, and soul. He lets go of the reins and puts himself in Cas’s exceptionally capable hands. His head has dropped to Cas’s shoulder, tilted toward his neck. Harsh breaths warm his own face as he tucks closer under his jaw. “Yes, Cas. So fucking good.”
Dean chuckles. That was a bit of a non-sequitur, even without the distracting man rubbing his cock on him.
“Hey, there’s nothing to be sorry for. You’re being honest.” He stands and puts his hand on Cas’s shoulder. “I’m going to go check in at the doctor’s office and take a breather, okay? Why don’t you eat and I’ll be back to pick you up in a few.”
Darwin furrows his brow and hums in thought. Stroking his long, unkempt beard, he agrees, “Yes, that is quite interesting indeed.”
“Boys, I have never rooted so hard for two people to find their way back to each other. Seeing you together makes me believe in magic again.”
“If?” Dean asks as he gestures for his friend to take a seat at the table while he goes to retrieve the large pan. “Have I ever not been hungry, Cas?”
Cas touches under Dean’s chin with light fingertips, an intimate gesture, but as much as they are willing to risk when they are in public. This kind of public, anyway.
Staring down the Fae, Castiel scrambles internally for the answer to this untenable situation. It comes to him once he notices Dean’s collar.
Dean concedes with a nod. This man either has encyclopedic knowledge of obscure facts or he has been looking into Dean’s former life. Either option terrifies him.
Dean turns down a new contract the following morning because it would require too much of his time, and right now Jimmy is his priority. Figuring out who this Azazel person really is and what his connection is to Jimmy is the first step. Part of his brain is screaming at him to be reasonable. The contract would pay his bills for a couple of months, but he honestly wouldn’t be able to give it his full concentration.
Cas hums as he widens the gap between his cheeks and rubs over the little knot again. “Normally I’d prep you right, rimming you until I had you dripping and gaping open. But that’s not what we’re doing here, is it?”
With a shake of his head, he sets the phone down and signals the bartender for another drink. He isn’t going to get sloppy, but being back in Pasadena is messing with his head. He swore he’d never come back here, and if it weren’t for this client that his burgeoning business needs desperately, he would have had no problem sticking to his guns.
Dean can’t help but get a little thrill out of seeing Castiel so flustered. It’s not a look he’s ever seen on the man. Never. Not once. A swell of pride accompanies the power that warms him. Yeah, that feels really fucking good.
“Don’t be like that, Cas. I was just saying how adorable I thought it was that you keep trying anyway.”
Castiel will truly regret only a few things in his life. This moment, when he sees the open admiration drop from Dean’s face, to be replaced by stinging betrayal, will be among them.
Dean gives it his best shot, but Cas is right. His bond hasn’t developed enough yet. Instead, he gives Cas a show. Climbing onto the low mattress, he knee-walks over Cas’s legs as he slowly pops each button of his shirt, a lingering pause in between. His eyes stay glued to Cas’s body, hunger burning in them. He parts the material of his shirt but leaves it on.
He wants to make sure that Dean has a complete understanding of the issue, so he continues. “Even with such lax laws, it is still frowned upon, despite our history. Our official church is Eastern Orthodox, which believes same sex relations to be a sin.”
“Fucking heavenly… I’m close, Dean.” The angel pants as he rolls his hips into those sinful lips. Catching Dean’s heavy-lidded gaze is enough to push him over the edge.
“Yeah…” Sam is mesmerized by him, cataloging his features quickly and filing them away. As soon as he’s done, he turns to Dean with pity in his eyes.
“No, but we need to leave, Cas. I can hear guards coming in. Shift change is about to happen, and then we’ve got a whole other crew to deal with.”
Dean’s lips seek out the source of their necessity, and Cas knows that there’s no denying this gorgeous, wanton creature. He will give him whatever he wants. Even when their purposes run counter to each other, he can’t say no. Every touch warms his skin, every lick fans the flames, every nip sends current racing through him until Cas is yearning just as fervently to get Dean alone.
It’s obvious to Cas that Dean will do whatever he wants. His mate is so good to him, so thoughtful. Making a pained face, Cas explains, “I’d feel kind of bad about ditching them so quickly, despite the fact that I can’t wait to get you alone.”
“Yeah, right there,” he assures him. “Can you picture it, baby? You’d take it so well, stretched out wide on my cock as I drilled into you.”
Dean gets a little choked up, but Cas is absolutely right. It’s perfect. Dean leans down to kiss his brilliant boyfriend. “Thank you, Angel.”
He immediately takes his hands away from Dean. The drastic loss of contact almost hurts, and Dean finds himself shifting to find friction. Cas holds his hips down, but praises “Bine! That was amazing, Dean! Breathe deep, sweetheart. It will help.” Dean is radiant with the praise. The more he focuses on Cas’s words, the less the loss of his touch aches. Okay. That was not fun, but he feels pride that he could do what Cas asked of him.
“You haven’t ejaculated yet. We bypassed that normal path to orgasm, so when you do actually come, you’re going to cover me in it.” Cas is undeniably pleased when his prediction proves true.
She continues to study page after page, mentally cataloging his significant skill set while she absorbs each piece as a whole as well.
“You should see yourself right now, how beautifully you surrender to me. Completely pliant, taking everything I give you and just accepting it. Even without your sight, you trust me. You are absolutely stunning.”
He just wants them to release Cas before they have a chance to book him. This arrest shouldn’t go on his record, so time is of the essence. Once they have processed him, it will take a lot more work to remove it.
Dean can hear the line in the sand that Cas has just drawn. “Okay, Cas. I’ll be honest with my limits, but check in if you need to.”
Dean grunts. He’s aware of Cas’s mood, but with the rumors already flying around, he is not going to be pulled into his snare and make them worse.
“I will have the human,” is the reaction he receives, but the Unseelie does not move. With one problem in hand, he turns to the angel.
The queen gestures for them to come closer, her shrewd eyes betraying the air of nonchalance she is affecting. “Why have you come to our lands without invitation?”
Cas raises his brow in interest as he moves his exploration to the rows of suckers underneath the thickest part of Dean’s tentacle. When he makes solid contact with one, it flattens enough to build pressure between it and his skin. The suction is mild, but it’s apparent, and as soon as one latches on, others cling to him like the antithesis of falling dominoes.
Running with your eyes on the area above you is about the dumbest thing you can do while carrying a homemade flamethrower, but Dean does it. He’ll be quadruple damned if he lets this fucker get away again.
Dean looks suitably embarrassed; the pink highlights in his face prove it. “I was just trying to leave.”
“I want to fuck you against those windows with nothing between us and the outside world but that crystal-clear glass. Still okay with it?”
“Dean?” Sam sounds absolutely terrified, which makes Dean work harder to piece together the puzzle. It isn’t until the movement stops and one of the walls opens that Dean finally realizes he’s in an ambulance. With that foundation in place, the rest of the picture becomes clear. He’s at a hospital.
“Want you on my tongue, baby,” he answers, punctuating each word with a huff of air forced out of his lungs. Dean is aching for this orgasm, can’t wait to see Cas flying over the edge and joining him in sweet release.
Cas replies with a sour look and muttered curses. “In Russian it is lyubimyy, which means favorite or beloved.” He pauses a minute with a sly smile. “Or suprug.”
Coffee is his only fuel this morning, but it was so worth it. He grins around his cup as he thinks back to the night before. He hasn’t been able to focus solely on Cas’s pleasure like that in a long time. His dominant, and very strong, boyfriend typically turns the tide on him after a few minutes. Last night, though, Dean pleaded with him to lie back and just let Dean give to him.
Being considered weak in any way to these men is dangerous. Cas warned him to always err on the side of violence if he’s unsure. He’d thought the redundant reminders and frequent questioning were a sign of Cas’s lack of confidence in him, but now he’s thankful for it. He isn’t feeling the least bit unsure of himself, even as he looks his potential enemies in the eye.
When he does let them go, he makes them take the boat, and watches until it is out of the harbor before he turns and runs for the gelato shop they had visited the day before. The looks he receives range from irritated to downright hostile, but he can’t still be in town when they turn the boat back towards the shore.
Dean doesn’t want to think anymore. It’s too much, too overwhelming. He lets Castiel pull him in for a kiss.
Meg leans over Cas’s legs to get a better look at Dean, who flirts back with a wink. “Team dick, huh? That is just too damn bad. Although, that explains why you’re with our dear Clarence.”
“The food is nutritious, and your body needs it to heal.” Dean shrugs and goes back to his reading. The other two books that Sam brought haven’t begun to hum or sparkle, so he’s doing something unique with them; he’s actually reading them. The textbook is left at the bottom of his bag. He might be fine, but he’s not such a diligent student that he’s going to do homework while he’s on a psych hold.
“Cas,” he tries to reason with him, but Dean is completely out of vocabulary. He huffs his aggravation and points at the pile of garbage by the fire. Then he points to the blanket Cas is wrapped in. Then back to the pile of charred…
He fires off a quick text to Sam and then goes out for a walk around the unit to investigate. In the common area, there are games and art supplies, but a serious shortage of books. There is a Stephen King novel, which, no thank you. That is not a vehicle he’s willing to jump into. The only other one is one of those teen vampire books. While he might be willing to have Cas bite him, and isn't that an intriguing thought, he’s fairly certain that this trashy romance is not going to be a useful find. He’s definitely not going to read it, either.
Panting breath and a challenging stare convince Cas that Dean knows what he is asking. He uses the little bit of saliva to coat his engorged cock and, spreading Dean’s cheeks wide, pushes his way inside. Dean sucks in a deep lungful of air, head falling back against Cas’s shoulder.
Dean chuckles and takes another kiss. They build their lust in a feedback loop. Cas gives and Dean takes. Dean offers up and Cas demands more. In the span of moments, they are panting into each other, blood crashing through bodies trembling with arousal.
His arm pulls Dean closer as he tucks his nose down into his hair. He’s still not close enough. He needs to feel every bit of Dean’s skin on his, but this isn’t a sexual need. Cas is craving intimacy, needing the comfort of knowing that Dean wants to be in his arms.
Being curled protectively around this stranger is oddly less intimate than sharing personal details. His arm is slung over his broad shoulders which are hunched in on themselves.
Finally, Dean asks him a question before he gets up. Cas shakes his head, not understanding until Dean gestures drinking something. Cas nods and smiles up at him. With the heat and weight of Dean suddenly gone from his body, Cas both literally and figuratively feels cold.
His eyes close as he kisses down the side of Cas’s neck. Vanilla cream is mixing with his constant ripe peach scent. Dean is finding it difficult to remember that they are in a very crowded bar.
I am finally coming back around to this sequel, and I won't be abandoning it. In fact, this story is what I'm working on for my Camp NaNoWriMo challenge in July. I promise multiple updates over the next few weeks.
Cas shakes himself out of his lustful reverie, sits down in the chair, and pulls the plate of food closer to him. “Those are thoughts for later, though. I need to feed you before I forget myself again.”
He ignores her, “You said that Novak and Boyar grew up together. They could be working together, teaming up to-”
Dean swallows hard and takes a step back. This Cas still frightens him, especially since he hardly sees evidence of this side of him anymore. This is the mafia boss that Dean met in prison. This is the Solntsevskaya Avtoritet that reigns over Moscow with fists and blades. Seeing his lover devolve into primal aggression is both terrifying and a complete turn on.
An unappreciated giggle bursts from her lips. “Oh, you adorable creature. This is a simple misunderstanding. To the Fae, sex and fertility are the same. When we say he needs sex, we mean that he needs to be fertilized.”
They drift away from the bar over the next several months, but not from each other, and definitely not on Christmas Eve. The first year, they are so caught up in each other that they don’t even hear their friends’ obnoxious comments about how sickening they are. It makes Patty smile.
“Well, I suppose I’ll end up in prison for a while. Maybe once I’m out he’ll be ready to leave his career behind and take me back?”
“What happened to being free to choose, Cas?” Dean chastises through a smile. “I’m getting mixed messages.”
Dean smiles and pulls Cas in by the back of the neck. As soon as his omega catches his scent, he doesn’t have to be led anymore. He puts his nose against Dean’s neck, breathing deep and settling instantly. His arms weave around whatever parts of Dean he can reach while Dean rubs his lips against his temple.
Looking up at Cas, he doesn’t see a little smile like he expects, but a look of devastation. His eyes are watery and his chin quivers. Before he can ask what’s wrong, Cas leaps at him, kissing him with urgency. Barely separating from his lips, he sobs, “I want to remember you. I want to know all of our stories; I want to share these memories. Why would they take this from me?”
When he rounds the corner, the scene becomes bleaker. This is not just bigotry. It is generational hate fueled by ignorance. Four members of the Aryan Brotherhood have a skinny black man down on the tiled floor, taking turns stomping on him with their ratty black boots.
Cas sits up on his knees and smacks Dean’s ass cheek sharply. “In every way, but for now? Exactly like that.”
He meets Dean’s eyes again, lust drunk without even touching him. He’s breathing like a bull, seconds away from doing something incredibly stupid, embarrassing, or both. “Yeah, sweetheart. I –I need to stretch my legs for a minute...I’ll be...be back.”
“I have very fond memories of laying on the floor of your living room and drawing or reading while you practiced. Hours and hours every week, and you never complained because you obviously loved it. Even in my adult life, I’ve never heard someone who plays with the emotion that you did when you were just a kid. There’s no way you didn’t pursue music.”
“At least twice a week, sometimes more. If we advertised using some of your artwork, I’m sure that would increase. You could probably make it a full-time gig.”
“He was on school grounds and because I wasn’t a student and I wasn’t family, I wasn’t allowed to see him.” Dean’s eyes fill as he speaks, the pain of that day as fresh as five years ago. Sam has insinuated it’s because he won’t deal with his grief, but Dean knows that it’s because it is  the worst thing he could ever imagine happening.
Laying all night in a cocoon of the prince’s personal scent had been a unique torture. He spent agonizing hours listening to the shift and rustle of silk sliding over the man’s body, taking in the breathy sighs as he settled into sleep. He was now all too aware that Cas didn’t sleep soundly when he wasn’t under the influence of opium or excessive drink. Whenever Dean had moved, Cas woke abruptly.  After too many repetitions, Dean took pity on him and laid a heavy hand on his shoulder.
Castiel tries to keep his eyes off of the couple, keep himself unaffected by their beauty. He must be completely in control of himself for their own part in the ceremony. Thankfully, the part that he must play tonight is simple. He and Dean will simply pledge themselves to be partners for the season. They will then purify each other with a symbolic bathing.
“I want you, Cas. So much,” Dean purrs as he snakes his limbs around Cas’s body. His lips caress Cas’s, begging for entry. The angel relents, having no reason to ever deny Dean. As their mouths tangle together, though, Cas feels that there’s something he’s not catching.
Sam eyes the small opening. Cas’s lips twitch. “Sorry, Sam. Wallachians are not typically so...large.”
“I don’t know what’s going on here, but we’re going to wait for my brother before we decide what to do.”
“Your transition is advanced, and if they kill you here, you’ll die in the present. I refuse to take that chance. I’m sorry, Dean.”
Cas turns his attention to Dean’s zipper, and then sliding both his jeans and boxers down over his ass. Dean shivers when he feels light fingers brush over his cleft. When his cock pops free, Cas moans, the first lustful sound he’s allowed to escape. “You’re a big boy, aren’t you? This is going to be fun.”
He brushes fingers along Dean’s flanks, waiting for his response. Dean almost chokes on his own spit in a rush to say yes. “Yes. Absolutely, yes,” he breathes.
Dean turns his head in deeper to Cas’s neck and lets his fortifying words soak into him. The growling rumble vibrates through his throat and chest as he listens.
“Michael, I’m not going to warn you again. The next time you speak to Mr. Winchester, I’ll have you arrested for contempt.”
Cas complies easily, stretching his arms high over his head as he does. The stretch of his lean muscles is delicious, almost as much as the surprise flash of metal piercing his nipples.
“Oh, that’s entirely up to you, Dean. I’m going to give you a challenge. If you can do what I ask, I’m all yours,” Cas purrs.
When he returns, he guides Dean back down to kneel on the cushion. Dean feels a delicate touch on his bruised shoulder and a sympathetic sound from Cas. “Jesus, sweetheart. I really did a number on you, didn’t I?”
Cas continues trying to reason with this lunatic even though he knows it to be futile. What else can he possibly do? If he stalls long enough, Dean might get home before the situation escalates out of control. “I am in love with Dean. Do you understand what that means? I don’t want to be with anyone else.”
Dean quirks a smile. “No, she’s not cheating. She’s not doing anything untoward as far as I can see, and I was pretty invasive. Her schedule is routine, she doesn’t have any separate bank accounts, and she isn’t showing any deceptive behaviors.”
The reverberations of Dean’s purring growl run up through Cas’s body, pulling a shiver along with them. He tips his head into the wooden post, arching his back to give Dean better angles. His husband has a wickedly clever tongue, and it is a matter of a minute or two before Cas is dizzy with pleasure.
Dean realizes that Cas is making certain dangerous assumptions. Yes, many of the assumptions are probably true, but he needs to head this off before it drives a wedge between them.
Cas’s eyes go wide in surprise. A faint smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. He feels a warmth in his chest that makes him feel almost weightless. Is this what it’s like to feel a mother’s love?
He’s missing something, something fundamental. When the meeting ends, Cas and Michael continue their conversation as they leave the room. Naturally, the guards follow behind them. After a few steps, Castiel stiffens and turns halfway.
Castiel has never been this cold. Not even when he walked through a blizzard when he was a young boy. The salt water had been cold, frigidly cold, but the adrenaline of his panic kept his focus on surviving and not on his temperature. Sitting in the wet sand in his sopping wet clothes is not doing him any favors. There aren’t other options, though. He’s not going into that cave. He’s not taking off the only clothes he has. So, he’s just sitting huddled up and listening to the steady rhythm of his teeth chattering.
Distantly, he realizes that he feels hard metal at his back. Michael took his phone and his keys, which were in his hands, but he didn’t take his gun. He didn’t know it was there; he had old intel.
Cas follows the trajectory of his predatory gaze. When he realizes who has caught his perverse attention, fury crawls up his spine and clouds his brain with a crimson haze. Cas will not stand for Dean becoming a murder statistic in South Boston. His sets his jaw and walks around the fence to the edge of the court, directly opposite from where Michael is standing. He moves deliberately, making his presence known. With an intensely-focused glare, he crosses his arms over his chest, widens his stance, and tips his head down. Michael sees him, can feel that he is now being watched. He doesn’t acknowledge Cas, but his posture hunches slightly and he steps back.
Dean’s brow knits in consternation. He wants to submit. He needs to. But...this feels like a challenge he can’t accomplish. Cas will be disappointed. He doesn’t want to disappoint his angel, his Stăpân.
Cas steps closer and catches Dean’s hand. “I think I already know which one you want, you know. I’ve seen the way you look at her.”
Cas looks vulnerable and sweet buried in the fussy layers of down duvets and silk sheets. Guileless eyes beg for truth when he asks, “Did you mean what you said?”
Cas growled without looking up from his laptop, “Unfortunately not. I have to claim that miscreant as a blood relative.”
“I love my mother dearly, but this is one thing that drives me crazy. She will fuss and hover until she passes out tonight. There’s nothing I can do to rein it in, either.”
When Cas finally gets outside, he sees Dean held face down in deep mud by three men, his left arm at an unnatural angle. A shout of alarm erupts from him. The soldiers are so caught up in their sport that they don’t hear him. His face set like stone, he yells to Alastair, “Tell them to stop.”
Dean kisses his shock away, slowly getting his brain back online. “So that’s a yes, I take it?” he teases.
Saying a proper goodbye this time, Cas hugs both of the women, promising to visit and bring Dean with him next time. With a good shove, the boat slides away from the shore, and he is on his way back to the life that he is choosing.
Dean looks around his room for the last time. It is empty of all of his furniture, clothes, and pictures. Still, he can’t help but feel the presence of his ghosts.
Cas runs his hands through his hair, still trying to get on top of the panic attack before it gets out of control.
Cas comes back in quietly when he’s had a chance to get himself under control. Dean notices that his eyes carefully avoid the newly tattooed skin. He’s really sinking into the pleasure-pain again, so seeing Cas struggle to keep his libido in check makes him want. “Can you come here?” he asks sweetly.
He hands Dean the bottle of tuiça with a warning. “Be careful. It is very strong. Don’t drink too much because I can’t carry you back.”
“It’s no problem,” Cas nods curtly and urges Dean back into Meg’s cubicle. He sighs and leans against the wall.
At dinner that night, Dean receives the first gift. He is pulled forward to the front of the line and given the best portions of the barely passable meal. The best part though, is the special dessert that is waiting on him. With a matronly pat on the cheek, the proud cook hands him the Sharlotka, a lovely apple cake that smells like heaven. “It is my mother’s recipe, straight from St. Petersburg. Mr. Krushnic thought that you would like it.”
“True. But we have been following the clues, and this answer doesn’t actually answer anything. We don’t have a clue of what to do now.”
Dean is filled with pride to see Cas putting such hard work into his new hobby. Even to Dean’s untrained eye, it is obvious that Cas is excelling at this new art medium. With every new work he creates, Dean is awestruck. Just using a reference picture from an art book, Cas is able to create the most beautiful and masterful reproductions of priceless art.
“I know,” he agrees shakily, turning his head to capture Cas’s lips in a teasing kiss. “He just surprised me.”
Even so, as Castiel’s bed mates give up orgasm after orgasm, he can’t help his curiosity. What would it be like to be in the hands of someone so obviously skilled? Could he actually let a man touch him? His cheeks explode with heat as he let the thoughts wander into a tentative fantasy.
Cas laughs at that last one, especially with the way Dean pops the ‘C’. The look in his eyes dares Cas to believe his lie.
“You shouldn’t have had to-” Dean’s voice cracks. He looks away to pull himself together. “Sorry. Continue, please.”
John wipes a hand over his mouth, a gesture so reminiscent of Dean that it sends a shock to his battered heart. It has been beating along at a limping pace since he last saw Dean in the courtroom weeks ago.
A guttural sound rumbles from Dean as he palms himself. His dick bobs up into his hand. Feet are not sexy. He can’t even remember if anyone has ever touched his feet before. This is insane, and yet his head is spinning from the need to grab and tug on his errant dick. If he didn’t have an audience, that is exactly what he would do.
Worry about his health rears its paranoid head, and he isn’t doing a great job hiding it. Ever since the weakness came over him, Dean has been asking questions. Cas knows that Dean has access to his thoughts and his scent is giving away what his thoughts aren’t.
In his new office, Dean is working on some budgeting for his fledgling business. He’s made a name for himself with the local police department as someone who works honestly and stays out of their way. Most of the leads he receives are either passed on to those the police can’t help or word of mouth. He has a website, but it might as well be a yellow pages ad for all the information it contains.
Pursing his lips, Dean pulls on a pair of nitrile gloves and shoves the smarmy dick out of his way. He lifts the prison-issued shirt up to see the wound. It’s difficult to see the damage through the ink covering his skin. A quick glance verifies that there is very little skin on the man’s abdomen not covered in tattoos. He fights the itch to run his fingers over the lines. Focus, Dean. Stab wound.
Dean hangs his head as an act of contrition, but it’s more to hide his pleased smile. He knows that Cas is going to give him the thing he’s been craving for months.
Dean was forced to drop his own pack ages ago, his too visible red coat being the first thing he discarded. Whoever decided to put Her Majesty’s soldiers in blazing red and send them into the verdant green forests of Eastern Europe should have their heads removed from their shoulders for their lack of sense. The color looks magnificent and bold in a parade, but gets men killed in the field.
“Imagine that coupled with really intense vibration and the drag of a needle across your skin.” Cas leans back to see panic on Dean’s face when he whispers, “Fuck, I’m going to get hard, aren’t I?”
His curious mood lasts, even after they arrive at Bobby’s salvage yard. He had texted while Dean was in the chair and asked them to stop by.
When he knows that he has cleaned every drop away, he pulls off of Cas’s spent cock regretfully. Cas is slack-jawed and taking deep, heaving breaths, his skin flushed all the way down to his chest. Puffed up with satisfaction, Dean makes room for Cas to slip back into the warm water and wrap around him. Lazy, soothing kisses swap between them for long minutes.
When he hangs up the phone and slides it in his pocket, Boyar snarls. “He’s tainted you. I knew he’d done damage, that I’d have to burn out some of his influence, but I can’t believe you would betray me like this.”
Cas fights the moan, but it escapes. “Fuck, Dean. I might, too. I don’t know how I’m going to handle the sight of my cock dipping into this perfection.”
“Absolutely. You look like you were born to ride an old chrome beauty like an Indian. Maybe a Triumph.”
Scarlet licks over the skin of his cheeks, trailing down his neck. “I-I know that I have to stretch first, and that we have to use something slick.”
“You were never my prisoner. I’ve told you this before, Cas. I brought you here because you were so alone and I could feel your pain. I wanted to be your companion.”
“Mr. Winchester noticed something about the island birds that I thought you might find fascinating.”
“Later,” Cas interrupts. Setting his bag down and guiding Dean over to sit on the couch with him, he says, “You seem nervous.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Castiel fusses under his breath. He moves in behind the ensnared man, using his body to take his weight and give some slack to the chains.
Already, Dean has more to think about than he can acknowledge, let alone process. Still, he has to know, “Why me?”
The uniformed officer scowls at him, crossing his arms over his chest defiantly, but Dean won’t be cowed. He hates doing this. He legitimately despises using his family’s influence, but if there was ever a time, it’s now.
He dives into the water, unconcerned by its shallowness or the abundance of rocks. He has picked up exceptional swimming skills in his time with Dean, and he uses every one of them to try to catch up with him. It is an impossible task, trying to keep up and overtake a creature made for swimming the world’s oceans. He doesn’t give up until he can barely lift his arm out of the water to take another stroke. If he doesn’t stop Dean now, he might never be able to get back to him.
Why is he accepting this so easily? It’s hard to deny the experiences he’s had, but – time travel? He’s not dreaming, he knows that much, but what if there is a third alternative? What if he is legitimately losing his mind? How would he know? There must be some irrefutable proof that would convince him. Can he bring something back with him?
“I’m so glad that menace isn’t directed at me for once,” Dean laughs but immediately twinges with regret. His ribs are in many more pieces than they should be, and are reminding him every time he moves.
Cas turns Dean’s face to his. “No, you have not. I trust you, Dean. My anger is with those who try to come between us.”
Cas leans closer, “I had no idea you enjoyed my practicing. I always thought you just tolerated it.”
Suddenly, what Cas wants to do makes complete sense. He nods and pulls his shirt over his head without another thought. He catches the shiver that runs through Cas as he reveals his skin. Never one to be body shy, Dean flicks his eyes up to hold his after he drops the shirt on the ground, running his hands over himself.  Lazily, he pops the button on his jeans and stalks towards Cas. “How are you going to paint me?”
Allowing himself to look at Dean for the first time since his return, Cas reassures himself that his lovely ward is unharmed. “What happened while I was gone, malysh?”
He doesn’t really wait for Dean’s response, as if he knows he will accept the terms, whatever they are. It stings a little that Cas assumes he’s so desperate that he won’t balk at the weird request. It stings more to know that he’s right.
Cas’s anger wilts.  “It’s not preferable, no. But if the choice is between me or you? It should always be me.”
When they aren’t talking, they are feeding their insatiable sexual appetites. Dean takes to sucking cock amazingly well. After only a couple of weeks, his skills rival Cas’s own. He can’t get enough of making Cas come apart at the seams. Seeing the authoritative man lose his vaunted control pleases him like nothing else.
Cas looks down at the artwork and then away. His hand drops when he answers. “I drew that when I was in a really dark place. I have a better self-image now.”
Dean tips their foreheads together and agrees. “Okay. Step up the decision-making process. Got it. But right now, I really need to be close to you. This bond of ours is a greedy, demanding bitch.”
He finds bushes and rocks to hide behind all the way to the denser copse of trees where the creature is hiding. Careful to stay silent, Dean turns on his mini flamethrower. If he’s lucky, he will be able to incinerate the thing without earning any further injuries.
Dean and Cas continue their weekend vacation / hideout from the creepy stalker. There are surprises, kinky discussions, and of course, lots of lust.
Cas sits up to run his hands along the flat planes of his abdomen. Licking his lips, he brushes Dean’s hands out of the way so that he can take over working open his breeches. Cas’s nimble fingers get them open quickly, and they are just as quickly pushed over the perfect swell of his ass. Cas is already gripping his half erect cock before he can rid himself of the tangled fabric at his knees.
Even with the space, he can’t find Dean, though he knows he’s here. He continues the hunt, wishing his charge would stop frequenting places where protecting him is impossible. Looking around the club, Cas can think of at least twenty ways that Dean could be in true danger. Fuck.
Dean is still hurt. He hasn’t forgiven Cas. More than anything, though, he wants to see him again. He isn’t going to wait to send a letter. He wants to talk to him now.
Page after page of the large road map proves useless, until finally he finds the match. The squiggly line turns out to be the exact route between Zadar and Budapest, Hungary. He slides the book back across the counter and takes the offered keys and his passport. He’ll figure out the significance of the lion on the way.
Dean nods his head slowly. “Sorry, Cas. You mentioned vessels and I realized that we’ve been having sex for weeks and I’d never given the guy a thought.”
He can already see the prophetic writing on the wall of their relationship. Dean is going to be done with him after this. As much as it rips him to shreds, a part of him is glad. Dean is too good for his worthless ass, and now he’s finally proved it. While his beautiful, kind, loving Dean moves on with his charmed life and follows his dreams of helping kids, he’ll be rotting in the federal pen.
Cas stops him at the first knuckle. He loves the look of amazement on Dean’s face. Experiencing this through Dean’s eyes is like being a virgin all over again. It’s better even, because he has the knowledge and experience to make this so good for Dean, while watching the wonder of having it for the first time on the face of the man he loves.
The jolt of lust rips through Cas at hearing his broken plea, and he tips over the edge with a shout. “Yes, Dean. Come now. Come with me.”
He guides Dean onto his back with his legs pulled up with his knees as close to his ears as he can get them. Cas slides a pillow under his hips to help keep him in position.
Dean doesn’t reply, just waits. Shit. He sometimes hates that Dean is not easily controlled, especially by deference to his title. Anyone else would fall all over themselves to avoid his displeasure. Cas steps into the large tub and has barely submerged himself before the first question comes.
“I did something I shouldn’t have, and he can’t be involved with me now or he could lose his career.”
“It takes fortitude to build calluses like these, Naomi,” she would chastise. “Castiel returns to his music each day knowing that it will hurt him, that he will sweat and bleed for his art.”
Extracting his mouth from Dean’s takes work and more than a little willpower. He shushes Dean when he tries to take another kiss.
“Never.” Sensing that this turn in conversation is bringing his Cas back, he eases back onto the road. “In fact, the last time I went camping, there was a gas barbecue grill and picnic table next to our tent. It even had a bath house with showers.”
“If I pushed my thumb between those fuckable lips and pulled down, I could have you open for me without you even moving. I love seeing your mouth stretched around me, Dean. It’s obscene how wide I force you open. Could you keep still while I used your mouth? If I slid my big cock in and out of you, could you keep yourself from licking and sucking me? Could you remain passive?”
Dean’s eyes open in surprise, and then a glint of wonderment crosses them. “So this is what it’s like to hear the best news in the world.”
It’s after dinner and still no one can confirm laying eyes on Cas since this morning. His instincts are screaming at him, but he shakes them off. He is often too protective when it comes to Cas. He doesn’t need to run around like a damned fool because he hasn’t seen his love in a few hours. All that will get him is incessant teasing. He walks calmly, if not swiftly, to Michael’s door. His knock is loud enough to bring the man himself to open it.
“Excellent.” Luke stands, heading for the door while tossing back a parting command. “Be in the Turkish Room at 7 o’clock. An ambassador for the Bishop of Constantinople will be here to finalize details for his grace’s visit next month.”
In the low light, it’s difficult to make out the shock of dark hair making its way towards them, but Dean is so attuned to Cas that he easily recognizes him. His lips tip up in contentment, and Benny turns to see Cas approach.
“Then why would you say that?!” Dean yells, emotion riding high and pinking up his face. “Why would you worry me like that?”
“In two days?” He breaks the connection with Dean reluctantly to see Ilya’s response. The man nods with a warm smile.
The accusation hits Sam between the eyes like a bullet. He looks back to Dean, who isn’t denying anything his apparent husband is saying. Instead, he looks down and away, uncomfortable at revealing his vulnerability. Cas steps closer to Dean and sweetly kisses his temple in support.
“You deserved so much better, Castiel. You are an extraordinary young man, and I’m so proud of who you have chosen to become in spite of your circumstances.”
“You’ll get no argument from me,” Dean smirks. “I’m in limbo, stuck between two worlds, one of which knows nothing about the other one. Being incomplete sucks.”
Cas rubs fingertips over Dean’s hip as he continues to toy with his entrance. “Have you ever taken anything bigger than a cock in your sweet hole, Dean?”
“Why are you here before me?” The queen asks, the same ritual question that has begun the ceremony for all couples before them.
Cas contemplates Dean’s words hesitantly. He’s afraid to do as Dean suggests because it is already difficult not to give in to letting go completely. He can give himself a little leeway, however. He just needs to remember that Dean is human and not let things go too far. “Yes, I can manage that.”
“He is all yours, Castiel. Enjoy him as you please. When you are through with him, there are several that have expressed interest in that luscious mouth. He will bring quite a price.”
He pronounces his name with three distinctive syllables, which makes Cas flinch internally. He can’t decide if it’s done more out of anger or disdain. He stands and, for the first time, looks John in the eye. “I appreciate you coming here, but I can’t afford your rates. You must know that.”
Luke looks around in surprise and takes a melodramatic whiff of the air. “Really? Nothing in this room seems like a reason for concern?”
Dean huffs out on a shy grin. “You know that I would have chosen you. I never could have stayed away forever.”
He opens Dean’s box of toys, making a production of browsing through them, even though he already knows what he wants to use. He pulls out a new vibrating plug, a long thin dildo, and the prostate massager. Each item is held up for inspection and then put back.
Cas sniffs and guides errant strands of hair off of Dean’s forehead. “He told me today that I need to give you space to form your own relationships.”
Huffing out a laugh, Dean feels a weight leave his shoulders and the clouds break overhead. “I don’t know why that didn’t occur to me. I’ve been killing myself trying to do exactly what is expected.”
Dean stands to go to his own bed, but looks back, pensive smirk gracing his lips. “Actually, I’m more freaked out by how okay I am with what happened.”
Even worse than the sharp-edged discomfort, his path has ended into the main one that he used to run out of the mountainside. In one direction, there is certain death, but in the other lies fear and uncertainty. His heart drops at the realization that he’s going to have to go back down the hill and chance running into Bart. As quietly as he can, he pads along the path with his ears alert.
The nurse crosses her arms over her chest and squints at him. “If you don’t eat before rounds this evening, the doctor will put in a feeding tube.”
He slips his index finger under the seal and hears it crack from the paper. He inhales a deep breath and opens it. His eyes drop to the end. He signed it Cas. He takes it as a good sign. The letter switches frequently among all three of their shared languages, probably to minimize damage if the letter was opened by anyone else. Dean feels a proud smile touch his face. Cas is clever.
“Not at all, Cas.” He flicks the lock behind him and walks over to the bed, his eyes lingering on every line of Cas’s body. “I think I’m developing a possessive kink. Seeing you wearing my things is really doing it for me.”
Realizing that this is going to be a common occurrence from now on, Sam starts the car with a muttered, “Fuck my life.”
He has time to think about it, too, because he won’t be able to see Dean for at least five days. He’s on restricted access, which means no visitors until the scheduled day.
Dean drops his book open on his lap and tilts his head in consideration. It’s such a Cas gesture, that his heart pings with the desire to see him. He will work on a way to visit once he gets the nurse off his back.
“Why are a principality of the Ottoman Empire at the moment. We are not allowed to have kings, merely princes.”
He wishes that he felt repulsed by the blood pouring from the man’s multiple new wounds. He wishes that he didn’t feel satisfaction when Dean tosses Bart off the edge of the cliff. He wishes that he could stay awake.
Dean is flabbergasted. He can understand why Cas would keep it private, but his work is gorgeous. He could be a very sought-after artist. “Will you show me the rest of your work?”
Cas switches to the left side for the first official slap. Dean hears the thunderclap as the nerve endings explode along his skin. “Unngh. Perfect, Cas.”
They both tremble when Dean releases his tight grip on Cas and lets gravity help force his body down while his hips snap up. Cas huffs out a forced exhale tipped with a moan.
“That’s what I was thinking. We don’t have to stay there to scout the area, but it would sure make it a hell of a lot easier.”
His nerves are giving way to his desires, and this time, Dean licks and sucks up to Cas’s head slowly, seductively, while keeping his eyes on him. Cas is affected, panting breaths and grip tight in the sheets.
Glancing at his watch again, Dean internally sighs. These meetings are the worst part of his new career. He has never had to woo a client before, and he isn’t great at self-promotion. Sam says that it has to do with the permanent scowl on his face and the fact that he could easily be an AI robot for all the humanity he shows. Whenever he teases his older brother, he receives nothing but his middle finger. Dean prefers to let his work speak for him. That and forcing himself to crack a smile might break more than it helps. It’s been close to five years since his life ended. Now, he’s just waiting out the rest of his time on earth without picking at too many old wounds. He’s forced to leave the past in the past when he sees his client hurry down the aisle to meet him.
At the lost look on Cas’s face, Dean reels him in and plants a kiss on his forehead. “It’s part of being a guardian of the ocean, Cas. I have to be available to all of the ocean.”
Dean swallows hard, but opens without hesitation when Cas extends his body over him. With one experimental thrust, Cas realizes that the piercing is going to get in their way, so he makes it vanish. Dean sounds his disapproval until Cas shoves his cock deep into his mouth in one long, intense thrust. Swiveling his hips to feel everything, Castiel tips his head back and swears. Even with angelic stamina, this is going to be the shortest blow job in history.
And that’s what it feels like without Dean. He is hollow, cold, and lonely. The hollowness he feels, it is a hole where Dean’s presence was and should still be. With sudden clarity, he knows that this heartbreak isn’t something that he’s going to heal from. It may not always be a gaping, raw wound, but it will never go away. Dean is the one true love of his life.
Dean smirks while he pulls up his jeans and zips them. He gives Cas a smacking kiss as he passes. “C’mon. I’ll drive you home.”
They wander in and out of shops on their way back to the inn where Cas is staying. He entertains Dean with stories of his time in Elizabethan London.
Cas smiles at him and shrugs off his shirt. Dean’s eyes snag on the bare skin while Cas sits on the bed, leaning into the headboard. He is content to let Dean look his fill. “I would have thought you’d be happy about the visual stimulation. You don’t make any pretense about how much you enjoy it.”
Oh, that he can definitely do. This particular fetish doesn’t often rear its ugly head, but watching the delight on Cas’s face as he tried so many unique and delicious flavor combinations dragged it out from the depths of his subconscious and shoved it under a spotlight.
“Your brothers and -” Dean leaves off the rest of his question as one by one, figures appear around them. There are dozens of people standing with them within seconds. Cas smiles at them all.
“I don’t know if I’ve forgotten what a prodigy you are at sucking cock or if you’ve gotten even better.”
Dean’s heart is racing now, panic making him tremble. He throws open the makeshift closet. Empty. Vacant. A whimper tries to bubble out, but he stomps it down. He crosses to his closet and finds everything exactly as he left it. What the fuck?
Dean purses his lips. He’s torn, but Sam pulls out the big guns. He lifts his brows and gives his older brother the most ridiculous puppy eyes he’s ever been able to manage. Dean rolls his eyes and shuts the door.
Cas looks down as he takes a last invasive step forward, and then tips just his eyes up with a coy smirk. “Well, it turns out that a trial won’t be needed.”
Her smile is brilliant and her hands are gripped together just under her chin, trying to hold in some of her exuberance. “Both of the patrons are interested in commissioning a piece from you. But, the gallery owner wants to view your portfolio first. She feels that she needs to vet your work before brokering any agreement.”
Cas nods along with Dean’s explanation, so he continues. “Plus, it feels very one-sided if it’s all focused on me.”
The gods are not on his side, as usual. His uptight prick of an older brother sees him and storms over for his unwelcome audience.
“You’ve never given me reason not to trust you, but I’ve also seen you deny yourself unnecessarily.”
Dean can see that Cas is hanging on by a thread, and he finally has the impetus to behave, so he doesn’t fight.
“I’m already there,” Cas confesses quietly, pupils dilated with lust, jaw clenched against the need to shout his pleasure when Dean descends on him again.
Leaning over his belly, Dean licks up every drop of his come that he can reach. Cas feels like his heart and brain might explode at the sheer blistering heat of this man.
Cas’s face softens into affection. “I feel the same way. I will miss you terribly.” Holding out his hand for Dean to take, he kisses his fingers and pulls him down on the bed with him. “How much longer is your sentence?”
It hasn’t always been this way, though, which is why Sam keeps trying. Dean used to be the life of any party, practically glowing with a magnetism that no one could deny, man or woman. Of course, it didn’t matter that everyone had eyes for Dean because Dean only ever had eyes for Cas.
Tugging on Dean’s fingers, he entices him up the stairs of their loft. “C’mon. Why are you pouting, sweetheart?”
“Always, Dean,” Cas promises in his gravelly timbre. “There’s nothing I want more.” There is sincerity and aching sweetness in his words, and Dean gets lost in his eyes. Cas doesn’t rush him. Needy doesn’t begin to cover how desperate he feels, but this moment is so pure that he doesn’t want to shatter it.
Cas relents and lets himself be pulled in for a gentle kiss. The tongues dance together languidly while Dean winds his arms around his back and neck, reassuring them both with touch.
“Anything. Anything for you,” Dean replies softly. Cas’s heart swells at the promise, the oath in those words. If he hadn’t fallen for Dean months ago, this moment would have made him fall. Dear lord, how he adores this man.
Exasperation pushed aside for the time being, Sam snaps out of it and replies, “Right. Yes, he is. He was somehow pulled into another dimension.”
Dean looks confused, but catches the snappy tone in Cas’s voice. “Nothing. He’s free to live there as long as he wants.”
Cas smiles a beatific smile at Dean’s slack-jawed reaction. He’s touching the lines of Cas’s newest, and most important, tattoo like they are made of the finest gold. To Cas, they might as well be. Of all the art that he could have put over his heart, he’d chosen the most precious of them all - Dean.
Cas hums appreciatively as he palms Dean’s hips, letting him continue working their denim-covered cocks together. “Yes, I know exactly how well you take me, baby. Any chance you’re up for giving me a demonstration?”
As soon as he glances over at Dean, he stops his explanation. Dean obviously recognizes it. He’s staring up at it with a beatific look on his face. Nostalgia is riding him hard, so Cas lets him take a minute to explain.
The supermodel with tall gossamer wings brings him to a cavern that rivals the grandest cathedrals in the world in both height and beauty. Those familiar golden sparkles of light float in the air like animated glitter, mixing with butterflies, tiny little fairies, and flower petals. Their combined movement is mesmerizing, and it takes a great effort to force himself to look away.
Dean runs his tongue along the bottom edge of his teeth, scrutinizing Cas before he comments, “Sweet talker.”
Cas holds a book to mask his interest, but he could be hiding behind a rock for all the attention he’s paying it. He smirks when he hears another volley of English vitriol. A few of the guards flinch at the sound, confusion passing between them. Better them than him. Normally, he adores Dean’s fire, his intensity in almost any form. He’s the only one in the castle that doesn’t shrink from his mercurial moods. But this restless, pent up version of Dean is a little too much even for him.
“Are you kidding me right now? Have you seen you in this outfit?” Dean teases, licking his lips as his eyes coast over Cas from head to toe. “Blistering heat, baby.”
Cas whimpers at the thought, snared by the intense desire to do exactly what Dean is suggesting. He trembles with incendiary need, knowing that Dean is going to win this battle of wills if he keeps talking, speaking to Cas’s every dark desire. Dean’s voice is raw when he continues, “You can fuck me full of your come, Cas, until I can’t take another drop.”
This chapter has a purpose, I swear. It's not just smut for it's own sake. It's foundational and relevant...and full of sex.
“If you weren’t of royal blood, you would be heading to the prison. Unfortunately, you are a prince.” He looks at his younger brother with disgust. “You are confined to your chambers indefinitely. We will talk more before your trial.”
Every time Dean cracks his eyes open; he immediately wants to slip back into his hallucinogenic dreams. They might be incomprehensible nightmares courtesy of the mind-warping drugs they have him on, but they’re infinitely better than his reality.
“I get it. I completely understand. I’d like to do something that I hope might help you understand that I’m not the threat.”
Dean puts his hand on Cas’s, rubbing his thumb over his wrist. “Good. This isn’t bothering you, is it?”
Cas can’t believe that Michael got away from him again. He was following Dean home like he’s been doing for days, only to see the psychotic fuck trail him out of the same train car. Cas always keeps several cars back to avoid detection, but the brazen asshole was walking just a few feet behind Dean. In a panic, Cas tried to push his way closer, but the rush-hour crowd wasn’t having it. He wasn’t able to shorten the gap until after they had exited the station. When he turned the first corner, he saw that Dean was walking much faster, and by the end of the block, he was practically sprinting home. That means that Dean was paying attention to his instincts and could feel the predator approaching. Good.
He kisses back, just as lightly. “I’ve never been happier. If I had known how wonderful living with you could be, I would have stolen you away much sooner.”
Instead, he seems to be handling everything with grace and confidence.  Looking beneath the surface, though, she notices subtle little tells. Cas soaks up every kind word with gratitude, appreciates everything offered to him with genuine amazement.
Cas pushes his thumb into Dean’s mouth, runs it firmly along his tongue. Dean can’t pretend that it isn’t sexy as fuck, especially when his demand is simply, “Suck.”
“She is wise, but in this case, I don’t agree with her. I don’t think she knows you well enough to make this decision.”
Dean looks back at a mirror on the wall. He thinks the mirror is hung in an odd place, but what does he know about art?
When Dean opens the door to his father’s office, he stops short, feeling like he’s been rooked into an intervention. Around the conference table sit at least four uniformed police officers in addition to Detective Walker, the District Attorney, two of the firm’s partners, and a stenographer? A woman with short, brunette hair sits across from Walker; her sharp eyes assessing Dean, searching for any important clues into his psyche. She must be another detective.
Dinner is a resounding hit. Laughter and moans of delight are constant music around the table. Cas had been surprised and very touched that Dean had invited both Claire and Judith to join them. He’d kept it quiet because he didn’t want Cas to freak out ahead of time, but he knew that of all the people in Cas’s life, they were the two that he would want to have there when they made their big announcement.
“Oh, don’t let my teasing fool you. Under the surface, I’m ready to go into their headquarters guns blazing. How fucking dare they chase an omega who’s alone? I don’t care what their reasons were. That’s abhorrent behavior. Besides, I appreciate that you’ve done nothing wrong here. There’s no use taking any of my anger out on the victim.”
When Castiel has worn himself out, he staggers back and lands on his ass. The beast’s head is hanging low and even from the ground, he can’t make eye contact. While he pants at his exertions and cries over his plight, the man - no, creature - walks silently into the cave.
“I think the best one I heard is that you are actually an incubus and have your poor guard under your spell. Apparently, he broke free last night and you two fought until you subdued him.”
“That’s a fucking delicious image, but that’s not all I want. I want to mark you with my come, Dean. I want to push it deep and keep it in there. I want to do it over and over again until I get so much of it in you that it distends your belly.”
Cas lets his mind wander into lascivious territory. What would it feel like to have Dean use those arms to hold him down and take his pleasure? Hmmm...or, hold him up? A wicked grin slides into place. Yes. That would be something exquisite to experience. He bites his bottom lip as the fantasy unfolds. Dean grabs him roughly and slams him up into the wall. Cas wraps his legs tightly around that trim waist and digs his fingers into thick shoulders while Dean fills him. He can almost feel the brutal force of each thrust that those powerful hips could give him. He would probably shake apart from the impact alone.
Dean has kept up his keen interest in christening the islands for weeks, much to Cas’s delight. They started with Australia and New Zealand so that Dean could show Cas the most impressive reef on the planet. Swimming through the Great Barrier Reef had felt like a heavenly dream, and he is looking forward to returning during the spawn in October. While Dean can move through space magically, he is still bound by the laws of time, so he must wait for seasonal events just like everyone else.
