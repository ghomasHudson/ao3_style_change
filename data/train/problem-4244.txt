“Dean,” he whisper yelled as he sprinted towards the man’s back. Dean didn’t even turn around, he was so focused on walking towards Alistair. But someone else noticed. Alistair looked up from where he was helping fight against Castiel’s garrison by lazily throwing knives at whoever strayed within range (and if Castiel were not so focused on catching up to Dean, he would be livid to see Hael and Ezekiel both had been hit, the hilts sticking out of their bodies and blood dribbling down from their wounds). The moment Alistair saw Dean, a strange calm came over him. He even smiled. Dean’s shoulders tensed up, and he reached for a weapon at his side.
“Is now the best time to be having this discussion?” Claire muttered. Benny said nothing at all, but something in him seemed to have relaxed. He knew Cas had made that decision he’d been talking about, and he thought Cas had made the right one. Cas wasn’t so sure.
“Of course she doesn’t,” said Selma with a snort. “Do you think this is the first time this has happened, Cas?”
He picks a hallway at random and starts walking, figuring he’ll find some long forgotten room to search at some point. It doesn’t take him long, actually, to realize Cas is following him. Not much later than that he realizes that he wants Cas to follow him. Wants the steady sound of Cas still breathing, the nearly silent tread of his footsteps right behind him. As long as Dean keeps walking and doesn’t stop, they can be suspended like this. Just out of reach, but together somehow. Like maybe he can keep Cas close if he gets him to play the shadow. Not that he thinks that will work, but it’s something to live in that isn’t anger or loss or crushing disappointment.
If Kaia had less patience for Claire’s infatuation with Jesse Turner, that was neither here nor there. She knew enough not to mention to her friend how much and just why it bothered her.
Or, said a voice in his head. You could go back to them. Tell Naomi everything you know. You don’t have to lose them again.
“You’d be surprised,” said Garth. “He seems all tough, but he’s really a teddy bear. And he’s a lot more in touch with himself than people give him credit for.”
“Yeah,” Charlie said after she had finished jotting down numbers. “So the story starts a long while back. Rowena was a daughter of one of the old king’s servants, and she fell in love with him. They had an affair and Rowena got pregnant with Fergus. The old king didn’t have any kids with his wife yet, and when she found out she put a price on Rowena and Fergus’ head and the king did nothing to stop her. Rowena had to run and I’m betting she started plotting that very day what she was going to do to get back at them. Ten years later, the queen has had seven daughters, but no sons and the old king was pissed. Sexist prick. Anyway, he tried to find Fergus so he could be his heir.”
Trisha shrugged, not giving him an inch. He hadn’t expected her too. He wouldn’t have if their positions were reversed.
“Barely,” answered Dean, at last. “You missed some pretty nifty driving when you passed out. Hurt my feelings.”
“Wouldn’t have time if I were on the run,” he said. He took two amphetamines out of his pocket and swallowed them. They were necessary for his alibi if he was to have driven from Ira to Superbia in a straight shot. “The story is I was stabbed and drove straight here from Ira.”
“Corinthia and Matthew were injured, but they said to tell you they wanted to come,” he said. “Some of the others on call for reinforcements in case of any attacks-“
“I know you’re scared of your father, even though he’s been dead almost half your life,” said Cas, knowing full well how touchy a subject that was. “I know you blame your mother for leaving you with him. I know you resent Sam for writing you off when you were in prison. I know that you’ll give anyone a second chance, even if they don’t deserve it. And I also know that you’re trying to make me angry. I just don’t understand why.”
But changing things on Earth on the other hand. That would be messy and complicated. It would involve danger and compromise and empathy and getting things wrong. It would be close and real, and Castiel knows even now it would involve failures of all kinds. But it would be good work, and someone has to do it. He’s long since known there is more than one way to be a hero.
“He’s not an asshole,” Cas says. “He’s… flighty. And he doesn’t understand… I kept things from him. My deteriorating relationship with my family. Money issues. I didn’t want him to know I was living off of ramen and my postgrad salary. I thought he would think less of me.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Castiel said. He looked down at the file in his hands and passed it to her before trying to determine where to start. He supposed it was best to begin with the key players he had met in camp. “They operate with dual leadership. Billie Barnes is the one who is actually in charge and holds the most power, while a man named Dean Winchester seems to hold more influence over the men and women who are at the camp. His second in command is his brother, Sam, and he also has an expert in technology Charlie Bradbury as his primary adviser. She is, in my opinion, one of the more formidable assets they have. Below these key players are six captains, each of which is directly responsible for a section of the camp. These six are Benny LaFitte, Rufus Turner, Linda Tran, Tamara Winchester, Risa Jones and Gordon Walker. Of these six, Benny and Tamara have most influence. Benny is a close friend of Dean Winchester while Tamara has been married to Sam Winchester for three years. That being said, none of the other four are to be underestimated and all appear well trained in combat and strategy. Every one in camp seems to have some degree of training, though their respective positions were not explained to me. During my time-”
For a moment, bloodied faces swam before his vision. Hael with a bullet wound between her eyes. Susannah and Benjamin with their throats slashed. Balthazar and Hannah fallen and bleeding to death.
Suddenly there are strong arms under his shoulders dragging him deeper into the warehouse, away from the dead djinn. Dean weakly tries to fight back, but he’s dizzy and he’s having trouble keeping things straight. He figures he must have the mother of all concussions (probably not helped with hitting his head on Jody’s first floor bathtub the night before), and it’s all he can do to keep consciousness.
“But I’m kind of glad for it,” Lydia continued. “Because this is who I am, I think. A fighter. I just needed an excuse to see it, and, uh, certain circumstances made that clear to me.”
“That makes me feel… marginally better I guess,” says Charlie. “Chuck just would straightwash me though. Anyway, I’m alive again. So I’m gonna go get really drunk. Any takers for company?”
For the time being, however, Castiel has the day off and evening festivities don’t begin until much later. He has decided to take advantage of this fact by being as far away from everyone as possible.
“I ain’t leaving,” said Dean stubbornly. He sat there with his arms crossed and his breathing steady enough that he could be sleeping, though Cas had a feeling he was not. When he shifted in mild discomfort, slouching further down so his head wasn’t resting on the hard top of the chair, Cas sighed and decided to try again.
Jack mumbled something that was mostly incoherent about how he didn’t care, and why didn’t Gadreel shut up about it anyway. The soldier who had told them to bring Castiel up to Naomi told the both of them to make haste and then disappeared after her other soldiers in search of Jo. Cas hoped he had bought her enough time.
“But it’s nothing compared to the time I spent thinking about…” Cas starts, going silent as he sees Dean’s expression sharpen in concentration. He is giving Dean a lot of ammunition to hurt him. He knows he is. For some reason, he still can’t stop himself from finishing his sentence. “Other things.”
“Well if you two are going to spend all night sulking,” he says, pushing himself out of his chair and leaving the room. This is when Cas remembers. It was the Apocalypse. Cas was falling, Sam had decided to say yes to Lucifer in an attempt to trap him in the cage, Dean had reluctantly agreed, and in the mean time they were all just waiting. Waiting for it all to start, and for it all to end.
Castiel reached into his pocket and pulled out the packet of painkillers Dr. Newman had given him, and then carefully spilled them out onto the table.
“It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” said Dr. Newman. “It’s going to get a lot worse. I remember watching Jessica and Sam go through detox, and with them we had some idea what we were dealing with. We had Cordelia helping come up with drugs to ween them off their dependence. With you… we just don’t know what Naomi gave you.”
Claire’s the one who answers the door when Sam drops off Dean at their doorstep with a broken leg and a bad attitude. Turns out he fell wrong on a ghost hunt and almost bled out while waiting for help. That, coupled with a smaller injury from a vamp hunt gone wrong a few weeks ago means Dean is off active duty until he’s healed enough to not get dead next time he comes face to face with a monster. Claire suspects, though she doesn’t say so out loud, that whatever hunt Sam and Eileen Leahy (who seems to be Sam’s new girlfriend, whenever that happened) are going on is also partly an excuse to get away from Dean’s moping.
Convincing Kelly to come back was a task that was left solely to Cas. She had been suspicious, but as soon as Castiel had explained the plan, she had agreed to go through with it. He’d been a little surprised that she was willing to place herself in danger again so soon, until she explained herself.
Perhaps he had been too old to be effectively integrated into society, Castiel mused. Or too stubborn. Either way, it still seemed odd to Castiel that the two brothers had differed so sharply on their impressions of the state considering the level of faith they seemed to have in each other. Perhaps it was something that had transcended politics, or perhaps Dean had forgiven anything he might have held against his younger brother for believing in the state.
It was quiet as they arrived, and all eyes centered on Dean. No one was paying much attention to Castiel for once, which was a relief. He didn’t know any of the soldiers that they were opposing and none recognized him. He suspected that a great deal of the older and more experienced soldiers would still be reinforcing Superbia at the moment. He tried to scan and pick out which people were likely in charge and would have a say in the negotiations.
“I know,” said Cas. “I know that I’m not special and everyone is hurting and I need to get over myself-“
And now Bobby and Mary are looking just as alarmed as Sam is. Dean’s hurting them, he knows he is. So he shuts his mouth, and stands up and leaves. He’s halfway to the door before Cas rushes after him.
Jo stared at him a moment before swallowing and deciding that it was better not to make it seem like a big deal that Cas had just spoken to one of the kids. She must have figured that Cas would just write off Emma calling her ‘Aunt Jo’ as something all of the kids did.
And with that, Claire marched down the stairs and out the door before Kaia could so much react. When she had gathered herself, she chased after Claire, but at a distance. It wasn't hard to guess where she would go.
Jody rolled her eyes and went back to her drink. Then the both of them realized Castiel was still there.
“We don’t want to end our alliance,” said Billy. “And we don’t want to hurt you. We see a place for you, Dean. You could be a part of building a new world.”
“Then you don’t,” says Dean. “But Jesus Cas, tell me you don’t mean that. Because I think I might love you, and I think you might love me back.”
“Yeah, you have a habit of missing the forest for the trees. Don’t worry, it’s cute most of the time.”
“I had lows, but I never wanted to die. It’s not the same, Cas. You need help, and someone had to say it. Maybe… maybe she was part of why I tried to help you at first, because I suspected you’d lost someone with everything left unresolved, the same way I had. But the way you’re grieving isn’t healthy,” said Selma. “All you do is bury your pain, until you can’t anymore. And you act like no one should care about you.”
“Last big thing before we get into the details,” said Dean. “I’m going to be leading a smaller force into Canada so we can converge on Superbia. Hopefully we’ll be able to convince Cro- his majesty to spare some people to help us out with that. I’m still deciding who’s going to be going, but I will be leaving in the next few days. Jo and Risa, you’re both definitely going. Charlie, same thing. Everyone else will be notified in the coming days.”
“Frank, you’re going to be working with me from here on out,” said Mary. “Kevin and Sarah, you’ll be staying here in Ira. Everyone who used to work under Ash is going to be split up evenly.”
Mary got up to leave, but Castiel stopped her, reaching out quickly enough that her hand flicked to her weapon. Castiel stilled.
“I think you’ll find Castiel did this to himself,” says Billie. Jack’s eyes flash golden, but he doesn’t move against her. Not yet. “He knew the consequences of saving Dean Winchester again, and he chose. He knows what’s waiting for him back here, so he decided not to come back.”
Castiel started when he heard gunshots directly behind him. He spun slowly to see Anna staring at him, her uniform darkening slowly with her blood. She was staring at him.
“Yeah, yeah. What would I do without the two of you,” Bobby muttered sarcastically. Jody rolled her eyes and ordered a drink from Mandy when she came around again. Bobby instead focused in on Dean.
Then she grits her teeth and pushes herself to her feet. She starts to dig him out, ignoring the pain of charred debris searing her palms, making her skin redden and bubble. She is going to find Sam.
“How’s the kid?” Dean asks, following Cas to the room they’d set aside for the bodies. Cas doesn’t answer him. “Look, man…”
“I need to be somewhere,” Cas said, interrupting mind game number twenty seven in which Jo attempted to find out what was “really wrong” with him. She let him go, but Cas wouldn’t be surprised if she followed him. Hopefully, she would get distracted along the way because Cas had a feeling he was about to do something stupid, and he’d rather she not witness it.
“Would you like to buy it?” asked the boy who was standing by the stall. He looked to be in his early twenties, not much older than Dean. He was about Dean’s height, dark-haired, strong and pensive looking. His eyes were such a bright shade of blue, Dean wondered if he had eaten some of the spices from the stall down the street. He knew enough of the Lebanon fair not to actually ask.
Why on Earth would he say that out loud? In all honesty, Cas couldn’t begin to imagine what had possessed him to admit it. He wondered if he would shoot his own foot off as long as he got the last word. He strongly suspected the answer to that was also yes.
“Amelia and Jimmy,” Chuck continued. “And then there’s Amara and Claire. Our sisters. Claire’s been one of the guards on your door the past few days. She’s the baby of the family.”
“Get used to it,” she mutters to herself. Chuck betrayed her twice. It hurts worse the second time as it turns out. Not that she’ll ever give him the satisfaction of knowing that.
“That poor woman deserves better, but that’s not ours to give her right now. I need our safety secured. We’ve lost good people this past week, and we were going to lose more,” said Mary. “We had a plan in place to get her back eventually from Azazel, after we had taken out as many of his methods of retaliating as we could.”
Cas didn’t say anything, just listened as Dean got a faraway look about him. The walls seemed to slip from around Dean, and in front of him wasn’t Dean the leader or Dean the general’s son or even Dean the man who stared the world down with a grin. The smile even slipped from his face as he spoke.
“Knock yourself out,” said Kaia, whirling her staff a moment. It’s an effective threat. She slammed one end hard down on the ground.
“I know about the children,” said Castiel. “They were the state’s. We were the ones experimenting on them and you demanded we kill them because of your mistakes. You-“
“Whole lotta wrath,” says Chuck, looking at Dean as he says it. A bad feeling starts to well in the pit of Sam’s stomach. Dean’s expression doesn’t change, he just stares back steadily at Chuck. Like he’s daring him to say it out loud. “I mean you think I was bad-”
“We follow them,” said Cas. This was enough direction to kickstart the hyper-competent soldier who had led them through the desert to Libidine. Claire took Cas’ hand and they weaved through the crowd after Dean and the others, always far enough behind to be spared from notice.
Once maybe, but not anymore. Castiel didn’t voice this out loud, not doing a thing to course correct Naomi. He might be killed for his supposed betrayal of her, but she still wouldn’t question that Emma was dead. That would have to be enough, Castiel supposed, thinking guiltily of the kit taped to his back that would never reach Harriet if he were to die now.
Cas nodded, and tried to lift his arm to scratch an itch on his nose only to once again tug against something. He looked down to see he was handcuffed to what looked to be a cot. He frowned up at Dr. Newman.
“Good. I’m glad to hear,” Rosali said back. Jason was at a loss for words for a moment, then retreated to where Benny, Wendy, Garth, and Betty were having a spirited discussion. He looked like a dog that had just been kicked, and very pointedly didn’t look back in Rosali’s direction. Rosali sighed. “Men need to get better at reading nonverbal cues.”
“Thank you,” she said. “For telling Jo to get out. I’m sorry about what happened to you, but that girl’s my daughter and if anything had-”
“I don’t know,” says Dean. “I have no fucking clue, okay? Jesus, between you and Sam, I’m gonna have a midlife crisis ahead of schedule. You want me to think about the future, well I didn’t have one for most of my life. And when I did, I wasn’t even happy about it, I was just trying to get through another day so I could say I’d done it. But I always knew I’d die early and I’d die bloody, so I didn’t make fucking plans. That wasn’t for me. You- You all know what you want, well that’s great. I don’t.”
It wasn’t a long time before he woke again, but he kept his eyes closed. He was bone tired and he didn’t want to move just yet. He heard a voice and vaguely realized that it was Dean’s.
“Are we done here?” Kali asked. Naomi nodded, and Kali left unceremoniously, her men trailing behind her. Castiel spent the seconds it took her to leave wishing for a series of unpleasant and mostly violent things on her and Gabriel within his head. Once the elevator doors had closed behind her, he was forced to once again think about where he was and what he could possibly do to get out of it.
“Do you know the rules, dear?” Harriet asked. Castiel nodded to her and looked down at Jess’ hand. It wasn’t a good one and he had no doubt everyone knew that considering she was so eager to pass it off to him. He folded immediately, and waited out until the next round, taking advantage of the time to examine the other players. Balthazar had always been good at picking out tells, but had the unfortunate habit of informing the other members of their garrison what their tells were so they could compensate for them. Castiel was less skilled when it came to subtle shifts in expression, and knew he wouldn’t be defeating anyone by waiting for a jaw to clench or a muscle to relax. Instead, he tried to get a sense of what everyone wanted out of the game.
She drove off before he could answer her. Castiel looked up to where he imagined Anna was probably watching him from. He wondered what she would think of him, attempting this charade. That he was out of his depth, probably. Then again, if she was looking down, it was likely only to make sure he kept his promise to try to stay alive.
“You have my word,” Mary said. “On one condition: you don’t use Dean to weasel your way out. When the time comes, you put your head down and accept what’s coming to you.”
Claire figures this is her cue to enter the fray. Just as the crocotta turns again to hold off Cas, Claire takes a stab at him. She misses the crocotta’s spine by a mile, but slices him up shoulder to hip, and even if it won’t kill him, it seems to hurt. Kaia takes advantage of Claire’s distraction to swipe the crocotta’s feet out from under him with her staff. Unfortunately, the crocotta gets a handful of Cas’ coat and manages to take Cas down with him. Unbalanced by the fall, Cas loses hold of his blade, sending it clattering across the floor. Mr. Jones stoops to pick it up, a gun in his other hand with the safety still on. Claire doesn’t like his odds of shooting straight with all of them fighting in such close quarters. Mr. Jones seems to think the same, because he holsters his gun as he runs in to help.
“What are those from?” he asked frowning. Dean paused a moment, pulling his new shirt over his head before answering.
“Okay,” Selma agreed. “Just ask around, and someone will point you in our direction when you’re ready to play.”
Unfortunately for him, Balthazar was very used to him attempting to sneak away from crowds. He’d hardly gone a block before his friend was beside him, chattering on about something or other as though they had been walking together all along.
“Not yet,” Castiel said. “As I said, they don’t trust me. I’m kept at arm’s length, and Charlie is careful not to share any details she thinks I could use against them.”
“See if Eileen and I can get anything else out of Chuck? Sounds like a plan,” says Sam. Dean nods and is about to leave, when Sam suddenly freezes and aims another horrorstruck look in his direction. “Oh my god.”
Both Ash and Charlie looked disappointed by his answer, and Castiel didn’t quite miss Charlie saying under her breath something along the lines of wishing he would have just picked a damn side. Hers specifically.
“I stand corrected. You’re dumb as a rock,” said Gabriel. “Right and wrong stopped mattering a long time ago. At this point, it’s us vs. them, and if you want to be moral about it you keep your head down.”
“You really haven’t fucked him yet?” she said. “It really, really isn’t that hard. He’s into you, and he thinks sex is like God’s gift to mankind. You could just try not being an asshole for five seconds.”
“You don’t know everything about me,” she said. The two cousins exchanged concerned looks at this news.
“He was sixteen,” said Castiel. “And in training. I doubt he was even armed. And if you hadn’t tried to interfere I might’ve had time to…”
Claire’s receipt prints from the machine (a minor and somewhat annoying miracle), so she takes it and stuffs it in her pocket. She takes a final deep breath and then walks around the car back to the driver’s seat. She hears the door slam as Dean gets back in on his side. She slides in a few seconds later. Patience is awake now.
Cas reached out for Dean, hooking a hand behind his neck. He kissed the corner of Dean’s mouth, and then again on the lips. Softly, quickly. He’d learned that this was a language Dean responded to, even if it wasn’t one Cas was fluent in. Dean kissed back, pressing Cas back into the side of the car like he couldn’t get close enough.
Charlie trailed off, and suddenly she was hugging Cas. Cas hesitated to hug her back, but when she didn’t appear to be stopping, he did.
“Would you like to sit with me?” Selma repeated, undeterred. She waited as Castiel sized up her intention and smiled again when he nodded slightly.
Instead, Cas stood at the peak of a mountain. Below him stretched forests and fields, endless beauty in ever varying shades of goldens and greens and browns and yellows and blues. He wondered if this was how God must feel, the distance providing a strangely profound understanding that inspecting a single blade of grass could never supply. Cas could imagine the world was peaceful from here. That he had no right to affect it, to shape it, to even touch it.
Castiel ignored the glares he got as he walked past the kids, but he made sure to walk slowly and not in any way acknowledge that he saw them. He wouldn’t be surprised if the only rumor that had managed to spread about him here was that he was ordered to shoot children once.
“Then a lump of fur sat in your lap,” Charlie said, smiling wide. “Your tough guy persona is dying a horrible death as we speak.”
“This isn’t me, stopping time. It’s Death. Jack reinstated Billie, and I wouldn’t even be here if she hadn’t told me that you were about to… well. Die. I’m not supposed to save you. I’m not even supposed to be near you anymore after what happened last time. Billie is testing me, giving me the chance to make things right with you, offer you a peaceful passing,” says Cas. Dean stares at him. “Which I don’t intend to.”
“I don’t even know what I’m thinking half the time. Kinda doubt you know how to navigate my head better than I do,” says Dean. “And trust me when I say I’m real good at seeing things the way I need to see them to get through another day. Maybe I just figured I’d let myself want what I knew I could get, and hell even that seemed like I was stretching. I didn’t even know what you saw in me that was so worth coming back for, but it didn’t matter as long as you did.”
Cas lies on his stomach, in the gravel. His shirt and jeans will be stained with it, but he pays that no mind. Instead he curls his toes beneath his feet, and tenses his hands under him, ready to move quickly. It’s no small thing to catch a cat. Especially one that has evaded capture on all previous attempts.
“Yeah, alright,” she says, the words coming out strained and vicious. Patience can tell she’s upset, but she’s not sure how to help. So the three of them just sit in silence.
“Alright,” she said to Dean’s astonishment. She left to give her payment, and Dean stood there, absolutely stunned. He had somehow just managed to get himself engaged to Jo Harvelle. He should be happy. Why wasn’t he happy?
It drains Sam to say it, Dean can tell. And great, now Dean feels bad for feeling conflicted. For not, if nothing else, appreciating that Cas had died happy because the stupid asshole loved him. As if Dean should feel sorry that he would rather have Cas alive and miserable and there at his side, and not just gone. He doesn’t want Cas’ sacrifice, he wants to watch old westerns with him, and make fun of him for being a dork, and know that he has someone he can count on to have his back no matter what.
“Sixteen hours,” said Charlie. “We have papers for emergency use only. It’s how we got here so quickly.”
“You all are very passionate about people who don’t exist,” Castiel muttered, looking down at his drink and feeling awkwardly left out. Three sets of eyes were on him instantly and he wished he’d kept his mouth shut.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sam asks, cutting in before Dean can say anything. Which is probably good, because Dean was thinking about letting his fists do the talking. “Rewrite?”
“We tried to get her back,” continued Tamara. “But every path went cold. And after seven years had passed, we knew we wouldn’t even recognize her if we did find her. So Isaac went to Libidine and I stayed in Ira, because after that long missing her we couldn't stand to look at each other anymore.”
“Yeah and guess how I figured that out?” Dean asks. “I knew after a while that I was probably talking to a guy. If you get comfortable enough with a girl, they start telling you things, like… like they’re on their period, or their bra sucks, or they bought a new lipstick that’s bright blue for the hell of it. Victor was too busy trying to figure me out to do any of that shit. I didn’t know for sure either way, but I didn’t stop messaging him. In the abstract like that, it seemed… fine. Being with a guy. And then it started seeming less abstract, but I was still okay with it.”
“Yes,” he said. The moment he had decided he was running to the edge of the roof and quickly scaling the building. He stopped at each person he saw, most of whom were sobbing over illusions. It was a process to convince them of reality, and one woman had reacted so violently to Castiel trying to convince her that her child hadn’t died before her eyes that he was forced to restrain her. To anyone he could cajole into a lucid state he gave a set of instructions: Convince everyone about the hallucinations. Restrain outliers and move them to a safe location. A man and a woman Castiel had never met had already helped to do so with the woman who had reacted violently to him.
“No,” said Cas, watching as the worried look deepened, the edges of Dean’s mouth pulling down into a frown. “You don’t need to worry. My eating habits won’t get in the way of you using me to take over Superbia.”
“She wishes you’d visit more,” Kaia says, breaking into Cas’ thoughts. “She wouldn’t ever tell you that, but she does.”
They play board games all night, until Cas is dozing off on Dean’s shoulder, and Charlie and Dean keep failing to get a decisive victory in the game of poker they decided to start.
Newman laughed a little at her, but at her familiar little stubborn frown straightened his expression within a second.
It is reassuring to see Dean breathing evenly, his face lax in sleep. It will be painful for him to wake up, despite the painkillers in his system. It is much simpler, for the moment, for him to be unconscious. This way, Cas can drink in the sight of him, can let himself be relieved and concerned and incredibly angry in equal measure without any emotion having to cancel out the others. The fact that Dean is breathing is keeping him in equilibrium.
They were led to the center of the city, and Azazel’s headquarters in relative silence. The streets were much deader than usual, and anyone who saw them got out of their way without hassling them or even acknowledging them. Castiel had a feeling getting out wouldn’t be anywhere near this easy.
“Sorry,” Ambriel said, eyes glued to her computer. “There’s an issue in Libidine that she needs to be on top of right now. She will be with you within an hour. If you want, I can call you back if you’re… uncomfortable.”
“Looks like, huh. Still doesn’t stick. I guess the warranty hasn’t run out yet,” Dean says, gesturing towards himself. His body, his meatsuit, his vessel, whatever you wanna call it. Claire doesn’t smile, and why would she? She knows what he really means. One of the few who could.
“No,” he said shortly. He had in fact spent a long time now very purposefully not thinking about Anna, and he planned to continue to do so as long as possible. Not that it stopped the dreams of her dying, which were almost always fragmented and violent now. Sometimes the dreams went off script and Castiel managed to shoot himself before Anna could stop him.
To stop himself from texting Sam to get him the hell out of here (and doing the equivalent of being a teenage girl at a sleepover begging to be picked up), Dean shoves this feeling down and gets quiet for the rest of dinner. He flashes a smile every once in a while, but tunes out Alex and Patience snarking back and forth about who was supposed to clean up the latest monster dissection in the garage. He also pointedly ignores the occasional looks he gets from Claire, who is uncharacteristically silent all through dinner, only really talking to Kaia and Wendy. She jumps in to side with Patience against Alex in some dispute or other and then goes back to quietly picking at her food and paying too much attention to Dean.
“Okay,” Castiel answered. Risa joined in on the game, and they spent several hours switching through poker, gin rummy, and several other games Cas had never heard of before and ended up losing very badly in. All the while, Cas made frequent use of Jo’s flask until his very identity started slipping pleasantly away from him.
It all happens so fast, Sam has almost forgotten he might be saying goodbye. Again. He feels for a second that long stretch of life ahead of him if Dean doesn’t make it. All that time knowing if he’d come up with a different plan, if he’d pushed back on this one maybe-
“How did we know what to do after you guys had us all gassed?” Dean pointed out. “Cas here was a big help with that one. He told us all about Sweet Dreams.”
Gadreel and Jack stopped arguing well ahead of when they might have been heard by Naomi’s guards. They handed Castiel over quietly, and then went off to return to their positions elsewhere. Castiel hadn’t realized that Gadreel had managed to put him at ease slightly until he was gone and Cas was surrounded by hostile faces again.
Other areas around the city hadn’t been as lucky, and word came in from both Risa and Rufus that there had been minor skirmishes in the rural areas that they were defending, and that there had been a few casualties, but though only locals had died. That hadn’t gone over well with the people of Sanctus, some of whom seemed to be thinking along the lines that Castiel was: if the resistance hadn’t come in, their people might not be at risk.
“He is good looking,” Balthazar said when they wandered toward the mostly empty dining hall and he saw Dean sitting there with Jo and Benny, clearly having a serious discussion with the both of them. Benny must have traveled from Ira, Cas thought to himself. He doubted the man had entirely recovered from his bullet wound yet, but with Jo having abandoned her post…
“Does being an asshole make you feel better?” Dean asked, obviously trying to keep himself from lashing out in a similar fashion at Cas.
Of course, Cas knew Dean cared about him. He knew Dean loved him. He just had not really thought it was quite to that extent. Or anywhere near close, really. Because when it came down to it, what about Cas was all that worth loving?
Dean didn’t seem to be surprised that Charlie wanted him there. He seemed a little frustrated Charlie had woken up so soon, but the moment he was at Charlie’s side he pulled her to his chest and hugged her, patting the back of her head while keeping a rather stoic expression himself.
“Nuh uh. Fuck that,” said Dean. “I’m not going to let anything happen to you. No one’s going to touch you.”
It occurs to Cas as he considers this statement, that Kaia has not turned to look at him. In fact, he’s very certain she hasn’t looked at him once since she started painting sigils.
“No,” Castiel repeated, already knowing from the hangover he had two days ago that drinking six shots in a row, while impressive, was not a trick he could do twice in one week.
By the time he had somewhat averted another panic attack, he had been carried into an elevator with a familiar pair of shoes walking in with them. Castiel struggled to look up and saw Kali’s grim face looking back at him.
It all came down to one thing. Whatever misgivings Castiel had about the future, he now knew that the past was indefensible. The current abuse of power could not stand, and he would not fight to ensure the status quo.
“Perhaps you shouldn’t drink so much so fast,” Selma told him, when he handed the cup back to Jo a third time, who raised her eyebrows and poured significantly less inside this time.
“Trade?” Castiel asked, having not thought about exactly how the camps kept running before. Charlie nodded.
“But it will give us time to fix it that we don’t have if we keep letting Heaven expand like this. There are barely any angels holding it together anymore, and if I try to make more-”
“Alright,” Dean said to the assembled throng, drawing their attention away from hating Castiel. “Clear a path for Benny to get to the door. He’s our best chance of getting out of here. In the meantime, stay low to the ground and as far from the fire as you can. Use whatever you can to cover your mouth as a filter, and whatever you do, don’t panic.”
“Walk me back to my tent,” Jo said, and Castiel agreed, glad when Jo set the bottle down. He would rather the stuff go to waste than Jo drink the whole of it. They went, and something about Jo seemed to be filled to the brim with a kind of nervous energy. When they reached the entrance of her tent, instead of Castiel going on his way, Jo pushed him inside.
“Coke,” Kaia says over her shoulder. She finishes drawing the sigil she’s on and moves on to the next spot Castiel marked down. “Make it two.”
“Aside from an archangel?” Rowena muttered. “What do you think? Fate. You’re the one who kills me, Samuel. I suppose it was a nice thought that this would be the reason why.”
“Riddle me this, then,” said Meg at last. “If everything’s ‘fine,’ why do you act like everything’s shit?”
“If it means I get to stop the infernal noises coming out of your stereo, then yes,” said Cas. “In general, I don’t mind one way or the other.”
There was only one or two days left until they reached Guttur, and Castiel couldn’t be happier. To say he was sick of the time he was spending cooped up in the car would be an understatement.
“No. Dean is many things. An angel is not one of them,” said Cas, smiling softly to himself for a moment, before remembering where he was and that he may never see Dean again, if these people had their way.
“And to those forces that would invade the city,” said Naomi next. “I have in my possession two high profile hostages. Castiel and Jo Harvelle. As I understand it, Dean Winchester and Ellen Harvelle have more than enough motive to spare these two lives. I want to be clear: the only way both of them are getting out alive is if I have a total surrender by resistance forces within forty eight hours. After that I will kill one of the hostages. If no surrender has been offered within an additional twenty four hours, both of them will be dead.”
“You’re actually fucking killing me, you know that?” Dean said straight faced. Cas smiled at him, and Dean cracked, grinning back. “Fuck off, alright? You’re gonna be okay, Cas. I’m gonna see to it.”
“Okay, Cas,” says Dean, and keeps his voice soft. Soft enough that if Cas were anyone else he might have to strain to hear. As it is, Cas just looks startled. And alarmed as Dean takes a step forward, a step towards him. “But you owe it to me to say my piece. You know that.”
Michael reaches for the bread bowl and starts picking apart a roll, eating a bite every once in a while. Or Adam does. Amara isn’t sure.
“You’re Amara,” says Patience. She’s not sure there’s some kind of protocol for meeting a primordial being, but if there is she’s failing at it. Mostly she just expected… more. This woman could be someone she saw at the grocery store. Not exactly oozing with chaotic grace and unchecked anger. Or anything you might expect from God’s equal and opposite…
Garth sounded less than impressed with these observations when Cas brought them up in their nightly therapy session. Cas had wanted them to be weekly, but with Balthazar being allowed to come along (and over Mary’s objections) he hadn’t wanted to push his luck.
“Jody and the others will be returning to their cities at the end of the week. I’ll go with her, and then back to Superbia for an official update with Naomi. You said it yourself, you don’t always have the medication to deal with serious illnesses. It would be more than believable that Emma died of something.”
But Dean’s hand was familiar and comforting, and for the moment all his missing finger meant was that Cas had survived something terrible. But because he was alive, Dean could hold his hand. How wonderful and ordinary that was. How easily taken for granted.
“I don’t know what I want,” said Cas, eyes already closing again as he started to sink back into his nightmares.
A good translation. To the point, and without politics. Castiel has always appreciated when humans got the words right.
“I’ll talk to him later,” Sam says to Cas, who glares in the general direction of the door instead of acknowledging this. For now, Sam takes Eileen’s hand and the two of them look at each other. “I think we all need time to think. About what we’re going to do.”
That night he dreamed, sometimes, of loving Dean. Of reality through a fogged lens, dreamlike in its nature rather than its content. But more often he dreamed of that other Dean, the one he’d yet to meet. The one that killed a half dozen men out of sheer desperation. In these dreams, Dean does not hesitate before plunging a blade through Castiel’s chest.
After Selma left with the twins and Benny to go about whatever business they had on schedule for the afternoon, Lydia and Jo took time out to make sure Castiel was up to the apparently arduous task of shopping for supplies.
“I don’t know anything in your field,” he said at last. “I just wanted to ask how Crookshanks was doing.”
“I could carry him out,” Cas offered a second later, making Benny’s face twist in indignation. “It would be the least I could do.”
“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t speak about me like I’m not in the room, Dean Winchester,” said Castiel. Dean’s head snapped from his mother to look at Cas.
“All of you are fired,” said Dean. This caused no shortage of general complaints (Jack was especially certain he couldn’t be fired, since he hadn’t done anything wrong) and Dean responded to it all by turning up his CDs as loud as they could go. This only lasted the five minutes before Guttur was in sight. “Quit your whining, it’s going off. Alright, everyone remembers what they’re supposed to be doing?”
“You,” said Cas at last. “I shouldn’t have to choose, but I’d pick you. Every time. Even when it’s the wrong decision. I’m surprised you’ve yet to notice, considering how smart you are. Being intentionally obtuse is quite the talent.”
“I want you to call them up and have them tell us anything we need to know,” said Dean. “Like what kind of weapons they’re willing to use, where they’re stationed, what’s been weakened since Zachariah moved his forces in-“
“Okay fine,” says Dean. “I’ll be so damn happy I can’t think straight. I’ll even mean it, just… Cas, please tell me I’m not the thing that kills you. Promise me that much at least.”
Dean’s expression was haunted. Cas wished he knew a way to soothe away the memories. Make them fade into something hazy and forgotten.
“Were?” Sam asks. Neither Amara nor Chuck looks at him, too busy glaring daggers at each other. Eileen is about as confused as he is, and well that makes sense. Not like he’s gone into much detail with her about how the end of the world went down. Claire and Patience likewise seem to be mostly out of the loop. Considering they’re trusting Patience to get them out of whatever is about to happen, this is a little concerning.
He practically gasps out loud when one of the eggs rolls onto the snow. It cuts to commercial break right after and Cas turns to look at Dean, his brow creased with worry. Somehow, all of this put together is so strangely and specifically attractive to Dean, that before Cas can chatter on and on about whether or not the baby penguin is okay, Dean is dragging Cas down underneath him.
“What?” Dean says at last. He’s pretty sure this is Michael and not his estranged half brother, right now. Mostly sure. It’s not like he knew Adam for that long though.
It’s as close to an admission as Rowena is going to get. At this point, she may have earned his trust, but that’s something hard to give in the best of circumstances. But this…
“Alicia, Max,” the young woman said, hurrying towards them with an expression of sheer relief. “Where’s Krissy? She didn’t get herself sent to max lock up trying to escape again, did she?”
“Evacuate? Where are they supposed to go? Earth? The Empty?” she asks. “We might as well try to make Jack explode again. It’ll be faster for all of us. Humans aren’t quiet by nature. It’s why Heaven had to pacify them in the first place. Humans tend towards wanting to live, and the Empty will find a way to get out eventually. It could swallow us, just to be spiteful.”
“It makes me feel sad in a way I can understand,” explained Castiel. “It puts words to grief. A Heavenly Hurt that leaves no scar. Just because you don’t think I’m hurting doesn’t mean I’m not, Trisha.”
“This ain’t about trust. This is about the fact you don’t want to be around and I don’t know how to fix it. Hell, I don’t think I can. What I can do is not make it worse. And helping take down Superbia is going to make it worse. There’s going to be casualties Cas, no matter what happens and I am not letting you take responsibility for them. The decision’s out of your hands,” said Dean. “Nothing you can do about it.”
“Wow, I don’t even count?” mutters a still blind-folded Dean, which makes Claire wonder how the hell he knows Cas is even there. She sets the thought aside when the crocotta stomps down on Dean’s cast, cracking it open. Dean lets out a surprised shout of pain, and Claire cringes as she watches him double over with his arms still tied behind him as he tries to heave up bile onto the floor. She doesn’t have to look at Cas to know he’s furious. Claire’s pretty sure the chances of this crocotta leaving the room alive just dropped below single digits, percentage wise. Then again, not like she’s sat through enough school to check that math.
“Uh, Charlie,” he says. Dean just looks at him. “I thought about… I thought about what Billie said. About trying to change for the better and- I’m not sorry we saved you from the Mark. But I am sorry about everything else and- And why not? If we can right a few wrongs and get off Death’s bad side while we’re at it-”
“It’s warm,” said Castiel as he sat down in front of her. He held his breath, hoping she wouldn’t ask him to take it off. She wrinkled her nose in distaste, but went back to skimming the report. When she was done, she set the papers down and looked at him.
“You mean besides Heaven tearing itself in two?” asks Dean. His voice sounds off, and Sam doesn’t blame him. If the other foot was gonna drop, it would be now. Charlie shrugs. “Seriously? There’s more?”
“Spoken like a true brainwashed robot,” Charlie said, sounding disappointed. “C’mon Cas. You’re don’t have to be Mr. Soldier anymore. At least not when you’re with us. Break a few rules. Rebel a little.”
“Jo. Like you said, older girl, good with guns,” said Rosali with a smile. “The poor kid didn’t stand a chance. Luckily, he’s smart enough to know she wouldn’t want to date an eighteen year old.”
“Truth is, kid, I didn’t know how to deal with you. I didn’t ask for that kind of responsibility, and my whole life I’ve had to take care of other people. I always had to put someone else first and… I couldn’t do it anymore. And that’s not fair to you, I know that. Because you didn’t ask to get stuck with me and Sam either. But I still couldn’t do it, and I’m sorry you didn’t have someone better. If it had just been Cas, if he’d always been there, you could’ve-”
Dean doesn’t usually bother to answer his phone. The only person who calls him that he likes talking to is Sam, and they still aren’t speaking. Dean has debated over and over again being the one to pick up the phone and end their fight, but he never does. In general, this means he tends to assume it’s a telemarketer or some other nonsense on the other end of the line, and figures they’ll leave a voicemail if its important.
“It’s not quite like that,” Castiel corrected softly. “There are people I can… It isn’t cut and dry, is what I am trying to say. And Dean is…”
“It’s easier to do that now,” he says. “When he can’t- It’s easier this way. Like in a way he died in that fire with mom, he just did. I don’t think he had any idea what he was going to do after he got his revenge. I don’t think he planned for it. I mean twenty or so years on and he thinks me and Sam are gonna what? Move on with our lives? But he died for me, y’know? Died so I got to live, even if I did a piss poor job of it. So he cared, right? But it’s just easier if he’s not- If he’s-”
It’s past midnight, and Cas can hear the sounds of water running as the girls go through their evening routines. They will be sleeping soon. He envies them that, wishing he too could escape for a while from the waking world. Instead he will simply sit with his thoughts, as usual. Funny that it had not bothered him in Heaven the way it does now. Humanity is catching, he supposes. It brings with it all sorts of little jealousies.
“Wait,” Jo called after him. “Could ya… Could ya stay? Not like… I just don’t want to be alone right now.”
“That’s true,” says Cas. Dean deflates. Part of him doesn’t want Cas to give in so easy. To give up. Because Dean means it, if it keeps Cas safe he’ll cut himself out to do it. Not that he wants to, but he will. Cas clears his throat, not looking at Dean now. “I’ve been thinking.”
At that thought, he does feel his eyes start to water a little, but they’re long since dry by the time he gets to Sam and Jack.
“Nah,” said Charlie. “We need his minions thinking you and Dean are happily together. The two of you missing breakfast was a good idea. I’m sure they all think you two were, uh, celebrating your engagement.”
“You kids alright back there?” asked Allen cautiously. Part joke, part actual worry, considering Castiel wasn’t that much younger than he was.
“I’m not mad at you for getting your butt tortured, okay?” Charlie whisper yelled. “Oh god. I don’t want to do this.”
Castiel didn’t tell her she was probably right. His own mother and father were only a hazy memory, and not one he tended to dwell on. His family was his garrison, and whoever Tamara’s daughter had been, Cas now knew that the state would have shaped her into exactly what it needed. Who was hurt in the process was less than a concern for them.
It wasn’t a long walk back to the motel, but Dean felt more unsteady on his feet the closer they got. Maybe he wasn’t drunk, but he was addled on despair, and whatever strength he’d relied on to keep him on his own two feet all his life was finally failing him.
And that’s when it all fell into place. Dean almost laughed as the monster continued his fucking monologue.
“Why would something be wrong?” Dean asked, looking genuinely confused. But underneath it was a kernel of guilt, and Cas knew he was on the right track. Something was wrong, and Dean had not realized Cas had picked up on it. Dean caught the look Cas was giving him. “It’s nothing.”
“Yes. I wanted to renegotiate the terms of our mission. See, I agreed to only one soldier accompanying me before your mother threatened me. Now I feel unsafe.”
“Yeah. That is the new policy, huh,” says Ash, sounding faintly disappointed. “Didn’t really think it was your style, though.”
It takes a moment for these words to register on everyone in the room. When they do, a lot of people start talking at once. Castiel immediately demands to know if Jack is alright, while Claire and Patience mutter between themselves about who the fuck God is then, and even Eileen signs a question at Sam about whether this is related to the whole world ending thing that Patience told Dean about. Dean doesn’t say anything though, just looks more and more certain of something.
“To be fair, Dean deserved that,” said a familiar and very welcome voice. Jo pushed her bowl of soup down next to Benny’s and plopped herself down in the seat, leaving only one chair at the table empty. “He was pretty much baiting Cas here. Ain’t that right?”
“Essentially,” Castiel confirmed. Gabriel raised an eyebrow. “I have Charlie sending in updates to Naomi from a personal device she gave me, with intentionally suspicious content. They likely already suspect I’ve been discovered, but if the knife wound is too fresh, it will raise questions.”
Gordon was a few seats away, which made it hard to ignore him. Cas had taken his seat next to Jo, and she and Rufus were the only two people acting as a buffer from Gordon’s malevolent glare. Castiel did the equivalent of a mental shrug and turned to look to his right, where Risa, Linda, and Tamara were sitting. Risa and Tamara were paying attention, if only superficially, but Linda looked bored to tears and was openly knitting a hat. She caught Cas looking at her.
So she schedules family dinners, and is surprised as Kelly starts to thaw towards her. Michael, likewise, is slightly less self righteous every time they meet, until he has conversations with Jack without having to have his ear talked off for half the meal. Even Adam seems… at least entertained by the tradition. It’s nice, sometimes.
It’s at this point where he wonders if he should move. He can feel the hum of the engine under him, so someone is driving. Chances are it’s either Dean or Eileen. He doesn’t hear anything besides the muted sound of wind and other cars whipping by and his own breathing, but that doesn’t necessarily mean anything. He doubts Dean would be wearing out his cassettes if he thinks his younger brother is dead again, thank you very much. In fact, both of them could be there and wouldn’t really be talking to each other if Eileen is tired and not up for the focus it takes to read lips. He doesn’t really want whoever is driving to run the car off the road because they catch sight of him alive and well in the rearview mirror. Then again, if Dean is the one driving this is his chance to let them both know he’s okay without Dean shooting him on reflex.
“How am I supposed to know?” asks Dean, his brow still furrowed like he’s trying to figure this all out. “I don’t… I mean, did I do that to you? I know I tried to hook you up with a girl a few times over the years but that was just because I figured… You only had sex the one time. When you were human.”
Castiel did not know Rosali very well, aside from knowing she was an excellent marksman and that Rufus had pitched a fit when Dean had swiped her from him. Rufus and Linda were staying in Ira under Sam’s command, while Tamara and Gordon were going to be under Mary’s command and were preparing to head out to Invidia within the week.
They ended up being directed toward an underground area to park by a woman with dark brown hair twisted in a bun. She walked down the tunnel as they drove and directed them to a space, then knocked on the window.
“You did this on purpose?” Claire demanded. Calmly, Dean nodded. He stood and gently led Claire to the chair in front of one of the mugs of coffee.
“The point is you don’t actually want to be with me. I’m not enough. Not as a friend, not as whatever you thought you wanted with me. And deep down you know that, otherwise you would have come back. So I’m sorry for all the times before that- that I made you stick around. Because you coulda had the real thing if I’d let you go a long time ago.”
“Then I repeat my first point. I’m going whether you say I can or not. If you want to stop me, you’ll need to lock me up. You have over a dozen soldiers willing to fight for your cause because they respect me and my opinion. They will abandon you the second I’m behind bars.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean can see Jack getting closer. He looks down at Dean with no expression at all on his face. Then he sits next to him and reaches out one hand. Dean takes it, thinking nothing of it until Jack’s hand starts to glow in his. There’s a little spark of energy, but it quickly fades to nothing, exhausted. Jack’s face falls.
It was early evening when Castiel arrived in Ira. He brushed aside hellos from the people he knew and only stopped to ask a passing Ash if he happened to know where Dean was. Ash smirked at him and indicated the general direction he should go in, saying he’d last seen him heading towards the conference rooms that Mary used for strategy meetings (he also indicated he was skipping said meeting, but Castiel quickly discarded that information as irrelevant). As soon as Castiel heard this he was walking again, planning how best to fulfill his orders.
“If I was going to do that, I wouldn’t be telling you, would I?” Billie says. “I didn’t consider it. Hell’s a battery, same as Heaven. I think it’s about time someone cut the power lines. To Heaven, to Hell, to Purgatory…”
“You do what’s right,” said Jack. “That’s the only thing I know about you. Even when it hurts you, you do what’s right. You saved my life, and that’s why you got caught when you were on the run. You could have gotten away, but you didn’t want anyone to die.”
“Thank God for small favors,” said Dean. “Garth, you make sure you’ve got Benny’s back since he’s gonna be distracted watching mine. Cas-“
“Today is going to suck major balls, isn’t it?” she said sadly. Cas nodded grimly at her, and the two walked toward the door as though they were on their way to an execution.
“You asked to change our terms once already,” said Azazel. “My turn. Do as I say or face the consequences.”
“No, I don’t think I can do better,” said Cas, finding the idea almost laughable. Dean had fit himself easily into Castiel’s concept of ideal, without even trying maybe. Doing better would mean reorganizing his sense of the world once again, and Castiel was tired of shifting his perspectives. Perhaps it wasn’t the best choice, letting one person be the center of your world. It had certainly failed Castiel before, but he suspected it was just the way he was wired. “And yes, you would hold it against me.”
“Ah yes. Jo,” Castiel said, deciding to steer the conversation firmly away from the direction he was sure Dean was going to take it. “I am curious why you are so adamant not to promote her.”
“I wasn’t,” said Cas. “It doesn’t have to mean anything, Dean. I’d just rather you were comfortable.”
“If one were to be uncharitable, they might interpret it that way,” he said. The images of Dean cutting him open, pulling his soul from his chest, the awful nightmares Sweet Dreams had given him… “But no, he isn’t the reason. I was betrayed by someone I tried to help, and left to the mercies of State torture.”
“He probably didn’t think about it,” said Jo. “You’re going to have a hard time being spontaneous from now on though.”
Dean ignored him. The moment he saw Castiel was in the car he turned the wheel over to Hannah and calmly exited it, as though Castiel hadn’t even spoken. Hannah called after him, words demanding what he was doing and why he wasn’t following the plan. Dean walked forward without stopping, and despite the pain Castiel was in he tried to lunge for the car door to go after him.
There was no way to even think about answering through the intense pain Castiel was going through, and as it ratcheted ever higher he felt himself begin to lose consciousness. Within seconds, everything was once again peacefully blank.
“I understand. It makes sense,” Cas said. Mary almost looked sorry for a moment. “And Sam advised you tell me this. Naturally. He wants to test me, because if I run away it’s safe to kill me without hurting Dean’s feelings. It’s touching, how much he cares about his brother.”
“I made sure they liked me. Nineteen prisoners dead in that cell by the end of that first summer. But not me,” said Dean, sounding haunted. “It’s just pain, Cas. you hold on until you can’t anymore and then you hold on a little longer after that.”
“It means I’m trying to find a way out of this where I don’t have to ask you to leave me behind. Or tell you to. Whichever works.”
“Ishim had taken an interest in me as his eventual replacement should he be given the opportunity to lead his own garrison or replace Anna if she were ever promoted,” said Castiel flatly. “So my commander asked me to shoot him, as a test perhaps. His is the only life I’ve ever taken by direct action, and I have never regretted it. When I imagine the horror that Lily Sunder must have had, to be faced with the choice he had tried to force on her-“
“Then I’m probably awake,” said Castiel congratulating himself on his logic. Jo meanwhile was slowly going from relief to concern at seeing him conscious. It ripped the cover off the well of guilt he’d spent so long ignoring. “You don’t know. You wouldn’t be so worried if you knew.”
“You barely spoke to her and left as soon as you could,” Selma countered. “I… I understand if it’s difficult after what happened, but disappearing every time she’s within fifteen feet of you isn’t helping you or her.”
Cas sits on a barstool in the Roadhouse, invisible again. He doesn’t understand why this has become a place to congregate among his long dead friends. Of course, he could ask them, but that would involve showing his face and he’s not sure if he’s welcome. Many of them don’t even like each other. And yet day after day they show their faces and talk and act as if they were still alive. It feels like a performance, and Castiel is starting to wonder what happens when everyone stops acting.
“No!” Cas yelled. Dean practically jumped at the sudden volume. “Don’t leave. If you leave, he might come back and make me sleep. I don’t want to fall asleep. All they do is stare at me, Dean. It’s my fault, but if I’m awake I don’t have to remember. Please don’t-“
And if he were being honest, he might have said even if it had been the worst kiss in the world, it still would have been pretty great because of who he was kissing. Because of everything else that had come before.
“I don’t want them to panic,” said Dean. “And send away people who can actually help them. If we do our jobs, they’ll be safe and Zachariah might just lose a bit of his hold on the city.”
“It would’ve been stupid not to bring him,” Dorothy said now. “If we’re facing off against rogue state soldiers, I want someone who knows how they think and isn’t going to fuck us over.”
“I’m happy for you,” Sam interrupts, sparing Dean having to actually explain himself. Which is appreciated because Dean has no idea what was about to come out of his mouth, and is a little worried it was gonna be all kinds of sappy. “I didn’t think you’d get to have that. After everything with Lisa you just seemed to lose interest in anything like- Well, I guess it makes sense. It was Cas this whole time, wasn’t it?”
“You’re seventeen years old, and you’ve been on active duty for less than a year,” said Cas. “Forgive me if I don’t care about your opinion.”
It wasn’t long after that that they finally reached where the resistance had moved their operations to. It was much closer to the center of the city, and therefore a lot closer to civilians that Cas was sure Mary Winchester was hoping would turn on Azazel if he tried pulling the same trick again. The entrance to each building was heavily guarded, and Risa was questioned multiple times before being allowed to enter and was made to account for everyone traveling with her. After that, they were told they wouldn’t be allowed to leave unless there was an emergency or under direct orders from Mary Winchester.
They had missed lunch, but there was still some spare vegetables in the tent designating for food. Charlie explained there were sympathetic farmers nearby who had been willing to send food in exchange for some of the explosives Cordelia and Jessica were working on that “weren’t powerful enough”. When Castiel asked why they would need explosives, Charlie shrugged and said they hadn’t asked which was the most concerning thing Castiel had heard all day. Though Charlie had reassured him that Robert Cain had a longstanding trade relationship with Bobby and there hadn’t been problems yet.
“They’re doing something to one of the cars,” said Castiel. “They only need four to leave. I think they mean to leave the one they’re tampering with behind.”
“Nine years old,” he repeated. “And they’d already pretty much written you off as obedient and mindless, huh?”
If a year ago, someone had told him that this was his future… he would have laughed. He had changed so much in so little time, and trauma had had a large hand in how drastically that had happened.
“Fuck Gabriel, especially,” said Cas, even more belligerently. Then he started dry heaving and Dean had to turn him on his side so he didn’t choke and Cas felt significantly more tired after that. “I can’t fall asleep. Please don’t make me.”
“Wait, so Dean and Cas are dating, then?” Jack asked. Charlie quelled this line of inquiry with a murderous glance in his direction. “I just wanted to make sure I understood.”
“I hear you broke out of your hallucination almost instantly,” Dr. Newman said. “I’m just wondering… how? Sam I understand, I know what he’s been through. But everyone else needed help reaching reality again.”
“Cas,” said Claire, interrupting his thoughts. She looked tense, and it put him on guard. Claire had proved an indispensable asset on their journey to Libidine. She knew which roads to use, when to pull off the road and hide, and where they could find surplus food soldiers had stashed and civilians wouldn’t know the locations to. Her help had cut the time it took to get to Libidine in half. It didn’t make up for the week Cas had been kidnapped, but it was something.
“No. But I trust you to act in his best interests,” Billie says, nodding towards the image of Dean she has conjured. “See, unlike some people, I learn from my mistakes.”
“Dean, please just stop,” said Charlie. The fact that she was siding with Cas (even if everyone else in the car was also siding with Cas) was testament to just how annoying Dean had decided to make himself that day. Even Jack had quietly voiced his disapproval. Quietly. Dorothy and Betty had made numerous attempts to dissuade Dean from going through those same five songs again.
“You are such a baby,” she said. She unzipped her sleeping bag and Castiel didn’t hesitate to crawl in next to her. “No funny business.”
“Put yourself in my position and I think you might start to understand that I didn’t have a choice,” she said, a hint of shame working it’s way through. But she was proud and she kept her chin up. “If I know anything about you, I know that in my position you would do the same.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” said Benny, making Jo laugh. “Though if we want to talk about tattoos, Ms. Linda Tran has a fascinating example of the art.”
“She’s a good one,” Ellen confirmed with a hint of a smile. Deep pride simmered under the surface of what she was saying, and Castiel wondered a moment whether his parents had felt that strongly about him. If they’d loved him as much as Ellen loved Jo. “Make sure she takes care of herself, will you?”
“What else was I supposed to do?” she asks him. “You said you had a bad feeling about Chuck still being in control of our lives. And then you died. I thought it could be a lead. And now you’re back-”
“Let it be clear that I have enough experience with taking orders to know when someone’s words are repeated and when they are their own,” Castiel said, not buying for an instant the Charlie that had been so open with him would have an instinct for hiding information with being directed to do so. He knew he had Charlie’s trust. He slept in a spare room in her cabin, and although he knew she was armed or within reach of a weapon at all times, as well as highly skilled at combat, she wouldn’t put herself at a disadvantage around him if she had any doubt. No, it was clear that what was keeping him from getting information currently was Dean. He was the only one that had any hope of controlling Charlie, who was outside of any hierarchy the resistance seemed to be trying to enforce and was very much her own master. Not even Billie held much sway with her, as far as Castiel could tell. All of which had reinforced the idea that Charlie was incredibly necessary and valuable to them, since they let her bend rules as she pleased.
“Give me the chance to catch up?” Cas asked. His throat felt tight with nerves. The strange lust that had overtaken him had faded now, and Cas’ mind had cleared. If he was going to be stupid enough to go into this, he was going to do so with both eyes open. “Please, be patient.”
Kelly pulls him against her side then, and Jack lets her. She kisses his temple and Jack closes his eyes. He feels smaller than he ever has before. He feels safe, too. It’s nice.
“I’m the oldest, Father,” he said urgently. “And I’ve done everything for you. You’re making a mistake.”
Cas wanders out of whoever’s bedroom had been handed over as a makeshift recovery room for Dean to rest in. He suspects it is Alex’s room, from the posters on the walls of various musical acts, many of them smaller bands with graphically violent names and an affinity for spiked jewelry. Others were slightly less provocative, and Cas recognized one for Radiohead that he suspects Claire got for her.
“When we were in Purgatory,” said Dean, trying and failing to keep his mouth from going dry. He swallowed hard, and ignored the pulsing sound of his heartbeat rushing in his ears. “When I couldn’t find you --”
There was no time to pick further down that particular thread, however. With all the pieces in place, they could begin to put the opening stages of their plan in motion. That meant Charlie and Meg would turn off the power grid just as it was getting dark, leaving the city in disarray and confusion and drawing any militant resources to defend what they were certain Libidine would see as an attack. Hopefully, anyone in critical need of electricity would be protected by generators (which Cas knew were required in hospitals, but wasn’t hopeful that regulation was well enforced), but they knew this gambit was likely going to risk at least some people’s lives. So they decided to limit the power outage to twenty five minutes to minimize damage as much as possible, while still giving Claire and Cas time to infiltrate the prison and rescue as many people as possible. Resistance members would be separated into groups and led to different hiding places Claire knew across the city by following a coordinate system Charlie had devised on the fly. Everyone under Dean’s command, along with Jesse and Cesar and anyone they considered vital to their operation would be taken to Amara Novak’s place of residence.
He was thinking of it now as he and Selma were keeping an eye on the perimeter of camp. They even let Castiel carry a gun now, and he knew that said that he had come a long way in their estimation since he had first arrived.
“You’re awake,” she realized about a minute later, when she noticed his eyes were open. “Or you’re creepily sleeping with you’re eyes open.”
Eileen scrambles for the door, hauling it open just in time to get out of the room before the rest of the ceiling collapses in. Breathing hard, it takes a moment to realize she’s alive. She made it out by the skin of her teeth, and the ghosts are gone, and nothing is coming for her.
Corbett shook his head. Castiel watched as Dean looked between the two of them, clearly looking for signs of discontent. It still bothered him that they had almost deserted, and Castiel wondered if that wasn’t a big reason for him choosing to include them in this mission. Then again, it could just be that Mary had wanted anyone with the potential to cause trouble taken out of the picture. It seemed a little suspicious that the key orchestrators of Kelly’s escape (namely Castiel, Jo, Risa, Maggie, and Corbett) had all been sent off into the desolate (in Castiel’s somewhat biased mind anyone) and frigid country they were now in.
Dean all but confirmed it when he shrugged and stood there, as though daring Cas to have an opinion about it. Cas kept his mouth shut tightly, not wanting to open up the discussion.
“Who are you convincing, Jack?” chided the older soldier, who moved forward and pushed Castiel ahead of the two of them, keeping the taser pressed to Castiel’s back, likely in case he ‘tried something’. “Why do you care what a traitor thinks?”
“She looks just like you,” he said instead, because it was true. Dean was obviously startled by that answer for a moment before his face hardened again.
“Clearly,” Dorothy agreed, a quick grin falling to the wayside as soon as she realized who she was smiling at. “And fuck you, by the way.”
He decided not to worry about it for now and instead enjoy being allowed to accompany Selma on her round of keeping a lookout for state forces from Invidia. Benny had allowed it with minimal taunting of Castiel, if only because Selma seemed happy to have his company.
Dean turned the page and started on the next poem and then the next. Castiel slowly drifted between waking and sleeping, and a thread through each was the steady cadence of familiar words spoken by a familiar voice.
“I am going to share guys,” she said when she found herself the center of concentrated collective hatred. “Seriously, you all need to chill.”
“Blow shit up?” Dean finished for her, looking for all the world a little afraid. “God help me, but yes.”
“Let them go,” Azazel said after a moment. One of his guards went to cut the ropes from both Dagon and Ramiel. Ramiel immediately asked if he could leave and made some mention about going back to the lab and catching up on his reading. Dagon, on the other hand…
“I’m here when you need me,” said Anna cryptically. “And, dear God, do you need someone to help you.”
Castiel looked out of the passenger window to see the city and scared civilians passing by. They were one of many cars and had fake documents proving themselves citizens, but no one stopped them to ask for them. Jo drove like a true Superbian, calmly and with sudden bursts of outrageous maneuvering to get ahead.
“You care about me,” said Cas. “Like you care about Superbia and Invidia and the people who live there, too? You care until it’s inconvenient, and then it’s fine if you hurt them as long as you win? If you give away their homes and their lives?”
“You’re alright,” he assured her. He followed that up by sneezing violently which caused Charlie to laugh, a little too high pitched to be entirely okay, but better. “Why did I let you get a cat again?”
“I remember,” Max muttered. “Not sure there’s something I know about him a State file wouldn’t have told this scumbag-”
“I know I did something shitty, but don’t push your luck,” said Dean. He looked back down at the ground and saw Charlie. “She should probably get to sleep in a real bed.”
So she knows. She knows every flicker of emotion she’s seen on Dean’s face the past twenty four hours because she lived it first. Even the guilt.
“If anyone is being used, it isn’t him,” Castiel bit back bitterly. Mary managed to hide most of her surprise at his sudden vehemence. “If you want to be convinced, Mary Winchester, know this: I want him to live more than I want to win this war. Is that enough?”
“I am definitely just going to chug a bottle of wine, but we can do the first part,” says Charlie. “And then you can tell me who Eileen is…”
“Not like that, asshole,” Dean mutters. Cas does him the favor of pretending not to notice just how red Dean’s face has become. Although it is a little funny.
They were quickly directed to where Benny was assigning positions and directions to everyone under his command. Selma and Castiel waited patiently for him to see them and Selma was quickly sent off to help Jo and Jessica distribute explosives along Sanctus’ perimeter. Castiel on the other hand was ignored.
“Because there’s no one to hold it together, anymore,” she says. “The few angels left desperately tried to fix one bad adjustment that I released. You think Castiel or you wouldn’t have made a different mistake?”
Then again, the world itself still seemed grey at the edges to Cas, and he was finding more and more that he just didn’t care anymore. Whatever lever had been yanked inside him the day before had used up all of his emotions and now there just wasn’t anything left. Perhaps he should find that disturbing, but honestly he couldn’t really muster up any feelings for that either. Vaguely he wished he could talk to Garth about this, but it didn’t seem worth the trouble arranging a call with him would be.
Seeing there are no monsters to fight, and Dean just fell over his own feet, Claire goes bright red and starts to close the door again, apologizing as she does so. But then she freezes. Dean meets her eyes and then looks down at his own chest and for a second neither of them say anything. A series of emotions run over Claire’s face, disbelief, betrayal, hope, relief, anger, and then finally just confusion. Like she has no idea what to do with this. Dean doesn’t either.
“He did what?” Castiel said, perhaps a little too loudly. Everyone went back to staring at him. “I didn’t mean to shout. I apologize if I frightened you…”
“I had it pointed out to me,” she says. “It’s smarter to have allies than enemies. Especially when you have the second in common. Having a former crossroads demon on the payroll is a good reminder that inconvenience can be turned to your advantage if you’re willing to compromise. So I’m willing to compromise. For now.”
“Should’ve taken him up on it and sent him back bullshit. Might’ve been entertaining. Then again, you’re a shitty liar, so-“
Everyone was supposed to report to Benny, who had been radioed instructions to relay so that they could return to their regular duties and responsibilities, and it was apparent before a word left Benny’s mouth that some people weren’t happy.
“Look, Cas, it’s not that I’m not flattered. Or… y’know interested,” said Dean, clearing his throat uncomfortably. “But I’ve been, uh, trying to get better about not doing whole casual hook ups thing anymore, okay? I just don’t want you to think-“
“Are you awake?” he heard Charlie whisper into the quiet. He looked at her and nodded. “Can I ask you something?”
“What? Don’t you want me?” Castiel asked bitterly, vaguely wondering if this was how Jo had felt when she’d propositioned him. Knowing you didn’t want sex for the right reasons, and likely it was a terrible idea, and still feeling upset and rejected for being turned down. He didn’t like it.
“I knew,” he said. Dean supposed that was all the answer he was going to get, and so he leant over and kissed the boy again. The kiss was quickly returned, and Dean surrendered himself to the feeling of the boy’s hands on his skin. Soon they lay naked under the stars, a wet spot on the ground between them. Dean had never done more than kiss before, and though he did not know it, the boy next to him was no more experienced. It didn’t matter. It had felt right, and Dean longed only to touch him again. At least until he remembered.
It’s like one second Cas is still a good three feet away from him, and the next Dean is stopped mid sentence by what is quite honestly the kiss of a lifetime. Dean feels it in his knees, and he didn’t know that was a thing that actually happened to people in real life. Cas sways with it, equally unsteady on his feet. And Dean thinks for a second that he wouldn’t mind if Cas fell and took him down too.
“When we get out of here,” he said, mockingly solemn. “We’re going to have to have a long talk about when and where it’s appropriate to use the Moores’ explosives.”
Cas’ eyes swung to Dean, who was eating across from him. Dean met his gaze, and Cas watched as the man’s face darkened. Maybe it was anger, maybe it was desire. Castiel wasn’t confident enough to label it as either. Whatever the case, twenty minutes after found the two of them alone in the room Dean had claimed for himself. Dean’s hands clutched at Cas’ skin, and there was love there. But there was something else too, and it turned Cas’ stomach to think about it too long.
“No,” Cas says. It comes out hostile, and Cas is angry he is completely incapable of hiding his annoyance. It’s one thing to face Jack, another to face Amara, who carved a message into his chest once just to prove a point. Whose rage, however justified it might be, was later taken out through her torture of Castiel’s body. And yes, it was Lucifer at the wheel during that particular period of his life, but it’s not as if he forgot or forgave the pain of it.
“In what world do we have the technology to do any of that, Cas?” Dean said enunciating each word. “Think long and hard about that.”
“I’m taking your beer,” she says. She gets up and disappears behind the counter. The sound of a fridge opening and closing fills the silence. Mary sits and starts drinking.
Mary Winchester frowned at the both of them. She seemed to take particular offense at Castiel’s posture.
“Eighteen minutes,” he said. For the umpteenth time Castiel tried to think of some way out of the horrendous situation he had found himself in. He couldn’t have survived everything else to be killed like this, after hours of torture and for anyone and everyone to see. Yet still the minutes ticked down and Castiel could think of nothing. When it was time for the camera’s to come back on, Castiel found he was quite desperate.
Cas took out his radio, and took his last minute to relay his plan to Charlie as he looked for a full proof place to hide.
“No. God, no,” said Dean. “He just… look, he’s surrounded by people that don’t trust him, don’t like that he’s giving us so many resources, and are angling to take the throne from him. I’m just taking the pressure off by making sure no one can accuse him of… thinking with his other brain.”
“Me?” she said, shoulders shaking with silent and angry laughter. She sat down heavily on her sleeping bag, crossing her legs and not looking at him anymore. “You can join the club I guess.”
Dorothy sat back. She kept her expression blank, but Cas could see her hands tighten slightly. He was glad to see that dealing with McCleod seemed to be a universally unpleasant experience. He had started to think perhaps he was imagining how annoying he was.
Chuck let out a weary sigh, and left. As he did so, Cas caught sight of a flash of blonde hair, the same shade as his mother’s. So Chuck hadn’t been lying. There were more Novak children. Castiel felt his insides burning with anger at the thought. He felt replaced three times over. It had never occurred to him his parents might have had more kids after him. In his head, he’d always been a gaping hole left in their small family.
Dean glared at nothing and his fingers twitched. Cas wished a moment that he might resurrect Alistair just to kill him again himself. Dean’s expression didn’t leave much to the imagination.
“That doesn’t mean I don’t care,” said Dean sharply. “You think I wanted to make that deal with Crowley? That’s the best offer he would take.”
There is still Dean to contend with, though. Cas finds himself conflicted. Because there is a part of him that is angry with Dean and hurt by what happened earlier that day. There is another part that does not care, has never cared about anything except being close to Dean, no matter the cost to himself. It has motivated some of the best and the worst of his actions, the most sincere and the most reckless. He doesn’t hate this part of himself, no matter that it has hurt him in the past. It simply is, another piece of his being folded into the multitude that is him. He can’t imagine himself without it, nevermind how small a point in the millennia he has existed the last twelve years have been. Because there is a difference between existing and living, and it isn’t until he met Dean that he truly came alive. He became himself through his friendships on Earth, and he would never choose to go back to being what he had been. Cold and distant and suppressing the ever present fear that his doubts would be discovered and punished.
Dean’s plan had been unexpectedly good. He’d assumed the reason they had yet to be attacked was that forces from Invidia were waiting for the chemical agent to be diffuse enough so as not to effect them. That being the case, they all had to assume these hallucinations weren’t going anywhere within the next twenty four hours even after the gas was diffuse enough to no longer affect them. This meant there was a serious risk carrying firearms when one couldn’t always trust one’s eyes. On the other hand, if they engaged in outright combat, they were going to need effective weapons. Dean had suggested a strategy of capture and hold hostage, which would limit the amount of friendly fire hopefully play to their strengths of knowing Sanctus much better than the opposition. Soldiers tended not to be involved in rural matters as long as a steady supply of food was being traded to the cities, so it was unlikely any of the garrisons coming in had more than a cursory knowledge of Sanctus. Castiel remembered it had taken him three or four days before he had even begun to memorize the strange interweaving of the roads within the town. Having the advantages of familiarity with area of combat and the element of surprise were going to be crucial to expelling Zachariah’s forces.
They all congregate in the map room by some unspoken agreement. It seems to be the place to congregate. On the walk there, Cas’ eyes slide past the familiar table where the Winchesters’ initials are carved, and nearly does a double take when he sees his own name and Jack’s now carved there. A rush of affection strikes him so suddenly he feels dizzy. Dean doesn’t notice, tugging him along by the front of his coat to get him moving again. There is an anxiety to his movements, the way he glances nervously around as if expecting Billie to appear out of thin air.
John Winchester was a marine. While he was at war, his father convinced his mother to leave their life for the quiet town of Lebanon. There they settled down. At first they were rejected by the locals, shunned. At least they were until Henry Winchester proved to be an excellent bookbinder. He was sought out at market by prominent members of fairy kind, and declared a veritable man of letters. Millie Winchester did not need to do so much to prove herself. She knew her husband had certain fascinations with the unnatural and she’d long since decided she’d rather not know the extent of his inquiries into such matters. She became very good at not asking questions, the favored past time of her new home.
The thought of Charlie hovering over him and getting upset when he ignored Dr. Newman’s suggestions was not a pleasant one. Castiel decidedly did not want that to happen.
“Yeah, well you could have been fucking sympathetic about what happened with Vic- with Lydia,” Dean says, only just saving himself. And then it occurs to him, why the fuck not come out with it all? “With Victor.”
“I’m going to have to have a word with Jo,” said Benny. “I think she’s infected you with part of her personality.”
And then Dean kissed him. On the lips. It probably would have been a smoother move if Cas hadn’t been mid-sentence when it happened, but that sorted itself out soon enough. Dean would congratulate whoever had taught Cas how to kiss, but he kinda suspected Cas was operating mostly off of tips Dean had off-handedly given him over the years (to be used on people who were not Dean, because Dean hated himself), and vanity was a sin or whatever.
“Okay, but are you writing?” asks Dean, emphasizing the question so Chuck knows exactly what he means. Are you fucking with our lives again? Did we even beat you or was this all some kind of fucking test, a mind game that ends with Chuck finally winning, just as the Winchesters thought they’d pulled a fast one on God himself. But Chuck doesn’t look triumphant. Just confused.
“Heaven is a garden filled with bloodied angels,” Castiel said, his throat burning as he tries to swallow his own words. “Still dying.”
“It’s… me,” Cas confirms, dragging his attention away from Claire to meet Dean’s eyes for a brief moment before looking away again. Not towards Claire this time, who is safe as long as time is frozen. Just… away. It stings, even as Dean tells himself it shouldn’t.
Cas smiles at him knowingly, because he can’t help it. Dean sputters for a moment before grinning back in mild embarrassment.
“Hey, we’ve come back from harder odds before,” he confirmed. Cas nodded and let go of Dean’s hand. He stood up to leave and go to his assigned quarters. Dean grabbed the back of Cas’ shirt and pulled him back.
He’s going to show them, his family. He’s going to show them that he’s still good. That he has always been good.
“I don’t… I’m not,” says Cas, unable to face the awfulness of what Amara is suggesting. Becoming the new arbiter of Dean’s freedom. Another obstacle. Another enemy. Again. “I’m not God.”
“As a doornail,” Pamela confirmed. It made sense now, the soldiers that had been tailing them. The entire city was under Mortimer’s control, which meant the resistance had successfully staged a coup with the death of one man. That was nepotism for you, Cas supposed. He didn’t much like the fact that Mortimer seemed to have killed his brother without regret or shame. It didn’t speak much for him feeling anything in the way of attachment.
She can see in her father’s face how difficult this all is for him. That even now, even after having lost his mother and gotten her back he still feels the loss of his wife more keenly. But he seems to bury that grief so he can nod at her. He invites them in, holding the door open wider to gesture them through.
Sam, Cas, and Charlie sit at the kitchen table, and Dean can’t bring himself to approach them. Cas is slightly pink, which means he’s been drinking and he has been doing his best to make the effects last. Dean likes when that happens. There’s something bubbly about the way Cas starts complaining about obscure historical events (the ones he deigned watch from the heavens), or the way he winks too much and not at quite the right times.
“I killed someone today. I’m not in a celebratory mood,” Cas said harshly, already knowing what Dean wanted from him. He wanted Cas to behave like everyone else, fall into line, and join the cause.
“I’m not sure about the man,” said Duma, her eyes once again on Cas. His attention flickered between her and the strange man. At last he settled his focus on the man, deciding he was in charge and the more important of the two to win over.
“Yes, you,” Billie interrupted, speaking as though she couldn’t hear Dean. “People know your name, Castiel. What happened in Superbia has spread beyond its borders, and the soldiers see you as something of a martyr. A template for who to be in a new world. Among citizens and the resistance you are… less well liked. But the soldiers, they respect you. They believe in you. You change minds and loyalties.”
“I know,” he said softly, doing his best to catch her as she collapsed. “But it’s okay. You’ll be okay, Anael. It’s just like going to sleep.”
“I can second that,” said one of the woman Castiel had yet to meet. Her hair was short and blonde, and she had a lean look about her. “Roman’s conniving, but he’s proud. He likes Lucrum’s business to stay in Lucrum. We’re pretty sure that’s why he drugged the water supply, so everyone’s too blissed out to ever leave or betray him.”
Dean did not know what to do with this. In fact he did not know what to do at all, and perhaps that was why he stopped trying to reason what he should do and did what he had only just realized he wanted to do. He kissed the boy again, longer this time. He leaned back and then found himself lurching forward to again catch the boy’s lips with his own, all the while reveling in the wide blue eyes that were staring back at him.
“Do you think I made the right choice?” she asks him. He side-eyes her, holding his tongue for a second. She watches a few emotions cross his face, none of them entirely set. He settles on a kind of commiseration. “What you said to Jack, it… I almost changed my mind.”
But he can try. Awful as it is, Cas just gave him all the tools he needs to see this through. To set everything in motion. Still, it’s not every day you ask an angel to fall again. And both of you older and wiser and worse for wear than the first time around. But that doesn’t mean Dean isn’t gonna ask.
Cas ended up sleeping again. The next time he woke up, he was alone. He got up to look around and found it was late afternoon. When he left the room, dressed for the day, he found a guard waiting for him and was taken to where the others were having what looked to be some sort of competition.
When all was settled, Claire stepped forward first, taking a deep breath and opening the door. She stepped through, her feet landing on a surface that felt suspiciously spongy. Darkness surrounded her, and yet she found herself perfectly visible. It seemed almost a moving, breathing creature she had wandered inside of.
“Cordy, Jess!” Selma called out, making her way to one of the tables in the tent. Castiel did a double take when he saw both of the twins turn in unison to look at Selma. They narrowed their eyes at him in almost uncanny synchronization as they attempted to figure out why Selma might be dragging the spy behind her.
“F-f-follow me,” Inias said, gulping when he looked at the torturer. The poor man was little better than a bureaucrat, and Castiel did not feel safe in knowing that he was the sole point of reference he had in this rescue mission. Still, he kept his eyes down and never looked at Inias for too long. Best not to give up the game, if only for Inias’ sake. He could still back out and Castiel did not hate him, and saw no need to reveal him if he did so. After all, what did he owe a traitor several times over?
So here she is, deep in the thick of putting down another uprising (how her disloyal subjects keep forgetting she knows spells that’ll make their toenails curl in on themselves she’ll never know), when suddenly time comes to a stop around her. Rowena frowns, poking at one of the few members of her royal guard who has managed not to be a total disappointment. When he doesn’t move, Rowena turns in a circle, looking for whatever being has deigned to put time at a pause. And why, more importantly.
The two of them only promise to help him find Cas’ motel room if he lets them watch the whole time (in case Dean has suddenly transformed into a creepy stalker instead of just an idiotic fuck up) and if he promises not to go back to Cas’ room again unless invited. Charlie has the data pulled up on her computer in minutes, and she uses it to call Cas’ phone. Dean tries to silently ask for it but she shakes her head.
“She reminds me of…” Jack said, trailing off into silence. He was more reflective than he usually was. Less righteous. Cas wasn’t sure that was a good thing. “She’s pregnant.”
“Alright, walk that last part back for me,” says Dean, the most focused he’s sounded in the entire conversation. Sam hears the sound of rustling in the background as Dean sits up or something and wonders what Dean is doing in bed. Sure he has a broken leg, but it’s still like noon where he is and Dean isn’t much of a sleeper. No way he hasn’t gotten up unless something else happened to him. Sam feels his eyes narrow. “You mean Azazel like Azazel who killed Mom and fed you demon blood Azazel? And you didn’t think that was something I should know about-?”
“I’m going to ask Billie for Mary,” he says. Cas lets him go and looks at him. His eyes are sad. “I can still- She prayed to me. When Heaven was breaking. I don’t know why I never thought of trying to bring her back before. I’m the one who- I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before.”
“Heaven split,” Jack says back, wiping an angry tear away from his face. Cas doesn’t know when he started crying. He wants to comfort Jack but he doesn’t know how. It’s too much. The weight of human souls on his shoulders, even now that he can’t do anything about them. “How are you going to put it back together again?”
There is no memory of Dean to play this out. Cas doesn’t understand. He looks at Dean again, and he wants to get it but Dean isn’t saying a word. Mary and Bobby exchange glances awkwardly and Sam looks like he’s about to burst a blood vessel.
“And the other theory you mentioned?” she asks, wondering if Cas really has been avoiding Dean for some reason. Dean grimaces.
For a long time the answer to this has been clear. Stop this bad guy. Help these people. Solve this problem. With no specific answer to point to now, however, Jack finds himself at a loss. He wants what he’s already said. He wants them all to be a family. He wants the time and space to find out what he’s supposed to want next.
“But he may want to some day,” says Cas cryptically. “It’s easier not to feel things. You know that.”
Then again, there were times when even his affection for Selma couldn’t break through the fact he was still indignant about Castiel punching Dean (one time, Castiel thought to himself tiredly) and wanted to reassure Castiel, in case he had forgotten, just how much he disliked him.
Ash relaxed so quickly Castiel wondered if perhaps it was an unfair advantage for him to be good friends with such a likable person. There was a reason Dean asked Jo to do all of the recruiting. She was unrelentingly friendly and quick to put people at ease when she needed to.
Cas looks up from his musings to see Dean struggling to lift the body of one of the more muscular hunters. Cas obliges, lifting the man with ease and avoiding the burnt out sockets where his eyes once were.
“I don’t…” Cas whispered, closing his eyes. He could feel a burning at the back of his throat because honestly, it wasn’t supposed to be like this. “You weren’t supposed to love me back.”
“C’mon, kiddo,” Dean says, falling back on bravado in lieu of actual courage. “You think you don’t have it in you to know who failed you? Cause it wasn’t Cas, we both know that. I mean, you only sent the hit squad against one of the three of us, and well… Not like I don’t know why.”
“You don’t work tomorrow?” Cas asks him hesitantly. Dean can tell he’s trying to find a way to politely turn Dean down.
But with Light, there is always Darkness. How easy to forget. It’s ingrained, deep, a consequence of the universe’s very inception. Creation itself casted the SHADOW. Pleasantly tired, they are silent and dragged in the wake of memory, gently rocking to the tune of stolen dreams.
“As if I would ever answer that question,” said Eileen. She managed to sound dismissive, sarcastic, and pleasant all at the same time. “I’m not an open book, Castiel. In my experience, it’s safer that way.”
“Are you busy after this?” she asked, seeming not to notice how the noise level of everyone else sitting at the table died at her question. Castiel realized more quickly this time what a question like this meant.
Claire leaps up from her seat and dashes past the door, just missing Sam’s outstretched hands to stop her. Another hard pull from Patience and he’s stumbling back. She puts herself between him and the door. Even with the certainty in her expression, Sam can’t help but think he’s just let something terrible happen.
It was too bright when Castiel tried to open his eyes. It took a great deal of blinking before he could open his eyes, and as he started to wake, he felt bile rising in his throat. He tried to spit it out, and then felt hands on him turning him onto his side and placing a pan under his mouth. Something was tugging uncomfortably at his wrists, but he was too sick to care.
A flicker of guilt pierces through Castiel, seeming to trickle icy cold through his veins. He’s not sure what to say, and Kaia suddenly looks a lot less sure too.
“Shut up,” said Cas. Dorothy looked like she was entertaining the idea of hitting him for talking to her like that, but he shook his head and pointed behind her. In the distance, they could see two women dressed entirely in white soldiers’ uniforms approaching them. They were armed. “I think we’re here.”
Cas didn’t have an answer for this. He wasn’t even really sure where it was coming from. Yes, he knew Dean cared about him, but Dean cared about everyone. He was a singularly empathetic person. And certainly Dean was attracted to him and that had complicated some aspects of things, but Castiel wasn’t exactly among a small number of people there either. It was easier to list the people who hadn’t at some point had sex or wanted to have sex with Dean than the other way around. This being the case, Dean was used to navigating the complications and resisting the urge to be biased.
“Don’t mess with it, those two are crazy about each other. Betty knows it too, that’s why she didn’t put up much of a fuss. She knows she and Charlie are just having fun. It’s different with Jo,” Dean said, waving off Castiel’s concerns. “Charlie just has… issues. A lot of us do.”
“Promise me my men will be safe,” he said. “Whatever punishment needs to be inflicted, it doesn’t fall on their heads. If nothing else, you owe me that.”
“Give him a second,” Sam says. He’s right. Of course, he’s right. Cas isn’t even sure what he wants from Dean. To be yelled at? To be disowned? To pay somehow for the wrongness of this situation. “It’s not your fault. He knows that, but…”
It’s not like Sam hasn’t lost Dean before. Hasn’t had to move on with his life, however that worked. Drinking demon blood or hitting a dog and settling down or just carving out his own place in the world when he was off at college. Before Chuck’s plot caught up to him. But it’s different this time, because they were supposed to change the ending. It was supposed to be the open road and a life stretched out ahead of them, and now all Sam sees is the things he has to do. After that it all seems to go blurry.
But of course, this is Jack. Or well, not Jack. God. But also Jack, just a little. The remnants of the boy Cas had tried so hard to raise to be good and honest and true, who had taught Cas in turn what it meant to be more of… of a father. More of a man, perhaps. Then again, Cas isn’t a man exactly, so much as he is a being not uncomfortable with masculinity, in the human sense of the word. A found comfort he should be trying to distance himself from.
He’s sat there a while before someone sits next to him. He ignores this. No one will take his seat, out of a subconscious aversion, so he sits and does nothing and waits for someone to realize he broke the rules again. Even when he’s largely in charge of it all, he can’t stop himself from breaking the rules.
“You’re right. It’s not. But you don’t seem to be able to do the job yourself, so until that changes I’ll pick up your slack,” Selma said. “You should sleep.”
“Hey now,” said Ernie, immediately aware of the change in atmosphere. He was attuned to tension despite lacking in his other senses. “We don’t want trouble here.”
“If he has to follow you,” Cas says, hands signing along with his words. “If we have to bind him. Someone has to close the door behind him, to seal the binding. Someone he can’t see coming.”
“I’m not exactly interested in the cult basement you crawled out of,” said Meg. Claire scowled at her.
“We could be. It’s not too late for us to change. That’s what Billie was saying. It’s not too late to just… be different men.”
For a while Chuck just stares at Sam. Then the strangest thing happens. He smiles. Like he can’t quite believe it.
“Forgive me for being a little suspicious about the people that tried to recruit my own men to spy on me,” Dean said. None of them blinked. “You had to know Cas would tell me about that.”
“I don’t really like it when people call me pretty,” said Dean. He let go of Cas and sat on the steps of his cabin. Cas hadn’t noticed where they had been walking before then, but this made sense. Cas sat down on the opposite side of the steps. “You wanted to talk. Talk.”
“A member of my former garrison,” he said through gritted teeth. She had the sense enough to look ashamed of herself then. She knew what being in a garrison meant. And what it didn’t mean. And it never meant leaving someone behind that you could save. “He was shot. If we kill the power, and the only thing keeping him alive is a machine…”
“You should get some sleep, Dean,” says Cas, not missing the way the energy has slowly been draining out of Dean over the course of their long conversation. Or the fact that Dean is likely exhausted physically and emotionally from yet another close brush with death. “It’s late.”
Cas stopped passing out food, much to the dismay of the surly Sanctan teenager who had been holding his plate out half-heartedly for a serving of steamed vegetables. Cas passed the serving spoon to Jo, who had been standing next to him and gossiping, and stood at attention. Jo too had stopped talking and was doing her best to pretend all of her attention wasn’t directed behind her while she apportioned out food.
The Russian is different than Dean was expecting. He’s shorter, less imposing. Less intruding. Quiet and still, like he could wait in a line forever without even a hint of impatience. It threw Dean long enough for a small frown to form on the Russian’s face.
After checking his watch, Cas realized it was too early for Claire to wake him up. That could only mean there was a change in their situation. He bolted upright, startling Claire, and then ran to the window to see if his friends had been taken from the prison.
“Fine. But just because I feel bad you got your finger cut off,” she said to Cas. Cas’ hands twitched and he tried not to think about being strapped to a chair and waiting for Alistair to cut out his eye. “Come on, dude.”
Dean stopped on occasion to talk to the smaller groups of people traveling. He learned quickly that some of them had little in the way of an idea where to go, they just knew that the cities had become too dangerous to live in. Others had managed to get on the right path to Libidine, only to be chased off or turned around by a strange group of mostly women former soldiers that were blocking one of the main roads there. This was what interested Dean most, and the majority of their planning at the moment went towards preparing for an encounter with these women.
“I was just trying to lighten the mood,” muttered Gabriel, before pouring himself some of his father’s wine. He missed his older brother wincing, or he might have thought twice about drinking it. As it was, Michael attempted to salvage the situation as best as he could.
Without another thought, she lays her hands down on the horn, watching them jump out of her way as she throws the car in reverse and speeds out of her spot. She makes it out of the parking lot without a hitch.
“Ishim was a monster,” said Balthazar. “That’s different. If it makes you feel better, I’ve never slept with a civilian.”
Dean makes an effort to stand, gently pushing Cas off of him when he tries to help. He turns towards Billie, carefully making sure he is between her and everyone else. So just as stupid, Castiel thinks to himself. And then, well, he wouldn’t be Dean if he wasn’t.
Benny was starting to stumble too as they made it up the rest of the stairs. Everyone else had cleared out of ahead of them, except a masked girl who Cas distantly realized must be Claire. She leapt from behind the front desk and towards them, grabbing Dean from them and hoisting him over her shoulder in a fireman’s carry. She ran out of the building, shouting back at them to “Move it!” Benny grabbed Cas’ arm and urged him along. It must have taken less than thirty seconds for them to clear the front desk and burst through the front doors, but it felt like an eternity. Time wasn’t moving quite right, and Cas kept forgetting what they were running from. Benny dragged him after Claire’s retreating figure until the smell of smoke wasn’t quite so strong.
Cas has a feeling he knows exactly what Billie means to show him. She’s already come to him once before, when Dean had broken his leg on a ghost hunt and come close to dying (again) before Sam had managed to get him medical attention in time. She had come then only to deliver the news after it had happened, and spoke as if it hadn’t occurred to her that it might bother him. As if she were merely commenting on the weather or asking after his health, or any number of inconsequential things they might think to say to each other if they were not beings beyond the need for such pleasantries.
*Part of this chapter includes a hallucination that looks like Anna making sexual passes at Cas that he isn't comfortable with. While under the influence of Sweet Dreams, people see what they fear most, and Castiel has deep fears of the fact that while Anna was alive he was sexually interested in her.
“I’ve been alive for a very long time,” says Cas, deciding that perhaps if he satisfies Dean’s curiosity he will stop asking. “For most of it I found human sexuality boring and repetitive, in all its variety. Until it… wasn’t.”
“I know. Don’t mean I have to like the fact that means all of you have to leave so soon,” Bobby said. Dean seemed to be in agreement and Bobby let the sentiment hang for a second. “So Sam was talking to me about something.”
“I haven’t. Not with anyone,” he admitted, albeit a little hesitantly. Not that there was anything wrong with it. He just wasn’t looking forward to the teasing once Rosali told everyone else. Jo was bad enough about that, though she’d eased off after seeing how much it bothered Castiel.
“I just let her out,” said Castiel. “I didn’t plan to, I just saw her and I couldn’t let her stay like that. I just hoped that if someone would have the good sense to help her if she got out since none of you did.”
“Can I kiss you?” he asked Jo at one point, later in the night after they had been drinking a short while. She smiled at him, and there was something heartbreaking about the fact that she looked happy. After all of her time spent being afraid of what loving Dean Winchester might bring her, she looked happy. They kissed and it was nice. There was a spark there, like there had been before, but Dean couldn’t remove the thought from his head that it wasn’t quite so nice as another kiss he had enjoyed recently.
It’s sudden, the dark shame that clouds Dean’s face. It’s sudden too, the way twists his arms and almost gets free before Castiel takes him down again by grabbing his left leg when Dean tries to run. They struggle, but eventually Cas manages to gain control by placing Dean in a loose chokehold. Dean stops struggling, realizing how easily Cas could knock him out like this.
“I think about, sometimes,” says Cas. “If I want my father back. Not Chuck, just… some nebulous idea of one. The comfort of knowing there was a plan and he had orchestrated it and it was good.”
Eileen signs ‘fuck you’ and Sam signs back ‘I know that sign’ and then they both stay still and quiet for a while.
Castiel decided to return to the competition and gently let go of Selma’s hand so he could pick up one of the knives that had been put on the table after they had all been carefully pulled out of the wall. She stopped him before he could move very far.
“What are you doing here?” he asks her. “Didn’t think you’d be slumming it on Earth again any time soon.”
Castiel couldn’t quite look at Gabriel after that. He didn’t like at all how much sense what he’d said made, and even after having decided to switch sides, he couldn’t help but feel betrayed. He really believed that he was helping people during his time as a soldier, and now he didn’t know what to think at all.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” said Mary, a little pale faced now. “If I had any idea that he would have done anything like that I never would have sent you and Sam-“
“Where were you?” Dean asks him, trying for a grin. Cas smiles back weakly, hoping his hesitation isn’t taken for rebuke. If he were being honest, he might say he’s still waiting for Dean to realize that it isn’t mutual. This deep and unabiding love he’s carried through the years. At some point, Dean will figure out that their relationship is uneven, with Castiel taking and taking and never giving enough in return. Wanting too much. And then he will withdraw and Cas will have to face his pains alone.
“Just… just stay there okay?” he said. He and Jo left, while Ellen stayed behind. She sank into the chair Dean had been sitting in.
Charlie had brought Crookshanks with her and asked if Cas wanted to play with the cat. Castiel was tempted to say yes, but a brief moment spent thinking about how Jo would react to that and whether she would assume Cas was taking a side had him carefully turning her down. If the deeply disappointed look Charlie gave him was anything to go by, she knew exactly what he was doing.
“I need Charlie here,” Dean pointed out. “Besides, I need someone to find the twins and then check in on Gordon, Tamara, and Benny.”
So they drank by themselves, and laughed a lot about nothing. It didn’t get rid of the the tension inside Castiel, but he no longer felt stretched so thin. He no longer felt like he was going to snap.
Dean sighed, but nodded. He got it. It was a con, but it wasn’t an unmotivated con. The position of power Mortimer was trying to maneuver Guttur into was fragile. An attack from any side could wipe out their chances.
“Missed you,” she says quietly before letting go. She looks away from him, coughing a little performatively, and making her expression carefully blank. “So… how is he?”
“I assume Dean sent you back here. It isn’t a good time. Invidia has been stockpiling weapons in preparation for an invasion, and Naomi is desperate to protect her chances of assuming leadership.”
“Because you’re a fucking lunatic,” said Tamara. “And I wouldn’t put it past you to lose it and mow down every last one of us.”
It was only then that Cas saw Emma, a few steps behind her mother and with her head down. Like she was trying not to be noticed. It was such a departure from the outgoing, courageous girl he’d seen in passing several times before, that he couldn’t help but take notice.
“If you don’t like it, you can always leave,” Charlie pointed out. When Castiel sat up, she picked Crookshanks up and dumped the cat on his lap so he couldn’t get up. She gave him a smug smile when he relented because he didn’t want the cat to spend the next three days meowing mournfully at him for moving her.
“I think we keep him around,” Sam said, at last. “For now, at least. His file and his story add up. But one wrong move, Castiel, and you’re a dead man.”
That made sense. Sam left before Castiel could think of any other questions, so he continued on his way, assisting people as he went and relaying the same instructions time and time again. It was forty minutes since the car had exploded when he reached the edge of town and saw a rocking Jo who had Selma and Jessica gently trying to reach her. She didn’t appear to be listening. Castiel ran to her without a thought.
Cas leaned up to kiss Dean again, a highly effective method of shutting him up. As Dean started getting back into it, Cas broke the kiss again to copy what Dean had done earlier, trailing kisses down his neck.
“Tell me what to do,” he says. Dean stares at him. It’s like all the energy, all the fight has just drained out of Cas. He looks the way Dean feels most days, like living is an exercise in going through the motions. “Everything feels wrong. Everything has felt wrong since I left the Empty. The only time I felt like me again was making certain you got to live even when you shouldn’t have. You said I don’t listen to what you have to say. Maybe that’s true. So I’m sorry, too. Just… tell me what I’m supposed to do.”
“Gets what?” Castiel asked, feeling lost. Whatever this was, it wasn’t something Selma had brought up.
“I wouldn’t split hairs about what I can and can’t do, boy,” says Bobby. “You want to work? Show up. And don’t give me that look, we both know your mama’s paying the rent. Has been since Lydia-“
“What? Oh you mean about the nosy thing. That’s okay,” said Garth affably. “Everyone’s a little nosy. Didn’t take it as an insult.”
Alistair was a tall and thin man with a reedy voice and a smile that made Castiel feel thoroughly uncomfortable. His name also sounded damned familiar, though Castiel couldn’t quite place it. He reached for a knife at his belt and turned to Naomi.
“Or that,” said Jo grudgingly. The two looked out of the bars of their cells and waited as the hours started counting down. Castiel didn’t say it out loud again, but he couldn’t shake the deep conviction that no one was coming.
Dorothy’s lips pressed together. She nodded, and picked the cot closest to the door. Cas frowned. He had been planning on using that one. He supposed, however, it was best not to complain.
Dinner passed uneventfully, with no discussion of why they were there. The longer it went on without anyone mentioning anything, the more Castiel wondered just what was going on. He didn’t eat much, too busy waiting for something to happen other than the king uselessly chattering on about how wonderful his chef and tailor were while everyone else smiled politely at him.
“God, you’re a dick,” says Dean, hearing a short burst of laughter stutter through him. “What, so why’d I have to be here for this whole part? Didn’t know you needed an audience when you went invisible girl.”
“We’re offering splitting the territory currently under Superbia’s control with Canada,” said Dean. “Crowley would kill for better land to reward his higher ups with. Inspires loyalty or whatever. Other than that, just your standard asskissing. Who needs pride when you’ve got a war to win?”
Cas pauses. Dean light himself a cigarette and offers a second to Cas. He takes it, but doesn’t light it. Instead he fidgets with the thing in his hands.
It doesn’t help that Dean is so light and calm. Almost euphoric, if Sam had to put a word to it. He drives them out to bumfuck, Ohio just for a pie eating competition, dropping Miracle off at a kennel along the way. Although Dean is kind of a hardass with the people who work there to make sure Miracle is gonna be well taken care of, Sam is just relieved he didn’t insist on bringing Miracle along. It’s a little ridiculous how much time Dean spends with the dog these days. He starts to wonder if Miracle is a little like a canary in a coal mine. If Dean is waiting for the little guy to disappear again, and he can hold on as long as that doesn’t happen.
Castiel wasn’t sure which of these he was. Looking back, he was sure there was ample evidence for either or perhaps both. He knew the more reasonable people who had known him, Anna or Balthazar or Dean for that matter, would say stupidity each and every time. Someone with a little more tact might say he was just naive. Perhaps Samandriel would have branded him an optimist; he’d always been frighteningly kind that way before Castiel had gotten him killed.
And then he storms out of the room past everyone else. Cas watches him go, but he doesn’t follow. No one does. Jack starts to think someone should follow. He’s too weak to do it himself though, so no one does. Jack would have wanted someone to follow him.
“We’re getting close,” she said. “We need to ditch the cars here and walk in, or we’re gonna get shot. They’ll look like military vehicles from far off.”
He’d take another round in the Cage with fucking Lucifer over this. And if the only thing keeping Dean alive was Chuck’s shitty writing he’ll take that too. In a heartbeat.
“You mean, Charlie and Ash?” Castiel said as the Dean hit a button for one of the upper floors and the elevator began to stutter and start it’s way upwards. “I don’t understand how work is supposed to get done when they both respect each other so little.”
“Yes,” says Dean. And because he hates himself. “But hey, at least I wasn’t entertaining a fucking marriage proposal on the side-“
It took Castiel a moment to place the voice, not for lack of familiarity but for lack of any expectation to hear it any time in the near future. But he turned to look and there sat-
“I- I tried to run away,” Castiel started. Jack perked up immediately, sitting crosslegged as though meditating and waiting for the story to continue. Castiel didn’t have to look to know that Benjamin, Joseph and Isabella were listening in as well. He kept going, despite not particularly wanting them to know the details. “Naomi found me and she offered me a deal. If I became a state spy, she would return me to my garrison and my disobedience would be forgiven.”
Jo nodded at him. She stopped to find Charlie first aid kit and passed it to him, for which Castiel was grateful because he really needed to bandage this before he passed out from blood loss.
What was Cas supposed to say? That he didn’t know? Jo had told him as much about Charlie’s past. Charlie had tried multiple times to reach out to him, and he had repeatedly taken Jo’s side. Nothing Charlie was accusing him of was wrong.
“I think that trusting the people who have put their faith in you is the least that you can do,” said Cas. “Unless you want people to abandon their posts.”
He was lucky that the rest of his day would be spent with Lydia and Jo in the city. Since Dean had a large sum of state currency currently at his disposal, he was sending small groups into the city to obtain weapons from factories, alcohol, and other items of interest. There was a priority on hygiene products, which Jo had repeated to him five times, so he assumed it was important.
“Sometimes he’s even funny,” said Jo, nudging Cas in the arm. He couldn’t help smiling back at her insulting tone. “Sometimes.”
“About the cut or…?” Dean asks. Cas doesn’t answer him. Figures. “So what you’re here to get me out of trouble? Well. That’s swell. Am I gonna remember it this time?”
It had never occurred to Castiel before now that his disappearance might hurt Claire’s feelings. He knows there is affection between them, but he also knows there are numerous complications that come along with that affection. He does and does not remind her of her father, and sometimes it is hard for her to separate the both of them. It occurs to Cas that if Claire lives long enough (which she will) that she will have known him longer than her father. Know him in all his mistakes, all his misery, and all his growth. Meanwhile her father will remain a child’s memory.
“The wonderful thing about fingers is I have more than one,” said Cas. Dean stared at him again, his mouth twisting into a half grimace as though Castiel was the strangest thing he had ever seen.
Dean doesn’t know how Cas knows. Maybe he followed Dean out to make sure Dean got home alright, and that’s when he saw- Dean doesn’t want to think about it. He doesn’t want to think about anything. His bed still smells like Cas, and he tries not to think about the fact that Cas is staying across town at a motel. He promised Mary he’d stay for the wedding, but after that he’s going back to England.
“I told Risa why I was going again, and she said I had to bring someone along with me just in case and was pissed I’d gone alone in the first place,” said Sam. “So, I asked Trish to go with me.”
Selma tried to play the words off as a joke, but Castiel could tell there was honest worry behind them. He reached out and took Selma’s hand as a sign of comfort.
“It’s awesome,” Dean said. And then as the realization hit him that the voice he heard was the same as the poem’s author. “You wrote it?”
Was there an appeal in the power he had been given by Jack, one that even as it repelled him had been reassuring? It had given him confidence that he could change things he couldn’t on Earth. Except Heaven wasn’t made for humans. Just to contain them. There is no fixing what is already working perfectly for its intended purpose. Only trying to break it in a way that mutates it into something else. Maybe that had been a worthy goal, in some ways.
“I don’t even know why I’m surprised,” said Sam, shaking his head. “This has you written all over it.”
“But it’s already been two days,” he said. Castiel frowned, trying to grasp why that didn’t sound quite right, but not able to put his thoughts in anything resembling order.
Dean and Cas park at the end of a trailhead, a little ways away from where they’re supposed to be camping for the night. They don’t plan on staying, just waiting out their mark and hoping he makes an appearance. In the meantime, they are very much stuck together. Cas munches on a pack of sunflower seeds and Dean resists the urge to tell him for the tenth time that you’re not supposed to eat the shells. Figures he’ll find out the hard way.
Sam senses the unspoken part of that. She doesn’t have anywhere else to go. She’s a person, same as the rest of them. Same as Chuck. Sam has a feeling Chuck isn’t taking her in any time soon, either. It’s almost heartwrenching, the quiet realization she comes to in that instant that she is without her power and has no one in the entire world to call a friend. Sam looks at his brother, knowing he’ll understand the question he’s asking with a look alone. Then, with a silent confirmation from Dean easing any misgivings, he offers the only help and apology they can really give to Amara.
“I’m not in love with you anymore,” Castiel realized, saying it softly. It was a relief and something shameful at the same time. “Anna-“
Perhaps that was catastrophizing. Still, Cas took out one of his explosives from under the sole of his shoe and unwrapped the fireproof cloth it was kept in. Carefully, he set it down in the elevator. Then he tapped out a quick message to Charlie, hoping perhaps she could figure out something from her side. Perhaps she could even unlock the doors for them, though it wouldn’t be for a while. State regulations put delayed locks from anywhere between two to five minutes and a lot could happen in that amount of time.
“That’s true,” admitted Garth. “But Ira’s down too now, so I guess that just means five cities to go. Before this is all over.”
“The explosion was used to disperse a chemical agent that causes hallucinations,” Castiel said. “It’s a method of incapacitating the town so Zachariah can eliminate resistance forces without risking casualties. People are so consumed with fear or despair that they won’t be able to fight back Dean briefed everyone about this possibility.”
“Thank you,” Castiel said, eyes now glued to the floor for no discernible reason. “I really should go and find Selma. Lunch will be over soon, and I don’t want to distract from any work she’s assigned to-“
Dean frowned at him a moment and then opened the book again to a random page. He sat down on an armchair he had dragged closer to the bed, his feet resting on the edge of the memory foam mattress he had been so enthused about earlier. Cas personally thought it felt almost too soft. Like lying on cloud, he felt he might fall through it any second. Not that he would mind if the Earth opened beneath him to swallow him up.
“I would know,” says Cas. “It’s not as if- This body, it’s not the problem. And I know because Crowley, of all people, made sure to tell me that in excruciating detail. On more than one occasion, for the record.”
Castiel leaned up from his makeshift pillow to see Selma looking back at him in concern. Her brow was furrowed in concern that he didn’t deserve. He could feel himself frown at her, and lowered himself back down and closed his eyes.
Castiel didn’t know what she meant. He didn’t know why he couldn’t push her from his head, or why he knew deep down he didn’t want to. She betrayed the state and for all intents and purposes she should be dead to him in more than just the literal sense. And yet…
So Chuck left first his sister Amara, and then later his succession of wives and husbands to do most of the ruling. After the death of his most recent (and most beloved) wife, Rebecca Rosen, Chuck realized his own end was soon approaching and it was time to approach the subject of succession.
He can relax Dean’s features into satisfied contentment. Or purse his lips in barely veiled annoyance. He runs the gamut, depending on his mood.
“No reason. Just answer the question,” she said. Castiel was still trying to figure out how to answer when he was saved by Jo, who had probably seen them walking to the food tent and followed them in.
“It’s mine,” said Castiel, holding out his hand impatiently. It felt like she had a piece of his soul in her hand, and she was treating it with all the care of a child dissecting an insect.
“No. That was always me, wasn’t it?” said Cas. “I still miss you, but… I think that’s okay. I think I might be okay.”
Lucky for her, this plan seems to be working out better. She barely gets a nod from Cas before she launches herself forward, swinging her switchblade in a wide arc that the crocotta easily dodges. Just as he’s about to stab forward into her stomach, Cas is there, knocking the crocotta’s hand aside and slicing up the thing’s arm while he’s at it. Claire drops to the floor in an attempt to trip up the retreating crocotta, but misses her mark a little and only just rolls out of the way in time to avoid death by her own fucking sword.
“I don’t talk,” said Cas, as though it had been drilled into him. Which it had. Honestly Cas was surprised he wasn’t being forced to stay behind with Charlie. The only reason he could think of was that ordering him to stay behind would mean Dean would lose the spare manpower that came with Hael, Remiel, and Balthazar coming along.
“No, I don’t mean us, us,” she clarified. “I mean everyone. State, resistance, and the rest in between. I dislike you, because I’m half convinced you could do it, too. Raze everything to the ground without even realizing what you’re doing. I know it’s not your fault. They wanted weapons. That’s why the last Lightbringer stole resistance kids for his experiments. All of that horror, and Naomi just made you by accident.”
Jo frowned in thought. She seemed on the cusp of saying something when Selma broke into the silence.
It was almost as though Naomi could read those thoughts. At the very least she also thought of Anna, and Castiel’s willingness to do what she had said, even in the face of clear evidence she was disobeying orders. Her death was a moment that Castiel didn’t like to dwell on for existential reasons. Of course, he still found he could do little else.
“She had Kate drive in water from Lucrum,” explained Jess when Cas tilted his head in confusion. “She thought it might be similar stuff chemically. It makes you malleable. Takes away your will. We distilled it into a serum and started injected some into your IV. You were dying and we didn’t have anything else. It was worth a shot.”
He pushes himself up from the couch, reaching for his crutches. Tells Miracle to sit, when the little guy tries to follow him and tells everyone else he needs a bathroom break. There’s something strained about his voice, but he gets out of dodge before anyone can question him and stumbles off to the first floor bathroom.
It was a lot more garbled than Castiel meant for it to come out, but his words had started becoming sharp enough that he knew he would be understood.
“And my magic gave life to,” Rowena hissed. The boy looked away from her, knowing this was true. “Never forget, boy, I did you a favor. I stripped you of your name and freed you from your burdens and you agreed to give your will to me.”
“No they don’t. They came from me having detailed knowledge of how you tortured and killed multiple men,” said Cas, making Dean flinch. “Something you were forced to do, and that I don’t blame you for.”
“As you have every right to be,” said Cas. “I’m just pointing out he has more reason to… take it personally than Kevin does.”
“Don’t you dare question that,” said Dean. His voice dropped in volume a moment. “Emma, sweetheart…”
“It already is tomorrow,” said Cas. This is one of the least helpful things he could have said, and yet Dean found he respected the honesty. They were counting on one hell of a depressing Hail Mary, and Cas had risked more than most to get them to the fourth quarter of this twisted game. Or however football worked, Dean was more of a pro wrestling guy if he was being honest.
“It was meant as one,” said Cas, squarely shooting himself in the foot for no reason. Garth rolled his eyes. Castiel briefly wondered if Garth was actually human and, if so, where he’d learned his seemingly unlimited patience.
“We’ve been waiting,” she said, reaching out and unerringly finding Dean’s face. “I thought it was you. You know your nose whistles a little while you breathe?”
“If you keep them to yourself, I might be able to stop by a state medical facility the next time I report to Naomi and…. borrow some things for you. Small things,” Castiel rushed to add at the end, seeing the sudden gleam in Dr. Newman’s eyes.
“Jesus, Dean, I’m leaving,” she said quickly. She was out the door before Castiel could gather his wits. Dean was moving away from him, carefully crawling out of bed and making sure not to jostle Castiel’s wounds. He shut the door after Jo and pulled a bag towards him, looking through it for clean clothes.
The first time this happened, Dean had flinched away from him in terror. As if Castiel’s weakness revolted him. Now there is no hesitation, but Cas still imagines an echo of that same horror in the way Dean’s hands shake as he reaches for him.
“You picked a fight with me,” muttered Cas, putting extra emphasis on the you. “I only tried to win because you’re annoying.”
Once again he was back to that deeply troubled feeling. He shut the door softly behind him, and took a step toward Dean, who had started fidgeting in his sleep. Suddenly, he went completely rigid and his eyes snapped open. Before Cas could even take a step back, he had been knocked off his feet and found Dean’s hands wrapped around his throat.
“I know how to drive,” said Cas indignantly. “What if they ask questions? It hasn’t been long enough.”
That’s all that’s left of the person who raised him, who protected him, who made him into the man he is now. Nothing.
“My favorite thing about you is that you’re practical, and you know that getting to Libidine is more important than getting me out of here.”
“Maybe ‘official state policy’ is supposed to be okay with people like me, but Acedia sure wasn’t,” said Dean. “My dad sure wasn’t either. You know, he caught me blowing some other guy after a resistance meeting, once? I was seventeen. He beat the shit outta me with a crowbar to teach me a lesson. Made sure to stick to girls after that. But when I got sent to prison-“
“Dean willingly walked into a room with you alone despite knowing you were acting weird. I’m not convinced he can be smart about you,” said Sam. “And he’s obviously not telling me everything. I know you had your epiphany or whatever. And I know you didn’t try to kill Dean on purpose. That doesn’t mean you’re on our side.”
“You can’t just turn the psychobabble off,” he said. “Once you know how people work, it gets real fun trying to figure the tough ones out.”
“Yeah, they make a lot of trouble,” Jo said with a smile. “Though that’s nothing compared to Aditi and… and, uh, Tony.”
“C’mon, Cas,” Garth said. “You know what to do. Deep breaths. That’s it. You’re safe. No one is keeping you here. No one is going to hurt you. Deep breaths.”
Dean had asked him about it the night before. Cas had responded by saying he wanted to sleep, after which Dean had offered him use of the bed while he took the armchair. He’d also given Cas the copy of Cat’s Cradle he’d been reading with strict instructions not to write in this one. All in all, Dean seemed rather determined to get on his good side. Likely that meant something he really wouldn’t like was about to happen, and Castiel should be more worried about it.
“What? You’re nicer when she’s around. Don’t shoot the messenger,” says Patience. “Besides, Alex needs to make her shift at the hospital, and Kaia has the test for her GED coming up. You see another option besides us two?”
“But she and Charlie are not on the best of terms. Betty’s my friend too, and Jo is too smart to ask me to pick sides.”
All Dean can see is light. The barest outline of the kid he knew, and an imprint of something much bigger. It’s like living in two dimensions all your life and then getting a good look at a sphere, it doesn’t make sense and it’s kind of breaking Dean’s brain trying to comprehend it. Since his eyes haven’t burned out yet, he thinks he’s doing an okay job, though.
“No, I came here to jump your bones, and I got distracted and angry,” said Castiel. Dean choked on nothing. “Jo taught me that expression. I’m not sure I like it. Doesn’t it remind you of dancing on someone’s grave, jumping someone’s bones? Really the world would be a better place without the English language and sex.”
