about sex. He could easily ignore the attraction he  felt  for John, he was good at pretending that it wasn't there. Whenever he had been tempted to give in, thinking about Victor, about what had happened when he had left (because everyone left eventually), had been enough to stop him, to remind him that the work was enough. That he was above that.
It had all happened very quickly: the whistle coming from the black box, hadn’t even been a particularly shrill sound, nevertheless they had all moved as one: Drake and Harris bringing Sherlock and John outside the room, as he followed them.
It was still fine. It was logical. It was the voice of blood, it was a newborn baby girl, with deep blue eyes and blonde hair, whose resemblance with John was uncanny, there were no doubts she was his daughter.
Sherlock had not hesitated. He never did when it mattered to him: whether it was flinging himself from a rooftop, walking through the fire for him or shooting Magnussen.
a/n: first of all, sorry so so so sorry for the long delay, teaching training keeps me out of the house for about 14 hours everyday. I'm still writing, though:)
John took the card with a sigh, noticing that the doctor was still looking at his left hand; he didn’t say anything, for which John was grateful, even if he rationally knew that what happened between Mary and he was no one’s bloody business but his own.
He had clung onto him, for the first few seconds after, taking in big gulps of air against his neck – and John had stayed at his side, while nurses and the doctor silently left the room, giving them a modicum of privacy – not that Sherlock had been aware of them, not right then, while panting against his neck and taking fistfuls of his medical scrubs – wearing his clothes had proved to be impossible for John, after his shower – and John had let him, he hadn’t touched Sherlock, afraid of what his reaction might be, he had just been there, for him.
How simpler things would have been for all of them. John Watson, though, had not accepted the money, he had been already loyal to Sherlock and despite his abysmal error in judgement when he had married Mary Morstan, he still was.
It was the exact opposite of what he had felt in the house he had shared with Mary, even before she shot Sherlock and her past started haunting them. It was, perhaps, one of the reasons why he had had a bag ready, with a change of clothes in, only after one month of marriage. That cheery house in the suburbs, had not been home for him. It was as simple as that, really.
"You said that relationships were not your area..." John mumbled, feeling stupid because his mouth just could not shut up because he couldn't help it but want to know what had happened, how that man from Sherlock's past had contributed to making Sherlock the man he had met.
“What kind of data?” John had asked. And Sherlock’s curls were tickling his nose, and he didn’t feel bad because he was being left out, he was worried, but he was also, for some reason, hopeful because Sherlock and he were talking in bed like a normal couple would do. Happiness...was scary.
He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to be used as a pawn, again; he wanted to wake up and find out that it had been a nightmare, one even worse of those where he was the one torturing Sherlock, using his back as an ashtray or to check whether whips and knives and hooks still did what they were supposed to do or the ones where he was in that basement and hurt Sherlock.
“They didn’t kill her.” Anderson said. There was genuine disbelief in his voice – and it only echoed what she was feeling, what Greg must have felt before he called her.
The two men – he would not even bother to learn their names – were already in the room and Sherlock took a moment to observe the taller  of the two: he had assaulted him, a few hours earlier, there were clear signs on the man’s face. He clearly remembered how he had hit the man, over and over, how he had smashed the man’s head against the desk, the sound of breaking bones not fully registering with him, he hadn’t even felt the blood on his hand – somehow he had had the presence of mind of using his left hand, which was probably why the man in the room wasn’t in a hospital with a concussion.
“There are no explosives – but …” Lestrade trailed. And Sherlock saw – he saw that the man had been there at Barts for hours, he had been with Molly, drinking coffee (Molly had lied, but it had been an unimportant lie) while someone had brought that wrapped box to Molly and there was guilt in his eyes. He didn’t care. Lestrade was a grown man, he would have to deal with his feelings on his own.
And Sherlock should tell him that playing the game went against every fiber of his being, that time. He should tell him that he had fought alone for two years and although it had been dangerous it had been better than
He blinked his eyes, allowing those thoughts to invade his mind once again – and the pool was once again empty, it was once again midnight and he was younger, immensely naive and curious to finally meet Jim Moriarty, after days of wonderfully elegant challenges, except that he had not expected what had come later.
He didn’t comment on both Molly’s stupidity and Lestrade’s actions. He could feel blood seeping down his back, and he had to check his right hand, for a moment, to make sure he could move his fingers. That – was not the moment to go to pieces. That was not the moment to let his mind splinter and the rooms in his mind palace getting darker and darker.
They, whoever they were, wanted to destroy him, bit by bit. They wanted him wounded, scarred, humiliated and weak.
“No – it’s been months. I used to blink and a moment later, hours had passed, but not any longer.” Sherlock replied.
Jim Moriarty had threatened and almost succeeded in burning the heart out of him, but the man – had not had a heart, he had not understood how he ticked. Not really, not until the very end on the rooftop.
“We don’t have much time,” Mycroft said while he observed Sherlock tearing Herman Bennett’s cell apart.
He was not superstitious, far from it, he had never believed in foreboding,  but he was experiencing something similar now.
when they had met; he had dozens of tells, he couldn’t remember his lies, he couldn’t keep the  stories straight to save his life. It was endearing, actually.
Sherlock had written everything down in that letter: what had happened, why it had happened and how he had freed himself and obtained the information he needed.
He was close. He was – real and as tired and shattered as he was. He heard John shortening the distance between them: his gait showing how exhausted he felt. Why was he there? Why had he followed him? Didn’t he know? Couldn’t he understand that it was for the better?
“Brian Cooper,” Sherlock said before John could do or say anything more. He repeated the name he had previously said, his voice was low and laced with pain, but it didn’t stop him from trying and divert her attention from John.
"I think it's time, don't you?" John continued as if he hadn’t said anything in their sitting room. As if he didn’t
Sherlock made him laugh after nightmares that twisted his guts and made him want to crawl out of his own skin. Sherlock had nightmares too and his skin was cold, after, and he pretended not to notice because that was what he wanted. He touched him, though – and somehow things became bearable, for both of them.
It was the truth. She had no idea about how Mr Neal had pulled it off, she had not asked, there hadn’t really been any time to. She had just had the chance to send out the message that they needed something to keep Sherlock in London, she had never even got the reply.
It took Sherlock a moment to  realize that he was standing in the same position he had been in the night he had broken the mirror.
It was Sherlock's way to tell him, after days of blood, silences and words said in a too soft voice, that it was still
“It’s...” John trailed, but he was already up, taking the remote from the other bedside table in the room.
, and wouldn’t it have been grand if one of the agents that Mycroft had personally chosen for his protection had turned out to be an enemy? It was preposterous, and it had taken him but a look at the man’s eyes to see that it was only a matter of
“Sherlock...” , “John...” They spoke at the same time and maybe it was because of what had happened in Sherlock’s room, or the pictures he had seen, or maybe it was just the fact that underneath the red haze of anger, helplessness and rage he had felt for the past few days there was a single truth that was now hovering over them, warm and electric and good: he was
Sherlock was looking at him because ultimately it would be his choice: Catherine was his daughter and Sherlock had suspected Mary’s play.
John's hair was ruffled, stubble was shadowing his face, but he didn't look exhausted like he had for the past few days, he was also naked under his blue robe.
John nodded. That was good, wasn’t it? And Sherlock was standing near the fireplace, his body thin and perfect, his long hands on the mantelpiece and John – was afraid of moving. He just – couldn’t move a single muscle.
He couldn't dwell on those thoughts, though. It would serve no purpose; he couldn't change the past, neither of them could undo their mistakes,  he’d rather focus on Sherlock.
“What did you want to be?” She had asked him. They had been almost – almost but not quite drunk – he had smiled and said, “I don’t know – I don’t remember.”
“Yeah – and I really need to go, David.” John said. He felt like he was betraying Sherlock’s trust by indulging that man. He felt like he could burst, start talking and be hollowed out – and how could he be there for Sherlock if he did?
“May I take my coat?” She asked. And she wanted to roll her eyes when two of the agents escorted her pointing a taser at her back. Did they think she was completely stupid?
something real, because he felt like he was drowning in a sea of rage -- and neither of them deserved or could afford that.
Later, he would consider that some of that blood was his responsibility, that he had used his own brother – and brother in law -  as baits and the aftermath would weigh down on him, almost unexpectedly so.
Sherlock let out a breath: it wasn’t a sigh, it was – anguish, it was everything he hadn’t allowed himself to express while John Watson had been there, with him.
It had not taken long to reach the graveyard. He had more or less got a hold of his thoughts, he had banished the unwanted
And he was aware that neither John nor he had actually stopped skirting the words and what they entailed. But that (the pain, the smells, the noises Bennett had made, the texture of his heated flesh) was not important. Not really. Not at the moment. He was not falling apart because of that.
“Why would you want to let me go?” John asked, “How do I know you won’t kill me the second I get out of here?”
Mycroft nodded and Anthea said that they were examining the records, they had been since she had uttered that name, but so far they had not found one single building belonging to either an Emily Abel or Emily Cooper or any combination of the known aliases Mary had used.
Another lie, but it seemed to work on William Moore, because the man’s shoulders relaxed slightly. It seemed strange to John that Sherlock had not asked any more questions about the note. He hadn’t even known about the note until a few minutes before they had arrived to the flat. Apparently, though, Sherlock had known – Greg must have told him when he hadn’t been in the room. He had questions about the note, about its contents; somehow he suspected that it was yet another attempt to fuck with Sherlock, like Bennett’s victims or the pictures sent to him.
He was refusing morphine or anything stronger than paracetamol. Because of course Sherlock had to choose that moment to stay clean, right when his body needed to heal!
"Good question, Molly Hooper," Sherlock replied. And he sounded like he had the night he had asked for her help.
He hated the way that man was saying his name, he hated that his daughter’s life depended on whether that man would tell him a stupid numerical code. He hated that Sherlock was watching him, in that moment, and he could not tell him the truth – even if he would fall into a trap, meant to – destroy him. He could only hope that Mycroft would use him in a way that would save his daughter’s life and Sherlock’s.
There was genuine sentiment in the woman’s voice, she was telling the truth, and it was abundantly clear from her stomach underneath the white shirt she was wearing that she wasn’t pregnant any longer.
His mobile phone had been surely found,  but perhaps they hadn't found the GPS device Mycroft had given him right away. Sherlock was surely looking for him because that was what
They had tried to break him: his body and pride with Herman Bennett. They had reminded him that they knew that he had a heart, that everyone had pressure points...using foils, stand-ins for John and he.
There was a blindfold, an iPod, and headphones on the floor and he absolutely refused to let his mind dwell on those objects. It was Drake who took the items and listened for a second to whatever was coming out of those headphones.
William and Joan – stand-ins for John and him. Victor, his first love. Janine – a friend, a very public girlfriend. Men and women bearing a resemblance to him. Oh, yes. It was
Death was in the pictures he spotted on the walls as he entered the smallroom that led to the basement. "Fuck, there are more!" He heard someone say behind him.
“Why?”Sherlock asked and John could hear him, loud and clear. “I had thought you of all people would respect me, John.”
John shook his head. He would not tell that man, it was none of his fucking business and Sherlock was in the other room, he could hear his voice, he was talking to Lestrade, giving orders as if nothing had happened – but he knew that he was listening. He wondered for a moment why Sherlock had left him in the kitchenette with the other man, because if he had learned one thing the hard way about Sherlock Holmes was that there was always a purpose behind his actions – even if in that particular case he could not really understand them, because what could he do except telling William Moore that he should go to the A&E, have x-rays done and swallow some pain killers?
“You kept your word. You said you wouldn’t go anywhere. I must say that I wasn’t sure you would.” Mycroft continued, ignoring him.
John had not said another word, after, but Sherlock had known that the man, his lover, had been still keeping something from him.
Molly has stopped chatting with the second violin. The cellists who haven’t already left are staring at him. Their eyes are all full of pity for Lestrade and confusion about why Sherlock is still here in the first place.
There are more pleasantries and Sherlock leads John upstairs, stopping to wait for him to hobble up to the flat but never apologizing for the stairs. It’s not as if John will need the cane for long anyway.
Sherlock smirks as John leans over the cot to check on Rosie. He knows Sherlock has tucked her in correctly, that everything’s fine, but he has to look in on her anyway.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes, obviously.” They were just something to do to pass the time anyway. And now that time has passed.
“Hmmmrph, no.” Sherlock worms his way, face first, deeper into the pillows. He has one under his head and one under his arm, which means he must have John’s as well. He’s too tired to care or worry about turning the alarm off on his phone. John will see to it eventually.
John ran his hands from the middle of Sherlock’s thighs, over the curve of his arse, to the dip of his waist. He pressed himself fully along Sherlock’s back, where he could settle his cock in the divot between Sherlock’s cheeks and see a view of the city over Sherlock’s shoulder.
John had his cock out of his breeches and was pushing into Sherlock’s hole before Sherlock could finish complaining.
“He had a lisp. Just a slight one, when he spoke. I’m sure he would have grown out of it in time…” Sherlock’s voice cracks as the vines around his heart tighten. He can’t hear Victor’s voice but he knows,
If only he’d been able to see how red Mycroft’s neck became, he could have said how long ago she walked out.
One of John’s hands drops to Sherlock’s hip to hold him steady. Sherlock misses the warmth of John’s arm locked around his chest, but the pressure of John’s finger tips wrapping around his hipbone makes him bite his lip to keep from crying out again.
“John, John, John…” Sherlock panted. His knuckles were white where he gripped the balustrade and his arse grasped more tightly at John’s cock with every thrust. Sweat beaded at the base of his neck and John leaned forward to lick it away. Sherlock was getting close, and so was John.
“I had heard rumours about a monster who lived in the belfry, but I thought he was supposed to be too hideous to be seen by decent people. That’s certainly not you.”
It takes John a split second to switch his focus back to Sherlock. This man makes him feel so off balance. “I’m sorry, what?”
Sherlock wasn’t inhibited by it. He could work just fine with that burned out section of his vision still in place. They’d chalked it up to some traumas never leaving a man completely and gone on as they were.
Lestrade starts with the flutes, which Sherlock hates. They sound thin and screechy, but at least there aren't any piccolos today. They also hear two struggling oboists and Sherlock hates them even more.
They didn’t speak until John had tucked them both into Sherlock’s bed and pulled the covers up to their shoulders. They lay facing each other, a handsbreadth apart. Sherlock listened to John’s breathing. It wasn’t the gradual slide into deep and rhythmic breathing that indicated sleep. So Sherlock waited, watching John. Tension grew like a visible thread linking them together.
Sherlock took another step toward him. The balustrade was already at John’s back but he was unafraid.
John feels an unexpected, inexplicable shock of hope and excitement pierce his heart. “Who was the first?”
He stays stretched out, sweat and come and steam sliding down his chest and belly, for a few long moments. This is the most relaxed Sherlock has felt in ages. He wipes the wet mess from his skin, drops his towel to the floor, and strides past the stranger entirely naked.
This time Sherlock sucked on his earlobe and nipped at the skin under his jaw before replying. “It’s written in the way you stand, the way your challenge even a stranger, and the way your cock strains against your breeches.”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.” Sherlock stops clattering away on the lab’s computer to look at John. “Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”
Some nights, he thinks of their life together as a happy affair. John would still be at Bart’s, Sherlock would be back at uni or maybe starting a career in finance or some such bullshit. John knows nothing about him, doesn’t know what he does or what he wants to do. But it doesn’t matter. The fact that John can tell the difference between vermillion and blood red means that they could work it out. They were already perfect for each other.
Mrs Hudson opens the door behind him and he goes willingly into her embrace. Things are still very uncertain, chaotic even, and the hug is more grounding than Sherlock would like to admit.
“Is that it?” Sherlock looks back at John’s question and at least he’s gotten Sherlock to pause before leaving.
Lestrade matches Sherlock’s shouting. “Yeah, cocaine withdrawal makes for shaky hands. Terrible trait in a violinist.”
John gets all that from Holmes’s chart. That’s all the information he generally wants or needs about a patient. But he wants to know what makes Sherlock laugh, what his favorite food is, if he’s ever seen
Sherlock expects John to take a step back. That’s what most people do when faced with the burning lash of Sherlock’s tongue. Instead, John grips the handle of his cane until his knuckles turn white. A soldier indeed.
That was not enough to make John drop his hand away from his sword. “You’re a fortune teller? You should be down at the festival.”
He’s been on so many cases without John. There were cases before John, adventures while Sherlock was “dead”, and cases taken while John was on the other side of London. But it gets harder and harder to leave him behind.
Sherlock rolls so he can see the light from the street lamps ghosting through the windows. He feels John settle in behind him.
There had been times when Sherlock was sure they were moving this direction, before Mary and after. Sometimes that surety is met with joy, other times with fear. This is never how he imagined it. In Sherlock’s imagined scenarios, it is never a slow, warm realization in a domestic moment. It’s fueled by adrenaline or the threat of loss. Never by comfort and affection.
“So, your soulmate doesn’t like that you’ve been removed from your normal duties but you don’t care. You’re happy about it.”
Sherlock nods. John still questions his care of Rosie. Questions if it’s an imposition, if Sherlock is really fine with lending his support. He’s more than fine. It’s one of the things he’s come to cherish most in the world. But the thought of telling John that makes his mouth go dry and a lump stick in his throat.
John rubs the heel of hand across his brow. It takes him a moment. Sherlock can see him run through possible arguments, dismiss them, and finally give in to his aches and pains. “Yeah, all right.”
He washes, careful to keep his sleeves dry but still scrub all the way up to his elbows. John comes to stand behind him and wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist and rests his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. They stand for a quiet moment and Sherlock is struck by his own future, stretched out before him as obvious to him as a criminal’s bloody footprints tracking across London.
Sherlock cleared his throat. If he was going to fall, to jump, he needed to be specific. “What do you need to know?”
She didn’t object when two agents flanked her, tasers still pointed at her back and the others watched the perimeter (they were good. Highly trained, clearly used to those sort of operations.)
He should have done that before. He should have let John’s arms loop around his sides (his back hurt, there was the chance he might have pulled a few stitches, they were supposed to come off in a couple of days anyway and he did
The only silver lining, he had hoped, had been that not even Sherlock could deduce someone in the dark.
He was in Serbia, running and running, knowing that they would get him, that he didn’t have any weapon on him, that John, in his mind, was urging him to keep running but the balance of probability told him that he would be caught. He would be hurt.
The tallest of the two men – the one who had physically shot Janine, Sherlock deduced – smiled and said, “You are not asking any questions.”
He had put the waltz Sherlock had composed for his wedding in an envelope and had had Molly give it to him with harsh words. He had been hurting, he had been misplacing blames and lash out at Sherlock thinking he would not care. Not really.
they were not there, pretend that he was the same man he used to be, pretend that he had not changed.
A particular brand of tea would make him think about quiet breakfasts in the sitting room while Sherlock fidgeted in his chair trying to find a comfortable position to sit in. He would come to hate the smell of a particular brand of antibiotic.
He had learned Serbian – and it had taken him longer than what he was accustomed to because he had been
People said that Sherlock Holmes was an uncaring, sociopathic bastard. They hadn't seen him going on a mission on his own because his friend, John Watson, had been threatened; they hadn't seen placing tentative fingers, meant to offer comfort, on Joan's shoulder, as she was wheeled away from that warehouse. They hadn't seen him shaking his head at his words of gratitude, and looking exhausted, at the same time.
He had found Joan Adams like he had told William Moore he would do. He had been alone, because he still believed that “alone protects me” bullshit, and he had given him an excuse, a valid one to revert to that behavior. It didn’t matter that he had initially wanted to honor his request, that he had resigned himself to spend hours sorting through piles of files, pretending that he was doing something useful because Sherlock had asked him to, because after what had happened in Herman Bennett’s bedroom he would have done anything he asked him to do.
Sherlock sighed. "A few night stands while high on cocaine don't count."  The itching was almost intolerable, now. He felt like there were ants crawling underneath his skin wanting to come out.
Sherlock Holmes had discovered a lot of things since he had jumped from Bart’s rooftop.  He had discovered, for example, that he might be a SIS, on paper, so to speak: Mycroft had been creative with his status within the secret services, but fieldwork, real fieldwork, in foreign countries, was not exactly his milieu. His past affiliation with the British intelligence had not included those sort of things.
Molly had hugged him before he left, and if it had been a movie there would have been words exchanged, or he would have just kissed her goodbye. He had not kissed her, but her hand had been on his cheek and she had told him to be careful, to come back.
“You are thinking,” Sherlock said, it was a whisper that danced on his skin and John felt, once again, how inevitable that moment had been: Sherlock’s lips against his skin, his fingertips ghosting over his skin, the warm cocoon their bodies had created.
Not being able to move, not being able to tune out his own thoughts, the white noise growing louder and louder in his ears, the darkness, the faint smell of paint and bleach made him cry out for his daughter, eventually.
“I shall not relapse, brother mine.” Sherlock said, a hint of himself in his voice. That was good, he could work with that.
She wasn't, she really wasn't. That was one of the reasons for John's anger and for the way Sherlock was not moving in his chair. She had been informed by John of the threat and she had taken it in stride; it was clear that she was used to operating on a need to know basis.
Despite what he had told John in that warehouse (and how could they know about that specific location? How could they be privy of the memories and events attached to it?) he still had not said a word.
Maybe it was the wrong thing to say, but he couldn’t stop the words that came out of his mouth. Sherlock’s hands were warm on his face and John wanted nothing more than lean into the man’s touch, close his eyes and pretend that the last few minutes had not happened, and he knew that Sherlock would have appreciated that, he would have been grateful, perhaps, or relieved. But – he had thought he was not blind any more, hadn’t he? He could not go back to that way of thinking.
Perhaps, she would have just told him that they had waited so long, therefore, a few more months would not make any difference.
(and they were: there would never be anyone else for him; there hadn't truly been, not since that first mad chase through London chasing a cab and an American tourist.), so he didn't hesitate, he entered the room, their bedroom, and saw Sherlock near the window; he was dressed, it wouldn't be long until Drake and Harris escorted him to Mycroft's car for their daily meeting.
William Moore didn’t know Jim Moriarty, he had been stationed in New Zealand at the time he had played his games with Sherlock Holmes. And shortly after that, he had met Joan and left his job, for her – for their future.
The broken mirror was still there, reflecting just parts of him. He recognized the man in the mirror, and that – was
He had been weak when he had accepted it, he had – welcomed the physical numbness, and he felt that he should have focused on the pain, instead. If he had, he would have seen things more clearly, he would have seen through John’s deception, however filled with good intentions it had been.
Both Mary’s grip on the gun and her voice were firm; she was not an amateur, but she was also human, despite everything – and he clearly heard the contempt in her voice as she said those words.
fine. He had not been fine for a long time. He had ceased to be whole a long time before and the events of the past few years had hurt him, in ways he had not anticipated, they had widened the cracks that had been already there.
Herman Bennett had not given them a deadline, there hadn’t been one in the white box filled with pictures, but Sherlock knew that they didn’t have much time.
“Yes, and Mycroft believes that withholding information will make things better, somehow.” He shook his head, there was genuine disappointment in his voice.
“No.” Mr. Neal replied, “I have some errands to run here. You are all doing a good job. I’m counting on you. Do not disappoint me.”
“She will be safe from this moment on, she will be moved to a safe house, would it make you feel better?” Sherlock said.
He remembered those moments. He deduced right away that John wanted to know, that he wanted to ask him whether he had heard him while he was on the pavement outside St. Bart's, he wasn't talking, though -- because it was simply too painful. It was etched in every wrinkle on his face, in his body language, in his stunned silence.
She had given birth – but clearly, she had been hit (John, most probably, at least judging by the bruises on the doctor’s face and the bullet on his upper forearm) and it had caused damages.
She had seen how he recruited people, how he seamlessly spotted people’s insecurities, weaknesses, ideas and latched onto them, becoming indispensable for them. No one knew his real name, but he remembered each and every single person who worked for or against him. It was remarkable.
, who had claimed to be Sherlock’s girlfriend. The young nurse, who had just come back from her maternity leave, despite all the whispers and gossip, hadn’t known a thing about what had happened to Sherlock; the poor woman had been mortified when she had known that she had been an unwitting accomplice in a threat to Sherlock.
wonder what had changed between the two men for the past few hours – it didn’t really matter, it was none of his bloody business anyway, but he couldn’t help a small sigh of relief, one he hoped Sherlock didn’t notice (yes, he
He took the sheet of paper in his hand – the instructions were clear and he followed them. He shut down his mobile phone, took the battery off and placed it on the night table. He did the same with John’s mobile. He took the mobile phone he found at the pool.
It’s high time you accepted that!”) had been oddly comforting to John; even if he had felt a twinge of sympathy for the man, who had simply accepted Sherlock’s verbal attack, with his head cocked on a side, blinking once behind his glasses.
him to love Sherlock as much as he did? Would she turn a blind eye, pretending not to know that things had changed between Sherlock and he, all in the name – of what, exactly?
And it didn’t matter whether Mycroft would find him or not – Mary was in no rush. It only took a moment to pull a trigger and end a life. He should know.
"I have been tortured and abused. Yes, I'm aware." Sherlock said and he was surprised when his tone wasn't dismissive or scathing. He was also surprised by how easily the words had come out of his mouth; without denial, without (shame) hesitation.
Sherlock, apparently, was satisfied with what he saw in his eyes because he added, “I told Moriarty that I was prepared to do what others couldn’t. That I was prepared to burn.”
Sherlock had never said those words aloud and he didn’t care – Sherlock Holmes loved him. He was promising him – reassuring him that they would see the end of that mess. He was promising him a future, and he wanted to believe him.
That time had been different. He had suspected Herman Bennett was obsessed with him, that he would try and bargain somehow – that was why he had left his notebook on Lestrade’s desk, but it had been just a precaution. He had thought they would catch Herman Bennett, save the girl and go home. He had thought he would disarm the man and move on.
Sherlock nodded, “I know,” he said, “I called him. I – “He gritted his teeth, and John suspected that whatever Sherlock was going to tell, it would have something to do with the past few months. “The day you were taken, I thought that if I survived I would consider seeking help. I am, now.” He sighed and said, “How does it work?”
While he waited for the man he loved to come back to bed (and he would, he would not make a sound, even if John knew that the stitches must hurt and his hands were cold and clammy), elsewhere in London, in a private room in the same hospital where Sherlock had been admitted after being tortured by Herman Bennett, William Moore was watching his fiancee finally sleep.
It had taken Sherlock just a few seconds while they had been in Herman Bennett’s basement to spot the precise location of the hidden cameras. He wasn’t divulging any information, now.  Greg looked at John,  he still looked ready to move, to fight – but there was something else…a look of devotion in his eyes, while he kept looking at Sherlock angling his body toward the other man’s, totally oblivious of his surroundings, spoke volumes about those
He was at Baker Street, surrounded by people: trained agents who were shielding him, Mycroft talking, saying things he couldn’t care less about. He could smell his own blood, he could smell those men: soaps, shampoos, skin –
There were moments where John could almost pretend that nothing had happened, that somehow they had been granted yet another miracle and had turned back time to
Sherlock didn’t reply. The truth was that Victor had not wanted their relationship to be public, at the time. It was something he wasn't particularly fond of remembering, even if it was necessary. Mycroft knew that. He had been aware of the nature of his relationship with Victor at the time, only remarking on it after Victor had left. He realised while looking at Mycroft that his brother had never, not once, expressed any judgment on his choice to abide by Victor’s wish.  He had used that knowledge to push his buttons, to make him work for him, but he had never asked him why he had abided to Victor’s request, what exactly had happened. He had been
He hadn’t seen Victor for almost two decades, he was part of his past - of things he wasn’t particularly fond of remembering, of something he had actively tried to delete. It was so easy to admit, now, that Victor had broken his heart and that he had done the same to him - and the thing was he didn’t
He followed Drake outside, he could see the wheels turning in his head – and his own instinct was telling him that something didn’t add up. He was not a genius, he was not Sherlock Holmes, but – things felt
Mary seemed to consider his words, her smile grew bolder before she said, "In that case I would cut a deal with Mycroft Holmes," she looked at him and he knew she wasn't bluffing when she said, "Believe me, he would listen. He would be very much interested in what I know."
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, John knew him enough to predict all the sort of rebuttals he might have used, but he chose not to.
People like him (freaks, cold unfeeling arseholes, fucking psychopaths, and cockteases) were supposed to be
He steeled himself for what was about to come. They would not kill him, not yet – and so far pain was manageable.
It had. She was right. The pieces of the puzzle were finally slotting into place and after so long feeling like the truth was right outside his grasp, he was seeing it – and part of him was relieved. It was different when he knew his opponents, it was different when he could see and observe.
Except that for a moment it had been better, because he had seen the naked look in Sherlock’s eyes, the love for him and something else, something fierce and primeval – something that he felt in his own veins as well: the need to protect, to make sure that whatever happened the other would be safe. It hadn’t lasted long, of course, and Sherlock hadn’t said another word after; not while they were getting out of the hospital, avoiding photographers and journalists, not in the car, while Lestrade informed them of the first stop of the day and gave them details about Joan Adams’s kidnapping that hadn’t been divulged by the press.
for a case, he would say, but it was a feeble lie, one he would almost feel shame for, because he had always owned his vice, his
Sherlock opened the door and blinked. He looked pale and still had shadows under his eyes, he was wearing his Shezza attire, but he was clean – well, except for the dirt on his face and hands.
“Very well.” Mycroft said, refraining from commenting on Mary, “You should rest, John. You do look tired.” He gave him a smile and said, “Mrs. Hudson, Detective Inspector Lestrade, Miss Hooper and your wife are all under surveillance, as a precaution.”
information, then. They didn’t know where John and the baby were, though – whoever was at the top wouldn’t take such a risk.
. John blinked his eyes, he felt it, even before it actually happened. He moved, as quickly as he could, especially when he heard the soft, almost muffled noise coming from Herman Bennett’s mouth.
He had not known Mary at the time; if he had he would have advised her to let him deal with everything, he would have asked her not to compromise her identity, and he knew that she wouldn't have listened to him, not about that.
For a moment he wasn't sure whether the man had heard him, he was completely focused on Joan, taking in every detail about her, he eventually replied without even looking at him and said,
Thank you so much for all the kind words, about the story. RL has been so time consuming that I could not reply to you guys, but believe me, each feedback is treasured and loved! Sorry for the delay in updating, I'm finally finished with teacher training, therefore I will have more time both to write and update:)
There weren’t many people in the bunker: just Mycroft, Anthea, Drake, Molly, Anderson and Harris who had just got in after leaving the hospital against medical advice and him. He had no idea why Anderson was still there but, apparently, Mycroft trusted him far more than some of his men at the moment. Not that he blamed him, at that point.
“We are examining the evidence,” Mycroft replied, “there is a video. She was shot to the head. The only confirmation we have, so far, is that the video has not been altered in any way.”
He wasn’t wearing glasses, he was dressed casually, but he now could see clearly what Sherlock had deduced right away the day they had met: the man was a SIS, even if he had retired.
John – John was still worried about him, their bodies had been so close, in that bathroom, he had felt the man’s breath against him, he was his lover – and he had lied to him, was still hiding things from him, his voice had been harsh, in the car, when he had told him that it wasn’t about him, that time. And Sherlock wanted him to be away, far away from there – where he would be safe, where he wouldn’t have to see, hear, witness what he would do when he’d find the people behind all of that.
“Why do you need to talk to Joan?” He asked after a moment. She had agreed to help, but he needed to know why, exactly.
“Mr Bennett went to extreme lengths to cover up his financial records and it proved to be even more difficult to retrieve useful data from his mobile phones and computers.” Anthea said.
John was trying to get on his knees, and he could not afford to call out his name, not now. John – his John, had been used as a pawn in that game, and it was his own fault – but that could not be his fight. He would not allow that to happen. Round and round he went – but the core never changed: he would always try and protect John, even from himself.
The matter of the fact was that they had used his little brother as distraction  while gaining power in the background. It was a power play: using Moriarty’s name, the murders of people who bore a resemblance to his brother, the kidnappings – it was just the tip of the iceberg – and he had been too busy, too worried to really notice.
The woman had chosen the place where to meet; he had conceded it because she was the one who was risking her own life.
It was easy to see - to understand, and he could only postulate what would have happened had he acted differently.
Love was a vicious motivator, but it was heartbreak that was stopping Mary from asking what she truly wanted to know.
“They’re following the money, but Ms Morstan knew how to hide her tracks.” The man replied, “I have been informed that Mr Holmes has set up a task force.”
He had insisted on driving on the way back to London and Sherlock had not said a word about it. He had not looked at the picture, he had put it in the inside pocket of his coat and had ignored him.
She did not seem to care about wasting time, she did not seem to mind about the eventuality of being caught, if anything she looked calm, as if she had all the time in the world.
John got up, he shook Mycroft’s hand, “I don’t care. She is dead,” He paused and asked, “because she is dead, isn’t she? You didn’t hide her somewhere to get her to talk.”
When had Sherlock started to think that being a martyr for him was a good idea? Why was it so easy for him to accept and approve the idea that he would ever trade his life for his daughter’s? Why wasn’t he angry at the thought that he would ever betray him?
“No, you are not. And you were not fine with it, were you?” Victor said, and it unsettled Sherlock  the way Victor had so easily read through him, how that word had brought back something that belonged to the past and how they  had both thought about it.
Mary tilted her hands up, "I don't want to know." She said with a little smirk. But she was looking at his right hand: it wasn't as bad as it had been the week before, but there were still some stitches, it was still sore, it was  still a weakness Mary was very much aware of.
That was not the moment for one of their feuds. It wasn't even the moment to remind Mycroft about their past, about the way it had been perfectly
He could get out of that room, refuse to play – and three people would die. He could keep playing and there was no guarantee that Victor, Mary, and the baby would be safe, but he
“You will not be there,” John whispered and pleasure was building up in his body, he could feel his toes curling, and he hated that.
“You proved your point, but you still have not answered my question: what do you want?” He asked because there had to be something she wanted. She had waited too long to just have him in a Plexiglas cell watching her shooting John.
He sighed. He had been surprised when Mycroft had not kidnapped his therapist to either know what his intentions were or to bribe him into revealing the contents of their sessions. He had told Doctor Hood about what had happened and how he hadn’t talked to his brother since the day he had allowed John to be taken and the man tried to broach the subject, about once per session.
. She had hid that part of  her, and he had never asked Sherlock whether she had smiled before shooting him – come to think of it, he had never asked a bloody thing about that night. Sherlock had asked him to trust him and he had, no questions asked.
. That was good. Herman Bennett had long, deep shadows under his bloodshot eyes, he was keeping his head slightly tilted down as the guards brought him into the room and swallowed when they made him sit.
He had left because MIT wanted him because he was too good at what he did because, "Living with you, loving
When Sherlock Holmes met John Watson he hadn't had sex for about five years. He had not missed it, on the contrary, life had become simpler, cleaner, free from useless distractions.
behind it all or the endgame,  she only cared about a part of it and she had wanted (needed) that job. She had made it impossible for
with Sherlock, he had been for so long that it was now part of him, like the fact that he was left handed, slept on his back and was British.
There was something written behind the picture, two words – instructions, Sherlock realised: house and phone.
Motives never changed, that was one of the first things Sherlock had learned when he had started solving crimes: hate, money, envy, love, revenge – all the crimes he had solved all had one or more of those motives in common. It was rather dull, truth be told – he had never been particularly interested in the psychology of motives,  it could help piecing things together, but it had never been what interested him.
“Of course, you will.” Sherlock said. He smiled, but Mycroft was sure that it was the sort of smile he had reserved to the people he had hunted down and disposed of while being away from London. Sherlock rose up from his seat and added, “if the greater good doesn’t keep you otherwise engaged, that is –“
He hated the silence between the two men, he hated that he could read the silence between them and it was filled with all the things that had happened for the past few days. He hated the fact that they were all tiptoeing around Sherlock, treating him like china and that Sherlock was allowing them to by not talking unless it was absolutely necessary, by pretending to sleep when he bloody well knew that he wasn’t, by being soft spoken and distant – in a way that he had never been, not with him at least.
She wasn't wearing her rings, of course - those were in a drawer in John's old room, she was wearing something John has given her, though: a necklace, she kept playing with the pendant, as she waited for one of them to answer her.
They had fought: because Sherlock had not hesitated to use that knife on himself, even if he had known that it was useless.
He noticed that Sherlock was keeping his right hand on his knee, perfectly still, and  that – that was
She had asked Mr. Neal, at the very beginning, why he didn’t get rid of Sherlock Holmes right when he was more vulnerable, while he was alone, especially because it would be more convenient for his plan.
“We won’t be left alone.” The short man said and Sherlock could deduce myriads of details about the man and he had to smile.
to understand some of it; his mind couldn’t really wrap itself around the horror that was unveiling in front of him, room after room, step after step.
The night he had smashed his hand against the mirror he had lived the whole experience, until John had kissed him, with detachment: one minute his head had been filled to the brim with faces of people he had killed, people who had tried to kill him and had almost succeeded, with Magnussen’s lips against his skin and a moment later it had all gone away, leaving behind a tabula rasa, no feeling at all, not even physical pain.
excuses. John had been taken for the same reason – his temporary paralysis, his inability to see, to act, to be, simply put,
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow at him and Greg glimpsed relief in the younger man’s eyes, nevertheless he made an impatient gesture with his hand, silently inviting him to continue. “Here’s how is going to work: you will not disappear, you will keep all of us informed, you won’t strain yourself or so help me –”
The content of those rooms: images, sounds, textures and smells had been allowed to fester and to spread,  like cancer,  and that was intolerable. He was aware that keeping those doors tightly shut would not solve the problem, that he would have to go back and open those doors again if he wanted to actually come back to a reasonable facsimile of how his life used to be, but it was the best he could do at the moment. It was the only thing he could conceivably do.
He was a rational man, he was used to making choices and sacrificing people for the greater good. Because the matter of the fact was not that those people wanted to hurt Sherlock or destroy him.
Lestrade was talking, undoubtedly asking him what he had been thinking. He looked worried, people had said for years that he was a freak, a psychopath – and if Sally Donovan had been there, in that moment, she would have smirked, looked at Lestrade and John and gloat.
Mycroft moved a step and Sherlock talked, his voice was calm, casual, he was buttoning his trousers, he didn’t even look at him when he said, “Fair warning, Mycroft, if you enter this room I will break your nose.”
He was in love with Sherlock Holmes. He had been in love with him – had tried everything he could to fall out of love with him, had tried hard to love Mary and had failed.
He wasn’t enquiring after her state of mind, he would only do that in case he suspected she was not up to the task assigned to her. No. He was asking her whether her cover was solid enough to withhold Mycroft Holmes’ investigations once their paths would cross.
And yet, when that morning Sherlock had showed up on a crime scene, all fluid movements, cockiness and geniality, with John in tow he had felt happy, lighter and after their murderer had been apprehended he had called Molly and invited her out for dinner.
John was exactly two steps behind Sherlock, while the consulting detective took his time examining the sheet of paper: he didn't read the note right away, he smelled it first, looked at it, examining it under the light of one of the large windows in the room, letting out an annoyed snort when Harris moved to stand next to him (and to be honest Lestrade was tempted to do the same).
“Chicago, isn’t it?” Sherlock asked, interrupting John and she had to smile because Sherlock would open all the remaining boxes if she asked, in order to shut John up,  not to let the man hear and know both how far he had gone and how not okay he had been for a very long time.
Greg was with Sherlock on official capacity, for a few follow up questions, despite the two statements, the pictures and the medical chart, despite the fact that they had Bennett in custody, and despite Mycroft’s involvement. It had been Greg who had wanted to talk to Sherlock alone and, once again, Sherlock had not objected. He rarely had objected to pretty much anything for the past couple of days, John thought.
There was a moment where Greg could see how things would go if they got right back inside. He would end up forgetting, or pretending to, how warm Molly's skin was, how beautiful she had looked just moments before....
Herman Bennett had been obsessed with Sherlock, that was one of the things he had told him two nights before when he had told him about what had happened in the basement, but he had already seen that. He had already known that.
He had many enemies, but he had not realised how many friends he had made through the years, the loyalty of how many people he had gained until a psychopath kidnapped him, thus starting the chain of events that had brought him there.
Besides, Victor had said the truth, again: no one had known about them from him. Yet he said, “That is not why I am here...”
John didn’t reply. It was the truth, at least part of it was. It had taken him a long time to realize that Sherlock didn’t waste time with empathy for the victims, he often didn’t even bother to learn their names or faces (or deleted them) because it would not help them. He ran himself to the ground trying to solve cases, though and the game was only one of the reasons why he did. Because he had seen him offering himself up as a hostage, his hands tilted up, while a psychopath had held a bloodied and traumatized teenager – he had saved the victim, even if he had known what Bennett was capable of. He had followed Bennett because he had said what Moriarty had told him that day on the rooftop, when he had fallen to save the people he loved. He was many things, but he wasn’t
He didn’t sound petulant, or despondent as he often did with Mycroft – he sounded exhausted. And Mycroft did too for a moment, nevertheless the older man gave him a tight lipped smile and said, “If you’ll be so kind as to wait outside for a moment, John? I’ll be right there.”
He barely resisted that urge, though, when one of the men took his daughter away. She was crying, now. He had not imagined hearing his daughter cry would tear through him like that. All the things he had read about paternal instinct, the voice of blood
No – she wanted her revenge and her games, she didn’t want to relinquish the power she had over him – them. Not just yet.
Yes. He would. He was the British Government, after all. He would deal with the newest threat, he would only have to sacrifice another sibling to his Country and find the new spider, the new criminal mastermind who had to get rid to the last vestige of Moriarty’s reign: the consulting detective that had been Moriarty’s equal, his obsession, the cause of his ultimate demise.
Mycroft held the bright, yellow envelope in his hands for a moment as he got up from the bed. He spared a brief glance at John before giving the envelope to Sherlock, without saying a word, and John didn’t want to see the pictures. He wanted Sherlock to ignore the content of that envelope.
Mycroft Holmes told them that Sherlock had accomplished something unprecedented when he had, almost singlehandedly, taken down Moriarty’s web.
“What happened to Sherlock?” Greg said, John looked at him, puzzled, and Greg hesitated for a moment before adding, “I saw old scars –”
He didn’t like the fact that it felt like he had never really left his job, that the past few years as a teacher felt like they had been a sabbatical. He clenched his jaws, chiding himself for the distraction: that was neither the moment nor the place to muse over his life choices.
"You said I ought to change the way I played the game -- that it's exactly what I am doing!" Sherlock said. He hadn't looked at John, but he was clearly talking to him.
And they were both still reeling. They were raw, they were hurt, both physically and emotionally. Grief was still something that tugged and burned and made breathing a daunting task.
Sherlock always chose his words carefully, and – God, he supposed he should be more worried because Mary had a gun, a knife and they were trapped, instead he was proud and felt adrenaline rushing in his veins.
keep my promises. You have nothing to worry about. You will have what you asked for, once again, I give you my word.”
Once the car had stopped Sherlock had let go of his hand, agents Drake, and Harris didn’t get out of the car, there were other men outside four agents and, John suspected, others were hiding.
When the steward of the plane brought William the phone he had been in the middle of an argument on his mobile with an old informant. He had never worked in the Midwest and his old informant had claimed he couldn’t pull information out of his arse, on the drop of a hat, just because he was in a hurry.
Things, though, could not have gone any differently, he realized. Because he was playing a game meant to weaken, humiliate and break him ...and John, his John, was their weapon of choice. And that could not happen.
where John had thought that he could live the rest of his life with that mad man and he would be happy, because life was good. Perfect.
It only took one bullet. She had not lied: a person could only be killed once, but if one was good the agony could last a very long time.
He had been so blind. And it didn’t help him thinking that Sherlock hadn’t wanted him to know because John himself hadn’t wanted to know, he hadn’t wanted to see. As he fetched Sherlock’s things: his laptop, his mobile charger, clean socks, pants, a white shirt, a black Spencer & Hart suit, he was forced to stop, breathing heavily through his nose when he realized how much he had punished Sherlock.
Mycroft knew. He knew about the text he had received. He knew everything and he had not said a word about it: not to Sherlock and, obviously, not to him.
While Victor was leaving, Sherlock had kept a carefully blank look on his face as the man packed his things, he had read a chemistry book as Victor did his damnest to make noise (as if he didn't know, hadn't heard, hadn't seen.), to make his goodbye as boisterous as possible. He had succeeded.
“I know it isn’t–“ John started, but Greg interrupted him saying, “I know – I know, but he does.” The man moved another step and said, “I don’t know what’s going on – but I want to help.
He couldn’t help a surprised gasp when he saw the second to last picture – it was a screenshot, taken from a surveillance tape, apparently; Sherlock and he were kissing. He blinked at the image in front of him, recalling for a moment the feeling of Sherlock’s lips on his, of their bodies close – had it really happened mere days before? And someone had recorded that moment, someone had watched
He was still looking at the alarm clock: it was quite old, the glass was chipped, the metal had some scratch marks, it was the sort of item one would have found on an adolescent’s nighttable in the late eighties.
Help Sherlock, bring down the bastards who were killing, torturing and threatening people he loved? Yes, he was in. As Sherlock was fond of saying: the game was on.
William had kept it together. He had refused to leave, and he must have pulled some strings, or called in some favors, because the initial protests from Greg died down quite quickly. William Moore was apparently better than him at obeying orders, because he didn’t protest. He didn’t insist. He didn’t need to tell John anything, he just looked at him: big blue eyes hidden by round spectacles, deep bruise like shadows under his eyes and John knew that the man would follow them, by foot if necessary. The worst thing was that it didn’t matter.
“So he risked his life for two years only to have a psychopath carving him up in Moriarty’s name?” John said and he felt bile rising up in his throat.
“You didn’t think I was a freak.” Sherlock heard himself say in a low voice, “you didn’t tell me to piss off.”
He had accused Irene Adler of letting her heart rule her head, but he had done the same exact thing without thinking twice with John, without realizing it until much later, when it became impossible to ignore.
He was looking at him, arousal in his eyes and in the way his hips were seeking friction against his own.
He hated when he did that. Couldn’t they skip that part of therapy? Why didn’t he tell him directly what he already knew he meant to say? Why couldn't he just get to the point?
John nodded his head, but he was looking at Greg. He too had looked at Sherlock as he went out of the room.
Names held a lot of power, therefore he ignored the fake name Mary had given them in that U.S.B. drive and addressed her with the one she had chosen.
; Sherlock had been smiling a real smile, and he thought he had smiled as well, and it had felt like time hadn’t passed, like they had deleted the past two years and John hadn’t cared about the people in the sitting room, he hadn’t cared about anything that wasn’t Sherlock walking toward him.
Oh. That was easy – it wasn’t even a mask he had to wear and unlike his previous encounter with the two men he was acutely aware of everything surrounding him, of each detail, each subtle shift in the men’s demeanour as he went on talking.
John was unconscious – or he was doing a remarkable impression of it, so much that Mary moved, taking a step toward the glass.
She would not utter sounds, she would not shed any tear. Mary Morstan cried, Mary Morstan lived in the suburbs and wore fluffy robes...but she was
He was better, each day brought forth some improvement: whether it was a whole night without nightmares or the fact that he could move without pain.
And there was a part of him that was hoping that she had just come there to bargain, to buy her own freedom.
He had wanted to watch Herman Bennett bleed, he had wanted to smash his head in – and see him in pain; he had watched him die, but it was not enough.
“There won’t be any deal, Miss. Morstan.” He said and he felt like he was saying words from a script someone had written from him. It was what she had expected him to say. But he could not, would not ask her what he truly had in mind: what did she want?
His allies and enemies alike, the ones who met him – and it was not something he allowed it to happen if he could help it, all said that he always kept his promises, but it was hardly a matter of idealism or honor. He was a pragmatist: in his experience, the fact that his word mattered had always been an advantage.
had been planned; while Sherlock Holmes travelled the world, trying to tear down James Moriarty's web, while he slowly made his way back to London, things had been already in motion.
Mary’s plan had been excellent. She had been a masterful player, but human error, the variables she had triggered had been too far reaching for her to see them all. He had not seen, but she had been blind as well.
her daughter, she was a means to an end – she kept telling herself that, but her breasts ached, part of her – was grieving and she was so fucking tired of grieving!), but that would not stop him.
“Did he ever tell you why he broke the mirror in the bathroom?” She asked. She saw the way John clenched his fists and jaws, she felt how he was vibrating with anger, and she also saw the way Sherlock moved, almost imperceptibly against the Plexiglas wall and how his self-control was shot to shit.
Molly’s skin was warm, despite the fact that she was shivering, it was soft – and somehow he had imagined her skin it would be so soft, and when or how or why he had imagined Molly’s skin and how soft it was, was something he didn’t want to dwell on.
The current operation was, of course, peculiar to its nature and extremely personal for that man and not only because his brother was in the hands of a very dangerous woman, but also because she had played two of the most intelligent men in the world for fools.
That could be a disaster. He was aware of that. He knew that there  was a reason for the way his body reacted when touched. He knew that there were things lurking (festering) inside of him that he couldn't just shove in some dungeon of his mind palace and pretend they had never happened.
Years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds had led them to that moment, to that road, under the rain, their hearts sore and shattered, their bodies carrying the weight of so much loss on their shoulders and yet, they were there – alive, and Sherlock’s hands were cupping his face and it was really happening.
He was bleeding, there were black spots dancing before his eyes, he had gone too deep with the knife, he had missed vital organs, but the bleeding was starting to be a nuisance. John had a gun pointed at the back of his head and he still did not understand why on Earth she was stalling.
John looked at him, confusion clear on his face. He didn’t know because Sherlock had not wanted to know about the note in advance. He had not asked, even after he had told him about the note and where it had been found.
. Sherlock didn’t remember who had said that. He had deleted it, but for some reason those words echoed in his mind as he looked at the pictures in front of him: John and he coming back from the tube under Westminster; John had forgiven him, but he had kissed Mary, mere seconds after one of those pictures had been taken.
He thought - and yet, he had to say it because he had read her file, he had spent God knew how many hours digging deeper and deeper into the woman’s life - wondering why on Earth it hadn’t been done the minute John Watson had met her - and they were bound to land to Chicago in less than twenty minutes, they had an appointment with a man who would drive them to a graveyard where one Brian Cooper was buried and the woman known as Mary Watson had
. He was human: he shivered violently when the mole helped him out of the warehouse, still feeling sure that he wouldn’t end up like the others because of pre-existing deals. Sherlock was still bleeding; he had also forgotten, for a moment, that the temperature was below zero, he had forgotten why Chicago was called the windy city.
The human body had 206 bones, 650 to 840 muscles, and countless nerves. He knew them – he knew how to hurt people and he was not willing to waste any time.
He started to delete the solar system from his mental hard drive as he politely waited for Darren to reach his climax.
Things were moving more quickly than she had anticipated. Good thing she wasn’t alone in that. Good thing that the people above her knew what they were doing.
“Someone sent me a video.” Molly continued. And she sounded shaken, and Greg knew that Molly Hooper was not the kind of woman who scared easily. She dealt with death, with murders, with the handiwork of the people he put behind bars for a living and as long as he had known her, he had never heard that tone in her voice.
It was Locard’s exchange theory – and it did not only apply on crime scenes: there was no such thing as a perfect crime, there must be evidence – and Mycroft, as much as he loathed him, was cleverer than him.
It was not a happy ending. It was the beginning, a new chapter, the way things should have gone years before.
“Please –“ Sherlock said gesturing him inside, “I would offer you a cup of tea, but the flat is still a mess as you can see.”
It had taken her about a month before John broached the subject and told her about Sherlock and how he had died. She had nodded in the right places, she had offered comfort without being patronizing, condescending or saccharine. She had held him and then she had fucked him. John had not said a word when he had climaxed. He never did – it would have been awkward if John had said the wrong name while coming inside of her. That first night, the first time she had fucked him, his heartbreak had been all over his face and so had been who was really in his mind, behind his closed lids as he came. Well, at least he had been a considerate lover, she had had worse through the years.
“Good question,” Mary said. She looked pale, she was obviously in a great deal of pain and the happiness he had clearly read in her eyes had been replaced by weariness.
had told him and that were still haunting Greg, because deep down, even if no one had blamed him for the fuck up with Herman Bennett, he still felt like he was the one at fault.
“Mary was eight months pregnant – they will have needed to stimulate her labor and of an incubator, an obstetrician too.”
the game was on, things were moving and Greg Lestrade (who had spent the night sleeping on Molly’s couch and didn’t look as exhausted as he had the day before) came to the flat  with the news that Janine’s killers had been apprehended.
He tried to adjust to the darkness, he tried to deduce where he was – he moved, trying to measure  how much space did he have – and he could not help feeling tendrils of claustrophobia when he realised that the smooth surfaces were surrounding him. He was, quite literally, caged, in the dark.
“Years, uh?” John asked, as he dried Sherlock’s back.  He had to crouch to start with Sherlock’s legs, and Sherlock’s words,
Mary smiled, it was possibly the first time she had really, sincerely smiled since – well, since her last phone call with Alex.
“Not a fortune teller. I see things, I observe, and I know what others wish to keep hidden.” Sherlock took a step toward him. It felt predatory and John’s cock twitched in his breeches. He stood his ground. “That’s how I know you are a soldier, a captain home from war--”
Sherlock opens the cot again. He has to bump it with his hip to get it to open completely. That jostles Rosie a bit and she squirms against him. Sherlock tucks his lips close to her ear and murmurs a bit to soothe her. He’s discovered it doesn’t matter what he says, just the sound or resonance of his voice makes her calm. She doesn’t really wake up but she does leave a trail of something wet on Sherlock’s shoulder. That would have upset him once upon a time. He presses a kiss to the soft hair just above her ear.
“The return of my colour vision, and the work it enabled, was more than an adequate substitute for cocaine.”
“Suffer? How will I suffer? I am always alone. Alone protects me.” Sherlock is thinking about Victor about that horrible moment when their hands touched and nothing happened. He’s thinking about how Victor pulled away after that. Surely even a soulmate would do the same, create the same distance, once they actually got to know Sherlock Holmes. If his personality alone wasn’t enough to keep Victor why would an unexplained bond be any different?
‘John’ smirks at him, leaned back and glistening with sweat and steam. “Do I? Not many people play the oboe so seems like an odd guess.”
Sherlock finds himself reluctant to give Rosie up so fast. Instead, he lowers himself to the sofa and reclines back so Rosie is lying against his chest with her knees hooked around his ribs. She doesn’t protest their change in position and her breathing is deeper, more even than when he first took her from John’s arms.
The hospital staff, nurses and at least one doctor, come and go but no one seems to acknowledge the change in Sherlock. Maybe it wasn’t here. Maybe it was in the squat, or in the street before he was picked up by the paramedics.
‘John’ breaks their stare and lets his eyes fall to Sherlock’s hardening cock. Good. That’s what Sherlock wanted. It gives him freedom to examine ‘John’s’ blonde-grey-brown hair and the pucker of the scar on his shoulder without interference.
John’s hand closes around him again and with no fabric to separate them, Sherlock can’t keep himself from moaning and rocking his hips. John slides his palm up to the tip of Sherlock’s cock, then across the head to smear the moisture gathering there around, before he closes his fist and slides back down again. Slides back down all the way to the root before letting go and cupping Sherlock’s balls. They are already high and tight against his body.
John sees it happen but it’s like watching someone else’s hand, or like a dream, or even a movie. His thumb brushes, caresses, against the skin along the man’s exposed collarbone.
“No, you really don’t have to…” John takes a step forward and reaches out, but stops himself short of touching Sherlock’s hands where they hover above the mantle.
The newly discovered emotional, needing and wanting part of Sherlock begs to cry out at the injustice. But the more logical, grounded part of him maintains control. “Mrs. Hudson says there’s a second bedroom upstairs. If we’ll be needing two.”
They meet because they’re both the only underclassmen in their advanced chemistry seminar. Sherlock bullied his way in as a fresher but Victor’s a senior whose previous exemplary work and desire to go on to be a master chemist earned him a place in the class. Victor is intelligent and kind and never treats Sherlock as anything except a valued colleague in the chemistry lab. Even when he catches Sherlock staring at his hands during experiment preparations.
Sherlock can hear Mycroft and Lestrade murmuring something over his head, but he can’t be bothered to pay attention. His heart is pounding and he feels weak. The door slams and Sherlock takes a gulp of air. The gentle rolling of the car through the London streets rocks and soothes him.
Sherlock tucks back into the bathroom to change into pajama pants and a tee shirt, new ones that Mycroft had sent over, while John strips down to his shorts and vest. He hasn’t had time to pick up a new dressing gown but wishes he had one to wrap around himself like armour.
There’s a short back and forth between Mike and Sherlock. John’s concentrating all his ability on not staring at this man. He feels like a voyeur - suddenly confronted with the life he might have had and watching it greedily from the sidelines.
Sherlock’s hips bucked and he fucked himself between John’s cock and fist, begging for a harder, faster pace for both.
Sherlock simply hums again and listens to the sounds of John getting out of bed and wrapping a dressing gown around himself. Sherlock hopes it’s one of his dressing gowns. He does love to see John bundled up in the too-long garment while he lays around the flat.
“I never guess.” Sherlock stares him down for a moment longer, looking for anything he’s missed but it’s shockingly hard to read a naked man.  “I know every musician in London.”
“My, you must have pissed someone off to pull this duty instead of just sending a uniform. Tell me, did you argue with the Chief Inspector? Wreck a squad car?” Sherlock enjoys the look of shock on the DS’s face. He likes this, the power he has over people simply because he’s smart enough to look and actually see what others do not.
It was over quickly for both of them. John came hard, at first with hot pulses down Sherlock’s throat but then a sharp pull on his hair popped John’s cock free and the final streaks landed across Sherlock’s lips and chin. Sherlock came, grinding against the heel of his hand, before John even made it out of his mouth.
It’s deep, far more adult and masculine than John would have imagined. Has imagined, really. All those late, starry nights in Afghanistan had left him with all sorts of fantasies, but that deep, chest-vibrating voice hadn’t been accurately portrayed in a single one of them.
The nearly dead, drugged into unconsciousness, incredibly young-looking man on the gurney is breathtaking. Inky dark curls spread out across the stark white of the sheet under his head. His skin is so pale that, in the limited chromatics of John’s vision, he nearly blends into the blank background on which he lies. No one in this condition can be considered gorgeous but, John thinks, if he were to wake up and maybe eat a proper meal, this man could be devastating.
The vestibule was dark and cold. January was terrible time for a festival but that was probably why the ruling class let undesirables have this time as their own. He made his way down a long aisle to a side chapel to light a candle at the altar of Saint Sebastian. The wan winter light shone through the rose window, casting prisms of colour across the floor.
After both of them washed, they lay in the bed again, only covered with a thin sheet, bodies were still naked.
Sherlock also clasped John and buried his face in his neck, let himself intoxicated in the dance with him.
Sherlock made a detour to the backyard. He liked to sneak into the janitor’s house while the janitor was gone to work, so he could read the fresh newspaper from there and see whether there were any interesting murders that would cure his boredom. The class was too boring, he already learned all the things in the textbooks by himself. Besides, his seat was on the corner of the classroom, no one would notice his absent, Victor always took attendance for him.
“That tie doesn’t match your suit. The shade of burgundy in the tie is at least two shades too dark for that light of a shade of grey.” Sherlock’s voice is rusty with disuse but it still causes Mycroft to falter mid-step.
“If your vision is not fully monochromatic again, there is a chance it may return in full colour. Your soulmate may still be alive, or the bond may just need time to repair itself after his death.”
Sherlock comes to consciousness in snatches and bits of disjointed wakefulness. He can hear the machines and feel hands on him, but it’s in an almost dreamlike, soft-around-the-edges way. He hates it. He hates it before he’s even aware enough to know he hates it. He should just be able to open his eyes and snap back to his usual self. Even when consciousness returns completely, it doesn’t work out that way.
He murmured the barest hint of a prayer, some words for his men, his parents, and Harriet, before turning away to seek what he really came for.
Sherlock kicks away from the side of the pool. His arms cut the water in front of him as he glides toward the stairs. The stranger’s knees fall open and Sherlock stops between them, a hand on each one and resting on his knees in the water. He pushes on the stranger’s knees, easing him up a step so that the water only reaches his thighs and his half-hard cock bobs along the surface.
“So the police think, but now they’re here to ask for my help, so who do you think is right, hm? There’s been a fourth and there’s something different this time.” Sherlock can feel it, the thrill of the case, the promise of an impossible puzzle. It cracks his face into a wide grin. Oh, the things he can show John. He can show John what he can do, what he’s capable of and why John never should have left in the first place. He can show him what he was able to become without him, and make him proud.
He wants to roll to kiss John’s lips but the pressure of John against his back, John’s lips on the back of his neck, feels too good. And there’s the benefit of not being able to actually see John that feels too intimate even in the near-silent darkness.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up. “Oh good, you’ll have plenty of time to recover after I do whatever I want to you for my birthday. It’s your gift to me, you know.”
He’s grateful for the distraction of John’s cock in his hand. It gives him something else to focus on, instead of the tightness pulling at his core and the heat pooling at the base of his spine. Instead, he uses his thumb to map the veins on the underside of John’s cock with each stroke from base to tip.
His hands wandered forward to cup Sherlock’s erection through his breeches. He stroked lightly, up and down, and cupped one hand over Sherlock’s balls. His own hips rocked, grinding his cock against Sherlock’s arse.
He fucked Sherlock hard and let out a roar when he buried himself deep and filled Sherlock with his seed.
Kandahar is shit. It’s brown and drab and boring as fuck. They get shot at occasionally but even that is barely enough to tick John’s heart rate up anymore. He’s busy but it’s still boring. He misses Kabul. He could stare off into the green and white mountains and forget what (
Lestrade slumped looked at Sherlock, did not want to admit it but could not deny either, just felt so tired.
"It’s the case you solved last time when you happened to be around, it is a follow-up." Lestrade frowned. "Maybe you were wrong, made us arrested the wrong guy; otherwise, it’s a copycat crime, while we have not publicly announced any information about the case. Both cases are very bad!"
John took off the rest of his clothes and then pressed against Sherlock fiercely, let the boy’s legs separate to accommodate him. Sherlock saw the burning desire in John's eyes, feeling how hungrily he stroked his thighs, and then he stopped breathing while he felt something that came to his most intimate body part.
"They like the lively atmosphere." John grinned and lowered his voice, "We just exchanged our bodily fluids, would you mind eating my saliva?" He picked a piece of chicken to Sherlock's bowl.
Mycroft patted Sherlock's thighs, suddenly revealing the rare brotherhood. "You’ve grown up, should understand that the world is not rational as you thought? Sometimes the order would turn into a mess, sometimes the passion will cover the sense. No one is perfect, things are not black or white, grey is the norm. "
"If his family knew about it, how sad they would be? They sent him here to learn, not to selling his body, right?" Victor still murmured sadly, then squatted down to help Sherlock picking his things up and put them back to places.
It was only a simple position - just two people cuddling and sleeping together - but it was what Sherlock dreamed of in the past seven years; he experimented with innumerable drugs and almost accepted James's temptation was just tried to copy this feeling. The warmest feeling. The happiness that made his heart so warm and blessed. It was the first time Sherlock sleeping so well this seven years, that he felt so refreshed after awoke and he never loved sleep so much. Sleeping was just a boring duty for him in the past, which he must force himself to do in order to keep his body functioning.
The happiness of these days let Sherlock have an illusion, thought that they might keep going in this way. Like they could sublet a similar apartment as this one, told the world they were just two bachelors who wanted to share a rent by economic reason so became roommates, and continue to play each other's lover behind the door. However, this was only Sherlock's whimsy, the idea was stored in the corner of the mind palace, under the exclusive file of John. He knew that John might be passionate to thrilling adventures and was addicted to running risks with Sherlock, but he was also a man with a high sense of morality and a very strict discipline, otherwise he would not be a soldier. John loved the secular society, he was stubbornly perseverance, he would continue to follow the social norms, be a responsible man. That was why Sherlock's fantastic idea had never been spoken out.
Would John still remember him? - Sherlock meditated while turning the ring on his finger. This ring, always worn on his hand, was just like part of his body. Had John taken it off and replaced with Mary's wedding ring? Sherlock knew that Hong Kong had been occupied and was liberated after three years and eight months. Were the Watson family safe? World War II was over, would they back to England after that?
"We have another guest." Mycroft looked at the doorway. "Oh, just mentioned her and she’s come.” they followed Mycroft's line of sight, saw a dressed up lady was coming, went straight to Mycroft and smiled to everyone.
Perhaps the most insulting part was that the law equated the sodomy with the bestiality, said that those crimes were equally evil.
"Your colleague told me that you were on holiday and then gave me here’s address." She was totally reluctant to raise her head as if avoiding to face John, and her voice was trembling with tears. "Sorry to disturb you ... I'm sorry ..."
"It's responsibility," John said while eating. "As a student, you should go to school; as an adult, you should get married and have children. This is a way to achieve our social responsibility. "
It was a car ferry. Sherlock stepped out of a crowded minibus crammed full of passengers. Not far behind, parked with a black car, the door opened, a young officer wearing uniforms came down.
At the doorway, they could not help but kiss and stroke each other with the greatest possible expedition, breathing, groaning and wetly sucking resounded throughout the room, Sherlock urging to unbuckle his belt while John pushing him against the wall and caressing him greedily. After Sherlock got rid of his own trousers, he reached for John’s bathrobe which was the only piece of cloth covering him. John slipped Sherlock’s school uniform off, revealed his skin that already flushed with excitement, and John kissed it hungrily and left love bites on it.
He had returned to the university to investigate James of mathematics department - James Moriarty was a doctoral student in mathematics, academic excellence, character modest, was also the most popular teaching assistant in the department. He had many fans or said he had lots of believers even outside school because his speech was very moving and exciting, could easily instigate people to embrace him and his beliefs. People admired him, followed him and listened to him, making him and his members just like a religious cult.
"Mary is not infidelity to you, you said she is a good girl, would not have pre-marital sex, so she was forced to do it, otherwise she would not have the dignity to see you." Sherlock expressionlessly deduced, "Thus, she had been raped."
A miasma of poverty and despair hung in the air among the narrow lanes of London, people who wanted to escape from the reality using sensual pleasures to paralyse themselves, hooligans took the advantages to steal and rob, it was the messiest time for the society.
"Who knows you'd rather be the bottom." Victor's tone was full of disdain and ridicule, "Ha, I didn’t know that I had fallen in love with a prostitute!"
"Sherlock, the school bell rang, don’t be late on the first day!" They were walking on the corridor from the dormitory to the classroom building, Victor holding two copies of notes and textbooks, urging Sherlock to walk faster.
