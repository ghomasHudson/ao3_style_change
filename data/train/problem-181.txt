“Alright, calm down! It's just a song. One stuck in my head, yeah, but not one I've continually sang aloud—"
! I thought I heard you coming up, Mrs Hudson," he greeted, making sure not to narrow his eyes on her and taking a Santa gingerbread man when she handed it to him, giving him a knowing look. "Thanks. Smells great and probably tastes
Throwing the flannel to the floor after the last bit was swiped away, John shuffled closer and carefully sat Sherlock up, supporting his head and bringing the glass to his lips, “Sherlock. Sherlock wake up and take a few sips for me,” John said fondly as he held the glass to his lax mouth. “Come on, just a few.”
,” Sherlock grumbled from his soft cocoon with a harshly rough and frustrated tone. “And you seem to have picked up a rather infuriating and
area of the house, Sherlock!” John hissed, blood pounding in his ears. He felt his rant bubbling to the surface, knew his voice would be raised, would be loud and echoing around the rafters of his room the next he spoke. “This is my room.
There was a thick dribble of pre-come against the fleshy pad of John's thumb, another when he pushed in with a rotating grind, and then Sherlock grunted, writhed, and began to convulse. He sprayed up the curved, juddering, rosy length of his own chest. He didn’t make much noise through it, only whimpered, gasped, and moaned deep in his throat, overtaken by the rush of intense satisfaction, though John loved it all the same. Resting his forehead against Sherlock's back, he started thrusting into the now relaxed body, spasm of muscles, and fucked into him quick and shallow, avoiding the man's over-sensitive prostate as John chased his own release.
keep quiet then. Even when you want to be, even when you slip into an unwanted doze on the sofa. - I'm fairly certain you had a conversation in
“And he's not my boyfriend,” John thought he should add, reaching up to stroke a thumb across Greg's cheekbone and stubble, scraping his nail over several strands of it with a fizz of excitement, “It’s not like you need his permission to kiss me.”
“I know,” John replied, resting his head on the back of Sherlock’s covered neck and straightened up collar.
three different collars,” Sherlock let fall from his mouth as he searched, scrolled, scanned and finally pinpointed a nearby shop that was indeed open. With a few taps and slides of his fingers he learned the route, the name, and put his phone away again. “Another lead. More toys.
to drive me insane? Weeks of constant running around, of no sleep and barely any food. Of nights where you screech on your violin or explode things in the bloody oven. I'm sick of it, Sherlock!
As they neared the other side of the park, heading for the street once more, Sherlock looped the slip lead around Orion’s neck again, fussing with the pup’s face, his muzzle, his ears, neck and the fluffy fur of his chest. Orion complained, nipping at the lead, but didn’t draw out the issue, trotting around them as they stepped out onto the pavement, tangling up between their legs a few times. Though it had been years since he’d taken a dog for a walk, especially a young, boisterous one, he found that owning a dog was a lot like riding a horse, it wasn’t something his body, his subconscious, forgot, and he was able to slip the lead free of them with several twists, moving Orion to his side.
Orion jumped down, tail wagging furiously as he panted his glee, nosing his hand. John's fingers squeezed at his own, and Sherlock felt the warmth of body heat pressed against his side. "Told you he'd love you."
!” John stressed, almost dropping a carton of eggs, not something the turkey would appreciate he was sure. He glanced at her, watching the bird move with a rustle of feathers, a of clicking talons, to stand near the coffee table, eyeing up biscuits that had been left out on a plate. “Just make sure you get rid of it. I don't fancy Mrs Hudson getting the fright of her life if she calls up to see us.”
Sherlock blinked languidly, gaze unfocused until he glanced down and gave a complaining grunt, “Made a mess of the bed,” he slurred, voice raspy. He looked at John, then at Greg, cheeks flushing anew, though he tried to ignore it and be stern. It was an utter failure on his part. “That’s your fault.
“I’ll go fetch the shirt for you while you get to know him,” Judith said, handing the end of the lead to John as she jogged away, stopping momentarily to talk to Ryan.
John frowned at him but hummed in submission, "Oh! Merry Christmas!" called the woman to them from behind the counter, but quickly turned back to her other customers before either of them could say anything in return. Not that Sherlock would.
. Not unless you show them, which you won’t, so I don’t see what the problem is here?” He tugged John a few shuffling inches closer, giving a slanted grin, following his recline with an incline, bending further, as if he was sending John into an elegant dip. “Could be worse? Could be the face of a children’s cartoon character—”
you,” Sherlock told him smugly, happy by the statement John had provided. He already knew that he impressed John, on many occasion, as John wasn’t exactly subtle in his opinions, but to hear that he was impressed approximately all the time was quite an honour.
“Was our meeting something in your control?” John asked as he set some of the empty bowls down next to the plates.
Sherlock lifted his head, slapped a hand over his mouth, stared at John, and shook his head in fond amusement, “
John brushed his lips against his fingers, tilting and gently shaking his head, and curled his arm around Sherlock's waist. Holding tightly until he let him speak freely and unhindered again, “I was half of a person after the army, I had nothing to live for. There was nothing but
“It’s all right,” Sherlock mumbled nonchalantly, shooting her a small, curling grin and bending to kiss her temple. “Get some mint ice cream in.”
The accused Santa laughed a booming, shaking, warm and gruff sort of laugh, a laugh that made John laugh too, and then he shook his head, his greying beard rustling and crumpling softly like ombré coloured candy floss, moving in the air expelled from Santa's mouth and nose, “I think you're
“Yeah... I think it's a side effect of my shoulder,” John said, half slurring, and lifted his head to wipe away the saliva which had trickled down his chin, “I... I, uh, overcompensate with one side a lot. Obviously. That causes most of the knots. And then, because I get sore, I hunch my back and that just makes it
Sherlock caught hold of his hand, trapping it there, heart racing beneath John’s arm, “There are others. Other things I like. Other things I...
do,” John replied out the corner of his mouth, still looking at Greg and motioning for them to continue their conversation, undeterred by Sherlock, “You know you always have somewhere to stay here, yeah? Regardless of what's going on, you're welcome here. We have tea and sympathetic ears aplenty – Well,
?" he gasped, though he didn't really care. Didn't really care about anything now but Sherlock's hand on him. Sherlock's fingers as they tucked under to stroke through to his bollocks and stretch for his perineum. "
... not really but... well, it's... it's only fair, right? - Gimme your finger then,” John sighed playfully.
Sherlock looked seconds away from fatigued slumber, splayed out, red, and damp with his own essence, and it was too difficult to resist the new routine they had, even under the inspecting eye of Greg, so he bent down and kissed Sherlock's forehead. The quiet exhale of laughter from Greg made him blush, though not withdraw, not until he was satisfied.
be important to you if you're saying 'please' this early on and bringing out all this... quite nice -
“Wh-what are you doing?” Sherlock exhaled with a furrowed brow and a shuddering exhale, leaning up on his elbows. “Stop that! - You were invited into the room, possibly the
things!” Clearing his throat, Sherlock lowered his voice even more, bending to her and taking a bite from the pie to mumble around. “You were in on it and I hate it, and now I’ve showed my hand, ruined everything, and I’m blaming you.”
Under the text there was a smudged paw print the correct size and shape for a German Shepherd, a puppy as the photo had shown.
John nodded and cautiously approached Sherlock, still a little bit nervous as he reached his hand out ever so gently toward the bird, “Will it – sorry,
“Mm, fatigued is right,” John grumbled and glared at him, at the pout that still held his mouth, but cautiously lifted his arms, wincing at the sudden twinge from his shoulder. “Why is it that
“I think the organised criminals are taking a bit of a break,” Greg replied. Of course, that didn’t mean the everyday thugs and graffitist and such were hiding.
John closed that gap between their lips to kiss him once more. Getting to have such a thing, to have John’s mouth on his, even in a light, whispering brush, was something he knew he’d not get used to for a long while, something he’d probably never bore of. John was anything but boring after all. Sherlock lifted his hands, which were annoyingly trembling again, to cradle his head and dropped a kiss of his own, in thanks, in a plea for him to never stop.
He had never had a reaction to a simple kiss like it before. His lips had kissed many, many people over the years – from his first tentative peck at the age of 12, to the longest relationship he had with a woman – yet he had never felt his lips tingling in such a way. It was odd, thrilling and utterly alarming at the same time. It had been so quick, the destruction of him, of them, that he knew he’d be reeling over it for days later. It was perfect and horrifying and everything he had thought kissing Sherlock might be, even kissing him for that short of time.
? - Looking after a dog is a huge responsibility. We have to discuss things,” he uttered, glancing briefly at John to find his lips tilted in a mischievous way.
“It’s not often that men's nipples are, no,” John replied, giving Sherlock's prostate another tap and smiling at Sherlock's open-mouthed expression of pleasure, “But they are for him. Half of that is just personal erogenous zones and another, I think, is because he was so unused to sexual touch before, except his own. All these sensations are still relatively new to him, and he's
John frowned at him, "Sherlock..." he started, but then sighed. "I... suppose not? I mean, you don't go out of your way to find cases."
"Sure," John said and picked up the bag as he rose to his feet, fingers still entwined with Sherlock's.
John slipped his fingers between Sherlock's and leaned in to kiss his cheek, a part of it that wasn’t still wet with dog spit, "I know," he said, "I was only teasing."
John, panting now too, painfully hard in his own pants, circled one of Sherlock’s nipples and watched how it made his rhythm all the more inept, “Won’t take long, will it?” he whispered with a tut, surprised at himself. “Never does, does it?”
“Good idea,” John said, getting a plate out of the cupboard so Sherlock could upend the pudding. “They’d probably provide one, but he should get used to what he’ll have on a daily basis.”
‘Dear Sherlock,’ the letter read in one of those horrible handwriting typefaces, ‘I haven’t met you yet, which I am very upset about, but John’s told me a lot about you. You don’t know me, but John has visited me many times over the past few weeks. On that first day, when he came to the shelter, I ran to greet him, just like everyone else, but I was so scared. I’ve been overlooked so many times, and I didn’t have the best start in life, but when the owner of the shelter tried to lead John to other dogs, he came over to me instead! John made me so happy I couldn’t stop wagging my tail!
outdone yourself, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock said upon viewing, blinking at the amount of food and wondering, if only mildly, if they could finish most of it between the three of them.
this song,” he hissed between his gritted, teeth, shooting a hot glare up at the speakers. John gasped in mock shock and grinned up at him. “Shut up.”
“What other theories do you have?” Santa asked, gesturing for another drink from the barman and ordering John a pint of ice water with a knowing tip of his head, and a wink. "Not just about her, but... about other things?"
,” John agreed, pumping at Sherlock's weeping cock, gaining courage himself and loosening thoughts he’d normally keep locked back, keep buried, to let them run free over his tongue, “And, uh, as for what, I… I was thinking him in handcuffs over your knee mainly. You spanking him whilst my – whilst I’m in his mouth.” His rhythm stuttered at the thought and he had to take a few breaths, turning his eyes down to the floor, to Greg’s shoe just in view. Once back in control and calmed from the abrupt yearning to see that idea through, right that moment, John returned to his task and caught Greg’s gaze again. “Or tied up against the bed where we can use him again and again and
“Clever boy then,” Sherlock smiled wistfully as he thudded the pudding onto the middle of the plate with relative ease.
“I know,” John said, rubbing his back. “Why not think about where you want to take me on that date?”
“He’ll be the envy of the entire dog community,” John said, “and you, the master dog whisperer.” As if on cue Orion started barking, though it was at a cyclist that was riding past, fast and single minded, as all London cyclists were.
“Uh, no. No it’s not, I suppose, but… it's a bit much don’t you think, Mrs Hudson?” John questioned, trying to say it as kindly as he could manage through his simmering frustrations brought on by the day. “Surely we don’t need this many of them?”
“They have a soft lining,” John said as he pulled his shoes on. “They’re better than the ones I have at the moment.”
John reached for Sherlock in return for the first few minutes and just held tightly onto him, trying to calm Sherlock, trying to speak to tell him to slow down, to tell him that this was a bad idea, that they needed to talk to understand it and not mess it up anymore than it had been, "Sher—"
Greg gaped at him for a full minute, maybe more, before he found his voice again, “You... you and Sherlock are...” he murmured, signalling between them and then making a rather crude, if comical, motion with his fingers. Greg looked dumbfounded if a bit elated as if he'd just won the lottery. “
John charged out onto the road, looking for a taxi, or some way of avoiding this conversation, "I didn't say... it's nothing. It's
“I noticed,” John said as he stretched, taking particular care of his left shoulder. “Being there’s still good though.”
“You're doing so well,” John purred, barely aware of what he was saying. “Look so pretty.” He twisted and tapped inside Sherlock, and when he was happy that Sherlock could take another, he pressed his middle finger inside too. "I
As his cock disappeared into Sherlock’s mouth, up along his palate, nudging very slightly against the back of his scorching throat, he moved his hand to thread into those tempting curls and squeezed a clump, happy to see Sherlock’s instantaneous reaction, to feel it against his wet skin. He continued to pet, stroke, tug, and ruffle through that hair until Sherlock was gasping wetly and writhing into it, legs threatening to buckle hard enough to have him crouch down and then kneel beside the bed. John added a scrap of his nails and Sherlock slumped forward, offering up his vulnerable, white nape, which John was happy to touch, dipping his fingertips beneath the loose collar of Sherlock’s soft cotton t-shirt.
Sherlock exhaled a shaky breath in the cramped space between them, against John’s face, as they parted and regarded him with lidded eyes, gaze darting in quick jittery motions to and fro. He held an odd expression and the atmosphere around them had changed, had shifted and transformed into something that was almost choking. It closed in on John, invaded him, as the seconds ticked by, as the realisation of what he’d done, what this had opened up, fully bloomed. He watched Sherlock visibly swallow, mouth unfurling into a dazed sort of smile, and he felt himself drown in it, incapable of resisting it, of pushing it down. He scared him, probably more than his feelings had beforehand, and he let his hands slip down to hang at his sides, unsure what to do now. Had he ruined everything? They had started something. Properly started something. Had crossed that line that they’d been skipping close to and sliding along for days now.
An uncertain expression rippled over Greg’s face and Sherlock dropped his head to John’s shoulder with a grumpy, disappointed sigh, causing a ripple of frustration to crumple Greg’s brow, “Oh yes, like it’s just that easy!”
Sherlock shot him an unconvinced look but gave a shadow of a smile in return, “I don’t know why you are so…
Santa shook his head in bewilderment and raised an eyebrow, “So she killed loads of people so, what? She'd make more sales as a writer?”
“M'not. I'm bisexual. Wasn't sure how you'd react if I told you at first… people can be a bit funny about it – and then when I realised that you'd have been fine, I didn't really feel the need. Didn't think it was
“I hope he likes them,” Mrs Hudson said, looking at the toy. “The woman in the shop said it was good for aggressive chewers.”
“Well… he likes… how you smell?” John said, his eyes wandering around the room, though they ultimately landed on him again.
me. That I'm the one able to show you those things… to give you the pleasure you've never felt before...” John trailed off, tugging at the neck of his jumper. “It doesn't matter though. If you weren't, that's fine too... it's all just perfectly
John looked over his shoulder, his smile still so very warm, and held a hand out for him, "Look, Orion, it's Sherlock. Do you remember what I told you about him? You sleep with his shirt."
“--People like a mystery. They have crushes. Over how you look and move and talk. They want to sleep with you. They find you physically attractive. Have
“The shape, feel, and wrapping paper give it away, I’m spoiling nothing,” Sherlock retorted as he ripped it open, pulling out, as he’d correctly deduced, a rolled up pair of new socks. Luckily they were only patterned in the striped sense, and even of a material Sherlock took a moment to label as bamboo fibre. She had been listening to him after all. He smiled at them, rubbing the fabric between his fingers, squashing it in one hand. There were many benefits to bamboo socks, one of which was the luxurious nature of the fibres.
Now John was definitely suspicious and he wondered what terrible tricks Mrs Hudson been up to this time. What more could she do?
"Yeah... yeah, I got it," John nodded and lowered his head back onto the cushion, the weight of Sherlock feeling more amazing by the second. It was a different sensation of what he was used to, especially with Sherlock being naked under his robe, yet amazing nonetheless. “Just be careful with the top bit of the scar… that's where it's
“Then perhaps you won’t want the cakes I make with it then?” Mrs Hudson teased as John opened a new present, revealing a pair of leather gloves.
Sherlock wrinkled his nose and turned his head, flitting his eyes away, “Jaded...” he murmured, before he sighed sharply and got up, putting his mug down and heading for the door.
Greg snorted a small laugh and, hesitating for a moment, took a step over, “All right. A kiss. Just one. A good one. I’ll...
Greg sighed, “I’m not your father,” he said, shifting forwards and placing the mug on the table again, “but I want you to listen to me, and I want you to listen
“...Yes,” Sherlock breathed, feeling stupider by the second. Why did he even ask? Of course the dog didn’t know what was happening.
.” He winced after he'd spoken, pushing back into his chair a little, feeling more than a bit bad boasting about his sex life when Greg's marriage had fallen apart. Thankfully, Greg seemed to be more than amused, he was tickled pink.
for you, nothing gigantic will change except maybe you'll be less sexually frustrated and we'll have someone else to play with.”
“More cakes instead,” he said, bending to give her cheek a kiss, smiling back at her, the smile he reserved only for her. “Right then, any requests?”
!” John hissed, slapping at the bar again and almost upending his pint glass for a second time. “D'ya know how
.” An amused, playful, cheeky grin spread across his face as they looked at each other, both of them struggling to contain bubbling giggles. “
"Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh. Over the fields we go. Laughing all the way..." John lifted up a stainless steel earwax removal tool and grimaced at it in resigned frustration. "Ha ha ha..."
,” Sherlock sniped in embarrassment, hating how off balance he felt. His legs refusing to do as he told them. Body betraying him. Perhaps this had been a bad idea? The dog, their relationship change, it was a lot to deal with and he couldn’t quite choose which one needed his focus, his attention, the most.
and nightmares and fear.” He combed Sherlock's hair back and away from his face so he could push their foreheads together. Making sure to retain his gaze. “You stopped all that. Gave me a reason to live again, gave me a home and a job and a friend. A
John gave his fingers a squeeze and led the way into the building. The reception area was an almost clinical room that reminded Sherlock too much of a hospital, though the pervasive smell of animal food and hair was plenty enough to sway those thoughts. A man was stood behind the desk, clearly still in the process of opening up, but he looked over when he heard the door. He gave them a fake smile as they approached, eyes more on Sherlock than John.
sorry for what I said, did or how I acted,” Sherlock told him, giving his fingers, wrist and forearm some fond caresses, leaning sideways into John for extra contact.
Shaking, John pushed his abruptly quivering hands through his hair and twisted to face Santa a little better, tipping with the drunken angle of the room, “Do you see
"... It was after one of our arguments," John explained. "I don't even remember what it was about any more, just that I thought I might do something I'd regret if I went home."
"That sounds like something Mrs Hudson would say," John smirked, though he took a deep breath as he looked at Sherlock in a way that was both the same as always and yet somehow so much more.
… like this morning,” he whispered, his cock aching, hands longing to take Sherlock to the peak and back, but he didn't, he merely ran a hand up and down Sherlock's belly, carding his nails through the small smattering of dark hair that lead to his navel. John sympathised with Sherlock. He had seemingly never experienced these sensations and he was drowning, reaching out for John to be his life-raft, putting himself entirely in John's hands. "Want to... be with... be with you. See you, watch you,
“...He...” Sherlock blinked and when the doors opened, he hesitated in confusion, an odd uneasiness to him, before he stepped inside. He spoke again, but only when the doors slid closed. “Personal to who?”
“Mm-hm… yes,” Sherlock replied, adjusting his seating position, blinking widely with a shaky inhale and then trying to straighten up. “Thai, yes. I… I… I, um, would prefer Thai myself, actually. Thai is good. Great.
think someone should be a little more polite to the person currently holding his special place,” Greg muttered before John could respond and gave a flitting look at Sherlock’s wet penis and pebbling nipples. “Or do you have a bit of a masochist kink too? - You did like your hair being pulled earlier...”
,” Greg nodded, almost to himself, and then brushed his hand up Sherlock’s chest, along his throat, and over his ear to sink into his hair. “Why don’t you beg John to let you come then, eh?”
“It will probably only be something little,” John promised, patting the pales curves of Sherlock's knuckles. “Just a daft little token and I won't be offended if you don't like it.
Sherlock leaned down to him and gave his jumper a tug, smoothing his hands down to gather up the hem, “Not precisely unwrapping you, of course,” he murmured, as if John hadn’t said a thing, “but we
Sherlock’s breath hitched on a whimper at that, thighs quaking, abdominal muscles tensing, face crumpling in drawing pleasure and Greg blinked, pupils blown and cheeks red as he, apparently somewhat impulsively, covered John’s hand on Sherlock’s bulging, hardening length with his own, squeezing firm and hard and quick. It shocked all three of them. Rendered them all speechless. Greg stared at his hand, at John, at Sherlock, and then frowned with a faint tremor, one that rolled through his entire body. A quiver like those of a big cat, oversensitive and eager for movement. Pent up with energy.
close to some sort of proposal,” Sherlock muttered in light sarcasm, slouching lot more heavily in relaxation, one of his arms looping around John’s shoulders. “I’m tired, John…” He turned his head aside to drop it down, tucking into John’s neck with a quivering exhale and a tickling, feather-light peck just above the collar of his shirt. “It is exhausting doing this as much as I do.
“I...really don’t know,” Sherlock confessed under his breath, pressing his lips together in a tight, firm line, unable to look at John again.
“I can see you're close with him, yes,” Santa responded. “Your eyes light up when you talk about him... and... think about him.”
It took a while, longer than was necessary, longer than it really should, but Sherlock hauled his attention from John to the room, to the smell of food, and tried to sit up, feeling cold where their bodies separated, “I
“Yes, that’s usually what happens when one is cooking,” Sherlock said with a twitch of his mouth, watching John stretch his back and feeling infinitely more taken with him. Everything about John was infatuating.
how perfect you are. How easy life is for you." Continuing to bite, lick and kiss his shoulders, John worked quickly but efficiently to get Sherlock ready for him. To stretch him open. "
“What other reason would I have for being here?” Sherlock scoffed, swallowing hard again and leaning his head back against the wall at John’s sharpening glare, wincing in quick admission. “No. Not
me by all of that, but the annoyance doesn’t put me off, no,” Sherlock replied, tilting his head as well. “There are
he was going to get his own back by bringing up what I’d asked him to ask in private—I didn’t specify, so
It was freezing and John wanted to get inside, needed a hot drink to chase the chill of the month away, as did Greg, he was sure. Though judging by their conversation since leaving the event, John wondered if he needed to chase the chill of cold, miserable thoughts away as well.
that, thank you,” Sherlock snapped in irritation, finding the thought of allowing the dog, his dog, near any danger abruptly unpleasant. He pushed a sudden influx of memories back and turned to put his violin away. “But it’s not necessary to use him
. Which would you prefer?” Sarah asked him and giggled once more at the pants, bumping her hips into his, smelling sweet and radiating a warm, pleasant aura. “They should fit you, by the way. I made sure. Double checked. - And you need more underwear. I see how often you have to...
“A new laptop then,” John said and Sherlock could hear the smile in his voice. “I’ll be back in a mo.”
Tilting his head with a hum, smile slipping up higher on one side, Sherlock took a step closer, “I thought as much. Good. That’s good. Hopefully now you’ll cut down on the amount of times you
“Merry Christmas, Mrs Hudson!” John called back to her and shut the door behind him, hefting their gifts as he followed behind Sherlock. A familiar, warm, welcome presence at his back.
John followed his instruction and reduced the trailing of his thumb, pushing a knuckle up towards Sherlock's perineum, spreading the lubricant. His eyes never once left Sherlock's. Not when Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed with pleasure, not when they heard the slam of a car door from outside or the blared sound of a siren. Nothing would take away from the moment. Nothing would distract John from his task, from their intimacy. They were in their little bubble, and it was perfect.
.” With a glance at John, at his beaming smile and warm gaze, eyes both affectionate and still incredibly flirtatious, Sherlock lobbed the stick over Orion’s head and across the green. Orion sprinted after it with a bark, looking up as it arched overhead and dropped with a bounce on the grass. The puppy ran around it before picking up and trotting back to the bench, where John had curled his arm through Sherlock’s.
As the man entered the open living space, clothed in his pyjamas and dressing gown, he yawned, “Merry Christmas, Sherlock,” he said. “Tea?”
“Yeah?” Greg questioned with a stunned, pleased look, lips twisting up higher into a rather boyish smile.
Sherlock dug into his pocket, paying the driver much more than was needed, strangely thankful that the man hadn’t looked at them with disgust, nor muttered pathetic, unneeded opinions about their sexuality under his breath, “Yes, thank you,” he said as he handed over the money and followed John out onto the pavement.
traditions around it. Many stories. One such tradition has people kiss with each berry that’s plucked and the kissing only stops after all the berries have been removed.” He gave it an upwards glance. “Though I don’t fancy doing that. Bit toxic those berries. As is the rest of it, really. If ingested.”
.” He reached and cupped Sherlock's cock then, not stroking or moving, merely holding it up against Sherlock's stomach so his own heat-slicked skin could tickle and tease his frenulum, edge him closer to his apex. “You can come whenever you're ready. Take what you need from me, Sherlock. I'll give you it all.”
“Try not to move so much,” Sherlock rebuked and unexpectedly rocked into John's backside, pushing a rather blatant bulge against his buttocks as he leaned down to attack the nape of John's neck with hot lips, making him faintly disoriented. Like he was high or drunk or both. His cock was full, heavy and hot, trapped against the sofa cushion, and he was already starting to sweat. “It's probably the worst knot so far…”
“And attempting to snog each other senseless over my table?” she drawled, causing John to choke on his pudding.
in love, but neither of us were bright or brave enough to admit it, to put it out in the open, to talk about it...”
,” he said again, clenched, wringing hands pressed against his reddened torso as he waited. He made quite the picture. As he regularly did. John had to take just a moment or two to enjoy it before he grabbed a condom packet and slipped behind him, tucking up and taking hold of Sherlock’s hips to angle him, knowing he liked the handling.

ways.” He took a breath, stroked a swirling pattern into the hair on John’s chest and leaned close. “And if you are 'open' to such a thing, if you are aware what it entails, from the both of us, from the situation, and have no qualms, then... perhaps I
Sherlock made sure to give the road a wide berth for the time being, not sure if Orion would be scared by a passing car and lorry, or worse, eager to chase one, “Let’s go to the park with him.”
“Yes…” Sherlock fiddled with the bow and then turned to watch her shuffle out, feeling the urge to request her company. She would love the dog too. She had agreed to allow it. He would be living in her home. She would love it as much as John and him. “Do you want to come?”
John chuckled and, after a brief moment of hesitation, leaned in to press a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek, “Off we go then,” he said and headed out the door.
an idiot,” Sherlock agreed, but he brought his eyes back to him, mouth pursed into a shadow of a smile. He let their gaze linger for a moment and then shifted by him. “I need to hang this back up…”
photogenic,” Mrs Hudson said as she came closer still, though she had finally stopped the amateur photo shoot and was looking at the camera screen. She chuckled happily then turned it around to show them both one of the photos.
of time playing with him,” John replied as Orion flopped over, allowing John to rub at his belly, which he seemed to love. “I think he was lonely before I found him.”
bastard though, aren’t you? Purposefully dragging this out. - If you wanted more edging, you only had to ask.”
“Is... that a yes?” John asked quietly, heart beating so hard he feared it might explode from his chest. “Because... I will. I
John sighed as he pushed open the front door, almost falling bodily against as he did so and tripping up the step. He felt exhausted, mentally and physically drained from yet another day of seemingly endless dull patients and paperwork. Patients that he didn't really need to see and whom didn't really need to see him. Patients with colds. Lots and lots of patients with colds. A mild cold was not the flu, a cold was a cold. There was little to be done about it, little to give and prescribe beyond advising them to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and to gargle warm salt water. The common cold usually resolved itself in seven to ten days, with some symptoms remaining for up to three weeks. It wasn't worth visiting the local GP. Not at all. Pulling his keys from the lock and swaying up and in, John flinched when something touched the top of his head and reared back to look, terrified of what he might find, what Sherlock might have hung there, only find it to be a plant attached to the inside of the door frame, a rather familiar looking plant.
them, we can go to one if you want, if you like them so much. I will be willing to a compromise and give in to you.”
There was a anxious and hurried shake of the head pressed against his, “No… want… close… please…” the words were broken off with a wimper as Sherlock tensed suddenly and bit down on his own lip. There was an oddly familiar throb and pulse as Sherlock leaned hard against him and shuddered through his orgasm, the last fitful thrusts of his hips stilling as new wetness bloomed between them, soaking through both sets of underwear.
Sherlock stared at her, somewhat aghast, “Buck’s fizz?” he sneered, strolling to the fridge regardless. “Do you not have anything good? Like Merlot? Or Pinot Noir? - Duck is a fatty meat that tends to need a wine with some sharpness and acidity to cut through it all.”
John looked at him as if to say 'but I didn't say anything' and released his hand to look through various treats. Orion took the chance to sniff at the various toys on the shelves below.
“Open it,” John told him, taking the mug from Sherlock’s hand and putting both of their drinks on the table.
Sherlock’s entire face went pink in an instant, patches reddening further on the arch of his cheeks, “
." Nudging his extremely evident and cocky smirk against John’s cheek, Sherlock kissed him and trailed his finger further and further, dipping into the path of his spine. “I think you
Sherlock was stretching for the mistletoe in the centre of the living room, shirt pulling taut as he did so, fingers swatting, skimming and then pulling at it to bring it down, the rest of the now removed mistletoe in his other hand within an ungainly bundle, “I blame

resent it, I don't think badly of you.” Sherlock looked as though he was about to argue a retort, brow crumpled and mouth parting, but John quickly quietened him by pressing his fingers over Sherlock's lips. They were badly chapped from hours of silent sobbing and gnawing, skin pinched in order to muffle. “And I'm sometimes stunned that someone like
John sniggered in reply and then slapped another card down, shouting snap, “So… er… how to phrase this one…
,” Greg chocked, sounding like he’d just been physically hit with the realisation of what he was doing. He didn’t stop though, scarcely even paused, only got a strong arm under Sherlock’s shoulders to heft his upper body up for easier access, cradling and tipping his head back to expose the long, tense line of his neck for Greg’s mouth again.
With the weight of John’s hand in his and the responding, cheery, soft exclamation from Mrs Hudson, something took over him and he entangled his fingers with John’s tighter in sudden need, “And we’re going on a date! A real one this time,” burst from his mouth before he could stop it.
“I'd maybe wait until you're sober first,” Santa advised with a wince and a smile, reaching to help him get steady. “You might talk about sharks again.”
because we have him. I have, in fact, worked with a dog for certain things, but only when it is especially
John continued to look at him blankly, but his shoulders relaxed, and soon he lips curled up into a smile and the corners of his eyes wrinkled as relief and excitement and joy made his eyes shine, “Can I be greedy and ask for two gifts?”
," Sherlock drawled and with a squinting, considering, darting glance, he got to his feet, dressing gown fluttering open to display more of him. He pushed the cap back onto the bottles and dropped them onto the coffee table, gesturing with a tip of his chin vaguely. “Not now though. Now the moment has passed and your rejection has rather irked me. - Not to mention the fact that you may be aroused, but you're still not up for...
John ducked his head, face quickly aflame, and nodded, feeling his heart jolt and cock twitch, “Uh. Yeah. Thank you. It's good, yeah. - Though it still does feel a bit weird to have your face on my dick though... not sure I'll get used to that, no matter how often it happens...”
. There are no reasons for it. There is no medicine for it, not really. - How can you put up with it, when I barely can?”
‘I always get so excited when John tells me about you though; about the exciting, brilliant man who has a big heart. I’m always going off and trying to discover new things, but when John finds me – and he always does – he keeps me with him with stories of you and your adventures and shows me pictures of you all the time.
“Of course,” Sherlock whispered, meeting John halfway to meld their lips together. He was pliant and soft and unhurried, tasting John with his tongue when he was given permission, then sucking with a low, breathy, stuttering groan that thrummed through the both of them.
. Please let me come,” he gasped, legs shaking and opening again with a beseeching roll of his hips. “I need to. I’ve needed it
Orion was gone before Sherlock reached his tail. He bounded across the green with his tongue hanging from his mouth, running around in circles, sniffing and exploring spots in the grass and trees, then eventually coming across the poodle Sherlock had mentioned, starting to greet them.
John faked a laugh and a smile, then rubbed his mouth and chin, “Yeah, that’s true, I suppose. I just – I'm not sure Sherlock is going to go for it—Where is he by the way?”
Hair pulling is not overly masochistic,” Sherlock growled, the colour decorating his skin darkening despite his icy glower. “I thought you were here to watch, not talk?”
Greg hummed, unconvinced and amused, though couldn’t seem to stop himself from leaning into the touch, clearly starved of such contact, “Right, okay,” he murmured, eyes on Sherlock as he lifted his hands to cup John’s face.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied distractedly, incapable of stopping his gaze from flicking back to the dog photo. A dog that would soon be in the flat. A dog that would soon be his. Be theirs. It had been a long, long time since he’d had a canine companion and the tidal wave of the loss, heartbreak, the loneliness, the sweeping twister of happiness and love, whenever he thought back to that time, was often too much to handle. The brunt of it could and had easily tipped him over into misery, transforming him back to his childhood, back to the feel of soft, long fur under his fingers and a wet nose against his cheek. Sherlock inhaled sharply, pushing back on those memories, the bad and the good alike, and leaned his head back to stare at the ceiling.
what I’m saying, what I meant,” he huffed, chasing him as if magnetised, pushing their faces closer and closer, wanting another kiss, then another, and another. “Stop moving away…”
Colours and movement seemed to be on some sort of satellite delay as John looked around the pub, squinting idly at the few other punters who were dotted around on tables throughout the bar. They were like blurred snapshots, distorted and wonky, leaving smears of pigments from faces, hair, clothes that stretched out around them with each motion they made. Like looking at ink in water. Animated link. Perhaps it was? Perhaps they all were? John didn't know. Didn't know much of anything for a few long moments as he sat and stared and swayed in his chair, caught up by the swell of instability. The floor slanting under his feet, walls tilting around him, and ceiling angling down, then up, then down again. It was as hypnotising as it was sickening, and John had to clumsily cover his gaze with a sticky alcohol slicked hand to cut off his line of sight and cut his focus, grunting as he did so, unsure if the semi-darkness was better or worse than the rocking reality.
Using both hands to steady himself and shooting the man a wonky, drunken smile, John nodded knowingly, slanted towards him, and reached out to poke his arm, “I know who y'are...” John announced through his drunken slur, fighting with his disobeying mouth to talk properly, to talk with purpose, and giving a narrowed unfocused ogle, “I can see through your
“...No,” Sherlock replied and brought her into the kitchen with him, putting her on the table to caress her tucked up wings and down her long legs. “I don’t
That first tentative touch and scratch of stubble shot a scalding spark of arousal down John’s spine, followed by another and another as the kiss deepened, Greg’s mouth parting wet and warm over John’s top lip. He moved his free hand to Greg's waist, holding tightly as he let himself be tasted and devoured. It was different to what he was entirely used to with Sherlock. Though Sherlock could be a little demanding and domineering in his kisses, he didn’t have the same roughness that Greg had. A rugged skill that danced along the line between too much and not enough. It was good. Greg was good. John felt a pang of pity and flare of annoyance at such skill being wasted and not appreciated.
"Yeah," the DI replied and closed the door behind them. "How do you put up with him?" He sent Sherlock an annoyed glare.
John, who had been focused on the door, righted himself and pulled at Sherlock’s neck for a steadying kiss, "Alright," he said, "but he's going to
The motions of John’s fingers were unexpectedly seductive, coupling exquisitely with the coy tone of his voice, “Kissing is already rather

,” Sherlock groused in a low snarl at Greg’s back, coat flying out behind him. John was sure Sherlock did it on purpose. He loved the dramatic flare. “Like it
The flat was quiet tonight, Mrs Hudson had left for her bridge club a few hours earlier leaving John and Sherlock to their own devices. John had cooked, nothing special just some pasta, and they had eaten together at the table, chatting about their day and Sherlock's newest experiment. It was nice. It was calm, but John knew that they needed to have a conversation about the -thing- that was happening between them. He hated to think about it, but he would need to open up and talk about his feelings.
“Nothing at all?” Sherlock pressed, feeling dizzy, stupidly hoping, foolishly wanting him to say something, anything, about the kiss, their friendship, their ‘them-ness.’
John groaned and relaxed against Sherlock, his head resting on the still damp and pleasingly cool collar of Sherlock’s Belstaff.
an issue for you?” Sherlock snapped, folding his arms. His corded, lovely arms. God, John couldn't choose what to stare at first, those arms, those legs, that bared chest, waist, or hips. “Isn’t what we’re doing, what we
“No, do it now,” Sherlock told her, a he looked at John’s hand too and wringed his fingers together, wanting to touch, to press back into it somehow. He knew he could. Their relationship had changed, he was allowed to touch and kiss John if he wanted now. The mere thought made him dizzy.
“What else is in this bank of yours?” Sherlock asked breezily as he reached to take hold of John’s aching erection, feeding it out through the underwear to bob in the space between them with a visible throb, and cupping the flushing tip, stroking the edges of flared, sensitive glans, taking them into his mouth with a clever, curling tongue.
Sherlock snorted with a grin as the lithe wiggling tongue only just caught the underside of his chin, “Yes, yes, we haven’t forgotten about you,” he said, inclining close and offering Orion his cheek, jaw, and neck to lick.
John had an inkling of what Sherlock might be talking about, but he didn't want to break the spell of this confession, of him expressing himself with something that was normally difficult to talk about. Despite them being sexual with one another for a while, Sherlock was still incredibly diffident and almost innocent when it came to expressing his desires, something John hoped he could assist in ending. It wasn't that John had any aversion to allowing Sherlock an opportunity to experiment in the bedroom – far from it – it was purely that the thought of Sherlock having the patience or confidence to take the lead was something John was avidly desirous for.
“Doesn’t mean much,” Sherlock said, leaning away and dropping his head back on the seat. “Do you miss him? Gladstone?”
politeness, yes, I'm sure they were!” Sherlock scoffed, a pale hand appearing to push back his fringe and ruffle through his hair, a clear sign of his growing agitation. His elbow peeked out too for a moment. A bare elbow. As well as a peek of a bare forearm and bicep. “They were glad I wasn’t there. They
’ will take good care of him?” Sherlock corrected, shifting and turning in John’s arms, glad he was quick to allow and compensate for it, turning his face up. Sherlock gave him an awkward smile and patted his arms, curling his fingers into the creases of his elbows. “I know you...did this for me, but he is yours too. In fact, he was yours first. He met you first. Loved you first.”
Sherlock arched his back with a judder of his hips, “Chenin Blanc is the white… so… so if… if we have that then there is… is no…
Darting a frustrated glance at Sherlock's continued attempt to spite him, John sighed, going with it, “Yeah... she's taken to wearing earplugs to bed. - He's a screamer,” he said, hitting back with a bit of his own dig and pointing at Sherlock with a complacent, peevish, tight smile.
John felt a stab of dismay, but tried not to show it, after all, what had just transpired hadn’t been half bad, “Of course not. We're not going to hold it against you if you feel its not for you,” he promised, “I still value our friendship more than I want your knob.”
“Put your head on my shoulder. My jumper is…somewhat dry,” John said with a soft sigh and a smile, urging Sherlock down by the nape of his neck and trying not to react when Sherlock’s warm chest pushed against him. “Pull your arms out and wrap your coat around us…it’s big enough, I think…”
“Yes,” Sherlock answered with a quick nod, finding his hands clasped into the front of John’s sleep shirt. He gaped, gulped, shivered, and frowned. “I didn’t notice…”
“You can’t keep using Christmas as an excuse for your behaviour,” Sherlock scoffed, releasing him to move his hands to John’s collar and smooth his fingers over it. To lift it over the neckline of his jumper. To follow it around to the back. Then, after a brief pause, fixed it, refolding it more neatly. He seemed almost fixated by the motion, by the feeling of it under his fingertips, and he cocked his head to the side with a soft exhale. “You need new shirts…”
Greg reached over, singling one nipple out and pressing, then circling, amazed at Sherlock’s explosive curving and shifting, “
shy. Just look at how he reacted earlier. By saying he's cold, I know that he wants me to get naked and get into bed with him.”
“… He likes you, you know. Always has, I reckon,” John said softly, looking down at him and stroking a lock of hair from his forehead, “He doesn't trust many people, especially not with something so
“What...did you have in mind?” Sherlock asked, crossing his legs to rotate his foot, trying to act casual as his heart fluttered. Trying to be more interested in the stone lodged in the side of his shoe than he was in their conversation.
He was looming, looking strong and self-assured, his calm demeanour only adding to the lustful image. Greg tightened the cuff with a deft movement and John's mouth watered at the sound Sherlock emitted in reply, blinded by the influx of various options that were presenting themselves from the addition of the equipment.
"John." Reaching a hand for his jaw, Sherlock stroked up to cup his head and stepped around to push into his front, knocking John back a few steps until he bumped into the fridge and they were nose to nose. “What’s our pecking order?”
“Say it how we want you to say it,” Greg cut in with a tut and a fisting tug of Sherlock’s hair, arching his head further back against the pillow.

up for some experimentation,” he responded with a dip of his chin, beaming as Orion trotted over, panting and happy and sitting beside them as if proud to call them his.
“Yeah, but it depends on the situation. I think he missed me. Though he won’t admit to it. I was out for most of the day, after all,” John said as he gave in to an unmistakable and hard to ignore urge, gently taking Greg's hand to touch then entwine their fingers. It felt good. Different, yet the same as how it felt when his hand tangled with Sherlock’s. John was glad Greg didn’t comment on the action and only smiled, giving him a squeeze. “If we've been on a long case, I mostly just crash beside him afterwards… not up for the trek back to my bed. He, uh, takes good care of me. Covers me up and…” He let loose a laugh at such a random and unnecessary comment, peering into Greg’s face, trying to gauge his wants, feelings and fears. “Do you… want to watch? See how you feel?”
“Bad luck is normally only for those who refuse a kiss,” Sherlock answered, eyes back on him, piercing into him, burning a mark wherever they shifted, digging deep into him and burrowing to his core. “
Nodding, just enough that their skin rubbed, some stubble John had missed scraping pleasurably against him, Sherlock reached up to grip at the soft, comfortable, gorgeous jumper, “I...didn’t...I didn’t know
…” he muttered, lifting him, holding him, and carrying him towards Sherlock's chair, it wasn't the most comfortable, but it would be the easier to clean, and so he slouched down on the leather, wincing at the chill of it against his burning nude skin before. Sherlock, of course, tumbled on top of him, straddling the tops of his thighs and tucking his feet under the backs of John's knees. It was perfect. It was amazing. It was more than things had felt, had been, that morning. They were closer, more intimately interlocked. “This is better.” John cupped Sherlock's chin and brought him down for a kiss, a sweet and long and ardent kiss. “I... I don't think I can get enough of your body pressing against mine...”
only getting what is required. Instead of silly dog coats, for example. - He needs more than one collar, just in case he chews one up or breaks one apart, as that’s very easily done; he needs another lead, probably one of those extendable ones; he needs more toys, to learn and play; he needs a bed to sleep in; and he needs treats to successfully be trained and taught more tricks. It’s all quite rational and necessary.”
“Yes, well...I doubt he’ll be overly picky,” Sherlock murmured, reaching to tear into another present. This one was a set of two stainless steel dog bowls still in their box, but Sherlock was distracted from it when John put a comforting hand on his forearm. It shot sparks through him, made his stomach flip, and stalled his mind.
!--” The wheezing, startled, gasping voice was instantly familiar. Instantly recognisable. As were the big, pale hands that scrabbled at his wrist and forearm, fumbling between grasping for a defending clasp and soothingly patting to ease John’s spooked mind. “It’s me… it’s me, John. It’s Sherlock…”
Mrs Hudson blushed happily and moved to sit at one of the places set with Christmas crackers and champagne flutes, “There’s some bucks fizz in the fridge. Sherlock, would you mind fetching it?”
“Well, I'm going to go out and have a look around London anyway. Might take Hudders with me… unless you want to accompany me? Go for a wander around the shops and possibly point out what you may be inclined to like on Christmas day?” John asked, eyebrow already raised knowing that Sherlock was highly likely to say no. He wasn't a fan of crowded shops, even when it wasn't the Christmas rush. If there was a choice in the matter, he often opted out of it, only going out into the bustling streets when necessary or dragged.
Sherlock grunted in agreement and shrugged the heavy fabric off his shoulders before wrapping it around them both securely, his cold nose and forehead squashing up into the crook of John’s neck. John slipped his hands inside the coat to encircle Sherlock’s warm and dry waist, sighing in relief when his chilly fingers tingled from the pleasurable heat radiating off Sherlock’s torso. Sherlock shifted a moment, seemingly uneasy, before huffing in resignation and shuffling closer; so close, in fact, that they were suddenly touching from chest to pelvis. John blinked rapidly with a surge of embarrassment and cleared his throat, adjusting his hand placement on Sherlock’s waist and glancing around the cave and then outside at the deluge when Sherlock rubbed his wet and icy forehead against his neck with a groan of discomfort.
,” John said, his voice stern and commanding. Like a captain. Orion whined but did stop, licking at Sherlock’s hand instead, eyes locked until the person was completely out of view.
Putting the paper down under the table he resettled himself in the corner of the sofa and, for a moment, Sherlock thought he’d pushed too far already, but John, beautiful, wonderful John, opened his arms and said; “Come here then.”
Greg frowned in amused sympathy and nodded, shuffling around to slip onto the bed at Sherlock’s side, reaching to pet back his fringe, “Is it always like that between you two? Always that…
“Lure him out with the promise of a kiss, as well as tea and biscuits,” she told him, glancing in the direction of his bedroom. “I think that’s what has been bothering him the most, you know.”
,” Sherlock replied and frowned, shifting, abdomen muscles flexing and toes curling, a ripple of brief apprehension stiffening his frame, “though mostly what I’m going to
Rocking forward into it, into John, Sherlock let their brows touch, breathing in John’s next exhale, “That’s also good,” he told him.
“Yeah, first man,” John replied with a laugh of his own, “He was all stubbly the first time we kissed too. It was strange, but not as off-putting as I expected it might be. In fact, it was, um, somehow
With a roar of overemphasised fury, Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and he went for him with arms outstretched, nimbly climbing over things in his way as he took several unnecessarily long strides over to grab and muffle him, “
“I can do the dishes, don’t you worry,” Mrs Hudson said, and soon enough the landlady appeared by his side carrying their empty plates. She set them on the side and reached into a cupboard for their bowls. “… Are you alright dear?”
John chuckled and raised his hand to the door, “If I didn’t know any better, I would have thought you skipped breakfast,” he said as he knocked.
’ was both his best friend and completely out of reach. “Why should I tell you? I thought you didn’t want to talk about John.”
It was ridiculous. Standing in their living room completely nude except for socks with the curtains still open and the door unlocked, but he couldn't care less. Nothing seemed to matter to him anymore, not during this, not when his mind had been conquered. He reached to help Sherlock take off his own trousers, salivating when his erect cock was revealed quickly, no underwear confining it, clinging to it, giving the freedom needed for it to jump out eagerly to meet him, red tipped, wet and pulsing with radiating heat.
“If it helps, I never want to stop,” John admitted, trailing after him and rubbing his thumb across Greg's bottom lip before going in for another soft kiss, “But I shouldn’t because
Clambering to stay up and getting a shaky, sweaty arm across John’s shoulders, Sherlock grimaced in fascinated pleasure, mouth open enough for John to taste him, to fuck his mouth, to suck at his tongue, and swallow his little moan of curiosity as John added a bit of pressure, “I don’t… always like surprises…”
certain that it would be overcast but nothing more!” he groused, pitching his voice low and mimicking Sherlock as best he could. “John, don’t be an idiot, I’ve calculated the spot, exactly! All we need to do is walk five miles through swampy, muddy, poo-covered fields. Better leave the car on the side of the road. We won’t need that. We surely won’t get lost or caught out in the worst downpour since records began!”
“Right,” Sherlock nodded, mind flurrying with the knowledge of the dog, the dog that knew his scent, the dog that John had chosen, had visited, the dog that was to be theirs. “Anything could go wrong, I suppose.”
? Why are you looking at me like that?” He straightened in the chair, eyes widening and lips parting at John's head slant and sideways smile. “
With a faint moan, John slanted his head to deepen the kiss and grabbed for Sherlock’s hip, “Okay, yeah,” he murmured against Sherlock’s lips. “Make that, I find you
people. I knew the man who raised her and I know the woman I’m going to give her to. - She won’t be killed for meat. She will live and die a free turkey… more or less free.”
her there. If I had, she would have been slain anyway, either for me or for the public. So, instead, I said I wanted to kill her myself. Persuaded the man to let me take her. He told me how to do it, gave me a few grisly tips, and she came home with me. I won’t be killing her,
!--” He stopped talking, went utterly still and felt his face burst with heat, felt it all the way to his ears. “Not that I – I
. We don' like talking much. Gets all --” He waved his hand vaguely, almost spilling his water once again. “
Thoughts of a relaxing late evening pulling him onwards, Greg made his way up the steps to his front door and let himself in.
“I don't mind, Sherlock. I don't care that you won't be responding in kind,” John assured him, composing himself with a cough and an extending arch of his back. He turned away to gather his shoes, the most comfortable shoes he owned, the ones with most grip, and slipped them on, bending to tie them. “Tell you what – how about you let me watch Home Alone as a gift? No moaning or griping?”
“I’m excited,” John replied, “and nervous, and a lot of other things.” He took a deep breath and rubbed Sherlock’s hand with his spare. It was grounding and strangely very arousing.
best we don't. - You would only repeat yourself, unnecessarily, and tug us around in the same circles. Just take this as it is, John. Just... enjoy it without question. We might die tomorrow, as people say. So does it
. You'd not murder me. You can't. Not now. - You'd be lost without me,” John whispered, feeling his body heat as they stared at one another, as Sherlock altered his posture and rubbed a bit too slow to be anything else but deliberate. He exhaled quietly and swallowed, unsure exactly on what to do and how to respond. There was an itch, an urge, but he wasn't confident enough to give in to it. “What about if I sing another song then? You could even accompany me on the violin? Give in a little... give in to, uh, that Christmas spirit.”
,” Sherlock argued, although it obviously wasn’t true in this case, John’s body heated pyjamas warming his fingers was proof of that. He vehemently hated himself for not knowing it earlier. He’d wanted it for so long that he’d clearly convinced himself it would never happen and now he couldn’t seem to let go of John, not now that he had him, and he looked down at his fisted hands, feeling a wedge of emotion well up in his throat.
!” Sherlock’s analysis was derailed as John arched up and came hard in Sherlock’s hand, white streaks hitting and dripping down the furrows of Sherlock’s abs and onto his underwear, joining the sticky mess already there.
Frowning, Sherlock glared at the puzzle in his hands, not exactly pleased he was bring so easy to read, though Mrs Hudson had always been one to see things about him others didn’t, “Things haven’t changed
“God, Sherlock… did you… you did, didn’t you… and you…” John struggled for words as his own erection sat hard and demanding in the warm wet puddle between them.
Sherlock straightened his back, weirdly proud of such a normally banal statement, “You clearly need my support.”
Sherlock gave him a tiny grin in response and angled John’s face again, nosing down to kiss him once more, as if they always did it, as if it wasn’t new, wasn’t awkward and frightening and big, “You can bathe later,” he murmured against John’s mouth.
Wheezing and seemingly unable to stop trembling and twitching, Sherlock gave a low keening moan, “Yes… I… I rather agree…
energetic,” John continued, “always exploring the garden they allow the dogs to run around in. He’s run off only to come back covered in mud a time or two.”
idea,” Sherlock shot back sarcastically, head tilting as he absorbed John’s mannerisms and response. He replayed the look that had passed. He knew that look. Felt it twist his own face. Sherlock opened his mouth to comment, to bluntly state his deductions, but nothing came out and he swallowed, closing it again with a feeling of further affection for the man across from him. “I know, John. I’m not an idiot.”
“Sometimes,” John muttered, his own thumb rubbing at the back of Sherlock’s hand now. “I was nine when they had to put him down. I didn’t understand it for a while, and I kept thinking he’d come back… There are a lot of fond memories I treasure, but he was an old dog in the end.”
," Sherlock told him, leaning in, forcing John to arch back and cross his arms, “Who's going to know anyway?
, make her stop,” Sherlock grumbled, though he felt an odd fluttering of both shyness, at being caught indulging in affection, and anticipation, for the photo that would come of it. Documented evidence of their change in relationship. Irrefutable proof that they had been something more, that John had held him close, smelt his hair, kissed his skin, wanted him. If John ever left, if things ever stopped, he’d have the photo, he’d have the physical memory of it.
“...Really?” Sherlock asked, needing to make sure that John wanted the photos as much as he did. He locked eyes with Mrs Hudson as she shifted closer to them. She looked exceedingly happy, her eyes glistening, cheeks rosy, and smile only getting bigger the nearer she got to them.
Sherlock grabbed his elbow, turning him around before John could shrug him off, “Wait,” he breathed, looking at John and walking around him when John tried to turn away. Sherlock kept stepping into his line of sight until the man just ended up grabbing John’s arms. “You...talked to him about me, didn’t you? You’re angry because you told him things in confidence, about me, and you’re peeved you think he’s ‘prying’ into
He continued to try and convince himself it was a dream, that it couldn't have been real, even though he'd seen Sherlock, felt him, heard him, after the shrill jolt of his alarm. The alarm that always woke him up, always brought him around. He'd really done what he did, hadn't he? Given into that filthy, debauched side of him, the side that always itched, lusting for more, for one more touch of his cock, one more flirtatious comment, one more step to closer. John had given in to it before, for good and bad, but this time... this time it had taken him over, had blinded him with the need to take what he wanted, what he needed, what was being blatantly asked of him. The string of friendship was now well and truly severed, retied, replaced, and it was all his doing, if the string, frayed from the adjustment, snapped, it would be on him. It would all be on him.
John nearly whimpered in sympathy, knowing how utterly frustrating it must be to stop whilst on the very edge of bliss, and had to admit that Greg was surpassing all fantasies, “He hasn't come for two days. He's desperate,” John whispered gutturally, fixated on Greg, “Can practically feel how much he needs to come. - I've never felt his cock so hard…”
Sherlock watched for a moment and then glanced again at John’s hand, focused on the weight and warmth of it, the sensation of touch through his layers of clothing. With eager eyes he traced each finger, each knuckle, lingered on the smooth, beautiful, delicate length of bone, veins, and soft, small blond hair which were only barely visible. The urge to touch was stronger than it had been before. He wanted to tuck his fingertips up John’s sleeve, wanted to lean into him, wanted to have John’s arm draped possessively across his shoulders. Wanted to taste, smell, and own every inch of him. John, however, was unaware of his internal struggles and pulled away when Mrs Hudson opened her present with a gasp. Sherlock instantly mourned the loss of John’s hand.
“As much as I loved the main course, dessert is always my favourite,” he said into the companionable silence that followed, still somehow not liking the quiet too much. It left him time to think. Thinking about John, about their dog, about the future with both.
!” Sherlock snarled, leaning out at them with a sour expression, eyes flitting over them. He looked wild. His hair was puffy and frizzy – the way it did when he was stressing over a case and was constantly ruffling, pulling and combing through it with his fingers – and his eyes were slightly squinted as if he was debating who to demolish with deductions first. The mistletoe loomed overhead. Waiting. Biding its time, unnoticed. “She
of John's heart. John felt the moment that Sherlock fell asleep, felt the wakeful tension drain from the man's body and his change in breathing.
“It was nice of Mike Stamford to invite me really,” Greg sighed as John walked him to the flat door, his hands deep into the pockets of his trousers, jacket open and lapel fluttering in the harsh rushing wind.
!” Sherlock exclaimed in a petulant whinge, that was becoming extremely commonplace, and dropped his head down into the hood of plush duvet waves. “Restless: unable to rest or relax as a result of anxiety or boredom.”
John rolled his eyes and sat on his chair, crossing his ankles in front of him, “You could have come out with us. Mike and Veronica were asking about you.”
When he'd dried himself off, John moved to stand in front of the bathroom sink to wipe it the condensation off the mirror and look at his reflection, checking the state of his hair and skin, and caught sight of the underwear from the corner of his eye. They were slumped on the toilet lid where he'd flung them, Sherlock's face staring over at him from the crotch, the slight smile on his face seeming almost challenging, egging him on to at least try, to see, to go through with it, if only for curiosity's sake. After a returning glare to the blameless pants, lips tightening and jaw cocking aside, John exhaled a long sigh through his nose and grabbed for them, shimming them up to cup and cover his genitals. With them in place, he had to admit that they were a good fit. They held him well, clung in all the right places, and where the image had been added wasn't as awkward feeling as he had thought it might be. They were stupidly comfortable. How could they not be with the world against him so often recently?
Lowering his hands somewhat to better brace himself, Sherlock exhaled a breathless groan, eyelids fluttering, “Everything… you are not—
reality is that serenading?” Sherlock asked sharply, sullenly, his hands going to push on John's shoulders. “If you keep this up, I’m going to
Santa squirmed in his seat a little, evidently uncomfortable, “Have you spoken to him? Homer? And told him how you feel?”
Through the gloom and the thicker shadows, he could just about make out Sherlock’s wide eyes and gaping mouth, “I… I was… I…” he stammered, sounding strained and husky with shock. His hands still patting at him. John hated it. Found the pitying, patronising touches infuriating. "I--"
move young man,” Mrs Hudson said. “I can take care of everything. You just keep your tush on that sofa.”
? Become a part of the business? Sherlock, John and--” He gestured at the bird, giving it a disgruntled, sneering look. “Gobbler here?”
“I can't believe this, Sherlock,” John whispered in utter exhaustion, covering his face and then leaning against a kitchen counter top. “Just... just... just
Sherlock inched back slightly and watched in wonder as John hooked his fingers under the waistband of his underwear and pushed them hurriedly up and over his erection, before taking himself in hand. His penis was darkly flushed and glistening wet, the head red and swollen and leaking profusely.
Sherlock’s forehead furrowed in frowning disbelief, “Gamble?” he repeated with an amused puff of air from his nose. “With
He brooded the entire way to the surgery, surprising Sarah who hadn't expected him in until later. Therefore, with no appointments booked, John took on the emergency clinic and was thankfully occupied enough throughout the day to stop himself from pondering, from panicking, from dreading about what he faced when he returned home. In fact, he stayed as late as he could, so late that it became obviously suspicious and Sarah came to him, tilting her head and asking probing questions, it took everything in him not to snap at her, not to shout, before he bid her goodnight and finally, headed back home. It was a one off, he told himself, it had to be a one off, probably just a reaction from their proximity, from the strange tension and his corrupted feelings. How was he going to explain this to Sherlock? Did it need explaining? What was Sherlock's thoughts during all of it? Why had Sherlock come to his room, why had he done any of it?
His face was pulled back, John’s fingers touching his cheek then curling behind his neck as those awe filled eyes looked between his. And then their lips met again, this time harder, fiercer and more possessive, and John’s arms wrapped around his neck to keep him close. Sherlock’s legs buckled and he stumbled into the surge, the pull of passion, clutching at John’s shoulders with a heady gasp. The difference in this kiss from the last was monumental and beyond description. It shot liquid fire through Sherlock’s veins, brought sweat to his brow, to his chest, to his back, and awoke a spiking jolt of shameless desire in his pelvis and chest. He kissed back, gripping at the soft, yielding material of John’s jumper, pulling it out of shape with rigid, clawing fingers, and screwed his eyes shut against the deluge of information.
He tried not to pause mid-chew, though wasn’t sure he was completely successful as John’s eyebrows twitched up knowingly, “What
“You don't need to explain. It's alright, okay?” Santa soothed, reaching to give a friendly stroke of John's knuckles and signal to the glass. “Drink some more water,”
Already shivering from the skimming press of John’s lips and brush of his chin, Sherlock took a few seconds to reply, giving John a huff in the meantime, hating how he blushed, wanting more, incredibly close to begging, “...Obviously I’ll make sure not to get him
“You should take him to the park while I’m at work,” John instructed, rolling one shoulder in answer to Sherlock’s sideways scowl. “You were probably already planning on doing that, yes, but even so. I just know it will likely be too late when I get back all the time.”
“Yes. I tend to retain something when it’s been linked with a case of some kind, either in my head or in physical literature. You never know when there will be another museum robbery,” Sherlock replied with a hopeful glance.
relationship in the future?” Greg asked with obvious growing interest, involvement and mild disbelief. At John’s wavering glance he winced and held up the bottle with a dismissing wave. “
“Obviously,” Greg mimicked with a roll of his eyes, crossing his legs in a very accurate impression of the pompous man. “Perhaps you should have a coffee too then? Warm yourself up? - Though I’ve got to say, it’s perfectly warm in here, warmer than outside, at any rate.”
e… on a disproportionate cartoon elf’s body… printed on a pair of… boxer shorts...” His lips twitched, going wonky as he fought with the evident need to laugh or worse, with a raising, crushing tidal rant. "This—"
Greg reached to hook a hand, almost instinctively, under Sherlock’s knee as John stepped towards them, bending the leg enticingly enough to lift Sherlock’s hips, “
“Yeah. Thanks for that. As if this wasn’t embarrassing enough,” John replied with a grumble, suddenly aware of how his damp pants clung to him uncomfortably and how he could feel the soft shape of Sherlock’s genitals through the layers separating them.
“Mm, yes,” Sherlock said dismissively, wanting to get out before another Christmas song started. Feeling the glare John gave him on the back of his head, Sherlock forced a smile. “Merry Christmas to you too.” He swallowed his annoyance and placed his items in front of her, getting out his wallet. “And a happy New Year excreta..”
“Yes, I am,” Sherlock replied, beginning to slowly, playfully, swoop the bowl back and forth in front of John’s face with an arched eyebrow. He liked playing this game with him. Liked asking for his phone or a pen, when it was right next to him. Liked knowing John would end up getting them for him anyway.
Tipping his head down, Sherlock found John standing before him, plate of jammy toast in hand, and a concerned frown on his face, “John,” he said in reply, taking the offered food with a nod of gratitude. “Thank you.”
Deciding that he couldn't just walk out in the pants and nothing else, John reached for his robe and wrapped it around himself, trying to figure out how he would leave, how he would make his return to Sherlock's side. If he was returning to him. Should he even return? Show him? Wasn't that weird? Wasn't this entire situation weird, his whole life? If he came out, robe on, trying to play coy and get back to his room, it would only cause interest, only bring Sherlock to him, make him stalk after, and he wanted to show him, wanted to get it out of the way quickly, going out coyly would be extra strange. He was a thirty year old GP, not a burlesque performer. If he acted confident, if he just walked through to get to his room or, if he went through with showing Sherlock, letting him win and drop his robe, standing proud, that wouldn't work either, that would be equally as strange. Rubbing his face, John choose to just go. Just go for it, whatever it was, whatever he wanted once he stepped out. He had no idea what he was in for in terms of Sherlock's reaction to either decision, but he needed to bite the bullet. He couldn't really stay and hide in the bathroom forever.
“You can have my fortune telling fish,” Sherlock told him with a nod at it with a smile. “Don’t want you feeling left out.”
Greg looked Sherlock over and licked his lips, plainly interested in what was happening though not enough to fully engage, not enough to join in as much as John wanted him to, not yet, “Are you
in the shape of my shirt,” Sherlock corrected him and couldn’t help but smile, stroking John’s thumb with his own, tapping their thumbnails together when John went to reciprocate.
“Ah, yeah, sorry, I can be a bit... withdrawn and times,” John replied, genuinely surprised by the gift and also extremely suspicious. He hadn't expected to retrieve one from any of the staff, any co-worker, not beyond the forced Secret Santa, of course, and for Sarah to go out of her way to buy him something, to get in touch with Mrs Hudson to run things by her, and to hand it to him personally, he was somehow both pleasantly flattered and immensely dubious. He looked down at the perfect placed wrapping paper, smoothing his fingers over it, and nodded in thanks. “You didn't have to go to any trouble for me. - Thank you though, I really appreciate it.” He squidged the gift, glancing from it to her and back. It felt like clothing, but it was too small for a top or trousers. “Should I... open it now?”
“She’d like that,” John said. His smile was soft, features relaxed, eyes focused and alert when he looked at Sherlock. “I’m going to wash, change and get Mrs Hudson’s present.”
! If I wanted just random sex, I’d get it, I’d find it. It’s not like those paths are closed off to me. I just... I wanted to focus on my marriage. Rebuilding it and starting fresh. - Christ,
“Dog themed gifts?” Sherlock echoed with some amusement, finding the idea of such a thing adorably ridiculous. Of course Mrs Hudson would buy them presents that mirrored the latest big change in their lives. He didn’t like how he’d not known about that too, though, how both Mrs Hudson and John had successfully schemed all of it without Sherlock catching even a hint of it. He lifted his eyebrows but John just shrugged mysteriously. “What on earth are ‘dog themed gifts?’”
“I never hear you complaining,” Sherlock sniped back with a peevish, smug, sneering sort of smile, his cheeks flushing a light pink. He was irate, not embarrassed. John knew most of the different kinds of blushes that decorated his cheeks now. Knew when they may appear and even how to attain some of them if he really wanted to. “In fact, I remember, quite distinctly, how much you
“Nahhh!” John shook his head just to show him how utterly wrong he was and almost toppled backwards, yet again forcing the other man to assist, to steady him with big, rough, warm hands. “
because… you were loud… and so I thought you… and then you just…” Motioning vaguely, ridiculously and clumsily with his hands in his stammering explanation, Sherlock finally groaned in defeat and held up his arms, palms showing in placation. “This is all rather new to me. This… reaction to you
to kiss him and yet…” Throwing his arms up, Sherlock turned from her, looking back over at John and pacing, brushing crumbs from his mouth as he turned back to his landlady. “This could be a replacement, you know. He could be giving me a dog so it’s easier for him to leave later on. It’s
"Bells on bobtail ring,' making spirits bright. What fun it is to laugh and sing, a sleighing song tonight!"
John bumped charmingly into Sherlock’s side as they followed after the joyful puppy, keeping as close as could, "I'm surprised there are any shops open today."
, you are,” Sherlock complained, turning his head a little further to avoid eye contact, and then rested his head back on John’s shoulder. “It doesn’t “happen to everyone”…I…lost control of my bodily functions—You’re warm, and close and I’ve…not been…it’s not often that I…I’m unused to being so close to someone and…”
At the start of their strange agreement, John had frequently pulled out to allow Sherlock the time and rest needed from his often intensely shattering orgasms, but had quickly found out that Sherlock wanted John to stay inside him. Liked the thought of being pushed past that sensitivity line until his nerves burned and his body ached. He also rather longingly wanted to experience the feeling of John reaching completion inside him, feeling the throbbing, twitching, hard length of him as he spilled inside the condom. Therefore now, now, John simply followed his instinctual nature. The instinct which was currently telling him to go harder, faster. To give into the need to gasp out loud and cry out Sherlock's name. So he did. He quickened up, he groaned, he panted, he hissed through his teeth, and he scrabbled for Sherlock's hand, grasping, squeezing and knitting their fingers together as he reached his peak. Cried out coarsely as he felt the bright flame inside him explode and came hard with a choked off gasp and a shivering snap of his hips, pushing deep and spilling in thick, hard pulses. Body shaking with the intensity of each spurt.
trying to take the piss. But… no, I’m not overly offended by it,” Sherlock replied, taking the coat to fold over one of his arms. “Not by the underwear anyway. The
John's legs felt weak, like he could barely keep them straight, keep himself up and he sighed, sagging with a breathless, blissed laugh, and staggering aside to catch himself on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, "
“Hopefully the white. I think I'd prefer white,” John replied, studying Sherlock closely and digging his thumb into the base of Sherlock's nape in a circling, pushing, kneading massage. “White is better for Thai, right? And if not, red can give me a hangover and –
“No more coats or outfits or hats for a dog, please,” Sherlock told her, picking up his violin and bow, moving to stand beside her to give her shoulder a fond squeeze. He was thankful for her consideration of the puppy, no matter how silly it was. He was always thankful to her.
...” John tried to interrupt, but Sherlock was seemingly on a rant now, unable or unwilling to stop his tirade against their landlady who really only had the best – if clumsy – intentions.
want—I do appreciate the attention," he mumbled. He felt ashamed and unsure and angry, and the fabric of his pants left almost nothing to the imagination. Cock was swollen and glaringly erect, pushing out, deforming the fabric, making his desire incredibly obvious. "And I wouldn't say
“Two different things,” Sherlock told him with a scoff. “And I’m not avoiding anything. Nothing you’ve said deserves an answer. Mostly because you already
Suddenly enthusiastic and more than a little impressed, Sherlock reached for the letter opener, slicing the envelope with a put on irritated sigh, “What if I don’t want or like it? - Who
A leisurely nod and a murmured “Mmmmm,” rumbled off the walls as Sherlock repeated the movement, and John glanced down watching as Sherlock’s abdominals clenched and flexed as his hips rocked back and forth.
John hadn't even been watching it, had been so lost in the sensation of Sherlock's heated skin under his fingers, that it was all he knew, all he cared to know, and hadn't been paying any attention to the TV, at all. Taking the remote from the arm of the sofa, he switched to a radio channel, one that played soft instrumental and folk-y type songs. John enjoyed such music, enjoyed listening to the simple vocals, and he knew that Sherlock did too. Knew it was calm enough that he wouldn't be disgruntled by any pounding bass line or an obnoxious radio host.
Sherlock trembled, digging his fingers into John’s shoulders, nails slicing deeper enough that he was sure there would be blood, “
kiss you,” Sherlock pointed out in return, adjusting his stance with a sway of his hips, finding the way John shifted with him blissfully marvellous. He wanted to dance with him. Wanted to cling and push and roll and dance. “It just...
you do...” He knew he was rambling. “I do want you to know my body as I know yours. Want you to be the first –
“Mm. Please,” Sherlock replied, making sure to let his mouth twist up into a small smile, enough to persuade John to give him another teaspoon of sugar, because apparently it put John in a much better mood if he did. He often felt like smiling at John anyway, so it was no real hassle for him. In fact it was most pleasant, especially when John returned it with one of his own. John had many smiles. All different. All attached to different moods, thoughts, wants. Sherlock had them all documented. A room of John’s smiles nestled deep within his Mind Palace. “Merry Christmas, John.”
“… Are you sure? I mean, I appreciate the gesture, I do, but won't it be weird? What with you two... bumping uglies?” Greg questioned, eyeing them both as he took a bottle gratefully. “He is naked and
?” he muttered, searching John’s expression when he could see it and then following the movements of his hands, before searching the room, trying to spot this clearly elusive present. He’d not seen anything new or moved since the decorations had gone up.
“Goodnight, Santa!” John shouted against the part of the window that wasn't open, the glass fogging under his breath, giving a wave back before he slumped boneless back against the seat, letting his head fall back on the headrest. “I like y'beard...”
“I know, Mrs Hudson,” John said and dropped the fish back on the table, where it straightened out again.
John looked at him, really looked, and let himself wonder. He wouldn’t kick him out of bed. Wouldn’t say no. Clearing his throat, keenly aware of the space between them, of Sherlock's observing, knowing eyes flitting back and forth, and of Greg intense look of intrigue, John pushed himself to continue, keeping his tone light and twisting it into something flirtatiously playful. Testing the waters. For both himself and Greg.
“Do you always dress to the right?” Sherlock asked, still vaguely rubbing his forehead against him as he spoke.
Rolling on the condom, John added more lube than was strictly required before shuffling closer, positioning and aligning himself, gently pushing the bubbled tip of his covered cock inside, “Okay?” he asked Sherlock, watching glazed eyes meet his, “Doesn't hurt?”
!” John groaned and made it a few steps further, just at the edge of the coffee table, shins just barely skimming the side, catching on a dangling drape of crimson ribbon. There was more to it. There was more to everything. How could Sherlock think it was so simple? Was that what it was to him? Did he not understand? “
,” John moaned, digging his fingers into Sherlock's trapezius muscle. “Keep talking like that and it might not take long until you get your wish...”  Moving one hand, John cupped and stroked Sherlock's cheek, letting his thumb run across Sherlock's lip, before groaning when Sherlock took the digit into his mouth and gave that a suck. "
? Well...all right. I suppose a dog is worth more than one gift in return,” he said, not knowing how he should feel about the change nor the question. Had he said it wrong? Was the hint too vague? Was he wrong? Shoving the tinsel back into place, Sherlock tried to find something to occupy his hands with, something to distract him from the awkward, twisting disappointment, and clutched his hands behind his back. “A laptop and what else?”
what to get you. Just what suited. - I know it’s a few days late but… our days are always hectic this time of year.” Sarah shifted to stand closer to him when he looked the gift over, the grin on her face never faltering, her hands cradled innocently at her front. John narrowed his eyes on her. "Plus, you know, you're always off doing something or act so stand-offish that I decide it's better to leave you be."
The first thing John noticed when he woke up was a shadow, a figure, leaning over him, and for a moment he only stared at it, wondering if it was really there at all or if it was only part of some lingering dream he couldn’t remember. If it was just his mind playing tricks. It happened from time to time. To him, to others. The mind liked to find things in nothing, to feel safe in familiarity, and so would try to make sense of shapes and space, of reality, by sculpting and connecting lines into recognisable figures, objects. This time it was in the form of a person and it took John a moment to realise that the person was Sherlock, that he’d somehow already known it was Sherlock. On some deeper level, on an instinctive level, he’d known who it was.
Sherlock didn't taste of much, a hint of their fabric softener and a touch of his own special scent combined with the musk of sweat, but it was the greatest aphrodisiac John had ever discovered, could ever need. Carefully hooking it with his tongue, John pulled Sherlock's into his mouth and gave it a light pressured suction, feeling the excess inches of his foreskin, the warmth of his flesh against the roof of his mouth. It was intoxicating to taste and feel.
“Perhaps not now,” Sherlock conceded with a tip of his head, finishing off the mince pie with another few bites, then dusting off his hands. “He wants to have lunch with you before we go and get…” He looked over his shoulder at the messy spread of papers. “Orion.”
John laughed, giving a half shrug, “I found him attractive the first day we met and only got more obsessed with the bastard as time went on. - It mostly started after the whole pool situation, sort of a 'we're alive' fumble that progressed into a regular occurrence. It's
Breakfast was soon over and John had headed into the kitchen to wash up their plates. It was, of course, at that moment that Mrs Hudson appeared from the landing.
The room spun unnaturally as he rubbed his face, blinked and widely gaped around him, and John quickly began gulping a few times to try and keep his stomach contents from raising up his throat. When that didn't work he sipped on yet more lager, the last dregs of what was left in his glass, forcing the sensation away until he was able to sit up straight and look around again without the queasy rocking in his mind, the rolling of his stomach, and the overly doubled vision. There were a couple of work groups nearby, dotted around wet tables, chatting well-natured small talk from what John could make out, from what he could understand, whilst wearing silly paper hats from their broken crackers. He wanted a hat. He wanted that small talk, to be included in that group or have one like it, untroubled and so laid back and trusting that he could believe in them, in himself. Why wasn't he more like them? Groaning, John turned his attention to an old man who was sat listening to the darts on the television in the corner and then… and then... then John saw him. A man in a red hat.
“I’d certainly like to repeat a few things we’ve done today,” John said in a guttural provocative tone, turning his head so their noses touched.
“Oh all right,” she mumbled, stroking her fingers through the clump she still held in her hand, “I’ll take these for myself while you deal with the rest.”
Sherlock paused, all consciousness snapping back into place, painfully vivid, and then reared back, “I...
He was clumsy at first, unsure and awkward as he grasped and thumbed the hinge of his jaw, then his touch became sure, steady, and confident. Greg’s fingers slipped down John’s neck, up through his hair, before settling on his shoulders, a hot, comfortable weight. His hands were strong and rough from work, skin and fingernails clean if a bit sticky with beer. John hadn’t noticed them like he had Sherlock’s, though he sure saw them now. Could feel their heat and intent even through his clothes, and was powerless to prevent the shudder that caused.
“I didn’t say I’d help,” Sherlock said when she’d left, reaching for another mince pie and trying to push down on the odd feeling that was building through his body. It made his skin tingle, the hairs on his nape stand on end, his skin prickle with heat, and his heart skip a beat. Was there something there? It was difficult to pinpoint.
“Oh… I er--” he began in a mutter, reaching down to half cup his cock in one hand and shuffle awkwardly, nervously, in place. “Sorry? I guess?”
He had to admit that he too had other ideas for their bedroom activities. Of being held down under Sherlock's weight and filled and taken. On the few occasions during masturbation, he often thought of Sherlock's hands, of his fingers breaching and stretching him open in a way that nobody else had ever done. He imagined Sherlock's tongue inside him, of the burning stretch as Sherlock pressed himself inside with juddering hips and gasped curses. He envisioned what Sherlock might look like above him, eyes intent and lidded, blanketing him with sweat-slicked flesh and snapping, flexing, rolling hips.
,” John responded with a scoff and a disappointed head shake, looking at Greg, “This is why I prefer it when he has me in
does everyone keep saying that?” John asked, throwing his arms in the air, which caused Sherlock's elf persona to wiggle. “Listen, my pants are
John shrugged and brought Sherlock’s tea to his awaiting hands. Now that he was closer, now that Sherlock was really looking, he could see the edges of excitement in that comfortable smile as John continued to stand in the middle of the room, “Do you want it?”
“Mm. You should be. Sometimes. I suppose I do deserve it,” Sherlock slurred, eyes open a slither and mouth curling upwards flirtatiously, impishly. “I can be such a bad,
"Yes." Santa looked at John with kindly eyes, reaching to cover John's hand for a brief moment of understanding. “Extraordinary. - He must be
“Be warned that he might want to show off,” John told him with a grin, “Particularly now you’ve impressed and irritated him in one fell swoop. He'll want to show off and try to make you feel uncomfortable. You know, his normal thing.”
day?” Sherlock criticised, aimlessly poking at the dog coat and trying not to blush more than he already had. He hated when John saw through him so easily. He prided himself on his masks he wore, the wall he’d built up, of how in control he was of his mind, his body, and so to have everything crumble and betray him, shift and break down, was almost too much to fully bear. Sherlock sneaked a glance at John and felt his irritated fear weaken at the look of his face, the colour of his eyes, the feel of his rough, coarse, working fingers in his, and quickly tried to suppress a shudder of emotion. “I’m fine…”
“Sh, it's alright, I know,” John purred, placing an affection peck upon the tip of his nose with a smile. “Just – don't come yet.
Nodding again, this time solemnly, John processed the information and then slid from his stool, tripping over his own feet, “M'gonna go home and talk to him. Just... just
Orion was only too happy to comply, his tongue brushing wet strokes over his skin as John chuckled and patted at his fur, “Such a
“I just want to eat and go to bed,” Greg informed him, opening the fridge to find his leftovers. “There is no ‘hang out with Sherlock’ on that list.” Ah good, it was still alright.
“Sherlock…” he moaned, carefully removing his fingers so not to overstimulate him, “Sherlock, can I fuck you? I need… I
Greg stumbled to his feet in an undignified fumble, almost spilling his beer, but managing to put it down just in time, “I, uh, I don’t know about this. I’ve not... I don’t... I’ve
Sherlock shifted, cutting him off, and John watched with his gut twisting, lingering fizzes of pleasure roughly and immediately extinguished as he got up onto his shaky legs, “I need a shower,” he muttered and shoved at John with a snarl when he stepped towards him. “
?” Greg answered finally, slapping one handcuff on and flashing John a charming, devilish grin as he pulled Sherlock’s long, pale arm up, letting the other cold, empty cuff brush against bare flesh. Sherlock gaped up at him, shaking faintly. “Disciplining? Putting you in your place? Messing about? Pick one. All of them pretty much sum it up.”
“Yes. Yes, why not,” Sherlock replied, trying not to check himself in the mirror again as he went to John’s side.
Sherlock jerked upright, coming close to headbutting John in the chin, “I thought Angelo’s?” he offered, trying to remember where John had taken his dates and which places he’d enjoyed, and then realised he hated remembering anything to do with them and most of the information had been deleted. Heavily and angrily deleted.
“I don’t know,” Greg mumbled around a flickering grin, rubbing at his mouth, the nape of his neck, and then tugging on his buttoned shirt. “What if it gets disruptive? I all but work with you two and...” He exhaled a long breath through his nose and looked again between them. “This
John let out some sort of grunted reply, knowing he was being mocked, being teased, and allowing it, giving Sherlock the time to be bold, to be confident, to be cocky. He liked it. If he was honest with himself, if he let himself admit it, he could say he even adored it. Adored how sure Sherlock could be, how haughty. How poised and unruffled and dominant he liked to play, liked to pretentiously parade it around for all to see, for him to use when he sought fit. He adored all of it because now he knew he could replace it, could remove it, could shuck that part of him for a more primal, more submissive and needy part. John remembered how Sherlock had looked, had moved, when he’d gripped his hair, sucked his cock, thrust up against him. He was sure he would never forget it.
“Hey, don't sulk, this is your fault!” John reminded Sherlock and his pinching mouth. “You're the one who forced my hand into telling him. But he's not bothered –
Grumbling unhappily under his breath, John walked through the kitchen door and looked for Sherlock, surprised he hadn’t heard the man yelling the first moment he’d come home. There was no sign of him however, nothing but more of the mistletoe, which hung above the glass door leading into the corridor, on the border between kitchen and living room, and in the centre of the living room, hanging from one of the light fixtures. It was slightly ridiculous. It was overkill. It was frankly, quite mortifying, especially as John thought he knew what Mrs Hudson was trying to do. Something he should have known would happen, sooner or later.
“You force my hand,” Sherlock complained with a frown, pointing at him, “you and your team. - What do you expect when you all question me at every turn and don’t learn from your mistakes, don’t use your eyes, your brains, and
on me!” John answered, a little offended and a little too loudly so, making the barman look over and laugh.

In what felt like mere seconds he was roused from the warm, soft slumber with whispers of his name and light kisses on his face, hands rubbing against his arm and fingers, and he groggily opened his eyes to the sight of a recently awakened John smiling at him less than an inch from his nose.
John was barely aware of Sherlock gripping himself, of using John's come to finish himself off, far too quickly for John to do more than wheeze out a laugh, "You... you're
“Merry Christmas Ryan,” Sherlock said giving the woman a sneering, triumphant grin as they turned for the door, Orion woofing and bouncing around their feet, ears perked, head tilted. “...
like dominant Greg,” John chuckled, a raging bubble of arousal churning erratically in his gut from the display and the reaction. It wasn’t a shocking revelation, as John knew what Sherlock liked, what he wanted, what he positively responded to, but he hadn’t seen it from the outside. He liked it. He wanted to see more from the new perspective. “Discipline him because I'm too bloody soft half the time.”
A breathless jumble of sweetly rough, complimenting words were murmured and brushed against his perspiring temple as he was lowered down to lie on Sherlock's panting torso. Blissed out and euphoric, John pressed a kiss to Sherlock's wet hairline, shivering when Greg moved in to breathe the both of them in as if he couldn’t help himself.
Stroking at John’s fingertips, Sherlock gave another shrug, this one looser, slower, allowing their arms to rub together for longer, “We can go to one if you want.”
?” John croaked when everything came crashing down over him again, the ribbons, the bows, the nudity, and he quickly averted his gaze, flushing hot and taking several shaky steps to lean against the back of his armchair. “Why are you
before?” Sherlock groused and let out a long sigh, smoothing down his shirt and clenching his jaw. “Surely the answer is obvious?”
“Why don’t you sit on the bed?” John suggested, pointing at the space beside Sherlock that had been purposefully left and trying not to feel childishly envious of Greg for glimpsing Sherlock’s body before him, “Or you could get a chair from the kitchen, though that might be a bit too clinical. Just –
With a slightly sharp intake of breath, Sherlock turned his head to John, then glanced at the receptionist, at the papers laid out, the dulled computer screen not properly twisted at the correct angle, and nodded, “Yes,” he told John. “I’m here.”
The shiver that took Sherlock’s body was almost violent in its promiscuous yearning, “Yes,” he keened, groping at John’s lower back and hips. “
“Well, you do prattle on sometimes,” John chortled nervously, his breathing a bit faster in the small space between them as he responded to Sherlock with a tensing of his thighs and an adorted twitch of his hips. “You…like to hear yourself talk and I just…just let you…natter on.”
,” John sighed and reached for the glass of water when it was placed in front of him, downing four long, deep gulps before pulling back and wiping his face with the back of his hand. “M' mate told me that.
“It’s no problem at all, John,” she replied, though the happiness in her voice sounded slightly forced. “Thank you so much for the mixer.”
“Wasn’t aroused then, though, of course,” Greg added in a mutter, eyes flickering over Sherlock’s supine figure. They didn’t linger anywhere until they’d roamed all the way up to his face, only then did they stutter to a stop, seized by Sherlock’s impactful captivating stare. “Is it in some part because of me? Should I be flattered?”
Before they got to the door left ajar for them, John stopped Greg, leaning close gently, “Listen, if this isn't for you,
He saw John turn to him from the corner of his eye, and for a moment he thought he saw pity, but then John’s arms were pulling him close, his fingers holding his head, his mouth at his ear, “I shouldn’t have said anything.”
!” The rough nudge from John’s foot widened Sherlock’s stance further and he slid into the new position, lifting his hips back. From what John could see of him, Sherlock looked good, bent and arched and waiting.
"Alright then," John said, scooping out three healthy sized curls and placing them atop the steaming pudding in the bowl Sherlock held out to him. "Mrs Hudson?"
of information?” Sherlock asked with a piercing, suspicious narrowing of his eyes, watching John’s every move. “How many questions?”
“You know you're the boss,” John scoffed playfully, looking at his lips and wanting. He should talk though. Talk about things, about them. “In every way possible. I'm your trusty number two.”
?” he questioned and John glanced to him after a few awkward moments to see his gaze narrow, to watch him straighten up and move to stand properly in his open doorway.
“Alright. I'll bite - Who am I then?” the man asked, seeming to be more and more amused by John's drunken shenanigans the more time that went by. "Who do
be uncomfortable if he admitted he was bi,” Greg said, picking up their mugs and checking the content of Sherlock’s. There was still a little left, but not much.
” he confessed with a dry chuckle, only realising what he'd said, what he'd let out, seconds after it was done. He couldn't take it back. Did he even want to? Why did he have to be drunk or high on arousal to be open?
"Bet I could get it so that, whenever you thought about the song, heard it playing somewhere, you'd have pleasant, happy little thoughts," John cut in and grinned at Sherlock bemusement, beginning a soft sort of swing jazz version of Jingle Bells, trying to impersonate Sinatra way.
you think I am,” John huffed, but halved the cards one by one until they each had a small pile to pick up. “The quickest and easiest is definitely snap though.”
“Definitely not,” Sherlock laughed, wanting to kiss him again. He wished they could be kissing all the time.
Sherlock, tickled by John’s charm, found himself grinning back as he followed, bumping his head gently into the back of John’s, nosing the hair there, “I’ll pay the cab fare.”
“She caught your good side too,” John said, bringing his hand up to stroke at Sherlock’s cheek. “Look. You look so… warm.”
, John! - He told me you seemed a bit out of it. That you looked feverish and overworked. Now I know why!” he said. “You kinky sod!”
“Didn't hurt you did I?” John asked with a gasp, attempting to catch his breath. Using his unsteady, clumsy fingers to hold the base of the condom, he cautiously withdrew, rubbing his thumb across Sherlock's puffy rim and then standing on wobbly legs to take the condom and dispose of it. "
sorry for it. You know how he gets sometimes. He can’t help it almost. He lashes out when he’s scared and he’s scared when he’s confused, conflicted, when his mind battles with his heart.”
Carefully ripping at the tape that held it closed, peeling back the wrapping paper, John moved it to the side to peer within and frowned as he looked at what seemed like a small black rectangle of fabric. Neatly folded fabric. He opened it up, eyes going wide and mouth falling open as he looked at his present. It was a pair of pants. Black boxer short pants, but where the fly was positioned was a cartoon elf, or rather the body of the elf, as it's head was replaced with the head of Sherlock, the expression on his face half smug and half contented. A Sherlock elf cupping and basically hugging the part where John's flaccid penis would rest and come out of.
?” John just shrugged in reply and so Sherlock mimicked him in frustration, throwing the stick once more. “Then no thank you.”
your landlady got it from. He has a cracking expression on his usually stoic face. I even took a copy for myself.”
“Yes, I know, but, um, as I said earlier, he’s a bit loud,” he continued, not letting Sherlock’s heavy sigh derail him, “and if you're not sure you're ready for that, for hearing that, then… maybe you could put the TV on or something? - You're more than welcome to come in and watch though or join in if you feel the urge to. That would be… fine. Right, Sherlock?”
“I think you should talk to him,” Santa suggested in a soft tone, giving him a look of compassion. “Talk to him and tell him how you feel. Lay it
Sherlock looked up at John’s face, “I don’t know if…” he trailed off and blinked, not entirely sure what he was going to say, and instead just nodded, clicking his case closed. “Yes. Of course.”
“Let’s try this, then,” John pulled him in for a chaste and light kiss. It was experimental kiss for John and Sherlock both, and John exhaled a shaky breath through his nose, kissing Sherlock again and running his fingers up into his hair. He gave in to the need to grip at the thick curls and increased the pressure of his lips against Sherlock’s, keeping his mouth closed until Sherlock shivered and clutched at John’s arm.
deserve someone better. Someone who loves you. Who treats you with respect. Who actually sleeps and, well shags
Slightly thrown by how quickly Sherlock tossed his questions at him, John blinked, adjusted his position and then shook his head vigorously, negatively, “Not at
John made a small affirmative noise, lost within a shuddering breath as Sherlock tilted and dropped his hips minutely and their lengths slid against each other with more purpose. John’s mind clouded with arousal faster than he thought possible, faster than it had for a long time, and the clutching dread, and panic and embarrassed that came with having your erect penis brushed against by your best friend’s equally erect penis, was overthrown with a dizzying desire that shot up his spine. John knew he was going to have to address what was happening, and what was ultimately going to happen, at a later date, but couldn’t for the life of him care.
“Can I?” Sherlock’s words were soft, his touch hesitant until John’s groan cleared the worried furrow from his forehead.
John grinned and moved to sit at Sherlock’s side again, picking up the bits of wrapping paper that had been scattered on the floor and folding them up, “You’d better enjoy that; I think I’m in Mrs Hudson’s bad books now.”
Unwinding the scarf from his neck, John waited for Greg to stop wiping his feet, finding his sudden timidness rather amusing considering how often he'd barrelled in on prior occasions, and then slipped around to head up the stairs.
“...That’s just your dick talking,” Sherlock mumbled after a few seconds and John adjusted his gaze to find Sherlock giving him a teasing, playful, though soft smile. “Or what is it people call it?
John headed to the bathroom, disposing of the condom in the bin with a whistle before rinsing a flannel in some warm water, squeezing and folding and wringing. His rosy face greeted him in the mirror when he looked up from his task and he took a moment to stare. He looked happy, healthy, and there were red marks where Greg’s teeth had grazed him, a developing love bite behind his ear, and stubble rash on the flesh of his arm. John swallowed thickly and touched each spot in turn, surprised at how fast the sizzle of renewed arousal ignited.
Frowning in confusion, Sherlock stopped and bent to him, nosing his way across John’s cheek to get to his mouth, sliding their lips together very lightly, “Stop being so awkward,” he whispered as he pulled back an inch. “You’re ridiculous. I’ve seen you erect. I’ve been erect
John ducked his head, “No. No, I don’t think so – I never thought anything of it at the time, but since sharing this with him, I’ve had to re-evaluate my life alongside my sexuality. There were… a few blokes that I suppose had a crush on or felt something for, but I didn’t really look into it or ever felt the need to try. Until him. He was the first that I had strange feelings about and the first time I acted on it. Guess I was too much of a wuss before I met him,” he admitted, finding the darkness and intimate setting a balm to his otherwise self-conscious and compromising thoughts.
that people think we're a couple?” John questioned, rushing to grab for Sherlock and turn him around, core hotly shuddering at the look in his eyes. “That has never and I mean
John's fingers squeezed at his and tugged him closer to the desk. He became vaguely aware of the scratching of pens and the clicks of a computer keyboard, but he paid the most attention to the thu-thumping of John's beat, growing steadily faster as time passed. At some point, all the noises stopped and Sherlock felt John squeeze his elbow.
As if he’d been gagging for an order, for something to follow, Sherlock did as he was told, grasping at himself, stroking harder, faster, in a maddening need, leg muscles contracting so hard that they sprang out from their crossed position. He scrambled at the coffee table with his toes, knocking several rolls of ribbon onto the floor. They span off, leaving a road of fabric behind them, and John gave his hair a small tug in reprimand, leaning in with a shaky breath to peer down the length of his torso, playing with the short dark hairs of his crotch. He was as close to Sherlock’s erection that he would let himself get. Could feel the heat coming off him. Could even smell his musk in the air.
