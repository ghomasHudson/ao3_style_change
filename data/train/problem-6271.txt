“That’s it darling, relax,” Tony instructed, as Steve’s body began to soften under his hands. And then he ran his thumbs just a little harder over the dense muscles below Steve’s shoulder blades, digging into that little store of tension there. Steve let go of a sigh he didn’t know he was holding in, feeling like his bones were falling apart under Tony’s movements, like he could just keep melting under this feeling of release until there was nothing left of him…
Steve felt a cold, creeping horror cover his body as two lab techs appeared, each pushing a medical trolley… one of which was laid out with syringes, and tourniquets, and IV bags.
Tony could feel the beginnings of that euphoria clouding into his mind as he licked that beautiful taste from Steve’s skin. A warmth and brightness seeping into everything, like a sudden burst of sunlight.
trying. I trust you with my feelings because it turns out they did always matter to you… And maybe I should have assumed all that, thinking about how well I know you… And, actually, maybe a lot of this happened because I didn’t trust you enough… I should’ve given you more benefit of the doubt. You’d earned it…”
anything for Steve to say.
“We should probably… Go now…” He managed. This time it was Pepper that laughed.
He made a genuine effort to pay attention to that one. Like he knew he wouldn’t be allowed to play at all if he didn’t listen to the safety briefing.
“So, yeah, that’s it, thank you.”
Knowing everything was good
Clasping his wrist back into the cuffs.
The Red Skull smiled back, as though he knew exactly what Steve meant, and reached out to take the stone from him.
Tony felt as though his heart had stopped in his ribs, as Steve’s gaze hesitated on one of the prototype gauntlets that he’d left on the worktop. Even though he knew his heart wasn’t even beating in the first place… he didn’t know what else to call that sudden pressure in his chest.
Steve’s muscles coiled in temper, his legs already tensed so that he could stand, and walk right over to Clint, and-
But Steve couldn’t speak.

They found a short, bare-looking hallway, with three doors on each side – and Zan, standing impatiently, in the middle of it. She gave them a sharp nod, and turned on her heel, striding purposefully toward the door furthest from them, on the right. Steve and Tony glanced at each other briefly, and then at their surroundings, before they followed her.
“Well, if you’re done with…

It seemed to go on forever.

Tony felt that pressure building in his chest again. The struggle to find the right words, the resistance to saying any of them out loud. That same nameless conflict he’d been wrestling with all week… that strange feeling that he didn’t want the things he wanted.
But it still
He’d never felt as

Steve threw his weight behind his left leg, intending to just throw Adam aside. He barely heard him say,

Steve knew that he
An excited murmur broke out in the room, which added to the creeping feeling gathering on Steve’s skin. He knew the showcase thing rang a bell… But every time he tried to go back to that foggy memory, he could only find the spike of panic and the words ‘truth serum’ - apparently, his reaction to that detail had been strong enough to blot everything else out-
This was,

Judging himself by the same criteria he thought fair for other people… That… seemed like quite a sizeable revelation, now that he was thinking about it…
And Tony actually giggled.
But Steve had worked out – quite comprehensively, and about three minutes too late – that he felt something special for Tony. That he wanted Tony to feel
Steve’s stomach turned to water.
“It was just… all so much, then. And I know it sounds pathetic, and I’m supposed to be Captain America and I know all of us have, I mean, what you’ve been through too, and I know I can’t really say… but, I just…
“Oh, me neither,” Steve reassured him, when he finally worked out what Tony was talking about. “It’s a serum thing…”

He knew it was surreal - that, at the time, there had been all sorts of observations about why it was a ridiculous situation to find himself in...

“Do you want to sit down?” He said instead, gesturing to the couch. “I’ll make coffee.”
They kept their eyes locked on one another as they both strained to listen…

That really did make Steve feel just a bit better.

“You got arrested?” Rhodey interjected, more animatedly.
“Jesus Tony…” Steve murmured, running his eyes over him.
“I love you,” Steve whispered, overwhelmed and emotional.
Tony winced, as he rolled his head and shook out his arms. It certainly felt like he’d been lying in the same position for ten hours. He’d done it often enough to be able to judge these things. This was the dazed sluggishness that came after he’d worked way beyond his own limits, and then slept for far too long afterwards. The painful stiffness that only happened when he’d slept deeply enough to stay completely still. The dry thickness in his head that he only got after ten solid hours in bed. Or, on the couch – hence the

he’d adopted a completely different persona to make this offer - why he was making this offer at all, seeing as he hadn’t in the first timeline.
They paused in the lobby of the second floor, a few feet from the bottom of the stairs. Tony glanced at the politely-bored young woman, waiting to accept invitations. Then at the double doors on the upper landing, the electronic keypad and the security camera. Then he looked at Steve.
And it
Because,
And, as Tony shrugged his way out of the last of his clothes and settled himself into Steve’s arms, relinquishing himself completely to the warmth of his chest, he recognised that was all he cared about too.
And then, maybe fifty feet from Tony’s front door, he found himself coming to a stop.
And, obviously, there were a thousand things that Steve would’ve liked to say to that. But an idea had just occurred to him, and it took precedence.
They barely paused at the foot of Tony’s bed, their hands reaching for one another impatiently – instinctively. When Steve pulled him close again Tony was smiling too much to kiss him properly. He was getting increasingly high on this surge of happiness, more delighted by everything the more delighted he was. His movements were messy and demanding as he clawed Steve’s T-shirt over his head, impatient to feel Steve’s bare skin under his hands. And then he ran his eyes over Steve’s perfect broad shoulders, and the smooth expanse of his chest…
He didn’t even ask himself how he knew where Tony was.
. That I’m not saying any of this
So, almost trying to goad himself into it now, he glanced over at Steve-

“But.
“I promise,” Steve smiled, mostly just pleased he could go back to his own thought process…
And, with that, Tony turned on his heel and literally

And he would’ve turned and stormed out of the workshop there and then, without so much as a backwards glance…

“No.” Tony answered, quietly… but sure.

“I – Yes,” Steve answered, far too quickly.

And then, suddenly, Tony was standing right there next to him.
, thinking back to the instructions he’d heard before and the things he’d learned about all manner of tech… the same way he’d worked out how to use all of modern technology, with such little fanfare…
“Why would you bring that up?” Steve continued, more angrily.
This was the first time – possibly in his entire life – that Tony had so much difficulty concentrating on his work.
And then Steve actually held his breath, steeling his shoulders before he added the all important,
“Oh, Tony, fuck yes, fuck-” Steve begged, his whole body already tensing in a growing need to come. Tony drew back, running his tongue over Steve’s slit again as his hand slipped away from Steve’s leg and curled around his own dick. “Please, baby, please-”
He could see the blood moving under her skin, too. He could see her breathing.
He would not lean up, or moan, or
By that night, Tony was beginning to feel a little more like himself. Still somewhat emotional, and confused, and unsettled… But he did feel better for a few hours sleep. His head felt clearer now. Things had started to seem a bit more real.

That, fundamentally, something about his very identity was at odds with ever being as honest and as needy and as reactionary as
He retrieved his phone from the kitchen counter, and sent a hasty text to Steve to say that he’d be able to stop by in an hour or so. Obviously, he could’ve been there in half the time - but his every available second had been given over to the ‘Hydra project’ recently, and he felt like he needed to indulge in a few moments of silence, first.
It felt
And Tony really
“Do you care if I tear this shirt?” He whispered, his voice hot and hurried and blunt.
The very fact that Steve had made the connection - the fact that he’d gone looking for it - was the symptom of a much deeper, more fundamental understanding. Something that felt like an enlightenment and a confirmation all at once.
He turned to the next page, and found a few typed lines that had been xeroxed so many times he could barely make them out,
Tony Stark had just never fit into the boxes he’d been given. That was all.
And the surge of nauseating horror, as Steve realised…
The perfect shape of him, right there, warm under Steve’s hands-
Steve subconsciously rubbed his palms on the fabric of the couch – again. He could swear his hands weren’t this sweaty when they left the room… and he

“But you’re surprised I’m defending him?” Steve huffed.
And then he just… did. He just dropped his head and kissed Tony’s neck, slow and deep and clearly intentioned, his hands caressing more roughly over Tony’s waist, pulling him close.
“No, but I… I shouldn’t have… That was… really selfish, I’m sorry…” Tony muttered, looking down. “And you are…just…

Tony wondered… Was it possible that

“Oh, I’m sure you do,” he nodded, “I’m sure you know exactly how I feel, and exactly what I’m thinking, because clearly you know everything. So, perhaps you know enough to answer a few simple questions - have I committed any sort of crime?”
He didn’t even think about what he was saying as he breezily concluded,
He knew he probably should… But, right now at least, Tony just couldn’t muster any anxiety from anywhere. It was like being drunk. He had this innate sense of security and entitlement and confidence –
And I know I didn’t respond
And he
That same frantic hunger for more, growing more painful and desperate with every second. That feeling of being repeatedly pushed up against the very edge of himself, never quite being able to push through it. The feeling of complete and total fullness swelling up in him again and again – the feeling of falling away from it over and over. The frustration growing at the same pace as the pleasure. That pressure building, under his skin.

And then he saw that questioning expression flicker across Steve’s features, almost pleading, his fingertips still pressing against Tony’s skin…

pang of guilt, along with Tony, that he’d not been attentive enough when JARVIS first spoke up… But Bucky was fine. Steve had heard that much, and it was all he needed to hear-
And then another, heavier wave washed over him, and Steve was simply knocked prone under the force of it.
And Tony
The wonderful, comfortable space it left behind. Like Tony had sliced through a layer of scar tissue, like he’d literally cut something free inside Steve, like Steve was suddenly able to breathe for the first time in so long.
And then a thicker, hotter wave of pleasure washed over his face, as Tony slid two fingers inside him.
“Hey,” he smiled back, strolling through to find Tony standing at the kitchen counter, already pouring him a coffee. That warm contentment continued to spread through Steve’s chest, as he recognised all the little joys of domestic life. Having something besides empty silence to walk into. Having someone think to pour him a drink. Having someone to ask him,

how amazing that was…

He flinched slightly, and wondered if this was the sort of thing he wasn’t supposed to be thinking about…
Steve was suddenly so keenly aware that Tony never smiled at him anymore… that he probably never would again. That he missed Tony so very much. He missed seeing Tony the way those two women saw him now, he missed watching him laugh and listening to him speak and feeling comfortable in his company. And Steve knew it was all his fault, and he knew he had no right to sulk about it… but it still

“-As guests of honour, you’ll have full access to everything, and it will be entirely your choice what you want to take part in-”
He felt tiny, and lost, and confused.
Tony’s cock pulsed sharply, and he touched himself before he could think to stop it. Just an impulsive response to pain, at first. But then he felt that friction shock through his body, a blissful relief and a deeper ache all at once. He froze, knowing that he
to that bed
He had no idea what Steve was feeling right now.
Steve understood Tony’s instinct to retreat from his rant, once he’d had it. He saw the hundred of people who’d ignored Tony’s hurt feelings, or belittled them, or asked him what right he had to them in the first place. The learned response of just not showing them, trying not to have them…
It was only curiosity that stopped him.
So, still smiling at his own foolishness, Tony reached up to dim the lights, and whispered, out loud,

thought Steve was at his absolute loveliest like this - and he’d always taken a deep, emotional pleasure being able to look at Steve, unguarded and unashamed and happy, in the moments after he came…

“I have one, Rhodey has one, and Pepper has one. In paper form, on the strict instruction that they lock it in an attic…” Tony’s voice slowed as he spoke, trailing off into a heavy pause. Steve could just sort of feel that there was something else.
Tony laughing joyously as Steve pushed him down on the floor of a public room, letting Steve undress him, parting his legs for him and arching his back
Bucky decided he’d rather be in a secure psychiatric facility after all. And you were happy to leave him in
“And then I kissed you back,” Steve reminded him, bringing one hand to the side of Tony’s face, gently tilting his head up-
Tony went ahead – leading the way while Steve gently encouraged her to follow, a constant presence at her back as they made their way out of the room. Then, as they reached the end of the corridor, Tony subtly hung back. Steve waited until they’d managed to get Maribelle cornered, both of them blocking her in at the end of the hall, before he spoke again.
Steve stirred again, and this time his eyes fluttered open, blinking against the light…
He never said it would always be simple. What he’d actually said was that it
“And I don’t mean for you,” Bucky explained. “I mean for
Bucky looked up, and waved at him - and Tony wasn’t sure if he’d ever been as happy to see anyone in his life.
“I love you” Tony answered, his voice almost slurring… And then Steve felt him melt into sleep right there in his arms.
But it was better to forget. It was better to focus entirely on this one thing he was confident in, and pretend the rest of it just wasn’t happening.
And, of course, that started Bucky laughing - which made Tony laugh even harder.
“Half the time I don’t actually know what

“No, no,” Tony shook his head. “I mean
“Well, give me a couple of hours snooping, probably quite a lot.” Tony considered. “There’s a hell of a lot of research data, that would probably tell us something…”
That desperate pleasure sinking into a low ache
“Hey,” Tony greeted him with a sad smile, his body softened by that hopeless sort of kindness you see at funerals.
But he couldn’t even

“...Well, yeah, obviously,” Scott stammered, throwing a helpless glance in Sam’s direction. “I mean, without him, time travel is just the fevered dream of a madman, right? And yeah, that’s one of those things they said couldn’t be done, and he’s the one who made it work-”
, and like him for that-
Tony pushed himself up again so that he could move down Steve’s body, peppering urgent little kisses over his chest and stomach, grinning at the frenetic way Steve grabbed at him. He unfastened Steve’s belt, and tugged his pants down over his hips, Steve arching and writhing and doing everything he could to wriggle free of them.

And then his grabbed at Tony’s shoulder, and his hip, and rolled Tony onto his stomach in one swift motion.

“What am I going to do about what?” Steve asked coolly, pulling into their regular parking space.
After that, it was just a timeless darkness of slippery thoughts and distant sensations...
Steve could feel it, hot and wet and thick over his chest-
He’d never taken Tony’s help for granted - he’d never dared dream it would be offered. Certainly, not like this. Steve had simply assumed that he would have to take down SHIELD, and rescue Bucky, and rebuild the Avengers all on his own-

there. A shiny burst of brilliant white joy, and excitement, and pride…
Whether he knew it or not, Steve had already been fundamentally changed by this mission. This had been Steve’s first opportunity to really think about things since he was dragged from a living-death and into an alien world - the first time he could really look at his surreal existence without being neck deep in it. For these past few days Steve had been himself and only himself, without the confines of expectation or responsibility, with no one there to expect him to know what normal meant…

Tony smirked.

And Tony was already poised to move, when she so casually added,

And Tony didn’t even know which part had taken control of his faculties, which part had recognised the seriousness of the situation and which part was able to respond to it-
himself to live by reason, take all those painful but necessary precautions. He could think about how to condense Bucky’s treatments into fewer appointments, make sure not to engage in personal conversations… Just tell Steve not to come with him, next time. All of which was just unbearable, obviously.
And he realised… that was obviously what Tony had been thinking, when he mentioned JARVIS
himself…
He trailed off when he heard Steve’s bitter sigh, Steve’s shoulders slumping under the weight of a revelation that he’d fully expected. The sad, disappointed laugh that slipped out under his breath was entirely genuine - and he could see that both Nat and Nick felt it. Nat especially seemed unduly put out by it, her mask slipping for a full two seconds as she struggled to place such a personal reaction from a total stranger.
“JARVIS, put my room into Migraine mode and clear my calendar for the rest of the day,” He decided, somewhat irritably.
“You think?” Steve snapped, sarcastically. And then he softened, and sighed, “I’m sorry.”
But this wasn’t like that first time – this time the answer
His body reacted before his head could work it out. A rush of excitement that made him feel weak and heady, a sudden burning need that was almost painful… a queasy sickness in the pit of his stomach…
And Steve

“So, I have a question, and I don’t know if it’s going to be an offensive question, but I kind of think I have to ask,” Tony mused, his eyes still fixed on the ceiling.

He recognised a very particular pang of affection, something that came directly from his personal desperation to keep Bucky safe. A feeling that naturally followed whenever you looked at someone, whoever they were, and put your whole heart into praying,
It was either sex, or blood…
And Steve could only nod. Because, yes.
“Is Steve okay?” Tony cut in, almost before she’d finished speaking.
“And did you
He could hear Steve’s voice echoing in his recent memory, a phrase that had still hung in the air as Tony burst into the room,
Steve sighed, happily, and stood up. He took one final look at Brooklyn, 1938. He acknowledged that this had been home to him once, and would always be home to him, in a way. He remembered all the moments that he was sad were gone forever, and smiled to think that they were happy moments in the first place.
“Why hoped?” Tony asked, slowing lowering to sit on the couch, gesturing for her to do the same. Zan’s eyes flitted around the room, like a wild animal looking around a cage. Cautiously, she sat.
Steve felt a little curling of guilt, low in his gut. He thought back to the night before, to Bucky saying that his arm felt entirely different since that final procedure. The little hint of excitement as he tried to explain what he meant, the way he’d flexed his fingers as he tried to find the words. In the end, he’d settled for ‘normal’.
It wasn’t just something he felt… it was something he

Before Steve had even moved, Tony had his arm raised, placing it gently against Steve’s chest as he took an aggressive step towards Wesley-
But Tony really couldn’t believe how efficiently she’d got the better of him.
He could look for interviews and accounts by the first SHIELD agents, see if any of them mentioned Peggy…
They slipped between the bars and pushed through the door – a calculated risk. There was more chance of them being caught if they stopped to listen, than if they took the chance and went right in.

But then he thinks again of Steve calling him by his name, and he realises that he
“So… Lots of things happened last night…” Tony heard himself saying, most of his attention still focused on the inside of his own head. “And… Now I’m not sure if everything just changed… or if, maybe everything is exactly like I thought it was, really, and all that’s happened is that I’ve just fucked everything up…”
to tell Steve that he loved him. Tony had wanted to say it so many times-
And that was how he’d come to collect forty mouldy smelling file boxes in the first place.
Leaning his weight back against the kitchen counter, Tony closed his eyes and tried to picture a future with Pepper where they could both be happy-
for Steve-
he would never be able to comprehend, before he nodded,
“Well, actually, the security footage should be cutting out intermittently throughout the building, about now.” Tony breezed on, making sure
When they got to the living room, Tony gestured to one of the couches,
And then he felt Steve’s body freeze, bracing hard against Tony with a choked moan, coming over his stomach-
Steve looked up at him, watching Bucky’s face as a careful consideration melted into a measure of relief… Steve knew Bucky well enough to read his expression. He could almost hear what he was thinking.

weird, and it really doesn’t feel like just, a trauma reaction, or whatever… But I guess I wouldn’t know,” he mused. “But I do know that, whatever the reason, I did just snap last night - and I know I can’t just do that, and I’m sorry for it, and I know I have to figure all that out… But, for what it’s worth, none of that is on you…” He saw Tony look up at him, a questioning expression on his brow - and Steve cringed in acknowledgement. “And I know I said it was all just a reaction to you… And, actually, I don’t even know if that’s true, really...”
Tony melted into it, a tingling warmth spreading through him as Steve teased his lips apart. He let himself fall into Steve’s chest, writhing up against him, revelling in every perfect inch of him. His heart swelled when he heard Steve sigh, overjoyed and longing.
By the time Steve made it out of the bedroom it was seven thirty – and Tony was just pouring his third cup of coffee.
And then he heard Steve hang up with an impatient huff. He looked up in time to see Steve giving his phone an unimpressed glare - which struck Bucky as faintly amusing, for some reason.
, Steve was already quite sure that Tony had never said he liked him. Steve had spent hours combing through every conversation they’d ever had… Sometimes looking for that, specifically.

All the things he thought he could never have…

something intimate and personal and… creepy?
There was a dull spike of guilt as Tony scrambled to kneel beside the photographer - although whether it was because he might’ve ignored a man with a brain haemorrhage, or because he’d left Steve’s side, Tony wasn’t sure.
And then he pressed a tender kiss to Steve’s neck, the tip of his tongue tracing over the vein before he let his teeth rest against Steve’s skin. Steve felt the blood surge to meet him, a heat flooding up through his chest, an ache building as his heart pumped faster than his body could contain it-

Eventually the heat of his own breath against the sheets became claustrophobic. Steve pulled his head free with a petulant groan, curling the duvet into his fists. He clenched the frustration deeper into his muscles, the way he might’ve jabbed at a toothache… Until at last it burned out into an insolent sort of sadness, and then he indulged in that.

Tony could picture Steve’s beautiful lips… and remember the feeling of them against his mouth…and his chest… and his cock…
He’d found the specific time and place they’d been taken from…
And all he knew was that everything felt good.
“Okay, I’ll put my top AI on it,” Tony laughed. “But I should probably finish with this project first…” he suggested, gesturing to Bucky’s arm.
But – and wasn’t this darkly comic – he’d actually thought that maybe this might be a chance to talk to Tony.

It looked… Right, somehow.
Something that he’d been flinching from just much, he realised now… something that was also
“Like it was written by an alien who usually writes in squares.” Tony sighed, looking away from his screen and back to Steve again. “Also, I’ve just done a basic scan – and none of these inputs are in an alien language. There are no non-recognised keyboards used. So, no one’s password is in Varian. That was probably a Post-it note translating those words

far out rumours?”
He forgot the phone.
Because he loved Steve. That night Tony loved Steve with all the pain and passion of a first crush. He loved his smile, and his sweetness, and his endless, puppy-like determination. He loved entirely arbitrary things about him, the way he pinched his lips when he was reading and the fact that he put the milk in before the coffee and the hint of a Brooklyn accent that still edged some of his words – for no reason other than they were
“…Do you still want to have that cup of tea?” He suggested.

And he couldn’t think of them now, without remembering what it had come to. He couldn’t bare to think of what they might’ve been, by now, if only things hadn’t… if only
Steve suddenly realised how completely ridiculous that would’ve sounded…
“Yours, I’m yours, only yours,” sounded as though it was coming from miles away - Tony didn’t even recognise his own voice. He’d forgotten where he ended and the rest of the world began. There was only that thick, pulsing bliss, beating through his body in time with his racing heart.
“Focus” He said, looking pointedly at the screen while Tony shook himself to his senses.
Tony-”
It wasn’t a specific moment that Steve wanted, but a specific

had seemed gripped by the overwhelming physical terror that had paralysed Wesley, from the second he regained consciousness…
Tony smiled. He could tell that Rhodey was in the same state he was, which was reassuring…
. “He came over, after all the official ceremonies and celebrations had taken place – that was taken at about four in the morning.”
, but it’s not nearly as severe as that makes it sound.”
He told himself not to think about that night – and did it anyway.
“I, uh, I haven’t had a chance to say this since, but… Thank you, for saying something to Nick, last week…”
“Oh God Tony are you sure?” He panted, barely leaving gaps between the words –
“Very, very few,” he accepted, reluctantly. “That one was taken on Rhodey’s insistence – I asked him what he wanted as a gift, and he said photograph. I asked him if he was sure he wouldn’t prefer a private island or something… But he was sure. So, yeah, there exist exactly three photographs of me.”
“And you’re just keeping them waiting,” he bit out, bouncing the ball at his feet a few times before he looked up.
He thought of Tony feeling inadequate and inhuman.
If it had been up to Steve how to respond, he would probably have had an anxiety attack. Stuttered and babbled and said all the wrong things – probably far too many of them.
Steve bit out an irritated breath. He couldn’t believe that Stape thought that was

And then of course there was the risk of panic - chaos in the international system, power grabs between different agencies, the chance that legitimate SHIELD departments and projects would be lost in the fallout…
Which seemed weird, but there it was.
Deliberately, he snuggled closer into Steve and threw a heavy arm across his stomach. He looked up at him, and waited for Steve to meet his eye before he said, in as confident a tone as he could manage,
don’t want to go-”
“For them?” Tony repeated, frowning.

“…What?” Tony blinked.
Also, he was hot.
He remembered a version of Nat that had so obviously been worth that effort. A version of her that Tony had left out of his rants, ignored in his retelling of events, and then forgotten in his rage…
“Yeah, um, okay,” he nodded, and then struggled to add, “thank you, for this.”
There was a fine spray of water over his chest, as he held the cup under the stream. He watched, mindlessly, as the foam burst into a bright cerise, and then faded into a soft pastel pink… and then into nothing… He carried on like that until a memory piped up out of nowhere. The cheery voice of one of the many nurses he’d met in his first few days out of the ice,
While Tony dealt with the mostly technical challenges of getting Bucky safely into Cryo-freeze, Steve had marched on with the mission - which meant that
Mindlessly, Tony clawed at Steve’s shirt, wanting to be closer - wanting to feel every inch of him. He heard the little hum of comprehension; he
Somewhere, there were probably all sorts of thoughts that he wasn’t capable of pursuing. The ideas that

Partly, it was because he’d already decided to do this another way - and he’d spent too long thinking about this plan to throw any part of it away in a moment of passion.

Somewhere, Tony already knew that there was

Frantically, Steve searched through the memories he had with Tony.

“The entire world agreed on a reasonable way forward, based on the concepts of justice and accountability and government that
Of course, Steve knew how to draw his own blood.
Automatically, a familiar voice reminded him,
Actually, at the moment, he was mostly worrying about the revelation that – on top of everything else – Tony was trying to survive on a basic ration of diseased blood-
“Tony, are you sure?”
And, with that thought, Steve once again pulled himself back from the brink. He pointedly lowered his head, and picked up his pace, thinking only of rounding the corner at the end of the corridor before Tony saw him-
The pulse of aftershocks running through him, the sense of calm and relief and happiness that was swelling up in their aftermath
Their eyes met with a static spark, both of them still softened with that same exhausted smile…
And then a more thoughtful expression came over his features, his gaze focusing on Steve’s face. And Steve was just about to worry that he’d said something wrong… when Tony smiled.
“I love you,” he whispered.
“...Am I ever going to be normal again?”

All at once, Steve was angry over everything that had happened to him, all over again. He found himself reliving that bitter sense of injustice that he should be so alone and lost and miserable-

“Here” She said, handing him a little wad of beige coloured patches. “They give these to the staff, we all have hundreds of them.”
“This is Wesley. Something attacked him,” Tony answered, very carefully. “No idea how bad it is, so I want to get him to the hospital as fast as we can, okay?”
understand Tony’s reaction.
He saw Nick go to answer him, a silent objection stuttering into nothing on his lips. And then he abandoned it in favour of cautiously picking up the rest of the pages, his eye jumping erratically from page to page as soon as they were in his hands.
Beneath him, the city streaked into an abstract work of art, a perfect balance of colour and form that would disappear completely when he moved closer to it. In moments like this, Tony could still appreciate the wonder and absurdity of what he was doing, however many times he’d done it before.
And Tony smiled softly, his hand caressing over Steve shoulder, his eyes snapping up to meet Steve’s again before he answered.
“No luck, I take it?” He asked with a sad smile. Tony winced.
Steve had no idea how long he floated there, flooded through with this pleasure, completely balanced and content and…
“And where is their lab, do you know?”
He gave his head a shake, as though that could dislodge the daydreams that were already gathering. He made a point of looking up at the window, and the rainy Sunday afternoon that was flickering miserably on the other side of it, and reminded himself that he wasn’t missing out on anything right now…
Tony forced himself to focus very hard on standing up, and looking at the room – which was,
That was all the thought he gave that one.
’, and that would’ve been worse.
And, somehow, it really did make the whole of existence seem that much better.
And Steve had simply walked out into this beautiful scene, and smiled and the playful strangeness of it, and then wandered over where Sam and Nat were trading casual small talk at the edge of the pool -
“Sounds good” Tony squeaked – with literally no fucking clue what he was agreeing to.
. And how could he tell Tony what he was feeling when he didn’t even know? How could he explain, when every part of himself was screaming something different, and he didn’t know which were real and which were things he’d just
“...I wasn’t very polite to Tony, when I first met him,” he sighed.

Something that might provide more answers...
Steve screamed, as a searing pleasure crashed up along his back, shattering through his hips, crawling up through to his shoulders and down into his calves. And he would’ve carried on screaming, except that Tony immediately slammed into him again, and again, setting a deep, brutal rhythm that knocked the air out of his lungs.
The Avengers Initiative, the family they’d built, the role he had to play in this reality…
“I had quite a nice time, actually,” Steve answered… realising the truth in it as he spoke. It hadn’t been the
many mornings after. Mornings after he’d said too much. Mornings after he’d gotten too emotional. Mornings after he’d been too enthusiastic, or too obsessed on one topic, or too over the top with his language… The creeping shame the next day was always the same. The uneasiness of not understanding his own actions, not remembering exactly how he got there. Even if he hadn’t done anything destructive or said anything embarrassing or shared anything that people didn’t already know… he’d still feel that nakedness of having said something he just wouldn’t have said. The lack of control, the lack of ownership of his own mind, or body, or something.
What had he
sitting somewhere now, repulsed or frightened or uncomfortable with the idea of Tony, was worse than the thought of his secret being announced on the six o’clock news. Tony didn’t care who else found out – which was a worrying thought, in and of itself.
Steve felt an inch of relief, up through his ribs. He was

“And there’s been an increase in consumption since the festival started,” Tony went on, his tone silently adding,
“But you… you think you will see him again, is what I mean?” Steve cut in, leaning forward slightly.
Steve felt his stomach knot in anticipation.
“…And if it’s an AI this basic, it’s probably using basic over-rides…” Tony continued to muse, getting down on his knees to look at the back of the computer panel, “…So, if I force reset it…” He held his watch to the back of the panel, and waited, and then stood up to look at the screen – tapping the edge of it impatiently, while something loaded… And then he smiled. He held his thumb down on the screen, and said in a loud, clear voice.
“I swore I’d never wear a sweatshirt… for some reason…” and Tony could

And he looked at Steve, lying on his back, still drifting in and out of awareness… that pretty, happy smile on his lips…
This was
no, don’t – can you just-”
Without having to think about it, Tony knew that submissive impulse had still been there. Perhaps it hadn’t been quite as strong, or maybe last night had just been too hurried and desperate for him to really fall into it… but it was definitely there.
It was entirely unlike any of the emotions that had crashed through him in the last few minutes – and it certainly wasn’t a

“A Varian?” Steve queried absentmindedly, his mind obviously on other things.
He couldn’t risk misjudging things so spectacularly, right at the last moment.
And the vampire part of Tony. The part of him that he wasn’t afraid of or confused by anymore – because it was the part of him that knew Steve was in trouble. The part of him that was strong enough and powerful enough to get Steve back-
“Thank you for agreeing to see us,” his voice was unsettlingly familiar, coming from a total stranger.
object, now that he thought of it…
For a few seconds, the sheer relief of it was enough to white out all the thoughts in Steve’s head.
Steve walked away from him, when Tony had just curled up on the floor and cried, genuinely fearful that the pain in his heart would kill him. A moment he’d trained himself to
Steve let his eyes fall on Bucky’s arm, staring somewhere far beyond it, getting lost in the middle distance. He let Tony fade into his peripheral vision, and then he let his vision fade away from his attention altogether. He fell into the silence he was forcing into his own head, concentrating too hard on

“Or Thor,” Tony realised out loud, “or Wanda, or Vision.”
“Yeah, I am - as well as being a nervous wreck, and wracked with guilt - so very happy,” Tony sighed. “And I just spent the most amazing night of my life with the most wonderful man who I am hopelessly in love with, and I think that he might actually kind of like me…”

And then came the very first thought to shake itself awake,
But at last he was ready to do something about this.
But Steve just growled against his lips, digging his fingertips hard into his skin as he dragged Tony back towards the door. Tony barely had time to register the sudden movement before Steve had turned and thrown him hard against the wall beside the doorframe, his weight pinned by Steve’s chest, his feet a full foot off of the ground.
Instead of which, he walked over to the cabinet and retrieved his favourite mug, and then started making a fresh pot of coffee - resolving to let his thoughts to drift wherever they wanted.

The immediate blanket of icy cold was unnerving, to say the least. Somewhere, even through his current hyper focus, Steve still knew that he hated something about this. Having to lie in a freezer, even for a few moments, was probably the most unpleasant part of this whole plan…
An elated, disorientating lightness rolled through Steve’s head, as he recognised the deeper truths in what Tony was saying to him-
“It’s… complicated,” he sighed. “And it’s… personal.”

“I’ve done this before,” Steve commented, in a dazed, distant voice. Tony blinked at him.
“What the hell just happened?” She demanded, clearly more concerned than angry.
A pleading cry broke from somewhere in Tony’s throat as every muscle tensed in hot, tingling shock.
But Tony was quite serious when he added,

was he supposed to do with his face, right now?
Steve honestly felt as though he’d just stepped out of his body. Like some part of him knew, when he processed this, he wasn’t going to be able to deal with it. He suddenly felt lightheaded. He wasn’t completely confident of the floor beneath his feet.
he’d never told Steve he felt that way. He wished he could bury all of it, act as if he’d never thought it, erase that scene from a narrative he now wanted to shape another way.
that nagging little voice in there somewhere.
“No,” Tony smiled.
It cut through Steve like a blade. Razor sharp and lightning fast, right to the core of him.
But right now, it was better to keep Tony out of the drama.
And now this.
But he found himself drifting back into his head, back into his memories – until it was literally those moments he was looking at, until he’d forgotten about the room he was in-
oh, he got it now!
So, there was no way to separate the nicer parts of last night from the scary parts - and, even if there was, it should really be the scary parts that Steve dealt with first-
Tony retreating from him.
Because right then, there was the blood.
It was like he’d been halfway through drowning and suddenly worked out that he could float. The physical relief and feeling of revelation, the realisation that everything made sense the second he stopped thrashing against it.
The thought doesn’t alarm him. He realises now that there’s always someone else here… he knows it’s okay.

drinks that had been offered to him… And little bites of food… And he was pretty sure he remembered eating a flower, at one point…
“I do, actually.” Tony sighed, and made himself look at Steve again “I have literally no doubt that you’d take a bullet for me. I mean that.”
Tony’s body was just so entirely perfect, moulded against Steve like this – like he’d been made specifically to fit against Steve’s chest.
Devastated that Tony might still walk away from this.

“Oh, no, no, no – no more therapists.” Steve shook his head, his face pinched in distaste.

“Do you hear yourself?” Wanda gasped, shaking her head dismissively.
Sexually explicit scenes in this update.
When they stepped outside everything seemed so much brighter than it had a few minutes earlier. By now the sky was such a flawless, vivid blue that it was painful to look at, the sun beating down on them from directly above their heads…
But there was a potential apocalypse in the works, wasn’t there?
Jesus, Tony didn’t know what to do with himself.
And in the end, Steve could only manage one coherent thought on the whole thing-
just a little bit hurt, in spite of all of that.
Just a reminder that there will be points in this fic where both Steve and Tony think, feel and say things they might not ordinarily think or feel - and times when things they *did* already think might be somewhat corrupted, or exaggerated...

. As explanations went, this was actually getting more and more embarrassing the more he considered it.
And there was another reaction Steve recognised…
. He bucked his hips, a desperate scream trapped in his lungs as Steve began to move against him, taking him deep and slow, like he was savouring every inch. Tony tugged at Steve’s hair again, and this time Steve responded by sucking sharply at the tip of his cock, digging his nails into the tender flesh at the curve of his waist.
And, apparently, it wasn’t time for
he assessed the capabilities and intentions of anyone who went over to speak to him… Not so much.
“Ideally, yes” Tony nodded. “And then once we’re out of there, we can have a look at what we’re dealing with. We could… I don’t know, delete all their research. Probably shut down their drug ventilators, or whatever it is they’re using… it must all be connected to some central system. And, if nothing else, we’ll have more information to make a plan with.”
Tony was laughing.

And Tony hadn’t even known he knew that, until right now.
his mind come into sharper focus, as that response managed to grab his attention. There was a little loosening in his chest, a feeling of freedom, as his attention shifted to the answer Barnes had just given-
Tony sucked another long, slow mouthful, pulling that pleasure up from even deeper, tugging it from the small of Steve’s back. That feeling moved hotter and thicker now, like it was caressing Steve from under his skin, curling low in his groin, pulsing deep in his muscles.
It meant that this thing could really work…
So, he might as well just turn around now…
“I can, but a basic search of those keywords has returned over seventeen million results. You may wish to refine your search, or define a way to prioritise the results,” JARVIS suggested - although Tony had already worked out that he’d need to be more specific…

Uncomfortable, but in a nice way.
And then, as soon as he pressed two fingertips to Tony’s rim, Tony growled low in his chest, grabbing hold of Steve’s arm in an iron grip as he forced himself down onto Steve’s fingers,
Steve swallowed hard, and gave Tony’s arm a gentle squeeze, before burying a kiss somewhere in his hair… Tony couldn’t help feeling a little bit smug that his hunch seemed to be working out.
They exchanged a little bit more conversation, before Pepper made her excuses. And, purely because he was feeling happy and social, Tony decided to ride the elevator with her, and walk her to the door.
Maybe he wouldn’t, when it started to get complicated and awkward. When he finally thought of some question he couldn’t answer. When he started thinking about all the worst-case scenarios – or when he walked right into one of them. When he jumped to a wrong conclusion or said the wrong thing and fucked the whole thing up…
“No,” Tony corrected, “it
Which was morbidly fitting really, wasn’t it?
“What project?”
In fact, as he was trying to remember the details of Tony’s inglorious introduction to SHIELD, Steve realised that he’d never even asked about it. That all he had to go on were the few acerbic comments that Tony had made, right at the beginning of the Avengers initiative, most of which Steve had rolled his eyes at…
“Don’t be stupid,” Bucky assured him, genuinely. “Told you, I’m always here if you need me,”
The way he relaxed into the grip
easy to look at Steve… and it wasn’t only that he was beautiful. Steve was just so
At last, all the impulses that Tony had been denying, and running from, and worrying over, were all speaking together. Without having to think about it, Tony knew the story he was a part of, the role he played - it didn’t matter if it wasn’t a role he’d ever heard of before, or if it didn’t fit into any of his existing labels, or if there were no words for it. He knew it. It was natural-
They’d barely made it into the room before Zan snapped the door shut behind them, both falling into combat stance immediately – an instinct triggered whenever they were closed into any room. But they both relaxed when they realised, they really were just in an empty office. A sad, functional little space, with a standard office desk and a computer, and a tall filing cabinet gathering dust in the corner.

“Well, if we keep him waiting much longer, he won’t” Steve muttered weakly, finally stepping out onto the drive. And Bucky just sighed, and followed him.
“I don’t know – are you ‘the sort of person’ who puts their foot in it and uses outdated terms all the time, just because you keep doing it?”
The pressure built in Steve’s hips as he let his mind run away from him, the immediate, visceral relief of contact finally giving way to warmer, lower pleasure.
Then he’d just started tidying his workshop, barely aware he was doing it, sort of assuming that it would take hours to clear the debris… And when he’d done that, less than thirty minutes later, it finally occurred to him that Steve was more likely to end up in the kitchen-
He just needed to feel Tony inside him.
his motivations had been… well,
Calling Steve the symbol of consistency and order and doing what you're told, or whatever,” Bucky snickered, “because, yeah, that’s absolutely what I thought, when I was dragging Steve from Ohio out of the enlistment office. When he was running head first into every bar fight like the ginger kitten from the Aristocats - I swear, Colonel Phillips just rolled over in his grave,” he trailed off into a low, musical giggle, eventually dropping his face into his hands in an attempt to calm himself. “Sorry. I am sorry,” he managed, after a few shuddering breaths.
...Although, common sense suggested that Steve might’ve hallucinated that last part.

He felt strong.

It was

…We probably shouldn’t be doing this
Tony hated himself even more for smiling at
Just like anyone else on earth…
“Yeah, I said that,” Steve smiled, his attention drifting back to the gauntlet again. “I mean, I mentioned it once, when Nick was talking about the computer simulations SHIELD used to run. I asked if anyone bothered building any of this stuff…. He said ‘we’ve moved on’, or something.”

was probably the wrong word… but it was certainly true that, when he thought of Steve so willingly baring his neck, so completely giving himself to that experience, so happy to let Tony take whatever he needed, Tony wanted to be able to do the same. For Steve to know that he would submit to Steve’s needs as readily, trust Steve just as much, gladly share in every part of his life...
Thinking that they’d get out of the ball pit, before he asked for the full story.

the details came pouring in - scraps he’d learned from the Operation Rebirth file, observations he’d made for himself, things he’d thought of earlier that day… All things that helped make sense of this feeling after the fact.
Again, he thought about telling Tony that he loved him - that he already thought Tony was the best thing that had ever happened to him, that Tony deserved to like himself more than this…
And so many of those people had lionised Captain America…
– I guessed… I hoped.” She told him.
Well. Now he felt anxious and uncertain and basically unhappy. Good.
Tony might not have been at all desperate to get home, if it weren’t for the fact that Steve was -

Tony remembered that moment well enough to be entirely sure-
“Oh yeah, that,” Rhodey laughed, his gaze drifting into the middle distance as he thought back to it. “Um… We ended up eating some of the flowers… And then we got split up…” Rhodey mused, his brow furrowing deeper as he went on “... And then I got into this really intense conversation with some guy about birds… And then we had to leave, because Steve stole some guy’s tiny lute-”
And then he saw Coulson glance at Pepper,

to, or what any of it meant.
“There aren’t any,” Tony cut her off – because, of course, it would’ve come up when he was obsessing over Steve. And, anyway- “They’d need a big location, somewhere isolated, to do work like this – wherever this flyer was produced, its not in New York City. Probably not somewhere they’ve admitted to. They must have another base, somewhere we don’t know about, somewhere they have him right now…”

“...It’s never been like this. With anyone,” he stammered instead. “I’ve never - I’ve never felt like this, before…”
And when he looked up again Tony was just looking at him, warm and interested and…
Because now he knew what his instincts actually were. He

that urge this morning as a powerful, physical thing. He remembered it being unlike anything else he’d ever felt in his life…
A life like that was worth suffering for.
And, obviously, Tony knew it wasn’t okay. That he had an awful lot of making up to do for that – a lot of things to change about the way he thought and the way he behaved. But, still, he was greatly relieved by that as a start.
“But, yeah, I want to be your boyfriend. I want to wake up next to you every morning, and come home to you every day, and just be able to kiss you, and tell you I love you, and have fun with you like this. And if that’s what you want-”

Unfortunately, that moment of clear self-awareness triggered something much more chaotic, as Steve rushed to realize just how out of control everything was, and the reasons that had always frightened him, and all the new questions about whether it
And Tony didn’t care if any of this was normal.
“Mostly, they just wanted me to collect medical details and… samples, if I could. Which I couldn’t, for what they needed,” Stape admitted, talking to the floor again. “If Sergeant Barnes hadn’t been quite so opposed to pain relief, or if he’d not needed such a solid rationale before he agreed to a general anaesthetic-”
“Oh God Steve, I love you, you are… Jesus Christ, that was…” Tony panted, his head still bowed under the weight of his relief.
Well. That was all very interesting.

that we fixed it all last time. If that’s the case, then… I guess you should probably schedule a check up or something, in like a month, just to be sure…” he seemed to trail off into his head for a few seconds, and then he snapped himself out of it. “Right, shall we get you stabbed with some needles then?”
Would Steve feel free to be himself in any sort of personal relationship, if he was also acting as a donor? Would he be completely free to lose his temper or storm off after an argument or have a bad day of his own, if there was this burning physical obligation between them at all times?
To have relived that awful moment and changed it… To have

After all the medical checks and the mission reports and the trying-to-be subtle enquiries from the team, when Steve had gone back to his room to shower and change. He’d been grinning as he closed his bedroom door. Possibly humming to himself as he pulled his bloodstained shirt over his head, happily lost in shapeless ideas of just how good everything was…
he processed the look on Tony’s face. The way Tony closed down, and curled into himself, and looked away from Steve.
“Oh, he’s here somewhere,” Rhodey assured, gesturing out towards the crowd. “He’s with Pepper and Nat.”
“You’re beautiful,” Steve whispered, letting his thumb roll over Tony’s rim, his other hand gripping Tony’ s hip hard enough to bruise. “So fucking beautiful. Breath-taking. Perfect.”

And then Steve’s car finally pulled into the parking lot.
“...So, there is

And, wow, that revelation about his need for control just kept on going, didn’t it?
And, God,
Steve was lying on his back, with Tony curled up on his chest, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder. Steve had one arm wrapped around Tony’s waist, and the other hand – for the moment – playing idly with his hair. They’d been lying like this for maybe half an hour, quietly, while Steve let his fingers trace over Tony’s arms, touched his face, kissed his forehead… And Tony sighed happily, and snuggled closer to him, and pressed soft, slow kisses to his neck…
…He wasn’t entirely sure what ‘it’ was, exactly.
Every inch of him throbbed with a pleasant ache, as a shimmering giddiness rolled lazily through his head.
, I must say – these do nothing at all for your ass…”
“Oh yes?” Steve teased, cocking an eyebrow.
There was a part of Steve that didn’t want to think about whether Tony liked him, or what he might like to happen, even hypothetically. A part of him that already knew he wanted more from Tony than just one night – a part of him that didn’t want to think about why he couldn’t have it.
And he made Tony meet his eye. There was a self-aware,
Even if he didn’t really know what he was going to do with it.

The immediate,
…Was he just hurt, because he was the only one on the team that no one seemed to care about?
But, altogether, that gentle touch was about the most intense thing Tony had ever felt – and that hopeful, questioning look in Steve’s eyes, the way his lips parted…
“Good boy,” Tony smiled, throwing the bottle aside before he brushed a fingertip over Steve’s jaw. Steve lifted his chin obligingly, letting his head fall back as Tony pressed an ice pack over the bruise on his throat. Even the shock of that felt muted, wrapped in the warm blanket of sleepy contentment…
“Well, that’s success number two…” Tony commented casually, resting his weight against Steve’s side.
…But Steve did remember saying that.
“Steve…” he whispered softly, meeting his gaze before he started to caress his way down Steve’s chest…
his usual bad luck, was the fact that this place only accepted reservations from couples.
Tony waited until he heard the locks slot into place behind her, and then he let his weight fall against the wall, and groaned.
Tony did as he was told without having to be told.
It feels strange.
A little giggle bubbled over Tony’s lips, more an expression of joy than amusement. The uncontainable, giddy happiness of being
It was how long he’d been scared of thinking that. It was the wordless feeling of responsibility he’d carried since 2016, knowing that he’d talked so many other people into sharing his point of view. Knowing that he could never change his mind, even hypothetically, without casting the same judgement on all of his friends - friends who wouldn’t have been in that mess in the first place, if it weren’t for him. That shadowy understanding was the reason his regrets were still so ominous and murky. It was the reason he couldn’t talk about that particular trauma to anyone.
himself look up… relieved to find that Tony had turned away from him, to gesture towards the couch on the left-hand side of the room. Steve followed Bucky to sit, awkwardly, at one end of it – leaving as much room as he could at the other.
“It does.”
It looked pretty clean to him.

He took the pillow away, and looked up at the door, expecting the room to spin when he did it – but no. It seemed at least one of The Facility’s promises could be taken at face value; he was entirely hangover free. Well, physically at least. His vision was fine, and his body didn’t ache, and his head was unnervingly clear, actually… He had no problem thinking
Steve’s entire body twitched, sharp and sensitive, watching Tony come for him, feeling it-
part of my plan, and my ideology. And I’m quite sure there is nothing you can say to me now. And, perhaps you think that’s arrogant. But, can you say
Frowning, Tony lifted his head and did his best to blink his vision clear. The night before came back to him, along with an unspoken understanding of all the things it explained - why Steve was here with him, why he was waking up so early... why there was still a satisfying ache throbbing gently inside him…
. That if I said, ‘I’m sorry I did all that, but I still love you’, you’d just think… So what? Why wouldn’t I still love you –
And not think about…
Steve exhaled slowly and rubbed a rough hand over his eyes. God, this was even harder than he thought it would be…
...He liked being
“I love you too,” Tony sighed, letting his head fall into Steve’s shoulder.

Tony snatched a tissue from the box on his bedside table, wiping his hands far too roughly – completely disgusted with himself.
Who was giving him
So, because it was the first idea that occurred to him that he couldn’t find a problem with, Steve decided to go to Tony’s house in Malibu - after Tony had become Iron Man but before he ever met Steve.
And there was a brief cooling of disappointment then, at the idea that maybe all his newfound confidence had been a lie.
“…I’ll find it later,” Tony assured him, giving the washing up a dismissive wave.
Because he’d only ever had half of the pieces.

There was a sudden, bright flash in Steve’s head as Tony hit his prostate again, his other hand dragging roughly over the head of Steve’s cock. A more urgent sensation shot through him, catching him off guard… an edge of hunger, echoing after it.
he own those two nice shirts, and a pair of outdoor shoes? What had he been thinking when he bought those? Was there some instinct that human beings are born with, the way starlings know to collect sticks for their nest – a biological impulse to acquire a cold weather coat, and hang it in a wardrobe?
And then Tony looked up at him.
And maybe it wasn’t that he was going mad - maybe he’d simply been affected by the life he’d led, aware of different anxieties because of it… that wasn’t the same as going mad…

He was already further ahead than he’d ever intended to go, just a few months earlier.
...Or roses, or something…
… And Tony was vaguely surprised that his fingers weren’t trembling when he locked the clasps shut…where all this thrumming excitement and physical elation could possibly be going, for his limbs to still be this steady-
like it…
He looked

He had objective proof.
“I should be concerned with the impulse itself,” Tony acknowledged. “But… Honestly, I
It was like Steve’s whole body was tugged sharply towards him. All of a sudden, Tony was so much more than a beautiful man. He was the physical embodiment of everything Steve loved so much about him; all that intelligence and bravery and kindness, made real. The urge to reach out to him was dizzying. To be able to grab hold of that dazzling,
Steve recognised that he was clearly here to say something significant – but he just couldn’t keep his worry from bursting out of him.

And, thankfully, his legs seemed to remember where the nearest soft room was – because his head was suddenly of no use to him, at all. His head had completely whited out, washed into a general glare of pure emotions. Just endorphins, and adrenaline… and a lot of drugs, by now.
And the end result was still that he was glad to have a break from it all - that he was
And then he let out another sharp cry of pain.
But now that he was committed to a difficult conversation, Tony was perversely keen to get on with it. He had already made it across the hallway and called the elevator before JARVIS had chance to get to the next sentence,

“No,” Steve cut him off, before he could deflect the compliment, “it’s amazing
There was a split second of confusion at that response – a reaction Tony took advantage of to push Steve onto his back. Steve lost a surprised breath, his hips arching upwards instinctively as Tony stood up. He glanced up in time to watch Tony step free of his shorts, and flash him another devious grin, before he knelt down at the foot of the sunbed
No, it would. Really. Steve couldn’t think of any reason why that wouldn’t be better.
“...So, these people paid you half a million dollars to upset me in front of Steve, and take a photograph of what happened?” Tony summarised. Wesley nodded. “...Who are these people?”
Immediately, he understood how uncomfortable it would make
He’d though that Tony begrudged the consequences Steve had left him to deal with.
Steve felt something inside him give way.
“...Okay, but isn’t that just hallucinating, though?” Steve pressed, squinting at the flower. Figaro sighed, and gestured with it,
“They’re pretty corny, and no one goes after they’ve been here, like, a week” The girlfriend sighed, not unkindly.
What he said next was really just to break the tension.
people. A swarm of brightly coloured specs, flowing through every crack in the landscape, like a single, shimmering stream…
And Tony pulled into him hard, letting that burst of pleasure reach its peak, waiting until Steve was on that knife edge, before he whispered,
Suddenly, Steve felt like a lovestruck teenager, watching his crush from the side lines – not sure whether he wanted Tony to notice him or not. Not sure whether he was delighted for this chance to be with Tony or desperate to get out of it. If this felt strange, or bad, or…not.

But, honestly, none of that meant anything to him right now.
to be capable of conscious thought to understand that. He was more aware than he’d even been of the strength coiling steadily in his body, and it was more than there had been when he’d come up against Thanos – if he hit Adam now, there would be nothing left of him.
“Speak soon,” Pepper smiled, walking out of the door.
Steve, in his own head.  And when Tony dismissed his – obviously ridiculous, entirely baseless – assumptions about Steve, he was just left with Steve as he found him.
He never wanted this to stop-
He could sigh happily at all the sweet things Steve had said to him, without having to over think everything he’d said in return.
At around noon it occurred to him, casually, that he felt
someone had…
“...And the first time around I didn’t tell you any of that,” Steve heard himself speak, not sure if Tony could even hear him, not sure if it was right to continue with the story - not sure what else to do. “Because I thought it would hurt you so much to hear it-”
sit there and make small talk.
“…That bad, huh?” Steve grinned, feeling like he was playing a game of Black Jack – actively asking himself how far he could reasonably push this, before he went bust.
By the time they got into the bathroom, Tony was itchingly uncomfortable in his sweaty, sticky clothing, and increasingly aware of how sore he was – and how tired. His muscles seemed to get denser as he undressed, and by the time he got to stepping into the shower, he was glad he had Steve to lean on….
all of that was.
“Oh, thank you,” he muttered, not quite able to meet her eye as he took it. That might’ve been one of the most surreal moments of his life…
Tony just let that fantasy drift through his mind, along with everything else… Just one voice in that ever-growing chorus…
Because, last night, Tony had finally seen that he
But he felt it.
Bruce had decided to go with Team Folk Dancing because, as he put it, he’d had his fill of the Bulsaran ecosystem for one lifetime. Pepper and Nat had gone with Team Flower Show because, in their words, Tony’s plan was stupid and there was no way they were breaking into a random tower.
“Yes,
Tony was so sure of it, so desperate for it, it was like a separate force pulling him closer to Steve. His eyes fell to Steve’s lips, and he caught that brief flash of tongue, that faint ghost of a smile - that tiny pinch of hesitation. Tony watched in slow motion as those beautiful lips shaped his name, barely a whisper,
And then he heard those words echo through his head,
And Steve knew that was meant to be a complement - or, rather, a manipulative sop to his ego. A cheap ploy to flatter him into doing their dirty work for him-
“And you actually
The surge of affection, the immediate desire to reach out for him, a pang of longing…
“So, right now, SHIELD - the one that Nick Fury and Coulson work for, the one running most of global security, are actually being controlled by Hydra?” Tony summarised, incredulously. “And those same people are, right now, keeping Bucky Barnes locked up in a freezer until they can next use him to murder someone?”
Centring, at least. He wasn’t sure of very much at the moment, but it still seemed fairly straight forward what needed to be done about the situation on Anni Vara. What Captain America would do about that.
Or he could look into some of the educational programmes that Morita founded in his retirement, see what they developed into, if they had produced any famous alumni or groundbreaking new discoveries…
His thoughts melting and stretching, changing…
He already knew there was no point in asking if his fears were reasonable. He didn’t have enough information to make that assessment, or enough time to make it in-
“Not really,” Steve muttered, shyly – which only made Tony grin wider. “So, um, did you want me to ask Pepper to bring it over? Or, I mean, I’m happy to… I can bring it over any time.”

“No, Steve, I… It’s… a personal thing. It’s an…

“Ah, well that’s probably my fault, in that case,” Tony replied, breezily. “They probably mentioned, but I took them trekking across the desert this afternoon, so then no one really had any choice but to drink the water. A lot of water.”
he remembered, in Bucky’s voice, before he’d even finished standing up. He tried to ignore it. He tried to tell himself,
… it was all just him trying to think of what he would do, if he didn’t feel like this. Having to go through every possible angle, reframe and rebrand everything, push things into the background, all because he couldn’t trust himself to just open that door and
He hadn’t wanted to wear it, the first time around. He felt ridiculous and old fashioned and self-conscious in it… And burdened by it. Defined by it from the very beginning, required to live up to it with everyone he met.
He’d stirred just as Steve left the room – feeling like he’d been woken by the emptiness of the bed, as opposed to any noise Steve had made.
, right now.
Steve pulled harder at Tony’s hair, forcing his head back, sucking those deep, greedy kisses over his jaw and throat. Tony clung to him, helplessly writhing against Steve’s body, responding directly to that primal need for more. Steve’s hands found their way under Tony’s robe, stroking possessively over his back before he grabbed him by the hips, grinding into him. And then Steve moaned against his throat, a mournful, pleading sound that shot right to Tony’s groin.
Instinctively Steve reached out to him, putting his hands on Tony’s arms and pulling him closer. When Tony looked up at him again his eyes were wet with tears, and just so beautiful-

Well, that was all very uncomfortable.
And after that…
“My poor Steve.”
It occurred to Tony that he hadn’t taken a good look at Bulsara since they arrived - or, if he had, his observations had since been lost in a drunken haze…
as big as Steve remembered them, and that he’d been smiling when they walked in-
“I’m sorry,” Tony sighed, making sure to look directly at Pepper when he softened his features. “It’s a really long and complicated story that I swear I can explain -

And then Tony gathered the fabric at the centre of Steve’s chest into a fist, and ripped the front of his shirt away in one clean, swift motion-
“We need you to look this over, as soon as possible,” Coulson dictated, already aiming a data case in Tony’s direction.
He knew he could never protect Tony by controlling him - he would never want to.

… And the water was nice. Cool, and soft over his tongue, and slightly sweet, as though it had maybe had fruit floating in it at one point…
He didn’t wait for an answer before he tossed the first two guards up along the hallway. He let go of an animalistic roar, a sound he wouldn’t have known how to make before right now. The other two guards got the message and took off down the corridor at speed. The guy in the suit scrambled to do the same-
The wave of excitement that crashed over Steve in that moment was almost unbearable.
anything else.
He watched Tony think about that for a moment, while a nervous energy started to collect at the pit of his gut…
And, God, it was even worse than just saying that he still wanted it now. Okay, obviously Steve still wanted to kiss him now – he’d wanted to kiss him for the last seven years, why would he suddenly not want to kiss him now? And, okay, maybe that would’ve meant he couldn’t completely distance himself from what he’d done, maybe it would’ve stopped him from claiming it had
“Well, we’re not going to work any of that out from here.” Tony managed, talking somewhere over Steve’s shoulder. Actually, this hastily derived plan was entirely about getting the hell out of this room – but there was still some logic to it. He could drag some logic out of it. “And I personally think I’ll find it easier to look around without the personal sex narrator – you know, when I can freak out at my leisure, instead of pretending I booked this for our anniversary.”
At last, Tony’s dazed expression melted into a frown.

And Tony turned around, and flashed what probably did look like a very drunken grin – because Steve had just called him
And Tony frowned, immediately picturing it… slowly beginning to realise what Steve meant...
About Bucky, and Steve’s childhood, and the first timeline, and time travel…
Eventually, Steve’s body fell apart beneath him, every ounce of tension leaving him in one euphoric rush. Tony let Steve’s cock slide free of his mouth, sitting up as Steve collapsed back against the sun lounger. For a moment, everything was just one heady swirl of senses. Every inch of him was flooded through with that sensation, his limbs lost in an onslaught of feeling, his vision blotted with stars…
“No, I know. But I mean - there’s obviously more to this,” Tony prompted. “You

“You’re not comfortable with it,” Steve sighed. Tony felt a plunging guilt when he heard the disappointment in Steve’s voice, an inherent resistance to
And Tony leant into him, reaching behind him to unlatch the cuffs on Steve’s wrists. Steve fell forward before he could stop himself, unaware of how he’d been pulling against the chains – and Tony just pulled him in, and held him against his chest… and Steve threw his arms around him, and buried his head in Tony’s shoulder, and
He didn’t even know whether it was really good, or really bad – but he was sure it was really something. He could feel that ominous emptiness inside him; just waiting to see what flood of emotions would rush to fill it when he remembered-
It soaked up through him, softening his muscles, washing all the noise out of his head.
that is, how much strength it takes…”
It took considerable effort for Steve to force his eyes open. At first, there was just a blinding light and a piercing headache. Instinctively he went to throw his arm over his face, and remembered again that he couldn’t move… recognised the specific resistance of being

Steve’s body thrummed with it, the conflicting urges sparking against one another, barely contained inside him. There was an edge of controlled panic, a hypothetical disbelief that this could really go on… And a complete and total confidence that it would all be okay. Like being a kid in the audience of an illusionist’s show, free to enjoy this incredible sense of danger because he
“And, for what it’s worth…” He went on, eventually “You’re not the only one who let emotion and drugs and a few… previous misconceptions… twist what might otherwise have been a good point. When I had you chained to a bed,

Tony had never woken up on his knees before.
Of course, Tony had no reason to believe anything this guy said...
“Make sure we collect all the evidence, cut the chemical warfare, call the Avengers in to help shut this place down properly.” Steve ran his checklist out loud. He felt sure the plan was longer than that, originally… but that seemed like the gist. So.
So, of course, Steve did as he was told…
“I… think the guy I’m in love with might actually have a crush on me. And I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing or just a thing.”
Wait.
…Which was

They’ve made it so that we can’t stop them on our own. So. I’m here to ask if you’ll help us.” She finished, on a nervous rush of air.
But there was a part of Steve that only Bucky would ever know – and, if anything ever happened to him, it would leave a void in Steve that even Tony could never fill.

And then Steve pulled back to suck hard against the head of Tony’s cock, eliciting the sharp shock of pleasure that finally broke him. Tony let out a truly whorish moan as he came, hard, in Steve’s mouth, arching up off of the mattress as that surge of relief cut right through the centre of him, pulsing deep in the core of him for and endless, limitless moment…
But Tony just kept to that same measured pace. He caressed his hands over Steve’s shoulders, digging his fingertips into the store of tension under his muscles. Steve yelped, and bucked against him, gritting his teeth against the frustration of not

of his mental energy onto that.  As a result, he’d had the most creative and prolific week of his life. The workshop was still strewn with models he’d mocked up, his server was full of notes and experiment results and theory – some of which might represent significant breakthroughs for medical science as a whole.
Steve had been trained to do the same thing in the same situation – he recognised the additional edge of caution in their expressions, the way they glanced up at the ceiling.

I’d be saying it anyway, because it’s not an excuse, and it’s probably only my own short sightedness and denial that stopped it being obvious in the first place-”
It was okay to say that he would love Steve, and trust Steve and share his life with Steve if Steve loved him back, and trusted him in return, and was willing to share as much with him – but not otherwise.
… even while he knew that, clearly, Steve wasn’t here…
Tony wasn’t sure if that’d been the same voice or not. It wasn’t nearly as reassuring, this time… in fact, along with the acrid taste still coating his tongue and the gory stain he’d left in the sink, it was enough to literally turn his stomach.
He left a little pause, just long enough for them to share a confused look, before he took a little step into their personal space to add,

“And if I ever say that to him, it’s just going to make everything even
“Oh, God, Steve…” he mewled, throwing his head back against the pillows as the pleasure of it rolled out through his shoulders. “Oh God Steve, I love you.”
And he let his hand slide over to take Steve’s, a happy little dip in his stomach as he felt Steve squeeze it.
Tony had to squeeze his eyes shut, first against the flood of morning light, and then against the flurry of activity that was apparently still going on in The Facility grounds…
Having already accepted that it was okay to use his spare Pym Particles for personal trips, it was easy enough to decide it was time to take another one.

rant.
In terms of the Sub/Dom themes explored - Tony chains Steve down before any of this happens, and it's sort of discussed that Tony likes the idea of being in control of the situation, and Steve likes the freedom from responsibility, and the not having to worry that he's doing it wrong, etc.  There is no element of Steve wanting to be hurt or punished, or Tony wanting to do that to him. There is no 'lack of consent' role play, no suggestion that Tony's control in this situation is supposed to be absolute. Tony does ask permission before he chains Steve up. They don't discuss a safe word, but as there is no role play element, I hope it reads as pretty clear that Steve would just ask him to stop.

“Down – Down there-” Jesse tried frantically to get his limbs to work, jerking his whole body in the general direction of the basement.
“You don’t?”
Tony felt his spine straighten up from under him. His whole body froze. But it wasn’t a panicked reaction, or a shocked reaction – even though there was still quite a bit of both, going on the background of this situation. Tony’s instinct to stay still right then was more like the reaction he would’ve had if a baby deer had wandered into his workshop. An instinct not to startle Steve, not to shatter the moment… an immediate understanding that this didn’t usually happen, that this was special and important and not to be disturbed. He was suddenly so aware of himself, like he could feel every inch of his skin… that heavy warmth of Steve there at his side… And there was an elated, irrational terror in him, something that didn’t feel like alcohol and didn’t
Eventually, Andrew sat up miserably, and took one look at the plate of congealed food under his face, and asked Vanessa if they could just go to bed. She nodded, heavily – she’d started to flag by then, too.

Tony laughed, letting his head rest against Steve’s shoulder, his eyes falling out over the sea. The first signs of dawn were beginning to bleed up through the clouds on the horizon. In an hour, the sky would be candy pink and the beach would be swarming with joggers and dog walkers, but for now, it was only the two of them.

From being as confused and fuzzy headed as he’d ever been in his life, Steve now felt as though he could literally see everything in more detail. He could hear more sharply. And, when he looked at the little device in his hand, the name immediately occurred to him – as did the entire plan it was attached to.

He brought his wrist to Tony’s mouth carefully, mindful not to press to too hard against his lips.
And it didn’t occur to him to question it – he just ran with it. Falling from one fantasy line to the next. Rushing onto the next bit because he
“We’ve been trying to get hold of you,” Coulson scolded him, like he was both angry and disappointed, all but barging into Tony as he stepped out into the lobby.
“No, Tony,” Steve shook his head, taking another step. “I

to do this. Now.
And then Tony’s fingertips were on his lips, kind but commanding.
“Yeah…” he nodded, pinching his lips against an unexpected threat of the giggles. “Fury already got in touch, by the way.” Tony’s eyes lit up with a nervous hope, that was, for whatever reason, completely adorable...
“Since yesterday?” Tony challenged, sarcastically. She her eyes flitted up very briefly, at that.
“Okay.”
That was the sort of thing he would’ve felt

. And when he eventually had to break for air, Steve cupped the side of his face, and just asked, “Is this what it’s going to be like? After this? When we get home?”
But of course Tony heard it. He

Without admitting he’d wanted to bite Steve.

If Gary was found before he woke up, someone would probably just assume that he’d become unwell and fainted on his way to get that glass of water - and, as Steve had gone out of his way to steal a very specialised tranquilizer, with no long-term effects, they would likely put it down to his general ill health.
As a matter of fact-

than he had that night-
Rhodey had stayed until he woke up again, just like Tony knew he would. And Rhodey had poured more coffee, and made another careful attempt to get Tony to talk about it… and accepted it, kindly, when Tony realised he really didn’t want to, yet. By then, Tony had started to feel the pressure of all those issues to be dealt with, along with a nagging anxiety that he should have been dealing with it earlier. He had a lot of things to think through for himself, properly, before he could share them with anyone else.
so, of course, Steve began to sit himself up… or tried to-
“Are you okay?” Tony asked, softly.
Steve shifted his weight so that he was kneeling between Tony’s legs, so that he could lean over him and kiss him again, and again, his hands stroking along Tony’s sides as he trailed kisses from the centre of his chest up to his neck, and then up along his throat, and then behind his ear. Tony grabbed the back of his head, and whimpered so softly that Steve almost didn’t hear it, arching his whole body up against him.
“They said they’d only been here six months” Steve interrupted.
“And you’re not artistic?” Steve asked, suddenly drawn into the conversation.
. Just picturing Steve’s pretty face, soft and sleepy and happy, as he chatted away about everything and nothing. Feeling the weight of Steve pressed warm against his ribs, Steve’s hair sliding over Tony’s fingers, the heat of his breath against Tony’s skin. Letting Steve’s words drift through his memories the way he’d let them just float through the air, at the time-
Or any of the others.

“Were you on stage?” He asked, and Steve blushed.
And then the screen flashed, and Tony’s smile widened – and when Steve looked over his shoulder, he could see the message on the monitor:
“Oh yeah, none of us have brought

Or demanded Bucky explain the difference between a general anaesthetic and being cryogenically frozen, like that nurse in Oslo – as though Bucky’s traumas weren’t valid if they couldn’t be defended objectively. At least, this time, no one had done anything to make things worse before they could even start being shit in the first place.
And then into this chaos, Tony said, very calmly,
This whole exercise would’ve felt far less arduous if he hadn’t had to deal with actual, physical papers.
That same warm feeling that had flooded through him all those months ago, when he’d watched Tony sit down, cross legged, on the floor of his workshop. There was an almost childlike joy that was simply part of Tony, something that had stayed there under the surface in spite of everything he’d been through. Something that wasn’t always on display… But, apparently, Steve liked it very much when it was.
He could swear he looked different.
It was like he could

… then fine. He would deal with that, and
Tony almost flinched away from it, purely out of surprise. Surprise that Steve was still here, surprise that he’d managed to stop thinking about him – surprise that the reaction was just as sudden and just as intense, even though he’d been quite happily ignoring the same man a few seconds earlier-
Christmas…
And then, behind him, Steve heard the click of a door being opened.
As Steve was talking, it finally occurred to him how long it had been since he thought back to mundane childhood memories… Because usually it felt more significant or painful than this. He usually felt too much pressure to explain the background, or to pre-empt anyone else being sad on his behalf… and yet here he was, just remembering it.
He never imagined he’d trust Steve to keep that secret under pain of torture, if Tony asked him to.
He really hoped that strange, very specific jealousy hadn’t bled through there…
meant a lot of what he’d said in that fantasy room. Some of it he should have said to other people. He’d used bad examples for some of it, and he’d let genuine points get exaggerated into something else – he’d allowed ‘you should apologise for some of those choices’ to become ‘you reckless, stupid bastard’… He’d let a legitimate criticism of Steve’s judgement get boiled down to one – arguably unfair – point about Scott Lang’s criminal record… He’d said ‘I am angry’ when he’d
And then he’d got as far as clearing away the body armour he’d been working on. At first, there was a little lift in his chest, as he remembered Steve taking an interest in it before. Another little flicker of excitement, as he thought about telling Steve how far it had come. Thinking that Steve would be interested to see it. Wondering if it would be finished… before…

The strangest shiver ran up Tony’s back, and he had no idea if he liked it.
But then Tony had gotten himself distracted by his stupid fucking crush on Steve, and now Rhodey was probably lost in that endless crowd, every bit as panicked as Tony had been-
But nothing seemed anything, now.
to say it-
He’d spent an hour sitting beside the bath, gently washing the blood from Steve’s skin, soothing his bruises with warm water and soft kisses. Watching the contented smile on Steve’s face as Tony caressed the washcloth over his skin, and washed the sticky heat from his hair. Whispering all those promises and endearments – trading the pressure of keeping them secret for the joy of watching Steve listen.
He wondered…

Steve saw Tony smile sympathetically at the back of her head, a genuine softness in his eyes.

And then he looked up at Tony... in time to see his features fall in such innocent, open sadness that it hurt Steve’s heart to look at it…

, washed through with this warm pleasure and heady sense of joy.
“And I’m angry you just stood in that Bunker and
“You can sleep here, you know,” Bucky commented lightly. Which was probably an odd thing for him to say, because Steve was always falling asleep in Bucky’s room – especially on nights like this.
“Why didn’t you ask me about this before?”
“Just – go and do your job, Tony,” Steve huffed, throwing the ball aside petulantly as he strode past Tony, and out the door.
“...I am always going to love you,” Steve promised him. “Not the memory of another Tony I knew -

For that one, brief fraction of a second, they were both on a different path entirely. Steve
… All with that slightly sinister filter over everything. That ominous music playing faintly in the background of Tony’s memories. Those blink-and-you’ll miss it scene-shifts that only he could see…
Because right now he knew that Steve needed him in this room. Steve needed him to take control of a situation that Tony had needed Steve to make safe.
And this time Tony could only moan, surrendering to the brutal rhythm Steve had set, his head falling forward. Steve looked up at him, watching that need flash up in his eyes over and over, his lips flushed dark red…

“That’s it, leave me here,” Tony moaned helplessly, barely comprehensible. “Lie about how I died. Don’t tell the press I drowned in balls-”
“Well, maybe that’s true. Like I say, I don’t know anything about your life. And it’s not my business – we don’t have to talk about anything like that, unless you want to…” And again, a little pause, just to make sure… But Tony shook his head. “But you don’t have to share everything with a person to let them do one thing to help you.

“So, it’s a problem somewhere else entirely?” Steve asked from somewhere behind him. Tony made himself think very hard about the issue at hand when he answered.
And then Tony turned away again, and let his face fall into his hands. He let go of a long, slow breath - a sound that Steve recognised as Tony gathering his temper.

Steve could feel it fluttering under his ribs as he struggled through those last few strides, tingling sharper in his jaw as he stretched out to try and grab the side of the pool -
“I’m sorry, for – whatever the hell I just said. I don’t even know, what I – I don’t know why I said that about Rhodey” He promised, desperately, struggling to sit himself upright so that he could look at Tony properly while he spoke “I

someone found him, he would no doubt assume that he’d just fainted, and probably decide not to mention it to anyone. He may even get away with it.
” Steve spat with such venom it hurt his throat, stalking another step closer, all but pinning Adam beneath him. “You’ve just stood there and
And Tony made the most beautiful little whimpering sound; wanton and vulnerable and easily the hottest thing Steve had ever heard in his life. His cock throbbed, that sharp, frustrated need clenching painfully in his hips with every movement Tony made - but it still felt as though that wasn’t the point somehow. Like everything else was just background noise to this thing Steve really wanted…
Bucky still had only the vaguest grasp of what Steve and Tony did all day - although, from the aggressive phone calls they made in the evenings, and the sorts of appointments they made, Bucky got the impression that it was something very important. To be honest, he’d only recently gathered enough capacity to be curious about it, and even then, only in a distant sort of way…
“How long… How often do you have to…”
Enjoy!
“Yeah, I’m up. One minute” Steve called back. He stood up, and ran his fingers through his hair, and smoothed down yesterdays T-shirt. He took a deep breath.
This was the first time in years he’d thought of Nat, back in the Tower. Those years they spent throwing friendly barbs at one another and silently checking the other was okay… the years he’d spent thinking of her almost as a sister. As an
problem – that he’d been struggling with for over half a decade.
...Except, now that he was about to put his hand to the entry panel, Steve didn’t know if he could call this churning reluctance ‘a desire to be with him’
Bucky and Sam nodded and gathered themselves to leave, while at the other end of the table another waiter coaxed the same reaction out of Rhodey and Tony and Pepper.
“Well, I’ll have to run the tests before I know the specifics, but it’s going to take a few more appointments,” Tony explained. “I’ll go through the details when Bucky is in the mood to listen, but, basically, it’s going to involve a lot of smaller procedures. There’s just no way to do this thing except a step at a time – his body is going to have to learn each upgrade separately…” Tony had to stop himself from getting carried away with the technical details.

paused to ask what the fuck he was playing at, and resolved to be far more sensible, and had even started to think about what Tony’s objections were-
“So, Nat roped you into the Public Library thing after all, huh?”
And, in that moment, he hated Adam
“I still think one of us should go w-”
These details were entirely without context, and probably useless in and of themselves - but, little by little, without him really knowing it, the simple act of counting them began to calm him down. The heat left his face. Some of the tension left his chest.
was the closeness Steve truly coveted, the longing that had been there no matter what else they shared.
He’d already moved heaven and earth for this one moment.
Steve could see Tony twisting himself tighter as he talked, as though he was trying to physically force the words out - and a horrible thought occurred to him.

Did it matter what sort of outfit he would’ve chosen for a date, if he’d been a different person entirely?
“Well, I don’t exactly
“You’re stalling,” Rhodey called out. Tony sighed, and finally poured two coffees.
Unfortunately, Tony could already feel his phone vibrating in his pocket, so he knew he wouldn’t have time to process exactly why that was so fucking annoying-

There was something fundamentally…
“And I really don’t know what it is, and my brother says it doesn’t matter because he’s sure it’s something meant for Earth – and honestly, if it is, then I don’t care either, because I hate all of you and I don’t care
Steve fixed Nick with an impatient expression and gave a performative sigh. He’d always hated the dramatic, round-about way Nick explained everything - as though he were setting up a funny anecdote, rather than making use of people's valuable time.

And, once again, it was the things Tony
you take the blood no one else wants. And it just seems like you taking that from other people is… like it doesn’t make any sense. Maybe I don’t know what I’m talking about, but, I mean, the stuff you drink, does it actually keep you healthy?”
And Steve just looked at him with those wide, helpless eyes –

But Steve fixed him with a strangely…

Tony - looking overtired, and wearing a mass-produced promotional T-Shirt from a bar in LA… and possibly covered in glitter.
So, Tony knew what he’d done, even before he got as far as actually thinking back to it.
to apologise. I hadn’t realised that… I do that for me, as much as for the other person, every time I do it. Because that’s how you draw a line under something. That’s how you work out if you can make it better, and how to do it. That’s how you move on from mistakes you’ve made and grow and keep building… and I just thought… How…
It was different to any impulse Steve had ever felt; more immediate and physical and primal

“And… you can’t force someone to be creative.” He sighed, unhappily. “The people they have in the basement, just grinding up beads… maybe you can force people to do work like that, under a sedative. But you can’t drug people into submission and then expect them to push themselves to new discoveries… that… should’ve seemed suspicious earlier, I think…”

The sky outside exploded into elaborate displays of blue and gold and red, as the city beneath them erupted in celebration. The room was flooded with flickering light and dramatic shadows, surrounded by a wall of distant sound.

His heart clenched in the same treacherous way it had at the time. He could recall so clearly the exact sense of shame that had overwhelmed him, reading Romanoff’s damning judgements…
