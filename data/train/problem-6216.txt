Jane leaned her head against his shoulder, "You all will work it out given time.  And if they can just communicate, that kiss implied that it could be sooner than later.  Though from what I'm seeing that's a big if."
For a moment Tony considered the package before finally opening the framed sketch as Clint rose to start breakfast, taking Thor's gift—which as far as he could tell was cheese grater from Asgard—to the kitchen with him.
"But now I'm all curious," Tony said with another smirk. "About what the sexual preference of the gods might be."
Also known as The Avengers Fail at Christmas Part 3
“I’m still missing exactly what your goal is here,” Tony said, gesturing for another drink.
"I honestly don't know."  Steve looked briefly like he wanted to retreat before asking, "Why did you kiss me back?"
"Oh but now you have me curious," came the response, accompanied by an upward curl of Steve's lips.
She nibbled at the peanuts, holding the bag between them so he could sample them as well as the mood took him, "I don't know if we've ever really been lovers. I mean, we've tried it. And I think there were times where we could have come close, but I don't think we got there. We're friends. Recently with wonderful benefits, but I don't know if lovers is the right term, you're right."
Bruce's grip tightened ever so slightly at that, drawing a deep breath at the near growl from that same corner that rose with a surge of protectiveness at Clint's tone, "He's not going to touch you again. Not if we can help it."
," she replied without hesitation.
Natasha watched him for a minute, "There was a time I thought you and I had the same ideas, sleeping with our superiors.  We're not as alike as that, though are we?"
"What happened while I was gone?" Thor asked, looking over at her, tone firm and with only a hinted rumble in it.
"Christmas," Jane offered brightly.
"We have had our whole lives to fit around each other," Thor said, not adding the snide comments between Fandral about Hogun's smile or Volstagg asking Fandral if he liked his face or Sif's cold wrath that was as like to earn a verbal attack as a physical one when she was pushed. "The Avengers are still figuring out where the jagged and hurt edges are."
For a moment Tony stared at him. “You actually kissed me.”
That caught his entire attention. "I thought you could not steal those apples."
A-A-A-A
"You can try again," Clint offered. "I'm probably too drunk to remember it later."
"I wouldn't recommend it being anything that you like. If it irritates me I'll incorporate it into the students' training regimen."
"Steve said Howard was a nice guy last night," Clint said from where he was making scrambled eggs. Rhodey blinked, anger clearly in his shoulders as Tony looked over at Clint and Bruce.
Natasha snorted, sipping at her own coffee, "At least you have a robe. Clint has little shame."
Her jaw twitched slightly, "Of course that's what happened."
Bruce nodded slightly, "Both fair assessments.  I know Clint likes films, but I know hardly enough about them to scratch the surface and not enough to buy him any."  He paused at a window display and smiled, "You know, I think I might have found Clint's gift."
Steve blinked in confusion, “What?  I—”
"Are they flirting?" Tony asked with a frown.
"And I'm not," Tony deadpanned back. "Maybe not everyone's as insecure as you are."
"How bad was the fight?" she asked quietly, gaze fixed on Steve and Tony.
"That you've got a habit of doing dangerous things and wondering if you have a plan halfway through them," Steve answered.
"Barton's the one who figured that out?" Fury said and shook his head. "I thought it would have been Rogers."
"My brother," Thor said. "He has revealed himself to you," and Thor was not surprised by that fact, even if he wanted to be. "How is he?"
"Must be what?"  Bruce asked quietly, looking at Clint.
“You don’t sound pleased,” Loki said, and Thor felt his fingers tighten as he held his hands together.
"It always was, and always will be."  She combed her fingers through his hair, "It could be good for you. To try."
"Well, we're a cheery bunch this morning," Bruce murmured into his tea.
Nodding, Bruce drew back slightly, "I have a couple of things running in the labs that I should probably check on."
"His life," Thor said. "He would only escape again."
“It’s a matter of perspective,” Tony sniffed. “Besides, this is Christmas, not a full-on party.”
"What sort of footage?" Rhodey asked, leaning his elbows on his knees and Tony's posture only got stiffer.
“You should have
"I think we've done enough of that," Thor said, his face serious and hands clenching before carefully releasing. Jane reached up to comb her fingers through Thor's hair.
Steve groaned at that, leaning further down, his fingers digging into Tony's hips.
“I saw pictures,” Tony said. “You know, when I was older than three. Of you before.” He draped his arms over Steve’s shoulder, urging him down. “You were still gorgeous and determined then. Which is not to say this isn’t extremely hot,” he added, urging Steve to cover him. “But it’s not the only reason you’re gorgeous.”
She offered him a last kiss on the cheek and handed him a slip of paper with her number and email on it as a reminder, "Let's try to keep in touch at least."
"I should have blown him up," Clint corrected. "He withstood it pretty well." His hands were shaking and he scowled down at them.
Clint looked both ways and back to Bruce before standing abruptly, almost but not quite tripping over the kitten. "I can't," he said and wasn't sure if looking at Bruce or anywhere else would be the better plan.
She considered and finally nodded, "I think we can see about it, yes.  We all have our assignments then."
"The plane flew into you," Rhodey agreed finally. "In my military zone, without you telling me what the hell you were doing, after you took out a terrorist cell that was holding an entire town captive," he continued. "All of which you did without telling me a damn thing."
"Right," Clint said, pointing the fork vaguely in his direction. "That was a fun debrief to read. I don't think Tasha ever wanted to go under cover again after that one, but Fury talked her around it to eventually."
“None of these idiots have seen Star Wars!” he complained, the most he’d said to her in several weeks. Once Clint had met Natasha, he soon enough sat her down and made her partake in a Star Wars night with him and Phil, though in revenge she’d forced him to watch several Soviet silent films.
"I'd toss it out the window except that might hit someone on the way down," he said and Thor frowned, looking at Steve in some confusion.
It was just about two and a half hours after Natasha had left that footsteps were heard on the stairs and Jane entered, looking around. The entire main room was draped in lights and decorations, the tree having been so covered in ornaments and garlands that it was almost impossible to tell how scraggly it had been originally, "Oh my."
"Oh. Well that was smart," Tony said, finally looking back at him. "Did Fred manage to catch that action?"
His smile was kinder at that. "Of course," he said, looking back at the sidewalk in front of them. "And usually I am glad of whatever advice you would offer."
"It's a kitten," Tony said. "Aren't they legally required to be adorable? Besides, Rogers picked it up and he has the big eyes as much as the kitten does."
"That's because it's the bourbon and I learned important lessons from you—don't give me that look—about hiding my good alcohol. I don't have a ball room floor to wax."
Bruce’s brows arched again, “How many films have you actually seen in recent years, Tony?  I mean, you go to the premiers don’t you?”
"Sorry," Tony said, not really meaning it much at all.
"If they behave they can stay," Bruce said. "I make no promises beyond that."
“Alright, fine, solid deal,” Tony said and gestured Steve back in. “But first you gotta seal it with a kiss.”
He thought they could find a new balance.
"I was going to make use of the butter in the fridge and the syrup in the cupboard," Bruce replied.
"I wouldn't want to put you out," Clint said, still scratching the kitten's tail.
“Well, we bought them,” Tony said. “Do you know how many are kitschy? Let alone cute representations of fathers and sons and jolly old men in red. I mean really. They are terribly dull and unoriginal.”
Gaping after Thor for a moment, Loki performed the second most foolish action he had taken that day and strode after him, "What by Odin's eye do you mean by that?"
"Not that I ever say no to benefits," he said, grinning at her. "I just don't want you feeling tied down to someplace that's not... all it could be. I mean, not that you can leave me. Because I'd seriously last only a week without you and you're the most important person in my life and probably my favorite too, sorry Happy," he added and the driver snorted.
for your fantastic generous heart, Tony.”
"I," she hesitated at that and offered a slight tilt of her head that could be taken either way, "Sort of.  I've been thinking, and I'm not quite sure how to put it into words."
"Hm," Victor hummed. "And what do I owe this to?"
Tony took it automatically now, happily munching on it. "Considering that a meeting between you didn't end with a fight and still messed him up that much? I don't know. Redemption sadly doesn't seem your style."
Thor blinked exhausted eyes, nodding slightly, his hair stringy and falling into his eyes. “Films?”
"Damn it, that wasn't how I meant..."  He shook his head, drawing a breath, "I was wrong.  Top to bottom, start to finish, I've been wrong since I met you. I'm trying to understand, Tony, but I haven't, I haven't been trying enough. I guess I just realized that."
“Yes sir,” Jarvis said. “In the bedroom.”
"Trying to avoid the Allfather's attention takes effort,” Loki muttered. “And I would be a fool to attempt anything right under the noses of those who so roundly defeated me last time, wouldn’t you think?” Loki asked, walking around to put the hotel room bed between them.
“Yeah, well, let me know if there’s anything I can do.”
Tony laughed again. "I can, maybe, explain that one?"
"Well he didn't stay that way," Rhodey said and shook his head. "At least, not in private. This is where Stane comes in. The man was a creep in ways I could never explain but he was there when Tony was a kid when Howard wasn't—or when Howard was being an ass. When Howard and Maria died, Stane took control of the company until Tony was done with trying to destroy his liver and old enough to take over. Look, I never got their relationship, but they were close as hell in a familial, vaguely wrong way." He cringed, never having liked the way Obadiah Stane had leaned over Tony, or the way Tony would tease him about pajamas or laugh when Stane got too close.
"Of course," Charles drawled.  "And it had nothing to do with it being
“I’m sorry,” Loki said after a beat. “Are you actually upset on my behalf or is this simply that you want to make sure I have no safe harbor there?”
“Because you said you did not want me caged,” Loki said. “Did you change your… sentiment… on that?”
"I'm not retreating," Tony said. "I'm only giving the idea of retreating serious thought."
"You know," Tony said, watching him. "You don't actually have that much power over me."
"Tony," Steve murmured, pushing himself up a bit further. "Thor, can you give us a chance to get dressed?" He had pulled the sheet up with him, but Tony hadn’t even seemed to notice.
Pepper blinked twice, "I did not bring enough breakfast for everyone."
That was a long time ago.
Natasha ignored the question, finding four different sorts of socks, wool for Steve, black light-weight dress for Tony, comfortable socks with a tension ribbing around the arch to lend support for Bruce, and dark red socks with a small star pattern for Thor.  She approached the jewelry counter, leaning against it and watching Tony.
Victor hummed, looking around the room one more time to make sure he had not missed any technology or trinkets. At least the ones he didn’t mean to leave behind as a final “fuck you” to the Fantastic Four. "If you say so. You're still quite lucky you have such a charming reward to pay or I'd have no reason to offer my help. The invasion of New York was stunningly done, if cut off prematurely. It’s too bad your work since then has only been lackluster."
Bruce stepped away from the tree and opened a couple of boxes of ornaments while Steve carefully wove the garlands among the branches, giving the illusion that the tree was fuller and bushier than it actually was.
"We'll stay—"
Charles rolled his eyes, "I think that level of consumer manipulation would be a step beyond what Steve would like."  He strolled over to the bar, leaning his cane against the side of it and offering Clint a nod before stepping behind it and considering the selection Tony had, "You're hiding the bourbon again."
Steve sighed, shaking his head as he poured them each a cup of coffee, setting Tony's within the other man's reach, "Then we'll cross that bridge as we come to it."
Clint shook his head slightly. "Fury, always Nick Fury. He..." Clint shook in anger. "These cards are covered in blood, but I know Phil would never have left them in his pocket where they—they could get damaged. So for some reason Fury thought it worthwhile to dip them in..."
“Sure,” Loki agreed, sounding doubtful but like he was going along with it anyway.
Tony felt his jaw drop. "But," he started and took a breath. "Okay."
"Odin is tired and angry," Thor snapped back. "Do not even think about it, you have stabbed me quite enough for a while."
Clint looked over at him, eyes narrowing slightly as he still was unsure how the soldier was reacting to the news of his past lover but Tony sat up quickly enough he hit his head on his coffee table. "Steve!" he said, waving a bottle. "We're getting drunk. Join us."
There was a shocked moment of silence. "But, you—" Tony started and clicked his mouth shut. "Okay. And the times I really piss you off?"
Bruce smiled, amused, his hand cupping the back of Clint's head, "So do you."
"We probably should have called," Jane finally admitted.  "Are you all doing alright?"
That garnered a smile, "Do you recall which book it was?"
Several evenings later, after a super villain had gone through Manhattan in a craze of world domination lust, Clint stared down a bowl of cereal. His shoulders ached and he had a lovely new set of bruises and a sparkling new vendetta against all super villains.
Natasha glanced at Steve and Tony as she assured Thor that it wasn't any trouble, "So we've got extras if any get broken.  And we have enough that we don't have to worry about it next year.  Call it a win, Cap."
Loki stood, hands twitching like he couldn’t even begin to start with how true that was. “Don’t I?”
Bruce was still considering how to respond to that when the elevator opened again and Steve stepped out. He paused when he saw the small gathering, looking like he hadn't expected it.
"Oh I expect that lid to come off in a series of spectacular explosions.  But they shut it down for Christmas at least."
"You shouldn't get your temper up," Clint said, tone still distracted.
"Ah," Thor nodded. "I will find us a log."
“I let you go once,” Thor said.
"Huh," Clint blinked. "Somehow I was not expecting that. I mean, sure, if you're making stuff."
"I thought he hated Thor."
"You were
“Right,” Steve said, walking closer and leaning down slightly to wrap an arm around Tony’s waist. “Just a nice, calm morning.”
Paying the man on the tree lot and letting him know they'd be back for the tree on their way back to the tower, Steve shook his head, "None at all.  You have any ideas?"
"You've always been on the run."
Tony paused for a moment, glancing at Samuel before giving him another treat. “Alright, not really.”
"If the new fondue set will let us," she agreed, watching him.
Clint grinned, Tony giving him another wary look. “Well, we need more communal events,” Clint declared. “The question is only which type of ship to introduce Bruce too—X-Wings and Blockade Runners, or Battlestar Class, or even Constellation Class.”
"What, did you try and call him mew-mew?" Darcy asked.
Thor managed not to roll his eyes. “And you think we are not talking about the same sort of love.”
"I don't need those, but,” and Steve gave Tony a crooked grin, hooking one finger in Tony's shirt, between two of the buttons. “I do need you undressed to manage that.”
Steve entered the room, glancing toward Tony and pausing when he saw Charles, "Oh, I didn't realize there was a guest."
Tony waved a lazy hand. "Okay, so I went after them with missiles and a suit of armor. But hey. Don't follow my example."
"It does seem rather," he paused, looking around. "Modern, by your standards."
"So I don't know if comparing him to a whale shark would help or not but it sounds about the same," Clint said.
"Dude, he had literally ripped your heart out and left you for dead already that night," Rhodey said. "By the time I got there after you went after him, he had pummeled you across the freeway."
Her lips quirked upward very slightly before her expression returned to neutral, "I've never been any good at that, no.  Do you want meaningless comfort, though, Clint?"
"I wish you would come home," Thor said, voice fathomless as he drew back.
"Modern art," Tony said. "I donated a lot of it when I, uh, was having difficulties but I got quite a few new pieces since then. They sortta just sit in storage."
The room fell silent at that question, Natasha suddenly finding the blade of her knife extremely interesting.  Steve's blue eyes flickered to Fury, and then to Clint, waiting to see what the director would say.
The transaction went quickly and Bruce slipped the box holding the spyglass into the bag from the bookstore, "We probably also ought to stop somewhere and get wrapping paper since I'm pretty sure no one else mentioned it."
"The one to make the suicide play," Steve muttered under his breath, shaking his head very slightly.  "You said the arc reactor nearly killed him."
"I brought coffee and d—" Rhodey started and stopped dead. "God in heaven, what is going on?"
"Yeah, the instant you start expecting things from me you might want to stop," Tony said, setting the coffee aside with having barely drunk any of it before surging up to drag Steve closer and kiss him. Steve fumbled to set his own coffee cup down before letting his hands move to rest on Tony's hips as he pulled the other man closer and leaned down into the kiss.
"Did you even know him?" Clint asked, focusing on the plate.
"Oh good," Tony said but his voice was distracted as Steve’s breath brushed the skin of his neck, and then his jaw.
“Charles said someone sent them,” Tony said. “Just putting them back.” He hadn’t looked away or closed the cupboard yet.
“More or less,” Tony agreed. “We fixed it now though, stop giving me that look.”
"Well, are you eating your pancakes plain?" Clint asked.
"It's good to know we all rate so high," Tony said, looking around and realizing suddenly he had no idea what he was doing. "Damn," he sighed. "I've never been good at gifts."
Steve glanced at Tony from time to time, but kept most of his focus on the tree and trying to sort out his thoughts and guilt for having inflicted damage again without meaning to.
“Absolutely not saying I am,” Tony said. “I’m just not sure it’s going to help in the long run.”
"Did you have another suggestion?"  Natasha spoke, a challenge leaking into her tone intentionally as she handed the kitten to Steve.  The blond smiled brightly, stroking the kitten under the chin and gaining a purr for his effort.
“You certainly seem to hold an inordinate amount of love for me considering the human.”
Natasha pursed her lips before rising from her chair, "I'll go write my report. You'll have it by tomorrow."
"I'll be gone before you can pull it and you know it," Loki said, fixing Clint with a hard stare.
“I can make more time,” Thor said.
The shower was running and the steam had clouded up much of room. But Tony could still see Steve startle and his eyes snap open as he reached quickly for the shower control and his towel, missing one and barely grabbing the other.
"Have you talked to Nick yet?" Clint asked, tilting his head back on the couch.
"Yeah, but seriously, don't go after Logan, he's cut your face into pieces. Actually," he paused. "Damn that would be funny. Please go try and seduce Logan. Take video."
Clint looked over the edge of the couch, frowning slightly. "You have a lot of grey areas," Tony said. "In fact, some less grey."
“Weren’t you quoting them at me the other day?”  Bruce asked, turning to look at Tony.  “At least I thought that was what you were spouting.”
Pepper kissed his cheek lightly, "I am well aware. And you know I expect to vet anyone you actually plan to
"I saw you on the news during the alien attack but I couldn't get away sooner," she answered, using the side of her fork to cut a bite of cake.
"I find myself quite liking lattes of vanilla," Thor informed Darcy seriously and she looked up, eyes wide behind her glasses.
"Good," Tony said, stepping forward and trying not to consider how domestic this entire thing felt, hanging sparkly snowflakes on a tree covered in garlands because it was so pathetic, and that wasn’t even mentioning the lights.
"As I would rather you did not," Thor snapped. "But you tried to destroy an entire world and conquer another one so what should be done with you?"
“Well now it’s cemented in my head so that’s what we have to work with,” Tony said, picking his way across the room, keeping the lights down low as the storm raged outside the tower. “Goddamnit Thor,” he muttered, finally pushing the bedroom door open. “Babe?”
"It might not be as much as that.  Hulk's pretty damn protective of Stark too.  Breathe, Clint."
Clint waved from where he was sitting, feet dangling over the rooftop as he watched the traffic far below.
Steve frowned at him. “That doesn’t even—”
"Some of the things that were said, what happened to you, and ," he ran a hand over the back of his neck.  "Actually that mostly."
“I would never invite the X-Men,” he said. “Are you kidding? Their holiday parties are the stuff of urban legends and the best answer to that is just no.”
"Well, that his first name was Phil and not agent and he was sorta seeing a cellist," Tony replied, staring at the helmet in confusion.
"I hope the others are having equal luck," Brue said, paying for the clock and leaving the store.  He put the box into his bag and stepped to the edge of the curb, flagging down a cab.
"I, uh, talked to Tony about that," Clint said. "Though I'm glad I never explicitly said 'hey I want something to shoot Loki,' all things considered."
"It," he paused, trying to figure out how to answer that, "better than it could have been, I think?"
"Not much to do about whether I should or shouldn't.  It's up now," Bruce said, his voice tense as he watched Clint.
"Not yet, I think he promised to make a new one," Clint shrugged. "I can't tell if doing that to Steve's Christmas present means they're getting along or not."
"I guess I have time to convince you," Tony said, a little weakly. "I hang out with super villains after all."
"It's probably good that Tony's pretty well alienated the political population that would take offense to that already," Bruce said, focusing on his cooking rather than look at Clint again.
Rhodey blinked at the Private shifting from foot to foot in front of him. "What do you mean, Captain America is here? Also, you're not my secretary."
"Steve doesn't know when to stop talking," Bruce murmured, watching where Steve put the last touches on what he was working on before stepping back and keeping space between himself and Tony.
"And yet you still haven't had Jarvis lock me out," Charles responded, still letting his gaze rove over Steve who shifted back slightly.
Bruce nodded once, getting down a mug rather than look at the other.
"Yeah," Clint said, saying nothing about his early morning foray that both made him feel better and worse. He leaned over to knock his knee against Bruce's.
Leaning back, Victor von Doom considered the hotel room he had all but packed up, miffed that his plans had once again failed. It was time to return to his castle and lick his wounds. He dropped the vase he was considering stealing for the hell of it when a flash of green light appeared, leaving one annoyed chaos god in its wake.
"Alright," he said, frowning already at the next display.
Tony set a fondue set on the table. "Please for the love of god tell me you didn't make another one," Clint groaned. "What does that one do? Acrobats before breakfast?"
"Chocolate," Natasha answered.
"Thank you," he said, hiding his face in his hands. "I just want him back. With the fucking picket fence."
Charles watched him go before shaking his head, "Is there anyone in this business who doesn't have a list of issues a mile and a half long?"
"We'll try," Clint said, laughing. "If we find presents is the next question."
"I have no reason to mope around him, nor have I ever," Loki replied, sipping at his drink.
“I like these benefits,” Tony said, catching his face in a kiss again, throwing one hand out. “Bed—that way.”
Bruce shrugged, "Not sure. To recover from being in that mansion perhaps?"
"Best of luck."
Tony just shook his head. "So what do you even do all day? I've seen you magically change clothes so you must not be shopping much."
"Alright, that's a valid point," Bruce agreed, pouring the batter into a frying pan.  "Of course, if Tony's
"Oh you're no help at all," he muttered, running the water over the dishes and pouring in a few drops of dish soap.
"Yeah, you were still on the floor," Rhodey said.
"Anyone have any name ideas?"  Steve asked, looking around, pausing for a moment longer on Tony.
"Make me feel better and keep him from doing it again," Clint said idly.
"Yeah, sure, the city that never sleeps is dull now," Tony said and blinked. "That's one hell of a gift, though. Let me guess, you didn't properly thank him for it."
Natasha watched Tony leave and turned her full attention back to Clint, murmuring quietly in Russian. She stayed like that until the smell of the popcorn burning cut through and she took a step back to yank the bag out of the mircorwave. Turning back to her partner she considered him, running a hand over his hair again absently.
“The beauty of it is you can start with the movies if you need to,” Clint replied. “But if we’re roping Steve into this? I might start with Star Wars.”
"Yes, the cat was here for that," Bruce answered, still not turning around as he rinsed the dishes.
Tony blinked at him for a long moment before he nearly folded in half he was laughing so hard. When he finally caught his breath back, he straightened the kinks out of his back. "So, I should probably start reading some of those books if there're more stories like that."
"Not even to Thor?" Tony asked.
Thor considered. "If there is time I will come out," he said. "Or you could come to New York again."
Fury huffed out a laugh. "I would never have expected you to. I may be a manipulative bastard but this isn't about that."
Tony's fingertips tighten, digging into Steve's back, his eyes widening a little before he laughs, gently. "You
as a clue. What the hell kind of spell had Sharon hit him with?
screaming, and Steve's brain was yelling too, his ears whistling, but he grit his teeth and kept pushing because agony was better than death.
"Hi," Steve echoed, fully entering the kitchen now that he'd been greeted. He was wearing casual clothing, like he'd just come from the training room. "Good evening, Mr. Hogan." Steve's mouth quirked at one side. "Santa."
Steve would like to say he knew exactly what had happened, but life as an Avengers wasn’t neat and tidy like that. Sometimes it asked you to complete a jigsaw puzzle without the picture to use as a guide and with several key pieces missing. He was used to recreating clues and timelines on the fly, and that was what he was having to do now, very quickly, because the world as it was didn’t make any sense.
“Wanting to kiss me?” Tony’s eyes shuttered like he was trying to blink. Steve tried not to track the drop of sweat rolling down his nose.
It was when Tony was himself, and he was talking to Steve, that he regretted the secret identity thing the most. People knowing his identity was for their safety, but if anyone could protect themselves, wouldn't it be Steve Rogers?
"Your reputation..." Steve added, his voice trailing off at the end, unaware that Tony's glass insides were shattering to fine, sharp sand; Tony was a silence broken by a cry; Tony was a heart that couldn't remember how to beat.
"You blush so prettily," Iron Man murmurs. His smirk widens and his gaze flickers briefly down Steve's body and back up again. "I wonder how far down that blush goes."
Ugh, Steve was right; Sarah was
"How about you, boss? Done all your shopping yet?"
"They’ll have to take the armor from you at the hospital." Steve kept his voice as level as he could. It was a Herculean effort, and he wasn’t that successful. "They’ll see who you are, and I’ll need to inform your loved ones where you are."
He killed the engine, pocketed his keys, exited his car, and stared at the house speculatively. Someone was home; there was light peeking through the curtain cracks in one of the ground floor rooms.
"I can help," Steve said.
Sam sidles up closer to Iron Man, glancing at him contemplatively. "Does that mean under the armor, you're that jacked?"
"Nothing to apologize for."
Tony stared at him as surely as he could. This was probably it, the moment he would have to lay himself as bare as he possibly could. Steve was right—wanting things was difficult. The idea of being disappointed was heart-rending. The idea of a life without Steve was worse. It was funny, Tony thought, how three small words could be so difficult to say and feel so epic, all at the same time.
somehow, which was another sensation Tony didn't like a lot. There wasn't much about this whole scenario that Tony was enjoying at all.
brewing between him and Tony in the bud now, before it killed them both. If it hurt Tony this much
appalling."
Tony wakes him on Day 1095, urges him to take care of his usual problem, then pounces as soon as Steve exits the small bathroom; pushing him onto the bed, sucking him until he's hard, and then riding him so fast and deep that Steve sees stars. He smiles at Steve, instructs him to stay in bed, and half an hour later brings him breakfast—he's turned their daily six eggs into a hash with some of the vegetables that line the bottom of the fridge every morning. He's poured Steve a large glass of the apple juice and makes him drink it, even though it's Tony's favorite.
"I suppose," Steve whispered.
Tony leaned back a little, trying not to think of a thousand terrible things at once. Important questions were usually heavy ones. Maybe Steve was already starting to rethink this relationship, before it had even really started. Could Tony blame him? Tony's past held several dark and miserable things. He was far from perfect.
Steve’s brain whispered, and he hated everything.
But today, Steve could barely manage a whisper of flame. They were supposed to be revising
Steve's eyebrows furrowed. "So how—"
But, he was also an insanely good kisser, so there was

you are." Tony emerged from the tree, face reddened from scraping past a myriad of pine needles in search of his quarry, and he held up the device in a victorious pose. "Tada!"
"It's not," Steve says. "I was just going to ask if you were okay."
Tony hurried up the path, knocked loudly on the front door, and found he was weirdly holding his breath. Steve disappearing without word had really rattled him.
which is a kind of permanence that feels important in an environment so impermanent.
She was a real cutie too, as far as babies went. Steve, exhausted as he seemed, was a natural with her too. Tony had to admit he was having very wobbly feelings about Steve, seeing his strong arms cradling such a small baby.
you there, Iron Man?" Jan asks. "I tried my best to find you, but I don't think I did."
"I can look after her while you take a nap," Tony offered, feeling awkward. It was reasonable for Steve to be overwhelmed; he was obviously dealing with a lot, surprise babies and all.
Tony's brain was fracturing, spinning
The limo seemed a glamorous enough escape for Santa Claus to plausibly make, and Tony left the hospital with a rushed promise to have the suit dry-cleaned and sent back to the hospital as soon as possible. When Happy could barely conceal his smirk when he looked at Tony in the rearview mirror, Tony refrained himself from firing Happy by consoling himself with just how happy the kids were to see him.
"I stand corrected," Iron Man says, and pulls Steve back into another devastating kiss. Steve's knees actually go weak, which he's almost pissed off about, because he'd assumed that was some sort of lie concocted by Hollywood, but then he's too consumed by Iron Man to even be angry for long. Iron Man kisses like he fights, control and ruination, and Steve moans, because he can't help it, he's never been so quickly turned on by a simple kiss, although what's simple about this?
Steve lifted his gaze and Tony couldn't help the unhappy noise that silently left his invisible mouth, because Steve looked the very opposite of
"Uh," Steve says, his cheeks warming, "it was more of a reflective comment."
He'd debated standing in the doorway like a creeper and watching Steve spar with a hologram opponent – there was something pleasant about the way Steve's muscles shifted under his skin when he dodged and wove – but he was a big fan of dramatic entrances.

Despite the 0.5% of doubt, Tony was braced to see Steve standing there in the doorway, blinking in confusion that Tony was there. And he was. Steve looked exhausted. He was frowning slightly. There were bags under his eyes. Tony was expecting that; if Steve was dying, he
“I don’t think I can.” Tony’s eyes looked glassy, unfocused. The gasping came even quicker now. “Steve, I don’t think I can.”
The man laughed. "You've got a wand, boy, and you literally appeared out of thin air. I wasn't born yesterday."
″I think all of us are scared all the time. I think that's what makes us human. The brave part is when you feel it and you suit up anyway.″
"Been working on anything in particular?" Steve asks, aiming for polite.
It was a complicated story, compounded by the accompanying sensation that Tony couldn't shake: that he was actually losing his mind.
"Great," Iron Man says and then puts one hand at Steve's waist, the other on his shoulder. "Then dance with me. There's an idiot at three o'clock, the guy in the white suit.
" Steve said, looking confused at the line of dubious expressions that turned his way.

"I'm taking a day off," Tony says.
Tony had come all this way without a New Home gift. Maybe some baby-proofing bits and pieces would be more appreciated than a bunch of flowers.
"We've been here three years," Tony says, softly, deciphering Steve's puzzlement correctly. Oh. Steve missed that.
"The mysterious metaphysics of Santa Claus aside," Tony said, smoothing down the beard, "maybe he has a straw hidden in his suit somewhere? I'm a big fan of hiding tiny helpful tools and gizmos in suits. You should see
"Fine," Tony sulks. "Don't tell me."
"Jarvis, I suppose," Iron Man said, after a moment. "He’s sort of family, in a way."
Steve thought about it as he wheezed through another breath. He remembered how impressed Iron Man had sounded. "They’re all self-contained."

Sometimes Steve's idea of morning jars painfully with Tony Stark's idea of nighttime. On these occasions, it's not unheard of that they both cross paths at an hour of the morning that most people would probably term
Steve didn't even clamber off Tony's lap, though; he just casually turned to Hank with a blank expression. "Emergency?" Steve clarified.

Tony's smile brightens even further.
Tony was glad he had the safety latches to focus on. It meant he was doing something active with his hands, and when he was doing that, he wasn't thinking, and if he wasn't thinking about this whole thing, he wouldn't be screaming.
Tony's mouth was open, like he had a witty retort ready on hand, but he faltered, clearly sideswiped by Steve's demand. Maybe it was the evenness of it, or the intensity of Steve's eyes on his. Tony swallowed, his smirk falling, his eyes darkening. Steve kept staring, hoping Tony would decipher it as a serious request. A question deserving of an answer, despite the command of the delivery.
This part was the only interesting part of this chase—the five seconds when it felt possible that the villain was hiding on the next floor. Steve could feel the excitement of it, the exact moment when the chase would really begin in earnest. Perhaps he would see a shadow out of place, or the edge of a weapon. They’d already chased their quarry down five blocks and through three large office complexes. They were slippery, and inordinately fond of hiding. Steve had found their hiding spot twice so far, when Iron Man’s scanners had failed him (resulting in a few more technical mutters in response, of course.) Once it had been an errant shoelace; another time, the tip of their nose had been visible around a door.
"You're a terrible wizard," Tony informed him.

Steve shook his head slowly. "It's just—weird, I guess? Wanting things at Christmas—it's a foreign concept to me. My mom would always find something to surprise me with, but—wanting usually meant being disappointed." He looked Tony directly in the eye then, and he looked almost sad. Tony's damaged heart trembled in sympathy. As much as Steve didn't smile so much around Tony Stark, he

"Might add the beard to the faceplate."
Tony felt faint; he wasn't surprised when he looked down and realized he could see almost
Whenever this kiss ended, Tony would be opening his eyes to a different state of reality.
Steve shook his head and rubbed his hands over his face. "
Steve made a very loud huff, one Tony knew from
"Out with it," Tony said, lifting up the bunch up to the door frame and securing it with a piece of duct tape, a.k.a. the substance that kept the universe together.
(There is alcohol in the bathroom. Steve always makes sure he goes in there first so he can tip the mouthwash down the sink. If Tony knows about it, he never says anything.)
Steve slips into his bathroom—pulls out a pink bar of hand-soap, and then automatically tips the contents of his mouthwash bottle down the sink. He watches the liquid slip away, almost hypnotized by the spiral motion.
Steve wonders if he'll recognize any of the other Avengers in the sea of people Tony Stark has invariably invited. Beast and Vision, probably; it's not like a mask can hide much of their distinctive physical appearances. Sam might be easy to find, not just because Stark's invitation list probably includes a sea of old white men (although, that too), but because he'll probably be tense and uncomfortable and so worried about dancing that he'll likely be sulking in a corner, arms folded, and most likely haunting the buffet table. Jan's costume will be incredibly beautiful and hand-crafted. Carol will be difficult, Steve thinks; she's graceful and beautiful and a statuesque blonde, but Steve's seen enough photos of Tony Stark's parties to know he's very good at finding lots of pretty women that fit that description to invite to these things.
" Tony admits, and immediately hides his face in his hands. "It's ridiculous, but there it is." His voice is muffled. "I got the best dance I've ever had in my life, and some really damn hot kissing and he was
"Oh." Steve flushed. His head was pounding; wherever he was, it was
Steve wants to wallow out in the dark with his thoughts for the rest of the night, but that's stupid. Tony wouldn't want any of his guests to wait all night out in the cold. Steve takes a deep breath and returns to the party.
Steve had been brave, and Tony had to keep taking his cues from that; he opened his eyes and nearly cried out, because Steve's chair was empty, of course it was.
One moment Steve and he were headed to the appropriate coordinates, both of them still sulking, and the next, Dark Elves were everywhere, and Tony's HUD was filled with their outlines and power signatures. His arms stretched out to blast them; Steve's shield was whistling past his face. Steve was shouting into his comms because they were overwhelmed, and Tony assumed he was yelling for help, but instead Tony heard Steve yell for Broo to transport them home.
Baby-proofing, though; there was a thought. Tony hadn't seen much of Steve's new house, but he'd caught a glimpse of an open socket, and a sharp table edge. He'd put good money on the fact that Steve was so overwhelmed by learning how to parent Sarah that he hadn't had time to learn you were

from his head.
"You could have asked me to help," Steve said. There was a thread of something through his voice that Tony couldn't identify and Steve's expression was carefully blank.
“It’s too dangerous.” Tony attempted a smile, but it came across as a grimace. “I’m gonna need a doctor.”
Tony's cheeks darkened and he carefully looked away. ″I worked very hard to fool you. To fool everyone.″ Those last three words were added hurriedly. Steve liked that idea, that Tony was desperate for Steve to know he wasn't targeting him in particular. ″It's been… increasingly difficult, over the months. My intentions, particularly at the start, were good—as good as can be expected, I suppose.″
of him.
Baby-proofing Steve's house was even easier than Tony imagined; he made an early-morning run to a nearby hardware store, slinging on a baseball cap and sunglasses and promptly ruining his disguise by using his credit card, but thankfully Tony was able to pass it off with a laugh and a muttered,
Which would have been great, had their intended target been the one to actually be caught in it.
Tony wondered whether he was wrong about Steve's danger-kink, so he tested it out:
"Let's talk outside," T'Challa murmured.
"I don't need to." Steve stopped trying to clamp down on his smile. "I already know the most important things about you anyway."
Steve hides a smile. He'd always thought Iron Man was so persuasive, convincing his boss Tony to supply whatever thing Iron Man airily promised his employer could do for them. Really, it's Tony being a sneaky little shit. The lying is smooth, Steve will give Tony that for free. He thinks about what else he gave Tony and he has to focus very hard for a few minutes on punching the reinforced bag Tony set up for him, strong enough to take his best punches without having to hold back. Steve's thoughts are a mess again, because Tony puts in so many hours for the Avengers as himself,
Steve interviews Tony like he's on the news, using a rolling pin as a microphone, and that's when they learn that some of their languages overlap (Russian and French) and some don't. Steve teaches Tony Spanish and German; Tony teaches him Japanese and Korean in return. Steve's mouth can't handle the Mandarin Chinese, so Tony uses that to whisper things into Steve's ear during their morning sex some mornings.
"I compartmentalized what you and I were doing. I told myself it was fine. Because then I didn't have to think about what I was feeling. Not deeply. I knew I was happy and I thought that was all I needed to know. I told myself what I tell myself every time, that I can just – live in the moment. No point overthinking something that's supposed to just be about feelings." Steve huffed. "But I don't even think
It was just
, I can go fetch Tony, I’m sure he’s just a few rooms away, let me go get him.” Honestly. Steve does feel a little bit ridiculous for never seeing anything suspicious in Tony’s behavior. Hindsight could be unfair like that.
There's a really bad day: Steve wakes up with Tony in his arms, and it's just so nice he forgets his usual routine; he ignores the pressing need to pee in favor of how nice it feels to have Tony pressed up against him.
Steve thought it was acquiescence, him realizing that Steve had a point. But then Steve ran the two words through his mind again and his stomach sank. Iron Man had emphasized the word
The reporter sagged a little. "Another time, then, perhaps," she said.
"Nice. That's a nice amount. Better than the $5 one going around your HR department Pepper roped me into."
"Pbbbt, no chance," Tony said. "I implemented a point-system for cleaning up our evil headquarters. They're so busy cleaning that place up that they barely have any time to think up evil schemes."
been trying to talk about his feelings, in a failing, awkward way. And Tony had assumed the worst, ruining that attempt, and flaring up because of that assumption.
Steve narrows his eyes.
Tony eyeballed Carol warily, waiting for her to look shocked, or ask for clarification, but instead, she just looked sadder. Like it wasn't really a surprise.
"Nothing to apologize about," Tony waved a hand at him without really looking. "I'm
"R&D called to remind you that they need authorization on some new equipment," Pepper said. "I promised that I'd remind you."
some limited inconvenience, surely?
Despite how much he hates the place, Steve takes one look at the pink room, taking in every detail. It's been a jail, but it's also given him Tony. It's worth remembering for that.
The door puzzle tends to have to wait longer for them on those days.
"Are your displays working? Can they tell us anything that’s going on?"
The thought nearly made Tony laugh out loud; it was ridiculous—he managed to swallow it back. He knew to the very base of whatever code he was made from that if he did, this moment would shatter. They were a balanced see-saw right now, a load held by a crane that was straining to its limit. One push and everything would fall. It felt almost like they were frozen; Tony thought he was holding his breath, although he couldn't be sure.
"What about the—" Steve started.
I don't want to be lectured at if--"
"I mean," Steve said, very slowly, "I think so?"
onto the end; it wasn't just his
"Of course," Steve says, placidly, his mood settling when he realizes he can coach Tony later and help him with the task of hiding his identity. Because he's going to tell Tony the truth at the ball and everything will be great.
Tony glanced down at himself. He wasn't in his armor. He was wearing all-white clothing – a t-shirt and loose pants, tennis shoes – and he was definitely, somehow,
Tony looked over to where Steve was smirking across at him, holding the storage device in question between one thumb and a finger.
It did happen. Steve's been counting them carefully, the only measure of reality he has left. Day-in-day-out, nothing changes here. They wake up in this hideously pink one-room-plus-bathroom jail at 7am and every 7am, the place...has entirely reset. It's some sort of puzzle, or trap, or prison, Steve's pretty sure.
"So do you," Steve says. "You're going to find your guy. I can tell."
"You should tell me who you are," Steve blurted.
"Well, yes, that. And the tree itself. I like the drama of it. Everyone goes to bed, no tree. Everyone wakes up—" Tony gestured illustratively. "
″And my fear.″
Steve had been so unreserved with his attraction. If he closes his eyes, he can remember the way Tony had drawn
"Thanks for the save," Iron Man says, once they've weaved their escape through the crowd.
"Sadly I had to leave early," Iron Man sighs. "But I promise I was there! In costume, too."
"….Tony?" Steve’s question was uttered in a ghost of his usual voice, but Tony had obviously heard him loudly enough.
"Tony—"

Apparently, impossibly, the thing Steve seemed to want the most was to

Steve could have been more strategic about this, but he doesn't care; Tony is warm and beneath him, urging him on with his heels, murmuring praise under his breath. They're both covered in produce, fruit pulping beneath their bodies, powder exploding into Tony's hair, giving him the silver-fox look he dyes to avoid. Tony's laughing as he comes, and then they're kissing as Steve pulls out and spills over Tony's stomach, and it's probably a
Tony stood up, rounded his table, and, buoyed by Steve's eyes so intently on him, he straddled Steve in the seat and smiled at him. He kept his motions slow and telegraphed his intent as best as he could. He meant to hold Steve close and keep him, as long as Steve would let him. Tony took one of Steve's hands in his own, the same electric feeling sliding between them even though Steve's hands were still in his gloves. Then Tony took his other hand and cupped it around Steve's neck.
"Do you really hate me this much?" Tony whispered.
Thor and Jen were standing at the foot of Tony's bed, both of them looking down at Tony with matching troubled expressions.
Steve stares judgmentally, because Tony shouldn't know that; Iron Man was the one privy to that conversation. "Iron Man tell you that?" he asks, trying not to sound as peeved as he feels. If Tony wants to keep his identity as Iron Man secret for as long as possible, he's going to have to work much harder.

Steve was always impressed by people like Iron Man, and Iron Man’s benefactor Tony Stark was even more of the same. Both of them had a shiny exterior you had to look past to see the earnest and passionate person below. Steve was a dreamer like both of them. As a child he’d always dreamed of a better future—one that he could actively do his part for—but his dreams were fanciful leaps that blurred over the journey to land at the destination. He knew what he wanted, but the path to take him there was cloudy, and impossible to see. Men like Tony Stark were dreamers too, but Stark was special. He could see all the steps to

It was a warm kiss. A

"Probably longer than you’re dreading, but not as long as I would prefer," Iron Man admitted.
"Carol and Rhodey—?"
But just because Steve had done it of his own volition didn't mean he'd done it happily. Steve would have told him why he was going, if everything was okay, surely? He hadn't, so it couldn't be okay. And if things weren't okay, then Tony needed to help. It was a simple if-then sequence.
Steve makes a noise under his breath. "I've never done this sort of thing before. I was too busy with the war, and then I was busy getting myself deep-frozen."
But if Steve had the danger kink he seemed to, it didn't really explain the way he kept sneaking out of Tony's bedroom at different times of the night:
"I'll be right with you, Jarvis, thank you," Iron Man says.
"Hm." Tony slipped out his phone; he tapped at it furiously a few times. "Guess it's empty now."
"You're not," Carol said, "but valiant attempt at lying to me, I'll give you points for that."
That it was

"Pfft." Carol shook her head. "No one with a

through himself. He lurched forward, wanting to console Steve, but his foot nearly dropped directly through the floor. He looked at Steve's shaking shoulders for one agonizing second before turning on his heel and running back to the stairs, not stopping until he was back in the med lab, staring down at his own comatose body.
"I suppose that's true. I keep getting my timezones mixed up here, that's all."
"But then you wouldn't have had that warm moment of surprise on seeing the tree." Tony shrugged. "I don't mind the task. It's nice to contribute something to the season before work bogs me down. This week in December tends to be the only time my schedule isn't squeezing the life out of me."
Steve stares, realizing belatedly he's completely lost the Avengers. "Uh, training over, I guess," Steve says, too late by the way the others mill out of the room, excitedly chatting about the ball.

Wandering the quiet dark halls of the Mountain alone was an eerie experience he wasn't keen to replicate. When Tony got back to the med lab, Steve was still sitting by Tony's bedside. Carol had gone, but surprisingly, Jan was there. Tony regarded her pretty face gently, a faint pang of regret briefly flashing through him, but he didn't feel heartbroken about how their casual dating had ended. She was lovely, and they'd had a fun time; he'd thought she was a beautiful kisser, but his memories of kissing her felt washed out now, somehow. Diluted. Steve fucking Rogers had somehow ruined even the
because… it wasn't enough.
"Sharon?" Steve stared at her, nonplussed. She wasn’t acting or looking like herself.
By the day of the ball, Steve's made up his mind. He won't tell Tony the truth. It's fine. It's all perfectly fine. It can stay locked in Steve's memories as a wonderful time. And is he really even breaking his promise to Tony? He is going to be there. Steve sighs, frustrated with himself, because that excuse sounds flimsy, even to his own ears, but by now it's too late. The Avengers are going to attend in uniform, to help in the fundraising effort.
Steve's
Steve kind of relates to that. He doesn't feel like himself. He's not the kind to sneak out of a party, to kiss a stranger, to give in to that long-repressed desire and kiss another man. Maybe it is the mask. He does feel invincible in it. Like he can do anything. It's so weird that it takes a mask for Steve to feel the freest he has in years. He can do anything and no one would know it was him.
Their mouths part and Steve pants; the small bit of space allows the air in again and Steve realizes he's almost
Tony didn't turn around when he heard footsteps approach the common room. He already knew who it was without even having to check the Mountain's internal scanners, because only one Avenger moved with that much purpose and that clear a rhythm in his steps. Tony called out "Morning, Steve," and hid his smirk in the nearest tree branch.
″I'm so good at the rapid switch from superhero to CEO that I'm thinking about starting a quick-change act in Las Vegas,″ Tony joked.
Steve looks sourly over to the main door to the room: an intricate metal construction, with two-hundred safe dials embedded in it. Above the door is a legend painted in neat black letters: TO EXIT, SOLVE ME.
Steve. Regularly. How did you
Tony shrugged. "Is anyone dating anyone at the moment?"
When the date comes, it's really nice. Italian food, a lovely tasting menu, and Steve's engaged enough when Tony talks, laughing politely at the funny parts. But still, Tony feels like something is wrong. Like only half of Steve has come on the date with him.
" Tony said, which was a blatant lie, and they both knew it, or Tony wouldn't be up at this time of the morning trimming a tree, but Steve let the lie pass and Tony was glad. There had been an early holiday season when Tony had tried to decorate the tree while in the armor, and Tony had been glad no one had been around to see it, because surprisingly enough, bootjets and flammable foliage weren't always a great combination.
The protracted silence from Iron Man disproved that assumption immediately. "As long as help gets here soon, I’ll be fine," Iron Man said, after that pause.
Steve pulls a face. "Do you know who I am?"
"Something in particular keeping you up?" Tony muttered. He didn't look Robbie directly in the eye; he knew that made it easier for the teen to talk about vulnerable things.
"Why," Tony said, "aren't you letting go?"
"I hate the McCallisters, they have no idea about the sacred space of a good party," Tony says and Steve stares at him, because
Tony doesn't go catatonic again. Instead, their morning routine swiftly changes; Steve comes out of the bathroom to Tony's eyes, trained on him, and Steve's nodding yes before the question's even asked.
Steve raised an eyebrow. "
Tony bristled. Steve wasn't the team leader any more; that job had fallen – and fallen well – to T'Challa and he was doing excellently. Tony barely ever felt resentful when T'Challa gave him an order. Well, sometimes the orders chafed, but that disconnect was due to Tony's beautiful personality, not any particular flaw on T'Challa's behalf. As leaders went, T'Challa was... acceptable. It was a rare person indeed that Tony considered as worthy of taking orders from.
How long had he fantasized about kissing Steve for? Years now. It had been a virus of a thought, a daydream for so long that Tony classed it as just one of those idle fantasies to drag out only when he was single and horny. He only knew it was more than that when he saw Steve bleeding out on the courthouse steps at the denouement of the first Superhero Civil War (he tried his best not to remember there had been a second one; he tried his best not to think about the ramifications of that, because there were questions about his soul Tony wasn't ready to hear the answers for); it was only then that he knew he'd lost the war. They all had.
" Tony muttered.
misfiring again," Carol's voice said, carrying stridently across the room to the storage closet. Carol had always been strong, but apparently her voice was powerful too; at least, it seemed to work on Steve, visibly instantly sobering him.
Steve leaned in closer, still holding that difficult eye contact. ″I

Tony glared at Strange as he swept past him to pick up the book and tools he'd brought with him.
Abruptly aware that he was a person made of nerve endings and muscular contractions, Tony climbed down the ladder as slowly as he dared without making it obvious Steve had ruffled him. Time had done nothing to Steve's ability to affect him like that. After years of fighting alongside him, and too-often
"You could tell him who you are," Happy concluded.
Sharon's eyes blazed silver and something hit Steve hard in the chest. Pain washed over him, blooming hot and hard behind his eyes. He fell backwards. He thought he'd feel something hard impacting his head; Hogwarts was made of hard stone, as far as the eye could see.

"I'm glad you're awake," Carol said, stiltedly.

Tony turned on his heel as soon as the large blank walls of the Circulator room came into sight, ready to yell at Steve, to demand to know what he was
"Frost giants spotted in Iceland, my friends," Thor boomed. "I was hoping you might want to come smash some heads with me, Stark?" He seemed to notice Steve there a moment too late; Thor hadn't quite adapted completely to the one-eye lifestyle yet. It was never a good idea to mention his lack of depth perception to him, though; Thor could out-sulk Steve. "And you, of course, Cap."
"Give or take," Steve murmurs, as loudly as he dares risk with Tony resting against him. Tony's only pretending to be asleep, Steve thinks, but he knows Tony needs to keep up this pretense for now. Steve understands. Everything's overwhelming. Shutting it out is better than letting it in and losing himself again.
So he mentally put on his big boy pants, finished the damn latches, packed up his toolkit, and shakily announced to Steve that he was going.
Tony's inclination was just to nod once, sharply, and then run out of there, as fast as his wobbly legs would allow, but… bravery was the theme of Tony's life right now, wasn't it? Carol and he used to be best friends, best
Steve's face falls. "Aw. But they're romantic. I want him to know my intentions from the start."

Steve could have punched Tony in the face. It probably would have hurt less.

this," Steve said, heartfelt, bitterly.
" Carol gestured at him. "Have you even eaten anything today?"
Tony Stark sure knows how to make impressive things!"
No armor, just the actual man. It's incredible.
"It's been busier than I would have chosen, perhaps," Steve inclined his head as he lowered himself into the offered chair. "I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I was hoping to get a word with Iron Man, if he was available."
Tony nods. "Yeah," he says. "Thanks. That's actually a really great idea."
"What else was I supposed to do?" Tony folded his arms. "You didn't want to raise Sarah in a world where villains would steal your baby, so I...baby-proofed your house
"Flowers aren't a good idea. I'm allergic."
"You were outnumbered," Carol pointed out. It was somewhat reasonable, Tony supposed, but it didn't justify why Steve didn't grab whoever was at the Mountain and immediately head back out again; instead he'd hovered over Tony's unconscious body like a bad smell.
How could anyone not?"
As Steve returned the carafe to the fridge, Tony stared at Happy in rising horror.
What the fuck had just happened? Steve had a baby. A
Steve frowns, and then realizes and stares at him. "Gay people existed in the forties, Tony." Steve should know; until he lost a few decades, he used to be one of them.
Tony shrugged. He was only half-kidding at the world domination part, but he had baby-proofed a lot of Steve's life in the last few weeks, maybe he

you need constant supervision."
"Mmmhmm," Steve murmured, starting to shuffle so they could swap places.
The bulb in this kitchen is just a normal fluorescent tube. Steve knows that for sure. He took it down and smashed it on Day 34. And Day 78. And Day 99, because Tony was being an ass, and it was either smash up the kitchen or smash Tony's face.
"Edwin Jarvis," Steve said, numbly. "Tony Stark’s butler?"
Steve opened his mouth to ask what
He was ready to run, but...
"Consider your promise fulfilled."
"Sipping it looks safe enough," Happy surmised at Tony's first attempt. "But wouldn't he have to slug it down quick, to drink so much milk in the timeframe?"
that was
Maybe it's not Iron Man. Maybe it's the mask. Maybe Steve's only able to be this brave because of the mask. Steve definitely hasn't felt like himself since putting the outfit on. It's the same way that Steve feels different in the Captain America uniform, even though he knows at the end of the day it's just fabric.
allows Steve to bring a guest, but he simply doesn't know anyone to ask.
With those connections in mind, it was swift work to find the town Steve had mentioned, and discovered a small paper trail where a house in that town had been purchased for cash, by a Joseph Grant. Tony snorted to himself. Steve didn't exactly have a knack for the undercover work; he was only good at it in the field when he had to be, because there was little that Steve didn't excel at, when he worked at it. But left on his own, Steve's idea of a disguise was a hat and a trench coat; it seemed his talent for picking undercover names existed in the same ballpark.
Steve's close to Iron Man now, close enough to admire those muscles up close. Iron Man's not talking much, making faint noises of agreement as the woman talking to him rambles about wanting to adopt, but not wanting the responsibility, because what would happen if the kid put muddy hand-prints all over her genuine Picasso?
Iron Man had two metal poles
"I don't mind being insulted if it means not being spied on."
"Another four minutes and we can avoid both."
Iron Man shudders, full-body, and Steve can feel that, at the points their bodies are connected. Iron Man's bright blue eyes scan Steve's face, what's visible of it, before his gaze dips down and Iron Man's smirk widens. "C'mon, let's get some fresh air, Hero."

whole.
Tony mumbles about needing a change of clothes and a shower. When Steve watches Tony cross the hallway to get to his personal suite, Steve feels gutted, like Tony took one of his organs with him. Steve swallows awkwardly and goes into his own bedroom.
Tony kisses back:
"I haven't looked at it enough to make that assessment."
but all Steve felt was anguished grief, because
he was.
Tony rolled his eyes. What did Carol Danvers know about doing the right thing anymore?
They’d gotten close, and each time, their mark had let off a small explosive device and slipped away in the chaos.
Steve frowned at that like he didn't fully believe it, but looked up for his next question. "Weren't Jen and Thor a thing?"
Steve had broken Tony's heart, but… surely that didn't mean Tony had to
"Ow," Tony said, again. "Who turned the sun up that high?"

"Hmm," Tony hummed under his breath. "You mean like a beloved colleague zooming off into the night with no note as to where he's gone or if he was ever intending to come back?"
Her cheeks pinkened, seeing him. Tony hated how much friction there still was between them, in every single interaction.
Ugh, that thought
have hit your head. It's May."
, and one of them made a noise, Tony wasn't sure which one of them it was, but he knew one thing – it didn't matter.
Steve hurts Tony on Day 540. It's nothing much. A slap. He regrets it as soon as he's done it, because the room resets but they don't, and Tony will always remember this, for as long as he lives. Which, in this room, might very well be forever. The walls feel like they're pressing in on him, shutting down on them both, but when Steve measures the width and length of their prison in careful paces, the dimensions always stay the same.
into each other's mouths right now, and it was still unbearably incredible.
Tony huffed an amused noise, which obviously caused him pain. He brought up a hand to his heavily bandaged ribs. The incident had been seven weeks ago now; long enough for Steve's super body to not have a single scratch on it, but not long enough for Tony to be anywhere close to fighting strength yet. It turned out that Tony had lost nearly two liters of blood before Wanda had come in and managed to hold him in stasis until they could get him to the hospital. They were so lucky Tony hadn't died.
He clenched his wand more tightly. "I was… at school."
Steve was an expert at covering his own tracks – and he
"So far," Strange said, also a repeat. "But I still have many options to check—"
Richard Siken, Hansel.
Jarvis nods and backs back into the building.
"I was so scared," Steve said, pulling away from the kiss to rest his forehead against Tony's. "I was so damn scared I'd never see you again."
"I put non-slip pads under all your rugs; there are safety plugs in your open outlets. I'm putting latches now on your drawers and cupboards that could be within her reach soon. She looks like she's gonna hit crawling age pretty damn fast. You're gonna want to install some safety tassels on the kitchen blinds, asap, but you'll need to order those in, your local stores were out."
"Then—"
"Awww!" Jan coos. "That's so sweet. Please tell me you got his
Tony caves first after an hour of snuggling; his morning needs are always on a short delay to Steve's. It's only when the door closes that Steve realizes what he's done, opening Tony to a temptation that he shouldn't have to face in a place like this.
Iron Man’s extended silence was either a sign that it
"Sure," Tony says. Wait. Was that too casual?
"We should really work on changing it," Steve said, his jaw clenching moodily.
Steve froze at Tony's
mere inches away from the unsuspecting other revelers.
"Maybe a good night's sleep would help," Steve says, glad to be able to settle into the rhythm of an old argument.
Tony made a noise under his breath; he was pretty sure that Steve had known him long enough to understand that grunt as the combined affirmative and appreciative response it was. Tony refocused on scanning, logically moving around the tree in a clockwise motion, continuing his upward progress. It was easier as he rose, the circumference of the tree narrowing, the density of the branches lessening.
Jan's eyes narrow. "You mean Tony Stark has essentially invented a new kind of fabric and hasn't talked to me about it?"
Based on the yelling that was going on, Steve was pretty sure Tony would never forgive him.
Tony froze. Happy turned to him, his eyes wide. "Uh," Tony said, helpfully.
Steve pulled back far enough to hit him with such an intense expression that Tony shuddered against him. "Good," he said, simply, before kissing him again.
″You predicted one day your
Tony was expecting to have to pull back quickly, blurt a terrible excuse, and then run. He was ready and braced to have to run to his car, to cry all the way home, to sob out his agony that he would never see Steve again, never mind all the other parts, all the other plans he'd had. He'd spent the last few months agonizing over how to ask Steve out on a date. Tony had been trapped in a cycle of planning to do so and failing; he'd failed only because it was
time, he keeps getting erections whenever Tony feeds him anything strawberry-flavored. This is a problem, because the fridge contains strawberry yogurt, the freezer holds strawberry ice-cream, and sometimes Tony makes up the packet of strawberry blancmange hiding in the back of the top cupboard for Steve, even though Tony hates the texture of it.
"I'm so relieved that you're okay," Steve breathes. "I'm really sorry."
Calm. Tony had to stay calm and in control. That was the plan. Steve was open with him in a way he only was around Iron Man. Around
"How about we spar a little, one on one, now we have the room to ourselves," Steve suggests, proud that the words don't run into one another in his hurry to say them. "The Masquerade Ball is going to be big and new enough for me this week."
It seemed to take more concentration to lean against objects. If that's really what Tony was doing. He tried flicking Carol in the nose, he tried punching Steve in the shoulder (there was some lingering frustration), and he tried slapping Strange across
"You won’t."
"Thanks, Robbie," Steve said distractedly, still staring at Tony.
Steve
"Woah, you're right, it is soft," Jan says. She looks at the others, still squeezing at Iron Man's arm. "He really is as muscular as he looks. The fabric must just

Steve, let alone talked to him. The kissing almost felt like it had happened to someone else in another lifetime. Maybe Tony's fevered, overworked brain had imagined the whole thing.
Apparently Steve was going to continue surprising him.
Tony's shoulders are tense. "He promised he'd be here. And it's—it's so dumb to be upset that he isn't. It's just—I don't know why I'm so upset about it." Tony makes a noise that Steve hates. "It is what it is, I guess."
"Yeah?" Steve perks up, looking pleased. "Well. I just. It was on the spur of the moment, because I'd been building up the courage to ask—"
"Mmhmm," Steve murmured. "We
"Who'd you get?"
A kiss doesn't break the curse of the room, but Steve didn't expect it to; this has always been more of a nightmare than a fairytale.
quirk into something a little more joyful because if Tony was snarking, it meant that he was alive, and conscious, and that was good enough for now. ″I don't think I can get the faceplate back down.″
"Masks are powerful," Tony says, his voice muffled again, and Steve can't help but think the sound is somewhat adorable. "I can understand that, probably more than most."
The reporter was still staring at him doe-eyed, waiting for a response. Steve was still leaning against the wall, looking kind of annoyed that Tony was still messing around instead of leaving immediately.

Incendio, he knew the incantation, he knew how to summon the fire, he knew it to the core of his being. But he was tired, and Van Dyne had been flirting with Tony, and Tony had been flirting back, and this whisper of condescending kindness from Tony was too much to bear—
The further he walked, the lighter he felt. That was probably a bad thing. Or a good thing. It meant he

″Can't we agree to disagree?″
"Bet you've had basically zero hours of sleep since you picked up your bundle of joy, huh?" Tony nodded to himself. "That's fine. That's why you're not really supposed to parent alone if you have a choice."
Steve nodded, shrugged, and gently let Tony down to his feet, pulling his hands away and pushing at his hair, straightening it out as best as he could.
The man ambled up alongside him. "Boy, you
Steve stared at him. "Let me guess.
Iron Man paused. The silence was incriminating.

"You're thinking too much," Steve informed him.
"Well, yes, there is that," Steve agrees.
Tony thought he might resent them, crowding in on
By the time Tony had reached his destination, it was nearly dark, and he'd semi-convinced himself that Steve had an inoperable brain tumor. Tony rehearsed the speech he was going to make if that much was true.
Steve looked tensely, visibly unhappy.
"That makes sense." Tony swallowed, awkwardly. "But there's still...nothing you want
"Oh, no," Steve breathed, and promptly slammed the door in Tony's face.
Steve manages to continue to convince himself that Tony is better off without him for pretty much the full length of the ball. He's busy a lot of the time anyway, helping to convince the wealthy guests to open their wallets a third time, but eventually even he has to admit to himself he's forcing himself to stay occupied so that he doesn't spend the whole thing staring longingly in Tony's direction.

" Robbie squeaked, sounding slightly panicked.
Tony eyeballed Strange. He was interested in the response too.
Tony pulled a face. "Steve."
Pepper bustled in with a pile of papers, marked with post-it notes where Tony needed to sign. Tony gave the papers a cursory look, forcing himself to breathe and slow down. Steve was right there. There was no reason for him to respond

Iron Man hesitates and then holds out his arm towards her. He probably means the gauntlet or forearm, but Jan grins as she steps in and squeezes his biceps.
and he was never going to be by Tony's side again.
For all that the Avengers have rooms at the mansion for when they need, it doesn't mean the large building is always occupied. Sometimes it's just Steve and Jarvis rattling around the place, if Tony's off on one of his international jet-setting business trips; Jarvis refuses to leave when that's the case, like he presumes Steve might lose his mind if he's left alone.
Underneath Tony's fake beard, Tony was sweating, and not just because the suit was heavy, warm material with lots of fur. Steve knew it was him? Well. Knew he was

"How are Stark's vitals?" T'Challa murmured.
"It’s not that easy."
" Steve snapped, his wrist jerking in Tony's direction, and he was just so

Steve's jaw clenched visibly. "I'll grab something later."

"Annual Toybox drive at Queen County Hospital," Tony explained. It was nice to have facts to fall back on. Helped keep his voice level. "This year their Santa had ended up in the ER and, I guess, Iron San-ta to the rescue. Why are you up so late?
When Tony did turn around, it was to Steve looking at him with a blank expression.
As the cameraman and sound guy packed their equipment away, the reporter lingered, twirling her hair in one finger, and Tony smiled winningly. This wasn't an unusual occurrence for him.
Steve stood up, maybe the first time he had since their return to the Mountain. "Then why are you here, wasting your damn time, if there's something you could do?"
Steve swallows and punches the bag even more firmly, trying to stave off his body trying to react to the mental images in his mind. And the implications of what Tony's saying, because Steve made this much of an impression? That he's still talking about him afterward?
"Well. Yes."
—once, so that remains just as a thought experiment.
Sand?
The reporter fluttered her eyelashes. "You free tonight, Mr. Stark? I could find space in my schedule for an off-the-record personal interview, if you get my drift?"
It turned out there was another expression of Tony's that Steve would never forget: the look on his face right then and there. Pale. Horrified. Eyes wide and wet. His lips were trembling.
Iron Man's navigated them to a quieter part of the floor and now Steve can hear Iron Man's actual voice and oh, it's…
get something he wanted so much, but Steve's weight on his anchored him, as much as Steve's kissing was sending him off into the stratosphere.
Tony's eyes widened as Steve pulled away. Steve grimaced, almost comically.
Tony's laughing as the strawberry jelly (and yes, Steve's hard again, just from the smell) smashes against the mess, and he looks so beautiful, Steve can't help himself; he pushes Tony down onto the dining table, even though there's food still lined up on it, and he fucks him there, among the produce, thank god for whatever twisted fuck made this place and stocked it with lube; whoever it is behind this messed up place might be sadistic captors, but at least they're

Extremis had felt like an extension of the sensation, and sometimes, Tony still felt an ache for it, even in this completely new bioengineered shell he called his body. Being around Steve felt like a call, the kind of call that Extremis used to provide answers for. Tony would have to continue to grow accustomed to that lack of a response; it wasn't like a manual existed that could tell someone how to cope with Phantom Operating System Syndrome.
"I—decorate the Avengers Christmas tree every year?"
Tony switches his microphone off so at least Steve is saved from the strangled yell he makes. He takes a deep breath and switches it back on. "You really shouldn't take flowers."
"Tony's body is… an unknown factor to me," Strange shook his head. "A completely new body, built from artifical and complex cells, filled with his consciousness in a manner no one in my circle has yet encountered…. This is cutting-edge echnology we're dealing with, technology that has not yet intersected with magic. We're in unexplored territory here. Perhaps… Tony's consciousness… his soul, if I may… are older than the form it's housed in. I don't know whether his soul is quite as anchored to the body as it should be. That last blast could have merely...dislodged him from his body."
"Tony

for $50?"
"Of course I do," Jan dimples beneath her mask and then winks. "Thank you." She nods at the bar. "Do you want a drink?"
Iron Man was in shock. Decompensated shock, by now, but shock nonetheless. His respiratory rate had noisily and noticeably been increasing in pace, as much as Steve didn’t want to think about it. Had his condition deteriorated to the point that he was already descending into delirium? It was too soon for that, Steve thought, desperately. It was all too soon.
"You're kind of an idiot," Carol said.
Jarvis, bless him, is looking elsewhere with a polished expression of indifference. Which means he's already seen enough of them to decide they look incriminating and he needs to affect his best impression of discretion. Oh god. Steve doesn't know whether he'll ever be able to look Edwin Jarvis in the eyes ever again.
him, and the eggs do explode satisfyingly in the center of the target.
As Steve retrieved his shield from where it had gotten embedded in a wall (maybe Strange had a point about the amount of damage they'd caused), Tony caught sight of an opportunistic media crew still recording the skirmish. He wandered over, lifting his faceplate and grinning charmingly, never shy of a good media encounter.
"Tell me at least
", and Tony had just assumed that Steve was appalled by
The woman makes some sort of blustering response, but Steve doesn't hear it, too thrilled by what's happening right now. Iron Man has taken hold of his arm.
"The only way to keep her safe was to eject myself from the game," Steve said, firmly.
"Ow," Tony said, trying to open his eyes.
conditions, which in hindsight was a mistake. It was the tactical equivalent of saying “hey, what’s the worst that could happen?”, which as everyone knew was the magical phrase that would invite disaster into your day.
Problem seemed like the right word, Tony thought, because as he shuffled aside, awkwardly negotiating the small space, Steve put a hand on Tony's hip to help him turn in the right direction to make it work more easily. Tony opened his mouth to mutter an automatic protest at being man-handled, but the words died in his throat, a lump of intention that got stuck, because Steve was close. So
but pain was preferable to death, surely?
"I think you've said enough," Tony said. He glared at Steve, hating that there was still a spark of hope in his gut. That maybe Steve didn't mean it. He tilted his head. Bravery was stupid at this point, but dignity was out of his grasp, so it was all he had right now. "Unless you have anything else you want to add?"
"Oh, logic," Tony said dismissively, but picked up the empty tinsel crate to indulge Steve's preference for keeping a tidy workplace.

look. That's John Gamelin, the new Vice President of Roxxon. He might look like Santa Claus, but the guy's a dick. If I have to say more than one sentence to him tonight, I'll probably pop him one right in his smug bearded face."
″One would be wrong, and I imagine you don't like that sensation much.″
Steve huffed a laugh that sounded fond to Tony's ears. "Okay. I just wanted to be sure I wasn't missing a hidden meaning."
"I once sewed three million dollars' worth of diamonds into a headband," Jan says, "expensive isn't really part of the discussion here."
the overbearing control-freak you were worried I'd be. I mean, look at me now. Couldn't even successfully storm off."
"What do we do now?" T'Challa asked, his arms folded across his chest.

have tried a nap."
Iron Man didn’t even falter, explaining about how, in the event of a fire, the ventilation would serve to cycle out the hot gas and smoke, which would give people a fighting chance of escaping this morose insult to architecture. That was Steve’s assessment of the building, not Iron Man’s, because Iron Man saw the world differently from most people that Steve had ever met. Iron Man didn’t see beauty in normal things; he saw elegance in invention, in the indomitable human spirit, and in the human capacity to take nature’s building blocks and assemble them into a new and better shape.
show back up to the ball, and as much as Steve tries to tell himself he's not disappointed, it's a lie. And he can't even blurt out once they're back at the mansion that Tony is Iron Man without having to untangle the reason why he knows that. Even Steve knows there's no graceful way to explain that he knows who Tony is because he's obsessed with Iron Man's thighs. And he can't say it without Tony knowing Steve was the one who kissed him like that, and Steve can't think back to that kiss without a modicum of embarrassment.
"I'm sure," Iron Man mutters, and then there's a low whirring noise emitting through his speakers and the armor...sort of deflates.

Happy laughed when Tony pulled out a bottle of milk and a tin of cookies, but the amusement didn't stop him from generously helping himself to both. Jarvis had been baking non-stop since the start of December. Jarvis enjoyed baking and counted himself as a pro; he was deeply delighted to have the excuse of hungry superheroes to indulge his hobby.
He closed his eyes yet again and dozed off until he heard a muffled cry. When he looked around to find the origin of the sound, he realized it was his newborn son. Girl one and girl two were still sleeping safe and sound. He wondered where Steve was at the moment but then again he didn’t care enough to actually look for him. Instead, he put the little boy into his arms.
“Of course. As soon as you stop threatening
Tony nodded although he already knew he would be responsible for all of it. He didn’t want to have it any other way. Why would he shove this responsibility to Steve who was working? No, he could deal with everything he was given, he was Tony Stark. He could do this. “What are you doing in your free time?”
“I know. But you left the party without my permission. You need a lesson, Tony. You know you do.”
“That’s not true.” he said. “You know it isn’t. They loved me. Yeah, they weren’t the best to show it but they did. Just like Jarvis.”
This will be the second last chapter to the story. I'll finish the epilogue as soon as I can. Thank you all for your reviews, it really helped!
Tony could not think straight. He was just relieved it was over. He tried to stop the sobs that had not entirely come from the pain. No, most of his tears were tears of humiliation. He had been ordered to go on his knees and Steve had punished him as if he was a little child. And it had hurt but what had even been worse was the fact that he knew he could not escape his fate, nothing could have changed Steve’s mind. It terrified him, this thought.
Steve transferred half of his plate on another plate and let Tony eat it. it broke his heart how thankful Tony looked. “Thank you so much. So you’ll be at work and I’ll handle the rest.”
“It’s soup. Something an upset stomach can bear.I know it was not the best punishment for you. I made a mistake and I am sorry.”
“It’s my job.” he repeated.”But thank you for the compliment.”
“Not another word from you, Tony. You will not contradict me like this. And just when I thought we had established some rules.”
“It might be better if you sit, Captain.”
When his son was finished, he put him back into the crib and wanted to sleep again. He sent a text and put the phone away. This was the exact time the girls started to protest. Tony sighed and was glad at the same time. At least he hadn’t had to deal with three crying babies at once.
“Okay.” Tony felt like crying when the fingers that stretched him disappeared. He whined and tried to rock his hips more as if it would bring them back.

“You were in labor. Hormones. I get it. I read something about that.”
Thank you for reading, ladies and gents! Sorry for the long gap between updates, I'm doing my best. Life is crazy as you all know. Leave a comment for me, yeah? See you soon.
Steve nodded. “Yes, Tony. We’ll manage.”
