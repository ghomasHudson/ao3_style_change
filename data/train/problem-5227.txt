“Is that the sword in the stone?”
Gabriel nods.
They stand there in the aftermath, breathing hard. Dean slips out of Castiel, kissing his shoulder again, starting to clean them both up before exhaustion takes hold. He wants nothing more than to collapse on to the ground with an armful of Castiel, but the tile would be too unforgiving for that. They help each other dress, hands gentle and soft as they pull up pants and tug at shirts. Dean kisses Castiel’s temple, tasting the sweat still clinging to the short hairs there as he helps him button up his shirt. They pick up their belongings, Dean poking his head out the door to see if the coast is clear, before reaching out for Castiel’s hand and leading the way back to their departure gate.
“We should probably get back out there.”
“You don’t like it?” Castiel asks, arms falling down to his sides.
Puriel steps forward, pulling his blade out from under a brown and black poncho, which is disconcerting in more ways than one. The other two remain stalk still.
Sam sighs, deciding his best course of action is to not respond. He doesn’t want to give Gabriel anymore ammunition. The archangel doesn't need any help.
“Cas said somethings. To me.” Dean says, taking a deep breath, “Turns out, I was his happy thought.”
“Does everyone know about that?”
He’s a young man, clean shaven, hair slicked back, and dressed in a black suit and tie. For a second, Bobby is sure he's an angel, but closer inspection proves him to be a human soul. The guy is a little too wide-eyed and wet around the ears to be one of Heaven's foot soldiers, despite the uniform. The space around the fountain fills up quick as the rush of people push forward. The man balances himself by holding on to one of the many cherubs that decorate the stone structure, each mini angel pouring water out of stone pots. Something about the little cutesy faces of the cherubs bothers Bobby. They’re out of place here, and couldn’t be farther away from the real deal, at least in Bobby’s experience.
“We’ll hold the line,” Anna says, looking up at Gabriel, “Just get them out of here.”
He wraps his arms around Castiel, breathing in his scent as Dean's fingers glide along the planes of his back. Castiel has his arms around Dean’s neck, pulling him in for another kiss.
“Yeah,” Sam says, voice sad and eyes downcast.
“Abaddon will know who broke in whether there are any witnesses left or not,” Castiel says.
“I haven’t always been what I appear to be,” Castiel says, voice quiet as he looks down at the shorter man.
“I’ll tell you when we’re all together. None of you are going to like this, and I will only be able to stomach the mandatory angry, angst ridden whine-fest from the three of you once.”
Dean has enough presence of mind to grab Castiel’s hand before he lets Jack maneuver them through people as he scopes out the best houses to stop at. They lose track of Sam and Gabriel in the mad press of people. Dean figures that wasn’t an accident. When he points that out to Castiel, the fallen angel shrugs, unperturbed. Jack slows down after awhile, taking in the atmosphere around them, enjoying the sights and sounds. They do things up right around here for Halloween, that’s for sure.
Castiel concentrates on Dean. The man lies on the hood of the Impala under a clear night sky, looking up, “If you’re trying to console me brother, you’re not doing a very good job of it.”
“Oh, we were in Jane’s cabin last night,” Past Dean says, eyeing his future self, “Apparently, we and Risa have a connection.”
It’s not that Dean hasn’t done this kind of stuff with a guy before, because there were more than a few times back when Dean was in his early twenties. Some of them were drunken episodes he remembers through the whiskey induced haze. Others can’t be blamed on the alcohol. Under the right circumstances, Dean Winchester definitely swings that way.
“I’ve acquired many skills over the years that I’m fairly certain your brother doesn’t wish me to demonstrate for him.”
“Yes, actually.”
There’s so much Sam wants to say to Jessica. He has rehearsed it in his head so many times, but it all seems so small now. There aren't enough words to encompass what he needs to say. He kisses her instead. It’s the goodbye he never got to say. It’s not the same. It’s not nearly enough. But it’s all they’ve got, and he’s grateful to have that.
“I know —“
“That’s because I can’t and you know it.”
The angel rolls his eyes at the hunter, coming to the conclusion that Dean has finally lost his mind, “What is it you think humans should say to one another, Dean?”
“Yeah, I’m here,” Dean says with a smile that immediately turns into a frown, brow furrowed, “Jesus Cas, I thought you were a goner.”
“What?”
“If I come at Abaddon in anyway that doesn’t involve crawling on the ground and groveling, I’ll be the guest of honor at dinner this evening and I won’t be sitting around the table, if you catch my drift."
“Wow, that was helpful.”
It starts getting better. As Sam concentrates on moving his toes inside his boots, then his feet, then his legs. He finds that once he gets his legs back under control, his arms come back right along with them. He turns to look at Dean, who is busy taking his arms for a test drive.
“Burn Crowley’s remains.”
Dean says,
**********
Castiel’s tone is softer this time, but it’s teeming with rage he didn’t even know he felt, “You promised to honor and obey that girl. To -- to love her until the day you die --”
Jessica grins at Jo, “I concentrated.”
Dean glances at Castiel, “Did you know about this?”
Castiel simply shakes his head at Dean as he takes a polite bite. Dean shrugs and returns to tearing meat from bone.
“We don’t have a choice,” Dean says, frustrated, “Sammy, listen, this is how it’s supposed to be. You were meant to lead an army of Hell, right? That’s what they kept preaching back when Lucifer and Michael wanted to hitch a ride with us. It's not exactly what they meant, but damn it if you’re supposed to lead an army, then lead one.”
They don’t speak for a few moments, both left to their own thoughts. Someone in Castiel’s past must have given him that crap line about art being a waste of time. Dean finds he’s angrier than he probably should be at that person, considering he’s only known Castiel for a few hours.
Dean raises an eyebrow, “Okay, so I’m part angel or something? Got to say, I haven’t seen any fringe benefits.”
“How about you buy me dinner first?” Dean asks, still chuckling as the glass doors slide open.
Dean pats the shotgun beside him, “Either way, I think we’re covered.”
Dean is all for that. He’s so on-board, part of him wants to hold out just to see Castiel take control. He wants to let him flip Dean over onto his back and just
Just like with Bobby, she’s there, but since he’s stuck in his body he can’t feel her properly. It’s like trying to talk to someone on a radio frequency and you’re not tuned in to just the right channel.
“Why would you want to give me a choice about anything?”
“You think I still need a chaperone.”
“Well yeah, things were great a lot of the time, but it’s just like anything else. Sometimes there's crap you’ve got to deal with and you’ve got to do the work. Is Cass worth it?”
Sam does have a point. All they have to go off of right now is Castiel, who had trouble opening a pickle jar at lunch. Their resident fallen angel isn’t up to snuff, but Castiel has always been different. Maybe it isn't the same for the rest of the angels.
“Sure sweet cheeks, step right on up,” Jack says, looking between Sam and Castiel as Dean moves closer to the wall, “And which of you two lunkheads are making the trip with him?”
Sam takes it as a good sign.
“ - because I can’t believe you were that oblivious. Years, man. Years.”
“You in town for business or pleasure, Cas?”
Dean gets what Sam and Bobby are trying to tell him, but it’s Castiel’s life on the line and he can’t be rational about that. He has to be though, if he wants him back. Dean keeps his eyes on Sam, letting his brother’s steady presence anchor him. Dean stops pushing back.
“No, don’t leave, I’ll come get you... I don’t care, just stay put,” Sam says, ending the call.
“A little warning woulda been nice,” Dean says, as he grabs Castiel’s hand.
Jack shrugs, “We bonded over a mutual appreciation of giving to people that which they deserve.”
Dean tells Kevin everything that happened. He tells him how he had stopped Sam before he could finish the last trial after Dean found out that it would kill him. He talks about Cass flapping off back to Heaven to shut the pearly gates, but clearly something had went wrong on that front as well. Not for the first time tonight, Dean wonders where Cass ended up. He pulls out his phone every few minutes to check for missed calls. There's nothing. He tries not to think of all the possible reasons why he hasn’t got a call yet.
Dean gets the feeling that, ‘fine’ might be a bit on the optimistic side. He opens to mouth to question Sam further, but his little brother beats him to it.
“This way kids! Try to keep up,” Jack says with the cheery disposition of an overzealous tour guide, “No really, keep close. You’re hard enough to conceal when you’re right next to me. Get a little distance and it’ll be impossible.”
By then, so much time had passed that Daphne had picked up the pieces of her life, moving out of state for a new job and saving Castiel an awkward conversation. “Emmanuel,” Castiel found out later, had been declared deceased after an exhaustive search. Daphne had even put up a small monument in the cemetery behind St. Augustus church near the house they had lived in. Nestled in the back near an elm tree, Castiel had stood and stared at the tombstone. It only had a name and a death date, since “Emmanuel” hadn’t remembered his birthday. He wouldn't have had one to remember even if he'd had access to his memories. Still, it was a pleasant spot, even if it was for a man who had never existed.
“What happened to him?”
The archangel must see the panic in his eyes. Gabriel grabs onto Castiel, reaching out to get a tight hold on Sam as he comes skidding to a stop in front of them. Dean’s head bounces from the abrupt stop in movement, his arms hanging loose. Sam studies him, trying to see some sign of life, but he feels a tug in his midsection distracting him as Gabriel tightens his hold. A second later, they’re gone.
“I think we both were.”
Mary laughs, “Without Gabriel, I don't think any of us would have made it. Some of these angels aren’t nearly as bad as you seem to think they are, Dean.”
“Do you have anyone in mind?”
Crowley goes without a fuss, allowing Dean to lead him through the Bunker. He doesn't say a word. It’s disconcerting how docile the demon is being and Dean has to admit he can almost feel the change in the guy next to him.
Cas is well aware of the fact he is not at all what he used to be. Not by a long shot. Even so, he still finds a small amount of pride in the fact that he is not completely useless. With much grunting and many muttered curses, he manages to move Dean's deadweight back over onto the bed with Castiel, not wanting his past self to wake up without his charge by his side. What can he say? He knows himself.
“He hasn’t called,” Dean says, as he lounges on the bed, flipping through the channels.
When he finally finds what he’s searching for, he straightens back up and looks over at Castiel. The man is standing there, hands gripping the sink behind him like he might fall down if he lets go. His eyes watch every move Dean makes. He walks towards the man, putting his stuff on the shelf behind Castiel, their eyes never losing contact. Dean slides his boxers down, throwing them out of the way before dragging Castiel to him, relishing in the feel of all that skin on his.
He glares at the back of Cas’ head. Well fine, if that’s how Cas wants it, Dean can work with that. He rolls off the ex-angel, grabbing the lube lying forgotten on the side of the bed Castiel is sleeping on. He puts it to good use, sliding up and down his dick, bucking up into his hand at the touch. Dean has ignored it for way too long. He starts trying to prep Cas, not wanting to hurt the guy, but the fallen angel reaches back, stopping his hand.
That’s why when he first sees what looks like Castiel standing at the end of the corridor in the middle of a wider opening, Dean doesn’t believe what he’s seeing. It feels like he has been walking for years. For all he knows he has been. Of course he’s going to start seeing Castiel in every damn corner of this place. Dean blinks his eyes hard and shakes his head, trying to dispel the mirage, but when he looks again, Castiel is still standing there.
Dean watches as Castiel’s gaze travels down to Dean’s lips, “I miss my friends.”
“Any ideas?” Bobby asks.
The group makes their way towards the door. It isn't locked. The souls holding them must have assumed they wouldn’t be able to get out. Either that, or there’s a trap waiting for them somewhere, which isn't a pleasant thought. Pam leads the way, using whatever psychic sense she can to feel her way towards whatever is down below. With any luck, she can catch anything heading for them before they get to them. Ellen brings up the rear, watching their backs. They move as quiet as they can through the darkened halls.
Dry, forever chapped lips are crashing against his before Dean can even begin to recognize what’s happening. There’s a madness to the demanding press of Cas’ lips. He tastes of alcohol and grimy earth. It’s nothing like he’d imagined Castiel to taste like. Not that Dean had ever imagined that…
“You think Abaddon will want to spring Lucifer again? What are we on, the third or fourth apocalypse now?” Dean asks, rubbing at his temple. His head is starting to pound.
“A what? A soldier?” Ramiel asks, tutting and shaking his head, a rueful smile pulling at his lips, “Oh my dear, sweet little brother, do you truly think God would go out of his way to bring you back so many times from the brink of oblivion if you were just a simple soldier?”
“…the Hell? So what, you ditched the the assholes in the winged dicks brigade for another douche that pushes you around?”
“Yeah,” Dean says, glancing over at him.
“Really?” Sam says as Donna and Jody groan at Dean. “Look, I hate to cut this short, but —“
“Why?” Dean asks pressing himself as far away from the archangel as his headboard will allow.
“There are worse betrayals Crowley could have committed,” Castiel sighs, “Besides, Sam seems to think -”
“Hey Cas,” Dean says, proud that he sounds like a normal person.
“Cass?”
“Don’t you ever touch Dean Winchester like that!” Castiel growls, his nose almost touching Cas’, “It’s not right.”
“Really?” Rufus asks, pausing in mid-drink, “Well, that’s...”
It’d be one thing if it were just Dean the part of him controlled by the Mark of Cain was hunting. But Castiel’s here now. Dean has to keep him safe.
He would have thought Castiel would be tentative considering how shy the guy had been at the beginning of the night. He’s anything but. Castiel’s hands fist themselves in Dean’s shirt, holding him still as he nibbles on Dean’s bottom lip, tongue sliding over it. When Dean gasps, Castiel uses it to his advantage, tongue running along the top of Dean’s mouth as he grinds up against him.
“I think our resident angel hadn’t heard that particular bedtime story before,” Crowley says.
“Cass?” Dean asks, his voice rough like he hasn’t used it in years.
“Oh, Dean,” the thing in Castiel says, smirking.
The silence that follows is deafening. Dean can feel the tears stinging at his eyes as he stares at his hands, unable to look at Sam.
It’s meant to be a distraction, but Dean can do two things at once, despite what Sam may think. He pays as much attention as he can to what’s going on in the room around him. Sam may not like it, but the way Dean sees it, he’s better off learning how to control his graced up soul rather than let it get the best of him like it did the night him and Castiel went up against those demons.
Castiel raises an eyebrow at him, but doesn’t push, deciding instead to return to his book. After heading to the bathroom to finish getting ready for bed, Dean shucks his T-shirt and jeans. He slides under the covers next to Castiel.
“I’ll check on you later.”
“Who were they?” Sam asks.
“You sure do know how to entice a guy,” Dean says, clenching the tablecloth in his fists.
“If we could please get back on topic,” Crowley says, irritated at having his conversation hijacked, “The Reader’s Digest version is Abaddon hunted down the rest of your extended demon blood family and has, through a process I’m sure none of you are chomping at the bit to hear about, narrowed the group down to twenty. I believe the final step will be to train them so hard they start breaking. Whichever seven remains will get the dubious honor of being possessed.”
“The witch. She got to you before I could. You were distracted and I…” Sam says, looking away, “I couldn’t get there in time, Dean. I’m so sorry.”
Castiel sighs, “He’s still not done.”
“Gross.”
“Why are you here anyway?” God asks, grumpy, “You’re ruining my finale watch party.”
Mollified for now, Dean eats, taking slow, careful spoonfuls and giving it a rest for a minute or two between each bite. It’s chicken noodle, because of course it is. Much as he’d rather be sleeping right now, Dean is happy to see his little brother. It’s the only good thing about meal times these days.
“No, I don’t.”
Oh, it’s so on.
“Good. It felt like a direct hit, but…ya never know.”
“Who’s asking?”
Looking beyond Uriel, Dean can’t see an end to the valley. They’ve been walking for awhile now, so retreat isn’t an option either. Up is out of the question. There’s no way they can climb these walls without some kind of assistance. So unless Dean can manage to sprout wings in the next few seconds, that's out. He doubts that was one of the fringe benefits Joshua was talking about anyways. Besides, Dean has never been much for flying.
Sam gives Tracy, Ted, and Simon space to try to settle in, but he spends the night in the Barracks along with Kevin and Crowley. Dean calls to say Castiel had headed out on his recruitment mission. Dean sounds grumpy, to say the least. Sam is glad when he tells him he’s staying at the Bunker to try to get some sleep, and not just because he doesn’t want to deal with Dean’s mood. His brother doesn’t look the best. Castiel told Sam that he suspects Dean still isn't sleeping as well as he should be, and Sam feels like he’s constantly pushing food at Dean, which is disconcerting on so many levels. Sam thinks Dean is holding his own, but there’s no way of knowing for sure.
“First we have to get out of this building,” Ellen says, turning back to the room at large, “Pam, can you feel anything nearby?”
“I’m cut to the quick, Moose, I really am. Have our misadventures these last few months meant nothing to you?”
“Still as presumptuous as ever, I see,” Death says, “I had hoped your misadventures playing God would have taught you some manners.”
“What are you babbling about?”
“Yikes,” Dean says, eyes widening as he looks through the pictures the local corner had sent Sam, “Dude’s insides look —“
“Listen,” Dean says, putting a hand over his eyes as he tries to stop.
“We’ve hunted on less. You thinking monster?”
The black sets off Cas’ ridiculously blue eyes perfectly and Dean finds it hard to look away. He’s not sure how long he and Castiel stare at each other. He’s even less certain when his body forgot how to breathe correctly. They may have stayed that way the rest of the night had it not been for Sam clearing his throat somewhere behind Dean.
“Where are we going?” Castiel asks.
“How’s Cass?” Dean asks after taking a drink from the glass of milk sitting on his tray, throat still scratchy, but better than it had been before.
“No, that’s why I’m talking to you.”
“Nothing,” Castiel says, with a shrug.
Bobby decides against pointing out the obvious and telling the kid that, considering this is Heaven and all, he should be able to conjure up a brand new record player out of the blue. That fact isn't a state secret, so he figures the kid likes things this way. It turns out the record just needed cleaned up a bit and soon the sounds of Pink Floyd fills the dingy apartment.
“Thanks. How’s it going? What do you want?”
“Nope.”
Sleep claims him once more. It's impossible to tell how much time passes before Dean starts to stir. He feels the hunter move under him, the weight of his arm lifting as Dean stretches out as much as the backseat of the Impala will allow. Dean lets his breath out in a rush of air and Castiel is surprised when Dean returns his arm to it’s original position resting around Castiel.
Sam rolls his eyes, “Does it really matter?”
Somehow the angel had managed to put 15 different holes in the sheet. Dean walks over to him, inspecting the damage, “I think you’ve got a few too many there, Cas.”
“What do you do for a living?”
“I provided some of my own mojo, but we still need a human and an angel to willingly hand over some of their soul and grace to power the spell.”
“Dean, it’s not raining.”
“Get us out of here,” Sam says, eyes locked on Gabriel.
“I’m taking a shower. You hanging out, Cas?” Dean asks as he stands, shrugging off his jacket and tossing it back on the chair.
“Hi,” Charlie says with a sweet smile that Dean doesn’t trust at all.
Castiel does the air quotes with his fingers and Dean finds it very hard to let that one slide in the name of keeping the conversation on track. Bob Seger’s “Against the Wind” starts up in the background. Dean missed whatever was playing before it.
The kid looks at the window, then back at Bobby.
“Wait.”
Castiel backs off, giving Jack more space between them, “Not only do we need to break into Heaven, but we must also gain entrance into the part of Heaven set aside for deceased angels.”
I started this off wanting to write a season that could end the show. One that brought back as many characters as possible while still giving my main four (Dean, Sam, Castiel, and Crowley) their own character arcs to complete. I wanted to women to be bass asses. I wanted to leave enough on the table to continue it on if I wanted (or in like a real life situation, if the show got renewed). I guess, basically, this was my version of season 9 in story form and minus the filler episodes. I hope I succeeded at some of that.
Dean laughs, “Maybe you should open it first before you call me an ass.”
After locating the necessary supplies, Dean hands Cas a white sheet and a pair of scissors. He tells him to cut some holes, two for his eyes and one for his mouth. Dean even puts the thing over his own head as he gives his instructions, so the angel has some idea of what he was going for.
Sam walks into what pains Crowley to call an office. It lacks his customary flair for design, for the moment only consisting of shelves, a desk, and a chair. With zero budget or access to the outside world, he did what he could with it for now, stealing a small potted plant from the library to add a little color. With any luck, he’ll be able to talk Sam into at least letting him put up a few paintings. He considers broaching this very topic as he glances up at the younger Winchester. Sam gives him a smile bordering on apologetic. Crowley returns his eyes to his computer, knowing a lost cause when he sees one.
Sam throws him an annoyed look. He hadn’t meant to jump in and interrupt like that, but the question had been bothering him. If things could go sideways on Castiel, Dean wanted to be prepared.
“Don’t thank me yet, we haven’t accomplished anything.”
The way Kevin says it is unsettling. He can hear the sympathy in the prophet’s voice. It isn’t something Crowley deserves.
“Sorry, guess I just didn’t peg you for a horror fan,” Dean says, with a chuckle.
“How could you know that?”
“Dean?”
“You know, I never did understand the parroting of the vows thing.”
“Which is why I’m taking Crowley.”
“Any idea what kind of state they’re in?”
“Yes.”
“A what?” Castiel asks, shocked.
“Distracted.”
9. A New Day Yesterday - Jethro Tull
“How do I know which one to pick?”
That shuts Dean up. He glances at Sam, looking flustered. Sam gives him a look, because while his brother acting weird and embarrassed when he puts his foot in his mouth is nothing new, it’s still annoying. Dean slumps in his chair, fiddling with the label on his beer bottle and doing his best not to look at Castiel.
He definitely doesn’t tell Castiel that the best sleep he has gotten in the last couple weeks is last night when they had slept in the back seat of the Impala together.
Just being down here is a drain on him. It was taxing during their adventures throughout Heaven. Hell can’t be any better. If anything it would be worse. It always is. If it wasn't for the pull of that fuzzy connection he has to Castiel dragging him deeper into the depths of Hell, Dean would still be lying crumpled on the ground where he had landed. He follows that feeling, letting it pull him wherever it might lead.
Sam laughs,
“I have —did.” Dean says quietly.
Dean takes his legs off the bed, patting the open space, a signal for Castiel to come sit next to him. Castiel does so, warily.
“We’ve been waiting for you, Castiel,” the guy in the middle says, ignoring Dean’s comment.
“Yep.”
“Rufus lives about five miles that way with Aretha.” Bobby says, pointing further up the gravel road leading away from the Roadhouse, “Thought she’d have better taste. And your mom and dad, they got a place over yonder.”
“No. Cas,” All he gets is a blank stare. Sighing, he adds, “We can’t do this.”
Castiel tries to grab the hunter with his other hand, but the cavern is trembling so violently, jolting them in all different directions. Flashes of bright blue explode through the cave, as huge parts of the floor give way. Rocks fall from above, pelting Castiel as he tries to duck out of the way of any big ones. Dean isn’t so lucky.
Dean’s brain grinds to a halt, every motion coming to a stop, his hand still grasping Castiel’s leaking dick. Castiel is never so blunt about sex. Hell, Dean can probably count the number of times he’s heard the fallen angel curse on one hand.
“I’m very old Jack,” Castiel says, voice lower than normal.
“And soon you won’t even be that. What’s left of you will burn away, and I'll be the only one left. As it should be.”
“Not that I’m aware, and I would have been aware of something like that. Every demon would have.”
“You might want to rethink that. I know how pathetic they look,” Crowley says, gesturing towards the force gathered behind him, “but you know how hard it is to rally an entire army these days. We had scheduling errors. People didn’t show up where they were supposed to. And don't even get me started on finding transportation for all these people... Lets just say everything was a logistical nightmare.”
Castiel still looks skeptical, but relents with a nod, “All right. If you understand that I’m choosing you. I’m not missing anything by staying here with you, Dean. I’d be missing something if I didn’t.”
“Unfortunately, no,” Castiel says, “We have a rouge knight of Hell on the loose and we believe she is building an army to unleash the lords of Hell.”
Sam thought it was funny and suggested Castiel go as a Charlie Brown ghost. Dean thought he looked more like swiss cheese, which just wouldn’t do for Cas’ first time properly celebrating Halloween. Deciding it would be in his best interest not to put any more holes in Bobby’s sheets, Dean scrounges up another one and drapes it around Castiel after instructing the angel to ditch his two coats and blue tie. He fastens the sheet like a cloak, only the front of Castiel’s riotous black hair poking out from under the makeshift hood.
They collapse to the ground, Castiel’s body writhing in their shared pain. He can hear Dean shouting his name. One final push and Castiel wrenches control back from Ramiel. He can’t hold it long, but there is one last thing he must do before he loses the ground he’s gained. Castiel jerks his head up, searching for Dean. The hunter is trying to drag himself over to where Castiel is lying, his body still writhing as Ramiel fights against his hold.
“I didn’t think you would want to stop.”
Sam has the decency to throw Dean an apologetic look before hitting Gabriel on the back of the head, “But I didn’t mean right this second.”
“Okay.”
“If he’s even still there.” Sam says, “Jack brought everyone back. I mean, I know he says he was going to be hands off, but he wouldn’t have left Cas.”
“I’ll meet you guys in the car,” Sam says, as he picks up his bag and heads towards the stairs, “Try not to sound like S.W.A.T. busting through his door.”
“There’s a mass of something a floor below us. There’s too much interference for me to know exactly what it is, but none of the energy in that area has moved since we’ve been here.”
Moving around to the back of the shack, Cas crouches down. He feels along the foundation, finding the piece of wood that he knows pops off. It’s only a matter of seconds before he has a heavy bottle of something clear in his hand. Grinning, he replaces the cover and stands.
He feels Dean’s hands travel up and down his sides, slipping under his blue prayer shirt. Nails lightly rake across his skin as Dean pushes harder against him, keeping Cas pinned against the wall. Suddenly, the hands disappear. Cas hears the distinct sound of a zipper being undone. While it has been a while, he still knows that’s his cue.
Dean looks up. Castiel moans above him, hands flat against the door as he watches Dean suck him down. He feels a tug on his hair a few minutes later, Castiel backing up to give him enough room to stand. He kisses Castiel hard, tongue pushing past the fallen angel’s lips to let Castiel taste what lingers of himself. Dean pulls back, Castiel’s lips chasing him, his eyes dazed as they open again, staring at Dean in amazement. Dean smirks and side steps him, walking towards Castiel’s bed. He flops down, arms crossed behind his head and watches as Castiel strips off his clothes.
“No.”
“And stubborn and exasperating and --”
“It’s about time you two! I thought I was going to have to lock you guys in Bobby’s panic room or something,” Sam says, smiling from ear to ear.
“The egotism. You think yourself so far above everything in creation --”
When they've finished, Dean calls an old hunting buddy of Bobby’s. The man does frequent runs across the United States carrying everything from cars to furniture. For a small fee, he helps hunters move anything big that needs moving. He agrees to drop off the stuff they can’t pack in the back seat or trunk of the Impala when he heads through Kansas in a day or two. Dean gives him a drop spot about thirty miles from the Bunker. From there, it’ll be up to him to get everything home. With that settled, he and Castiel load the last of their finds up and they get back on the road.
Dean looks at him and smiles, “Good.”
It’s a stupid question, but Dean is out of his depth here. The angel doesn’t acknowledge him.
Dean hears the agitation running through Sam’s voice as he closes his book, fingers fiddling with the yellowed pages. Over the years, Dean is pretty sure they both have come to terms with the fact that they will be hunting in some way, shape, or form for the rest of their lives, however long that might be. Most of the time he is all right with that prospect and he thinks Sam is too. But this is different. This isn’t hunting. Not in the same sense. For Dean and Sam, not only is it personal, but it’s dangerous in so many more ways than getting hurt or killed out on a hunt. This runs soul deep and they can’t seem to escape it.
Dean doesn’t say what else Castiel had said. That Dean wasn’t a broken thing. That he wasn’t daddy’s little solider. All the terrible things Dean had always deep down known was true for so many years. He doesn’t tell Sam Castiel erased all of that in those few minutes when he told him it wan Dean who had taught the angel to care about people. About the whole world. All because he cared for Dean. That Dean was greater than whatever damage had been dealt to him. That what he did, every action he’d taken his whole life, came from love. He doesn’t repeat those words to Sam. The words that were both a balm and a burden Dean kept safely harbored deep in his soul. One of Castiel’s last gifts to him. One Dean has tried to be worthy of ever since.
“Yeah.”
“Yeah, well. He needs to be every once in a while,” Dean says, pausing as he leans towards Castiel, their foreheads touching, “What about you? Were you ready to disown me?”
Gabriel stares at him like he has lost his mind, “There are no other archangels. Just Mikey, Luci, Raphael, and little old me. I’ve had Raphael tied up for awhile now, and you know the other two can't be your problem. Unless you two knuckle heads have managed to majorly mess things up.”
Sam pauses long enough to give Dean a genuine smile before disappearing down the hall.
“Don’t ask me if I’m OK, Sam,” Dean says, waving him off as he sits down at the table, across from him, “You already know what my answer is going to be. It’s going to be the same every time you or Cass asks it, so can we skip that part and get on to something important?”
“Trained soldiers? Trained soldiers who know their surroundings and can see what’s coming?”
And a wild Gadreel appeared. He wasn't supposed to be in this fic, but I liked his character, so... here he is lol Besides, I like the idea of him leading the formerly imprisoned angels on the road to redemption. :) We've passed the midway point now, and will start heading towards the end. I'm not sure how many more chapters there will be, but we're on the downward slide.
Crowley visibly bristles at being called good.
Black eyes stare him down as Dean presses against him again. With a smirk, he drags the blunt edge of the newly sharpened knife against Castiel’s neck.
“Can’t you feel that?”
“That’s why you keep calling me, Cassiel,” Castiel says, more annoyed than anything, “You think I’m him.”
“Hurry up, Edgar! I’ve got to get home early tonight. Tomorrow’s the church bake sale and craft show. Jophiel wants everything turned in an hour before hand, so we’ve got plenty of time to setup.”
“I don’t know how she plans to extract them from Hell,” Crowley hesitates, looking at Sam, “but she’s got what they’ll need to survive here.”
“That’s not it. Try again.”
was Saint Peter?”
“So, if I’m looking up, you’ll be looking down?”
“I can’t decide if I want a bacon cheeseburger or a double-decker BLT," Dean says, pausing to look over his menu at Castiel, "Dude, they even put bacon on the Reuben.”
Charlie hangs out after the movie for a while, talking. It’s fun, but Dean has plans. He pretends to fall asleep. It isn’t too hard with all the practice he’s been getting the last few weeks. He lets his eyes droop and his body go as still and limp as he can manage. Charlie and Castiel exchange quiet words once they notice. Charlie heads out not too long after, turning off the light as she goes. Dean figures he and Castiel will have plenty of uninterrupted time before someone else comes calling.
Bobby nods, “We found out later that was Castiel trying to talk to Dean without a vessel.”
Castiel doesn’t leave him hanging long, closing his fingers tighter around Dean’s dick. He sets a steady pace, thumb swiping along the head, smearing precome as he slides up and down. Dean’s hips buck up into Castiel’s fist, chasing more friction. Castiel traps Dean’s legs with his own. He uses part of his body to keep Dean pinned down, his damn hand giving him what he wants, but just this side of not enough. He’s dangling Dean off the edge and it’s torture.
“Wow, that doesn’t sound ominous or anything,” Dean says, “Sounds like a bust to me. I kind of doubt we’re still on any of the archangel’s Christmas card lists at this point, considering we're the reason their either dead or caged.”
**********
“Friend of my dad’s, yeah. Anyway, Dad left him in charge of us if anything were to happen to him. Bobby moved down to Lawrence from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, so we wouldn’t have to uproot. He took care of us and everything settled down after that. I guess the rest is history.”
“Do you want me to stop?” Dean asks.
Dean had presented him with the largest gourd he could find, telling him it was only fitting for such a gigantic brother. Sam had been less than pleased.
Puriel screams as his eyes start to glow. His body collapses, covering Castiel as it falls forward. Castiel hasn’t moved. Dean grabs hold of what used to be Puriel and pushes him off to the side.
“We’re not the only ones looking for you. There are groups of us stationed at places you are known to frequent,” the guy says, turning to look at Dean for the first time, “And, by extension, the Winchesters.”
“I know. That’s why you’re taking Gabriel and heading down there. I’ll stay here and take care of Metatron.”
Dean looks out at the river below him, flowing out of sight among the forest, and smiles, “Hey Sammy.”
“Why this place?” Dean asks, leaning forward, his elbows resting on his knees.
“It took time to get in touch with him. You’d given me enough information that a friend of mine who’s an alumnus of Stanford was able to track him down,” Castiel says, glancing away for a moment, “He wasn’t too happy to hear from me. I had to convince him that I truly had lost your number. He’s very protective of you.”
Sam turns toward Dean, “This is Jack?”
“I lost my husband, Greg. When the demons came to take me, they killed him right in front of me. Made me watch,” Simon glances down at his hands, clasped together on the counter top, “I know the look.”
Sam knows this is hard for Dean. As the rage starts to subside, he can see all the different emotions warring for control on his brother’s face. Anger, panic, fear, and an endless pain as old scars tear wide open. Sam feels it too. All of it. They can't escape the flames that engulfed Sam’s nursery all those years ago. It consumed their father as well as their mother, and it just keeps going. It will never stop. Not until Sam and Dean are added to the ashes.
“No, one of the
“I thought you said vengeance isn’t cheap.”
Jack just shrugs, “You see what you expect to see.”
“You’re lying!” Sam shouts, tears falling again as he shakes his head in denial, “He was still alive. I know he was.”
“Then what -”
Dean runs his hands along the smooth planes of Castiel’s back, dragging his blunt fingernails across his skin, swallowing the moan that slips out of Castiel’s mouth. Dean backs Castiel up against one of the sinks. His hands slide down to the waistband of Castiel’s boxers, teasing along the edges. He kisses a trail down Castiel’s throat and along his collar bone, causing Castiel to let out another moan, the sound filing the room.
Dean wraps his arms around himself, shivering as he tromps through a good foot and a half of snow. Huge flakes blow sideways as the wind snakes around him, wiping his face and making his eyes water. He swears he can see frost accumulating on the tips of his eyelashes. When Death had told him it would be hard to get back in his body, this wasn’t what Dean had had in mind. He isn’t even sure how he got here. One minute he was with Death in imaginary Chicago, and the next his ass was crash landed on freaking Hoth.
Castiel wants to kiss him. It’s one of the few things they haven’t done together, despite Dean’s repeated attempts. But something keeps stopping Castiel. It’s a line he’s too afraid to cross. Dean leans towards him, trying to close those last few inches that separate them, but Castiel puts a hand on his chest before he can get there, pushing Dean flat against the wall again.
Dean tries to swallow, but his throat won’t work. Instead, he manages a gruff, “What was it?”
“Cass?”
Sam snorts, “He’s in Ohio, working at the Cleveland Botanical Gardens.”
“Most?”
“When Dean was airlifted out of Hell, this shrieking sound kept following him around. It broke in windows, shattered mirrors, and left the boy with blood running out of his ears.”
Castiel complies, but Dean hears him grumble, “You’re ridiculous.”
“The fallen angels. Kevin found names,” Sam says, handing Dean a beat-up spiral notebook, “Look.”
“Oh, I remember that period,” Cas says as he moves closer to Dean, causing the hunter to scoot more towards the middle of the bed, “I’d thought it was because you were tired. Stretched too thin due to the pressures of fighting an oncoming apocalypse.”
Dean opens his eyes, surprised to see the light still on in his room. He could have swore he’d turned that off before crashing. Sitting up, Dean realizes that yeah, he did turn it off. Someone else had flipped the thing back on.
“I believe you needed to find your brother. You were waiting for him,” Castiel says to his shoes more than to Dean, “and for me.”
“This isn’t about me,” Dean says once his brain catches back up with the situation.
Castiel had only learned of the existence of the other archangels a few short months ago. He had never seen his older brother before in either his true form or in that of a vessel. The archangel comes to him in a human form. He wonders if the image he sees in front of him is an image of a man from the line of vessels destined for Ramiel’s use had he ever been in need of one. Ramiel stands before him in a grey suit. His wavy brown hair slicked back as dark brown eyes stare him down, calculating.
17. For What It’s Worth - Buffalo Springfield
“Some power from a human soul, we know,” Dean says, “I can --”
Ramiel releases him, turning away, “I will do as I please.”
“Pleasure doing business with you,” Crowley says, backing away slowly as Abaddon turns her attention from him to her gaggle of demons sitting on the sidelines, barking orders as she goes.
“Sorry,” Dean says, apologetic as he makes his way into Castiel’s bedroom, “Why are you ransacking your own room? Kind of looks like a bomb went off.”
“What?”
“From both of you, mind,” Jack says, looking around Castiel to Dean, eyebrows raised, “And old Stingy Jack always collects.”
“I do not wear flannel or plaid, Moose.”
“What’s she talking about?” Jo asks.
Dean nods, “Bring it on.”
Sam glances down at himself, as if he’s surprised to see the tuxedo he’s wearing, “I uh -- What exactly has Cas told you?”
Castiel doesn’t answer. The archangel’s tone is taunting, and when Ramiel allows Castiel to see where they are, he realizes why. ‘Fond’ is not the word Castiel would have chosen for such a place. They’re in Hell. It’s not a portion of Hell Castiel remembers visiting, but that was not Ramiel’s point. The last time Castiel had spent a great deal of time down here had been to save Dean, his hectic, but brief sprint down to the Cage to free Sam after the apocalypse notwithstanding.
“Did you hear that?”
“Look Dean, it doesn’t sound like it’s going to matter if we ever get ready to fight her if she manages to raise the lords of Hell. These people are her key to doing it. If we take that away, it at least buys us some more time.”
“You’re going to have to narrow that down.”
“Fine. Don’t you dare touch my meat lovers,” Dean says, pointing at the former King of Hell.
“Does that mean we’ve got more out there to worry about?”
Dean shakes his head, “It’s a spell or a curse, right? The witches are dead and I’m not what it needs to work right. If it doesn’t run its course, it’ll end with me.”
“Good”
“No, not really.”
“Boys?”
“C’mon, Cas, don’t leave me hanging here.”
“That wasn’t exactly what I was going for.”
“That might prove to be difficult. I’m not sure how many are left.”
“Why?”
“Let’s find you a ride.”
Gabriel grabs him before he hits the floor, “Sam?”
“Bobby Singer, I believe?”
He can remember sitting in rooms just like this one for hours, watching over the Winchesters as they slept. Those nights had passed by quick for the angel. Considering how many millennia old Castiel is, a few hours used to mean nothing to him. Now, when he glances at the clock on the nightstand, fourty-seven minutes feels like an eternity. He stays where he is, unsure of what else there is to do besides wait. The newly fallen angel is still looking at the hunter, his thoughts wandering, when Dean turns over, rubbing at his eyes with the palms of his hands. He blinks in the light for a few seconds, before he sees Castiel.
Dean gets the distinct feeling that Cas is moving in on a particularly skittish animal. Dean being the frightened, furry little woodland creature in this scenario.
“In this case, I suppose it is. That connection is what’s allowing you to help heal your brother.”
The doorway closes behind Dean, leaving Crowley alone to his thoughts, which is not what he wants right now. Crowley is terrified, not that he’d ever admit that to himself, let alone Dean Winchester. It has been such a long time since he hasn’t been in control of himself and the world around him. He had tried so hard to forget what it's like, but the longer he stays in this almost human state, Crowley finds that those memories bubbling just below the surface.
Castiel wakes screaming, his eyes flying open. He tries to get air in and out of his lungs, but is having trouble getting them to respond. His heart races and his head pounds as pain shoots through his vessel. He supposes he should start thinking of it as his body now. He sits up and leans back against a nearby tree, shutting his eyes as he tries to steady his breathing and his heart rate. He never thought he would miss the fall he had experienced during the Apocalypse. Back then he had eased into humanity. While that slow slide had not made his transition any more graceful, it was small portions of trauma spread out over time.
“Good point,” Dean says, crossing his arms again to hold in heat, “Shoulda thought to grab my car keys. At least we could've stayed warm.”
“What exactly are we looking for?” Castiel asks. They had long since located the books and had been wandering through the junkyard ever since.
Bobby readjusts his ball cap as he raises an eyebrow at the kid, “Aren’t you even a little bit concerned there’s a stranger standing in your living room? A stranger that came in through your window?”
“Dean.”
Jo had been forced to bow out early, but that hadn’t been the end of it.
“Well, not the mental breakdown thing or whatever the hell is going on in my head right now, but this right here?” Dean says, squeezing Castiel as he nuzzles his nose against Castiel’s jawline, “Yeah, it’s nice.”
Dean puts his hands on Castiel’s hips, pulling him flush against him. While Dean had been fighting with his clothes, Castiel had removed the rest of his, leaving only his boxers and his socks on. Dean kisses him. The heat’s gone, their movements slower and softer. Dean shivers, caught between the cool black tile against his back and the warmth of Castiel’s skin as he brushes against him. Dean kicks his boots off, Castiel taking care of his jeans. He gasps, losing all train of thought when Castiel’s fingers graze across his dick through the fabric of his underwear. Castiel grins at him, letting Dean shimmy out of his jeans. He tosses them out of the way with one foot before Dean allows himself to be pulled back in.
Sam leaves Charlie as acting head nurse for the Bunker’s invalid ward while he's away. Dean had told Sam what a load of crap this all was and how he and Castiel didn’t need babysitting. Sam had informed him that while Castiel didn’t, Dean did. He’d had that stupid, smug smirk on his face when he’d told him that too, which left Dean steaming. Castiel hadn’t tried to buck Sam’s rules, at least not yet. Dean, on the other hand...
They take off down the hallway, the old man’s shouts echoing after them. They run past a line of windows, the dark runways visible only by the different colored lights blinking along the outlines. Dean can hear the labored whine of the Segway’s engine. It sounds like the old man is gunning it, not that that means much from what he's seen. He reaches out a hand, grabbing on to Castiel’s coat sleeve, pulling him around a corner, making a sharp left turn. They both nearly fall, crashing together as they struggle to get their feet back underneath them, laughing the whole way.
It had been a month since he'd seen Balthazar last, but Gabriel he hadn’t seen in well over four years. Balthazar is a jet-setting freelance journalist for a number of major magazines, while Gabriel is… Well, come to think of it, Castiel isn’t sure what Gabriel does for a living. He likely doesn’t want to know, considering it's Gabriel.
Dean kisses his forehead as Castiel lays his head on his shoulder. They won’t be able to stay here long. The concrete floor is as cold and unforgiving as the wall, but for now, Castiel curls into Dean. He closes his eyes, listening to the sound of Dean’s heartbeat. He wonders if, when the time comes and Dean moves on from him, he’ll be able to survive without this.
Dean blinks at him, eyes bleary with sleep, “Dunno. You'd have to ask Sam or Bobby.”
Joshua nods as Sam and Castiel head out from under the shelter of the trees and disappear up the path.
Crowley shakes his head. No sarcastic remarks. No threatening monologue. This is close to being the freakiest thing Dean has seen all night, which is saying something.
“Are you saying we walk in, straight up the driveway, past all the demons and the croats and we shoot the Devil?”
“What?”
The memory wipes. Castiel didn’t remember whole sections of his past. Those memories had been taken from him to keep Castiel towing the company line. To control him. But what if it was because they didn’t want him remembering what he was?
**********
“Biscuits?”
“Yes, Dean. How can I help you?”
“Cas?”
Dean looks around, peering through the crowd of costumed people. He nearly knocks over a guy in an Admiral Ackbar suit as he turns just in time to see his brother be tackled by a curvy brunette dressed in a very form-fitting cheerleader costume. Sam stumbles at the unexpected impact, but eventually manages to right them both.
Dean must look like a wild animal right now, because that’s how Bobby is talking to him. He feels like it. He doesn’t know if it’s their connection or Castiel’s grace that’s stuck inside him or just Dean himself, but it’s like his body is screaming at him to move. To get to Castiel. To do something.
Ramiel is standing near the door, watching as Gabriel and Sam grapple with Abaddon. She looks up, catching sight of her lord and master, but Ramiel doesn’t lift a finger to save her. As Gabriel takes Abaddon down, Ramiel slips through the door of the building. Dean changes directions, moving after Ramiel as fast as his body will let him.
They meet Crowley in a shut down diner. The once shiny, chrome exterior rusts in places. The neon sign next to the road lies broken into pieces at the base of the post it had once swung from. The green door almost comes off its hinges in Castiel’s hand as he opens it to let Sam and Dean pass through. Black, spray painted sigils line the walls and if given a few minutes to search, Sam is sure they would find a number of hex bags scattered throughout the old diner.
"Really?"
“Aw come now Kevin, you’ll be much happier not having to look at this face everyday,” Crowley says, gasping some of the words out.
Dean watches as Castiel runs a hand down the trench coat, like he’s smoothing out the lumps in a bedspread. The hand pauses at one of the coat’s pockets. The fallen angel reaches in, grabbing something out that he puts in the pocket of his new coat. Castiel doesn’t volunteer anything and Dean doesn’t ask. Castiel grabs his bag, sliding it up onto his shoulder as he follows Dean out of the Bunker to where Sam is waiting for them.
“We’ll keep you covered until the others get here,” Karen says, squeezing Bobby’s arm, “They shouldn’t be long.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Waiting for us?”
Dean chuckles as he leans in, placing a soft kiss against the angel’s lips.
Dean stares up at Castiel, “Happy Halloween?”
“You need to be here,” Castiel says.
Sam half expects to walk in on a full blown fight, and is surprised to find the exact opposite. Crowley is still going over his crossword and Kevin is writing something in his notebook, both finishing off a piece of pizza. Castiel sits next to Crowley, examining one of the four boxes, apparently trying to decide which one he wants.
“I think I’ll leave the stunt work to you.”
“It’s okay, Sam.”
“Uh, I thought you guys wouldn’t notice?”
“How long does it take to pick a damn lock? Did you forget how to do it?” Bobby asks, feeling exposed despite the deep shadows this far into the alley.
Sighing, Dean does. He stares at his little brother who stares back at him, a strange mixture of grief and hope warring on his features. And maybe Dean needs some sleep, but does Sam’s face seem a little less smooth than it should?
Dean fights the urge to start yelling. While sending Crowley anywhere with anyone is always nine kinds of dumb, that isn't Dean’s only problem with Sam's plan. He can’t tell Sam he’s concerned that this grace healing thing won’t work if Dean’s not close by. What if his little brother starts getting worse?
Eyes searching the area once the ground beneath their feet settles, Castiel sees Pam and Ellen running back down towards them. Neither of the women have to say word as they come to a stop in front of Castiel and Bobby. Even Jack has rejoined them, eyes trained on the building. Castiel sees the shadows moving along the sides of the factory looming far above their heads. Wings spread as shrieks fill the air around them causing a shiver to run up Castiel’s spine. They’ve got company.
That stupid asshat. Gabriel had one job. One damn job. Keep Sam safe. How in the hell does that translate into ferrying Sam down into the Pit? Dean’s about to say as much, but pain shoots through him. Sam holds him close. Dean can feel his body shutting down on him. He’s cold, and even though he wishes his brother was anywhere else right now, it’s nice to be so close to something so warm. It’s comforting.
Castiel feels the slight press of Dean’s thumb against his Adam’s apple as he swallows.
“We’ve been a bit busy of late, if you haven’t noticed.”
Silence falls between them. Castiel searches for another train of thought. For some other question. The weight of Ramiel's claims about Castiel’s past makes it difficult. The confusion and panic work to scatter him further, and he can’t let that happen. He has to keep control.
“Wherever our boys are going, we’re going too,” John says, “Whatever’s going on out there, we can help.”
“Stick with the younger one, find out what you can. If your Intel checks out, I’ll contact you. If it doesn’t well...” Abaddon says, with a grin, “I’ll contact you either way, but I don’t think you’ll enjoy what I assure you will be an excruciatingly long conversation.”
“I’m not scared,” God says, less than convincing.
“He’s telling the truth,” Sam says, “We met him a year ago. He traveled through time, but he died before he could return."
Castiel glares at him, his frustration bubbling over, “Then what is?”
Rufus snorts, “That’s a small disturbance? Hate to see a full blown problem.”
“Hey, maybe we -”
“Did you really?” Castiel manages to ask, keeping his voice level even as his knuckles go white from gripping the edge of the filing cabinet door as he rereads the name of the file in his hand for the ninth time.
“Damn it, Cass, you were supposed to leave me,” Dean says, words slurring.
“I'm guessing it says, ‘Heaven’ on Cass’ birth certificate. Jimmy Novak on the other hand -”
Castiel stumbles through his apartment door. The key catches and he nearly tears his arm off trying to stop his forward momentum to turn back and yank it out from where it’s stuck in the lock. It has done that since he moved in two years ago. One of the many quirks that came with living in an older building.
Relief washes over Castiel when he spots Dean and Sam emerging back into Heaven. Jack had been distracted by the intruders every bit as much as the rest of them had. Whatever sense that told her the boys were ready to come back, must have jolted her out of her distraction. Jack had made a beeline to the wall where the sigil was still visible, scrambling to reopen her end of the door. It had started to glow as soon as her fingers touched it. The next thing Castiel knew, the boys were walking out with two other souls in tow along with Gabriel.
“Yeah, it’s just a short slide down.”
Sam looks as though he wants to say something else, but the girl drags him down for a forceful kiss. Dean has no idea who this chick is, but she seems to be about Sam’s age. She’s hot, long hair tied in pig-tails and her red and white costume accentuating all the right places. Still, there’s something off about her. Dean finds her innately annoying, which is odd. Normally, when a girl looks like that, he doesn’t notice things like personality traits. Or names.
“By the time you got your feathery ass down there, I was enjoying every second I spent torturing souls. I was good at it, too. You remember, Cas? That wasn’t the Mark. That was all me.”
The angel studies Dean. Sam inwardly groans as Dean and Castiel embark on yet another one of their epic staring contest. He feels compelled to smash their heads together. At least if they started making out, these insufferable eye-sex matches would be over. Only the nightmarish image of his brother trying to jam his tongue down the angel’s throat keeps Sam rooted to his spot. While he’d totally be cool with Dean and Cas being a…whatever, he really doesn’t need to see it. He doesn’t need to see Dean with anyone. Ever. Thanks.
“We’ll just be on our way,” Bobby says, moving to walk around the woman.
“Oh,” Castiel says, glancing away.
He’s standing in the aisle, looking up at Dean and Castiel, holding a bag of what appears to be rice.
“Consider it as good as done.”
More angels appear behind Uriel. They all seem to be in vessels, or at least they’re presenting themselves to Dean and Sam that way. Dean remembers a few cracks made about how limited they were as humans and therefore could never see an angel’s true form. He’d prefer to see none of their forms, because while Dean doesn’t recognize any of the other angels behind Uriel, they all look pissed.
“Is Saint Peter and the Pearly Gates not a tale you tell downstairs anymore?” Jack asks.
Dean blinks up at the ceiling, “Why?”
“Right now I’m a mechanic in my Uncle Bobby’s shop, but I’m training to be a firefighter.”
After taking Crowley his lunch, which he’d not only graciously accepted, but also
“You say that like it’d be a bad thing,” Dean lays down his menu as he leans towards Castiel, voice solemn, “Let me tell you something, Cass. Now that you’re human, there’s a few rock solid rules you gotta know, and one of them is that everything is better with bacon.”
Sam and Cain have been sitting and waiting in Dean’s room for over four hours. During that time, Sam had decided to take the demonic hand cuffs off of Dean, concerned that the markings might interfere with the transfer. They haven’t seen Castiel or Dean move a muscle while they’ve been here. The First Blade rests in Cain’s hand, his hold on it loose. Sam runs a hand through his hair, agitated. His thoughts drift back to the agreement he’d made with Cain hours earlier.
“Stop calling me that.”
“You’re right, they are very good at what they do, but none of them can give you the inside track on the Winchesters.”
A huff of a laugh ghosts across the damp lines Castiel’s tongue left on his neck, causing Dean to shiver. Castiel shakes his head, “We do not learn such things in Heaven, Dean.”
“We’re burning daylight,” Dean says, voice quieter, “If I drive all night we can be there when the doors open. You and Cass can sleep on the way.”
They sit in silence for a few moments, watching as Sam receives his high school diploma. Sam waves it at someone in the crowd, but he can’t find John or another version of Dean sitting anywhere near where Sam is smiling at. Dean turns to Castiel, his once vivid green eyes now dulled. Castiel feels like he can’t breathe.
Dean sits all the way up and reaches towards future Cas, “Hey man, are you --?”
Castiel nods and hands him a piece, taking another one out for himself. Crowley thanks him before returning to his puzzle. The Winchesters stare at each other in shock for a moment before joining the other three at the table. It’s quiet. It’s calm. Sam thinks maybe this won’t be so bad after all.
“Friends, I’ve been asked to give you a message. It has been decreed that Heaven will be a joint paradise from this point forward. No more will we be separated from our friends and family.”
Gabriel beams them out to the front steps of the imposing stone church Dean and Sam had found themselves in when they first arrived here. Just looking at it fills Dean with dread. One glance at Gabriel tells him the archangel feels the same way. Angels pop in around them. Dean turns to see Anna standing at the front of the group. He spots Alfie a few rows back, Weiner Hut outfit and all. He thinks his real name was Samandriel. Dean is glad Castiel isn’t here to stand in front of some of these angels. He’s not sure how the fallen angel would have reacted.
She leans into his space once more. Crowley stays stalk still.
“Maybe I can come back for fall break or something,” Sam says, standing just outside of security.
“Oh for God’s sake, will you please stop making that insufferable racket?” a voice asks.
He finds Cain straddling his little brother, choking him to death. Without a second thought, Dean rushes Cain, slamming into him. They both go tumbling, Dean knocking into one of the bookcases, sending books and files to the floor. He watches Sam kill Cain with the Blade. He watches as his brother leans back on his heels once it’s over, trying to catch his breath.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.”
Cain manages to get himself upright enough to look at Sam, face twisted in pain. He’s gripping the First Blade tight, but he holds it out to Sam.
“Abaddon --”
“Just like that?”
“That’s where Abaddon is headed next. Big goings on in your own backyard, apparently.”
There's a visual aid at the end of this one, so don't be surprised when a random picture pops up at the end. Thanks to everyone who has bookmarked, subscribed, kudo'd, or simply taken the time to read! You all rock! All of the above are always greatly appreciated!
“Seriously?”
“Wonders never cease.”
“Calm down? You can’t show me something with that son of a bitch's name on it and expect me to be calm!”
“Please,” Castiel says through a whimper, body shaking.
“I don’t want to.”
She jerks her head in Dean's direction, Castiel's eyes flicking to Dean before he looks back to Mary.
“It never would’ve been.” Dean says, feeling his throat tighten from something other than pain, “I need to say some things to you.”
Sam isn't listening to Kevin as he talks. Dean’s eyes have glazed over, his expression blank. It’s like he’s not even there.
They glare at each other and Dean knows Castiel is already plotting, certain that once they make it back home, he’ll be able to get Sam on his side and Dean will cave. He’s wrong though. Dean might not know exactly what he’s feeling about Castiel these days, but he knows he’s not going to lose him again, just like he isn't going to lose Sam. He can’t.
It takes them a few days to make sure all the ghouls will be in attendance, to gather all the necessary weaponry, and to get a large enough group of hunters to act as “guests.” To that end, Sam calls Bobby to have him send some of his hunter contacts to help. After hanging up, Sam tells them that the old hunter wanted to know who he needed to send the dowry to for finally taking Dean off his hands. Dean is less than pleased.
Dean tries to lie low. He gets maybe ten minutes peace, before Sam comes swooping into his bedroom, seconds away from hulking out on him. In the end, Dean wears Sam down, telling him that he’ll take it easy. That everything is fine. That he won’t overstep his bounds. His brother doesn’t believe him. Castiel, who’d been right behind Sam serving as backup for their ambush, seems to believe him even less. The three of them come to a stalemate on the issue and it’s tabled, at least for now.
“I lost my trench coat. I took it off before getting in a cab and left it when I was dropped off at my hotel. I called the company as soon as I realized I was missing it, but they never did find it.”
Dean nods, hands traveling up the angel’s arms, willing him closer and Castiel concedes.
It takes two tries before Dean is able to kick the wooden door open. It swings wide, banging against the wall. Castiel is tied up on the opposite side of the room, feet chained, his arms held above his head by his own tie. All Dean can see is the top of his head, his messy black hair more mussed than usual. It’s too dark to see all the damage, but Dean can see blood on the angel’s shirt. And on the floor.
“I have been in contact with one or two. Jophiel comes to mind. He found me not long after our exile. He was the official caretaker of the souls’ personal Heavens.”
Jody threw her hands up, “She’s only picked you twice. Out of five.”
“How come you stopped?”
“Will any of these run?”
“Yeah. I hunted for a while after you… I don’t know. One day I met this girl and we hit it off and…” Sam says with a shrug and a goofy smile.
“Who was that guy?” Dean asks as they start down a nearby alley whose architecture looks like it would be more at home in Ancient Greece.
Henry only nods, eyes wide like he’s begging John to believe them.
“What about you and Ash?” Henry asks.
“You’re right. I'm doing it because want to,” Castiel doesn’t say anything, but the look on his face forces Dean to add, “I know this is all intimate and whatever, but seriously dude, don’t chick flick out on me. I don’t think I can deal with that right now.”
It reminds Dean of a night in a derelict barn, what seems like a lifetime ago. Light bulbs blowing left and right, glass and sparks raining down as the boards that gave the barn its shape threatened to fly apart at the seems. All of it coming from a scruffy looking dude in an over-sized trench coat walking through the door. Dean swallows, taking a step back as Castiel moves towards Jack.
Flipping on light switches as he goes, Sam bursts into the room, “Wait! Stop!”
“Yes,” Castiel says, though he doesn’t seem to be paying much attention as he moves down to kiss along Dean’s jawline.
“Witch-killing bullets.”
“Dean.”
Jophiel laughs, “Calm down, Dean. Yes, I’m going to help you.”
“What?” Cas snaps, jumping at the touch. When he turns back towards them, that smarmy smile is fixed back into place, “Hey, if you want Castiel up your ass, who am I to judge?”
“So warm…” Castiel murmurs, voice broken as he runs his hands down Dean’s sides. His fingers hit skin where Dean’s shirt has ridden up near his jeans.
“Don’t.”
Cas chooses to ignore his brother, “I suppose I have you to thank for my other self falling asleep.”
Castiel is close. Dean isn’t far behind. His rhythm starts to stutter as that familiar warmth builds in his low belly. He grips Castiel tighter, slamming into him with short, hard thrusts. Castiel comes first, out of nowhere, like a punch to the gut. Castiel’s back arches, Dean stroking him through it. He clenches down around Dean. He looses his breath. Two more jerks of his hips and Dean’s gone. Dean almost collapses down on top of Castiel, his forearms holding up most of his weight as he rests his head against Castiel's chest. He's working on gathering enough brain cells to start thinking about moving off of Castiel when he hears a noise from behind him.
It’s just if he dies out there he’s toast. Dean isn’t worrying needlessly. Sam can’t tell his brother not to be concerned about it. Blinking out into nothing doesn’t sound like the greatest thing in the world. Heaven is screwy right now, but it’s better than nothing. Sam would take existing over not existing any day of the week.
“Why should we tell you anything?” Sandy asks, “You’re supposed to be the bad guys.”

“I left out any important details,” Crowley says, hands up, “I needed something to give to Abaddon to make her trust me. Speaking of which, you’re looking at her newly minted double agent and your welcome. Save your outpouring of adoration for later. I highly suggest you get on the phone.”
The angel isn’t sure if the Dean he’s holding is all of Dean Winchester. He doubts it. But it’s clear this Dean possesses all the thoughts, emotions, and memories of the man Castiel knows so well. If the human soul has a heart, this is the part Castiel has tucked against him.
She stops an inch from his face, her breath sickly sweet as she continues, “The thought of one of your breed ruling over all of Hell is laughable at best. The fact that you had the audacity to even try is as astounding as it is insulting. Tell me why I shouldn’t gut you where you stand and let you watch yourself bleed out onto the floor.”
“It was never a secret to those higher up in the ranks of both Heaven and Hell that you and Sam were to be the beginning and the end of this world," Joshua says, "The only real question was who would come out the victor and, despite what you may have been told, the outcome of that battle was far from guaranteed. The powers that be in Hell knew that you would break the first seal, but they also knew that Heaven would eventually need you back on Earth.”
He can only blink at the hunter, still unable to get his brain or his body respond. The smile on Dean’s face falters at the lack of response from Castiel.
Ramiel’s hatred for Cassiel is proving to be great motivation for the archangel to continue stringing Castiel along for the time being. He suspects Ramiel is keeping him alive long enough to see everything that Castiel has worked so hard to protect come undone. That suits Castiel just fine. It’s irrelevant to him if he was Cassiel at one time. If he was, that was another lifetime. It’s a being Castiel doesn’t know and can’t remember. What’s important is holding on to who he has become. He is Castiel, former angel of the Lord, and current human being. He’s a friend. He’s a hunter. He has become so many things that most angels would never dare dream of, least of all Ramiel. That will be his advantage.
When he’s tired he stops to sleep, sometimes in his car, but most of the time at a motel. When he runs low on cash, he calls on the skills he’d acquired over the years watching the Winchesters. He might have an excellent poker face, but he’s awful at the game. He sticks to hustling pool, which he’s very good at. He loses just enough to keep his opponents guessing. After his first few weeks on his own, Castiel even picks up a few hunts. He takes out a ghoul in West Virginia and a vengeful spirit in Texas, all on his own.
It’s a shock when her hand pops free. She sits stunned for a second before her mind catches up. She shakes the rest off her other hand before bending over to start working on the ties holding each ankle to a separate leg of her chair.
“It’s not like they’ve got powers or anything.”
“Data entry. They’re having us fill out information on every soul in Heaven, specifically family groups and friends for each individual.”
“Yes, I do.” Dean says, “I’m so p-proud of you, Sam. Everything you’ve done. Everything you’ve built —“
“Fine,” Dean stands, stretching as he goes. He turns back to Cas and gives him a small smile, “Guess I’ll see you later, Cas.”
“Go on ahead, we’ll hold down the fort,” Bobby says, a raised eye brow directed toward Ash and his machine.
Out loud he says, “Well, if you only knew what he can do with his tongue. You see --”
Charles motions for them to follow him over to a table where a map is laid out, held flat by bits of metal sitting on each of its four corners.
Gabriel shrugs, “He needed help with a little project he’s been failing at for months and I offered my services.”
“I told you, they --”
“It ain’t, ya idjit.”
Dean almost jumps out of his skin as he spins around. They had walked right by the man. Joshua digs in the dirt surrounding a patch of ground planted with an intricate array of wildflowers, somewhat obscured by some bushes. He doesn’t spare them a glance, content to continue his work. Joshua looks much the same as he had when they had met in Heaven, and he hasn't attacked them yet, so Dean takes that as a good sign.
“Cas, damn it, what did you do?”
The angel doesn’t let Dean stop him. He was serious when he said that he wanted to tell Dean.
Dean is waiting at baggage claim, watching people pass him by. There’s a kid throwing at fit near the luggage carousel. His parents look like they’re seriously considering leaving him at the airport’s lost and found. Wave after wave of people make their way down the escalators, all grabbing their bags and heading off to meet taxis or shuttle buses. It’s weird sitting there when the place clears out.
Castiel doesn’t get to see much of Dean as they continue to make the necessary arrangements. The elder Winchester spends most of his time playing the happy groom for the locals, in an attempt to keep suspicions to a minimum. In the short moments he does see him, Castiel tells Dean of his adventures in wedding planning and finds himself taking great pleasure in the laughter his tales generate.
“Cas! Hey!” Past Dean yells, running up to him.
“All right.”
“Watch, by the time the next season rolls around on his ridiculous dust ball, they’ll have found another way to break something else or themselves or both,” Death says, grabbing another handful of popcorn, “Another season, another catastrophe. Around and around we continue to go unless they all die for good or you cancel this entire thing.”
“You leave a little something to be desired in the execution,” Ellen says, laughing as the rest of their group files in.
It seems so strange to Castiel. For months, he had sought his Father without any results and when he stopped looking, God finally reappeared. Moments after Sam Winchester fell into the cage, casting both Lucifer and Michael down, God had returned. He had proceeded to heal Dean and resurrect Castiel and Bobby. After much yelling from Dean, which his Father had somehow found the man endearing and amusing as opposed to irritating to Castiel's everlasting relief, God had separated Sam and Adam from their respective angels and raised them both from Hell.
“Castiel and Dean Winchester,” The man says, beaming as he gives them a bear hug each, lifting Dean at least six inches off the ground.
“It’s early. The sun hasn’t risen yet.”
**********
For the most part everything on the Camaro was in working order despite being left in the salvage yard for so long. Everything under the hood is done. Some stuff had needed to be replaced while others just needed cleaned out. The essentials like oil changes and fluid levels are all finished. The car is road worthy, if not the prettiest thing anyone's ever seen. Dean intends to fix that over the next few days. Most of the interior is finished. Dean wants to find some replacement seats, but the ones already in it will do for now. There's a few other details on the inside and the exterior needs painted. Besides that, they're almost done.
“What?”
Dean just nods. Castiel is a big boy. If he wants to stay and help out Bobby and the gang, Dean can’t argue with that. From the looks of things, they’re going to need all the help they can get. Besides, it's not like he has much of a choice in the matter. Sam comes to stand next to him.
Dean tilts his head toward Castiel, keeping his eyes opened as he goes. Their lips are almost touching when the fallen angel twists his wrist just right, stopping Dean in his tracks. Eyes wide, Dean exhales Castiel’s name into the fallen angel’s still open mouth, both of them breathing the same air as they exchange moans and disjointed utterances of each others names. Dean’s eyes only close when he comes. Castiel’s lips graze his cheek, his cool breath sweeping across Dean’s temple as he strokes him through the aftermath. Castiel is up and out of the bed a minute or two later, Dean still trying to catch his breath. He watches the fallen angel.
Dean isn’t wrong. Everything has always had a place in Castiel's space. Right now, however, his room is the very definition of disorder. The entire contents of Castiel’s closet is strung across the room. His dresser is empty, some of the drawers left half way open. Small mounds of clothes lie scattered throughout the room, all of them reminiscent of the piles of raked leaves in people yards during the autumn months. Books are piled into unsteady stacks next to their shelves, some of them having already toppled over.
“That’s not true.”
“Why?” Dean asks through gritted teeth.
Castiel is already conscious when the brothers make it back to Dean’s room. He’s trying to stand, but strong hands push him back down onto the bed.
Cas leans towards him, invading his personal space just like his Castiel does, “Oh yeah? Well I’m still me, so it looks like you’re doing a bang up job so far.”
“How do you figure?”
“Then stop acting like one.”
“Okay, what’s wrong with you?”
“My name is Castiel, and this is Dean Winchester,” Castiel says.
“Oh trust me,” Dean grins slightly, “he wasn’t lying.”
Castiel visibly shrinks as Dean turns away, walking off through the tall grass to who knows where. Sam watches his brother until he disappears, grateful that he is getting himself out of range for his blow up or melt down or whatever the hell Dean is going through right now. Either way, it will minimize the collateral damage, though one look at Castiel tells Sam it's too late for that. The fallen angel walks past him without a word, disappearing into the Bunker. Sam follows after him with a sigh.
Castiel turns towards him, a cobalt blue button up shirt in his hands, “Fine. I was looking for something, but I didn’t find it.”
He resurfaces, head completely drenched and without an apple to show for his trouble. The lady dressed as a gypsy who is working the booth offers him a towel. Dean declines, not wanting to mess up his zombie makeup anymore than the water already has. Turning, he sees Castiel’s lips twitch as the angel tries not to grin. He may not be willing to wipe his face, but Dean’s more than happy to shake some of the water out of his short hair. If some of that happens to hit Castiel, then that’s cool too.
Anna smirks at him, “Good luck, brother.”
When he finally makes it to the fifteenth window away from his, he taps on the glass pane and waits. He had counted the number of rooms between his and Rufus' when they'd been sent to their respective quarters. When he doesn’t get an answer, Bobby taps harder. He keeps tapping, pausing a few seconds after each round. He shifts, trying to find the most stable position he can, though he suspects there isn’t one when you’re playing Spiderman without the luxury of any actual powers. Flannel had always looked better on him than red and blue spandex anyways.
“Dean, you just said -”
“Cass,” Dean moans, fingers tightening in his hair as Castiel sucks along the base, “Cass, please.”
“Streaking,” Castiel replies, grinning at Dean.
“Bitch.”
Metatron backs away, blade held high, “My death isn't going to help you.”
“What do you do then?”
“No, I don’t,” Dean says, sighing as he leans against one of the stainless steel counters.
The man looks flustered, eyes flicking down to where his hands clasp the handle of the black briefcase. He finds Dean’s eyes again after a pause, lips twitching in an almost smile.
“He found some omens?”
“We’ve got problems,” Kevin says, as he bounds down the Bunker’s stairs, Crowley following after.
“Wait awhile before you leave and let the dynamic duo know what’s going on.”
“You know,” Sam said, grinning at them in a way only drunk Sam can, “This is about the time the frat parties would start to get crazy.”
“I missed you,” Dean says, unable to hold Castiel’s gaze as he says it.
“What?”
“What happened?”
Castiel glares at Dean before looking back to Jack, “You use your lantern to draw unlucky, traveling souls off the safe road to their death.”
“I know.”
“Well,” Dean says, smiling, “I guess we should get you back there, huh?”
“Why?”
“I said, drop them.”
Sam swallows before continuing, “You know what that’s like too, don’t you?”
Dean starts to say something extraordinarily sappy as he stares at Castiel. He can feel the eyes of all his friends and family watching them as Sam mumbles stuff to Jack, oblivious to Dean and Castiel. He’s probably immune to this sort of thing by now. Castiel is still staring at him, but he’s starting to pull away. Dean grabs him, pulling him back by the lapels of his leather coat, their lips crashing together.
