John looked around. "I'm sorry", he said before standing up and aiming to walk away. "This was probably too much. I'm sorry."
He stood in front of Sherlock’s seat while the greaser
Sherlock didn't want to answer, but he felt bad for the girl, he knew it was taking her a lot of effort to pull through the conversation. He kept expressionless. "Sherlock Holmes." He muttered.
"It's 7 p.m, Sebastian, the party ended twelve hours ago."
Mike chuckled, and John felt his anger raising, what was so funny about it? "What are you laughing of?"
“You know”, John continued as he started painting the iris of his eye, “Autumn Orange is not actually called Autumn Orange”, he said distractedly.
"Not so much, so far. Dimmock asked for anything in the record about the couple. The woman was a writer and his husband was a businessman. Apparently they moved from a big city, because they lost most of their money when the stocks went down. She reported she had gotten threats about five months ago, but then she didn't mention them again. The police investigated them, but this happens all the time so it wasn't taken into account. The rare thing about it is, if she was the one who got the death threat, why did her husband take the worst of it?"
and they walked in.
Jim sat up straight, his expression turning more serious. "You brought him to us, Sherlock. So why did
your division, Lestrade?" Sherlock said with far more sarcasm than he intended too.
John knocked on the door. "Sherlock are you okay?"
And all of that happened, and he still felt empty.
”, Sherlock clarified.
he wanted to say.
Now Sherlock and John were alone in the room. The weird silence stretched. John looked down at his hands and started clenching and unclenching the fist of his left hand.
"You're right. It was never going to work."
"As I was saying, I considered the idea that- if you would call that an idea, it's more like an addition, you know, like complementing the idea per se and-"
John turned to look at Sherlock. "No, no, no... I mean, it's weird, you are incredibly smart..." Sherlock smiled "but you should have gotten graduated a year or two ago."
John so much. But it was for their sake. Next thing he felt was Irene's hand holding his, tenderly. He took his eyes off John, who didn't seem to realize yet that they were in the hallway, because he was too far away. She took Sherlock by his jacket collar and leaned him closer to her face.
“I can’t”, John whispered.
"It means they forget a certain experience or a person."
Sherlock sighed. "Fine."
------
John smiled back. "I wouldn't be so sure about that."
Eleanor Thorpe.
John laughed and nodded. Sherlock opened his eyes and stared at John. They simply looked at each other silently, none of them even daring to move.
A small folder was placed over the table in front of the sofa. Sherlock stopped and stared at it. He remembered Mycroft's text. It was obviously some boring file about someone or the archive about a murder because Mycroft thought he could solve anything with bribes.
Harry chuckled as she cleaned the remnants of her tears.
Sherlock stared at the painting for another while, detailing the heavy brushstrokes surrounding the landscape, as if they were a statement, as if this John Watson needed to scream something he couldn't say aloud.
care. I'm tired and I'm fucking drunk so I'm out. Now leave me alone and don't ever,
Sherlock smiled weakly at him, feeling relief spreading all over his body.
They stood still in a slightly uncomfortable silence. Sherlock didn’t want to look at John because he was probably blushing from embarrassment and John was looking at his own painting while doing a weird expression Sherlock couldn’t put a name to. Finally, John broke the silence. “You haven’t answered my question.”
“Please”, John replied, holding the smile.
As soon as he sat, he heard a girl's voice behind him. "Hello, John!"
John kept his eyes fixed on the pad but didn’t make any move to actually show the pad to Sherlock.
Orange Autumn?
"Are you ever going to let that go?"
Sherlock stood still, mouth agape, before he realized that a reply was expected from him. He blinked and closed his mouth. “I- just…”
She sighed. "I'm sorry, Dr. Hawthorne." She turned to look at Sherlock. "...Sorry, Mr. Holmes."
Sherlock was reluctant to let go, but he knew that he had to, at some point. He moved his forehead slightly and John understood immediately, for he loosened his hold. Sherlock looked up and John smiled softly at him, placing one of his hands on his cheek.
They went inside John's car while the boy frowned. What the hell was wrong with Sherlock?
"So don't ever,
"How did you expect me to just sit there, looking at her like that? I had to do something."
"Fine." She said without believing one of the words her brother just said. "Just be careful, alright? I told you, those greasers are not that nice."
That was what he was thinking about until he saw that greaser passing by. Predictably, he took his lunch tray and sat right next to Jim, Sebastian and Greg, who were laughing like idiots. John always hated them, but never paid any attention to them, that until this Holmes arrived, now he despised both the boy and the group. He stood looking at them, thinking about how angry he was.
John's mother opened the door just a bit so she could see who was there, as soon as she saw her soon she said: "John!", she opened the door wider and looked at Sherlock, then looked down as fast as she could.
Unconsciously, Sherlock’s hand started moving on its own as it closed over John’s cock. Up and down. Up and down.
He turned.
Sherlock let out a smirk. "Good. I'll see you later John, you still have lots of things to learn about rock n' roll."
He did lots of ‘studies’ -he would call them studies instead of sketches or drawings, it sounded more professional that way- on Wednesday, thinking about different types of human shapes
"So... Sorry."
He arrived home and Mrs Hudson received him with a hug. She offered him some food but he said he didn't want to eat. Which was nothing unusual. He rolled his eyes and went directly to his room. Mycroft wasn't home yet. He laid on the bed, looking at the ceiling and listening to Think it over by Buddy Holly. He sighed and thought it over.
I can only hope he believes in John Watson.
he wanted to say.
"What is your connection with Sherlock Holmes?" He said seriously.
"You don't know who she is?" Greg said surprised.
Sherlock leaned against the headboard and stood over the covers, looking at John intently, who wouldn't take his eyes off him. Finally John broke the spell and moved the covers a bit, as he moved aside as well. "Come here", was all he said.
"What?"
"I don't need you to worry about me! I don't need anyone to worry about me, alright? Anyone!"
"Good. You're unattached. Just like me."
, John thought.
The door opened, just a tiny bit.
"I wouldn't like that." Sherlock said shaking his head.
He moved forward and examined John’s eye closely.
"The one who follows the rules?"
"No she wasn't." John sounded very convinced.
And he missed him instructing him and whispering to his ear and the feel of his lips against his earlobe and-
Hi lovelies...here's a tiny ray of hope to make these shitty days slightly better. I'm sorry for everything we've been through. I can assure you that this little one will have an unambiguously happy ending, I'll try to avoid poor shitty writing ('no loose ends on my watch and I do mean that!), it won't have weak, forced, cruel 'I love you' scenes, and John and Sherlock will end up together, without the ghost of wives past. I know this can't fill into the void all this shit has left in our hearts but it's a start. I love you all and I'm endlessly thankful for your support. You guys are incredible and have motivated me to keep on after all the shit we've had to handle. Take care and never give up on hope, ever.
He sat watching the girl, Geanette (?), twirl around with her lanky partner, looking for all the world like she belonged in the school.
"A monarchy then."
"That explains a lot. He always seems really close to you. And I know that last year he punched Kirk in the face for you. He seems sweet, and John's friend Jack speaks highly of him."
"Hey, JJ," he offered, but her lie-name did nothing but make her shudder.
"What language are you using? That is neither ASL or BSL," Loki whispered to Gean.
As a general rule, Bruce Banner was a pacifist. No hitting or pain, because he had a horrid temper. But when someone you barely know punches your best friend, it's hard not to react. He was two days late in talking to Tony about it, after gathering information about the whole deal from Chekov, JJ's known Russian buddy.
"Then go to the dorm kitchen and see if someone will pity you. Now. Shut. Up."
/That would be your dad, I believe./
Thor Odinson was not an easy person to intimidate. But the thought of having to listen to his father this Family Visitation weekend scared him. Not that he would admit it. Ever.
Sherlock wandered into the band room soon after so that he could begin tuning before the idiots caused a ruckus. From his position on first violin, he could overhear the hushed whispers from the percussion section that was Dean and JJ.
"Trust me, he's telling the truth," the boyfriend grumbled. "I speak from experience."
"Other people?" Tony offered.
"WHAT?"
"Thor. Loki," Odin addressed his sons as one would buisness aquaintance.
"No? So you would rather I divulge my insurance?" Jim was smirking, the right evil bastard.
"No!" He didn't know to whom Gabe was referring, his ex or his unattainable crush, but he really wasn't in the mood to discuss either.
At one in the morning, the festivities formally ended. Everyone had left at near midnight, citing various reasons. Now, only Loki and Gean were left to return to the dorms together. Their laughter echoed through the halls. They were an odd sight, of course. Tall, lanky Loki with shirt wrinkled by so much movement next to Geanette's definitely feminine and bright red figure with hair falling out and down and heels dangling from one hand and other placed in the crook of Loki's arm. Anyone would have thought they were a couple.
He knew from upperclassman that this class that chemistry got really bloody difficult, but right now they were beginning with a simple flame test. He and his partner worked sufficiently with pleasant conversation, but during the course of the lab, he kept feeling his eyes drift over to Sherlock and Maxine, a partnership with an interesting development.
"But I want food!"
/That'd be all right, too/ Tony thought.
Cas swatted at her. "I need you to-"
Loki all but scampered over to the counter, pulled out two glasses and poured the drinks, and Tony found himself staring at the tight skinny-jeans and the place where the boy’s shirt rose and left some near-white exposed skin. He shot his eyes away as Loki returned to the table with the beverages. The last thing he needed was to embarrass this newfound friend with unwelcome advances.
So John did.
---------
John stared at him, knitting his eyebrows together. He shook his head. "No, no."
He was almost convinced that Hawthorne was the one who'd made the murders, now all he needed was to find why he was doing it. They started inspecting the house. Hawthorne was divorced, bad relationship with his ex-wife, a daughter that she barely let him see, and Sherlock could tell that his record of casual encounters was quite extensive. They searched everywhere, and aside from the frankly alarming quantity of drugs he stole from Lacuna and sold to pharmacies, he couldn't find anything remotely incriminating.
“I wanted to get some lunch”, Sherlock lied.
Sherlock lifted his arms. "Well, it helps to pass the time."
Sherlock read it all, his mouth half opened.
"Her ex-fiancé!", Sherlock repeated. "Melissa told us, she always said horrible things about him. Look for him Lestrade, it must be somewhere in your record before you filed her murder as a cold case".
********
"I have to meet with Sherlock in order to work in our project." John said with a resigned face, which earned a chuckle from Mike.
Damn it. Painful.
“Oh, I think we both know that was absolutely fake.”
How much time did he spend thinking about all those things?
Yellow was the colour of Van Gogh's stars. Yellow was also the colour of life. Or so John told himself.
Hey guys! I just posted a
Because John had said it, it would be in his own time.
"John, I-"
It became too much. The air around them felt heavy and unnecessary.
He never changed the station, actually.
"Then what are you?" John said turning to look at Sherlock. "What do you and I know you are to me, according to you?"
John leaned his head against his chest and sleep claimed them both.
"Sugar?" The woman behind the counter asked and John turned back, changing his frown for that silly little smile.
The brushes were filled with dust and his palette needed a change but it didn’t matter right now. As soon as he opened the yellow paint the smell invaded his senses.
"No! You can't just do that!" Melissa waved her hands in the air desperately. "
“A dream that involved
to see John. Finally he nodded, "just, promise me that you'll let me know as soon as the files arrive."
"Yes, yes, you have a lot to catch up with your friends."
But then the truth came crushing him: John Watson was strong enough to defeat Sherlock's demons. Sherlock Holmes wasn't.
talking like this, but he was desperate.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock took his pjs and took off his coat and his scarf before going to the bathroom to get changed.
Except he knew the pain was because of him and there was nothing he could do about it.
Sherlock was so unaware it was almost impossible for John to believe he actually didn't have the slightest idea. He didn't realize, he didn't feel, he didn't know. "Oh, alright then, my room is a bit messed up since Mycroft's slaves revolved it entirely but you can use the bed..."
"SHHHH!" Molly said, widening her eyes. "You don't tell boys that sort of things! It was supposed to be a secret!"
John shrugged and kept drinking his tea in silence.
Their mouths opened. John placed a hand on the back of his neck, the other tangling in his curls and pulling slightly. And Sherlock
"Shhh-", John said, before licking a line along Sherlock's cock. Sherlock cried out.
Chemistry club passed incredibly slowly, and John couldn't help but think about Sherlock
"See anyone interesting?" He said relaxing a bit now.
John looked down.
Sherlock sighed, broke apart and rolled his eyes. "Fine. Take me home then."
"Are you guys okay?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He didn't feel like talking, he actually never did, but Sebastian and Greg were also looking at him expectantly and as he exhaled the smoke, he started talking.
He'd already lost him once and he couldn't remember the weight of his loss, but he could
"How?" Lestrade stood in there, his mouth still forming a huge 'O', still not believing what his eyes were telling him.
John counted seven gunshots. It was far too impressive for him, there was blood and bruises everywhere. He turned and left the basement, trying to hold back his tears. He stopped on the hall, not trusting his legs to go back upstairs.
"Well, You, me, and...Sherlock?" He said turning to look at the detective.
“Goodnight, Sherlock.”
"Taking her home."
?", she asked opening her eyes and pointing at Sherlock.
“Shhh”, he said softly with a smile.
When they arrived to the car, Sherlock threw another glance at John, standing, about to open the door, but not quite. "Are you sure?"
Sherlock smiled softly at the note.
“It doesn’t have to.”
... Tired."
John rubbed the back of his head, “erm- can I come in? It’s just- it’s a little bit cold in here”, he said, rubbing his hands together.
No. No.
She hit John on the forehead with the butt of the gun. John screamed in pain. “Really?”, she said once again, seemingly undisturbed by John’s distress.
"Stop implying...whatever it is you're implying." Sherlock said trying to keep his pride but then he realized it came out more like a beg.
"Shhh..." Sherlock murmured. "Go to sleep, John."
“Yes. I have them all, from 9B to 9H.”
The next thing that woke him up was the constant and hateful
Oh. Sherlock had just finished. Sherlock was looking at him as John stared at his arm.
He sighed, blinked, and felt as if he was finally seeing clearly.
He was under surveillance constantly. Mycroft had seen him like this before: the tremors the sweating the paranoid thoughts the scratching the dissociation the terrible moods. He was used to all of that.
Sherlock thought he heard Lestrade murmuring 'about bloody time' but he couldn't quite tell.
John knew History wasn't going to make things better, but he somehow held the hope maybe they were forced to do another work in pairs, or discuss the project, so he could spend some time with Sherlock, even though now they pretended they never even knew each other. But he had more important things to worry about: Physics. How was he supposed to get an scholarship now? He had lost a subject. This was unacceptable. This was all Sherlock's fault. Everything was Sherlock's fault.
------------
John nodded, encouragingly, expectantly. “Hello, John”, Sherlock said, clearing his throat.
"What?" He said with a sigh.
"Happy Birthday", was all John said as he stood in front of Sherlock, a smile in his face.
And John had shown his interest on him ever since he came back. At first, Sherlock had been unable to draw to conclusions but the truth was there, and looking back at it, it looked pretty obvious now. Had John felt something for Sherlock before? It seemed impossible but-
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’ve told you how I see the human body, it is merely a musical composition, an artistic piece to be admired. Whenever a human body appears in my brain it’s like when there’s a song you’re caught up on and whose lyrics and melody you can’t let go.”
“How long?”, John asked, his voice just as low.
And he couldn’t even do that properly.
"Hello, sir." John said sighing as soon as he saw Hikes sitting in the desk, checking the papers they had delivered during the class. The project.
"Care to elaborate?"
Well, apparently that demonstrated which part he had chosen to pay attention to.
“I ruined it all, John. All of it.”
He was walking somewhere and then there was light and a mask of oxygen being placed on Sherlock's face and oh god there was an oxygen mask on Sherlock's face and he was inside an ambulance and he stumbled.
John’s lips twitched in a small smile. “Alright, then. It was great seeing you, Melissa.”
"What? She is back? That's so stupid Mycroft! How could you possibly know?"
If Sherlock held any hope by now, it vanished completely when he heard John's words. That was something John Watson would probably tell him if he was absolutely angry at him, the thing was, the old John wouldn't say it with such coldness, avoiding his gaze. He bit his lip and looked down.
"JOHN!"
Sherlock shook his head, making sure that John could feel the movement of his jaw on top of his head. "It wasn't your fault, John. I'd never blame you for this, ever."
“She implied he was in love with me. He didn’t say no. I was there. I heard it all.”
"It's Greg!" Lestrade said exasperated.
Sherlock swallowed. Fortunately, in his quick glance at the article, he could see the words "suicide" or "fall" weren't there. "-I... the killer died."
"Anything else?"
“Took you long enough, Sherlock. I waited and waited. So many clues I thought I was being far too obvious”, she shrugged, “I guess that’s just what love does to you.”
John didn’t reply.
“Okay, but do you have any artist who’s influenced you, somehow?”, John asked, smiling slightly at this impossible man.
------------------------
"I don't like rock n' roll." John said shaking his head, still looking at Sherlock, this time right into his eyes.
John Watson was standing in the door.
But it seemed like he left that at Afghanistan as well, just like the rest of his life.
-------------------------
She closed her eyes. "I don't know."
"I don't want to take a seat!" Sherlock said raising his voice. It came out sharper than he intended.
John walked closer to Sherlock, he spoke lowly, “look at the colors, so full of saturation, of green, of
John’s hold tightened.
He couldn’t have gotten this one wrong.
Three, four.
"Don't", was all John replied, taking deep breaths and doing his best to try to calm down, his hands were shaking, why were they shaking. "Please, Sherlock, don't say anything."
He had no idea who Clara was, not that it mattered. He was going anyway.
John smiled at him. “You think so?”
"It wasn't easy. I was away for two years."
John frowned, looking at them as they left, he was confused, how was he supposed to know where they would be meeting? He didn't know Sherlock Holmes at all. Then how could he figure it out? He really didn't have the slightest idea of what to make out of it. He decided it was better to wait for lunch to find it out.
And the voice sounded loud and clear, above it all: "Sherlock, it's okay."
“JOHN!”
John nodded. "To you. On school."
"No, nothing to apologize. It's true. All of it. You will always be the greaser and I am just... John."
-------
One day he realized he had no clue what to make a painting of, there was not a single idea in his mind, the colors had lost their vibrancy and the existence felt somehow heavier, as some kind of burden.
A horrible solution, but it was either that or… No. He tossed that thought away as well. He wasn’t a coward.
Hello, I'm back. Well, sort of. You'll understand later.
"This dinner was lovely..." Sherlock said after
"I believe it does, yes."
"John", Greg said, trying to calm him down.
Sherlock stood silent for a moment and, without looking up, his eyes fixed on that book again, he said in a very very low voice which came almost like a whisper: "...What about chemistry?"
Sherlock looked at him. “Really. Why?”
“You’d be too if you read the blog! I actually wrote Mr. Holmes once, by the time Mitchie got lost, remember? I claimed him if he could help me find my cat. He never replied though, I guess it makes sense, he had murders to take care of, but I had to give it a try, didn’t I?”
it wasn't going to happen again, and Sherlock had Irene (though John suspected he didn't love her) and they just... It couldn't happen ever.
The thought hit Sherlock like a rock and he couldn't help but grimace a little at John's unawareness.
Lestrade threw her a fake, weak smile and nodded. “Alright”.
"Harry, you ready?"
John’s jaw dropped open. “I’m sorry, what?”
Sherlock sat up and chased his lips again.
Hawthorne smiled. “I’m a bit curious about the blog, though.”
You can always come and talk to me in my
It was magical.
That was the only word that came to his mind.
She looked around the flat. She definitely didn’t expect it to look so… boring either. She assumed that even after his best friend’s -
Sherlock felt his eyes drifting closed by the intensity of all of it. He gasped. "John...", he rumbled.
Sherlock frowned. "John who?"
John tried to wipe off his tears. But they kept rolling down. "Hm...hm..." He couldn't calm himself enough to talk about it. He breathed for a moment, gathered as much courage as possible, and turned to look at Sherlock. "We had a fight." And his voice was breaking again. "It's just...they expect so much from me and I'm nothing, I'm no one, I'm useless... I just...." He cried again.
"Now, now, don't be like that. You know you like me."
It was nice being a trustworthy wallflower sometimes. You got to see everything in people.
The next day, they were walking across campus, Geanette dolled up once again. Today was going to be /fun/. "Why are men so incredibly intrigued with the female kind," she said walking with her hands on her hips to prepare for the events of the day-- her power stance.
For now, though, it was time to put his plan into action.
"How do you keep yourself from feeling anything? Because evidently I suck at it." It was obvious that he was referring to the earlier incident and clearly was embarrassed despite the fact that it wasn't his fault.
River nodded. "Yes. I have noticed that. It makes me wonder what his gift is." At Fury's School, no one got in without having a talent of some sort. River's was adaptability, just like all three Smith brothers were certifiable geniuses. Rory's, she knew, was durability, his girlfriend's being cleverness. JJ's talent was a mystery to all of his classmates.
"Aww, you're no fun, Myc. Besides, it's free period now. Just a quickie?"
"You're like a middle school girl, oh my gosh!" He was laughing, unable to stop himself. "Tony and Loki sitting in a tre-"
"I think he was coming on to me!"
River nodded, that seemed reasonable, though there was likely something more. "Now, why don't you tell me more about this fabulous music taste of yours. You can sing if you feel comfortable/
/Yeah, he has this thing where he latches on to people. It's hard to get out after that. Not that I'd want to, but still, JJ is a protector by nature./
Sherlock did not see the point in a foreign language class. He and his arse of a brother had been raised on three languages and, seeing as his sociopathic tendencies prevented people from interacting with him, he doubted he would even need the English language. But the class was mandatory and he couldn't wait to show Mycroft up in French.
Loki simply rolled his eyes. How did the kid put up with this?
"Are you?"
"I think I know the word."
"But we can't be too terrible with it. The Winchester brothers still need their dad. We just need to prove that Dean would be better off here, preferably with digital proof."
"Hello, Dean."
"Sorry," John smiled shyly. "What have you got first hour?"
"I assure you, I am not."
"You say that father," Thor jumped in to the defense of his brother, who was currently sullenly staring at the ground, "But he has made a good number of friends."
"Yeah, well he and his brothers are going out to eat tonight, and Kirk is God knows where, so it looks like we're on our own. Can't you get it?"
Greg looped his pointer fingers into Mycroft's belt loops, pulling him in closer.
“Well there’s,” he spoke hesitantly, “I do have one, I could always get a hold of Felipe and he'd help in any way he could, I’m sure, but  I don’t understand what you are thinking, JJ, can you elaborate? Your plans are usually quite immaculate and I need to know my role in helping Dean."
Sherlock's deductive state was broken now, for Cas was a wall when it came to deductions. He saw only what everyone saw, that he was shy and awkward and dependent on Winchester and a bunch of other obvious things regarding the boy's life. However, he also saw that Cas was sad, something no one else seemed to realize, which seemed very obvious to him.
John gave a small cough to alert the others to their presence.
Her parents were overseas and didn't have close ties with her, so she stayed back in the dorm for dinner, conceding to the fact that she would be fending for herself. As much as she'd like outside opinions, and as much as she would like to help Lokes with his family, it had been a long day and couldn't be done. She needed silence right now, and a noisy, crowded room was not her ideal. She was just going to relax, change into some baggy nightclothes, and read for the rest of the night. She had been really been meaning to finish Fault in Our Stars since she had thrown it against the wall a few days ago.
"Hey, dude, you lookin for someone?"
Tony was tempted to roll off the bed like he did at home, before he remembered how high up he was, then slowly meandered down the ladder.
The situation was now desperate. If Cas and Dean had a similar bond, then she had to save him. If only there was some way to-
John tuned out. Sherlock was in this class? Of course he would be. He loves Chemistry! Oh well great Watson, now you have to deal with watching Sherlock work. At least you have the cover of watching out for Maxy......
"Of course, silly, I could tell from the moment I saw you that you were a girl. Like, crossdressing, been there, done that."
"You have a very nice voice, has JJ told you that?"
/Two years or so/ she signed in the shorthand she and Maxy had learned last year for secret conversations.
"Dean Winchester punched you?"
"He might have been."
Halfway through class, she presented her findings and conclusions. At the same time, Sherlock Holmes reached the same conclusion, his evidence smacking against Maxy's on the top of the desk.
Sherlock barely stopped, though his mind was racing a mile a minute. Could it be that simple? How could he have missed that?
Mycroft, seemingly not in the mood to deal with it, leaned over to Sherlock, saying "Get creative, brother dear, you've known that one since you were four."
"Shhhhhh"
"Nothing much," Geanette said with a smile that, were Tony not totally enthralled with Loki, he would have found hot. "He told me that under that tough, working exterior is a caring guy."
"Sorry for Jack," John told Loki, "He takes getting used to."
Gregory Lestrade- Senior
"Oi, you didn't complain last year when he-"
It was the middle of the night when Gean woke up suddenly to muffled crying from below. As frustrated as she was at the situation, she couldn't just leave Loki in a time of need. Flipping off her top bunk, she crouched next to his bed. "Yo, Lokes, what's the problem?
"Shut up. I thought we were discussing how you completely pulled an Anderson."
Loki and JJ followed his sight to two boys talking in hushed tones. One, the one John was staring at, was obscenely tall with curly black hair. Not bad looking, Loki noted.
Thor was surprised when he didn't flinch, but moved closer to Loki.
"No! I mean, I accept, but that information stays secret."
She pulled off her dress shirt and bindings to change, throwing the dark materials to the ground haphazaradly.
"It's his aura was just... Ugh, I'm sorry I'm being such a dick, Stark, it's just been a bad night."
"But of course! Bishop's thrilled he finally has an oboe player!"
Sherlock merely smirked at him, "Comment dit on 'piss off Mycroft' en français, mon frère."
"Oh Gabriel," Jim sighed in mock affection,  "I would never think of doing such a thing."
"Because you let someone walk off with the full knowledge of your secret and ability to share it still in tact."
"Hey guys...." John's voice wandered off as he maneuvered his head around JJ.
Though it wasn't like he could focus anyway. Now, he walked across campus in a daze, trying hard to push it all down so that no one got suspicious. He heard people call his name and could barely manage his usual cocksure wave. He wished school could just be over so he wouldn't have to worry about the trouble that came with it now. It was worth it though, all the trouble they went through to keep it hidden, for the filthy whispers, gentle touches, passion-filled kisses, and the knowledge that the man had chosen after so many years of nothing to give him a chance, and stayed. Shit, was he ever in deep.
JJ was silent when the director, Peter Bishop, called the class to attention. Silent when he asked if anyone knew where their first trumpet, Tony Stark was. Silent despite all the begging looks Dean gave him over their equipment.
Loki froze as his not-brother tripped over chairs to reach him.
"No, sir. Just a single ruler."
To be honest, he didn’t even know how he managed to survive the rigor of this school, considering he had pretty much cheated his way in. Smart rich kids gave him much more of a challenge in his scamming business (for the ones he didn’t like), people to be friends with because many of them needed it just as much as him (for the ones he did like), and to ogle at well-dressed attractive beasts (which was pretty much everyone). So he stared a bit and flirted some more and struggled his way through supremely advanced classes. But it was pretty worth it, especially with the number of foreign exchange kids this boarding school attracted. England, Russia, and Spain from what he’d seen so far. Of all people though, sitting next to the youngest Novak during his worst class was not ideal. Even though he was far too serious, at least Cas got his work done and was easy to cheat off (even though Jack didn’t pass this class last year, so maybe he was getting screwed over Hence why he was here again this year). Gabe, however, tried to cheat off of him. So now he was actually going to have to learn instead of gazing at the fine specimens in his class, even if most of them were freshman. Even mini-Novak wasn’t too bad. But no. Now he was actually expected to learn algebra.
Feeling that introductions were in order , Geanette stepped forward, "Well, I'm Gean, this is Loki, and 'Maxie', that's Maxy."
She nearly bowled over the mid-sized Smith, John, in her hurry. She shouted some sort of apology but kept running. Those brightly colored pants came into view.
"Let's see how the asshole takes it when his hair products prevent him from takin' it up the ass."
"I figuerd out how to save Deano!" Gean grabbed her best friend around the middle and swung her around, laughing. "Cassie, baby, you and Deanie-o are from the same hometown, right?"
"I'm going to do it this year. I'm going to graduate. Then no one can stop us."
"Yes, yes I think I will be. This hellish weekend just has to end, and I think I'll be alright."
Cas takes deep, healing breaths, rebuilding his walls of ignorance. It takes about fifteen minutes. He thinks of the people who will request his immediate prescence: JJ and Dean, Mr. Bishop, the other flute players, and Gabe. Gabe needs his big brother, not the silent bordering-on-hysterical brother Cas is being now.
"Oh, this is a good one," the dark-haired boy in his company declared. He placed the iPod on the table as the music began, and then held out his hand to Tony like a proper gentleman. By the time the lyrics started they were close and Tony could barely breathe because those green eyes were setting him ablaze and Loki had his arm around him and was grinning with rebellion.
The next day, he was once again walking to breakfast with Sherlock when Loki came running up to him, bright-eyed and grinning. “Hey, do you want to come sit with us, Tony? Sherlock can too. I already asked JJ and them and they said it's okay.” He saw Sherlock’s terrified expression, and yet he couldn’t bring himself to care.
"Go grab your horn, Gabriel. We have class to attend," Cas states, standing and retrieving his own instrument, the lithe flute. Gabe sprints out of the dorm, eliciting a shout from someone as he does so. Cas reaches the door as Gabe runs into the huge bulking mass that is Thor Odinson yet again.
"I haven't seen him, I think he's back in the dorms still, they're over there. It's still pretty early." Gean told him.
Gean looked at Cas in his trench coat over her shoulder. "Well...... he was gay."
Cas shoots out an arm and grabs onto Gabe, preventing him from leaving. "No," his voice is little more than a hoarse breath.
Oh shitshitshitshit. Yep, its official. He's dead.
"Maxy, I won't let him get away with that."
"Ah yes, incentive. Do you mean that," Mycroft paused, then bent down and whispered harshly in his ear, "that it will no longer be unacceptable for me to fuck you?"
"Later. There's a faculty meeting and it will be noticed if I'm missing."
John Watson- Sophomore
"Boring! Mini-Novak actually expects me to have the answers. Crazy, right?" Jack waved his arms around energetically. He and JJ had reached the cafeteria and were headed to their designated table.
"I've struck a nerve, haven't I..."
/Great. It's nice to see you female again, Gean. How long was it?/
"And so am I!"
"Oi, Smith!" Matt turned to face Gean. "When you get a chance, let your brothers know I need Harkness."
"Still you!" Bruce yelled back as he turned the tide of the fight, flipping them over.
"One headed by a single ruler."
"Y'know, I'd probably laugh if I wasn't so pissed off at you. You act like at least it was for the greater good, but let me tell you something, the last thing that boy wanted was a scene and you caused one. At least when Stark upset him, he didn't know what he was doing."
He, James Kirk, had just gotten rejected. No one rejected him (except that one mute but he blamed JJ for that one). He was Jim freaking Kirk!
Speaking of which, Thor spotted that one boy that roomed with Loki, JJ Harrison, running toward them.
Bruce took that as his cue to leave, and headed back to his room. If he was lucky, Greg was still at Rugby parctice and Rory was making out wih his girlfriend (Bruce hoped he hadn't snuck her in, that would be a bit not good). Whatever higher being ruled things around here was on his side tonight and it was just him, a certified copy of Stephen Hawking's papers and the occasional sound of the Smith brothers talking loudly and excitedly about the space-time continuum and time travel. Amateurs.
"HEY! You said you got rid of those." Jack protested from the background.
"How many times, Cassie-baby? It's Cry. Like the action. Who's your friend?" Cry tried to view around Cas's head to see Gean.
Loki didn't even raise an eyebrow while JJ threw all of Jack's hair products in the rubbish bin.
"He seemed pretty surprised when I said it, I dunno," Greg poured at the abrupt pause. They had so little time for any of this, he didn't want it wasting away like this.
I thought we agreed to not do this whole romance thing, he thought to himself. And thus he was in a trance for the rest of class.
He understood that JJ would have prejudiced her against him, but he thought she'd at least act interested! No, instead he'd gotten shoved off with little more than an insult thrown his way. It was unprecedented.
Geanette Harrison- Sophomore
"I'll try," he whispered, "At least now you know that earlier did absolutely nothing for me."
Jim grinned menacingly. So this is what it felt like, a deal with the devil.
"Empathy, what an annoying human characteristic. I think you should be far more worried about the statistical likelihood that JJ is going to murder you."
"Oh yes, this is JJ's brother, Geanette, I've been showing her around campus while her brother's off being a twat or something." He twirled her around again and they both laughed.
"You know it, Harrison."
"You got any friends back home, Novak?"
/A promise for a promise/ she thought.
Tony's face fell a little. "Yeah, no big deal, its over."
"Hello, Sherlock," Castiel Novak slid in beside him. This had most likely been planned by his brother. What to do for seating arrangements? How about putting the two most socially uncomfortable people in the world right next to each other and make them speak in a foreign language.
"What?" Loki asked, confused. "Families go here? But this is a gifted school, right?"
/Two innocent kids in a victimless crime/
"It's fine...I swear, I'll be fine, I'm not angry with you." the boy said with a quiet voice, pulling away quickly, running to class with his instrument case in tow.
/Don't be stupid, John. That's too mundane for Sherlock./ Oh great, now he even knew what Sherlock considered mundane. That wasn't weird, right? They were sort of friends. Right?
"Language, Monsieur Novak."
Gabe does not look the least bit sorry, but apologizes anyway. He sticks himself to Cas's side as they exit the hallway. Cas shrugs his shoulders at Thor in a "what can I do?" manner, mouthing "Little brothers" before turning around.
"You're going to ruffle my hair, aren't you?"
"What's up," Loki pivoted away from their mom and rushed past Thor to his friend.
"BROTHER!!!"
"I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE IN THIS CLASS AS WELL. I SEE YOU HAVE MET DEAN FROM PRECALCULUS." Thor enveloped the skinny boy with arms as thick as the shool-issued mattresses.
"Dean punched Tony Stark two days ago and faces expulsion," Cas explained fluidly.
He performed the act, them straightened his bowtie and walked back to his brothers, and Geanette trudged back to her dorm.
The older man rolled his eyes, but allowed Greg to pull him. "You said that last year, Gregory."
"I'm surprised at you, Geanette."
"Nothing important," he responded gruffly, "He thinks that his brother Castiel and I are involved in some secret love affair. That's just how Gabriel's mind works."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Wait, what? This is about Deanie?" Cry's eyes went very wide. "Cas, you should have said something! I'll get right on it!"
He drew the strings of the backpack tighter, looking up at the behemoth that would soon encompass himself. It served no point to change to a private school for high school, but his family had insisted. This would be just like anywhere else...he would either be ignored or harassed by the entire population. He stared at the ground, kept putting one foot in front of the other, praying that no one would notice him. The method worked well, none of the peppy members of the population were approaching him. He could go through the next four years without having anyone pay him any heed just fine. He would be the small, frail, ugly nerdy kid like always, the one that no one acknowledges. Loki smoothed back his hair, as he simultaneously acknowledged that this was fine for avoiding people...but he had no clue where he was going.
Loki looked up momentarily from his book but returned with no questions.
The kid had gone back to the dorm and returned pale as the moon the night before, but now he looked fully ready to cause some mischief. Dean involuntarily shuddered.
There were very few things that could scare Dean Winchester. First off, his best friend's little brother holding hands with the sleaziest slime ball to ever open his mouth... and two, Loki Odinson smirking.
"Would you shut up," Tony gave him a playful shove, "And this doesn't leave this room, okay? I'm don't want him to know right now, I don't even know if he goes that way."
Loki flinched at the use of his last name.
River's eyebrows creased momentarily. Did her roommate and Matt's brother's friend's friend have something going on? She had seen the two act very close before, but never thought anything of it. "I know I shouldn't ask, and don't be afraid to tell me to go away, but are you and him together? Not that it's any of my business, but it's just the way you two act."
Gean froze. She hadn't thought of that. And Cry was going to see Cas and Dean. "No," she whispered and took of sprinting towards the dorms. If Cas found out, she would be over. He would tell Gabe, who would end up telling Fury to save his own ass. That couldn't happen.
John raised an eyebrow and shook his head.
"Though your murder would make for a rather dull case. I'd rather have something interesting...like my brother."
He ran down to their dorm, where Dean was sitting in the main room looking defeated, throwing a baseball up at the ceiling over and over. He looked over at Cas, eyes widening marginally, "Hello, smiley..."
"Barely." /That/ must not been seen by others who does this little freshman think he is?
/I guess you could say that/ Gean agreed, laughing.
Cry saluted Gean. "Aye aye sir. I'm on it," he called to the off-screen as he logged off, "MAAAAAXIE!"
Cry gave a nod. "Rightio, what can Cry Caldero do for you?"
"Fuck you, Harkness!" A small hand flipped Jack off, but Loki still couldn't see the rest of the body.
Tony nodded back at him, feeling tongue-tied for his first time in forever. This was just the beginning of something good, and he would have to watch what he said, because he knew from experience that there would be consequences to the wrong words.
"I already told you it's not like that, you little prankster, would you knock it off."
"JJ, darling," he said with mocking affection, "you know I need room for my products." Jack yipped as one of the bottles of said products nearly struck him in the face.
The Killers- Battle Born. How terribly accurate.
She quickly lunged to the side and yanked on her pajama shirt. "H-hey, Lokes." Her cover was blown. Shitshitshitshitshit, no, this was bad. No one was supposed to know and she had just blatantly blown her cover.
"Castiel Novak. Would you please tell your brother and his boyfriend to leave me alone?" Spock had somehow migrated over to the group, followed by his asshole buddy Kirk. Dean knew his fair share of douches, but that guy took the pie.
/That is a long, long, long story/
"I just don't understand," the swollen-eyed boy told her, "Why do you even want me around? I shouldn't even exist."
Loki looked up, his face teary as JJ slammed into him with full force. "JJ? Dean? Jack?" He looked as confused as possible.
Tony watched as Loki and some dark-haired girl danced around to the horrible-quality music her phone was playing. Tony had earlier admitted that she was pretty enough, but Loki never looked better.
"Well, I'd better hide my things before he dips them in acid." Tony chuckled, and started to the bedroom, "I need to leave time to get ready for dinner."
Loki rushed to a seat on the other side of John, across the room from Thor and. He barely recognized Sherlock from earlier on John's other side regarding him with an appreciative look.
"No, he wasn't."
"I won't say anything. It's not a big deal to me really, it's just who you are. And since you're the first person I told, I would appreciate if..."
/I usually don't, but its psychological. I'm a selective mute. For the longest time, only JJ has ever heard me. When I'm listening to the music, that's pretty much the only time I ever say anything./ River was honored that she was deemed worthy of such private information.
Step two...... what was step two? Flirt? Seduce her? Something of that nature. He would worry about that when he got to it. He was only decent at plans anyway.
"So, Thor, how have your studies been going," Odin questioned stoically.
I crash was heard within the bathroom, and the stick-like figure of another boy appeared. "Watson?"
"If you must know, he's with his brother, mother, and asshole father for a family meal and a Coulson monologue."
"Family problems?" JJ inquired. If only he knew.
He was sooooo fucked.
She silently paced over to the counter. If Dean were here, she could at least get some of the pent up energy out, but it a seemed that wasn't going to happen. She set about microwaving some brown rice, blatantly ignoring Tony.
/Thank you./ Maxy's blush had been reduced to a pinkish flush of her skin.
“I really wish Dean would stop it,” Castiel whispered, kicking at the ground with the tip of his shoe, long coat trailing behind him. “Does he not understand the consequences he faces?” He stared down, attempting to hide his face from the rest of the group. Gean understood that Castiel was scared, and it was occurring to her how very attached the boy was to Dean Winchester. Before Gean had come to the Fury School, long before she had made shy freshman her problem, something had happened between those two, and Dean Winchester had saved Castiel, had become his protector. They had a bond so powerful that Geanette could barely comprehend it. And now, that was all being laid bare, because the protective instinct might be taking Dean back to a place where he was the one in danger. Both of the boys would be left without their personal protector, because in some way Gean couldn’t explain, it seemed as if Castiel had saved Dean too.
He felt the hand thrown off, a scowl shot at him, "I wasn't talking to you." Of course on the other side was the new addition that had become stitched on to Loki, Tony Stark of all people. He didn't pretend to understand what was going on between Loki and his friends. He wasn't allowed close enough to know anything like that. All he knew was that the two had become quickly attached to one another.
"En Français," Mycroft Holmes told the group as he approached them, eyes fixated on Sherlock.
"Sherlock is doing god-only-knows in the bedroom, Smith is galavanting off with his brothers, and who ever knows where Kirk is. What's up?"
Thor knew that Tony had a reputation. He didn't trust him. At all. He'd always gotten a certain attitude from Stark that put him on edge. Hopefully, he could manage this year, seeing how close the two were getting.
"I know, can you cut you it out, you're rather loud, and I'm processing multiple complex things"
Right or wrong, Cas was home.
"I'm older than you!"
"Not the best choice of words," he could hear the dark-haired younger Holmes saying.
Forensics class was always something Maxy looked forward to. It mixed her favorite things: science, cleverness, and winning. Usually she was the one who won by solving the case first, and the professor, Ms. Farnsworth, always loved her and her quirky eagerness. Gean had walked into her business class already and Maxy was about to turn into forensics when someone tapped her on the shoulder. Before going on the offensive, she turned to see who it was. She was surprised to find it was the younger Winchester.
"Hey!" Loki jolted his head up as someone spoke and tapped him on the shoulder. He looked up to see two boys a snarky looking besuited boy was taking him in, as if he was figuring out Loki's whole life story (dear God he hoped not, no one ever needed to know that). The other was a friendly looking blonde boy, who grinned openly at him, and was the one who'd addressed him. "You looked lost and shy. I'm John and this is Jim...If you want, I can get you to your room. And y'know, you seemed in need of a friend or two."
"I can be a real ass about it, I know, Watson, I know. Don't try to guilt me with your accent."
"NO!" he pointedly turned away and began tuning the timpani.
"Well, you do. And you have very good taste in music as well."
It seemed only plausible, given the fact that all the impossibilities were happening. For example, he was still attending school, which must be a forthcoming sign of the apocalypse. He assumed they were keeping him around to fight off the end-of-days monsters.
"I can't believe you told Kirk off. Did you see Dean's face?"
Maxy and Cas jumped next to her. /What?/
Deanie looked towards hem and flinched. "How many times JJ, its Dean. Not Deanie, or Dean Bean, or anything but Dean."
/JJ's talent, in my experience, is rescue. He finds the ones who needs saving and saves them./ Maxy told her earnestly, thoughtfully.
"Loki, there is no valid reason for anyone to hate you. He's just an idiot, okay?"
"I know, Myc," and he reached and pressed his rough fingers to Mycroft's cheek.
"What?"
"Thanks, genius," JJ told him as he, Jack, Dean, and surprisingly Gabriel, took off in the direction of the station.
Loki nodded and followed John down a narrower hallway, with 8 doors, four on each side. They stopped outside the one with a silver metal 1 on it. Jim continued on without a word. Shooting the younger boy a grin, John opened the door, "Home, sweet-"
"I can live with small reliefs. Y'know about that..."
Jack rolled his eyes at the mini-Novak. "Ask John, im not a math wizz." Truthfully, he was. He had finished the pre-test 5 minutes ago and was trying hard not to watch the movements of this year's hottie,  er.... exchange student.
John's eyes darted down to his name to check his partner, then up for JJ's. He had Bruce Banner, science genius,  and JJ had Rory Williams, of decent intelligence. Another quick glance to JJ confirmed that he was angry.
~~~~~~~
"/Really?/" Gabe quirked an eyebrow at his roommate.
"I didn't have support, John. I know you might think I'm a badass of badassery but I used to be...... teased. No one stood up for me. Not even my family, John. Now do you see?"
"You do realize you will have to be Geanette once more, right?"
"Of course it isn't a problem, he seems like a cool kid." JJ replied easily.
"Wait, Odinson? That sounds familiar. Do you have a brother or something."
Cleaned off an hour and a half later, Gean was complaining, yet again.
"So you propose a dictatorship?"
Dean dropped his baseball on the next throw, and it bounced somewhere out of view. "You........ what?"
"Speak for yourself, Geanette, I don't quite understand that sensation."
Loki's ears turned red, but John said nothing. He would not say a word, and certainly not about a certain lanky asshole genius. Not a word.
"That would be them, thank you!" He started to run off.
"He found out this summer that, in accordance to his moving away, he was adopted to this family because no one else would take him, likely there was a love affair overseas, and that he should feel lucky he wasn't dead, his fathers words, no love lost there.   Feeling powerless and useless, he tries to sever all ties but upon seeing someone who is not truly family yet acts as if they are makes him feel even more rejected and useless, so in conclusion, you said secrets deserve to be hidden and it sounded like you were brushing away his pain as pointless because of your bloody daddy issues. Not to mention he fancies you."
Now Thor had reached his limit, "And you wonder why he doesn't feel a part of this family anymore, father, it's because of you." He then, surprising himself, stormed off.
The girl giggled silently, /Everybody always thinks that, but we aren't. He's my friend, and he's pretty much family to me, certainly more so than my real family. We're close and have a deep platonic love for one another that makes us have a really close and personal friendship going beyond expectations. There isn't any type of romance involved, but this is high school. Everyone wants to think everyone has this mad sexual longing for one another, but JJ and I just aren't going to deliver on that./
She pressed her lips against his in an apology before moving to kiss his neck. "I'll be careful."
Mycroft sighed in exasperation. "But you don’t understand the pain of it… the horror!"
John smoothed down the front of Sherlock's jacket with a satisfied grin. "Well, looks like it's time for us to go out now."
"It's an expir-ma-ment." He pouted, squirming from Sherlock's grasp.
Mrs. Hudson was delighted. "Oh! Spring wedding!"
They both went silent as John's phone started ringing from across the room.
John nodded, turning bright red and twisting his ring around his finger. "Yes. I'm sorry. I guess I didn't know I was doing that." He cleared his throat and dipped his head to stare at the floor again. "So, you're going to marry her."
Tom smiled warmly. "It’s really nice to meet you all." He looked down at John, eyes widening just a little before holding out his hand. "Hi there."
Mrs. Hudson sighed, stepping towards Sherlock slowly and rubbing his back. “Dear, you can’t get rid of me that easily. You have been living here for years and I know how to deal with your little outbursts, even when I act as if I don’t. Now tell me, what happened?”
Sherlock turned in her arms to face her, hands trailing up her body and coming to rest on her cheeks gently as he pecked her lips. "Hello my beautiful Mångata."
Sherlock’s mouth fell open. “You can't keep working! It’s dangerous. The whole reason I left the position was so you would be safe from all of that.”
Sherlock looked towards John as the doctor walked towards the window. "Ready John?"
Sherlock frowned. Had John just dumbed something down for him? Like he was a child? He wasn't sure, but that was the part that frustrated him. "What do you think John. I'm dating her and it is quite obvious that I don't often find people interesting enough to listen to, much less willingly spend time with."
"He never consented."
John nodded, watching her slide out of the room with her white dress trailing behind her before quickly making his way to the front doors where Sherlock would arrive. John refused to admit to anyone that he passed that he was running down the halls. Stopping right before turning the corner, he peeked out to see Sherlock walk through the front door, holding it for a toddler and teenager to pass through before letting it shut.
. All he could see was John coming for him and suddenly he was twelve again, being held down on the ground by his wrists and ankles by kids much older than him, fists and feet pummeling him mercilessly. The hurtful words being flung at him and carved into his back with pocket knives. Emotionless. Monster. Worthless. Faggot. Machine.
John.
John and Sherlock laughed out of genuine relief when they heard the footsteps and walkie talkie chatter outside of the carriage, bomb disposal finally arriving just in time. They had made quick work of the bomb, letting Sherlock release the wires he held so that he could wrap his arms around John who was practically crying out of happiness. There were people swarming around the carriage for a while before Sherlock could take his army doctor and escape from the madness, but at the first chance, be grabbed John's hand and sprinted away down the tracks and into the abandoned train station where Lestrade tried to stop them. He ended up chasing them both through the tunnels and through Westminster station, but Sherlock knew the city better above the ground and effectively lost the detective in the first few minutes, perfectly avoiding the question from the police and the complaints of paperwork from Lestrade. The two of them ran all the way back to Baker Street, slamming the door behind them and falling down onto the stairs panting and laughing until Mrs. Hudson came around and shooed them away with a broom and the promise of biscuits. After something as traumatic as holding onto a bomb that was about to explode, the two of them just sat in their respective chairs, watching each other breathe with small smiles.
"She's also pregnant."
John smiled a bit before grabbing Sherlock's coat and pulling it from the hook. "You know, I always found it interesting that you can recognize someone just by the sound of their footsteps."
Sherlock shrugged. "I would have thought Mary told you."
John pressed his lips together, chuckling. “What does
Sherlock grinned brightly. "It was amazing John. I finally felt free as I fell, completely brilliant. It was as if I had just solved the case of the century, finally figuring it out after a lifetime of questions." He took a large breath, leaning forward as if to fall off the building again. "The feeling of hitting the pavement is fantastic John, just pure pleasure."
John nodded. "Yes. Of course. Dinner. That's… wonderful." Sherlock could hear from John's voice that it was the exact opposite of wonderful.
Sherlock shrugged. "Er, beauty is a construct based entirely on childhood impressions, influences and role models."
"MY." Right collarbone.
John looked over at Mary, worried. "Could that be…?"
Over the phone drifted Mycroft’s voice, his tone desperate. "Sherlock, please. I beg of you. You can take over at the interval."
John looked at the ground, ashamed. He should know better than to assume things just because he had been lied to for years and was
Sherlock shrugged a little. "Weddings are… not really my thing." He looked uncomfortably down to the road below the window. "I tend to end up being blamed for ruining them." He looked across the room at her when he noticed the awkward silence he had caused. She smiled sadly as the door opened.
He shrugged, swallowing dryly before turning away from her and hiding under his arms. "Common signs. Increased appetite, change in taste perception, morning sickness."
There was pain everywhere. His whole body hurt, listening to the sirens in the distance. There was a voice speaking right behind him.
Fontaine's eyes fluttered a bit as he stared up at Sherlock in fear. He was gasping, tears in his eyes, and he coughed wetly and blood leaked from his mouth. "Dad. Please."
Mr. Chatterjee, the shop keeper.
Sherlock tried to choke out words, but he failed, just tapping his chest lightly with a few fingers and coming away with blood. "Fuck." Slowly, he lowered himself to sit on the floor of the shower aided by Janine who turned off the water and grabbed a towel.
John chuckled at the sight of the smile on Sherlock's face. "Oh, you’re enjoying this."
of someone." She sighed, pressing her fingers to her temples and rubbing lightly. "I think you better tell me what happened. And no sugar coating."
“Okay.”
"Go answer it."
"John. Just ask him. If you don't do it soon, you might never build up the courage."
John nodded, a heavy feeling settling in the pit of his stomach when he looked at the pain hidden in Sherlock's eyes. He turned away to escape from the look, but turning away made his chest hurt. Ignoring it, John walked over to the door, opening it and letting Sherlock pass through before following close behind, cheeks burning from guilt.
Sherlock reached to gently stroke John's cheek, guiding his face back up to look into his eyes. "John Watson, you keep me right."
. What's wrong now?"
The vicar. A child. An old woman.
Sherlock smiled softly, hugging Andi lightly and stepping inside when she offered. "Thank you Andi. I promise not to be too much trouble for you two to handle." He smiled, looking past her and trying to see past the sitting room and down the hall to where the bunk rooms were held. "Hey, is Fontaine awake?"
"I can't go to jail Molly! Please don't call him! Please!" Sherlock covered his head with his arms, pressing down just a bit too hard and pulling at his hair. All he could do was draw himself in closer, trying to make himself as small as possible.
Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.
John chuckled again. "Noooo silly."
John reached for his glass, but didn't pick it up. "Er, no, they don’t. You tend to rub ’em up the wrong way."
Sherlock was grinning unashamed when John placed a delicate kiss on his lips and pulled him to his feet before tipping him onto the bed and letting the door swing shut. John smiled, enraptured by the sight of Sherlock under him, and pressed their foreheads together gently just like the night in the bomb carriage. "Hey."
"Someone with an old, soft spoken soul." Sherlock looked discreetly over to John as he sipped his tea quietly, the gears turning in his brain so obviously that Sherlock could practically hear them.
"Get off! You cock!" The camera man punched him across the face, but Sherlock ignored each blow.
. It signifies complexity and delicateness.
The camera man aimed at his real target, pointing and pulling the trigger with fury.
John huffed heavily, falling onto the couch with a glare because there was nowhere else. "Where did my chair go?" He stared at the empty space in the flat, frowning at the floor.
Sherlock groaned, letting his forehead drop to his knees and covered his head with his hands. "I'm sorry. This sounds really bad and I know what you're probably thinking, but we were both really dr-"
Sparing a quick glance back to the ledge sadly, John picked up his phone and tapped a few buttons as he glared at the man sitting by his jacket. "You're a bloody prat. You know that right? I would have thought that you of all people would have tried to stop me or something." He silently scolded himself for not ignoring the phone or at least turning it off so he wouldn't get phone calls. Looking at the time, quickly, 1:39 am, he pressed a button and the phone gave off a high pitched beep and the messages played.
“Don’t go into my room.”
John nodded, still hooked on the look he couldn't quite put his finger on that Sherlock had in his eyes. "I guess it is. What could go wrong at this point?"
Sherlock turned his eyes towards John, who grinned back at him expectantly until finally Sherlock held out his hand to Tom, shaking it coldly. Glancing quickly down at Molly, Sherlock walked in between the couple and out of the door. Tom turned to watch him go for a moment before glancing back to John. Greg handed Molly a glass of champagne kindly as John started to follow Sherlock, but stopped briefly to take another look at Tom, who was staring at him with a strange look in his eye.
? Well the answer is definitely YES with Tom." Sherlock popped back out the door, shutting it behind him and waiting a few seconds for Molly to understand. John was silent for those few seconds, no noise coming from the flat. Then, a loud slap was heard from inside, causing both John and Sherlock to wince as Molly stomped towards the door and threw it open.
She sneered viciously at him, eyes narrowing dangerously as the dim light reflected off of her lip ring. "You call me that again Schezza and I'll stab you just like the last time you did. And besides, that deal got cut off when you made me read about your death in the papers over two and a half years ago and hadn't come to me after you got yourself to London. You absolute fucking cock!"
John nodded a bit. "Yes, you’re human." He put his glass down on the floor, slumping back in his seat.
The answer to that question was
David, Mary's ex boyfriend.
Sherlock took a long breath, holding it for a few seconds while he closed his eyes, gathering his thoughts. He had to calm down, he had to think clearly. What did he know about what happened? They were both drunk and the only reason he remembered anything was because of his Mind Palace, so John would most likely not recall anything from the night before. That was… good to a degree. If John didn't remember, then he could set something up that was believable so that John would never have to find out about any of it. John would never know. If he could just lie about what happened good enough, then nothing would change and Sherlock would be able to keep his best friend. He looked down at the floor, determined to lie so well that there would be nothing to question. Sherlock needed to lie so well that he could trick
Sherlock glanced over at John curiously. "When was that?"
angry about it. "No. I haven't been able to find the right time."
Fiddling with his ring, John looked down to the ground, shrugging again while avoiding eye contact. “Well, you never used to agree to go to… dinner.”
"You and Janine."
John scratched the back of his head, shrugging lightly. ‘Me and Mary. Having dinner with… wine and… sitting.”
John walked across the room, pressing the answer button and holding it up to his ear. "Hello?"
"I've already told you. No."
"Yup."
“Yeah.”
He smiled, about to open his mouth when the door swung open forcefully to reveal a tall woman with a messy ponytail down her back and a square jaw. "Where have you been? It has been over half of the night you have been gone for and the children have school tomorrow!" She frowned at Lucky who stood there smiling all sappy, her blush at the thick Russian accent an obvious sign of how smitten she was.
"Hey there. Shh. You're fine." She gingerly dried him off as he sat and gathered himself to stand again. She kept her hand pressed against the bleeding scab that broke open while drying his face. "Don't worry. It's just blood loss. It will pass when you eat something."
"Can we see Mommy later?"
Molly pushed herself away from the door, taking a few steps forward and crossing her arms. "What are you trying to say Sherlock?" She sounded worried, a little scared.
Sherlock turned slightly red, moving to the other side of the room to grab the suit hanging up. "Fine. Just… don't look."
Sherlock shot him a judging look of disbelief, pointing to the laptop he had in his hand. “Seriously? I’ve just told you that the Western world is run from this house and you want to talk about
Bang. Bang.
"So, a husband, boyfriend?"
Sherlock laughed a little, passing John to finish counting his steps. “Of course. You’re my partner. Who else would it be?”
Too much pain.
Burning fabric. Burning room. Desperate John. Screaming Mary.
Mycroft paused for a while, the only sign he didn't hand up in the lack of a dial tone. "He liked the quote."
Sherlock grinned widely and stepped closer to John who looked back down at the fall that called to him, taking his hand lightly and intertwining their fingers. "Never. The thrill is unparalleled."
John shot up in his seat. “Um, yeah. Yeah, sure. I’ll definitely do it. Yes.” He paused, licking his lips. “What was the question?”
They both snicker and John leaned on the armrest if his chair. "Funny! That was funny!"
John shrugged. "I’d say so."
John smiled a bit more, standing quietly in the wind for a few moments before he finally spread his arms. "Unparalleled." The taste of the word was funny on his tongue and he chuckled lightly as Sherlock let go of his hand and stepped off the edge of the building, laughing the whole way down until he hit the pavement and looked up at John with his dead eyes, calling for him with a lightning smile. "Unparalleled thrill." John felt the word on his tongue one again, rolling it around before he tilted himself forward and felt his feet slip away from the edge. The edge of the brick gently brushed the bottom of his feet as he fell forward, dropping his phone back onto the roof as someone slammed through the door, shouting his name in a familiar voice. He felt the air on his skin as he started the descent, his knees buckling and tipping him to the side as his chest passed the ledge, then his shoulders and neck.
Lestrade grunted in disbelief and John heard a ding on the other end of the phone alerting Lestrade to a text message that the man inhaled sharply at. "Yeah, sure thing John. Stay right there, we're coming to pick you up so just don't move a muscle. Seriously, I mean it John, don't move from the spot you're standing in right now. Don't move."
Sherlock flopped back into his seat, scrunching up his nose in thought. "Errr… am I human?"
Molly looked back and forth between the two of them, confused but still smiling. "Law school? Chicago? Sherlock?" She spent a few moments just staring before accepting that she had accidentally become a third wheel. "I have to go to sort some things out. Bye." She slipped down the stairs silently, looking back up briefly with a knowing smile.
Yellow Acacia. This pretty flower signifies the value of true friendship and can indicate a
, so it is an opportune flower for after a particularly nasty break up.
John shuffled nervously, leaning against the wall by the fireplace and thinking a bit before speaking, drinking a cup of tea he had made for himself. "Mångata? Quiescent? What is all that?"
Lucky scowled for a bit. "How long you be needin?"
"Care to elaborate on that?"
Mary chuckled a bit. "Yeah. Well, we are lucky that we actually got engaged."
Sherlock walked away and slipped into a dark alley, maneuvering through the bad parts of London that Mycroft couldn't possibly track him through so that he didn't have to deal with his older brother's stalking problem. When he reached an alleyway filled with old acquaintances from when he was high on drugs, he moved to sit in a dingy old corner and wait. It didn't take too long for a woman to slide up next to him with hands in her hoodie pockets. Her long red hair was braided in pigtails and there was black eyeshadow smeared on her eyelids to cover up the fact that there was a dark bruise under one of her caramel colored eyes.
Time stopped. Greg body slammed the cameraman to the floor and Sherlock fell to his knees in a daze, slowly crawling over to the bleeding boy. "Fontaine?"
"John?" He whipped around to face Mary as she opened the door to the room he was standing in. "Are you okay?"
John grinned back, biting his lip. "Come on. Vegetable?"
Sherlock blushed a nice color of red, leaning forward and propping his chin on his hands. "Do people usually like me?"
John was pacing back and forth, having accidentally crumpled the note clutched in his hand long ago. He was working a hole into the floor, his nice dress shoes making a dull thump against the wooden boards as he waited, breathing heavily in a small panic. "Come on. Come on. Where are you?"
John nodded before gently rubbing Molly's back as she started shaking again. "Yeah. A bit not good."
She smiled, ushering him through the door with his suitcase and grabbing Lucky's hand softly. "Not right now, but he would kill me if I didn't wake him up to see you." Sherlock grinned, looking outside one last time at the sign hanging on the fence before closing the door and walking quickly after the couple.
John didn't say a word. He allowed Sherlock to do this, had asked Sherlock to do it. He bit his lip and closed his eyes. As he moved his hand up and down, setting the pace, Sherlock could feel the small sobs still coming from John's body, combined with pleasure and pain and sadness and need and he just wanted to make everything better, to kiss away all the wrongs he had done so far when it came to John.
Sherlock walked towards his violin and picked it up, turning his back towards Lestrade. "Do as you please, Detective Inspector." He said coldly.
He opened his eyes.
"Well...goodbye." Sherlock said opening the door. Mrs Hudson came out and gave him a huge hug. Sherlock felt a bit embarrased while Irene just laughed.
“You believe me?”, Sherlock asked, hopefully.
Sebastian gave a loud laughter looking at John. "Oh, Holmes, you better hurry. Your boyfriend is waiting for you."
send him to detention! I had to go to detention too!"
John nodded and pouted, unable to say anything else, the words were flying in the air.
It looked like such an empty place to live. There was nothing. Nothing that could bring inspiration, no colors, no light, only shadows, only dark. Try as he might, Sherlock found nothing in there that could bring John Watson back to life.
“You haven’t changed the pencil! Go back to 4H!”
Sherlock sat on the chair in front of the sofa and stared at John, who simply cleared his throat and said... "well?"
"No, seriously, what are we going to do?"
"I have proofs that show it otherwise."
Sherlock sighed and shook his head. "What is wrong with us, John?"
"You and I work
John shook his head. "Nothing. You're right. There's nothing weird about it. Just bringing a friend. Sure."
"Then I suppose you would be perfectly fine if I ask him out once again."
He didn't shut up.
Sherlock
As he took a cab back home, he took his phone out and started typing a text for John, because he really needed to see him as soon as possible.
Sherlock moaned against his lips, “John”, he whispered.
"That if I can turn the radio on, Watson."
"Then I will not continue to make such mistake. Are you coming or not?" Sherlock said turning his back to John and getting inside the house.
But one day he got bored.
the thousand
Sherlock offered Irene to sit in the chair in front of his bed. He sat down across from her. "So, what did you need to talk about?"
Sherlock.
Sherlock closed his eyes. John thought Sherlock was second guessing this. No. He had to reassure him. He cupped John's face with his hands and kissed him.
Sherlock dragged a deep, shaky breath. “She- she- she said- I DON’T KNOW! STOP THIS! STOP HURTING HIM! JUST-”
Sherlock looked away and cleared his throat, “so erm- have you- brought your homework?”
"Why?"
But now it was time to start the counter again.
She smiled widely. "Hello, Sherlock. Lovely to see you here." She winked at him.
Sherlock actually shivered as he felt John’s breath in his neck.
------------------------------
About twenty minutes had passed since the Woman had left when somebody knocked on the door downstairs. Sherlock ignored it, as usual, because he was thinking. A louder knock. He didn't answer. Then, he heard in surprise as the door was forcefully knocked open. Two men wearing black suits went upstairs, armed. They started looking all over the apartment.
“I- I wasn’t attempting against my own life.”
"WHAT? You backed out? Oh John! You blew your chance little boy! Ugh! I knew this would happen! I shouldn't have left early! I should have waited until you both were covered beneath the sheets and lock you up and hide the key somewhere you could never find it again! John, why did you do that?"
Sherlock flinched and looked down, then let out a sigh as if he was going to talk about something painful. "Oh. My car. I miss my rocket. I miss it so bad. It was my birthday present. 16th birthday. And no more no less than a Cadillac! ElDorado, 1954. Beautiful. It was completely useless after the accident. My parents sold it as junk. That, of all things about that accident, is what hurts me the most, that I lost my companion."
John stood silent, still in shock, still feeling Sherlock's breath in his ear. Then the greaser pulled himself apart and
He sighed. "Fine. I hear you."
written on it and recognized the writing: Sherlock. His heart started beating fast and he felt a little nervous. His hands were sweating and he thought about how absurd it was to feel so anxious about something as stupid as a note, but it wasn't just a note, it was a note from Sherlock. He unfolded it and saw the message:
He pulled John by the arm, John turned to look at him, surprised.
When he was staring at a dead body laying on the ground. When he was seeing said body being pulled into a gurney, being pulled away from him, feeling all his breath leaving him.
The detective inspector stared at John, startled. John remembered perfectly what the case had been about, yet he had said it had been Greg who found them and not Sherlock. What the hell was going on with John?
"Hmmm.... I really don't believe you." John said shaking his head, smiling and sitting in front of him.
Sherlock looked at him fixedly, a focused look on his face. “What’s charcoal for?”, he asked.
"Where is he by the way?"
"Yeah, are you?"
"Sherlock...", he gasped as soon as Sherlock began to press open-mouthed kisses against his neck.
“I was a different person”, Sherlock replied and it was true.
“Something. I don’t know.”
"I would be if you'd allow me to talk".
"I read his blog! But he hasn't updated in over a year. I thought he had gone traveling or something, you know, after the detective died."
They heard someone entering and coming up the stairs.
"Listen to me." Sherlock said looking at John.
I wish I could tell you more but... spoilers!
meeting your father!"
"Oh, alright then. Sleep tight sweetheart."
"So, you're going?"
"Well yes, you can cut paper with those." John said relaxing his face a bit.
That kind of aesthetic pleasantness, that masterful use of the shapes and the shadows, and the dark and the bright and the perfect portrayal of something as imperfect as the human body. It was impossible.
Sherlock sighed. "Well... those are the facts."
"But seriously John, aside from that, nothing happened?"
No, not that.
Sherlock smiled back. “John, hello.”
He stood silent as John turned to leave.
But he had things to do and he had to get himself off cloud nine.
Sherlock remained oblivious as he stared out the window.
Yet Sherlock had promised him he would leave him alone as soon as they had this conversation, this conversation that they didn't even get to finish.
Sherlock came down running, absentmindedly fixing his shirt.
"So, he doesn't remember me?" She asked awe-strucked as Sherlock finished.
"I don't. Care to fill me in?" Mycroft said raising his eyebrow.
“The drugs. I stopped them.”
Lestrade grabbed him by the arm and stopped him with a "SHERLOCK!"
John shook his head. What the hell was he doing in a newspaper alongside that maniac addict? Something was wrong. Something was very, very wrong. He had only seen that man twice in his life and now there were pictures of them together on the papers?
"Oh you may be a very good actor but I didn't believe a single one of the words you just said!"
