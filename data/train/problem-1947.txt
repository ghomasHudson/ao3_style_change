“What did he mean, John?” Sherlock asked more firmly. He had his arms crossed over his chest – an unusual pose for him and definitely one John didn't like on him.
John sat there for a moment and thought. It had gone rather well, he thought; not perfect, but better than imagined. With a sigh of what was to come, he stood and went to talk to his wife.
Sherlock agreed to seeing him each day towards sunset. For weeks they sat and talked, leaning into each other as they watched the sun reach for the water on the horizon. Sherlock would often feel down his tail. Though the touch was one of intrigue, a curiosity, John couldn't help feel affection being sent through him in ripples. He, in return, watched Sherlock's legs move with great fascination. His joints were very delicate, providing fine movements where John's fin was stiff in comparison, not to mention the lacking ability to move individual limbs.
“No, I just left my wife and child in hopes of one day shagging my best friend, nothing wrong with that at all.” John reprised in an exasperated sarcastic tone. Though he knew it shouldn't, the remark made Sherlock flinch with disappointment and a certain fear. John threw him a quick look, then shook his head in resignation. “No, no, Sherlock, I didn't mean it that way. I'm sorry, that was awful.”
“My disinterest in sexual activities is by no means to influence your habits of masturbation, John. Just make sure there is nothing left in the shower when you're done.” Answered Sherlock reasuringly and with just a tiny bit of a sassy tone to it.
After engaging in the very basics of kissing, pressing their lips together and messaging each other lightly, Sherlock dove straight for the only other thing he knew, something he'd seen on TV many times. Fortunately, John had lead his tongue away from his tonsils and back into his own mouth, closing his with a fond smile and took it all the steps back down to where they were still exploring.
For all the times he'd mocked, insulted and disappointed John, he was now rewarded with more acceptance, respect and understanding than he knew he could ever give back. What was John even gaining from this, except sexual frustration. He probably even thought Sherlock ungrateful as he never once had said 'thank you' for going at this slow pace. He was useless to John. A friendship that now bound him more than it is supposed to as a relationship of that status.
What did couples do? Where there differences in how a relationship works according to who was committed to it? Or was it all the same cheesy activities and dialogues? If not, what did John like in a relationship? He was always romantic towards his girlfriends, yes, but what would he be like with Sherlock? Did he expect Sherlock to be romantic back at him? Had he even ever been in a relationship without sex? What if he missed it to much and started cheating on Sherlock or left him!
“Is that so? I had not noticed.” Naturally, this was a lie. I cannot claim to speak the truth if I said to have ever held the slightest interest in a woman romantically. When I observe her body, it was ever purely for practical reasons, such as deducing her affairs or assessing an abusive man in her life. Saying it like that, however, did not seem a wise thing to do to me at the time, so I made few adjustments. “However, it is not and has never been in my interest to see a body in light of its aesthetics. My observations are driven by intention, and that is to see through and solve crime.”
“No.”
Coming back to find John relatively happy with Mary and being serious about their relationship had been something of a slap in the face for him. In all the time Sherlock had spent growing more and more attached to John and taking memories of him to hold on to sanity, John himself had moved away and replaced him. Sherlock wanted him to be happy, but he felt betrayed nonetheless. It had been all the more surprising when John had approached him just as he had finally accepted that he wouldn't get what he really wanted. Maybe it had taken so long because it just wasn't 'meant to be'. With the trouble that was currently on, maybe it would have been best to not engage in this. They could still stop and go back, make it all right, but Sherlock had to admit that he was much too selfish to let John go again. He would make this work, whatever the cost. He was sick of always ending up alone.
John would often move his fingers through the wild curls on Sherlock's head, intrigued by the way he got stuck in the dry knots. The human found that part less pleasing and complained about the pain. He'd long given up running a hand through John's short hair; there was little fun in doing so when it was wet and when it was dry it just stood up in odd angles, looking silly. He briefly wondered how John cut his hair.
Every time John asked, she just fussed around more, nervously, almost snappily, insisting that she was alright. So he stopped asking.
“There was hardly a chance to have made it any worse for me.”
The shrill scream had both Sherlock and John wake up with a head-start, jumping out of the bed and running into the living room to look what had happened to make Hamish shriek like that. Fortunately, as soon as they arrived and Hamish had met their worried looks with one of his curious stares, the clever eyes light up with joy as his mouth squished his chubby cheeks upwards in a very toothy grin, his angelic voice gifting them with his bright laughter as he trampled, pointing at the presents beneath the Christmas tree. They both let out deep breaths, sighing, John grinning at the whole scene while Sherlock just rolled his eyes at the overzealous display of excitement by their son and would later deny even the physical ability of having smiled.
Sherlock gave an offended groan and John kissed his ear with a grin. “Rude.” he rumbled against the other, but there was not bite in his voice.
“You are a captain?” he asked softly. He put his elbows on the wooden plank and rested his ching in his palms. “I have never talked to a captain before. You are quite young!”
John looked at him in wonder. “You're quite the cuddler.” he remarked with a fond smile.
“Should I put a new bandage on it or leave it open?”
Maybe it was the wine, but both of them slept fantastically in their own beds that night.
Hanging his head with a breath bursting out of him, he stood once more, climbing up the rocks into the city. He recognised it the minute his boots touched stone. He was back in London.
Dark clouds covered the sun and the water turned black around them. “A curse!” someone cried as the waves began to grow. They toyed with his ship, throwing them like a stick from one hand to the other. The sky growled at them and he ordered his men to seek shelter as the first light struck the water. Two men he lost that night, going overboard before they could flee. Good men they were, and loyal, but there wasn't a thing to be done. They set course once more to get home to London.
“Don't lose my hat, okay?” he pleaded Sherlock, who nodded his head hastily. “I'm John, by the way and you can be my friend!”
“And you think you denying me this will keep me on the land? Confined to a city that holds nothing but tedium? One day I may retire, but I don't fear not living til such a time.”
“Answer me.” The detective's voice left no room for rejection.
“I don't see you left alone and struggling with your emotions!”
Sherlock, oblivious as ever, offered a nonchalant “you're welcome” hand waving dismissively. John sneezed suddenly and Sherlock looked at him a little startled. “Getting ill, doctor?”
As John walked back towards the living, Sherlock stayed on his heel, protesting. “This is
John tilted his head a little, frowning as he contemplated this. “Okay.. Fine, I guess.”
He let go of his shirt and took hesitant steps towards the leather couch. Usually, he would flop down onto it in a big sulk, but he was painfully aware of his wound in that moment.
“Yes, it was.” Sherlock said honestly, fighting his emotions down. He knew John had a way with words. Just not a very good way. Especially when he was angry at himself. “I think you should take some time to calm down. We can discuss this situation if you want, but only if you are thinking reasonably.”
At dinner, the younger man cast him a few short looks that John couldn't really name. He looked a bit guilty, as if seeking forgiveness, but for what? What would Sherlock feel sorry for? John didn't know.
Sherlock twisted his hand, entwining his fingers with John's. “We could just keep seeing each other like this. I could tell you of my adventures.” he trailed off.
“Just answer me, please.”
Sherlock merely nodded, still stunned. John vanished with a gentle 'good night' and Sherlock's eyes wandered over to where their teas sat next to each other, Sherlock's mug cleaned with water, John's entirely untouched.
“It's hardly my field of expertise, John. I rather thought you would like to take on that task, especially since you are all about doing things the 'child-friendly' way.”Sherlock said, rolling his eyes.
“What shall it be today?” Watson asked, trailing his fingers around Holmes' erect member, making a point of teasing his partner, muscles twitching from the light stimulation and his desire pulsating with the longing for Watson's touch to shift just an inch further inwards. Holmes answered this with silence and movement, quickly switching their positions to sit instead in Watson's lap. He canted his hips forward, making his intentions quite clear.
Sherlock strode over to the door at that. “Scratches.” he pointed to show the DI and John. “He used a thin wedge. The door opens out to the hallway, not in to the room, so he locked the door before he left, using a wedge to push in the bolt and glide the door along the thinning wedge fall into the lock after it had already been turned. The only mistake he made: he was too rough and damaged the paint on the frame.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at him. “When.”
“What have they done to you..?” There was something in John's eyes that looked like disbelief and the shattered faith for humanity. Of course, as someone who's seen the worst of humanity himself, that was a valid expression to hold.
I'm sorry it took me so long. I'm having weird periods these days, not all of them nice. I do hope you bear with me, though, and that this isn't getting ooc - I'm losing control of these stories lately.
“Well, you have both sort of broken it already, haven't you?”
“It made it easier. For you.”
“Well, you thought wrong.” Sherlock retorted in his deep voice, stretching out his arm. It was the left one, which he'd bitten the very first time a couple months ago. It hadn't left any scars, which he was glad about. He was sure the same couldn't be said about what he'd done to Sherlock's right arm the night before. Still, the wrist was a very sensitive area, so he didn't want to bite it again, not when requiring such a large amount of blood. Instead, he went for the fleshier forearm again, but a lot more carefully that last time. His eyes fell closed as the warm, iron taste touched his tongue and streamed into his mouth slowly. He occasionally sucked at the wounds to get a momentary rush of it to flood his mouth. He could hear Sherlock's pulse pick up, felt it beneath his lips.
“I know. So what? Do you not trust me with a baby?”
John knew Sherlock meant it in a caring way, so he smirked instead of being offended. “Thanks.”
“Fine. Things haven't really changed all that much, to be honest.” John said calmly, pouring a glass of water for Mary.
He meant for it to be soothing, but clearly John was not satisfied, though he didn't argue for now. Lestrade, as ever called late to the action, took the three criminals off their hands and, thanks to John's skills in doctorly persuasion, let them leave with the agreement to come in for statements the next morning.
The red behind his eyelids darkened, a black shadow stealing the sun from beyond them. He expected a crooked grin, a soft scar and a faint fishy smell when he opened his eyes, but what hung immediately above his face was a bag. Small, but larger than a purse. He turned his head to now find the grin instead, remarkably straight, white teeth at the other end of a muscular arm. A drop of water hit his cheek. “What is this?” he asked softly, finding difficulty in focussing on anything other than the ocean inside another man's eyes. It went against all his believes in rationality, but he couldn't help but find himself enchanted by John. His grin was as out of character as they came and yet it was charming in its own way.
When John came back from work the next day, Sherlock sat in his chair, staring at the entrance to their flat like a predator waiting for his prey to walk in. John stopped abruptly when he saw Sherlock sitting there like that, his eyes wandering around the room, searching for some plot to start a conversation with. “I see you are very eager to talk to me straight away.”
“Your an angel, John Watson.” Sherlock said in fake surprise.
Mycroft cleared his throat delicately, but it was John who answered. “You would leave behind your family and be stuck with me.” Sherlock was just about to say something, however, John stopped him. “Your family is worth the time, Sherlock. Don't waste your opportunity. After the trouble you went through for your mother? After how your brother cares for you? Is this really how you want to repay your crew? Honour their deaths?”
“I want to commit to you, to this relationship. I don't feel like I would do you justice if I kept my word to Mary.”
The report ended with a reporter talking to the camera in what looked to be the city of interest, some people running through the crowds in the background.
He chuckled and kissed her forehead. Then he changed his clothes and set off to see his brother in his pretentiously big estate. Known by the guards, he was let through with no fuss. “Mycroft!” he barked into the empty entrance hall.
“All of this.” he dismissed, not caring to go any deeper neither alone nor with John. Physical and psychological boundaries were still too completely different things.
Legend has it, merpeople appear only for sailors in desperate need – to save those unsavable. Other myths speak of sirens, luring sailors to their death with beautiful voices to have them crash their ships into rock.
“Really, it's fine. No need for any of,” he indicated the kit with his hand, “that.” John had treated wounds on him before and there had been casual touches more than a few times between them. However, and Sherlock was certain that it was the source of his nervousness, John had never touched nor seen that general area of Sherlock's torso. And he wasn't sure he was quite ready to share that with John just yet. Or ever.
Now, John did hard not caring for Sherlock on a deeper level. His initial and instant attraction towards the human man played the largest role in this, no doubt. He was a handsome fellow, if odd. But despite the tickle from his stomach through his tail fin, the charming character of “Captain Blackbeard” not only surprised John, it had charmed him. He was not to fawn over the phantom of a merman, he gave retort to John, letting him bring him back to land as if it were the most natural place for them both to be in. And yet he seemed not to be a man to blindly follow a story. There was a sharpness in his eyes, like the blue skies hiding an eternity of truths and secrets. John wanted to know them all and yet he would not ever need to.
“You were a soldier.”
“Oh, don't, John! Your aim is perfectly fine, what could be keeping you from drawing a straight line?!”
“Have I said, with one word, that I would not care for our child?! Are you really accusing me of that?!”
John shook his head. “You really can't.”
“I alone decide about my life. I don't care that we come from 'different worlds'. We both need adventures and I will travel the world with you to find them.” He was aware of how foolish he sounded, desperately in love like a simple man. “What are you so scared of?”
“Oh, John, there will be plenty of action for the both of us.” Holmes' grin was met with one very levelled one by Watson. He gave in. “Also, I do have a surprise for you.” Holmes raised his hand, in which he had held, for several hours now, two slips of paper. He held them out in the small distance between their bodies and Watson grasped them, studying them intently.
“I said you would not believe me.” he replied petulantly. “I would not believe it had I not seen it. I spoke to him. I became unconscious once more and had he not been present to ensure my safety when I woke on the shore, I would have told myself it was a dream, a hallucination. But he was there. I will meet him again tomorrow. Mycroft, I think.. I lost my heart.” he whispered, horrified as well as amazed by himself.
“I could ask you the same.” Sherlock immediately countered, a little to John's surprise.
John's smile feel to sadness. “It is possible, but our worlds are too far apart. We mustn't get lost in a fascination that would not sustain our lives.”
Sherlock watched him catch his breath. “How many times will you have to..”
“Inside a building, outside or on a person?”
“I did, but for the wrong reasons. I was angry, I married you out of anger towards Sherlock. I was desperately trying to run away from this. I already felt it then, that it was wrong, but I was too proud to stop it.”
I laid on a pitying smile for him. It had so often aided me in throwing him off a scent, though I could not claim this to be as noble a time as some others had been. “Oh, Watson, you are making a big matter out of a little thing. There is no larger meaning to it. I must readily confess, that I am not without fault myself. I am often not in the best of habits and my character is rotten in many places–“
“Answer me!”
One might question why they were still fighting, but John always kept in mind, that everyone died eventually anyway, so why do anything in the first place, if you give up over something like this. He was a man of hope. Maybe he wouldn't see the day, maybe neither of them would, but once it was figured out just what had caused this, there would be work on a cure. Maybe he was lucky enough to make Sherlock see the day. He prayed for it.
Especially at the end, when the old woman became a murder victim. The long time she'd had to wait had driven her to give in to fear and, despite being warned, started describing. Sherlock went still, features carefully schooled, but John read it in his body and his silence. He read it in Sherlock's petulance afterwards: He'd passed the test, but lost the round nonetheless because he couldn't save her. He did care.
“¡Dios
“I wanted you to know that I'm not angry either.”
“It seems to be getting easier each time.” It was merely a whisper from Holmes, but it carried as much weight as anything said out loud.
“I got your usual, hope that's okay- what is this?” John stopped as he entered the flat, irritated by a comfortably cushioned sofa, wine glasses, a bottle of red wine and the TV showing a still of a Doctor Who DVD cover.
“I did. I do. Just not in the way that I do him. Never.”
“I can only carry so much weight with me at once.”
“Object. Eighteen.”
“My dear old fellow,” he addressed me and it was the softest sound I had heard until that minute, “I am glad you felt yourself ready to tell me this.”
“If you won't kiss me to promise a continuation of our relationship, then will you kiss me to leave a memory of what I will never have?”
They rode the cab back home in silence, but it wasn't the usual, easy silence, which spoke for itself. This was tense and John's body language suggested he was in army doctor mode; quite nervously so. He was tense and his leg restless, one hand drumming a silent rhythm on his knee.
“Very well, sir. Is that all for the moment?”
They stayed on the sofa, cuddling, breathing, enjoying each others' presence. Before long Sherlock was lost in the depth of his mind, but not to solve a puzzle. It was the part of his mind palace that harboured calming thoughts and memories. This combined with John's affections was a state he could enjoy for hours on end without ever feeling the need to move or take action.
“Yes, Sherlock, but you don't just go out and buy one.”
John flinched at the quick reply at first, but then sighed as the meaning sank in. “Please don't tell me you did your research on the internet...” He took off his jacket and shoes, waiting for Sherlock to speak again.
There was a silence in which Sherlock did his best to be unreadable, which was a tad difficult under John's concerned stare.
It was a day after Mycroft had come by when they finally reached their part of London and John watched them pass their house with a heavy feeling of depression. They reminded him of who they had been before, as a society; aimlessly wandering around, ignorant towards the existence of anyone else, staring into the world with a blank face, a common ideal keeping them going and nobody knew what for. They were exactly the same, but stripped of their masks.
“Sherlock Holmes.”
“Is that so? Well, then I guess I'll have to thank them as well.” John concluded, kissing Hamish's forehead in thanks, as did Sherlock. “Go on, open the other ones.”
“No, Sherlock, we agreed to this.” John answered sternly.
John's forehead pressed against his. “What's the matter?”
“That's so cool! Bees are adorable!” the boy continued to squeak. He was about Sherlock's age, but a bit taller and definitely more extroverted.
Sherlock's eyes snapped back down. “What? It's what?”
“It's tradition, Sherlock, it's-” John stopped and paled.
That day, they left the house around noon and went further away from their beloved home.
“First of all, that's Frankenstein's creature and secondly, no. Just no. I'm a.. vampire.”
“Transphobia isn't that uncommon, John, you can't blame me for being.. cautious.” His voice wasn't accusing. He sought understanding.
“Actually, I've seen them.”
A second later, Sherlock's pale forearm was right in front of John's face and the question “will it hurt?” in his ear.
until you came back. And yet I felt more alone then ever before because for no reason at all I thought you had wanted me out of your life again and knew I wouldn't just leave. That was paranoid bullshit. I need you and you need me, I think we are agreed on that and denying it would be a ridiculous attempt at independence. But going so far as to attempting to kill yourself? Are you mad?!”
John smiled. Mycroft had his own way to show his love for his little brother – forbidding him trick-or-treating seemed all too fitting.
He was probably worrying more than was necessary.
“So... Mary?”
Sherlock shrugged. No new cases came in and they spent the day lazy in the flat, John doing what he could to keep Sherlock entertained until he was off to bed again.
Sarah and he did break up, though. He agreed that it was best for her. He didn't have enough time for her as it was with Sherlock and the Game they found themselves in so suddenly – he didn't want to actually have her die because of their relationship. They stayed friends and there were no harsh feelings between them, which, for the sake of their work together at the clinic, was very helpful.
“Hah. What makes you think I haven't heard them before? A sailor half-dead is as secretive as a drunk one.”
Sherlock took a quick look at John, clearly determining whether John wanted to eat. “Yes, you can bring it up!” he shouted, climbing off the bed again to take the food off their landlady.
Sherlock sighed, taking a second to think about how to phrase this without it sounding any kind of wrong. “I just sometimes don't feel much like being touched. It's not personal.”
Sherlock frowned deeply. “How bad can it be? I don't see a disadvantage.”
have a key to it. So either raised here or lived here for a while. You will have to show me the other crime scenes for more information on him.”
Finally, they break apart, both panting for breath. Sherlock’s gaze catches John’s, and he smirks at the doctor’s swollen lips and ruffled hair, creating a mental note to make John look like this as often as possible.
"Okay...Trouble in paradise?"
"A zodiac sign. Aquarius to be exact, or so Molly tells me."
The bodies are becoming more frequent, and Sherlock still hasn't solved it. John curses under his breath, annoyed at himself for not realising it sooner. Compared to the other cases they've had, this is by far the longest. Four bodies in and they still have no suspects. John feels comfortable knowing that the yard has people working on it, but he's starting to realise the effect it's having on Sherlock. He's been distracted, focusing too heavily on the unfolding of their relationship, but it must be driving Sherlock wild.
"It's something obvious, I know it."
As it turns out, he needn't have worried. When he finally arrives at Baker Street, the detective is the one to open the door.
John isn't sure who initiates it, but between one heartbeat and the next they become entwined, one breath bleeding into the other. Steady hands guide him backwards, and their walk feels like a dance towards the open bedroom door.
“Seven!” Sherlock lets himself focus on the rest of John’s outline, reading data between his clothing folds. Dropped shoulders, even stance, a relatively relaxed neck. Good—no stress; the wound in his shoulder was not bothering him, and his leg hasn’t played up in months. John’s neck tends to tense and draw his shoulders up when he’s tired, but there is no evidence of that here. Definitely lying. But why?
“Couldn’t sleep?”
"What about the guy he was hitting on, did you get his name?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sheelog? Really?” Sherlock giggled as he entered the living room, collapsing onto the sofa. John handed him a blue box, and Sherlock immediately started to unwrap it.
He’d been fine, in the moment. He’d been calm— prepared to go to any lengths to get the upper hand over Moriarty. Yet here, miles away from the pool and those dancing red dots, his heart beats frantically against his ribs each time he tries to fall asleep.
The sand is scorching beneath his feet. He wiggles his toes, sand running between them, and he raises a hand to shield his eyes from the blinding midday sun. John stands in the middle of a desert, dressed in a loose white shirt and khakis, barefoot in the golden sand. He twists around, searching the rocks and planes around himself, but he's completely alone.
Sherlock Holmes. He turns the name over in his head all the way home. It's old fashioned, and it fits strangely in John's mouth, but he likes it. It seems to suit the mysterious stranger. At least now he knows that Sherlock Holmes probably didn't murder Daniel Murphy — not if the police actually know him. He contemplates the possibility — had he ever suspected the man of killing Murphy? It had crossed his mind, briefly, but he seemed to dismiss it out of principle. Too quickly, perhaps.
The knife stops mid slice, still dug deep into his chest, and the woman in front of him cocks her head, her eyes scanning his face as if searching for something. She sees each crease of his skin, the salt leaking from his eyes; bile dripping from the corner of his mouth. She regards him for what feels like an hour, her face steeped in the curiosity of a child, before she finally speaks.
"Thank you for your time, Miss Torres."
When it came time to choose a university, there was no question of where he wanted to be. Six years living in central, and he’d never tired of it. After he enlisted, the thing he knew he'd miss the most, beyond his family or friends, was the city.
Sherlock took care to shut the bedroom door quietly behind him as he entered the kitchen. John had always been a light sleeper — a leftover habit from the army — and these days he slept even lighter; one ear always open for the toddler upstairs.
"Yes."
Each time he was given leave, he'd spend a week or so with Harry and his mum, before making his way back to London. He savoured the moments when he'd step off the train and inhale the first lungful of London air; it tasted like home.
. John doesn't have the thrill that Sherlock brings, the calm certainty that this is who he is. He is a man who runs around London, chasing criminals until the wee hours of the morning. A man who invaded Afghanistan, pulling bullets from intrepid soldiers. He is a man who doesn't give up. Safety is wrong. Safety is easy.
John groans into his glass. He's been dreading when this was going to come up.
"Always."
It was something Sherlock had noticed early on. John thrives on the franticness of their cases; flirting with danger as readily as Sherlock, but in-between the crime scenes and midnight chases, he is exceptionally ordinary. John doesn’t have any unusual hobbies— he unsuccessfully tries to hide his mild irritation at Sherlock’s riskier experiments, and, unlike Sherlock, John doesn’t go out of his way to put himself in danger. He is always the one to insist on a plan before chasing criminals through dark alleyways. Given Sherlock’s habit of following his instinct rather than thinking his actions through, they would have been in deep trouble if John was equally as impulsive.

"Um, they were all found in different parts of London?"
"I can picture the blog post now. 'Police arrest killer by mistake, Sherlock Holmes goes out of business'. "
John feels his shoulders relax, and he stretches out a little on the mattress, sliding a hand underneath his head. He can’t say he was expecting it, but having Sherlock so close to him is a relief. A silent reassurance that he is not alone in being haunted by that lilting Irish accent.
"This way, please." Donovan walks around the edge of the room, coming to a halt in front of a lift in the far corner. The doors open with a creak, and John enjoys the twist in his stomach that comes from ascending too quickly. They only climb two floors before the doors open again, and the Sergeant wastes no time in leading him down the endless twist of corridors that lie beyond.
"Hey," John feels Sherlock's hand reach forward to take his own, and he smiles because of course Sherlock would realise the minute he woke. John blinks his eyes open, using his free hand to wipe away the crust of sleep.
“I’m sure he’ll be okay, Sherlock. He’s always been a fighter, that one.”
"How would they know how to find them if they never spoke to each other?"
"I think you should do it again, just to be sure."
Sherlock Holmes was the first person who really saw me; saw through the limp and the facade of coping, and reminded me that I was always whole. I hadn’t been broken by my invalidation, I had simply changed. The adrenaline junky, problem solving, justice-seeking John Watson was still within me, just buried by layers of grief. Sherlock gave me the greatest gift of all; myself.
“Good morning to you too,” John pushed his weight backwards, playfully nudging into the detective’s chest. Sherlock swayed slightly but effortlessly regained his footing, wrapping a long arm around John’s waist for balance.
“Hello, Watson. Is it almost time for bed?”
Part of him feels bad — using Mike like this. He should have contacted him before, asked for a genuine meetup, rather than to gain information about his mysterious Sherlock Holmes. Still, he's here now, and that's what counts. Probably.
It's three am when the text arrives, and John is still staring at the ceiling, waiting for sleep to claim him.
The cold air is a shock when they leave the restaurant. John's breath pillows in front of him, and he pulls his coat closer, glad for the thick jumper beneath.
“Kiss me.” He repeats, and I lean in and hover mere inches from his lips. I can feel his breath tickle my skin.
"Fuck this. I don't need to hear this from you. I'm going for a walk."
“Of course, I need you. You— you keep me right.”
“You don’t need me,” John answers far too quickly. Sherlock’s eyes crease at the edges, betraying a gentle frustration.
It’s a far cry from what he wants to say, but he can’t seem to find the right words. That’s never been a problem before.
“I spent years in the middle of a war zone. I chase adrenaline as if I need it to breathe, but in all my life, I have only ever met one person I was ready to hand my life to without question. Why was it you?”
“This can wait. We’re taking you to a hospital.” Sherlock’s eyes plead with me, but he doesn’t have enough strength to argue.
John's mouth twitches at the corner. So he had noticed, he just wasn't doing anything about it.
“I can feel you watching me.”
Looking at Mrs Hudson now, he is overwhelmed by the love he has for her. She has been like a mother to them both- making sure they were always okay, consoling them whenever they got into arguments with each other. Looking back, he’s not quite sure how he thought he was alone for so long. Molly, Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, John. They are his friends; his family. People who love him for everything he is, rather than hating him for everything he is not.
The creature moved , positioning himself at the end of the plank, where Sherlock's feet rested, and set it into motion. “England it is! My name is John.”
“Yes, anything
“Don't you want to?” Sherlock frowned, putting on his best mildy-pouty-face.
A grin caught the edge of her lips. “I am not dead yet, no.”
“Romantic.” He rolled into the crevice between John and the back of the sofa, which also shoved John further to the edge of it until he had to get up in order to not fall.
Sherlock spent a large part of his day in solitude, withdrawn from the other two, occupying himself inside his mind palace, to which John didn't have many objections – at least he wasn't complaining about boredom.
But the right setting would be needed in order to not make him feel too loaded with rules and cornered by arguments.
Sherlock bound up the steps, anger gripping his core tight. “We were attacked, Mycroft, under your flag! Attacked, plundered and murdered, every one of my men. I would be, too, had I not lost consciousness!”
“Sherlock Holmes, hm.” He seemed to mull the sound of it over in his mouth. “I like that.” he finally concluded.
“Behave then!”
Sherlock, meanwhile let his fingers glide over the scar on the front of John shoulder. He was right, when Sherlock had changed his bandages, he had noted the second scar on John's back that perfectly mirrored the first. The brunet leaned over and placed a little kiss on the skin.
Sherlock gaped in awe. “I want to be piwite!” he suddenly whined at Mycroft.
Hamish looked up with large eyes. Oh, John knew what that look meant. “Can I keep my jacket open, please? I'm not cold.”
It may not have been the best timing, but he'd found himself work as a physician right in the middle of a case that Sherlock was convinced was not a coincidence of a threat(?) colliding with a suicide, but actual, deliberate murder.
“Yeah.” John agreed and, after a moment, got up and stretched his hand out for Sherlock to take. The younger man took it.
“No, I actually enjoyed it. A bit.”
Sherlock grabbed his hand, making John look back at him. “Don't worry.”
!” she corrected desperately. “John, you married me, that can't all have been for nothing.”
John could tell from the way his head swayed, that Sherlock must still have been quite dizzy. John's voice lowered into the tone of a petulant child as he flopped onto his back next to his mad friend. “Don't just go jumping after him, then. You knew he was stronger than you.” Sherlock didn't reply. John turned his head to look over at him. “You could have drowned there.”
Everything is not tickety-boo.
“Slow, John!” Sherlock whispered, stopping John once he was sitting on the edge of the bed. He carefully pulled off the equipment attached to his friend and then stabilised him as he stood up. He opened a bag he'd brought with him and helped John dress. “Can you walk?” John hummed a vague reply and leaned heavily against Sherlock as the brunet lad him through the halls of the hospital, sneaking him out undetected. They got a cab back to Baker Street.
He watched the muscles along John's back draw tight and release in a rhythmic succession, a job they were well accustomed to, it appeared.
John regarded him for a moment, wanting to deny him further, but he also didn't want to die. He pulled the limb back towards himself and bit down on the fleshier part halfway up to the elbow, fearing his lack of control over his strength in such a situation. He sighed as he pulled his fangs out, sucking eagerly at Sherlock's arm, who hissed at the deep bite, but didn't complain.
“It would still be the correct thing to do.” John reasoned, trying to clarify that it would be fine if Sherlock asked him to.
A chuckle sneaked itself into John's breath. “Not unless you count dropping it. Sixteen.”
Sherlock chuckled lowly and John joined him in giggling, leaning into him as he bent down, kissing him gently.
“Yeah, well, it's still good to know.” John gave up reading, slamming the paper down into his lap in resignation. Sherlock was right, of course, it didn't really interest John. News never changed even after a hundred years.
“My men are dead, my ship is broken. I have nothing left in this world.” He watched John's eyes focus on his. “And neither you in yours.” he said, motioning with his hand at the deep, red scar at John's shoulder.
“All taken care of. I asked Mrs Hudson to cook for us so I could take care of you.” Sherlock explained, pushing back the duvet to take a look at John's bandages.
“A moment ago you thought me a siren, so indescribably beautiful I could lead you to your death and now you insult my very face. You're not much of a noble man.” There was no anger in John's voice, only fondness and a bit of cheek.
But as it turned out, he learned a lot from it. For example that it's best to be relaxed and calm when participating in physical intimacy like kissing. John stimulating him that way lead to a nice bout of pecking and a calm mindset was more creative, more prone to let go and explore. And that Sherlock did.
Hamish looked back and forth between them for a second before erupting in a loud “Eeeeeeeew!” having John laugh like an unusually amused, ripe tomato.
“Why would we wish to see you come to an end? Humans are vicious creatures, killing what they deem threatening. We don't appreciate being attacked, but we're also not as ruthless to blindly let others die. Personally, I find your people curious. You are very inventive.”
He spoke at large. “'Lady Elizabeth Garner, whom has been a widow of Sir Jonathan Garner, has passed due to natural causes.' Holmes! Was it not the same Lady Elizabeth Garner that we helped out in the matter of The Torn Lapel?”
He wanted to retort, to call nonsense on that story, but somehow he felt he had to believe John. If he could be charmed so easily, no woman would stand a chance but flutter at the presence of this beautiful man. “Am I just a trophy in your collection, then?”
John and Sherlock's eyes met in the spreading silence of shared knowledge. There was a storm coming.
It felt like all he fought for was to keep Sherlock alive, stupid as it may sound. Sherlock was a grown man, easily underestimated in strength and capability to fight. But something about him made him seem so innocent to John, that he felt the need to protect this innocent life like a child. The man hadn't even complained when John had directed him to mostly stay safe behind him. He'd practice with him a bit, of course, and maybe he'd slowly let him take more fights as they grew into this new life, but he'd like to just know that he was safe and protected. He was the closest relationship John had had in years after all, which, suddenly, made him feel very conscious.
funny, John! You know I hate social events, like these!”
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms,
. The way you hold yourself says military, but the location of your injury and the lack of calluses on your hands suggests a medic rather than a standard soldier. When I hugged you I felt the ridge of a scar on your shoulder — given its size and scarring pattern you were most likely shot from the back, indicating you were bent over a patient in the field when you were shot. You flinched when I brushed against it, so it's only recently healed — you must have only returned home in the past few weeks then. You were at the bar alone, not scanning the crowd or waiting to meet anyone. The table you chose was hard to see from the door — if you were meeting someone you'd have chosen one closer so they could find you easily. Most people don't go to new places alone, so you must be isolated. You kept looking around, taking in every detail of the space — a nervous habit from time in the military. You're anxious in new surroundings, so you catalogue the area in case you need to make an escape. Thus, new to the gay scene.
An older lady stands on the other side, dressed head to toe in purple. She's very slight, and as she stands she favours one leg more than the other — the telltale sign of someone with a bad hip.
"Good." He sips slowly at his water, quashing the urge to swallow it all down in one go. He takes stock as he does, identifying the different aches and pains in his body. Every muscle seems to be screaming at him, sore as if he's just run a marathon. His throat still aches, presumably from having his stomach pumped, but it's all overwhelmed by the sharp aching in his chest. Instinctively, his hands search for the source of the pain, and he is greeted with thick padded dressings across his chest.
The gunshot echoes in the small room, and the coin clatters with an unexpected softness. She’s good. Better than me. Which begs the question- who is this woman standing before me? Is she running towards something, or away?
His eyes scan frantically around the room, cataloguing all of the broken pieces of his life, left here to rot. His vision starts to swim, overwhelmed with the quantity, until he sees something that makes him stop.
A comfortable silence stretches between us. The last year has been nothing but silence. We’ve been tiptoeing around each other, trying to pretend we're not both drowning. It’s time for it to end.
"I'm not going anywhere." A hand makes its way to the back of his neck, rubbing small circles at the base of his skull. He leans into it, letting his eyes flutter closed and sleep creeps up once more.
John arrives at the pub half an hour early, having vacated the flat in a hurry to get out from under Sherlock's feet. Patience is not one of the detective's virtues, and he had taken to pouring his frustration out onto his violin. After three hours of screeching, John has had enough.
John glances at his phone.
"That makes sense." Lestrade muses, fiddling with one of the flimsy coasters.
I smile despite myself.
- Small world, Say Something
His eyes have softened around the edges, and John resists the urge to reach forward and take the detective into his arms.
“Why you?” John replies, his eyes scanning Sherlock’s face as if the answers lie beneath his skin. That unsettles him slightly—confusion flashes across Sherlock’s face before he can compose himself.
“You can’t-“
“Kiss me.” He says again, this time cocking his head with a smug smile perched on his lips. I regain control, this time able to consider the words instead of blurting them out.
"You were thinking about it."
“I’m here to see John Watson.” He barks at the man on the front desk.
"Ah, but that's part of the game, John. They'd match with someone, then work out where they lived and what their schedule was based on the information available in their profile."
"Yes, I'm here to speak to a Detective Inspector Lestrade?"
“What do you mean?”
John hums as Sherlock's fingers settle at the base of his neck, softly massaging the skin beneath.
With the reassurance, Sherlock's fingers resume their journey as if uninterrupted, the touch a fragment lighter than before.
His breath catches in his throat as he recognises the remains of the chair in front of him — 221B. The carcass of the flat spreads around him, each turn of his head revealing a new fragment discarded. The wallpaper is shredded, the yellow face missing half its smile, and the skull lies black and crumbling beneath.
"I know." Sherlock's eyes flash with an echo of something, but it's gone before John can identify what it is. He stalks over to the body, analysing it with a perfunctory air, without a hint of the elegance of before. John hangs back, not wanting to provide another distraction. After a minute, Sherlock looks over his shoulder, seemingly searching for the doctor. He gives a slight flick of his head, and John wanders over, hesitant. He doesn't see his place here — doesn't understand what he can bring other than distraction.
"The universe is rarely so lazy."
Sherlock's eyes widen a little at the edges, his wine glass hovering halfway between the table and his mouth.
- Halsey, Finally//Beautiful stranger
After a few minutes of idle chatter, the white-shirted stranger loses interest and flags the barmaid over. She's dressed entirely in black with cropped brown hair; almost disappearing altogether in the room of vibrantly dressed men.
"What time did you last see him?"
John clears his throat.
"Is there anything that connects them?"
"What is one activity that mainly single people do, which requires them to talk to strangers?"
"Curly black hair, high cheekbones, very tall — he was wearing a suit and one of those Belstaff coats, you know the really thick ones."
"Lestrade called. They found another body."
They stop outside the entrance to Piccadilly Circus station, pulled to the side to let the crowds past.
"There — both Murphy and Rookwood have an app called Blaze." He switches phone profiles and scrolls some more. "And here, so does Underwood, Patterson, and McKenna. Now just to look for common matches."
"If you want it." Sherlock’s voice dips mid-sentence, a shadow of apprehension creeping into his words.
"What do you want me to say, John?" Sherlock explodes, "That's fine if you realise you've had enough of me? If you decide to run back to women because this isn't all you thought it would be?"
"Lestrade, I need access to their phones. Remote access will do; I just need to see what apps they've got installed."
The knocker, heavy and cold to touch, makes a satisfying sound against the wooden door as he knocks. As he waits for someone to answer, he takes a step back and surveys the building. Curtains flutter out the open window of the floor above, the sound of a violin spilling into the street below. John is mesmerised by the sound, startled only by the door being swung open.
The DI purses his lips, looking John over as if deciding whether he's worth sharing the information with. Something about John seems to satisfy him, however.
"We have our killer." John's grin spreads across his face, and as he turns, Sherlock is mirroring him, the frustration of the past few weeks chased out in a single moment.
John wracks his brain, trying to remember what he'd said.
"I still have a lot to figure out. It's going to take time to become comfortable with the person I am now, but you make it easier." Gone is the waiver of frustration and breathless rambling. "It doesn't seem quite so scary, when I'm with you."
I can handle the entropy, if you promise to stay with me.
“Five!” Something is definitely wrong, but how can John be feeling upset and affectionate at the same time? Unless he is upset because of the affection. Very possible. Perhaps John is in love with something but is upset that he feels this way. What could he possibly love, that would bring him so much sadness?
"Of course I know about the blog, John. What else would all your notes be for? And I can tell by the marks on your wrists that you've been leaning at a desk, typing — "
The room looks much the same; the purple-tinted lighting creates strange shadows on the walls, and bodies are still clustered in each corner of the room. Something, however, feels different; oddly comforting. Perhaps it’s John that’s different. He can vividly remember sitting here, months ago, and panicking whenever he made eye contact with anyone. Now, he scans the room comfortably, and whilst he knows that this scene is not something he wants to do regularly, he feels assured knowing that it exists. That there is a slice of London made just for him.
After the case.
Sherlock laughs at that.
It feels good to say. A small weight is lifted off my chest and I breathe a little easier.
"You should see his kitchen." John quips. Sherlock shoots him a half-hearted glare, and John raises an eyebrow in defence.
They are pulled from their cocoon only by Lestrade, calling to inform them of another victim.
They spend the rest of the day interviewing family members and searching McKenna's place of residence. Sherlock's mood darkens as the hours tick past, irritated that no leads have appeared. By the time they finish, alone in Lestrade's office, he's worked himself into a fury.
“It’s- it’s bad Sherlock. He’s stable, but he’s not woken up yet. Oh, Mycroft said to give you this-“ He reaches into his bag and pulls out a manila envelope. John’s medical file. Sherlock’s brain is too frantic to focus on the words- they blur and swim in front of him. He thrusts the file back to Lestrade with more force than necessary.
"Are you going to disappear mysteriously again?" He asks, trying to suppress the shiver running through his nerves.
"She's only just been found. It's unlikely to be hers, but I'll have to wait for a DNA check to be sure."
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
He thinks, gritting his teeth and pulling himself forward once more. A scrape of blood on glass, the burn of sun on skin, and he's there. The base of the door is in front of him; his hands can touch the polished wood. It hums beneath his hand, warmth spreading out over his palm.
John’s breath catches in his throat, and he lets his eyes drift closed. For the first time that evening, it is not the emotionless face of Moriarty imprinted on his eyelids, but the soft lines of his consulting detective. There is an easiness in the space between them, an invisible boundary that they have crossed. John is sure, for the first time, that he is not alone in the love that has started to well inside him. He doesn’t want to rush; to allow the lingering adrenaline to take control of the situation and lessen its meaning, but he feels settled knowing that he does not imagine the longing stares and electric sparks. When they are ready, they will be waiting for each other; silently promising to live.
"Go on then."
"Will do."
A tan, white-shirted guy approaches Mr Cheekbones, perching on the bar beside him, leaning forward to whisper something in his ear. John watches as the curly-haired man shakes his head and goes back to surveying the crowd. The white-shirt stays, reaching his hand to rest in the small of the coated-man’s back, murming words John can't quite hear. The taller man stiffens and tries to shuffle away along the bar.
"Nice to meet you, Sergeant."
She trails the sharp blade of the knife from his side up to his chest, amusement pulling at her lips. John slides down the wall as his knees buckle, keeping one hand along the brickwork to steady himself. He tries to push himself forward — use his body weight to knock her out, but the drug is too deep into his system. He flops rather than falls, and she pushes him back into the wall with one hand.
“I think that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.”
"Yes. Asphyxiation by choking on their own vomit, and the blood surrounding these two isn't theirs." He points and two victims spread on the steel benches.
“So what was all that about?”
"Whose was it then?"
"Suit yourself."
"Oh, most of them are single."
Because I did love her. I was drowning in grief for another love lost, and she lifted me out of the dark long enough to see again. That’s what makes this so hard.
The rotating doors give a soft whoosh as he walks through them into the high ceilinged foyer of Scotland Yard. A young woman in uniform greets him, instructing him to empty his pockets into the tray, before stepping through the arch of a metal detector. His stomach flips in brief panic, despite knowing for sure that he's left his gun at home. When the machine stays silent, the officer hands him back the tray with his wallet and phone, waving him onwards towards the front reception.
“Three!” Had John felt this way, the whole time, and Sherlock had been too caught in his own self-preservation to see it? Because it’s there alright—now he knows what to look for, the attraction is plastered all over John’s body, as clear as day.
"I just don't feel like I'm actually helping."
So, when he was finally discharged, there was no question of where he wanted to be. The only problem was, London was expensive. Part of the reason he enlisted in the first place was the bursary the army gave him. Money was tight at home, and his sister was already skirting along the edges of an alcohol habit. The grant money was enough to keep him in London, so he took it. 15 years and one bullet wound later, he finds himself in the same position; find the money, or get out.
The beam Sherlock emits almost melts John's heart. He'd promised himself to wait until after the case, when the threat of a serial killer isn't hanging over their heads, but he finds himself filled with a slither of unexpected confidence. Sherlock is inviting him into his space — asking him to take a more active part in his life. If that isn't the sign that John's been waiting for, then he doesn't know what is. Still, he can't help the gnawing self-doubt that he's reading more into this than he should.
"Mike Stamford."
"No. It was a complete coincidence."
"No. Lestrade got her. We found you just as you passed out."
“I’m sure he will. It was completely understandable, given the circumstances.”
He pulls himself from the trance and follows the river towards Scotland Yard. The wind is harsh on his skin, and the air has the frosty bite of winter. It's not as cold as it had been — winter is quickly fading into spring — but it makes a welcome change from the scorching dry heat of Afghanistan. His second home; another place where he felt he belonged more than any other, now tainted with the memories of pain and blood and death. The cold was good. Cold was safe.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open, and he leapt across the kitchen, only stopping long enough to press a kiss to John’s cheek.
“I was still under arrest this morning. They released me just after lunch.”
The handrail is smooth beneath his fingers, and the steps creak as he ascends. John thinks he hears the music pause as he walks, but it's so short that he's not entirely sure he didn't imagine it. When he reaches the top, the door in front of him is open, revealing a modest-sized sitting room that looks like it should be part of a museum. Papers clutter every surface; books are piled high in each corner, interspersed with artefacts and knick-knacks that would put his grandmother to shame. His eyes are particularly drawn to the sword resting on the table, standing bold on the polished wood.
When I walk into the flat, he’s sat in his chair watching the doorway, fingers under his chin as if he’s been thinking hard about something. His eyes meet mine the moment I cross the doorway — he’s been waiting for me. I can’t decide if it’s unusual or not. I drop my bag in the corner and I’m about to open my mouth when he speaks.
“Oh, Sherlock. Sorry, I’m just being silly.” She dabs at her eyes with a tissue.
I hang up, and by the time I’m up and dressed Harry is already in the kitchen making breakfast.
The bar is busy for a Thursday night. John hadn't expected it to be, but the larger crowd helps him blend in more. He feels awkward as he walks through the door — most of the people here are in groups, chatting away around tables or huddled in corners. There are a few people on the dance floor, their skin glowing violet in the purple overhead lights.
Another step. Desert. Another, 221. Desert, 221. He's gaining ground, each stride forward bringing him closer to the door — until something hits him, and he falls. Glass digs into his shins and wrists; blood drips steadily to the floor. His body is sprawled out on the blackened floorboards, less than a metre away from his goal. Ignoring the flash of pain running through his veins, he inches forwards, trying to get back onto his feet, but when surrounded by the relentless sun something bowls him over once more. He pauses, just for a second, trying to catch his breath, before edging forward again, using his arms to drag himself across the glass. In the corner of his eye, the dark figure lurks, crouched just out of focus. John turns his head to see it, but each time he moves it slinks further behind him, keeping out of reach. He stops, trying desperately to see what it is, but his eye can't focus long enough to get a proper view. It's animal-like, crouching low to the ground, but other than that, all he can see is a shadow. He rises to his feet, attempting to push forwards, but the attacker pounces on him again. His head smacks the ground and stars pop in his eyes.
“Thank you.” It’s not enough, but it will do.
"What do you remember?" Lestrade asks, sitting straighter in his chair and uncrossing his legs.
"Hi, um, I'm here to see Sherlock Holmes?" John worries for a second that he's got the address wrong, but no — the door clearly says 221.
"I know," Sherlock agrees, but there's a smug grin plastered to his face. He grabs his laptop from the sofa and pulls up the phone software, cross-checking matches between the victims.
I climb into the front seat, not wanting to be near the woman who claims to be my wife. The ride to Baker Street is silent; each rustle of coats and clicking of the indicator seeming loud in the tension between us. When we finally stop, I’m the first out, partly to put space between us, and partly because I know Sherlock will struggle up the stairs and won’t want us to make a big deal out of it. I know what his plan is.
“Think about it; you don’t actively seek activities that would give you an adrenaline rush. You don’t do extreme sports, most of your life is very ordinary— except for when someone else needs you. Then you step up; put yourself in situations that you otherwise wouldn’t. It’s why you joined the army, and it’s why you stayed with me.”
- Taylor Swift, Soon you'll get better
"Freak," Donovan mutters, letting out a sigh.
"Am I actually allowed to be here?" John asks, half jogging to keep up with the detective's longer legs.
Mike Stamford looks different from how John remembers. Then again, he supposes he does too. Mike seems rounder — a little softer, grown into the sharp angles of his youth. He has glasses now too — small oval ones that make his eyes look a bit too big.
Lestrade finally appears through the doors, jogging up to the desk.
"Lestrade, have you been in contact with the family yet?" Sherlock calls over his shoulder to where the DI is standing, watching. Lestrade gives an empathetic glance at John, noting his awkwardness, before turning back to the taller man.
John feels giddy whenever Sherlock laughs, and he finds himself cracking jokes and making sly comments just to hear a whisper of it. John can tell whenever Sherlock is hungry — despite his protestations — and has figured out the best way to sneak food into Sherlock without him noticing that he's eating. (Sweet things; biscuits with tea, the odd danish as they move through London. John pretends they are for him, and acts very offended when Sherlock steals bites.)
"We do indeed."
"What does that mean?"
No reply.
“Sometimes being the optimal word.”
"The gym? You think that's what connects them?"
“Two!” What should he do? John is clearly distressed by this knowledge, but is that because John ‘I’m-not-gay’ Watson has fallen for a man, or because he believes it to not be reciprocated? Should Sherlock wait until they are alone, blurt out his painfully late deduction, or should he say something now? He’s never been good at human behaviour, and this proves it.
John walks for hours. His shoulder becomes stiff, and his palms ache from digging his fingernails into the skin. When he looks up, he finds himself on Euston road, not far from the flat. Of course he's walked in a bloody circle.
The bar is busy for a Thursday night. This time, John is prepared. He beelined for a specific table as soon as they entered, leaving Sherlock to head to the bar and order their drinks.
"In here." The Sergeant opens the door to her left, holding it open by the handle whilst staying outside of the room. "I'll be back in a moment."
"Absolutely nothing. I'll need to examine the contents of her phone, send it to me when forensics have downloaded the contents."
They snap open, desperate to hear the voice again, and just as he begins to think he's imagined it --
As she turns, Mary’s face drops, and I can see the tears she is choking back. If it’s an act, she’s very good, and if I were a weaker man I would have broken at the sight. But I’m not.
He resolves to walk up the stairs before he can change his mind. The wooden floorboards creak as he ascends each step, not bothering to be quiet. John is not a light sleeper.
Sherlock stifles an eye-roll. John can be so very obvious sometimes. He closes his eyes, not with the intention of sleeping, but enjoying the sensory relief. John’s bed is cool against his skin, and the sheets are stiffer than Sherlock’s— they feel different against his bare legs. He’s not sure he could sleep here for any length of time— he’s spent a long time finding precisely the right pillows and softness of duvet for his own bed— but the sensations provide a welcome distraction from the storm inside his brain. Instead of pointless questions, he can focus on the scratch of cotton against his toes; the firmness of polyester under his neck.
"I was wondering how long it would take you to come here."
“You have to get better now, John. Sherlock couldn’t bear it if you didn’t. He loves you so much and I think he’d break if anything happened to you. And I-“ He hears her choke back a sob. “You’re like a son to me John Watson. The pair of you. Please, you have to get better.”
There is no franticness to their actions, no desperation to strip the other bare and devour them; rather a firm reassurance that the other is still there. Each item of clothing is peeled slowly from their bodies, and each touch of hand against skin is deliberate and controlled. John falls back against the pillows and Sherlock settles himself between his knees, leaning forward until they slide against each other, moaning into the contact. As they move, rocking together as the sheets curl around their ankles, they grasp at flesh and limbs, dark purple bruises blooming beneath their fingertips. It's a promise — not anything as endless as forever, but an affirmation that for now, they are here.
"I almost got off at the wrong station, but I got here in the end. Bloody tube." He says. He's not lying — that had actually happened. It's been a while since he's used public transport, and he's sure it's become more complicated since the last time. The stranger's eyes crinkle at the edges, and he pulls off his coat, draping it over the back of his chair.
They head back to Baker Street, Sherlock buzzing with frustration. The second they walk through the door he throws himself back into the case, pinning more things to the walls and spreading himself out on the floor. John lingers on the periphery, making tea that Sherlock only half drinks, and watching him with a hint of amusement. There's not much for him to do — his intellectual powers are nothing like the detective’s.
I swear I knew each hair, each line upon your face,
now. This room is their living room, their fireplace is set into the far wall, with their chairs placed next to it.
She watches me, not like someone in love who did wrong, or someone who seeks forgiveness, but with cold curiosity. Her gaze is calculating, waiting to see what I do next. I’ve seen it before. It’s how Moriarty watches Sherlock. Dark obsession. Mary isn’t apologetic- she’s not here to make things right. She’s here to protect herself. The Mary I fell in love with is never coming back- if she ever existed at all.
When he descends the steps at Embankment station the next morning, he pauses for a moment to take in the view. He commits to memory every building bordering the river; each person hurrying along the pavements and every smell that reaches his nose. John takes a deep inhale of the London air and feels regret pulling at his chest. There is nowhere else he'd rather be — no other city or town that gives him comfort the way London does; quiet anonymity whilst being part of a living, breathing entity. Originally, he was from Essex, but he'd loved every visit here as a child. John would beg his parents to bring him every birthday, and he'd wile the hours away aimlessly wandering the streets, marvelling at the hidden treasures nestled between the crowds.
John watches with faint amusement as Sherlock crouches low and examines every inch of the corpse. It's odd seeing six foot of gangly detective folded so close to the ground. Yet most people, John thinks, would look clumsy — awkwardly avoiding stepping in blood puddles. But Sherlock looks almost graceful. He knows where every inch of his body is, carefully balancing his centre of gravity to hover over the body without touching it. It's beautiful to watch.
But then who am I supposed to talk to?
The tongue sat in a blue cooler; a golden bow stuck to the lid. Molly’s pathology report was tucked in an envelope beneath the container, and Sherlock scanned through it, his eyes widening with excitement.
Surely there should have been some change by now?
"I may have broken into the system. I said I could do it faster than the idiots at the yard."
"So I've been told." He types furiously, creating some sort of algorithm to filter through the hundreds of matches between each victim. "There! Ami Lee. Matched with Underwood, Rookwood, McKenna, Patterson and Murphy. And if I have a look — there. They matched with Todd too."
“Why?” She asks.
“He’s going to be okay.” Mrs Hudson whispers, and Sherlock feels the lump in his throat return.
“The trains aren’t running at this hour, I’ll be back at midday. You’ll live until then.” He makes a noise like he’s unconvinced, but doesn’t push it. I am tempted, so tempted, to just pack my bag and slip into the night — to call a cab and be back in London by morning. If I was alone, I probably would, but it wouldn’t be fair on Harry.
“You want to get into Appledore. You were going to use her as a bargaining chip to get in and see the vaults.” The heart monitor beeps in agreement.
John flicks the kettle on and brews some tea, nudging Sherlock's cup into his hand to wake him from the depths of his mind. Any other time, he'd leave him be, but given that the last few weeks have been spent with Sherlock buried deep inside himself, he reasons that the detective is probably thinking in circles.
"You think so?" John thinks he sees the strangers eyes widen, taken aback by the compliment.
White light illuminates the room as the sixth text comes through; the phone sending deep vibrations through the dresser. Wearily, I open my eyes, sighing as I fumble to find the infernal device. This better be good.
I hate to make this all about me,
"Donor blood?"
A wave of drowsiness hits him, the thick burning of bile creeping up his throat. He blinks, trying to swallow it down, but the edges of his vision blur as the burning gets stronger. His head starts to spin, nausea rolling through his skull.
"Okay."
“I’m glad you found the place okay,” Sherlock smirks as he wanders over, holding a beer and a glass of wine.
"Do you actually know how furniture works? I don't think I've ever seen you use anything properly." Sherlock just raises an eyebrow, his eyes roaming over John's pyjama dressed form.
Sherlock shakes his head. "No. Family members have reported that Rookwood had only returned from visiting friends in Surrey the day he was murdered. That evening CCTV footage shows him at Electric Ballroom in Camden, before he was found dead just outside of Primrose Hill."
When the letter arrives, John is not surprised. A small part of him had been expecting it, the screaming eviction notice that drops through his letterbox on Monday morning. He still can't find another job, and the hours at the surgery are not enough to pay his rent. It doesn't help that his efforts have been severely muted by all the time spent with the world's only consulting detective. It almost seems unfair to be paying full rent for somewhere he spends so little time these days. Still, he has another month to find the cash before he has to move out of the city for good. Harry has offered him a room at her house in Chelmsford, but he dreads moving back to the town he worked his entire life to get away from, and the sister he loves but can't spend too much time around. The only upside is that he will be closer to his mother's grave; he's felt bad not visiting for so long.
"I was looking at all the matches the killer's account had made. You were one of them."
"Do you recognise this man?"
Sherlock's breath tickles John's nose as he sighs with amusement, before he leans forward and takes John by the mouth once more.
"Dr Watson," Lestrade merely nods at John in acknowledgement. "We've not found any new information since this morning, and as far as we can tell she's almost identical to the others, just with a different zodiac symbol."
Mike and Liz are expecting their first child in a few months, which is a goldmine of chatter for John to dig into. He's never had a strong desire to have his own children, but he doesn't mind hearing other people talk about theirs.
"I don't understand. He always seems so confident in himself."
John had felt the bullet pierce his shoulder and lodge itself in his infraspinatus muscle. His body had screamed at the intrusion, immediately trying to push against the invader. He knew the theory of bullet wounds, and could describe in detail how to treat such an injury, but at the moment when metal bruised flesh, all of it left his mind. He remembers being stunned; confused as to what had hit him. Adrenaline surged in his blood, but it wasn't enough to eliminate the pain. Counter-intuitively, he'd wanted to run — forget the mission and get himself out of there as soon as possible. There had been a split second of pure blinding panic before his training had kicked in. He'd sunk down onto his belly, lying for what felt like hours, waiting for someone to retrieve him. All the while pockets of sand and dirt billowed from the ground next to him; violent promises of death. At some point, he passed out, and the next thing he remembers is being in the medic tent, a scream dripping from his lips.
"The uni one?"
"How could you possibly know that?"
"You know what, John, sometimes I'm not sure I do."
And I think it's finally, finally, safe, for me to fall.
"Thank you, Sherlock."
I'm terrified, but I can't resist,
John’s heart skips a beat, stuttering against his ribcage.
"Um, no — but I did speak to him for a while."
Would it be enough, if I could never give you peace?
“Did you see him?” He asks.
“Everything.”
"I said, he's with me," Sherlock growls. John stifles a smirk as Donovan raises her hands in mock surrender and steps aside to let them past.
"Oh, That's brilliant."
"It's dangerous to assume without all the facts, but it's a possibility." The cab door snaps shut behind them, and Sherlock immediately whips out his phone, the dim glow of the screen spotlighting his face. "It's a chain, and Joseph Rookwood was clearly a bodybuilder; he must have gone somewhere."
“Everything?”
Sherlock is a master at solving crimes, but John is quickly becoming a master at solving Sherlock.
"Do you want me to?"
“Everything.” His voice breaks, and for a second I see the pain behind his eyes. Not just from his wound, but from the words I am hurling at him. I see how much he does care- how much he is trying to control the situation in an effort to make everything right again. My heart sinks, and I know that I should never have gotten married. Not to her.
Sherlock doesn't protest; he just throws himself onto the sofa in a huff. John grabs his jacket and takes the stairs two at a time, letting the door slam shut on his way out. He regrets it as soon as he steps out onto the street, remembering how late it is. Mrs Hudson is probably in bed by now. Although, given the racket they'd been making, he's doubtful she would have been able to sleep anyway.
"Is that any better?" Sherlock rumbles, his eyes still closed, basking in John's glow. He runs his hands around John's waist, lifting the fabric of his shirt slightly to brush at the skin beneath.
John doesn't realise he's staring until curly hair turns and catches his gaze, locking eyes and striding over. John panics a little. Did he think he was checking him out? He was, a little, but he's not quite ready to start picking people up in bars.
It’s like breathing for the first time.
“Nonsense, Mrs Hudson.” He sits in the chair beside her, placing an arm around her waist. She leans and rests her head on his shoulder, trying to disguise a sniffle.
"I met him at a bar. Said he worked at Barts." Better not to tell Mike the whole truth. As it is, Mike's mouth flattens, and a flash of hurt crosses his eyes. "I remembered you worked there and thought I should get in touch. For old time's sake." The lie easily drips off John's tongue, and Mike's face softens again.
“Don’t follow. I want you out of the house by tomorrow evening, or so help me god I will have you arrested.”
“Mr. Holmes. Detective Inspector. I was informed of your arrival.”
In hindsight, he understands that the feelings he'd had about men in his teens were not strictly platonic. Back then, he'd brushed it off as horny teenage behaviour, but now that he looks back, it's evident to him that these were the starts of his crushes. He wants to smack himself around the head at how oblivious he's been; how many opportunities he's lost. But a smaller part of him wonders if he needed to be this person, to have lived this life so far, to actually understand his queerness.
Sherlock groans, rubbing his hand over his face.
At just past midnight, he excuses himself from the flat, planning to catch some sleep before his morning shift at the surgery. Instead, he finds himself staring at the ceiling, his brain refusing to relax. He's unsure of his place in this arrangement. What is it that Sherlock needs from him? They're still tiptoeing around each other, both painfully aware of the sparking tension between them but neither wanting to take the first step. At first, it was fun, navigating their boundaries and casually flirting, but now it's becoming exhausting. He wants more — wants to take more, but somehow he can't bring himself to do it. If this were anyone else, he would have gone for it, best foot forward, but Sherlock feels different. It's not just that he's a bloke — which if he's honest, John admits his lack of experience in that field is adding to his anxiety — it's that he's Sherlock. This isn't some quick fix, there's no way he can rush something this unique. John is terrified of fucking up, losing Sherlock altogether, rather than gaining something more. But he can't go on like this.
"Why do you ask?" The inevitable question John has been waiting for. How does he explain? To anyone else, his actions could sound creepy. Which, if he admits it, they are a little. But there is something about Sherlock Holmes, some invisible force drawing John in. No matter how hard he tries, he just can't get the man out of his head.
"I don't know." Sherlock scowls, but keeps his hand in John's hair. John leans into the touch, wondering how he'd ever thought this would stop completely during a case. Sherlock is incredibly tactile, and when working he's filled with uncontained energy that needs to go somewhere. Before their relationship, he'd keep himself moving — tapping his foot or playing with the objects around him to keep his hands busy. But now he has John. Sherlock can focus his energy into the army doctor, whilst leaving his brain free to process the details of the case. It's a welcome arrangement for both parties.
"Go on," Sherlock smirks.
Lestrade lifts his hands in mock offence, grinning all the while.
"John, it's okay, you're safe. You're okay."
(See the end of the chapter for
"No. Keep it. You never know when you'll need it next."
"Come on, Lestrade's asked me to come to the crime scene. I thought you might be able to help." The silent plea for John's company sits behind his eyes. As much as he scolds himself for being excited to see a dead body, John can't help but grab his jacket and follow Sherlock out of the door.
He's answered by silence again. John scrolls all the way to the bottom of the page and presses the delete button. A quick '
"On top of this, the internal questions I had squashed over the last few years raised their head again. Feelings I'd tried never to look too closely at suddenly had a name. So I thought, okay, I might be attracted to more than just women, which is terrifying to figure out when you've already lived three decades. You're supposed to know who you are, by then. I started to wonder what else I was wrong about. I dug around inside myself, and I'm not quite sure what I found, but it was beautiful and terrifying all at the same time. Being unemployed, I had so many empty hours, and all I could do was think and think, turning my feelings over in my head, hoping that they'd start to make sense. Then suddenly, there's you."
Of course he’s making sense. Sherlock already helped me realise that I don’t settle for normal, as much as I wish I could. It was a delusion to think that I could try to forget- that everything could be swept under the rug and I could start again with an ordinary person in an ordinary life. It’s time to accept that I will never have that. I could never cope with it. However, right now, I don’t want it to be true. I don’t want to keep falling in love with people who eventually hurt me.
They order, and John leans back in his chair, waving away the wine bottle when the waiter tries to pour him a glass. He's had enough alcohol for the day. Besides, he wants to remember this.
"Yeah sure, I'll just finish my drink," John replies. He drains the last swigs from the bottle and stands to leave, grabbing his jacket from the chair. John is led through the glass doors, and he feels the gaze of the white shirt follow them as they leave.
Even in his drugged state, John lets out a cry, stars popping behind his eyes. The dark fingers of unconsciousness creep into his vision, but he tries to push them away, desperate to cling to his life for as long as possible.
"I never said you did."
John sits on the visitor's chair, his hand clenched in his lap. He wants to go over to Sherlock, sitting at the desk, and kiss away the worry lines that have accumulated at his brow. More than anything, John wants to wrap the detective in his arms and assure him that everything is okay. They might not have any new leads, but they have Sherlock's brain, and if anyone can solve the case, he can. Instead, he stays sat in the chair, ignoring the hunger pangs eating at his stomach and running through the details of the case in a desperate attempt to find a lead Sherlock could have missed.
"Sorry?"
"I suppose that's true; it seems unfair that you only ever see us at work." John raps his knuckles on the bar. "Do you ever talk to Sherlock outside of cases?"
“For your experiment. Remind me of the specifics?”
"Seriously? It's not a big deal. I don't understand why you're overreacting." John lets out a sigh and closes his book, resting it on the arm of the chair.
Sherlock Holmes had never been precious with his life. He both loved and hated his brain- it allowed him to see things the average person would ignore; collect torrents of information and sift through it until he found what was important; the identity of a thief; the occupation of a stranger. It made him unique, the ability to observe what no other man could, but it also left him exhausted. It wasn’t a trick he could turn on and off at will; he was continually barraged with excess stimuli that rarely had importance. As a young adult, he’d turned to the comfort of drugs, cocaine being his weapon of choice. For the first time, his mind became quiet and subdued, all excess information dulled. Of course, cocaine came with a hefty warning label, but for the most part, he didn’t care. He fell deeper and deeper into the well of his own mind, indifferent as to whether he could ever crawl back out. He stopped caring about his life. After all, his body was just transport;
"Good. I'll text you." He starts walking backwards, digging his hands deep into his pockets.
"Yeah, bright young things like we used to be. God, I hate them."
"Ah, Sherlock, you're finally here." Lestrade peels off from a group of uniformed officers, walking over to stand on Sherlock's right.
"Stamford?"
"I should have known it was that simple."
“I keep forgetting that you don’t have that limp anymore.”
“I never asked, does he have parents left? Is there anyone else in his family to see him?” Mrs Hudson asks.
Sherlock slept through most of the next day. Cases exhausted him, no matter how much physical activity was involved. He didn’t emerge from the bedroom until late into the evening, by which time Rosie was already ready for bed.
Sherlock shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
"No, it's membership only." He fists a hand into his hair. "There has to be something."
I want to reassure him that he’s not alone in wanting me home. I swirl the words around in my mouth, trying to pluck up the courage to take a step forward, to lead with honesty and perhaps fully acknowledge us, as an entity.
“Go on. Get cleaned up. I’ll stay with him.” Sherlock is torn between getting cleaned up and staying with John; wanting to be there the minute he wakes up.
“Have you read it?”
"Was she part of any societies or sports clubs?" Sherlock's voice is oddly soft. John's never seen this side of him before, and his heart flutters. Despite Sally's remarks, the man is more human than most John's met.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow.
The earnestness in Sherlock's eyes makes John's heart skip a beat, and he lifts his hand to brush an errant curl out of Sherlock's face. It's enough to chase away the shadows of worry that had nestled in his gut. He stands, pulling Sherlock up with him, and places a delicate kiss to his lips, melting as he feels the detective wrap his arms around him.
"I want to speak to them, are they coming to the yard?"
Lestrade pinches the bridge of his nose, exasperated with the detective's antics.
"I'm sorry I didn't delete the profile sooner. I'd honestly forgotten about it. But honestly, Sherlock, you don't need to worry about me leaving. You are, beyond doubt, the most incredible person I have ever met." He pauses for breath, picking at a loose thread on his trousers. He'd practised this all the way home, but it doesn't make it any easier to say. "When you found me, I was so lost. I was broken and bruised, and in the middle of the biggest identity crisis I've ever had. Suddenly you waltz into my life, and everything just — made sense again. I chose to be here, Sherlock, and that's not going to change anytime soon."
Sherlock’s brow crinkles with confusion.
John tries to protest, but Sherlock quietens him with a kiss. It feels like breathing again, as if he's been starved of oxygen.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And?"
"Come on, John. Let's go." Sherlock turns to leave, almost bumping into a uniformed officer in his hastiness.
"I'm coming." The words are bearly loud enough to pass his lips, but they are a promise. I'm coming to find you. Wait for me.
Logically, I know that the thing that’s building between us is mutual, I can practically feel his eyes raking over me when he thinks I’m not paying attention. My imagination is not vivid enough to create the tension that arises whenever I compliment him on crime scenes, or when he leans slightly too close. Still, I constantly doubt myself, part of me wondering if this is all some drawn-out experiment in human behaviour. It makes me hesitant, this doubt, to finally bridge the gap and give him the last part of myself that he doesn’t yet own. I am desperate to get this right, to prove that I’m here for the long haul. Desperate enough to wait when all I want to do is jump.
"Hello." It's all he can manage, the words scratching at his throat. Sherlock smiles, his face brightening but not quite reaching the melancholy in his eyes.
"Did he tell you anything else?"
And then there was Sherlock. Sherlock who had cured his limp with dinner and the promise of danger— Sherlock who drove him round the bend one moment then had him in stitches the next— the man who shot walls when he was bored and didn’t know the earth revolved around the sun. John could feel himself steadily falling. In the beginning, Sherlock had made it pretty clear that he wasn’t interested in pursuing a relationship, and John knew he needed to be careful if he didn’t want to face the rejection again. It wasn’t easy when Sherlock was the only person to whom he gave his life so freely. He hoped, somewhat selfishly, that Sherlock would have changed his mind. That three months living with John would have driven Sherlock out of his self imposed celibacy and into the arms of the doctor. John thought about it, sometimes. Late at night, he’d allow himself to imagine what could happen if Sherlock did change his mind— if they could fall into the easiness of something that resembled a relationship. Those nights, he let his mind roam wild, but come morning, he guarded himself with an extra layer of cautiousness.
“Sit.” I pull the chair out.
Sherlock lets out a small sigh as he comes back to himself, hands clasping around the mug. He looks up gratefully, closing his eyes slightly as he takes the first sip.
John's brow furrows in confusion, but he masks it quickly. That doesn't match with the information he's collected. Sherlock seemed perfectly capable of understanding when someone was flirting with him. Unless he was ignoring her on purpose.
"I don't understand." John perches on the back of Sherlock's armchair, eyes scanning the detective's face for a clue on where his mind is going.
The case here is based on ‘Eye contact’ by Fergus McNeil
“They’re already on their way.” He whispers, and I smile because he never fails to surprise me.
John poured them a drink in celebration:
Lestrade smiles and takes the seat opposite John, placing a thickly bound file on the table between them. Donovan sits in the chair at the end, setting a laptop in front of her.
"No, before then."
"It just felt so pointless. People I'd known for years — snuffed out just like that. Over what? Absolutely nothing." He lets out a breath through his nose, eyes squeezed tightly shut. "I tried to help them, but they died faster than my hands could work. And then it was too late."
The bedroom feels so empty. He knows every inch of it; can describe in detail each scuff on the floorboards; every dent in the wallpaper, but now it seems different. As if someone has shifted all his belongings slightly to the left, and his brain can’t wrap itself around the subtle change. Years past, he would have quieted his mind with something more potent than adrenaline, but now he is resigned to waiting for the sensation to pass. Thoughts replay over and over in his head, cycling too fast to analyse properly, adding a layer of frustration to his mood. Sherlock wishes he could make it all stop- halt the pointless storm of thoughts and make everything quiet again so he can sleep.
She turns on her heel and leads him through a set of double doors, her trainers squeaking on the linoleum. The room beyond turns out to be an open-plan office, hundreds of people sat at computers, chattering into headpieces or typing furiously away at their keyboards. The mundanity of it makes John's head spin.
His voice echoes around him, drowning out the ringing in his ears.
"So, you found him again, huh?" Lestrade's voice shakes John from his blind focus.
“It’s not—“ I start, but stop myself. What’s the point of denying it? I’ve always had a strange relationship with my sexuality, especially seeing everything Harry went through growing up. It took me a long time to get comfortable with the idea that I wasn’t straight, especially knowing that I wanted to be in the army — I convinced myself that the two things weren’t compatible. When I enlisted, I had initially tried to hide behind my bisexuality — to bury myself behind their assumptions of heteronormativity. I’m glad that in the end, the truth came out, (albeit under the influence of alcohol) and I was accepted for who I was, rather than the lie that I was trying to perpetuate.
His breath catches in his throat, panic steadily building in his chest. He stands frozen, unable to consider the possibility fully. Had he lost everything before he'd really begun?
"Greg." Lestrade chuckles.
"Ah, John. There's a pub down the road we normally go to, that alright?"
"If I want it?" John tries to hide the mirroring hitch in his voice, but it only serves to make him sound more panicked than intended. He scolds himself, forcing his shoulders to relax and seem less defensive. He is surprised at the proposition, not because he wasn't expecting this conversation to arrive, but because he hadn't expected it to be so soon. Or for it to come from Sherlock.
“I don’t see why we have to do this here,” Mycroft snickers, looking down his nose at the label on the champagne bottle, “I have access to an excellent suite on Embankment, with a beautiful view of the London Eye—“
"It's fine, it doesn't hurt."
"Fine. But if another body turns up, don't come to me." With that, he sweeps away, pulling his phone from his pocket as he stalks out of Lestrade's office.
“Oh god, yes.”
"John, I don't think that's true. God knows Sherlock doesn't care about labels. I think he's just scared you're going to leave him full stop. I'm not sure he cares if that's for someone else, regardless of gender."
The task turns out to take longer than expected. Baker Street is dark by the time Sherlock throws the laptop down in frustration.
Fuck it.
Sherlock almost growls, causing John to take a tentative step back.
"You'll find it." John means to sound reassuring, but Sherlock sends him a scowl all the same.
He'll never know.
"If you say so."
Sherlock’s stomach lurches as if he’s been punched. Was it not obvious? Did John not see his worth? If John believes that he is merely following Sherlock around, chasing his coattails and gently observing at crime scenes, then Sherlock needs to change his tact. There has never been anyone he needs more than John Watson.
"We know him. He's a... " Lestrade pauses as if trying to select the right words, "...colleague."
Finally, I start to accept what I’ve probably known for some time. Mary doesn’t love me. Perhaps she thinks she does, or perhaps she’s known all along that she doesn’t. Either way, Mary is playing a wicked game with me. Every action is planned to manipulate me into living out her fantasy. This time, I won’t let her win. She hasn’t met all of John Watson. Mary severely underestimates me if she thinks this is enough to keep me controlled. And she is clearly oblivious to the fact that she shot the only person I have ever loved more than her. Sherlock glances at me, and he knows. Of course, he sees it too.
Sherlock is hit again by a stab of premature grief. John hadn’t yet met Sherlock’s parents. When,
“Couldn’t sleep?” John asks.
"Yes, but that's assuming they acquired the drug from a London hospital, and it's not definitive." Sherlock sighs. "It would be supportive evidence, but it's not enough to make an arrest."
"How did you know?"
"Oh, yeah. Turns out we have a mutual friend."
“You’ve not even met him yet.” It’s not a protest, I know she’s right. Sherlock says that I am ‘a conductor of light’; helping him make deductions and solve cases without meaning to. That may be true, but he is my conductor of life. Somehow, everything makes more sense now. I am finally at a point in my life where I comfortable with what lies in front of me — I’m not running towards or away from anything; content to simply be.
John stays sat in stunned silence, pieces of the problem clicking into place. It makes sense Sherlock would lash out if he was so afraid of John leaving. It's the very thing John's been guilty of these past few years — pushing people away to reduce the pain when they inevitably leave.
"What's up with him?" Lestrade asks, taking a sip of coffee.
"Victim is Zahara Todd, twenty-eight years old, was training to be a solicitor. Lives in Kentish Town, and was found by some kids around lunchtime."
John nods. He could see how having your life story announced to the world would make some people agitated. Still, he silently disagrees with Donovan's analysis.
"Is it because of the gender preference?" He asks, his softening. He'd only used the app once since he was discharged — a feeble attempt to feel normal again. A change of photo was the only thing he'd felt comfortable doing.
Slowly, he brings his knees to his chest and tries to stand, but something pushes him down. A firm pressure weighs on his spine, and a deep rumble reverberates in his ears. His attacker, thwarting his final move. It would be easy to stop here. Let himself be pinned here forever.
A flash of fear runs through him, causing the hair on the back of his neck to stand on edge. Daniel Murphy was in the same bar, talking to the same man, and now he's dead.
"The picture is recent." Sherlock accuses.
“I intend to. When do I finally get to meet the boyfriend?” Her eyes twinkle, waiting for me to take the bait.
"Walk me through the details; sometimes it helps to have an outside perspective." He falls back into the main seat of the chair, crossing his legs, his knees falling over the armrests. "Oh, don't be like that, you know what I mean." Sherlock practically rolls his eyes when John crinkles his nose about being an 'outside perspective'.
There's a beat of silence where the two lock eyes, sizing each other up. John isn't sure whether to be scared, insulted, or impressed that this complete stranger can read his entire life story in just his face and clothes. Eventually, he settles on impressed.
The barmaid seems to drink him in, her eyes flickering over his chest and giving him a coy smile. She looks familiar, but he can’t place her face. She probably served him last night. He ignores her advances, placing cash on the counter in clear rejection. There was a time when he would have pounced on it; flirting with her because he could, regardless of whether it would lead anywhere. A part of him still wants to; she's not unattractive, her cropped hair accentuating the curve of her face, but he pictures Sherlock and the feeling fades.
Their celebration is short-lived, halted by Sherlock's frustration at the yard's processing skills.
"Do the zodiac symbols mean anything? Is there a pattern to which one is on each body?" John asks, trying to keep his mind off how tauntingly close they are sat.
“How can you possibly know that?” Mrs Hudson just gives him a soft look, one he’s sure is meant to reassure but in reality just infuriates him further. Everyone keeps trying to placate him- they all have so much hope that everything will be better, everything will work out just fine. But in Sherlock’s experience, that rarely happens.
“I hope it does. He’s good for you.” Harry’s face softens.
"No, I wasn't."
"And then it wasn't. The doctors patched me up and sent me home with a pat on the back and a '
"I am not."
“Ohh look at you two, you should have got married.” That is low, even for the circumstances. I regret the words as soon as they leave my mouth and the look Sherlock gives me chills my core. I saw him at the wedding; I know how he feels. That’s not the difficult part. It’s not as easy as forgiving everything and running into his arms.
“Just because it's not interesting to you, doesn't mean it also isn't interesting to me.”
“I don't do it every time I touch you, I wouldn't expect you to take on that hassle. Honestly, I mostly don't mind you touching me.”
“A sibling?” John asked Hamish.
There, in the middle of the street, was a group of five people, shooting their way over to a grocery store.
So maybe this sudden interest wasn't him being an experiment. Maybe John's openness, telling Sherlock the truth, had created a sort of trust that hadn't been there before.
They didn't last 12 hours with these people. John left them a few cans anyway, if only just to relief his shoulders off their weight.
“Jesus, Mary... Won't you even make an effort? This,” he gestured between the two of them, “is not going to work, the sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll be able to find yourself something new, better. She won't be missing a parent; she could have twice as many..” John tried to reason, staying calm and collected although he was getting pissed now internally.
They were taken with on the loot of the shop, which didn't have too much left, and were then lead back to the group's base in the middle of a village. Detached and quiet, just as John had hoped. They had settled down in a house, with all but one bedroom taken, sofas included. It didn't matter to them, really, neither of them minded any more, which, of course, earned them snickers and comments, but whatever, they weren't alone any more and they'd get used to them.
And so, to begin our story.
And then it came, the bang. The first sighting of a couple of undead people in Hastings. And people went mad. After having seen how quickly it had seemed to infect the Central European countries, hysteria broke upon the people, families fleeing up north, supermarkets being cleared off food. They were glad they had stocked enough canned food to last for about two years, which was a lot of food, but who knew how quickly this would be handled, if at all.
John considered that for a second. “Nah, it's not that far yet. I think it's better off compressed a little longer.” With that, Sherlock got up from the bed and went straight next door to get the medicine kit. Back in the room, he followed John's instructions until he was all patched up again.
“Some websites say only the canines are very sharp, other say there would be an entire set of teeth above the ordinary ones. Then again, with the first theory, some claim the canines would always be present in their outstanding length, while others are convinced they grow with a vampire's blood-lust. Then there's that. Almost all websites claim that vampires need to feast on human blood to survive, while others suggest that animal blood also works,” as Sherlock listed his findings in quick succession, John let himself fall into his own armchair, “and the bite is either deadly or converting the victim, which could otherwise happen by the vampire infusing their victim with their own blood-”
know. We know we can trust each other to always be there when need be. To know, that we can trust each other with things that we wouldn't tell anyone else. To know, that warmth and intimacy are right here when we need them. That
Sherlock shook his head. “No idea what you're talking about.” He took a sip of his tea.
“I just entered a romantic relationship with John Watson, I think it's save to assume I'm good for one or two surprises.”
“Are you ridiculing me?” John asked, feeling a sudden need for challenge overcome him.
“You may.”
There was a brief flicker of understanding in John's eyes, but nothing more. He reached for Sherlock's wrists, far enough away from the scars and motioned for him to pull down again. “Here, why don't you just undo the lower buttons? You won't have to hold the shirt and I won't see anything.” The care with which John said these words made Sherlock well up with warmth and gratitude. He unbuttoned his shirt until just below his chest. It fell open to his sides and revealed his stomach and the wound, keeping his scars hidden. John said nothing, just quietly cleaned the area. Sherlock tried to suppress any urges to flinch at the pain of the alcohol being rubbed, almost like silk, over his skin, but it stung badly. John inspected the cleaned wound with some gauze in his hand, absorbing any new blood that welled up as he took in the damage.
“What a shame about her bad fate. Did you not think her a most remarkable woman? Such strength and confidence. And very beautiful, too!”
John was holding his ribcage, the wind equally knocked out of him as it was for Sherlock. His face was screwed up, part in pain, but mainly in irritation.”Yeah!” He made it sound like it was the most obvious fact in the world. Maybe it was to a doctor, but Sherlock couldn't help himself. “What is that?”
That was when John came back into the room, his own shirt open over the white vest he wore. He had apparently checked for bruising where he'd earlier held his ribs.
