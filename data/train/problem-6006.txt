Tony’s hands drifted down to unbutton Steve’s shirt, slipping it off his shoulders. The cloth dragged over his shoulders, removing the dirt and sweat of the ride. Steve sighed with pleasure. The tenderness felt nice after such a rough few days.
“Nat’s been bugging me for months to sign up to the site and I only agreed to get her off my back. I only said yes to this date because, well
“I bet that’s nice. My best friend, his kids are one and three and they’re fun but the games get a little repetitive.” Steve smiled again. “So he’s Peter and you’re…?”
“No it’s fine,” Tony told him, pouring coffee from the carafe into his favourite mug. “Well, actually it’s not. I don’t mind that you have to travel, but it’s just starting to be weird that you have all these last-minute trips that you won’t tell me anything about.”
“I think that’s a talk for another time,” Tony interjected smoothly, and Steve looked relieved. “How about you worry more about how much food you’re dropping on the floor?”
Mr Barton walked him over to a shed where the tractor sat, big and unmoving. Tony could almost feel the thing suffering, his magic already stretching out, wanting to help. He let the tendrils flow out, inspecting the gears and tapping parts that needed the most love.
The doe sucked in air, looking surprised, but Stíofán tugged at him. “Straddle me, I want inside that sweet ass of yours.”
He shot a look at the town clock, the big hand ticking past the hour. He couldn’t believe he was running late.
“Some people can’t let go of hope I guess,” Tony agreed. “Even when it’s clear that hope is all it is.”
“That’s it, yeah, take it,” he growled, enjoying the soft gasps the doe made with each push in. “I’m glad I won you. You would’ve made a fine lay for the sailors down at the port, but you were made for me, weren’t you?”
Tony hit the ground right next to Steve, covering his six with a few well-placed repulsor blasts. “Ha! Eat it, assholes!”
And before they could answer, he turned and walked away, trying to keep his pace natural even though all he wanted was to run away.
He darted off into the house, letting Tony take in the space properly. He wandered over to the herb garden, pleased by the range. He saw one plant getting a little limp, so he muttered a favourite spell of his mother’s to make it perk up.
He came around the kitchen island, sweeping them both up in a hug. “I knew I didn’t raise two bright kids for nothing.”
The doe nodded, and Stíofán went for it, pushing in long and deep, enjoying the suction on the withdrawal. He was getting closer and closer, but he wanted to claim Antonius again, mount him. He pulled him off and he almost reached the peak, breathing hard, his cock wet and straining.
He stepped forward, clearing his throat. “And who exactly is your boss? Why has he interrupted our party?”
“This is insufferable,” Tiberius growled. “Not only does Stíofán get his own whore, but I have to see it while I eat this flavourless crap.”

“Hey,” a familiar voice behind her said, and she looked over her shoulder to see J.J with Azari on his back. “One of those for me?”
Tony laughed at something John said and turned to Steve to share in the joke, smile wide and eyes sparkling with mirth, and Steve felt his stomach swoop.
Tony had been sitting at the table while the Sheriff had gone for drinks when an alpha sat opposite him.
It had been going well he thought, the encouraging pat on his shoulder from Pepper as she passed him letting him know they were getting some good engagement.
Steve seemed to perk up at that. He lay his head back, lengthening his spine, and there, that was the kind of thing they were after. “Great, ok, now if you just--”
Steve didn’t hesitate as much this time. His thrusts were long, deep, and even soon enough, and Tony was moaning with it, limbs curling around his alpha, the pleasure building up in him again.
“Yeah well, big, blond, ex-army artist wasn’t exactly a coincidence either,” Tony admitted. “I sort of figured it’d be like training wheels.”
“I have,” Tony replied, trying to hide his surprise. “I enjoyed it immensely. His thoughts on the possibility of space travel were fascinating, though I’m not so sure I agree with him about some of his more...
“Baaa-AAAAAAAAA,” Tony shouted, spilling between them and Stíofán grunted in triumph, pushing in fast and deep until he came inside,
Tony’s heart was pounding, but before he could say anything a bunch of SHIELD medics rushed in and put Steve onto a stretcher, shouting orders at each other. He could only watch as they carted him away, staying in his spot until a hand came down on his shoulder.
Steve nodded and when he looked back at Tony, he looked sheepish. “Ah, sorry about that. I should’ve just told the barman about it.”
“It’s kinda...on the roof?” Luis offered with a shrug. “We had a storm and the wind was like whooosh and the sign was swinging back and forth like crazy. And I was talking to Scott and he was like ‘damn, look at that sign’, and I was like ‘I know right?’, and then while we were watching the sign blew over until it was against the roof and now it’s stuck.”
Tony had rewarded Steve for his passionate stand for social justice as well: by tugging him into the alley outside and kissing him senseless.
Azari gave her a grin before jogging over to tap J.J on the shoulder. J.J spun around with a shout of excitement when he saw who was beside him and bear-hugged the crown prince of Wakanda.
Perhaps it was bad form to spend the afternoon knocking down targets instead of working, but well. No alpha could resist the opportunity to put their arms around their pretty omega to teach them a few new tricks. Steve held Tony against him as he muttered a few instructions in his ear, helping him get the timing right to hit more than one target in the air, shamelessly taking advantage of being able to breathe in his scent.
Both he and Tiberius looked up to see Tony standing there, placing the last of the bowls out. “Your breakfast. Should still be hot.”
He looked disappointed and Stíofán wanted to alleviate it. “Well, there’re three meals a day, so you’ll be well fed. I’m sure we can talk to the
There were six hits in total, and they must have hurt, but the sheriff just grit his teeth until he was done. His arm had long slashes of red on it, dark enough Tony feared they’d bruise.
Steve smiled encouragingly. “My Ma makes a nice sponge cake. I could write her for the recipe if you’re interested in trying it.”
Natasha showed him recipes for remedies that helped healing, beat infection, and helped reduce pain: everything that Steve would need. She made up some for him to take along, with instructions for making his own when he ran out. He was very grateful.
She stepped back into her room, closing the door and letting out a deep breath. Her chest felt a little tight.
He could've made it shorter, but he decided to take his time, stopping often along the way. He spent the night in Yosemite, walking the trails during the day and staring up at the Sequoias, feeling a sense of awe. The trees were older than him, by more than a hundred times over. They had come the long way around, seeing the world change around them with each passing year. All gathered together, the crawl of time nothing to them.
“An airship?” Now that was interesting. Not that Tony couldn’t already make things fly if he wanted to, but he’d be interested in getting a look at it, all those gears and inner workings. He felt that perhaps it was best not to mention the ‘make things fly’ bit. He had a feeling if he did they’d make him show Steve, and he didn’t want to say no to them after how kind they’d been, but he certainly didn’t want to do Steve any favours.
The man seemed to understand his question and held up a hand. “Ain’t that complicated. My grandson got married last year to a nice boy from the midwest. And he looked at my Bobby just like you look at our Tony.”
“You look-” The sheriff broke off with a hot puff of air as he moved across to the other. Tony snapped his eyes shut, trying to keep his breath even.
The noise became louder as they took off, Rhodey stepping forward to drag Tony a safe distance away, both of them staring up at Steve in shock.
“Yeah, you helped us, we can help you. And in return, if you want you can help us in the bakery until you start getting some magic clients of your own. Seem fair?”
“Fine, but I’m not putting him over knee in front of you animals. I’ll deal with my omega in private.” He took Tony’s wrist, pulling him behind him. The omega was too shocked at the turn of events to do anything but allow himself to be led.
Tony looked up, meeting Steve’s frustrated gaze. He had his hands braced on the back of the chair, the Rogers’ stubbornness on full display.
“It is, though more for Peter than for me. Mrs Stark was...not my choice. Not that she wasn’t a lovely woman, she was, but ours was a match made by our families. There was affection between us but no strong connection. We were both happy to live our lives as friends for the most part, and then it was decided we would try for a child. An heir for the estate and she wanted to be a mother, so it was for both our benefit. Although we were not in love, her loss was still a shock, and a miracle that Peter survived at all.”
“Dad! The extras bag is now four bags! It was meant to be for a few items we weren’t sure if I needed, not half the store!”
Now it was noisy and packed with people, yet somehow quiet and isolating. It felt like everyone was speaking another language and when he tried to make a connection it was like he was speaking gibberish.
Stíofán was pleased that the doe didn’t sound afraid, that even though he had to reek of aggression, Tony was leaning into his hand. “I might’ve done if he’d pressed his luck with you.”
Sam waved a hand. “We’ve kept it quiet. Didn’t want it to be a whole thing if we didn’t succeed, you know?
“Call it what you will.” She pointed at Bruce. “Lucky for you Bruce watered my plant anyway. So it’s fine.”
Tony surveyed his handiwork. There was a large crumb on the plate that made it look untidy, and without thought Tony picked it off, putting it in his mouth.
They stepped into the busy square, making their way to a fountain in the middle. Tony could feel butterflies in his stomach as he stepped up onto the lip of the fountain. “Hello!” he announced, as loud as he could, spreading his arms wide to show off his robes and the broom in his hand. “I have come to your city on my Witch’s Journey. I will be an asset to your town, and I bring my own form of spellwork: techmagic!” He waited, feeling the triumph of following the old traditions and making his mark flash through him. He was a proper witch, and he was going to--
Sam huffed from his other side. “So I hear Alpha Rogers talking. Now can I hear an actual plan from the Sheriff?”
She grinned. “Known the sheriff long enough to know he’d never raise a hand to an omega.” She watched him undo his cuff, whistling at the marks. “Those are gonna sting for a while.”
When they were gone, Steve put his hands on his hips. “You know I had respect in this town before you came along.”
“It’s really fine, I swear,” Tony offered, looking down at the mess on the floor. “We’re not going to be popular with the cleaning staff though.”
.” He stretched, a glint in his eyes and Stíofán had the distinct feeling he was being teased. “Apparently I must labour in the kitchens.” He looked at his silks upon the floor. “These will be hell to clean.”
“And let you work. Alright, I get it,” Stíofán snorted, then dipped down to kiss Tony one more time.
“You’re terrible to share a bed with! You’re all big and floppy and take up nearly all of the room! I lie at the edge clinging to the quilt so I don’t fall on the floor. And you snore! Like a grunting pig.”
He scanned the area trying to spot any flash of colour or movement that might indicate the presence of his wayward tutor, but there was nothing.
They sat down on Tony’s couch, sinking into the soft cushions and cradling the hot mugs in their hands. It was cozy, sitting together, Peter asleep and Dodger curled up by the heater.
He felt more than heard Tony stifle a snort, and Bradbury looked as though he had swallowed a lemon. Apparently, it was one straw too many, and Mr. Bradbury pulled free of his omega, pulled back a fist, and aimed at Steve.
Tony nodded, “Absolutely,” as he pulled out a small basket he didn’t use much and filled it with soft fabric scraps from his attempts at learning to sew. He settled the pup in and placed him next to the stove to keep warm. “Outside, you got it.”
“Sorry,” Tony offered, knowing it was a little presumptuous. “It’s just really great in here. I love the designs.”
He heard Bucky curse behind him and grinned, knowing they’d have his back. A guard looked up, but he didn’t have time to react before Steve planted his fist in the guy’s face.  He heard the sound of a gun going off, but Bucky, Sam, and the other men were there disarming people, while Mr Barton stayed at the top of the ridge with his rifle trained and ready.
“Worth a try,” Maria agreed. She caught Nakia’s eye. She was pretty sure she knew someone who could give the king a nudge.
“Enough!” They all turned to Steve who was sitting up on the bed, his chest heaving with exhaustion. “It’s fine, Nat, it was a misunderstanding.”
“Just as much as I guess he pointed me towards animals as a career. ‘Fluffy as fuck’ was a pretty good indicator.”
There was a sigh, and then Tony rocked forward as Steve grabbed the hem and pulled until Tony popped free.
“Alright, alright,” Rhodey laughed. “Guess I’m just trying to get the practice in.” He looked over at Sam who nodded. “We heard back from the adoption agency and they have a kid for us.”
Clearly Rhodey wasn’t the only soft one, Tony thought, and told him so, making Sam chuckle. “Hey don’t forget, I was also trained to kill, and I can fly fighter jets.”
“Ugh, don’t you just hate that?” Rich guy said, as there was a loud gasp. Tony looked in the direction of his scowl. It looked like two patrons had bumped into each other, and yup, there it was, the glow of a new bond. Christ.
S’Teve opted to continue. “You found it amusing that the Chancellor would believe us to be in a relationship. I confess, although I understood it logically, it seems it had more of a lasting impact than I initially believed.”
It needed to stop. He was wasting valuable time he should be using for scientific advancement or the performance of his duties on the ship, though how he was to achieve it, he wasn’t sure.
Because there he was. Tall, handsome, and blond, leaning up against the bar, in a pair of well-fitting jeans and a brown leather jacket. Captain America.
“Mr Rogers, what a delight to see you again. Perhaps you might fetch your husband. I’d like to speak to him.” The man dismounted, his hands clear of his gun, but Tony didn’t dare lower his own.
Steve seemed to notice the same thing, packing the things away in the basket. “Say, do you want to go and see the airship? It’s so cool. I go by everyday. We can ride my pushbike, and I can drop you home after.”
He stopped to tap in a clean-up request into the intranet on his phone and then tucked it into his pocket to head into the meeting.
Tony flushed hotly. Whoops, that had been a bit more honest than he’d intended. “Oh I’m sorry - I didn’t mean it. I just got het up about everything.”
“Headed to Chicago, then followed the old route 66 right across the country. St. Louis, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Santa Fe and a dozen others all the way to Los Angeles. I stopped when I was tired, checked out anything that took my interest and just...lived for a while.”
“I said, can I help you?” The cat’s mouth didn’t move, and Steve didn’t know why he expected it to. But then, he’d seen crazier stuff during the war…
He could feel his heart pounding in his chest with dread. Steve was going to wake up and be absolutely horrified.
The doe smiled and pressed a kiss to his jaw. “I love you too.” He slipped a hand around Stíofán’s arm and pointed. “Wash and bed, let’s go.”
“You’ll get fame and money no matter which way it goes, and you know it. More, If I put on a good show and you know I will. If I die, I want Tony freed.”
That seemed simple enough. Tony searched for a broom, eventually finding one hanging out on the back porch.
That was a very dangerous train of thought and Tony tried to shake it off. But he couldn’t help but steal glances all the way home, noticing Steve making sure to hold Peter securely for his sake, which did nothing to expel the warmth in Tony’s chest. Steve was so nice, and he was good with Peter and Tony
“Anything mechanical. I can usually at least give it a boost, make it work smoothly, that kind of thing.”
“No,” the doe said, and Stíofán felt his breath catch. “I won’t. Now leave. Stíofán will be here soon.”
“Perhaps,” Tony started, the warmth of the Sheriff’s arm beginning to soak into his skin, “you might call me Tony. It’s what my family calls me.”
Unfortunately though, fate seemed to have other ideas, and no matter how much he tried, he never managed to catch Steve in time to speak with him. When it got late, he dutifully caught a cab home, musing over his new idea for cat art therapy, even as his mind wandered, thinking of Steve Rogers and how delicious he looked in polyester. Not that it mattered, when was he ever going to bump into that guy again?
The sheriff gaped, apparently unable to find the words, and Tony huffed. “I’ve said my piece. I’m going home. Enjoy your night of debauchery.”
Hodges turned to look at him, fist drawn back and Rogers held by the shirt in his grip. “What do you want?”
Tony sat up, getting to his feet. “Can't say I have. But I’ll tell you what: why don’t you make an appointment with my PA and we’ll do lunch?”
Tony stayed where he was, pulling the blankets up to cover himself, heart pounding as Steve pulled on his breeches and went to answer the door.
That was...maybe a fair assessment. “I may have penned some concerns to him, yes. I never heard back though.”
The alpha was silent for a moment, and then his shoulders went back, and his face took on a determined look.
She beamed and then made her way back over to Vision, who was being treated by the Doctor who had clearly been called.
Rhodey shrugged, taking a long sip of his beer. “Come on, it’s super obvious why you hate soulmate stuff. You’re just worried you won’t find them, but you will.”
He’d pulled out the sketches in wonder, seeing himself from all different angles. There was him working, flying, helping out at the bakery. He looked so happy and bright, and magical, even though he wasn’t doing spellwork in any of them. He was sure he didn’t look like this in real life.
The Sheriff got a stubborn set to his jaw. “Daisy’s an old girl, and she’s better for the cart since she moves pretty slow. You need your own horse for when you want to go visiting or need to move quick. We’ll go tomorrow.”
“It is,” Tony smiled, pushing up his glasses as they slid down his nose. “I think maybe Dad even understood near the end. He left me his signed first edition of
She held the phone out and her brother took it, still rubbing his hair dry one-handed with a towel.  “Hi Nana.”
The first time he’d made that discovery, Tony had been left stared at the ceiling, still trying to get his breath back. “I don’t know how you did that. But we’re doing it again. Lots.”
Steve kept it up for a moment, and then relaxed, letting the grin spread over his face. “Can you do it backwards?”
“Dislocated arm isn’t a thing: that’s joints. And it’s just a minor sprain. The doctor says it’ll probably be fine by tomorrow.”
Tony picked up the other piece, unable to feel anything but despair, though he knew he should be grateful this was the worst of it. He considered walking around to the front of the bakery but the idea of having to face anyone felt like too much, so instead he jumped the fence and made his way up to his room unnoticed.
The line went silent, and Pierce turned towards Tony, anger writ across his face. He held down the button on the radio. “Team Two, check on Team One.”
“You got it,” Sam said. As Steve and Sam tied their hands, Tony made his way over to the two omegas. One was looking a little shaken, the other mad enough to spit.
“Ah. Dodger’s a mixed breed, so he’s two types of dogs. The shelter thought he was half boxer and half something else. Makes for twice the fun.”
He couldn’t wait any longer. He shoved in, sheathing himself in one push, making the doe gasp. He ran a hand over Antonius’ back to calm him, giving him a moment to adjust as he savoured the feeling around his dick. It was the closest thing to heaven Stíofán had ever experienced.
“I don’t know,” Steve answered honestly. He felt weirdly overwhelmed, like he’d forgotten how to make small talk. “Your shop just looked interesting. My bike broke down and the mechanic suggested I take a walk while he checked her over.”
“We do a community outreach on Thursday afternoons,” Tony explained as he cashed up the till. “We take some of the older cats to the retirement home and do a visit with the old folks. We take cake from the cafe and have a nice afternoon chatting and letting them pet the cats. You want to come?”
Tony laughed. “No I suppose it doesn’t. That was an accident.” He relaxed into his chair and took a sip of his coffee. “I found Jemison in an alley one day not long after I took over this place. I’d just formalised the deal with Rhodey to combine our businesses and I was taking out some trash when I heard her.”
Jarvis would tell him to be brave: he was sure of it. And so even though it was dark, he changed out of his cleaning grab, putting on his corset and town clothes. He tugged on his coat, fetched a lamp, and started the walk to town.
S’Teve was trying to process what Tony had just said, even as his brain pulled the memory forward. “You were injured by one of the Zenran weapons when they mistook us for spies.”
Tony tensed for a moment, but then he took a deep breath, likely catching Steve’s scent, and relaxed. He pushed himself up, turning to look at Steve.
“On Lanova,” he began, unsure if it was the correct course of action. “I heard you speaking to the Chancellor. He implied we were in a romantic relationship. You disagreed.”
“I had rather hoped that perhaps you might make an offer.” It was quiet, barely above a murmur but it sounded so loud in Tony’s ears. “But that...that is ridiculous. You have been kind to me, a good friend and employer, and I mistake your affection for more than it is, I understand that. I walked the grounds today to try and distance myself from my reactions to your presence, but instead I caused you great trouble, and missed Peter’s lessons,” he sniffled a little. “I hope my inappropriate feelings towards you won’t impact your decision to keep me as Peter’s tutor. He is a sweet boy and I would miss him greatly. As would I you, if I had to leave.”
“Wow, maybe you should invent a game. ‘Throw nuts’ or something, get it? Like ‘go nuts’ but projectile, then you might actually win.”
He’d felt fairly vindicated after the serum - when it had healed all his illnesses and weaknesses, but he still found fellas pleasing to the eye. Guess it wasn’t a sickness of the mind after all.
Steve lifted Tony’s hands to his lips and kissed his knuckles. Tony tried not to shiver at the sensation. “I’ll pack up my things and see myself out.”
He made the rounds with Jan speaking to a few people she pointed at - Jan knew everyone - and pretending to care about a canvas that was just painted blue or a drawing of a watermelon that supposedly represented the human struggle or whatever.
He knew he shouldn’t, but he was finding it a little hard to think, and when he opened his mouth, the words came without thought. “If I meet any I’ll let you know.”
“Et tu, Brute?” Tony asked, feigning hurt. “Here I am, caring for our young charge and all you do is mock me. I’m hurt, Cap. Hurt.”
“Alright, seems like it was a misunderstanding then,” Steve started, and he saw Tony’s eyes harden. “But one that is not acceptable. Mr Bullski I suggest you not attempt to discipline anyone else's children and instead take your concerns up with their parents.”
“I’d say you made an impression, and really that’s key for a job interview,” Tony joked and Steve gave him a dirty look. “Really - it made you memorable.”
Ok, no, it was a lot stranger. But that’s fine. People were in danger. They needed his help, and he was going to provide. And then he guessed he’d give in, and agree to live at the SHIELD compound.
“Watch your step there, Mr Rogers,” Bucky said, the amused smile on his face dropping away as he took in Tony’s harried appearance and the bundle in his arms. “Woah, what’s happened?”
His eyes burned and he rubbed a hand roughly over his face. He couldn’t cry. He wasn’t going to do that. It wouldn’t help.
Deciding it would be too easy for them to call his bluff, he chose truth. “My husband is not here. I suggest you leave.”
“I think I’m finally getting acquainted with this way of living,” Tony said, perching on the Sheriff’s chair. “It was tough at first, just with everything so different, but I like the change of pace now that I’m used to it.” He grinned. “And Sheriff Rogers has been teaching me to shoot.”
He was worried about him. Tony felt a flush of warmth and leaned in. “I’m sorry. Next time I rescue someone, I’ll be sure to be quick about it.”
Tony enjoyed them, confiding to Stíofán that he had never seen much outside his parents’ house or the Stables. Kept locked away to ensure he’d be primed for marriage. It made Stíofán sad. He may be locked up now, but he’d been free, and when he had, he’d been happy.
Steve struggled to his feet, yelping as his ankle gave way and he tumbled to the ground. He’d only meant to go for a nice walk, get some fresh air and get Mr Stark’s handsome face out of his mind.
Tony wasn’t a genius for nothing. It was obvious to him why. If Steve were here, he would’ve already noticed Tony was out of sorts. But Steve wasn’t here, and he was just going to have to get used to his absence.
“I don’t really care,” Tony told him, the anger radiating off him. “It’s almost as if listening to a homicidal maniac’s monologue doesn’t really do it for me.”
“Exactly. And trust me, Stevie is going to love that you can fly. Trust me. He loves flying and he’s always wanted to. You know that airship down by the port? You must’ve seen it when you flew in. He’s
So Steve spent the rest of the afternoon learning about ants, watching them scurry about the model city and somehow managed to hit the road without any further souvenirs.
Then Steve took off down the street, his brain already formulating a plan of attack. This was what he was made for, this was his job and his responsibility. He was here to fight bullies and look out for the little guy.
Tony unpacked all he was able to and freshened up using the jug and basin he found in the room. By the time he was done, the sun was starting to dip, and he emerged into the main room to find the Sheriff heating something delicious smelling on the stove.
He should stop. It was only polite. But he found himself drifting lower, around Steve’s belly, near the top of his hip bones. He could feel the heat starting in his cheeks, but he didn’t relent.
Peter was a heavy weight in his arms, the ache in his shoulders becoming sharp and biting, but he didn't dare stop. He couldn't stop, not until he reached the town and got help. He saw the big tree to the right that told him he was almost halfway, and he felt a heady combination of relief and disappointment. Relief that he was making some headway and that he was closer to town, but disappointment there was still so far to go.
Steve watched them drive off until they turned the corner down the main street and then he hurried to his horse. He didn’t want to be away from them any longer than he had to.
Tony continued trying to do up the overly complicated toggles in front of him. Seriously, why were kids’ clothes so difficult?
She and Dad had made her bed up, unpacked some of her clothes and arranged her toiletries. It made the room a lot less bare and a bit more welcoming.
Hodge scowled. “I will have my pound of flesh. In fact, you know what? I’ve changed my mind. If your husband won’t speak to me, then I guess we’ll have to take you with us. Give him a reason to come find me.”
It just had such gravitas, and a kind of elegance that planes just didn’t have. He could see why the town was so excited.
There was a shout from below and they broke apart to see Rhodey and Sam pointing up at them, little Riri balanced on Rhodey’s shoulders and shrieking with joy as she pointed at them.
“Hey pumpkin!” Dad called from the kitchen. He had his sleeves rolled up and he was leaning against the kitchen island messing around with one of his work tablets. He spotted J.J coming in behind her. “I mean pumpkins. How was school?”
“I see. Well, in that case, I guess I should uphold my end of the deal.” Tony downed the remainder of his drink in one swallow and gave Rhodey a wave as he pointed to the door. Rhodey gave him a wink and a thumbs-up before turning back to watch the game that was playing on the big screen. Tony gave Steve a heated glance holding out his hand. “Shall we?”
When he was happy his work was done, he put the jar into the tray and set them down away from them both. He shouted out to Bucky. “Deputy, grab his legs and on my count, pull him free.”
Steve yelped, jumping to his feet and stripping off his shirt to stop it soaking through. Tony swallowed as an expanse of skin and wiry muscle was revealed.
“You got it, Sheriff.” Tony grabbed a little dish for water and a few scraps of meat from dinner to feed the pup, who wolfed them down eagerly.
Tony chewed on the root, the colour slowly coming back to his face and he held out his arms for the kids. “Come here, my babies.”
“That sounds nice,” Steve agreed, looking at the setting sun. “I think I like keeping two feet on the ground though, got all I need right here.”
He hurried to put the broom away and opted to drag the mattress back inside, putting the new sheets on it and making it as per the instructions. When it was done it looked neat enough, he thought, though not as smooth as Ana’s. But really, the alpha had never seen Ana’s expert skill, so likely he wouldn’t know.
It would’ve been easier on horseback – much faster too – but he had never ridden before, and he didn’t know the first thing about saddling a horse. So, on foot then.
“Alright, you said you didn’t want to talk about it, so we won’t.” He dug a spoon into his oatmeal awkwardly but then seemed to recover. “I thought perhaps I could take you on a proper tour of the town? We only really saw the station and the town hall, but there’s more to it if you like.”
Peter had climbed down while he’d been speaking and had gone to play on the swings, which made Tony’s shoulders relax.
Tony watched him leave with a sigh of relief. “Thank you, sir. I wasn’t sure how to get him to leave.”
“I love you,” Tony muttered against his lips. “So much. And I’m sorry. Sorry, I couldn’t keep him safe, I--”
So he said nothing. He took the basket with his thanks and rode home on Ana, meeting Deputy Barnes at the house when he arrived.
There was no answer, and Tony could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears as he began to dig. It took him longer than he was comfortable with to see the familiar red, white and blue underneath the rubble, his hands scratching frantically at the rest of the debris until -
“Military?” Tony asked, and Steve’s head shot up, wondering if he’d given too much away. “My best friend Rhodey was the same when he got his medical discharge. It takes time to readjust.”
He handed over the parcel, which Tony accepted with genuine pleasure. “You and your omega are most kind. Thank you.”
The click of the door told him it was futile to attempt to leave, since Tony would never be less than thorough, though he did consider simply breaking the door down with his above-human strength.
There was a hum of agreement. “Tony. It’s nice,” the alpha replied, a pleased tone to his voice. “And in return, would it be too much trouble for you to call me Steve? I may be the Sheriff out here, but at home, I’m just plain old Steve.”
For a moment, he thought he’d miscalculated and he would be gored, trapped against the wall of the arena. But instead, the manticore chirped, and it spread its wings to their fullest extent. They beat down, lifting the beast into the air, and Stíofán reached out, swiping a feather from the wing as the beast launched itself into the air and took to the skies with a loud, cawing shriek.
They managed a few more hours until the call came for wake up. Tony seemed better, helping in the kitchens and eating his breakfast as normal. The colour was back in his cheeks and he chattered to Stíofán, giving him a kiss when he left for training.
“Sure. Might take time to get people to trust it, but you just need a few customers to get you started and spread it through word of mouth.”
He heard the hoofbeats behind him, but he didn't turn around. He trusted Sam and Bucky were with him, along with a few other volunteers they sometimes relied on when they needed to form a posse.
Tony’s illness had also thankfully cleared up, and he was back eating well which made Stíofán feel better too, though he was growing more nervous as the games approached.
The omega smiled, a mocking twist to his lips. “I was as shocked as anyone to see Mr Rogers remove his corset
He looked at the options, deciding a loaf of bread and some of the preserves in the bottom of the cabinet might be a good bet and grabbing a sausage roll for Jarvis so he could have the meat inside. When he reached the front of the queue, the man behind the counter smiled. “What can I get you?”
Perhaps he’d been wrong about Maybe-George - and he should definitely check his phone for the guy’s actual name - but being able to date someone who wasn’t holding out for a soulbond could be a really nice change.
Maria didn’t need to hear the other side of the call to know her nana was giving him sass. “Let me talk to her.”
“Ah, Mr Stark,” the man grinned, sending a shiver down Tony’s spine. “You’ll be unsurprised to find he’s here for you. Seems you owe him something.”
It all poured out, and Tony felt a relief at the release in pressure. He didn’t even realise he was shaking slightly until Steve took his hand, pulling him in for a hug.
“Happy to if that’s ok,” Steve said, checking with Tony. “Bucky’s kid says I’m the best with voices.”
John chuckled. “Your boy knows his stuff. It’s nice to see the younger generation knows more than how to stare at their phone.”
Tony felt himself blush. “Thank you, sir.” It was kind of the man to compliment him even after a disastrous coupling.
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Well, you may want to learn to get faster out here. Cold stew isn’t nearly as pleasant, and we’ll be eating a lot of it.”
Steve kissed him hungrily, and Tony grasped desperately at his shoulders, hanging on for the ride. He felt hands slip under his thighs and suddenly he was airborne, held tight against Steve’s chest. There was that super strength in action.
When he joined the Sheriff on the porch, the man was almost bashful. “Anthony, you look - well, I’d say there’s not a finer looking omega anywhere.”
He finally had everything he wanted, and he had never been more happy to have placed his ad in that catalogue.
Tony gritted his teeth. “I’m not as fussy as all that. I take keeping my house seriously, you know.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” Sarah Rogers said, looking worried but amused. She was still in her scrubs, having clearly run over from the hospital. “I just wanted to make sure my son hadn’t rattled his brains while he was out playing superhero.”
“DOGGY!” Tony turned to watch Peter sprint off towards a big brown and white dog with fluffy ears, and his heart leapt in his throat.
“I’m hot dada,” Peter mumbled, his voice raspy and sore-sounding, and Tony redraped a freshly cooled cloth on his head. He grabbed a cup of water from the table, helping Peter to take small sips.
Jarvis had sent for the doctor on his return and he’d taken over getting the man out of his wet clothes and into bed. Tony had fought his own urge to help by going to find Peter who, though undeniably pleased at the prospect of no more lessons for the day, was upset to hear his teacher had been hurt.
When he got closer though, he felt his stomach drop and his body tighten in panic as he caught sight of Steve lying on the ground, with a truly distressing amount of blood spilling over his belly.
Tony kept his mouth shut, the speech Steve gave any time anyone asked about the dirigible sitting on his tongue. He’d definitely absorbed way too much airship info.
He grinned down at the shield on his arm, and armour on his chest. It was every bit as good as Tony had said, and he felt a swell of pride. He was wearing armour handmade by his doe, who cared for him enough to make him near invincible. He had no plans of losing now.
“Nothing so grand: just lay amongst the dirt waiting for the ambush. Caught myself on a few rocks.” He hissed as Tony pressed on a bruise. “Alright, that one might’ve been a lucky shot by one of the Slug Gang.”
“Thank you.” There was a depth of gratitude there, and Steve had the feeling that Rhodey had spent a lot of time dealing with his slightly reckless best friend.
They agreed on a decent rate, with a generous tip should the work be completed to the farmer’s satisfaction. Tony managed to wait until he’d left before hopping around in excitement.
He could see two doors, one closed and one ajar to reveal what Tony assumed would be their bedroom. The Sheriff wandered in, carrying Tony’s luggage and placing it inside.
He had just put his purchases in his saddle bags when he heard a commotion up the street. He squinted to see what was happening but couldn’t make it out. There were people crowding around in a circle, and he could hear shouts. He untied Ana and wandered over, curious as to what could have everyone in such a tizzy.
Tony nodded, wanting to see his pup more than anything. He kissed Steve again, grateful as ever that he had him. Everything was going to be ok.
They waited for a moment, and when everything fell silent, Pierce grinned. “There. No one shall stand in our way. Come we’ll take Stark to the--”
Mr Stark slid off his horse, face lined with concern as he got near. “What in the devil are you doing? It’s freezing out here.”
“True enough.” Sam grabbed a tray of bread. “Can you take that out front? I bet we’re due a restock.”
Steve perked up. “I do, I had it back in London during the- uh during a vacation there.” He remembered eating the dessert with custard in a BnB he and the Howlies had stayed at during a 48-hour leave. It had been strange at first, but it had grown on him, and he’d had it a few times during his time in England.
Tony thought about pretending to be asleep. But if he was about to be told he was going to be sent home in disgrace, perhaps he ought to know sooner rather than later.
Tony was grateful for Jarvis’ warmth against his chest as they curled up, waiting for the morning light.
A number of the residents smiled at his arrival, a few giving little waves, Steve trailing behind him pushing the trolley with the carriers carefully stacked. He tried to keep a friendly smile on his face, but all he could see was his true age reflected back at him.
Tony knew, truer than anything, that if he went with this alpha something awful would happen. He felt every hair on his body stand on end, and he fought to remain calm.
“So please, can we get past this? Because you’re really good in bed and I really like you a lot, and I’d like to take you out to pancakes now.”
“Yes, yes, and now you’re a devoted father of two married to the love of your life, I know, I was there at the wedding and in the waiting room, and you’re so full of love you might burst.”
So Tony got to watch Steve and Peter play legos while he cooked, laughing when Dodger would walk through their structure and knock it over, clearly enjoying the game. And when they sat down to dinner, it felt warm and intimate.
The kiss deepened, and Tony let himself push a little. He shifted forward, his thigh brushing the Sheriff’s, and making the alpha twitch.
“On your knees,” Steve commanded, and all three dropped to the floor. Hodge looked angry, angrier than a hive of bees, even as he went red with coughing beneath what Tony realised must’ve be the cocoa.
When the peak finally came, Tony slumped forward, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and pressing his face into his neck as he panted. Steve knotted easily, the stimulation of Tony’s twitching muscles enough to push him over the edge. He held Tony tight, murmuring praise into his ear, and once they were locked together, he laid them down, pulling the covers over to keep away the chill.
The doe was curled up on the palate, waiting patiently, his shift back in place. Stíofán a little twinge of arousal at the idea that he was back to looking so demure given what they had just done, but it was too early for anything further yet. Stíofán sat down beside him, handing him the bowl. “Here, I bet you’re hungry.”
--be totally ignored by everyone in the square. No one even gave him more than a glance as he stood there, grinning like an idiot, holding a broom aloft. He waited a moment to see if it was just surprise holding them back, but it soon became clear it was not awe. It was disinterest, pure and simple.
The band was already playing, and the place was bustling with townsfolk. Tony got many looks, some admiring, some tinged with envy, but that hardly mattered, because he had the handsomest Alpha in town. Steve cleaned up nice in his good slacks and dark blue waistcoat and jacket. The cut accentuated his broad shoulders and narrow waist, and Tony felt pleased they were such a handsome pair.
“No, no, no, don’t you-- eeek!” Tony clung to him as Stíofán lifted him into the air, spinning him until the faun shrieked with laughter.
He tugged Tony’s shift over his head, letting Stíofán get a good eyeful of the smooth chest and perky nipples. He let his hands run over the newly revealed skin, thumbs rubbing against the bare expanse.
“Gods,” Stíofán cursed, hurrying over to push the poles away as Bucky hurried to the other side to help uncover them. He could hear the sounds of approaching hooves but all he could focus on was getting the kids free.
Tony was… gorgeous. He looked like he walked right off the silver screen half the time, and scruffy and ridiculous the other, and Steve couldn’t get enough of him either way. He hadn’t expected it, but their first meeting in the helicarrier had stirred Steve up in all kinds of ways, his instincts reacting to the powerful, hot alpha in front of him in a way he knew meant they were compatible.
“I know. But isn’t it better to be safe here than out in some dusty, rundown old shack in the middle of nowhere?”
“Not that one no,” Sam grinned. “I made him actually choose her properly. But he’d basically been visiting shelters since his words appeared, and he’d just gotten more…cavalier in his opening line.”
She looked curious, but politely didn’t try and delve further. “How lovely. What have you seen so far?”
The only things he got invited to were Stark Magics events or the houses of witch kids from other families, who invited him to try and get the free witchcraft supplies his father always sent with him. He didn’t think he’d ever been invited to a party just for the sake of it. It had always just been him and Jarvis.
“Yeah ok. I’m sorry for making you worry.” He brushed a hand through his hair. “So do you guys have any info about the kid?”
“You couldn’t have known. Pups go downhill quick, but they bounce back fast too. Just gotta keep him cool and give him the tonic and hope for the best.”
“No, no problem, I just-” The alpha seemed embarrassed, taking off his hat and holding it to his chest. “I’m Sheriff Steve Rogers. I think you’ve been waiting for me.”
Tony burst out laughing, waving a hand at him. “Jesus, don’t hurt yourself. It’s fine, I get what  you mean. It’ll be nice to see you again too.”
Tony relaxed into the armchair across from Steve and settled in to listen. “Maybe it was,” he agreed with a smile. That was a nice thought.
Tony moaned, rocking his hips as he did. He started a fast rhythm, bouncing on Stíofán’s cock and panting as he worked them both closer to completion.
“It’s so much,” Antonius moaned, rising up and down faster. Stíofán wondered if his tail was wagging. He hoped it was.
And Tony...well, Tony was gorgeous. Well toned, soft, dark hair that Steve wanted to run his fingers through. He was shorter, just a bit, enough that if Steve took him in his arms he could wrap him up safe and tuck him under his chin. And his eyes.
Tony scowled. “There’s molten metal! Rhodey can’t work if he’s having to constantly check one of them isn’t underhoof.”
He led them out, ignoring the man cursing behind him, and followed till they were a far distance away.
“Right? This is way better than the stuff we were invited to see.” There wasn’t a placard, but Tony saw a signature at the bottom.
“He’s pinned beneath part of the cart, if we just try to pry it off, the whole thing could collapse. I’m going to use a horse and pulley over that beam to hold it steady and then disconnect parts of it so we can pull him free without shifting the weight of the load on the back. If we try to remove the load, the whole cart could collapse.”
He happened to look over and see a sign for a bookstore and felt the familiar draw of a paperback in his hands. Before he knew it, almost without his permission his feet had carried him inside.
That was a good question. Tony thought for a moment and then snapped his fingers. “Don’t worry, Cap. I have a cunning plan.”
Tony caught sight of the omegas he’d overheard gossiping watching closely from the sidelines. He realised they wouldn’t have seen the alpha dance before, and they certainly wouldn’t have gotten to dance with him.
Steve paused then, turning back to him with a thoughtful look before he came around the side of the bed and dusted a kiss to Tony’s knuckles. “I’ll see you soon. Lock the door once I’m gone.”
“Seems to me my omega reacted instinctively to protect our boy. I’m sure anyone can understand that.”
She was just typing up a reply when a second photo appeared of a terrified looking guy being patted on the shoulder by Thor.
The omega turned back to look at Sam, a wide pleased smile on his face, his face turning guilty when he caught sight of Steve. “Oh, Sheriff!”
Rhodey stared at him and Tony huffed. “Alright fine, that’s stupid. Oh my god, what if they-” Tony trailed off.
“It is customary to offer visiting parties a chance to take part in one of our match-making ceremonies. Non-binding, unless the two individuals find the match acceptable, of course.” The last part was said with a sly tone, and S’Teve heard Tony laugh in response.
“Ok,” Stíofán said, giving Tony a nuzzle. He tucked a leg over Tony’s, feeling warm when Tony clicked their hooves together. “Just a few more weeks. Then this’ll all be over.” One way or another.
“A witch?” Steve looked interested then, and that made Tony madder. So it was ok to be rude to him, but if he was a witch he deserved basic human decency? No thank you.
Tony bit his lip. “It’s not that they wouldn’t have. It’s just...it would’ve been a failure, you know? Witches are meant to be able to do this on their own, and if I’d screwed up on the first day it would’ve been embarrassing. I think my mom would’ve been ok with it, but my dad? He runs one of the most prominent magic suppliers in the community. If everyone found out I needed help, he would’ve been really disappointed.”
He lay down on his pallet, watching as Tony washed his face with water and then curled up alongside him. He figured he would go without a blanket, though a chill was settling in. Instead, Tony flicked the blanket out and covered them both, moving so his back was flush with Stíofán’s. It was warm and intimate, and Stíofán fell asleep quickly.
“And do you know what else?!” Tony snapped angrily, poking a finger into the Sheriff’s chest. “You’re terrible to share a bed with!”
“S’alright,” The Sheriff rumbled. He kissed Tony again and gave him a sweet smile that made Tony feel
He went for it, mounting Tony hard and deep, the satisfaction running through him. He ducked down so he could speak into Tony’s ear. “I miss having you like this. Remember, when you were big, round with my kids, and I would take you in the woods just. Like. This?” he punctuated the words with thrusts and Tony whined into the bedding making Stíofán grin.
So Stíofán told the tale, with his mate on his knee and his kids at his feet and a roaring fire behind them keeping them all toasty as the cold winds blew outside. And if his hand came down to squeeze one of the rounded cheeks that had plumped so well with the rigour of village life and the hearty food; well, only a certain faun knew.
He was also... aesthetically pleasing. The tips of S’Teve’s pointed ears increased in temperature when he thought of it, watching Tony strip off his red uniform shirt to allow him to work in some of the tighter spaces of the ship, sweat shimmering on his well-formed muscles. It was a fact, nothing more. Tony had a mostly symmetrical face, with well-maintained facial hair and eyes of a rich brown hue. These traits were often considered attractive in male humans, and S’Teve, as a scholar of Federation species, noticed them in turn.
Tony had ridden into town that morning planning to pick up some supplies he was short of and to visit Mrs Barton on his way home. They weren’t firm friends yet, but he was working on it, and she was very kind.
“I suppose you’re- Five?!” Tony squawked, then lowered his voice. “You better hope that’s not true or I’ll kick you out of my bed till we’re old and grey.”
Steve blanched, remembering the last time he’d asked her for help on a photoshoot and ended up getting a treatment that might as well have been torture for how much his skin had ached afterwards. “Oh no.”
“Oh.” The sound was quiet, and Tony didn’t dare move, even as he longed to see the expression on Steve’s face. “So, uh, you know who I am?”
Steve looked at Tony, gesturing with the clothes.  “Lifts and a padded suit. The serum was meant to make you know," he gestured tall with his hands," and pretty much invincible, but it just made me super strong and means I heal fast. The suit makes me seem more intimidating and keeps my identity safe.” He shrugged. “Had to ditch some of it to wriggle through the vents.”
“Oh,” Steve said, his voice soft and before Tony could say anything more, there was a soft gold glow taking over them and Tony’s chest hurt with how happy he was. He reached out blindly, wanting contact, any contact, and when Steve’s hand intertwined with his, he swore he heard a choir sing.
Tony rolled over so they were facing each other and kissed Steve, deep and sweet, feeling warm and safe in his arms.
Stíofán found himself losing focus as Tony detailed how to make armour and swords, and wondered just how much time he’d spent watching the armour maker.
Tony sighed as he pushed in, ready for him, the slide smooth and easy. The doe groaned pleasingly at being filled, and it made Stíofán feel powerful. He began to thrust in and out, pressing himself right along Tony’s back, their fur mingling as their legs rubbed together. They looked good together, Stíofán thought idly. His pale gold against Tony’s black and white.
Steve rumbled an agreement, unsure why he hadn’t mentioned it already. It didn’t matter though, now Tony knew, and he got to hold Tony, so really it was a win-win.
Tony felt a little thrill at the use of his new name. It would take some getting used to. “I would like nothing more.”
Tony grinned. “Ok! And hey maybe I could--” he wiggled his fingers, “give it a boost when you’re done. Free of charge.”
Steve shook the Doc’s hand when they arrived at the surgery, letting Tony in ahead of him to see Peter for himself.
Hodge growled. “I’m getting damn sick of you interfering any time we try to have some fun. You got your omega. What gives you the right to interfere with me finding mine?” He smirked at the basket on Steve’s arm. “Maybe it’s just that you're jealous I can get one of these, while yours seems to have you under his thumb.”
“Hey darling, miss me?” There was barely any hesitation before an apparently very overwrought omega tumbled into his arms and buried his face in his neck. He wrapped his arms around him tight, feeling Tony shudder and hearing the tell-tale sniffling sounds of the tears he was trying to hide.
Tony led him through into the cafe, waving to a tall man behind the counter with a kind smile. This must be Rhodey - Steve could see the remnants of a soldier’s posture and a keen alertness of everything in the room. When Rhodey’s eyes fell on him, there was a flash of recognition of the same he assumed, because the man nodded to him, something like understanding in his eyes.
“Just the culmination of two months of planning and negotiations,” Steve said, sounding amused. “Carol’s going to be my new Deputy. She’ll take on half the posse call-outs we get with Bucky.”
“Hey, quit being so grumpy,” Rhodey admonished. “Clearly you and Steve didn’t meet on the best of terms, but I promise he’s nice.”
Steve flushed at that. “Not entirely. I told her in my last letter I’d met someone but didn’t give all the details. She was excited by the news though, so I don’t imagine she’ll take any offence to the idea once she meets you.”
So Tony did. He told Stíofán about growing up in Aquleina. He came from a wealthy, old family in the area, who had hoped to make a strong political marriage of Tony to one of the magistrates, but his condition had made itself known, word had spread quickly, and Tony’s parents had made a choice they thought would best help his future. He didn’t seem to blame them which was odd and Stíofán queried it.
“Truth be told, I find it easier with mechanical things.” Tony trailed his hand over a small propeller. “My magic, it makes machines fulfill their purpose to the best of their ability. So, if I build something that is meant to fly, it...flies.”
“Stíofán doesn’t need to know. You let me wet my wick behind the kitchen wall and I’ll pay you well.” His voice went low and coaxing. “Everyone knows Stíofán wants to get out, what will you have when he’s gone? Surely earning a few coins on your knees wouldn’t do any harm?”
Steve shook his head in surprise. “Should you not inform Mr Rhodes of the theft of his possessions?”
Steve felt his face heat at the thought of what Bucky - or god forbid, Pepper - might consider a sexy costume. “Who made you the expert?” he asked faintly, and Bucky shrugged.
Steve flushed. “I just wanted to get you something special. You’re always surprising me with all these great presents and trips away, I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate it and how much I love you.”
“That ought to teach you,” Steve said, raising his voice a little and giving Tony a wink. He rolled his sleeve back down, hiding the evidence, and opened the door to let them out.
S’Teve felt a flush of something he couldn’t immediately identify. Shame, he realised. He was prying, for his own gain. “Of course. I apologise.”
He took over, undressing them both with nimble fingers, Tony groaning as the cool air hit bare skin. Steve hoped it was just the stress. He wasn’t sure he could handle it if Tony fell ill too.
Tony managed to get moving, and he followed after them, watching as they took his husband inside the building. He followed inside without any thought, only to be blocked by Deputy Barnes.
right? And then he outsmarts everyone, and he works harder than anyone else, and not only is he the only one who works out how to reach the flag like he’s Mulan or something, he literally throws himself on a grenade. A LITERAL GRENADE. Sure it was a dud, but he didn’t know that! And he wanted to help other people so much he agreed to an experimental treatment that was more likely to kill him than work. He’s a hero, and that’s before he got the superpower steroids.” Tony was pacing and gesturing wildly by this point but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “And then he wakes up in the future, which not everyone knows but there are a few benefits to being the grandson and son of the guys who funded the searches, and even though it has to be tough, he gets back out there to save the world. Captain America is the best.”
Tony snorted, his hands covering his face, and Stíofán found himself charmed as he watched him turn red with laughter, the sound muffled.
Antonius looked at him curiously, and Stíofán felt compelled to explain. “I’m a slave, not a citizen.”
The bell above the door rang and Steve looked up to see a man in a thick jacket, torn in several places and Steve could see his hand clenching and unclenching from under the sleeve. It put him on edge, even if he couldn’t immediately tell why. It was just another customer most likely, maybe he was the sort who felt anxious talking to people or was having a rough day but it felt like more than that. The way his eyes flitted around the store as if looking for something kept Steve’s attention even as he pretended not to watch.
“It is a simple question. As a senior officer, if you are engaging in… intimacy with another crew member, it is important for the command team to be aware of it to ensure it meets Starfleet regulations.”
“Well, I mean, nothing is impossible obviously, we have enough experience to know that, but unlikely, sure.”
Stíofán grunted as the passage tightened around him, always so slick and warm. Truly no buck could be luckier than him. “That’s it. Let me feel that tail wag, sweet thing.”
But there had been a moment, just a single moment, when he’d hugged Pepper and then she’d turned and been scooped up by Rhodey, and they’d been so in love it had felt like an actual punch in the gut.
Tony gave Dummy a light kick of his heels to urge him on as they shot along the boundary looking for any sign of the wayward tutor. He was starting to get more fearful, if Mr Rogers was not here, then where?
Tony held out a hand, putting on his best spy glare. “If even one of its leaves is out of place when I get back I will displace your kidney.”
“I’m sure I can do that for you, sir.” He knelt down to put the jack in place. “Won’t take me a minute.”
He launched off, feeling the magic flow through him and propel the broom into the air. As the lights of his village disappeared into the distance, Tony felt a surge of anticipation. This was his chance. He was going to show the world what his magic could do.
The number of dating apps strictly for unbonded wanting to meet was pretty low, though Tony was a member of all the main ones.
Tony stood on the street, the afternoon air suddenly cold. He was shaking, he realised, but he couldn’t seem to make himself stop.
“Steve!” His head turned frantically, trying to catch sight of him, but there was no familiar flash of blond, no strong hand in his. He let himself be herded until he could break free, climbing up on the plinth of a statue to give himself some height. Now he could see the Avengers had arrived, along with Spiderman, to fight some green figure on a flying scooter. He could see the Hulk scaling the building, and there was Hawkeye on the skyscraper, notching an arrow. He wondered where--Oh! There he was.
“The Sheriff just stepped out to deal with some ruckus. He won’t be long though. You can sit at his desk and wait for him.”
“I’ve never knowingly punched a septuagenarian, but you are making it really hard not to start,” Tony growled. “Get out.”
“Yes,” she sighed. “We have to leave in like half an hour, I don’t know why he couldn’t just skip it. He’s usually the organised one.”
Half of this job was popularity and as much as he hated it, he knew he couldn’t afford to shun it. He gave a few poses for laughs and appreciative stares, but as he courted the cheers of ‘
S’Teve sighed. Expending the energy to hide it was less efficient than simply telling Tony the truth. “You said on Lanova that we were not romantically involved, and I started to consider that perhaps I wished we were.”
