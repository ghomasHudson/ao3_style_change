“Well, after awhile, people volunteered to join him. Including us. It's mainly families we bring back now, with children close to presenting. Ellen and a few other people on the medical staff over see that. The parents don't have to live in fear of their children presenting as Alphas here.” Alec told him.
Everyone relaxed and followed Ellen inside. “Be easy on him boys. If bust open those stitched, heaven help you.”
Cas ended the call and put his phone back in his pocket. He picked up his things and took some deep, calming breaths in an attempt to will his erection away.
He walked to the mess hall, making his hands into fists. He walked inside over to the line. He grabbed Alec and spun him around, growling an inch from his face. “If you ever touch him again...”
"I know what I fucking saw Charlie. I'm not blind. I should have known better. I'm too screwed up for him and he found someone better."
"Fuck, finally." Cas removed his foot and slipped his show back on. Dean took a couple of deep breaths and made an attempt to compose himself, suddenly really glad he had brought a jacket in with him. He straightened himself in his seat.
Cas was able to enjoy this treatment for several more minutes when he felt a sudden pressure at the base of his dick, simultaneously with another flick of Dean's tongue at his slit. "Damn.... Dean.... Mmmm…." Dean noticed that Cas' rhythm had faltered. His moans changed into small, high-pitched gasps. Dean smiled and did it again. Cas slipped down the wall a little as his knees buckled.
Later that night, they all went out to dinner. Sam brought Jess along. She was very pretty with long blonde hair and blue eyes. She was perfect for Sam and seemed to fit in well with the family. Cas and Jess seemed to get along as well which made both boys happy.
“Dean would go out, sometimes not coming back for a few weeks, gathering people and bringing them here. This was the first Alpha safe haven.” Alec said.
"You have no idea." Cas moved toward Dean and kissed him, taking Dean's erection in his hand and stroked him slowly. Dean sucked in a breath. He was close just listening to Cas as he got off. His eyes slipped closed and he bit his lip, a moan still escaping. "Fuck Cas..."
Cas grabbed his boxers and put them on under the blanket. He got up, ran across the room and grabbed their phones, pushing past them.
Cas looked around. "Yeah, it's all fine it's just that... the last time I was in this car I woke up in the backseat with no clothes on."
"Dunno what you're talking about." Dean said as he hit the cue ball. It hit the balls and scattered them across the table.
Five minutes later, they were putting Cas in the ambulance. Dean didn't even notice the cop next to them until he spoke. "Is there someone you can call to get the bike?" Dean didn't answer right away. He continued to watch as they the paramedics hooked Cas up to an IV. "Yeah, my uncle. He owns the salvage yard in town" He said finally, still not looking away from Cas. The cop put his hand on Dean's shoulder. "Are you two following the ambulance? I'll need to ask a few questions when you get there." They closed the doors of the ambulance. Dean just kept his arm around Charlie and waled to the Impala, ignoring the cop. He opened the door for Charlie and walked around to the driver side, getting in and starting the car. The two stayed silent the whole ride to the hospital.
"Call it payback." Dean pressed the heel of his hand on the base of Cas' cock, rubbing outward slowly.
"Okay, now one of you two." Mary said. Cas pulled Dean close then at the last second, turned Dean's head and kissed him. The kiss lasted longer than it should have. Cas pulled away and looked at Mary. "Put that one on your mantle." He smiled.Mary beamed. "Had already planned on it!"
"How dare you!" Zachariah unfolded his arms. "How dare you make such accusations! I have always looked out for Castiel's best interests!"
The Omega nodded, closing the door. He took the Alpha by the hand and led him through the small living quarters, stopping at the sleeping area. The Alpha looked at him questioningly. The Omega grabbed a bag and threw clothes inside, then moved to the kitchen area and grabbed some food, also throwing it in the large backpack.
"Yes Castiel, that's why we couldn't find you. Someone must have been slipping the checks out to them."
“Yeah well fuck him if he does. If he hurts them, so help me…” Dean sat back down, looking through his binoculars.
After school, Cas met with the band at the underground and they got to work on the song. They definitely wanted a fast paced song that everyone could get into. Cas played a chord. "Da-da" pause "da-da" pause da-da pause da-da da-da da-da. "Wait, play that again." Adam said. Cas repeated what he just played. Jeff joined on drums, following Cas' lead.
Charlie clapped her hands. "Well, I'm gonna leave you two alone then. See you soon." Dean looked over at Charlie.
"That's why I'm going to have to go to the studio while on my vacation. I'm always working. But it's how you move forward and make your brand."
"Or, not talk. I could do a lot of not talking." He massaged Dean with his foot again, not stopping this time. Dean finally gave up and hung his head, closing his eyes and groaning quietly. Cas bit his lip; watching Dean as he gave in had him hard.
They sat there for awhile, Dean darting his eyes around into the darkness, making sure nobody would catch him off guard. They had no fire lit and it was harder for Betas and Omegas to see in the dark.
Cas grabbed the mic. "Okay, story time. A few weeks ago, I went to rehab because I was addicted to Meth, Coke, and the fun one...Heroin. let me tell ya,it sucked donkey dick. One of the worst things I've ever been through. So what did I do? Write songs." He walked over to the keyboard and sat down, pulling the mic on the stand. "I wrote this song about halfway through the withdrawals and there were a lot of dark things goin on in my head. I was scared that everyone I love would just leave." He played a few notes. "This song is called Lover Dearest." The crowd screamed again.
"Hell yes, you did! Dude that rocked! I can't wait to see it! Charlie, I expect an email when it's ready!"
"No, it's not like that, believe me. Let's just say they won't be getting any awards for parents of the year."
The drive to the Novak's house was silent. Dean dropped Cas off without a word. As he went inside the house, Cas turned to see a cloud of dust at the end of their stone driveway.
Again, thank you so much everyone! Be on the lookout for the next part!! Don't forget to comment! They keep me going!
"Oh my God, what happened?" Charlie almost yelled. Cas looked at her wide eyed in horror at her entrance, but relaxed. "Keep it down, we're in a hospital." He was holding a washcloth to his bottom lip.
"Mmm...I like the way you think Winchester." Cas smiled. Dean pulled Cas in as close as he could and kissed him. Cas moved his hands to Dean's hips and backed him into the booth. Cas pushed himself against Dean, grinding down on Dean's growing erection. He kissed down Dean's jawbone to his neck. He pulled down the collar of Dean's shirt and sucked the skin right above his collarbone.
Cas seemed to know that fact, because he undid the fly with his teeth and maneuvered the denim off of Dean’s legs with his hands. Once Dean's jeans were off, so were Cas’.
The door opened and his parents stepped out. "Let's go Dean." Deangrabbed his backpack and followed his parents to the car. "Do you have anything to say for yourself Dean?" Dean looked out the window. "Serves him right." His dad turned around. "What's gotten into you Dean? You never acted like this when Castiel was around. Now you're acting up at home, getting into fights at school, tell us what's going on son." Dean continued to look out the window. "It's because of Cas I didn't fight before. Adam's been picking on Cas since ever. Cas always talked me out of it and even calmed me down." His voice was quiet. John looked at Mary. Suddenly aware of the effect Cas' move had on him. "Can we just go home please? I'll apologize to Adam and his parents, but Adam had it coming."
Everyone filtered in to the hall. Cas peeked his head out. The shot went to Dean then to Cas stepping out into the hall.
Sorry for the wait! I ended up getting blocked on this chapter! By the way...this is actually not exactly what I had planned but hey. Hope you like it!
Cas straightened himself and looked into his lover's green eyes. "You always take such good care of me. You're so nice."
Cas sulked through his next few classes. He couldn't believe that after all he and Dean had been through he couldn't even make a stupid music video with him. He tapped his pencil on his desk and watched the clock tick down to final bell.
"This calls for celebration." Benny said. Charlie jumped up. "Oh my gosh yes! We could do all the things we used to! Play pool, go horseback riding, take Benny's truck down main street, and top it off with a famous Winchester bonfire!"
The camera cut to the inside of a van then to Cas who was sleeping in the back seat. "So we're stuck in traffic and Cas fell asleep like as soon as we got in the van." Adam moved the camera closer so it was right in Cas' face. Cas opened his eyes and moved back. "Really with that?" He looked at Adam. Adamlaughed. Cas rubbed his head and sat up. "You're such an ass." Adam climbed over the seat on fell on top of Cas.
"You need to come home more often." She patted his back. "I'll try." He kissed her cheek and moved to the fridge. "Dean, nice to see you. How are tricks?" Dean smiled. "Pleasure as always Ms Novak. And tricks are good." Cas handed Dean a soda and leaned against the counter. "So I take it you two are back together." She eyed Dean.
Cas grabbed various things from around the kitchen. "Dog food it is." He looked up. "Speaking of which..." He walked to the back sliding glass door and opened it. "Mystic!" He whistled. A large German Shepherd came running to him and jumped on him. "Hey girl! You miss me?"
"Cas... mm... shit!" Dean threw his head back against the door as he felt Cas slide another finger in with the
"Don't see you complaining when you raid my shit whenever you're dry." He rolled his eyes. He sat down and pulled on his shoes.
"Wait, for real?" Sean looked like a light bulb went off in his head. "Hold on. Your Cas is Castiel. As in Cas Novak of Join The Hunt?!"
Naomi rolled her eyes. "At least wait until I leave for the store. But until then, Dean and I are going to watch you sing Thriller."
"He was a mess the whole time. Hardly talked. None of us really did. But he never gave up hope Dean. Hell we almost did. Thinking there was no way. He cussed us out good for it." Dean nodded. He knew Cas wouldn't have given up until Dean was sent home in a box. He didn't blame them for losing hope. Hell, he did a few times. "Did they discharge you?" John asked. Cas walked back into the room. He sighed. "No. They were going to. But I told them not to."
Then a picture Dean didn't even knew existed. He and Cas were standing in the living room on Christmas. Cas was giving Dean his present  that was his sketch book. Then a video of Dean leaning against the Impala, pulling Cas in for a kiss. Dean had no idea Mary had filmed that let alone watched it happen.
doing. Watching had become his favorite part since they were teenagers trapped in the shower because Mary had come home for lunch.
"Alright, asshats, gather 'round." Cas called to the guys. They all came over and stood in a circle. Cas looked at each of his friends.
Dean smiled. There was the old Cas. One by one, the pool balls were sunk into various pockets. As Cas sank the eight ball, Dean smiled. "Nice to see you haven't lost your touch." Cas stood up from the table. "I'm actually surprised. It's been years since I've played."
Dean pushed Cas back and pinned him to the floor, his lips grazing against Cas'. "Not today." He smiled.
Cas nodded. "Sneaky. I like. Alright, get dressed. We have a plane to catch and I have music to record."
Cas laid himself next to Dean. A grin crossed his face. He pulled the back of Dean's shirt collar down and lightly kissed where his neck met his back.
Cas rolled his eyes. "Of course they are. This is the first time I've been in public since the VMA's." Cas said as he slipped on his shirt.
They were silent going to the airport. Cas had given him a picture to take with him a picture of them together that Sam had taken a few days prior. Ellen, Jo, Bobby, Sam, and Jess were all waiting to see him off. Dean tucked the picture in his pocket. After saying goodbye to everyone, the all started to head home. Cas stayed. Dean hugged him. "This isn't goodbye. This is see you soon." Cas nodded. "I promise I'll come back to you. You hear me?" Cas looked up at him. Dean looked around to make sure nobody was watching. He kissed him. He pulled back after a moment. "I love you." He whispered. Cas sniffed back tears. "I love you too."
"Good. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to bed. You know where your room is." Castiel started down the hall.
They finished eating and Dean offered to clean up. "You've done enough already honey. You just relax." Mary said patting her eldest son's shoulder. Dean grabbed he and Cas' things and took them to his room. He let himself fall on his bed, exhausted from the drive. There was a knock. "Yeah?" His door opened with a screech. "Hey." Sam stepped inside and closed the door. "I need some advice." Dean propped himself up on his elbows. "Shoot." Sam grabbed the desk chair and sat down. "If you wanted to, you know, ask the question, how would you do it?" Dean sat up. "Are we talking about a proposal here Sammy?" Sam nodded. "Hell if I know."
On the train, he picked a window seat. He opened the window and leaned out as the train began to move. "Take care of my car!" He yelled. They all laughed waving. The train picked up speed. "I'll be back before you realize I'm gone!" He yelled waving. He waved til they were out of sight.
"I stalked you for months and we had sex on a cliff." Dean looked at him. Cas returned the look. "What? It's true." Dean shook his head. "In between that, I got transferred to his advanced drama class. That's how we actually met."
Dean shook his head. “No, that's different. We watch out for each other here. With a mate, it's something entirely different. I would constantly be worried about my mate's well-being to the point where I would really care about much else. That's how my dad was with my mom. He only really cared about her. Sure he cared about Sam, Alec, and I, but it wasn't the same devotion he showed her.”
"It's a date then. Well, goodnight and goodbye, fuckers!" Both bands walked off stage to the back. Cas was beyond any level of happiness he'd felt in a long time. He picked the bra up and handed it to Josh. "This dude could use some love right now though cuz he just got shown up by a kid." He laughed. Josh faked looking hurt. "Ouch!" He set the mic down and put his arm around Cas. "Seriously though. You should shoot me a demo and I'll push it to the label." Cas looked at him, wide eyed. "Wow, thanks man!"Josh looked out at the crowd. "Alright that's all you get, folks. We're outta here! Goodnight!"
“I admit Winchester, I'm impressed.” He grabbed Dean and pushed him against the shower wall, pressing his hard dick against Dean and kissing down his neck to his chest. He grabbed Dean's half-hard dick and stroked slowly. Dean let his head rest against the wall, taking Cas' dick in his hand and squeezed gently, a quiet moan escaped from his lip as Dean matched his slow pace. Cas bit down lightly on Dean's nipple. Dean sucked in air through his teeth, Cas flicked his tongue across it taking the beads from Dean with his free hand. Dean moved away from the wall, but Cas pushed him back with his forearm, dropping the fleshlight and pulling Dean's hips out with the other. He rubbed the beads against Dean's entrance then pushed the first two inside. Dean dug his blunt nails into Cas hips. Cas looked up at him, his hair plastered against his forehead, water dripping down. His electric blue eyes focused and aware of every detail. From every water droplet running down Dean's well sculpted body, the ripple of his muscles as the tighten, the parting of Dean's lips as he tried to stifle a moan. The way Dean's light brown hair stuck to his forehead sending water droplets down to those gorgeous jade green eyes that Cas often found he could lose himself in. He continued to stroke Dean's dick as he pushed another bead in. Dean squeezed his eyes shut as he gasped. Cas leaned closer. “Come now Dean, my dick is bigger around than the bead that just went in you.” He whispered. Dean opened his eyes and looked at him. “It's just- it's you. I can't stop thinking about you Cas. About the other day. I woke up the next morning with a hard on just from thinking about it before I fell asleep, but it wasn't just the sex. It's just you Cas. I'm crazy about you already. I don't really know how or why, but I don't really care. When we get close like this, all I can see hear and feel is you. I can see your eyes, so focused on what you're doing. I hear your heartbeat. I feel your fingers. Even if this is all you want from me is sex, I would be fine with that.” Cas brushed his lips against Dean's then pushed a fourth bead in. “Trust me, I'm not in it for the sex Dean, but it is a plus seeing you like this.” He whispered. A moan escaped from Dean's throat as his jade green eyes slipped closed, his head falling back. Cas smiled and went back to focusing on everything Dean's body was doing, that is until Dean's mom knocked again. “I'm heading out Dean. See you later tonight.” Cas almost wanted to yell at her for breaking his concentration, but thought better of it. Dean kept his eyes closed and put his hand back on Cas' dick, stroking slowly. “Yeah, okay!” He called out in the most nonchalant voice he could muster. Cas pulled out the fourth bead then pushed it back in. Dean began to fuck himself into Cas' hand. Cas smiled. “Not so fast.” He growled lightly. Dean opened his eyes.
"Woah, RJ... you're okay buddy. Nice and easy..." Cas slowly backed RJ out of the trailer, which was proving to be a more involved task than he thought. With all the other horses and unfamiliar smells at the track on race day, RJ was having an attitude problem. The horse was finally on the ground and looking around, nostrils wide and breathing heavily. Cas patted him on the neck.
Dean watched as Cas walked to the other side of the stage. He nervously tapped the mic with his finger. Adam handed Dean a guitar. Dean took it and looked at Cas.
Between Cas whispering harshly in his ear and the feeling of Cas being inside him so suddenly, Dean almost went over the edge. As Cas began to push and pull, Dean felt his eyes close and he tipped his head back. Cas had nestled his head in Dean's shoulder and nipped at his ear lobe. Cas was breathing in Dean's ear, shallow and erratic. "Dean" He breathed, kissing Dean's neck.
Dean moved closer and put his hand on Cas' face, moving his head gently until Cas was looking at him. He moved in and gently kissed Cas' lip.
Dean and Cas didn't pick the music for the ceremony. Naomi and Mary did. They went with some classical thing that the boys weren't familiar with. It was pretty, though.
“Not anymore I guess.” Cas moved his head so his neck was visible, showing the bite mark Dean left. Gabriel quickly looked a the Beta who was talking to someone through the door. He moved his head to reveal he too had a mate. Cas didn't know whether to be comforted or horrified. Gabriel moved over to him, getting down to Cas' level.
Fifteen minutes later (after Dean told the office he was taking Cas home because he wasn't feeling well) Cas silently followed Dean to the Impala. He could tell Dean was pissed to the point were he didn't know whether to laugh or cry. So Cas just kept his mouth shut. He knew things had gotten out of control and needed help, so he didn't fight with Dean. Dean slid behind the wheel and closed the door. "Can you at least tell me why you're doing this to yourself?" Cas stared straight ahead. "If you were drugged three times a week for six years, do you think you could just quit cold turkey?"
He took one of his shoes off and threw it at the door, connecting with a bang. He fell back on his pillow.
Castiel looked up at Dean and took a deep breath. "That's all I needed. This. This right here. You fought for me this time. Showed me that I'm more than just a good time in the backseat. I’m worth something to you." He flashed a smile at Dean before kissing him again. "I love you, too," he said against Dean's lips. "Always have. Even when I tried to act like I didn’t." The kiss continued for several minutes before Cas pulled away. He gave Dean a mischievous look.
It was the first concert since his mom passed. The band walked out on stage. Cas stepped up to the mic.
In all the years she had known Cas, she never heard him sing like that before. It was beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. She had to send it to Dean. She realized there were tears running down her face. She dried her eyes with her shirt and quickly send the video to Dean along with a text that said "Look
Dean grinned; Cas was destroyed. "Ready?" Cas managed a nod. Dean had to keep himself from laughing. "Thought so."
Dean walked outside. Sure enough, the Novaks were standing in the parking lot. "Why aren't you on a plane to Michigan right now?"
The band walked over to the stage. Cas strapped on his guitar and stepped up to the mic. The music started. Sounding like an old video game. Then the band started to play and Cas sang
The video ended. Naomi stood up. "Well, I have errands to run and I have to get stuff to make dinner for our overnight celebrity. Be back in a few hours."
"There's nothing you can say. Or anyone. I'm done. He doesn't love me. This ring means nothing. He..." Cas leaned into Charlie and cried. Charlie just held him, not knowing what to do. She had a feeling that Cas was wrong; she has just talked with Dean and he did nothing but gush over Cas and how proud he was of him.
Cas looked back at Dean, who was walking away at a fast pace. “Don't… don't get me banned!” Cas patted RJ on the neck. “He's such a fucking hot head sometimes.”
His death made national television. hours after he was gone. Cas was sitting in the living room, watching. "A soldier in Lawrence Kansas was attacked late last night by a group of men. Corporal Dean Winchester died just a few hours ago from the injuries he sustained. Four of the eight men are being charged with murder, the other four being charged with accessory. The names of the men are not being released at this time. Dean was twenty three years old." Not one new cast said he was killed because he was gay. Cas got up and pushed the TV off the stand, it broke when it hit the floor. He flipped the coffee table over, grabbed a glass ashtray and threw it at the wall. Sam came running from his room upstairs and grabbed Cas. Pinning his arms to his sides. "Cas! Hey, hey...shhhh. It's okay" He sank to the floor crying. Cas had put Dean's ring on a chain. It dangled around his neck. He could hear Sam sniffing back his tears.
"Oh Dean! I'm so happy for you! Who is it?" He peaked his head out the door, Cas was still asleep. "You'll see when I come home for Christmas. And I know you'll want to get him a gift." She gasp. "It's a boy?" It wasn't said in disappointment, nobody questioned the soul mate tattoos. "Yes ma'am." His smile grew. "I'm so happy for you honey. You finally found your soul mate."
As the song came to an end, Dean tipped Cas' chin up slightly and took his mouth in his, tongue doing what it did best. Catcalls and cheers erupted from the crowd. When Dean backed up, Cas locked eyes with him. "If you aren't careful, I might just take you on this dance floor."
About thirty seconds later, Charlie burst out of her front door. "That was fast," Cas said. Dean shook his head. "Dude. You waved your plastic at her. Of course she moved fast."
Cas looked up. "Well, this kid here wanted to make some noise and cause a ruckus, so I bought us all plane tickets to Vegas."
Cas grinned at Dean. "Yeah. But you're my ass. I forgive you for your small amount of assery." He pushed Dean back down to the bed and snuggled up to him.
He slowly ran his eyes over Cas. "God Cas...I'm so sorry. Words can't even express how sorry I am." He tried to sniff back tears. "The doctor said you're not outta the woods yet. I really didn't let him finish, but I think he meant your lungs could fill with fluid again."
The wedding was amazing. Sam teared up when Jess walked down the isle. Dean put his hand on Sam shoulder and smiled at him. They looked so happy and so in love. He looked over at Cas and imagined it was them standing there, exchanging vows. The look on Cas' face after he said his vows. The reception. God, he couldn't wait to marry him.
So, what did you think about the wedding, Cas telling off his parents, and the reception? Leave a comment!
He woke up at his usual time and got dressed, which was a little difficult with a broken arm. His shoulder had pretty much healed already, it was just really sore now.
“You don't see this in the city, do you?” Dean stood next to where Cas was sitting. Cas shook his head. “Nope. Definitely not.” He sighed, still looking up at the sky. “I didn't realize how much I missed all of this.”
Dean grabs a fistful of Cas' jacket. "You're in it now Winchester, might as well accept." He slapped Dean on the ass. Dean just began to pull Cas away.
Dean smiled. "Not tonight." Cas opened his eyes and looked at Dean. "Dean... pl... please..." He thrust his hips upward in an effort to get Dean to do what he wanted. Dean pinned his hips down and kissed him, feasting on his lips and keeping his cock still inside Cas.
There was another piece of paper behind the first. Cas moved the first page behind the second and read:
“Yeah, cause I can go anywhere naked, wet, and with your mom here.” He teased. Dean shook his head and walked to the door. Cas watched him as he did. “You have a nice ass Winchester.” Dean turned his head, smiled, and winked at him. He turned to the door and opened it, looking left and right before dashing out of sight. “Hate to see him leave, but love to watch him go.” Cas said to himself. A minute later Dean was back, holding a shoe box. He closed the door and set the box down right out side the shower. Cas peered over the top to see that he was not the only freak in school. Cas bent over and picked up a dildo. “Standard Winchester. What else do you have?” “Shh! Just-” He grabbed the dildo and put it back in the box. Cas looked in the box again, seeing something that looked like a flashlight. He picked it up. “Is this what I think it is?” He looked at Dean. Dean looked at him. “Yes Cas, it's called a fleshlight.” Cas looked at the toy, thoroughly inspecting it. He looked back at Dean. “Got any whips or handcuffs?” He smiled, Dean rolled his eyes and shook his head. “Not that much of a freak are we? You'll learn” Dean stepped back in the shower, hiding something behind his back. Cas just waited patiently. Dean closed the curtain with one hand then looked at Cas. “I do have this though.” To his surprise, Dean pulled out Anal beads. Cas raised his eyebrows. “How did you get all of this?” Dean shrugged.
"Dean what's wrong? What's going on?" Her voice carried a not of concern. Dean didn't say anything. He just got in the elevator and pushed the button for the first floor. When the elevator stopped, Dean and Charlie walked out. Dean led the way to the parking lot. Charlie grabbed his arm and stopped him. "Dean! What the hell is going on?" She repeated. Dean just stood there for a second, then turned around and looked at Charlie. "I'm gonna make damn sure Cas never goes back to that house. Ever."
"Wasn't his fault mom. Total misunderstanding." Naomi glanced at Cas, and then back at Dean. "Well, I know how happy you guys are together. Congratulations." She hugged Dean and then hugged Cas. "I'm going to lay down. Behave yourselves."
"Nope. Taking my time today." Dean flicked the other nipple with his tongue, causing Cas to let out a loud groan and grip the sheets underneath him.
In the stands, Naomi sat next to Dean. She pulled out a pair of binoculars and handed them to him. She smiled when he looked at her with a little confusion.
Dean shrugged. "Missed you. And Charlie sent me a video she snuck of you playing the other day. On the bed."
Before he could get another shot in, Dean felt arms wrap around his torso and he was being pulled away. "That's enough Dean!" The principal took Dean to his office and called his parents. "I don't get it Dean. You've never gotten into fights before."
Dean hit his helmet and shook his head. "Fucking ridiculous." He started walking back with Benny. Lawrence got the extra point. A player from the other team shoulder checked Dean. "Watch it fag." Dean stopped and looked at him. "What did you just call me?" The kid turned and looked at him.
“You’re just jealous because I’m more fabulous than you.” Cas winked at Dean as he walked out to the garage to get the bike.
Crowley looked over at Cas, squinting his eyes at him. Cas kept his eyes on the track ahead; he was not going to let Crowley get to him. He saw Crowley lower his whip hand and Cas shifted RJ slightly so that there was a little more distance between he and Crowley.
"Okay then. I'll get you home. Quietly." Dean put his shirt and jeans on. "Cas, why go off to school? There are a lot of good schools around here. One of them would probably be just as good as Stanford."
"Come lay with me." Dean looked at Cas. He was slowly falling asleep. He walked over to the bed and kneeled so he was eye level with Cas. He ran a hand through Cas’ hair. "No, Cas. Go to sleep. I'll see you when you wake up." Dean kissed Cas lightly on the lips and pulled away as Cas tried to deepen it. Dean stepped out of the room and closed the door.
"Where is he when I need him Benny?" Dean flicked his eyes to his friend. "Why would he just leave? Now...now you guys and Sam are all I have left. What am I gonna tell Sam?" Dean looked up at Benny. Benny didn't know what to say. Dean was beyond hurt.
He was on his fifth cigarette when John walked out. Cas, Sam, and Adam stood up. John looked at them. His face emotionless. Cas dropped his cigarette. John bowed his head. "No!" Cas took off running. Sam yelling behind him. He took the stairs. running up them as fast as his legs would allow. When he made it to Dean's room doctor and nurses were just standing there. The machine was off. He looked at Dean, waiting for him to open his eyes, move, something.
He couldn't hear anything outside the cell, or smell anything except the small traces of the last Omega that was in here. He could smell traces of a fresh winter's snow and clean linen, trying to imagine what the last Omega looked like, trying to focus on anything other than the quiet...or Dean.
Dean managed to free himself of his jeans, pushing them to the side with his foot. Cas kept working, making his way down Dean's body. Cas nipped at Dean's hips, flicking his finger across Dean's slit. With the same finger, he rubbed Dean's hole and took Dean's cock into his mouth at the same time. Dean's knees buckled and he let out a loud, deep groan, nearly slipping down the door. Cas put his other hand on Dean's stomach, signaling him to stay upright. Dean groaned again. Cas flicked at Dean's slit again with his tongue.
Charlie moved out of the way and let Cas climb through the window. "Did you just climb the tree up here?" Since her room was on the second floor. She walked over to her nightstand and turned on her Princess Leia star wars lamp. "I'm up here aren't I?" She turned around and looked at him. "Cas! Oh my God!" His lip was
Charlie happily plopped down on a stool near the pool table. "This is just awesome guys! It has been way too long since we did this. I could get used to it." Dean botched his shot. "At least as long as Cas decides to stay. When, uh, do you have to leave?" Cas knew Dean was digging at him, trying to piss him off. It was working. But he played it off for the sake of the group. "I have a meeting first thing next Monday morning. I'll be flying out Sunday afternoon." Dean nodded. "Too bad. It's nice having the gang all here." He looked at Cas, taking a drink of his beer.
After he changed, he walked back to the living room. "Did you draw all of those?" He asked. Dean looked up at him. "Yeah, I'm here as an art major" He replied, continuing to poke at the fire. Cas sat next to him. "They're really good."
Dean put a hand up as he hurried up the stairs. “Nope. You don’t want any part of this at all right now. It’s not pleasant. I’ll be in the shower.” Cas shrugged as Dean practically ran up the stairs. Dean immediately turned the water on hot and jumped in. He shuddered.
"I don't think they expected a quarterback to shove himself in here," Cas said as he scooted over a little.
Dean just stood there for a moment, feet cemented to the floor. Suddenly, his feet remembered how to walk and he was heading to the stage, toward Cas. He climbed up and stood in front of him.
The snow started to fall. Dusting the ground in white as he walked up to the gazebo. "Mark I assume." The man turned around. "Castiel?" He took a few steps forward. Cas put his hand up. "That's far enough, and it's Cas."
"Just watch it. You don't want the other end of this." Dean turned and left the barn as Crowley headed to change.
He looked around, everything came back in little flashes. He slowly looked up at Castiel. "What did I do?"
Dean flipped forward a few pages. "Oh man! I remember this! My fifth birthday at the skating rink." Cas smiled. "Yeah, we had no idea how to skate and kept falling on our asses." He laughed. Cas then flipped a few pages. Dean groaned. "Come on, why do you still have this?" Cas looked at it. "Oh my God, is this what I think it is?"
insane. It made for a stressful week. Dean pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it aside, climbing over Cas in the process and straddling him. He noticed a bulge in Cas' sweats.
Since there was no typical bride and groom, Dean suggested walking down the isle together, but in the end Cas said he would. Dean couldn't help but smile like a child on Christmas as he watched Cas walk down the isle to him. Cas didn't have anyone walk beside him. He would've rather "given himself away" to Dean. When Cas reached Dean, he took Cas by the hand. They both looked at the minister.
Dean nodded.  "I tried Cas, I really did. I just didn't have enough fight left in me I guess. I'm sorry you had to see me go out like that. I'm sorry for all of it, but I don't want to see you die Cas. Please. You have to let me go."
"Yes okay? I'm a faggot. Happy now?" He put his hands in his pockets and looked away. Dean shifted his weight from one leg to the other. "Who am I to judge." He said after a moment. Cas looked back at him. "It doesn't bother you?" Dean shook his head. He fished his cigarettes out of his pocket. He lit one and handed it to Cas. Cas looked at it. "I'm not gonna beat your ass when you grab it if that's what you're thinkin'." Cas took it. Dean lit one for himself. "What bothers me is I used smoking a cigarette as an excuse to go outside and talk to you. That I invited you to dinner and to my house when I don't even know you. That I honestly didn't mind you walking into the bathroom. What bothers me the most is you're so God damned beautiful." He stood up straight, taking a drag from his cigarette. "I have only been with one guy. One. In college. I blamed it on the booze but that wasn't the case. I wasn't even drunk when I did it. But he was trashed out of his mind. I took advantage. Nobody said shit because they don't remember it. I liked it. I liked it a lot. I knew what that meant. Hell, I knew in high school. I only chased tail so nobody would figure it out. I never had sex with them. And they wanted it. I told them a bullshit excuse about waiting til I was married. They bought it every time." Cas was silent. Listening to every word. Dean took another drag from his cigarette then flicked it away. It hit the cement. He closed the gap between them. He could feel Cas' breath on his face. Smelling like coffee and cigarettes. "The second I saw you walk into that diner, I had to have you. I saw the look on your face this morning. It was a split second, but I saw it. You liked what you saw, didn't you?" Cas nodded.
They took turns walking up to the grave and throwing a handful of dirt onto Dean's casket. Cas was last. His new family standing behind him. He bent over and grabbed a handful of dirt, looking at the casket. "I'll always love you Dean Winchester." He threw the dirt and walked away. He couldn't bring himself to look back. He wanted all of it to be a dream. He stopped and looked at the car Dean bought after they got engaged. The car he had driven here. He told himself he was just on his way to see Dean or to pick him up just to get himself to come. Now he had to figure out a way into tricking himself to get back home. Adam offered to drive. Cas gladly accepted.
"Oh. My. Lord. He was unbearable. Always moping around town. He'll deny it, and say he was fine. But cowboys are cowboys and they're raised to put on a face and be manly about stuff. But I could tell. He doesn't smile like that without you."
"After everything you've been through, you deserve it." He smiled. "You're the amazing one."Dean pulled Cas close and took over his mouth. Cas opened up to the kiss and pulled at Dean's bottom lip. Dean let out a low moan.
“I'm okay” He breathed. Cas nodded, letting Dean get used to the feeling before pushing in even more. The feeling alone was almost enough to make Cas come already, forcing him to stop anyway. The dildo wasn't even that big, Dean was just so fucking tight! Cas let out a noise between a sigh and a moan. He dropped his head and pushed in once more, now throwing his head back and grunted a moan. At last a few minutes later he was all the way in. He dropped his head and opened his eyes as he slowly pulled out and back in. He leaned forward, grabbing Dean's hands and pinning them above his head. Brushing his lips up Dean's chest to his neck, ghosting his jawline then finding his lips. Dean grabbed Cas' hips and pulled him closer and deeper. Both boys moaned into each others lips. Cas opened his electric blue eyes and pulled away, grabbing Dean's legs and holding them in the air; moving his hips a little faster and slightly harder. Dean arched his back and pulled on Cas hips, emerald green orbs fixed on his blue ones. “Cas...” He moaned. “Please.” He begged. Cas leaned forward, pulling Dean's legs up even more. Cas pulled half way out, looking at Dean whose eyes were closed his lips parted. Cas thrust inside Dean causing him to arch his back and moan loudly. He thrust faster, throwing his head back with loud gasps and moans. He looked back at Dean. He could tell Dean was trying not to come. Cas smiled to himself and moved his hip faster. The room filled with Dean's moans, echoing off the walls and bouncing back at Cas, vibrating through his body. “Come for me Dean.” His blue eyes piercing into Dean as he put his hands on Dean's hips and moved in rhythm with his own hips. “Oh fuck!” Dean breathed. Cas didn't let up. Dean's moans grew more frequent. “Cas, I'm gonna- fuck!” Dean's body shook as he came. Cas took Dean's dick and stroked him through his orgasm, still not letting up.
"Shit... Cas... oh my God..." Cas hit Dean's prostate again, harder this time. Dean moaned again and a shiver went through his entire body."Cas..."
Cas couldn't help but smile as Dean walked down the isle to him. As soon as he saw him, he wasn't nervous anymore, not that he acted nervous. He fought the urge to meet Dean halfway and just kiss him like the fucking world is ending.
Dr Mills looked at Cas and smiled. "You're husband's a good man, Castiel. You should listen to him."
Dean dug his nails into Cas' thigh. "Cas..." He moaned. Cas kissed him then pulled away just enough to say "yeah, that's it. Come for me babe."
After breakfast, he grabbed some clothes and walked into the bathroom to take a shower. He turned on the water and stepped in, closing the shower curtain. He let the hot water run over him for a minute. He thought back to breakfast. How Cas looked playing with his cup of coffee. His messy hair from sleep. His eyes...God those eyes. He shook his head to get the thought from his mind. After he was clean he turned the water off and grabbed the towel. Putting it over his face as he opened the curtain. As soon as he did, the door opened. Cas was standing there. He looked at Dean. "Sorry I didn't know..." He trailed off and closed the door. Great. A complete stranger had just seen him naked. Not awkward at all.
"Hey! Give it back Cas!" Dean reached for the picture. Cas kept it out of his reach. He got up, Dean followed. "Come on Cas!" Cas held out the picture, Dean went to grab it and Cas pulled it away. "Gonna have to be faster than that Winchester." Cas ran from the living room to the kitchen, Dean chased him around the table. "Come on Cas, this isn't funny."
The unit wasn't as rowdy as before. Naturally, they grew up. Once a week he called home. Hearing everyone kept him sane. When Cas would get on, he would look at Adam who would keep everyone out of the tent so they could talk privately. The never talked about the war. "We should go somewhere when you come home." Dean smiled. He knew just the place. "There's a lake that dad would take us to when we were kids. We could rent a cabin for a week. Total privacy. Not a soul for miles. And it has it's own beach."
He smiled and started the car. He rolled down the window and sat on the door. "See you in March!" He slid back in and put the car in gear, looking over at Cas for a second before driving off. "Well, we'll still have a day before school starts again. Any ideas?" Cas smiled, looking over at Dean. "You could draw me again." Dean laughed and looked in the rear view mirror. His family was still on the side of the road, waving. "I'm sure we'll think of something."
him was already enough to send him flying a second time. "Come with me Cas." Dean moaned. Dean stroked faster. Cas matched his rhythm.
Cas laughed a little. “I was actually getting ready to pack because I was volunteering for breeding.”
"He's the one who left. He didn't want this. Any of it. And I doubt that's changed at all. Now, grab a pitchfork and help me with this."
"Shut up and answer the question, Gabe. And yes, I'm selling. I'm coming home. Oh, I have a penthouse for sale, too. If anyone's interested."
Cas arched his neck at the sensation and wrapped his legs around Dean’s hips, pulling him slightly closer. Dean took a deep breath and bit his lip again. He pushed himself inside Cas slowly, stopping for a few seconds to allow Cas to get used to the feeling. Cas' eyes fluttered closed and moaned. "Dean..." It was barely a whisper. "I know baby, I know. Just slowing it down a bit."
As they ate, Cas told Naomi the events that unfolded. Including Josh telling Cas that he'll push the band's demo through to the label. Naomi smiled brightly at her son. "I knew you would be a star some day. Ever since you were four running around the house singing Michael Jackson." Dean choked on his waffle. Cas dropped his head in his hand. "You like Michael Jackson?!" Cas groaned. "Thanks mom. Now he's gonna tell Charlie who will never let me live it down."
By now the Humvee was smoking, the Betas got out and started running after them. Dean started firing rounds into the dirt around them, getting them to slow down or risk getting shot in the foot. Some he did shoot in the foot, some of the other Betas tripped over them.
"We're not kids anymore Cas. Besides, I didn't get you into that much trouble, and I was always there to bail you out when I did."
Dean stood up and stormed up the steps. He went to his room, slamming the door behind him. He paced back and forth. He ran his fingers through his hair. "Son of a bitch!" He kicked his bed a few times. "This can't be happening!" There was a knock. "Dean, are you alright honey?" Dean stopped and looked at his door. "I'm fine mom." He answered. He collapsed on the bed. He looked at the wall, at the pictures of him and Cas. He rolled on his side and propped himself up on his elbow. He looked at one in particular. The one where they were sitting on the swings looking at each other and laughing. Dean tried to remember what he said to make Cas laugh. He took the picture from the wall, smiling at the picture.
“Everything okay? You look a bit...pale. Did your stitches break? Are you bleeding?” Cas asked, concern growing in his voice.
fixed on Cas. Cas grabbed his hips and repeatedly thrust hard into him. Dean's eyes fluttered but stayed open as he
She stopped at the bottom of the stairs. "No one discriminates against my son for any reason whatsoever. Ever. I'm going to fix this."
"Get. The fuck. Off my land. Nobody treats Cas like that. Nobody. Now leave. I never wanna see your face here again." Dean stood up and walked back into the house, taking Cas by the hand without missing a beat. Cas didn't even look back. Once inside, Cas leaned against the door and closed his eyes, exhaling raggedly. When he heard the sound of his dad's car driving away, he felt his eyes sting.
He grabbed Dean by the waist, pulling him closer. Their lips brushed together before connecting in a slow kiss.
Cas' hair had grown a bit in the last two months and it was almost over his eyes. The hair and make up team went to work on the band. Adam turned the camera on and pointed it at Cas.
Cas moved so he was behind Dean and grabbed his ass. "It's like, 3D. I don't have to try and imagine it with your clothes on anymore."
Dean was standing in the lobby of a motel. He handed the lady behind the desk the money for a room. She handed him a key. Dean walked to the Impala dangling the room key as he got in. He pulled around and found their room for the night. He grabbed their overnight bags from the back seat and got out.
and nothing else. He opened it. It was a letter. Cas dropped the uniform and slowly sank to the floor. He must have written it while he was on his second tour. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before reading:
Thank you to all of those who have read and are enjoying this story! I have decided to make this a series so this will be the last chapter! As always ENJOY!
The song ended and they went right into the next one. They played Desperate Measures, Lover Dearest, Ever After, and All To Myself. Cas was out of breath and sweating because he was jumping up and down and dancing pretty much the whole time.
He had forgotten how boring his job and life had become. Looking back, he didn't notice it before. But since he had gone back to Texas, his life had already changed dramatically. He was who he is supposed to be, not who his father wanted him to be. Which was this, a businessman, and become filthy rich by basically sitting on your ass.
Twenty minutes later, the trio was walking through downtown Kansas City. "Hey, check it out." Cas pointed to a bar. Dean and Charlie looked at him. "And how are we supposed to get in?" Charlie asked. Cas flashed a smile and dug in his jacket pocket. "With these. I made copies of our licenses and changed the date of birth. Congrats guys! We're twenty-one now!" He handed them the fake ID's. They looked at them. Dean looked up at Cas. "How did you get our drivers licenses?"
The lights cut out. His head shot up. Was this normal? He didn't know. He slowly stood up and even more slowly crept to the door, looking out the tiny window. The whole building was dark. He couldn't see a thing, save for flashes of light.
Prom night was upon them. Cas was literally throwing his clothes all over the room trying to find the right outfit. "Whoa. Hurricane Cas, calm down."
Castiel nodded slightly. Dean put his arms around the Omega and pulled him almost on top of him. Castiel's sent hit him instantly, like cinnamon and spring rain. It was the most calming sent he had ever smelled. Instinctively, he reached his hand up and started running his fingers through Castiel's hair. The Omega practically melted, curling himself up on Dean's lap and putting his head against Dean's chest. He smiled slightly as Castiel nuzzled his neck.
Within seconds, they were running around the school yard throwing snowballs at each other. They called a truce and started building a snowman, then wrote their names in the snow.
"Stay away from my wife!" Mr Novak shoved Dean right into Cas. They both hit the floor. "You okay?" Cas nodded. Dean looked at Mr Novak and stood up. Cas was right behind him. Dean walked right up to Mr Novak and punched him in the face. Mrs Novak started yelling. "Shut up." Dean spat. She went quiet. "This is what's gonna happen, you and your husband are going to get on a plane, go back to Michigan and forget you even had a son. If I ever see you around my fiance again it will be the last mistake you ever make." He pulled out his wallet and threw money into the air. "For your trip. Have a nice life" He stood there for a second until Cas took him by the arm and started pulling him away. "Come on Dean. Let's go."
They got to the check in desk. Cas stepped forward. "Checking in. Two king suites for Castiel J. Novak. I reserved them yesterday." The clerk looked up, startled. "Oh! Yes, Mr Novak." The clerk reached for the keys, eyeing Dean as she handed them to Cas. She looked him up and down, and Cas couldn't blame her for it, he was pretty gorgeous after all. He took Dean's hand. "Sorry, he's taken. Thank you." Cas took the room keys and gave two to Meg and Charlie and kept the others for himself and Dean. They took their luggage to the elevator and made their way to the floor they were staying on.
He sighed. "What?" The door opened. "Hey, sweetie. Something wrong?" Cas looked toward the door. "No, mom. Whatever gave you that idea?"
They reached the medical cabin, Bobby and Benny helped get Dean on a bed so Ellen could get the bullets out.
The light kept blinking. He reached for the phone. Cas bit his lip. "I'm going going to hate myself for this," he thought.
“I got accepted into a scholarship program for aspiring horse trainers. Specializing in racing. Not. A. Word.” Cas squinted his eyes at his friend.
"You should go home and get some sleep." Charlie just shook her head. "You're about as stubborn as he is." She pulled up an extra chair. "Do you remember when Cas wrecked his bike?"
Dean woke up suddenly, in a cold sweat. He got up and went to the bathroom, splashing cold water on his face. Another damn nightmare. Great. He sighed, walking over to his dresser and putting on a pair of sweat pants. He put on his shoes and walked out of the cabin and down the hill, at first, just trying to clear his head. Then he realized he was in the Omega side of camp. Shit.
Around three in the morning, Dean walked up the familiar dirt path to Suicide Drop. He sat down and looked up at the sky. He closed his eyes and took a breath. "Look, I'm uh, not good at this whole praying thing. Now is as good a time as any I guess." He opened his eyes. "Please. Don't take Cas away from me. I don't know what I'd do without him. He's everything to me. I can’t lose him. Please. Help him. Save him."
He grabbed everything he would need and headed to school with Dean. Cas drummed on his thigh as they drive to school. Dean eyed him.
Dean nodded in approval. "Gonna be a nice apple pie life for you there Sammy." He smiled. "What about you son?" John asked Dean. "Sell as many drawings as I can. Maybe teach art classes. I know teachers don't make much, but I won't need money to be happy." He looked over at Cas, smiling.
He turned and walked to the door. "Hate to see you leave, but damn how I love to watch you go Winchester." Dean looked back at him and winked.
"I know it's not, but learned a long time ago laughing at people like that is better than getting pissed."
"Dean...why?" Cas looked like he was on the verge of tears. Dean looked around the room stopping on Cas. "I'll tell you the same thing I told them. I have unfinished business with those bastards. So when I'm good to go, I'm going back. No argument. I'm going." He didn't leave it open for discussion.
"Yeah, and look what happened to it. Now I have to quit smoking and be responsible and shit." He laughed.
Dean kept Cas pinned to the bed and leaned down, biting at one nipple and then the other, flicking the second one with his tongue as he pulled back.
He stood up and moved around Cas. “I got out by dumb luck. For some reason, they were moving me to a different cage. So I used it to my advantage. My hands and feet were shackled, but when I tested the strength, I figured out it wouldn't take much for me to break them. So I did. I fought with the guards and ran. I don't even know how I got as far as I did because I was dehydrated and they hardly fed us. I guess willpower goes a long way. I ran until I just couldn't anymore. A family found me in some woods outside of Guthrie. An Alpha named Benny and his mate Andrea. They have one kid close to presenting. They took care of me for a week or so. I told them about this place when we split up. I don't think they made it yet, but hopefully they'll be here within a day or so.”
Dean sat down in one chairs outside of the booth next to the producer. "You ever watched him work before?"
"Yeah, yeah. We'll see..." Cas stammered. Dean had never seen Cas this drunk, and he anticipated one hell of a hangover in the morning.
"Well what the hell, guys? Where have you been?" Charlie had her hands on her hips and was standing next to the table she and Meg had gotten in the diner.
"What? You were drooling." He rolled his eyes as she sat down. "And who are we drooling over today?" She followed his eyes.
"Mom! Jesus!" Now Cas was laughing at Dean's embarrassment. Dean's head fell back as he groaned. "Not you too Cas." Cas turned and looked at him. "I'm sorry but it's funny." Dean looked at Sam. "I don't know why you're laughing, you're next in line buddy."
"Okay, I want to make a toast." Mary held up her glass of wine, John followed suit. Dean grabbed his glass of water and raised it. Cas, Sam, and Jess did the same. "To my two boys for finding their soul mates! To Sam and Dean!" Dean glanced sideways at Cas and winked as he took a drink. Cas smiled. Dean set his glass down and noticed Sam had just taken his drink. "Just make sure you're being safe Sammy." Sam almost spit out his water and the table erupted with laughter.
"Uh, Dean is having a hard time adjusting. He hasn't spoken to anyone." Castiel answered for him. The group councilor, Naomi, looked at Castiel.
“No. I couldn’t. So I left and came back here and here we sit. I’m going to bed. Great chat. ‘Night, Benny.” Benny was still shaking his head as Dean went back inside the house.
Dean nodded, not really knowing what to say. "Hey, remember when we used to sit by my fireplace and drink hot chocolate with the little marshmallows?" Dean smiled. Cas chuckled. "And race to see who could drink it faster. One of the only times I would beat you at something."
"No. Nothing. It's been four hours." He shook his head and looked at the ceiling. "It's my fault. I shouldn't have yelled at him. I've never yelled at him..." He took a shaky breath. "Now...now he's in there dying because of me..."
Benny grabbed Dean around the waist, pinning his arms to his side. Dean struggled against him. Benny lifted him off his feet and took him into the kitchen, setting him next to the island. Dean slowly slid to the floor. Benny knelled in front of him. Dean's face held no emotion whatsoever. He stared blankly in front of him. Benny could tell he had already been drinking but didn't know how much. Dean had gotten good at draining a bottle pretty fast after Cas left.
"Best prom ever." Dean smiled. "By the way, you should wear a tank top more often." Cas smiled and shook his head.   "You know what you should do? Make like a video diary for the fans. Life in the studio, life on tour, stuff like that." Charlie suggested.
"Sure kid, anything you say. Get your ass in the house Castiel." He said, shoving Cas twords the door.
Adam grabbed Castiel by the shirt and hit him in the face. Dean struggled against Cain, but to no avail. Adam hit Cas again, Cole let him fall to the ground.
Cas looked up at Dean and read the apology in his eyes. He felt a tear threaten to make itself known. Cas put his hands on Dean's wrists, gripping him tight. "I never stopped loving you. Not once."
"Ummm.... did I just hear what I think I heard? They won't let you do it because you're gay?" Charlie stared at cas wide eyed. Cas paced the courtyard. "Well, because I'm gay and Dean's gay and were gay together and the video will be about me and him so.... that makes it a problem."
“Yes, turd. Right now. Lemme see.” Dean looked at Cas’ leg and noticed a slice in the fabric over his thigh. The edges were tinted red. When he pulled the material back, he saw a shallow, thin cut.
So I honestly don't know how long I will make this story, so please comment (They'll help me keep it going!) Anyways, on to the chapter!!
"Well, she isn't wrong." Dean glanced sideways at Cas before following Charlie out. Cas bit his lip and crossed his arms, watching Dean walk away.
Dean's breath shallowed. "Fuck Cas! I'm....fuck!" Dean shook with the force of his orgasm. Cas' head fell back to the couch. Listening to Dean sent him over the edge.
The friends stood and watched for a while as the responders worked. Finally, Meg looked around. "Uh, guys? Where's Dean?" The group took off for the house, calling out his name. They found Dean sitting on the floor in the living room, looking at pictures of him and his parents. Tears streaming down his face as he went through them. He stopped on a picture of him and Cas their junior year standing in the barn with Whiskey and River. "Where are you when I need you Cas?" He looked at the picture for a minute longer then threw all of them a side. He stood up and kicked over the coffee table, then pushed everything off the mantle above the fireplace. He grabbed a fire poker and hit the couch repeatedly.
Dean filled the gap between them. Cas put his head on Dean's shoulder and began to whisper the lyrics to him, so only he could hear.
"I can assure you we had no idea why Castiel acted the way he did when we told him about the tattoo." Dean leaned closer. "Bullshit. It took my mom twenty fucking minutes to figure it out. Hell, she figured it out when we were kids! As soon as you told Cas he got upset just like I did when my parents told me because I thought I would never see him again. I know Cas. He didn't just sit quietly and accept that he would never see me again. I have done nothing but try and protect your son. And if I have to protect him from you then so be it. So you can either choose to grow the hell up, leave the past in the past, be happy for your son and watch him get married. Or you can keep playing this childish game and get your snobby ass on a plane back to Michigan." He stood up. "I don't care either way because whatever you chose, I still get the honor of being your son's husband."
Cas looked around the stables as he led RJ to his stall. "Which one?" He asked Charlie. Charlie looked around. "There, them. The quarter horse in stall nine." Cas led RJ by the stall. The horse started kicked the stall and snorting at Cas and RJ. Cas eyed the horse then looked at RJ. "Remember that scent buddy. Don't let him near you." He patted RJ as the walked. RJ snorted in response.
Cas sat up and ran his fingers through his already messy hair. Dean smiled. "You know, I think this is the same room we were in during playoffs." He pulled Cas back down. "I think you're right" He smiled, kissing Dean gently on the lips. "We should just stay right here and make new memories and possibly break this bed."
"I'm also going to assume you need a place to stay. I'll let you on two conditions. Get a job, and no more get rich schemes."
"Dean, come on! You're going to be late for orientation!" Sam yelled. Dean rubbed his eyes and sat up. he swung his legs over the side of the bed and scratched his bare chest. Finally, he was going to college. Since the apartment he was renting allowed pets, He got to take his dog Riot with him. Hid dad had given him his car as a graduation present. An Impala. Not just any Impala, a 1967. It was a thing of beauty. Since his apartment was already furnished, all he needed was his school stuff, clothes, his computer, games systems, and of course his dog and all of his stuff. He dressed quickly and ran downstairs. He had pretty much packed everything the day before. He had some stuff in the Impala and the rest in his dad's truck. He grabbed his blue and black short sleeve checkered shirt and put it on over his white t-shirt. He ran his fingers back and forth through his hair giving it a messy look. He pulled his phone out and took a picture, posting it on Facebook with the caption "College bound". Sam rolled his eye. "You take more selfies than a girl." Dean put his phone back in his pocket. "Shut up and help me with the rest of the boxes."
Castiel rolled over to face Dean. "Honestly, I expected it. Now, get over here and remind me why I'm selling a multi-billion dollar software company again."
Dean woke up in the middle of the night. Cas was asleep next to him. He shook him awake. "Cas, get up." Cas slowly opened his eyes. "What Dean, it's the middle of the night." Dean sat up. "I know how to keep you from moving away!" Cas rubbed his eyes and sat up. "How?" Dean smiled. "We run away!"
Cas flushed the toilet and washed his hands. "I've decided that if I have to start behaving I might as well start now."
God. He slowly fucked himself in Dean's hand. Dean pinned his hips to the bed. "Don't get ahead of yourself." He whispered. Cas' head fell to the bed. "Yes, get ahead of myself. Almost two months.”
Cas smiled. He unwrapped his present and opened the box. Inside, was a cd and a shirt. "Marianas Trench shirt and their new album. Nice!"
"I'm doing you a favor. An athletic scholarship is the only way out of this town. Keep fucking with him, it's out the window."
"You should go home. You have Jess and the baby to look after. You shouldn't spent your time looking after your brothers widow."
Charlie pouted. "Don't give me that look. If the press wants us, they can come find us. Until then..." He wiggled his fingers. Charlie sighed and took the memory card out of the camera and handed it to him. "You're no fun Novak."
The waiter poured waters for the table and left. Dean looked at Cas. "Did he just say that Gordon Ramsey was excited to meet me?"
Late at night when he was alone in his dorm, he would examine the tattoo that hadn't been visible for years. He could still remember the design. Soul mates, he learned, had the exact same design. And it would glow the exact same color.
"Now that I'll drink to." He smiled, draining the liquid and setting the shot glasses down. The band started up as they finished their shots, leading the set with Aerosmith's Walk This Way. The waitress brought their appetizers to the table and took their order. A bacon cheeseburger for Dean and a double bacon cheese
Cas gave one last deep thrust into Dean and Dean came undone, gripping Cas' thighs so hard that he was sure he would bruise him. Cas opened his eyes and saw Dean, completely wrecked, causing him to come inside of Dean.
"Depends. Get anything good in the mail lately?" Castiel dug through the papers on his desk, finding the mail. He found an envelope from his older brother and opened it. "You're joking right? You're getting married?"
"I'm surprised it didn't take me longer. I finished it last night." He pulled the keys out of his pocket and jingled them in front of Cas' face.
"Relax love. We got all the time in the world." Dean whispered softly as he pushed against Cas' prostate again. Cas arched his back and moaned. Dean couldn't get enough of Cas being absolutely wrecked. He loved the sight of Cas under him, moaning, practically begging for release. Dean moaned against Cas' neck as he listened to his lover lose control, as Cas' chest rose and fell in shallow and erratic breaths.
As soon as they stepped inside, Dean was greeted with a hug from his mom. "I'm so glad you're here!" She said enthusiastically. Dean smiled. "Glad to be home. Can I at least take my jacket off?" He laughed. Mary pulled away. "Sorry. It's just been a few months since we've seen you." She replied. Dean set his duffel down and took off his jacket. Cas had his folded in his arms. Dean rolled his eyes and took it, hanging both on the rack.  Dean then noticed all eyes were on Cas. Dean knew they would be surprised. "You remember Cas everyone." It wasn't a question. Mary's eyes grew wide. "Oh my goodness! Of course!" She wrapped Cas in a hug, smiling. She pulled away and looked at him. "Look at you! You were a handsome kid but wow! You became quite the looker." Cas smiled, damn near blushing. "Thank you Mrs Winchester."
He wiped his nose on his sleeve. "Cas...I don't know if you meant to or not...either way, some of this is my fault. I know it is. I've never yelled at you before. I've never even dreamed of yelling at you. I don't know what I was thinking, but you can be pissed all you want...okay? Just...just please don't die, Castiel."
He felt Cas' lips between his shoulder blades. "You awake?" Cas asked, voice still thick with sleep. Dean rolled on to his back, finding those breathtaking electric blue eyes. "Yeah." He moved to kiss his forehead. "Hell of a party." He added with a smile. Cas chuckled. "I never go anywhere without making myself known."
"Technically I have been. Just on a much smaller scale." He smiled. "And the band, they memorized the songs in less than a day. They work just as hard as I do." He laid his head on Dean's shoulder. "It just doesn't seem real to me. Like, it's all a dream and I could wake up any second."
The Beta grabbed him by the hair and pulled him out of the room. He yelled out for help, but stopped when the Beta held a gun to him. He could hear more doors opening and more Omegas yelling until they were silenced.
He took a taxi to his place since his car was at his house. He pushed open the door. "Lucy, I'm home!" He called. The three walked out and met Cas at the door. "Grab your camera Charlie, you've got some filming to do."
Been awhile huh? Sorry about that. This probably won't be a very long chapter. School, other stories...life...anyways! I hope you enjoy and I hope it was worth the wait...even if it is short.
"I know. I have been for the last few minutes but I can't find the match" Dean looked up and was met by the most breathtaking beautiful blue eyes. The stranger chuckled. "You would think after all those years. You know, we actually though we were superheros?" Dean's eyes widened. "No way." He said quietly.
He stopped and turned around. Ejecting the empty magazine and loading a new one, firing non-fatal shots at the Betas. When he turned to keep running, he felt a white-hot burning pain in his abdomen and hit the ground.
Sam shrugged. "Nothin. Just...that's the first time you've mentioned him since he died...four months ago."
"Just the usual 'go die fag' about a million times a day." Dean tried not to let it get to him. He was normally a happy person. Even Meg noticed when he wasn't his usual self. "I try to ignore it. It just sucks sometimes dad. I'll be okay."
They were sitting on the couch watching TV. Cas had his head on Dean's lap. Dean had his arm around him. It was around noon when the news cut into the show they were watching. The president came on screen. "Today over 2,000 lives were lost." Dean leaned forward, causing Cas to sit up. "It is with a heavy heart I tell you, our forces at Pearl Harbor came under attack just before eight this morning." Dean moved to the edge of the couch. Cas watched him. "Japan has seen fit to declare war on this nation. Well, I'll tell you this." Dean stood up. Cas looked at the TV. Both knowing what was about to happen. "We will not back down. We will fight. Fight for the men and women who died today. Fight for the soldiers still trapped in the USS Oklahoma." Dean balled his hands into fists. "Fuckin right we will." There was a knock on the door. Dean stayed standing in front of the TV. Cas answered it. Sam was standing there out of breath. He lived a few blocks away. "Where's Dean?" He asked in a panic. Cas opened the door wider and let Sam in. "Dean!" He walked over to him. He finally looked up at the two of them but didn't say a word.
"It's no big deal. My family thinks it is. Come eat. I'll point you in the direction of a hotel after."
"Well, you make a good muse." Cas pulled Dean in and kissed him. Carlie grabbed Cas by the collar. "Okay, okay... break it up. We all know what happens when you two suck face, and I don't think everyone else would enjoy that view."Cas sighed and rolled his eyes. "Spoil sport."
"Well, they ran a shit ton of tests after you left and everything was normal, which is actually an insult in my book because I am anything but normal."
"Wanna go for a ride?" The horse snorted and nudged him. He smiled and opened the door. He grabbed the blanket and saddle and strapped them on to the horse.  He climbed up and positioned himself on the saddle, taking a deep breath. "Alright RJ, take it easy on me. I haven't ridden in twelve years."   He clicked his tongue and tugged the reins to the left. RJ responded and trotted out of the barn. He let RJ go into a canter as they headed out. He didn't really know where he wanted to go. He just wanted to ride. He smiled as the memories of just riding around with Dean came to him.
"Eyes open." Dean bit his lip as he keep his eyes on Cas' electric blue eyes. He felt his eyes flutter closed. And then a pinch at the base of his dick that made his eyelids fly open again. "I told you, eyes open. I need to see those green eyes."
The wedding was at the lake. Just Sam, Jess, John, Ellen, Bobby, Jo, and Adam were invited. Dean didn't want anyone else to know, neither did Cas. They just wanted to be left alone. They never hurt anyone. It didn't really bother him. He wanted a small quiet wedding anyways. Unfortunately, they had to pay the minister extra just to marry them. Dean wondered in being Gay would always be considered a sin. He stood there on the alter as everyone made their way out. Dean shifted waiting on baited breath to see Cas. Then, finally Cas made his entrance. John had Dean's video camera and was now recording Dean's reaction. His face lit up as Cas slowly walked to him. Both smiling from ear to ear. He looked so handsome in his white tuxedo. Dean wanted nothing more than to meet him halfway and kiss him. Dean's eyes filled with tears as he continued to smile at the love of his life. As the minister spoke, Dean got lost in Cas. He took Cas' hands in his. "I understand Dean and Castiel have made their own vows. Dean would you like to say yours first?" Dean nodded, he never took his eyes off Cas. "The second I saw you in that diner, my heart knew before my mind did that I wanted to be with you for the rest of my life. When you said you were travailing around the country, I thought I'd never get this chance. I had to do something to keep you here with me. You stood right by my side as a walked through hell twice, even though you were thousands of miles away. If I didn't have you, I may have died that day in the woods of Germany. You kept me going. You still keep me going, continuing to stand by my side through the headaches and the nightmares. You take it all in stride even though I know it scared the hell out of you. I wouldn't be standing here today if it weren't for you. I love you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you."
He drove for a few minutes, then stopped at Starbucks, cutting the engine. He took off his helmet and rubbed the top of his head.
He closed his locker and leaned against it. “Does he really expect me to just stay out of it?” She put a hand on his shoulder. “That's not very easy to answer. Cas is a very confusing person. He wants help but he's to afraid to ask for it. He's more of a suffer in silence person.” Dean shook his head. “He's ashamed.” Five minutes before lunch, Dean was sitting in his AP English class tapping his pencil on his notebook. He pulled out his phone and sent a text to Charlie. “What's Cas' address?” Seconds past “Why?” “Just give me the damn address.” “724 East Magnolia.” He put his phone back in hos pocket and gathered his things. He stood up, putting his things in his bag. “And where are you going Mr. Winchester?” He looked up at Mr Locke and smiled walking to the door. “Lunch.” He backed out just as the bell rang. He turned around, throwing his bag over his shoulder, he ran out the front and to the Impala. He opened the driver door, throwing his bag beside him and started the car. When it roared to life, he tore out of the parking lot and down the road.
"Maybe. I mean, there's only so much you can handle Dean. And I've been more than a pain in the ass. When you yelled at me, I felt like I kinda deserved it but in all reality I knew you were scared. Probably because you knew I'd probably derail but not know how bad it was gonna be."
Cas sat and thought for a moment. "I don't know, Charlie. I... I can't. I need some time. And a shower."
Inside the country club bathroom, Dean was trying to tie his tie. He wasn't succeeding. His fingers seemed to have forgotten how to do this.
Dean looked at the smile on Cas' face. He couldn't help smiling himself. He was glad Cas was happy. He would give anything to keep that smile on Cas' face. Dean put his beer to his lips and took a slow drink, watching Cas with everyone, laughing and being the Cas he fell in love with when he was sixteen. After everything he'd been through, Dean felt like life was coming together for him. It was definitely worth waiting twelve years for. Dean took another drink. Cas looked over at Dean and winked as he took a drink of his beer. Dean smiled. "Come here you." He pulled Cas closer and kissed him. He smiled as he watched the look of surprise on Cas' face turn to contentment. Dean smiled against Cas' lips, stifling a laugh when the other man's eyelids fluttered. Cas pulled back and look at Dean.
It had been months. It felt like years. Despite everything, the family never gave up on Dean. Even when people told Sam and John to have a funeral, they both refused. John only talked to Sam about Dean. Every time Cas was around he would look at him like it was his fault Dean went missing. He wanted nothing more than to slap him across the face for how he treated Dean. But he was obviously singing a different tune when he found out Dean was wounded and taken prisoner.
"I almost broke my promise. I almost did come home to you." Dean propped himself up. He looked into Cas' eyes. "When the grenade went off, everything happened in slow motion. I remember lying there. Adam was yelling at the medic Ryder. I heard Ryder say there was nothing that could be done. That I was going to die. And the only thing I could think about was you. How I would never see you again." He stopped himself, shaking his head. He didn't realize he was crying til Cas wiped the tears from his face. He wrapped his arms around him. "I'm sorry." Cas gently rubbed his back. "It's okay. You're home now. With me."
Dean walked through the gate and put his ear buds in. Cas downloaded the album on his phone so he had it before anyone else. The first song that played was "Ever After". He smiled as he took his seat.
Then he was surrounded. Someone grabbed Cas. A few stood in front of his family so they don't jump in. Dean looked over at Cas. His capture held a knife to his throat. He slowly looked back to Mack. Four surrounding him, three making sure his family stayed put, and one had Cas. Dean took off his suit jacket and his dress shirt, tossing them aside. He knew this would end bloody. He put his hands up. "Fine. Don't hurt him. You want me? You got me." Mack took one step forward. "I know you won't go with out a fight." He said pushing the bat into Dean's torso. Dean hit it away. "God damn right I won't." He punched Mack in the nose. The first man stepped forward, swinging his own bat. Dean ducked and swung his leg low, connecting with the back of the man's knee. He flipped back over Dean's leg and hit the ground. Mack swung his bat. Connecting with Dean's ribs. Another man put Dean in a choke hole and Mack continued his assault. He could hear Jo and Ellen screaming. John, Adam, and Sam were trying to break free of the three men. Cas was yelling, begging them to stop. Dean squeezed his eyes shut. preparing himself for what he was about to do, knowing it would hurt...a lot. He elbowed the man in his ribs. When the man loosened his grip Dean hit him full force with his head. Steel plate connecting with his nose, breaking it. Dean grunted in pain, but he couldn't stop. He turned and kicked the man in his temple. The man collapsed to the ground. The fourth man entered the fray and hit Dean with a tire iron in the back of Dean's head, hitting the plate. Dean buckled instantly, bringing him to his knees. Mack hit him across his face with the bat. He collapsed to the ground. "We didn't want to do this Dean. You were a good kid." Dean spat out blood and coughed. He slowly got to his feet. "I went to collage with Hector, your boy. Kinda funny he's the sheriff now. We had a thing. well more like a one night stand. He was drunk though. Funny thing is, until recently I thought he didn't remember it. When he found out I was getting married, he said he'd help me out by patrolling the lake." Dean smiled. He took a wobbly step forward. "Just in case you missed it, I fucked your son. And he loved it." Mack hit him with the bat again. Dean fell to the ground. He walked over the the man holding Cas, taking the knife. He walked back over. Dean looked at Cas and smiled weakly. Cas was crying. his body shaking with sobs. He looked up at Mack. "Go ahead. Kill a soldier. You and your friends will be in prison the rest of your lives." He coughed. Mack drove the knife into Dean's torso. Dean gasp. Cas screamed.
Dean had never known any other life than this one. Up at the buttcrack of dawn, feeding the animals, fixing things with his hands. A day wasn't complete if he didn't walk in the door drenched in sweat and dirt. He wrestled a fence post out of the hole it was stuck in. Dean threw the old post into the truck and replaced it with a new one. He repeated this process for a few hours.
Dean looked at Cas. "Go unload your horse." He kissed Cas and pushed him playfully out of the truck.
Finally, he and Dean made their way to the Impala. As Cas closed the door and sat down in the passenger seat, he let out a sigh."What's wrong, babe?" Cas  looked at Dean. "I only have a couple more weeks of you before everything changes. I'm not looking forward to it."
The concert was tomorrow and Cas was more than excited about it. He had been walking around the house with ear buds in singing along with every Marianas Trench song. He would play a few on his guitar in his room. He was pretty sure his mom couldn't wait for it either so Cas would shut up about it. When he told Charlie, she screamed her head off. The band was excited as well. Cas also focused his energy into writing a few new songs, hoping he'd get to play one on stage. He was more excited about playing on stage with his idol. Like Cas, Josh Ramsay, the lead singer, wrote all of the songs himself. Cas couldn't think of a single song he didn't like.Dean sat on the end of Cas' bed, listening to him play. "Did you pick one out yet?"Cas sighed. "No. I finished all of them down to how it should sound. Sent samples to the band so they can learn them and wrote sheet music for a freaking orchestra for one of them." He clicked his mouse a few times, putting the latest one together to send it.
Cas sighed. "But I do have a bodyguard." He smiled at Dean as he pushed the door open. "Besides, what better way to announce to the world I'm back?" He winked as they got in line. They walked up to the counter. The barista widened her eyes as she realized who Dean was. Dean smiled.
It had been a few weeks and still no word from Cas. Dean woke up every day with a hole right through him. He knew Charlie had tried, but Cas closes off when he's hurt, and he was definitely past hurt.
"Hey babe. I need a shower. Care to join..." he stopped when he saw Dean's face. "Babe. What's wrong?"
He killed the engine and walked the bike by the Impala. After putting it on the kickstand, he got off and walked up to the door, taking off his helmet before knocking. The door opened. "You don't have to knock you know."
The song changed again and Cas got up and grabbed his guitar. He grabbed the mic and put it on the stand at the front of the stage.
Dean felt his knees buckle and he slipped a little on the wall. He felt the heat growing in his groin and a pleasant pain. He couldn't hold back any longer.
"Dean Henry, get out of bed! You have an early practice remember?" He opened his eyes and groaned. He looked at his clock. 5:30 am. "Shit!" He got out of bed and walked to his closet, grabbing his jersey and a plain white t-shirt then to his dresser and grabbed a pair of jeans, socks, and boxers. He got dressed and made his way downstairs. Where there was a glass of orange juice, two toaster pastries, and a protein bar waiting for him. He downed the orange juice and grabbed the food. Then walked over to the kitchen table and grabbed his backpack and keys. Taking a bite of a toaster pastry, he slipped on his shoes and opened the front door. "See you at the game!" He called to his mom. He walked down the path to the driveway. He got in the Impala his mom had bought him for his sixteenth birthday. He started the car, letting it idle just so he can hear it for a moment. He would never get tired of hearing his baby pur. He smiled and backed out of the driveway. He popped a mixtape of 80's rock and headed to school.
Cas sighed again. “Let’s go before grandma has a stroke.” The horn went off again, and grandma was leaning out of the passenger side window. “Move it, Naomi!”
River was going insane. Bucking and rearing up on his hind legs. "The fuck is wrong with you?" The horse didn't stop. Dean just rolled his eyes. "Stupid horse. Just like your owner."
Everyone stared at Dean. He had never said anything like that to Alec before. Alec grabbed his tray and got up. “Whatever dude. Just trying to give you suggestions.”
"By the way. I just seen something on YouTube called the boyfriend tag and I think you and Dean should do it."
"Okay, unfortunately I have to go get ready. My mom will kick my ass if she doesn't get pictures before graduation." He gave Dean a quick kiss. "See you in a bit." He got up and grabbed his helmet from the end of the stage.
Cas pulled Dean in and kissed him. Dean didn't think it was possible for the crowd to get any louder, but they did as soon as Cas kissed him.
"Amazing as usual." Dean smiled. Cas was wearing a blazer with a red button down shirt underneath with a white tie, black faded skinny jeans and converse. It may be a huge event, but Cas never dressed up except for the wedding of course. The band had been nominated for best music video, best album, and best artist. They were also performing.
Cas acted shocked. "Bill! I'm working. Do you really think I'd... yeah never mind I would. I'll be a good boy for you. This time."
Dean looked at him. “You just...get your food.” He grabbed an extra carton of milk, the ones they would give out in school, and put it on Cas' tray then walked away. Cas looked after him in total confusion. Alec laughed.
"It uh, it was a nightmare. About my parents...how they died. Every time I have that damn dream...the closer I get to saving them, but never do. I always wake up almost as soon as I get in the barn."
So I decided to keep the going back and forth between past and present up until the wedding. Meaning next chapter as well. ENJOY!
Cas looked at Charlie. He was broken. Charlie had seen him through a lot and knew what he looked like when he was about to run."Don't do it, Cas. He loves you. And I know you love him."
The group pulled into the parking lot at the pool hall. Charlie, Benny, Meg, and Adam jumped out of Benny's truck and walked in. Inside the Impala, Dean reached for the door handle to let himself out. He was interrupted by Cas pulling him backwards, kissing him full on the mouth. Dean let out a small groan as Cas held him there for a minute, feasting on his lips slowly. Cas pulled back and kissed Dean on the tip of his nose and smiled. Dean smiled back. "Hi."
By mid-September Dean could walk on his own. His doctor was impressed and pleased with his progress and told him he should be able to return to active duty early next year. He had received a few letters from Adam asking how he's doing. He said he finished his tour awhile back but was told to be ready to ship out again at a moments notice. He would ask how Cas is doing and say hi for him, hoping to meet him one day. Cas was listening to the radio in the living room. "You'll never know" by Vera Lynn started playing. Dean stood up and walked into the living room. He pushed the coffee table out of the way then pulled Cas to his feet. He put his hands on Cas' waist. Cas put his arms around him.
Dean shrugged. "Maybe I'm not as far in the closet as you think. Maybe I wasn't as drunk as I thought Friday night. Maybe I enjoyed it as much as you did."
Sam was basically falling off the couch with laughter at this point. Dean sighed. "I need more coffee." He stood up and walked to the kitchen. "I can buy you some condoms if you want."
Three hours later, Cas had counted the dots on the ceiling tiles...twice. The room was completely silent except for the sound of his breathing. He sighed and rolled over, burying his face in the pillow. "Kill me now..." The door opened and he looked to see Gadreel standing there. "Brought you a present." He held up a radio with a CD player. He set it on the table and plugged it in. He pulled out a bunch of CD's from under his shirt. "Your boyfriend gave me these before he left." He set them on the table next to the radio. Cas grabbed them and filtered through them. All mix CD's of the bands Cas listens to. He must have grabbed them when Cas wasn't looking. "Try to keep it down though. The walls aren't sound proof." Cas opened the CD player and put in a CD, turning the volume on medium. The room filled with the sound of Mayday Parade. He fell back on the bed. "You're an angel Gadreel."
Cas climbed the stairs to the projection booth and opened the door. "Hey Rufus. Thanks for helping me." The man turned to Cas. "No problem kid. Got the video?" Cas handed him a flash drive. Rufus took it and download the contents. He played with a few things for a minute. "Alright, everything is set. It'll come on before the previews."
Dean watched Cas play and sing. He looked like he didn't have a care in the world when he was singing. He looked at Dean every so often and Dean would smile at him. He sounded like a mix between Chester Bennington and Adam Gontier, smooth and rough at the same time. It gave Dean chills, in a good way. Cas had a gift. He was good at playing his guitar and singing. Scratch that, he was amazing at both. The crowd yelled and cheered. Cas went right into the next song. "This song is by Chevelle. This is 'Send The Pain Below.'"
Dean didn't really know what to expect when he dropped Cas off. He definitely wasn't expecting to be greeted by Cas' Dad.
He felt his heart stop. Walking up to the house from the barn was a tall, tan-skinned farmhand wearing worn jeans, old boots, and a cowboy hat, glistening with the sweat of a hard day's work. Castiel bit his lip. Shit.
“This is my mate, Castiel. The Betas took him from me three days ago and brought him here. I made damn sure to get my mate back, I can get yours back too.”
"Well smack my grandma and kiss me sideways. Is that Cas Novak standing in front of me?" Castiel rolled his eyes. "Nice to see you, Benny."
Dean rolled his eyes and took the phone. "Okay, last question. Where do you see yourself in five years?"
When the show started the host walked out on stage. "Alright everyone, welcome to the VMA's. Is everyone ready for a good show?" Everyone clapped and cheered. "We have a lot to get to tonight and a bunch of performances. So let's get this party started!"
"Wait. You probably want the flashy part." Cas grabbed Dean's left hand and slid the black band with white-gold inlay and single diamond onto his ring finger. Through the whole thing, Charlie could barely contain herself. Now she had her hand over her mouth and squealing, stamping her feet on the floor. Cas rolled his eyes. "Calm down Red, you're gonna hemorrhage."
Before they let him go home, they awarded him with the purple heart and promoted to Corporal. He wasn't going to complain about being promoted two ranks. His face had a few scars from the explosion. As well as his arms and torso. On top of his legs, they did a few surgeries on his head to fix the plate. They told him once he got home, a wheelchair would be delivered. They didn't want him walking very much. As he was boarding his plane home, his unit saluted him as Adam wheeled him to the gate where a doctor from the VA was waiting. Dean turned himself around and looked at his unit. "I'll be back." He laughed as he returned the salute.
Dean looked at him. "We're not having this conversation right now." Cas looked back at Dean. He felt like there was a hole right in the center of his body. "Dean, I..." Dean sank a solid, and then stood up. The look on his face was a mix of pissed off and hurt. "Not now, Castiel. Not now. You're stripes." Dean didn't make eye contact with Cas.
Charlie playfully punched Adam in the arm. “Just catching up. I haven’t a chance to get all the dirt on my bestie!” Benny walked up next to Charlie. “Well, get in the truck. Dean is still a little sore about all this and I don’t know how he’d feel knowing you were out here without telling him.” Charlie rolled her eyes and headed to the truck with Adam. Cas gave a last look at the barn.
"Yes. You did." He grabbed his keys off the counter and walked out the door, slamming it behind him. He made his way to his motorcycle and swung his leg over then started it.
Castiel spat the words out without thinking. "Third door to the left, hold the handle down when you flush it, and don't flush when someone is in the shower." Dean looked at him, puzzled. "Ummm, yeah... there's only... a few people who know that..."
There was no more sound except the sound of their breathing. Time stopped completely. It was just them. Their hearts beating in perfect harmony. Then, all too soon it seemed, Dean pulled back. They opened their eyes and Dean rested his forehead on Cas'. "Happy New Year Cas." He smiled.
The crowd was on their feet and exploding. Cas raised a fist in the air and bowed. He was out of breath and sweaty but he didn't care. He turned to the band, who were just as excited.The band gathered around Cas, patting him on the back. Marianas Trench walked out. Josh looked to the crowd. "I think I just shit myself! Holy fuck!" The crowed roared again. Josh high fived and man-hugged Cas. "Seriously! That was fucking AMAZING!" Cas smiled.
"Guess I better slow down then." Cas backed Dean up to the bed and pushed him down. He pulled Dean's jeans off the rest of the way, his boxers going with them. Cas climbed on top of Dean and devoured his chest and torso, finally reaching his swollen cock. He flicked his tongue across Dean's tip then closed his mouth around it. Dean let out a long sigh, grabbing a fist full of Cas' hair. Cas moved slowly up and down, working the shaft with his hand. Dean's head fell back in a moan. Cas moved a bit faster, moving his hand and rubbed Dean's hole. Dean reached for his jeans and grabbed a small bottle of lube, handing it to Cas. Cas squirted a drop on his finger and rubbed it on Dean then slowly pushed a finger inside him.
As always, going around and opening Cas door. He took Cas by the hand and walked to the door, unlocked it, and let Cas through first. It wasn't a big room, but it had the basics. TV, mini fridge, bathroom, and a queen size bed. Dean set their things on the table and turned to Cas, arms out. "Welcome to the Winchester hotel." He joked. Cas rolled his eyes.
"I don't kiss and tell." Dean took a beer from the fridge,  opened it, and took a big drink. "What's on the agenda, folks?"
When they got to the house, Cas slowly made his way to the bed and fell face first on it. "One day down three months to go." He groaned. He rolled over on his back. "So, what do you think?" He asked Dean.
Ten seconds left in the fourth and the game was tied. There was no way in hell he was about to let this game go into overtime. There was only one problem, number twenty-three. The whole second half he was on Dean like white on rice, making it very difficult for Dean to make a play let alone get rid of the damn ball.
The sun was about to set when he got to the park. He heard the low rumble of a muscle car and turned around. It was Dean.
"Yeah?" Cas was going through Dean's sketch book. He was the only one that was ever allowed to even touch it. "Will you ever come back?" He asked quietly. Cas looked at him. "I don't know." Cas replied honestly. Dean nodded and looked down at his apple, suddenly not hungry. "I don't want you to go." Cas sat beside him. "I don't want to either, but I told you, I have too."
Cas had no idea how long he would be gone, so he just packed a small bag that held a weeks worth of clothes. His mom said she'd drop off more if needed. The three of them rode in silence all the way to Kansas City. Cas could hear his mom sniffing back tears as she drove. He knew she thought some of this was her fault. None of it was. They pulled up to the entrance of the rehab facility. Two orderlies were already waiting for him. One a burly looking man, the other a small woman. "Great, their gonna good cop bad cop me." He grabbed his bag and opened the door. Dean and his mom got out as well. His mom wrapped him in a hug. "This isn't your fault mom." He said. She pulled away and smiled. "You just get better." He smiled and nodded. He looked at Dean who was leaning against the car. Dean took a few steps to him.
The group sat around a high top table at the local bar. Charlie leaned closer to Dean. "Should he be doing that?" she asked as Castiel was downing shot after shot. "He never could hold his alcohol." Dean looked at Cas and shook his head and sighed. "Well, he's a big boy now. Far be it from me to tell him he can't." He set his beer on the table. Several more shots later, Cas stood up from his stool at the table. At least, he tried to stand up. He began to fall over and was caught by Dean.
"You do realize we're in public, with no bodyguard, and you haven't been seen at all in almost two and a half months."
He looked through the peep hole and instantly wished he hadn't. He let out a sigh before opening the door.
Cas stepped out of the changing room and his mother nearly cried. “Castiel James you look absolutely amazing! How is it you're still single? The ladies should be just eating you up…” Cas shot a glare at Gabriel, who was trying not to laugh. He swallowed and forced a smile. “Guess I'm just too busy for lady-hunting, ma. But I do like this jacket. It's nicely tailored. Even if it is a knock-off Armani.” Cas winked at Gabriel, who had to excuse himself because he was laughing so hard. If Cas had to be stuck here with his ridiculous family, who continue to deny who Castiel James Novak really was, then he was going to be as gay as possible for his own entertainment.

He smiled, pulling the tab off the can. Sam walked over and handed them each a noise maker. Dean looked at the clock, thirty minutes left. The song changed to a slow song.
