The stifling, anguished atmosphere of the veiled lodger's lonely room followed us back to Baker Street. Side by side on the cab ride from Brixton, we leaned away from each other into our respective corners, morose and silent. The air was thick. A solitary gust stirred as we skirted Hyde Park, throwing up handfuls of grit and dust.
Miss Sutherland had been leaning over the letters for only a moment when she gasped aloud and her hand flew to her mouth. She had looked wan already, but now seemed almost ill. "They were written on the same type-writer, oh God," she said, staring at the tiny smudge of misplaced ink upon the key that had been stamped above each "e" on both samples.

"Oh excellent, Miss Sutherland," Holmes exclaimed. "You've done just wonderfully so far."
. He raised his eyebrows in silent question, and I told him the crisis was averted. He lifted both hands to cover his face. Before leaving him to the privacy his wracked anxieties deserved, I lowered my eyes and apologised as directly and simply as I knew how. I had meant to embarrass him, not endanger him, but my poor judgement had nearly proved catastrophic.
Both of us turned expectantly to Holmes, and it was only then we realised he did not seem to share in our merry spirit. On the contrary, he looked chagrined, and the both of us attended to his cue immediately. Despite its ridiculous trappings, this case must conceal some serious misdeed. We sobered and shared an apprehensive glance.
He had told me how stupid I was. Of course, in his right mind he could never have been so cruel, but even knowing that he was beyond reason, I’d still been stunned by his vituperation. I had never suspected that my slowness at the deductive side of casework could have inspired such awful resentment. On the contrary, I had always thought that he rather enjoyed keeping me in suspense. I’d been as confused and astonished as I was hurt by the agonizing bitterness pouring out of him. He’d screamed at me: that I understood nothing, that my blindness was crippling, that I drove him to despair. That he wished to God he had never met me, never burdened himself with a companion so utterly hopeless.
"That's what I like to hear," Holmes grinned. "Nothing like a confession to clear the air of an evening. So, you say it is not actionable, do you? And what if I accuse you of entrapment, what with your coming to her in disguise and giving a false name?"
it's why you had no respect for me, isn't it? Even before you learned of my history."
I wavered, then said, “I’m sure it was for his kindness to Mycroft
And with that, the landing door burst open with a flash of magnesium powder. The newspaper reporter currently dressed as our housekeeper announced from behind her camera, "I heard it all, gentlemen, and many thanks for getting him to confess a little louder. My editor will love that."
“What was it,” I asked instead, “that finally opened your eyes to my feelings?”
Your step-father pretends to care about money, Miss Sutherland, and he pretends to care about pride. But what he actually cares about is power. He uses money to gain control over people, particularly women. He threw away your mother's money to pin her down so she couldn't fight him, and then he mounted this cruel ruse against you to force her into complicity. What I am telling you now is not mere speculation. I called upon your mother this afternoon and, by assuring her of both privacy and protection, I was able to confirm the truth. Mr. Windibank let her think she could protect you if she played along with him; that if she stayed on his good side she could set limits. He mustn't touch you, he mustn't embarrass you publicly, he mustn't go through with the fake marriage.
That practical tone of his—some nights it almost seemed I could catch hold of it, turning over the inflections in my palm like a well-worn pebble. 'I'm glad you were with me today,' I said.
"Why do you think I came to you through this godforsaken snow with my breath in my fist? I'm here because I daren't go home
I was left questioning my resolutions yet again.
"Miss Sutherland," Holmes said gently, "I am truly sorry to say it, but I fear that you've been surrounded by deeper and darker waters than you realise. It is a tribute to your own good sense that you've escaped unscathed from so much of the intended harm, but still, there must be a reckoning. I'll do my best to help you face it."
Holmes had never been one to sit at table, preferring to perch with one leg propped on the window sash, observing the street below. When I finished my meal he was midway through his second cigarette, making use of his empty teacup as an ashtray. I had just looted the pelican for the morning
"How gratifying."
Once your story crosses my headmaster's desk, he is going to take it as confirmation of those earlier accusations. Upon consulting his payroll ledger, he will see that I was away from my post, unaccounted for
He opened the sitting room door at my knock, eyes smiling, and ushered me into our old rooms. Both they and he looked to be in comfortable disarray, and for once smelled of nothing worse than stale coffee and ship's tobacco. Instinctively, I brushed my thoughts across the cool quiet of his mind, his loadstone presence a welcome weight. He pressed a soft kiss to the patch of bare neck just above my collar, but stepped away before I could catch hold of him.
During the years we’d lived together, I’d never seriously considered confessing my feelings. I took it to be an impossibility, and although my longing blazed fiercely at times, a friendship as all-encompassing as ours could not leave me truly unhappy. Our life at Baker Street had been almost conjugal, lacking only the bedroom. I mistook my contentment with that arrangement for proof that my passion for him was a mere inclination
"I assure you, I have never been more so."
“Have I got to circle back around to the main door?”
"It was cholera," I said quietly, "that kept me away."
We stared at each other, the apprehension in our eyes abruptly making allies of us. I shook my head, attempting to rally myself. "We'll just have to hope that matters haven't yet reached such a pass. I will pay a call to your headmaster
He had kept no piano at Baker Street, as we hadn't the room for it; but after his marriage, he and Mrs Watson had often played and sung together. On those rare occasions when I accepted their invitations to dine, we had always ended the evening gathered together around the piano bench, skimming through a pile of songbooks. We sang in turns, all together, and in pairs, and their duets were filled with warmth and joy.
whether as a scientist in Europe or a consulting detective revived from the grave
Even after all my wandering, I had not many more answers now than I’d had to begin with. But I did, at least, have a fresh letter to read. I drew the envelope from my pocket, and a light breeze rustled through the tall cedars behind me as I unfolded the single sheet within.
“Vivez joyeux,” I quoted. “Live joyously, for laughter is the provenance of man.”

, sir!"
Young Billy showed her in, and as we stepped forward to make our introductions she broke into a wide smile. I could tell immediately that she was severely short-Sighted, for even standing directly before her and in physical contact as I bowed over her hand, I could pick up only a faint impression of excitement and the sense that our names were familiar to her. The block between our minds had none of the smoothness of a practiced mental shield; instead her thoughts and feelings reached me only in a soft blur. With her projection capabilities so stunted, her reception must be as bad or worse. I felt sure she could hardly See us. But as I stepped back and met her eyes, the lively mind behind them could not have been plainer.
He threw his spindly arms up. "You cannot honestly believe that a love affair of thirty years ago, however tragic its consequence, justifies you in blasting my life to ruins?"
"Mycroft!" Watson exclaimed.
This vision of myself went so against the grain that I could not hold back an incredulous chuckle. I opened my mouth to retort, but pulled up short as a memory intruded: a willow wood handle twisting bluntly in my hand as little Tadpole Phelps, puffed up and furious, crumpled like a rag doll over his barked shins.
In prose, Watson is competent; in person, he's electric.
Well, it won't surprise you to hear that purses and belts have got tighter in our household since. And maybe it's because I was so fond of my father, or maybe it's because Mr. Windibank is more of an age to be my sibling than my parent, but he and I have had a good deal of trouble making our peace. He has a tendency to order me about, and I'm afraid I don't always respond
. At that time, I didn't realise that Holmes was Blind—he hadn't told me. I respected his brilliance, of course; his penchant for knowing more details about every client than I could ever See in their minds; the casual way he'd break in and reply to my thoughts even when they were utterly insignificant—when I was doing no more than contemplating a portrait on a rainy day! I thought he was the most naturally gifted psychic I had ever met. I would have believed him if he'd told me he surpassed the known Sight scale.
I knew how a man might spend year after year stacking thought upon thought only to find that, no matter how pragmatically he ordered his head, he couldn't make of it a house in which to live comfortably. After all that layering, his mind still resembled an unplumbed well, smooth-walled and soft-shadowed, in which any dropped pebble could raise echoes.
I found Miss Sutherland, sweaty and bare-headed but with an air of weary calm about her, sitting on the stoop facing our tiny, fenced back garden. Mrs. Hudson and the maids knew better than to touch, let alone eat, anything from the wild assortment of shoots, shrubs, and creeping vines that Holmes considered worth cultivating, so the spot ran happily to seed. I extracted an old rain barrel from the unsettling cluster of Doll's Eyes by the gate. The staves were no longer in any shape to hold water but hadn't rotted through. Making of it an impromptu stool, I sat beside her and settled into silence. We listened to the sounds of traffic from Baker Street, the occasional songbird. I could see the horsewhip through the kitchen window behind us; she'd hooked it neatly on an empty peg of the herb rack.
The stroke of Watson's thumb across the back of my hand pulled me from my thoughts again. His gaze was sympathetic, and he didn't try to tell me that these wretched reflections did no one any good. He merely stood, pulling me to him, and grazed his fingertips across my cheek. For months we had made free with our caresses, but I remained profoundly susceptible even to the least of them.
In any case, I was born Blind, and I came by that inheritance honestly, for my brother shares it. Our mother was a Two and our father a Five, and neither had the least idea how to assist us. They were convinced that we would be neither marriageable nor employable should our weakness be known, and they categorically refused to send us to any specialised Institute for education or charity.
all hail liberty, equality, and considerably more than fraternity.
" His mouth pursed as he bit at the inside of his cheek. With a shake of his head, he leaned forward in his chair. "I think, perhaps, that I have something to tell you. Not with the intention of wounding you, although I know it will. I'm raising this only because I wish
An hour later he emerged to join me for a supremely awkward luncheon, and I gave him a more thorough account of my conversation with Price-Jones. The atmosphere between us settled into one of tentative truce.
The chill of revulsion that sank through me at this monstrous revelation must have been as nothing compared to Miss Sutherland's horror. Tears streamed unheeded down her cheeks as a white, cold, blazing fury seemed visibly to wrack her body.
That was the very last answer I expected, and it raised such an unlooked-for tumult within me that we took the remainder of the evening to come to grips with it.
I forced myself to consider. To dredge up the worst of his words and weigh them. The misery of those dreadful hours was branded into my memory.
By the next year I had committed to retirement and joined Watson in Sussex. Country life was encumbered by its share of inconvenience, but that was nothing in comparison to the freedoms it offered. Together, we began to allow ourselves more room to love, and be loved, unguardedly.
"And yet, the news reports have uncovered nothing so grand. Shall we test your proposition? 'A Husband's Cruelty Ends Fifty-Year Marriage.' I've not read a word, but the outline of events is surely predictable. I'd bet on a history of drink, a string of affairs, and the slow escalation of violence until some sympathetic friend helped the sufferer to break free."
" He broke off, dragging a wrist across his forehead. His eyes lowered to the carpet. "I do wish to make what small amends I can to Master Sherlock."
At any rate, I had a comfortable life and no cause for complaint so long as he was with us, but he passed to his reward three years ago. He left us well-provided for with a share in his business and a steady income, for his foreman, Mr. Hardy, was a loyal friend who didn't resent carrying on the partnership with Mam. I kept up our book-keeping without drawing a salary—why rob Peter to pay Paul?—but for pocket money, I hired myself out to type and mail some of the bills for a department store down Oxford Street. Mam and I never were what you'd call close, but as far as domestic troubles go, we had none worth mentioning. Between my work and a small inheritance, I brought in a hundred pounds per annum, and the business cleared five times that. We didn't want for anything.
It was a consolation that Watson thought my time researching here had been well-spent. Before coming to France, I had been adrift for too long, and a sense of shame lingered over those directionless years. Finding work worth doing had felt like stepping out of a mire and back onto solid ground.
I was too surprised to know how to answer him. Without raising his eyes, Moriarty offered a small, wry grimace.
Though hardly prone to poetic impressions, I seemed almost to glimpse a light between them; a kindness bright enough to illuminate both, in their painful similarities, unashamed.
Watson stared into my eyes; intent, respectful, and silent. I kept going.
I asked Watson what we should do tomorrow, and he said that I should take him to the seaside.
I frowned, wholly at a loss. "No, I'm not aware of any personal or professional disaster at that time
But at the open mischief in his looks, I couldn't help but smile. I'd come to him drained to the dregs tonight, but it made no difference. After ten minutes of his nonsense, I felt more awake than I had in days. Give that man a shovel, and he could unearth well-springs in the barest dust.
While outside our window the miles rolled monotonously past, he advanced from tale to tale in perfect command of his small, rapt audience. He knew quite well the effect he had on me, but was evidently both surprised and relieved that Mrs Ronder smiled to hear him. The cut of her veil left her mouth freely visible, its bright curve an expressive counterpoint to the blank fabric hiding her face.
Watson was not ham-fisted, and so did not rush to reassure me that Mycroft and I bore no blame in the matter; I grasped that perfectly well, intellectually. He simply rested a hand on my shoulder, thanked me, and said, “She must have been very proud of you both. I would like to hear more of your mother one day.”
, and picked up a pen from my desk. He scribbled a line just below the last item on the published list, then handed over the open-faced tome with a flourish.
“Yes,” Watson said. “Yes, that’s precisely what I want. Our old friendship, but with the chance of more, if more comes naturally. That’s what I came to France to ask of you.”
He held me steady.
"I am not shocked so much as incredulous," I retorted. "In all the years I’ve known him, in all the time we’ve spent together, I’ve never seen Holmes show any real partiality toward another man."
"Dr. Watson," said Moriarty, "pardon me for calling on you again so soon." I formed the distinct impression that he had surprised himself, as much as me, by coming back.
"Miss Sutherland," I exclaimed, "you're a peach!"
” I floundered, lost for the right word
Eventually, I wore myself down. At half past nine, Watson laid a hand over mine. Had he acted sooner I probably would have brushed him off, but his sixth sense was as attuned to me as mine to him, and at his touch I discovered myself equal to conversation.
Watson drafted a letter of appeal. Without naming names, he conveyed succinctly our client's state of mind and current circumstances. The details of her history he kept private, but he openly described the mutilation of her face so that it wouldn't come as an undue shock should Mrs Cubitt agree to a meeting. What we hoped our client might gain through the introduction, he emphasised, was the support of another lady who could understand her struggles. But, of course, Mrs Cubitt knew best whether she was in a position to reach out without endangering her hard-won peace of mind.
"My life?" he pressed quietly. "My livelihood? My freedom? You have not hesitated to appoint yourself my judge and jury, but even so, I think I had a right to answer your accusations before you set me upon the pillory." He sighed, pressing the heel of one hand to his temple with every appearance of exhausted grief. "I don't believe I could have saved anyone that day, had I stayed. I truly don't. You are not wrong to call me a selfish coward, for once the gun came out I had no thought except to run. That much is true. But in the years since, I have not lived so free from guilt as you seem to think.
In the meantime, Miss Sutherland—the doormaid for whom Windibank had spared not a second glance—advanced on him like one of the Furies from ancient Aeschylus.
"Another man apart from you, you mean?"
Sigmund Freud Papers: General Correspondence
abuse."
'I know,' he said. 'Of course, we must. We shall.'
Holmes set about escorting our reporter and her camera out, pausing to discuss in greater detail the full extent to which the family wished the truth to be made public. Leaving them to it, I searched in turn for our friend.
"Just between you and me," she said, her voice electric, "what you did to my mother, and to me, was as cruel and selfish and heartless a sin as ever I saw. Someone should lay a horsewhip across your shoulders for it. In fact…" her eye drifted to our fireside and the weighted hunting crop Holmes kept for emergencies, "…I think I shall just treat myself to—"
Below their signatures, a brief post-script had been added in Mrs Ronder's hand. 'I am glad that I took your advice, Mr Holmes.'
Watson had been spending more of his days and nights away from Baker Street. In later years he would write of having taken up his own rooms in Queen Anne Street, but in truth it was to a modest cottage in Sussex, framed in the Queen Anne style, that he retired. We had chosen it together only six months previous—a gentle climax to the recent cataclysm in our personal affairs.
I emerged from my bedroom to find that the morning post had brought another letter from Watson, and the chemist’s boy had already come by with today’s deliveries.
And although the publicity had been somewhat mortifying for our friend, in the end it apparently paid.
"I'm sorry," Holmes said, "but it is your step-father who has baited you so cruelly."
I, who knew him best in the world? It hurt me even to entertain the idea. Of his love for me, and mine for him, I’d never been in doubt, but his affection had no more exceeded the bounds of friendship than had mine.
that's the first place any constables will come looking."
The dismay on my face was not lost on the professor.
He brushed the back of his hand across my shoulders on his way to the sideboard. He poured us both a nightcap, then tossed the settee cushions one by one into a pile by the coal-scuttle. I joined him on the floor. We clinked glasses and let conversation drop in favour of the soft sounds of the fire. It was burning down, and soon the ash would smother the flames to embers. Holmes sat cross-legged in his mouse-coloured gown, head cocked as if he were mentally rehearsing his fiddle. After a quarter hour, I lay back and let my head rest on his knee. Absently, he carded my hair.
"Forgive me, sir," he said at last, in a far different tone. "I had intended to let matters rest, but … I find I'm not sure that I should. There is something
'Cubitt,' he said slowly, his finger hovering over the screaming headline from an old Norfolk gazette. 'Mrs Elsie Cubitt.'
I had been present when Freud had coaxed the truth from Holmes under hypnosis. I'd felt the stunning weight of revelation as so many facets of my friend’s character had traced themselves back to the great betrayals of his youth: his tutor’s wandering eye, his mother's infidelity, and his father's brutality. In the moment of discovery, the psychological effects of all this had seemed inarguable, like the grand conclusion to one of Holmes's most intricate cases.
Miss Sutherland hid her face in her hands. I turned away to give her the space she needed and caught sight of Holmes listening at the kitchen window with a look in his eyes I had never seen before. Exultant. Disbelieving. Undone.
He was coming to me. I was going to tell him, at last.
Moriarty set the book back on the shelf and, remaining by the door, took hold of his hat, fumbling it from hand to hand. “I hope the both of you will forgive me for talking out of turn. I don’t know if any of these suppositions are true, but
, you know, which eggs him on. And add to that, he's a skinflint when it comes to allowing me to spend my own money. Of course I understand the bulk of it should go to running the house, but whenever I wish to make a day trip or have a night out, he finds excuses as to why I mustn't. I finally put my foot down when it came to the gas-fitters' ball last month, and once he saw that pitching a fit wouldn't sway me, he left in a huff. But I got my way, at least. And I can't regret it, for it was there that this plum of a mystery fell into my lap."
We had arranged in advance to stay the night at Ridling Thorpe before returning to London in the morning. After an excellent supper, we moved as a group to the library and elected Mrs Ronder to read aloud. Her voice and manner were eminently suited to public speaking, she having spent so many years addressing rowdy circus crowds from the center spotlight. The only blemish was that she did have to hold her book awkwardly close to succeed in reading it through her veil. She chose an American author in honour of our hostess, making her way through several eerie and macabre scribblings from that gothic oddity Edgar Allan Poe. (Mercifully, she avoided Dupin.) Mrs Cubitt was wholly unfamiliar with the works and seemed to find Mrs Ronder's performances very pleasantly bloodcurdling; she was full of exclamations and scooted ever closer to the edge of her seat as each tale unfolded. Watson, too, was thoroughly entranced, as he is by all great storytelling.
I ignored his choked sputter, turning my back and addressing my attentions to the grate. The embers from the day's fire had cooled to ash, and it would be too much trouble to light new coals at this hour. I dug into the kindling box and made due with a few armfuls of timber and newspaper. The sweet smell of maple smoke lingered on my sleeves.
"Oh, yes.” I paused, breathing deeply for a moment, knowing that if I began this story there would be no good place to end it. But Watson already knew the shape of this scar, at least in outline; I had no need to hide it. And the words were there, effortless to let go.
He tightened his hand around mine with an encouraging shake, and his smile, though tired, was earnest. 'It's not a problem to be solved in one night, though, Holmes. It's a human life and an independent will we have to deal with. You've done what you could to forestall any immediate tragedy, so don't reproach yourself for that sermon. As for what more might be done, we can sit down tomorrow and rummage through our connexions for anyone who could be of service to the lady. We'll find some leads worth pursuing, I'm sure.'
'You've been so kind. Though it may seem strange to say so on such short acquaintance, this day has meant a great deal to me. I should be more than glad of your friendship, but I cannot take it on false pretenses.' Stepping back from the reading stand, she sank abruptly into the nearest chair with a visible shake in her shoulders. 'I think that I must make to you the same confession I have made to these gentlemen, so that you may judge the truth for yourself. The details are not terribly important, though you may have them if you wish. But what I should tell you is this: I'm not an innocent. There is blood on my hands.'
Father disinherited Mycroft completely, and he likewise withdrew him from Eton. It had proven a den of iniquity, one to which he was never to return. As for me, I was never to go at all. He hired a private tutor for us, and that is how Professor Moriarty arrived in our home.”
"You're too kind, Doctor! I fear I come off as more of a fool, but I'm chuffed you take a generous view of the episode." She fished out a handkerchief and dabbed the last of the mirth from her eyes.
I smiled at him. “Our English tourists call that stubborn stretch of sand ‘the strand,’ you know.”
"I'll need a little time to gather evidence and formulate a plan of action. I know you must be anxious for explanations, my dear lady, but allow me to proceed carefully until I can confirm the facts beyond my current suspicions and probabilities. You can assist me by jotting down both your home address and that of your step-father's employer. If you would then be so good as to take tea somewhere in this neighbourhood and reconvene here at 4 o'clock. I believe I will be able to answer your questions by then."
so precisely balanced between challenge and inquiry
“Monsieur Dubois, how good it is to see you,” he said.
was this an attempt at blackmail? A threat to set an entirely different flavour of scandal racing through the city?
"Forgive me for running a little behind the hour, Mr. Holmes," he said. "I'm afraid my wife and daughter were called away from home in a hurry yesterday to assist a sick relative, and so when I arrived home from a week's travel earlier today, I found the household quite out-of-order. I don't think you'd guess just how much effort it took to find a clean suit to wear this evening."
There was only one point worth making. 'We must find something better than a sermon to offer her.'
"Good God, you might have said so to begin with," I managed weakly. I sank into my chair, sincerely horrified.
he may need your help to get beyond all this, one way or another. That’s all."
Our apartments had been prey to a series of increasingly desperate and damaging break-ins aimed at the destruction of our case files. This was neither the first nor last time that we had to deal with the paranoia of unscrupulous former clients, but the latest among them combined a superabundance of funds with a corresponding dearth of conscience and had managed to hire the most dangerous ruffians in greater London for his purpose. The most violent of the resulting incidents Watson would eventually recast within a purely fictional frame: while there never were any Garridebs or counterfeiters, there was a real shooting in our own sitting room and a terrible few moments in which I did not know if Watson lived or died.
In his recent letters, I seemed to catch implied invitations to confide in him. But what I had to confide could not be committed to paper, and my unease at the prospect of returning to England had never quite faded. I’d pushed all that aside at the time of Mrs. Watson’s passing and stayed with my friend through his first awful weeks of bereavement. But for the rest of my hiatus, I’d avoided all the places I’d once called home. My solitary, fevered existence during those last few years at Baker Street assumed such an awful aspect in hindsight that I couldn’t stomach the idea of revisiting the place while so much else in my life was still unresolved. If there was a safe corner of the world in which to sit down with Watson and untangle the past, it was not to be found in London.
"The affair was the least of your failings, man!" I rose to my feet, a restless temper seizing hold of me and demanding movement. "You did wrong, yes, as did she; but frankly, such dalliances are too commonplace to be shocking. Hurtful, certainly, but even there
When she spoke at last, it was of Holmes.
It was impossible. To have misunderstood Holmes for so many years

what was his name?
Our client's face paled, but she clasped her hands and simply said, "I am ready to do whatever you advise, Mr. Holmes."
"Marvelous," Holmes noted, well-satisfied. "I expect that will make the front page."
Her unusual stature, both broad and tall, contributed to the impression that here sailed a steamboat in a sea of dinghies.
The look of chagrin on his face momentarily alarmed me, but he shook his head wryly and waved me back to my chair. “This will be a long story, and you shall have the whole of it presently.” He leaned over to place his hand on mine, his expression a queer mixture of concern, solicitousness, and mortification. “But I’m afraid the most honest answer is: I had the help of your evil genius.”
I knew the lines of his face, the expressions of his eyes. I had charted his most mercurial moods through fair weather and foul. And even if all my years of living and working alongside him, of writing books devoted to him, had been insufficient to teach me to read him true
The paper almost fluttered loose from my hands. In the space of a breath, after years of indecision, new certainties came showering into my lap:
His hair was untidy for once; it had curled in the day's heat and moulded into odd shapes beneath his hat. Growing softer and finer with age, it had come over silver in a concerted rush last year. Even in the unromantic glare of the gas jet, it shone. Surfacing now and then from my agitation, I found my gaze resting there as helplessly as ever.
The snow had cleared considerably, and pale sunlight caught brightly at the icicles dripping from every cornice. I ushered him in. We retreated once more to my parlour, where
and presumably murdering Sherlock Holmes!
Moriarty blinked at me, clearly shaken, but with a fresh glint of both relief and respect in his eyes. "Thank you," he said quietly, and then, "Rest assured, I'm not simply trying to dodge my own guilt. I know I hurt Master Sherlock terribly, and the tragedy had a profound impact on the course of his life. I simply think it premature to declare it the Rosetta Stone to his character. I suspect Dr. Freud’s single-minded attention to our sad affairs has led him, and you, to overlook other matters of importance. Lord knows I am no intimate of Mr. Holmes; I have not really known him since he was a boy, and so I may be wrong. But surely you're aware that when a man has no eye for women, there is more than one possible explanation."
"Holmes, you
And he already knew.
Watson had bought a small upright piano for our parlour. Like many sister-less boys of our generation, both he and I had learned to play as children. Even then, I'd found the popular standards so trite and plodding that I'd never invested much in the instrument, graduating to the violin with great relief. But Watson had his sentimental favourites. His voice always exercised a certain witchcraft over me, never more than when raised in song. Yet for years, I had been reticent to tell him so.
His wife invited me to share their table, and afterwards we retired to his office for a private discussion. I told him, with all the sober conviction I could muster, that my friend Holmes, for the sake of a vitally important case, had committed himself to an undercover mission. The details were too confidential to explain, but the utmost secrecy about Holmes's whereabouts and activities must be preserved. To that end, I confided that my most recent story was a deliberate ruse designed to enable Holmes's temporary disappearance. We had turned to Professor Moriarty for help, as some years previously he had agreed to assist us in preparing for such an eventuality. Holmes, ever prescient about the sacrifices his profession might require, had taken the precaution of inventing a villainous alter ego in case the extreme step of shamming his own death should ever prove necessary. With Moriarty's permission, I was now putting those old rumours to good use.
you’d stopped playing da Vinci in the attic—"
After a tense pause, Moriarty stuttered, barely audible. "It was not … Not his first abuse, no."
We stood with our hands clasped warmly, quietly amazed at one other. The medical students nearby paid us no mind.
Nevertheless, the gaze he levelled in my direction was considering, not hostile. I did my best to return it in kind.
to him?"
That night, curled around him in bed with my nose in his hair, I whispered, "You have a grand gift of silence."
Mrs Cubitt looked at her for a long time, admirably calm. At length, she spoke gently, thanking Mrs Ronder for her confidence. She went on to repay it with one of her own. Watson had not yet published any account of the Dancing Men for the public, so Mrs Ronder learned of that tragedy for the first time from Mrs Cubitt's lips. Grief hovered in her voice as she spoke, poignant and long-settled.
She surprised a grand laugh out of Watson, who obliged with a marvelous re-telling of that strange and grotesque puzzle. His skills as a storyteller have been amply acknowledged by the reading public, but then, they've never known what they were missing. To laud his publications is to accept the shadow of his talent in place of its true substance. His words, marooned on the page without the nuance of his voice and gestures, lose half their power.
you have fled, with those children still in the house?"
“There’s a narrow peninsula beyond the coast; just a ribbon of sand, a few hundred meters offshore,” I told him. “It runs parallel to the mainland for miles. It’s a remarkable feeling, Watson, to stand on that narrow beach with calm inlets behind you and the endless sea ahead. I’ve seen something more of the world since we last parted, but I can’t recall another spot so steeped in
The whole farce came to a head a few days ago, when he sent my mother and me off to church, then plopped into a separate cab but disappeared himself before we got anywhere near an altar. Which saved me some trouble, I suppose, as I would have had to scupper the wedding if he hadn't done it first.
My God, I thought breathlessly. Did he not
So Mycroft and I worked out our own little systems. We learned to string together probabilities and hang deductions off of the details of clothing and the marks of wear on everyday objects. We discovered all the rich nuances of facial expression, so often overlooked by the Sighted, but just as capable of broadcasting thought and emotion as the mind itself. By the time we were school-aged, we could pass as possessing perfectly average Sight. By adulthood, we had so far elaborated and mastered our techniques that we were generally assumed to be telepathic savants. We never confirmed such claims, but never disputed them either.
“I’m experimenting with aniline derivatives. They’re a promising family of analgesics, though none have yet been discovered that are strong enough to serve as anesthetics. Perhaps I’ll be fortunate enough to make advances in that direction. If not, there is still much to be learned about the potential for milder pain relief in medicines like this.” I gestured at the white, clumpy silt sitting in my flask. “This particular derivative was first synthesised a little over fifteen years ago and is now on the cusp of entering into medical use. It’s called paracetamol.”
I stared at him, aghast. Seeing at last a reflection of his own panic in my face, he waved a hand in my direction as if to congratulate me for catching up.
I went home in a brown study, my mother attempting to comfort my broken heart all the way, and as soon as we turned in that night I started reviewing the evidence. In fact, I read over some of your stories to see if they might jog any ideas. After revisiting "The Naval Treaty," I asked myself whether the whole charade might simply have been an excuse to get me out of my room? Perhaps the wretch bundled me and Mam off to church so he could break in to retrieve some valuable hidden under the floor! Well, gentlemen, I pulled up the rugs and gave the deck a thorough dusting with the front of my nightgown, crawling along with my ear to the boards, tapping up and down and searching for hollow spaces half the night. But it was a bust as far as hidden compartments go. Nor did I uncover even one subterranean tunnel to any neighboring bank, more's the pity." Her eyes crinkled and a great boom of laughter pealed out. I joined in with her helplessly.
not to mention my own
He opened his mouth to object, but I cut him off. "If a hint of shame and a trace of suspicion dog your footsteps from now on, it is no more than justice
He came home that Christmas, quite calm and earnest, to tell our parents that he could never marry; he and his lad had resolved to be for each other. He felt it only right to tell Father, for Mycroft thought in the circumstances that the estate should go to me and volunteered himself for disinheritance, to that extent, for the good of the family. But I'm afraid he got rather more than he bargained for. At that age Mycroft was perfectly generous and sensible, but likewise perfectly naïve, for we had both been indulged all our lives. Our father had always been prodigiously proud of us, and we had no idea what he was capable of when that pride turned to shame.
At half past five I washed out my flasks, finished my notes, and meandered over to the Jardin des Plantes across the street. It had become my habit to read my letters in the little English garden tucked away on the far side of the park, beside the lotus pond.
The clock struck three and he began to make his excuses, thanking me and half-rising from his chair before wavering, half in and half out, then sinking back down with a frustrated sigh.
all of it flowed from my affair with his mother, and his father's violent reprisal. I must acknowledge this and accept my responsibility."
But I cannot believe that men are as simple as ciphers, susceptible to all-in-one decoding if only the secret key can be found. I told Dr. Freud that I found his theories suspect, and that I saw no reason to think a man's defining traits must spring from common, unresolved roots in the subconscious. He assured me that such was the case, and for proof he spoke to me of Sherlock Holmes. His vocation as a detective, his aversion to women, his cocaine addiction, and the way his obsession with me drove him to the brink of self-destruction
We dipped in and out of our scrapbooks all morning and into the afternoon. I was sitting on the floor skimming past pages full of superfluous naval lists when Watson reached for the 'C' tome, muttering about Sir James Crichton-Browne. I knew the name; he was a leading authority on the most modern psychological therapies and just the type of man to be able to refer us to a broad network of specialists. Watson thumbed through the volume in search of his quarry, only to come to a sudden halt with a low and formless exclamation. I caught his gaze and felt immediately that his search had taken an unexpected and promising turn.
I pressed on, just a little farther. “Professor Moriarty was with us for a year and a half. He never was the confrontational sort, and it's not as if he stood up to Father. But all the same, he was good to us. To Mycroft especially, I think he more closely resembled a friend than a teacher. My poor brother thought himself lucky in that, for he badly needed a sympathetic ear. There were only seven years' difference in their ages, and the distance between nineteen and twenty-six seemed much smaller, I'm sure, than the gap between the two of us brothers at twelve and nineteen.”
Once we arrived at the station, we hired a trap for the last leg of our journey to the manor. The shift in Mrs Ronder's manner was immediate and obvious. Previously attentive and engaged, if not garrulous, she withdrew into herself. The sudden downturn of her spirits did not alarm us. My own quicksilver temperament had accustomed both Watson and myself to expect black moods to oscillate, and it would have been of greater concern had Mrs Ronder felt the need to feign false cheer. As it was, her good humour on the train had most likely been genuine, and her anxiety as we neared our destination was perfectly natural.
Watson examined it with interest. “I’ve read about this. There was a German doctor, was there not, who published the first study of its effects only last year? If I recall correctly, he believed another, closely related derivative carried a lower risk of toxicity for his patients.”
"You exaggerate, sir. A modicum of notoriety attached to a name as common as yours will hardly ruin your life. The Moriarty of my story is dead, after all, which should discourage the general public from equating him with you."
he told me that, had he wished to start rumours along such lines, he could easily have done so years ago. I've begun to think better of him, but … why would he hoard such secrets if he means no harm? Does he … has he held back some proof for all these years; some trifle from your school days with which to make a nuisance?"
At ten to four Miss Sutherland and I found ourselves seated together again in anxious silence. At the chime of the hour Holmes swept back in and addressed himself immediately to business.
But in the back of my mind, oh, I did not forget where we were, or what liberties we might take with one another should his regard for me ever flower into desire. France was no Eden for lovers of our sort, not even in Paris. Discretion was usually expected and intolerance widespread. But the inclinations of our hearts would not subject us to arrest, nor the state of our sheets tempt the maids to blackmail. There had been no sodomy laws in France since the Revolution
Miss Sutherland called upon us a few weeks later. She was insistent on paying Holmes a reasonable fee for his services, but the greater favour she paid us was in confirming that her step-father had been summarily fired from his place of work and that her mother was suing for divorce. Given the popular furor over the case, she seemed likely to succeed in her suit.
'Please do bring her up to visit,' Mrs Cubitt invited. 'Would next Sunday suit?'
"Price-Jones. Give me his address. I will see him first thing in the morning, and I have from now till sunrise to think up an explanation that will satisfy him. He won't go to the police
Mrs Cubitt and Mrs Ronder sent us their best wishes for the Christmas season, and invited us to visit the manor in the new year for a charity benefit. They intended to raise funds for the poorhouse, and hoped we could attend. Their message concluded with expressions of heartfelt gratitude for having brought them together. 'You have done more for us than you know,' Mrs Cubitt wrote. Watson gave me a speaking glance, and we chuckled cheerfully.
and inexperienced at answering to a name not his own, such small, deliberate changes in appearance can serve as useful reminders. I had long since grown out a trim, neat beard for similar reasons, so neither of us looked quite ourselves.
"Speaking of decided geniuses," I frowned at the manic gleam that had sprung to his eye, "I suppose I ought to attend to my own." I caught him by the waist as he made a run for his abominable chemicals and, easing into a more complete embrace, I set about providing a salutary distraction before he could torch the house.
'I should very much like to accept their invitation,' he said, and I easily agreed.
I was momentarily incapable of reply, and Moriarty hurried on before I could gather myself to protest. "I have read your stories, you see. But whatever his inclinations may be, they are not the most important point I wanted to set before you. It's the cocaine and the patterns behind it that worry me. That is what I would beg you to re-examine.
The was a sharp crack of glass as Windibank's scotch went tumbling to the floor. He rose in high fluster. "A poor joke, sir! A poor joke, indeed. And what do you mean by it, anyhow?"
"Do you, really?" I cried, incensed to hear Moriarty again denying the damage he'd done to my friend. His hands flew to the armrests of his chair, and his whole expression seemed to flicker as he braced himself for my outrage. I took a sharp, deep breath. Then two, then three.
landed like an unexpected blow between my ribs. "What exactly should my mistakes have cost me, Dr. Watson?"
The lady was rather flamboyantly dressed, from the cheerful, diaphanous scarf trailing her like the tail of a kite to the long white feather that arched above her broad-brimmed hat with a panache de Bergerac would have applauded. She moved down the street with an almost bullish air—not aggressive, but certainly determined.
"That does not seem to me to fit very neatly into Dr. Freud's analysis," Moriarty persisted. "Why should his grief for the loss of his parents become suddenly unbearable twenty years after the fact? It's possible, of course; just as it’s possible that the addictive nature of the drug is in itself sufficient explanation for his sudden downfall. But before accepting either of those possibilities, it still seems necessary to ask whether some new grief might not have weighed on him.
Her face crumpled, and an awful hiccup of a sob caught in her throat. "But why?" she cried. "Is it…could it really have been about my measly hundred pounds? Could that pittance have been worth
Moriarty spent the night in my guest room, collapsing to bed at around three in the morning. Sleep was, for me, impossible, but I fortified myself with a surfeit of coffee. Just before five, I wrapped up in my warmest clothes and ventured out. I paid a king's ransom to secure the first cab I encountered for an arduously slow ride to West London, and knocked on the door of the headmaster's home just before breakfast. He was as surprised as I had been to receive a visitor in such weather, but my mind was instantly relieved by his complacent welcome. By the grace of God, he had not yet caught wind of "The Final Problem."
"Watson, please," he hushed me, pressing his hand over my mouth. I smiled against his palm. He shook his head; we never had learned how to stand too much sincerity from each other.
His hand tightened on mine, and he hid his face. The next moment, he was gone in a rush.
His hands stilled in my hair. I was not looking up at him, but felt it when he curled a little further over me—protective, though the threat had passed. The dimming light was too poor for close observation, but I could feel his gaze intense over my skin, my joints, the tendons of my hands, the rims of my nose and eyes. "You were not ill," he reassured himself. "But," his mind worked at the same breathtaking speed as ever, "your patient was exceptionally sensitive and could not shield their mind. And you had to expend all the concentration you could spare just to keep your own thoughts in, rather than blocking theirs out, because...Oh, Watson. You didn't want to drag them through your memories of Peshawar."
I sat still, in mute disbelief, as Moriarty took his leave. For a long stretch afterward, there was nothing on my mind but the sounds of the clock, the fire, and the creak of my own chair.
'I wish I were more equal to debating you!' Mrs Cubitt teased. 'But I'm afraid when I was growing up, my parents didn't exactly raise me on a diet of the classics. I just read whatever the other girls were reading, and most of it was rubbish, to be honest. Of course, my Hilton, and his family before him, built up a nice little library here at the manor. I've opened it up to the neighbourhood so anyone can come visit and read what they like. But I haven't often taken advantage of the collection myself, since spending too long with a book strains my eye and tends to tire me out.'
"Miss Sutherland, I will keep you no longer in suspense. I now have ample proofs in hand as to the identity of your false suitor. Earlier this morning I sent an inquiry after your step-father to his place of work. They replied that he is currently in France on business, but will be available to meet with me upon his return on the 15th. Here is the letter I received from them this afternoon, typed on their company machine." Holmes deposited the single sheet of paper on the coffee table before our client. Alongside it he placed one of Mr. Hosmer Angel's regimented love letters. Across both missives, Holmes had circled the letter "e" in red ink wherever it recurred.
Yet she had pulled through, and manifestly she had found a way forward. Surely she must bear the scars of her experience in both body and soul, but her resilience had been formidable. If I recalled correctly, she had taken on the management of her late husband's estate and had gone to notable lengths in support of the poor. Neither Watson nor I had ever met the lady, as she had been invalided throughout our investigation and at the time of Slaney's trial. I felt certain, however, that she would remember our names and our involvement in the case.
Looping my arm through that of the indistinguishable, sodden figure huddled on my stoop, I guided him quickly into the parlour and had taken his hat before I recognised the man. I must have given a sudden start, perhaps even an exclamation, for he straightened by halting degrees and pivoted to face me.
I joined my voice to his with a swell of hope for the years ahead.
We had dined, chosen our digestifs, and smoked through our pipes before a natural lull in the conversation deepened gradually to an expectant hush. We caught each other’s eyes.
Can you think of nothing else, no seminal event around that time that might have caused him distress? Distress enough to drive him to replace his diluted version of the drug with constant doses far more potent and obliterating?"
She beamed at him and ploughed on. "Well, he came over the next week when my step-father was out of town. My mother had nothing but encouragement for us, so we took our stroll together. He was in the same ridiculous get-up as before. In fact, he wore the same outfit at every one of our rendez-vous. I'm afraid it didn't occur to the poor coot that he should have changed his clothes once in a while if he didn't want me to notice he was in disguise. Anyhow, he proposed marriage before the end of our first outing and seemed to have no doubt I would accept. I can only assume that he took the same view of courting as Mr. Collins did in "Pride and Prejudice," and felt bolstered by the thought that no other offer of marriage might ever be made to me. It was an interesting development, but I still couldn't get a grasp on his motives. It's not worth a marriage swindle to bilk a girl of a measly hundred a year, so the proposal must be a screen for something bigger. But what? Well, sirs, I decided I was in for a penny, in for a pound, and agreed to marry the toad so I could await more sinister developments.
will get out, first to Scotland Yard and then to the papers, and the scandal will sink us all together!"
to me. For in his eyes, very little between us had changed.
As contemptible as I found him, the sight of his despair surprised a prickle of guilt from me, irrepressible. It had been nearly three years since I'd seen him in person, and it had been easy to forget how helpless he could seem. As I'd written my story, the Moriarty of Holmes's nightmares had become almost real to me.
I shook my head.
not a need
"Nothing I did is actionable in the slightest!" he shouted.
Those records he considered most private and precious went into the battered tin dispatch box locked away at Cox & Company. The rest he transferred, bit by bit, to our new home in the country. I began slowly to wind down my business in London, preparing for a bittersweet departure. I had been accustomed to consider my work as my greatest prize, and though I was prepared to exchange it for the sake of one greater, it nonetheless merited a long goodbye.
"I'm sure," I sighed.
Mr. Windibank, his scandalous cruelties, and his ignominious defeat at the hands of his wronged step-daughter—rising up like Truth From Her Well to Shame Mankind, as the caption read—had a good run in the London newspapers. The photographer had been careful with the composition of the shot that went to print. Of Miss Sutherland, only her strong right arm and the back of her bonnet were visible, whereas Mr. Windibank's petrified face and defensive lunge were admirably clear and dramatically framed.
He sent her an outrageous wink, and I cuffed the back of his head while she laughed and sank back into her seat. For a moment we stared at each other, slightly at sea in this conspiratorial fellowship that had broken upon us so suddenly, but Holmes soon retrieved the dropped reins of conversation. "Now, my dear lady," he said, "I fear I interrupted you just as you were on the verge of detecting your criminal. I'm most anxious to hear the full story, pray continue."
He shifted, rubbing at his mouth. "Our second summer proved less harmonious, in large part because I lost confidence in his methods. He asked me to submit to hypnosis, to recount my dreams, to regurgitate as many meandering thoughts as possible, and his lines of questioning varied from nonsensical to puerile. For several weeks I was mystified as to what he hoped to achieve with all that fuss. Gradually, I began to see that he was searching for some malformation in my subconscious that would explain my choices, my desires and mistakes.
And so we fell into our old push-pull, both a little wearier than before, but I daresay a little kinder, too. He saw through me as clearly as ever and consequently asked no questions about the case that had kept me away. Not yet.
I nodded, unsurprised he'd read it all from me so easily. It was typhoid, not cholera, that had felled me in India, but the symptoms were so similar that experience of the one drudged up the trauma of the other. In such cases I could usually get by, focusing on my duty as a doctor, but this poor boy had been an Eight and too young to have developed any real control. In all my years of practice, I'd never been so loudly and brutally immersed into someone else's experience of desperate illness.
It was. Holmes was a chemist, after all, and when he’d started his habit, seven per-cent had been a dosage widely deemed medicinal. Cocaine had come into fashion as a miracle drug and was put to every purpose under the sun, but at its inception, it was supposed to numb pain.
I pressed my mind to his, recklessly open as I let my shields loose. With him, I could give way even so far; we were safe together in the hushed dark.
“Not a rebuttal,” I said, “if one works joyfully.”
The flush that had been building in the blackguard's cheeks drained abruptly to chalk, and he dropped back in his chair with a helpless gurgle. Holmes and I framed him carefully to the left and right, our eyes blazing fire and the line from his chair to the closed door of the landing perfectly clear.
Miss Sutherland lifted her head, eyes sharp as flint. "Tell me," she said.
His 'shielding' had seemed all the more impressive and unsettling because he'd been so emotional on the surface. Absolutely eccentric, overflowing with wild humour and childish petulance and a bone-deep affection for me in which I was terribly tempted to put my faith. But no matter how long I knew him or how close we became, he was never unguarded in my presence. I never felt his shields go down, and never gleaned the slightest response when I lowered mine for him. It had confused me. For many years, I'd thought him incapable of the softer emotions—his cat and mouse encounters with Irene had been, I assumed, the extent of his interest in matters of the heart. I'd put away my own more tender sentiments, believing them unwanted, and moved on.

My eyes were dry, but I've always been one of those regrettable types whose distress shades more nervous than melancholy. As soon as our hansom arrived, I swept up the steps to our rooms. While evening set in, I paced and smoked and acted the restless nuisance. Watson left me to it, too well-versed in my tempers to chide.
rather nonplussed
In the brief hush that followed, I met his eyes. There was an unguardedness there, at once uncertain and bold and as rare as it was lovely. Something of my heartfelt admiration must have shone in my face, for his shoulders rose on a sudden, sharp intake of breath. I'd never known him to confess so openly to his Blindness. Indeed, before today I was aware of no one, apart from Irene and myself, in whom he'd confided. Moriarty had deduced it, damn his soul to hell; and as for Mycroft, they'd lived in the dark together all their lives. But to see him calmly owning this truth to a stranger—it felt momentous.
"Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms," he said with studied nonchalance. "I descend from the Vernets, you know, painters who led their field for four generations. I've sometimes speculated that where exceptional visual acuity runs in families, perhaps it may have developed to compensate for weak Sight?
She spoke with a relish that surprised me. Normally our clients weren't, in fact, exhilarated to tangle with a baffling crime. My glance darted to Holmes, and the pleased tilt at the corner of his mouth told me he'd recognised a kindred spirit. "You're fond of mysteries, then?"
I know nothing of her marriage apart from how brutally it ended, but I doubt that any husband resorts to such horrific violence as his
By then it was too late to speak, nor would I have been so disloyal as to intrude upon him or his wife with my own troubles. It was impossible to resent Mrs. Watson once I really knew her, or to blame Watson for following his heart. But as for me, I was wretched, not only at his loss, but at his perfect ignorance of
He returned to stand before me with
Instead, our eyes caught and he commenced peacocking with all his usual subtlety. He angled his wrist just so, and the firelight sparked across a gargantuan, finely-cut diamond set in a thick gold ring that had not adorned his hand when last I held it.
"You don't like weaklings," he observed, quite matter-of-fact. "At school I imagine you stood up against bullies for the sake of your friends or in defense of most younger lads. But not if you didn't like them. Not if they were whiners, always putting on airs. You scrubbed their faces in the dirt yourself, most likely, and came away feeling you'd done them a favour: someone had to teach them not to be prigs. I've seen your sort in the schoolyard a hundred times."
Holmes glanced at me, bright-eyed, and observed, "Oscillation on the pavement is usually the mark of a love affair gone wrong, but from this vigorous young lady I think we may hope for stranger things."
, now that I think of it.”
Watson said, "When Moriarty brought up the question of inversion, my first thought was that he was a blackmailer. And I remember now
Moriarty stared hard at me for a long moment. Then he raised a finger, rose, and walked to my bookshelf, where my own novels held pride of place. "I know because you wrote it down, Dr. Watson. Right here."
For once in my life, I did not fight to keep my heart from rising to my eyes.
I'd told myself I should hold to my routines, try to keep the ground steady beneath my feet while this new intimacy between us was still in such early bloom. But maybe, underneath it all, there lay a simpler ache. Having spent so long in waiting, perhaps it soothed something in me to be waited for.
and could be neglected without too heavy a cost. It took his marriage to teach me otherwise.
Mrs Cubitt stared at her in astonishment, taken aback both by her dramatic declaration and by the sudden shift the evening's mood had taken, but Mrs Ronder pressed on. 'My husband hurt me. He was full of rage and jealousy; he used to lash a whip across my back. He was a coward, a bully, and a beast, and I conspired with my lover to kill him. I have suffered for it, more than I thought anyone could suffer, short of hell. But I cannot say I truly repent, even now. I could not have borne another day, another night, as his wife. And he would never have let me go. But you are a good woman, and I can see that you loved your husband dearly. Perhaps you would rather not have to do with me.'
, sir, as you well know. We took your friend all the way to Vienna to cure him of this delusion, and I thought we had succeeded? Yet now I find he has passed it on to you, and you have spread it about all of London and soon enough far beyond that!" He cradled his head in his hands, rocking violently in his chair. "God help me, there'll be no end of it. It can't…it
"You chill me to the bone," he said. "The most commonplace fiends are the most undetectable, and against drab horrors few rally to fight. I am convinced that, could we but join hands and fly off of the roof together—"
I shook my head. He was not wrong this time; I could see it in his eyes.
. It was this work that lately kept him more often in Sussex than in Baker Street, humming with energy and ankle deep in loose leaf manuscripts, emerging from his study to make arrangements for the furnishings and grounds, and preparing the place to suit us both. Meanwhile I lingered in the midst of my dwindling practice, nerving myself to cut the cord.
When she reached the housefront directly opposite our own she made a sudden stop, and though her hat hid the face beneath from view, it seemed to me she was staring at the lamppost bearing our address. For the first time, she wavered, pacing slightly back and forth in an excess of energy before plunging across the muddy street and clanging our front bell.
I barked a laugh. Of all the brazen, damnable cheek.
His chin tilted up and slightly sideways. Its angle
and little enough justice at that. Furthermore, let us be clear: this is not about your affair with Mrs. Holmes."
“Indeed?”
"Dr. Watson," said he in his wavering voice, "I had not taken you for such a villain."
Hopeless.
Madame Brémont’s light fare suited me rather better than the hearty Scottish breakfasts of Baker Street, but the friendly sight of Watson’s looping script beside my plate touched off a pang of homesickness sufficient to rattle my appetite. I tucked a heel of fresh bread into my trouser pocket and slipped the letter into my waistcoat. I’d have had time to read it before walking to the lab, but his correspondence was a pleasure I preferred to savour.
I blinked, struck dumb for a moment at his flash of resemblance to my absent friend.
She shook her head and patted tentatively at her hat as if the thoughts within might be smoothed back like errant hairpins. But after a moment she gathered herself and resumed the tale. "Well, sirs, I was at the gas-fitters' ball, just larking a bit with my gals, when the most bizarre young fellow made a beeline for me. He hadn't time for anyone else all night, despite not knowing me from Adam. I know my clothes stand out a bit. I do that on purpose because it's so easy otherwise to fade into the background. They forget you're there, don't they, without a Yankee Doodle cap to wave and catch their eye?" She curled the tip of her hat's white feather around her finger. Holmes smiled at the surprised glance I sent in his direction; I'd never once considered his eccentric dress might be strategic. "But I didn't think my outfit could really explain why I was the only girl in the whole room to stand out to him.
"Well, gentlemen," she said brightly, "my name is Miss Mary Sutherland, and I'm over the moon to find you both at home. I shan't bother you with trivia outside of business except to say that I've read Dr. Watson's accounts and they've meant a good deal to me." She bowed her head in my direction, her expression good-humoured but with an odd seriousness about her eyes. Then she turned her full attention to my companion, who was no doubt reading untold revelations in her bootlaces.
"On the contrary," Holmes said calmly. "I have caught up with him, even as we speak."
I devoted my attention to phenacetin, emerging from the processes of synthesis only long enough to congratulate young Frères on the progress of his thesis. The bells of the Cathédral Saint-Pierre punctuated the day, and every so often, when I moved the right way, Watson’s note crinkled in my pocket with a soft, cheering sound.
about it?
"I am, Mr. Holmes," she said. "To you I'm sure it sounds naïve, but the art of detection appeals to me. With my Sight so poor, I've always been drawn to the type of questions better solved by logic than telepathy. It's why I took to maths, and why I take to puzzles. And though you'll be surprised to hear it, the lines of reasoning you've worked out and that Dr. Watson has made famous—they happen to be really useful to those of us who cannot See, and therefore must
"Have you become engaged in my absence, then?" A new stain blotted the arm of my chair. I picked at it, then reached for the evening edition. It was stuffed in the beak of the taxidermied pelican Holmes had, for unfathomable reasons, set up in place of an end-table.
I nearly ran into the maid on my way down the stairs, and seeing that I was carrying a jar crooked in each arm, she kindly offered to fetch me a basket. Thus fortified, I arrived at the university with my acetate of potassium no worse for wear. With my work table facing east, the glare through the windows made most mornings something of a trial. Even after nine months in Montpellier, the Mediterranean sun still surprised me with its intensity.
If Watson's eyes spilled over once or twice before we reached home, he had good excuse.
My thoughts spun contentedly. His heartbeat thrummed next to mine, quiet and close.
Moriarty waved his hands preemptively. "I mean to make him no trouble, I assure you! Were I so unsavory a sort, I'd have had ample opportunity to spread that sort of rumour years ago. You must see that I've always gone out of my way to avoid embarrassing the Holmeses, and I don't intend any indiscretion now.” He blinked rapidly, taken aback by my visible alarm. “And as I say, I know nothing for certain. But you are his dearest friend and have been not only a doctor but an army officer. Surely you've seen enough of the world that inversion can't, as a mere possibility, shock you?"
I felt his soundless laugh shaking through his chest, warm against me. "It's the hush that falls in a concert hall before the first note plays," I said. "Or wind on the Afghan plains, wide open. Nothing empty or blank—there's no
"Now, sir," Windibank said in his light, conciliatory voice as he settled in his armchair. "I understand that my step-daughter has lodged an inquiry with you about this bounder who abandoned her at the altar. She won't hear a word against him, I know, and insists that his disappearance was all very mysterious. But surely here we are all men of the world. There can be no doubt that this was simply a dalliance, and that the lad toyed with her until his game could run no farther. So I ask you, what is there for you to investigate, or for us to discuss? I must say I think it in rather poor taste for you to accept a fee from that misguided girl, when you know as well as I do that you will never catch up with this Angel character."
Moriarty lifted his hands to me, open-palmed, in wretched confusion. "Then why
to both of us
. 'Now that I have the opportunity so many of your readers have surely longed for, Doctor Watson,' she said, 'I really must demand an explanation of the "dreadful Abernetty business" and how exactly it hinged on the depth to which the parsley sank into the butter.'
“in possibility, I suppose.”
I caught my breath at once, seized by the possibilities. What woman could have a better hope of understanding Mrs Ronder, and being understood in turn? It had been more than ten years since the terrible tragedy at Ridling Thorpe Manor. Mrs Cubitt had made a full recovery, which Watson informed me amounted to a miracle. The bullet she had fired into her own head in a frenzy of despair had traversed both hemispheres of her brain, a circumstance which had sharply increased the odds of brain damage. More dangerous still, the bullet had remained lodged there, requiring the most delicate surgery to remove. Her odds of survival had been low, and the likelihood that her mind and personality would remain recognizably her own had been lower still.
"Forgive me," I said nonetheless, gritting my teeth. I had refused to hear the professor out before, to my cost, and the mistake was too fresh to repeat lightly. "Pray go on. Let me hear your reasons."
I survived, deeply grateful for the second chance that the love of my friends and the intervention of Dr. Freud had given me. But I was puzzled as to what to do with this life that had been pulled back from the brink.
Deliberately unmethodical, most likely for the simple pleasure of winding me up, he had plucked out 'G,' 'L,' and 'S' to start with and made industrious notes whilst I demolished my eggs. Occasionally he would pause as some particular person came to mind whose advice or assistance might prove useful, and he would switch volumes to look them up before he lost the thread. Such an approach left a great deal to chance, but this was not, after all, a case in which efficiency seemed much more likely to succeed than serendipity.
Watson had the bad habit of telling his stories backwards, but I might finally have outdone him. For years the most constant, incontrovertible thought in my head had been: I cannot go back to him until I sort myself out. But my weeks and months in France had finally worked a slow transposition, such that nowadays I was as often convinced: I cannot sort myself out until I go back to him.
The occasion doubtless called for eloquence, but I had none. I simply said, “My dear Watson, I thought I had a secret to tell you. But you already know it, do you not?”
On returning home, I found Moriarty sequestered in a chilly corner of my consulting room, hunched over an old copy of
not, decide alone. Watson deserved a say in it, and in order to grant him one, I would first have to lay myself open.
. I should say it’s meant to be.”
A warm shiver shifted his thigh under my cheek.
Miss Sutherland had no need to hear of our old griefs; what she did need and deserve was honest reassurance. She must be trying to imagine a more hopeful future for herself after this ordeal, and perhaps I could help in some small way. "Having known the truth of the matter for some years now," I said, "I believe I can offer a little perspective which you may find valuable. You strike me as a young woman who may very well be happy in independent life. But if ever you desire companionship, never doubt that you have tremendous gifts to bring to any friend or sweetheart, whether Sighted or un-Sighted. When it comes to voicing your feelings, believe me when I say that you and your chosen friend will have an advantage over couples who over-rely on shared Sight to do their loving and their arguing for them. And when facing hardship, remember that you can comfort a friend without absorbing their pain, just as you yourself can work through your griefs without inflicting them directly on those around you. I cannot tell you what a gift that is. It would be different if, in Seeing a loved one's pain, we could lighten their burden—but the wretched truth is that suffering echoed between minds is doubled, not halved. You have it in you to break that cycle, both for yourself and others.
By the time we stumbled up to our bedrooms we were exhausted in every conceivable sense, and yet we lingered in the corridor together, unwilling to let the night end on such a melancholy note.
"Anything of interest in the paper?"
He made no answer, nor did I expect him to.
It was a fair point. 'We must be careful not to presume too far, you're right. All we can do is write to her and ask.'
"Ah, Watson," said he, casting an arch look over his shoulder as he crossed to the window. The streetlamp below cast him in silhouette. "How kind of you to visit."
was one I need not, and
“Safe, effective pain relief is the Holy Grail of my profession,” he agreed. “I’m very pleased to hear that you consider these medicines so promising.”
"What concerns me more is your readiness to lie like a dog rather than concede the most trivial argument."
Watson set the letters side by side on the mantel, hope sharp in his eyes.
Late one evening, very shortly after I released my account of "The Final Problem" to the public, Professor Moriarty came to call.
Professor Moriarty stared up at me. Anguish twisted harshly across his face, but at the same time a curious calmness seemed to overtake him. I had expected another cringing protest, but though his shoulders shook and a few tears ran, his gaze rose with new stubbornness to meet mine. I emerged from my temper far enough to regain the palpable sense that I was facing another man, neither scarecrow nor fiend.
The gentle pride in her voice was unmistakable, and I couldn't help but catch my breath to think what such a speech would mean to Holmes. My heart fluttered for him in great delight and no little concern. I lowered my eyes and covered my true reaction with a mild, approving smile.
“You are perfectly correct,” I said. “But my own preliminary research points in the opposite direction. Much more work will need to be done before any reliable safety pronouncements can be made. But I have great hopes for this drug.”
"Oh no," I said, trusting her to read my absolute sincerity. "No, not at all. That passage was…it was a mistake. More than a mistake, it was a
Such was the clay that built the bricks of my addiction. I followed that well-paved road very nearly to hell.
"Price-Jones."
Miss Mary Sutherland held the fragile volume in her lap and stared down at my old tally, onto which Holmes had tacked the brief addendum: 'Psionic sensitivity - Nil.'
that might have prompted such a change. And even if something disturbing had occurred, I don’t see how you could have come to know about it."
Holmes had anticipated our outrage—and I had no doubt he shared it—but he raised a warning hand. "We must be careful and canny if we hope to best this villain. Though his attempted ruse was not skillfully executed, I'm afraid it was more skillfully conceived. The plain, terrible fact of the matter is that he has broken no law, and legally we cannot touch him. I've spent the afternoon considering how to wreak justice on the wretch, and I believe I can see a solution. It has certain in-built costs, but I would like to propose it for your consideration, Miss Sutherland. I've already discussed the prospect with your mother, and she asked me to tell you that she loves you and will leave it all in your hands to decide."
In an instant she had snatched up the whip and swung it with a sound like summer lightning. A second camera flash erupted, casting the two of them in long shadow: Miss Sutherland towering and Windibank cowering before her, his arm raised over his head as he threw himself to one side. The first blow landed with a whistle and thud, and then the second. With a scream he pelted down the stairs, and she chased him out the front door.
"—we would spy in the ordinary houses of this city such numberless, idiosyncratic cruelties that your novelist's pen would run dry. Depend upon it, Watson: take five and a half million people and stack them atop each other for seven hundred square miles, and the results will defy imagination."
When the crisis passed I went home, but slept poorly. My nightmares were insistent enough to seep right to the border of my neighbours' dreams.
"Hmm. I can't say I recall who currently rules in the Low Country. Is it their king or queen who's won your hand?"
They reached for one another, coming to rest in a gentle sway, half-embraced. They murmured quiet comforts back and forth. Neither Watson nor I could remain unmoved at such a sight. Feeling urgently that they deserved their privacy, we gathered ourselves and unobtrusively withdrew.
In recent months, there’d been a shift in the tone of Watson’s correspondence. Nothing overt or easily defined, but now and then I was brought up short when a tinge of hesitance or a flair of ardency cropped up in uncharacteristic places. I had a more confident grasp on Watson’s voice than on that of any other man, and had only grown more attuned to it during my years of travel. His letters had kept me company through many long journeys. The changes in the tenor of his words, even changes as delicate as these, stirred up cautious hopes in me.
"I have spent some time, these last two summers, with Dr. Freud," he began. I made some slight exclamation at this wholly unexpected news, but Moriarty barely paused. "In helping Mr. Holmes, he’d come to learn of the tragedy, and he reached out to me. He guessed, correctly, that I'd never been able to talk it over with anyone, and he volunteered to support me should I choose to face up to the past.
I could not have explained my misery to him, and so, perforce, I hid it, along with the increasingly potent means by which I sought relief. He and I had drifted apart, even as self-loathing spindled itself through my heart’s old fault lines. Ever since I lost my parents, I’d had a visceral revulsion toward the thought of adultery, and to find myself in love with a married man was appalling. Illicit desire had unearthed in me a distressing resemblance to my old tutor that I could not root out.
We crossed the room from light to light, dousing the table lamps and turning off the gas. Hands joined in the familiar dark, we trailed upstairs to bed. Sufficient to the day is its own evil; tomorrow we would grapple with the rest.
He rummaged about in the warren of old magazines, dried glue, and empty ink bottles overflowing from his scrapbook bin and emerged after a moment with a battered copy of
or at any time since I've known him, for that matter
It was five minutes before his quick steps crossed from the atrium into the lab. I rose, and we shook hands, the both of us brimming with suppressed excitement. He was clean shaven
Mrs Ronder nonetheless persisted, and soon discovered a few favourites that Mrs Cubitt did share with her. Watson was able gradually to bow out of the conversation and leave the ladies to debate the relative appeal of different fictional romances. He and I moved to share the settee and smoked a cigarette or two together. Mrs Cubitt surprised us by following our lead and lighting a pipe in the midst of her disquisition on
"Granted, then, the collapse of their union was more his doing than either of yours."
"Oh, I don't," Holmes said. "I'm only glad to hear we all agree on the principles currently at stake."
A groundswell of tenderness overtook us both. I pressed his hands and stepped away before doing something foolish. I’d just promised him a slow courtship; it wouldn’t do to steal a kiss.
The next day an evil little bottle smelling lightly of almonds and glinting blue beneath its poison label arrived in the post for us, as did Mrs Cubitt's reply.
"Oh, this trinket? Merely a token of appreciation from the Dutch royals. They called upon me not long ago—or rather, their representative did—in regard to a delicate problem."
Two weeks later he reappeared on my doorstep like the proverbial bad penny.
"I despise you for running for your life, for leaving a helpless woman
I gather that, from university to middle age, Mr. Holmes remained a low-dosage addict. The loss of his parents may well have started him down that path, just as Dr. Freud believes, and his anger at me clearly wove itself into the practice upon some level, to have erupted the way it did later. But my point is simply that his habits, though unhealthy, remained fairly regular. You documented them in your novel: after fifteen years, he was still diluting his dosages down to a seven per-cent solution. Is that correct?”
He was shaking badly, though whether more from cold or fury I could not say. He was a slight creature, Mr. Moriarty, and being now well north of fifty, seemed to feel the night's chill down to his bones. His bald head was at a level with my shoulder and the wind had chafed it red from pate to chin, his spectacles half frosted over. His coat hung shapelessly about him, its dusting of snowmelt beginning to drip on the floor. He wore a look of wounded outrage, and my hackles rose in answer.
'I send you my temptation. I will follow your advice,' Mrs Ronder had written.
when Holmes beckoned me to join him. Looking over his shoulder, I saw at once the oddity who'd caught his eye.
your lover!
"Not at all. No, the professor knows nothing for certain of my own inclinations; I was only a child when he knew me. It was Mycroft's history in that regard, not mine, that he was privy to."
The good lady sat speechless for a long moment. Her face, wiped temporarily blank with astonishment, reanimated slowly as her eyes worked back and forth. I could see her thinking back on the stories of mine she'd so admired, sifting through them in this new light. "Good Lord," she muttered. She stood abruptly, hand curled around the frame of the chaise, and gave a strange, endearing little bow. "Why, Mr. Holmes…I can't say I've ever been paid a better compliment. I don't know what to say, except…except,
I had seen his soul bared in the most desperate, deplorable extremity. I had stayed with him through the worst ordeal, when the torment of weaning his body from its addiction had stripped away his last semblance of self-control. He had raved and screamed, sobbed and begged. He had been incapable of hiding anything in that state, yet never had he said a word to me that might be construed in such a way.
Moriarty clasped his hands together in a combination of skepticism, nerves, and concern. "I'm not so sure that's true, Dr. Watson. In fact, I doubt it very sincerely."
From that point on, he tried his best to break out the thumbscrews. He typed up a load of insipid love letters that he delivered three days a week on a regular schedule." She pulled out a sampling from her purse, and Holmes began to skim through them with keen attention. "Mother always welcomed him at the house, and one night, he asked me to swear on the Bible to be true to him no matter what unforeseen dangers might part us. 'Right then,' I thought, 'he's fixing to do a runner, the heartless blot.' But I still couldn't see what he was after in the first place? Anyhow, I told him kindly that I was sure he couldn't want any better oaths from me than the ones I would save for the altar. He became quite insistent on the point, until I was obliged to quote scripture and verse at him. 'Our Lord says we mustn't swear by heaven, you know, or by anything at all,' says I. 'He prefers that we stand by whatever we say, yea or nay, and that's that. If we can't, we've already fallen in with the Father of Lies, do you see? It's all there in Matthew, chapter five.'" She snorted. "Well, he blinked behind those tinctured glasses for a minute or two, scrabbling for an argument, but in the end he gave over with barely a peep. These snake-charmers haven't any idea how to deal with a whiff of Sunday school, and I must say that comes in handy.
Watson wrote,
And of course, in a way, he was real: for, however pathetic a figure he cut, this man had long since proved himself the opposite of harmless.
"Please keep in touch, if you can, Miss Sutherland," I added. "We would be very glad to know how you get on."
"All month it's been the only thing that doesn't hurt to think about," she said softly, "so I've thought my fill. I ought to change my name, you know—there's only so much pity one can stand, isn’t there? I've had enough of headlines. I'd like to move to some quiet neighborhood, maybe offer lessons to young ladies who want to learn type-writing. Mam can stay with me a while, or with her sister if she likes. Perhaps once we get going, there'll be enough interest to open up a school or some little business." She took a deep, slow breath. "I think what's best is to learn to do for myself, really. And maybe help a few girls who're looking for a chance to make their own way."
Though we would never be friends, I didn't relish the thought of any man fearing me or my temper. I tried to set him at ease. He answered my efforts with his own, and we made determined civilities. I heard about his students. He heard about my patients. The quarter hour passed into the half, and then a quarter to. Throughout our stilted conversation, I watched him silently debate whether to say to me whatever it was he'd come to say. More than once he looked searchingly into my face, his expression overtaken by some unspoken thought. I stifled both my impatience and my curiosity, having resolved not to press him.
“We were in profound disarray. Mycroft was distraught, though very quietly so. Broken-hearted, not only at the loss of his beau, but also because he saw clearly that our father's love for him had died. I was too young to understand that a parent could change so completely, and I kept waiting for it to blow over and for the life I'd always known to resume. But Father never looked at Mycroft the same way again.
She took a seat upon on the chaise longue and leaned forward, her manner straightforward and eager. "I'm a plumber's daughter, Mr. Holmes, and proud to say it. Most puffed up cods who've left the trades—the sort who like to flash their gab and brag of the prodigious heights of clerking—they laugh at me when I tell them Papa was a great man, but it's the truth. He was an honest, charitable, diligent fellow who knew that good pipes and clear drains save more lives than the finest doctors, and he weren't ashamed to do the grub work.
“Then let me court you.” I twined my fingers through his. “We need not rush. We need not change very much at all. We shall have an understanding, that’s all, and see what comes of it.”
Before he could vanish out the door, I stopped him with a light touch to his wrist and stole a kiss. He blinked up at me, seemingly caught by some nameless expression he could not quite interpret. He muttered, "What was that for?"
I was pledged. Whatever answer he made me, his acknowledgment alone was a gift I had once despaired of; I would not underrate its worth.
Watson laid his hand on my shoulder, and we held the letter between us a moment longer, touched with admiration and gratitude. Then, as I folded the note carefully away, he sat down at the keys and began to play one of those songs that we had made our own.
"Not at all," I answered. He flitted his cup quickly back to its saucer to cover the slight flinch he couldn't repress
Though incomplete, this fragmentary correspondence may be considered of interest for showcasing a somewhat uncommon side of Freud's therapeutic practice. Freud specialized in working with patients who were exhibiting notable psychosomatic symptoms or neuroses which he believed were caused by hidden traumas in their past. He was interested in repressed memories and unconscious wounds. In this case, there is no indication that the patient was exhibiting such symptoms, and the 'tragedy' referred to was one of which both Freud and his patient were consciously aware. One of his biographers has speculated that Freud had some personal motivation for offering his services in this instance, though no scholar has so far ventured to guess the identity of his correspondent.
, puffing away affably; but on reflection, I might have predicted it. Scent is, to human memory, the surest tinder. Apart from the house itself, her husband's tobacco must have been among the strongest of the evocations of him within which she lived and breathed. I hoped sincerely that she had reached for it over the years as a comfort rather than a penance.
I called for tea.
His mouth quirked. 'Likewise.'
Even for a gentleman with every possible advantage—honour behind me, love before me, and wealth to comfortably sustain—it was a hard thing to take the first step into a new life. Our client today had made her way through bleak varieties of pain: brutalized by her husband, left to die by her lover, and shunned by a society that had no use for a woman once her beauty became disfigured. She had wanted the truth of her suffering, and even of her guilt, to be remembered; but by God, what use was it to stand witness to such misery if there was nothing to be
Watson arrived on a bright afternoon in the middle of May. After crossing the Channel to Calais he’d managed to catch an earlier train than planned, and so two hours before I expected him, a whiff of Bradley’s tobacco wafted through my open window at the lab. I looked up to see him standing just outside, cigarette in hand, one elbow propped on the mullion and a slender crown of cloudless sky framing his face.
I lowered my eyes quickly, lest Watson catch the direction my thoughts were straying. It would be for him to decide if and how we might touch, and that was not a conversation for tonight.
Anyhow, the rat gave his name as 'Mr. Hosmer Angel,' which shows you straight off that he probably weren't the criminal of the century. As aliases go, I'd call it bald. He was wearing tinted glasses to hide his eyes, despite it being nine of an evening in a low-lit hall. His felt was brand new, still had the bit of string clinging to the brim where the price tag had been attached. He tried to talk to me in a whisper-y voice, but the ball was so loud that in order to make himself heard he got closer to whisper-shouting, which put the lie to his story about a weak throat. But what most interested me was that he'd pasted on a costume beard. He'd made a creditable go of it, and most Sighted people probably wouldn't have noticed, especially in such dim light. But I'm sure you know how great a difference facial expression makes in helping to follow the thoughts and moods you can't See otherwise, so I always tend to look closer than people expect. And I could see the dried patches of glue all along the hairline.
Mr. James Windibank slithered his way to our front bell on the evening of the 15th, as expected. He handed his shiny top-hat to the maid at the door, and the housekeeper showed him up the stairs to our sitting room. Holmes and I were both ready to greet him, and I poured him two fingers of scotch which he gladly accepted.
We made our farewells with sincerest best wishes on all sides. In early September, we received this brief note from the lady:
"That afternoon I had to spend waiting for him to finish his investigation, knowing something was terribly wrong but not yet seeing what it was. Do you know what I did to keep my mind from running in constant circles?"
And that is why Mother never looked at Father the same way again, either. On some level, we all sensed it: Mycroft, Professor Moriarty, and me. Even Father sensed it, although he couldn't face it, and his anger toward Mycroft escalated almost to hatred. In some deeply buried part of his mind, reserved perhaps for the likes of our Dr. Freud, I believe Father felt that his son had stolen his wife away from him. At all events, he was horrid to Mycroft, and the further down that path he traveled, the more estranged Mother became.” My voice broke, and I ran a hand across my face. I had never understood why Mother had always been the hardest to talk about.
With a blooming bruise of heartache, I began to see with new eyes.
in you." He turned abruptly in my arms until we held each other face to face, the bedclothes tangling between us. I could not believe I'd been so blind; the irony did not escape me. How had I managed over the years to praise every last aspect of his mind, except for this one? I brushed my fingertips down the curve of his temple. "I love the touch of your mind. It makes for a vital, resonant sort of quiet, because I know who lives inside it."
The past is a wound that has harried me once or twice in daylight, twice or thrice in sleep," he said. "I've felt its sting here and there, you see. It is, perhaps, no coincidence that I sit before you unmarried and childless. No coincidence, perhaps, that I'm stamped with an anxious humour, too quick to appease
"My God, Mary," he stuttered, quaking too hard to make any attempt at escape.
Mrs Ronder rose in a burst of sympathy, moving across the room toward her. Mrs Cubitt stood likewise, wiping at her cheek. 'There's blood in the past that'll never wash out. But we're still alive, and what we choose to do matters. You're not a danger to anyone, are you? Anyone except yourself. I can understand that, believe me.'
"Neither, my dear, as the Queen is a child and her father would have been eighty-four last winter were he not ten years dead. Against such stiff competition, you've so far prevailed."
He gaped at me.
I joined my efforts to his, though with the unavoidable sense that we were searching for a needle in a haystack. I hardly knew what to look for: a nurse, a benefactor, an employer, a companion? How might Mrs Ronder be lured into breaking the monotony of reclusion, and what could give her some relief, raise her spirits, or excite her interest? It seemed the height of arrogance to pretend that two strangers, however well-intentioned, could find any simple balm to the layers of injury she bore. Yet there was nothing to do but try.
'Do you suppose we might introduce them?' Watson asked. 'Such a friendship could do Mrs Ronder much good, don't you think?' He frowned then, biting at his lip. 'But, of course, Mrs Cubitt might find it difficult to be in touch with a lady still struggling with self-destructive impulses. There's no telling how hard it's been for her to put her own behind her.'
He weren't ashamed of me, either, even though I wouldn't have blamed him if he'd been disappointed his only child was a daughter, and rated a One at that. Once I was old enough to be tested and they ranked my Sight so low, my Mam went through it—she thought no decent lad or lass would ever take me for a proper wife and couldn't think what should become of me. But Papa always said so long as a lady kept her health and her wits about her, she'd do fine. He gave me a shot at keeping the books for the shop once my maths were up to scratch, and badgered me to train some skill for my hands. I sewed a load of rotten shirts before moving on to typing, which suited much better.
A single page of a longer letter, the beginning and end of which have been lost. This appears to be correspondence with a prospective patient, for Dr. Freud urges them to consider accepting "the services which I have gratis offered." The prospective patient had suffered emotional trauma of an unspecified nature many years previously. Freud wrote: "Having learned of the tragedy, I would like to turn that knowledge to some good. I feel sure that it has weighed on you, so much so that you may not be fully conscious of its impact. Over the summer, will you not come again to see me? I daresay there have been few with whom you could ever discuss it. I promise I shall not treat you as an invalid or an hysteric. But I believe 'the talking cure,' as my colleague has dubbed it, has beneficial effects for many who have had to repress strong feelings or painful memories in order to get on with life. Having pursued a profession devoted to orderly thought, rationality, and logic, I would urge you once more to consider the…" Here the page ends.
