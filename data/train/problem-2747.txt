Sherlock shook his head. “No. I’ll go alone.”
Lestrade’s eyes widened. “I’m…” he stammered. “Er…maybe…?”
. At least that was what he’d have to hope.
“Well asexual aromantics usually do,” Irene said with a smile.
I paused the video for a moment, not daring to watch onwards. Perhaps drinking hadn’t been the best idea. After giving myself some time to gather myself again, I continued. All that was left was the cheeky end. His smile and wink that had brought smiles to me at my birthday and brought them back again, though this time with a few tears too.
“Cor, what’d you do to that man?”
John settled back on the sofa and asked Shannon a few more questions. Mostly he just admired the way the dressing robe emphasized her lovely curves. She was very pretty. And from the way she kept smiling at him, he was getting the idea she was keen too.
“Really?”
“I should have done something like this months ago,” Irene moaned, head falling back as she let arousal and desire overwhelm her. She turned back towards Kate. It seemed a bit unfair to require so much of her in such a short time, but the other woman appeared equally aroused an interested by the activities on screen.
“That new boy…Greg or whatever his name is,” Mary said, “he’s apparently very good at French. He’s been telling everyone that his father is French. Gives him his French last name or whatever.”
“Holmes is hardly of importance,” Moriarty sneered. “Even the Ice Man. I want her. And I’ll have her.”
“Come to Anderson’s party with me?” Watson said with a smile.
John had been upset? By what? He tried to remember what they’d last said to each other, though it was difficult for him to determine exactly when John had left the room. Had he said anything that seemed offensive? He didn’t remember doing so. Perhaps that was only Mrs. Hudson’s overactive imagination. No doubt she was watching some crap telly program while baking, probably inspiring all sorts of ideas about the drama that was going on with her tenants.
“Only the ridiculous and idiotic expectations which dictate our education system,” Sherlock muttered.
“Verbal? Darling you walked into your room to find me naked in your bed.”
“Shut up, Lestrade. No. I’m surrounded by idiots.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but one of John’s fingers pressed to his lips.
“I just can’t believe this is actually happening,” Greg said for the third time. “I’m going to get to talk with her. Maybe dance with her. Get her a drink. Maybe she’ll…maybe she’ll even let me kiss her.”
Molly laughed. “Oh god you’re terrible at this. It’s just…little things. I don’t know. Maybe you could write her a song on your violin and play it. Or I don’t know…do something she needs done around the house. I’m sure you’ll figure something out.” She stared into his eyes. “Take her out to dinner maybe?”
“And what about you? Fixing your eyes on someone?”
The silence ended.
He stood up and went over to snatch the phone out of the case. Molly was still staring at him. He gave her one last glance and a nod before reaching for his coat and going to the door before he even fully had it on.
However, instead of the younger Holmes brother, it was the adopted sister who walked by. Molly Holmes. He looked her over, taking in her lithe figure, long hair held back in a ponytail that was just begging to be pulled. And indeed, perhaps exuding an air of virginity. Beside her was Mary Morstan. He caught her eye and she glanced away, just the slightest bit of a blush rising on her cheeks.
“Oh, I was busy watching the feed for a bit,” Kate said. “It’s been a while since I’ve checked it.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Nothing, now don’t we have more important matters at hand, like a case?”
“Getting back at him for what he did to me,” Donovan said with a shrug. “Yes. Bastard deserves it. Here… scatter a few for me. And on top of that I’ve made a few social media threads too. News should get out pretty soon.”
He couldn’t believe he’d allowed this to go so far. Clearly nothing good would come of being in love with Molly.
Lestrade was apparently busy. He waited on the line, wondering how long he should hold before just giving up and taking action himself. Not that he wasn’t going to do
"Yeah, it's faulty, can't seem to fix it," he said.
He looked up at last, eyes refocusing. “Hmm? I suppose we do don’t we? Now how is Moriarty going to end me?”
“Sure,” Donovan said. “We’ll do some research and find out more about what he likes. Has to be something that appeals to that freakish mind of his.”
"Searching for my phone," he said. "I need to send a text."
Sherlock was still lost in John’s blue eyes. He didn’t get a chance to reply. But he didn’t need to. A voice answered from behind him.
"If you're quite through with your dusting, would you mind giving John and I a minute?" Sherlock said in a crisp tone.
“Yes,” the boy said, looking confused.
“We’ll finish up when we move,” Irene purred in her ear. “Break in our new bed all right and proper.”
“Don’t worry, I’ve studied the subject of male sex rather extensively,” he deadpanned, smoothing a hand down my torso.
“Oh darling, you forget I know his ex. Cindi…you know that accountant I played with last fall?”
She was a very lovely woman, Mary. And I was so glad to have her with me. For a while, I started to forget about my dear Sherlock. And then Lestrade popped by one day for absolutely no reason…with a box of Sherlock’s possessions, most importantly a DVD with a note he’d left for my birthday.
With a smile, Sherlock leaned his head in closer, arms wrapping around John's waist. John made a noise of contentment and closed his eyes.
“Farewell, Dr. Watson,” Irene said.
Sherlock squinted at whatever was there, going to have a seat.
He’d found himself unable to look away. John’s face, the way he smiled. There was just something in his eyes, so perfect, so lovely.
Sherlock squirmed beneath his hands, but John couldn't say he faulted him. It was so easy to be impatient after all they'd been through. His breath caught in anticipation as he wrangled the pants down around Sherlock's knees. Sherlock looked up at him, licked his lips and then began reciprocating by pulling his own trousers and pants off.
It was over almost as soon as it had begun. Sherlock was pulling away, leaving John gasping and alone and confused. The fog of alcohol made it easy to just focus on the sensations, but deep down something in John knew that he needed to say something, not just lean in and kiss Sherlock again.
“You said you had a thing,” Lestrade sneered from behind the camera.
“Just happy to be home after a long day,” Sherlock said, pausing as he realized this was perhaps a bit much. On seeing John’s puzzled expression he added, “Dinner?”
She didn’t think Sherlock had ever explicitly told her, but did it matter? Everything about him made it rather obvious.
He thought a moment. Everything in him wanted to use logic. But of course that wasn’t a possibility in the criterion.
Sherlock’s shock over the events of the day only culminated when he saw Molly getting into Moriarty’s car. He watched as she and Mary Morstan slid into the back seat and felt his fingers curl tighter on the steering wheel of his own vehicle. In the seat beside him, his best friend made a shocked noise.
for auld lang syne,
“This time I did.”
John grunted and suddenly jolted forward a little. Sherlock was instantly aware of the hardness rubbing against his leg. Oh that was good. He moved his leg a little to adjust better to John’s need. The other man let out a moan, and Sherlock smiled. Apparently he wasn’t altogether terrible at this.
“Hullo, er…what’s going on?” John asked.
“Of course, your measurements, how unoriginal.”
“Yes,” she agreed. “But what does that have to do with—”
“Indeed,” Irene said, eyeing the detective playing his violin. “The longer the set up, the bigger the fall…or perhaps we’ll settle for the longer the tumble in bed.”
Sherlock growled and turned away, eyes scanning over the room, trying to spot her. Where was Molly? Was she in trouble? Maybe she’d had something in her drink. Maybe she hadn’t arrived at all…perhaps there had been an accident. His thoughts were going wild.
He pulled John’s chair out for him, helped him with his coat (and earned another look for it). He sat down and looked into John’s eyes and asked him how his day was. There was a touch of incredulity in John’s face as he simply settled for saying it was fine. Sherlock was about to press for more details when the owner ambled over to their table.
“The only one that fit the description. Had her brought here – your home from home,” Mycroft said as they stepped in.
Sherlock gave a light smirk. "I'll ensure you explode…but in a way I think you'll find much more pleasurable."
“Oh, just tricky with last names you know. Well, it is for everyone in the modern world I suppose,” Irene said with a wave of her hand. “But I rather like Hamish Holmes. Has a nice ring to it. Were you thinking surrogate or adoption?”
“Hello,” she said with a cheerful smile.
“Bastard,” John muttered.
“Yes.”
To his surprise, however, he found the room empty.
Sherlock shrugged. He didn’t really know what to say. What, sorry John I’m having a crisis where I find myself attracted to you and I wanted to watch some porn to see if that would help? Or John would you please just come have sex with me so I might stop feeling confused? No, he had enough social awareness to know one didn’t spring that on someone. Especially a friend who had no inclinations towards the same sex.
Again he began to picture dating her. Perhaps sitting at a café table both steadily eating even as Molly beamed up at him. Or going to the movies and wrapping his arm around her shoulder. Going on a picnic and lying close together on a blanket. Her smile, her laugh, her sparkling eyes. All of it was so clear to him.
“Can’t you?” Irene said, raising an eyebrow. “Honestly darling, I remember someone being quite oblivious to romantic looks.”
“Well you two could talk,” Molly suggested, smiling tersely.
Sherlock had been at his chair when John woke, watching him carefully. John had half expected some snarky remark or something rude about his drinking. But instead Sherlock was silent.
"John," Sherlock murmured when they broke apart, panting for breath. He smiled again, fond and tender. "I am so incredibly glad…I never imagined…"
“Yeah,” John said, clearing his throat. “Yeah, I’m fine. Er…you?’
for auld lang syne.
“And where is this item now?” Mycroft asked.
"You know Mycroft could just phone me," he grumbled under his breath. "If he didn't have this bloody stupid power complex."
Molly stared at him for a long moment and shook her head. “No, a…a person’s room is very personal.”
“Gay? Hold on, I’m not gay. I’m just—”
,” he imagined John saying. The man moved to take his shirt of, revealing an expanse of pale flesh.
It only took a few more thrusts before Sherlock let out a loud cry and climaxed. John could hardly contain himself. With a groan, he canted his hips a little faster. In a matter of seconds he was coming, moaning Sherlock's name.
“Where’s John?” he asked.
“Hmm—still going to deny you’re interested, John? I know you are. How could you not be?”
Whatever words I had managed to spit out were full of every bit of anger and frustration I felt. Asking him how he could do this to me, how he could allow me to grieve. I wanted to ask him how he’d managed to make me fall in love with his most selfish act. How had he done it.
"Of course," she managed, doing her best to put a smile on in spite of her fear.
“Oh…um…decided I didn’t like her…nose,” John had said, cursing himself for not coming up with a better excuse.

“Nice ride,” John Watson said. “I like the fenders.”
John’s head tilted to the side. “Hold on…read where?”
“Oh?” his head tilted slightly.
Irene thought for a moment and then she smiled. Well, if Moriarty had become her enemy, her enemy’s enemy had just become her friend.
“Of course not, darling. I have great plans for these two. Wondrous plans. Now, why don’t I tell you a few while you do that thing you did in Rome.”
“Pictures, information, anything I might find useful.”
It took Lestrade only a few more minutes to arrive. Apparently he’d deemed himself the least annoying of his officers. Sherlock was inclined to agree. And of course an ambulance was there as well, paramedics rushing over to pick the American up and strap him to a gurney. Sherlock did his best to appear worried, even as a small smirk crept onto his face.
There was only a loud snore in reply, but it was enough for Sherlock, knowing John was sleeping and safe…and potentially returned his feelings. They would have to have a good talk.
It took a moment for those words to really sink in. Sherlock wasn’t sure if he could speak. It took him a moment.
He eyed Sherlock's form by the window, trying his best to be nonchalant about it, even as he felt a spike of something warm but unmistakably melancholy as he regarded his best friend. Love, and sorrow, and arousal, and anger, and confusion all mixed into one.
What the bloody hell was he doing? But if I truly was uncomfortable I didn’t voice it. He was so close, his breath against my cheek. I didn’t dare move as he cupped my face and leaned in and—
She’d used his school email. Contacting him to set up the meeting. And he responded five minutes later to say that he’d be delighted to meet her over lunch to begin working with her. Perfect, finally she’d have her second language straightened out and actually make the grades she wanted. Third language. She was forgetting Latin. But Latin didn’t involve speaking. Especially speaking with growling noises and strange formations of the mouth that didn’t suit her usual English pronunciation.
On seeing his face she laughed outright. John was scrunching further under the desk, trying to hide how much the idea was affecting him.
He held up the phone to show her what he’d typed in.
“Mycroft, you might want to look into our insurance policy,” he said, doing his best to keep his smile at bay.
There were footsteps on the stairs and then John was back up. He glanced at Sherlock and sighed before running a hand through his hair. His eyes closed, and Sherlock tried to put himself back into his music rather than paying attention to the aesthetics of John in the low lamplight.
"Christ!" John gasped, doing his best to cover himself, and finding all he had to do the job was the lube. It did a pitiful job of it, but it was better than nothing.
“I can’t take all the credit. Had a bit of help,” she said suddenly. “Oh, Jim Moriarty sends his love.”
In 221 A, he watched as John fussed a little more of Mrs. Hudson. He listened calmly to the suggestion that she come stay upstairs with them, though he chastised John for thinking of sending her away. It was best she was where Sherlock could keep an eye on her. In case the Americans decided to make any more stupid decisions.
Sherlock spent the next day trying to avoid his sister. He wasn’t sure how she’d figured things out, but he wasn’t pleased. He’d been so careful. Besides Irene, there were few he’d actually confessed to, or at least few who’d seen the truth. So how she’d managed to work out what was going on in his head astounded him. Even Mycroft hadn’t said much on the subject.
If John had said that in any other context Sherlock might have broken into a grin and kissed him on the spot. But here, it was simply the wrong place and the wrong time.
Greg nodded slowly, though John still wasn’t certain if the message had sunk in. However, Sherlock had tilted to the side, and he was forced to reach out and grab Sherlock before he could topple to the side.
He was in a fog. The case he’d just cracked. The woman he’d had chasing after him. John’s attentions. And for once….he couldn’t think.
"Of course it worked," Sherlock scoffed. "Mycroft will always be an idiot."
A breathy female sigh, rang out through the little flat. John glanced for his laptop wondering suddenly if he’d left a video playing accidentally or if a pop up had come up or something. That would be his luck. Instead, Sherlock got up and stalked over to retrieve his phone.
And of course, being Sherlock, he had to turn it all into a joke.
Molly’s lower lip trembled slightly, but she sat, folding her hands in her lap. Sherlock looked up at Mycroft, waiting for the hammer to fall.
John held his breath as a count began. Sherlock glanced at him, and John caught just a flash of panic in his eyes. No, that wasn’t good. Not for him.
“No,” he argued. “All it’s doing is making you paranoid. I won’t have any of it. You’re doing fine, Sherlock. God, can’t you see that? How much I want you? How much I love spending my days with you?”
“Absurd?” Mycroft sneered. “How quickly did you decipher that email for her? Was it the full minute, or were you really
The sweeping motion of the bow, the careful grip Sherlock kept on the long neck of the instrument, fingers dancing over the surface as he quickly morphed into a more lively concerto piece after Mycroft had disappeared out the door. His whole body was poised in anticipation of each note, eyes closing briefly in a moment of passion.
Thanks for all the subscriptions and bookmarks and kudos etc. and thank you especially to feisty_one, Chocolaty_Minds,
“No worries,” Irene said with a purr. “He has that effect on me too. Why don’t you start by giving him a little kiss, Dr. Watson?”
Lestrade was still looking at him with a peculiar expression. “You seem more…yourself today.”
"All right," Kate repeated. "You're forgiven. If you behave, that is. Will you behave for me, mistress?"
The door to the bathroom closed and he heard the shower start. John finished dressing and headed out. He tried to think about what had happened in the cab ride home, but really there wasn’t much he could make about it other than the fact that he was clearly having some kind of sexuality crisis. No other men did this to him. He hadn’t been interested in anyone before, even though he’d had more than one man hit on him in his lifetime. But Sherlock…there was just something about Sherlock.
“Your girlfriend’s?” Molly asked with a playful smile Sherlock caught out of the corner of his eye. He wasn’t sure why, but something about her behavior set him on edge. She’d been so eager to flirt with him the other night, but now she appeared perfectly calm as she asked if he had a girlfriend. How was such a thing possible? Human emotions. Those would always confound him. Reasons to not have them he supposed.
Sherlock smiled. "I would love to. Though…I do believe most men have an understanding of…who will top? Do you have a strong preference?"
a girlfriend,” John said with a scowl. “And these are still embarrassing to explain even with a significant other in the picture. I mean, normally you don’t do these on purpose, you know. They just sort of happen in the heat of the moment.”
"That's fantastic."
Irene sighed and hung up. Such a delicious little thing. But such a disappointment. She eyed the phone one last time before pushing it away. Molly was a lovely woman, but her inclinations were just too tame to be of any use. Thankfully, they’d made themselves quite handy in terms of roping someone in to doing a little dirtywork on setting Sherlock and John up. But really…the whole romancing was the last thing on her mind at the moment.
. I know that might be hard for a virgin like you to understand, but do try.”
Sally’s eyes met his in the mirror and she smiled.
Irene was staring at him as he arrived back at their row. Within a few seconds he’d figured out why. John Watson had taken the seat next to his.
The boy had turned to glare at his lab partner who had swiftly turned off the gas.
Lestrade brightened. “But you have seen him with boys before?” he asked. “You know he’s gay, and he’s dated before?”
“Oh and don’t worry,” I stared deep into those gorgeous stormy eyes. “I’m going to be with you again…very soon.”
The man stiffened beneath him, before relaxing some as he realized John was working a path down. There was a stifled noise from Sherlock’s mouth as John finally reached his destination.
“Yes you are,” Irene Adler said, full red lips forming an even larger smile.
Sherlock was silent. He had no words for her. His heart was pounding more quickly. Was it possible? He had been suspecting John had lied…but it still seemed so unlikely. Could John truly love him?
She fell asleep not too long after that. I laid awake long into the night, staring up at the ceiling and thinking over everything that had happened. Part of me was so afraid that if I closed my eyes, it would turn out to not be real. But at long last I became too knackered to keep my focus, and I drifted off in the early morning hours.
After a bit the sound of footsteps stirred him from his hopes of sleep. He looked up at Sherlock as he stalked back into the room. His brow was furrowed, hands steepled under his chin as he began a pace of the sitting room.
it persay. More like made sure it actually happened. I’ve wanted to do that since the day I saw you jump…or…er…I realized I wanted to do it since then. I know it was wrong to do it that way but I…”
In many ways, he’d been one of the most insufferable prats I’d ever met. He was a right git with his inconsiderate ways and his big ego and his bloody mood swings. But I never had met someone who had made me feel so alive, so eager to face life, so…purposeful. He made me chuckle, or more often roll my eyes. I thought of those fantastic cases, and just the little daily moments I’d come to miss as well. Having someone there to talk to (or talk at depending), or bring a cup of tea to (never reciprocated mind you), or just have the comfortable presence of a second person there in the room. And I had to admit I’d grown accustomed to him in his own peculiar kind of way.
But why? How could that be? Perhaps the drug was still active. Sherlock decided to switch to another choice of stimulus. Hmmm…well who were other people he knew and seemed to like. Perhaps—Molly Hooper? Sherlock imagined her taking off her top and found this much less inspiring. His erection flagged. No, not that then. Men maybe? Lestrade? He nearly gagged at the thought, and that was enough to let him know that wouldn’t be effective. There were few other people he cared about in any capacity. So John it was.
“Uh, yeah, you’re right,” he said, only to realize how idiotic it sounded tacked on to what Irene had just said. His face felt too hot. “Er… uh, flight double oh seven that is.”
Sherlock started walking, heading towards the door. He didn’t look back. Let Mycroft think what he wanted.
“Bit of a bad habit,” Sherlock managed to whisper breaking him away from his staring.
John chuckled. “All right, fine. You’re being strange today, but if that’s what helps you, I can’t argue.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock had found a towel and mopped up most of the mess. After that was done he reached up and undid his scarf, pulling the wet material away from himself and setting it on the chair. Next came the coat. Which was when John remembered why it was imperative Sherlock keep them on.
“What?”
“What do you think?”
“How are you?” Lestrade asked.
The echo of violin music in the flat was becoming a daily experience John was steadily growing more and more used to. Sure, Sherlock had played the violin from time to time. But never like this. Never for hours on end, long melodies of sad music drifting through Baker Street.
“You touch one hair on her head and I’ll—”
These were Sherlock’s lips touching his. This was Sherlock’s more bristly upper lip, his longer nose that bumped against John’s in an awkward adjustment of placement. This was Sherlock’s slightly less practiced mouth opening ever so slightly, hinting at tongue contact that had John’s breath catching… wait hold up—
She ran her fingers over her dresser, wondering if Moriarty was already aware of her little plan. Most likely. She wasn’t sure that boded well for her or her boys.
“That was different,” Kate said, sighing and closing her eyes momentarily.
“You were around her age,” Irene pointed out. “Still so young and innocent. Still a virgin by all accounts. Other than oral if I’m correct. You gave that to Victor the year before.”
“Where is it now?” John asked.
Still, the point was he was confused by what had happened yesterday, but that didn’t mean he needed to linger on it. Sherlock shoved the door of those embarrassing boyhood memories closed and looked up to see why John hadn’t answered him yet on the potential substances Irene had used.
“Well, it just puts me in an awkward position,” John said. “You know, having to either be with her and having you constantly texting me, or having her here feeling unwelcome with your cold shoulder.”
He gazed at her for a moment, clearly discerning her meaning but deciding there was no reason to answer. She’d given him what he needed. Nothing extremely important, but he had an idea now of what to expect from Moriarty so that was something. But as a result he didn’t need to give her anymore than she already had.
“Jeane—mmm broke it off. And yer so goooood at kissin’. Liked it earlier. If’t weren’t for tha’ bitch…wasser name? Mmm…the woman.”
“Up the stairs, third floor,” she instructed. “I’m heading off to answer another call. But Greg should be there.”
“He’s still been…disagreeable. But that’s Sherlock for you, isn’t it?”
Her eyes went wide for a moment before she smiled again. He could practically see her thoughts running wild. Most likely conjuring smutty imaginings up he supposed.
“She seems cozy with him,” Lestrade commented.
Sherlock was in a foul mood by the time they arrived at the party. He set off into the house, aware that John was tailing him. He shot a single smug look at Anderson, admiring how upset he was over the party happening against his will, before Sherlock was up the stairs and looking for Molly.
“To define is to limit,” Irene said, licking her lips. “And really darling, what’s the point? If I had to pick something for your sake I’d say pansexual homoromantic.”
However, there were greater problems for her to worry about. The CIA was on to her, they’d found her and had proved themselves willing to take extreme measures to get to her phone.
“I was just talking to him.”
“Him,” Donovan said, nodding across the way.
Sherlock wanted to murmur some kind of soft reassurance, but instead he kept his face neutral. “I expect so,” he said. He did his best to keep the gun pointed and the phone up, even though he wished he had a free hand. Some means of touching John… “Now go.”
Donovan’s eyes glittered. “Oh certainly. Stay away from my grades.”
"How can
“Confused? Obviously. Get out. I’m not dealing with your sexuality crisis.”
And to make matters worse, John just had to go and compliment him.
John shrugged and took another sip of his drink. Well, he hated to make that sexual image his motivation, because he already had more than enough, but he did admit it really really couldn’t hurt.
The small bits I admitted to my therapist had been helpful. We’d gone over grieving and moving on. Regrets were apparently just part of the process, and I’d have to deal with them to some level anyways, but especially now all things considered.
“Please, Sherlock? For me?”
He tried his best to silence her, snaking his tongue into her mouth and affectively quieting some of the louder noises. His hands reached for the clasp on her bra, undoing it and allowing it to fall to the floor.
Sorry for the late update! Comments keep me going!
“Okay, yeah. I’m down for that.”
He turned to stare at a woman in an elegant black dress. Her long silky hair and attractive features caught his attention almost immediately. Her entire carriage seemed to suggest sex. She smiled and he almost groaned. God why didn't he wank before he left the place?
“Yeah, definitely. Well, I’d best be off. You have a good rest of your day. Best of luck with your dog.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“No, this is…we set John up with Sherlock all so this could happen,” Greg whispered. “It’s…how could this not happen?”
“So, why’s she here?” John said with a sigh.
John offered a half smile. Well, there was a small victory. At least she still was interested in having their “private” Christmas party together. He took another long drink. Maybe alcohol would make the time go faster.
“What? Sorry, what?” Molly said, lowering her drink. John took that as his cue to have another sip of his.
“Are you following me?” Sherlock muttered pulling his bag of books a little closer. It didn’t take much for him to deduce that Watson clearly was doing just that.
He moved off her and collapsed to the side on the bed, panting as he tried to regain his breath. He wondered if she would be alright with him staying the night too so he didn’t have to go back to Sherlock. However, when he turned to look at her he found her staring at him.
"It's not?"
“Please,” Sherlock said again, chest heaving. “Please, John. I…I beg of you. Your…your hand at least. Please. I’m begging. Mercy. John. Please.”
“Ah, no need to worry. I understand the shock likely put you into a confusing emotional state,” he said. “Though Mary might want some kind of an explanation, I don’t believe I require one.”
“I don’t
Smut not a lot, but some. Please be warned (don’t like don’t read).
"There's nothing to work through," he said. "I'm…I'm yours, John. If you want me."
“We want to help,” Lestrade said quickly.
Sherlock stiffened. “I didn’t mean it in that respect. I’m simply suggesting that things have been rocky between them and it has been causing John a certain level of…moodiness. Now, the case?”
“Well, perhaps not then,” Irene said with a shrug. “Shows that denial doesn’t always last then, does it?” she gave him a pointed look.
All I really managed to determine was that he was as callous and thick as ever, pointing out that apparently Mary did not appreciate my facial hair, acting like it didn’t even matter he hadn’t bothered to tell me, still finding the whole situation funny even after being punched in the face on three separate occasions.
“Every now and again,” the boy said. “And someone like Sherlock…I like a challenge.”
He gave the pertinent information before returning to the sitting room. And that was when he found Sherlock slumped on the floor, Irene standing over him smiling.
“Lovely, Sherlock, that was lovely!” Mrs. Hudson cried, giggling. “I wish you could have worn some antlers.”
Molly held up her hand. “Il y a un problème.”
Molly had to admit, she’d anticipated a longer hunt, but this made things easy.
John smirked and shook his head. "You're all mine. I'm not sharing you, Sherlock. Never. Now come here."
However, just as he was thinking of hanging up to take care of Mrs. Hudson the door opened and John strode in.
Sherlock quickly spoke. “There’s a margin for error but I’m pretty sure—”
The door closed behind him, and he breathed a sigh of relief. Good, escaped from that little trap. Mycroft wouldn’t know, he’d think it something to do with Irene Adler. And Sherlock could return to his pining for John in peace.
Sherlock pulled away, eyes wide. "Is that your desire? That we…"
"Er…" John said, staring at him.
“Well, I’ll make a married woman of you yet, Mary,” I muttered.
“Oh John! John!” Mrs. Hudson cried, but it was too late as the door was already closing.
“Er…compromising the integrity of the crime scene, are we?” John asked from the sofa.
“It’s a deal.”
Could it be real? Was it a taunt of some kind? She hardly dared to hope as she pressed the buttons necessary to open the thing. And was presented with three words she hadn't imagined she'd see.
Sherlock decided to recreate things to the best of his ability. He slipped back into the bedroom, closed the door in case John should come home for some reason—doubtful, probably out having a drink or something.
“Well,” he murmured, managing a smile, “I think you’re going to have to cancel those engagement plans. I really am surprised by your Mary. Here she’s telling me she’ll talk you round…I had no idea she meant to take it this far.”
Whatever came next was a blur of details that John could hardly process in the moment. Not with Sherlock sitting there in front of him looking so beautiful and brilliant. All in the name of Miss Adler, of course, but it was nonetheless impressive. He began to harden. God, not now.
"I don't know, Mrs. Hudson. I've never been able to wrestle any answers out of him," he said. "But he and Adler do seem to be close, I'll give them that."
He sank back on his elbows, eyes scanning over the various social groups. The preppy girls who were there to watch a few boys showing off with a basketball. And then the small dance troupe that had assembled in one corner.

Watson stared at him for a long moment. “Well it’s not The Rite of Spring, but I’d at least heard it was pretty good. So do you mind letting me actually enjoy?”
“Right, what’s the problem?” John asked.
“I want to go to Anderson’s party!” Molly cried. “Please, Mycroft, this is ridiculous.”
For the first time in a long while he found himself craving his traditional fare. Perhaps drugs might make things better… Maybe he’d have to search some out later.
John’s jaw clenched. “I don’t know what your problem is, but I’m not interested in playing your games.”
“I have no interest in the disgusting and disappointing selection of males at our school,” Sherlock muttered. “Not all of us are willing to spread our legs for the slightest bit of attractiveness.”
That was really the best way to describe it.
“Oh right,” he flapped his arms in a way that made me smile again. “Oh yes, right a thing.”
John moved forward, pressing past people. He noted Moriarty to one side leering. Molly’s eyes were wide, but she wasn’t moving to stop it.
John glanced at Sherlock who was over by the windows with his violin. If Sherlock had figured out he was experimenting with men he hadn’t said anything. Then again, Sherlock had seemed rather self-involved lately. He hadn’t seemed to notice much of anything around John. It had taken him two weeks to realize John had broken up with Shannon.
“If you’re planning on asking me out again you might as well get the humiliation over with,” Sherlock said with a sigh, reaching for a paper towel.
“I lost the woman I loved,” Irene said. “She’ll have no part of me since I lied to her. I never…I never even got to tell her how I truly felt….I danced around it. Pretended it was all sex. But it wasn’t. And I’ll never get a chance to make that up to her.
He disappeared into the stairway, and Sherlock was left alone. He eyed the American with distaste.
He couldn’t imagine what that would do to his reputation. After all, boys like Sherlock Holmes who did things like ballet tended to be lumped into… well…categories. He thought of how Donovan herself often called Holmes a freak. Yes, he couldn’t deal with that kind of pressure.
John had been trying to puzzle it out for months now.
“I assure you, the pleasure was all mine,” Irene said with another gorgeous smile. She winked once and left Sally to wonder why she’d ever decided to help Greg in the first place. She gave  along sigh before making up her mind.
She’d check on them in due time. But for the moment her desire to live outweighed her desire for sexual stimulus. There would be time for the lesser priorities later.
“I need a little break,” he admitted. “I’ve been puzzling over the phone for a good month now. And I need…time…to figure out its inner-workings. So instead, I’d love to enjoy dinner with you. Just…not think for a little bit.”
“Nope,” John said again, smiling slightly. “Not gonna fall for that one, you’ll have to try harder, love.”
“Burglary,” Sherlock said with a sigh. “Really Lestrade, do you have to be dreadfully
But still, he remembered something about John in all of that. Thinking about John. Hmm…odd. Still, in scientific process he decided to repeat with the same variables to see if he had the same results. So he began to think about John. Imagining him there in the room, smiling warmly.
As he calculated it became quite easy to figure out. All he needed was to get the leader alone. Getting rid of the cronies would provide him easy enough odds. And as with most men with guns, it was obvious the American was overconfident with his weapon.
Mary came to the table looking absolutely lovely. She was beaming at me, eyes sparkling. I couldn’t stop myself from thinking ahead, to years of happiness for the both of us. She was truly the most magnificent woman I’d ever met in my life.
“Yep, that’s me. Er…but I go by Greg…or Lestrade if you’d prefer,’ he said, swallowing down his nervousness. She was decent looking, but the way she carried herself intimidated him. He was even more struck by her firm handshake.
Sherlock stood, stalking over and scooping up John’s laptop. He’d changed the password yet again, but really it wasn’t too hard to tell. A few of the letters were smudged from where he’d been eating while typing yesterday, and it had been around then Sherlock remembered getting a glare.
I had finally begun to forget about him. I had started to move on with my life towards new horizons. And I embraced that reality as more time passed. At last, it came time for a final step towards ending my denials, towards recognizing the truth that I would never have him. And that was when I first decided to ask Mary to become a permanent part of my life.
Sherlock had brought her here after the rescue in Karachi. She'd been startled when they'd been welcomed into the house by Kate at first, though she quickly discovered that Sherlock had contacted her a month before, and he'd done some kind of miraculous job at explaining the circumstances.
“Indeed you are,” Sherlock muttered.
“John?” Jeanette said.
“Elevated. You pupils dilated,” he said.
“Oh right, sorry,” Sherlock said, straightening just a bit.
, he thought to himself, not daring to add it aloud in case Sherlock again commented on the ludicrous possibility of him writing a blog post about this event. It was tempting to the let the whole world know he was the one Sherlock had chosen. But never in this kind of detail. No. He couldn't share this with the world. It was his and his alone.
However, the dreams were a conclusion to my questioning. I was apparently attracted to Sherlock. It had taken his death to prove it, but nonetheless, I had fallen for him. All those denials had been for nothing. I’d missed my chance, and now I would live with the regrets of that.
Everything was perfect. I’d thought about it for months, bought the ring, reserved the table, made sure I had presentable clothes. Even grew my facial hair out a few months before in a thought of changing things up, making myself appear just a bit more masculine perhaps. I figured Mary would like that kind of thing. I put so much thought and care into it, I was convinced with all my effort there was no way I could cock up. It was going to be perfect.
Not that that would be any better, of course. Sherlock had to keep reminding himself that another girl could be worse. The awful polka-dotted woman for example had been dreadful. Sarah had been bearable, but even the thought of her now made him feel furious.
Sure, every bloke has a good cry every now and then. Those who say otherwise are lying. But this was different than the occasional little emotional moment. It wasn’t a few tears or a little sniffling, but wrenching sobs that shook every bit of me to the core. It was realizing that the person I’d come to care for in spite of all his aggravating qualities was gone for good, and there was no getting him back. I ended up falling asleep on the floor, no energy left to even drag myself to bed.
"No," Irene agreed. "Not at the moment. But I sense you'd like to be one."
“Mrs. Hudson’s class was acceptable today as we spent the majority of it taking a test on the Elizabethan era. Quite simple with facts of course, so black and white. And as for the problems with Mycroft, well he’ll eventually have to accept that he is not and never will be our father. And that I will make my own life decisions and there is nothing he can do about it.”
She had long dark hair, an attractive face in spite of the fact she didn’t have any makeup on. She was wearing a silky red dressing gown that nicely complimented her pale skin. She was tall and thing, and he had to admit he was immediately attracted.
Enjoy, read and review!
“Why?” Watson asked, brow furrowing. He looked back towards them, eyes narrowing as he did, fingers curling more tightly on the tool in his hands.
“He’s not interested,” I muttered. “Even…even if I am…he’s not…”
He watched the man stiffen, took a moment to enjoy the fact that he’d struck fear into him.
John shot him a look, eyebrows furrowed. “Er…thanks? If you’re going to mention my clumsiness at work you might as well do it.”
“Hey,” he said, doing his best to act nonchalant, even as his heart began beating faster.
“All of those things,” I said with a sigh. “But I don’t want a dictionary definition, Sherlock. I mean it as I say it. I love you. And I suppose I want to know if you feel the same.”
He avoided looking at her as he walked over to where Sherlock was sitting, moving onto the couch next to him, and tilting his face to get a better look at the damage he’d done.
Warnings are the same as always, sexual insinuations, Irene Adler being her usual dominatrixy self- femslash, slash, all that jazz. No smut just yet.
“It’s nothing crucial, so what happened? Don’t you be trying to put me off, I know you and John have been all out of sorts for months. So what was it this time?”
“What—” John’s voice broke somewhat and he concentrated on getting his words out in a normal tone. God he shouldn’t be thinking about that kiss but he was. “What’s up, Sherlock?”
Lestrade eyed Billy. “So maybe…”
Irene was wearing a low cut black dress, full make up, and tall stiletto heels that made her look incredibly sexy. Sally downed another swallow of her drink before heading in Adler’s direction.
"Are you jealous?" she asked.
They went to the workshop again. Sure enough, Watson was there, working with tools, eyes furiously glared on his project. Lestrade did his best not to shiver.
He looked at her. Ran his eyes over her and her sparkly dress and her red lipstick. This woman who seemed to be every bit as fake as a plastic doll. Perhaps this too was a ruse. A game. But the proof had been there. Kate was her heart. Her passcode.
"And if he does want me," Irene said. "What does that leave for you? You'll go back to a girlfriend or boyfriend every month?"
Thanks to feisty_one, holly, powerogirl, and Sophrederick for commenting. I always love feedback.
“Oh certainly.” Irene gave a smirk. “There were sparks on that kiss, Kate. Let me tell you. John Watson’s face, priceless. Sherlock tried to close himself off, but he looked towards the good doctor one time to many after. Yes, they’re well on their way. And I’ll play a few other games to solidify it.”
“Fine, you want to try it? Then be my guest. She’s actually looking for a French tutor.”
“What did I miss?” the boy asked from the doorway.
“Dealing with a high level of perspiration at the moment. And yourself?”
“Give my love to Sherlock, dear. After everything that’s happened he could use it. I know you’ll take good care of him.”
John smirked and wrapped an arm around Sherlock's waist.
“No!”
“You’re sure?” Lestrade asked, feeling his heart sinking. Maybe he’d been wrong to think this was possible.
“Sherlock, what the hell was—”
“Wear what you’re comfortable in,” Lestrade remarked. “Don’t give a fuck about what anyone else has to say.”
“Should I wear a dress do you think?”
“Yeah,” Lestrade said with a huff, shaking his head. “So you’re all right? All of you? No one harmed other than him?”
But no such thing. Instead Sherlock was busy opening mysterious packages in his room rather than attending to the package John wanted taken care of….God he was so horny. John just hoped Jeanette would make up for it tonight. He downed another large swallow of his drink and tried not to think about it.
The boy a table behind her had pulled out a switchblade and was cutting through the soft flesh of the frog’s belly. He then moved to switch on one of the gas lines and lit it before running the fire along the sides of his blade. Lestrade felt his jaw drop.
“Perhaps dinner with John then,” she said.
She shot him a glare but otherwise ignored him as she fixed her blouse, turning to and fro in front of the mirror.
“Were you really so blind to all that? A few chemical reactions and you think I’m
Irene had to agree, it was a bit. Still, nothing good would come of rushing things. She looked towards Kate’s reclined form and pondered another go, only to be interrupted by noise on the screen.
Sherlock tried and failed to look at his own neck. He shrugged. “A scarf will do.”
"I'll translate it myself. You've taken enough time," Moriarty said. "Plans, now. Or else I will go after that redhead like I said I would."
Sherlock was interrupted from replying as Mrs. Hudson called them to quiet down and begin class.
Another few seconds of preparation, another finger, and John finally accepted that they were ready. He thankfully didn't have to ask Sherlock's permission either as the man let out a low groan.
with Sherlock Holmes.”
Of course, just as he was about to give up and go back downstairs Moriarty swooped in.
Or even better, Irene’s words in his ear as he leaned in to try to solve her riddle.
John licked his lips, unable to figure out how to behave while waiting for Irene to give him permission. Well, if anyone had told him a year ago that a dominatrix would have him whipped into submission waiting to suck Sherlock off he would have laughed in their face. But here he was…kneeling and ready.
“So I can finish deducing all your secrets? I think not,” Sherlock replied.
Irene smiled and her eyes glittered. "Is that a threat, Dr. Watson?"
His thoughts went racing back to that night. But all he could come up with was how upset Sherlock had seemed to be over Irene's death. Surely there was nothing about it that should cause him so much distress in the moment.
“Oh that is good,” she said. “Very good.”
“Er that’s sweet Greg, but as you can see I’m busy with Jim at the moment.”
He settled on prolonging the fantasy. John was on the bed with him, one hand running down Sherlock’s chest, reaching for his buttons on his shirt, working them open one at a time. John’s mouth was on his neck. Having undone his shirt he was working his way down his chest, kisses and licks and—the heat was growing hotter, energy coiling more and more. How was this happening? This seemed impossible.
. He smirked. I am Sherlocked. Clever. Playful. Just like her. He’d told Molly she loved to play games, and he’d been right.
The detective ignored him and continued inspecting the windows. Lestrade just sighed and checked his phone instead.
He typed in the letters one by one into the phone. He smiled as he saw her face pale.
“You know The Rite of Spring ?” he demanded.
Mycroft met him in the entryway and walked with him up to the morgue.
“Perfect,” Lestrade said.
"Yes," John panted, moving faster. It hadn't been like this in months. All those women. The few men. He'd forgotten what it felt like to be with someone he cared about. To look down into someone's face and feel his heart wrench with desire and longing and…love.
“Watch it,” snapped a boy from the driver’s seat, icy blue eyes glaring at Donovan. “You might want to stop fucking Anderson, Donovan. It seems you’re unable to walk straight.”
Complaining? John shot Sherlock a look. With how grumpy the detective had been lately John had figured he would probably relish having some alone time. Apparently it was just the opposite.
“Wait, I didn’t—” His mind was a bit fuzzy as he tried to think back to what he’d called out. He didn’t remember crying anything out. But if he had—
“And for that matter,” John added, still smiling, moving to grasp Sherlock’s hand, “I love you too.”
"I'm what, John?" Sherlock asked.
He stood and walked to the front door. She sat there and listened until she heard the telltale slam and then heavy footsteps on the front porch. The start of a car engine let her know he truly was leaving. She sighed and sank back into the chair as she listened as the car drove further away. Well, so much for that.
“Er…I thought we could start with pronunciation…” he said.
“Oh, my apologies,” Sherlock said. “So sorry. Why don’t you go change, I’ll clean this mess up and continue investigating.”
“It was an experiment of sorts,” Sherlock said.
A short one, but nonetheless wanted to update for the awesome people who've asked for more. :)
“No thanks, I’m fine,” Lestrade said. “So, any leads, Sherlock?”
“Perhaps,” Irene said. “Or perhaps Jim will only escalate as he so often does.”
“Sorry,” John said, pulling back. “Was that alright?”
—John cut off his thoughts with an angry shake of his head.
He squirmed beneath the sheets, groaning. Her eyes widened as she watched his hand move beneath the sheet. Oh yes. Yes! Her breathing sped up, warmth growing in her belly as she watched the detective begin to touch himself.
The problem was that he couldn’t stop thinking about the day before…everything that had happened…in particular the horrible strangeness of dealing with drugged up Sherlock.
After all, he’d normally just let such things bounce off. But today was different for some reason.
Boooorrreeed. SH
“I wouldn’t mind a little time with that nice arse,” the boy said with a grin.
John stared at him momentarily before coming up with a reply. “First off, I don’t sleep with that many women. Secondly, I would never go around sleeping with someone like Irene Adler.”
“Won’t you come have a seat, Mr. Holmes. I’m sure we have a lot to discuss.”
His eyes closed, and he did his best to drift into his mind palace, look at something more pleasant than his memories of John. Something distracting.
“What you didn’t like it?” I said, though I tried to act casual.
"Also wanted to wish us well," John mentioned, coming over to slide a hand onto Sherlock's shoulder before kissing him, "Seems he's figured out we're together now."
His attention was caught by an attractive girl walking by. She was wearing jeans and a cardigan, her hair pulled back into a ponytail. Many might have passed her over as plain, but her features were delicate and she had a smile on her face. He looked her over appreciatively.
Lestrade ran his eyes over Watson’s form, searching for signs that the other man might be planning to get physical if need be.
“And where will your dancing take you, Sherlock? Really? Working in strip clubs with your ridiculous
Molly glanced at him and flushed before letting out a nervous giggle and continuing on her way.
Sherlock shrugged and grabbed yet another drink. John tried to take it, but Sherlock was having none of that.
“It took you long enough to get them,” Irene said, she stretched out, showing off just a bit more. “I really did think you hadn’t noticed. So good you did for Dr. Watson’s sake.” She looked towards him smiling. “Perhaps some of that love is returned at least.”
For the most part, he’d lived a fairly sexless life. As a boy one or two girls had approached him, but he’d never had much interest in them. Occasionally a more intelligent one would intrigue him, but the draw was rarely if ever sexual. And then of course, as a youth he’d considered boys…and had to admit if he was to act sexually those seemed slightly more appealing to him in some ways. He’d had a boy he’d liked back in secondary…a few years older than him and particularly gifted in school. He remembered being somewhat enthused at the prospect of spending time with him, happy in their platonic relationship when they’d gone out one night after a study session…but altogether confused when the boy had attempted to kiss him.
His only comfort was in knowing the teacher was at least someone he rather enjoyed. Mrs. Hudson beamed at them as they took their seats. Sherlock sighed and settled back, doing his best to avoid eye contact as his nemesis took a seat beside him.
The park was somewhat empty, just with a few morning joggers and pet owners walking about. Sherlock had to grin at the irony of John Watson as he gently pulled him out of his coat pocket and held him balled in his hands. If hedgehogs could give a death stare, John was giving one right now.
"I guess this is it then, I'm your
"And when did that happen?"
Mrs. Hudson had never mentioned any noises from the flat upstairs, nor did she ever mention the change in moods of her two musicians upstairs when she brought up some crumpets the next morning. Life was too short to go on alone, and if they found happiness, meaning and a little healing within each others company, so be it.
"Mike." He responded, regaining his balance and running a gloved hand through his hair.
aight I think I missed sumthin today. Do we hve any hmwrk??
you are not to leave this cave, Sherlock!” Mycroft took on his full height once more before gently grabbing a corner of his brother's tunic with his teeth and lifting him up off the ground. Sherlock couldn't do anything now but cross his arms with a frown.
“I need to know. Did you kill your sister?”
Comments & Kudos are always appreciated <3
Greg huffed and rolled his eyes, dropping himself into another seat and lounging until their next teacher, Mrs. Hudson, came through the door with a kind smile.
“Both.” Moran again.
Molly lost the battle and slowly laid her hand in his, watching as John removed the wet ball of ice that was wrapped in cloth, to examine her hand. He gently brushed a finger over it to test her reaction and she flinched a little. Not terrible, he thought. When John arose from his chair Molly was startled a little bit then looked at him questioningly.
Lestrade handed off some papers to his secretary and headed toward his office; doctor and consulting detective following behind. "Look John, I'm sorry but it's not our division. Murray was murdered outside of our-"
“Sherlock was complaining,” Molly said. And then she seemed to realize what she’d said. “Saying,” she corrected.
Sherlock shrugged, what would he know about such things. Yet another reason John would never want him. His inexperience. His awkwardness in sex, in relationships, in knowing how something as simple as a love bite functioned. He let out a long sigh before rising to walk towards his bedroom. John was right, best to cover these marks up, pretend they’d never happened. Hope no one would ever have to find out about their awkward little encounter.
Sherlock nodded. “So being…kinder? And trying a little flattery and some bribes?”
“The tea! If you’d like some. I just put a kettle on.”
“You weren’t far off though. Like you I need a heart to my brain. Brainy might be sexy…but it requires balance, doesn’t it? Why if you only had your John here I guarantee he would have sorted you out.”
Donovan raised one solitary eyebrow. “You make this sound simple. This is not only an issue of finding another boy interested and willing to be in a homosexual relationship…but also one who is willing to put up with the freak…the most obnoxious and callous and rude person in the entire school. On top of that, Sherlock Holmes hasn’t dated. Ever. And suddenly you just expect him to change?”
Well the resolutions to the party will have to wait a bit. I'm off to England for two weeks so it might be a bit, but hopefully I can do some writing on the road.
However, as he thought of Irene and what she’d done to him, a better thought popped into his mind. Why not do an experiment? The drugs had likely been swept out of his system by now. Or at least he didn’t feel altogether different from normal. So, if he tried recreating the same scenario and seeing if it had the same effect—why that might shed some light on whether or not she’d drugged him or not.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow and gazed down at me expectantly, eyes searching over me. “I don’t understand what you mean, John. If you’re indicating you missed me…then I agree, I feel the same.”
It only took a few tugs before it was over. Sherlock crying out and pulsing into his hand. John felt himself throb desperately, but he didn’t dare do anything about it. This was about information. It wasn’t about his pleasure.
“John, in your medical opinion, do you have any ideas what she might have dosed me with?” Sherlock asked.
“I just…you’re behaving oddly,” she said. “I just…was curious.”
“Information?” Sherlock said. “What kind?”
“It’s not that hard Mr. Holmes. I’ll direct you and him as I see fit. Just fifteen minutes. I promise you. I know that’s all it would take.”
He could barely keep his voice from rising in tone, barely able to contain what he was feeling. He grinned and did his best not to stare too long at the boy across the room. Still, the very sight of this person had visions of Molly dancing through his head. He was one step closer.
Kate licked her lips at the very thought.
. He stared at it. He couldn’t have miscalculated could he? No. This was Irene’s heart. He was certain of it. All her ramblings about love and disadvantages. Her elevated pulse. Her dilated eyes. Wasn’t that the answer?
“Fine,” Sherlock said. He stood again to go over to the table where he’d left his violin sitting. He picked it up and began picking at it.
I groaned and threw my head back. “It’s not something I can explain to you, Sherlock. It’s not precise science or clever deductions. And no I don’t want just a quick shag or even a snog…although both of those would be nice… Love’s an emotion. It’s a feeling I get every time I look at you. It’s the ache in my chest when I thought you were gone, the fluttering inside my stomach when I know you’re here with me now. It’s the way my throat closed up coming up these stairs and seeing this place again. It’s right here and now, me standing here telling you I want you in every conceivable meaning of the word and that if you would have me Sherlock Holmes I would be yours.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said. “It’s all fine.”
“You’d better,” he said. “Or daddy’s going to get very angry. Daddy doesn’t like waiting, Irene. You’d best get it soon.”
She went over and sat down in one of the armchairs as he sank onto the couch.
“Show there’s no attraction. For example…kiss,” Irene’s eyes glittered as she stared at the two of them. John shifted in his seat, Sherlock was busy staring at the floor with his eyebrows furrowed.
The knock came again, more forcefully this time. Irene stood frozen only a moment before jerking to action, loosening Kate’s bonds and grabbing for her gun on the bedside table.
“I’m glad,” he says, smiling in his usual way.
