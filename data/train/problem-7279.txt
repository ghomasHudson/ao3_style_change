I think that’s true. You have superpowers, and you decide how you use them, if you use them. You’re responsible for your actions, the choices you make as spiderman. But you’re not even 18. You’re still a child and learning about the world in a whacked sense. Sure you have responsibility of your powers but you’re also responsible for how you handle what responsibilities you take on

“Dunno,” Tony shrugs, twisting the screwdriver between his fingers. “Just seems like the kinda thing that people would care about.”
“Steve Rogers, you are treating me like your personal secretary,” she huffs. “You can thank her yourself--”
Tony frowns, and lifts his left dark braceleted wrist in response. “That’s kinda rude to ask, isn’t it?”
Once the bells have started ringing, urging everyone to get up and when he’s able to get out of bed, Steve walks around headquarters. But everywhere he turns, eyes full of pity meet his and that’s what snaps Steve: it’s the pitying looks of his commander, and the courtesy of the soldiers and the agents of the SSR, and the barracks themselves that makes him leave.
Steve’s heart aches in his chest. After his and Bucky’s conversation, he had allowed himself to imagine a life with her. It would have been nice. Maybe not the stuff of epics, but nice regardless. He wonders idly if they would have made it.
right in front of him. He can’t help but stare, his eyes huge.
the story of Joanna and the Mark would be what his brain decides to focus on in his time of trouble. He almost laughs.
“You just tell your dad that Steve says you can play with the toy. If he argues, just tell him…” The small smile on Cap’s face grows bigger, and he breathes out a laugh. “Tell him I said not to fondue around - he’ll understand.”
Jarvis raises an expectant eyebrow, his mouth a slight line that’s different from Howard’s.
him?”
In elegant script, the sign reads ‘The Stork Club’.
Cap’s bright blue eyes shift from studying the picture to Anthony and widen. Anthony’s heart pounds hard in his chest.
“M’ too tired,” he says groggily, his brain fuzzy and his limbs heavy.
“I don’t
But he

is. He protests half-heartedly as Aunt Pegs takes his hand and leads him down the corridor to his bedroom, Howard trailing behind them. Anthony grumbles the entire time Aunt Pegs helps him get ready for bed.
“So what color’s your Swatch?” Rhodey asks Tony one day.
He reads on.
“I need you to take this,” he puts the toy in Anthony’s hand, curling his small fingers around it. “And I’m
“Get up, Tony,” urges the man, forcing Tony onto his feet.
Also, no your eyes are not lying: the chapter count has gone from five to six.
Aunt Peggy glances up and away from the magazine briefly to look at him, before flicking her eyes down to the magazine again. She whips her head up, her tired expression immediately clearing away into a relieved smile.
“I’ll tell you in the morning,” he promises, and Anthony can feel the rumbling of the words against his cheek. “I promise. For now, go to sleep.”
“He told me a bit about the - the dream,” she admits. Howard tilts his head towards her, listening. “The man sounded like
In fairness to himself, she doesn’t look anything like how he remembers her: cheerful and vibrant, larger than life. Instead, she’s grief-stricken. At the funeral her bright eyes were dim with sadness, her lips nude without her vermillion lipstick and the years of laugh lines apparent in the corners of her eyes and lips. She’s gotten smaller since he last saw her at Christmas; her face is pale and careworn, and her once-bright auburn hair has turned almost completely white, only a few strands of the original color peeking through.
Truthfully, Tony would rather dunk his head in a vat of polluted water than have to face Rhodey, but he knows he’s only delaying the inevitable.
It had only been a week or so before The Train had happened. They were camped out in one of the forests, and it had been late into the night, the two of them keeping watch while the rest of the Commandos were fast asleep five feet away from them.
The first Mass he’d ever attended was the first time in months that he’d been well enough to get out of bed. Once his Ma had finished taking his temperature and found him healthy for the day, she’d thrown her hands up in the air, and with a smile on her face, loudly proclaimed it an Easter miracle. She’d then promptly bundled him up for the cold and took him to the nearest church. It was a tall, muddy red building with gray spires and three dark arched doors in the front. When he and his Ma had stepped inside, his mouth fell open--the church was enormous and he felt smaller in comparison.
He’s only been in this room one other time, and that was only because Howard had wanted to show Anthony pictures of him and Captain America standing side-by-side, proud to see his son taking an interest in his old war buddy. It hadn’t been until Anthony had played with the toy that throws its shield that Howard had shouted and yelled and forbidden him from coming into the room ever again. Weeks later he had relented, saying Anthony could go into the room anytime he wanted, but Howard made it perfectly clear that he was never ever
Anthony whirls around, startled to see Jarvis in his pajamas standing behind him, staring down at him in confusion.
Anthony raises an eyebrow at her. She lifts her finger and points to something that he can’t see without turning his head.
The plane ride back to the SSR London branch was hell on everyone. It was long and turbulent, and Steve and the rest of the Commandos had been packed together as tight as sardines in a can, surrounding him on all sides. Even though his team had succeeded in apprehending Zola, the obvious loss to their party brought the mood down on an otherwise successful mission. No one spoke, everyone was withdrawn and introspective, Steve most of all.
is the only thought that manages to break itself through the haze of alcohol just before Tony pushes his face back into the toilet bowl and retches again.
Steve stares at the landscape around him.
, he thinks, the thought finally connecting.
They separate into groups and begin searching through the small town. Steve approaches a collapsed building, picking his way carefully through the blackened grass and fallen debris of plaster and brick. He can see through the building; there are no more walls left standing, and he can clearly make out a cemetery beyond the shattered remains. It dawns on Steve that this was a place of worship.
“Jarvis,” Anthony begins quietly, fidgeting under the covers. The butler hums in acknowledgement. “Why did Howard say that Captain America was my soulmate?”
“Seems strange that you’d pay attention to that
“Who - ” Aunt Peggy starts, drawing Anthony’s attention away from his father. She clears her throat, and then tries again. Her brown eyes are wide, and her skin has started to take on the same paleness as Howard’s. “Who told you that, Tony?”
“What the
“That, and the fact that you screamed ‘I’m Tony fucking Stark’ at the top of your lungs just before you puked on my shoes.”
He'd been lying, of course. But he
was what made Captain America special. It was his character that makes the difference.”
“Anthony,” Cap speaks softly, but in a voice that reminds Anthony of Aunt Pegs’ Serious Conversation Voice. “I’m gonna ask a favor from you.”
. There’s a war going on that he has to finish--that
“What other explanation is there?” Aunt Peggy asks, staring expectantly at him. “He couldn’t have known.
Then there’s that one other thing about the situation that sucks: challenged beliefs or not, he may be labelled as a genius for being nineteen with two Master’s degrees, but in the eyes of his peers he’d be
“Okay, Aunt Pegs,” Anthony says, nodding his head.

Steve took a deep breath, held it for a few seconds, and released it slowly. Everything he and Bucky owned was in that apartment. Bucky’s letters from his sisters and Ma, an aged portrait of Steve’s parents. Bucky’s small record collection that he’d been proud of. A photograph of Steve and Bucky as kids, and another from when they had gone to Coney Island just before Pearl Harbor. Steve’s sketchbooks filled with doodles and studies of Bucky, his Ma, and Granny McDonald. Bucky’s books, with their cracked spines and dog-eared, yellowed pages. Steve’s father’s watch. His mother’s soul band.
“Steve is Captain America.”
“I noticed on your records that you had appendicitis?” she asks, eyes flicking up to look at him.
“Can I see?” Anthony asks politely, with his hand still outstretched.
“I’m sorry, Peggy,” he whispers regretfully.
at his best friend. His shoulders are slumped low, umber brow pinched together, and his dark eyes disbelieving and sad; like all the fight’s gone out of him and he’s just a puppet with his strings cut.
“Jarvis?” Anthony prodes. “Jarvis, what if a soulmate
“Welcome back, Master Anthony,” Jarvis says as he gives him a tired smile.

something standing where he is.
Anthony frowns. He glances down at the Captain America toy in his lap. “Why not?”
A spike of grief, sharp and honed like a knife, rips through his heart, making a sob tear itself from his throat. Tony lowers his forehead onto the lip of the cool porcelain, squeezes his eyes tightly shut and tries to wrangle the fucker down because
“I - ”
The operating room is huge, and bright, and completely white. He can’t really see anything; the lights are shining right in his eyes and it hurts to look. Even with his eyes closed, he can feel the brightness prick painfully into his eyes. He can make out a sliver of each doctor’s face in between the surgical masks and the hats they wear. Beside him, there are a bunch of shiny silver instruments that remind Anthony of Howard’s car tools.

aw thor’s have an identity crisis
just before he pukes again.
Momma have told Anthony that he is not to get out of bed without someone to help him. Despite it being the middle of the night, Anthony has to go to the bathroom and he doesn’t want to wake anyone up. Besides, he’s
His own left wrist catches his eyes. He stares down at the blank space, studying the faint green veins that travel underneath his skin with no bright spot of color to obstruct it. Seeing the empty space makes Anthony's tummy feel funny, like it's swimming around in his chest. It’s like when he sees other kids with something he doesn't have.
“Mmmhmmm, like that, pet?”
cell phone user, not one of the techies who worked for him in R&D, or the suckups in the other departments. He was not going to let this opportunity go.
“Thank you, Master, this looks wonderful.” A pleased thrill settled in his brain when his Master responded.
Before coming down, he had put out the supplies. He had about three times as many needles as he thought he needed, and a whole box of gloves. And, he had the ribbon. Play piercing would be fun, but he was also going to make it a corset piercing. Still, first, he needed to disinfect his pet’s back. Again, he was glad for the reclining chair he had. It made it so he could position his pet and reach everywhere he needed to.
The night he decided to make the ‘Red Snapper en Papillote’ was a night when he was alone on the common floor. If he screwed up completely, he didn’t want to hear about it until the end of time. The problem came when the snapper came out of the parchment paper looking delicious. He wanted someone else’s opinion, and there was no one else around. Thor was in Asgard, Clint was at Coulson’s, Nat was on a mission somewhere, and Bruce was in India. Tony… Wait, Tony was in the Tower, working on a project. Maybe he’d appreciate some dinner.
Finally, after his pet was a shuddery, weepy mess of pleasure, Steve gave new instructions. “Okay, pet. You’ve done a very, very good job. Now, you need to stay on your stomach still, but you can move. You’re going to just lay here a bit while I do some things. Don’t worry, I’m not leaving you, I’m going to be right here. There’s just one more thing. Don’t come until I tell you to.” Steve smiled as he picked up a sketchbook and some colored pencils. He was going to let his pet just sit with the pinch for a while while he drew.
Steve managed to wait nearly a week before his next experiment in cooking. It didn’t do anything to reduce how much he noticed Tony, because apparently Tony took his bringing food as an open invitation for meals together whenever Tony wanted to try something. It led to some really exciting food that he was absolutely not ready to attempt. (Teppanyaki was incredibly impressive, but he was absolutely not ready for the showmanship apparently required. He didn’t want to know if the serum would regrow a missing finger.) It also led to him being better able to function through his embarrassment, even if Tony did his best to make him blush on a regular basis. So, with all that, he decided he was ready for another food attempt. (He was going to ignore the one that failed. No one knew about that one, other than JARVIS, who had been sworn to secrecy.)
Revelling on that edge, he managed to get out some coherent words. “Thank you Master, thank you, thank you.”
Soon, he was finished, and it was time to start the fun. This would be almost meditative for him as he focused putting the needles in perfectly as his pet relaxed into the pain. It would be sharper than the usual kind of pain they used, so Steve hoped the reality would be everything his pet wanted. Steve took a deep breath and focused. With gloved hands, he carefully took one of the sterile needles and inserted it at the first marker dot. As the needle pricked the skin, his pet let out a sound that could only be called a please whine.
“Of course, pet.” Steve carefully locked the collar into place around his pet’s neck.
“You, me, and Brazilian food tomorrow. You’ll love it.” Tony grinned at him, and Steve felt his mouth turning up further without his input.
Tony felt the chair adjusting, and he knew what it was going to be. Soon, the hole in the facerest was right over his Master’s cock. His mouth was open, a Pavlovian response, before he even had time to think about it, and soon that delicious weight was on his tongue. It was perfect. There was pinpricks of pain in his back sending him deeper and deeper, and a cock for him to focus on. Then words in his ears.
“Nice one, Winghead!” Apparently with a brand new nickname. Well, at least that was completely normal. Banter was good. Banter was always good. When he was bantering with Tony, the world fell away and didn’t matter as much. He just hoped that bantering with him relieved the same pressure on Tony’s shoulders. Still, the banter didn’t completely remove the stress of Tony trying one of his dishes. Steve held his breath as Tony took his first bite.
When his collar clicked into place, Tony started falling into his floaty place. His Master was taking charge and he could relax. Still, he didn’t know what was coming. There were a lot of things on their mutual want list, several of which they had been waiting on until they had time, and he had let his Master pick the one for this break. The anticipation was delicious, but it was also interfering a bit with getting into his floaty space. Still, he was sure with all the wait, he’d fall there quick once he knew the plan.
“Hi Tony. Join me for dinner?”
Steve loved bookstores. He had always loved libraries, but now he had the money to take books home and
. He wanted Tony’s reaction to his food. More than that, he really, truly, desperately wanted Tony to like it. He wasn’t going to think about that, either.
“Who is this?”
Steve felt his face heat. Quickly, he looked down at his plate so as to avoid Tony’s gaze. He was absolutely willing to keep providing food to Tony, but he wasn’t ready to tell himself what that meant, much less so his dining companion.
“Think he’d like some snapper?”
“I hate to ask, but please, please keep talking. Tell me anything. Tell me about this phone, just keep talking.”
“Damn, Capybara! This is delicious. Looks like your food isn’t just a one trick pony.” Steve blushed and Tony laughed.
“Sir, are you okay?” Tony had to say something when the curses tapered off and all he heard was the ragged breathing.
“Well, then, I’m always down to experiment, let’s dig in!” Suiting actions to words, Tony took a bite. At the sound Tony made, Steve quickly sat down to take his own bite, hiding his reaction to the sound. Maybe he would have to think about it. But, that was a problem for future-Steve. Now-Steve had just taken a bite, and the fish was
This time it was Steve’s turn to laugh.
And the last thought Steve had before falling asleep was how well they fit together. Maybe it was time to think about more permanent jewelry.
Finally everything was set. He gently coaxed Tony up and helped him walk over to the tub. Times like these he wished he was big enough to carry his pet over to the tub, but he would still do his best. Now it was time to relax and drink water and eat some fruit. After helping Tony into the tub, he slid in behind him and grabbed one of the water bottles.
Tony let out a deep sigh. “They’re all brainless. I dread to see what they come up with while I’m on vacation, but after that, I need the break.” Steve saw his eyes flicker down near the plate. “And I see plans are still in place. Perfect.”
“You deserve it, pet. Let me take care of you. Now just strip and hop up here, and I’ll get you ready.”
“Everything is fine. Tony, would you do me the honor of making this a date?” Steve gulped.
“I made something special. Tony, I’d… I’d like this to…” Steve swallowed. He didn’t realize how hard it would be to get the words out for something he decided he desperately wanted.
“Thank you, Tony. I really appreciate it. At least I know you’re not going to get in trouble with your boss for talking with me for so long!”
Tony followed his Master down the stairs, into the room that they used for their play. Again, like always when the scene was going to be incredibly complicated, the room was a bit rearranged. At first, he wasn’t sure what it was going to be, there was just the reclining chair, the one that let him lay down and give his Master access all over. It was really a cross between a dentist’s chair and a massage table, except even more manueverable. Then he saw the smaller table, with the needles. A shiver ran down his spine in anticipation. Tony had actually never tried this, but he had wanted to for so long. His Master was truly giving him a treat today.
“Okay, sir, I first need to ask, are you calling from the smartphone in question?” Bless his eidetic memory. He didn’t know why he needed to ask, surely people wouldn’t call in for help for devices they were talking on, but it was in the manual.
Tony filled with pride. He’d done a good job, now he would get his Master to come. The angle made it so he had no control over the depth of his Master’s cock, but he could still use his tongue to pleasure his Master. As he swallowed down on the cock in his throat, his tongue swirled. He wanted to make sure everything was just as perfect for his Master as the pain had been for him. So Tony lost himself in the taste and feel of his Master, not tracking time, until the taste of his Master’s come exploded on his tongue. Finally, with that, his own cock shuddered and stuttered, his climax wonderful, but secondary to everything else going on.
. Tony had all the books he could possibly want in electronic format, but there was nothing quite like flipping through a book and seeing what was there. This time, though, he was on a mission. Clint had found out he’d only been to the little convenience store near him and decided to take him to a big grocery store. There had been so many different items and ingredients! And now, his stomach could handle them all, and there wasn’t wartime rationing. Hence the mission- cookbooks.
“Capsicle! That smells wonderful!” Tony’s voice sounded truly happy to see him. Steve didn’t really have any doubts given the time they spent together, but each time it was still a relief. He wanted to spend time with Tony, so it was wonderful that Tony wanted to do the same.
“Thank you, ma’am. I’ll definitely give this one a try.” With that, he took the book up to the checkstand.
Again, the conversation was light through dinner, and Steve was gratified to see Tony soaking up the sauce with his bread. After letting the warmth of Tony’s enjoyment flow through him, he lost himself in their discussion. It was only when Tony let out a yawn despite the coffee he had been drinking that Steve realized they had been talking for hours.
Upon arriving at the cookbook section, Steve blanched a little. The selection was huge, and he didn’t even know where to start. There was a cookbook for every country he had heard of, plus some for barbeque, for baking, for various themes, and titles he couldn’t even figure out the meaning of. Fortunately for him, as he was looking at various titles, someone standing nearby noticed.
Soon enough, Tony finished eating. He picked up the collar and kneeled down in front of Steve, holding it up. “Please, Master?”
“No, I’m not. I would have, but Bucky had to call Apple for help this one time, and they were so condescending even though he didn’t have another phone to use. But I’m borrowing his, so I’m good.”
Tony moaned as he was given permission to move. The pain had sent him so deep down that his rock hard cock had been at one remove, until he was reminded about it by the ability to get friction against it, finally. But every time he thrust against the chair he was it, it pulled his back. The pain was absolutely exquisite, but it was distracting from him getting a rhythm. That might have been actually all to the good. He wasn’t allowed to come, and after the time taken to pierce and decorate his back, he was ready to go off as soon as he had permission. But while it felt good, the irregularity of the pain versus the friction kept him just on the edge perfectly.
“Sorry, just got on shift. How can I help you, sir?” He’d never worked a phone line a day in his life, but he had read the manuals for the call center. How hard could it be? (He was very, very lucky in the customer he got. He never learned how hard it could be.)
That night, Steve had a lot of thinking to do. When morning came, he hadn’t come to any conclusions, but he kept thinking. He did so as he and Tony went out to dinner together, and as he expanded his horizons more with his own cooking and enjoying it in Tony’s workshop. Finally, he reached a conclusion, and, as it had worked so well before, he decided on a new menu. This one, the picture in the book looked gorgeous. Steak with papaya salad was the recipe.
Soon, but not soon enough for Steve’s burning face, the plates were empty. “Here, let me take these and you can get back to work.” Steve quickly fled before Tony could question him.
Steve watched his pet relax. He was hoping that would be the result, but this was new, and he was worried that once it became real rather than just words on a page, or even pictures on the internet, it wouldn’t have the appeal. But, from the way his pet absolutely melted into the reclining chair, face down, he knew it was a good choice.
Finally, Steve was all set. “Thank you so much… wait, you never told me your name!”
“Sorry. We can forget this-” Steve did his best to keep the disappointment out of his voice until he was interrupted.
“Sir has no allergies and has enjoyed snapper in the past, though I do not believe the combination with couscous is one he has had before.” JARVIS’s voice came through the speakers again.
“No, wait!” Tony lunged towards Steve, then settled himself back in his chair. “I don’t want to forget this,” Steve’s heart sunk even further. Had he lost a friend by taking a risk? “I want this to be a date.”
Then it got more so. “Okay, pet. Let’s get you moved a bit.”
This time, Steve made chicken. It had been a bit of a luxury growing up, so it felt like a treat, but it was also seen as a budget ingredient now, so if it went wrong, it wouldn’t be a waste. Also, the seasoning was completely unfamiliar, being that it was port and mustard. Whole grain mustard. He’d had creamy mustard on hot dogs at Coney Island, and he’d had some cabbage with mustard seed before as a seasoning, but a mustard spread with whole seeds? That was a new experience. At least he had cut chickens before. Butterflying was not the typical way he had cut them, but he knew where the bones were and the instructions were clear enough for him to follow. The recipe hadn’t suggested any side dishes, so he decided to take advantage of all the vegetables available all year, and put together a nice salad. Then, he got some good, crusty bread. There was clearly meant to be a sauce when all was said and done, and good bread soaked up sauce wonderfully.
He stares at the large map, so big that takes up the entire wall across from his seat, as the words are tossed around him. He glances down at the photographs scattered around the table that their intelligence agents were able to gather. Mostly he just watches the familiar faces of the people he cares about gathered around him, thoughts and plans swirling around in his head; each one he turns over to examine before letting them go. He focuses his attention back to his team: Howard Stark, the Colonel, and Agent Carter.
I’m in the splash zone,” Funny Guy replies, his clothes rustling as he adjusts his seated position beside Tony. If he were in the right frame of mind, Tony would roll his eyes and have a witty come-back already on the tip of his tongue. “The first time, you puked on my shoes.”

“Anthony, that’s enough,” Howard warns harshly from the doorway of his son’s bedroom.
“What’s the difference?” Howard scoffs. “They’re one and the same.”
“But I don’t

he has to keep picking up the shield and charge ahead no matter how many times he’s been knocked down.
He didn’t sleep that night, either--not that he was expecting to.
“Howard,” Aunt Pegs says, turning her head to regard his father. Her voice is soothing and encouraging. “Why don’t you go, and leave Anthony to me?”
He huffs a laugh. “What’ver you say,” Tony says groggily, shifting his legs underneath him into a more comfortable position. The guy’s hovering beside him, hands close but not touching him.
Jarvis went to all the trouble of getting everything ready: from decorating for the party, arranging for Anthony’s favorite foods to be prepared, to picking up Aunt Pegs from the airport -
“Dun’ wanna,” Tony protests lamely.
The doctor nods with finality and leaves. A second later, Rhodey comes through. Tony fights the very strong urge to fling himself out of the hospital window, and stays resting against the pillows.

“What happens if they don’t take it out?” Anthony asks, curious, as he stares up at her.
“Yes, please,” he answers, and she hands him one. “Thank you.” She gives him one last smile before the phone rings at her desk and she leaves him alone. Anthony unwraps the cherry red candy and sticks it in his mouth.
Without another word, Steve headed down to the barracks.
It occurs to Steve that he was wrong before. The honest truth is that his friend,
“No,” Johnson croaked through his tears, shaking his head, his hair scraping against the poor excuse for a pillow. He screwed his eyes shut. “But I’m reliving the worst kind of pain.”
that you’re alright, we will have your party.” Her tone doesn’t allow argument, even as Jarvis speaks into the phone behind her.
He’s never seen The Stork Club in the light of day before, but under the circumstances he’s understanding that it isn’t up to its usual par. It’s dusty and grimy and black, the insides of the building spilling out onto the cobbled street, looking mangled and dejected in the light. He can still smell the smoke from the bomb that had landed a week ago. Outside, the sky of London is a dreary gray smudged with black; it always seems to get that way after a bombing, no matter what part of Europe he’s in.
“They’ll have each other,” Bucky says simply, squeezing Steve’s shoulder tightly. “It’s enough.”

anything in what feels like ages, that he dives into it headfirst: letting the grief wash over him in waves and at last feeling its effects on his face like a waterfall.
He sniffles once before speaking. “Doctor Erskine said that the serum wouldn’t just affect my muscles,” he says, and his voice sounds rough and hoarse even to his own ears. “It would affect my cells, create a protective system of regeneration and healing.” He sounds like he’s reciting a fact to her: detached and lifeless, as though the information doesn’t hold any value to him.
His hands still, and he stares at Anthony with wide eyes. He sits slowly on the edge of Anthony’s bed, and his shoulders tense up. He’s quiet for what feels like a long time.
to be a mistake. Some anesthetic-induced dream! A hallucination, maybe!”
Anthony’s not worried, though: he knows that his brain is a little tired, but once he wakes up, it’ll be in proper working order. In the meantime, he wriggles his toes experimentally, pleased that
Anthony’s eyes focus on Jarvis at the sink as he gets ready to clean the dirty dishes from lunch. The sun streams in from the small kitchen window, its rays licking the floral curtains and lighting up Jarvis’s face with a golden glow. Jarvis’s wristwatch is at his side on the red brick counter and his shirt sleeves are rolled up. But there’s a dark spot on his butler’s wrist he’s never seen before.
It doesn’t matter now.

His eyes widen, and his mouth drops open in shock.
“Sir, you have to stop talking now,” the doctor whispered, leaning over Johnson so the soldier could hear him, the warning clear in his voice.
Tony’s best friend stands in the corner, the flourescent light of the room unflattering on his skin. His chiseled arms are at his sides, his olive green T-shirt stretching the width of his shoulders, jaw tense, and staring at Tony with hard, accusatory eyes.

“Yeah, champ, don’t do that again,” Howard says with a chuckle, reaching over and giving Anthony’s hair a tussle that makes him cringe at the contact. “Had to cancel a very important meeting because of you. Obadiah won’t be too happy about that.”
Anthony peeks into the keyhole of the door. His father stands with his back to his aunt, a glass of his special drink in one hand. At the sight of it, Anthony immediately remembers the hard slap Howard gave his cheek after drinking a few glasses of the stuff. He cringes, and shifts, biting his lip to keep from crying out for his aunt.

@SpiderMAN

SCRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEE NOOOO U FUCKIN DOOOONNNTTTTTT
he put chili in a test tube, which was apparently the Wrong Thing To Do.
thor has no idea how to do it so probs gonna ask tony for advice. probably not the best idea he’s ever had
what is going on
would you like visual images, video files or text format?
we could always talk about how gay we are in newly renamed christ moose and see if they get the hint?? either that or we lowkey drop hints that they should all be together and gay
the betrayal. F to thor’s beans
honestly same. That being said. I need maintenance on my arm and youd probably not help it. You wrapped it in tinsel the other day
sat with tony eating ice cream beause hes sad and crying and hes told me that steve just needs to get his head around this shit
how am I more up to date on American internet slang than you?
@SpiderMAN
it’s not really something I can explain?

fiiinneee we’ll watch both
wish I could visit asgard
fourth was like. bucky
I think he did
[11:12 pm]
he is quite literally named after the norse trickster god.
so I joked and told bruce that he wants that to happen to him but with thor and he fucking broke the wall
@hawkguy

agreed.
am I not allowed to be nice when my friends are sad?
@thorsrevengers

my uncle ben used to say with great power comes great responsibility
@pixelboik
whoops voice note thingie was on

if this is some way of trying to get me to reveal who they are you're sorely msitaken. i had about 9 cups of coffee before thor attacked me
@hawkguy
Everything, Clint. Everything.
hope youre ok dood.
also did they give u meds?
this dude is steeb's friend and hes going to legit kill me.
hes smart enough to intern at stark industries but not smart enough to make his own chain mail
There were 4 Revengers. We’re getting more now that @CaptnAmerica ended the A-Team. Evil man.

✓ @irnman
i take it that means irl private convo, im omw
so, T'Challa, how do you feel about joinging Christ, moose?
you didn't see that coming?
what do u see of bruce?
because he cannot keep a secret, assuming this is about setting up thor and bruce because theyre pining white boys
same clint
do you even know what that means?
god I feel bad for fucky
idk what else u expected. Go run or something might clear ur head.
Chat: Fuck

Chat: QuickWinterHawk

Bucky? Are you OK?

@pietromaximov
not with that attitude he wont
the one that’s not me
Bc the real fans are the ones who r closest to u
oh and I could maybe introduce u to mj n ned??

honestl fuck spelling all these words are made up anyway
im gonna brek someones face lmao
oh no the gay bear n twink r arguing again @SpiderMAN
fucking stony
i thought i was queer before
is there more incriminating evidence than just that?

[3:44 am]
I guess I’ll let that pass. Just this once.
omgf SWH is canon
SICK FAM
im already traumatised by what clint showed me
i completely misread the intention of the word naughty.
im pixelated dust sometimes in the form of a “boy” but im allegedly an adult
peter? Yeah. Something to do with bioengineering.
Not in the slightest.

@TheVision
psychology lessons are so great -_-
I have no clue as to whether im gonna kill u for that or not

SNORING
Having a crisis about how your mom fucked a celery and then you popped out is a perfectly good conversation to have at almost 2 in the morning.
I will never find peace.
what even the fuck
literally no one cares
PARTY GUSY
*true
I voted for me too thanks u gay little twink
