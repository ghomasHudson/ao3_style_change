The next day the children barely travelled at all. Mary wanted to give her legs a chance to rest, though they were running out of food again and would need to get some more soon. She fed her brothers and herself with less food and more grace, to make it last a little longer. She checked the map, trying to guess were they were, and decided to try and find the next town in the map.
“Castiel,” Nithael hesitated for a moment as he regarded his brother, “we were wondering… My wings… The boy fixed them. And yours are looking better too, I assume they’re helping you in that matter too… We will protect your children no matter what you decide but- some of the angels are wondering if your children would be willing to heal their wings.”
Gabriel smirks playfully, never missing a chance to embarrass his brother. “Of course I did. I approve, go get deflowered, baby bro. Satan would want you to.”
“I just-” Dean swallows. He feels a pressure on his chest, a ball of feelings; anticipation, nerves, eagerness, now sexual attraction too, affection, fear… “Dude, you’ve got a chick waiting for your downstairs,” he says instead of what he really wants to talk about, which is a hopeless and honest
He doesn’t mean to defend Dean but he truly dislikes Dick way more than he could ever dislike Dean. He antagonizes the newcomer for ethical reasons only, to protect the town, not because there’s really something truly bad about him.
Castiel rolled his eyes at the not very subtle hint of accusation in Sam’s words, then run a hand through his hair.
Dean struggled even through dinner to stay awake. Sam’s vegetable pie wasn’t half bad, but again, he’d never admit to that, he even blamed the good taste as an illusion from his lack of attention. He really wanted to fight his brain and stay awake, specially as his angel followed him back into his- no,
As always, any feedback, suggestions, thoughts, theories and general comments are welcomed and appreciated.
"Lucifer was set free in their universe. He's on to them. If you send them back, they're as good as dead."
"-and though we're not exclusive, I thought I should ask you before sleeping with any of your friends. You know, out of courtesy. Besides, she doesn't seem like the type who likes to submit and that's what I want right now."
Castiel audibly gasps and meets his eyes. He seems surprised again to be the receiver of those words, and Dean will never get it because there’s no one more worthy of attention and love than Cas.
“Seir?” Cas repeats. He can’t help but feel betrayed by his own familiar who ran off to rat him out with his brother. “I’m not in trouble, Gabriel.”
“Dean, lay her on the ground,” Castiel ordered as he knelt on the floor. “Everyone, back off, please.”
. Before the angel has time to react, Dean fists the front of his goddamn, ridiculously charming trench-coat and pulls him in into a rather forced kiss. It has to be that way, it can't be sweet and tender, Dean doesn't have time to think. If he thinks, he'll stop, his brain must not be allowed time to catch up if he wants to see this through. And fuck, he wants to see this through now that he's opened this door.
, that was the rule. A macho-man doesn’t love other men. And still, he’d never tell another man he was less of a man simply because he loved another man.
Benny chews his lip, thinking for a moment, before he smiles, amused with himself, and says, “never have I ever walked in on my parents doing it.”
In unison they all move, jumping backwards to give Cas space while Dean helps him lay down on the floor, quickly applying pressure on the wound. Blood is gushing out at an alarming rate already, the cut is deep and must have torn something important. Castiel stares down at his stomach in shock, hands trembling just above Dean’s.
him. He looks slightly ashamed of himself for completely forgetting about the fact that they are supposed to
They turn right and it’s 6 steps to the stairs. 15 steps down the stairs and 3 short ones to the front door which is right in front of the stairs. Dean lets his friend feel the door until he finds the doorknob and pulls the door open. They take 6 steps from the door, crossing the house’s short front yard, until they reach the sidewalk. They turn left, take 12 more steps. Left once more, 8 steps across Dean’s front yard, and then Cas is reaching blindly for Dean’s door. There’s a faint smile on his lips, the first one since he woke up from the surgery.
, Dean scolded himself, cheeks burning red with embarrassment and anger at himself. He was so goddamn relieved that it was still dark in the room. What if Cas
“Dean will be back in a couple of minutes,” Bobby speaks from his spot on the door. He’s leaning against the frame, looking down at his feet- that's as much privacy as he can give Castiel while he is charge of looking after him. “Why don't you try to get some sleep?”

get to spend together, but instead he puts on a brave face and shows support, like a good friend would. Like a good boyfriend would.
“You’re going to love my dad’s chicken, it’s like the one thing he’s really good at,” Dean tells him enthusiastically while Cas shoves his things back into his backpack.
“Hmm, can you give me a minute?” he asks in a voice that tries to sound casual but probably doesn’t.
“He watched Cas sleeping half the way here with a dumb smile on his face… It was so gross,” Bela tells him, physically cringing like she's recalling something terrible she had to endure.
It takes everything in him to remain silent and still, to be patient and not interrupt her. Nervously he fidgets with the hem of his shirt, twisting it over and over again in his fingers like she’s not going to notice if he channels his anxiety like that.

“Did you miss my voice, son?” he spoke softly, then stood up and left the room to avoid waking the other children. He kept sweet talking his son until he ran into Sam in the kitchen.
Yeah, he's finally beginning to agree with people there. Bela was trouble, more than he could handle for sure. If Sam could only see him right now… He’s going to give him an earful…
The young woman goes back to her work and leaves Cas alone with the newspaper. He reads through it again and again, and swallows around his tears. The text is cheesy, and undoubtedly Dean’s brain-child. The mere thought that the other man did this, that he expressed to the world so openly and publicly that they will spend the rest of their lives together, keeps Cas jittery and unfocused.
to be like that by John, all his idols were like that, the other men and fellow hunters in his life had been like that. Women, he had to like
The more this presence screws with him, the more he gets that itch inside of him that is a telltale sign that he is close to losing his cool but he makes an effort to keep his emotions in check considering this place is too public to risk losing control and having his powers get loose. He doesn’t want to hurt anyone and he’s not going to let this presence get to him and force his hand.
Castiel darts to the window, moving the curtains to the side. Indeed, parked just outside the gates, is Dean’s car. Before he has the time to even react, Benny is urging him away from the window by the shoulders, pushing him towards the stairs.
Dean shakes his head and bites his lip so hard he almost draws blood. He hates being dragged into drama and the constant spotlight he lives under.
Gabriel shakes his head. “He stays. I can do more for him than any doctor. Besides we can’t, how the fuck are we going to explain more stabs that magically appear on him?”
Feeling already full, he pushes his chair back and gets up. When he grabs the plate and walks over to the kitchen to wash it, he hears Benny following him to the other room. Dean doesn’t say anything, hoping Benny will change the conversation or go to bed. The last thing he needs is to create a web of lies he
Charlie's presence doesn't do anything but make Dean even more restless. He feels the weight of his juicy secret pressing down his shoulders and fears she's going to be able to tell he is hiding something, and the thing is Dean both wishes he could talk to someone about it and he doesn’t ever want anyone to find out. The library is dead quiet, even more so on a damn Saturday afternoon, and for the first time the silence is more annoying than helpful. Dean's alone with his thoughts, his memories and doubts, and his voice inside his head is too loud in the silent hall to allow him to concentrate in his studies. How is he supposed to concentrate in math and other boring stuff when the memory of Castiel looking down at him in triumph with his dick out is burnt forever into Dean's eyes?
While Dean presses the wet towel over the wounded area again, Sam starts saying the healing spell so quickly it’s like he’s not even stopping to breathe in between words. Dean doesn’t know what good it’ll do if Cas chokes to death, but it’s the only thing they can help with. However the blood soaks his hands, seeping through his fingers despite Sam’s attempts to stop the bleeding.  Cas claws at his throat, leaving long scratch marks. His eyes start to close intermittently, he fights to keep them open, but he’s running out of air and the blood loss makes him dizzy. It’s too much to handle at once. He attempts to call Dean’s name but he can’t, he can’t ask for help. His hands feel heavy, oh so heavy.
“I know,” Balthazar said with a tone that was uncharacteristically gentle. “Someone has to stop Raphael, I
Everything was going well, until they decided it was better to head back to the bunker to get some lunch ready before Dean had the chance to start preparing hamburgers. They picked up the books and walked to the librarian’s desk to get permission to take the books home with them. Mary was telling Sam where she had left off with geography at school when she looked up and found her aunt looking down at her with a bright smile.
“Okay, alright, keep walking, Roman, the principal’s just around the corner,” he interjects just in time to stop them from fighting, putting a hand in Dick’s chest without any trepidation at all and urging him away. “You don’t want to get suspended and miss your next match, do ya?”
. There were so many things that felt so different to what he was used to; curves replaced by sharp edges, a bulge between Cas’ legs to make up for lack of breasts, rough stubble brushing against his own… he should be terrified to be so into it, maybe even disgusted, but he's too far gone to care. He likes it, he likes the way Cas feels under him and the taste he leaves in Dean’s mouth, the clean smell of him mixed with something that reminds him of wet grass in the forest after rain. He likes that Cas thinks he's beautiful, the way he smiled so kindly and genuinely happy for him while he'd watched Dean laugh.
He teases Cas about his obsession with plants but he likes the way the apartment smells like flowers. Castiel has the habit of leaving flowers even in Dean’s room so it smells really nice all the time. It’s a great change from the fire department.
“Don’t lie to me, Castiel. Listen, if you wanna stick around we’ve got to set some ground rules, alright? First of all, no more watching me sleep.”
Dean chokes on his beer and coughs a couple of times. He snaps his head around, alarmed. "How'd you know that?"
“Is it really that bad?” Castiel asks, tilting his head to the side, confused; in his opinion, it is pretty damn good.
As Bela looks around their living-room, she’s not quick enough to hide the slight expression of disdain on her face before he sees it. A pang of embarrassment stirs his stomach and his eyes skim around the room as well to study it as if he’s also seeing it for the first time. It looks fine…
So he smiled at Dean, encouraging the man to let go of his troubles for a little while, placing a hand on his shoulder and leading him through the aisles of products. The touch made Dean blush but it somehow helped him relax; at least if the kids were gone, he wouldn’t be alone to drown in his misery. Cas would be there, like he usually was when Dean needed him, to understand and share his pain, and this time he’d
“Dean,” Mary continues, reaching out to touch his knee gently, “we have no idea when you started dating, when your first kiss happened or how, that you were looking into buying a house or that you even wanted kids in the first place. Honey, we would have liked to know that.”
Castiel shakes his head. “No time, I need to go soon. I promise to stop you if I see someone coming. Now come on, I want
“You’re up again!” he smiled broadly and ran to the bed. Rowena stood still, watching the children carefully. She didn’t want to scare Mary again. Baltz saw the way Mary’s grace was preparing to attack, and he did his best to lift his wings as a barrier between the two females. “No, Mary, it’s okay, she’s my friend!”
of them, and some extra items; more food, some toys for Baltz, some extra clothes for the kids and for Cas… In comfortable silence they waited in line to pay for their items. The angel put their items in front of the cashier, his fingers gently brushing against Dean’s as the man passed them on, and he could swear Dean was enjoying his touch. There was even the faintest of smiled in his lips. An old woman with a gentle smile who eyed them curiously as she worked the items one by one, adding them to the list of things they needed to pay for. God blessed fake credit cards.
passages but rituals one needs to undertake. He’d have to create spells and guess and try an unknown amount of times before succeeding…
Dean doesn’t wake up for another 5 hours. Bela fantasizes that he gets pronounced dead and she can finally go back to the apartment and sleep, it’s goddamn passed 3 a.m., but no, Dean decides that’s the best moment to wake up. Cas sneaks in to see him… for another whole hour.
Baltz went on trying to explain how that worked and after the birthday boy had had enough desserts to keep him full for the rest of the day, they silently made their way to the small local cinema. There weren’t many movies to choose from but he didn't care, he was having a great time strolling through the town with his loved ones. The children sat on either side of their dad, then Cas sat next to Mary with Dean in his other side, the man clutching his hand like his life depended on it, while Sam sat in the far corner by his brother’s side. The girl studied carefully her papa’s hard poker face, then slowly went to grab his hand. He nearly jumped at the touch, then turned his hand around to interlock their fingers as he looked down at her. He looked sad, he wasn’t good at hiding it, but Mary said nothing, just turned her head around and pretended to pay attention on the movie, just like most of them did.
Sam nods and grabs the book. He quickly begins to read the Latin words, familiarizing himself with them.
Then suddenly Castiel stops moving altogether, passing out from the shock, his eyes roll back into his skull. He goes pale so fast it’s scary. Blood stains Charlie’s and Benny’s jeans as the pool underneath Cas becomes wider.
In the end, he would be losing so much more than just his magic but then again breaking the peace treaty was always meant to have severe consequences, he knew that. When he closed the doors he did not have time to stop and mourn what he’d lose, there was only an urgent need to protect his loved ones and stop anyone else from taking his place, but now he has to make a choice his heart breaks as he accepts what he’ll be giving up. With tears in his eyes, he sets his jaw tightly and averts his eyes, not wanting Death to see him cry. He knows what he’s going to choose but it doesn’t make it any easier.
Trying not blush like a schoolgirl, he obeys. A bet is a bet and Dean Winchester is no coward, he’s a man of his word and he won’t back down, not even from this.
Castiel thinks he sees his brother’s eyes water before he closes them and leans back on the chair. It’s a few seconds before he opens them again.
He’s afraid, he can admit that to himself if not to anyone else. He’s afraid of daring and then having things take a turn for the worse because everything is going well and years of experience say that’s
“Maybe he just doesn’t like it?” Dean speculates, moving his pasta from side to side with his fork. It’s one of the worst things he’s ever had. “Honestly, Cas, I am thankful you invited me to dinner but maybe next time I should cook.”
Cas nods and moves quickly, lifting the child in his arms. The building makes this deep, croaking noise. Dean knows it can’t be good but he doesn’t need to think of an escape plan because Castiel reaches for his hand and they’re gone. There’s this extremely unpleasant feeling in his gut but when Dean opens his eyes less than a second later, they’re outside in the back alley, safe from the fire (although Dean would like to move away from the building nonetheless in case there’s an explosion).
“First of all, it isn't more than you deserve because I know you and you’re a great person… but things like what? Try to explain it to me, Dean, maybe I can help you.”
“We’re going to bed?” Dean whispers in the dark. He sounds surprised, so Cas opens his eyes but all he can see is his boyfriend’s silhouette next to him.
come into play. He considers some things though, in his mind he balances the pros and the cons and he wonders if he should give in a little. Like Gabriel had said, to make mistakes and live a little, be a witch, a real witch, worthy of Hell.
bad? She could only think of a couple of supernatural creatures that would cause an angel to take such drastic measures, and she didn’t like the options very much. If the kids came through some kind of portal to this universe, so could another big bad.
“I’m sorry,” Mary blurted out, looking down too with shame. “I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, papa. I… I was thinking, I can help you heal. I can feed you my grace.”
Dean ducks his head in an attempt to kiss Castiel, but he doesn't let him, moving his head away so that Dean only gets access to his neck. Castiel places both hands at either side of Dean's hips and starts to lead Dean's movements, looking at him straight in the eyes as their erections brush against each other.

Cas frowns and narrows his eyes at him, waiting for an explanation. It’s Dean’s time to blush as he’s under the scrutiny of those piercing blue eyes. He doesn’t know why but he feels compelled to tell Castiel something he rarely ever shares with people. Maybe it’s just the way Cas looks at him, like he can’t help but be attracted to him even if he’s set on not being friends. Maybe Dean hopes something will happen between them even if Cas keeps rejecting him. Perhaps Sam
“I kissed you because I like you and I thought we could get along, man. I looked past your secrets and your fucking mysteries and the way weird shit happens around you all the time because I
wondering when Dean uses that or, most importantly, what he looks like when he does, then proceeds to steal all of Dean’s boxers and replaces them with lace panties for women. He puts the original underwear in a bag and hides it under his bed.
Dean stops himself before he finishes the sentence, but Castiel can read the question which is plastered in his face;
Just when he thought they were moving past their previous awkwardness into the friend zone, Inias was just apparently getting ready to give it another go. As usual, Cas has read the situation completely wrong. Castiel can hardly blame him; it’s not like there are a lot of other boys their age Inias can pick from but why,
Dinner was an awkward affair. Castiel and Dean both sat in opposite ends of the table as a tense silence settled around the room. Rowena exchanged quizzical look with Sam, the man shrugging as he went over the events of the day in his head, wondering what he’d missed. Sure, he'd had an argument with Dean, but what was up with Cas? He'd been weird ever since they'd return from their supply run. Trust Dean to fuck things up in such a short amount of time. Even the kids could tell something was up, Mary's eyes flickering between her parents as a concerned frown settled in her face. Cas busied himself with the baby and the always messy task that was feeding him. The kid had grown too used to feeding on grace and was barely having any solids willingly. Dean stole glances in their direction from time to time, but other than that he focused his attention almost entirely in the rest of his children.
“Good morning to you too, bitch,” Dean mumbled as he sat down on a chair to feed Zep more comfortably.
“When did this happen, Dean? Why didn’t you tell us? Did you press charges? Isn’t that illegal or something?” John asks so fast he stumbles in his own tongue.
Dean’s heart was racing with newfound nerves. He closed his eyes and placed his forehead against Castiel’s. Dying was never easy, he’d done literally over a hundred times and it never got easy. At least this time, he knew he didn’t want to come back, not if Cas wasn’t going to be there for him.
The girls had a whole crew of people moving shit around while he was upstairs, just to fuck with him, to make him look stupid. They must be watching from the windows, studying his reaction and every move, laughing at him. He pulls his hand away, convincing himself that if he touches it to confirm whether it’s real or not, then the girls at winning their prank and they’re gonna succeed at making him look like a fucking moron. That’s why he doesn’t touch the apple, not because he is actually concerned it’s real and caused by the mysterious man in Bela’s room.
“He didn’t come with you?” Jo intervenes again, still looking around the room as if the handsome dom would suddenly materialize.
Dean think it’s a good moment to roll his hips against Cas’ as he looks for friction, knowing both of them need it and want it. Castiel closes his eyes and moans in surprise at the new type of pleasure. Dean licks his neck and bites his collarbone and thrust forward again, once, twice… He knows he's getting hard and feeling Cas’ own erection rising just adds up to his excitement. A part of his brain asks what the hell he's doing, but his senses are too aware of the unholy noises coming out of the angel’s mouth to care about what his brain has to say right now. Something that sounds that good can't be too bad.
over their shared love for the half witch. He trusts Seir to be true to his word, just like Dean he would do anything to protect Cas and that means protecting the Winchesters too at this point.
Something in his tone makes Dean pay attention. He turns towards his father and after a brief silence says, “what?”
“Boy, you’ve got an appetite,” Dean told him, smiling fondly down at him. “That’s all Winchester, you know?”
not to be a good boy all the time, to be able to let go and welcome a side of him he’d kept repressed his entire life. The power that runs through his veins when he gives in is addictive. He’s spiralling and he doesn’t know whether he wants to go down that path or not, if it’s right or wrong. He doesn’t even
“You’re growing handsome, Mr Novak,” Dean teases him in an attempt to lighten the mood and distract Cas from his misfortune. “Hadn’t seen you without your shirt for a while.”
“Yeah, when you breached my privacy and sent a message to all my contacts, remember? My dentist sent me a message asking me what the hell I was talking about.” he replies rather resentfully, lifting an eyebrow. “Great party by the way, love to have all girls I've once fucked packed up under the same roof,
“I’m okay with sensational rumours as long as it keeps them away from my house but I don’t want them to get
He considers whether he should tell Dean the whole truth or not. There’s so much Dean still doesn’t know about him, about the witchy side of him, and Cas is never particularly eager to speak about it. His mother never judged his father for the things he’d done (and he’d done far worse and more numerous things than Castiel had in his young life) and she forgave him and loved them in spite of them, so Cas knows a mortal can love a witch but he is still afraid Dean might not be the same towards him. He wants to be the nice, kind and quiet guy Dean pictures him to be.
Dean knew Josie was a little nervous while babysitting the nephilim, and he couldn’t really blame her after her earlier experiences with other nephilim and the whole deal with Lucifer, so he gave them instructions to take it easy; feed them whatever they wanted (but not too much sugar!), let them go to bed when they wanted and sleep in in the morning, and just let the kids play outside in the garden. That’s exactly what Sam and Josie did. They were playing with the children in the garden, making sure they kept an eye on their daughter so the twins wouldn’t accidentally hurt her. The kids waved their fake swords around, running all over the place holding their pirate hats because they kept falling off, and Josie pretended to fall to the ground and die when they hit her with their plastic weapons. Sam, in the other hand, ran after them, chasing them, and the twins tried to escape as fast as they could. Suddenly Henry and Razel turned around and held hands. They gave Sam a mischievous grin that made the grown man stop and hesitate for a moment. In the blink of an eye, four pirates had appeared in the garden, armed with words that look
The ride to the park was rather quiet, except for the usual squeals of excitement coming from Balthazar, who sat in the edge of his seat as he looked out the window like a dog that wanted nothing but to take his head out of the window to feel the wind. Dean stole a glance over the corner of his eyes in the witch’s direction, but she merely looked straight forward the entire time, a strange poker face plastered in her face with the occasional smile making its way to her lips when Balthazar sighed impatiently.
“Then why don’t we make one?” the other suggested with a soothing, seducing voice, grabbing Dean’s waist from behind and pressing their bodies together again, planting a gentle kiss on the side of Dean’s neck. It makes him shudder with want but he remembers, out of the top of his head, the pile of laundry that needs to be done, the leak he needs to fix at Josie’s kitchen and that he also got a call from a hunter that didn’t quite know what she was dealing with and wanted Dean’s opinion. They do that know, advice other hunters, more than they hunt themselves.
A big smile begins to form in Dean’s lips. He's still grinning as he pulls Castiel in for a heated kiss. He cups Cas’s face and presses their body flat against each other.
Mary could see him hesitating but melting into her offer, and gave him a small encouraging smile. It took the angel a moment to make up his mind, but in the end, he nodded in agreement. Mary’s grin widened. She let her grace reach out to touch her father’s and it took him a moment to be able to latch on to hers. He’d been in the giving end with Zep, never the receiving one, and it was an odd sensation as Mary let go of her grace and it passed on to his, spreading like wildlife through him. He caught her in her arms just as her eyes closed and her knees gave in. He held her there for a moment, his own eyes closed, and he gasped as he felt the graces dissolved into one. Hers filled the gaps in his injured grace, and his blue eyes shone with grace for a moment. She hadn’t given him too much, but Castiel could already feel himself growing stronger. If he fed like this a couple more times, his grace would be strong enough to heal completely. He could fly again.
need to sleep or he got extremely cranky, and the last thing Baltz needed was to cause his brother to blow something up by accident.
“There’s no one around, everyone’s either inside or in class,” Cas shrugs as he palms himself. Dean’s eyes are glued to the sight.
“No, not ‘but’s,” she said, standing in the tip of her toes to lean her forehead against yours. “I don’t know what happened while I was at work but, but- but we’ll figure it out. You said you and your brother always figure it out.”
The boy bolted on her and ran out the room. Mary froze. She felt devastated that he not only didn’t recognise her, but ran away from her. And at the same time, she didn't like Jessie’s dad; he had an inflexible, less shiny soul, which she normally she put up with for her friend’s sake, but this boy didn’t know her. Her mind was yelling at her to react, to turn around and leave, but another part of her wondered
sick, his skin is clear and his eyes are sharp and focused. When he gets into the car with them, he looks around with that kind and lazy grin of his, like he didn’t miss school the entire week because he was supposed to be severely sick.
, like Dean says with a smirk. After Cas makes sure about a dozen times that Dean is physically and emotionally okay, Dean finally leaves to have dinner with his family. He smiles the entire way home, enjoying the present, even though in the back of his mind he knows this teenage fairy tale won’t last long; there will be another sacrifice attempt in five days.
"No," Balthazar said as he pulled away from her and turned around to look at Dean. "No, I'll stay with daddy. What if he has another nightmare?"
Dean plants his hand in Castiel’s thigh and squeezes it, making his boyfriend jump into attention, almost dropping his fork. He squirms a little under Dean’s touch and really wishes Dean would pull his hand away.
That is all that takes to distract Charlie from the subject of Dean Winchester and then he doesn’t have to do anything but sit back as Charlie herself leads the entire conversation in the direction he wanted in the first place. Charlie could nerd on for hours about D&D and has been their dungeon master for the better part of the past year. From a corner of his eye, however, he keeps a careful eye on Dean who is now sitting with his younger brother having lunch.
“I found a spell… It can break a love curse if a love sacrifice is made. The type of deal she made, it fits a love curse. And I… I am willing to make a sacrifice, out of love for the both of you.”
The following morning, he leaves before Dean’s even awake and he giggles like an idiot all the way to work, knowing Dean will take a shower when he wakes up and will have to go commando all day. Castiel knows his friend hates wearing no underwear and only ever does it in extremely rare occasions when he forgets to do laundry and Cas refuses to do it for him to teach him a lesson for laughing at him for trying to set a cleaning day for the apartment.
The moment Castiel steps into his house and hear his mother cry while he also registers the smell of two strange Alphas inside the house, he automatically knows something is wrong. He stays very still by the door, his heart racing against his chest. He has the ridiculous idea that if he doesn’t move, time will stand still too, and nothing will happen, no bad news will be delivered. His mother sees him, petrified by the door, and she forces herself to stand up, leaving the men in uniform sitting in the living room.
Little did he know, Sam wasn’t far behind them. Jody had called him to let him know a man had reported seeing a child with a baby in his property, playing with his cows. When he went out into the field to get the children to wait for the police, they were nowhere to be found. The description of the child was similar to the one Sam was looking for. The younger Winchester drove South and kept an eye out for any signs of children without parents, but found nothing.
Judging by the dramatic way Gabriel holds his head in his hands, almost pulling at his hair, eyes wide in horror, Cas’ honesty is not helping him get out of trouble.
Sam really wanted to be mad at Dean for embarrassing him, but the man seemed to be struggling with vegetables, eyeing them like they were something unknown and suspicious, and Sam couldn’t help taking pity on him (and laughing at him too); at least he was
Finally, she found a shop she could steal food from. It was a little gas station, nothing fancy, but she thought it was a better option than asking Baltz to sneak them into a supermarket. After all, she’d promised he wouldn’t have to fly again unless it was really necessary. After the look in his face as he’d watched families cuddling together by the couch, she really didn’t want to add physical discomfort to the list of things her little brother was feeling. He was only 5, after all, it broke her heart that he had to feel this kind of pain at such a young age.
with Cas, really giving himself to the angel implied, and he wasn’t sure he was ready to poke that idea with a ten inch stick, so he quickly moved on from that train of thought before he could scare himself back into the closet.
“Nah, it’s fine,” Gabe tells him, giving Cas that trademark smirk of his he always gives his little brother when he wants to look strong and alleviate his concerns. “We can’t really do much from here, but we’ll talk to dad about it. He’ll have to look into it, make sure the other doors are safe."
Charlie sighs in defeat, pursing her mouth into a thin line. She doesn’t look pleased or ready to give up the subject.
“Alright, dear, off with the shirt,” Rowena ordered as she entered the room. She made sure to keep her voice down and in a gentle tone, to both avoid further waking the baby (she knew very well not to disturb a sleeping baby) and to keep herself in the young nephilim’s good side; she needed him to be friendly with them, with
, the bitter poison that spreads through his mind as he images Dean talking to Charlie and Benny and Garth, all of whom will sympathize with him and think that Castiel is just a freak, a jerk. Dean came back to put down roots and like a fucking weed he’s taking over the entire garden, he’s taking everything from Castiel. He gets between Castiel’s friends and his family and his future, his powers.
Chewing at his lower lip, he debates what to respond. The first text in itself was a mistake born out of impulse, the second must be thought out carefully. The truth is off limits, how can he possibly begin to explain the situation he got himself into?
“Holy shit,” Josie gasped under her breath as she watched the boy appeared and disappeared around the woods. Sam stole a glance in her direction and smiled. “How-?”
think when Balthazar called Dean 'dad'?  Did Dean want Castiel to love him like that? If Castiel loved him in some universe, could he love him in this one too?
But Dean didn’t answer. He took the knife from his pocket, cut his hand and started drawing symbols in the window with his own blood.
For some stupid reason he thinks he’ll have to beg and explain why he needs help, why Cas is suddenly allowed to break all the strict rules Dean laid out for him, but no, Castiel is right there in a blink of an eye, grabbing the blocks of rubbish like they weight nothing, digging Dean out of the pile. Even with the pressure gone, Dean still can’t feel his arm. He doesn’t have time to worry about it though, or even examine it properly, because the next thing he knows Castiel is crouching down next to him, touching two fingers to his forehead and all pain and discomfort leaves Dean’s body right there and then.
Dean chuckles at Castiel’s sudden nervous demeanour; it seems John still intimidates him a little, even if they’re not dating and John treats him like any other of Dean’s friends.
, no matter how dumb, to try and keep the nightmares away, he might as well try it. Sammy’s been plagued with nightmares too, John’s have stopped, so it’s not just him, it’s something happening to
Castiel laughs and sits back with his hands on the floor supporting his weight, mentally patting himself on the back,
and seats back as she turns to watch John’s face, waiting for his reaction just as everyone else. Castiel looks angry for the first time ever in the presence of Dean’s friends and family. It’s a feeling that’s been building up for years. In all fairness he realises now that John didn’t know that his actions were hurtful and insulting but Castiel figures Dean should have realised that and said something to his father instead of brushing it off time and time again and then telling Cas not to get angry, that it didn’t mean anything, that his dad was just joking. It never felt funny to him.
“Because you’re not even an adult yet, Cas, and it’s not safe for you to get involved in that sort of stuff,” Gabe explains. He sounds tired and Castiel can relate to being emotionally exhausted. “And with the gate of Hell closed, dad and I never thought it was relevant to teach you those subjects because they don’t apply to you yet. I thought I’d focused on helping you control your powers which are already abnormally strong, and teach you magic that you can actually use. Why would I teach you to summon demons, Cas? Why would I teach you how to break deals? You should not be meddling with those sorts of spells, shouldn’t even be making deals in the first place—which I hope you know. You should have trusted me and come to me first if you had any questions.”
“Could you tell my friends I passed out or something?” he asks Castiel. He is fighting the urge to just close his eyes, roll over to his side and doze off,
There’s just something about that cough she doesn’t like. Maybe she’s exaggerating but considering everything that is going on she rather err on the side of caution. The talisman will not save them from a curse, just delay it. If this really is something to worry about and in the end a curse ends up befalling onto her mother, Charlie would never forgive herself for not trying hard enough to protect her.
"Just friends, huh? Then you won’t mind bringing them to your birthday party next Saturday, right?" Sam challenges his brother.
Without another world and without giving trench-coat-dude a chance to follow him, Dean all but runs out of the house. When he swings the door open he comes to an abrupt stop; the front lawn has become, in the course of half an hour, an explosion of vegetation.
Dark eyes land on Dean. Even if it’s for just one second, it feels wrong. Cas wants to throw himself on top of Dean and hide him from sight, from harm’s way. When Satan’s severe gaze turns to Castiel, the witch gladly exchanges places with the hunter.
“I’m sorry I’m not the perfect trophy husband, Cas, but this is not my goddamn life, I don’t know how to be a fucking royal, okay?”
pick up on Dean’s intentions and that he wants to show him something instead, which is only mildly disappointing, but Dean doesn’t have the time to dwell on that train of thought before Castiel produces a small package from his backpack. It is small but heavy, fits nicely in just one of Dean’s hands and is covered by a simple gift wrapping paper.
Josie made her pies and dinner for everyone, and, at some point, got stuck babysitting the kids while she did all that, so she quickly put them to work. She still didn’t know what was going on, why there were two Deans or what were they all searching for so desperately with their noses buried in books in the library, but she didn’t ask, just continued cooking and trying to keep the kids busy and distracted. It wasn’t easy and by the time she finished, she was covered in flour and a little sweaty, her feet ached and she couldn’t wait to have a shower and change into her pajamas.
Mary blushed, wondering if maybe they'd been wrong to assume Dean wouldn't mind them crawling into bed with him. Balthazar always did when he had nightmares.
They moved away, started off somewhere new with the money the insurance paid Sam. His brother insisted he came with them and kept a careful eye on him. He wasn’t sure what he feared the most; that Dean might do something stupid like driving to Chicago and get himself killed or arrested for murder, or that he might do something stupid like just killing himself right there and then.
Eventually he excuses himself and drags Garth along with him to leave the girls alone. In the living room people are sitting on the couch and pillows on the floor, some drinking Gilda’s weird mixed drinks, others playing it safe with soda, while everyone enjoys the snacks. They’re in a big circle. In the middle, in a cleared space, there are several cups with different liquids inside and Benny, Dean and two other girls are playing ‘beer’ pong. Dean’s crushing Benny.
“I’m gonna go to the store,” he announced as he stood up, dragging a hand across his face. “We need light bulbs.”
Early in the morning, the new Dean sat in the edge of his daughter's bed. The mattress sank under his weight, causing Mary to roll a little towards the depression. She stirred in her sleep and opened her eyes as her father pulled a lock of her hair behind her ear.
love him, and then he lost him, by the hand of an enemy or by the angel’s own choice to leave him? Because Dean
The child also realised she would require her grace to do basically everything for Zep. Sure, she had diapers, but there were only
When he awakes, the whole thing makes him sick even though he can still sense the tingling sensation of powerful magic buzzing under his skin. It’s almost arousing. A memory he’s not yet made but he’s bound to live, that’s what it all feels like.
Cas turned his head very slowly to look at Dean. He looked at the man from the corner of his eyes to find him doing the same. The looked at each other,
Getting sick is one of the many new things Castiel has to get used to as a mortal. He was grateful to find the changing seasons didn’t trigger any allergies on him like they do with Charlie, but during his first winter as a mortal he finds himself succumbing to the cold weather. They had moved for his studies, Dean followed him as he didn’t really care where he studied to be a firefighter whereas Cas was pursuing a very specific degree. It had probably not been a good idea to move to a place where the winters were much harsher than what he was used to even when he was a half-witch but he didn’t really have another choice.
“I’m not sure how old the kid is but her pregnancy would have overlapped with your engagement… Maybe she didn’t want to tell you, you know? To avoid
They all start towards the door, all but Gabriel, who grabs his brother by the arm and pulls him back.
"I teach you?" Sam smiled. He’d always liked the idea of teaching, he loved sharing knowledge. "Really? That's cool. What do I teach you?"
Mary hesitated. She didn’t want to fight the man. “But you’ve got to swear you won’t tell anybody about us! We’re not supposed to use our powers in front of humans,” she gave Baltz a reproachful look. It’s not that she didn’t want the boy to help strangers, but they were in quite a predicament themselves, and Mary needed to keep her brothers’ and her own presence in the down low. The last thing she needed was to bring attention to themselves and have a hunter -or worse, some kind of evil supernatural creature- looking for them.
“I am sure,” Dean responds, taking full responsibility for what could happen and for what he would have to give up if they have to close the door again; his own life.
. It’s a miracle they don’t get into an accident. Sam periodically checks Castiel’s pulse and keeps an eye out for any signs that his magic is working to get him better, but just as Dead was unable to sense a heartbeat, Sam fails as well. He doesn’t say anything though, to avoid distressing his brother any further. He just sets his jaw, shuts his mouth and prays that they’ll get to Hell on time—which is a crazy thought to have. If Seir says Castiel is alive, then they'll have to take his word for it because to the human eye he looks already dead.
“Jimmy-” he starts out of habit. He’d spent years fighting the urge to call Castiel by his real name. He’d always thought it was a shame he couldn’t use that one because it was rather beautiful in his opinion and he’d secretly referred to the other man as Cas in his head for years. He’d called him Cas out loud tonight for the first time, when fear had overpowered Dean and made him forget about everything else. “Castiel…”
But Castiel couldn’t do it. He’d killed so many of his kind already… He was tired, deep down, of all the death that got in his path. He was tired of being the one that
Dean gets up from his bed and walks over to the demon, crouching down next to him. Cas looks over at him with this radiant and happy expression in his face that seems all too human, all to… well,
“That’s what I said!” He looks up, relieved but still curious. “May I ask whose is he? Is there some asshole that needs their ass kicked?”
For a moment, Dean’s grip tightened even more around Cas’ arms, his fingertips digging deep into the other's muscles. Had Castiel been human, it would had hurt him. Dean hadn’t felt this intense dread in a long time; many years, in fact. There was so much he wanted to say, but he was lost for words. Instead, he pulled Castiel into a bruising kiss, their lips clashing against each other’s. When Dean pulled away, he forced himself to look away. It was killing him to walk away from his angel and he had to order his legs to move as he ran upstairs, one foot in front of the door, catching sight of Sam as he ran past him. Sam looked beyond concerned. The young Winchester wanted to say something to his brother, but there was nothing that would comfort Dean, nothing that could calm himself either. He loved Dean's children madly, and he was worried about his own too. His family wasn't with them at the moment, it wasn't safe to be at Bobby's. He'd promise his wife and child he'd come back when things got sorted out, but the truth was Sam didn't know if he would be able to keep that promise.
“Of course I want to, but like I said, not like this. Not because you think you have to or because you think it’ll make me feel better. When it happens—whatever and whenever you want
“It-” Dean started, his voice barely audible, then cleared his throat and continued, “it was our pleasure.”
Breakfast was a weird and rather uncomfortable business. Everyone tried really hard to grin and pretend their worlds weren't on fire for Balthazar’s sake and were grateful the kid was too busy telling his dad all about their trip so he never once stopped and stared at either men’s souls; what he would have seen there wouldn't have been pretty. His father seemed more aggravated by the minute as his son started retelling all the problems they had had and suddenly the boy gasped when he realized they hadn't invited the witch to join them.
“I don’t know what you plan to do with us,” Mary said, “but there’s three of us and one of you. We will smite you.”
Then he nods and takes a few steps away, fumbling with the keys of the car on his hand, doing his best to not look crushed by the fall of his expectations.
Guns in their hands, Sam and Dean advanced. Dean ran furiously through the empty building, until, finally, he found the angel on top of the girl, chocking her.
Dean stepped right into Sam’s face, daring him to speak his mind, to say what Dean already knew he was implying. He was terrified of hearing the words out loud, to have someone else define him when he wasn’t even sure how to do that himself.
loses control like this, his magic never manifest without his intention. But his brother is beyond furious, hands curled into fists that are practically shaking, so Castiel tells him the truth. There’s no point in lying, anyway.
Sam went on. “I don’t know what the universe is like, Cas, I’ve no idea what you saw, and if you don’t wanna tell me, that’s fine. But if there’s any chance that Dean can be happy, after everything he’s been through-” Sam cut himself short. Castiel though it was funny Sam didn’t include himself in that.
Dean’s not sure what his goal is anymore because it surely isn’t to mess with Cas when he says, “I like… guys… too.”
The younger Winchester didn’t look at his brother when he nodded without honesty. He didn’t want to look in Dean’s eyes as he lied to him. He knew he’d be leaving and soon, to check out what had happened in Sioux Falls, and Dean was not going to like it one bit.
Charlie nods although something about her expression shows that there’s nothing more she’d like to do to be at school and have a normal life again. Having a witch friend is cool but fighting evil forces is just exhausting, mentally and physically.
They eat and talk and laugh until they’re too tired to keep their eyes open and they fall asleep in the living room, making beds out of covers on the floor. Dean says sleepovers are for girls, Charlie tells him to just go to bed and stop being such a dude. The next day, around noon Dean drives his friends home while Cas stays to rest. Cas likes being in the house by himself and having some time to think although it feels…
Eyes glue to Dean, Cas sits in silence for a second, taking the information in. He opens his mouth to ask something, thinks twice of it and closes it. Dean takes a quick look at him, then back at the road. Cas looks conflicted.
him. They have no privacy whatsoever, except in their room, and they have to watch their manners and keep their public displays of affection perfectly PG… But Dean adapts surprisingly well and never gives the bodyguards another reason to scold them. There’s really not a big shift in their relationship, in the way they behave around each other when they’re in public, except they now hold hands when they walk from class to class and Dean plants an innocent peck on his lips when they part ways.
Balthazar hesitated. He was still afraid of him, but the man seemed ill and injured, and the child could help him. He’d always tell Dean he’d help people when he grew up, and although Dean was proud of his son’s kind spirit, he was worried of the heavy weight that came with trying to save everyone; he damn well knew all about that burden. Heaven saw his children as their new, future leaders in the making, three powerful beings that would finally bring peace between humans and angels, and Dean didn’t like the pressure that put on his little kids, no matter how much Balthazar seemed to like the idea. Castiel seemed to be of two minds about it; he wanted his children to be children, but at the same time, he knew they weren’t
wrong. All these years, he’s done his best to keep the angel close but at a safe, comfortable distance. He’d built a strong friendship with the angel, had formed a special bond with him, had repeated the word ‘brother’ to define him until he believed that’s what he felt, and now everything was changing over night. And now the angel barely looked at him. Dean couldn’t help but wonder what he’d seen. What had gone differently in that universe that they ended up together? Why weren’t they together in this universe? Was Dean gay there? Was he gay
This week I've two mid-terms, Wednesday and Friday, so I probably won't be updating again until Friday night or next weekend really. Sorry about that. For once in my life, I should actually make studying a priority lol.
None spoke during the drive back to the bunker. Dean stole a glance in Cas’ direction once or twice. His jaw was clenched, eyebrows together in concentration, hands firm on the steering-wheel.
The one and only really good piano teacher in town is a disgruntled lady over 60, deeply religious but in the bad way. She happens to be convinced that there’s something wrong with the Novaks. She’s not wrong, to be fair, but she has no real reason to fear or dislike them, she’s just an awful person.
The human couldn't hide his emotions with fake smiles though. Zep watched Dean’s soul cloud with shame and pain, and he frowned in confusion, a part of him understanding there was something wrong, and he didn't like it. He mumbled something unintelligible, a kind of protest.
“Lucky we’re neighbours, huh?” Dean comments. A thumb traces circles over Castiel’s hand. He could swear he can
As per its title, this chapter is going to be unapologetically domestic. I regret nothing, we deserve to indulge, it’s been a tough year.
“Are you sure?” she asked, feeling guilty, but her eyelids felt heavy. It was way passed midnight and she was exhausted.
Christine, Sam’s only daughter, was only a couple of years younger than Mary. Mary adored her, and Chris looked up to her. Sam’s kid was fascinated with her nephilim cousins and used to cry when she was younger because she wanted to have wings too, even though she’d never really seen her cousins’ wings. Mary would put up little shows for her; she’d made flowers around them levitate when they played in Bobby’s backyard, she’d called birds to play with them or she would appear and disappear around her cousin and tickle her. When Balthazar played with them too, Castiel would always hover around them, making sure Baltz didn’t break her cousin’s bones by accident; sometimes the little kid still had trouble measuring his strength.
Castiel takes Charlie’s hand and there’s a sort of promise in his next words. “She’s going to be okay, Charlie, nothing can harm her.”
Dean mumbles some incomprehensible words but eventually lets himself be cajoled to stand up. He avoids direct eye-contact with his mother and escapes the sympathetic glances of his family into the bathroom. The water is ice-cold and he shivers under the spray but doesn’t bother to turn up the temperature. With his head hung low, his eyes fixated on the tiles under his feet, he feels the drops pierce into his neck like needles, and takes it at his righteous punishment. Slowly, the coldness dissolves his weariness and clouded mind and his body energizes enough to kick this depressive mood’s but and take a deep breath.
Without saying a word, Dear starts the car and drives away. His thoughts are racing out of control, suspicions he thought he’d gotten over resurfacing.
"We'd better stock up in those, huh?" he half-joked, but made a mental note to go to the supermarket before they were left in the dark. "I wish I could make Mary and Balthazar as happy as you... But they see right through me, don't they? They know I've messed up... My soul scares them, doesn't it?" Dean's smile faltered, his voice lowered. "Is it that broken, son? My soul, is it that bad?"
Dean closes his eyes, embarrassed, ashamed. “It’s just a stupid crush, I’ll get over it. Seriously, don’t worry about it, it’s fine, Cas.”
, Dean thinks. He’s sort of used to it by now but he can’t imagine what Lisa must be going through with all those people waiting outside her house waiting for something to happen. The way the media describes Lisa is all but kind. She’s become a pariah, a homewrecker, a threat to the stability of the entire country and Dean can’t help but feel sorry for her. For old times sake, because he really liked her even though they were never in love, he wants to reach out and make sure she’s okay.
They laid in bed for a while, just looking down at their beautiful, tiny children. Both of them had light blond hair, one with brown eyes and the other with blue eyes. Castiel hoped, just like in the other universe, that the next kid would have Dean’s eyes, and hopefully they would have a girl too; Mary was going to be pissed they didn’t have at least one girl.
yes. Star Wars—wait, no, I wanna watch those too. Harry Potter… that will keep you busy for a while. Lord of the Rings… See this list, literally where it says
The angel grabbed the first shirt he saw in Dean’s closet and begun to strip off his clothes right in front of Dean. Too surprised to look away, Dean stared at him. First, off went the trench-coat, then his suit jacket. It took Cas a moment to undo his tie and the back of the man’s mind very loudly told him to either look away or tell his friend to change somewhere else, but he was about to see Cas’ naked torso and that rattled Dean more than it should.
She doesn't need to say a thing to answer his question, Dean can read it in her face the moment he says their names. The sadness in her fragile, pale features is evident. She retreats into herself, taking a step back as she turns away from him. It was the wrong thing to ask he realises, but this is what he came for.
, Dean, without telling my son how you really feel and that would have destroyed him. He’s sat by your side every day, blaming himself for whatever’s been going on between you lately, wondering if he would ever have the chance to make it right. I don’t have the power to command you anymore and you certainly don’t owe me any favors, but as your father in law I urge you to have the courage to finally tell him how you feel because I am sure now, with how you jumped in front of him to protect him, that you love him just as much. Make this right. I
people were homeless, and when he asked, Dean tried to change the subject; he was too young to understand the complexity of economic crisis and things like that.
Dean grabs the handle and pulls the door open, just a little bit, taking a quick peek inside in case there’s some demonic creature on the other side waiting to rip their throats out, but when he finds there’s just a dark tunnel illuminated by torches, he lets out a relieved breath and finishes opening them widely.
Cas handed the baby over to her and Mary sat her brother on her lap. She held the baby with a hand in his belly securely keeping him in place, while her other hand reached for Balthazar’s.
“I made my peace with my choice so please don’t hold back on my account. The decision to use the spell or not is yours to make. If you want to keep trying, I’ll support you, baby bro. I’ll keep digging, I’ll keep researching, and I know dad will too.”
She’d put the kids down not long ago, when a noise of glass breaking made her jump on the bed. Something dropped in her stomach as an uncomfortable, dark feeling crawled up her spine. Something was wrong. She opened her drawer nightstand’s drawer and drew out her gun. Why,
“How did you do that!?” he asked in a high-pitched tone as he backed away from her, suddenly terrified of the little girl.
Dean does, however, have energy for something else. As soon as they reach their bedroom, he pushes Castiel inside and up against the wall. He’s against him in no time, grinding his crotch against his husband’s, seeking that sweet friction that gets them both going, as he licks and nips at his neck.
“We do,” he spoke very softly, very slowly, running a hand through Balthazar’s hair, “just… not in that way.”
Nothing’s ever simple for them, some big bad constantly tries to take over, but Dean and Cas always keep fighting to protect their world, their family. With Raphael gone and Mary getting stronger everyday, Castiel gained the trust of his fellow brothers and sisters, and they accepted the nephilim as one of their own. There's peace between Earth and Heaven, for once.
Castiel’s grandmother starts laughing and crying hysterically at the same time, holding back her daughter. “It’s me, baby, it’s me! I waited for you! I waited so long!”
He holds Dean’s stare looking like a deer caught in the headlights, probably for longer than he should, giving himself away, because next thing he knows Dean snorts and crosses his arms over his chest, lifting an eyebrow at him.
a lie. If he were hooking up with someone it'd mean he's getting something from it too other than an uncomfortable boner and a small life crisis.
Dean frowns, slightly taken aback by the short answer that doesn’t really say anything. He shares a questioning look with his boyfriend, who just shrugs, and starts the ignition again.
Dean pulled away to look at her. He cupped her face in his big hands and wiped her tears away. He hated to see her face twisting with sadness.
“Every dark soul, even Satan, has a human soulmate. Some even have more than one, as we live very long lives. Soulmates are God’s attempt to, let’s say, seduce us back into the light. They ground us, they make us more human. When we find our soulmates, Satan will give us a sign. A
“A few days. You lost a lot of blood. You had to have emergency surgery, but even then it was touch and go for a while. You’re stable now, so don’t worry, you can rest.”
“You could always stay with us,” Castiel offers, grabbing Dean’s hand below the table. “Both of you,” he adds because he knows the Winchester brothers are a two package deal. He’d do anything to get Dean to stay, even if that’s reckless because they would, for certain, be safer if they went away. But he justifies his selfish desires by telling himself there’s no safer place than his home.
them. Probably for a spell that calls for really powerful sacrifices. Bobby might have overlooked that because he didn’t know about Aurora and these types of sacrifices are really also very uncommon these days, they’re used for only extremely powerful and dark magic. It’s also really rare for there to be so many sacrifices.
“She was the president of the math club and also…” Sam makes a face, reluctant to go on. Instead of saying anything he just throws a piece of old newspaper their way. They lean in together at the same time to look down at a picture of Cara and instantly know what Sam means; Cara was by no means the type of girl you’d expect to get lucky at high school, with her big glasses, braces and really bad skin. Sam, who is a rather kind person, just doesn’t want to say that out loud.
“But how are we going to do it then? The boy never lets the baby out of his sight, and I doubt the girl will be easy to fool. She’s
Castiel looks down at his clothes as if he’d forgotten what he was wearing; pyjamas, he’s been in his pyjamas all day.
But the boy wasn’t too happy about the distance that still had to be covered and by the expression on his face, it seemed he was in the verge of tears.
The witch huffs a laugh. “But nice girls, they’re pathetic. I rather be a little bad, though I can be a little good too, can’t I? I helped your sister, after all.”
The way he says it, it is so natural, Dean can't help but wonder if Cas has always thought of him like that. And then he wonders
The fact that he just left all his friends behind and they’re probably thinking he’s a fucking weirdo, a dramatic jerk that just walked out of the house for no reason whatsoever. What will they think about him? What will Dean tell them? With all his fucking charm he could have them believe anything at all, he could pull them further into his side, away from Castiel.
He likes to cuddle Dean at night in his sleep and give him light pecks on the lips, but never remembers doing it the following morning. He does it out of instinct, a wild act of his unconscious mind that puts in evidence Castiel's true sweet nature. He rarely ever laughs hard or loud; it’s not because he doesn’t find things funny (although a lot of sarcastic or ironic jokes to elude him), he’s just quiet and gentle like that. He tells Dean that sometimes people are put off by his personality, that they misunderstand his serenity and quietude and mistake it for uninterest or arrogance. This has always caused him trouble making friends or dating people. He prefers to listen to people talk rather than speak himself but when he talks about things he likes, he could go on forever, like when he spent almost half an hour telling Dean about bees. Apparently, they don’t have lungs and this amazes Cas.
“Dean looks like he can handle himself. Besides, what do you suggest we do, Charlie? Tell the new kid the only person who’s talking to him only wants to use him to get back at his ex?” Castiel responds, barely making an effort not to slur his words which are muffled against his arm. “Be my guest.”
“It didn’t, it’s just that-” Mary sighed and contemplated her options; how could she explain travelling through universes to her 5 years old little brother? He barely understood what he was and that not everyone had powers like they did, not to mention most people didn't know that creatures like them or their father existed.
The drive to Dean’s work takes an eternity, which isn’t even true because it’s already past rush hour, but to Cas it feels like that. He curses at each and every red light hindering from reaching his fiancé as fast as possible. And when the elevator in Dean’s office building comes back down to the ground floor at a glacial pace, he takes the stairs, jumping up the seven floors while skipping every other step.
Even though Dean’s not a magic lover, he trusts his witch friend so he opens the box. Inside there’s a small crystal ball perfectly encased so that it won’t move or break. Dean’s first reaction is confusion; why on Earth would Castiel give him a crystal ball as a present? He makes sure to keep the best poker face he can muster to not make Castiel feel bad for poorly judging what would make a good present for him. He’s about to ask what exactly the trick is supposed to be when he notices the surface of the sphere changing, his reflection fading away and being replaced at the same time by completely different images. He brings the sphere closer to his eyes, lips parted in amazement and he watches. As the images come to full focus and they’re finally recognizable, he almost drops the box.
Castiel hesitates for only a moment, looking Dean’s way for a fraction of a moment like he wishes he could sit next to him instead, before he sits in the very edge of the chair and lets his backpack slide down his arm and into the floor. For some reason Dean is thankful they can’t sit side by side; he doesn’t think he could handle Castiel sitting next to him
“Dear, there’s three of my kind too,” Rowena spoke with confidence but careful not to sound smug. “And you… You’re very weak. I don’t think you have the advantage here. But fear not, you’re not in danger.”
“I can do awkward,” Cas responds dumbly, feeling stupid for the graceless words that just came out of his mouth the moment they do but having Dean so close is making his head foggy. “We can go in… if you want.”
The living room is packed with his friends which include Pamela, Jo, Gilda and Ash, his family, Gabriel, Charlie’s mom and Garth’s parents. They have all gathered in secret to surprise him for his birthday. It’s almost too many people for their small home, but despite being crowded everyone’s staring at him with bright smiles. The room is decorated with balloons and there’s even a happy birthday banner. Dean only has a second to take it all in in complete awe before people rip him from Castiel’s hands and pull him into hugs, repeating their happy birthday wishes one by one. Dean is speechless with emotion, doing his best to smile and greet people through the lump in his throat. He only gets a proper word out when Garth’s mom pulls him into a hug.
It took a while for Dean and Cas to face their own wishes and go on with their lives. It felt somehow weird or wrong, a cloud of guilt hovered over them at the idea of having their own family, like they were trying to replace the three kids they’d met and loved so much with their own children. They missed them almost to the point it drove them mad, made them want to jump into that other universe and never let them go, but they weren’t theirs to keep or raise. The kids were back home, safe and sound, happy in their house, in their lives, Mary was probably back in school and Balthazar had finally gained the right to play in the park with others kids; all was good, except the craving for a family of their own was eating them alive.
He quietly sits down at his desk, pretending he doesn’t hear his name being whispered here and there, but inside his levels of anxiety are growing exponentially. Do they know something he doesn’t?
“I want it in paper,” Cas growls back, grabbing the paper and letting it fall angrily on the table. “I want the evidence. Can you look at me in the eyes and tell me you are 100% sure that kid’s not yours? Would you bet your life— no, wait, you’ve always been on a path of self destruction, so would you bet
“Let’s just sit here in silence for a little while, what do you say, Cas?” Balthazar all but begs. He looks done for the day. Not a nature lover either, this one.
It takes Cas a minute to ask what he wants to know but he finally seems to make up his mind to do it.
Mary was finding it increasingly hard to keep Balthazar busy and content. Smashing cars was beginning to get boring for the kid and they had run out of food the very first day. After that, she'd started feeding her brothers with her own grace, but she knew it was only a matter of time before she had to eat something real herself. She would also grow increasingly weaker if her brothers kept feeding on her so often, and she needed her strength to protect them in this weird, lonely universe.
. Dean would never look down on a man who was in love with another man. So why was it so wrong for him to feel this way about Castiel? If Dean Winchester should love anyone at all, in
Victor, a more serious person, lifts an eyebrow at Pamela like he knows she’s up to something. “What game?”
As he glances towards the school, a wild idea crosses his mind: Castiel’s still at school and he will be for a few more hours. No Cas at home is like no dragon to fight before getting to the castle, the way is finally free and Dean can finally go check on Castiel's parents without causing a scene with the youngest member of the Novak family.
“I know,” the waitress said, blushing slightly. “It’s my treat. You guys seem super busy. Thought you might need the fuel. I've always had the hardest time studying in the morning.”
Mary turned around to grin up at him and Dean all but melted in that blue ocean that were her eyes. The terrible thought that maybe that was the last time she would ever smile at him crossed his mind, nearly causing him to break down and cry on the spot.
“Did something happen?” Sam asked. A knot in his stomach had already begun to form. It’d been only a couple of weeks since the whole Amara thing had come to an end. They’d suffered a lot, physical and emotionally, and were still recovering from the whole ordeal. He was, in a strange way, grateful to be hunting something as simple as a ghost after God's sister. And if angels were making a fuss about something… It couldn’t be good sign.
Gabriel is not home yet which annoys Castiel in astronomical proportions. In all fairness, it’s really not late at all, they’ve returned from the carnival much earlier than expected. It’s a Friday night, after all, the gang should still be out there having fun, most likely than not hanging out at someone’s place after they were done with the fair. Gabe is still out with Kali and will probably not return until much later, if at all; those two love birds keep each other up all night, much to Cas’ horror. Castiel would call him but then
But Sam’s words had had an effect on him, of course, and a strong one. He didn't even know what to think about first. A part of him felt sorry for Sam and could not imagine what would feel like to know the person you belong to suddenly has make due with someone else. He’d had a taste of it, but it hadn’t been the same, he knew Cas wasn't
Castiel’s glad she leaves though because as Dean grows older the mirror shows him what must be Dean’s deepest, darkest secrets; he starts sleeping around,
“Dean, wait-” Cas moved to stand next to him before Dean followed after his brother. “I just… I just wanted to thank you. You know, for
However, preparing for the worse, Cas once more heads to bed early planning to wake up before 3 am strikes. Garth, Benny and Charlie hang out in the living room for a little longer before each takes a guest room for themselves. That early morning, or late night, Dean wakes up with Castiel and keeps watch with Gabriel downstairs while the others sleep upstairs.
Adeliza gave a sigh of relief and nodded. "Sure." Anything to get that heavy lump away from her. She passed the baby on to Balthazar, not really caring to be gentle, and Zep woke up. Baltz barely caught him and sat down quickly on the floor to better position the child in his lap. He hugged his brother and rested his back against the bed Mary laid on. As the witches retreated from the room, Balthazar tried his best to put his wings around his younger brother to rock him back to sleep as Mary always did with them. It was a good thing he was sitting down and laying against the bed, because with the mess of emotions that ran furiously through his soul, it was almost impossible to detach himself from his grace and control it.
Sam suddenly facepalms himself way too hard. “Cas?” he repeats, eyes wildly going back and forwards between his brother and Benny. “As in
“It rarely ever doesn’t,” Dean smiles, proud of himself and his knowledge on Jack. “I think he’s fussy, he probably didn’t sleep very well last night, I guess he’s more eager to take a nap than eat. What do you say we go out for a walk, get him to sleep, and then we’ll come back and fix your living room? It’s like a nursery exploded in there.”
they catch the magic trick on the spot, meaning they would have to witness the magic to be able to finally catch the trail. Under the circumstances, it would most likely mean that they or someone else would have to be in danger, under attack. They debate a lot over this and Dean offers himself as bait at once. Castiel shuts him down immediately and tells him not to act hastily; they will more likely be targets soon enough so there’s no need to jump into more unnecessary danger.
They looked at each other for a moment and Dean almost felt sorry for her. “You really care about him, don’t you?”
Around 6 am he arrives to Lisa’s and he’s happy to see the vultures with cameras are not yet there or have already left her house alone. He tells the guards to wait for him at the car and hurries to her door, only realising how fucking early and out of place his visit it when he’s already knocking on her door. He panics for a moment; he doesn’t even know if Lisa will want to see him, let alone show up uninvited on her doorstep, but it only takes her a few seconds to open the door which indicates she was already up. When she opens the door, far from being mad at him, a broad smile adorns her otherwise tired face.
“No… I came to cure her. She had something weird on her head,” he explained. Little did he know Mayuri actually had cancer and was supposed to die, her mother had only recently taken her to the doctor because the child had constant headaches, but they wouldn’t have found it in time.
Dean shrugs, looking up at his father through his eyelashes. His eyes are glassy again. “Isn’t that what you raised me to be, dad?”
"You don't know that," Mary looked down, choking with the lump in her throat. Her dad had said so himself, he couldn’t promise they would go back to get them before they left that night.
“Now?” the boy opened a single eye and looked at his father with a very confused expression in his face. Dean bit the insides of his cheeks and tried his best to fake a smile.
The memory seemed fresh. Mary had giving him so much grace, she’d been unconscious for days. Eventually, Cas had taken her to Heaven so she could recover faster, while Dean stayed on Earth, a ball of unbearable nerves.
"I can't control it, it wasn't on purpose," Baltz confessed with a sigh and moved around the bed to climb onto the other side. He moved carefully to snuggle against Dean under the covers. "But I can stop him from having more nightmares."
“No!” Mary protested, turning around on her chair to look up at Dan. “I wanna know! Is something coming our way?”
tell us what’s up with you?” Dean’s tone came out more demanding and annoyed that he'd intended to, but it was a true reflection of his feelings. There he was, telling Sam they were going to do things by the book with their friend, and Cas was, yet
As sudden as the seismic activity had begun, it ended. Dean kept driving towards the direction Cas had felt the energy originating from, until the two of them reached a church. Glass from the now shattered windows were scattered all around outside the building. There were cracks in the ground, even in the pavement and Dean had trouble driving through them, worried Baby might get damaged. People screaming hysterically, stammering about God punishing them and apocalyptic things of that sort.
Sam and Mary left when the girl finished her breakfast, although this time they decided to study in a diner instead of the library. Sam ordered coffee and Mary made a summary of what she’d understood what he’d made her read. She learned fast, and Sam wondered if she was particularly smart or if it was an angel thing, maybe her mind developed faster or something. Either way, she was bright and curious and lent over the table to better listen to everything Sam had to say. He realised he loved teaching, and while she did some math exercises, he took his computer out of his bag and opened some websites to check out some university programs he could apply too. Maybe law school was behind him, but there were other things he could do, other normal jobs that might give him some sort of joy…
“I’ll be super quick, I swear. I’ll bring you some m&m’s, what do you say?” she offered him and winked an eye at him, trying to lighten the mood.
During the day, they travelled. They put as much kilometers as possible between whoever was looking for the children, because everyone was still looking for the children, and themselves. Sometimes they stayed in fancy hotels, sometimes they’d stay in rented, expensive houses. Balthazar behaved for the most part, not really feeling comfortable enough around the other two witches to be his usual playful self, although he was starting to get really bored.
“Huh?” Charlie lifts her sight from the book. She looks irritated, personally offended by it.. “You said something? Please say something, save me from this book, I beg you, Dean.”
"Sometimes I do it at night, while everyone's sleeping. It's a habit I picked up while I was human," he explained with a shrug. "It feels... Nice. Soothing. It helps clear my mind. But since I watch over Zep at night, I haven't had a lot of time."
“But- son- you should say goodbye to her,” Dean pressed gently, wondering if he should turn the car around and go back to the park.
The weekend is pretty boring although not entirely uneventful, at least for Dean. On Saturday morning, he goes grocery shopping with his dad who runs into a colleague, a cute woman with red hair, just a bit younger than him. She has a really enthusiastic smile for his dad. Dean plays dumb and gives them some space; it’d be
“Dean?” he knocked on the door and went in when he heard Dean respond with a sleepy growl. The angel knew Balthazar was sleeping in his bed, Sam had told him, but that didn’t stop Cas from smiling when he saw the two of them; they looked so comfortable with each other, like real father and son. The angel suspected Dean was actually very happy about the little intruder.
in town knows about that, it’s the reason why parents to this day are so wary of letting their kids go out at night. It changed the town forever, it planted the seed of fear in their minds.
It’s been a few days since they’ve spent quality time together so before Dean can retreat into his bedroom and hide away, probably even go to bed early, Castiel jumps to his feet and takes this opportunity to ask Dean to do something with him. Their busy schedules, which often don’t match, and Dean’s social life have kept them apart quite often lately, leaving just a few hours a week where they are both home at the same time.
dies and he becomes the next sacrifice? Cas, in the sunset of his life, is in the most immediate danger, and Dean has a way to save him right there, in his hands.
The fight was almost over, and they were losing. They had to let go, they had to get ready, but they were both afraid to let each other go, they feared it’d be the last time they’d be able to hold each other like this. Standing there, desperately clinging to each other, Dean's grip on Castiel's arm tightening in anticipation, in fear, before he finally had to let go, it felt like a silent goodbye.
But Dean doesn’t try to go to their home again, too afraid to cross paths with Castiel once more and get into another argument. He doesn’t want to piss him off again, fearing that he might talk shit about him to other people if Dean antagonizes him. That’s the last thing Dean needs, a bad reputation. The worst part is Dean has no idea what he did to anger him so he can’t make it right either. For the rest of the week, he decides to stay clear of him and instead he attempts to strike up conversation with some of the other students. He exchanges a few words here and there with a few people but he never gets invited to have lunch with any group, nor do people seem particularly interested in making an effort to integrate him. It doesn’t help that he keeps having stupid little awkward incidents that make him look like an idiot. For example, after tripping two more times on his shoelaces that week in front of the whole class, he starts checking them religiously, tucking the ends inside his shoes to ensure they don’t play tricks on his anymore. He also slips on the cafeteria on Wednesday and drops his entire plate of pasta on his white shirt. On Thursday a rather huge spider lands on him in the middle of the class, catching him by surprise and making him squeal embarrassingly loud in disgust, interrupting the professor in the middle of his explanation and making the girl who sits next to him jump out of her skin. He has the feeling she hates his guts, it’s the second time that week he startles her. Oh, and he also wakes up with a big, angry pimple in his forehead on Friday. Awesome, just what he needs.
Charlie texts him soon after lunch and Dean jumps when the phone buzzes inside his pocket. His heartbeat accelerates more than he'd like to admit and maybe, just maybe, his hands shake a little, only to fully relax when he sees the text is from his friend.
Castiel stops going to school. Gabriel leaves town for a few days, running after Rowena to try and convince her to help them out. During his brother’s absence, Cas makes sure he’s available at all times to step in and help should any attacks occur during the day. He has Seir patrolling the city day and night, almost to the point where they are both too exhausted to be of any use.
The girl hesitates, avoiding meeting his eyes. Dean’s smile drops a little, immediately sensing something’s wrong.
The angel sighed. He looked at Sam, waiting for the young brother to share his opinion, but he didn’t seem to want to get in the middle of their argument. Cas could tell he agreed with Dean anyway, so he decided not to push the subject. He reminded himself that not long ago he’d thought Dean had gone off to die for them, to save them from Amara. He really hadn’t expected Dean to survive his encounter with Amara, and was beyond grateful to his Father to be back with the boys. He'd actually believed the human had died, for a while, until they got reunited again, and during that short period of time he had felt worse than when the Devil himself had killed him. The truth was he still doubted his place alongside the Winchesters, after all their arguments and the times he’d acted behind their backs, but it was still the only place he could dare call home; although he didn’t
he intentionally missed such a core part of his studies; did he have something to hide, is there something he doesn’t want Cas to know, or it simply because he’s not interested in that sort of stuff himself?
The rest just waits in awkward silence as the couple stare at each other. It’s by far the most uncomfortable dinner they’ve ever had and nobody quite knows how to deal with it, their gatherings are usually loud and merry.
his? His and some other strange woman’s kids. He imagined Cas laying with her, laughing with her, loving her, whoever
would want him to do, but if the man had taken his clothes off, maybe it was alright for him to do the same.
Unable to say no to his dom’s request, Dean complies although he still goes slow, keeping the pace pleasurable enough but without making Cas cum just yet. He edges him for a good half hour, stopping abruptly when it looks like Castiel is about to lose it, jacking him off in between breaks so his jaw can relax. Dean just loves to sit back on his heels and watch Cas breathe heavily, his beautiful naked body tensing with pleasure, his chest heaving. He wants him like this forever, completely undone by Dean’s touch, safe and happy under his watch… and maybe that of a kinky neighbour, Dean still doesn’t want to look outside the window.
“What? Good morning to you too. Aren’t you a ray of sunshine…” he mutters, openly displeased by the unwelcoming stare, as he takes a seat on the table, eyeing his best friend with confusion.
The new Dean narrowed his eyes at her and said in a mocking tone, “oh, jeez, thanks for the advice, I had not thought of that before! I’ve had the entire army of Heaven helping me and we’re losing.”
reuniting a parent with a child, just not the way he always thought he would. He’s bringing closure to those who have suffered long enough and he cannot possibly regret that.
They all stop for a moment to look at Dean, even Cas. Blood is splattered all over his face and shirt, and this utter expression of shock and horror is frozen in the hunter’s face. Gabriel waits for his reaction, wondering if he’s going to pass out or just stay there, kneeling in shock. Charlie, who has just returned, looks like she’s going to be sick from the scene she ran into.
“Yeah, that one!” Dean beams, apparently happy to have Cas not just responding to him but also offering something first for once.
He shook his head, drowning that voice. What did Sam know, after all, about Cas? Cas missed Heaven, missed his siblings. He'd go back home in a heartbeat if he wasn't so unwelcomed there for all the messes the Winchesters had dragged him into. Dean had corrupted him, he shared the angels’ opinions in that matter, but he couldn't help wishing the angel would stay nonetheless, it was a selfish desire that burned deep through his DNA, except the angel left them time and time again. How long would it last this time until Cas had other businesses to attend to? When the children left, whenever their parents came for them, would Cas leave too? Maybe Cas loved him, maybe not, but if he hadn't said anything in so long, he probably had his reasons. After all, Dean had done a lot of bad things in this world that the other version of himself hadn't. His soul was uglier, more broken. Why would an angel settle for that? Maybe Dean had been able to seduce Cas long ago when the angels looked at him with bigger expectations, when they'd considered him worthy enough to rescue him from hell, but now… What the hell did he have to offer now?
He starts apologizing frantically to everyone but especially to Dean, who has never before seen him lose his grip like this. When Dean kneels on the floor and meets his eyes, it kills Castiel to see a mix of apprehension and concern in those beautiful green eyes that usually look at him with nothing but adoration. He’s grabbing his left wrist with his right hand, he’s hurt.
going to say that to me?” Dean says coldly, because he needs to be cold if he wants to pretend Cas pulling away from him doesn’t break his heart into a million pieces.
“Only the first caller. He was quite spooked by the situation. I called him back and asked him to meet me because I thought maybe this was a case for you guys, with ghosts, you know? He couldn’t take a good look though. He said it was three children; a taller girl carrying a baby, and a boy. All he could remember was that she was blond and look about 10 years old and the kid had dark hair and was younger, probably 4 or 5 years old. He said he was about to pull over, to talk to them and retain them while he waited for a police car to pick them up, but they just disappeared as he was making the call. You should have seen the look on his face, poor guy will never travel at night again.”
The first time something incredibly freaky that Dean just didn't know how to handle had happened was when the twins were 8 months old. The cute little babies were sitting in front of the full length mirror in their daddy’s room. Dean was alone with the kids, laying on his stomach on bed early in the morning, still half asleep, as he let the children play in the floor. Henry stood up clumsily with his hands against the mirror for support. He was fascinated by his reflection and he giggled and shrieked in delight, turning to see if his dad was looking at that marvellous discovery he’d just made. Dean was, he laughed in bed, enjoying those little adorable moments when his kids were amazed by something he knew to be actually terribly mundane… That was until Henry
Another silence fell between them as they stared at each other, Josie’s cheeks blushing as much as ever. Sam looked genuinely sorry but the woman couldn't help thinking a part of her was somehow
for a moment there that something was up between them, something more than just kinky sex. All those tender touches, the gentle kisses, the comfortable silences and the phone calls, they had meant something to Dean and he thought they’d meant something for Cas too. As demanding as the dom was in bed, he’d seemed sweet and interested,
He prepared for this for years and his hard effort has finally landed him where he wanted to be. He is proud of himself, something he hasn’t been in… well,
His handsome lawyer shrugs his trenchcoat off and moves towards the kitchen. “Go lie down,” he tells Dean over his shoulder, “I’ll bring you some water.”
Jessie was an outcast, a bit of an awkward boy, pale and shy, with a father who had a terrible temper only his wife could keep in line. He didn't get along too well with the rest of the kids at school, unlike Mary, but she liked him the most out of them all nonetheless. He had a gentle, quiet soul that called out to her, and he understood her better than anyone else; though Mary seemed to fit well with the children in her class, she knew just how different she was even if they didn't, and what it was like to be peculiar and have an unconventional family other parents gossiped about. Jessie was forever grateful for Mary's friendship and didn't mind at all that she had two dads, no matter what Jessie’s dad said about them; they were kind to him, just as she was, and the two of them treasured each other.
“Me too,” Sam agrees as he forces himself to eat some scrambled eggs. For a moment Dean thinks that’s all his brother’s tired mind can come up with but then he adds, “I had a
“You okay, Cas?” he ventures cautiously, his voice barely a whisper to avoid waking the child. He taps his friend’s shoulder and signals him to follow him back to the living room.
“No, it’s not one of my brethren, I can tell. And they wouldn’t hide if they wanted my help. I don’t really have that many friends left in Heaven anyway, I don’t see why an angel would seek my help.”
Castiel sighs. They're silent for a moment before Cas stands up and starts pulling their books out from their backpacks. He shoves them in Dean’s direction, missing his face by an inch.
The angel didn’t answer right away. Instead, he stared at Dean, silently asking permission to affirm the statement. Dean swallowed hard and looked down at the letter again.
Dean’s eyes momentarily find Castiel in the crowd. He’s speaking to Gabriel, who hasn’t wasted a moment to dive in and grab a cheesy quesadilla now the birthday boy has arrived and the part has really started. Gabriel is the only one who looks slightly uncomfortable and out of place. Dean knows the witch doesn’t usually congregate with humans, except for Kali, and he’s not the most sociable of satanists, so he appreciates the effort of showing up. Although Castiel probably made him.
“Charlie!” her mom calls her. They both lift their gazes to see her talking to John, who is balancing a few items he’s purchased in his arms. “Darling, come give us a hand please.”
When that’s done, he grabs the mortar again and orders the others to remove the shirt. Dean rips his boyfriend’s shirt open with a quick and violent movement, buttons flying off in all directions. Gabriel applies the strange cream in the injuries but the one in the stomach is bleeding so much it washes the cream away.
Baltz started looking inside the backpack again, taking things out now and then; he took out a fat envelope addressed to Bobby, a few cassettes, two diapers, a bodysuit to change Zep into, one toothbrush for each kid with teeth, two packs of their favourite cookies, two jars of baby food, and, finally, in the bottom, another baby blanket. Balthazar grabbed the blanket, threw everything else back inside, and laid down across the seat with the blanket on top. Curled in on himself, the blanket covered him generously, but it would not cover Mary if she tried to use it too.
“I didn’t know Jack’s mother was pregnant. I found out about him around four months after he was born.”
. It feels good beyond human comprehension and he falls on top of Cas, breathing hard, paying no attention to the mess of Cas' release between their stomachs. The angel holds him rather unconsciously, lost in his own pleasure, when he feels a part of Dean’s soul retreating with his grace. Castiel is too stunned for a moment to make much of it, Dean’s soul still shining so bright it's almost blinding. But this little part of Dean- it's not
Josie did a double take on him, blinking a couple of times as she processed that information, wondering at first if she’d even heard him correctly. The curiosity almost overcame her but she forced her mouth shut, knowing it'd probably be too out line if she asked how he'd died and why. However it had happened, surely it couldn’t be a happy story. Time would tell, she figured, or she hoped. If their friendship blossomed, Sam would share the story with her, perhaps, in due time. The woman could see the constrain in his face, the worry in the lines on the corners of his eyes. Was he worried of what she was going to think of him?
Castiel just sits there in his bed with a confused expression on his face. His seriously official bed, in his new apartment he shared with Dean.
Dean woke up with his arms and legs entangled with Castiel's, his head buried on the other's man neck and most of his his body on top of the angel’s, pinning him to the bed. He didn't move for a while as his brain slowly started to regain consciousness. Something in him naively reasoned that if he didn't move a muscle, if he pretended he was still sleeping, perhaps he could stay there forever, and that sounded really appealing. He felt warm and comfortable, and the skin on skin contact felt like an unspoken but very real confession of love. But soon enough Castiel's hand started moving up and down his back when the angel noticed the change in Dean's breathing, a subtle cue that gave the man away.
Dean chuckles but quickly gulps on a sob. He looks down again, burying his face on his hands, ashamed of crying in front of his dad and worried sick about Castiel.
could. Cas spent years under that roof with that book, the answer right in front of him only hidden away due to his harmless nature that kept him from touching that awful book. But Gabriel had to know this spell, so did his father, his
Even though he knows it will fail, Castiel still practises the spell. He memorizes the words and prepares the ingredients they’ll need to take with them. Gabriel cooked him meals for over 10 years and took him to school every day, he held Castiel when he cried and asked for his parents, he taught him all he knew about magic and immediately forgave him every time Castiel’s magic got out of hand and caused trouble or even pain for him. He’s always been there for Cas so if he has to put on a show for his brother, he will. It’s the least he can do.
Dean’s eager nodding endears his boyfriend, who cannot help but chuckle and give Dean a loving look that has his heart skipping a bit. Cas moves his hands so that the tip of his fingers touch Dean’s temple at either side and he closes his eyes, indicating Dean to do the same.
“Can I help with anything, dad?” she asked Dean softly. The man looked down at her, moved by the nickname; how sweet it was of her to still call him that.
Dean squirmed, feeling like an idiot being asked that question. He wanted to reply something sarcastic that would make him feel masculine and tough, something like, “what are we, Sammy, 15 years old girls?”, but he couldn’t because the truth was, Castiel
But as time goes by, there are more things to worry about too. Their destinies feel a little less their own and a little more fixed by their natures. Dean starts to get really nervous about his future. All Alphas are required to join the military service, to serve for at least a couple of years, right after finishing school or their college education. The ever growing boy starts counting down the years, the months, until his inescapable departure.
Baltz observed her as he ate. She’d brought him sandwiches and water, which he was very grateful for, and had convinced the boy to let Zep rest in a baby car seat after Balthazar himself had insisted in giving his little brother the baby bottle she’d prepared. It would be the only thing the boy would agree to; he didn’t want his brother out of his sight, would not for anything in the world allow Mrs. Anderson to put him in a crib in another room while they spoke, and, truth be told, the poor social worker didn’t dare push the boy into something he didn’t want to do. There was this strange air about him, this power emanating from him she couldn’t comprehend, and peculiar things seemed to happen whenever she tried to separate the brothers.
“I should have chosen Heaven, this is unbearable,” Castiel mutters to himself. The towel in his forehead slides down over his eyes. He lets out an annoyed grunt from the back of his throat, like it’s such a bother, and puts it back in place.
popping in his mind once or twice, but the more he thinks about it the more he convinces himself he did see someone looking at him through the window and he’ll be damned if he skips this perfect opportunity to get a one on one with Clarice or Charles after waiting his entire goddamn life for it.
“Come on, let’s decide what toys we’ll take to the playground, my love,” the witch told him and grabbed his hand before walking out of the kitchen, looking over her shoulder to wink an eye at Dean before she disappeared.
, God just made them. Now that he really thinks of it, he’s not entire sure. He knows nothing about graces, or souls really.
he thought, but he couldn’t bring himself to regret any of his choices nor any of the millions of kisses he’d shared with Castiel.
When Charlie finally turns around and sees the stains in her mother’s papers, she freaks out and runs after her.
Castiel takes the cup of tea from his hands and leads Dean to bed. Still somewhat in shock, Dean goes willingly, not fighting it at all when Cas puts the covers over him and turns the lights off. Despite all odds, Dean succumbs to mental exhaustion faster than he would have imagined possible. He’s just somewhat resigned with the situation, a part of him still trying to convince him that he’s imagining all of this. He prays that he’ll wake up and this would have all been a fever dream or a very bizarre drunken hallucination but when he opens his eyes in the morning Castiel is there on his couch, sipping tea as he stares out the window peacefully.
He practically flees through the back door leading into the garden and quickly moves away from the party. Just when he’s rounding the exterior of the house towards the front door, Cas calls him. It’s 11 pm on the dot. Dean likes to imagine Castiel waiting for the right time to call him, the thought makes him smile.
As he drove to Bobby’s old place, Jody sent him the coordinates from where the 911 calls had originated. One wasn’t very far from Bobby’s, and it was in fact on Sam’s way there; the other wasn’t even a day away from town. He checked the first spot on his way to the salvage yard, but there didn’t seem to be anyone wandering around, no clues that he could work with, so the young man kept driving.
it but he just doesn’t care. If anything, he finds a little comfort in its power, the proof that even though he chose Dean—and automatically lost him, like an idiot—his magic is still there, intact and formidable. He’s not sure how he will lose it but he knows he will one day, he’s seen it, but today he’s powerful and strong enough to make the ground beneath him rattle and shake the entire house.

“Thank you, child, thank you! You know what this means?” Balthazar shook his head. “I could get my old job back, son!”
Dean rereads the phrase a dozen times, half expecting the words to change or fade away, but no, they are there, right in front of him, immutable and everlasting.
Back in the bunker, a little earlier, Cas wandered into Dean’s bedroom after Zep accidently-on-purpose took a fist of baby food and threw it right at him.
really intrigues me. Or second dad," he winks at Dean, who blushes furiously, causing the demon to chuckle. "Hey, I don't judge."
“Did you find Cas?” Sam asks again rather distractedly as he gazes out the window, getting familiar with the town and its surroundings.
A part of Dean wishes he could go with Sam but he finds his own locker instead, gets his books and heads to class. He’s a few minutes early and he could swear his fellow students turn quiet when he enters the room. He considers saying a general hello but suddenly finds himself wishing he was invisible again; he finally has their attention, but the looks on their faces are not very welcoming at all. If he didn’t know better he’d say they were talking about him, but how could that be? They don’t even know him enough to have something to say.
“And you think that I don't?” Dean huffs a laugh but there’s nothing funny about the look in his face. He holds Cas close, resting his forehead against the other’s. Oh, how he's going to miss the weight of Castiel on top of him...
“No, you stay here. I don't want to overwhelm him. I'll be right back, Baltz, I promise. Just- let me talk to Jessie, okay? Look after Zep. I won't be long.”
Without enthusiasm Cas mutters a dry thanks. He can’t deny there’s something about being complimented by a handsome person like Dean that does things to Castiel’s ego. Dean’s one of those beautiful people who you just know will only keep getting more and more gorgeous as they grow up, probably effortlessly. It would be awesome if Cas wasn’t so damn attracted to him, like he imagines most mortals with two eyes and a brain cell must be. Dean’s perfect tanned skin, white straight teeth, great jawline and model-like smile are almost offensive to Cas.
“Papa!” Balthazar broke into tears as his father finally seemed to recognise him. He jumped into his arms, throwing his arms around Cas' neck and burying his face in the angel’s neck. Castiel could see the pain twisting his soul and it made his heart
Mary had had enough, and the tears in her eyes were piling up as fast as her disappointment. She didn’t want to burst in tears in the kitchen like a little girl (although, she
“Hey, what do you say you and me go for a ride, huh? Listen to some songs, get some ice-cream maybe?”
Charlie slips her hand under the table and grabs his. He knows she still has something to say about his behaviour but for now at least she keeps it to herself and offers him a comforting smile.
Sam snorted and bent over himself, laughing and shaking his head. Josie couldn't help but laugh, though she punched him on the shoulder.
His brother turns around then, face full of rage for getting blamed. “Because I never thought you’d be stupid enough to summon a demon, for Satan’s sake! Without even checking with me first!”
. You’ve been blowing him off all week so get your ass upstairs and talk to him. He’s waiting for you.”
“I'm not very good at this,” he replies, rubbing the back of his neck while he gives her an apologetic look that doesn't match the interest in her eyes. If he is even aware she is flirting with him, Castiel doesn't seem interested, which makes Dean oddly proud of being the only one he seems to be interested in. “How about you go again instead?”
Dean punches him in the arm (not really hard, obviously) and growls without really meaning it, “no reading at the table, nerd.”
The boy tried moving his wings forwards. They obeyed, moving forwards to close around the child, and suddenly Balthazar felt with his hands on the ground as if he’d been pushed by some invisible force.
“I know, I know,” Mary offered him a small, sympathetic smile. “But they’re not really a part of your body. Maybe we should have started with detachment exercises…”
“Yeah, you don’t say,” Dean smiles nervously but inside he’s kind of terrified of what John’s going to say.
“It’s closed!” Balthazar exclaimed, looking inside the empty mall with wide eyes, his breath misting the glass door. There were a couple of lights on here and there, but it was obviously closed and empty by now. The child was about to lose it.
The realization suddenly hits him and everything clicks in his mind, suddenly it all makes sense, it’s so obvious he wants to slap himself for not realizing it sooner.
“Sam,” she interrupted him, looking up at him while he looked down at her. He opened his mouth to speak but before the man could say a word, she pressed her lips against his. She didn’t know what had come to her, but damn, his sad puppy face was shortcutting the wires in her brain. She hated that look in his face.
“The rules are as follows; you can only make three questions and the answer to your questions can only be yes or no. You may ask anything you want, pertaining to the past, present or future. You have already asked me one question, if I know the reason why your mother gave the key away and the answer is yes. I won’t overlook this, you only have two questions left.”
As Dean walks past him, he gives Castiel’s shoulder an encouraging tap. “Come on, man, I don’t bite.”
There was silence for a moment. The words went around and around in Dean’s mind, and it felt like a fucking stab in the gut.
Billie extends her hand in his direction as Castiel wipes his tears with the back of his hand, ready and all too happy to get this all over with and put it in the past, to go back to the natural order of things.
“Nice to meet you!” Dean yells after her kind of lamely, wishing he could talk to her for a little longer. There’s a friendly, welcoming vibe about her he’s desperately been looking for in someone his age.
Once again their eyes meet but the moment’s gone, they’re not going to kiss again. Except Cas really wants to.
Hi guys. I am going on a little trip for a few days so I'm not sure I'll be able to update. Maybe yes, maybe no, we'll see, but either way I won't be gone long.
“Who?” Castiel asks, his frown deepening as he tilts his head to the side. It makes Dean smile, he looks…
Josie pulled away and walked around the car to stand next to the passenger’s door, then looked at Sam expectantly. Sam sighed but after a moment accepted his defeat; he just couldn’t do it, couldn’t bring himself to tell her to go away, leave him, because for once in his life he
Back in his room, he wondered if he should look for Dean, resume the conversation they’d had earlier, but he told himself not to be so pathetic, so eager. Dean would either come to him when he was ready to talk, or he wouldn’t, meaning there was nothing else to talk about. If the man didn’t want him, Cas would understand and respect that, but if all that was keeping Dean at bay was stupid, homophobic fears… It angered him. Dean wasn’t homophobic, he’d never said a single word against same-sex couples in all the years Cas had accompanied him, and had never looked down on couples that passed them in the street, so why was it so wrong for him to
Mary threw her arms around his neck and laughed, completely overcome with joy, but little by little, the sum of the past events caught up with her, and she started trembling with all the sadness she’s bottled up until then. Dean held her tightly, running a hand up and down her back.
Early in the morning, Mary went for more food, and after that the little Winchesters said goodbye to the man and went on their way south to go home.
Sam gives Castiel a sympathetic look before hurrying to catch up with Dean. Even though he doesn’t want the door to Hell opened either, he also didn’t like the way Dean raised his voice at Cas.
Castiel’s trying to fight back his laughter as Dean comes into the kitchen holding the dog in one arm. Ozzy has his tongue out, tail wiggling from side to side happily. Dean’s looking down at him, confused.
. She considered her options… There really wasn’t that many people she knew. Grandpa Bobby was nowhere to be found… Castiel wouldn’t respond to their prayers… Uncle Sam and Dean could be anywhere… She couldn’t remember exactly where aunt Jody lived, they usually met her at Bobby’s… That only left her friends from school, one in particular, her best-friend Jessie, but Mary wondered if he’d recognise her at all in this universe. She wondered where the other versions of themselves were in this universe and how odd it’d be to run into them. She even tried praying to this universe's version of herself but, once again, no one answered.
Mary Winchester spent the entire day trying to distract her brother. Balthazar was not happy at all with the sudden disappearance of his entire family, except for Josie, who took same days off work to hang out with the kids in the bunker. She thought she was babysitting them, but in all honestly, Mary kept a careful eye on Zep in case his grace acted out and accidentally hurt the woman. He didn’t, though. He was a perfectly good boy the entire day.
“Yeah, well, you’re just a grump now. Another poor bastard trying to make it through college without knowing how to feed themselves after leaving the nest.”
A glimmer in the lion’s eyes accompanied by an impatient change in his position gives Cas hope that he’s heading in the right direction. He’s getting closer to the truth. His mother didn’t just outright betray them, something forced her hand. What did she learn and
"Bye," Balthazar said back at him while Mary only lazily waved as angel and man retreated back to the car.
"I... I took the souls," Cas confessed with shame, suddenly busying himself with Zep again. "It didn't go very well."
“Problem is, I don’t think they know about witches and hunters. I’ve had Seir keep an eye on them all week and they seem pretty normal.”
“Oh, God, my angels! You’re okay, thank God!” he said and let out a hysterical chuckle, pulling his kids impossibly closer in an almost death grip. He never wanted to let go of them again. The kids had thrown their arms around his neck and were leaning against him as he showered them with kisses.
Jack's father nods and takes a deep, calming breath. He still looks exhausted, but there's something slightly different about him, he seems a little less miserable. Dean is glad to have helped, that's what he does for a living after all, even if he’s still pretty much dying inside.
“I’m sorry, Balthazar,” she patted his back in an attempt to comfort him. The kid ended up vomiting twice (Mary cleaned him twice) and then broke into tears. She didn’t know what to tell him; he was in pain and tired, and nothing she could said would change that. The older Winchester tried not to dwell in her own feelings much as she started to feel overwhelmed by the situation, because she was feeling guiltier by the minute by her incapacity to keep her brothers happy and in a good shape. “I’ll be right back.”
Dean doesn’t need to be told twice. He starts slow, kissing the inside of Castiel’s thighs, getting close to his dick but not close enough, just loving the frustration emanating from Cas, the way he holds his breath when Dean
“I think I’d know,” he finished with a dry, sarcastic edge. “They’re not mine, I haven’t been intimate with anyone.”
“That’s not what I said at all,” Cas replies, raising his eyebrows and giving him a pointed look. “You know what I mean.”
“There’s a party tonight and I want you to come with me,” he declares, no room for discussion on his tone this time.
He can’t help but smile to himself, finding the situation weird but also funny. As promised, he keeps the door of his room open and sits on his bed while Bela takes the chair at his desk. She seems so out of place there, with her fancy clothes and her nice perfume and her polished nails in contrast with his rock bands posters, second-hand furniture and stained walls they still need to paint.
. They were asking so nicely, though, and it was true they would need help facing Lucifer if he came into their world...
The thing is attacking him. It’s coming for him another time but he puts his hands up and stops it just in time. Cas actually struggles against the force that’s moving the metal body towards him, it’s something really powerful. There’s a mechanical sound of something breaking, the gears failing under the push of the two forces, the one that wants to move it against the young boy and the one that’s trying to stop it.
, a demand, and Mrs. Anderson allowed the boy to make that decision. It wasn’t unusual in her line of work to see siblings being overly protective of each other; sometimes, each other was
As Castiel turns his back on him one more time, Dean feels the impulse to go after him, push him against the wall and finish that fight with a kiss, not deafening silence. Castiel turns the doorknob and opens the door, one foot out the room already.
“Yes!” Dean answered, a little smile coming to his lips; if Sam knew that, he had to know about his children too, they must have explained, maybe they were even expecting him. “You’ve seen my children, right? Please tell me you’ve found my children! I went to Bobby’s and- and-”
The other universe’s Dean swallowed hard but nodded; he hated thinking Cas may be dead, or would die soon, and didn’t mind dying if he could protect his children… But if there was a way he could avoid leaving his kids orphans, and it was offered to him like that, so easily… There was nothing he wanted more than to watch his children be safe and grow old.
“Dean!” she smiles but suddenly her expression changes into one of embarrassment as she catches herself. “Oh, I’m so sorry! I mean, your Royal Highness.”
The man in front of him gets terribly close, pressing him flat against the wall in a way that would have been totally hot if it
The rest of the week is spent with the same amount of nerves as the weekend. Novak could show up anywhere at any given moment and Dean wont get any kind of warning until the last minute. As the days go by and Castiel doesn't so much as text him, it only feeds the uneasy feeling nesting in his gut instead of easing it. The longer they're separated, the sooner Dean feels Castiel will show up, ironically.
. Time goes by and they don’t have so much as a small disagreement, not one political idea that they don’t see eye to eye with, which is odd because Cas is very passionate about his values and that usually doesn’t sit well with people, but Dean lets him go on and on about anything he wants, and in exchange, Dean tells him all about the movies he likes and the books Cas will have to read some day so they can talk some more about them, even though Dean’s completely spoiled them for him already. Even when they’re in bad moods, stressed over midterms, they still manage to be civil with each other.
It all goes downhill from there. His brother tells him to suit up because they’re going to meet with Jack’s father and his lawyer. Dean can barely walk straight, his legs feel like jelly as he follows his brother through corridors of the fancy, old building where he works. He feels disoriented and lightheaded. Finally, they come into a room where a woman with dark hair and a mean stare is waiting for them with a tall guy with eyes as blue as Jack’s. His suit is way nicer than Dean’s and he can smell money all the way from the door. The man looks past them for a moment, waiting for someone else to come in, then back at them, clearly disappointed when he doesn’t see the baby. Dean just feels like bolting.
Seeing how his fiancé worries about his wellbeing makes Dean smile. “I really am. After what happened at my birthday -”
In an attempt to spare Cas from answering any more questions that clearly made him uncomfortable, Sam cleared his throat and changed the subject before anyone asked anything else on the matter. Instead, he turned Mary and asked, "so, Mary, you go to school?"
What should be a quick and easy trip to the store around the corner turns into a hunt for the perfect tea Cas wants. He doesn’t just want
The next day they’re at it again, Cas’ place this time. Novak invites him over for dinner (which is practically cooked by Dean) to tell him that he’ll be travelling to a Conference starting that same Friday for a week. Something drops inside Dean’s stomach; he only has Cas for a little over two more weeks and he’s going to lose 7 entire days of his dom during that time?
“Come on, don’t be a party pooper,” Pamela teases him. “Besides, it’ll be a good way to get to know Novak.”
While Dean’s out with Charlie one night, he ventures into his roommate’s bedroom one more time to meddle with his belongings. This time he chooses something that he thinks is absolutely replaceable and has no sentimental value or important things hidden inside it; Dean’s underwear. That’s mistake number one because  when he pulls the drawer out until it’s almost about to fall from where it’s hanging from the dresser, at the bottom of it, hidden behind a mountain of socks, there’s a long, small box with an illustration on the side of a very realistic dildo. Cas gulps, pretends he doesn’t see it, then convinces himself he is
"I- the other me- didn't come with them. They're looking for him- well, for me, I suppose." Dean screwed up his face in confusion as Castiel talked. "They pray to their father, in reality, not me, but I'm the one who hears when they call me by my name. Prayers can't be heard across universes. That'd be really confusing."
When their twins were born, Castiel and Dean decided each of them can name one baby, so Dean called one of the kids Henry after his grandfather and Castiel called the second boy Raziel.
guy and pressure Dean though, so he tries to cope in other ways. For example, he reads a lot to keep his mind busy, he avoids spending the night with Dean if possible and prefers to hang out with his boyfriend when there are also other people around. He exercises his magic, learning to control hellfire and playing with it. He also works out several times a week to blow off some steam. He’s getting fit which Dean notices and compliments him about, ogling Cas while he bites his lip in a way that instead of helping makes matters much worse for Castiel. He pleasures himself too, obviously, but it doesn’t help unwind for long.
He wants to tell Castiel he's never submitted before, that he was mostly always in charge in his past sexual encounters, that he’s a grown ass strong man, but the truth is it doesn't matter anymore and he knows it. What matters is what he wants now, the twisted new fantasies in his mind, all featuring Castiel as the dominant one.
“Shit,” he sighs and runs a hand down his face. It makes him physically sick to even imagine the possibility of losing Cas. And what for? A fake reputation?
How can he tell Dean? How can Castiel even begin to explain what he's done? He got so caught up in the physical pleasure and the irresistible calling on Dean’s loving soul- he hadn't meant to steal a piece, he hadn't meant to create life.
She stopped at the baby section and wondered if she should take some diapers with her, but then decided it was going to be easier to just continue to clean Zep with grace. She nearly panicked as she scanned the aisle, wondering if there was something of vital importance she should need to take care of the baby, but she had no idea, so she continued without taking anything but a new pacifier.
“Of course, of course. He must be busy,” the man said like it was obvious, nodding to himself as he walked towards the door. Mary eyed him with curiosity, and also trying not to show how much she disliked him.
Castiel rolls his eyes. Before he can help himself, he finds himself saying, “no, Dick, he’s lived here for less than two weeks. Your dad being the mayor doesn’t make you a celebrity, no one cares.”
“Dean, I think I know… Remember I told you Mary had a meltdown at the library? She caused an earthquake that day. The demons made the connection before, so did we, they’re probably following that lead.”
The tone of Gabriel’s voice doesn’t do anything to ease Castiel’s anxiety; if anything, it makes it worse. There’s something carefully controlled about it, like he’s actually emotional but doing his best not to show it at all.
Mary pinched the guy with her grace, making him jump. He looked around, confused, then nodded and headed to the door while Mary pulled the wagon into the adjacent room, followed by Balthazar.
Cas continues to fidget with the hem of his shirt. He’s finding it hard to lie and pretend it’s all good.
Also, had to add a chapter because I realised I had to break one into two, otherwise it would be super long.
As father and son gaze into each other’s eyes, Castiel feels his heart pick up its pace. He wants to tell his dad what he found out, what his mother deducted all those years ago, the reason why they’re all in this mess. The truth is hanging from the tip of his tongue but the moment his dad asks him what he means, Cas knows he’s not going to tell him. It’d be a mistake. He’s already answered Castiel’s question anyway; nothing he or his brothers did could ever be bad enough for his dad to forsake them or maybe he wouldn’t even think them capable of such a thing, which makes him
A pang of guilt twitched in the man’s stomach, but his son was throwing his arms around his waist and he couldn’t help but think it was somehow the right decision.
Sam was beginning to explain some new biology concepts when the young woman came back with the pie and the coffee.
“Alright,” the woman gave him an encouraging smile and continued writing in the notebook that laid in front of her.
Seir caws twice and shuffles closer to Cas, eyes staring around the dark vegetation with caution. Cas stops at the stairs leading up into the park. It’s faster to go through rather than around but as he stops to pay attention to his surroundings, which are absolutely deserted and quiet, the unsettling feeling that he’s not alone starts creeping up his spine. A second later, the light of the street lamp at the foot of the stairs starts flickering. Seir caws again, something like a warning.
He was in a kind of haze, feeling like he was outside of his body looking all around himself at once, as he let himself be led into a car by Dean, and then they were taken into a police station with a caravan of police cars behind them. Castiel wanted to scream, to break something, not because he’d almost being killed, but because he realised the most beautiful thing, the
“Darling, we know you’re out of grace. We can do this the easy or the hard way,” he said as he walked towards her with a cocky attitude.
“I’ll always protect you, Cas,” he continues through the lump of nerves in his throat. He’s never sounded this nervous before and it’s music in Castiel’s ears, it’s sweet. “Good Alphas protect their Omegas.”
With a playful wink, she wants out, closing the door behind him, leaving Dean with some privacy to go through the papers, which he is grateful for as he starts reading the party rules. The list is quite long and his eyes fly through the sentences, skipping the obvious ones like ‘
Cas lets the shirt slip down his shoulders and arms and fall to the ground. As soon as his skin is out in the open, Dean sucks in a breath when his eyes first land in a long bruise on Castiel’s shoulder. That’s the side that hit the wall when the first mechanical part hit him. When Dean’s eyes land on the quickly growing dark spots on his boyfriend’s stomach, he’s speechless. His hands reach out to touch, to comfort, but Castiel quickly grabs his wrists to stop him.
Dean blinks a couple of times as Rowena turns around and disappears through the heavy doors, wondering again what the hell he is getting himself into.
“I don’t… hate you,” he eventually says as Dean pulls over by the gates. Inside his house, the lights are on, Gabe’s waiting for him. From the corner of his eye he sees Dean’s about to say something, probably ask him why he acts the way he does then if it’s not because he dislikes Dean, but Cas nearly jumps out of the car to avoid questions he can’t answer. He throws his backpack over his shoulder, glad to be home for the first time all day. “Thank you for the ride. Good night, Dean.”
Castiel went into a small bathroom in the precinct and looked at himself in the mirror for a long minute. He was disgusted by his blood-stained face and quickly began to try to wash it off. He washed his cheeks, moving his hands slowly against the right side of his jaw because it hurt too much from the punch, then his hair, his neck, but there was nothing he could do for his shirt, he would have to throw that one away. He washed his hands, hissing in pain as he rubbed his bruised knuckles. He stood there with his hands gripping the sink tightly, letting his head fall forwards in defeat. He started to feel it, the beginning of a panic attack. He hadn't had one in years and it wasn't a fun ride. He ran a hand through his hair, breathing rapidly as he tried to contain his feelings. He needed air, he needed to run, to get away from this feeling, from everything.
Castiel inserts the plug as far as it'll go and smacks his hand hard on Dean's ass. He moans and yelps, barely giving any resistance as Castiel pushes him onto his back. When Dean opens his eyes, Novak is straddling his lap, undoing his belt and zipper in a hurry.
Castiel flings the door open. A cold wind of air rushes in, leaving Dean cold to the bone. Cas steps into the night, slamming the door behind him, and disappears into the dark. Dean moves to run after him, unable to speak through the lump in his throat, but John, suddenly materializing by his side, puts an arm around the front of his chest and grounds him to his spot.
“A witch?” Josie repeated, a little uncertain, looking up at Sam for reassurance. That was probably the woman she saw in Sam’s car.
The boy’s eyes turned unnaturally blue, even more than usual, and light started to glow from within him, casting long shadows of his impressive, fully-grown wings on the ground.
“You saw your life with Dean, didn’t you? What would happen if you stayed in the mortal world, by his side?” Cas nods in affirmation. His dad continues, “it happens to witches sometimes, when they have mortal soulmates. A person can have more than one true love in their lifetime, especially when you live as long as we do… I guess for us it’s not a matter of finding the one but having the courage to do something about it.”
Balthazar grinned, quickly forgetting about the other boy. “Okay,” he said, taking the car back and offering another. “This is my favorite. Do you want it?”
Their minds made up, the brothers pick up Cas again, each throwing one of the witch’s arms over their shoulders, and with Seir leading the way, they venture into the tunnel. In their haste, minds too busy with an overwhelming list of things they’re worried about and Castiel’s life hangs from a thread, both of them forget to grab the key and take it with them. Out of sight, out of mind; Dean forgets it there where he left it, positioned in the keyhole, hiding behind the now opened door.
“No,” Dean repeats. His other hand curls into a fist. His eyes are wild with anger, confusion and hurt. He turns towards the bed, grabbing his shirt before he storms out of the room. He stops by the door and glances back at him. Looking at Cas over his shoulder and trying to keep his voice in check, he says, “I can’t believe you went this far for this frigging—I thought we—”
The kids nodded silently, a general and unusual sadness about them. Both siblings felt terribly uneasy separating from their parents once again. For what the looks in their parents' faces were worth, so did they.
For a moment their eyes meet. The silence is not tense but is surely charged with something Dean can’t quite figure out. He kind of blushes and looks down.
The Winchester brothers stare at each other as if the other can provide the answer to that question. They’re both torn, especially Sammy, who’s usually much more rational about things compared to Dean, the most emotional and impulsive out of the two of them. It’s crazy, it’s stupid, it’s
“Things don’t just blow over! They get archived and resurface, every time something happens, they keep lists of every little mistake, every rumour, any sign of weakness. It’s like you don’t know your place at all!”
Dean just stands there, confused, thinking of an answer. “What the hell is that even supposed to mean?”
Rowena couldn’t help but chuckle a little hysterically; of all the weird things she’d heard and seen, this had to be at the top.
The blonde laid the sleeping bag in the grass, not too far from the side of the road, and sat there with a deep sight. She watched dark gray clouds approaching from the horizon and instantly regretted leaving the tent at the mall. Zep, always oblivious to his sister’s worries, laid on his belly, (barely) lifting himself up to look up at her and give her a toothless smile. She reached for his cheek and stroke it gently. Dean always said his son was an ever-happy baby, Mary remembered, and her chest constricted as it always did when she thought of her missing family.
you you had a broken rib,” Dean scolds him severely, huffing in frustration. “Dude, we should have gone to the hospital.”
Either way, by the end of his second week there Dean’s pretty much given up on the idea of making friends. Not
"Darling, don’t worry, we've found a way to stop him, but we need to go back to grandpa's house. That's where he will cross to universe. When he gets here, we'll kill him, once and for all."
Dean didn’t so much as pretended he was going to help Sam pick up the dirty dishes. He got up and almost ran to the couch, closely followed by his middle son. He connected the computer to the TV he’d purchased a while ago (now Sam couldn’t say it’d been a waste of money!) and played one of his all time favourite westerns. Eventually, Rowena and Castiel joined them. The angel sat next to Dean, the sides of their legs touching as he moved closer to the man to make room for the witch. Dean was more aware of the contact than he’d like to admit, and he found himself rather distracted every time the angel moved to accommodate the fidgeting baby in his arms, their legs brushing together. Balthazar laid on the floor, his hands behind his head, watching the movie with a wide grin. Apparently Dean had showed him this one before because the child would sometimes pretend he was a gunman himself, drawing his gun (his hand, really) at the same time than the characters in the movie, and would say something that was surprisingly close to the actors’ actual lines. From the corner of his eyes, he could see Mary sitting in a chair, a book in her lap. Her eyes were on the book, but she was mumbling the lines under her breath too. Dean felt somehow predictable, but at the same time kind of satisfied that his children seemed to be as into the movie as he was. Even Sam joined them at some point, although he sat in a chair far away.
