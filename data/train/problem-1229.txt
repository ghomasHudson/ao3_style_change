(John knows it will make Sherlock uncomfortable. It’s part of what turns them both on about all of this, or it usually is; today it doesn’t feel like arousing in the least, because Sherlock’s already been exposed, humiliated and denied, and it hadn’t been within the bounds of what they’d - almost - managed to negotiate during earlier half-conversations.)
. It had been sharing, even if Sherlock's sharing was based on the false assumptions John held.
“I'm not--”
Gripping the doorframe, Sherlock manages to get himself into the bathroom, locking the door behind him before allowing himself to take it all in, sinking down on the lid of the toilet.
With his lips around Sherlock’s cock and with Sherlock's stifled moans resonating in his ears, John is aware that he really ought to know better.
Actions are what matters, and they will always be John’s prefered mean of communication. Still, John is slowly growing aware that they aren’t always enough.
Sherlock is pacing.
What would this feel like if he let himself think constantly of John while doing it?
Before he has the chance to go through the textbook once more, attempting to find what he must have missed, that one detail that will explain everything and enable him to finally understand what it is that makes every part of his life seem to be out of tune with his surroundings and even with himself, Sherlock is distracted by looking for an answer elsewhere.
Self-destructive behavior may also manifest itself in an active attempt to drive away other people. For example, they may fear that they will "mess up" a relationship. Rather than deal with this fear, socially self-destructive individuals engage in annoying or alienating behavior, so that others will reject them first. More obvious forms of self-destruction are eating disorders, alcohol abuse, drug addictions, sex addiction, self-injury, and suicide attempts.
By his feet, Sherlock is waiting while John fights his own thoughts. His head is angled to the side where John must have been pulling even harder on Sherlock’s hair without realising. Sherlock is waiting, and John is waiting too, but he’s not sure what he’s waiting for. Perhaps for a plan, for an idea on how to go about this now that he knows that he can - but he still doesn’t know, not really, because ‘whatever you want to do to me is fine by me unless I say otherwise’ is not the answer he had needed to hear. He needs to know where the limits are, but Sherlock thinks that limits are like rubberbands and therefore only something to employ in order to annoy others, to snap them in people’s faces.
I might have bollocksed up both tenses and other things here. Feel free to let me know in that case.
- The contradiction between what Sherlock wants sexually and what he thinks is appropriate and safe to display
“You’re not the only one who can pick up on things, you know,” John says, the intent behind his words fairly obvious.
John's words are now completely inaudible, a sure sign that he’s either feeling deflated or is even more dangerously close to harming someone.
It only takes John a second to accept this new direction in the conversation - the unexpected consultation. Sherlock generally prefers his own opinion - for good reasons - but he's not blind to John's competence, or rather to John's complex and sometimes paradoxical skills. Does he let it show?
“What about you?” John says just as the silence begins to settle between them.
They both freeze for a second, John already halfway out of the cellar window, then he hastily resumes crawling, assisted by Sherlock.
And perhaps he shouldn't.
“Right, the poisoning,” Lestrade says, aiming for neutral but not quite managing to hide the tone of disbelief and slight amusement. “Something for us to investigate?”
“Not dove. Probably horse.”
Pressure
Looking out of the window of the cab, all he sees is a reflection of himself and the back of John's head as John too is looking out of the window.
(Anticipation? An unspoken request for--)
The removal of the pills seems to indicate that perhaps it matters.
His gaze catches on the white and yellow box just before he closes the drawer of his night table, having returned the lubricant to its place in the back.
If they hadn't gotten caught in the collar of Sherlock's T-shirt... The fabric is threadbare, and Sherlock would have been able to feel the warmth - would almost have been able to feel each fingerprint - had they continued to move down his collarbone, over his pectoral, reaching--
With a sense of surrealism, he pays the driver as the cab pulls over to Barts and begins walking towards the morgue without waiting for the other two, just to escape the pressing silence for just a few seconds.
“A poisoning? Really?”
Sherlock was aware of his own prejudices, but it still baffled him to realise that someone so completely…
(And if he can determine what the problem is, there's also a possibility that he might be able to find a fix.)
“It never occurred to you that you could have, well, I don’t know… talked to me about it?”
This chapter is partially prompted by a discussion with pennypaperbrain about Sherlock's motivations for enjoying pain in sexual contexts, and if that in any way ties into his self-destructive behaviours and/or self-harm. I wanted to clarify that a bit, which is why this chapter, which I initially planned to execute in quite a different (and more disturbing) way moved here and why it took another form than I had planned.
A flash drive. Finally, something that might--
Selma’s voice is now almost cheerful, which John finds more worrying than if she’d attempted a more threatening tune of voice.
Another interesting idea would be learning what she looks like when she's too far gone in pleasure to care about such fleeting things as her own facial expression. She has a responsive face, that much is obvious after having watched her features shift as she reads on her phone.
When Sherlock speaks again, his voice is carefully neutral, indifferent.
If Sherlock is not sure that this is the right, or the Right, thing to do, then he’s at least more than tired of making John doubt himself.
The strain in John’s voice, the voice he uses when he's so close to the edge of losing control, makes the decision easy.
His own motivation is plain enough, even to himself; he’s postponing the reflux of greyness case by case, day by day.
John’s words comes with a shaky smile, but Sherlock’s imagination disregards every trace of fondness behind the words, and what he instead hears is a firm command.
He shuts his laptop, tosses it aside on the covers next to him, then adjusts its position.
It’s Lestrade. A short text notifying Sherlock that the lead he’d sent earlier that morning, asking the Yard to track down an IP-address, had led to a hit.
“What if I didn’t?”
“You need any help with that?” John asks neutrally, his arms folded across his chest, his eyes on the buildings that flash by outside the window.
Not beta read, and no matter how many times I read it, I find new errors. The English Language and I are currently having a domestic.
John raises his eyebrows inquiringly.
It’s easier like this, and it shouldn’t be. It shouldn’t be easier to shag someone simply because you can use them however you like. It shouldn’t be a turn on to grab someone by the hair and hold them still. There are so many things that shouldn’t be, but still are.
The tingles reappear, the single word from John leaving no room for ambiguity.
Pushing himself up from his angled, crouching position, Sherlock can feel the resistance of John’s hands give as the grip eases and John must be attempting to take a step back to give Sherlock some space. But before John’s has a chance to do so, Sherlock’s already pushing him away whilst shifting until he’s standing almost upright, facing John with eyes still blurred by the pain and his breath heaving in his chest, his hands fumbling behind him until they find the edge of the table he’s now propping himself up against.
John's still, and Sherlock doesn’t want him to be, so he lets his own hand feel every inch of John’s cock, fingering the foreskin that's retracting, feeling the dampness and the wrinkled skin. And he tightens his fingers, encircling, stroking. John’s breath becomes faster, and there's a slight tremor in the hand that's still unmoving with its fingers on the cleft of Sherlock’s buttocks.
9.37 am.
“Ehm, well, I guess it doesn’t.”
“Nah, don’t think so, that would look totally different. Why do you think I didn’t make a big deal out of what he said about me? And why do you think he said it? And why did he say those things to Eva?”
“I really am surprised to see you here,” Nadine adds as an afterthought.
The voice of… - Philip? -
He might have been high and malnourished and even a bit incoherent at that point, but it’d seemed such a pleasant way to go, and death was inevitable anyway. Might as well live a short but ultimately more bearable life.
Lisbeth, the nurse, glared at John for dumping a clearly agitated middle-aged pensioner on her. Without so much as a word, John shut himself in his office. He knew he’d been supremely unprofessional, and he usually prided himself on his professionalism. At least when John could be bothered to show up to work, he did. He squeezed his eyes shut and blocked out the gloom of his tiny, dim office. He needed to pull himself together.
“Where did you get this stuff?”
John relaxes into the familiar cushions and suffuses the statement with all the genuine warmth he can muster.
“You heard the question. I do hate to repeat myself.”
Sherlock smirks down at him with a predatory glint in his eye that makes John forget whatever inconsequential bit of trivia had brought him into the bathroom in the first place. Crowding toward him, Sherlock stretches his arms behind John, closing the door and pinning him to it in one move. John’s heart beats a staccato rhythm in his chest and his breathing quickens. Sherlock’s face is so close to his own that he could count the man’s eyelashes.
Mary seems to read all of the questions in his eyes and laughs.
“No.”
John’s shoulders slumped in defeat.
Sherlock freezes with uncertainty.
John breathes out in one long steady stream and fiddles with the platinum band around Sherlock's finger. He presses his mouth to the metal, and Sherlock can feel the hot condensation of John's breath. It makes his heart stutter in his chest. John is smiling his broken, crooked smile. The real one. He pulls Sherlock close and cups his hands over Sherlock's cheeks.
John was so deep in his own thoughts, that he belatedly realized Greg was talking.
Just a few hours ago, when Sherlock had returned from fetching the laptop, John had snuffled into the pillow and rolled over in his sleep to nestle his head on Sherlock's shoulder. The warmth of John's skin on his shoulder was searing, even through his t-shirt and dressing gown. A smile had stretched its way across John's face, and Sherlock's traitorous heart had allowed him to hope. He'd imagined thousands of mornings that start the exact same way. He'd imagined rainy days and sunny days and "I hope to God we don't have a case because I just want to watch your chest rise and fall" days. Every day, every possible future that Sherlock can imagine includes John Watson, however he can have him.
Sherlock folds the carrier bags and stows them next to the bin under the sink. John used to like to reuse them. Sherlock glances once more around the shiny, bright kitchen and grips the cool marble of the island like a lifeline. This is John. John's house. He can feel the man everywhere. But there is no Sherlock here. He feels like an intruder. Perhaps, John did not want him in the house. That's why he has not been invited. He and John remain friends but his married life and his crime fighting life must stay in different spheres. No crossing-over.
“It’s about more than serving me a few poisoned smoothies.”
“My deepest apologies, John, truly. I don’t think I said that correctly. I never say it correctly. Just here.”
“Don’t. John, listen to me!”
“Aren’t you going to be late meeting Lestrade?” he asked lazily.
John clenches his fist, crushing the card in his hand. Of all the ridiculous things Mycroft has put him through, this ranks right up there. Does he not think John deserves to know everything about his lying, cheating murderer of a wife? Does he not think John deserves to be in on the plan this time? Or is this Sherlock’s work around? He had promised never to exclude John again, but does he thinks he can get around it by making the exclusion come from his brother?
They spoke at the same time. A twinge of red colored Sherlock’s cheeks. John leaned back against the kitchen cabinets and crossed his legs at the ankle. They had time.
Sherlock draws strength from the affirmation and plows on.
John knelt at the head of the sofa, so that his face was level with Sherlock’s. The detective had to remind himself to keep breathing. He searched John’s face hoping for an indication of John’s intent.
Sherlock’s body leaned into the contact, craving his touch. He ran his hand up Sherlock’s jaw to grasp a handful of curls, and tilting Sherlock’s head back, M softly kissed his pulse point. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed.
Sherlock shoots out of his chair and towers over John, pressing him backward into the counter. His keen eyes taking in every detail. His brain whirring away parsing the vital information from extraneous facts.
Sometime later, Lestrade gets a call. He goes into the corner to speak softly.
"You’re emotional right now. Don't bother denying it. We both know the truth. Stay here. See John. Form a plan. Your brother and I will help. I swear it just…stay. Please."
John gave him a small smile that did not reach his eyes.
John grumbles as his sleep-heavy mind whirs back online.
Unsure of his welcome, John did not encroach or offer to help. He set the clothing on the closed toilet lid and cleared his throat. He would understand if Sherlock wanted space to sort through all that had happened, but John was loathe to leave him now.

John turned back to his flatmate and let his shoulders relax back into the mattress. He took the time to examine the man above him. Sherlock was already fully dressed. The angular lines of his body emphasized by the immaculate cut of his dark navy-blue suit jacket. The shirt underneath looked pressed and steamed within an inch of its life. John could smell the earthy bergamot tones of Sherlock’s cologne mixing with the citrus mint of his hair product.
While John stared, Mycroft pressed a small button on the console next to him. A wooden panel on the side of the car lowered to reveal a small bar, from which Mycroft retrieved two tumblers and an impressively expensive bottle of scotch. He filled the glasses and handed one to John before downing his own in one go.
John hums and smacks his lips. He seems lost in the pleasure of eating his breakfast, so Sherlock clears his throat and shifts in his seat, trying to get the conversation back on track. But John continues his meal and ignores Sherlock until he slips the last strip of bacon into his mouth with relish and sucks the grease thoroughly from his fingers.
Sherlock's eyes slide closed in resignation. If Mary started making the smoothies three weeks ago, the timing fits. That fact increases the probability of Mary's involvement to practical certainty. John laughs, low hysterical giggles that he can't seem to control.
“The cases will always be there, John. I will always want you with me, even when we’re both geriatric and unable to chase criminals anymore. I’ll be bored out of my mind, and Rosie will be at university, but I’ll have you.”
Sherlock rests his cheek on top of John’s head and hums in lieu of an answer. After several moments, the doorbell buzzes and the moment is over. Sherlock draws back and holds John’s arms in his hands.
John is still staring in horror.
“Alright, Rosie-Posie, let’s get you off to school, yeah?”
John didn’t hesitate. He threw open the door, barely registered the thump it made as it struck the wall. His eyes searched eagerly for his friend.
Two things were going to happen tonight. First, he was going to have to meet M at Sebastian’s. If he didn’t show up, there was no telling what M might do. Second, he was going to have to ditch John. After last night, the man was unlikely to let Sherlock out of his sight, but Sherlock would never let him within a five-block radius of M.
He twists one of Stephen’s nipples hard while he sucks at a freckle on his neck. Stephen’s knees go weak.
“Take me through it, Sherlock. Like a case. Lay out the facts for me, like we’ve done a hundred times before. Alright?”
“Find him.”
“I thought perhaps it could be that for us again. We have both worked so hard to make things work this time around, and I know we can’t go back to how things were before…before…well, Before. But this is a place of new beginnings. That’s all I want, John.”
John’s palms dig into Sherlock’s shoulders as he braces himself. Sherlock looks up at him with wide admiring eyes. John loves that look. For this moment, he is Sherlock’s sole focus. It’s as if he holds all the world in his hands.
"What have you been so busy with lately? Got some good cases on?"
The soft certainty of Sherlock’s voice stopped him, and he turned his questioning gaze towards the man. He was leaning forward so that his shoulders lifted off the sofa, and John worried that he would try to get up. He moved back toward his friend, hoping to forestall any further efforts. He really did need to rest.
John nodded in sympathy, wishing he could help but it really was more Sherlock’s area. As if sensing the trail of his thoughts, Greg cleared his throat.
John grins at the familiar petulant tone. He missed the colossal berk. He lies back in the warm grass and lets the blades tickle his ears. He rests the phone on his drawn up knees as he considers his reply.
Sherlock unfolds himself enough to dig his mobile out of his pocket. He taps out a quick text and waits anxiously.
“You better watch out,” John said a bit more seriously but still laughing. “I could get used to this.”
“It was in the sauce.”
Sherlock swallows, his Adam’s apple bobs harshly in his throat.
“I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t desperate. Listen, John,” he leaned in close and lowered his voice so that the other patrons couldn’t overhear. Grisly details tended to disturb the general populace. “He implied that there’s a body count to this operation.”
people. Their lives are consumed with petty concerns and tawdry scandals. I strive for the obscure, the bizarre, the singular. This you know very well.”
Sherlock had no memories of ever having a mark, but he could not exclude the possibility. It could have happened at any time between his birth and his first conscious memory. He was sure Mycroft would not have catalogued him for such a sign.
John gently stroked his finger along Sherlock’s high, sharp cheekbone.
The mysterious alcove distracted him from his thoughts. Why the hell would anyone have a hallway that dead-ended in an empty chamber?
“What you must think of me! Do you think I’d rub off on just anyone who walked in here and offered? What do you take me for, an animal?! I don’t need your pity, and I certainly don’t need your help,
John sucks in a deep breath that dissolves in a painful coughing fit. The bronchial spasms force John to hunch over and rasp for breath between wheezing coughs. He clutches his throbbing sides and groans. In his hurry to leave the house, John had left all his medications there. Not that he is sure any of them are safe to use, but he will need an albuterol inhaler at the very least. The bronchospasms had been an unwelcome shock on top of the pneumonia.
A high-pitched giggle echoes, but Sherlock distinctly hears receding footsteps and the thump of each step down the stairs. Sherlock fumbles in his pocket and clicks on the tape recorder he concealed earlier.
“But?” he prompted when it seemed as though Sherlock was not going to continue.
“Sometimes,” he murmured truthfully.
John squinted at the photograph, then looked up at Lestrade. “Was there anything you lot dug up that suggests Alex had any medical abnormalities?”
John kisses Sherlock's fluttering eyelids.
“All good I hope.”
Sherlock takes a grounding breath and pushes the door open. John is slumped boneless in the tub. The flickering candlelight highlights the deep, clear blue of his eyes, and Sherlock almost forgets why he is here. He sits heavily on the closed toilet lid without thinking to do so. John smiles, warm and indulgent.
John draws his shoulders back, breathes deeply, and jogs up the steps. He opens the door to a mahogany lobby and signs in at the desk. John looks around, expecting Anthea to appear out of thin air and escort him to Mycroft. The silence of the club grows oppressive, and John wishes someone would cough or sigh. At this point, he would take a smoker just for the reassurance of the puffing noise.
“Stay?”
“Are you…” John started, obviously unsure. “…because I can wait, if you’ve got a lead or…”

"I’d never take the piss. You know that, right?” John asked.
A flicker of movement caught his eye, and Sherlock realized M must have signaled his guards because they were entering the dining room with a large salad, breadsticks, and a bottle of wine. One man dished out equal portions of salad for each of them while another poured their wine. The breadsticks were placed in the middle of the table. All the while, M’s eyes never left Sherlock’s face.
John carried the tea into the sitting room and left Sherlock’s cup on the side table. Sherlock watched him with a bizarrely calculating expression that made him uneasy. John sank into his arm chair and returned the look, challenging Sherlock with his intentional silence.
“You find the thing that makes caring worthwhile.”
“Oh God, Greg. I’m sorry but…Jesus. Sherlock, you fucking wanker! You just wanted to see Greg squirm didn’t you. Christ! This is all payback for that last case when he solved it before you even got called in. Bit not good, okay? Bit not good.”
The rightness of the morning leaves Mrs. Hudson a little teary-eyed when she thinks of the detective she met all those years ago. Back then, Sherlock was vain, arrogant, rude, and often incredibly high. She had more than once checked in on him to find him shivering through destitution-based withdrawal or hallucinating his way through his new score. She had feared for him so much back then. Still does, truth be told, but with John, she doesn’t worry so much.
“You amaze me. I always expect you to ask. Anyone would be curious. God knows I would be. But you don’t pry. How do you always know what to say?”
“Took you long enough.”
“So, you said that you can’t be with me…um, physically. And that it’s not ok?”
Greg leads them through to the sitting room, where Sherlock fights hard to restrain the giggles bubbling up. Molly’s influence is all over the room from the crochet blanket adorning the back of the sofa to the scratching tree nestled in the corner. Greg, sharp from years of working alongside the detective, notices his mirth.
“Rosie left her bio book on the kitchen table. Can you take it by the school?”
The restaurant was deserted. The table in front of him was clean and reset. The lights in the kitchen were off, but his coat still hung on the hooks by the door, for which he was grateful. His shirt was streaked with M’s come, and he didn’t fancy traversing half of London marked by another man’s semen. He really didn’t want to explain it to John.
“Westwood, as you well know.” M replied.
Sherlock didn’t turn back around, but his shoulders loosened a little bit. He was listening.
No response.
Soon, they are both close. John can hear himself moaning, vibrating around Sherlock's long, hard cock. Sherlock's knees buckle and he pushes urgently against John's head as a fresh wave of pre-come drips down John's throat. Sherlock is nearly there. John pumps himself faster as he slips a finger back along Sherlock's perineum.
“This is a new development. Sherlock has been exposed to another dose of Hypno.”
The man,
“It’s an antidote?” John clarified. Sherlock nodded affirmatively. John mulled that over. Odd word choice – antidote. If Sherlock was ill, the terms treatment or antibiotic would be more appropriate. Besides, John had examined Sherlock numerous times as he treated case-related injuries. Sherlock wasn’t sick. John would know wouldn’t he?
"How long-"
He is almost breathless with laughing now.
Sherlock did as he was told. M was hot and hard in his hand. The moment his fingers wrapped around him, M groaned with relief and bucked up into them. M finally released his grip on Sherlock’s hair, and the detective let his eyes close in relief.
No answers were forthcoming, though it seemed clear that Mycroft knew exactly what he was thinking. There was nothing else for it then. John grit his teeth and turned the brass knob.
Sherlock’s face twists in distress and John gets the distinct feeling he has missed something important.
John gathered his courage and let the words come.
Deduction: this was M’s stage. He was putting on a show, and Sherlock hadn’t been given his lines.
[TEXT] What are you doing tonight?
Sherlock made no move to acknowledge that John had spoken. He just continued to stare. John fidgeted and cast around for something to say. He had a million questions, but none seemed particularly appropriate for easing into the undoubtedly difficult conversation that would follow. Every interrogative he formulated in his mind sounded accusatory, at best, and outright hostile, at worst. John chewed his lip thoughtfully.
John stops rubbing his cheek along Sherlock's stubble and looks up in confusion. Sherlock looks caught, like he already regrets starting this conversation.
“Fuck this. Yeah, fuck this,” he muttered to himself and stormed out of the room. The door slammed shut behind him, and John wondered how he’d suddenly become a liability.
John shakes his head and tries to bully his lungs into operating correctly. He is not very successful.
“After we…you know. After this morning, I forgot about the textbook. I didn’t really remember until around noon when I was changing slides on that paraffin analysis I’ve been working toward. Anyway, I went to Rosie’s school as fast as I could and I apologized about being late with the book. But Rosie wasn’t mad.”
John, it seems, has had enough. He cocks the hammer back on his gun and grits his teeth.
“John,” Sherlock tread softly, testing the waters. He never did that. He didn’t bother. When he couldn’t deduce answers, he just asked, regardless of the sensitivity of the topic. This was different somehow. He couldn’t bear to see the hurt flash across John’s face, so he censored himself. He wouldn’t do this for anyone else. Not for anyone but John.
“Precisely. Hypno also alters the state of mind of the user. It stimulates a sexual response and overrides a person’s inhibitions and self-control. In essence, it strips a person’s humanity down to its basest instincts. It reduces a person to a sexual imperative.” Sherlock spoke in a matter-of-fact tone, but John could see the anger simmering just below the surface. “Worst of all, perhaps, is the fact that someone under the influence of hypno won’t recognize that fact. A person on hypno will believe that he or she desires the sexual response being stimulated. It’s not until the effects wear off that a victim even realizes what has happened.”
He didn’t know how it happened. It should have been impossible, but suddenly, John was there. He was standing next to Sherlock in the dingy alley, watching him shake his way through the shock. He watched John’s lips form shapes, but they had lost all meaning. John chewed his lip, probably deliberating the best course of action.
“I never thought I would love another human being as much as I love you, but God help me, John. She had me from the moment I held her. There isn’t a thing in this world I would not do to keep her healthy, happy, and safe. But I just keep failing and I don’t know how to be better. She deserves better and I don’t know how. I just don’t know.”
Mycroft paused in the doorway for a moment. “He trusts you, John.”
Sherlock swallowed back a dark chuckle. He needn’t have bothered. The man in front of him exuded power, lethal and unhinged. His height would not diminish the danger one bit.
Despite his discomfort, sitting down did offer John one advantage – he was now face-to-face with Sherlock. He used the momentary reprieve to watch the rise and fall of his friend’s chest. It was in no way a medically valid measurement, but the respiration was even enough to appease John for the time being.
He heaved a put-upon sigh but closed the newspaper and leaned over the table toward Rosie.
“John,” Sherlock choked, reaching for his hand.
“You’ve been together for six years, Sherlock. I think everyone knows that.”
John is rocked by the realization. He has a thousand ideas and no clue where to start.
Sherlock gave a practiced twist of his wrist, skimming his palm over the glans of M’s cock, and the man was lost. He spasmed in Sherlock’s hand, and he felt hot stripes seep through the thin silk of his shirt.
“I don’t see why you had to stop,” Sherlock whines for the fourth time. “It was going fine.”
He will see everything that Sherlock has tried to keep from him since he returned, and he will pity Sherlock and treat him like glass that may shatter at any moment. He will most likely cry, the silly romantic, and Sherlock will have no idea what to do so he’ll creep away, and John will be left to think that Sherlock doesn’t care about him at all.
John rolled back over. "Come here, you great berk," he said as he stretched an arm out to pull Sherlock closer to him. "You're ridiculous and I love you."
The consulting detective ignores him. "Help me look," he demands as he jumps up from the sofa.
Sherlock, being Sherlock, had pretty much no idea how to do any of the most basic duties. He poured half the bottle of dish soap into the sink and then turned the water on as cold as it would go. Then he captured John in a mighty snog and promptly forgot about the running faucet.
John chuckled, and the noise sounded like home to Sherlock. He gave Sherlock an Eskimo kiss. "I think that can be arranged."
The end result wouldn’t be so bad if John knew just how deep Sherlock’s feelings run, but he doesn’t. Because Sherlock doesn’t know how to show them, and he’s afraid John isn’t even looking.
chest.
at John. "Right," he says, flushing a bit. "Of course I don't. How silly of me."
, but his mind got distracted by the slide of silk against silk and produced delightful Mind Palace images of John in their bed with the top sheet waterfalling down his bare
Another hour or so later, John made Sherlock begin on everyday household chores he never deigned to do, such as washing the dishes left over from lunch and making their bed. (It was actually Sherlock's bed, as well as his room, but since they were sleeping together in both senses, it didn't make sense to be in separate rooms.)
, his mind supplied,
He looks up at John and is shocked to see tears forming in the doctor’s eyes. “I’m so sorry, Sherlock,” John chokes, “I had no idea you Fell to save Mrs. H and Greg and — and me.”
John preps Sherlock carefully, twisting his fingers just so in order to bring Sherlock pleasure but not applying enough pressure to push him over the edge. He insists that Sherlock ride him since it’s been so long, so he can control the speed, and Sherlock straddles John’s lap without protest, lowering himself down until they’re joined at that most intimate place.
John had rolled to face away and his shoulders were shaking.
Ten minutes later, John's hair stuck up in all directions, thanks to Sherlock's roving fingers. It made him look somewhat like a hedgehog, but Sherlock thought it looked deliciously messy and wanted to continue running his hands through it. "What do you say we go mess up that freshly-made bed of ours?"
221b is really too quiet. Sherlock is "bored" again, though he's had four clients in the last hour — all of which he'd sent off with a reprimand for, quote unquote, "wasting his time."
They tumble into bed still locked at the lips. It’s not late enough for there to be moonlight, but John takes his time by the light coming from the lamp beside the bed to stare into Sherlock’s eyes, cupping his face in his steady doctor hands, brushing his thumbs across Sherlock’s impossible cheekbones. (
"Sherlock." It's John's turn to look at Sherlock with that disappointed 'are you really that stupid' look. "Your desk is the complete opposite of 'organised.'"
Tea was amazing, as usual. Sherlock swore John made the best tea he'd ever had, but John maintained that all he did was pour hot water over teabags and add the sugar the way he knew Sherlock liked it.
Sherlock blinked rapidly several times. He'd been rather distracted by Mind Palace John at that time. "There is a possibility," he allowed reluctantly, though his mouth twitched.
"What's it say I'm to do today?"
"Don't," Sherlock snapped. "When we aren't solving crimes, our lives are private. Understood?"
, "I love you, too."
His voice cracks multiple times as he relates the events that had happened during the two years he’d been away.
The two men tumbled onto the bed, still attached at the lips. The amount of clothes they wore had rapidly decreased as they made their way from the sitting room to their bedroom.
So he did.
It was fine until it was time to put on the top sheet. Sherlock had watched avidly as John did the hospital corners
"I'm sure this is blackmail," Sherlock complained for the fifth time since he'd began about thirty-five minutes ago.
Silently pointing Sherlock over to the experiment on the kitchen table — he thought it had something to do with frozen maggots — John said, "But you like the reward, don't you?"
Sherlock cleared his throat, sure his face was bright red. "Yes, please," he called back.
"If you're going to have a sexual identity crisis, can you please hurry it up? I have things — or one thing, anyway — to do, and the more time the better."
Sherlock knows what will happen when he and John end up in bed together after all they’ve been through the past three years. John will kiss him, as slowly as if it’s the first time they’ve done this, and they will make their way down the hallway to Sherlock’s bedroom, still attached at the lips, and they will fall onto the bed as soon as John strips it of all but the fitted sheet. John will undress Sherlock, admire his alabaster skin in the moonlight streaming through the window, and then he will take Sherlock, rocking into his willing body tenderly, brushing kisses against his brow the way he did the night he took Sherlock’s virginity.
John, down to just his pants, fumbled for the top edge of the sheet. A second later came his bewildered voice, tinged a bit with hysterical laughter. "Sherlock. Sherlock, did you...did you put hospital corners on
"Sherlock, what the hell is this supposed to mean?"
"Thought about it, yeah." John's fingers
recall, you haven't left the flat today either."
John shut his computer and rose from the sofa to perch himself on the arm of Sherlock's armchair. "I won't share anything you don't want me to," he promised before leaning down to capture Sherlock's mouth with his.
The repetition of washing each dish was calming. It narrowed his focus in a way that allowed him to focus only on the task at hand. Was that a bit of dried egg clinging to the plate or had he used it for that experiment with the mucus membranes?
John cursed under his breath and turned back to the bed. Nodding to himself, he unhooked the sedative and settled into the nearby chair to wait. He thought back to the last time he had seen Sherlock. If he had left the concert when he'd realized his friend had ditched out on the performance, maybe he would have been able to help mitigate or prevent whatever horrific event had resulted in the rumpled grey figure in front of him.
Sherlock’s face was a sickly grey and his jaw was clenched even in his unconscious state. There was a delicate tremor running through his frame, despite the blankets layered on him, and he was sweating profusely. It suddenly occurred to John that he had never seen Sherlock seriously ill. Usually, he flopped around the flat at the first sign of a throat tickle and demanded even more tea and attention than usual.
“You don’t mean – “
M was talking, but he sounded far away now. Sherlock couldn’t understand him. His body still called for his touch, and Sherlock reached out. M batted his hand away easily and licked into his ear.
He drops the sandwich in the rubbish bin, raises the phone to his ear, and listens to the voicemails from the school. Halfway through the second message, he clicks off. There was a verbal altercation between Sherlock and Rosie when Sherlock dropped off Rosie’s book?  Sherlock was asked to leave? What happened? John looks at his watch - 2:33pm. Rosie is safe at school for the next hour and a half. He needs to find Sherlock.
Iain opens his mouth, but Stephen beats him to it.
“I know, but you can’t.” He tried to make it sound final, not leaving any opening for denials or discussion. “This isn’t something to be fixed.” Sherlock drew on all his past experiences – the parents, teachers, and therapists who had tried before. He let the hurt and the rage loose. He gave them free reign and was surprised to find the acid in his voice was real, albeit misplaced.
He needn’t have worried.
She glares at him, her eyes full of mistrust.
His face was such a mixture of hope and anxiety, that Sherlock forgot to be embarrassed.
Sherlock huffs, annoyed.
Greg took a long swallow and swung his legs up to rest on the empty chair next to John before he answered. “Colin Bleedin’ Monahan. Yeah - too bloody much, actually. He’s giving us so much information, it’s hard to parse the essentials from the nonsense. Apart from the details relating to the assault on Jenny Waterman, it’s all white noise.”
Dressed in a familiar black outfit that sends painful spikes of déjà vu through Sherlock’s chest, Mary steps out from the shadows and fixes him with a disdainful gaze. They stare intently at one another, a silent match of wills. Sherlock breaks and speaks first. He needs the information too much. There is too much on the line to waste time playing Mary’s games.
Sensing that the situation was once again escalating out of their control, John shut it down.
“Please?”
Before Sherlock does something stupid.
"The woman we know as Mary Morstan acquired her identity just over four years ago upon entering the United Kingdom. Her movements before that time are not known but it is a good guess that she spent quite some time in Eastern Europe. The photograph of her and James Moriarty was taken just after she came to London around New Year. Digging into the details of this relationship has been difficult to say the least, given the fact that I took care of Moriarty's
“Tilly Briggs pleasure cruise? Seriously, John? That is a gross exaggeration, even for you!”
ok - read on!
“Nope.”
“Is this to do with James Moriarty?” he asked.
“What’s not right?” he asked John tiredly. Clearly, he was in no state to entertain Sherlock’s games tonight. “Anderson’s not cocked it up again, has he?” Sherlock snorted, but deferred to John. How Anderson missed this, he’ll never understand, but he respected Lestrade. He really didn’t want to start an argument, and John was better at
“Then don’t.”
It still amazes John how carefree Sherlock is like this. The man is normally so carefully controlled. But when they are together, Sherlock feels
“What happened?” John asked in a carefully measured voice. “I know you know, Mycroft. You pretend to know everything that happens with him. So, go on, prove your omniscience. Just this once, show that you interfered to the level you always imply, and tell me what the hell happened.”
“You misunderstand! I do not wish to terminate my relationship with John. I want to enhance it. I want – “
“That would be boring.”
"What you said. That day. Why one
“Why are
Greg is saved his blathering by the kitchen door swinging open. Molly comes through carrying a proper tea tray and trailed by Toby, of course. She sets the tray on the table and looks between the two men, her hands on her hips. She sucks on her pursed lips and shakes her head. Idiots – the both of them.
Sherlock’s eyes flash at the insult. He spent years infiltrating Moriarty’s web. Of course, he gained valuable information, but most of it was current. It didn’t stretch back far enough for him to answer the question he most wants to know. When did the arrangement start? Why? Was it a partnership? Was she coerced? Who were they to one another? Employer-employee?
Static crackles for a moment before John’s face fills the screen. Sherlock presses pause as his heart beats wildly in his chest. Why would John send him a message like this? Did he know about the messages all along? No, impossible. He had seen John’s genuinely shocked and anguished face. So why?
John goes completely still. Never in a million years did he think this would even be a question. Sherlock has been in Rosie’s life from the beginning and no one cares more deeply for her. Rosie may not be Sherlock’s
By contrast, the man in front of him was silent and still, apart from the tremor. He could not find any obvious abrasions or injuries – likely a fever of some sort then. It scared John to see him so pallid. He turned toward the door, where Mycroft was hovering with his arms crossed.
John runs his hands through Sherlock’s curls.
“Good. That’s good.”
"I mostly pissed away the days in pubs meeting anyone who was available: Greg, Bill, some old rugby mates, even Stamford came out once. I can't really remember the last time I ate a meal at home."
"Sherlock?"
“This was the place where everything changed. And God, did I need that change. I needed you, John.”
Mrs. Hudson feels happiness fill her heart as John pours tea and adds just the right amount of sugar to Sherlock's cup. The detective accepts it without even looking and sips eagerly between streams of dialogue. The simple trusting domesticity of the flat warms her heart in a way she never thought she'd live to see. They may not be
“I’ve known you a long time, Sherlock. You texted me 25 minutes ago, and I’ve been watching you pace up and down the street for the last ten. Frankly, I thought I’d just get the door and put you out of your misery.”
Sherlock sighs in defeat and turns back toward the hospital.
He levered Sherlock up enough that he could slide out from underneath him. He used the toilet, but he didn’t linger. Every atom of his body was anxious to get back to Sherlock. If he wasn’t so blissfully happy, he’d be embarrassed at his compulsive need to be near him.
John understood at once. It had not been easy for Sherlock to admit that to him. He was fairly sure that he was the first person Sherlock had ever told, and the man did not seem convinced that he had done the right thing in doing so.
Both men are still stunned minutes after John has left the flat.
M was seated already. He twirled a butter knife between his fingers, watching the light glint off the utensil with too much admiration. His eyes had tracked Sherlock’s entrance into the room, but they’d strayed back to the blade.
Sherlock pads back into the sitting room and smiles. John is asleep with his head tipped-back against the back of the sofa. Leaving him to sleep a moment longer, Sherlock gathers John’s pajamas and a glass of water, which he deposits in the bathroom. Concluding that he has done all he can, Sherlock regretfully rouses John. As John rises and heads for his bath, Sherlock shuts himself in his room to pack the box back under his bed.
“Come. Join me.”
He left the folder from Greg on the kitchen table where he knew Sherlock would see it in the morning. He'd let Sherlock spend the day breaking his mind against the rocks of the case and try to re-broach the topic afterward. Maybe he'd be lucky enough to nab an extra shift at the surgery. With a last lingering glance toward the detective's room, John turned out the lights and headed for bed.
Not leaving time for Sherlock to reply, John disappears down the stairs. The light rumble of laughter carries up the stairs as Sherlock pours three equal glasses of smooth, deep red. He’s just swirling the wine in his glass and tasting as the mysterious sorcerer enters the flat. Sherlock inhales quickly, accidentally snorting red wine. The drink burns in his nose and the back of his throat as he quickly recovers from the odd experience of looking into an alternate reality mirror, or at least that’s what it feels like.
Sherlock tilted his head to one side, deliberating while he chewed.
“But you just said she worked for the CIA!”
“And it was marked
Sherlock’s face softened, and John could see him beginning to give himself over to the idea.
Again, there was no question in the statement. Sherlock had forgotten how claustrophobic this had always felt. He slid his scarf from his neck and shoved it in the pocket of his Belstaff before sitting but made no move to take off the coat.
A white-hot column of rage engulfed him. How could anyone have looked at Sherlock and thought they had the right to take, to touch?
? You want me to sit and cry? Will any of that help John? No? Then I will continue doing none of those things, so just LEAVE ME ALONE!"
“Know-it-all!”
“John, what has my brother told you about his personal life.”
“But I want to,” he said.
Sherlock hadn’t moved. He was still crumpled on the floor in the corner of the room. John slowly made his way over and sat as close as he could without actually touching the man.
That stops Sherlock in his tracks.
John jumps at the sudden change in conversation.
Sherlock merely inclines his head in an affirmative motion.
“You still don’t understand. Do you, Sherlock? Oh God! This has been fun - toying with you. Letting you weed out all the agents that refused to bow to me. Letting you take care of all the idiots who stayed loyal to Jim, even to the end. How boring! You did all the heavy lifting for me and the best part is - I got John.”
John nodded his understanding. “I realized fairly quickly that you had left me at the symphony, thanks for that by the way, but I wasn’t truly worried until you didn’t come home that night. I tried calling and texting, but I got no answer. Frankly, I was relieved when you brother – “
“Oi! Language!
The kiss is a desperate press, seeking reassurance. After the unusually wordy exchange, all that is left to be said is communicated with hands and lips and skin. After all, they have always been rather good at nonverbal communication.
John’s heart dropped and whatever spell had lain over them in his tiny bedroom that morning was broken. Sherlock drew himself up to his full height, unconsciously running his hand over the button John had undone. He looked on the verge of saying something before he shook his head and turned to the door.
Sherlock climbs hesitantly onto the bed and lies stiffly on top of the comforter. John’s hand pats across the bed until it brushes Sherlock’s. John twines their fingers together and raises Sherlock’s hand to his lips. He peppers kisses over each knuckle and the back of his hand. John falls asleep with their tangled hands resting over his heart. Sherlock stays.
“No! No, love. Look at me. Please? That’s not what I meant.”
“God this is hard. Now that it comes to it. Listen, I’m not very good at this stuff, but there are some things that are too important to leave unsaid. I’ve made that mistake before and…”
“This isn’t just some lowlife criminal painting a target on our backs. It’s more complicated than you can even imagine, and I am compromised. I can’t protect you.” Sherlock steeled himself for the final blow. “The last thing I need is the liability of carrying your dead weight. I can’t be stopping to answer question after question. Not with this. The match is set. There’s too much at stake, and I refuse to lose.”
A frisson of fear shot up John’s spine. It had been ages since he’d been summoned by Mycroft, and the man had certainly never bothered to announce the impending kidnapping beforehand. He reread the message several times and felt a certain desperation underlying the words. Mycroft was always economical with language. He didn’t include superfluous information, but this message lacked all command. There was no haughty entitlement. It was matter-of-fact and purposeful. He might as well have texted COME QUICKLY!! in all caps.
"You'll stay for some tea, won't you?"
“You have no idea.”
“Damn it.”
John raises a questioning eyebrow.
John was an intriguing study in contradiction. His passion and encouragement were a raging hurricane in all of Sherlock’s still and silent places. The doctor who went to war was treating Sherlock as if
Sherlock could tell that John didn’t really think he’d found any new information yet. This was his way of asking Sherlock what he was up to. Sherlock pretended to consider the question.
Neither man seemed forthcoming. He looked around the room as if seeing it for the first time, hoping he was missing an obvious explanation. It was mostly the same as he had left it. He did notice that Sherlock had raked the fireplace. He’d never admit he’d done it, but Sherlock knew Mrs. Hudson had a hard time getting back up after doing so. She did have a bad hip after all.
, are all negotiable. We’ll navigate them as they come. So long as we both agree to try and communicate when we want something, or when we don’t want something,” he added hastily, “we should be alright.”
He presses his hand into Sherlock's and guides him up the stairs. Once in his bedroom, John pulls his canvas bag out from under the bed and tosses in the entirety of his wardrobe. He hasn’t accumulated much since his Baker Street days and it all still fits in the one bag. He nips into the washroom to gather his toiletries and zips it authoritatively closed. He slings the bag over one shoulder and grips Sherlock's hand again in the other. He squeezes tightly and leads them both out of the house.
John's finger hovers over the keyboard as he decides whether or not to try again. Clearly, Sherlock doesn’t want to be bothered. Not by him anyway. But then he remembers too-long silences and skin stretched taut over icy features. He remembers an empty fridge and untouched cups of tea. He remembers the panicked-caught look on his best friend's face as he sprinted down the street. His fingers are typing before he even finishes the train of thought.
Sherlock bites his lip and turns to leave just as the doorknob turns. A wind-swept, red-cheeked Mary ushers her still-ill husband over the doorstep. They both stop at the sight of Sherlock running out of their kitchen. Sherlock's heart pounds. He feels trapped.
“Well, since we are in fact on a case, perhaps you could just limit your inquiries to anything relevant to that.”
He pauses for a second before his mind catches on something, something John had said that--
It's so easy to smile, suddenly. It's almost like it didn't matter if he meant it or not, because Nadine laughs at his joke, raising her beer bottle as if in a toast, and at the moment, Sherlock’s brain isn’t second-guessing everything he does.
When the door to 221B closes a minute later, Sherlock's thoughts are very far away from disappearances and links between victims, and it should be hateful to be reduced to this state by such a trifle - to let someone else cause this response in him - but it isn't. Sherlock's no stranger to his own sexuality, but to be so affected by--
Anxiety could be considered part of a depressive symptomology, but John has already drawn the -
A low blow, even by the standards of this exchange. And yet, the fact that his brother seems to find the subject almost as uncomfortable as Sherlock does, somehow serves to take the edge off it.
Sherlock’s exhale is a sigh, and he reflexively shakes his head as if to slough off the images that are still projecting in his mind before he disentangles himself from John’s -
Picking up a few discarded clothes to put on, Sherlock makes his way to the bathroom.
[ ] N/A = not applicable

“...Okay,” John says, his voice hesitant.
It might be an unorthodox cure, but then again modern psychiatry has failed him, probably doesn't even have the means to evaluate someone with a brain both as intelligent and as… problematic as his, so unorthodox methods are all that remain.
is not something they do.
Also, keep in mind; this is not me trying to diagnose Sherlock. This a is a story in which Sherlock attempts diagnosing himself.
Sherlock had known that being ‘homosexual’ was a deviation long before he’d known what it actually meant to be homosexual, not to mention going as far as to reflect upon his own possible sexuality.
than when his mind has nothing better to chew on than the meaningless round of daily life. It's dangerous, because his brain has still not fully accepted that life cannot consist solely of problems to solve, challenges to rise to and interests to pursue. It will consume itself, and there's nothing left for Sherlock to do but watch it happen. Uni is better, but Sherlock's brain isn't. The only constants are the inconsistency of his temperament and the steady flow of obsessions, some permanent, but most fleeting.
“No,” Sherlock replies without giving John time to voice the question.
There’s 24 pills
During his first two days in the ICU, Sherlock keeps returning to the thought of death with a previously unknown intensity.
John doesn’t move any closer, still it feels like his presence becomes more and more tangible in the air that's surrounding Sherlock.
He makes a complicated face and puts a firm hand on Sherlock’s wrist, directing it and the cube away from where they’ve ended a bit too close to John’s face for comfort. Sherlock takes the hint and drops his hand, but picks up even more speed instead.
“That’ll be it,” he says in an uninterested but determined voice, holding up a hand to stop the protest that Lestrade is going to blurt out. “There’s been a poisoning that I need to take care of, if you don’t mind.”
Turning around with a swirl of his dressing gown, Sherlock returns to his room. He’s barricaded himself in for the past two hours, hoping that John would go away so Sherlock could get to his violin without having to face him. Hoping that the pressure would go away.
Breathing. More heavily now. John can feel each exhale in the air between them. He can see Sherlock's hands pause again, then, taking in the silence, they start pulling trousers and pants down.
Adding another person into the equation clearly changes the outcome in more than one way.
The case is currently at a dead end, and there’s a pressure building up in Sherlock’s limbs. He’s not being brilliant, or even making progress, and perhaps even being on Clomipramine is better than this.
The criterian for depression (from DSM-IV) this chapter aimed to illustrate was:
Sherlock is aware of what he is, but it doesn’t matter - shouldn’t matter - because Sherlock has never acted upon any of his potential desires, and so he shouldn’t have to answer for something that cannot even theoretically have any practical implications for another person.
It’s not true. And it isn’t real.

This, Sherlock concludes, would be a dull place to die. And his current state is, undeniably, not the most rational.

“Marsha Linehan, Ph.D., who founded dialectical behavior therapy, believes you develop an identity by observing your own emotions, thoughts, and feelings, in addition to others’ reactions to you. If you have BPD and the associated emotional instability, impulsive behavior, and dichotomous thinking, you may have difficulty forming a coherent sense of self because your internal experiences and outward actions are not consistent.”
(Brain.)
Sherlock also hates Edinburgh before he even arrives.
The expression in John's face is everything Sherlock had hoped for.
There are still questions unanswered.
Weakness.
“So, a school today, wasn't it?”
Emotions - managing frustrations and modulating emotions
There are no excuses.
It’s two hours after John’s little talk and Sherlock has spent those two hours staring at the screen of his laptop and trying to compose himself, then trying to come up with his next move. He wants to wreck this even more, and he considered if cocaine would perhaps be the last straw that managed to get John to leave (leave now. He will leave eventually anyway, but part of Sherlock wants it to be now.) but finds himself unable to even follow the thought to the end. And in the end he finds himself unable to do much at all, it seems. Because Sherlock doesn’t want this, doesn’t want to feel this, but he does, and John says that he does too, and Sherlock doesn’t actually want to be cruel, as John pointed out, much to Sherlock’s surprise. Being cruel to John Watson is unforgivable, even if restraining himself from doing so is almost impossible.
“Not talking tonight, then?”
There’s something vaguely familiar about the way Sherlock’s eyes are scrunched shut and only flutter open again, and the manner in which Sherlock doesn’t even seem to be able to formulate a cutting reply to John's questions.
(Running his hands through his hair, the waves of it circling his fingers, provides an outlet for the fluttering, nonsensical sensation that this particular question gave rise to. Illogical, unlike his reasoning.)
‘Here’ is a small pharmacy. He first started coming to get antacids for his recently-acquired ulcer, but lately the pharmacy has provided something far more useful; distraction in the form of a tiny puzzle.
Except this is nothing like the memories of a Judgement Day that never came. This is about something that may or may not be real, but that isn’t a threat. It’s… a chance.
As he opens one of the packets and set it aside before filling his glass with water, Sherlock is at least taking action. Taking action is close to taking control. He pops two pills out of the blister -
Just before they leave NSY -
Psychiatry, thinks Sherlock, is a sad excuse for a medical speciality.
John’s hand is sliding down the exposed skin of his throat. The fingers trace strained jugular muscles, following the tendons as they stretch out, struggling to accommodate the arch of Sherlock’s spine.
“Well, deducing the motive behind any murderous attempt directed at you personally would probably be--” John starts, but Sherlock interrupts him before that so-called joke is finished.
When John finally speaks, half a minute has passed, and Sherlock has returned his attention to his food, waiting for John’s thoughts to translate themselves into words.
Sherlock’s own body language - somehow a partial countering of John’s. He doesn’t want to observe himself from the outside - not now - but his mind has already gone there; the barely restrained half smile and the way he’s inclined his head, allowing the shadows of his curls to obscure whatever his face is currently trying not to display. The slight bounce in his step, the way he feels like wrapping his tingling arms around himself but doesn’t.
The problem is when you are not sure if what you want is something that you'd be better off without.

Because you invade everything, rummage around for a few minutes and you don’t even bother to clean up when you go, not even closing the door behind you. And now
“Get your gun: we're going to find a Mr Evans, a Mr Coleridge and a Mr Larson,” Sherlock informs, pointedly not looking at John as he drops the overnight bag he’d left by the door onto the sofa. Remembering exactly what is in the side compartment of that bag, Sherlock instantly grabs it again, heading towards his room.
It was partially a compensatory goodness - compensating for many more things that had happened later in life too, Sherlock was certain - but the reason behind it was only a catalyst, and once it was consumed it had already played out its role, the reaction it caused being the only thing that mattered. John had made a choice about his direction in life, making loyalty and bravery something larger than fear.
He's been played the fool once more. By his own impaired mind. To think that he-- That he thought that this--
“It wouldn't be out of-” John interrupts, but is himself interrupted.
Sherlock is someone who always chooses his moments, and he has chosen this particular moment to ask this simply because John - already aroused and with his mind full of the things he wants to do to Sherlock - will react much more favourably to suggestions of the kind Sherlock has just voiced than he otherwise would. It's simple chemistry, and Sherlock will take a rational approach to reduce the chances of John's reactions being negative to what he’s suggesting.
Sherlock kicks over the chair. The crash causes the man to look up and away from John - and half a second later his gun is on the floor and John is kicking far out of reach.
(It’s impossible to determinate if autonomic processes like attraction to his own body factors in, and the end result will be the same either way, even if Sherlock has found himself hoping for evidence for such a process, although it shouldn’t matter,
. To make up for.
Sherlock never gets any further explanation, but he does get John’s fringe against his forehead, and John’s breath against his lips. Then there’s lips brushing lips, and it’s too light, almost ticklish, so Sherlock leans up into the kiss, deepening it.
(It ought to feel either disturbing or arousing to have another person’s dried semen on your skin, but apparently it’s neither. It’s negligible in the light of the radiating deep arterial red and the possibility of a breakthrough in the case, it seems.)
John should simply not be rewarded for this particular, ridiculous behaviour.
As is his habit, Mycroft doesn't wait for recognition or sanction before he steps into Sherlock's room (
Even now, Sherlock has to prove himself over and over again in order to make people willing to even consider the possibility that he might in fact be right, because clearly, providing the only logical answer to a question just isn't enough to convince anyone.
John is amused, and while it was obvious when they met that feelings of anything bordering on amusement were something John hadn’t experienced for quite some time, Sherlock has seen no less than 19 different expressions of mirth in the past eight days.
Speaking to Joseph, Sherlock is aware that John’s eyes follow him, but not in their usual way - the way they do when he’s trying to figure out what conclusions Sherlock is drawing from the information from a witness or a suspect - but in a way that tells Sherlock it’s something else John’s looking for this time. That, in turn, makes Sherlock observe himself even more thoroughly as he attempts to listen to Joseph’s retelling of his teacher’s disappearance. There’s a focus shift, and instead of hearing Joseph, Sherlock hears his own words echo back, picking them apart to see if there’s anything in the way he acts that could give him away. In the end, that itself will give him away, because he forgets to listen to Joseph, finding himself rephrasing his initial question just to avoid asking the same thing again. Something about this must have given John all the information he needs, because he averts his gaze, instead focusing it on Joseph, and Sherlock is once again able to make out the words through the noise of his own mind.
The dragon is still dead and John’s movements speak of
“Shit, what have you--” John’s jaw does that slight shift, the muscles tensing up, and Sherlock knows what's coming. “You fucking idiot--”
Adjusting his coat, Sherlock heads towards the lab to check a few possible leads. There's nothing about this whole situation that is really unexpected, except for how long it has taken them to get there.
to manage that - and--)
Then his eyelids flutter, just for a tenth of a second, because two fingers slide from his chin, slide down his throat, painting a slow line over his carotid artery before getting stuck in the collar of his T-shirt.
There’s something very painful in the way Sherlock’s pulse sounds almost louder than John’s words. Again.
It seems like the partial silence of the past two days have only been temporarily broken, because John nods again and then sits down in his chair, grabbing his laptop.
“And it's not about what you used to--”

The “New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry” turns out to be a clear improvement over the old, stolen paperback from his earlier run-ins with psychiatry. For one thing, it's the current edition and should therefore have been updated to include the latest findings, although findings are not what he’s after.
Realising that he must have closed his eyes, Sherlock blinks them open and feels the incisive light of the room almost stinging his eyes.

He found a finch on the ground below a window once when he was nine. It looked like it had just decided to have a rest, but birds don't lie on their side on the pavement, so Sherlock wanted to take it home and examine it, to find out what was broken.  He didn’t, because that was the kind of thing that made Mycroft say ‘There are reasons they send you to psych doctors, you know.’’
There’s a conversation somewhere, but it’s on in the border between sleep and wakefulness, and just before Sherlock crosses that border, he recognises the words.
It’s the first thing she’s said to him since she greeted him and asked him to take a seat in her office.

John says nothing, and his lack of verbal response is mistaken for indifference.
(Perhaps not just at work.)
All in all; they both crave novelty and sensations to a high degree. When faced with routines and the lack of intense stimulation both of them cringes and begin to act out, one way or another. Whether this is a positive or negative trait is impossible to tell; it depends so much on how you choose to handle it.
His impulse control reaching it’s limit, John withdraws an inch and pushes back again only to stop himself from pushing even further. The body underneath him winches and tenses up even more, beautiful in it’s ability to just take what’s given. He doesn’t want to hurt Sherlock, but he does want to take him hard, pushing in, filling, coming…
The red glow is still tinted with a hint of khaki, of pale green, and it doesn’t make sense, but then sentiment - or whatever this is - seldom does. Sherlock decides that this is not the time to solve a puzzle that’s been bothering him for twenty-odd years.
This chapter will differ slightly from previous ones. Usually the chapter has only one POV, but for this one I’ve chosen to use an alternating POV. This is because I wanted to show the difference in their experiences during this scene, but also because I don’t think that there’s no other issue (well, except for the codependency, in this story) that these two idiots share to such a degree as Sensation Seeking.
After almost twenty seconds, Sherlock hesitantly gets up, steps away from the table and stands on the gritty carpet a few feet away from John, his shirt half-open under his suit jacket and his face blank.
Victor has a half-decent intellect and an ability to take things at face value and run with them.  Sherlock himself has just spent three weeks in bed, lacking the energy to do anything, but buffeted by the whirlwind of thoughts. All he could do was lie there while all his remarkable ability to observe and dissect turned inwards instead of outwards.
John’s enjoyed the making out far more than anyone with an ongoing sexuality crisis ought to, he really has. He’s also started to accept that the increasingly frequent shagging with his best friend is no longer something that can be blamed solely on alcohol or adrenaline, and he’s even gone as far as to admitting - if only ever to himself - that he might just have been a bit in love with the sod for several months. John’s slowly begun to accept all that, learned to live with it, but this--
Stupid.
Three silent taps with his left foot against the floor, then three more with his right hand against the sink. Then three more. And three more.
John’s intent.
(He used to believe that he needed to be just that, though.
Sherlock shouldn’t have to settle for this, shouldn't have to settle for John and John’s inability to see past his genitals when it comes to sexual attraction.
John stares at him.
John’s hand stills, fingers resting against the side of Sherlock’s throat, and there’s no pressure, only presence, a contact area for warm skin.
John's colors keep shifting during the next two days, as does his gait. He’s beginning to limp slightly, and trying to compensate for it.
“You received the tricyclic antidepressants as a treatment for an unfortunate imbalance in your neurochemistry. An imbalance that, need I remind you, made you see patterns that didn't exist and let sentiment rule your mind.”
John’s statement had been less than exact, and what else could Sherlock have expected? The statement says nothing about the nature of the progression: emotional, sexual, towards some tangible commitment? Or simply towards a mutual destruction?
His fingers fly to his lips, feeling them, trying to make sense of whether it really happened or if--
Sherlock shifts a bit, suddenly wanting to know if this is affecting John the way it's affecting him, even though it seems unlikely given John's lack of sexual attraction towards his gender, but proximity is still proximity and Sherlock wants to know and he doesn't want to know and--
Taking six - no,
It's no use in arguing about it. In fact, remaining silent seems to be a far more efficient way to get John to do something about his frustration.
In the course of a few hours’ research, Sherlock manages to accomplish several things.
“Are you going to be a helpful brother and bring me some narcotics to alleviate some of my temporary deterioration or are we done here?”
A rare cup of coffee offered to him by his best friend turns out to be nothing but a ruse for experimentation with potentially damaging drugs, and after that, further offers of coffee simply don’t do the trick when it comes to showing remorse. In the end, the worst thing about the whole fake hound disaster is not the dissociation and panic, but the fact that Sherlock watched it as it happened. John doesn’t let himself either snap or yell, though the bastard deserves both. He's not sure what words would emerge if he did.
(See the end of the chapter for
(This should not feel like it’s Sherlock that’s exposed himself. Still, it does. Because he finds that it matters.)
As John stretches a bit and readjusts his clothes, Sherlock can feel every millimeter of the hard surface beneath him, can feel the chilly air surrounding him.
- Sherlock’s toes are tapping away inside his shoes, a rhythm in tandem with his own pulse.
Sherlock isn't sure what to make of that either, or how to adjust his actions accordingly. There's an anger, somewhere, but he pushes it down, and it lingers down in his belly, feeling faintly like a heart burn.
Sherlock tenses almost unnoticeable at the initial touch, but his muscles relax as John keeps his hand moving firmly.
Grinning, Sherlock drains his coffee, letting a pleasant tingling chase away the feeling that it’s he himself who is missing something vital in all of this.
- meaning, and just turns and walks back into the kitchen, where his tea is waiting, now lukewarm.
), there's been a strange atmosphere in the flat, and there's not been a single raised voice, argument or provocation. They’ve behaved almost respectfully towards each other while eating take away during companionable conversations, have not pushed each others' buttons or even engaged in the usual arguments over cleaning. Sherlock knows how to behave respectfully just the way he knows how to do most things, but this is one thing he seldom bothers with, but for now - for John - he will. Still, it makes him feel… bereft.
“Sherlock dear, your brother is here to see you,” Mrs Hudson informs him from below the stairs to 221B -
- and frustration -
“You accused Mycroft of making me think of this-” Sherlock gestures vaguely at the space between them, not wanting to be too precise, “-as a weakness. You were correct, but only in a sense. He did not make me doubt things by telling me it was a weakness. I am more than capable of generating doubts on my own, which is part of the problem. It is, however, possible to override these irrational doubts as long as there’s no cause to assume that they might be… legitimate. What Mycroft did was to inform me of a connection that I myself should have seen. You see, when it comes to the chemical side of things, being ‘in love’ is a state believed by some researchers to be very similar, in terms of the levels of neurotransmitters, to OCD. ‘The doubting disorder’.”
Sherlock found it incredibly easy to meet his gaze this time as he spoke.
“I want to marry John. And what could be more ordinary? I want to tie our lives together. I want to be his partner, unquestionably forever. I want to live with him, work with him, love with him. I want to give him everything, yet every time I try, I come up with nothing. Not one single idea worthy of note. I fear I am too close to the case; therefore, I have come to your admittedly second-rate mind in hopes of an idea that may fan the flames of my intellect and reveal the right path forward.”
He looked frantically around and saw their reflection mirrored back at him in the restaurant window. How had he not recognized that it was mirrored glass? In his mind, he registered relief at the understanding that he was not visible to all of London. But when had the mirror been engaged? Before M straddled him? Before the kiss? He didn’t know.
Sherlock tried to look away, to turn his head so that he wouldn’t see, but M held his head in place. There were no track marks to be found. Instead, a livid black spider adorned the delicate skin. The veins surrounding the tattoo were mottled black and throbbing angrily.
"Really, John. That's the question you want to go with. I thought you'd be more interested in the why of it all."
Sherlock’s hand shakes as he slides the phone back into his pocket. He wraps his scarf around his neck, despite the warm day, and leaves. If he waits, John will notice that something is wrong. He has gotten surprisingly observant during Sherlock’s time away. Tucking his chin to his chest, Sherlock strides purposefully down Baker St. pretending he has the situation under control.
“Lestrade’s got a date. Before you ask, his hair’s been recently cut, he’s walking with a slight limp – obviously wearing new shoes that pinch, and he’s trying out a new cologne. It’s been applied with a heavy hand, if you ask me. Not to mention he has been obsessively checking his watch since we arrived. Obvious. He has a date tonight. A new partner – it must be. He can’t call and cancel or be late because he hasn’t built up the relationship cache to allow such a faux pas. He knew he wouldn’t be able to leave the scene until he had at least a tentative picture of what had happened, so he called me in to speed up the process. Good thinking too. He really likes her. It wouldn’t do to have to meet her here. Quite the distraction. Besides, it is horribly inappropriate to display characteristics of arousal at a crime scene. People would talk you know.” Sherlock rattled off, sarcastically.
“Just under ten years."
"John."
Oddly flattered to hear the words from Sherlock himself, Greg also catches the hint of question underlying the statement.
Rosie’s face scrunches adorably.
“I am truly sorry for the way I’ve treated you.”
John’s soft, warm hand covered his own in the space between them on the seat. Sherlock took a moment to savor the gentle touch of John’s fingertips along the slender bones on the back of his hand. The touch was firm enough to ground him back in the present but not so heavy as to be oppressive.
“Forever?”
He smiled encouragingly. “How long have you been taking this antidote?” John asked, falling back on his medical training. He hoped that adopting a clinical approach might ease them into what was sure to be a difficult conversation.
“Yes! I’m sorry for all of it.”
“When?”
“So good. So good. So good.”
Sherlock’s voice chokes into silence as he heaves in breath and suppresses a sob. John, still mostly at a loss as to what has happened, does his best.
of his umbrella on the stairs, and I figured you'd be needing some biscuits for afters."
“What do you know about my brother’s past?” Mycroft asked, back to his usual disdainful distance. Somehow, it put John at ease, like a return to their typical status quo.
"For a genius, you can be spectacularly ignorant, you know that? I don’t care about all that, Sherlock. How long have
“Of all the strategic facts you could be extracting, you’re still hoping I was trapped into this life. Tsk. Tsk. You should know by now that I never do anything I don’t want to do.”
Time is speeding up, or Sherlock is loosing track of it. Either way, John's mouth is opening and Sherlock can't bear to hear what he is about to say. He rushes to think of something -
John trails off as the answer slots into place.
“Do you ever wonder?” John asked.
"Love? What is love, John?"
The detective woke slowly, his hand clenching against John’s jumper. He sighed and smacked his lips. John’s heart lurched, and he knew that he wanted to wake up to that sight every morning. He spoke softly as he coaxed the man towards waking.
“Very good.”
“His enterprise was carried on by a trusted associate, his second in command.”
Sherlock brushed a wayward curl out of his eyes and got up to check the computer monitor. He was pushing the process as fast as he dared. They didn’t have enough samples for him to repeat these tests if he got it wrong. He sighed when he saw that it would still be several hours before there were any new results to analyze.
. Clearly from Mycroft. John lets his attention wander to the studious expression wrapping itself across Sherlock's face. His forehead puckers over eyebrows drawn intensely downward, and his lips are pressed into a severely thin line.
“Are you drunk?”
Sherlock flinched as a cold hand settled against the side of his neck angling his head back toward the man behind him. The hold was possessive, and Sherlock’s heart raced at the proximity between M’s fingertips and his own windpipe. He knew M must be able to feel his tension. Cold black eyes bored into his own. Sherlock cursed this man that made him feel as if no time had passed. When that gaze flickered down to Sherlock’s lips, he felt every bit the helpless seventeen-year-old he’d been when they’d met.
“I’m sorry, John. It was just so quiet, and I wasn’t sure –
Sherlock almost pitied the man. Three femurs, barring extremely unlikely circumstances, indicated that there was more than one corpse in the boat garage. Lestrade’s puzzling murder had just turned into a potential serial killer case. Sherlock suppressed the urge to laugh. God, it was like Christmas! Three femurs, no fingers, and a locked room mystery all rolled into one. He spun away from the group to hide the small smile he could not keep off his face, but John saw it, of course he did.
This is taking much longer than originally planned. Thank you to everyone who is still reading!
Hoping to derail the impending strop, John changed the topic of conversation.
They both wince at the attempted nonchalance. Clearly, it’s still too soon for joking.
“Sherlock….”
“I know you want to help,” he started. He’d meant to be cutting, but his voice was much too soft.
"You seem pretty bloody well informed!"
Sherlock holds the book up in front of himself, at a loss for what else to do. He has no idea why Rosie is acting this way.
[TEXT] I can be free around 7
"Yes, Detective Inspector?"
“I don’t understand,” John pushed. “Why ask Sherlock here at all if you weren’t going to allow him inside? There’s nothing he can do from out here that he couldn’t do at Baker Street with crime scene photos and preliminary reports. This is a bloody waste of time, and you know it.”
“In this bed.”
Mycroft raised his glass to his lips again. His face warped with shock and disgust when he remembered it was already empty. He put it back on the bar before turning to John. His hands fiddled with the clasp on his briefcase, but his eyes never left John’s face. John could see him considering his options.
"You solved it. You got me out. But Mary's not stupid. She's bound to notice a missing husband, even if said husband has been spending all his time down the pub."
Anger flashed across Sherlock’s face at the mention of his brother.
"Oi! You still have a plan to explain. Remember?"
“You’re a liar! You’re a liar, and I don’t care what you say!”
“The name’s Flap and Throttle, and the address is 254 Water Street,” Sherlock said with a wink.
With a heavy sigh, he rolled onto his back and rubbed at his eyes. He’d lain there most of the night trying to think of a way around the inevitable, but he hadn’t been able to find one.
The questions went on and on, but John realized he did not need the answers. He needed Sherlock to be secure in the knowledge that he could trust John with this. Trust him to know and not let it change anything, not let it change them.
When Sherlock woke the next morning, he was surprised to hear John puttering about the flat. He’d thought that John would be out already, picking up an extra shift at the clinic or just avoiding Sherlock.
"John would barely agree to go after her when you had each other as back up. He would never forgive you if you risked your life going after her now."
He slid the coat from Sherlock’s shoulders and walked across the room to hang it on the hooks by the door. He brushed his hand over the wool, ridding it of the dust and dirt that had accumulated during Sherlock’s walks through London.
“Could you uncork the wine while I get this?”
“I know about the hypno and the related incidents. Sherlock’s unusual reaction to that specific drug. I know about Wiggins and the antidote…” John trailed off unsure of how much more to say.
Not worked related, clearly. Must be personal then. John’s left hand was balled into a fist at his side and a subtle tremor wracked the limb. Sherlock wished he could close the small space between them and still the shaking with his hand clasped over John’s, but he didn’t dare.
Sherlock didn’t have the luxury of following that train of thought much longer. Soon, there was a flurry of movement and a mismatched thudding on the stairs. John was home – finally!
[TEXT] He went for it then
John paused and considered his flatmate. He was restless and that was never a good sign. Sherlock had been out the previous night, and John had started a delightful action novel that he’d love to have picked up again. Only, he’d been fairly certain Sherlock would ruin it within minutes. He had that manic energy about him.
Sherlock shot him a withering look.
Thank you to everyone who had questions but stuck with this story. I hope this chapter begins to answer them.
"It's Mary's. She's always tended it. I just recently started the garden."
Light, on the other hand, covers a multitude. It’s like cloaking a private conversation amongst the murmured static of a busy coffeeshop. With enough ambient noise, numerous lies can be hidden.
“I’m glad.”
"What was the point? What was it all for now? What will I do, My?"
“And I think you needed me too. That night decided what we would be – detective and blogger. One job, two roles. We fit together seamlessly like we were always supposed to get there.”
Sherlock looked apprehensive. “Yes,” he rumbled softly.
“That would be great.”
His phone had rung in the early hours offering him a morning shift at the clinic, and it had seemed like a welcome reprieve at the time. He’d answered his mobile while scrubbing fractured, restless sleep from his eyes. He’d yawned and stretched, which made his shoulder throb, and his cheek had felt raw, like he’d spent the night nuzzling a piece of coarse steel wool. It had taken John an embarrassing amount of time to realized that he’d fallen asleep in the sitting room with his face mashed into the corner of his armchair.
But his face turned serious when the DI slid a folder out from under his coat.
Mycroft reaches toward his brother, palms up, and moves slowly to sit at Sherlock's side.
Mycroft bundles Sherlock closer and rocks slowly. It is all he can do.
He’d been surprised when Sherlock suggested they attend a matinee performance of the London Symphony Orchestra yesterday afternoon. They were semi-regular patrons of the Symphony, but Sherlock typically preferred the pomp and circumstance of an evening performance.
The joke is a weak attempt to dispel the tension. It doesn’t work, but Sherlock seems resigned to power through.
Miraculously, unbelievably, incredibly, unprecedentedly it seems that John wants that too.
“That’s it. Yes, Sherlock. I want it. Come on.”
John grimaced at the mental image Sherlock had conjured but quickly turned his attention to formulating a plan of attack. Ever the soldier, John would be considering the practical concerns of categorizing body parts to identify a victim who had been blown to pieces, leaving Sherlock to the puzzle of determining the perpetrator(s) and motive.
“How about you, gorgeous? You property of the possessive Captain Watson too?”
“Want me to dry?” John asked.
“Mrs. Hudson!”
John can practically hear the eyeball roll. He stalks angrily toward Sherlock's chair and looms over the man, a trick he can only pull off when the lanky git is sitting down. He lets the ice of his glare unsettle Sherlock for a few moments before speaking.
He squeezes his fist and savors the last few moments of peace before he will have to open his eyes to the life that is now his: John and Mary in their too big house with the empty yellow room.
Sherlock finishes the sentence for John. After all, it is the simplest truth he will have to convey.
“I want us to be together always. Everything else, the
Sherlock half-turned, keeping his left arm well out of John’s reach. He hung his head and his shoulders curled protectively like he was expecting a fight. John knew it would do no good to argue with him about it. He would just have to show Sherlock that he would keep his word and his distance.
“John. You’re supposed — to be — at the —surgery.”
“Come alone, have you?”
“You think that if I could just explain, if I could put it into words, then you would understand. You’re wrong. You wouldn’t understand, and it wouldn’t do a bit of good. You can’t change the past, John. You can run from it, but it always has a way of catching you, in the end.” He drew in a shuddering breath that he hadn’t realized he had been holding.
John - Brilliant, Beautiful, Wonderful - John.
“Mmm,” Sherlock agreed.
“Did you tell the bastard that our family is none of his goddamn business?”
Sherlock’s cock throbbed, and he couldn’t keep from bucking forward, searching for friction. M knelt up to put his knees on Sherlock’s legs. The position effectively pinned his hips down, but M’s kneecaps dug into the soft meat of his thighs. It burned terribly, and he cried out.
“You eating this morning, then?” John asked in surprise. Sherlock didn’t typically eat during cases. Sherlock hummed in response and handed John his sandwich before heading to the table. John seated himself across from Sherlock and watched with happiness as the detective attacked the sandwich with something akin to enthusiasm. Sherlock, noticing John’s attention, set the sandwich down and wiped his mouth.
"Oi! I didn't offer to make you tea!"
John hurried into the lab and saw Greg standing a few feet from Sherlock who was hunched over a baggie on the workbench. Sherlock had the baggie open and was sorting small white pills. John drew in a harsh breath at the sight. He knew Sherlock was on the case, but the sight never got any easier. It always led John’s mind down the path of the past. Seeing in his mind’s eye what Sherlock must have been like back in his drug days. The tableau in front of him mixed with the leftover emotions from the previous night made it harder to block out this time.
“And you said you would never have use for a reusable water bottle.”
“Stephen Strange.”
“I just want everyone to be comfortable.”
He tried to rephrase, but he wasn’t sure the slightly altered inflection was having much affect. “I mean,” he trudged on, “why are you meeting me here, like this. Normally, you have me picked up and brought to you. In fact, we’ve never met in your car. Why…”
“It was pointed out was it? You brilliant man. I love you. This is going to make such a difference.”
Mycroft nodded, and the man retreated.
Greg shrugged. “Not sure to be honest. We know there’s been deaths, but it’s not entirely clear that he’s the one calling the shots. You saw him. A university dropout with some trust fund money. No obligations. No motivation. He’s not got the brains or the access to be manufacturing the drugs he used on Waterman.”
“Have you ever considered a threesome?”
“But what about cases? Do you not want me to…I know I’m getting older and maybe I’m slowing you down, but I do love them.”
“Thank you for the mail.”
“So, we’re looking for a CIA agent?”
"Competent? Convenient?" Mycroft supplied.
Giving up on getting any reading done, John decided a cup of tea would pass the time nicely while he waited for Sherlock to reengage with the world.
Rosie lifted a tiny fist and wiped her nose as she nodded.
John looked at his friend and smiled. He saw hope and hesitation in the man’s eyes, but he did not see fear.
“How did you – where did you hear that name?” he gasped.
Thirty Day Challenge: Day 6 - Hair
The detective draws his legs up under himself and turns his body so he sits sideways. John sits gingerly on the far end and stares resolutely forward. In profile, the strain marking John's face is amplified. His eyes are puffy and ringed by deep wrinkles. His whole frame sags into the sofa as the weight of three years, of endless secrets, of gravity itself bears him down.
A cold greasy feeling settles in John’s stomach as the conversation begins to feel a little too familiar. Magnussen’s sadistic voice echoes through John’s mind.
That wasn’t what he’d been going to say. Sherlock cursed his stupid mouth. This was why getting emotionally involved was inadvisable. It led to sloppy declarations at the most inopportune moments.
By the time he returned to the bathroom with a comfortably worn pair of pajamas, Sherlock was at the sink. He had a towel slung low around his waist and he was painstakingly attempting to shave. The process was slow as he fought against the tremors that shook his hands.
Sherlock blinks hard and chokes down the constriction in his throat. He can still smell that specific blend of medical-grade antiseptic and Clair-de-la-lune. He can still hear the way John's chest rattled and squeezed around each harsh, despairing sob. Every time he closes his eyes, he still sees a soft, warm, unmoving pink bundle cradled to John's chest as salty tears fall on her head like the rain she'll never get to feel. Sherlock doesn’t need to say the word. The memory of his stillborn daughter is etched into every line on John's face.
“Aaaand experiments, does not mean that you get to make the other kids feel bad about it.”
He’s unbearably petty already and all Stephen has done is walk into their flat. He needs to get himself under control.
Greg grimaced at John and came over to join him at a table away from Sherlock, not wanting to interrupt the work. Greg slumped onto a stool.
“I love you, Sherlock. God help me, I do. And I want more, I want everything with you. And I was wondering if, maybe that’s something you might want too?”
John snorts to himself. Sherlock probably knows, but John can’t bring himself to ask. In fact, he can’t think of a single thing to say. The silence stretches as both men fight for their usual on-a-case detachment.
There was something wrong with the way his voice stuttered over the word “administers” but John set that aside and tried to parse the truth from his words.  A million questions clamored for his attention, but John pushed them back selecting the most pressing.
“I thought you turned the case over to narcotics? Isn’t this more their area now?”
M’s face crinkled with anger. The venom in his voice was audible. “You can do better than that!”
Thirty Day Challenge: Day 8 - Cuddles
“I don’t know what you expected Greg to do about it. I mean really, Sherlock. The man can barely put together a romantic evening, not that it matters. I love the sod, dearly, but expecting him to help plan a romantic proposal?”
After several minutes, John gives it up for a loss. He’ll never be able to treat this like just another case. Not when it actually signifies the collapse of the life he has so carefully constructed. He has spent so much energy becoming normal, steady, safe John Watson that he willfully ignored the details that he couldn’t make fit. He should have known better. He’s heard Sherlock berate Scotland Yard often enough.
“Sherlock,” John said seriously. “If we spend the rest of our lives chasing criminals and eating Chinese take-out on the couch at three a.m., I will be the happiest bastard alive.”
John speaks as if the one short sentence explains it all. Sherlock lifts an eyebrow.
Sherlock's hands bunch into fists and his eyes squeeze shut. His frame is vibrating and his breathing is shallow and quick. John stands and walks around the table to crouch by his friend's side.
“Sherlock, I’m sorry, I— “
Sherlock turns back to smile nervously at Molly before leading John down the stairs and out into the night.
“You didn’t seem to have a problem with my
Sherlock rolls his eyes and walks forward to swing open the garden gate. He holds the gate open as John follows him through and shuts it primly, not letting it slam on its hinges. John studies the building, a sense of déjà vu niggles at the back of his mind, but he can’t seem to place it.
John has snuck fully behind Mary and starts to sidle closer, putting him partially into the light. Sherlock’s palms are sweating now, and he’s not sure how much longer he will be able to maintain his calm mask. He is aware that Mary has already noticed the shaking. He’ll be damned if he lets her see the true depths of his weakness.
Curious, Sherlock ventures out of his room and is surprised to see John spreading a blanket over the sofa. He looks sheepishly at Sherlock when he notices his presence.
Sherlock glances down and evades the question by picking at his cuticles. John is having none of it. He grabs Sherlock's hand, forcing him to stop. The contact shocks Sherlock into looking directly into John's eyes and he finds himself compelled to answer.
Sherlock’s lips shaped words that his voice failed to form, and it took John several long moments to figure out what was being murmured repeatedly into his neck.
“You rose quickly, I bet. Jim would have liked you. Sharp, cold, precise. Efficient.”
“No need to be an ass. You know that’s not what I meant. I thought we could work together to get a new antidote ready for you, but what the hell do I know, right?”
John’s eye was drawn up to Sherlock’s neck. The man’s shirt was buttoned all the way up. John wondered if Sherlock had been too distracted this morning to notice he had done them all. He could see it in his mind’s eye. Sherlock’s mind focused inward as he went through the rote motions of getting dressed. Long pale arms slipping into cool soft sleeves. Nimble fingers doing up the buttons one by one until he ran out. Fondness for the disastrous genius flooded John’s system, and he reached up to undo the top button.
Suddenly, John remembered his conversation with Mycroft and the photograph.
John had dropped a kiss on top of Rosie’s head as she rushed by to wrap herself around Sherlock’s legs. She burrowed her face into Sherlock’s hip and clung to him tightly. John’s eyebrows had drawn together in confusion. Rosie never had separation anxiety. She bounded away from them on the first day of preschool and never looked back. But Sherlock had given John a reassuring look as he sat back down and gathered Rosie to him. She nestled her head in the crook of his neck and he kissed her forehead while crooning softly.
“I wanted to be near you. I always want to be near you. I knew you would be late tonight, so I came here to wait. Your bed is warm and smells like you. I wanted to talk, but I think I fell asleep. I’m sorry I joked about it when you got here. I wasn’t awake yet. And I just...”
“No...?”
So much for the quiet. That had taken far less time than he’d thought it would. This was going to be a long night.
The question is soft, but Sherlock flinches as if John had physically hurled it at him. John grips the detective’s hands in his own, offering comfort and an anchor. He runs his thumbs over the soft skin of his palms and waits. Sherlock is very pale and up close, John can tell that he is shaking.
It had been a cheap shot directed at what Sherlock knew was John’s weak underbelly. John was indispensable to the Work. He had always told him so, but John had never quite believed it. A fact that would certainly work to his advantage now.
Sherlock waves off the apology and tries to think of all the things John has done for him when he is sick. He remembers gentle hands and gentler words. Care. John shows him care. He can do that, he thinks. Sherlock clears his throat.
“I really don’t know why you’re saying this, but I think you’re scared. I think you’re fucking terrified, and you don’t know what to do with that.” His gaze scorched Sherlock as it roved over his features. “I can’t make you trust me, Sherlock.” John’s voice cracked over his name. “But I wish to God that you would."
"Because, love, every day with you was a miracle. From the very beginning."
Sherlock watched John, breathless with laughter, as he pressed his finger to his mobile. The screen illuminated his face, and he immediately wished it wouldn’t. He wanted to go back to the moment just before he took out his mobile. He wanted to go back to the laughter and the warmth. When had it gotten so cold? Sherlock’s fingers shook around his mobile, so he clutched it tighter. His breathing turned haggard, and he was thankful that John was still laughing. Maybe he wouldn’t hear the change. Maybe he’d chalk it up to mirth.
“He’s a person!” John shouted. It was loud in the confined space of the car.
“Like what?”
Sherlock glories in the sight of a half-naked John, wrapped in a towel from the waist down, hair askew, and pink-skinned from the heat of the water. John can feel the soft, smooth satin of Sherlock's dressing gown pressing against his own exposed skin as he pulls him closer to deepen the kiss.
Finally, the doors groan open and an exhausted surgeon beckons them over. The cup of tea falls from Sherlock's hands and lies ignored on the floor. The detective has room only for information about John.
“It makes me hungry.” Sherlock admitted guiltily. His voice was so soft, John almost missed it. His tone was apologetic, like he thought John would judge him for the humanity of something as simple as hunger.
John's back was a hard line, a steel cage woven around Sherlock, but his hands were painfully gentle where they held him. One palm came around his neck to cradle Sherlock’s face against his shoulder while the other ran soothing lines up and down his spine. Sherlock shivered. John didn’t shush him or hurry him along. He stayed with Sherlock, giving him the time he needed to come back to himself. John simply was. He existed in Sherlock's periphery. Unshakably firm.
“Sit, please?”
Eventually, Sherlock starts to speak, but his voice is so low that Mycroft can't quite make out the words. He presses his ear to the door and just catches the end.
“Besides, it’s your eyes I should really be going on about...and your byronic curls...”
“And?”
Sherlock shook his head to clear it. It was tiresome having these discussions with John when he was present. He was certainly not going to start having them in his own head.
“He's not unconscious. You’re keeping him sedated. Why?”
John usually enjoyed these types of novels. Sherlock surmised they were an emotional release for him, a way to escape the constraints of everyday life. Not this time, however.  John’s brow was crinkled, and storm clouds brewed in his gaze, turning his usually serene blue eyes into a storm of dark navy.
“Survive what?”
He turns it over and over but there are no clues to be found, except the two words printed on the front: Miss Us?
“So you, what – thought I couldn’t handle it? I am a doctor you know.”
John had interrupted, anticipating Sherlock’s vocabulary choices.
“Now,” John started, “I know neither of us is very good at this sort of thing, but I think it needs to be said. I don’t want there to be any more misunderstandings.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock croaked. A tear ran down his cheek.
“My body was affected by the drug. The rush of hormones stimulated a physical response and the corresponding sexual fugue, but…” his heart stuttered as he remembered what it had felt like to be that person. “My higher thinking remained functional. I was a slave to my body’s drug-induced demand for sex, but I could watch in horror as it happened.”
“You’re so fucking good at that.”
If John had hoped to dissuade questions about Sherlock, he was sorely disappointed.
The man in front of him. That wild beautiful genius –
John didn’t argue or push him away. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and held him close against his body, cradling him away from the sight of any passersby. It was a firm, grounding embrace, but there was an unmistakable edge of protection in it. John was broadening his shoulders as much as possible, creating a physical barrier between Sherlock and the street. John’s soldier instincts coming to the fore. He was protecting Sherlock’s weakness from the eyes of the world.
Sherlock had blushed a bright crimson that stained his cheekbones and sent John's heart into his throat.
Sherlock appreciated John’s steady warmth. It fortified him, shored up the ragged places he hadn’t noticed getting so drafty. He couldn’t deny it. John had seen the cracks in his armor tonight. Truly seen them in a way he had not allowed anyone before to see.
“John!”
John's request is honest and hopeful, so Mrs. Hudson agrees. John even offers up his armchair, but Mrs. Hudson balks at the very idea, settling herself primly onto the sofa. She stretches her legs out gratefully and absently rubs her hip. Sherlock's brows draw down in consternation at the tell-tale signs of pain telegraphed by his landlady's actions. Mrs. Hudson waves off his concern and coaxes him into his armchair.
The trip up to the flat was a blur. In fact, Sherlock did not remember getting out of the cab. He couldn’t recall whether it had been cold outside, whether there had been any wind. He couldn’t remember who paid the cabbie or unlocked the front door. All he knew was that he was standing in the kitchen looking at a sink full of dirty test tubes, beakers, teacups, and god knew what else. He didn’t often keep track of the detritus after he finished an experiment. It was usually tossed in the sink while Sherlock moved on to the next hypothesis. John eventually got fed up enough to wash and put away the odds and ends. Or Mrs. Hudson would.
He tries to keep the accusation out of his tone, but judging by the storm clouds gathering in John’s eyes, he failed.
Thirty Day Challenge: Day 3 - Gifts.
Sherlock nods indulgently but doesn't look entirely convinced.
“Not a euphemism.”
“Sherlock, come in here. Please?”
"Why?"
Without waiting for a welcome he knows will never come, Mycroft Holmes saunters into the flat. He sits himself on the sofa with a primness that would have set John to snickering if he'd had any brainpower to spare. Twisting the umbrella in his hand, Mycroft turns to address Sherlock.
He rushes past the flabbergasted couple and sprints down the block. Sherlock is far away before he detours into a park. He rests against a tree, letting his back slide down the trunk until he is sitting with his knees drawn to his chest. Only then, does he let himself cry.
“I hadn’t…ever,” he swallowed thickly, “
In the wake of Mycroft’s message, however, John found that he could not find it in himself to feel guilty. All he felt was a deep well of terror. What could have happened to shake the great Mycroft Holmes?
Sherlock hides his smile by sitting gingerly on the edge of the sofa. He hopes to escape with the minimum amount of cat hair clinging to his suit as possible. Probably, a futile wish but one tries their best. Toby, the cat is noticeably absent, which means Molly is home somewhere. He refuses to leave her side. Greg has made an effort though. The carpet has fresh indentations from the vacuum cleaner, and the table shines with a recent layer of polish. Greg’s children smile down from gold frames on the mantle and several football pennants hang on the wall. The room is a perfect blend of Greg and Molly.
“He’s told you a million times! That is not your decision to make. This should be something he decides for himself.”
John snaps his “p” the way Sherlock usually does, egging him on. Catching on quickly, Sherlock lowers his head to run his nose along John’s cheek. He inhales deeply, ruffling John’s hair. Most of the tension drains out of John’s shoulders as a shiver runs through him.
“Just because the man was a philandering gold-digger who drained his husband’s bank account in order to take the pool boy on a seven day cruise around the Mediterranean does not give you leave to take whatever poetic license you desire!”
anything. Could anyone really know anything if it was liable to go and change on you the minute you’d catalogued its parts?
John, now completely overwhelmed, just kisses the bloody idiot senseless.
John shuddered at the mental image. “So, Moriarty thinks he died?”
John draws in a deep breath and looks up to meet Sherlock’s gaze.
“Right. I need to check your pulse, okay? I’m going to touch your neck. Is that alright?”
“Sherlock,” John said quietly. He hadn’t wanted to reach for his friend again, given the poor reaction he’d received last time, but he was determined that Sherlock should remain in bed. Surprisingly, the man stopped.
Giving up on the idea of tea, since he can’t reach the tray over the cat anyway, Sherlock looks contemplatively at Molly.
Sherlock squeezes her hands and responds with a single plea.
"My?"
“Alright, time for school. Have you got everything? Book bag? Lunch? Yes? Good. Have a wonderful day.”
“I’ve a present for you, sweetheart,” he murmured softly. Or maybe he’d shouted. Sherlock was having a hard time parsing reality.
“Alright, be that way then. I’ll just enjoy the mystery, shall I?”
John chuckled. “You know what he’s like.”
, John wants to tell him.
“When you said you want to be with me…” he trailed off unable to voice the rest of the question. Despite the lack of communication, John understood perfectly. He leaned in painfully slowly, telegraphing his intention and letting Sherlock recoil if he wanted.
"Now, what were you trying so hard to hide. Hmm?"
John rolls onto his side, propping his arm under his chin to glance at the laptop. Several photographs of a dark-haired woman surround a briefing with ostentatious stamp marks reading:
The DI looked genuinely relieved, squeezed John’s shoulder, and left. He had his mobile pressed to his ear before he’d even made it out of the pub.
John, blinking out of his shock, found his voice.
In that moment, Sherlock made up his mind. He couldn’t be selfish, not with this. He wanted John’s compassion more than anything, and he could not allow himself to give in. John did not ask for this. He’d told John their life might be dangerous, but this was a different sort of danger altogether. John didn’t sign up for this. Sherlock wouldn’t let him sign up for this. He’d not had a choice in so long, but John still did. He couldn’t be allowed to make the wrong choice, not while it was in Sherlock’s power to prevent it.
Sherlock could almost hear John’s indulgent chuckle.
“Talk soon, Greg.” With a poke of his index finger, John disconnected the call. His mind was already churning up an excuse to get him out of the remainder of his shift. He stuffed patient files into his bag, silently promising himself that he’d fill them out tonight once he’d sorted out the issue with Sherlock. He knew he was about to leave the clinic short-staffed again, and he refused to leave them with a flood of paperwork as well.
“You’re quite proud of yourself, aren’t you?”
"It's not unheard of. I had a bit of a relapse when I came home and almost had to go back to hospital, but it's clearing away well enough on its own now. I should be back to full strength any day now."
"Mm. Sh'lock?"
John takes a step backward.
Sherlock folds his arms and clutches his ribs. Perhaps if he squeezes hard enough, he can hold the jagged pieces of himself together. He bows his head against the wind and sets off, quickly researching the nearest Tesco to John and Mary's new home.
“Don’t touch me!”
"Right. We need to get you out of here. Now."
“Yes, John. They were all killed after the message aired.”
“We’ve heard whispers and caught glimpses, but we haven’t had any solid leads. Until now.”
“What the fuck is this? I thought ya said eight o’clock, Sherlock. I come here all gentlemanly and reserved to see this?”
After several minutes, Sherlock hauls himself to his feet, situates the television, and pops in the disk. He settles gingerly into his chair, waits for the disk to load, then presses play on the remote.
“I’ve only been trying to put you first, to keep you from harm. Now, I realize I was acting on my own selfish impulses. I didn’t consider your feelings or opinion on the matter. I acted in the only way I could think of to keep you safely out of this mess. Upon reflection, I realize that was for my benefit because I could not imagine living in a world where you don’t exist.”
Sherlock whines and arches into John’s touch. His arms shake against John’s ears. John sucks delicately against Sherlock’s Adam’s apple and feels Sherlock grind against his thigh. He palms Sherlock's ass and lets his middle finger rest in the crease between his buttocks. John gives gentle pressure that teases while encouraging the grinding. Sherlock is moaning and sucking on John’s ear.
With one more careful look at the bed — not as nice as when John did it, but that was to be expected, because John was perfect — Sherlock exited the bedroom to go see if maybe John would be willing to reenact his fantasy.
Sherlock was pouting. That wasn't anything new. This time, however, was different in that he actually had something worth pouting to pout about.
It’s tender and sweet and perfect, until John runs his hands up Sherlock’s back.
When he opened his eyes and resurfaced in the real world, John was calling to him from the sitting room. "Tea?"
Sherlock froze. They hadn't come close to the "L" word yet, and to be quite frank, he was terrified of saying it. But John had just blurted it out — even if he hadn't quite realised yet what he'd said — and Sherlock was hard-pressed to not say it back.
"Yes, but —"
drummed on his computer thoughtfully.
"Mm?" the detective hums questioningly.
!” He whirls to face Sherlock. “I’m going to put on the kettle and you’re going to put on a dressing gown and come out to the sitting room, and we’re going to
Then they’re kissing again, and John takes Sherlock back to bed and they pick up where they’d left off. As they cling together in the afterglow, John whispers, “I think I love you, Sherlock Holmes.”
When John re-entered the kitchen, the floor was sparkling clean, the dishes were on the drying rack, and, though he didn't discover until later, there were three rolls of sopping wet paper towels in the garbage.
Sherlock
John had to show Sherlock how to make the bed. Being a doctor, he always made it with hospital corners, so he demonstrated how to tuck and crease with military precision and medical efficiency. Then he promptly pulled all the sheets off the bed into a heap and left Sherlock to his task.
When John speaks, his voice is low and full of sorrow. “Why didn’t you tell me — when you came back? Did you still not trust me to know these things about you?”
Sherlock didn't smile, but his mouth softened a bit in his version of one. "I do. God help me, but I do."
John had promised him a kiss for every item he owned that he put in its respective place instead of leaving it out around the flat in various spots it didn't belong.
, he'd shaken his head and fondly called Sherlock a "spoiled, rich ponce."
"Is it dated correctly?" Sherlock asks from the kitchen. "If the date's right, it, by default, is my to-do list from today."
He wrapped an arm around John, and buried his nose in John's neck, and told his John
He rewarded Sherlock with another snog, and the detective made sure that the faucet wasn't on before melting into the kiss.
He remembered when his feet, bare as usual, detected water on the floor. Pulling away from John hurriedly, and thanking gods he didn't believe in that the blond was faced away from the sink, he made some excuse for John to go find something in his room — that wasn't really there — while he cleaned up the mess.
Sherlock took a deep breath and says, “Moriarty had three snipers on the people he knew I would miss most the day I — when I fell. One on Lestrade. One on Mrs. Hudson. One on —” his Adam’s apple bobs “— one on you.”
— and made of a silky fabric that always felt cool to the touch. When John had first seen his sheets, somewhere in the second month of living together
"So they weren't wasting time," drawls Sherlock. "Every one of the cases were mundane enough even for the police; I was preserving my brain cells — and yours."
And when they tire of the soft, gentle coupling, John will flip Sherlock over. And he will see.
"How did today go, then?" John asked from the sofa. His laptop was open on his lap, and from the coloured glow reflected in his eyes and on his face, Sherlock deduced that he was looking at his blog page.
Sherlock raised his eyes to lock onto John’s.
John jerked into awareness abruptly the next morning to find his field of vision blocked by high sharp cheekbones and a long, crooked nose. Sherlock was bent over him on the bed, his face so close to John’s that his curls were brushing John’s forehead. His long fine fingers rested against John’s pillow on either side, and he could feel the slow steady puffs of Sherlock’s breath on his face. The most startling realization of the entire situation was that John was not all that startled. Waking up to see Sherlock looming over him was certainly unexpected, but not, John was surprised to discover, unwelcome. He met Sherlock’s gaze, feeling a tender warmth unfurl within his chest.
“Unbelievably. Yes. Very happy. We both are.”
There were less than a handful of people that John cared about in his life. Sherlock would know if John’s distress pertained to Sherlock himself or Mrs. Hudson, so he could rule them out. That only left Mike, Bill, and Harry. Sherlock had just spoken with Mike that morning about the identical twin livers he needed for his next experiment on metabolic rates of indigenous poisonous flora. That left Bill and Harry. Bill’s correlation to John’s memories of the war could be behind the return of the tremor, but the balance of probability tipped toward Harry. She and John had been on speaking terms again lately. Just yesterday John had told him that she was six weeks sober…
“Annabelle died just after her twentieth birthday on a study abroad trip in Vienna.”
Sherlock stalks toward the exit. Lestrade catches him just outside.
He quickly becomes concerned as John stumbles. Sherlock drops to his knees and catches John as his legs refuse to support him any longer. The gun drops from his lax hand, and his eyes flutter. Sherlock frantically searches for the injury that must be causing this reaction.
John grinned in spite of himself.
John’s heart gave a savage throb at the unbridled vulnerability reflected in Sherlock’s eyes. His uncertainty was a drastic change from his usual cold, arrogant façade, and the difference was impossible to ignore. He looked impossibly young and entirely unequipped for this situation. His gaze was almost pleading.
He grabs the banister and starts up the stairs.
His feet carried him across the asphalt without conscious thought. A taxi braked hard to avoid hitting him, but he barely noticed the annoyed shouting and honking. His eyes were fixed on the restaurant with a horrified sort of fascination. No part of him wanted to go in there, but he did want to know why he’d been summoned. After all this time, what could he possibly have to offer?
He always knew, deep in his bones, that it had only ever been a dream. He allows himself to finally notice all the discrepancies. He recalls every moment the reality of Mary stretched the boundaries of the fantasy and every time he’d knowingly turned a blind eye. He remembers
Sherlock turns his back on the kettle and notices the small pile of mail. He might as well get it sorted: bill, bill, past due notice, advert, advert, client request, bank statement, letter from Mummy, advert, client request…
As he rounds the corner onto Baker Street, a sweet jaunty melody echoes off the buildings. Curiousity piqued, Sherlock looks around for the source. Classical music is a strange choice for most people. The street is packed but not a single person is humming. Strange.
Sherlock can’t imagine what Mary needs to convey that hadn’t been conveyed in the two prior disks. The postmortem notes are actually getting a bit cruel now. The constant reminder to John of his dead wife is a bit not good. Hopefully, this will be the last. Hopefully, they can let her be at peace.
"Not an actual relapse. For god's sake, John, keep up. You need a viable reason to stay away from your house.  So, I orchestrated a relapse. This way, you can tell Mary that I am struggling with my sobriety and stay here without raising her suspicions. I assumed actually relapsing would have been taking it too far, but Wiggins is still an active user, so I asked him for a sample. Once I explained it was a stand-in for me, he was more than happy to oblige."
"Why did you hide the file? Does it have to do with Moriarty? Can't I help? I want to help."
Sherlock tucks himself into a chair and lets the cup warm his fingers while they wait. Time passes with no word on John's condition. Mycroft takes off his suit jacket. Lestrade alternates between sitting and standing. The tea grows cold. No one speaks.
“What is it?”
John took the folder from Greg and slipped it into his jacket. If Sherlock was still intent on destroying the flat when he got back, this could be the very distraction he needed. Besides, John couldn’t ignore five dead bodies. He’d hide the violin if that’s what it took to get Sherlock onto this. The sooner he solves it, the better for everyone involved. Interpreting John’s actions correctly, Greg’s whole body relaxed. John hadn’t realized he was so nervous.
“Sherlock.”
John looked over Greg’s shoulder at the curved line of Sherlock’s spine. He looked well and truly fascinated.
“I got to hold him, feel him, fuck him and you got to suffer. Every moment you spent getting whipped, kicked, burnt, choked in Venezuela, Moscow, or Serbia, was a moment I spent touching, tasting, having John. And it worked. He
John walked down the long, narrow hall like a man headed to his own execution. He had no idea what to expect upon entry. The hall itself projected an air of sullen superiority with its rich tapestries and gilt-framed oil portraits.
John would not make him regret it by forcing him to answer all the questions burning through John’s mind.
[TEXT] Addlestone at 9. Alone and unarmed. – SH
He helps Sherlock to his feet and slides the dressing gown back up his shoulders. He pulls the man into one last, lingering kiss before swatting his arse.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered closed and his lips were drawn in resignation. His hands tightened like vices around John’s biceps.
Annoyed by the man's antics, John looked around the large entry way for any sign of Sherlock. He was surprised to find none. There was no tell-tale Belstaff hanging by the door. There was no combative invective being hurled down the halls. In fact, the manor was eerily quiet. John's anger flared again as he realized he'd have to stoop to asking Sherlock's brother to show him to his friend.
John shrank back against the cupboards as Sherlock raved. “I didn’t tell you about the antidote because I knew you wouldn’t understand. I NEED IT, JOHN!” He screamed the last part.
Greg paused, and John sucked in a breath, clearly surprised to see that the DI’s face had gone deep red. Sherlock could feel the awkwardness spooling out. This could turn into a long, convoluted conversation if he didn’t step in.
John’s words are muffled by Sherlock’s shirt, but he can feel the warmth of John’s breath against his skin as John speaks.
Now John’s throat catches.
“Yes. Fucking come for me. That’s it. Yeah, such a pretty cock.”
John's heart races with the anticipation of seeing his friend.
“John!”
He casts a long glance back and catches Sherlock's gaze in the mirror. The detective nods his gratitude and the corner of Mycroft's lip twitches upward in acknowledgement. Lestrade remains oblivious. Once the two men are out of view, Sherlock rinses his face with cool water. The chill revives him and he slides his emotional detachment back into place. There will be time for vulnerability later, but right now John needs him to keep it together. By the time he is done, the only tell of his mental state is the small quiver of his hands as he dries his face.
[ ] Y = Yes
“Think that I lead you on?”
Sherlock closes his eyes, trying to keep everything on the inside, not allowing anything to leak out. It’s so fragile now. He can’t afford any displays or ambiguous tells in this very now. The intensity is not about the pain and it’s neither is it about love. Love has nothing to do with it.
Sherlock's heart beats too rapidly for approximately 23 minutes after the kiss.
- in the alcove, waiting for time to pass by before he returns to the flat.
Major depressive disorder (MDD) (also known as clinical depression, major depression, unipolar depression, or unipolar disorder; or as recurrent depression in the case of repeated episodes) is a mental disorder characterized by a pervasive and persistent low mood that is accompanied by low self-esteem and by a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. The term "depression" is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or simply to a low mood. Major depressive disorder is a disabling condition that adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit suicide, and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder.
It’s tempting to immediately rule out the seemingly paradoxical “Disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood or adolescence” category, not only because, whatever he might have, it hasn’t been diagnosed yet and he’s nearing the end of his adolescence, but also because it includes some of the more offensive diagnoses suggested by the incompetent psychiatrists of his childhood. “Development disorder”... Already at age nine, the mere idea of having such thing had made him throw some of his more vile insults at the face of the chain-smoking excuse for a psychiatrist who had mentioned the possibility to his mother. Still, Sherlock requires more rigorous criteria than instinctive response alone, so he sets the category aside while sorting the rest of the more likely disorders.
Two-and-a-half years spent obscuring the fact that there’s something terribly wrong with him come to an abrupt stop as Sherlock is admitted to the rehabilitation clinic for the second time in as many weeks. This time, he won’t be able to leave after three days as he did before, because this admission is not a so-called voluntary one. Sherlock knows that this is an ending, but he’s not sure if this will be the end of his days with the drugs or simply the end of his days.
