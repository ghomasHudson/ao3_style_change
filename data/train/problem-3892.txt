Dean whined and moaned as Castiel’s knot swelled to fill him. “Please Alpha, wanna come! Alpha!” He moaned, struggling to get out the words. “Good fuckhole, please!”
It wasn’t until the Alpha’s knot started to swell and Dean’s own cock was hard and aching that he remembered his new rule. With a moan he gasped out, “Please Alpha, can I come?”
Castiel kissed Dean’s neck again. “Get some sleep. Tomorrow will be another busy day for you.”
Dean’s stomach twisted, conflicted between humiliation and desire to obey his new mate. He hung his head and slowly crawled behind the alpha.
“That’s it,” Castiel said, encouraging the stranger. “He’s a good slut, fuck him harder, he can take it.”
Dean’s mind was spinning. He’d never wanted anything more in his entire life. “Oh please, yes Alpha, I need to be owned! Oh god, please!”
“I think he wants a knot in his mouth,” Castiel said with a chuckle, winking at Benny as he put his hard cock away. “Will you take care of him please?”
Dean flushed red but didn’t say anything. He couldn’t deny it, he loved it. All of it, even the dirty words Benny was using to describe him.
Castiel grinned and pulled off Dean entirely. “Present yourself for me, baby. And beg for my knot.”
Dean’s face fell. “Oh, but please Alpha, I want to know more!” he begged, still gently stroking Castiel’s cock.
When they stepped inside, Dean’s senses were momentarily overwhelmed. The scent of powerful Alphas was intoxicating, and his legs went a little weak. The scent and sound of omegas being knotted made Dean’s own channel ache with the need to be filled. He tried to keep his eyes ducked submissively, but he still peaked out the corners of his vision, taking in the dark and handsome decor, as well as some very interested Alphas watching his arrival. He tried not to look at the omega being knotted in the lounge just inside the door, too embarrassed to look directly at him, knowing that would probably be him soon.
“Aw shit,” Dean swore, finally noticing the cop in his rearview mirror, lights blazing. He wondered how long he’d been back there. He quickly pulled over to the side of the road and turned off the car, rolling down the window while he waited for the cop.
“Do you like that?” Castiel asked with a smile, moving to pick up the silver ring off the bed.
He finally slumped, realizing he wasn’t going to get out of this. And even if he did, it wouldn’t matter. He was owned now, if this is how his alphas wanted to keep him, there was nothing he could do about it.
“What more could you possibly want to know?” Castiel snapped.
Dean’s mind was spinning as he came down from his own orgasm, and his brain was catching up to everything he’d just said. He blushed again as he thought about what was in store for him with his new mate.
Dean did. He always did.
Dean continued to try and get out of the bondage. But with the gag in his mouth and the mitts on his hands, he was completely helpless. The buckles on the mitts were sturdy and the straps were stiff, it would require a strong grip to undo them. And without his hands he couldn’t remove the collar or the leash, or undo the simple clip on the wall.
Castiel chuckled and started to pump Dean’s cock faster and rut his knot against Dean’s prostate at the same time. “Okay little bitch, come for your Alpha.”
Dean followed obediently, nerves and excitement warring in his stomach. He couldn’t wait.
in excitement.
Benny went back to finishing his breakfast while waiting out his knot, even being kind enough to give Dean a couple extra bites. When his knot when down he pulled Dean free and quickly replugged him before any seed could escape, then passed him off to the eager hands of Gadreel.
Castiel handed Dean’s leash to Benny and sat down on the other end of the couch, right by Dean’s backside. He stroked the swell of Dean’s ass gently. “We don’t think you’re ready for a proper knot yet puppy, you’re still recovering from your heat, but we wanted to give you a reward for doing so well on your training.”
“Hello Dean,” Castiel replied, his eyes bright with interest. “What can I do for you?”
Dean obediently held his sit position while Castiel and Benny cooked dinner. He told himself he was just too tired to fight it.
Castiel smiled and kissed Dean’s neck. “That’s my good bitch. Good boy.”
“That’s it, good puppy,” Cas said, petting Dean’s hair. “I know this is scary, but we’re going to take such good care of you. Train you into a proper little breeding puppy.”
“We’re highly compatible,” Castiel said, continuing to explain to his coworkers. “It seems to have triggered a mutual rut and heat. But I’ve got a half an hour until this knot goes down and the next wave hits, so let us continue.” His next comments were for Dean, spoken right in his ear, but still loud enough for all to hear. “After that I have a new omega to breed up, I want him swollen with pups by next quarter.”
He didn’t wait any longer before he started to move on Castiel’s lap, leaning back against his chest as he started to move up and down on his alpha’s thick cock. He knew just how he looked, his little cock was hard and tenting the front of his panties, and the scent of slick was heavy on the air. Nobody ever doubted how much Dean wanted his alpha.
“Yes he is,” Castiel said with a chuckle. Apparently he had no problem letting Benny grope Dean as he pleased. Dean found that he actually didn’t mind, he liked the touch of Benny’s strong hands on his ass. It was somehow both reassuring and arousing.
Finally satisfied, Castiel sat up, looking down at his omega. He was naked, knotted, and marked, and the alpha watched as his belly pulsed and swelled as his knot steadily bred him full. His eyes were closed, exhausted and breathing hard. It was the best thing he’d ever seen.
“Yes, he does,” Castiel agreed. He gave Dean another pat. “Such a good boy. Just relax for a while, puppy.”
“You want to be fucked by an alpha?” Castiel growled, yanking Dean’s shirt over his head before moving to his pants. He wanted the boy naked,
“Good boy,” Castiel praised, smiling while he strapped Dean into the diaper with a quickness that betrayed a lot of practice. He then picked up the onesie and helped Dean into it, tugging it down under Dean’s ass so he could button it to cover the diaper. It was blue with pink print that read ‘
Dean was shocked when he felt a shiver of pleasure go through his body at his alpha’s words. He was too overwhelmed to ask any more questions, conflicted between his body and his mind. It was all he could do to simply relax into the alpha’s kind touch.
“No dogs in the kitchen,” Benny scolded. He smiled down at Dean. “Other than the puppy, he needs to stay close right now.”
“So?! So, you were throwing yourself at an alpha! You,
kink. Just thinking about using the word was making Dean’s dick twitch, and he could already feel himself getting a little slick.
Castiel dried them both off before getting dressed, leaving Dean in just his collar and plug as usual, before the two of them made their way downstairs.
“Should I get cleaned up, Alpha?” Dean asked, nervously. Even with the plug there was a little slick and seed leaking out, and he knew everyone would smell it.
Dean whimpered and pushed his ass up when he felt his alpha’s hands on his skin, and he gasped when he finally felt the plug pull free. He moaned and opened his mouth before Benny even got there, eager for the promise of being filled from both ends.
Dean cried out as he was set down on the grass, squirming and trying to get back inside. But Benny held the leash tight while Cas closed the door, the two alphas staying outside with him.
Dean wasn’t the only bitch in the pack, several other alphas had their own human bitches, some newer than Dean, others now so swollen with their pregnancies that they could not leave their dens. Even though they were at least half male omegas they were all strictly female in the pack’s eyes, something which Dean found rather embarrassing.
“Dean,” he replied softly, embarrassed by how eagerly he’d taken the strange Alpha’s cock.
Dean flushed, ducking his head in embarrassment. And yet he felt a spark of arousal just knowing he’d be seen in this condition. “Yes, Alpha,” he murmured, face pink and eyes low.
Benny grunted as he came, knot tying them together as the Alpha’s seed filled the omega. Benny let out a soft groan and leaned over Dean, bracing himself with an arm on the bed. “Damn, you feel so good on my knot, little bitch. We’re doing this again before I give you back to Cas.”
“That’s what you needed,” Castiel said, speaking into Dean’s ear with a rough voice. “Just can’t go more than a damn hour without being fucked today, my little slut. You’ll happily take anything up your ass, won’t you?”
On his way into the city, Castiel decided to stop for coffee. He had a favorite cafe and they happened to be on the way, so he took only a slight detour before he was pulling into the parking lot. Not wanting his car to get dinged, he made for the empty far side of the lot and parked. As he climbed out of the car and turned to head inside he was stopped by an intriguing scent.
Dean slumped into submission as he realized he was going to have to accept this humiliation. He slowly crawled further out on the lawn, looking around nervously. The yard seemed suddenly huge, and he was grateful for the tall privacy fence. He looked forlornly to his house, realizing it belonged to the two alphas now, as much their property as he was.
Turned out being the property of a conservative alpha meant he didn’t make many of his own choices anymore. Castiel chose everything from his clothes, to where to knot him, and when to breed him. The alpha kept Dean plugged and collared at all times, and even controlled when and if Dean was allowed to orgasm.
Suddenly Dean was yanked upright so that his back was flush to Castiel’s chest, and before he could adjust to the new position he felt the alpha’s teeth sink into his neck, claiming the omega and pushing him over the edge of a blinding orgasm. He could only scream with pleasure as his now mate continued to fuck him while holding his neck in his teeth, until he too finally came and his knot tied the two of them together.
“Fine. I’ll make sure you never want an omega dick in that greedy hole ever again, make sure nothing short of a massive alpha knot will ever be enough!”
But then, just as the alpha was going for Dean’s belt he’d stopped and pulled back. Dean could still hear his words echoing in his head.
Dean gaped for a moment at the man’s beautiful blue eyes before he found the words to speak. “Yes. One room, two beds.” He glanced at Sam then back at the man. “He’s my brother, he’s not my Alpha. I don’t have an Alpha.”
Dean looked down at the items laid out on the bed. There was a black leather jacket very similar to the one Castiel wore, only his was a short cropped style. There was a pair of black leather shorts that were so small he thought they were perhaps supposed to be underwear, and tall black boots that look like they’d come at least halfway up his calves. There was a silver ring, too big to fit on a finger, but too small to be a bracelet. Next to it was a round black plastic thing with what looked like a little handle attached to it, this was a mystery to Dean just as much as the last item. The final one Dean recognized, it was a thick, black leather collar, with a silver plaque engraved with ‘Property of Castiel Novak’ on it. Just the sight of it made more slick leak from Dean’s hole.
Dean wasn’t sure what to do with his new—small—freedom. He looked nervously to the two alphas, who had gone back to preparing their own dinner. He decided to look around the rest of the house, maybe see if he could find a way out.
A new voice chuckled nearby. “Glad to see you finally got yourself a good bitch, Cassy.”
Castiel smiled at Dean, pride shining in his eyes, then lead him to the door.
He crawled into the living room, looking around a little more carefully now. There was a couch and a TV, and four dog beds along the wall, including the one he’d been sleeping on earlier. He spotted the front door, and he crawled over to investigate.
There was only a regular knob and deadbolt, and Dean got up on his knees, hoping he’d be able to open it. He pawed at the knob, but the smooth leather of his mitts slipped uselessly against it, and no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t get a grip on it. He finally gave up and dropped back down to all fours, dejectedly crawling away.
Dean hung his head as he slunk back over to the alphas, to embarrassed to look at them, but still wanting back into the warmth of the house.
Castiel smiled into Dean’s neck and rubbed his full belly. “We’d better get you into a diaper, you’re very full, aren’t you baby boy?”
Castiel seemed to fully wake and realize the scents on his omega weren’t strangers, that they were his new pack Alphas. His eyes were still dark with lust and the need to claim his mate, and he bit down on the side of Dean’s neck, sucking hard and leaving a bright mark.
“What the hell are you doing?” Castiel snapped, snatching Dean’s wrist in his hand and pulling it away.
Dean’s whole body seemed to melt in shock and pleasure, overcome by so many overwhelming sensations. He was mated. He was tied to his mate’s knot. He was going to be a pack bitch. It was almost too much.
“Not until you go potty,” Castiel said, watching Dean with a fond smile. “You’re a puppy, puppies go potty outside.”
Dean winced. “It means you have to spank me.”
Dean was suddenly more awake, waiting anxiously as the Alpha’s steps came closer. There was a knock at the door.
Suddenly Dean heard footsteps, then Benny’s deep voice.
Everything was a haze of pleasure and raw instinct when the alphas finally relaxed enough to pull out, then immediately manhandled Dean to turn him around, their cocks already hard again and driving into Dean. He distantly realized his heat must have triggered their rut.
Dean’s heart raced as the bedroom door opened, revealing a big, muscular Alpha filling the doorway. The animal lust in the man’s eyes belayed his otherwise calm demeanor, and Dean trembled a little nervously.
“I’m so sorry, Alpha, I’m so sorry!” He mumbled, face still pressed to the cool desk. “Thank you for punishing me, I can be a good fuck toy, I promise!”
agree with this philosophy. He was an independent omega and determined to remain so. The two had butt heads over this difference in opinion more than once.
Dean yelped a little when the alpha grabbed him, but he only went after Castiel’s dick again, this time with his other hand. “Please Alpha, I just want to see it!” he begged. “I’m supposed to take an alpha’s cock someday, I just want to know how big they are!”
Dean also noticed there weren’t any pants.
“Yes, Alpha,” Dean said, blushing a pretty pink. “Thank you, Alpha.”
“Good boy, good sit,” Castiel praised, running his fingers gently through Dean’s hair. “Good sit,” he repeated, hooking the leash to Dean’s collar again.
Dean jumped, looking up at bright blue eyes. Castiel was awake and staring at him intently.
Dean looked down at his caged cock where it hung between his legs, and saw his cum slowly dribbling onto the pee pad below him. He whimpered as Castiel’s ministrations continued, dragging out the gentle pleasure, and as his cock continued to leak come he realized why it was called milking.
Castiel smiled when he saw Dean, familiar interest sparkling in his eyes, and Dean ducked his eyes submissively and returned the smile. He slipped in close to his mate, nuzzling at his neck and pressing up against his chest. He smiled when he felt his alpha grab the back of his robe and pull it off.
“Promise?”
“Yes,” Dean answered, honestly and easily. “Wish it was your knot though,” he admitted, then blushed a little when he realized how desperate that made him sound.
did I think anyone would be able to tame Dean, he’s always been the most wild and disobedient omega I’ve ever known.” His face lit up in a huge smile. “But you’ve got him perfectly trained, obedient and submissive, it’s wonderful! How the hell did you do it?”
Castiel appeared bemused, but continued. “Very well, one room with two queen beds.” The alpha gave Dean a considering look that made Dean squirm.
Dean whimpered, but he found himself replying, “Yes, Alpha,” without seconding guessing it.
Dean let out a little moan, opening his eyes, looking up at Castiel with a small smile.
“Mine,” Castiel growled, reaching out and grabbing Dean’s hair in his hand, tugging on it as he pounded into the omega under him.
Dean sat, and again he was praised. And again, the moment Castiel was gone, he went defiantly back to his cross legged position.
Dean came back to him when he was fourteen, trained for perfect obedience and submission, and conditioned to crave his alpha. He’d still had his virginity of course, and Castiel had thoroughly enjoyed taking it.
“I guess that’s one way to put an end to all your independent omega nonsense,” Castiel said with a chuckle, kissing the side of Dean’s neck. “You’re an owned omega now.”
The teenager looked up at Castiel with wide eyes, somehow both scared and defiant. He was stunning, green eyes and freckled cheeks, absolutely gorgeous. And he smelled amazing, he was fertile and clearly compatible with Castiel.
The whole time Dean worked Benny’s cock, Castiel was playing with the remote, running the vibrations up and down, making Dean moan and squirm. He was putting on quite the show.
Dean just whimpered as Castiel continued to fuck him, knot growing until the omega started to shake with pleasure. With a snap of his hips, Castiel slammed his knot deep into Dean, and the omega suddenly came hard as the alpha continued to drive into him. Castiel groaned when he realized the omega orgasmed dry, yet another thing he loved about castrated omegas.
But he hadn’t run. He’d stayed. And the alpha had claimed him.
Dean let out a little moan, grinding against Benny’s lap. “Oh yes, Alpha. Wanna be a good fuckhole, all filled up.” His face was bright pink in response to his own words.
Benny grinned. “That’s a wonderful idea. Come back with a looker and we can take him out to your favorite swanky bars, I’m sure that would help us with recruitment.”
Dean let out a pitiful whine, need and humiliation warring inside him. But he desperately wanted to come, and that won out. “Please, Alpha,” he begged. “Can I please come?”
Castiel realized he was taking this way too far, and he quickly removed his hands from the tempting boy. “You’re perfectly normal Dean, and fully fertile. Please pull up your pants and return to your desk.”
Dean was vaguely aware of the commotion behind him as the other alphas tried to move to his defense. He gasped as he was suddenly spun in the alpha’s arms, so that his back was pressed to the alpha’s chest, and the two of them faced the rest of the room. Castiel’s firm cock pressed to Dean’s ass through the layers of their slacks, and the omega couldn’t stop the wanton moan that escaped him.
Dean smiled at Castiel. “Thank you.” He bit his lip and looked at his lap. “There’s one other thing…”
Without thinking twice, Castiel’s hand grabbed the lock on Dean’s collar, snapping it off with a sharp twist of his wrist. In another moment he had the collar off the omega’s neck and his teeth sunk deep into the bared neck of his new mate.
“Good little bitch,” Benny praised. “Now go find Balthazar and Gadreel. It’s their turn to knot you.”
The man released the bite and lapped at the mark before replying. “My name is Castiel, and I’m your alpha,” he said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “I’m taking you back to my pack to be my bitch.”
Castiel and Benny started talking about which bars they wanted to hit up that night and which Alphas they wanted to meet up with. Dean didn’t know any of the names, so he just started to tune it out. Castiel continued to feed both Dean and himself, and about the time the three of them finished eating, Castiel’s knot started to relax. Castiel picked Dean up easily and pulled him off the Alpha’s soft cock. Dean winced as he felt come and slick leak out his hole and down the inside of his legs.
Dean could only moan into the couch cushion.
Dean blushed at the alphas words, at their insistence on praising him like a real dog. All he could do was follow them back into the house.
There was also a staircase, but Dean decided he didn’t want to crawl up the stairs. Besides, there wasn’t going to be a way out of the house up there. He let out a long sigh, realizing he was wasting his time.
Dean seemed to catch his alpha’s scent, and his eyes slowly blinked open, looking up at Castiel slowly approaching. He perked up, sitting up straight, letting the furs fall off.
“Do you see how full his belly is? He’s swollen with it!”
As hot as Dean was, he and Castiel just did not get along. Castiel was a traditional alpha, he expected omegas to get mated, have pups, and generally obey their alphas. Dean however did
Dean just moaned louder. “Yes, Alpha. Oh please,” he gasped out, overwhelmed by the rough treatment he was getting. It just felt so damn good. “Wanna be used, please!”
Dean couldn’t believe this Alpha was talking about him as if he were some sort of toy to amuse his Alphas. But he was more shocked at how his body was reacting to the Alpha’s words, the trickle of slick was now gushing and soaking his jeans. He hadn’t expected to be so turned on by the prospect of becoming a sex slave to a pack of Alphas, but there was no denying it. He glanced out the car window, trying to convince himself to just leave. But the Alpha was right, the streets were dangerous and he’d end up claimed eventually, and probably not to an Alpha who could provide the resources this man was offering.
While Dean slowly fucked himself on his alpha’s cock, Castiel somehow managed to hold a normal conversation with his guests. He didn’t move from his spot, let them come and go as they pleased, but he spoke with each of them. All the while his hands were all over Dean, teasing him, tracing his body and playing with his cock.
Dean moaned as he continued to fuck himself with the dildo, desperately trying to get whatever relief the toy would grant him. He didn’t even try to muffle the sounds, that was the best part of owning his own home. He could shut himself in his bedroom and be as loud as he wanted, for as long as his heat lasted.
Sam fell asleep easily that night, but Dean did not. His mind was full of thoughts of the alpha downstairs, and as soon as he decided Sam was in a deep enough sleep he got out of bed. He pulled on a pair of jeans and a teeshirt, not bothering with shoes before he padded out of the room, grabbing a keycard and putting it in his back pocket before letting the door close quietly behind him.
“You’re so sensitive and responsive,” Benny said, teasing Dean’s chest. “We’re going to have so much fun.”
“Oh, you plugged him!” Benny commented. “Probably a good idea, he’s a messy little slut.”
Dean knew his training had included scent conditioning, but he knew it was so much more than that. Castiel was his true mate, and Dean was blissfully happy to know he would spend the rest of his life pleasing him. He was convinced it was the only thing an omega truly wanted.
Dean didn’t even bother to glance at the new Alpha, he was too content with his first double knotting to care about anything else.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” the Alpha said. “My name is Castiel, what’s yours?”
Castiel smiled and crossed the room to press a gentle kiss to Dean’s lips. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmured.
Dean moaned. Yes, he wanted that so desperately, wanted to watch his belly swell with his alpha’s pups.
Castiel chuckled. “Good little fuck toy is all full of come. Now go back to bed, I know you didn’t sleep much last night. When you wake up, come find me in my office, I’m sure I’ll be ready to fuck you again by then.”
Dean whimpered as he was roughly stripped naked, and he grabbed for Castiel. “Yes, yes, please!”
Dean whimpered in fear when he felt the wolf’s thick cock stabbing at his ass, trying to find entrance. Then it suddenly found it’s mark and Dean cried out as the thick head pushed inside, then slammed in deep. Immediately the wolf set a brutal pace, cock pistoning into Dean as only an animal can, with no concern for the small omega. Dean’s mouth hung open as he cried out with each harsh thrust of the beast’s cock, which was somehow growing thicker and longer with each pass.
Castiel snarled as he slammed in harder, driving in the last few inches until his heavy balls finally slapped against Dean’s ass and his massive cock was blissfully fully seated inside the little omega. He stilled for a moment to enjoy it before he started to move again, hips snapping as he thrust deep inside Dean.
“Thank you, Alpha,” Dean said, whimpering a little in response to Benny’s touch.
Dean moaned into the couch. “Yes, Alpha, please!” he begged, pushing his ass up higher. He was overcome by a new desire to be filled up by the alpha, to be bred full of pups.
There was just one problem, Castiel was tall and broad, and endowed with a rather
“Goodnight, Sam!” Dean called back, without looking away from Castiel. “Where were we?”
“Good bitch,” Castiel praised with a smile, petting Dean’s hair.
The first thing to hit Dean was the almost overwhelming scent of eight alphas in one room. That would be a little much for any omega, but something was different. One scent seems to stand out, seemed to demand Dean’s attention.
Dean stopped begging, submitting to Castiel. But he continued to whimper and moan, writhing on the table in an overwhelming mix of pain and pleasure. “So big, so big, oh god!” he gasped out, eyes wet with tears.
He heard the sounds of alphas trying to speak over each other, clamoring for Castiel’s attention. Dean didn’t pay it any mind.
When the meal was over, Castiel turned to Dean. “Baby, I can tell you need to suckle, come on.”
Dean let out a long moan as the Alpha drove into him hard, his heavy balls slapping against him with each thrust. He gripped the edge of the counter tightly to hold on, his little cock hard and pressing into the side of the cabinet. He couldn’t think at all when he was being used like this, he quickly lost himself in the overwhelming pleasure and instinct to submit.
Castiel just smiled and sat down for his own breakfast.
Castiel grabbed Dean by the hair and pulled his head back so he could kiss him as he fucked him. “They can knot you all night long,” he growled. “But you’re still
Dean moaned as each stroke hit his sweet spot. “Oh yes Daddy, please, more!”
“It looks perfect,” Castiel said, his hands caressing the round swell of Dean’s ass, his thumb finding the puckered hole and circling it before pressing inside.
Castiel opened the slider door. “He’s doing so well, let’s give him a little time off the leash and see how he does with that.”
“Come on, baby,” Castiel said, leading him over to the high backed chair. He dropped a pillow in front of it before taking a seat. “You’re going to keep me warm while we wait for our guests to arrive.”
His hood was pulled over his head, so he heard the Jaguar before he saw it. The sound of such a beautiful car was music to Dean, and he gaped for a moment as it pulled up to the curb not too far from him. When the handsome, dark-haired Alpha stepped out of the car Dean bit his lip, afraid the sight of such a gorgeous Alpha in an expensive suit would make him slick, the last thing he needed was to reek of horny omega. Dean ducked his face down and pulled his hood down further.
Castiel noticed a little more slick was escaping and running down the inside of Dean’s leg. “Slick production looks normal,” he said with a chuckle. “Let’s take a look.” He gently spun the boy around using his strong hands on his hips, and Dean moved willingly. “Bend over and spread your legs for me, Dean.”
They were also true mates, a fact that made Dean truly devoted to him, more than training alone could ever achieve. The omega was nineteen now, and he was just as perfect as the day he’d been purchased.
The next thing Dean knew they’d ended up in the back room on a couch. The alpha had just smelled
A few hours later, Dean and the three Alphas had made their way into the living room. Dean was sprawled on the couch, his ass on Balthazar’s lap, tied to his knot, and his face resting on Benny’s lap. Balthazar had to sit sideways to make the position work, but it seemed to be pleasing all of them.
Benny growled and pulled Dean to him. “I’m fucking him first,” he said firmly, eyes daring the other two Alphas to challenge him.
Castiel groaned and slammed into Dean one last time, knot swelling to tie them together as his seed pumped him full. He collapsed onto his omega and wrapped his arms around him tight, burying his face in his neck as he pulled them both over onto their sides.
Castiel finally let his mind drift to the party later that night, and he pulled out his phone to text one of the house omegas, summoning her.
Castiel growled. “He submits to me!” One arm was around Dean’s chest, and the other was already fumbling with Dean’s belt.
“Not yet,” Castiel said with a grunt, driving hard into Dean. “Not until my knot fills you up.”
“Business is excellent,” Gabriel said, sounding pleased. “My little joint seems to be the hot place these days for powerful Alphas like yourself.” He paused for a second, and Dean was sure he could feel the Alpha’s eyes on his body. “If I weren’t already the head of my own pack, I would seriously consider joining yours Castiel, just for a shot at your pretty little bitch. He’s quite gorgeous.”
Dean was still moaning when sharp teeth sank into his neck, laying Castiel’s claim. Part of him wanted to protest, but most of his mind was overwhelmed by the instinct to submit to his new mate. And with the knot filling his mouth he was effectively gagged anyway.
Dean’s face burned with embarrassment as he could only wait out the man’s knot. Even still, he felt the desire in him grow again, just from knowing how many alphas were waiting to use him.
Castiel shook his head. “I won’t ever let you suffer through a heat alone ever again,” he promised. Then he moved and lay Dean down on his stomach on the couch and started to undo his fly.
Dean slowly woke to the feeling of soft kisses on his neck. The strong arms of his Alpha were wrapped around his waist, and he smiled as he leaned back into his chest. He was a little sore from the previous night’s activities, but less so than the previous morning. Castiel had been right, his body was adapting.
Castiel nodded, appearing grave. “Yes, I will baby. But it will have to wait until we get home, I won’t let your disobedience ruin our dinner.”
Castiel smiled and a pleased growl rumbled in his throat. “Good boy.”
“Oh! Um, good morning Castiel. Uh, I mean Alpha?” Dean hesitated, not sure what his new mate preferred.
“Yes, Alpha!” Dean gasped out. “I’m your bitch. Your fuckhole.”
Finally, Castiel brought the collar to Dean’s neck and buckled it in place with a small lock. “This collar doesn’t just mean that I own you,” Castiel said seriously. “It means that you’re my responsibility and mine to protect,” he said. “As long as you wear it, I will make sure you’re taken care of. Do you understand?”
“Oh please, Alpha! Please use me, please let me show you how good I am!” Dean begged, eager to prove himself to his Alpha.
Lord help him, he really wanted it.
Dean whimpered, leaning into the Alpha’s touch, wanting more.
He screwed his eyes shut, the mix of humiliation and relief was overwhelming. His bladder had been so full that it seemed to take forever to empty, but his stream finally trickled to a stop and he lowered his leg, carefully avoiding the wet spot in the grass.
He’d been dodging his brother for months now, using every excuse he could think of to avoid introducing his brother to his alpha. Because as happy as he was, he didn’t want his little brother to see the kind of omega he’d become.
Dean quivered. Of course the Alpha could smell that. Dean could smell that the Alpha wasn’t mated either, and he whimpered as a little slick leaked from his apparently willing hole. “Got kicked out,” he managed, not sure why he was telling this Alpha the truth. His instincts were demanding he obey the handsome Alpha standing over him.
Without warning, Castiel gripped Dean’s hips and slammed in, fucking him hard and fast. The omega was incredibly slick and ready.
Castiel seemed to be picking up on his discomfort, he kept eying Dean throughout the meal.
After what felt like a wonderful eternity, Castiel’s knot finally started to swell, and Dean felt himself getting closer. It only took a few more sharp thrusts before he was coming with a loud cry, pleasure racing through him in waves.
knot him.
Castiel let out a pleased groan, then pulled the chair back to the desk and went back to work.
“I told you, Dean, your new Alpha wanted you for your first heat,” John said, glancing over at him. “I told you, Castiel already paid for you, remember?”
Castiel sighed as he finished the meal. “You are so vocal, I can see you can’t help it.” He wrapped an arm around Dean and stood again, carrying Dean over to the closet. He opened the door and reached up on a shelf, pulling out a cock shaped gag. He pushed the cock gag into Dean’s mouth and deftly buckled it with his free hand.
Castiel smiled and kissed Dean’s cheek. “Good boy.” He reached down to tease Dean’s rapidly hardening cock. “You like that, don’t you? You like calling me Daddy.”
It took all three books by the time Castiel’s knot went down, and Dean reluctantly let his daddy’s cock slip from his mouth. He whined a little and pressed his face to his daddy’s hip, feeling sleepy from his tummy full of milk.
“Good morning, Brother,” Benny said with a grin for Castiel and a wink for Dean. “‘Morning Sweetheart, how’s our good little bitch this morning?”
Castiel felt much better by the time fourth period started, and by the end of the day he’d almost been able to get the thoughts of Dean out of his mind. He had one more duty for the day, he’d volunteered to cover detention. It was in another room, so he crossed the school and let himself into what was the history room during the day. He’d been told he only had one kid, so it shouldn’t be too hard.
Which was when Dean discovered there was a ring gag underneath it. Even with the cock gag free he could still only pant and whimper, mouth forced to remain open. But at least he could breathe better.
“Yes, Alpha,” Dean said eagerly.
Dean whimpered into the kiss, looking up at Castiel as he pulled away. “Good morning, Alpha,” he said softly.
Behind him Castiel let out a content sigh and rolled them both over on their sides, spooning Dean as they waited out his knot. “You’re amazing,” he murmured, pressing a gentle kiss to the tender bite mark on the back of Dean’s neck. “I couldn’t ask for a more perfect bitch.” His arms wrapped around Dean’s waist, holding him firmly.
When Balthazar finally spilled down Dean’s throat he was already eager for the next knot, even as the cock in his mouth continued to fill his belly. It was already so full it was swollen and tight, but he wanted more, wanted to prove he could take as much as his alphas wanted to give him.
Dean was in a pleased haze by the time he finally pulled off his alpha’s relaxing knot. He licked his lips and smiled as he was passed off to Heather, one of the household omegas, who took him by the hand and lead him from the room.
“That’s it,” Castiel murmured, hips snapping harder as he started to drive with ernest. “You want to be mated and bred up, don’t you little omega?”
Dean let out a muffled yelp of surprise as he felt the table drop out from under him, and his eyes flew open. He realized that Castiel was just lowering the height of the table so that he and Benny could sit while they waited out their knots, and he relaxed again, closing his eyes and focusing on swallowing.
Dean groaned as he felt the knot start to fill him. “Yes, Alpha!” he gasped, trying to push back to meet the alpha’s cock. “Wanna be full, please!”
“Come,” Castiel said, putting an arm around Dean. “I want you on your leash tonight, so that I can keep you close.”
After dismounting the bikes, Castiel removed his helmet before he helped Dean free of his own, and the Alphas put the three helmets in secure lockers provided for that very purpose. Before heading into the bar, Castiel reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a thick silver chain with a black leather loop on one end. Dean realized it was a leash when the Alpha clipped it to his collar, and this time when he blushed it was half embarrassment and half arousal.
Eight months later Dean was very settled into his new life. Although being heavily pregnant was still new, but Castiel had insisted he get used to that as well, because he’d promised Dean
“Hold still, pup,” Benny chastised. He pulled the cock gag free and put it on the kitchen counter.
Dean’s hand went to to the back of neck, and he could feel the mark Castiel had left there, just above the edge of his new collar. It was still healing but it didn’t hurt. If anything the reminder of his new ownership made Dean’s cock twitch.
“That I did, Brother, thank you,” Benny replied. “You picked a real good bitch there, we’re going to have a lot of fun with him.”
“He’s all yours.”
“You’ve been a bad boy,” Castiel growled, voice heavy with lust. “Clearly you need an alpha to keep you in line, don’t you little omega? So I’m going to teach you a lesson.”
“The boys sure do love him,” Benny’s deep voice rumbled, as he stepped up behind Cas. He wrapped an arm around Castiel’s waist and dropped a chin on his shoulder. Even from across the yard they could see Tank’s red cock was full and partially free of his sheath as he scented the boy. “They really like him,” he said with a chuckle.
“Nice to meet you, Dean,” Benny said, fingertips playing idly with one of Dean’s nipples. “I’m glad to have you in our little pack.”
Again they found Benny working on breakfast, and their new pack mates sitting at the table. Castiel smiled and nodded, pulling Dean along to sit on his lap at the breakfast table.
“Are you always this much of a slut?” Castiel growled, hands coming up to drag down Dean’s body. “Offering yourself up just to get out of a damn ticket?”
Dean shivered, his whole body responding to his alpha’s command. He was suckling the cock shaped nipple before he even realized what he was doing. He let out a little humiliated whimper, face hot and eyes low. But he didn’t stop drinking, he suckled the nipple and drank down his dinner.
believe it,” Sam said, speaking to Castiel. “Never in my
The next thing Dean knew a heavy body slammed into his back, sending him sprawling to the forest floor. With a cry Dean scrambled, trying to get to his feet, he was frozen by the sound of a deep growl. Trembling on his hands and knees, Dean slowly peered over his shoulder, and he paled when he saw the massive black wolf standing behind him.
Dean was slightly relieved at that idea. He wanted his pups to be certain who their father was.
Benny smiled. “You’re such a good little bitch, Sweetheart. You get so absorbed in serving your alphas that you forget your own release.” The alpha’s strong hand moved to wrap around Dean’s straining little cock, and he slowly started to stroke it.
Dean felt so used, but yet he kind of loved it. His cock was fully hard now, and slick was leaking from his hole and down his leg. He moaned around the thick cock that was starting to swell in his mouth. The knot grew larger and larger as Castiel fucked Dean’s face, and suddenly he really wished it was filling his channel instead. His hole ached with need to be filled, all soreness from the previous night forgotten.
Castiel’s hands reached out of it’s own accord, he could no longer stop himself from touching. One hand rested on Dean’s hip, while the other reached out to run a teasing fingertip over the small cock, watching the way it twitched.
Exhaustion from the day was steadily catching up to Dean, and he finally caved, crawling over to his bed. He curled up on the soft pillow, and he was quickly asleep.
Dean sighed and pressed his face into Benny’s strong chest, happy to let the alpha carry him upstairs. Benny may not be his mate, but his scent was quickly becoming familiar to Dean, and it soothed him.
Heather blushed, knowing Dean had caught her being knotted by Castiel’s good friend Benny several times, she was definitely his favorite omega in the house. “Why buy the milk when you can get it for free…” she mumbled, but didn’t seem entirely opposed to the idea.
“Of course.” Balthazar smiled. “I thought you might prefer that, you have a stunning bitch, I don’t blame you for being protective.”
“Didn’t mean to startle you, sweetie,” he said, parking the cart by the wall. “Don’t worry, I’m going and your Alphas are just in the other room.” He then slipped out again.
Dean could only whimper as he was fucked hard, his body going limp in Castiel’s strong arms, his legs shaking with the intense pleasure of being taken by his mate. Then he was suddenly being dropped down on the table top, and it was all he could do to just hang on to the edge as the alpha’s cock continued to drive into him. Each sharp snap of Castiel’s hips sent wave after wave of intense pleasure through Dean, perfectly in time with the slap of heavy balls against his skin.
Dean let out a long moan and pressed his face into the bed. It was going to be a long day.
Dean purred and leaned into the touch, eagerly leaning towards Castiel. With Castiel still standing, Dean easily nuzzled against Castiel’s hip, then trailed toward his cock.
“Daddy…” Dean moaned, feeling his body stretch to take the alpha’s growing knot. He was already so full of his daddy’s milk, Dean had kept the alpha’s cock warm all night keeping it all safe inside.
Dean parted his lips eagerly, and Balthazar thrust his cock down his throat, holding his face still as he fucked his mouth. Gadreel lined his own cock up and shoved it deep into Dean’s ass until his heavy balls smacked against Dean, then pulled back out and slammed back in, immediately jumping to a fast pace. All conscious thought left Dean’s mind as he sunk into the overwhelming mix of pleasure and pain of being so simply used. He loved it, and he was desperately moaning around the cock in his mouth, wanting more, harder, faster.
Castiel’s eyebrows raised at the comment, but he tried to disguise his interest with a nod, taking the schedule and thanking the woman. Fortunately she left without taking note of Castiel’s reaction.
“Dean?!”
He was wearing Castiel’s favorite outfit. A very sheer pink robe was draped around him, trimmed with pink fur. All he wore underneath was a pair of thigh high pink stockings, and a pair of pink satin and lace panties, which of course were completely open in the back, with a pink bow framing his perfect ass.
Dean sulked and sat on the bed, letting his little brother play guard dog.
Castiel grinned at Dean. “Always. Do you know how to be a passenger on a bike?” He picked up one of the helmets and pulled it down over Dean’s head, leaving the visor up.
Dean’s moans grew louder, responding both to Benny’s words and his big cock. He didn’t think he’d be able to come again after the last time Castiel fucked him, but his little cock was already hard and leaking, ready for another round. Dean didn’t have the same mating connection to this Alpha that he had with Cas, but it seemed his body was very happy to get bent over and fucked by any Alpha with a big cock. If his Alpha ordered it.
“Of course,” Castiel said, tugging Dean up to his feet. “But just once, then I want him to rest until tonight.”
Castiel’s reply was laced with pride. “He was completely untrained when I claimed him, he’s just a natural.” His hands were still groping Dean’s ass.
Under the table Dean moaned around Benny’s thick cock, now pushing down the back of the omega’s throat as the knot was already starting to swell. Castiel had never called him a cock sleeve before, but it only made Dean’s need burn brighter.
“Hello, gentlemen,” Castiel said, his voice shifting into a deeper and more controlling growl. The sound of a pack Alpha declaring his dominance. “Benny, I think you remember Balthazar and Gadreel.”
The rest of the afternoon and early evening passed into a blur of sleep and sex. Castiel was insatiable, as if he were only happy when he was knotted in his omega. If Dean’s mind weren’t so clouded with lust, he’d be shocked at how he was downright desperate every time his Alpha rolled him over and fucked him again. Dean was starting to think he really was meant to be a bitch.
One of these alphas was a highly compatible mate!
It was how Castiel ensured nobody would be tempted to touch Dean. Why risk your life for one omega when the house was full of omegas free for the taking?
“They’re pretty simple,” Castiel said. “Touching is free range, but pack Alphas must ask to use his holes. But rest assured I’m quite generous with sharing, I prefer my bitch to be well used. As for how you use him, just don’t make him bleed, other than that you can do whatever you want with him. Tie him up, fuck him rough, remind him he’s a good little whore; he loves it. Just make sure you take good care of him when you’re done, and if it’s late, return him to my bed.”
“Come,” Castiel ordered, leading Dean out of the living room by his leash. “I need to get dressed before our guests arrive, we don’t have much time.”
Castiel finally released the bite on the back of Dean’s neck, kissing the mark he’d left. “Now you’re truly mine, marked, bought and paid for,” he said with a pleased chuckle. “I just need to get you a proper collar so that nobody will ever doubt who you belong to.”
“Come on,” Castiel growled, taking Dean by the arm and half dragging him around to the back of the car. “Put your hands on the trunk.”
A sweet, rich milk poured into Dean’s mouth, and he was forced to swallow it. It actually tasted pretty good, like a vanilla protein shake. But he continued his protest, refusing to suckle. Only to again have milk flood his mouth, and again he had to swallow.
Castiel smiled. “Somewhere around the topic of having my way with you.”
Dean whimpered as he felt the knot continuing to fill him,
His three huge studs came trotting after him, and he watched them fondly as they ran out to the back lawn. One was a doberman named Chief, tall and muscular. One was a german shepherd named Atlas. He’d imported straight from Germany, and he was built like a wolf and weighed just around 100 pounds. The third was his Cane Corso. A variety of mastiff and particularly large for his breed, Tank weighed in over 150 pounds. He was black with natural, uncropped ears, and Cas thought he looked particularly handsome.
Benny fucked and knotted Dean four times before he finally seemed satisfied. Dean was so exhausted and limp with pleasure, the Alpha had to carry him back to Castiel’s room. Dean was half asleep when Benny pulled back the blankets and laid him down next to his Alpha, but he still instinctually moved to cuddle into Castiel’s chest.
“Good boy,” Benny praised, wrapping an arm around Dean’s chest and pulling him up in his arms. He moved back to his seat at the table and sat down, letting the omega sit impaled on his knot.
Dean looked hopefully up at his daddy again. “Daddy, milk?” he asked again, looking down at Castiel’s hard cock.
When Dean walked past Castiel on the way to his seat, he barely came up to the alpha’s chest, and Castiel’s dick fucking
Castiel finally stopped the spanking, and suddenly his finger was pressing into Dean’s wet hole. “You’re ready for me, you’re still relaxed and open after your heat, you must have fucked yourself with something.”
By the time Dean made it around to Castiel’s legs again, his belly was getting quite full and he wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but Castiel had said all of the Alphas must come in his mouth, so he eagerly pulled out his Alpha’s cock and sucked it down. He was very happy to make his Alpha come for the second time that morning, regardless of his own needy predicament.
“That will help you keep control tonight,” Castiel said, stroking the band of silver at the base of Dean’s cock. “I don’t want to deal with too much mess while we’re out, if you’re a good little slut I’ll let you come when we get home.”
Castiel pulled Dean up onto his lap with a pleased smile. “You’ve been a very good fuck toy so far. Are you hungry?” he asked, putting a hand on Dean’s stomach.
Dean’s stomach did a happy little flip, and for the first time in his life he was excited by the promise of a collar around his neck. “Yes, Alpha,” he agreed, feeling quite content.
Dean’s face burned with mortification as he realized he really wasn’t going to have a choice. He looked back and forth between Cas and Benny, eyes pleading.
“Ok, breakfast is served boys,” Benny said, dishing out four plates of food, making sure to put extra on Castiel’s plate for Dean. “Give me a hand here?” He gestured to Gadreel, who nodded and moved to help Benny serve up the meal.
Balthazar let out a groan of pleasure. “God, he feels just as good as I thought he would.” His hands fisted Dean’s hair in a tight grip. “You like that cock in your throat, little slut?” he teased.
Castiel sighed and nodded. “Yeah, I know. I’m actually thinking about visiting an omega mating service today. They’re expensive, but if I can find one that’s particularly beautiful it would be a good investment.”
He just continued to moan and squirm.
“Yours,” Dean gasped, arching his back. “Yours, Alpha.”
There was the sound of chairs being pulled up for the two new Alphas and drinks were set out on the table around Dean.
Dean just glared and refused to answer. He wasn’t going to play this domestic game.
Dean’s orgasm immediately crashed over him, his body responding to the order without thought. He moaned and whined as he was fucked through his release, until finally the Alpha slammed into him and stilled, collapsing onto Dean’s back as he came with a groan. Dean let out a soft whimper as he felt the Alpha’s cock pulse and pump him full of a second round of seed.
pups.
“Now, your first rule,” Castiel said, turning to Dean with hungry eyes. “You’re not allowed to wear any clothes while you’re inside our home.” Castiel started to eagerly tug at the omega’s clothes.
“Thank you,” Castiel said with a smile, pulling Dean to his feet and gently pushing him towards the new Alphas. “And make sure you take off his cock ring and give him permission to come, he earned it tonight.”
Dean gaped at his brother, shocked that he wasn’t just okay with this, he was downright
All Dean wanted to do was walk around scenting each of the alphas until he could figure out which of them smelled so damn good. There were five men and three women, so Dean figured he could narrow it down to the men, as he wasn’t usually attracted to women.
He didn’t hear anything until Castiel lean down and spoke into his ear. “Come for me, baby.”
Dean closed his eyes and leaned into the Alpha’s touch. He wanted that, to be protected and provided for. To have an Alpha as rich and handsome as this one, could he really ask for anything more? And this man seemed to be letting him choose, if he stayed on the streets he was eventually just going to be taken by someone, he knew that.
Dean hummed and smiled as his Alpha gently cleaned him. His eyes went wide with surprise when Castiel gently tugged the plug free, dropping it to the shower floor. Dean blushed as he felt the trapped Alpha seed gush from his hole, running down his legs before it was rinsed down the drain.
AN: This is going to end the chapter story, but I will revisit the story eventually to do timestamps in the future. I’m sorry I left the last three alphas hanging, but I decided they would be OCs and didn't need introduction, so its not meant to be a cliffhanger. We will meet them someday in a timestamp. Any additional timestamps will be added as additional chapters.
“Daddy,” Dean whined, frowning at Castiel. “Daddy, diapie wet,” he said, reaching out for the alpha.
Benny nodded. “Of course, boss. Any restrictions on his use today?”
Dean wasn’t sure how long he’d been asleep when he woke up later that afternoon. He stretched in the huge bed, letting out a content smile. He rather liked this routine, getting his second sleep midday when most of the Alphas were away. It gave him plenty of energy to be used by them late into the night.
“Anyway, I’ll get Kev over here with drinks for you both, I know you have business to get to.” Dean heard him clap Castiel on the shoulder and then walk away, then he heard the sound of two other sets of feet pushing in closer.
Dean’s heart soared. “I love you too, Alpha.”
“Very good,” Castiel praised, bending in to give Dean a firm kiss. “From now on when I ask you to introduce yourself to an Alpha, that’s what I want you to say, understand?”
The alpha’s eyes darkened. “I expect you to answer me when you’re spoken to,” he said, threatening.
Castiel shook his head, leading Dean to the hall closet where his leash hung up next to his club clothes. “I want you just like this, looking like the well used fuckhole you are,” he said, clipping the leash to Dean’s collar. “And reeking of sex,” he added with a grin.
Benny eagerly stood and grabbed at Dean, leaving his breakfast forgotten. He turned Dean around and bent him over the kitchen counter, pulling the plug out with one hand while the other freed his hard cock. He quickly lined up to Dean’s entrance and slammed inside with no further warning.
But Castiel was back again, only this time as he dragged Dean back to all fours he laid several sharp smacks to Dean’s ass, making him yelp. “Bad puppy!” he scolded, again tugging backward on Dean’s collar. “Sit!”
Dean woke the next morning to the feeling of his Alpha’s strong arms wrapping around him and a hard cock pressing against his backside. Without thinking about it, Dean pressed his ass back against his Alpha’s cock with a sleepy moan, eager to please his mate and ready to be used. He gasped when he suddenly felt the plug being tugged free of his ass, and then Castiel’s thick cock was pushing into Dean’s hole, still slick from the previous night’s many knottings. Dean just moaned and pressed his ass back to meet his Alpha’s thrusts.
Dean’s ass dropped to his ankles instantly, paws between his knees in a perfect ‘sit.’ His ass still burned, and he didn’t think for a moment about disobeying his alpha.
“Hey baby doll.” Castiel reached out to run a hand through Dean’s hair. “Missed you.”
Dean was momentarily distracted when Benny’s knot pushed into his mouth and locked in behind his teeth. Dean thanked whatever evolutionary trick let him breath with the thick cock in his throat, and when Benny came with a grunt he started to eagerly swallow down the Alpha’s seed.
Dean could already feel the knot swelling inside him as Castiel fucked him harder, and he pushed back against it, desperate to be filled by it.
Castiel walked into the house from the garage, trying to shake off the stress of the day as he stripped off his sport jacket and tossed it over a chair in the entry way. It was far too expensive to leave laying around like that, but he knew one of the household omegas would pick it up and put it away.
Suddenly as Castiel was watching, Dean bent over to wring his sponge out in a bucket of soapy water and the shorts rode up even further, letting pink lace panties peak out from under the fray of his shorts. It was the hottest fucking thing Castiel had ever seen.
“Okay, let’s find Benny, it’s time to go out.” Castiel smiled and took Dean’s hand, leading him out of the bedroom.
“Come on puppy,” Castiel cajoled, gently stroking Dean’s face. His voice got deeper, suddenly carrying the full weight of his alpha command. “Suck.”
Dean blushed and shook his head. He was actually pretty full after four rounds of Alpha knots.
Dean bit his lip and nervously tugged that the tall white collar that protected his neck from a claiming bite. “You said you’re a reproductive health doctor, right?” he asked.
The scent of lust was rolling off Castiel in waves, and the Alpha’s pupils were blown wide as his eyes raked over Dean’s naked body. “You’re more beautiful than I hoped, you’re going to make a perfect bitch.”
Dean moaned and squirmed as Castiel’s knot swelled to fill him again, desperate to cum and unable to.
Dean tried to glower as he was led into the strange alphas home. It was quite big, fancy even. But Dean told himself he shouldn’t be impressed, he should be focusing on getting away before the alpha mated him.
Dean started to drift off to sleep, slipping into dreams full of rough sex and huge Alpha cocks. The last thing he heard before sleep claimed him was his Alpha’s voice.
Castiel just chuckled. “Everything is for sale, you just have to name the right price.” He looked the boy up and down for a moment. “How does $20,000 sound?”
Dean couldn’t control himself anymore, the moment he had permission he started to fuck himself hard, slamming up and down on his alpha’s cock. “Please may I come, Alpha, please!” he begged.
“I got you baby,” Castiel said, groaning as he wrapped his arms around Dean and slammed in harder, driving into his omega until his knot finally started to swell.
Castiel raised an eyebrow at the change of topic, but didn’t question it. “It’s a lot of work, strange hours…”
Dean was now wearing what Castiel jokingly called his “party outfit.” Which included a thick plug with a cut glass gem on the end, and a matching gold collar and leash, and nothing else. Dean was still so full, belly a little swollen with seed, and a few trickles had escaped to run down the inside of his legs. He looked completely debauched.
Dean bit back the whimper this time and took a deep breath before speaking. “I’m Castiel’s bitch, I am an obedient and eager fuckhole,” he said, a little more clearly this time. He was confused by the mixture of humiliation and arousal he felt when he spoke the words.
“Oh, Daddy!” Dean cried, breathing harder as Castiel covered him with his strong body and started to move inside him. It was slow at first, then harder and faster, until Dean was panting and moaning with each sharp thrust of the alpha’s huge cock slamming into him. “Daddy! Daddy!” He cried out, clenching the sheets in his hands to stop himself from coming as he was filled up again by the huge knot.
moping in the kitchen while Benny fixed breakfast. Castiel’s only junior Alpha happened to be a professional chef, a fact that made their pathetic two Alpha pack a little brighter.
“One more thing,” Castiel said, pulling out a small plastic box from his pocket. “Open your mouth and put out your tongue.”
“I’m so good,” Dean gasped out with a moan. “I’m a good bitch, obedient a-and eager for you, Alpha.” He whimpered as Castiel teased the head of his cock with his thumb. “Please, Alpha, please! I promise not to come without permission! I’ll be such a good fuckhole for you, I promise, please just let me come!”
Castiel nodded, moving to sit down on the bed next to Dean and reaching out to run a hand through Dean’s hair. “That’s to be expected after your first night, your body will get stronger and soon you won’t get sore anymore.” He smiled. “In the mean time, I drew you a hot bath to soak your muscles and get you cleaned up.”
“Since you’re a doctor, could you just take a look and tell me if I’m normal, for a castrated omega?” Dean asked, not making eye contact with Castiel. “I’m just so… small.” His cheeks were a beautiful pink again.
Castiel internally groaned, and moved to sit at the desk. “I’m sure you know the rules, sit quietly and do your homework,” he said, hoping he’d survive the hour alone with the beautiful boy.
The only trouble was who? Dean tried to hide his nerves as he set up his poster boards, doing his best not to make it obvious as he scanned the room. The man with the blue eyes was staring intently, but so were several others. He knew he was an attractive omega, it wasn’t an uncommon reaction.
Dean knew he should have seen this coming. His father had never been happy to have an omega for a son, so of course he kicked him out of the house the moment he turned 18. Dean wasn’t sure what to do or where to go. If he went to an omega shelter he’d just be put up for sale to the highest bidder, and Dean didn’t want that. He wanted a say in what happened to him.
Benny gripped Dean’s hips firmly–the omega’s toes couldn’t touch the ground when he was on the tall Alpha’s cock–and pulled Dean off the counter.
Dean forced himself to turn his attention to his presentation, not knowing what else to do. He jumped right in, giving the executives the briefing they’d asked for. A market analysis for a new product, even as he was reciting it he could barely remember what he was doing.
The truth was, Castiel had always been rather obsessed with castrated omegas, especially ones who were altered at a young age. They were just so wonderfully petite and effeminate, the lack of testosterone making their body small and delicate. They were usually so much more submissive and obedient, and often much more desperate for a knot, as their little cock alone couldn’t make them come. It was Castiel’s dream to mate one.
Dean could feel the alpha’s knot already starting to swell, and the growing cock filled him more and more. Each pass sent lightning bolts of pleasure through him, making him moan and squirm.
Dean’s face burned and his well used hole twitched and clenched down around the Alpha’s knot. “Yes, Alpha,” he gasped out. He was confused by how much the prospect of punishment excited him. He didn’t exactly want to be spanked, but he couldn’t help but respond to being so firmly under his Alpha’s control.
Dean did as he was told and submitted to his Alpha, and suddenly he realized he could breath. He took a long inhale through his nose, and when he relaxed he realized he enjoyed the feeling of the cock filling his throat.
Castiel groaned as his cock grew hard, responding to the needy omega whimpering and mouthing him through his slacks. Dean was always like this, and Castiel fucking loved it.
“No problem,” Gadreel said, reaching out to grab Dean’s naked body with eager hands. “We’ll make him come a few times.”
“Good boy,” Castiel praised, kissing the mark on Dean’s neck. “Now, you’ve been a very good bitch for me, Dean. But we do need to talk about punishments. You need to know what to expect if you break one of my rules. Do you understand why punishments are necessary?”
Castiel just smiled, then spun Dean in his arms and pressed his chest up against the warm shower wall.
“Yes, Alpha,” Dean agreed automatically. He was starting to realize it was true, he was all of those things. Slut, bitch, fuckhole; he didn’t care, he just wanted to be knotted again. “I am a slutty little fuckhole.”
Castiel’s eyebrows rose. “Yes, of course they can Dean.”
Castiel only growled as he fucked Dean harder, strong hands gripping the omega’s hips,  skin slapping against Dean’s ass with each stroke.
“Welcome to the Novak Inn,” The man said with a smile. “My name is Castiel, can I get you both a room for the night?”
“Wake up, puppy…”
As a young mafia don at only twenty-eight, Castiel had wanted a mate who could be a walking status symbol of his wealth. He hadn’t expected to actually love the boy, but he truly did, and he could never help spoiling him.
Dean’s cock twitched and his ass tried to leak around the plug, but he just nodded and moved his pillow in between Benny’s knees. Without a word he pulled the Alpha’s cock out of his pants and swallowed it down, sucking eagerly.
Dean did his best to appear calm as he stood outside of the conference room, watching the executives through the floor to ceiling glass walls that separated them. They were in the middle of a meeting, and any moment now they would call him in to give his presentation.
“God, look at him go for it!”
Dean glowered at them, trying to ignore the part of him that did indeed want to absently suckle on the gag.
Dean came hard as his mate’s knot stretched and filled him, slumping into the tile wall and gasping for air as he came down.
Dean nodded, knowing it must be more difficult for the other omegas. They belonged to Castiel too, there to get the household work done and please the alpha members of the household staff, or any other alpha who stopped by. And there were quite a few.
With a content sigh, Castiel gathered Dean in his arms and moved them so that he could sit back down in his chair, with Dean on his lap and impaled on his knot, his back against the Alpha’s chest this time. Dean was breathing hard and biting back little whimpers of frustration, his whole body vibrating with the need to come. But he didn’t ask, didn’t beg, just sat quietly on his Alpha’s cock, just like he was supposed to.
touch,” Castiel was saying, speaking to the other alphas. “He is decoration only for the rest of the night.”
“Just my fingers,” Dean admitted, letting out a little moan as the alpha pushed three fingers into his hole, checking his readiness. “A lot…”
Dean just pressed down on Benny’s hardening cock and moaned.
Dean was giddy with excitement as Castiel expertly guided the bike through his neighborhood. His bare legs were a little cold, but he found that the idea of people seeing him dressed as he was made his heart race with excitement. Just when he thought he couldn’t be more attracted to his Alpha, he found a new level to it. He found himself wishing it were possible for Castiel to ride the motorcycle and fuck him at the same time. He blushed at his own ridiculous thoughts.
Dean just never thought he’d become one of them.
Dean’s eyes grew wide for a moment and then he covered his face in mortification. “I disobeyed you, Alpha, I was a bad fuck toy. I’m so sorry.”
His Daddy.
Castiel’s teeth still gripped Dean’s neck as he slowly pulled out and then firmly thrust back into Dean, strong arms wrapping around the omega’s waist and holding him tight as the Alpha started to fuck into him harder, claiming Dean’s body as his own. Dean cried out at the shocking mix of blinding pleasure and sharp pain, but he had sunk too far into submission to care. All he knew now was the Alpha above him, he belonged to this man and he would do anything, take anything, if that would please him. After a few more hard thrusts the pain started to fade and Dean could only moan as pleasure overwhelmed him.
Dean cried out at the order, coming on command without thought. “Thank you, Alpha!” He moaned.
Dean was half asleep when he was suddenly grabbed and manhandled back into position, the Alphas easily spinning him around to trade ends. He whined, arching his back and opening his mouth eagerly, ready to be knotted again. This time it was Balthazar who removed the plug and thrust his cock deep into Dean’s ass, while Gadreel fucked his mouth.
“Okay buddy, breakfast!” Castiel said, coming into the room and lifting Dean out of the play pen. “You’re going to need a change soon,” he said, patting Dean’s diapered bottom.
“Yes, Daddy,” Dean said, not making eye contact with anyone as he slipped out of his chair and under the table.
“Such a good omega,” Castiel praised, running his hands up and down Dean’s bare chest, one hand settling on Dean’s flat stomach. “I wonder how many knots you can take tonight…”
Finally Castiel let Dean speed up again, and it didn’t take much longer for his knot to swell, and he groaned as he spilled down his omega’s throat. He loved being tied inside his mate, and he relaxed back into the chair to enjoy the steady pleasure of his knot as Dean swallowed every load.
Dean whined, looking up at the alphas, trying to beg them with his eyes. He crawled over to the closed slider door, pawing at the glass, trying to tell them he wanted to go back inside. Wanted to use the toilet like a human.
Dean did as he was told, bending over the couch and spreading his legs. This let his bloated belly hang low, showing it off for his approaching Alpha, who was already pulling out a quickly hardening cock. Even though Dean had been so well used already today his body couldn’t help but respond to his mate. His cock jumped and eager slick was added to the load being held in by the plug.
“Come on, baby,” Castiel said, helping Dean out of the car.
Cas and Benny walked back out of the room, leaving Dean to his own devices.
He told himself it was just easier to obey, that he just didn’t want another spanking.
Dean tried not to stumble as he was lead towards this new Alpha’s bedroom. He was able to get a better look at the decor of the hall this time, it was modern and masculine, and everything looked expensive.
Dean whimpered impatiently as he waited, and out of the corner of his eye he could see Castiel sitting in an arm chair, leaning back to watch. It wasn’t long until he felt the bed shift as the Alphas climbed on. His face was pulled up off the bed and he got up on his hands and knees, finding Balthazar’s hard cock in his face, which meant it was Gadreel he could feel carefully removing his cockring and plug.
The handsome Alpha’s eyebrows shot upwards and his pupils grew wide with lust, making his bright blue eyes almost entirely black. “You are a beautiful little thing, aren’t you? What are you doing out here? All alone and unmated.”
“It’s a private Alpha club, only the most elite Alphas are allowed membership.” Castiel smiled. “The only omegas allowed are mates and bitches.”
“What a good puppy,” Castiel praised, bending down to gently scratch Dean’s scalp. “Good potty!”
“Come on puppy,” Castiel said, petting Dean’s hair fondly before giving him a little encouraging smack on the ass, driving him further out on the lawn. “Be a good boy for us and go potty.”
Dean moaned around Benny’s cock fucking his mouth as Castiel slammed into him from behind. His alpha’s hips slapped against his ass, fucking him hard and rough, claiming Dean as his own for all to see. It only made Dean moan louder, his body responding to his alpha’s domination, always happy to be owned. The alphas around him were all talking, but Dean couldn’t hear them anymore, the rushing in his ears drowning everything out as both knots started to swell.
Dean turned on Sam, jabbing a finger in his chest. “How many times do I have to tell you, I don’t want anything to do with any god damn alphas!”
Castiel gasped at the feeling. “Don’t do that, it’s very distracting. Be a good toy and sit still.”
Sam hurried to follow him out the door, catching up with him just as Dean reached the impala. “Come on, Dean, they’re just trying to impress you. Don’t you think it’s about time you settled down?”
He made a break for it, turning and dashing for the front door. If he could just get out on the street, he might be able to outrun the man, maybe hide in one of the neighbors’ yards until morning.
Benny grinned and squeezed Dean’s ass. “Hopefully we’ll have more Alphas in our little pack very soon,” he said. “Better to keep our little fuckhole well used.”
“Fuck, that’s good,” Benny groaned, strong hands holding Dean’s hips tightly as he slammed into him. “You really are a good bitch.”
“I’ll get him to bed,” Benny said fondly, easily picking Dean up and gathering him in his arms. “Come on Sweetheart, I know you need a nap after that.”
Dean just moaned and nodded around the cock in his mouth, desperate to agree. He was a good bitch, and he would do anything to prove it.
Dean woke slowly the next morning to the sound of the shower running in the attached bathroom. He was immediately aware of his achey muscles and his very tender backside, and he let out a soft groan and rolled over, pulling Castiel’s pillow to his face. The scent of his new Alpha helped him relax, and he started to feel proud of his well used body. He could do this, and he could be good at it.
“I’ll see you later!” Dean called as he was dragged out of sight. Once they were on the second floor he yanked his arm out of Sam’s grip and glared at him. “What was that for?”
Throughout the meal, Dean did his best to be obedient and submissive for his alpha, but he found it a little difficult with his brother sitting there. He wished he could just slip back into his normal, comfortable obedience, but he felt like he needed to try harder. That it wasn’t coming quite naturally.
Dean whimpered and shook his head. “Didn’t ask, too fuzzy.” He didn’t yet understand the way submission and need made his mind so hazy.
The rack held him on his hands and knees, his shoulders and hips strapped down to two well padded beams, letting his swollen belly hang in between. There was soft padding under his knees, his wrists were strapped into place and his legs were secured to a spreader bar. It left him completely on display.
Dean just whined. Benny kept teasing and playing with Dean, toying with his nipples and his cock, until his knot finally slipped free. Benny’s teasing continued for a while, and Dean was so distracted by it that he didn’t realize the Alpha had grown hard again until suddenly he grabbed Dean’s ass and thrust his huge cock back into Dean’s hole. Dean moaned and pushed back against the Alpha’s rough thrusts, accepting the fucking like a good bitch.
have a disobedient puppy,” Castiel said firmly, holding Dean’s collar tightly and laying another smack to his ass. “We will do this as long as it takes to make you into a good boy.”
“Oh you’re going to be used alright,” Castiel murmured. “We have a two hour train ride and you’re going to get what you asked for. Let’s see how many knots you can take in that time.”
“Ok, why don’t you come into the kitchen with me.” Castiel got up, unhooking Dean’s leash and taking it in hand. “Heel,” he ordered.
“Yum!” Dean declared, reaching out and grabbing the food with his bare hands and bringing it to his mouth.
“He’s so desperate, not a care in the world!”
On a whim, Castiel pulled his checkbook out of his breast pocket. “How much to buy the boy?”
Benny chuckled. “I don’t know how you can sound so innocent after bending over for me so eagerly.” One rough hand was roaming curiously over Dean’s body. “What’s your name, little omega?”
There was then a small rustling sound in the woods the the south, and Dean’s head swiveled to search for the source. These woods were certainly not without real wolves, but he reminded himself they didn’t attack people. Taking a breath he continued on his way, following the path that took him a little deeper into the forest.
Dean whimpered and nodded, hiding his face. “Please, Alpha. Don’t want to be empty, need your knot, need your seed.”
Dean whimpered a little as the Alpha’s cock sunk deeper into his extremely sensitive hole, but he quickly adjusted and was able to relax back against the Alpha. His eyes drooped a little, his well used body and less than full night’s sleep were catching up with him.
And it was winning.
Dean nodded into Castiel’s chest, feeling some of his nerves fade. “Yes, Alpha.”
“That’s my junior Alpha, Benny,” Castiel mumbled, half asleep. “He’s gonna wanna fuck you.”
Dean melted into the kiss, staring up from the bed in adoration.
The female beta at reception beamed at them. “Oh Castiel! Is that your new mate? He’s so pretty!”
Dean whimpered as his daddy’s knot locked inside him and he was filled again with Daddy’s seed. It felt so good and Dean always loved making his daddy happy.
And besides, what was better than spending your life giving and receiving pleasure, while being pampered in between?
The Alpha’s strong hands held him there. “Just relax,” Castiel said calmly. “You’re an omega, you can breath with a cock in your throat. Just relax and take it.”
Dean’s face bloomed bright red. Castiel only called it suckling when he wanted to use a little humiliation to dominate him. And he knew Castiel was making him do it in front of Sam to prove a point, to remind Dean who he belonged to.
Castiel was currently
cock. As a doctor, Castiel knew it wasn’t really a good idea for a tiny omega to take an eleven inch cock, if they weren’t built for it they could be seriously injured. The real trouble was that made the fantasy of a castrated omega all the stronger for Castiel, he desperately wanted to have a tiny omega impaled on his massive cock, just the thought made his cock twitch.
Dean nodded, too tired to ask questions. “Yes, Alpha,” he said, turning around and stumbling out of the kitchen and heading upstairs.
“Well if that’s not the prettiest sight I’ve ever seen…”
Why? Why did he volunteer that information? What was
Dean let out a long moan as he was brought down on Castiel’s lap, his alpha’s swollen knot pushing in even deeper as he sat impaled on it. He vaguely realized he’d lost his pants entirely and was naked from the waist down, but his mind was still too fuzzy to care very much.
The alpha gaped for a moment before he was finally able to find his voice.
Dean bit his lip and moaned, trying to wordlessly show his Alpha how ready he was.
“Four Alphas isn’t enough to keep him satisfied,” Gadreel agreed, “he would be happy to spend his whole day on a knot.”
“Hello sir,” the man said to Castiel. “Would you like an omega for the night? Or just for a quick knot?” He shoved the young omega towards him. “My son is freshly presented, you’d be his first, I’d give you a good price for his virginity.”
They got down to the kitchen and found Benny working on breakfast, and he grinned at Castiel and Dean. “Almost ready, how are you feeling this morning, sweetheart?” he asked, looking at Dean.
Dean was suddenly roughly shoved over on his belly by Castiel, who was apparently just as eager as Dean to reclaim his mate after his time with the other Alphas. He gasped as Castiel tugged the plug out of his tender hole and quickly thrust his hard cock into the sloppy mess the other Alphas had made of him. Castiel’s hips snapped hard as he fucked into his mate, making sure Dean knew who he really belonged to. Dean just moaned and pushed back against each sharp thrust.
The Alphas went back to discussing their plans for Alpha recruitment while they waited out Benny’s knot. When it finally relaxed, Benny pulled Dean off and put him on his feet.  This time Dean didn’t need to be told, he dropped to his knees automatically to lick Benny’s cock clean and put it away for him, although his cheeks were still pink.
Once they were home and Dean had been changed again, Castiel got to work on dinner while Dean played quietly in his playpen in the living room. Dean was always a good boy at night, a long day of knots left him happy and relaxed, eager to please his daddy. So he played with his toys until his daddy came to get him for dinner.
Dean was still blushing. “Yeah, um, I was wondering…” He looked up at Castiel and then down at his hands again. “Can castrated omegas still get pregnant?”
“Bath time, baby boy,” Castiel said with a big smile. “I know how much you love taking baths with Daddy.”
Dean completely lost track of how long he’d been on his alpha’s cock when he finally pulled him off with a gentle tug. He could only watch with blurry eyes as Castiel handed his leash to Benny, sitting on the couch next to them.
a nightcap. On the house.”
“Not at home,” Castiel replied, always happy to hear Dean repeat one of his rules. “But you have to wear something when we go out.”
But first Castiel had to unpack his brief case and get ready for the day, so Dean just climbed up onto the couch in the corner of the room and waited patiently. He noticed a toy ball he’d left there the previous day and he smiled and picked it up, rolling it around on the cushion.
Castiel. He’d found out later the alpha’s name was Castiel. And even now, in the early hours of the morning after, he still smelled perfect. The alpha was still asleep in the bed next to Dean, and he somehow looked particularly handsome in sleep.
Dean burned with humiliation as he laid down on the dog bed, the chain on the cock cage forcing him to curl up like an animal.
Dean whined when he felt Balthazar finally slip free, quickly shoving the plug back into place before any seed could escape. He felt so bloated with it all, but at the same time it pleased him because he knew this was what his Alpha wanted.
The wolf easily repeated the process with Dean’s under garments, and then suddenly the omega was bared to the animal. Again he tried to get away, but he yelped when the wolf snarled and nipped his ass. Dean was shocked to feel his body still on instinct, naturally responding with submission. He tried to tell himself it was just a survival instinct, that he didn’t want this beast to hurt him.
“Do you want to see how beautiful your brother looks right now?” Castiel offered. The alpha’s hands ran through Dean’s hair. “Look at me, baby.”
Castiel gave Dean’s red ass a light swat. “Then be a good fuck toy and stop talking, let your Alpha use you as he pleases.”
“That’s right,” Castiel said, sounding quiet serious. “Roll over and present your ass for punishment.”
Dean scrambled to obey, turning over and pressing his face to the bed and getting up on his knees. He arched his back and spread his legs, straining to push his ass up as high as he could, displaying his trembling hole to the Alpha behind him.
Dean pulled back harder, trying to yell around the gag in his mouth as Castiel moved to open the back door.
Dean felt himself slipping back into the heat, until he could no longer remember that he didn’t want the alphas. The pleasure was overwhelming, and it didn’t take long before he was caught on a huge knot, the incredible fullness forcing an orgasm through him.
Benny carried Dean into Castiel’s room, and he pulled back the sheets to lay Dean down. He frowned when he noticed Dean’s hard cock, still straining for attention. “They didn’t let you come?” He asked.
“Oh puppy, you’re awake!” Castiel said, rushing to Dean’s side. He stroked a gentle hand across the omega’s neck. “Shh, it’s okay sweetie, you’re safe. You’re home with your new alphas.”
Dean could only whine and moan as he was fucked hard. With his face buried in his alpha’s scent he felt completely free to give into the deep pleasure of being so roughly used by a complete stranger. And with more waiting for their turn behind him.
By the time Dean had finished eating he was starting to squirm. His diaper was so full, by now he’d also wet it, adding to mess of slick and seed. It squished when he moved, making Dean blush.
Dean pulled the plug out of his ass and dropped it on the floor, knowing one of the other omegas would pick it up for him, before lowering himself onto his alpha’s hard cock. He let out a low moan as he let his weight push him down on it, until he sat fully impaled, a feeling he never grew tired of.
With a snarl Castiel yanked Dean upright and his teeth sank into the omega’s neck just as his knot slammed inside the omega’s channel and tied them together. Dean’s orgasm exploded through him as he was finally claimed, and he let out a long moan as he felt his new mate fill him, the huge knot spasming as it steadily pumped him full.
Days of Dean’s heat passed in a blur of constant sex. He lost track of how many times they knotted him. Sometimes one would leave for a while, returning with food and drink for the three of them.
He watched as Dean stood and and slowly gathered his things, and Castiel stood and headed for the door, ready to leave. “Goodbye Mr. Winchester,” he said, turning to let the omega pass him so he could lock up behind.
Dean blushed and ducked his face, pleased to have made Castiel happy.
Castiel chuckled behind Dean as he climbed into position. “Of course baby, Daddy will always take care of you.”
Benny turned his full attention to Dean. “I want you in the living room, bent over the arm of the couch. Now.” He gave Dean’s bare ass a playful swat, and Dean jumped and hurried out of the room.
“Thank you, Alpha,” Dean murmured, leaning into Castiel’s neck again. The alpha smelled so intoxicating with the scent of arousal rolling off him, and Dean couldn’t help but beg a little. “Want your knot, Alpha, please…”
Dean’s relieved howl was muffled by Balthazar’s knot as he came hard, orgasm riding long as Gadreel fucked into him from behind. Just as his own orgasm started to fade, the two Alphas thrust their knots into place and came with a grunt, one right after the other. Dean slumped into the buzzing pleasure of being knotted from both ends, contentedly sucking on the knot in his mouth as the Alpha’s seed poured down the back of his throat. He moaned softly as he felt Gadreel’s knot twitch as his seed pumped into him, mixing with Castiel’s from earlier and making Dean’s belly start to bloat a bit.
He was only a couple hours into this one, but his mind was already a fuzzy mess, and all he could think about was coming.
Deep down Dean knew it was a bad idea to leave the house on the last day of his heat, but he just felt so cooped up, he needed to get out. He figured it would be safe to take a short walk in the woods behind the village, where he was less likely to run into one of the alphas.
“Fuck toys have Alpha seed for breakfast,” Castiel informed him. “You can start with Benny, each Alpha will come in your mouth before they leave for work.”
Dean cried out in pain and jerked on the alpha’s lap. Then there was another smack, and another, each as painful as the last and coming in quick succession. With every smack of the alpha’s hand, Dean could feel something giving away inside him, the will to fight being drained out of him, until he lay limp on the alpha’s lap, silently crying and submitting to the alpha’s spanking.
Dean’s eyes grew wide as Castiel pulled off his hoodie and then his shirt, dropping them to the floor. He started to blush as Castiel uncovered his pale skin. “No clothes at all?”
“Today you’re going to learn what I expect from my mate,” Castiel said, carrying Dean this way and walking out of the room. “I bought you specifically because your small size makes you an ideal knot warmer.”
“In about a month,” Castiel said, grinning. He put a possessive hand on Dean’s belly, rubbing gently. “I’ll be breeding him again soon after, I want a big family.”
They were at Castiel’s favorite restaurant, a swanky little italian place in the north end of downtown. It was small enough to feel private, while still being large enough to accommodate work events like the one planned tonight. Castiel’s law firm had just promoted a new partner, so all six of the partners where going out to celebrate. With their omegas of course, at least those of them who were mated.
Dean’s eyes grew wide as he realized what that meant.
“Ah ah, puppy,” Benny chided, coming into the room. “You need to show your studs your submission.” He gave Dean a firm smack on the ass. “Get back up, let them scent you.”
Remembering his Alpha’s orders, Dean climbed out of bed. He freshened himself up in the bathroom as quickly as he could before padding out of the bedroom and down the stairs, heading for Castiel’s office. He’d never been in there before, but his mate had pointed it out to him so he’d know where to find him.
“I know.” Dean smiled, thinking of his alpha.
Sam just sighed.
“My mate,” Castiel murmured, sounding deeply pleased. “You’re going to be such a good little omega for me, aren’t you?”
Benny walked into the kitchen, moving to wrap an arm around Castiel’s waist. “I’m so glad we decided to bottle feed the puppy. It will make him so much more sweet and dependent.”
He caught the scent first, and it was delicious. When he looked up he found an incredibly handsome alpha standing next to his car, with dark hair and sharp blue eyes. When he spoke it was deep and rough, and Dean’s stomach flipped.
“Is my little slut getting tired?” Castiel asked with a chuckle. “Lucky for you our stop is coming up soon, I think this is the last knot you’ll have to take.” He looked up at the alpha fucking his mate. “So make sure you finish him off good and hard.”
Dean smiled and cuddled back into his daddy’s arms. He was so happy to be filled and held that he didn’t even mind his hard little cock still straining for release. He’d get to come tomorrow, he wasn’t worried about it.
Castiel led their small group out to the garage, and as they stepped through the door Dean realized he must have been quite distracted by his Alpha when he arrived the day before. He hadn’t noticed how expansive the garage was, it was several car lengths deep and wide. Towards the back was a collection of a dozen motorcycles of varying brands and ages, some contemporary and some classics, but they all looked expensive and pristinely kept. Off to the side was a single bike that sat apart from the rest, handsome but slightly less flashy. When Benny moved to it, Dean realized it must be his.
The funny thing was, Dean couldn’t really remember why he’d never wanted this life in the first place. Because it was wonderful. His alpha’s tight control only made him feel safe and loved.
Thanks to the wonderful appleschloss for encouraging me to get over my writer's block and finish this!
“Anything,” Gadreel agreed eagerly, eyeing Dean with hunger.
He found himself just absently watching them cook, he had nothing better to do, his leash still keeping him in place.
Castiel seemed to take it, and he took a half step back. “You’re very welcome.” He had eyes only for Dean as he added, “I’ll be at the front desk if you need anything.”
Dean absently realized his Alpha was making a display of him when he heard the deep murmur of Alpha voices gathering around him. They sounded impressed with how eagerly Dean accepted such a harsh fucking.
But it could never be, so Castiel put thoughts of the omega aside and focused on his classes. The first two classes went pretty well, his students were well behaved, most of them responding to the presence of a strong alpha with natural obedience.
It was wonderful.
“I’m ready, Brother,” Benny said, following Castiel.
“Damn sweetheart, you’re something else, all trussed up like a proper bitch.” He grinned at Castiel. “Are you sure we can’t just fuck him right now?”
Dean was so conflicted, part of him was humiliated to be spoken about as if he were half dog, half sex toy. But that part was quickly getting pushed aside for the stronger side of himself who was just happy to be a good bitch and serve his Alpha. For the moment he just let himself sink into the pleasure of a big knot in his ass and a delicious meal being fed to him by his mate.
“Ah yes,” Benny said, offering a hand to shake. “Let’s see if I remember correctly. Balthazar is a senior partner at one of those high powered law firms in town and Gadreel is a mover and shaker at city hall. Is that right?”
Dean pushed his little red truck along the floor of the playpen, making little truck noises. He knew Daddy was busy getting ready for work, he’d left him here to play with his toys for a while. He still wore just the diaper and the onesie, his legs were bare but it was warm in the house, so he didn’t mind.
Dean blushed and nodded. “Yes, Daddy.”
Dean pulled the blankets over himself with a deep groan, sinking into the comfortable mattress and the silk sheets. As he fell asleep he was sure he could still feel his Alphas fucking him, and his well used hole twitched eagerly.
When he got back to Castiel’s bedroom he was surprised to see the bed had been made with fresh sheets, and that was when he realized there must be a maid he hadn’t met yet. He tried to ignore the thought of more people seeing him naked as he stumbled into the bathroom and did his best to clean himself up before returning to the bedroom and collapsing onto the bed.
Dean thought about excusing himself, or even asking his alpha to just reveal himself. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to happen, and it was hard to think straight with the blue eyed alpha staring at him so intently. Dean noticed his hands were tightly clenching his knees, his knuckles white with the strain.
“Okay baby, time to give you what you really want,” Castiel’s voice rumbled from behind Dean. “Benny, you can have his mouth again.”
After a minute of heavy breathing Castiel picked up the book again and continued to read, settling in to enjoy his knot. Dean just relaxed further, listening to the sound of his daddy’s deep voice as he nursed his thick cock.
Dean slowly nodded. He wasn’t sure what to expect from meal time, but he wasn’t going to starve himself.
Castiel grinned. “You should be, I was so busy fucking you yesterday I forgot to feed you. Don’t worry, Benny will be up soon and he’ll make us a big breakfast.” He added a little soap to the water before he pushed the washcloth below the water line, gently scrubbing the rest of Dean.
Dean’s eyes grew wide at the suggestion of how many knots he’d be taking that day. It was a little frightening to imagine, but also quite exciting.
“Forgive me,” Castiel said, speaking to his coworkers as he easily picked Dean up by his waist and moved back to his chair. “I did not intend for that to happen.”
Dean whimpered but started to lick his own come off Castiel’s hand without objection. When he was done he carefully leaned forward, knot still buried in his ass, and lapped his come off the breakfast table. His face burned red, but he still wanted to please Castiel, no matter what.
“I need my hands,” Castiel said. “So you’re going to practice hanging for the first time.”
Dean looked a little relieved at that, but still concerned. “Oh. Okay, good.” He gave Castiel a little smile. “All I want is to be a good mate for my future Alpha and carry his pups. I just want to know that I’m normal, that an Alpha won’t reject me.”
The were a couple of unfamiliar faces, including one very handsome man with dark hair and bright blue eyes. He was the only one who had at least glanced up at Dean once or twice, and the piercing gaze had nearly made him drop his poster boards.
Dean eyed the stairs down to the lobby with a longing gaze. “I may have spoken too soon…”
“Come for me, little bitch,” Castiel ordered, thrusting harder as his knot grew and stretched Dean open wide.
He made it out the front door and onto the porch before Castiel caught him easily, taking  his arm in one strong hand and a fist full of hair in the other as he dragged him back inside.
Dean was startled when a strange man in a suit walked into the room, and he sat up and pulled the blanket around him, eying him nervously. He was a beta, and he was pushing what looked like a drink cart. He smiled kindly at Dean.
Dean jumped up and approached the desk, coming around behind it to stand next to Castiel’s chair. He looked nervously at the alpha. “Should I take off my pants?”
Dean did as he was told, his little cock twitching in interest at the rough fucking he knew was coming. For such a level headed Alpha, Benny was always ready to burn off some aggression during sex.
“Yes we certainly are,” Castiel agreed.
Benny looked back at Dean, narrowing his eyes. “Bad pup, heel.” He gave the leash a snap.
Pleasure swelled inside him, and Dean was sure he was going to cum, until his felt his Alpha’s hands deftly clip a cold metal ring around his hard cock and settling it behind his balls.
Dean let out a little whimper, shocked to feel his body respond to the praise, a wave of submissive instincts washing through his body. He tried to fight it, not wanting to give in.
Dean laughed and squirmed under his daddy’s fingers. Slick and seed was already starting to fill his morning diaper, but he was so used to it that he barely noticed the feeling.
“You are,” Castiel replied, biting down on Dean’s shoulder and sucking a mark into the omega’s skin. The Alpha’s hips moved against Dean’s ass, grinding his knot inside Dean as seed continued to fill him.
The next morning was a Saturday, so when Dean and Castiel made their way down to breakfast the other Alphas were relaxing, eating their breakfast without any particular rush. All three of them eyed Dean eagerly, Castiel had chosen to keep Dean with him for a proper sleep the night before, so they were all very ready to use him again.
Dean let out a long sigh and smiled, leaning into his mate. It was definitely worth it.
The man had introduced himself as Castiel on the car ride home. What a weird name that was, too.
Dean could barely remember his life before Daddy. There had been a time when he hadn’t lived like this, when he’d been an adult like Daddy. But Dean was happier this way, so he didn’t care.
“Yes, alpha,” the girl agreed, obediently. She then moved to stand by the door, having no other choice but to watch and wait.
Dean’s hand went to his belly, now even bigger than before. He could feel a faint ache from the fullness, and he suspected he was nearing his max, but he was surprised by how much he enjoyed the feeling.
“Good puppy, all done.” Castiel stood. “Now come on, it’s time for bed.”
Castiel had been working on recruitment for months, but the only Alpha he’d been able to convince to join his fledgling pack was his old friend Benny. And Castiel wasn’t sure if it was because Benny enjoyed living in Castiel’s house with it’s fancy kitchen or if the Alpha just felt sorry for his friend and took pity on him.
“There you go, a knot for my good little boy,” Castiel said, lifting Dean off the desk and bringing him back to cuddle into his chest. He reattached the straps of the harness to his shoulders to hold Dean in place on his chest.
“Good fuck toy,” Castiel praised, continuing to drive into Dean, chasing his own pleasure at the expense of Dean’s. His cock slammed hard and fast into Dean until his knot finally filled and slammed into place, and Castiel groaned as he came, his seed filling Dean’s already full body.
Dean pouted and looked down. “That’s okay, officer. I was just in such a rush to get home, I think my heat is coming on and I just really needed to get home to my toy box, you know?” He put on a show of squirming in his seat, and his body was actually responding to the alpha and starting to produce slick. “I just need a knot so bad, officer. And probably a spanking for being so naughty…”
Castiel’s voice growled in Dean’s ear. “Introduce yourself, little bitch.”
