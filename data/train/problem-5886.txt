Tony collapsed down onto him, and for long moments they just lay there, hearts pounding and breathing ragged. The feel of the arc reactor against his chest was like a lullaby, and Steve felt himself drifting toward sleep, until Tony shifted and lifted his head. Steve blinked open his eyes, and let all of the emotions he felt shine through in his smile. “Hey, handsome.” One hand drifted up, of its own accord, to feel how soft Tony's hair was. Oh, God, he was. He was in love with this man, and there was no going back. Tony made a delightful little happy noise,  and Steve made one back. “Well, I guess
Steve gave him a stern look. “And what exactly is wrong with fantastic sex? Should I be ashamed of being a healthy adult with a sex drive?” He crossed his arms over his chest, but Tony could see the twinkle in his eye. “I thought Americans, in the 21st century, would be more enlightened than that.” Clint attempted to sputter out an explanation or a justification or something, but Steve couldn't keep a straight face, and burst out laughing. “Oh, your
. Of course, then he lurched up again, and lurched back down onto his freshly-reawakened bruises, yelped, and jolted up once more, and all of that hurt plenty. Steve, the bastard, moved with him easily, and chuckled against his cock, which just felt unreasonably good, and Tony's mind was starting to fuzz out a little around the edges.
*A*A*
! “I think the team will figure things out pretty quickly as soon as I kiss you at breakfast.”
Steve regathered his composure. “Yes, please.” He paused to run his hands up Tony's thighs, his stomach and chest, then down his arms. “God, you're so beautiful... Oh, right. Is there, um, anything in particular that you really
Pepper was an awful scary lady when she wanted to be. He outright shivered. “I, ah. Wow, that's a pretty effective threat.” But she was worried about Tony, and that was pretty dang sweet. He decided to keep on with his recent policy of honesty. “Don't worry, though. If I have my way, his heart will never get broken again. Though if he keeps on like this, we're gonna have our photo in the papers before we can make any announcements. Not that I mind, he's just so excited for the big reveal...” He couldn't help a fond sigh, not-quite-regretting Tony's impulsive nature.
Steve pressed his lips to Tony's for a long moment, then pulled away and slid out of bed. “I know I don't have to. I'm still going to. You want jeans or sweats?” He went over to the dresser and started pulling out clothes for both of them.
Tony's answering grin was wide, and his body possibly even more boneless, but he squirmed in pleasure anyway. After a moment, he rallied and wriggled over to the edge of the bed, dragging his jock across Steve's thighs. “Not only did I like it a whole Hell of a lot, but...” Steve heard the click of a lock disengaging, then the hiss of hydraulics. Curious, he flopped over onto his stomach to look. Tony waved an arm. “I have toys.” From under the bed was emerging a thing like a trundle bed, but instead of a mattress, there was a thin foam pad, and laid out on it was an assortment of whips, paddles, canes, handcuffs, and things Steve didn't have names for. He shot a raised eyebrow at Tony, who looked almost embarrassed. “I, ah, actually forgot about this earlier, you were just that distracting. But I'm kinda hoping you want to try out some of these on me sometime.”
Steve woke up as soon as the rising sun hit his face. He slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Tony, pulled on exercise clothes, and headed for the elevator and all the way down to street level. He was too excited to sleep, too excited to even be confined within walls. He needed to
Tony looked up, a little embarrassed, from where he was opening a soup container full of maple syrup. “This was a thing Pepper and I did, most Sundays. I hope that doesn't make it weird.” He couldn't quite meet Steve's eyes.
Bruce sighed. “OK, why don’t you start by sitting down before you fall over? Have you gotten scanned by JARVIS?” He pushed Tony toward a stool.
magic!”
- living room, and downstairs to the team living room, where Clint was bouncing on the big sofa like a five year old, and Nat was plugging a flash drive into the port by the giant view screen.
The next thing he was aware of was the heat of Steve's body all along his torso, and the thud of Steve's heart under his ear. He groaned pleasantly, and shifted slightly, realizing now that they were nearly glued together with his cum. He lifted his head just enough to see Steve's face.
On his fifth day into his new life, Steve worried he would forever be broken. Perhaps not the most fair assessment given the short-timeline but one that felt real enough none the less. If he failed to make the right step in his new life he'd fall straight into that dark abyss of himself and never find his way out. It was constantly there, constantly reminding him of what he had lost and what more he may lose if he messed up. He felt empty and full and heavy with nothing. It was bitter and haunting and he wanted it to stop.
He retched but nothing came out. He felt like his nose was bleeding and his tongue felted coated with the coppery tang, but he could do nothing about it. He was being emptied out as something else, something that slithered like a shadow, filled its place.
It should be Pepper. Why couldn’t it be Pepper?
His fingers, cut and burned from tending to the fire and starting on projects to keep the family warmed, screamed a him and every move he made. He stared at them forlornly and tried to image they were covered in charcoal and paint rather than callouses and bruises.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not in front of Steve, please. I just met him.” Bruce whimpered. “Just let me meet someone in a mildly normal way.”
His heart in his stomach, feeling nauseated, he pushed his jacket off and reached to the hem of his shirt, surprised to find himself freezing. His fingers were shaking. He was shaking. Why was he shaking?
“I have to say, I really appreciate it. All of this.” Steve heaved a heavy sigh. His chest ached. “I still don’t know what to think about all of it.”
“Mine.” The word tasted nearly as good as Steve did.
He scrubbed his face, hating how steady his fingers were, before he looked out the window into endless space. They hadn't been off this spaceship since the start. Tony rarely saw anyone outside of grape juice (he needed better nicknames--after what was possibly a hundred years the grape thing was stale) and he knew his mind; it was not in a good state.
Always because of him.
The ceiling, which was the roof to the whole mansion, was above him. Even the wealthiest of locations had a cold roof; something that always needed repair and could never quite keep the chill out.
All he could do was let out blissed out noises with each punctuating thrust Tony provided.
Steve loved the sound of that and moaned obscenely around Tony’s fingers to show it.
“And you want me to say you can?”
Steve frantically reopened his eyes and let out a sharp, “oh.”
“It’s almost always on me.”
“Very good.” He smiled.
"What is it?"
“Don’t get smart, Bruce."
Not his fault that sounded a lot better than a party. Though he would probably request hot chocolate—he found that one of the best things he’s ever had (much to Tony’s, the drinker of hard drinks, amusement). Melted chocolate and milk and warmth; these were things he did not get to have often back in his time and he would enjoy it despite it not being a very adult drink. Tony can shove his coos and sarcasm down his loud-ass mouth.
“I mean,” Steve fumbled, afraid he had gotten ahead of himself. But he could not help it if Tony was acting on some sort of script he thought he had to do. He wanted to elaborate so that the Fae did not take insult. “You’re not a thing. You’re not something to be owned and used. You’re worth more than that…better treatment and…uhm…”
“Hey, whose to say I’m not looking at him now?”
His breathing started to ease as he blinked, blearily, around his dimly lit room. Everything within it was still and relatively empty. Untouched.
“But I only ate
They did not say anything more till after they had all of Steve’s purchases within the wagon and was nearly to the rock from their earlier meeting point.
“The hell you mean anytime soon?!” Steve picked himself up, trying to turn and glare at his boyfriend.
For now, it was just Tony and Steve and nothing was changing this.
He gave Steve one more kiss and then went back to his room, his face set firm on his phone.
Now Steve laughed, “Touché.”
“She sounded outstanding.”
“She’s worse than you.” Steve tried to move his hips away when Tony made another grab at him. “I am connecting well with Bruce here. We apparently are suffering together.”
“You’re mine.”
And he was perfectly fine with that.
“Knew that would get you. Of course, it’s only fair. He tends to make everyone worry.” He shook his head as he spun the blade around. “Silly, pretty boy.”
But then the tower shuddered and the large windows out to the New York air exploded in, covering the group in glass.
“No, I should’ve shouldered more because I fucking adore you and we were partners and I made you think
He could still feel the engineer’s fingertips brushing over any piece of Steve that was bare to the world and it had felt like a branding.
“Good, good.” Some of the media still tried to get away by playing him in a darker light. Brave of them, and he did not care to censor much, but he would not risk the chance of Steve misunderstanding something because a moron on the television said something.
That was the right reaction.
Was it truly ok?
“You’re delicate.”
“Yes, my lord. They are worried for your bride, they seem to think you might hurt him.”
"Uhm," he cleared his throat, "am I allowed to keep my pants on?"
“Isn’t that sweet.” Tony made another grab, gaining victory in yanking Steve’s hips and thighs back to him. “And Nat, keep the jabs to a minimum. I’m sure you’re eager to see Mean Green in all his glory but I’d like to keep this floor looking like I paid nearly two-hundred-thousand for it.”
“Papa isn’t the boss of you.”
Now Steve did laugh at the sight. “There is no doubt about this, your balcony is for sure bigger than my old place.” Already he could make out drastic differences in the skyline from the window alone. “Let me see.”
“Fuck,” Tony groaned, “oh shit, yes, baby, that’s perfect. Fuck!”
Steve, gasping, stared up at the ceiling, wide-eyed as Tony literally licked him over. “Holy hell…”
She tapped her book, “One time I heard a child accidently slipped the name out and a mirror near by cracked. Just simply cracked for no reason. Though the parents swore the mirror cracked in the shape of a laughing face. Another time a farmer slurred it out when he was drunk and his carrots turned red and his tomatoes purple.”
Pressing an intercom button he called out, “Bruce, check-in.”
“And thank you for letting me fuck you till you cried.” He was elbowed in the stomach, though it did not stop him from laughing. He choked and gasped a little but it was so worth seeing those ears get red.
“Y-Yes.” Steve agreed, panting.
“Well, ta-da.” He motioned, hiding the fact that he was fighting a painful hard-on and desperate need to push Steve against something and bring them to an amazing, painful climax.
“Which is?”
“I’m sure Nat informed you of a possibility of a sect of Hydra being around.” Tony sat at his workstation, his expression dark.
Steve keened, a long whine escaping his throat, as he hit his climax.
His tongue pumped and pushed, demanding for more.
And, well, that thought was a little bit horrifying as everyone knew what Stark could do to people he deemed as enemies.
“Changed?”
Feeling brave and open from seeing another side of Tony, Steve just grabbed the black shirt and pulled him in for a kiss, catching the tongue in his own mouth. Tony, who was caught off guard for a split second, eagerly went back to a make-out session, very pleased at Steve being a little pushy for attention.
Steve pouted and then flipped off the camera, which made Howard, and Tony, laugh. “How about I say fuck you and we see how that goes over?”
"The fact that you're still here kinda convinces me," Tony muttered sheepishly.
Steve cheeks managed to flush anyway, Bucky stifling a small chuckle. The blond huffed slightly, crossing his arms. "Well, if that's your issue, then you can either stay on this floor or in the guesthouse." He stated firm. "If we drink, no one's driving."
In bed, Tony whined softly, burning up under the thin sheets.
Steve went to wash Tony's hair in return, staying quiet for the moment. "Plus I don't wanna see how stupid my face gets when you're pounding into me. It’s weird." He chuckles.
"Have we ever told you why we wound up together?" He asked softly. "How that, even though we are quite different, we work well together?"
"I don't want to wake up covered in dew," he explained.
"Tony? Honey?" Steve called knocking on the door gently. "Can I come in? Please?"
The blond just shrugged in response. "Fine. I'll just stay here and paint. Probably won't know what half the things there would be, anyway." He hummed. "You could find something for
"Fuck yeah," Tony breathed, slipping his hand in to palm at Steve's cock through his boxers, "I want you in me, over the table. Got that?"
Tony chuckled and smoothed Steve's hair back, snuggling down into his chest.
"Don't you give me that look, young man. I know what that look means on you." Steve stated, crossing his arms as he looked at the boy.
Tony grinned and reached back for his pants, pulling a lube packet out of the back pocket. He ripped it open with his teeth, smoothly slicking Steve up before prepping himself, taking his time. With a sigh, he slid down onto Steve, rolling his hips.
"How about we go downstairs and make some breakfast? Let Daddy sleep a little while, okay?"
"Sowwy," he whispered, "I don' mean t'cwy..."
"God, you're amazing," Tony groaned, kissing him back, "I'm gonna hop in the shower and I'll meet you downstairs, 'kay?" He grinned, grabbing a change of clothes before heading to the bathroom.
"Steve? Pete?" Tony called out, shrugging off his coat and hanging it up.
He paused, narrowing his eyes.
When Steve finished, he wrapped an arm around Tony's shoulder, snuggling him close and smooching his cheek sweetly. "Hmmm, I love you, you know that? You're adorable."
"Pretty eager, aren't we?" Steve grinned, trailing kisses down Tony's chest and past his navel slowly.
“Well, compiling any info we can and finding patterns is really all we are going to have to work with for a while.” Tony replied, spearing his eggs with his fork annoyedly “Strange isn’t even in the dimension, so we won’t have any help from that jackass for at least three months. So it’s just whatever mythos we can find of werewolves and our data to guide us until then.”
"If you decide to touch yourself while I work, that's your own choice." He explained softly. "But if you don't decide to slick my fingers, well, I'll end up fucking you with my fingers and it won't feel as pleasant. So really, it’s your choice."
"Sleep it is, then. Goodnight. I love you." He whispered to his husband, hearing Peter grunt beside him. "Love you too, munchkin."
"I---" Tony bit his lip, nervously shifting from foot to foot. "I am distracted, Sir," he continued, "Very, very distracted. I can't help it."
"Has he been this grumpy all week?" Tony echoed.
He turned to his husband gently, pulling him in for a soft, loving kiss.
"We can watches a movie or plays games or we can do some 'speriments--" Peter prattled on excitedly, wiggling in Tony's arms.
." Steve squeaked a bit. "Let’s not talk about love expressions with Peter present. Please. Specifically with the volume of my voice."
It’s been a week together, and a week since the nightmares started to subside. No longer did the broken radiator in his apartment make him more susceptible to the reoccurring flashbacks of his time overseas. Rather, he had his own personal heater now.
Although they didn't have an official wedding, Steve hummed the wedding march as he walked them into the home with a smile. He leaned in to plant a smooth kiss against Tony's lips, their first as an official married couple, and that somehow made the kiss feel so much sweeter. Tony curled his arms around Steve's neck, gently pulling him down to kiss him till he couldn't breathe, pulling back only when his lungs started to burn.
"I think I want to die," he admitted hoarsely, tears prickling his eyes, "I can't-- fuck, Steve, it feels like I'm failing you and Peter and Pepper and everyone every single fucking
Hearing Tony's last statement, Steve peeked out of the hoodie a bit, looking up at the other expectantly with flushed cheeks still prominent.
When Tony woke up, the tiny bundle wasn't in his arms, but the bed was still warm. He didn't need to be a genius to know Peter had gotten up on his own, probably to go play or sleep in his own bed. With a yawn, Tony slowly woke up, sadly picking at Steve's pajamas.
Tony bent to press a kiss to Peter's temple before gently putting him over his lap, grabbing a pillow for Peter to rest his head on.
Wiping his eyes, Peter splashed water on his face and tucked his feet under himself before calling out to Steve.
f'this," the boy complained, pouting until Tony put him down.
“Point taken.” Tony said with a hum, stroking his chin as he thought “Might have to take a note from his book with your clothes too so you’re not tearing through a pair each change. Have to work on the material to stretch with the shift in musculature and bones.”
"Are we getting our house?" Steve looked back at Tony with a hopeful look, taking the man's hand warmly.
Big tears welled up in his eyes and dripped down his cheeks while he cried up at Steve.
"It’s my most dominant side." Steve admitted, going and getting a wash cloth. He started to gently wash Tony off. "There are very few people in my life I care about, so I like to know they are taken care of well."
Seriously. Was everything this man did just preposterously hot? Tony started randomly kissing the flesh in front of him, pecs and biceps and abs, the shirts forgotten in favor of undoing Steve's fly and shoving his pants past his hips. His cock sprang free, and Tony's hand gravitated to it, around it... Well, as much as he could. Steve gasped and staggered backward, only avoiding getting his feet tangled in his pants because his calves hit the bed first. Tony went with him, tumbling the two of them down onto the bed, still kissing everywhere he could reach.
Tony nodded, already thinking about how he could distract Steve. “Yeah, dinner, good, see you then.” He cut the connection, then realized it might have been a bit abrupt... No, he was not going to be the weirdo that called back to apologize for hanging up first (mostly because he was afraid that they would then spend an hour or two playing 'you hang up first', 'no, you hang up first'). He was more mature than all of that, really.
liked
of it, Tony sprawled out, too spent to move, Steve's cum oozing out of his overused hole... He couldn't hold off any longer. He wrapped one arm around Tony's waist and the other hand around his jock, dropped his head back, and
He clucked his tongue, putting a hand back on Tony's back. “Now, now, pet, don't get ahead of yourself. We still have a lot of experimentation to do before we get back to that.” Tony gave a full-body shiver as he finished speaking, and all the tension drained back out of him. He took a couple of deep breaths, and Steve moved his hand away and reached for the whip. He snapped it out to the side a couple of times, to get the feel of it, then repositioned himself and struck both of Tony's ass cheeks at once, hard enough to sting but not hurt. Tony yelped and panted, and Steve struck again, just below the previous one, then twice more, on the backs of his thighs. He paused for a moment, then did the same set of four again, slightly offset from the previous ones and a little harder.
He grinned at her. “That will be all, Ms. Potts. Thank you.” His smile softened. “Really, Pep, thanks for all you do. You really are amazing.”
~A~A~
Nat, of course, figured it out instantly. “
He stepped back and turned toward the nearest viewscreen. “Of course, JARVIS, put her through.” The viewscreen lit up, and he smiled. “Good morning Pepper, what can I do for you?”
Tony's whole body twitched. “No. No, nothing like that, it was probably overdue for me to come out, I really do want to tell the whole world, and all that. I just...” His eyes drifted down; Steve could almost
JARVIS pinged. “Captain Rogers, Sir would like to speak with you, if you're available.”
want?”
And Tony could pretend to be dignified, at least. “Thank you. So glad someone is happy for us. Just for that you get to pick next week's movies.”
Steve bit his lip. “Should... I go apologize? Maybe offer to make him something? Should we not...”
Tony, kneeling upright now, grasped Steve's jock, firmly enough -
Oh, wow, he was so thoughtful. Or maybe just horny, but that was good by Steve too. “I, yeah, that's, that's a good idea. So, um, see you for dinner?” Oh, so awkward. At least Tony seemed to find it endearing...
Steve tried to sound stern. “You'd better not go dying on me just yet. I have so much more I want you to help me explore.” Tony made a noise that was half curious, half aroused, with an overlayer of sleepiness. Was it too early to bring up other things? Steve was feeling good enough to risk it. He got a good grip on Tony's hair, then gave a tug. Tony twitched, and made another noise with a lot less sleepiness, and Steve purred. Now was
Oh, and he loved Tony's laugh. “Excellent strategizing, Rogers. See, this is why I-” He faltered, but only for a split second, just long enough for Steve to notice and wonder about. “I keep you around. Because you plan ahead. But maybe save cooking the bacon for last?” He burst into a flurry of action, and Steve politely turned away, half his attention on the cooking process, the other half nursing a spark of hope, a glimmer of plans.
! Ha, oh, you totally deserved that!”
Oh, well. Up and at 'em, soldier...
Tony beamed at him. “It's a date, then.” He schooled his face to seriousness. “We just have to remember to not treat it like a date, so the tabloids don't get wind of it. Dammit, Rogers, why can't I flaunt you?” Steve just laughed as he cut the connection.
Tony smiled, or at least bared his teeth. “Perhaps you were visited by a swan, or a bull? No? The Archangel Gabriel?” Steve shook his head forlornly, but Tony gave a little laugh that rang false in Steve’s ear, and threw himself into an armchair. “Oh, breathe, it’s no big trouble. After all, I hardly come to this marriage pure, it would be cruel at best to expect it from you. Tell me.” He waved a languid hand.
Steve's hand tensed on Tony's hip, fingers digging in a little. “Now, why do I think that isn't exactly the truth?”
Steve took his cue, twitching his hips up and down in tiny little movements that still managed to feel like he was drilling deep into Tony's body. He went back to running his hands all over Tony's skin, trying his best to make mental notes on what made him gasp or moan or clench so delightfully. It was tough, though, to concentrate, with the way Tony was whimpering and pleading, broken fragments of “fuck, yes” and “your cock's so good”, and Steve bit Tony's shoulder, just to hold off his next orgasm a little longer.
Tony shrugged. “Will be claimed as mine, but whether it lives or dies will be in the hands of the Gods, not this mortal ruffian.”
*A*A*
*A*A*
to do? Something you're craving?” He blushed a little, and stared at Tony's shoulder. “Any fantasies you want to try?”
Pepper sighed, though she was smiling. “Tony, what did you break this time?”
while on his hands and knees?) “Meh, no thank you.”
I'm not a "posting schedules" kind of person. Sorry. My muse just doesn't work like that. But rest assured that this story is roughly plotted out, and will probably be 10-12 chapters, AND I have a couple of sequels in the works. Plots and plans, children, plots and plans...
Steve pretended to think. “Hmm, I don't know, there's all this paperwork I have to catch up on...” Tony gave an exaggerated pout, and Steve laughed at him. “Yes, Tony, that sounds wonderful. I'd very much like to have a museum date with you.”
, and there was one quick and easy way to do that. His hands wanted to be there, on Tony's hips, anyway, and from the way Tony's eyes lost focus, his hips wanted hands there too. “So, then, we agree. We're together because of who we are outside of the suits. I'm good with that. Go get plates.” He put a little bit of an order into the last part, and was pleased to see Tony obey without thought. Like a magic charm, the smell of bacon summoned the rest of the team, and Steve felt something settle in his chest. His family was gathered, enjoying his food, and he was about to move in with his lover. Life was good, and he couldn't help grinning madly at Tony, who grinned just as madly back.
Steve levered himself reluctantly to his feet and went to open the proper door. Hanging there were at least half a dozen bathrobes, all of them plush and fluffy, like the waffles this morning had been. He pawed through them til he found the biggest one, a soothing navy blue, and wrapped it around himself, then grabbed one the same red as Iron Man's armor and brought it over to drop on Tony's back. Tony wriggled just enough to get his arms into the sleeves, but otherwise didn't move.
Tony sighed and smiled back. “Well, I guess that's fair. I'm pretty interested in your health, too. Which, just so you know, is in serious danger. I mean, really, asking big questions before I've had my coffee? That's just playing with fire.”
Oh, GOD! The tight heat shot straight from his finger to his jock, and Steve nearly went off right then. He had to hold
Tony startled, spilling capsules and ampules across the work surface. “Geeze, what time is it?” He looked around wildly, realizing that Steve was also looking alert in a battle-ready sort of way.
Steve was trying to go slow, to make sure Tony was ready, but his jock was aching for the tight heat his fingers were exploring, and he decided he didn't really have
Thor pounded on the table. “Excellent! Our leader has a shield-mate, this will be excellent for the team!” He frowned and pointed at them. “You must vow to discuss your troubles with one another, lest they fester within and poison you, and then us.”
Steve could feel Tony's body tensing, beginning to arch up needfully, and he shifted back to his jock, licking it in the same rhythm as Tony's panting breath. When that got him calmed down to 'squirming' again, Steve moved to lick at his thighs, his stomach, the jut of his hips...
come from? “I wasn't asking
Tony got out of bed a bit more slowly. “Oh, ah, jeans. Always jeans in the 'shop, sweats get burn holes too easily.” He accepted the clothes and put them on, feeling a bit dazed. “Great. Thanks.” He ran that through his mental processors, realized how it might have sounded, and dredged up a real smile. “Really. Thank you. I know this disrupts your sleep too...”
Bruce quietly raised his coffee mug. “Well, I for one say congratulations. You both deserve happiness, and if you're finding it together I couldn't be happier for you.”
Tony burst out laughing. “Oh, my god, your face! No, no, I'm sorry to say, I'm not joking, there really are, it's just, you're...” He laughed again, some of it relief that this was all going so frighteningly well. “Well, good, glad that's on both our 'no' lists. Moving on?”
“Good morning, sirs. The time is eight am and the date is Tuesday, October ninth. The weather is a sunny 68 degrees Fahrenheit, predicted to last all day.”
how much you can hurt me, and that scares the Hell out of me. The idea of letting you in, letting you see...” He was breathing raggedly, and he took a moment to catch his breath. Steve's hand in his hair, clenching and unclenching like a heartbeat, was amazingly steadying, and he leaned into it just a little. “At the same time, I feel... God, I feel so safe with you, I don't think I've ever actually felt safe with anyone before, and that all by itself makes me feel angry and sad and freaked out and a bunch of other things, and I'm probably going to fight you every step of the way, I don't know how else to be, but I want it. I want us to explore that side of me together.” He closed his eyes, trembling, and tried to get his breathing under control... again.
. The things you do to me...” He leaned in closer, dropping kisses here and there on the wounds he'd just made. “The things I want to do to you...”

weird! Though, that Necessity one, I'm not sure if I'm insulted or relieved that they didn't ask for one of the early armors.” And of course that conversation carried them into the restaurant and through the ordering and delivering of food.
doing this to him, stunned that he'd been chosen, that Stark the Fuckup was going to get to be Captain America's experimentation... He could feel a thousand thoughts crowding his head-
Steve pulled his own sleep pants and t-shirt out of his duffel bag and onto his body, then twined his fingers with Tony's as they headed downstairs to the communal kitchen. Tony headed directly for the coffee maker while Steve pulled out cereal and a bowl. He sighed at the back of Tony's head. “Please tell me you plan you have some solid food, and not just survive on caffeine all day?” Tony sighed back, as if the whole thing was a huge hardship, but he dug a loaf of bread out of the cabinet and stuck a couple slices in the toaster. Steve smiled at him. “Thank you, baby, that makes me feel much better.” He poured juice in a glass and milk on his cereal, then took the whole thing over to the table and sat.
Steve sank onto a footstool. “I- I wasn’t even sure I could.” He gasped and darted a glance at Tony. “I probably shouldn’t have said- My father wants this alliance…” He sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face. “My last heat was a month and a half ago. Th- they’ve never been terribly regular, one of the reasons the medickers thought that- Anyway, I, I have this friend, he helps me through my heats, but then when it didn’t come a fortnight ago, I thought it was just skipping the month, it never occurred to me- Wait. How has no one else smelled this on me?”
with his brain splintering this way.) He tried to jerk his hips up for better hits, or down to get more friction where he most needed it, but Captain was
Steve wanted to cry for all the times someone had bruised Tony's heart, had made him fearful of relationships. He understood, now, why Tony seemed to favor short-term encounters, and he vowed to himself that he would never, ever hurt him like that. “Hey, hey, relax, shh, shh, it's ok. I want this too, I want you... I'm not sure I want the billboard, but yeah, I want you, and I doubt you're going to screw it up as bad as you think.” He met Tony's eyes earnestly, and dared a joke. “So, if I stay here tonight, am I going to wake up to Pepper hustling me out the door?”
Steve let himself be led back to the bedroom, feeling bemused and a little unmoored. “You had food delivered? Up here? When did you even have the time?”
Tony kissed him back, and gave a slightly more realistic smile. “So, on the same topic but maybe a happier note, I was thinking, within the family, and then whenever we're, you know, actually outed as a couple, since we both know it's gonna be me just kissing you in the park sometime or something, anyway, um... What do we call ourselves? Boyfriends? Partners? I guess, not that we have to decide now, but...” Damnit, now he was feeling all vulnerable and exposed again! This wasn't
Well, and that took up plenty of his attention, so it was ok. Up until this whole “Avengers” thing, Tony had always said he wasn't a team player. Even now, he had no interest in going along with the board of SI or anything crazy like that, but he was slowly learning that it was possible for a loose cannon like himself to work with a team, maybe even long term, without someone poisoning the coffee. In fact, he found he was doing better work with other minds to collaborate with, and (though he hated to admit it) people to drag him away from the lab sometimes, to do other things with his brain. And if a little too often, the other things his brain did involved, say, Steve and naked Jello wrestling, well, it was only in his head, and nothing showed on the outside. He totally had a handle on all this, he was making all this work, it was a delicate balance, but still good.
Steve nodded. “Thank you, JARVIS. Alright, folks, shall we put this on hold until our team member is back?” They teased him for playing leader all the time, but they moved to the living room and Clint put on Mario Kart to keep them occupied for a little while.
Steve heard Bruce in the elevator before it got to their floor. He was growling and muttering, and Steve had a moment to wish the Shield wasn't upstairs and out of reach before the doors opened and Bruce stomped out. He was barely holding it together, flushed green and eyes narrowed, but the sight of the team greeting him cheerfully and the smell of the food seemed to calm him a little. He shrugged apologetically. “I, ah... I forgot how bad Manhattan at rush hour can be. I'll be ok.”
And some awful good advice, too. Hopefully he could follow it. “Believe me, I plan to try. Tough with this one, though.” Tony was going to be a tough nut to crack, but Steve knew it would be worth it, to both of them.
On Saturday, Tony woke up in dire need of a piss and a quick wash. Once he'd taken care of that, he remembered that there was cake in the next room, and strolled out to snag it. Well, tried to stroll. It came out more a combination of swagger and bounce. He shrugged and decided to go with it. It wasn't like he didn't have every reason on earth for both. When he got back into the bedroom, he had to pause for a moment and enjoy the view. Steve was awake but still sleepy and mussed, and the early morning sun made his skin glow like finest marble. Tony climbed up onto the bed, balancing the cake plate carefully, and leaned down to kiss Steve, first the mouth, then one pec.
A moment later, Bruce was smiling at them from the wall, his face amusingly distorted by his phone's camera. “Hey guys.” They chorused a greeting. “Just wanted to let you know, Thor and Jane... well, they took off, and I have no idea where or when they'll be back. So I'm going to stay here tonight, and drive back in the morning.”
to continue this, I think we really do need breakfast.”
Howard nodded, actually looking a little impressed. “An excellent thought, son. One or two of his own people to watch over him, yes. No more than two, though.” His arm tightened, almost menacingly. “You know, I had been planning to talk to you soon about setting up your own household, within the larger castle household. This is a good first step, just remember that these guards, like all your other… indulgences, will be coming from your own coffers, not the duchy’s. Someone will need to keep an eye on those coffers, and I’m certain we would both rather it was you than me.”
Tony managed a shrug. (Honestly. Lying down? He'd made an
stumble over his words. “You said there were two things?”
that? There are people who are
Tony waved his hand impatiently, and the screen popped up with Nat's face. “Hey, Tony, Steve. Good news for you boys. Bruce found some science symposium at MIT this weekend, and apparently Dr. Foster is going to be there too, so Thor went with. Clint and I found a 48-hour film festival in Chelsea, so you two have the place to yourselves. Enjoy, try not to break too much furniture!” The image cut out.
Tony grinned back, and shifted the things in his arms so he could lean in for a kiss. “Hello, handsome, yourself.” He glanced at Steve's burdens, then, when the doors opened, headed out of the elevator and toward the bar and serving area. “Why don't you put that stuff in the bedroom while I lay this out? You gonna go back for the rest of it later?”
And Thor's was very... Thor. “It is well. We will spread the superior way of Asgard to all of Midgard with our example!” Steve couldn't wait to see the reporters' reactions.
Clint snorted. “How much cumming?” He smirked, chuckled, then outright laughed. Pretty soon the whole table was laughing, the tension well broken, and Tony felt a warm glow, close to but not related to, the arc reactor.
Until Thor burst out of the elevator, bubbling over with his own potent brand of good humor. Within moments, Tony was booting up the Game Cube, Clint was grabbing beers, and Bruce was setting up the popcorn machine. The six of them ended up battling it out in Super Smash Brothers for hours, until good-natured arguments over cheating and sabotage turned into childish bickering and name-calling, at which point Steve insisted everyone go to bed and sleep off the adrenaline.
Steve was on his side, head propped on one hand, and he was grinning back, but there was something a little off about it. “Well, I'm glad you're pleased with yourself.”  (Oh, shit. Number 84, Putting On A Brave Face!)
Steve stopped immediately, tossing the whip off the side of the bed, and moved in close, left hand on the small of Tony's back, right hand stroking softly across his welts. “It's ok, pet, it's gone, thank you for telling me, shh, shh, you're ok...” Tony took a deep, if shaky, breath, and let out his tension with a shiver. “There you go, good pet, just relax...” He kept soothing until Tony lifted his head and started to turn toward him, then pulled back.
. Steve's boiling-over emotions drove him to kiss Tony again. “I would love to move in with you, if you actually meant it. I- I would be honored.” Hmm, maybe too much emotion. Back to a light mood. “But I'm not going to make you breakfast every single morning. Just because we're living together doesn't mean I'm a good little housewife.”
Steve didn't even try to draw any of the paintings in his sketchbook; he had no idea how even to start such a thing, but he also thought he might do some paintings of his own one of these days. He just let himself be inspired and humbled, until he circled back around to the beginning of the exhibit, and blinked out of his daze. He grinned at Tony. “Wow. Thank you, this was amazing. What else is here?” They headed out of the gallery and down the hall.
Captain's voice was a complicated, thrilling blend of sweetly soothing and darkly possessive. “That's ok, pet, we can find out together.” One hand went back to Tony's hair, and it really was delightfully like being pet like a dog. The other hand scooped up some more cake, and brought it to Tony's lips. “Here, you're going to need the energy.” He opened his mouth, accepting the cake but focusing more on twining his tongue around the fingers. Captain groaned. “Oh, pet, so good...” He pulled his fingers back out, and from the look on his face, he was as turned on by this as Tony himself. He got one more bite, smaller this time, and offered it up again. Tony licked his lips, just to watch Captain lick his in response, then leaned in and wrapped his mouth around Captain's fingers. He gave a short, sharp suck, and grinned (as much as he could) when Captain's whole body twitched hard. “God, pet, you are so damn sexy... Oh, yeah, suck them nice and clean...”
! Besides, I don't get viral or bacterial infections anymore.” Steve was sure he was blushing. “No, I... I just... How much of, of last night and all of this, is because I'm, you know,
Friday morning was spent running partial-team tactics and strategies, honing their teamwork. When lunchtime rolled around, Steve called a halt. He took a minute to towel off some sweat, while Clint dumped a bottle of water over his head and Nat stretched and bent. He grinned at them. “OK, guys, that was excellent. Clint, I still want to come up with better communications for that 'arrow off the Shield' move, but our teamwork is definitely getting better. Let's break for lunch-”
Thor raised his mug. “It is well. We will spread the superior way of Asgard to all of Midgard with our example!” He thumped his mug on the table hard enough to make the plates jump. Tony suddenly wondered what exactly he'd gotten himself into.
He took a deep breath, then another, letting his hips move as they would, but otherwise trying to calm himself down a little, trying to let himself build up to the next one a little slower. He deliberately slowed everything down, letting his hands drift, drinking in all of Tony's little noises and needy words. “You're so beautiful like this, pet, dripping with sweat and begging to cum... God, I could keep you like this all night and you'd beg for tomorrow, too. Mmm...” He pinched and pulled Tony's nipples, moaning at the way that made Tony's inner muscles clench
Tony sighed explosively and shoved himself up, away from Steve, out of bed, over to the dresser, too tired and on edge to censor himself. “Oh, right. I'm supposed to be being honest with you and all that, stupid Thor. Fine, the truth is, I know damn well I'm not getting back to sleep tonight, so I'm gonna go down to the lab, maybe work on suit schematics or something. You happy now?” He yanked boxers, jeans, and a t-shirt out of the drawers.
The weight suddenly lurched and lifted off of him. “Steve? Steve, baby, wake up! It's a nightmare!” He snapped up his left arm, as if hefting the Shield, then realized the arc reactor was in front of him. He yanked his arm back at the last moment, then pulled his whole body away from Tony, who was still reaching out to him. “Hey, hey, it's ok, just breathe, you're safe, you're here in the Tower with me, you're ok...”
Tony leaned forward. “But?”
Steve needed to touch him, to be fully honest, to look him in the eye and see if there was the possibility... “I would be happy to brag about you to whoever. I'm more than willing to tell people. What do
Tony nodded. “I would rather this marriage were not a prison sentence for either of us. Steve has said you are his only two friends in all the world, and I would not take that from him if I can avoid it.”
has been getting lately.” He stepped into Tony's personal bubble and Tony automatically turned his face up. Steve grinned (No. 202, Genuinely Happy) and leaned in to kiss him. “I think the team will figure things out pretty quickly as soon as I kiss you at breakfast.”
Tony felt warmth flood him, but also worry. “I, ah. Well, I'm gonna go down there. You don't have to. You-”
The elevator dinged open on the communal floor, and Clint bounced out. “Oh, my God, that was so much fun! We totally have to do the next one, too, we could get the team to do it, I don't know if I want us all to be one crew, or split up and see what everyone comes up with!” He leaned into the stairwell and up. “Hey, lovebirds! Put on some pants and come see what we made this weekend!”
The deli, when they got to it, was smallish, older, but clearly a popular spot, if the crowd inside was any indication. The folks behind the counter were, with most of the customers, as friendly as New Yorkers usually got, but when they saw Tony, they lit up. He spent a few minutes chatting with them as they filled other orders, asking after one's kids, another's elderly mother. Steve just leaned against a shelving unit full of snack foods and watched fondly as Tony showed off the charm that made him so popular at every level of society. When it was their turn, Steve got a foot-long Italian sub and a foot-long “New York Special”, while Tony got a six-inch chicken Parmesan, and some potato salad he said was for both of them. Almost as an afterthought, he snagged a couple of bottles of soda, too. The woman who rang them up teased Tony in Italian, about Steve, if the look she gave him was anything to go by. Steve didn't even try to suppress the blush, especially when Tony's response was delivered with a fond laugh.
Tony grinned, and, with his usual complete lack of self-preservation instinct, slung an arm around Bruce's shoulder. “Well, good, then you can explain to me how Farber can possibly- you
No, you know what? It was
Steve was aware that the noise he made was beyond undignified and probably into embarrassing, but his jock was trying to stir again under him, so he didn't much care. “Oh, yeah.” He took another look at all of it, then bit his lip and glanced over at Tony. “I don't know if I mentioned it earlier, but I'm open to you using some of this stuff on me, too.”
Nat darted a look back and forth between them. “
Duchess Maria squeezed his arm gently. “Well, your pretty manners will help, I’m sure. Now, through that door there is a bathing chamber, and I made sure a bath would be drawn and waiting for you. Would you like me to send up a servant to help, or do you prefer the solitude?”
to continue this, I think we really do need breakfast.”
It had the desired effect; Tony laughed and relaxed against him. “If she does, I'll fire her for being a jealous bitch. Honestly, though. Please stay. This... this is really good.” He paused thoughtfully. “Well, ok, there is one way it could be better. Stay put.” He got up, and Steve lay back, happy to drift as Tony splashed about in the washroom. He was going to have to prove to Tony that he wasn't going anywhere, but perversely he thought tying him to the bed might just do it. Oh, there was a pleasant thought, Tony naked, splayed and vulnerable... Tony returned, bearing a washcloth with which he cleaned Steve up. Oh, wow, was he already falling into that role? Oh, this was going to be good...
Bruce couldn’t explain it any better than Tony or JARVIS could, and in the end they had to call Dr Strange for a medical-magical consultation. He arrived, in his usual showy way, through a portal, directly into the Avengers’ living room, startling the team.
This was still better than the last time he was dying, though, so there was that. Steve had carried him out to the communal living room, and the team had stuck around him nearly the entire time, napping on the couches instead of sleeping on their own floors. He’d blasted through all the annoying legal paperwork, updating his will and all that bullshit (including leaving a single Iron Man promotional poster to
And of course the others weren't far behind. Nat's reply was very Russian. “Might as well, it's not like the fanboys can objectify me more, right?”
“I- really? Uh, yeah, I guess.” Tony blinked at the idea of a visible aura, but forced himself to push on. “Well, so far, it seems to have turned my toes into marble. Weird but livable, but I have this sneaking suspicion it won’t stop there.” He flopped back onto an armchair, and stuck his feet up in the air for all to see.
Steve was already bubbling with happiness, and the absurdity of that made him boil over into laughter. “Yes, because when I think of Tony Stark, I think laid back. Wouldn't want to break that illusion.” He couldn't help it, he had to kiss him. There was so much he wanted to say... No, not yet. Better to keep it light for now. “So, Bucky always told me, if they let you stay the night, make breakfast for 'em the next day. You want breakfast?”
And then there was Stark. Tony. He'd thought, when he first heard that Howard had a son who was also an inventor, and more so when he got his first look at Tony, that he would be having to remind himself every few minutes that the son was not the father, and he couldn't treat them the same. But Tony was so completely his own person, there were moments Steve forgot there was even anyone else in the room, just caught up in Tony's voice, and his manic hands, and his completely unique ideas. Tony
Tony nodded emphatically. “Wise words, my Lord. I will take them to heart. And now, I think we must both see to our guests, yes?” He bowed and headed back into the glittering crowd. Once again, however, he had a specific goal in mind. It didn’t take him long to find Earl Steven, or to whisper in his ear. “Those guardsmen you told me of? Will you introduce me to them?”
, surely you are not here for the winter clothings yet, no? I have hardly begun to design-”
, and Tony gave a breathy little laugh. “I know, baby, I know, I want to go faster too, but
Steve blinked and grinned sappily at him. (oh, hey, that was a new one! Call it no. 247, Just Got Laid. Score!) “Hey, handsome.” His fingers tangled in Tony's hair, and he succumbed to the desire to make a little grumbly, purry noise and nuzzle his cheek into Steve's shoulder. Steve chuckled. “Well, I guess
) out of him. He knew his breath was harsh, his throat raw, but that was a concern so distant as to be practically nonexistent. Somewhere far away, Cary Grant was yelling about not being a Brewster, but right here, Steve's hand was
Oh, wow, where did
Steve nodded absently and drifted off to the side, toward a canvas that was nothing but a swathe of red on the top half and a swathe of green on the bottom half. His hand lifted, as if he wanted to touch the paint, but he restrained himself, just breathing in and out as if he could absorb the color through his lungs and skin. After a few minutes, something caught his attention, and his glance darted over to the next canvas, his feet following helplessly after. Tony was utterly charmed by his honest appreciation, and willingly lost track of time as Steve lingered in front of each painting, caught in contemplation.
Steve gave a little laugh with no humor and hugged him close. “I'd rather you woke me up than suffered alone. Do you want to talk about it?”
“What?” Tony sat up sharply, his heart pounding, hardly noticing that he had yanked his hair out of Steve's hand. “No, don't be ridiculous, I'm totally a Dom, I'm very glad you've learned these words, by the way, that's very exciting, but just ask anyone, I'm so a Dom, I don't know what you think-”
Tony let out a bitter laugh, knowing that he had given his heart away a long time ago, to someone who was just a poster on the wall back then. “Yeah. Ironic, that. Well, thanks for all the help you haven’t been, Doc. I’ll make sure to leave you something in my will.” He did his best impression of storming out of the conference room, which was more pathetic and stompy, considering the whole “turning to stone” thing had made it most of the way up his calves by now. At this rate, his knees wouldn’t bend by dinnertime. The ride up to the Avengers’ private floors was silent, JARVIS wisely not trying to give him false hope.
But mostly he was pleased. He could tell himself that it was gladness that his bridegroom would not be a shy, retiring flower in the marriage bed, and it was true enough. Underneath, however, was anticipation at having a family of his own. This babe might not be his by blood, but he would claim it as such, and raise it with as much love and care as he possibly could. (Granted, he worried sometimes that he had little love to share, having received so little in his own childhood, but that fear only ever renewed his vow to be a better parent than his own had been.)
Bruce nodded. “Good catch, I was experimenting-”
Steve nobly fought the urge to peel Tony out of every stitch of that fine fabric, right there in the team living room, and instead tucked his sketchbook and pencil pouch under one arm and offered Tony the other elbow. “Would you accompany me to lunch, good sir?”
Steve squirmed a bit. “It's someone who, you know... goes with, um, sleeps with, both men and women.”
Steve took a couple steps toward him. “No, actually. I thought there might be something up with you. You were awfully quiet all evening. You ok?”
Tony jumped. “Well, you know, now that you mention it...” Steve could feel the scorch of his gaze, down and up again. “But I did want to say... So, I know I promised you nice suits and a classy meal, but I was hoping you didn't want that
Steve's face lit up in a smile. “Honestly, that sounds pretty great to me. Um...” He turned shy. “I could, maybe... bring all my stuff upstairs? And we can have celebratory egg rolls?”
Tony's heart was pounding so hard he was half-expecting the arc reactor to start vibrating. He tried to be at least a little casual. “Yeah, sure, that sounds good. And we can watch movies you've already seen, so if we get distracted...”
Steve grinned fiercely, pleasure and love and arousal and joy all swirling together, sparking heat in his gut. He kissed the very tip of Tony's jock. “Good boy, pet.” And then he swallowed it down to the root, as hot and wet as he could make it, and sucked hard. He couldn't help the growl that arose in his throat, but Tony seemed to approve. He cried out at the top of his voice and spurted, hard and hot, into Steve's mouth. Steve pulled back just enough that he could taste it properly, and eagerly swallowed everything Tony gave him.
Steve nodded. “I'm in.”
about these fantasies you've had.” Tony opened his mouth to answer, but Steve glided around behind him, slid his hands down Tony's arms, and lifted them back up to the hologram. “
Steve reminded himself that he had a schedule to keep, and hurried about his ablutions. When he had washed the dust of the road (and at least some of his anxiety) away, he got out of the tub, wrapped a soft towel around his body, and opened the drainage spigot. He resisted the urge to watch all the water drain away so neatly, and instead headed back out to the bedroom. He had barely gotten two steps into the room, however, when he stopped short, staring at the figure on his bed.
Steve's head snapped around. “Was. Not exactly am anymore, in case you hadn't noticed!”
Tony's hips lurched upward as he keened, a noise nearly high enough to shatter glass, then gulped air. “OhmyGod, ohmyGod, ohmyGod. That's- You're- How are you this good-?” He felt like he could hardly think, let alone form words, but he forced himself to drop back down.
Tony closed his eyes and focused on just breathing. He had to remind himself that if his body tried to orgasm again this quickly, it was probably going to
, that was amazing!” He lifted one hand, waving it about in a lethargic imitation of his usual gesticulation. “God, I think I've had more orgasms this weekend than I'd had in any previous
Clint squinted at them, then gaped. “Holy shit, they are! Look how smug you both are!” Sure enough, Tony knew he was grinning like the cat that got the canary
for you.” Marco's eyes lit up. “He's going to need everyday suits, evening suits, the whole deal. Oh, and a tux, eventually, but probably not before the Christmas season.”
“This!” Tony stuck his foot out toward Bruce and waved it around. “This is me trying to wiggle my toes, by the way, which you may note is not happening. None of my toes will move, Bruce!” He wobbled and grabbed for a lab table to steady himself.
*A*A*
Nat waved a dismissive hand. “He's not as upset as he plays at. This is just him adjusting.” Her body language softened a little. “And probably missing Coulson more than he'll admit.” She shot them a sharp look, and Tony immediately mimed zipping his lip. “I'll bring him the coffee, you two clear out, maybe I can get him back out here once he knows it's safe.” She shooed them out, and they went.
Steve shifted to stroking his head. “Thank you for telling me that, pet. I can tell how hard it was for you.” He pulled Tony close, til their whole torsos were flush, and all but whispered in his ear. “I'm honored that you trust me so much. I promise I won't betray that.” The sincerity in his voice shot a thrill up and down Tony's spine that was like grabbing a 220 wire bare-handed, and Tony groaned and tried to press even closer to Steve. “So we'll start with some safety, hmm? I thought, for now, we'll use basic safewords, and then later if we want to change them, we can.” A new wave of emotion washed over him, mostly gratitude, relief, lo-fondness... He nodded. “Good, so. If you need to pause, or you need me to change something, you say 'yellow.' And if you need to stop, say 'red,' and we'll stop and talk it out, ok?”
Tony huffed impatiently. “I don’t care if they’re wafer thin. Long shots is what I do. Spill!”
around him. Oh, and he could
... He fastened his mouth on the tender flesh of Tony's inner thigh, up high near his balls, and started sucking on it. Tony's fingers dug into his scalp, pulling him closer, and he bit, hard enough to show he meant it.
Tony was peppier than usual in the elevator on his way down several floors to his official public Stark Industries office and lab. Heck, he was almost singing and dancing, and that was no good. The lab rats would never again fear him if they saw him at anything less than high dudgeon (he might be able to get away with low dudgeon, just for today. What the heck
Clint looked over and fluttered his eyelashes at them. “Aww, look how cozy you two are! Look at- damn, how many hickeys do you
Tony smiled at him sleepily, then the smile got bigger... and bigger... “Good morning yourself. I might even say great morning, but that might ruin my rep as a laid-back guy.”
- let himself indulge in running his hands over Tony's torso, marveling at how soft his skin was, soaking in the tingle of the arc reactor.
Steve pressed his lips desperately to Tony's for a long moment, then pulled back the barest amount. “Mine. My Tony, my pet, my-” He slid into Tony in one long, smooth thrust, and Tony keened in pleasure. “God, yes. So perfect for me, so good, so sweet...” He went back to peppering kisses wherever he could reach, his hips snapping back and forth in nearly the same rhythm. Tony felt drunk, beyond high, worshiped and deconstructed in equal measure, completely incapable of anything besides whimpering, moaning, and writhing needfully.
He was close, now, right at the knife's edge of orgasm. He managed to meet Steve's eyes for a moment, and saw that he was close too. Then Steve's hand wrapped around his cock and stroked it twice, three times... Tony was pretty sure he bellowed as he came, but he couldn't quite tell through the wash of light and soundless sound that overtook him.
Ten minutes later, Tony was laying a sheet over the couch (“So we can sit out here naked and not worry about the upholstery.”) while Steve set out the rest of the Chinese food. Tony went to flop down, then remembered his welts and sat quite a bit more carefully, which made Steve smug. He could tell he was smirking as he dug in to the beef with broccoli. “This is really nice. I'd like to do this all the time.”
the cream, and Steve wasn't much better. Clint pointed at him. “Stop it! Stop making that face! Captain America should not have 'I just had fantastic sex' face!”
Duke Howard threw an arm around Tony’s shoulders and steered him into a quiet alcove. “My dear boy, I hope you are not seeking advice on the bedding tomorrow night? I was sure you were well versed in such matters.”
*A*A*
*A*A*
a good boy. Such a sexy pet.” He rested his hand on the small of Tony's back, but it had other ideas, and traced along some of the myriad of red marks and welts beginning to raise. Tony whimpered and arched into his touch, and Steve brought his right hand into play as well, exploring which areas were tender, which were blazing with heat from within. It took a real effort of will to cut all that short, to move on to the next step of the experiment.
It took a moment or two for Tony to get his breathing under control, and another before he shook his head, sharply, as if trying to clear his ears. “Mm, yeah. No, thank you.” His hips gave an unhappy little twitch, and Steve used his right hand to stroke up and down Tony's thighs and ass, soothing him like a nervous animal. When he relaxed, just that little bit, Steve took his hands away and picked up the paddle. He did the same set of smacks, one-two, one-two, one at medium strength, one a little harder, and one with real intent. By the time he started the third set, Tony was gasping and whimpering, and before he'd finished, he was already nodding. “Yes, please, more, harder, please, Captain!”
Steve gave as good as he got for a few lovely minutes, then pulled away reluctantly. “We should probably eat while it's still hot. We-” He leaned in and went back to kissing.
The next morning, Dr Strange did Tony the courtesy of calling before just showing up, and so he had the chance to commandeer an empty SI conference room so the two of them could have some privacy. He still couldn’t help fidgeting while the sorcerer made bizarre and complex gestures in the air between them. “So? You know all the magic, right? You’re taking it off now, right?”
Fortunately, distraction came quickly, in the form of Tony storming into the room. “OK, so I’m pretty sure there’s something freaky going on here, but maybe I’m just hallucinating, which, call me crazy, but that might actually be better-” He was dressed only in a t-shirt and flannel pants, his hair wild, suggesting he had actually slept in a bed, and had just now woken up.
, and it was so, so good. He was squirming, his cock rubbing, and the noises he was making had only a passing acquaintance with any human language, but right now he couldn't care.
. They could kiss on a street corner in Brooklyn, or in Times Square, and the most likely reaction from strangers would be cheers and whistling. The future was
She got even icier (and Steve knew from ice). “Don't even try. He came in this morning looking like he should have cute fuzzy woodland creatures frolicking around him, and JARVIS says you spent last night with him.” Steve's whole body went cold with shock, then hot with embarrassment. “So, what are your intentions? I should tell you that if you break his heart, I will be obligated to bury you in several shallow graves.”
Steve, whose eyes had been locked on his face, now turned away, blushing a little. “Been forever, technically. I've never- never before-”
He lost track of time, of the whole world, really, his awareness narrowed down to the thud of Captain's hand on his ass, his thighs and back, and to the delicious, but not-quite-enough, friction of his cock against Captain's thigh. (If he could concentrate just right, he was pretty sure he could count the hairs on that section of thigh, his cock was that sensitive, but there was no way he was concentrating on
wrapping around his cock, kindling his whole body like a
Tony must have known, since he pulled away (oh, wow, even that felt pretty amazing!) and got out of the rest of his clothes. He dug around in the bedside table, but before Steve could see what he'd gotten, he was back, climbing into Steve's lap, kissing him, pressing their jocks together... Steve felt like fireworks had gone off in his crotch, a live wire from Tony into him...
want?”
Tony looked conflicted. “If we must.” Steve could see the scheming blossom across his face. “Hmm, you know, I think we'll need eggs and bacon, to fuel more escapades later....” He got up out of bed, and Steve took a moment to enjoy the way the early-morning light played across his dusky skin. Tony bent over to rummage in a drawer, and Steve had to fight down the nearly overwhelming urge to walk up behind him, grab him by the hips, and- he was jolted out of the thought by fabric hitting his head, and he shook himself out and got up to get dressed. Tony grinned at him. “The shirt might be a bit small, and half the team will probably figure out that you slept up here just by what you're wearing, but if I let you go down there naked, then Thor will think it's ok to walk around naked, and I so do not need that image in my brain.”
“Steve?” Tony fidgeted with his shirt instead of putting it on. When Steve looked over, he tried a smile. “Thank you. I know I'm a handful...”
With that thought, Tony made his way over to his own father. “My Lord. If I might have a moment to discuss a practical matter?”
*A*A*

stung. “Was. Not exactly am anymore, in case you hadn't noticed!” He flexed his hips up. Oh, no, bad plan! Focus, Rogers!
Steve put his hand on Tony's back, and rubbed in soothing little circles. “Hey, hey, I was just checking. I have a vested interest in your continued good health, you know.” Tony shot him a look out of the corner of his eye, and Steve grinned at him.
He tangled one hand lightly in Steve's hair. “Well, you know, I'm pretty much never going to say no to a blow job...” Steve suckled on it, and Tony groaned. “God... That, that is so hot, you have no idea...” His cock was filling fast, which shocked the hell out of him. “Seriously, look at what you're doing to me.”
Barnes’ shoulders had relaxed, but his eyes were still full of uncertainty. “And the babe?”
Tony scrubbed his face with his free hand. “No. I mean, yeah, but it's fine. Was there something you needed?”
Steve's hands seemed to be magnetically attracted to Tony's hips, but when he touched them, Tony tensed and gave a little gasp. Steve pulled away. “Oh, sorry! Wait, what?” He scooted up and back, suddenly worried he'd done something wrong. Tony sat up with him, and the blankets fell away. Steve was both horrified and incredibly turned on to see bruises in the shape of his hands on Tony's hips. Steve wanted awful badly to touch them, to run his fingertips along them, but he didn't quite dare. “Oh, wow, did I do that to you? Jeeze, Tony, I'm sorry, I didn't-” Didn't plan to, didn't ask first, but oh, he was going to ask next time, cover him in hand-shaped bruises...
Tony tried to go back to work after the call with Pepper, but he was really just tinkering with the ideas from earlier, while most of his mind was on Steve. His body was reminding him of how much fun they'd had last night, which made him think of Steve, sprawled out under him, hands gripping his hips... Oh, god, the hand-bruises... He touched one of them gingerly, and immediately had to talk sternly to his cock, which was responding surprisingly quickly. There was no way Tony would be able to sit across a white-clothed table from Steve, and look at him in a nice suit, and not want to just have his way with him right there in the restaurant. The fancy date was definitely going to have to wait. “JARVIS? Is Steve around?”
silent, which was definitely an indicator of
The post-nightmare shakes didn't seem to take as long as usual. As soon as he felt like he could move, he rolled away, shoulders stiff. “Sorry about that. Didn't realize I'd wake you. Ah, you can-”
Steve reached over and took a forkful of potato salad of his own. “Oh, now you're going to bring my age into this? You know, back in my day, we had respect for our elders, there was none of this talking back...”
Thor, well, he was boisterous, and that was good too. “Excellent! Our leader has a shield-mate, this will be excellent for the team!” Shield-mate. Someone to stand back-to-back with him against everything the world, the
He didn't let himself think about what might happen after. In noticing Tony, he had also seen Tony notice him, at least a little, so there was a possibility of something there, but Tony was a known womanizer. Steve had only ever heard of him going with women, generally only for short periods of time, and very public about all of it. Most likely he wasn't interested in men at all, but even if he was, he clearly kept things well hidden, and Steve had no interest in being anyone's dirty little secret, or hidden lover-on-the-side. Heck, despite all the changes he'd embraced, he wasn't even interested in the modern ideas of hookups and friends with benefits. He wanted a real relationship, with dates and anniversaries and waking up together, and if Tony wasn't capable of that with him, or wasn't willing to try, Steve wasn't going to push. Or get his hopes up. It would be enough to just live honestly, and if he was lucky, he would find someone else who really understood the life of a superhero. And had a mind that fascinated him. And who wanted to teach him things. And was heart-stoppingly beautiful. If he was really, seriously lucky...
Tony paused again, giving Steve a chance to absorb the information.
"No teasing?" Tony fake pouted, stealing a kiss before putting the ring back.
" I dunno. I'd have to see some of your work before I can just let you draw me. I don't just want some weirdo who has no skill drawing me and making me look bad.".
"You--
"Here's to hoping the second one isn't a total horrid," Tony laughed, "I betcha he's gonna be stubborn like you, and try and get Pete in trouble. When they're older."
Tony nodded.
"Oh, save it," Tony grunted, "I made cookies for you guys."
"They're being children," Tony laughed quietly, setting about stuffing Pete's stocking, "Nat's gonna set 'em straight. She looked absolutely pissed."
"Yeah, I'll go and get one tonight," Tony murmured, petting the baby's fine hair, "Poor thing is probably in pain."
"Alright Jay, let's get these upgrades done so we can get back to Project Firefly."
"I'm gonna braid your hair, baby," Tony hummed, scooting behind Peter, "Just like Uncle Bucky, okay?"
"Why is it that a kid's internal alarm clock automatically wakes them up so early at Christmas?" Steve sighed, wrapping his arm around Tony's waist as they went back to the bedroom.
"Let's see how well you reinforced it, shall I?" He stated, jumping and flopping down onto the bed. "Ooooh my goodness, this is comfortable--" He stated, muffled with his face in the mattress.
"Anything that you want to do. Sir." Steve continued with the word, breathing lightly against Tony's lips. "Or I can do what you want me to. Whatever your preference is, Sir--" he purred.
with-, but the boy had grown into a brave, strong, and kind young man before his eyes, and Steve had made sure he was there for him. Not as a lover, as he had wished to be with his Tony, but as his godfather; As the one he could confide in when he felt he could confide in no one else.
make me pop you on the behind, mister," Tony scolded lightly.
"She's sweet on him." Steve teased back, taking his french toast and coffee bounty into the dining room to sit down and eat before he started the rest of the day.
Tony opened the door, blinking at the sight of the glorious man in front of him.
'I'm happy you like it. Wanted to show you I appreciate all you've done for me, y'know?' The blond hummed, looking over at Tony fondly. 'You go out of your way to help me with so much, I can't ever possibly thank you enough, Tony. Really.'
"That's it baby, let go," He breathed, biting down on Steve's pulse point on his neck, "C'mon--"
"I'm not a ding dong," Tony complained, "That was mean. Real mean. Maybe we'll just go to a motel in downtown Jersey for that comment." He grinned, ruffling Steve's hair.
"Go get dressed, mister romantic," he laughed, "So I can make myself look extremely sexy for you."
"I think the only thing you could do wrong is snap my dick off with your tight little ass," Tony replied smugly, tapping Steve's hips, "Switch places with me, Stevie."
He reached over for the discarded bottle of lube, slicking up his fingers before slipping one into Steve.
"Whaaaaat?" Steve whined back with a grin, laying his head on Tony's stomach.
Steve looked to Tony carefully for a moment. "Have you ever been on an actual date, Tony?" He asked curiously.
Steve scooted back and sat on the floor, laying against the wall as he still watched his boys happily.
"That's my boy, Petey." Steve said with a grin, smooching the boy's face playfully. He was glad Peter was up for it.
Steve threw his head back against the headboard, teeth biting into his lip to the point of bleeding. Not much more before he was going to come. Tony grinned, reaching up to tweak his nipples, pulling back ever so slightly. Steve came right soon after with a sharp exhale, toes curling up and hands tensing against the cuffs as he did. Tony swallowed it all, pulling off with a wet 'pop'.
She pulled another folder out of her bag, flipping it open and passing pens over to them.
night since you returned from the front lines," Tony murmured, kissing the edge of Steve's lips, "And we know not to assume, Steven. That's not proper in my line of business."
He lightly dragged his nails down Steve's chest, flicking a nipple. Steve gasped at the touch, leaning with it as Tony moved.
Nick Cage." He grinned, reaching up to card his fingers through Steve's hair.
"No fank you, I jus' wan sleep," Peter replied, eyes already closed.
“That’s odd. U always joins you for bed,” He pondered, “She has been acting a little out of sorts lately, hasn’t she? Even then, she is always with you for bedtime…”
Tony looked over and immediately picked up the boy, ignoring his silverware clattering to the floor.
"Why don't we go get socks
The metal-armed guy sighed, shaking his head. "Steve's always wandering around.".
"So we'll need to get this moved onto this wall here and get everything set up there." Steve directed as they tried to maneuver the bed parts into the room.
Tony looked back at Steve and saw the worry and hurt on his face. He turned his eyes away from Steve before talking softly, his voice breaking in the process.
With that, Tony surged forward and captured the blond's lips again in a meaningful kiss, tilting his head ever so slightly in order to deepen it. He moved his hands around Steve's waist, moving them enough that he could recline the other on the length of the couch. The shift in position earned him a soft sigh of contentment from the smaller man beneath him, slender hands wrapping around the back of his neck to tug him down further.
Clint put his hands up again, stuffing potatoes in his mouth to keep himself from talking.
"Yeah, I'd appreciate if you didn't. Parking lots are dirty. And not in the good way." He chuckled, driving out of the lot and heading for the theater.
It was now the middle of May. Steve's project would be due in less than two weeks and he still needed to decide on what to make of the last piece. He didn't worry about it too much though. He had been spending so much time with Tony, Steve had no doubt it would come to him soon.
Steve's moans started quiet as Tony started moving, slowly increasing in volume each time it even barely touched his sweet spot.
"Uh- huh. I weally like the Gwinch," Peter replied enthusiastically, beaming at Pepper, "He's lots like Daddy."
The blond cracked his eyes open softly, seeing Tony next to him again and gravitating closer to him as they snoozed. He kissed at his fiancé's cheeks sweetly, wrapping around him comfortably. Tony nuzzled him back in his sleep, curling into Steve's warmth.
"Good thing for me, you'll always be older." Steve smirked, straightening everything up around the room.
"Are dey feedin' dem
He carried the boy over to the waiting nurse, helping Pete into his little gown, gloves and booties before donning the wear himself, leading the boy into the room.
Tony looked down into his coffee and started to explain things further.
yet, Tony. I'm almost thirty-five."
"No doodling?" Tony asked.
"Sleepy," he demanded, putting his head on Steve's chest.
He flicked his eyes down to his pillow then back up at Steve, looking at his hairline instead of meeting his gaze.
"Not dat 'posal! Da bus'ness kind." Peter explained with a giggle. "I wants a day where someone watches Sammy 'n me, you'se, and Papa has a day tugetha."
"You sure you don't want your old man to teach you?" He teased.
Steve breathed carefully as his eyesight was temporarily taken, his hearing sense sharpened slightly and hearing Tony clatter things around on the desk. He took a deep breath, prepping himself for whatever Tony would start out with.
Tony nodded, letting himself lean against Steve so he could get up. He grabbed the blade and cleaned it off, putting it back in its drawer once it was dry. With a sigh, Tony rifled through the cabinet for his medicine, dry swallowing a half of a pill before turning to Steve.
"I love you," Tony murmured, giving Steve's jaw a light nip before grabbing the lube from its place on the nightstand.
"Upset you're losing the binky, baby?" He laughed, smooching his cheek.
"I'd hope not," Tony breathed, grinning as he scraped his nails down Steve's chest, "I have to behave, though. I'm not ravaging you in our backyard. Yet."
"There's the smile I know and love," Tony teased, hugging the boy tight.
He returned to fixing up the frame, sitting back once he was content with the structure.
"You know exactly what, Rogers," Tony snorted, "I'm gonna dig my glasses out, just to celebrate."
"I like to roleplay, what can I say?" Steve huffed a breathy chuckle. "And you are my smart, young Sherlock."
. I still hate him," Tony muttered, "That was so awful."
Tony took a breath and nodded, crawling into bed and curling up to Steve's chest. He kissed his collar, tangling their legs together before settling down in the warmth.
. Need you, please. Ah, damn..." He whined as Tony continued to hit at his spot. He panted against Tony's chest, hands gripping at the sheets.
"Otay..." He murmured back softly. "I'm sorry Daddy." Peter murmured with a small sniffle as Tony left.
"Tell me about it," Tony laughed, cuddling Peter to his chest, "We used to do the same with you and pull-ups, mister."
"You're such a cheeseball, oh
He parked the car, turning to grin at Steve.
Tony's eyes shot open, his heart beating wildly and mind going a mile a minute. It was another panic attack. He started to clutch at his chest, no ARC reactor to be found. He started to hyperventilate, unaware of his surroundings.
"No!" Peter wailed, sitting up with his chest heaving.
smiled, huffing a small laugh.
"Sowwy you boff feel sad." Peter said softly, kissing at the spot he was cuddled up to.
He hummed in content, completely loose and languid against his husband.
"Now Daddy, don't pick on poor Petey. We aren't allowed to tease him about girlfriends or boyfriends yet," Steve cooed, smooching at Peter's red face. "We can pick on him about it tomorrow."
Sammy blinked and put his hand up to his lips, babbling while he attempted to 'blow' kisses at Peter. Pete blinked, doing the motion back, giggling when Sammy repeated him.
"No, no," Tony squeaked, "Not far enough. Keep going."
want a date. And nothing more than a date." Tony grinned, laughing at Steve's pout.
'Thank you, JARVIS.' The blond beamed, thinking about what all he could attempt. 'Say, do you know any easy recipes that can also be considered for special occasion?'
Steve nuzzled Tony's cheek and left light kisses. "We can talk about it all once we actually get this baby business started after the meeting Friday."
"Sorry, I’m not familiar with how it all works in the aftermath." Steve teased. "It was fun, though. The whole thing. And it felt...amazing, to say the least." He sighed in content.
"I love you too, bambi," Tony hummed, "More than you can imagine." He chuckled, still petting Steve's hair. "You've turned me into such a sap, y'know."
The blond tilted his head in slight confusion at the comment.
"Feels too good to be true," he mumbled.
Testing his luck, Tony slipped a fourth finger inside Steve, watching precome leak from Steve’s cock and pool on the bed.
of what you've done. Always have been, despite our rough times. You've done
"I'll drive," Tony said automatically, grabbing the keys off the hook.
“Strange deals with the occult, and it just so happens that our lives get affected by the occult on a daily basis in our line of work.” Steve explained back with a sigh. “I mean, we have Thor, but I don’t feel this is quite in the Asgardian wheelhouse. So Doctor Strange is our best bet.”
Steve looked at Tony carefully, wringing his fingers together carefully as he walked back over to the brunet.
He pulled in a shaking breath before speaking again.
Steve let out quietened moans almost completely in time with Tony's movements. As always, Tony never failed to make him feel this good.
"That's right, I wouldn't let them," Tony explained, "But sometimes people take what they want, and that isn't a good thing. Papa tries to protect me from that from ever happening."
"Daadddddyy" Peter whined, patting the seat next to him. "Come eat dinnah!"
"Daddy!" Peter yelled, barreling into the room and jumping on the bed, "Papa's gots donuts downstairs an he said we can't eat till you come downstairs--"
He smiled over at Tony softly, leaning in to kiss Tony's lips sweetly.
Steve walked in not too long after, coming up and kissing Peter's cheek good morning then walking up beside Tony.
"However you'd like to play with me, darling." Steve smirked back with a hum from the touches. "I'd let you know if I was opposed to something. Promise. Just want you to have your fun."
"Mmm, I know you always do, but you are more creative in this field." He mewled happily.
"...Biblical sea monster?" Tony frowned, glancing at the ceiling, "Leviathan."
"He can't help you, you're all mine," Tony grinned, putting Peter up on his hip.
"Well, I don't know how to dance too
"He can start to eat better too, once the Doc gives us the go-ahead," he mused, "No more formula for this one."
"Don't cry, bubba bug. Papa's right here, I promise." Steve soothed, smooching the baby's cheeks and scooping him up once his onesie was buttoned again.
, fine, god."
"I have many ways, and one of them is to sleep on top of you because you are warm," Tony decided, climbing up to do just that, tucking his head under Steve's chin.
He shifted in Steve's lap, tucking his head down into his arm.
"Yeah. Love it, babe. Love it so much," he praised, running his hands along Tony's sides.
He buried himself in Steve's chest, already running his hands up his shirt.
"Great. Everyone has met and no yelling involved." Tony stated, moving towards the two and jostling Steve's shoulder gently. "Hey Steve, why don't you keep DUM-E occupied while I talk to Pepper for a moment, huh?"
Sighing at the cold air, Tony blindly reached for the covers, dragging the heavy blankets up over them.
Steve pulled his head up, looking Tony in the eyes-- Oh God, those gorgeous eyes-- a soft look of hesitance on his face.
"Now we just finish adding the markings." The blond hummed as he scratched on the paper and showed it to Peter for reference.
"Maybe?
"I'm the only one, Steve," Tony deadpanned, putting his cold feet on Steve's calves, "Of
He tilted the bottle ever so slightly, not letting go even when Sammy grabbed at the bottle.
Steve tried to keep a blush from rising to his cheeks, clearing his throat.
"You'll get bigger as you get older, munchkin. You'll hit you a growth spurt near your teens, no doubt." Steve chuckled from Peter's comment, starting to fill another tray. "Could even get taller than Daddy."
"Howdy," he said, swiveling his chair to look up at Steve.
He whistled at the bot, gently petting its crane when it whirred over to the couch.
Tony could
"Oh no, I'm getting out his little doodles, and his baby clothes," Tony giggled, "Oh god, he's going to think we're both
"We could always have more," he mumbled, "If you wanted. And it doesn't have to be a kid, either. We could get--"
"It's okay, munchkin. It happens." Steve smiled scooping the boy up and carrying him to his bedroom. He set Peter in bed, tucking him in with his penguin.
She reached out a hand carefully for a shake, holding Peter in her other arm. "It’s nice to meet you. And your family!". Peggy turned to Steve with a serious look. "We'll all have to sit down and you two tell me how all this happened. As long as I'm not intruding on anything? I know this visit is a surprise one. I apologize."
Bucky rolled his eyes in reply, wiping crumbs off his lips. "Hey. Sarah's recipe is delicious, okay?"
"Pretty much that, yeah. Dating is kind of like finding the mate you want to spend your life with. There is a lot of trial and error with it, and if you feel like they aren't meant to be your mate, then you try and find another and see how it works out." The engineer tried explaining in the best way possible.
"Aim to please, as I said," Tony hummed.
"Baby, I don't know if the marker would be best for those." Steve said softly. "Those lines on his arms are booboos. And Daddy doesn't like a lot of attention to them."
"You lucked out, they cover it," She replied.
"Yeah!" Pete yelled, instantly cheered up.
"I won't get worked up if I know how you're feeling, To-- Seinfeld? Why Seinfeld? Seinfeld is funny, and I don't find this funny." Steve said, Clint shrugging in response.
"We should give Sharon a get well basket." He said softly. "She... Depending on her condition, she may not remember, but to say that we did. And that we thank her."
"Let it drown!" Fury said sternly. "Of all people, you should know the rules of our interaction with humans. There are none whatsoever. I shouldn't remind you of Barnes, should I?"
Shutting off the water, Tony quickly applied salve to his hand and bandaged it up before attempting to work again. His movements were clumsy and his work did more harm than good, at which point he stood from his worktable and padded over to the futon to lay down. Tony tugged a blanket over himself and cradled his hand, allowing himself to dip into that little pit for only just a moment: not enough to burst into tears, but enough to feel sick.
"Hey, you were a baby once too, munchkin. And you were no doubt just as gross." Steve chuckled, holding in a louder laugh as Tony snorted in sleep from Peter wiping his hand on the man's shirt.
Peter clung to Steve's leg, looking at Tony.
"Of course munchkin. Go and grab him." Steve grinned, watching the boy sprint away excitedly.
"But I don't wanna." Steve said with an exaggerated pout. "The bed's comfy and you're warm and-- Jeez, you've made me lazy." He chuckled, nuzzling into his pillow.
"You love a lot of things," Tony snorted, going over to kiss Steve's cheek, "Love you too, cheeseball."
"I'm just trying to snuggle. I dunno what you're talking about, hubby." Steve laughed, wrapping around the man.
"All right. You've earned it, I believe." He hummed, going off to find the lube and coming back to Tony. Steve helped the man stand to get his pants and boxers off, having him kneel again when they were out of the way. "Now, I'm still going to go nice and slow with you, alright?"
like that guy."
Steve jolted his eyes open, quickly turning towards the clock. He had about ten minutes before his shift started.
"Ah dude, no way!" Clint said excitedly. "Ya got me a bow! I've been wanting to learn how to shoot one of these forever." He grinned.
Steve kissed back gladly, soft smile on his lips when they parted. "Now that is a good morning kiss." He hummed, kissing Tony again. "And I agree on the spanking thing. You and me. Unless a really dumb thing."
"Well that's good. Making sure Santa knows you're a good boy, huh?" Steve grinned, smooching the boy. "The assurance is always good to have. You're a very good boy though, Peter. Very good." He snuggled up the boy along with Tony, laying them all back on the bed.
Tony stilled his breath, using his calming techniques before turning to gauge Steve's reaction.
"I'm still sorry, though." Steve said quietly, watching Tony carefully. "I'm sorry that I made you think that was all about what you told me. I just--" he sighed, running a hand through his hair. "You're all I have left. And I don't want to lose you. Not over something like this."
“I take that as a sign of where we should look,” Steve said, running after Dodger and Tony to the elevator to ride down to the workshop.
Peter giggled again, leaving wet kisses over Tony's face until he sat up again, smiling over at Steve.
"No. No no no, I don't. I don't." Steve whined as the touch was gone. "Please.
Steve smiled at that softly, patting Tony's hand back. "All right, Peter. But you behave and keep a good eye on your brother, okay? He is in your guarding hands."
"Yeah. I'll get a realtor set up for us and stuff," Tony hummed, nuzzling Steve's hair, "Go back to sleep, baby."
"What are they?" Steve asked curiously, smirking at the reaction and doing it again. "Are these humans' fins? They don't seem very helpful in swimming, huh?"
Steve smiled warmly at that, leaning up to kiss Tony sweetly and deeply.
"Oh. Well, that’s good she found somebody so fast." Steve blinked, a bit surprised and curious on when Tony had asked Pepper since last night. "Hopefully you'll feel like it helps you a bit." He said quietly. "Thank you for asking me to come along with you."
"It’s okay, we both are," Tony laughed softly, "We just need to get home safely, and then we can tuck Peter in, change Sammy and put him in some comfortable clothes, and just go from there, yeah?"
He could hear Steve beneath him, the soft mewls coming through his 'voice box' from the sensations. The blond moved his hands underneath Tony's shirt as well, slender fingers skittering softly along the sides. As infatuated with Tony's light as he was, Steve knew not to touch it. Everything else as far as he knew was fair game.
"It's easier to kiss you when I don't have to chase you all the way down to the beach." Tony hummed, putting a hand over Steve's. "I hope that's okay with you, by the way? I've been wanting to at least do that for a while now."
"How could I say 'no'?".
"He's willing to help those close to him whenever and wherever they need it without a second thought." Bucky added.
"Pete fell asleep on the couch," He laughed, "So we should probably put him to bed.... Or something."
you."
"I'll get one from the salvage yard. I'm afraid you might rip my dick off if I touch your true love," Tony snorted, pitching his voice higher at the smack, "Oooh, Steeeve!"
He got a hand into Steve's hair, kissing him deeply until he had to pull back to breathe. Steve grinned down at Tony as they pulled away, lips slightly pink from the kiss.
"I'm going to read you 'The Night Before Christmas.' It’s a classic around Christmastime. Sort of a tradition." Steve said softly, grabbing the book and sitting beside the bed.
Peter nodded.
"I am still checking you over, love. Burns can be very serious." Steve insisted, finishing up his plate. "I would've found out eventually. You can wear a shirt forever, Tony."
fucking excuse to go and get angry with Steve--"
"Yeah.... God, Steve, I can't wait," he breathed, "We'll get to bathe him tomorrow, and rock him and do
"Whaaat? I thought we were past the bathing-with-him stage," Tony joked, smooching Steve's temple, "I don't mind, bambi. I won't melt."
that's set me on this path to kill myself! Do I
Peter was startled out of his thoughts by a jump scare and a loud-pitched screech, causing him to scream and fling himself into Steve's lap.
Peter quickly looked over to Steve's paper and let out an excited hum. "Dat's me!"
Steve had turned to get up and ask, but the nurse was already looking at him and giving a nod.
"Hmm, maybe." He hummed. "It really wasn't anything important."
Tony did as he was told, slicking Steve up with his spit before sliding down onto him, trembling.
Steve smiled back, giving Tony a soft shrug.
He saw the object floating down heavily into the water. It was the size and shape of a human. He knew humans couldn't breath underwater like he and his people could, so Steve went swimming up in hopes of saving it before something bad happened. When he grabs onto the "human", it feels different. It was made of a harder material and had a brilliant blue glow coming from the middle of the upper body. And it was extremely heavy.
“That’s impressive.” Steve said with a chuckle of his own.
Someone was going to notice so Steve decided to just avoid the avoidance and show off the work the moment he returned to the tower. Besides, he promised Josh to share this as much as he could in hopes more of his team would make an appearance and get this piece of work done as well.
“What else was I supposed to be?” Steve asked, blinking in surprise.
“And you’re cute! How are you cute?! Who is hot and cute?!”
"I, unfortunately, have to admit this Josh fellow," he sneered, "has talent in how he can paint your body. This looks beautiful on you."
She just sulked.
Time was a bitch.
“I told them as such…they hoped for proof.”
Every few seconds, for a brief blink, would they part for a gasp of air but would soon be back to each other, hungry and desperate.
"Alrighty," Josh grinned and Steve couldn't help but share it back. "Let's get some more ink on you."
“Why not, dear heart?”
, Jarvis. Fuck, the bastard said Hydra.” His eyes moved over the screen as words, newsfeeds, and files popped up. “And not even a week after I found Steve.”
"Such is life."
Another shudder passed through him that had nothing to do with the cold outside.
The shocked look was starting to slowly melt off and something softer taking over, “Usually a few more words are shared. I do know their names.”
“I was attacked. I’ll fill you in on details another day. But I had shrapnel penetrate my chest. I need this,” he tapped the item gently. “To live. Amazing, huh?”
Tony managed to smile and popped his back. “Well then, I seem to have a few hours until he’s done. Time to get to work. The curtains for our show rise tomorrow, after all.”
‘Steve. Steve. Steve.’
“Maybe I just want you to suffer a bit.” She shrugged and her eyes glinted.

“You didn’t
self-torture.”
Now, before we start this is, well, a rather explicit chapter. I won't say it is heavy (at least in comparison to how many others are written) but it for sure needs the rating change I think. So be on the look out for: sex, anal sex, mentions of oral sex, possessiveness, some dubious consent, some dubious action, some hints of sadism and masochism, and Steve seems to love it...so there is that!
To be fair, again, Steve never really thought anyone would be on the list—especially this playboy billionaire Steve knew he hurt something fierce.
Pepper gave him another firm squeeze. “Yes. Yes you can. And it will be brilliant.
Something would have to be done before Steve ever set foot outside the Tower.
can get our booze on, got it?”
“I don’t like that tone, Jarvis.”
“Fuck.” He pressed his elbows on the desk and groaned. “I don’t think I’ve felt quite like this before. I just need Steve."
“Hey, why don’t I get you a chair or something?”
“Promises, promises.” Tony cooed. “What is this anything you’ll give me?”
A small smile grew over Steve’s face, “I appreciate that.”
He took a deep breath and waited for Pepper to step aside and he walked in.
“Hmph.” Tony clung tightly to the man and gave a pitiful glare to the red-head. “I wanted you to keep Steve company--”
Tony knew he was close to crying now.
“What.”
Their breath were getting tighter and louder. The thrusting slightly losing its rhythm, somehow, becoming harder and rougher as the ending drew near. It felt like it was going to be over too soon…but not soon enough. Steve’s vision was murky as he felt hyper-focused on Tony and the pleasure but could not comprehend anything. His mind was shutting down and his skin was prickling with too much intensity and all he could think of was
“I don’t really trust anyone else with it.”
Tony rubbed his head again. “I promised him Red Skull was dead. That he’s a hero.”
.” Tony hissed. “You weren’t even twenty-five when you got out of the ice and I allowed you to take charge because I wanted someone else to hold everything up because I’m a selfish prick.”
“Please,” he whimpered. “
He laughed again. The sound made Steve feel like a meek maiden about to swoon. “Not part of your imagination, little one. Though I have to say, if I were, you have fantastic taste.”
The familiar metallic voice resonated within the office as a holographic screen of the August calendar appeared above his desk. “You have meetings over the next three weeks, however next Thursday you only have one. If you wish I’ll reschedule it to take place in the morning leaving you with better time to work with an attack.”
“Oh something fun and very,” Tony licked his lips hungrily, “rewarding.”
Steve tried not to flinch.
! Please put a baby in me…please…oh GOD, breed me!”
Wanda pulled back and brought her book back up as if to make a wall. “There was talk since over a hundred years ago that a woman in Pennsylvania gave birth to her thirteenth child and it was a devil. Perhaps we have our own devil here.”
"Jarvis, do not make note of that." Natasha interrupted.
“I was actually the first to do this. But from it a lot of medical advancements have been made. Here,” his voice went soft and scratchy as he took Steve’s hand and brought it up to it. “I call it the arc.”
“Bitchy bottom.”
He was instantly blinded by gold and warmth. The moment his eyes landed on the unconscious form everything in his brain shorted-out and his breath was knocked out of him.
“Ah. I was thinking about making him something for dinner.” He shrugged. “Think that’s ok?”
“You don’t want to have sex.” Tony said as if it were the most ridiculous and surprising thing he had ever heard.
"Yeah, Cap, oh. I believe that is my win."
Spirits, those eyes…Tony could them the most glorious color he had ever seen. He had always been more partial to red, gold and black but the blue hue of Steve’s eyes were mesmerizing. And carried so many secrets that he was hungry to unravel.
“I so want to pour this over your expensive shirt.”
“Nat?”
“It was to start a bargaining system. The farmers here do appreciate money but they prefer errands and favors over it.”
“Huh.” Well that had been his main path of thinking. The other was…terribly frightening to truly consider. “You were born human?”
Sleeping on the small bed, his chest slowly rising and falling, Steve looked like Sleeping Beauty. Far more slender and curvy than his comic-counterpart with muscles that, yes, were quite standout, looked more smooth than vein popping burly. The man had more of a gymnast’s body than that of some Viking warrior. Lean, with such a small waist, and broad shoulders that Tony ached to bite.
,” Tony whispered hotly, his breath against Steve’s ear. “I knew you were different the moment I saw your pretty eyes look up at the arc. Most barely see, let alone observe, the world around them. I weakened my glamour only slightly and you sensed it. You could smell and taste and touch my power.”
“Oh, I’ll make sure we’ll both win. But isn’t it fun, being chased?” Tony purred and lounged atop of Steve, his body heavy and firm, as if in retaliation to Steve’s sulky question.
Tony scoffed and crossed his arms over his chest. He failed in hiding his smugness. “Yes.”
“Yeah, yeah, that’s it.” Tony hummed as he dragged himself out slowly only to thrust back in painfully fast. “Take it all, baby. God, you were meant for this. Oh god, I fit so well in you. Fuck, yes.”
“He wishes to make a challenge video, Stark.” Thor said with a cheer in his tone. “He has also informed me that if he eats them all at once the body believes it to be just one cookie.”
“We going to have a romantic moment if our hands graze each other as we go for a cheek?” Natasha asked, quirking a brow at Tony.
“Eventually, we’ll adopt…and before, and after, we sign the papers, I will need to bury myself in you, rut into you like an animal, because I’ll be fulfilling something primal and desperate in me,” he hungrily licked his lips, sweat beading at his neck, “and I’ll be able to blissfully imagine that I put that child in you.”
“Do I look like someone who reaches conclusions without study? Without evidence?”
He grunted and went in for another kiss but felt his body buck a bit and heard his name echoing in the back of his head and he groggily reopened his eyes, finding him in his bedroom at New York, not in California, and he was sprawled on something not a mattress but was very, pleasantly warm.
He had them almost nightly when he was younger and fevers took him. Never quite awake or quite asleep, he’d suffer from hallucinations and noises that felt so real they grained his bones. Had it not been for his mother and her stories to lessen the visions, he would’ve sure gone mad. Or been sent to a sanitarium for relieving of possession. Years of dealing with it helped him mold them from terrors to just gripping nightmares that no longer made him break into screams but huffs of fear and frustration.
Steve rubbed comfortingly at Tony's shoulders before he had gotten up to get the door, getting up as well to head into the kitchen. At the door was Clint and Natasha, coming in and moving straight to Tony for a hug.
"You brat,
"Totally the best idea I've ever had," he muttered.
"Schowwy, Daddy," he mumbled.
"Hey there, Petey Pie!" Pepper giggle, hefting the boy and pressing a lipstick-marked kiss on his cheek. "How you doing cutie? Ready for Christmas soon?"
He whimpered, pushing back into Steve's hand. Steve smacked one of Tony's cheeks, running his hand on the curve of his ass.
"Alright. So, pre-you, I was on a bender. Drugs, alcohol, sex-- drugs was only high school, though. I got outta that
"It doesn't have to be an
"Nose all better?" He teased, juggling the boy on his hip.
"Steve," he whispered, "Get the thermometer, I think I have a temp--"
"Mmm, maybe. I know you'll think of something," Tony teased, sitting up and straddling Steve's waist, "I think you've had a good amount of
Peter was extremely impatient; he tapped the table until Steve handed him his full plate. With a grin, he scarfed down his food, reaching up to grab his flute of sparkling juice. Peter attempted to suck it down, only succeeding in inhaling some of the liquid, sputtering as fizz shot up into his nose.
Tony sighed, rubbing his thumb over Steve's cheek.
"You'll definitely will have to introduce us when we're done, Tony." Nat stated, carrying some boxes in her arms.
"Of course," Tony whispered back, smooching his cheek.
"I suppose it would be, huh?" Steve chuckled with pink-tinted cheeks, hands tugging at Tony's waistband. "I honestly just like letting you know. I like telling you I love you. How wonderful and amazing you are. Always want you to know." He whispered, kissing up Tony's neck as he tugged down on his pants.
Omigosh! Thank you guys for sticking around and reading my fic! I know it was a little slow on posting, but I hope you guys enjoyed it~
Steve sighed, looking at the baby before laying the blanket out on the bed, getting it comfy for Sammy to lay on.
Steve simply shrugged as he continued to cook. "Nothing bad or embarrassing. Promise, babe." He hummed at Tony.
"I suffer from what you'll most likely diagnose as depression, PTSD, or something," Tony continued, "You've probably seen the tape from the 1999 scandal. That tape is very much real, and much worse things went on in the home."
"Dummy?" he asked the brunette.
He leaned down and smooched Steve's forehead, bustling about to pull on boxers and sweats before going to get sheets. The blond smiled softly at the way Tony was worried of him getting sick, not knowing how he would react. He could wind up a worse mother hen than Steve.
"Come on, Peter. Please don't cry. We don't mean this to be mean, okay? It's to keep you well, okay? We all had to do it, baby." He soothed.
"Cool. You pour us cups, I'll keep bambi occupied," Tony hummed, taking the band and kissing Steve's cheek.
TW: reference to self-harm, self worthlessness,
He winked and stepped back to tend to Sammy, crouching down to kiss his chubby cheek. Sammy squeaked happily at the kiss on his cheek while Steve's cheeks gained a slight pink dusting.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony grumbled childishly, still pouting, "Whatever." He barely suppressed the smile on his lips, huffing with a tiny 'hmph'.
"Not yet," Tony tsked, leaning down to kiss Steve's chest, "Sunset first. I want to make love to you under the stars. Like I promised all those years ago."
"Ah, ah--fuck--" Tony pushed back into Steve, back arching as he hit his sweet spot. "Steve, Steve, God, yes, right there, please," he begged, mewling loudly.
Steve moaned with Tony clenching around him, helping the other ride out his pleasure and enjoy his noise.
' The AI responded smoothly into the room. '
He let out a loud moan of Tony's name in pleasure as he fell over the edge, coming hard in between him and his husband as he trucked through his orgasm. Feeling Steve clench around him was enough to shoot Tony over, burying himself to the hilt before coming deep inside Steve. He drew a ragged breath and slowly pulled out, somehow managing to help Steve lay day before curling up to his side.
"It's just toys and stuff. Clint has a knack for sewing, apparently," Bucky mused, starting to unpack the desk/bed, "You start with the bed frame, and I'll do the desk? Then we can put the supports on and attach the bed."
Tony grumbled profanity to himself, unable to help the laugh in his throat. "The universe could not have picked a better person for me to fall in love with, y'know?"
Steve noised gently at the touches in the front and a little more at the swats in the back end. He was so unsure about this all beforehand, but Tony was actually rather gentle about it all, considering.
Steve nodded. "Yeah. I'll take you to your room for a nap. Then I'll talk to Daddy about his sailor mouth." He explained, scooping the boy up and heading upstairs.
"Why?" He asked, letting himself relax.
"I think--" He hefted Peter up to his chest, putting his hands under his backside to steady him. "--that it's an excellent idea."
"Yes, but I've not decided how yet," Tony murmured, trying to keep himself from getting too excited, "Usually I would suspend students for being such naughty children, but I can make an exception for you, if you would agree to a different punishment, on my terms."
Steve bucked his hips up into Tony's hand, his breathing becoming more broken up and moans of Tony's name escaping his lips. He lasted a few more pumps until he came softly in Tony's hand.
to. I dunno, it's dumb, don't listen to me," Tony muttered, still staring at the floor, "I'm gonna go put on real pants, be right back."
"Oh my god. Do
"Ewww," he groaned, wiping away the kiss, "Daddy, noooo!"
"Even though it is at my expense, I am glad to see the smile too." Steve grinned softly.
He tilted his head slightly at Tony's look.
"Whatever you need to do, hon. And I'm sure Dummy misses being played with. The little joker might be able to lighten things up a bit." Steve answered with a slightly sad smile. "We could use a good chuckle."
Steve hummed happily as took a bite of the chicken on his plate.
With a stretch, he checked all his messages from the others and headed downstairs with a yawn, seeing both Tony and Peter in the kitchen.
Steve's head lolled back, moaning as Tony thrusted into him and hit his sweet spot over and over. He came with a shaky sigh, eyes closed and a blissful expression set on his face. Tony groaned when he felt Steve clench around him, only managing a few more thrusts before coming, bent over Steve with stars dancing in his eyes.
"Shhhh, hey baby boy, it’s okay. Papa will take care of ya." He soothed as he entered the room. Steve picked up the baby and bounced him gently to calm him down enough to get him to the changing table.
He kissed Peter's forehead, not surprised that the boy scrambled away at the first chance he got. With that, Tony cupped his bowl of soup, stirring it.
Steve took a deep breath as he felt the emotions Tony kept blocked for so long. All coming wave after wave, feelings of regret, shame, and any negative feelings he could think of. His hands tightened softly around Tony's, running his thumbs along the back of his husband's hands.
, Tony," Bruce replied, catching Pepper's intent with a smile, "We're all just really happy that you found Steve."
The blond looked at the photo options the man brought to him, nodding towards the one Tony had found in agreement.
"I don't plan, I improvise," Tony laughed, smooching Steve's chest, "All I know is you have the stamina of a racehorse, and I wanna see how many times you can go before you collapse." He grinned cheekily up at Steve, smooching his jaw.
"Well, I like it." Steve whispered, laying his head against Tony's gently. "Shows a softer side of you, and I like it." He hummed sweetly, watching the movie play.
Tony smiled and picked Peter up, smooching his cheek.
"I'm just saying she'd kick your ass if she heard you calling anyone, especially yourself, a slut or whore." He said, shuddering a bit. "I don't even like it coming out of my mouth."
-Steve
"Yeah baby," Tony murmured, leaning over to help clean Peter's hands, "Do you need to go potty first? I'll take you, if you do."
Peter giggled and nodded, a cheeky grin on his face.
"You should dance with me." He smiled warmly.
?" Clint spoke, "You had a fu--
“Tony, calm down. He’s-- He’s just got his own things to handle first. I get that.” Steve tried to reassure, trying to keep the disappointment out of his voice. “We’ll just have to wait and be patient, and try to manage until he gets back to this dimension. Not much else we can do.”
"Y'tired?" Steve reiterated, petting the boy's hair. "You want me to find a place we can sit so you can take a little nap?"
gotta take care'a da house," Peter sighed.
"If you need anything while you're... going through this, please call us," Tony offered up, "I'd like to help in any way I can, even if its booting some of the medical bills--"
. We'll work from home," Tony snorted, "I would build my lab in the basement, expand it a little. Fix up an art room for you to face the hills."
He knocked on the door after realizing he had just been standing outside of it for a good minute or so. Shortly after, he was greeted with a familiar face wearing a large grin.
"You are just so eager. You enjoy getting punished, boy?" Steve hummed, going to grab the lube from the bedside table. He plucked a pillow and moved it to place under Tony's hips.
"Ah, man..." Steve panted, nuzzling into Tony's skin as he fell from his high. "Love you." He whispered softly. "Love you, love you,
"Such a naughty boy, Steve," Tony murmured, scissoring him open, "Fuckin' your boyfriend here--" He slipped a third finger in, leaning down to bite on Steve's hip.
"All right. Wait right here and I'll go hide it, okay?" He explained, leaving the room to find a place only he'd know and Peter couldn't get to.
He tugged Steve down, hungrily capturing his lips.
Bucky nodded, handing Clint the cookie tray.
"We should have them do the list for Doctor Rhodes while they're here," he mumbled, "Get that over with."
Sharon chuckled quietly at that, laying back a bit more in the bed.
"I'd believe it." Steve chuckled. "Every kid feels awkward about that.
The blond looked back nervously, looking away from Tony.
Steve nodded, walking to Bucky with a grin. "After this."
"Hey pup, dress yourself?" Tony grinned.
"Okay." Steve agreed, cleaning up the plates. "Peter and I can play with DUM-E and do some other things while you work. Does that sound okay with you, Peter?"
"I want it to be for you, though." Steve whispered back. "As long as you can be happy, I'm happy. And you deserve so much more happiness, Tony."
"But where are you--?"
, I gots neither."
"You're lucky your eyes do what they do to me." Steve teased, leaning down and kissing Tony. "Sheets are still in the dryer."
to do, maybe," Tony muttered, rolling his eyes, "He gets his attitude from you, baby doll. Not me."
Tony could only shrug in quiet agreement, leaning more onto Steve.
Tony shivered again and gestured back to his scrap metal that he called a suit laying behind him.
"Did I do somethin' wrong? I wasn't tryin' ta make 'im cry..." The boy said softly.
"Good God, I feel like I'm on Seinfeld or some shhhhoot right now," Clint muttered, sitting down heavily on their bed.
He stood and stared at the sharks, but soon gasped horrifically, tugging on Steve's pants.
Sharon laughed at that, nestling back into her hospital bed.
Peter sniffled and rubbed the back of his hand over his nose, bringing out his feet from under him. "I f'got to take m'socks off," he whimpered, lips wobbling for a second before crying again.
"I'll do hickeys on purpose." Steve stated, getting Tony cleaned up. "Is that a fair compromise?"
"So you can't hear my thoughts," Tony murmured, a slight twang of relief in his gut, "Strange. You must be able to hear something else, then."
"Yes, then you can give Daddy his shark. And we can all cuddle with our animals." Steve smiled as they pulled into the garage.
"Do you? I think you can come from me just doing this," Tony hummed back, now scraping his nails, "Think you can do that? Make a mess, babe."
The blond looked up from his sketch and looked over to Peter warmly. "Of course you can, Peter. What's up?"
Steve swooped in and kissed Tony's lips before they were in the living room. "And that talk is a promise, too. Can't believe you made him think I could be a girl. Seriously?"
"Hi," he murmured.
"Um," Steve started, clearing his throat as he tried to get past how much he was like Tony right now.
"We are going to talk about all of this later." Steve continued, with a sigh. "Anyway, Peter and I came down to propose an idea."
"Is-- Is dat wha' Daddy's booboos from?" He asked Steve, curling up to the blond.
Tony couldn't help but watch Steve paint, watching his innate concentration as he painted
“Spidahs," the boy replied proudly, showing Steve the purple and green arachnids on his paper, "I luh's spidahs."
He attacked Steve's neck, shoving him against the bedroom door. Steve grunted as his back hit the door, head automatically tilting upwards to give Tony more space. He was...conflicted? Was that the right word? He wasn't even sure what angry sex was supposed to be like. Guess he was finding out now.
"Fuck. Just-- fuck," Tony groaned, accidentally bucking up into Steve's mouth, "God, y'so good, Stevie--"
He took the baby back to his room, smiling softy at Steve.
The blond keened at the attention, leaning into it and moving to run his hands all along Tony's chest. He tugged Tony closer to him with his legs, wrapping around the man's waist. Tony kissed at Steve's breastbone while working his jeans, having him lift his hips up to get them off.
"I want us--"
"Mmm, pretty red," he murmured.
"I didn't lie to you, munchkin." Steve said softly. "Never would like that. Especially if it earns me a look like what you gave me."
He chuckled softly, checking over things in his cart before adding other essentials, ending up in front of the paddle aisle.
He slowly let go of Sammy's hands and backed away to the other side, holding his hands by his waist. Slowly, Sammy took a tentative step toward Peter, then slowly shuffled over to him, tiredly collapsing in Peter's arms with a sad whine.
"Shh, you," Tony laughed, bouncing Peter on his knee, "I know it’s gross for a seven year old."
"Its a reaction of the male body to sexual arousal." Tony said simply, eyes softening their gaze over Steve from how unsure the other was. "In easier terms, its how our bodies react in the urge to wanting to breed, essentially. And yeah, it does happen to me too, Steve. You're not alone, I promise. Now up on the bed and lay back, get comfortable, and I'll help you."
"It's fine, hush you," Tony murmured, rubbing his thumb over Steve's cheek, "It's okay."
"I'm so glad you're mine now. Officially." Steve grinned, looking to Tony. "All in heart, soul, and writing. And I'm yours all the same and I love it." He chuckled, smooching the top of Tony's head.
Tony buried his face in Steve's back again, waiting for the bike to roar to a stop before pulling back. "Remind me to wear my glasses when we do this," he laughed, running a hand through his hair, "My contacts aren't loving this."
Peter reached a wet hand up to pat at Tony's comfortingly, looking up with those puppy eyes.
He laid the boy on top of his chest and covered them up. "We're going to take a nap together, okay? That might make you feel better when you wake up."
"I suppose so. What about your old man, if you don't mind me asking?".
"Come stand in front of me, please," he asked softly.
The mermaid sighed at the captain.
"Of course we can, munchkin." Steve smiled softly, smooching Peter's cheek. "That one is one of my favorites. JARVIS?"
"Mmm, I'm sooo relaxed," Tony slurred, a dopey grin on his lips, "It warn't
"I really can't wait for the baby, Stevie," he whispered, "We're gonna have two minis running around, and we're gonna have bath time again and story time and we get to go baby clothes shopping--"
Steve snuggled him up closer and more comfortably.
They had been playing for about 5 hours, all joking and occasionally roughhousing along the way. They were getting ready to play a rhythm game when Steve had to go use the restroom. He excused himself momentarily to do so. When he came back, Bruce was playing the guitar part to a fairly quiet and slow song in Guitar Hero. Tony had fallen asleep in his bean-bag.
it," Peter grumbled back.
"You're complaining about cookies?" He asked, "That's okay, I'll eat yours, too."
"God, you worry me. Don't fall over, please." Steve chuckled nervously, following close behind him until Tony made it closer to the bed.
"Hey! Could you build me some super tech-y arrows?" Purple Shirt asked with a hopeful grin, earning a smack from Red. "What? It'd be cool to have exploding ones!"
With a blink of realization, Peter dashed off back to the lab, tugging on Tony's pant leg.
"Wearin' me out in m'old age," Tony laughed weakly, lacing his fingers with Steve's.
confession.
"That onesie is cute on him. Nice choice." He hummed, cooing at Sammy. "We'll let Peter rest, but not too long. He might get bad from us playing with the baby while he's sleeping."
Peter bobbed his head in agreement, sneaking a glance at his Papa before reaching for another donut. Steve snatched the treat away, splitting it in half and taking one half before handing the other back to Peter.
"Your smile is pretty great, too. And your laugh? Makes me want to laugh along with you." He explained, shifting in his seat a bit more comfortably for the both of them.
“I'm a professional," Tony snorted, rolling his eyes, "Nah, just practice."
"Wha--" Steve looked around for something on the ceiling, unable to find where the voice came from.
Tony nodded, padding out to his bedroom, slipping on new boxers and winter PJs, and toweled off his hair before trotting back over to Steve.
Peter giggled softly, grabbing the Santa hat cookie cutter.
"No one's called me doctor since I graduated, please, Mr. is fine," Tony murmured, careful not to jostle Sammy too much as he sunk into a chair by Pete's hospital bed, picking up his tiny hand.
"Correct. One hundred percent on your quiz. Bonus points for your friend there." He smiled, slipping off his pants to reveal a matching, lacy thong with ribbon along the sides.
Tony winked at Steve before wrapping Clint up in a hug, not surprised that Peter had already climbed up into Natasha's arms.
"He's always hungry, like someone else I know," Tony chuckled, sidling up to Steve to give him a kiss, "You told him about the tattoos?"
Steve was surprised and silent for a moment, a warm laugh building up in his throat and coming out heartily.
"I'm gonna take my shower real quick, okay? Think you can dry yourself off?"
"Hello? Oh. Mhm. Okay. Friday? What time…? One it is. And the address…? Okay. Thank you so much. And her name? Sharon?" Tony looked over at Steve, watching the blond's jaw drop. "Okay, thank you so much. Mhm. Bye."
"Would you...please?" He asked softly, nuzzling Tony's cheek. "We could switch off somewhere in-between if you wanted to."
Peter shook his head gently, holding his clothes as they headed towards the bathroom. "I can sit myselfs. Just need help with da rest."
Steve stood silently. He looked as if he was deep in thought. After a minute or so, his voice came out low.
"Good, Ms. Gift Bags, but I was looking for Pepper." Natasha smirked, helping out Pepper with the bags and carrying them to put under the tree.
Once Peter was changed, they tugged the boy up into the bed with them. Steve shushed him gently, taking the little bear in his arms and rocking him gently. He knows Peter was old for lullabies, but Steve thought it might calm his boy down.
," Tony moaned, dissolving into noises. He rolled himself down onto Steve till he felt himself tighten, arching and screaming as he came on his chest.
Steve reaches out to touch the light, but is halted by a hissing sound. The face of the body started to come off, slowly rising and then just breaking off completely. Steve worries at first and grabs the face that had fallen off, only to find that there was an actual face that had been hidden behind it.
They stayed like this until the movie's credits, Tony turning his head to Steve with a curious energy. "So what did you think?"
"Thank you love," He breathed, kissing Steve's forehead.
"The only reason you are still alive is because of this fragile, little light."
"It’s very nice to meet you, Ms. Carter." Steve said with a grin. "We've been excited to meet you since we got the call."
He easily fell asleep amongst his boys, snoring softly into Steve's shoulder. Steve chuckled softly to himself, peering over at Peter.
Steve grinned at her, nodding softly. "That there is Peter, he's our oldest. And our newest addition here is Samuel. He just two days old." He said fondly.
Steve ran a hand carefully over Tony's bare behind with a hum. "Now, how many times have you done that at school? And don't lie to me." He said softly.
"So, you thinking a spanking then rattling some desk drawers? Or were thinking of bouncing some springs?" He asked with a smirk.
"Weeeell," he said "it wasn't exactly fishfolk that I rescued..."
The boy waved weakly as the Doctor moved off, then coughed softly and leaned into Steve.
"I guess we'll get a house with a fireplace then?" He laughed.
"We'll get there. We'll have to decide if we want a ceremony and all that, or just a court order, thankfully New York passed that marriage law a couple years ago so we don't have to go out of state--" Tony hummed, running figures through his head.
"Fury, I--"
"Aunie Peppah!" Peter screamed, recognizing the ginger hair through the window.
Sammy squawked at that, unhappily smacking his tiny hand against Tony's chest, seemingly offended. Steve huffed a quick laugh at the baby's reaction, hugging Peter close.
The man yelled, nothing in particular but the noise was loud. It was probably out of shock of what happened. The armor seemed to peel off of the man's body as he jolted upward. His face was set in a look of confusion and anxiety as he quickly looked around in all directions for... Actually, Steve didn't think the man was even sure what he was looking for. He was breathing frantically and clutching his chest. After a minute the man's chest rose and fell normally, his breathing now steady. He let his hand fall the sand as he tried to relax.
"Leave Steve by offing yourself will doom him and the boys. When a soulmate loses the other to death, the other feels like they are slowly dying too. And it could be
"Good morning."
"I wouldn't make it to both of you if it wasn't kid-friendly, Tony." Steve chuckled, rolling his eyes fondly as he reached to scrub Tony's hair. "It’s something I made. That's the only hint you get. You'll have to wait until Thursday, on Christmas."
Tony didn't answer, in favor of tossing his bloody sweats into the hamper so he could quickly bandage both of his legs, fingers twitching to grab the razor again. He ignored the impulse, opting to grab new sweatpants instead.
"Yes.... Yes," Tony hummed, cracking his knuckles before pulling the body sheet back.
"Mmm, some things are allowed," Tony laughed, blinding reaching for a drawer to pull out a pack of lube, pulling back from Steve only to shed the rest of his clothes.
Tony rolled his eyes.
"No you will not." Steve warned nervously. "Your lips are only for me to smooch and vice versa. Don't do it." He actually whined, curling up protectively behind Tony.
"You've had a handle on the Dad thing for a while. You do good, hon."
Peter giggled, wiggling his feet happily.
"Uh, okay..." He spoke out to no one, turning and deciding to head upstairs to check up on Peter and Sammy.
"I'm sorry Tony, but I actually was on my way to work." Steve said, almost regrettably. "I had only come by real quick to give you your mail. I didn't think I'd meet my...soulmate.".
"I'll work with Peter. He can help me work on making the lunches afterwards." Steve grinned, standing with Peter in his arms.
Tony laughed breathlessly, leaning down to capture Steve's lips.
"Oh, you have your moments, hon. You are super adorable," Steve hummed, moving to sit on his knees in front of Tony. He booped their noses together, a smile on his face.
Tony hovered over the link for a second before clicking it, turning the volume up.
"Well now, didn't know you had the lungs, Rogers," He mused.
"We'll have to talk about it with Peter when he feels better and see what he thinks, though. He is a big part of it, too."
"Yeah. Aunt Natasha braids Uncle Bucky's hair to get it out of the way sometimes," Tony explained, finishing off the braid and tying it up with the band, "That way if you get sick in the night, you won't get it in your hair."
"Baby, come in me, please," Tony whined, nosing at Steve's neck, "Please baby, I love you, I love you--"
"You're such a
All Steve could hear was a sound reminiscent of static.
"Yeah, okay. It's a real tail. And you're a real merman." Tony laughed, stopping as he felt where the crease would be. Would be, being the key word. It was one solid connection; skin to scale with no stop in between.
The boy pouted back before sighing, giving in.
"I still want a non-kid-friendly thing. I got you one, that's for sure," he purred, running his hands up Steve's chest.
He slipped into the driver's seat, waiting for Steve to get settled before backing down the driveway to head the psychiatrist's office. Reaching over, Tony took Steve's hand, rubbing his thumb over his knuckles. Steve looked over to Tony gently, giving Tony's hand a squeeze to try and calm his husband's nerves. He could feel them through his touch.
Tony flushed at that, shyly biting his lip. "Y'think?" He hummed, running his hands down to Steve's belt,
"Look them up. They hop. Very cute," Tony giggled.
Steve rolled his eyes playfully, grabbing the bag of things and heading into the bathroom to try out everything. As he went through the bag and its contents, trying everything on to find that things fit perfect and comfortably, there was a small flutter of nervousness in his stomach. He still had an unsure feeling of Tony liking it or not. He wasn’t one to constantly admire himself in the mirror, but turning his back to the mirror, Steve couldn’t help but flush at how damn attractive he looked in a plaid skirt and white button down. The panties were
The blond sighed, running a hand through his hair before kissing Tony's face thankfully.
"I heard you cursing like a sailor." Steve answered simply, raising an eyebrow back. "Why so mad?"
He yawned, tucking his head to smooch Steve's mark before drifting off.
"Why does Daddy kiss y'so much, Papa?" Peter asked, slightly annoyed, "It's
"Yes, sleep baby. When you wake up, we'll get the boys and stop by the bakery for some donuts for breakfast." Steve hummed, smooching him back and petting his hair.
"I actually have glasses," he admitted, "I wear them when I get super sick, though. I prefer contacts, but I mean--" He shrugged, winking at Steve. "Depends on how often I'll be seeing you in my office."
Steve knew he had a blissful grin on too. “I should not find that endearing. I know it's the sort of thing people normally find creepy, but mostly I'm just smug that the reality is better than
Tony shot him an amused glance out of the corner of his eye. “You are absolutely wicked, you know that, Rogers? I admit, I was fooled at first, Mister Upstanding Citizen, but under those stars and stripes, you have an evil streak a mile wide. Weren't you the one who said-” He mock scowled and shook his plastic fork at Steve. “Evil geezer.”
*A*A*
could carry it? I mean, I get you were poor as a kid-”
JARVIS sounded thoughtful. “I'm sure I couldn't say, Ms Potts, but on a completely unrelated topic, you may be interested to know that Captain Rogers spent all of last night in Mr Stark's bedroom.”
Tony was already shaking his head as Steve started the last set, again a little offset from the others and a little harder, and as soon as the first one landed, he yelped aloud. “No, thank you, no thank you!”
Pepper was a fair bit more worried than she let on. That was some seriously weird behavior from a man who was
Steve resolutely ignored Clint's dramatically-fluttering eyelashes. “Sure, JARVIS, go ahead.”
interested in?”
Tony was actually genuinely embarrassed, and let it show. “Oh, geeze, sorry. It's Monday evening here, I forgot to check where you even are. I'll make this quick, let you get back to sleep.”
Steve moved again, and, God, now he was almost close enough to touch. “Really? Because you seem pretty agitated to me. I kinda think...” And now he was so close Tony could feel his body heat, bare millimeters of air between them, and Tony was sure that Steve could hear his heartbeat, it was pounding so loud in his ears. Steve leaned down, juuuuust a little. “I
Steve could always tell what sort of a day Tony had had, just by the tone of his voice as he came up the stairs. Good days, he would be joking and teasing Bruce, or expounding on some new area of research, or singing songs that were on the radio when Steve was in the ice. (He'd heard plenty of those songs' original versions, too, of course, but in almost every case he preferred Tony's 'cover' of it. Now that he thought about it, that was probably another clue...) Bad days, he would be ranting, sounding off on topics that might or might not have any sort of relation to the reason for his bad mood. But either way, he would come around the corner, and Steve would already be looking over, and their eyes would meet, and Steve could feel his spirits lift, no matter what sort of day he had had.
*A*A*
, I'm so close to popping as it is, just from watching you and listening to you...” Another stroke, this one just a bit faster, a bit rougher. “God, next time, next time I will fuck you so hard...”
“Of course, Ms Potts.”
Tony practically purred. “Aww, Brucie! Checking in so Mom and Dad don't worry! You're adorable!” Bruce was turning a little red, but he was also smiling a little wider, so Steve let it go. “So, Bruce, did you have good science this weekend?”
Steve blinked a couple of times. “Huh. I guess I haven’t looked into any of that. I’ll have to try it out. Do you know if any of them are any good?” He took a couple more hearty bites of his food.
Steve leaned forward. “I know Peter Pan. I saw it on stage when I was a kid.” He chuckled and leaned back again. “Actually, yeah, Clint, you should definitely be the one to tell Thor that story.”
? You're a virgin?”
“OK, then.” Steve got up calmly, going over to his drawers to dig out his own clothes.
be for combat situations.”
Steve gave him a sour look. “My prom was in 1938, and I didn't go because I couldn't get a single gal to agree to go with me. And you are not at all helping my nerves.”
You'll have to pardon me, this is my first story posted to this site, I may have some minor formatting and whatnot issues as I get used to it. I'm glad to see there are already bookmarks and kudos, they make my muse very happy. She's got lots brewing, so stick around.
He came back to himself not only draped over Tony, but still balls-deep in him. He groaned and rolled away, and Tony sucked in a deep breath and let it out in an answering groan. Steve tried half-heartedly to sit up, but when he found he couldn't, he was perfectly happy to just lie there and breathe. (And feel the rise and fall of Tony's ribs under his arm.) Eventually, though, he realized how sticky they both were, and levered himself up and out of the bed, to go in the bathroom and get a washcloth.
Steve's head snapped up. “What? Oh, right, the rest of my packing. Yeah, thanks, JARVIS.” He shut the sketchbook sharply, then stood and pushed all of his materials into the bag, pulling its laces closed. He scooped up the other bags, snagged The Shield, and strode out of the room, not even bothering to look back. He got to the elevator just as it arrived, opening to reveal Tony, carrying not just three paper-and-plastic takeout bags, but a cake box. He grinned and stepped in. “Welcome home, handsome.” The doors closed and he could feel the faintest sensation of movement.
Tony smirked as he leaned against the counter, hands cradling his coffee. “Don't worry, I'm clean. I get tested every six months. Safety first!”
"Where's d'picinik basket, Papa?" He asked.
"That's enough time to catch up a bit on our personal time." Steve sighed, carding his fingers into Tony's hair lovingly. "And we can do whatever you'd want to do."
"I can hear ya smoochin'!" Peter groaned playfully, continuing his coloring. "I can't consuntwate on my pit'ure."
He pulled Steve back in, biting at his collarbones. Steve nearly purred as Tony attacked at his collarbones and neck, running his hands along Tony's chest.
"You--" Tony sighed, playing with Steve's wet collar.
Steve reached up and grabbed Tony's hand away from his cut.
Steve turned to look at Tony curiously. "I'm sure you are contemplating on the why, aren't you Stark?"
"That's my name," Tony grinned, leaning up to kiss at Steve's chest, "So here's what I'm thinkin'. I wanna do more than just blow you--"
It was a shiver of want as Tony took him in, working on him slowly and skillfully. He made a small wordless noise, assuming that was fine since it wasn't a word, biting his bottom lip to keep from it again in case.
"Okay. All right." Steve gasped as he settled in, leaning down to capture Tony's lips in a deep, wet kiss as he started to move his hips with shallow thrusts.
"You're such a romantic," Tony laughed, "We could do front silhouettes and put our soul marks on the black in our favorite colors. Put a big letter in the middle of it with a heart on it."
"Mmm, nope, too soon," Tony chided with a shake of his head, scooting away, "Unless, of course, you're needy
"Or else?" They chorused, varying expressions of glee and fear on their faces.
Tony slept late into the morning, still curled into Steve's warmth. He sighed happily, nudging Steve's chest with his nose.
"Yes honey," Tony replied, knowing there was no point in lying to a brilliant child, "I bet if you ask nicely, they'll stay here so you can play in your new room. Uncle Bruce'll help you with you chemistry set, yeah?"
Tony grinned cheekily, going off to make coffee.
He felt himself harden at the thought, scooting back to tug off Steve's boxers.
"O'course," Peter replied, popping the blueberry in his mouth, "I thou' he knew?"
"There's mistletoe over our bed, sweetheart," Tony murmured, trailing his fingers up underneath Steve's shirt again, "I'd be more than happy to drag you away, if you want."
Steve hummed happily in response. "Yeah, he is. He'll be a great older brother. He can teach the baby so many things about what being a kid is all about."
"Yeah, bambi, another addition to our little family," Tony tried to explain gently.
Steve felt his heartstrings tug just a little hearing Peter starting to cry, sitting up with a stretch before hugging the boy close.
Steve nodded carefully, taking a deep breath. "I know. I just-- I'm excited." He said with a grin, kissing Tony back before going off to find grab the blanket they had gotten made for the baby.
"So far, I know you're persistent.".
"Don't what?" Tony grinned, getting comfy to continue his spiel.
"I-- it's going to be very uncomfortable to explain," Tony muttered, "Can we at least put clothes on for this? Cause-- it's gonna take a while, and it’s cold."
"I know you are gonna be a good boy. We'll miss you, but we'll be back before you know it, okay? Love you, munchkin."
"Look Cap, thanks for coming and helping and everything, but that's something I really do NOT want to talk about right now. I just... want to be left alone for a while, alright?".
"Well, shit," Tony muttered.
With that, he grinned and skipped off towards his room.
"Time out? What did he do that you would need to call us?"
. There were those damn puppy dog eyes again. He still hasn't figured out how to say no to them, and he is honestly sure he never will be able to. Closing his eyes with a resigned sigh, Tony nodded, the blond beaming in reply.
He grinned, swooping down to kiss Steve's cheek while prepping himself, easily slipping two fingers in off the bat.
"Hurry up and sketch so I can kiss you, dumbass," he muttered.
"But just looking at you, you seem to be the exact opposite of that." Bruce continued. "You're alright by me.".
until we get a date for the trip, but it'll be cold. Ish. Cold for us non-muscular beings," Tony snorted.
?" Tony clicked his tongue, moving his hand down to pat Steve's buttocks none too lightly, "We'll see."
Tony nodded, tugging his shirt off and tossing it aside.
"I might be able to let it slide..." Steve said with a dramatic sigh, eyes raking over Tony. "But you will have to do as I say until you've earned your bail. Understood?"
Sammy shoved his fist in his mouth with a happy gargle, looking up at the two of them.
"I'll hang out with you, little bit. At least until your nap time. Then I will be all bubby's for a while." Steve decided, let Peter wait it out and hopefully act simple.
"I--Flash only bullies me b'tween classes an' at recess, an' if it’s in class it's spitballs an' stuff," Peter hiccupped, "The teacha' doesn' know."
And comments are always appreciated, by the by!
"That’s gonna hurt tomorrow." Steve sighed, leaning up to gently kiss the welt. "Hopefully, our vacation will go better without any other mishaps."
"No touching. I wanna try to get you to come without your cock even being touched." He explained, bringing his fingers up to Tony's lips. "Get these nice and wet, all right? As slick as you can."
Tony paled at that, thinking he would get whiplash from how fast his neck turned.
"I love you too, Steven," Tony breathed, tucking his head under Steve's chin, "As cheesy as it is, I love you to the moon and back. Which is over a hundred thousand miles of string. Probably more. I love you more times than the speed of light, than the size of Andromeda, than any calculation I could do to give you an infinitely large number--"
"M'your tight lil' virgin," Tony breathed, having to squeeze the base of his cock to keep himself from coming, "Y'takin' m'flower, Sir--"
Tony stared at the piece of paper, reading it over and over again in his mind. That's why Steve always kept the pieces hidden. They were meant to be a gift for him. Tony felt his eyes wanting to water, but he didn't let them. After Tony yelled at Steve for something that wasn't his fault and after Tony avoided him for over a week, Steve still gave the project to him as a gift.
Tony sighed dramatically and flicked his hair back, clicking his tongue.
"Mmm-mm. No quitting," Tony teased, sloppily smooching all over the boy's face.
I get to witness a first--"
“That she is,” Steve nodded, scratching his chin in thought, “Did you go and check your workshop?”
"My name is Erin Wyatt. I am the instructor here for the art department. You must be Tony. I have heard quite a bit about you lately.".
He shook his head, turning back to Steve to kiss him again, pouring warmth and love into it.
Steve leaned into the touch, stripping his shirt soon after.
a blowjob? I thought I was doing pretty damn awesome, thank you." He teased.
"Shh. And I meant
He grinned, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck.
"Jay, tell Steve and the boys I'll get it," Tony called, stripping off his mask and covering his arms with metalworking gloves before getting up.
Tony sauntered back into the room with his glasses perched on his face, bounding over to Steve.
Being the cranky child he was, Peter rolled his eyes, scooting off the couch to sit in front of the TV with no reply. Steve sighed softly, glancing at Tony before going to sit beside Peter.
"Tonyyyyyyy," Steve called back, muffled against skin.
TW: more talk of divorce
Steve blinked at him for a moment. "I think we should go. I mean, that was the original plan. Besides, it’s not that late in the evening. So we'd have time for that and whatever little 'show' you have planned for when we are back home." He hummed, following Tony and opening the restaurant door for him.
"Yep. Good luck," Tony chuckled, kissing Steve's cheek in return, "Make sure he brushes his teeth."
"I know you do, baby. I think you really like touch," Tony chuckled, "I'd love to play around with that sometime. I bet you've got little spots all over you that'd make you squirm, hm?"  He smooched Steve's breastbone, tucking his head under his chin.
"Fank you, Daddy." Peter chimed, getting up for a moment to hug Tony then going back to his drawing. "Come dwa'h too, Daddy!".
"That it is, baby," Tony murmured, leaving Steve's arms to pop the cookies in the oven, "Do you wanna cuddle while the cookies bake and cool?"
"How will we work that, by the way? I can only help teach him so much. You're the one more qualified, but you are the one working."
"Can't pop these questions, Steve. I need time," Tony whined, putting his hands back on his face, "Oh my god, I'm gonna die. My face is burning."
"Steve. I will buy you a baby doll if you cannot wait," Tony tried to keep a serious look on his face, only to dissolve into giggles. "Okay, okay, maybe not, but still. You'll get all that baby time in in the classes we're gonna take. Right?"
Steve ran his hand along Tony's back softly. "If you gotta come in, then I'll come with you. Help you out as much as I can." He said kissing Tony's temple.
"You'll have to let me apologize to you later then~".
"M'fine," Peter garbled through a mouth of cereal, taking a moment to chew before swallowing, "Can I take my Batman pajamas?"
"You got sick lots, too?" Peter said at a whisper, leaning lightly against Tony. Staying leaned up was getting tiring. "Does Papa get sick?"
"Always feels good w'you, babe," Tony breathed, reaching between them to slowly jerk Steve off.
Tony grumbled, but didn't disagree, opting to plop a pillow in Steve's lap and lay down.
“Captain Rogers, Sergeant Barnes and Mr. Wilson have expressed their concerns with your recent behavior and health, as well as your absence from your regularly scheduled runs. They wish to speak with you as soon as is possible.”
He quickly put the new band-aid over Peter's IV mark, scooping the boy up and kissing his cheek before going to grab Wade.
Tony did a small salute and spoke with a dramatic announcer voice.
"Yeah, he must’ve misread the numbers on our mail," Tony shrugged, squeezing Steve's hand, "He gave your Papa my Mechanics Monthly, and ended up giving me the rest of my life in the process."
"Look, I've used that one on your Papa more times than I care to count. You have three seconds to open this door. Three--"
"There were no footsteps around, despite it raining two hours prior," he murmured, "Surely his shoes would have been wet and left marks!”
"Steeeve," Tony whined, sadly dropping his legs to the floor.
. Well, Steve knew what they were using now, for sure. He croaked a small moan as it was switched on, quickly shutting his mouth afterwards and bowing his head to keep from making any noises. Tony smacked Steve's right cheek once, smirking when he hitched forward.
Immediately, he was drawn to the huge tank, staring open-mouth at the hammerhead swimming around.
It was a couple hours later when there was a knock on the door, stirring Steve awake.
“Daddy?"
"I love you," Tony breathed, arching his back slightly to give Steve a better angle, "Love you so much." He moaned softly, already feeling the heat buildup in his stomach.
"Visting ends in a half hour," he told them, closing the door on his way out.
"I see. And a peculiar case it seems to be." Natalia hummed, leading them down a bit to a body covered on a table. "Virginia notified me that this is who you wished to observe? A Mr. Wade Wilson."
"Today has been enough work on my nerves for the month, I swear."
He grinned back at Tony, turning to look at the cabin. "The place looks nice on the outside. Is it even better on the inside?" He asked playfully.
"If tha's the 'sponse I'm gettin', I'm a fuckin' whore," He muttered under his breath, a tint on his cheeks, "Remin' me-- to talk 'bout that later--"
"Yeah," he mumbled quietly, looking at the room fondly, "It's the right size for a crib and a diaper station, and it has a cute little closet--"
"Nah, sleep," he teased, smooching the six year old.
"Yeah, Tony? What is it?" He asked curiously.
"Peter, I can't have a baby. Only ladies can have babies." He explained softly. "I just haven't been able to work out as much as I used to, so I guess I'm getting a little... chubby."
"Mmm. I have an idea why. Close up the body, Doctor. We're all done," Tony hummed, stripping off his gloves and disposing of them, "I'll be waiting in the carriage."
He chanted Tony's name as he fell, body wound tight but patient to allow Tony to get to his own orgasm as Steve rode his out. Tony sealed his lips over Steve's, trying his damned hardest to silence him. He breathed heavily, and feeling Steve tighten around him, fell over the edge, burying himself to the hilt.
"No y'not," Peter answered stubbornly, pushing his finished plate away.
"I love spoiling you," Tony murmured, closing his eyes while curling into Steve's warmth, "It's kinda spoiling me by spoiling you, but, y'know." Tony smirked, laughing into his chest.
"Fu--" Steve groaned, biting his lip as he bucked into Tony's hand.
When it beeped, he frowned at the temperature.
"'m sorry..." He whispered, burying his face into Tony's leg.
Natasha flicked him a look before opening the first of her gifts, smiling fondly at the nesting dolls wrapped in tissue paper.
,” he wheezed.
Peter glanced between the two of them, scooting to the middle in case of an argument.
"Peter, I know you're excited, but you're not allowed to break Daddy's ears." He laughed, taking the boy in his arms instead. "How about we let Daddy get his hearing back and you and I can start on dinner, huh?"
"I'm sorry. I know I can't carry a tune in a bucket, but I enjoy it." Steve said with a wet chuckle. "It’s what Ma would sing to me, so I thought it might help. Plus I thought it'd put Sammy back to sleep."
"You don't want Peter to go first?" Pepper asked softly, picking gently at tissue paper on one of her bags.
"Wight!" The boy crowed, eagerly sipping at his juice as he snuggled into Steve.
“Damn, I figured they’d know something was up.” Steve grumbled behind a bite of pancake, setting his plate down for the moment. “Tell them, Clint, and Natasha to meet in Banner’s lab. We’ll inform them on the situation.”
The blush didn't go unnoticed, a curious look on Steve's face.
He wasn't surprised to hear a quiet yawn from Peter; Tony gently removed the chemistry book from the hammock and set it on the floor, giving them a little more room.
"Nine letter word for a biblical sea monster." Steve stated, trying to keep from looking at Tony. "Why do you do that?"
"Do you mind if we--like, we'll get there, but I wanna enjoy you," Tony murmured, leaning down.
He shrugged. "It's okay with me."
“U? U?! Where are you, baby?!”
"Hey you," he grinned, kissing Steve's cheek.
"About thirty minutes," Tony hummed back, picking up his empty plate to put in the dishwasher, "It's just outside the city. It's really gorgeous."
"Ya don't gotta stop..." Peter mumbled, nuzzling into Tony's shirt. "Jus' not as much, pwease..."
"See? Sammy thinks s'gwoss, too!" Peter stated, earning another laugh from Steve.
"Pleasure doing business." Bruce grinned, accepting the check. "Once again, you two have fun now. Tony. Steve."
Steve sat and thought about it for a while. He really did like Tony, a LOT. His quirks, his attitude, his smile. Man, how he liked seeing Tony with a genuine smile on his face. It always warmed Steve from the inside out. He knew what he needed to do.
Steve hummed in understanding. "That's how I feel about you, but I can at least say some of the things." He explained at almost a whisper.
"No, no, he's not actually bald," Tony laughed, "His hair is colored in such a way that he
He reached inwards to take one of Tony's hands in his, kissing at his knuckles gently.
“Yeah, yeah it will be," Tony mumbled, choking down the lump in his throat, "God, you've made me all sentimental, Rogers."
"I do everything I can to make you happy and warm and comfy," Tony murmured, leaning against Steve's chest, "I love you, y'know."
"Take--
"Hey.". Bruce greeted back. He looked around the room and raised an eyebrow. "No Steve today?".
He smiled and snuggled into Steve's chest, sighing happily.
He sighed happily, nosing at Steve's shoulder. Steve hummed sweetly as Tony watched through the window inside, glad the man was reminded of something happy and nostalgic.
"I love your blush," Tony blurted, unable to take his eyes off Steve's face, "I--ah, yes. Red. Deep red." He nodded quickly, fingers flying through the racks till he found a small, lacy number, fondly picking at the bows and garters before putting it in the cart with matching thigh-highs.
"Well, the talk about a baby and me apparently getting bigger have nothing to do with each other, Peter." He explained gently. "I can't have a baby. Boys can't do that."
"Yeah." Peter hummed, getting out of bed and reaching up for Tony to pick him up. "Pleeeeeeease?" He asked with puppy eyes.
Peter opened the door, immediately going over to climb up into the bed, settling on Tony's chest.
He pressed light kisses all over Steve's chest, moving slowly towards his navel. Tony nosed at the dark gold hairs below it, kissing toward his inner thighs.
"Boo. No fun. It’s our wedding night. That, like, practically calls for me to be lovey." He stated. "You never did explain what I was doing since you said you weren't going again yet."
"Steve's my friend. I think he knows that I like him. It kind of comes with the whole thing of being friends with someone.".
Tony laughed again at the sensation, yanking away and trying to keep a cool composure.
Steve let out a deep sigh, nuzzling Tony back somberly.
"My boyfriend says I look good in them and I feel good in them. I feel I should be mostly comfortable in order to focus well enough on my studies, Sir."
"Steve seemed like such a good boy. And you make it sound like he's the one stirring this up. How do you even manage to get in the principal's office to do that without him knowing?"
time before we're old, baby. And even then, we're not going anywhere." Steve assured softly, joining the hug to make a group hug. "Don't you worry your sweet little head, alright? We'll be here forever."
"Honey, please don't cry," Tony mumbled, "It's okay--"
He pinched the bridge of his nose with a sigh, sliding down in his chair.
Taking off his headphones, Tony stripped off his gloves and picked the squirt up, setting him on his hip.
"We'll get a moving van to bring our stuff," he grinned, "And then we can christen the house. Always wanted to be fucked on a granite table top."
Steve huffed a breath of air for a moment and nodded back at Tony.
"I know, munchkin. Daddy and I are excited to see him, too. We'll have to try and be patient, though." He explained, helping Tony with their bags as they headed inside.
"Daddy, I wanna go see Sammy," Peter whined, "Why can't we go in??"
Just stop following me, Tony thought to himself. Stop following before something happens.
"Wall sex. We haven't had wall sex. That and the couch has paint all over it, if you remember correctly."
"Yeah--yes. Yes. A-ah..." Steve noised, rocking back onto the plug as Tony twisted. "It's all a lot though--
"Then let's try not to teach him the words, all right love?" He smiled softly.
"Well, it's--"
He smiled softly, nuzzling at Steve's chest.
"Don't make me look silly, Daddy! What would Auntie Peppah think?" Peter giggled, closing his eyes tight as his head was tilted back at the water.
"Just be careful, okay?"
Sighing happily, Tony fell asleep against Steve's warm body, a tiny smile on his lips. Steve hummed at the kisses, letting his eyes shut as Tony settled. Once they were shut, he was out like a light, emotional exhaustion of the past two days taking him under.
"Ewwwwww!" Peter shrieked with giggles, wriggling around back on the couch and covering his face with the blanket.
"At least you're responsible enough to let me know. Thank you, munchkin." Steve praised, taking Sammy and a spit bib to burp the boy.
