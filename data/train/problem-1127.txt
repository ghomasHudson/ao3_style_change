But the man who walks down the front stoop isn’t Sherlock. Quite the opposite, in fact.
They’ve already paid. John hooks his bag over his shoulder and then picks up his daughter, perching her on his side. Before they can leave, Sherlock purses his lips and skirts around the table to gently transfer Rosie to his own arms. John lets her go willingly. Neither men move, and Sherlock shuffles from foot to foot.
John stifles a sound that’s half-groan, half-laugh, and leans over to help Rosie with her breakfast.
Before John could start up with an interrogation of his own, considering that he personally felt like he was entitled to know about the man that tried to kill him, Lestrade stopped them both on the landing with a hand centimeters from John’s chest.
John is about to object, but Sherlock cuts him off. “Down down down,” he says evenly, prompting John to follow his lead with the pick. Sherlock himself isn’t touching the strings, instead only miming along with his words. “
“Why, yes. A month from now is the designated departure time for the DSE Intrepid, and training takes place between now and then. Well, it officially began yesterday, but I’m sure you’ll catch up just fine.”
to smile.
They walked in silence, aimlessly on John’s end, and when Sherlock finally spoke it was muttered and strangely sheepish.
“Show me,” John said softly. “Please.”
For the second time that day John found himself hitting the ground, though now with a warm, hard arm pressed firmly against his neck. Those quicksilver eyes were even more marvelling up close.
hear, thank you very much), it’s in the most unlikely of arms.
“Transport,” Sherlock commented offhandedly, as if John would be able to decipher his meaning from just that. Despite the man’s obvious fatigue, there was a lingering glimmer in his eyes that John recognized from days before. “Unimportant. I’ve finished readying the equipment and base data for our trip outside, and the planning is mostly complete. I’ve talked to Molly; unfortunately, she isn’t too keen on the idea and I didn’t want to push her past whatever limit she supposedly has. Luckily, though, I have a ‘plan B’, as they say.”
Though, to be completely fair, John builds up this ‘popular belief’ himself with his constant denials over anything that strays away from strictly heterosexual; Sherlock, at least, was correct about that. Ella Thompson said that this is due to internalized shame from a homophobic household, after he had disclosed the absolute chaos from Harry’s coming out. Ella also said that she wanted him to shed out of his comfort zone, to release the preconceived notions his father had thrust upon him and, oh, to try going to a place with a distinct homosexual setting to see if any of it appealed to him.
"Less than thirty seconds, by my count."
In London, for every two weeks of overcast, there was one sunny day. That, in itself, resulted in a lot of rain. Devon county was no exception. There was no warmth to the sunlight, only a dim glow that the clouds diffused. John didn’t hear any thunder, but his shoulder was slightly throbbing from the energy of the air.
ME: What? Who told you that? Was that programmed into your hard-drive?
Well, he didn’t, that was for sure. He glanced up across the facility and met Sherlock’s eyes, just beside a weight rack and utterly unreadable. When they met each other’s gaze, neither looked away. In the lighting, his cheekbones were severely defined, and at this distance it was almost as if he was looking at a skull.
“Thank you, Captain, but I can take it from here,” Mycroft said, strolling into the center of the argument. He had that same umbrella hooked around his wrist, which John realized seemed rather odd in a world where rain was no longer an issue. Especially not underneath the dome. The AI was as smooth and just as unpredictable as a snake to John, but the moment he arrived, Lestrade seemed to immediately calm down, if just a bit.
“I believe I can prove that the virus X-TE2 doesn’t exist.”
A pause, and then his charmingly vulnerable features went harsh again, upper lip curling as if to snarl. Without a look back, he braced an iron arm around John’s shoulders and bodily dragged him through the open gate. Parked haphazardly in front of Highgate’s entrance was the jeep, still running, and John was practically stuffed into the passenger seat as if his struggles were as insignificant as a child’s. Sherlock was in the driver’s seat in a flash and the car fishtailed out onto the main road. Horns blared behind them.
The cabbie made a sound of annoyance, so Sherlock swung the car door closed and led John away with a hand to his back, closer to the building up ahead with police cars and yellow tape and officers swarming in matching uniforms. Sherlock kept his eyes on it with unmasked interest, like he was barely restraining himself from sprinting.
The hips nestled closer, so close that John could hear the baritone vibration when Sherlock spoke. “It’s… imperative that you stay still. Just like this.”
Molly had just come by to take Rosie for one of their Sunday morning strolls through the park, and Sherlock had offered to help Rosie into the pram. Their friendship, though broken (understandably) from the events months ago, came back rather easily in the aftermath. Rosie being the peace offering between them definitely helped, and neither him nor his daughter minded.
“He’ll be there in 15 minutes,” John says, batting Sherlock’s hands away when he tries to grab back the phone. “Yeah, alright, Greg. Yes. I- no, I’m on babysitting duty. Right. Thanks, he’ll see you soon.” He hangs up and tosses the phone to the other man’s chest. “I’m fine, Sherlock. I don’t need to go on
Molly opened and closed her mouth, schooling herself into something more professional with a lasting glance towards John. But he had slid out without a word, Baker street in mind and curses just on the tip of his tongue.
“Your friend. Sherlock Holmes. He knows about the files.”
The snow makes it look lighter outside than it is, but John closes his eyes anyway, hoping sleep envelopes him eventually. Later in the morning, they’ll talk it out, they always do, and they’ll be back to normal. Maybe something more, if Sherlock still wants it. Maybe not.
An approving sound. “Well, in that case,” Sherlock says, “I’ll go and get ready.”
Sherlock’s voice is bitter, and he sets his guitar behind him to prop precariously on the desk’s clutter. “I didn’t realize I was so frightening.”
Day fades, lovers twine, and in the morning, lips press to bare skin as warm as sunlight. Eyes open. And somewhere, far away, a clock is chiming midnight and Sherlock makes good of their New Year’s promise every day of the year.
The food arrived, which gave John a chance to mull over the words. Sherlock popped one of the crimson pills, and John began on the chips. He chose his next sentence carefully. “Well, maybe I’m not that easy to deduce.”
“Do you want me to tell you the answer, or would you like to work it out for yourself?”
“Have to be invited into a house?”
ME: I have to go. I have babysitting duty today, and I’ve planned an exciting outing to the Hunterian Museum in Holborn. Apparently there’s a fascinating exhibit on pathological specimens that I’m sure a thirteen-month-old would benefit greatly from.
John picked at his jacket sleeve, face carefully blank. “Finsbury Park.”
So, where would Sherlock go from here? Desperately awaiting for the next moment John got drunk enough to forget his standards? Probably. It was awful and depressing and frankly appalling, but it was the truth. He didn’t have the restraint to refuse John, and he didn’t have the courage to confess these revelations to him.
John carefully ignored the last part. “He’s a teacher, then?”
RJ shook his head quickly. “It connects to your ID whenever it’s there. It’s you. It’s in the most classified of files, and those are the most confusing ones. I was following you because I thought you’d have answers.”
“No sir,” John corrected. “So, please, instead of questioning my methods, how about you work with me on finding the person currently minus one finger.”
That look was familiar. Achingly familiar. Ever since that first time, nearly a year ago, something had awoken beneath Sherlock’s skin that was difficult to ignore. He felt it come and go in low intensities, a rush through his blood whenever John handled his gun or cooked them dinner, the juxtaposition between both facets of the man utterly riveting. At least once a month, he would feel compelled to take ‘matters into his own hands’, as it were. Once a week, he would find himself lingering on John’s physicality for a moment too long, when before he didn’t notice the way that his forearms flexed, or how his jaw clenched, or how his arse looked in his favorite pair of third-date jeans.
Sherlock Holmes underneath running water was always a sight to behold, but without clothes on it should be bloody illegal. His shoulders were broad and every inch of his body was sculpted as if drawn on paper, legs up to his chin and muscles beautifully defined. His wet curls fell charmingly against his face. John felt so unbelievably lucky to have those quicksilver eyes openly loving on him, the detective’s full attention somehow caught on John’s average form.
Instead of pulling him closer, John’s face twisted and he pushed him back, hand knotted in the fabric as he manhandled Sherlock against the front door. He didn’t kiss him, only left him there while he took a step back and started to undress.
But that’s not what John was distracted by.
With a scream, she collapsed and began convulsing in the grass, and John could only watch in fright, cold dread dripping into his stomach like syrup. He
Dimmock seemed confused, like he couldn’t tear his eyes from the window. Sherlock was staring straight up and around, rubbing the back of his neck as he attempted to find a usable path. “I don’t think so,” the head engineer said. “We’re already preparing the engines, so it’s too dangerous to get someone to bring the stairs back… We can’t stop at this point.”
come from your mouth.”
“Ever,” Sherlock echoed.
John stared at Sherlock’s face as he prodded John’s abdomen, memorizing the layout and symmetry of the man’s features. The long, elegant neck that curved into shoulders that were surprisingly broad, considering the slenderness of the rest of his body. The oddly invigorating mixture of feminine and masculine – lithe dancer’s fingers and milky skin, met toe-to-toe with a prominent brow and a jawline that could cut glass, running parallel with cheekbones that could do the same. His scent, his voice, his-
John opened his mouth to retort, but nothing came out. He didn’t have any affairs, really. No friends or pets, and his job was incredibly flexible. He wasn’t the only unofficial rugby coach out there, let alone in Sector 2. He had been cloned from a donor rather than his father, but that generation was long gone regardless. He had a sister…
“Sherlock, I just, you’re my best-”
John shook out of it, mentally chastising himself. No, he needed to have faith, instead of accusing his flatmate of being a junky. Holding onto some sort of idea that Sherlock was an addict would only turn out to be trouble, considering how difficult it would be for John to mask his doctoral instincts.
“Likewise,” she said stiffly.
Sherlock had said, unwinding himself and getting to his feet, shedding the perfect impersonation of intoxication in less than a second. He looked down with a smile.
Inside the exit bay, John dropped the rope with a huff and searched around for the switch to the exterior doors. The first set slid closed behind him, and locked.
But when skin met contact with skin, it was as if the man came back online. The rest of his breath rushed through his lungs in an abrupt wave, eyes fluttering closed and nose scrunching, as if he smelled something bad. He shied immediately from John’s touch, stumbling back into the lab table without any of his earlier grace. John didn’t follow him, but he
Information could be uploaded into the brain via the Neuron-chip, but not necessarily retained. If John wanted to learn, say, German, the chip couldn’t upload it directly into fluency, but it could provide lessons that John would have to diligently follow. So, as it began launching information about proper stance and fighting technique, John could feel himself becoming properly bored.
His words devolved into racking coughs, far too much dust in his lungs. “John!” He heard, both close and distant at once. He couldn’t find the energy to try and fight gravity.
John felt himself ease just as quickly as he had dropped, the beginnings of a smile forming beneath the mask. “Well… that’s good then.” It was better than good. It was fine, all fine.
Watson,” he said. “I am an ex-army doctor invalidated from Afghanistan, though I am reliably informed that I bring that up too often. I am attracted to adrenaline in the most unhealthiest of ways, I mother-hen too much especially if it’s in matters related to your health, and I’m quite distractedly in love with my best friend. Oh, and I also played the clarinet in primary school. How do you do?”
John would have to be careful.
catch Sherlock looking at him, it was filled with intense thought, the slant of his brow showing his frustration and his lips tight. Whenever he would realize that John had met his eyes, he would turn away.
silver, a metallic almost-white color that had the same depth as a storm, shades of grays swirling almost amber towards the pupil. From a distance, you’d hardly be able to tell where the sclera ended and the iris began. John couldn't break their gaze.
Later, when John gets home, it’s to a scene he isn’t quite expecting. Sherlock’s on the couch, holding the guitar oddly, while Rosie’s standing on the cushion beside him and hitting at the strings, barely managing a tangible strum. Sherlock’s hand is running along the neck of the guitar, making the notes that she attempts to play. It’s like a picture out of a storybook, just so unbelievably sweet. John’s grinning ear-to-ear when Sherlock looks up. “Good afternoon.”
ME: I was born the 6th of January, 1977 by the way.
Halfway through June, the halls of St. Bartholomew’s nearly empty and blasting its air near-freezing, John stumbled into Molly.
These days, at least.
The man slipped off his shoes and huffed out another snort beneath his breath. “One for later, but no matter. I’ve been terribly rude.” He held out his hand, face completely clear of whatever had ailed him earlier. “My name is Sherlock Holmes.”
Their lips were touching, just barely, and Sherlock said the words directly into John’s mouth.
John’s head snapped up, and his eyes narrowed. Surprise of surprises, Sherlock was leaning against the wall with a grin nudging his cheeks. John had to keep himself from exploding. “Why do you
John screamed, hand fisting against the glass, his stomach turning to ice. No, no, no. Sherlock was on his back, hands and legs twitching against the floor and eyes flickering. Seizure? John sprinted to the door, banging on it until he saw someone through the window.
Sherlock furrows his brow, trying to deduce in midair the clues that don’t exist. His eyes are much too boyish, and he says in a voice much too small, “Is it me? Did I…?”
“Not well. I thought you couldn’t deduce me?”
Portugal.
The man was a juxtaposition. John felt inexplicably familiar with him, their personalities complimenting each other well despite their brief introduction, but Sherlock was an enigma enough that John never knew precisely how he should be feeling. He pursed his lips, but otherwise let it go. "Alright, yes. First off, it's called 'hyper-rail' for a reason. The train reaches tremendous speeds, we'd be lucky if the only thing it did was make us lose our grip."
“Wasn’t waiting,” John protested half-heartedly, before he realized it wasn’t the truth. Shaking his head to clear out the webs, John sat up in his chair. “What time is it?”
Beside him was the car, banged up but not too damaged. There was a dent slightly caving in the passenger door, as if had hit something unyielding. It almost looked like a dimple, deep with five specific corners.
“Stop what?” Sherlock shot back, infuriatingly calm.
Sherlock was very, very obvious at the moment, just sneaking towards the center doors. Someone began to turn, so John blurted out: “Severed finger!”
At home, the tensions were rising, and not the good kinds. Despite the (somewhat) openness back at the hospital, Sherlock soon became withdrawn and John found himself uncomfortable even being in the same room with him. Any olive branch of small talk John would offer would either be ignored, or barely reciprocated. They hadn’t worked together in weeks at Bart’s, even though John had glimpsed him in the halls of the college every once and again, meaning that Sherlock must have requested another assistant. John was hardly the wallowing type, but he couldn't help the spark of jealousy and hurt at the thought. Their contact was so limited that he didn’t even notice Sherlock’s monthly trip to France for whatever medicine (or illegal drug) he required, only noticing that his eyes were black one day and pale some day after. Whenever John
“Alone, Dr. Watson,” Mycroft interjected smoothly, closing the distance so that he stood only a meter away. People weren’t afraid to pass by the men anymore, and he lowered his voice beneath the chatter. “I believe it’s about time that Sherlock and I had one of our yearly discussions. Wouldn’t you agree, brother dear?”
Feeling like a child, John spun around on his heel and stomped away down the opposite side of the hallway, his cane clicking against the floor. He heard a chuckle, as soft as velvet, and he stifled a growl.
At that, the hand on his head tightened. “
is the anniversary of his death, as well as his birthday, but I… usually leave the evening before to get the traveling out of the way. I’m sorry.”
Sherlock glanced up at that to narrow his eyes, thoughtful. “You’ve always been a doctor deemed much more than decent, John. You’re the only one who doesn’t see it.”
Okay, just let the record show that, no matter how bad it looks from the outside, John Watson was not a right bastard.
“Good.” John feels breathless. “I’m sure you’ve already deduced, but I’m in love with you.”
The human body. There was an insane thought, the one that John found himself frequently entertaining. The idea that Sherlock wasn’t human, that everything he did was excused for the otherworldly material he was made of. That was obviously something John had to kick himself of; Sherlock had to be human, as there was nothing else he
“Oh, John,” he (it) greeted, muting the television on an old sitcom. “Good, you’re back. Tomorrow morning, there’s a fascinating little-“
Sherlock cleared his throat again, and John was half-hoping to find a blush against his cheeks. Of course, no color was shown. “A couple of weeks ago, Mike brought in an old friend into the lab I was working in, just hours after I had complained about needing a flatmate. It’s safe to assume that maybe the two instances are connected, somewhat.” His feet scuffed at the ground, and small droplets of water littered his curls. “So, I ask again, are you still in need for a flatmate? I found a wonderful prospect near Regent’s Park that we both could easily afford together.”
“I'd guessed as much. Were you any good?”
As for the three episodes coming out during the next month... God help us all.
Eyes were blank on him, as if he had grown a second head. He saw a smidge of greenish khaki moving at the corner of his eye.
“Oh, I have no doubt in my mind that it
Hard arms reached up to wrap around John’s shoulders, tugging him into a surprising and dreadfully intimate embrace. Sherlock’s breath was shallow and hot against John’s neck, fingers hooking into his jumper. John couldn’t help the sound he let out, small and airy.
John was definitely getting too old for this, he reckoned. Once upon a time, alcohol made him giggly and energized and full of bad ideas. Now it just made him nauseous and tired. “Let’s just go home, yeah?”
“Yeah, I know,” John said lightly, almost carefully. “I do, though.”
“I know,” he interrupts, then adds rather begrudgingly, “We were within a few years in secondary school. You were quite good.”
They stare, and John sways closer, and Sherlock swallows, and John follows the line of his throat that’s somehow gotten a speck of glitter on it, right on the Adam’s apple. He...
It didn’t take long. Despite the five times they’d been together before, they’ve had years of foreplay. John pulled back to sloppily press their mouths together, hand speeding between them. Sherlock’s hands gripped John’s arse, and he started to grind them deliciously into the wall.
Soon, more and more signs were announcing Plymouth as the car drew nearer. It was just after four in the afternoon, meaning that Sherlock had made good on his time estimate. Inside the city, John was at a loss.
John grimaced in the mirror. “This is stupid,” he announced, completely giving up on the bow tie and letting it stay around his throat in a mangled mess. “This is a completely useless affair and I don’t want to partake in it.”
It was an innocent love, one built from long nights of talking beneath desert stars and brushing fingers with chaste smiles. It was an attraction of the mind, of seeing another person for their soul and even the dodgy, messed-up bits, and then still finding yourself wanting to see
“Oh,” she agreed. “Is that a coincidence?”
ME: In a change of subject, I believe that my elbows are permanently numb from leaning on lab tables.
John’s brain supplied helpfully. “Er, yeah. Yes, I just got in last night. Well, this morning, really.” He blinked as they left the training facility, the morning sun hitting his eyes directly. Even through the massive dome over the ICAM, John could feel his skin bake. “Commander, though? I’d think the bridge would be excluded from all this.”
John skidded to a stop, the grip on his cane shaking, and Sherlock halted as well. “Stop being…
John giggles.
First: was what Mary said true?
for-”
A plate clinks as it’s set down in the sink, and the faucet is turned off. Slowly, mechanically, Sherlock dries off his hands. He braces himself against the edge of the counter for a moment, head hanging between his shoulders, and John hears him sigh. Outside, London shifts into its nighttime commute. John feels like they’ve been in this situation before, wound so tightly together that John doesn’t remember who did the sighing and who did the waiting. Perhaps it doesn’t matter.
Sherlock made a surprised noise. “Oh,
ME: Fascin
“Oh, that’s reassuring,” Sherlock mumbled sarcastically.
John huffed out a laugh, but it was rather dry. He cleared his throat. “Are… will you ever tell me why?”
she hissed, slapping on some gloves with an almost offensive fervor. John winced at the tone, keeping his eye on the door for Sherlock’s imminent arrival.
A split second, and then Sherlock shook his head frantically. “No, no, I’m a clone. Like you.” He was too animated to be an AI, John supposed, arms flailing about as he gestured. “I was a clone adopted into a family of AIs in Sector 2. He’s technically my brother.”
“What?”
“10… 9… 8…” The community counted collectively, as if it was New Year’s Eve. John only laid back, the sky now a deep navy and the stars as brilliant as they had ever been in humanity’s brief history. The dome disconnected itself from the power source, leaving only the clear glass to protect against the flares. When the first wave hit, the green-blue ribbons against the glass caused John’s very chest to vibrate, and families to cheer.
Mycroft smiled again, further resembling a shark, before handing over the paper.
habits.” She
It’s still mostly dark outside, but the staircase is alit just enough with the blue-ish glow of morning to keep John from tumbling down. His steps are even as he descends, like a muffled metronome to the barely-there music. When he reaches the sitting room, he lingers in the doorway.
ME: Baskerville is getting rather cramped. What say we, when the consciousness upload is up and running, take a trip to the countryside? I know of a wonderful apiary in Surrey.
John couldn’t believe what was happening. “You propositioned Sherlock Holmes.” It wasn’t a question.
“An Alvarez 5029, ash wood,” the man says, as if John hasn’t just had the shock of his life.
John wasn’t able to make it to the morning block, so he arrived to the second one. After lunch, he was just finishing his stretching when Sherlock ghosted at his side. John couldn’t help but blink up at him in surprise. “You’re actually here.”
“Please hold,” answered instead. After a moment, a male voice came on the line. “Doctor Watson, a pleasure.”
“Exactly,” she snorts, straightening the collar of Rosie’s holiday dress. His daughter seems positively delighted to be in the arms of a stranger, and he’s not in a hurry to ruin that, even if the stranger is a woman he used to rank high on his (admittedly metaphorical) DNR list. After a beat, Sally clears her throat.
For just a moment, though. A gentle push to the sternum, and he was back on land.
ME: What else would you like to know?
Ignoring that last comment, John touched the car’s hood with the palm of his hand, somewhat in a fit of stalling. The color was so black that it felt as though he would sink into it if he leaned far forward enough. “And what is the ICAM?”
Honestly, after everything that’s happened-“
When he processed the words John huffed out an uneasy laugh, rubbing at the back of his neck. “I don’t… well. I mean, that could get me in a bit of trouble, couldn’t it?”
“Sherlock!” John called.
He wasn’t resigned, this man, was in no way dutiful about the task at hand. He was
now being noticed ten minutes before midnight, after the flat having been full of detectives and nosy neighbors alike, but he supposes Sherlock had a point all the times he’s bemoaned Scotland Yard’s (dis)abilities of perception. Sherlock doesn’t move from where he’s lounged on his armchair.
“Teacher? Ha! No, he lacks the discipline for that, I’d say. This was over at my first uni, King’s College. In fact, once in a blue moon he was also at the London Fertility Center, where I interned. He’s known all over London’s medical district, always doing the odd experiment and causing trouble.”
He wanted John like this, the John never shown to the public. The harsh and wanting thing, the one that called himself straight and fucked Sherlock into the table with abandon. When John reached around to circle Sherlock’s cock, both were not far from release. In the end, Sherlock wasn’t even finished coming whenever John gave his last thrust.
Sherlock nodded, but there was a glint in his eye. “Reasonable. Are you ready to begin?”
“Oh, here, I’ve got her,” John says, but before he can, Sherlock takes her himself in a move that he’s ever so perfected, gentle and sure. He does this so often, stealing Rosie for himself, that John’s surprised he
Oh thank God.
know that you were the one who was drunk, right?” He tried.
Mary waved away the question, finishing her tea. Iced tea. When John warned that Mary had unexpectedly began craving the dreaded beverage, Sherlock made sure to keep it stocked at all times. “No, he got it. He just texted me, should only be a few minutes. But this gives me time to talk to you about something.”
“Why aren’t we being stopped?” John asked over the slight wind. Beneath him was nearly a foot of space, the hyper-rail running on a magnetic field alone, his toes only just getting a grip on the barely-there lip. John kept his eyes firmly anywhere but the ground.
ME: No matter, let’s get to studying. Beta, open Youtube and pick out any video that has humans interacting in English. Let’s hope our brains don’t rot before we can learn anything.
They were almost to the exit, if the slight cluster of people were anything to go by. John hoped that meant that there was still a means of exiting the craft just outside, and met Sherlock’s eyes nervously with a nod. Sherlock was able to sneak over to the exit bay well enough, but how was he going to leave with the same stealth? There was no way around the fact that he’d have to cut through the group of lingering engineers to get to the main doors.
Cliché, I know. But we were, as in, he was just-”
would
“Kathmandu, Nepal,” he clarifies, voice wavering. “I looked it up. Right now, it’s… 11:58 pm, on December 31st. In two minutes, they’ll be celebrating New Year’s halfway across the globe.”
Sherlock could be wearing a Victorian gown complete with a white powder wig, and he would still look infuriatingly dashing. Shaking himself, he says, “I think I just heard Rosie calling for me, actually, so I’ll just…”
John closed the fridge with his back, leaning into it. He shut his eyes for a bit longer than a blink. “Yeah. Fine.”
John realized what it must look like, feet frozen in the hallway and a deer-in-headlights look towards the scene. The girl straightened her dark hair back into her updo, as it had begun to spill out, and turned to walk straight towards John. When she glanced at him, she gave him a once-over and then a radiant smile.
If this, my soul, should be
A lengthy sigh, as if to bemoan the idiocy of the human race. A fitting description. “Because, Doctor Watson, while I myself am not going to kill you, I know of some nearby men that have orders to in reward of a healthy sum. They only have one job to do.”
“Okay?” He asked carefully.
In one way or another, Stansex was familiar with Sherlock.
“And you helped me!”
“But if you hadn’t,” Mycroft continued, “Then how would you react to the object of your darkest demons for the past couple of years showing up, and then telling you the whole thing wasn’t real? The thing you’ve been tortured and plagued with being revealed as a lie?”
“Shut up,” Sherlock grumbles.
Sherlock was completely in his element, practically molded into his leather seat with one hand propped on the wheel in, truthfully, the most relaxed pose John’s ever seen him in. He was rare in this human casualness, both in body language and fashion. He wore dark jeans and a thin v-neck, long sleeves pushed up to his elbows and neckline cutting just below the hollow of his throat. The burgundy color was fetching, John noticed, though there were few colors that Sherlock wouldn’t look good in. Troubled, John stripped himself of his jumper to the gray tee underneath, much too hot despite the air-conditioning. He leaned over the console to throw it on the backseat.
John tilted his head up to capture Sherlock’s mouth with a slight smile, stubble catching again. After this, Sherlock was sure he would be red-faced and raw from the burn, but he didn’t mind. It was fine. All fine. John’s hips were losing their rhythm and his mouth stilled against Sherlock’s until they were just barely touching, sharing hot breath. “I’m,” John whimpered.
John was beginning to feel uncertain stirrings in his ribcage, but he swallowed it down. “It’s obvious.”
She hesitantly shook his hand, grip laughably smaller than his. She was fair, but looked tanned next to his milky skin. “Yes,” she breathed.
At that ‘boring’, something itched along John’s spine, not unlike the feeling of spiders trailing up his skin, so much so that he could barely suppress a shiver at the tickling sensation. He suddenly and inexplicably had to prove that ‘boring’ wasn’t the case, though he had no idea why.
“No,” Sherlock said immediately, but his voice was pained. He opened his eyes, and all confusion made way to a sort of fury that made John understand why people could think he was frightening. And the glare was aimed at
“John,” Sherlock breathed in agreement, hands bracing themselves on John’s hips. At this point, he didn’t care what his face betrayed. “Brilliant.”
Sherlock’s hands dropped to the table so his lithe fingers could drum, his tone warm. “Eat.”
“Crew of the DSE Intrepid! Listen up!” Lestrade bellowed, though this time aided with a microphone. Mycroft stood behind him and off to the side, posture stiff as a board and eyes impassively scanning the some-five hundred people. “Today, all we’re going to do is give you a rudimentary tour of the ship, and assign you to your rooms. Each of you will
Sherlock sat John down at the table, clearing off the surface before fluttering off to grab the first aid kit. It had never been properly used, save for the occasional band-aid, so today would be its sort of christening. They began on his face.
Sherlock closed his eyes, sighed, and finally looked at John with his face full of wariness. His eyes darted down to the plate, and then back up. “You eat, and I’ll talk.”
Mycroft had interrupted his small tirade with a teacup and saucer, lobbed in quick succession at John’s head. John snatched them out of the air rapidly, one in each hand, before an orange followed the same trajectory. He swiped the orange out of the air with the dainty cup, and then snapped them all back down to the table with a tense air, no more household objects immediately forthcoming. John tried regaining his composure. “What the bloody hell was that for?”
Sherlock jolted, as if run through with an electrical current. His defenses dropped in horror and guilt, neck tendons jerking, and John nearly regretted saying it. But it was true. The car accident John could admit was ambiguous, even though Sherlock had antagonized him enough to make him storm out of the flat and into the street, but what happened tonight was cut-and-dry. Sherlock’s brother had tried to kill him. Sherlock slumped into his seat, all of the energy rushing right out of him and leaving him defeated. “You’re absolutely right, John. I apologize.”
I changed the title from 'let me be your taste test', in case anyone's confused.
And then Sherlock looks back up, eyes glassy and touched with red, and the way he looks at John says more than John ever could. It also utterly, unbelievably terrifies him. So John does what any other emotionally-constipated British male would do in the face of public intimacy: he makes a joke.
“Only a few chords at the shop, against my will.” He pulls out a guitar pick from thin air, apparently, and runs it along the strings in a gentle strum. “G major,” he murmurs.
They sound like a married couple, John realizes with a jolt. It wipes the smile from his face, but Sherlock doesn’t even notice, head ducked to watch himself finger out the correct patterns. John feels his heart throb once, painfully. It should be more bittersweet than it really is, should remind him of the domesticity he’d had with his dead wife with a much harsher potency. It doesn’t. It’s been happening for months, after all; the only difference is how long it took for him to notice. Warmth fills his abdomen, like a jug of sunlight spilling over and topping him up.
He had been traded in for a rule-defying Dr. Watson, it seemed. John didn’t know precisely how he felt about the shift. But before he could determine his feelings, he heard the vague sound of a working machine. He turned to see Sherlock watching him. He held his gaze, knowing that his face was betraying his worry, but Sherlock’s was only thoughtful and utterly unafraid. But before John knew it, the lights jumped off of Sherlock’s face, and they were bathed in darkness as they entered the outside.
John rolled his eyes so hard, he was afraid that they were going to be stuck there. He tried to walk through the hull like he had a purpose, though it was hard not to be distracted by the awe-inspiring interior. While not classically beautiful, there seemed to be the tiniest hint of a neon, fluorescent blue just peeking from behind the machines that gave the gigantic hull an almost alien feel in itself. The color seemed to root from the cylinder in the middle, as at the ceiling the centerpiece splayed open into different tubes and wires that ended up winding down to the individual walls of the great engine. It almost looked at if the cylinder was the central system, as it seemed to have a direct line to all of the working mechanisms. Or maybe the source of power.
John pretended to ponder it, though it was mostly him staring at nothing since he was so far gone. “Yes,” he eventually gurgled from his cramped position.
“‘Rache’ is German for revenge,” a man in scrubs said in a nasal voice from the crime scene’s doorway. He must be Anderson. “Perhaps she committed suicide
Slightly uncomfortable, he tried to gesture his meaning through his expression, but Sherlock just tilted his head blankly. “You were what?”
And then promptly freezes.
“No, not at all,” Sherlock replies.
He opens his mouth, closes it, and clenches the fist in his lap. Sherlock relaxes everything but the line between his brows and leans his head against his headrest, sliding his gaze out towards the front windshield, as if he can read the thoughts swarming between them like they were on a page. John sighs and closes his eyes.
The truth is obvious;
this.
So, as a conclusion to both the most important and the most horrifying day of John’s life, they checked out of the hotel at one o’clock in the morning and left for London.
Something about the wording alerted at something within Sherlock, like a lightbulb popping up without him knowing the reason. Sharpened, he surveyed the alley with a newfound fervor. “Intended purpose…” He muttered, before zeroing back in on the dumpster. Understanding dawned and he whirled around to John. “Brilliant!” He announced, grinning manically at the other man before turning on his heel and promptly diving into the bin himself.
He shuddered when he said that last word, but his profile wasn’t pinched in fury anymore. John slowly relaxed enough to shift into his seat normally, even if it meant coming closer to… him. It. He shook his head. “I’ve almost died before, in Afghanistan. I suppose I’m not as scared of the idea as I once was.”
“Then let me make this easy to understand, kid.” He started at the word, understandably, but John plowed on. “Somewhere in the hull, there is a man with a severed finger who’s neuron-chip detected that he needed medical assistance and alerted the COM, which happens to be me. Now, I could have slept for an extra hour, but that was taken away from me. Do you think that I would come down here from a mistake?”
John blinked, jaw tensing enough to cut steel. “You’ve been spying on me?”
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow. “Oh? And what have I been thinking about?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “That’s not what I meant-”
“Of course.”
considers it, before he can think about what ‘it’ he’s considering, but he knows that for the rush of excitement it brings him, with it comes an almost-equal guilt. He drops his hand.
John barked out a laugh at that. “Insanity? Sherlock, that was utterly
“I will attempt to contain my amusement."
“Tedious. Open-casket?”
After a moment, she began. “There are a lot of legends on Dartmoor, as you know. The main one that people know of are the hounds. There’s a whole Wikipedia article for sightings of the hounds, the ghostly black dogs that suck the energy from the trees. All nightmare rubbish. Stansex was built off of the myth, at first as a protection from the dogs. If everything was built from stone, where would the hounds draw their energy? ‘Town of stone’, Stansex means, meaning that it was claimed land. There were never any sightings of any of the various myths in the village, hounds or otherwise. Never any trouble.
“I need to…?” John shakes his head, feeling perpetually in a state of confusion at this point. Where did that even
doesn’t work out, what’ll they do? They’ve both lost so much. John can swallow down these feelings for the rest of his life, if need be; lord knows he’s had the practice.
At first, Sherlock didn’t notice, armchair pointed towards the telly and face propped in his hand. He had never been one to watch television, but here he was, eyes glazed over in insomnia as a ‘Captain Kirk’ manned the bridge of a highly illogical ship with negligible science backing its ‘warp speed’ factor. John had liked this show, he remembered.
They ended up at a quaint sandwich shop, not too far from the hospital. Understandably from the weather, the place was nearly empty. After ordering, they took a table near the back and waited for their food.
ME: What do you know about X-TE2?
side, but that wasn't exactly old news. John was patient enough to ignore it. “Right you are. Anything else you need me to do? Tie your shoelaces, maybe brush your teeth?”
Sherlock nods. It disturbs John, that he agrees so willingly, that he watches Rosie without complaint when her daycare has to shut down for the week from a burst pipe, that he moves through his own flat like a ghost afraid to scare the living. John wants teeth, something to snag himself on, he wants—
“Home,” she says softly. She tilts her head, not quite meeting his eyes. “Sorry. I just mean, you haven’t… moved back in yet?”
“I’m John Watson. I was going to be an assistant down here in the labs, but I’m assuming that that might cause some complications with you, if I’m reading this right.” He wasn’t shy with his thoughts, despite how speechless he had been about the man earlier. Now, he was just trying to get through this strange encounter in one piece. It was proving more difficult than he thought.
“Have you come to hit me again?” He said brusquely, trying to make his composure arrogant and harsh. It came across as weak. The act couldn’t even fool Mycroft, and
It continued, and while John regretted it later, the words blurred together until nothing was intelligible, the blood rushing past his ears much too loud. Outside the window, the ring shifted until it was parallel to the ground while the ship’s body stayed stationary, and Sherlock was carried out.
“And I swear, whenever this baby finally comes, I don’t know if I’ll be used to the change in balance. I’ve been using her as a counterweight.”
Jesus. John was going to get whiplash at this rate. “So… you’re not angry with me?”
John’s hands, growing frozen as they gripped Sherlock’s skin. Frigid.
This was all too much to accept, just in the ten minutes John had been in the flat. “Sherlock!” He yelled again.
more mature than Rosie. He isn’t expecting a text message, really; Sherlock’s solved many
John. You feel like a symphony, you know.”
John’s eyebrows shot up so far, he almost felt them brush his hair. He opened his mouth, closed it, mulled it over a bit, and decided. “Nope, not lately there either.”
. “I promise.”
John watches him. Watches the man he… the man he
John blinks, taken aback. Did he? There hasn’t been a case in weeks, and the few days he
That wasn’t what made living with Sherlock a full-time oddity, though.
John blinked. “An arse?”
That damned half-smile. “I’ll show you the next sunny day, bring you somewhere private. Why do you think I choose to live in London? It’s June, and yet I can count the perfectly cloudless days in the past several months with two hands.”
There was only one way to find out the truth. While Sherlock’s back was turned, haggling over wines, John grabbed his phone and texted the newest number in his recent calls.
Sherlock waved the compliment away, instead nodding pointedly to something off-ring. Taking the hint, John turned to look behind him.
This robot was beginning to grate on John’s nerves, but he knew how to utilize his game face. “So I know a few vocabulary terms, and can catch fruit. I’m sure there are people much more qualified for the task than me.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” she says, cradling Rosie in her arms, “But I believe it’s quite past Miss Rosamund’s bedtime. John, would you like me to...?”
“I was. Thanks, then. It’s just- well, I’m sort of in the dark in all of this, is all. Twelve hours ago, I was wondering what I was having for dinner. Now, I’m halfway across the world and part of the largest project in mankind’s history.” John ignored a shiver as they reentered the air conditioning, and accepted the water that was given to him. “It’s... a lot to take in,” he finished carefully.
Had he actually dreamed? About intimacy with Sherlock, no less? A better question: had John lost his bloody mind?
“What exactly are we
What had he expected? Mary to bring up what happened over half-a-year ago, the night John stripped him both mind and body and bent him over that desk
“If you’re insinuating something, I can assure you, while it’s none of your business, Sherlock is not my boyfriend.”
Living with Sherlock was an anomaly in itself, to say the least.
“Sorry for my shock earlier, I’ve never seen Sherlock willingly have another human being in his presence before. He’s not what you’d call a people-person.”
John smiled softly. “You’ve nothing to worry about.”
“I… didn’t want you to get in any more trouble.” John panted back. Honestly, he just hadn’t known that going around to the front was an option.
for violin,” Sherlock reads aloud.
She looks at him out of the corner of her eye, cheek twitching when she presses her lips together. “But, I sort of do,” she says, “Don’t I?”
“Urgh,” John replied, head buried in his hands. He had a hangover from hell, and the fact that he had a full day of tests both physical and mental ahead of him didn’t help. Today was the most grueling day as of yet, where the crew would be painstakingly tested in each and every way in their level of preparedness for the coming journey. It wasn’t an eligibility issue to make sure that the people were still on the Intrepid’s crew, that was already set in stone; it was more of a complete set of data for comparison purposes. The control, it was called. There would be cardio until exhaustion, problem-solving increasing in difficulty until exhaustion, g-force testing until the maximum speeds… Suffice it to say, John wasn’t quite at his peak level for the tests at the moment. But there wasn’t any rescheduling option, so he would have to try his best. Whatever it may be.
was the one complaining about it whenever he visited. Therefore, Sherlock made the flat look presentable each time he (they) made a visit. It was the only logical thing. “I can imagine,” he replied. “John’s late. Did he pick up the take-in, or shall I?”
ME: I beg your pardon?
“Bollocks, you’ve been aching for a good one, don’t lie to me.” And then the man noticed John and dropped his hand, eyebrows furrowing in immediate confusion. It should be offensive. “I’m sorry, I don’t believe we met. You must be…?”
“Really?” Sherlock asked incredulously, though he was already moving into action and untying John’s trainers. “I’ll remember this night,” he warned without heat.
The following morning, Sherlock’s making breakfast. He does that after disagreements, usually as a way to apologize, which makes John feel even more guilty; yesterday was Sherlock defending himself against a bombardment of questions, totally blameless. John vows to buy dinner tonight.
“I like to read,” he said, picking at the leg hems of his training uniform. “Even the classified stuff. It’s easy to get, and I like to read it. I… read something weird.”
“I suppose things didn’t go exactly the way you predicted?” Mycroft asked, perched in the armchair (John’s chair) when Sherlock arrived at 221B. His greeting to Mrs. Hudson went better than he planned, even if she had screamed and promptly fainted. However, he didn’t have the patience to talk to another living soul at the moment.
“I’ve entrusted my brother in your care for the better part of a decade,” he says finally. His voice is wry, the closest to humor as he’ll ever get. “I would hate for you to have nothing to show for it.”
of energy. This one,” he said, tapping the model ship on the ground, “I used electromagnetism to power it. But in space, there’s not enough to use! What is going to power it?”
The legend blinked, once, and let his gaze slide to somewhere an inch to the left. “I’m Sherlock Holmes,” he murmured. “And Stansex has a very good memory.”
John noticed, himself, and made to pull back. “No,” he protested in self-reprimanding. “I’m sorry, that’s… I’m not here for…”
“Er… hello?”
“Not particularly,” John replied slowly, though he wasn’t sure what was actually spoken and what wasn’t. He tensed up his own stance, knowing that Sherlock could attack at any moment. “I’m a rugby coach. I don’t think I’ve ever so much as gotten into a fight before.”
“You’re impossible. You can’t exist.”
Sherlock opened his mouth. He closed it. He stepped aside, and John shuffled in, closing the door gently behind him. The walk up the flat was silent and uncomfortable.
Maybe the
They had been roommates third and fourth year of basics in college, both studying medical. Mike was better at naming off the different kinds of bone fractures, while John could sever a leg and have it sewed up and wrapped before the next student was finished with cutting through the bone. It was no wonder Mike went into teaching, though it surprised him that he chose Bart’s instead of an actual university.
Sherlock twisted his lips, but otherwise complied. “Every time there was a jump in energy used by the planet, there was a spike in deterioration in the general fertilization worldwide. We know that humanity was the first to suddenly lose the ability to procreate in the early 21st century, followed by animals, and then to where we are now, the gradual extinction of the Plantae kingdom.” They turned the corner, passing the bathrooms, so Sherlock was able to raise his voice, if just a tad. “There should be no earthly reason why the two sets of data correlate. Why the next time they build a sector, another species is knocked off the grid. I checked the files that RJ supposedly was able to hack into; the energy information was falsified, making it look more consistent than it really was with unknown sources. No wonder it tipped him off.”
“Yes,” John said without much thought. “How do I make it go?”
okay. Has it ever occurred to you that Sherlock maybe, possibly, has the slightest amount of feelings for you? At all?”
He almost jumped out of his skin when a hand landed on his knee, gentle and cool as snow. “I wish I could help you,” Sherlock murmured. “You don’t deserve to be this deprived of sleep.”
“If we survive it,” Sherlock repeated slowly, amused. He seemed to always be amused at John. “Do you trust me so little?”
“Throw the poor man a bone, John, you’ve just broken his heart.”
“Is this the part where I die?” John whispered, curiously unafraid.
how people could be scared of Sherlock. On the receiving end, the man was much more intimidating than he could have ever imagined, teeth bared and eyes blazing with liquid ferocity. It was like the first time they had met, and if John hadn't been paying attention, he would've guessed that Sherlock absolutely despised him in this very moment. However, John was an army man; he knew how to stand his ground.
He trailed off when Sherlock’s face slid into a familiar glare, though lacking that same dangerous edge as a month ago. “Do leave the thinking to the professionals.”
The air was singing. “You were prepared to die?” Sherlock asked quietly, purposefully careful.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked after a moment.
never
John was gaping. “So I’m right?”
Sherlock took a step out of the bathroom, questioning, but John waved him away. “How did the news travel all the way out there?”
“Complications are hardly so simple for one to comprehend, and you are no exception.” There was a sense of superiority in Sherlock’s tone, making him further grate on John’s nerves. Sherlock’s former aggression was waning, and his face was pinched in a taught wire of tension that lined his bones. He turned his glare to Mike for a moment, as if cursing him for bringing John into his sanctuary. “Has he been properly scared, then? Am I finished?”
John says, a small, still-sober part of his brain screaming at him to stop, before this moment turns into a Moment. Or has it already?
John whipped his head down to RJ, blinking out of the memory that had reared its head. The boy had his ship back in his hands, scratching at something on its exterior with that quiet determination. “What?”
Oh, yeah. The Galactic Gala was classy to the extreme, but the after party that was thrown seemed to be anything but. God, but it was fun. John wasn’t decided on if the hangover was worth it or not, but the vague memory of Sherlock slurring his words and batting off prospective dance partners with a stick
“Him and I are, on the outside. Think of the science.” He pulled back, slightly, to meet John’s half-lidded gaze. “There is no magic involved, no hypnosis nor supernatural means. We are as much of nature as you are, because how could we exist if we weren’t?” He pushed closer. “You are, easily, the only human at the moment to know of our existence. The real me has killed the others.”
John thought vaguely, before succumbing to darkness.
Sherlock purposefully ignored him, eyes already perusing anything that could be observed inside the contemporary little dining room they were in. The few people eating here were nowhere close, but Sherlock stared at them in that unnerving way of his all the same.
AIs didn’t hold their knowledge in their brains, as in their head was where all the wires and equipment and such were stored to actually function the body. Memories and thoughts were housed in a massive system referred to as the ‘Reef’, a database connected to each and every AI so that their thoughts didn’t have to clog up their own system, but all be held somewhere else and immediately accessible. John had never thought about how it was powered, but he assumed such a feat to some-eighty million people was no small task.
“You shouldn’t be able to notice it anymore,” Sherlock said offhandedly. “It was implanted while you were still in the artificial womb.”
John nearly stumbled, which would be much worse when the person couldn’t walk well to begin with. “No! Not possible, that’s – god, that’s older than me!” He studied him with even more fervor, trying to find any sign of middle-age. Nothing obvious came to surface. “What’s your secret? Only eating organic, taking the stairs, ground-up rhino tusk in your smoothie?”
John pushed down the heat threatening his cheeks. “... Likewise.” He hoped Sherlock wouldn’t read too far into his own personalized meaning of ‘self control’. He absently tumbled a shrimp over and over again with his fork. “So. Where does that leave us?”
Fuck. No, let’s not.
Beautiful. “Like the next flu victim,” John manages to call back with practiced ease, years of experience masking any sort of break in his voice. Sherlock’s laugh echoes into the sitting room. John glances down at the tee in his hands dumbly. He wants to bring it up to his face, wants to inhale the familiar scent that has always soothed him, always meant ‘comfort’ and ‘safe’ to him in the years when his mental state was anything but. He wants to tug the shirt on and never take it off.
Outside is just this side of too warm for outer coats, the remnants of summer’s heat unwilling to let go of autumn’s rightful claim. John had pulled out the pram, but Sherlock had insisted that at Rosie’s age she should be walking with better mobility than she was currently. John proceeded to say no, that’s just technical milestones at unrealistic timeframes and that Rosie was actually quite advanced for her age, but Sherlock had waved him away and now allows her to grasp his index finger as he patiently helps her down 221’s front steps. Hiding a smile, John forgoes the pram and hails a cab.
Sherlock’s hands were currently beneath John’s shirt, gripping his skin. Was this classified as fun? Sherlock wasn’t exactly an ambassador of the art. But, as the alcohol cleared way to something more daring and, well, stupid, Sherlock realized that this game that they were playing? Two could play at it.
“I’m not good at this,” John says. “Talking.”
John exhaled heavily through his nose. “That’s not-”
“Yes, that’s what I said,” John said with a yawn, eyes closing to give any sort of relief to his head. “Anyway. Continue.”
“When I was young, me and my sister would come to Stansex to visit our grandparents every summer,” John began, building up a consistent rhythm in his steps. “We’re twins, as you know. The thing about Harry is that she never knows when to stop talking. Anyway, during dinner one night, she was going a mile a minute over any and everything she could think of. Our birthday is right before summer started, and we were starting to want separate birthday parties. So they were talking about moving my party back, and holding it whenever we came over to visit so I could have it with my friends that lived in the village. Harry was quiet for a moment, gears turning, before asking ‘when is Johnny’s birthday?’” He said the last part nasally, breaking off with a laugh. “She tried to cover it up, saying that she was just making a joke, but her cheeks were flaming red. I couldn’t stop laughing for hours, she was pissed at me for a week.”
When John hopped out, he winced. In the chaos of both body and mind in the past couple hours, he hadn’t really done an injury count. It felt like he had a deeply bruised rib, as well as some tender spots around his abdominals. He lightly brushed his cheek, and the skin there felt rough. Nothing major, just a thin strip of dried blood – the fucker that was wailing on him must’ve had a ring.
John didn’t even have to ask. “I know, I know. Come here.”
“Does it fly?” John questioned.
Mycroft
“That’s what practice is for!”
“One would,” John sighed. “I’m just- well, I can’t be the only medical school drop out that they’re interested in.”
A gasp, nearly silent if Sherlock wasn’t attuned to everything the world could offer a blind man. The pulse beneath his fingertips fluttered, soft and batting like drops of rain hitting a window. John removed his hands, only to rejoin them around Sherlock’s jaw, horribly fragile and unsteady as his thumbs slid along cheekbones. Sherlock wanted to run his fingers over John’s face and feel his expression in his hands.
rings through his head, and he realizes with a jolt that it wasn’t a metaphorical statement. Sherlock knew from
afterwards you’re to leave the ship and say your goodbyes to anyone willing to make the trip over here up until 18:00, or generally just waste time. Then, you’ll come back for your in-depth cleaning and officially board the ship in time for your first dinner aboard. Don’t bother bringing anything aboard; any and all things will immediately be denied clearance, but don’t worry. Anything you were given by us here will be replicated on the ship, including phones and tablets. Any questions? Great! In we go.”
What was he going to do if the legend was true?
Though the most marveling sight of the ICAM, John supposed, was its centermost structure: the DSE Intrepid.
“No,” John replies truthfully. He leans over it to look out the window, to where Molly and Rosie are crossing the street. “Painless?”
“John…” Sherlock began uncertainly, hands tightening slightly on the folded clothes in his hands. Without looking up John uncorked it and took a deep swig, once, before setting it on the counter.
“Next question.”
5 MAY 2016
With a grin, the next song came on and John whipped around so his back was to Sherlock’s chest. The men around them seemed to know the lyrics to the song that was currently blaring. With a sense of equal parts horror and fascination, Sherlock realized that John was beginning to slowly grind.
was helpful advice. Not for the first time in these past few months, John wondered why the hell he was in this situation. It was almost comedic, a dead body upstairs with a detective inspector making sure he had good intentions with his mythical creature of a roommate. John flicked his eyes to the side, but Sherlock had already disappeared from view. “Okay,” he said, awkwardly pocketing the DI’s card. He licked his lips. “Let me get something straight. Whatever it is that, erm, him and I have, I can… assure you that it’s more one-sided than you’d think.” He kept a frown from tugging his lips. “If anyone has the capacity to break any hearts, it’s him.”
“John!”
The ground dropped beneath him, buckling his knees and throwing him forward. The vibrations were thunderous, the sounds like crashing drums and striking cymbals as the avalanche dragged down his torso. “Sherlock!” He screamed, managing to lock his fingers onto the stationary cliffside closest to him and latch on for dear life. His feet hit nothing but the ragged wall in front of him; he risked a glance down, and the void had made a reappearance beneath him.
Vaguely sourced from European folklore.
“Oh, I’m sure.”
John spat. “I’ve seen you glaring at me, and reserving labs without telling Sarah to list me as your assistant. You were thinking? Thinking about
“No ‘Sherlock Holmes’?” He asked tentatively, leaning further against the counter. She met his eyes with surprise, Apparently not expecting him to know of the 'agreement', but then turned back to her computer screen with a delicate sigh.
‘Why?’ John nearly asked, but it was moot point. He narrowed his eyes and, grumbling to himself, started on the shoulders.
He pursed his lips when he couldn’t find the words, but the other man carried on just fine. “Mycroft, please. And you were in medical school for eight years, though you dropped out just before graduation due to a familial emergency.” John clenched his left fist in alarm. “It says in my files that you were top of your class each year there, and you made a near-perfect score on the finals you did manage to take. That’s enough to be going off of now, don’t you think?”
Whatever happens,
Not a hair out of place, he stopped exactly a meter from John and set him with a stare. His eyes were nearly black, John noticed, narrowed thoughtfully above the surgical mask that covered the bridge of his nose to his chin.
had Sherlock used John’s razor to shave the hair off a decapitated head (the poor sod was a redhead and John came home to a bald scalp and ginger hairs in his blades).
ME: I suppose we need to begin studying human characteristics. Perhaps I’ll even learn something.
John had nearly forgotten about the child, their last (and only conversation) having been from the time John had initially met him. He had also never brought up the ‘file’ information to Sherlock; it was confusing enough as is. The energy question, however, had seemed important enough to disclose. “Oh?” He asked. “And what’s that?”
The way John said it, his surname as if it was some sort of endearment like
By the time the vial was nearly half full, the sky was a musky violet and the air seemed just chilly, rather than the freezing it was before. “Sherlock…” John called uncertainly. His breath wasn’t fogging up anymore.
Sherlock jolts and blinks back to the present, as if he were halfway across London and just found himself in this bar, right now, plucked and dropped from the sky. His jaw works around invisible words, and he hurriedly takes a giant step back until they’re a respectable distance apart, eyes wide and disorientated and utterly… lost.  John hates the space between them, almost as much as he hates himself.
“While we’re there, I expect you to eat at least half of every meal I give you.”
Look through some of my half-written fics and if you like them, bug me for an update, haha. As always, drop a comment (or a tumblr ask) if you liked the fic, and thanks for reading!
Sherlock was wrong. It took them roughly four minutes to get up a single flight of stairs, and from there John didn’t seem to be finished with Sherlock yet. Flopping onto his bed, he started at his belt.
I could have sworn they were darker, last time we met.”
The men were aware of him, their voices alarmed and their own feet slapping against the pavement in their chase. When he took off running, he hadn’t used any stealth, just an animalistic need to flee; it resulted in unavoidable noise. He pushed harder.
“These things…” Sherlock starts again, prompting John to lower the paper once more with a stifled grumble. Sherlock’s facing him again, cheekbones flushed, but that could just be from the steam. He keeps his eyes up somewhere closer to the ceiling than the table. “Is there… That is, would you say that there’s a specific subject matter?”
“Of course.”
The word pulsed in the air, and Sherlock grinned that absolute perfect crooked smile, one cheek dimpling. “You’ve deduced it,” he murmured, suddenly ducking his head to lick a cool stripe up the side of John’s neck. “I knew you were different.”
to laugh at John’s discomfort? Sherlock schooled his features, but even while John glared at him, the taller man couldn’t completely hide the amusement from his eyes.
He side-stepped into the open space beside Sherlock’s outstretched arm, bringing his hands up to cup his angular face. He could feel legs kicking behind him, catching on his clothes, but he did his best to keep steady. “Hey,
“John? John Watson?”
What John knew wasn’t lengthy at all, but apparently was
When there’s no immediate answer forthcoming, he huffs out a breath and reaches for the doorknob, intent on roaming the streets of London aimlessly until his legs can’t hold him anymore, presumably.
in a room stuffed with their closest friends, stifled and embarrassed, but he also can’t find the will to deny Sherlock any longer.
“... Oh,” John said lamely.
“Hm?”
. It’s amazing how much damage you can do when you trick yourself into thinking you have nothing to lose.”
Sherlock’s eyes were bright beneath his fringe, and he honest-to-god grinned, bright teeth flashing and dimple winking and overall reminding John that he lived with an immortal child, one with a propensity for blowing up the kitchen and getting excited for danger and mystery as if it were his birthday. Sherlock grabbed his shoulders and jostled him.
he sings, sweetly,
would one get to that?
Sherlock embarrassed, voice stuttering. Face more blue than pink and never a blush. The color of snow.
Sherlock helped him up, hands steady around his waist. “You’re asking me that?” He bit out in a gruff voice. He almost seemed angry. “I should have never brought you out here.”
“No… overbearing exes?”
Her mouth drops open in shock, and she sputters out a string of words which

instead? I rather like that one.”
John didn’t need to spin around to ascertain Sherlock’s words, and found himself utterly unsurprised at the thought. His own mouth curved into an answering smile.
Sherlock cupped his hands around his mouth. “John, I think it’s a bit-”
Something was niggling in John’s mind as an answer. “Whatever is supplying the power here.”
ME: ... Yes. Again, is that alright?
The man may as well have been a bloody
Starting at the sound, Sherlock rolled off to finish stripping himself, kicking off his trousers and pants along with his socks. John had barely managed his own shirt in the meantime, and his vest was slightly plastered to his skin. His hands were pushing at his jeans and pants, trying to free his cock to no avail.
John ripped the paper from its spiral, crumpling it in his fist. No. Breathe in, and out. Trying to calm his tensing muscles, he slowly straightened out the sheet and set it to the side. The facts, Watson. Focus on the facts. The clean new paper on the spiral was daunting, so John pushed the notebook to the side as well and powered on his laptop.
“Right now?”
As people began to move, John jogged to catch up with Lestrade. “Captain,” he greeted when he was close enough.
Fortunately, on one mid-October morning, Sherlock’s mobile rings a familiar ringtone. He immediately taps it on speaker and drops it unceremoniously to John’s lap.
ME: We haven’t yet even perfected animal cloning. It may be a few years yet until human cloning is widespread, and even then it’s not without its dangers.
Sherlock snorted. “So he’d like me because I’m clever?”
Hours later finds the pair (and a half) at a small café on Camden’s Passage for brunch, satiated on crepes and crisp summer fruits. Sherlock’s lips are tinged with blue from the candy floss earlier that prompted his appetite, but it’s too endearing to be pointed out.
“First one boy, newest one a surprise. I’m hoping for a girl, but Candy swears up and down it’s going to be a boy.”
The extra men finally arrived, and despite their gasping breaths they didn’t waste any time. One grabbed John’s forearms and pulled them back before he could react, yanking them behind his body so tightly that his chest strained outwards, twisting his bad shoulder and bringing him to the brink between ‘painful’ and ‘agonous’. He kept his jaw locked. The man at the gate took another step forward, silent, until he was close enough for John to see the evil glint in his eye.
He begins to play Clair de Lune again. John drops a kiss to his temple, because he can, now. “Always?”
didn’t want to know.
John shifted uncomfortably. Sherlock pretended not to notice. “Yes, well…” John began.
BASKERVILLE A.I. PROGRAM - BETA
. “Really?”
“The real you isn’t human,” John said weakly. An arm snaked around his waist.
“That sounds ominous,” John said.
The wound in his shoulder, freshly-healed, was throbbing. His left thigh was throbbing. His dominant hand, clenched in his lap, was throbbing. Everything was throbbing and it had become so normal that John couldn’t think clearly without the pain anymore. With the lightest of groans under his breath, John attempted to change his train of thoughts before it dived into his daddy issues or his increasing fondness for beer. Might as well throw in his blurry heterosexuality while he’s at it.
But, for the first time in his life, Sherlock entertained the idea of the opposite.
Sherlock stormed away, all legs and cheekbones. John, after the initial shock and rushed apologies, had to practically jog to catch up. Which was a lot tougher with a cane.
Instead, he leaned forward and softly pressed his lips between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, arms winding around his middle to hold them flush. Cherished. He whispered into the skin there, “I’ve never been more obsessed with someone that I am with you, my Holmes. It’s always you.”
“Deployed in 2001,” he murmurs, and then blushes. “I haven’t, er, invaded any privacy or anything of the like, of course. Simple deduction.”
A beat, and then his brother. “Your Dr. Watson is one of the strongest men I’ve ever known,” Mycroft said softly, tender and horridly familiar from childhood. When he placed his hand over Sherlock’s, placating, Sherlock couldn’t help gripping it back and pressing it against his temple, tears stinging his eyes. “If there’s anyone who can dismantle Moriarty’s chain once and for all, it’s him.”
‘Lestrade,’ John mouthed, shaking his head.
Lestrade blinked. Obviously, this wasn’t a common occurrence. Reluctantly, the captain made his departure, muttering something about more sleep and extra training. After he left, the stand off between the brothers had not lessened in intensity.
John huffed out what he supposed was a laugh, but he didn’t think he had curled his lips into a proper smile.
“Mints?”
“She’ll be awhile, I just changed her nappy and put her down. You owe me a
He held up his phone, to where it was on a weather app set to Cardiff, and waved it in their faces.  “Dry umbrella, wet collar.
Sherlock’s eyes were growing wider than John’s ever seen them, and he didn’t seem to be breathing. He nearly fell over his words. “Observing… in a sense, y-yes.”
It’s not as if he’s thought it all over. He’s been specifically
John, oddly enough, wasn’t appeased. “Eyes on the road! Why are you wearing sunglasses anyway? Even if it
Two, then. “Congratulations,” John said instead, raising his cup in a sort of toast. “Boy or girl?”
"Yes."
He eats toast over the sink and drinks as much water as he can handle. It’s as quiet as London can be, this late, and the buzz of it calms his nerves. He isn’t sure why he’s anxious in the first place. When he’s done eating, he leans against the edge of the counter and sighs.
“What are you talking about?”
“Say something,” Sherlock snapped instead.
Eventually, when he can find his feet again, he shuffles back into the sitting room and strikes up an aimless conversation with Sarah. He’s still holding the eggnog like it’s the only thing keeping him grounded to Earth.
John was instantly on guard. “What?” He peeked down the hallway, but no one else seemed to be up yet. “Are you out of your mind? You can’t leave the ship, the dome’s already been opened and we’ve all been cleansed already. You go out there, you might not even be allowed back on.”
Sherlock’s eyes were flying anywhere but John, yelling at people and demanding rudely at the paramedics. The hand covered with John’s blood was shoved in his pocket.
Long fingers straightened at the bedclothes, and his voice had an unfamiliar edge to it. “My full name is William Sherlock Scott Holmes, you see. While we’re there… Introduce me as William Scott.”
He didn’t see himself regularly wanting that despite how often he complained, but it was good to know.
“I’m not,” Sherlock replies quickly, shaking his head, moreso to clear it than anything else. He huffs out a laugh. “I was trying to impress someone.”
Among the array of people combating, there was one that stood out. Funny that, the one that John noticed wasn’t even fighting, just standing meekly in her own corner as if she longed to be anywhere else. John furrowed his eyebrows. “Molly,” he said quietly.
A moment of silence, and then a sigh. The padding of feet. The slide of skin, a freezing hand on a bicep as John was guided down to a sitting position on the mattress. The rustle of clothing as Sherlock crouched in front of him, hands resting on John’s knees.
“Why?”
. “As you wish.”
have ever happened. It wasn’t exactly the healthiest environment for a relationship, especially between ranking officers. Nothing could have happened afterwards, either, because then James was nearly blown up and blamed for dozens of deaths, and a month later John was shot in the shoulder, and the fates decided that whatever
In a few moments, Sherlock's face morphed from shock into some sort of quiet outrage. “You… You think I regret saving your life?” Quick as a flash, Sherlock closed the distance between them to grip John’s biceps, face inches away. “You don’t know anything,” he hissed.
“Now?” He shouted back. “No! Let’s get in a few dances first.”
Sherlock couldn’t escape John’s gaze if he wanted to, surprise already morphing into fire. “We’re fine,” Sherlock said simply, knocking back his mug to finish off the rest of his beer. It was disgusting, as usual, but it gave him a rushing buzz that sang behind his eyes. “Are you quite ready to leave yet, John?”
“John,” she says. “Thank you for the invite, the party’s lovely. Your landlady’s punch is…”
“So, there was only one creature that somewhat fit these factors you’ve established.”
“Alright,” he said. Trying to keep clinical, he raised his hand and swept his fingertips down the marble contours of the taller man’s neck to the hollow of his throat. Then blinked. Prodded at the junction between his neck and shoulder, now entirely clinical. Frowned. With one hand, he pressed firmly into the skin below his ear, the other trailing down to hold his wrist. Sherlock huffed a breath at his ear, his lips parted, and John’s eyes were level
Silence. And then, nearly a mumble: “I’m really quite fast, John.”
For the second time today, John’s eyebrows shot up in bewilderment. Now there’s a title he hadn’t heard in… well, ever. “I’m hardly a doctor, Mr. Holmes. I…”
John had aligned their erections and was beginning to tug, sucking a bruise into his gorgeously tensed neck. He had to remember this, John thought, if he ever wanted to get the infamous Sherlock Holmes to
“And you have seaweed in your hair.”
My god, I knew you were a genius, but… Of course, you’ll have to eventually apologize to that woman, as you’ve probably ruined her life at the moment, but…
– ahem, I mean the pleasant smell of it. Horrid for its potency. It’s driving me utterly mad, but it makes me feel… it makes
He was suddenly still, and the moors were alit with the morning sun. Mary stood in front of him, hands gripping his arms and eyes wide with terror. She was hot as an iron, a searing pressure against his skin as she shook him.
“She’s gone.”
“Sherlock and Mycroft,” John said once he shook himself out of his reverie, stepping out onto solid ground. “Do they not get along?”
“I think he’s trying to say Simmons, sir!” One of the engineers in the group inserted.
ME: Perhaps later. I’d prefer not to go into my childhood nor the history surrounding the setting, if you don’t mind. Any more questions?
John snorted. “Good call, considering I’m both.”
“Sherlock, that was… I’d never call you a freak, by the way. Second, I didn’t mean that you
Sherlock only waved them away, taking long strides into the crime scene without a backwards glance. Both Lestrade and John watched him disappear through the doorway, before Lestrade clapped his hands and turned back to John.
that he feels something for Sherlock beyond the bounds of friendship, so how the hell can he expect to tell the man himself? Where does that leave him?
Sherlock sighed, leaning away from the microscope and meeting John’s eyes with mild annoyance. He seemed defeated, and not at all surprised. “Don’t you mean water? No, John, water does not kill me.”
John nodded, cleaning off the rest of the slab. He placed the bundle of lilies he brought at the base. “Yeah, me and Harry weren’t exactly planned. They were just a young couple who weren’t careful, and got twins on their first try.”
Shines with a cold, dispassionate smile --
Mike stopped at set of double doors, the words ‘Chem Lab 4’ stamped on the wall beside it in big black letters.
“More than anything. Though I do have a certain fondness for being back in the city, not getting shot at.” His finished off his sandwich, and leaned back in his chair. He could hear the ominous rumble of thunder in the distance, and prepared himself for a difficult walk home. Which reminded him, “Am I finished for the day, then? Or do you still need an assistant for the evening?”
Sherlock’s pupils grow impossibly wide. “Tell me.”
“Look,” he said, as serious as he’s been this whole conversation, “I’m not going to start up on any ‘break his heart I’ll plant meth on you’ rubbish, but really, his brother has placed his mental well-being in my hands for reasons nobody but Sherlock should tell you about. And considering that Sherlock likes me a hell of a lot more than he likes his brother, and he seems to like you enough to bring you along on a favorite activity of his, there’s obviously some cause for concern.” He dropped his hand, stuffing it into his pocket to search for something.
“John, that’s awful!” She giggled at something he said, her hand reaching out to brush against his forearm. He didn’t feel disgust at the touch, per say, but he didn’t find himself liking it as much as he should. Sarah was beautiful and witty and smart, and John felt broken by not being very interested.
ago, but I was denied. So, I had to take matters into my own hands.”
There were many points that John could touch on, but he chose the most obvious one. “You can delay the virus? Why in the hell wouldn’t they let you take samples, knowing that were the case?”
Instead of exploding like he was on the inside, he let out a hiss of breath and pinched the bridge of his nose until his blood pressure was at acceptable levels. “Sherlock,” he said evenly, almost conversationally, “What in the ever-loving
John was gasping for breath from the adrenaline, but he couldn’t seem to get a hold on the thinning air. His eyes were quickly adjusting to the darkness, so he was able to watch Sherlock scramble towards him and reach into his coat. “Hold on!” Sherlock barked, pulling out some sort of device and clamping it over John’s mouth. Air began rushing into his lungs, bitingly cold.
“You can deduce
curious, he was also realistic. “You’re allowed to bring in people off the street, then?”
Sherlock didn’t pause his ministrations. “The diet of my kind, or my personal diet?”
Sherlock yelled, breaking free and letting John go altogether, eyes wide and chest heaving with his breaths. “No! I can’t… don’t you see, John?”
With this speed and the traction of his shoes, he was able to run up a considerable way on the other curve of the ring. With the last few, powerful pumps of his legs, when gravity proved too much he leaped off into the center, and latched himself onto the barest end of the rope he was able to get.
Pale eyes followed the line of John’s throat as he swallowed. “You’d have to ask him directly.”
Like a switch, Sherlock stiffened. Somehow, he had heard John's whisper. The receptionist looked down, unaware, and wrote down the request on a post-it. “Of course, sir. Anything else?”
John could find a mausoleum to hide in until dawn, when the visitors would begin arriving and he could fade into the crowds. He could keep hidden, in fear of the men just tombs away with orders to end his life. It would be an apt place to die, very convenient overall. He could curl up under a haunted nook for the night and hope for the best.
“She’s in position,” Mycroft informed, and something must have flashed across John’s expression because he said firmly, “
“You bastards are lucky I don’t,” John joked. “Rugby has its risks. God knows I have my fair share of scars from the damned sport.” He rolled his left shoulder involuntarily. His hand seemed to give an extra quiver in acquiesce. “What time is it, any of you know?”
Sherlock quirked his lips, though otherwise waved him away. “I ate yesterday. Regarding sleep, however...  I believe I caught a few hours the morning before you arrived.”
By the end of the aurora, John was already inside and reaching for his phone. He dug the card out of his pocket and typed in the number. Mycroft answered immediately.
Sherlock tilted his head, halting his hands on his shirt. “Oh. Do you want to do this part?”
She was about to leave, but she paused for just a lasting moment. “Go for it,” she said meaningfully, eyes wide and prompt. “You only come across an arse like that like that once every lifetime, if that.”
until John was grinning and complaining about the milk and ruffling Sherlock’s hair and not
Against the door, John giggled and began to slide down to the floor. With a roll of his eyes, Sherlock set the laptop aside to stretch to his feet, legs stiff from disuse. “John,” he greeted with disinterest, maneuvering around the messy living room to stand before the pile of the man. “Welcome home. I’m assuming you’re sleeping at the doorway tonight?”
the shopkeeper shuffles forward. “Never fails to impress the birds,” he chuckles, and then pauses to study the taller man from the corner of his eye. ‘Or the blokes’ is unspoken, but implied.
“What song is it, then?” Sally asks, but Sherlock’s already playing. It’s complicated and rhythmic, played in a wistful key that reminds John of the rainforest, or of rain in general, pattering down on the ground with the same softness as the finger-plucked strings. John’s never heard of him play it before, and he wouldn’t be surprised if he hasn’t; the genius can play what he hears without practice.
He had a smirk when he said that last part, though, so John was pretty sure he wasn’t as wary about the whole situation as he had put forth. John sighed, leaning against the glass that separated him from Sherlock. The Intrepid was vibrating at his feet, the thrusters beginning to power up. Lift-off was at any minute, and the thought sat in his stomach with barely-held anticipation.
On the elliptical, John was just reaching his third mile when Sherlock appeared, leaning across from him at the helm of his machine. He was winded, cheeks flushed and curls plastered handsomely against his forehead. But his attention was utterly enraptured elsewhere, eyes trained somewhere over John’s right shoulder.
“Shit,” John said.
is what he’s like… They only touch by Sherlock’s hand braced on his shoulder, but his nerves are ablaze and his tongue is thick and he’s both hot and cold at once.
“Yes?”
No, no, don’t give me that look, you know bloody well what I mean. Stop being graceful, and aloof, and flawless, and ignoring me, and brilliant, and just…
. John was well-acquainted with that rule.
“Mary said that you devoured a man’s blood. Drank it. You’re… pale. Icy. Eat very little. You’re very strong and even quicker. I’ve never seen you sleep, and… well, you’re beautiful. Gorgeous. Incredibly, impossibly perfect. I’m not waxing poetic, or anything of the like. It’s just a sort of beauty that doesn’t exist. Can’t happen, not naturally.
“I’ll… take that as a compliment?”
Sherlock’s lips are tight, brows furrowed in frustration, but he relaxes just the barest amount. He blinks once, twice. “Okay,” he says simply.
“Oh?”
Sherlock turns and strolls down the hall, pale scars on his back just catching the light. “How do I look now, John?” he questions, delightfully playful.
Unfortunately, the drop came quicker than he thought.
John awoke to his last day off, the Wednesday before the DSE Intrepid would launch and subsequently annihilate the ICAM. With that thought, he got up to begin what he supposed would be a rather boring day.
John thought.
“I don’t believe I’ve informed you of your task as of yet.”
“It’s awful, yes, to answer your unspoken question.” Sherlock then pushed off the ropes towards the center. “Are you ready to begin?”
It all seemed to happen at once. As Sherlock reached further over the bed, and as John began to sit up, their heads knocked together and noses pressed uncomfortably. Their lips didn’t even touch, Sherlock realized when he thought back on it. But at that moment, before John could flop back down and before Sherlock could apologize, the air just…
ME: I knew I’d hit the bottom eventually. Just remember not to compare yourself to humans, most of them are idiots. You are making remarkable progress towards your understanding, however. It took approximately two-hundred words longer than yesterday until you couldn’t understand me  enough to form a response.
“Quite,” Sherlock replies, fiddling with a 3D puzzle in his hands. Rosie is entertaining herself with a bundle of straws. Sherlock suddenly looks up, eyes narrowing at John in that familiar, thoughtful way that should be more unnerving than it is. “What did you buy for me?”
Sherlock was dialing. “Which lake?”
Sherlock pushes off the counter.
John shook his head, fists clenching and unclenching. His cane was somewhere by the door, his leg completely free of pain. “I… Sherlock, what are you?”
Sherlock hummed, but dropped his hands to his side. “Very well,” he drawled, shuffling closer. “I suppose you’ve come to your senses then, hmm?”
“John, look!” he exclaims, holding up a cherry wood tobacco pipe with a long, elegant stem. On its bowl is a carving that depicts a ship lost at sea. John levels him with wry, narrowed eyes.
Sherlock shrugged, leaning back in his seat. He brushed off the crumbs from his lap. “You were used as a pawn, but it’s doubtful he would repeat a performance. Jim Moriarty is like the playwright for an extravagant Broadway script; he’s writing his own rules, but he loathes cliches and anything the audience can predict.” Sherlock absentmindedly pressed at his lips with his finger, thoughtful. “We’re nearly at the end of Act 1, I’d think. Something’s coming, but I don’t have enough data to precisely figure out what. It’s utterly exciting.”
“I killed her,” John repeated, slightly hitching at the end. “Do you... Do you still love me?”
“I’d imagine,” John says shortly. “I suppose you’ll see when the time comes, won’t you?”
John shook his head. “I knew what was happening, and I didn’t stop myself. I know that you’re… against this sort of thing.”
An exhale against his lips. “It’s possible that you know me better than I know myself,” Sherlock breathed, looking at John as if he bloody owned the stars. “You love me.”
Before he could shut the door, she wedged her foot in the opening to prevent it from closing. Her bright red lips were pouty, from what John could see. “Same time tomorrow?” She asked.
“Oh, dear, I just dropped the crackers. John? Could you-”
Another admirer, then. She inconspicuously straightened at her clothes, cheeks blazing, but Sherlock didn’t even spare her a glance. “John Molly, Molly John. John is my assistant for the morning, and Molly is the least irritating mortician as of yet.”
“I meant friends,” Lestrade replied lightly. A pause. “Though not quite friends either, I see?”

want-
“I think you’re tip-toeing around me because you’re terrified that I’m going to leave.”
“No, honestly! First the car accident, and then this… what would you have done if I wasn’t there?”
John blinked. “Mine?” He ran his brain for anything useful, but nothing was forthcoming. “It’s a common name.”
Sherlock scoffs. “Hardly. We never even… Only the most generous of definitions could call what we had even a ‘relationship’. Love was never in the equation for him.”
noticed that he hadn’t ever seen Sherlock actually sleep, he didn’t think that it
She quirked her mouth into the beginnings of a smile, eyes blinking slowly, and John was torn between feeling triumphant and unnerved. She didn’t enter the building with him, only inclined her head in lieu of farewell and spun away on her heel. John didn’t have the time to watch her leave, being ushered instead into the clinic and enduring tests and a surprising amount of shots for the next few hours.
“Just fun?” Sherlock asked, not able to resist a taste below the hollow of John’s ear. John’s hands scrabbled along his spine beneath his shirt, nails skittering along the sweat-soaked skin with an electrifying pleasure.
“Believe me, if there was a way out of this that didn’t end in even more punishment, I’d have found it,” he drawled, knuckles brushing John’s neck as he worked. John lifted his chin up and out of the way automatically.
Lestrade’s face turned an alarming shade of red, eyes nearly bulging out of their sockets, but before he could fire back, a voice interrupted.
“The data goes towards my work, which as you should realize, affects the human race as a whole,” he challenged. “My, captain, I didn’t realize you were comfortable keeping humanity extinct because of your childish hatred for me. Tell me, are you itching for the Earth to die as well, or am I just assuming?”
“Put up your food, I’ll explain on the way to your room,” said Sherlock, standing up to his full height with a slight noise of discomfort. John immediately complied, gathering his plates and following suit.
John was close to it, though, from his constant physical activity, but his bones were weary and aged and not at all fit for the inactivity of zero-gravity. His head still stung from the hit earlier, and whenever he wasn’t running the field, he was plagued with a limp. His hand shook when it had nothing else to do, and John could already
John demanded, managing to keep up with the man. Sherlock kept his eyes straight ahead.
“Is it still Harving?”
John hummed, and he was too far gone from then on. Would he remember tonight, Sherlock wondered? It wouldn’t be hard to guess if he awoke in his current position, and Sherlock was hardly going to undress him further for bed. With a lasting, uncertain look, Sherlock took his leave and quietly shut the door behind him.
ME: Nothing. Delete that, it’s none of your concern. Explain the program.
“Hm. I’ll have to negotiate it with the boss, but I wouldn’t hold out much hope. She’s a true tyrant.”
And that’s where he thought for the second time in his life that he was going to die.
“Sher-!” John shouted, cutting himself off to fall into a string of curses. His hips were thrusting shallowly, so Sherlock reached up to brace his forearm to his lower abdomen and keep him still. He released him with a pop, only to lick his way teasingly down the shaft and back to return his ministrations.
“It says here that the best cure for a hangover is a culmination of greasy food, caffeine, a cold shower, exercise, or even energy drinks if available. Namely water, though, of course.”
Then John’s hand was gripping his hardening erection inside of his pants, and any upper hand he hoped he had had suddenly collapsed. “Thrilled,” John growled, his other hand reaching up to thread into Sherlock’s hair and
“Electromagnetism,” RJ replied, almost stumbling over the word. He didn’t seem to want to elaborate, only watch the ship with wide, wondering eyes. He was bobbing excitingly on his feet. “Wanna see it go?”
He couldn’t meet his gaze, the anger beating at his face tangibly. “Me,” he replied, eyes trained everywhere other than the man just meters in front of him.
John didn’t realize when the car began moving again, too caught up in the words still ringing in his ear. Sherlock had killed before? Thoughts of Stansex came to mind, of the legend Mary told, the dismembering of a body and the devouring of blood. Visions so strong he could practically smell the copper tang in the air. He closed his eyes for a brief reprise, tilting his head back against the headrest.
did he care that much? Memories came spilling in with such force, unwanted and full of remembered heat.
John to be upset. To be his awkward, avoidance-prone self, to not meet Sherlock’s eyes and to act like this wasn’t nothing.
Sherlock laughed at that. “Is that your professional hypothesis?”
The head engineer pursed his lips. “I would’ve heard if there was any sort of accident, doctor,” he said slowly. “Are you positive?”
he repeats. He puts a hand on John’s shoulder, as if to steady himself, but it only brings him close enough for John to feel his exhale, to smell his sweat, to see the drowsy pull of his pupils that seem to suck away the pale luminescence of his iris like a black hole.
,” Sherlock read aloud, using a handkerchief to wipe the green off his arm as he stood. “He had just turned thirty-eight the day he passed. You said that you were twenty at the time?”
“Here we go,” Mike breathed, something akin to excitement in his voice. John furrowed his eyebrows, torn between confusion and awe. Up close, this
it happens, it’s for them. No one else.
“Are you still in need for a flatmate?”
“We’re not talking about Mary.”
Sherlock hummed under his breath, and then held up his bare hands. “Please put latex gloves on me.”
.” He scoffed the word, but he seemed more cranky than genuinely pissed at this point. John, breathlessly, shook his head in disbelief.
John feels like he’s in the bloody ‘Sound of Music’, but it’s fine. It’s all fine. Their friends are happy and singing off-key and swaying against each other, still nursing the freshly-poured champagne they’re saving for the first few seconds after midnight. Mike’s one of the ones singing along, and he leans too far into John’s space to jostle him expectantly. John rolls his eyes, but adds in, reluctantly,
Sherlock’s lips twitched. “There is some relation.” He released John’s hand, and took a step back to his own side of the platform to lean against the post. John’s head tilted in confusion.
“Mike,” the bundle of dark curls greeted, turned away from the pair and hunched over an experiment. His voice rang like music, a tangible chime in the words despite his deep baritone, and
Sector A, the governing body of the free world, however, was in a completely different distinction of its own. When John read the letter itself, the ice sank lower and lower into his abdomen. “Oh,” he repeated hoarsely.
Over the next few weeks, the dream repeated in regular intervals. He blamed the car incident, possibly the stress having flared up his PTSD, but he wasn’t too sure if that was the true underlying cause. He was afraid to look into the hidden meaning behind the dream; he already knew that his mental health was far too gone to be helped.
supposed to know?” John demands with a fling of his hands, gesturing vaguely in Sherlock’s direction. “You… The first time we met, you told me that women aren’t your area. But then, after that, you saved Irene doing god knows what else, you spent
that he’s asking Sherlock if he can move back in, not after… well,
ME: Hm. Anyway.
He was dragging this out. “Which is…?” John asked expectantly.
“I can’t,” John says helplessly.
The boy’s face fell, his fiddling starting to slow. “I don’t know.”
He didn’t burst through 221B’s door. Rather, he creaked it open with deliberate slowness, as if he was leaning all of his weight onto it. When he closed it behind him, he leaned against it. Sherlock wanted him to slide down it until only his head was propped, akin to that day nearly three years ago (he had stopped counting by the exacts; he had let it slip to Mrs. Hudson before his death, and all he had earned was a pitying ‘Oh, Sherlock’). John held steady, relatively speaking.
ME: When was the last natural birth officiated?
“Yes, fine. Was it with a woman, or another man?”
“I don’t know. Is it working?’
John looked up at the sun from where it was buried beneath the clouds, scoffing under his breath. “Oh, the standard. Short, blonde, pretty, runs a bed-and-breakfast over in the moors.” He grinned when he looked down and saw the barely-schooled frown on his friend’s face. “Why are you asking? Are you jealous?”
Sherlock emerged with a couple room keys, somehow making his hop back into the driver’s seat full of grace. He handed one over to John. “One room, two doubles, fifth floor. There were hardly any rooms left, what with it being summertime and Plymouth being beachside, so it’s reserved until Monday morning.” He huffed out a sigh at John’s expression. “I’m not saying we’ll still be here, it’s merely a precaution.”
“Second only to me,” John pointed out. Pulling in for an embrace, he wrinkled his nose when he caught whiff the other man’s curls. “Sherlock, no offense intended, but you smell like a dirty alley.”
Even though the sun was out earlier, the sky was far from cloudless. It really wasn’t a surprise. “Fine by me, as long as you eat half of it. I’ll look through the telly for a pay-per-view.” He paused, fingers toying with the remote. “Say, Sherlock- if I invited you to a lake tomorrow evening with me and a group of people from the village, would you go?”
Closing his eyes and letting his fingers grasp at the bridge of his nose, John felt something with the weight of a rock drop in his stomach. God help him.
“What you said. That I was the only one between us two with the ‘capacity to break any hearts’.” The dreary glow of the sky made Sherlock’s skin even paler and near-luminescent, heavy clouds littering soft raindrops into his curls. He kept his dark eyes straight ahead, nonchalant. “It’s untrue. Grievously so.”
“Wait, wait,” John interrupted, an understanding dawning in the back of his mind, one that he wasn’t quite fond of. “I was under the impression we were simply leaving through the same exit the rail took. You’re not suggesting that we jump on the outside of the train and hitch a ride to the outside, surely?”
John’s laughs dimmed. “Ah… I don’t know.”
“We found a body off the southern bank of the Brent Reservoir, been here awhile and not in the most recognizable of shapes. We can’t make heads or tails with it. How fast can you get here?”
“What have you come here for, John?” Sherlock had to ask, unable to keep the tearful edge from his voice. He wasn’t crying, but he might as well have been. “Came to yell, scream, sleep off a hangover?” Beside himself, Sherlock began to walk, closing the distance between them. When he was just a step away, he leaned down to level their eyes in a last-ditch effort to protect the little sense of self-preservation that he still had. He hoped he looked menacing. He knew he looked wounded. “Why. Are. You. Here?”
ME: I see you believe yourself to be a person. Fascinating.
“At least you warned me about the violin playing,” he says carefully. Might as well push everything out to the open. “You didn’t know about the anger problems, the unexpected baby crying at all hours of the night, the wife who tried to murder you…”
It is a simple fact, not an opinion nor any sort of half-arsed claim, that Sherlock Holmes is a passionate man that feels things in a potent, all-encompassing way.
But, for once, Sherlock didn’t comment on John’s idiocy. “No questions. Odds are, they’ll recognize me anyway, but… please. William Scott. Alright?”
Their hands never move away, or closer. It's simultaneously 'enough' and 'too little' and John wants to drown beneath it all.
It took John a minute to process the question. “Yeah,” he said, shaking himself out of it. Blinking down at the empty cup in his hands, he tossed it in the bin and spared a glance back up, but the man -Sherlock Holmes- was gone.
And you knew all of that from observing?”
“You’re right, it’s not. But it’s… okay, to me. Probably not to anyone else, though.”
Instead: “’Territory of the stone’. It’s an old myth, a legend I’m sure you’d remember if given the right reminder. A legend that may have some merit, might I add. Lovely town, if a bit small. The smell of wet moss clung to me for days afterwards. When we go there tomorrow, I have a rather odd request.”
It's not as if he had more than one frame of reference. His lips quirked. “Not at all.”
“Accept,” John muttered automatically. He felt the little chip in the back of his brain whir to life, uncomfortably, and begin its download.
Sherlock looked almost sad, if not for the upward tilt of his mouth. “Quite right.”
“Yes.”
ashamed of the martyrdom. How many times does he have to make Sherlock defend John to
John rolls his eyes. “Just because she says ‘anytime’ doesn’t mean that I’m free to unload my daughter at a moment’s notice. She needs some warning, at least.”
that’s the part you’d focus on! I’m not always out to insult your intelligence, you’re aware.”
“No, the files I’ve read are confusing. They talk in code most of the time. I’ve been reading the energy numbers, and it just didn’t make sense.”
Sherlock looked at him sharply. "I won't let you die," he said seriously. Further away, lights began to flash as the rail began to leave the station. John found nothing but sincerity in his eyes, and he felt himself give a brisk nod in response. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, thoughtful, and with a jerk of his own head he turned back around and fell back into a crouch. Tension strung back into his body like a taut wire.
Dimmock didn’t know how to respond to the rant, minutely taking a step back. “Er… no?” he tried.
, that cupid’s bow drawn as if from an artist’s impeccable hand.
As the sun lowered in the sky, it set its shine directly against the windshield. Though the glass was tinted heavily enough, John nevertheless lowered his billfold to keep the glare from his eyes. Sherlock practically glowed in the dim light, so pale and opaque like he was soaking up the sunshine like a moon. He offered his sunglasses, but John declined.
John nodded again. “Yes, I’ll go outside with you. Definitely. What’s your plan?”
John swallows. “Any songs stored away up in that brain?” He says to change the subject. “Something I’d recognize?”
Mrs. Hudson gave both of them a curious glance, before letting out a gasp to totter into the kitchen and finish what Sherlock started amidst the sound of spattering bacon. The pair didn’t move.
Sherlock cocks his head, a near-reptilian move. “I thought the purple one was your favorite?”
“The summer solstice banquet! It’s next Friday, and it’s always a lot of fun. I was hoping that we could go together.” Her smile was warm, so unlike Molly’s awkward invitation. Regardless, John felt that same discomfort.
And all of this could be blamed on the virus from the twenty-first century. Some said it was mother Earth, retaliating from the filth humans left on her surface. Others believed it to be a transmitted illness from animals, like rats in the Bubonic plague. As infertility spread its venom to oxygenating plants and the rest of the animal kingdom, there was probably never going to be a right answer.
John hummed and watched him, and then watched the cars pass by. Surely it would’ve been faster to hail a cab, but Sherlock seemed unbothered and John was a professional at waiting, at this point.
“Good morning, then,” he said again, though this time genuine.
John weighed his chances. If he helped, he would definitely get in trouble. Maybe even put on some sort of probation, if the charge was serious enough. Was it really worth it?
If in the flesh I'd travel there,
“And you?”
“No, keep playing,” John starts, shuffling forward so he’s not some ghost haunting the edges. “It’s lovely.”
“Let me,” he said, beginning to lean forward to undo John’s belt himself.
Anthea kept silent, only holding the clinic’s door open for him.
watchalong, by the way. Owe her, rather.”
“Three questions,” Sherlock began, once John felt himself swimming into consciousness. He could understand language, which was obviously a good sign. “You may ask me three questions, and then we never speak of today again. Agreed?”
“What?”
Sherlock’s lips twitch, and he softens. “John,” he murmurs, “will you-”
Sherlock’s already flushing, and the pulsating neon glow around them definitely gives a valiant (but futile) effort in hiding the fact. They are currently nursing their graduated-cylinders’-worth of drinks in this rainbow-fond establishment, and many of the patrons passing by the bar have never heard of modesty, it seems.
Suddenly, nothing else in the world mattered except that. “Okay,” John answered simply.
“Oh, wonderful! That means John and I can have some fun.” He closed his eyes for a brief moment as if bracing himself, and then slid off the surgical mask. John’s seen this all before. His nose was straight and slightly upturned, and his lips were full and bowed drastically at the top. He was unbelievable. John never stood a chance, either.
“But, ah, the victim is.”
Sherlock texted their whereabouts to Lestrade, and gestured at the dumpster. John closed his mouth and shifted into military stance, hand reaching behind his back to the gun in his waistband. As always, Sherlock felt a rush of something pleasurable along his spine at the sight, but he pushed it away as best as he could. He reached for the lid.
John paused, wary at Mike’s odd tone. “Yeah, I did. Any ideas?”
“I was thinking of goin’ upstairs, sleepin’ all this off,” John muttered hesitantly. “Is that, well, I mean, would that be…”
John hissed impatiently, using his grip to both tug their hips flush against each other and yank Sherlock’s head back to nibble at his neck. Sherlock winced, but he was
The guitar trails off into something lighter, the pick being replaced instead by the gentle plucking of his fingertips. Sherlock studies John. “You were more aggressive,” he decides, “while inversely being more carefree, more willing to let the world happen around you. An odd combination. I was much more insufferable than I already am, back in the day; a meeting would have ended in either a curious friendship or a bloody nose on my part.”
A sign passed his eyes in the dying light, weathered with time. Highgate Cemetery. He was in Waterlow Park, he realized with surprise. This graveyard was a stark contrast to the one he visited yesterday morning – much more modern, and much darker than the pleasant clearing in Dartmoor. Almost sinister, here. He remembered vaguely that it was supposedly haunted, but he (possibly) roomed with a vampire – he could handle anything. He still missed the weight of his gun at his back, but he was nothing tonight if not reckless. He walked through the gates without a look back.
ME: No matter, I have a meeting with my brother and the Baskerville administration to express my findings. Mycroft doesn’t know whether to be proud I’m putting my brain to work on something “useful”, in his words, or wary that I’m more involved in his projects than before. Nevertheless, this will give them something to think about.
Though, unsurprisingly, the most attractive part of John Watson was how loyal he was to Sherlock, alongside his unexpected intelligence. Leave it to Sherlock to feel his mouth go dry when John slipped into doctor mode, or whenever he let show how fiercely protective he could be. And now, after months of dormancy interrupted only by cases and alongside growing friendship, John didn’t seem… opposed to a repeat performance of that first drunken night.
Yeah. What a ride.
“What do you need me to do, then?” John asked, chin up and stance straightening into something automatic.
John barked out a laugh. “Yeah, good luck with that.”
“You ever seen a dead body before?” He asked.
“I kept him busy,” she said with a wink, inconspicuously straightening her blouse. When she breezed by John, she smelled like a thick, cloying perfume. At least to him.
It’s silent. When John finally looks up to meet Sherlock’s eyes, he’s surprised to find the other man staring him down with quiet disappointment. There’s also a sense of bewilderment there, as if he just saw a third arm spontaneously sprout from John’s head. “You’re serious, aren’t you?”
“Hello boys,” Captain Greg Lestrade announced through the glass, arms crossed and eyebrow quirked. “Fancy seeing you both here.”
Rosie’s just been put to bed. John descends the stairs carefully, quietly, even though she could sleep through a world war without waking up. The lingering smell of garlic sticks to his clothes and the walls; it’s going to be a few days until it airs out completely. Downstairs, there’s the sound of running water.
John fell forward, bracing his hands on Sherlock’s shoulder, and his face twisted into something terribly vulnerable. “Sh-Sher-”
“Patience, John,” the hunter sang, voice smooth as honey. The baser of John’s instincts told him to run, even when the rest of his body urged him to yield. It wasn’t his fault; the damn monster was built precisely to lure him in.
ME: Do you believe yourself to have a consciousness?
“Brilliant,” John murmured against his lips. After a moment of shared breath, John released them both with careful movements and grabbed a paper towel to clean them up. He turned around to wash his hands in the sink, and Sherlock couldn’t help himself. “Never happening again, right?”
“’M awake,” John mumbled, rubbing at his eyes. He had dozed off in his armchair to the sound of London traffic, his neck stiff from the too-low headrest. “Where’ve you been?”
ME: …
“No,” he says.
Sherlock blinks up at him. Rosie babbles, fighting against Sherlock’s hand that’s securing her from falling. “John,” he says, “I may be a genius, but—”
He wonders why Sherlock never blames him.
“We’re done here,” Sherlock said, annoyance in his voice. But that didn’t mean anything, he was annoyed most times.
“Yes,” John sighed, grinding his hips up into Sherlock’s arse where he was straddled. For a man as intoxicated as John, he seemed to have no problem maintaining an erection of his own. Sherlock leaned down just enough to brace his hands on John’s shoulders, and he gave another experimental roll of his hips.
He turned to meet John’s eyes again, but this time they were wide with expectancy. That seemed to be the Sherlockian equivalent to pleading.
distinctly
He rolls his eyes. “It’s hardly come up in-”
“What?” Sherlock questioned.
the vacuum cleaner even is. Maybe Sherlock knows. Would that be a good enough excuse to talk to him tonight?
John nodded. Somehow, working with the police to help catch criminals suited Sherlock to the ground. “I’ve always wanted to be a police officer,” he mused. “Chase teenagers, write tickets, occasionally get to tase dangerous civilians. Not too bad of a gig.” He shrugged. “Before I went into the medical field that is. It was a dream, anyways.”
“Sherlock!” John’s voice broke into his thoughts, and he felt him stumble into his shoulder. “Why’d you stop?”
“I love you,” Sherlock said.
“Hello, John,” Sarah said with a smile. Her eyes flickered to Sherlock, who hadn’t even turned in acknowledgement and seemed wholly disinterested in the unexpected visitor. She held a bright pink post-it in her hand. “To Sherlock’s pleasure, actually.”
John wants to ask him why he’s cleaning, why he doesn’t fight John on anything anymore. But what comes out of his mouth instead is: “This is about Mary, isn’t it?”
John had his breath back, he supposed. “Yes. It’s just, well, can you go a bit easy-”
John snorted. “I won’t!”
“Play us a song,” Greg says, before Sally can flounder for a reply to the ever-rare Holmesian compliment.
There was a pause, obviously Mycroft’s surprise. He didn’t know whether it was from Sherlock’s words, or the fact that he had voiced them. “In that he replies with anger where you would with forgiveness, when dealing with the other,” he corrected hesitantly. Mycroft was hardly ever hesitant. “I wouldn’t be so sure about your answer, Sherlock. Raw fury and seeming hatred can be just as telling as open arms.”
“John,” he said, voice cracking. “I’m happy you’re here.”
“Goodnight, my love,” he says. Beside her, the rapid pulse fluttering at Sherlock’s throat matches John’s own, and he squints up to meet Sherlock’s eyes, the overhead light behind his head bright and fuzzy like a halo. Rosie is readjusted to fit more snugly against his side.
“110,” he murmured to himself, strolling down the endless hallway to familiarize himself with his room’s location. It wasn’t too far down, but when he reached the cubby, a familiar head poked out of the one adjacent.
Winces at his knees, so he has to shift until he’s fully seated on the floor. Sherlock’s back rises and falls steadily, and after everything, that’s what strikes John the most. That Sherlock’s back rises and falls. It doesn’t feel real, with the events of the last several years, that he’s still able to do that. John’s hand moves on its own accord.
It was so quiet, Sherlock staring straight ahead, that John thought the conversation was over. It was a surprise when he heard: “When did your father pass away?”
He devolved into a string of gibberish, until John realized that he was giving sailors a run for their money in either Russian or a very aggressive dialect of French. His face was still murderous, but he wasn’t warring with ‘the monster within’ anymore, the revelation seeming to ground him to the present and away from swerving around and ripping out a line of throats. But still… something didn’t add up.

John searched his thoughts for a face, and came up empty. “Nope, don’t believe so.”
poncy.”
“Overall a successful morning,” John says, having bought a cloth bag currently bulging with all of his purchases. He’s delightfully content, stomach full but not yet bursting at the seams. It’s one of those simple moments, so warm and comfortable that John has to make more of an effort
The smile dropped, and Sherlock almost looked puzzled. “I…”
Sherlock froze, looking for an instant like an actual statue frozen in time. Only, in a few moments, his face morphed from incredulous shock into some sort of quiet outrage. “You… You think I

John only smiled, scrubbing a hand over his slight stubble. He was just reaching for the newspaper when there was a tap at the door.

Sherlock spun them around at that, awkward and bony but successful when he got John underneath him and pressed their foreheads together. His hands reached up to trail at the emerging wetness on John’s cheeks, gentle as his hips pushed and pulled. “John,” he whispered, cradling his face. “John, John, John.”
Sherlock was the first to crack, his lips twitching. John followed immediately after. All at once, the air devolved into giggles.
“Nothing I can’t miss,” he replied immediately. There wasn’t an inch of doubt in his eyes.
John blinks up in surprise, eyebrows raising. Sherlock’s expression is soft, a mischievous smile nudging at his eyes and lips, and a light pink flush paints his cheekbones. Déjà vu. John licks his lips.
expression on such a radiant man. Not even his eyes, the turbulent pools that were always his most telling feature, showed his distress that must be drowning him from inside.
Sherlock snorts. “I hardly have to deduce you anymore,” he says. “I know you too well. I can tell, at the very least, that you’ve certainly bought nothing for yourself. You would never go to a shopping area with a wallet full without purchasing something for me and Rosie. Obviously. In fact, I’d venture to say that there’s even something for Mrs. Hudson in that bag.”
“Come on then, I’ll bring you to the boss so he can have a look at you, see if you’re good to go. But I’m sure he remembers you.”
John felt as if he was talking about a potential girlfriend with his mother, but he just kept his smile polite. “Yes, well. He’s very brilliant.”
Sherlock shook his head, long fingers toying with a chip. “It’s easier to read family members, having grown with the person’s mannerisms. While I have a certain affinity for deduction, it seems to come to a halt whenever involving you. It's... odd.” He takes a careful sip of his water. “If anything, you’re a closed book with a padlocked cover.”
John reached up on his tiptoes to knock their foreheads together. “Home,” he agreed.
John closed his eyes, mustering the restraint he hoped to god he still had. “Don’t,” he managed.
John took a step towards him. And then another. A few more. A hair’s breadth away, body more cold than warm in such a state. “Sherlock,” he said, quietly. “No, it’s not.”
What was this, high school?
this man is. I’ll be sure to keep my distance, then.”
The words Sherlock shouldn’t care about, the ones that some part of him wasn’t dreading to hear. He tried to shake it off, tilting his head back down to the microscope. But, for the oddest reason, the fact that what happened last night would
“Nonsense. Hop up, let me see.”
Sherlock shook his head. “He doesn’t go by a name,” he said. “He’s an AI, and at age 8 he altered his own mind to adjust his learning curve. Usually that’s frowned upon, but given the genius and skill he administered while doing it, the ICAM was itching to have him.” The boy darted his eyes back up to the pair, and then immediately back down. “He broke into system records around the same time to completely swipe his own file of information. He doesn’t talk very much, most people just call him ‘Thirteen’.”
