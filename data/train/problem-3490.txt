Jensen’s phone lights up in the middle of the night.
young! Jensen cracks his old man neck. If he decided to just work out a little more he’s pretty sure he can get like, twentysomethings thirsting in his DMs on Instagram. He’s young! He’s fresh! Forty is the new twenty, the new puberty even!
But Cas pays his protest no mind. He holds Dean’s forearm with one hand, clamping down on it like a prison chain. With his other hand, he unwraps the towel slowly.
“Dean, cuddling is not gay.”
There’s not even a spare minute to answer as Dean is whisked away by a scrawny PA and pushed into a tall but wonky folding chair. Another, smaller camera is pointed at it, parked next to a stylish man with a bow tie and side-combed hair.
Cas is silent the rest of the drive.
They are standing in the bunker’s basement, with Death literally knocking on the blood-covered door, and Dean is all out of ideas.
She wraps her arms around his neck. “Daddy!”
against Dean’s backside. Dean can feel the hard outline of Cas’ dick tenting his briefs, grazing against Dean’s rear.
? Oh yeah, Dean remembers — isn’t that some gay channel? It’s sometimes on in the tv room in the bunker, for inexplicable mystical reasons. Cursed, probably.
more than five times already and cried each time.”
He rubs them ruefully at the memory.
It’s just that he hasn’t slept much.
Cas frowns. “Well that doesn’t sound very…”
Even the most realistic painting will not suffice.
“The nose is very weird,” French beret guy says a little too loud from his seat across the room, and Dean’s head snaps. He’s about ready to throw punches again.
“Yes.”
There is only one bed.
Cas looks at her, then quickly back at Dean.
Oh no, he shouldn't think of this as a first kiss, just, you know,
I knew demons existed, sure. Vampires. Weres. Freaks galore. And I’d seen so much damn suffering that I couldn’t even believe in the good parts anymore, not on earth, not in heaven, not even in
If it wasn’t for Sam and Jack, he’d be dead.
Suddenly, it became so easy to say it.
real world — Dean can’t be bisexual because of market research, or Walker ratings or whatever, but this is Dean’s actual life. He doesn’t need a network stamp of approval. He’s nobody’s red-blooded American hetero hero.
Underneath the words, there’s a little box.
Here goes nothing.
Dean thinks about Rhonda Hurley and the way she smiled while she made him try on the underwear, eyes half lidded and drunk with lust. They were young, and experimenting, and having —  pretty damn good if Dean says so himself — heterosexual sex.
“Look, we’ll get through this, okay bud?” Dean whispers.
Dean watches Cas go, quietly.
The Empty seems to ripple. It glimmers and expands and retreats, and slowly slips into the face of Meg.
Cas stood with his body pressed to the door, lurking through a crack. “False alarm. I was wrong, he’s not here after all.”
He walked closer, coattails flapping like some sort of superhero cape. But it honestly didn’t even feel cool to kill Kansas. Let alone worth the paperwork. Weren’t they going to die soon anyway?
“Thing is, when you discovered your humanity, I’d already lost mine. I was a burnt and broken shell of a man.”
Dean blinks quickly. “Are you ashamed?”
Well, boo hoo. Dean cracks his neck. He can do this. He can.
The entire tip of Dean’s dick is now fully exposed. And then, as he thrusts back up, he - oh, finally, finally - softly bumps himself into Cas’ stomach, slippery with precum. Cas lets out a feral moan. The angel pulls Dean down, grinding his hips with urgency and desperation.
“It’s just a flesh wound, I was cooking… I’ll just go to the medicine cabinet…”
painful, but Dean is trembling like a newborn puppy.
Cas starts carding his fingers through Dean’s hair, and Dean can’t tear his eyes away from the angel. Holy fuck. How are they going to look each other in the eye again without remembering this? Be normal friends? Dean brushes the thought away like a stray hair. Worry ‘bout that later.
This is ridiculous.
“Dean, it’s
He does, too.
When they hear the door upstairs slam close, Dean flinches.
Dean’s jaw clenches. It’s suddenly so clear now.
Real-time living through the Supernatural experience is actually quite boring, Jensen discovers. It’s a long drive back.
“Just helping you catch up,” Jack smiles.
CASTIEL
Dean does not think either of them is breathing now. Though Cas has spoken in a neutral, flat tone, his form betrays him - even in the shadows - it’s very tense.
that’s tricky, but special thanks to your witch bitch brother for that.”
Claire stares him down. Then, comprehension dawns on her face. “You’re in love with him.”
Was he supposed to turn down
It’s just, the author somehow tricked him into picking all the Dean answers. Like a queer trickster.
Nope. This just ain’t it, this universe. Got it all upside down.
Except it doesn’t sound like a joke.
“Don’t do this, Dean,” Cas says, a hesitation in his voice, almost desperation.
remember?
Lady, what?
“That’s not true.”
Dean, however, doesn’t think he has a voice anymore. Fuck. This is all Sam’s fault.
Oh no. Dean feels extra bad now. Once again he has ruined Jensen Ackles’s reputation. That organ trade thing was probably a rough patch.
“Fuck. I love you, too, Cas.”
, just loving someone and owning up to it, was all the happiness you could achieve?”
He puts one hand on his knee, but soon comes to regret that decision when his elbow starts shaking.
It’s a simple, natural movement.
“Yes.”
Sam looks up to the ceiling, as if to pray, but the god above? Even less experienced in matters of the heart, unfortunately.
“Let’s take a break tonight, guys,” he says. “We’re close to solving this thing anyway. We deserve some time off. How about we watch a movie?”
He shot two fleeing musicians in the back. “Don’t worry, there’ll be peace when you are done.”
His ribs jut out like piano keys.
No. This is different. It’s Dean and he’s seen Cas
But Cas flinches away.
“Yes,” Cas says, tilting his head.
Oh no, wait, this is not a masculine gesture. Dean immediately uncrosses them. Wouldn’t wanna look even more gay than he already looks, fully clothed assessing a naked man.
“What movie?” Jack asks.
Christ. That thermostat sure is blazing Dante’s inferno style in here. Too damn hot.
“No, I mean…” Jensen sighs. “You could have given me a head’s up, you know.”
He then discovers to his embarrassment that he’s been clenching his buttcheeks this whole time.
“Don’t overthink your poses, Steve,” pastor Richard says. “Just pick what’s comfortable.”
suitable for a date. But he is glad he got him to unbutton it a little.
Oh wow. Another universe? Let’s get the priorities straight.
He shifts his attention back to his phone and reads:
But those thighs. Hard not to notice those thighs, even as a straight guy.
“Just…” Dean says, before closing the door. “
Dean sighs, frustrated. “Great. Just great.” He tries to put on a brave face. Okay. A few hours; how bad can that get?
Sorry, Dean. The words of the prophets are written on ao3.
His eyes are a darker blue than Sam remembers Cas having.
Dean’s died so many times. Been captured and tortured. He’s had to pull love-eyes at dogs. He’s been locked in a room with 20,000 bees. He’s crawled out of his own grave. He went to hell, to
“Huh,” Dean thinks about his bed in the bunker. Cas is currently sitting in the exact spot that would be his, if they were, you know. Sleeping together. “You’re good, Cas.”
“Jack is innocent. It was Billie, she flung him in here,” Dean says. “He was just the bomb. The… instrument.”
Cas looks away. “Have some mercy. You’ve killed me a thousand times in my dreams already. Let me stay dead.”
Cas washing his grimy chest clean in some stream they found in Purgatory.
Dean. Dean is him.
Something twists inside Cas. It wasn’t like that.
He thumbs through the results. There’s all sorts of weirdness. Oh, one where Cas makes him a hot chocolate? Sounds sweet - damn, wait, what?
“I can’t do this anymore, Dean.”
“It’s just…” Kevin swallows. Dean thanks the gods, the angels, the devil even, whatever, the whole damn universe that Sam’s asleep already. “It’s just that, I was wondering about the things those fans pick up from the Carver Edlund books.”
Holy shit.
He steps back from the wall. It’s a bit eerie, actually, since all these women disappeared recently. Like finding nude pics at an estate sale. Is it ethical to uh, see dead people naked?
Cas holds onto his pillow and takes it, god, he takes it
“Why did you give me this job?” He despaired.
Dean frowns at Cas. Wait? It
He fucks into Cas like a hammer. Fuck. Fuckkk. He moves his right hand into Cas’ hair, then to the front of Cas’ head, along his cheeks, like a blind man finding his way home. He grazes Cas’ lips, and almost as a reflex Cas opens his mouth.
That whole reunion had been… a little awkward, really. Sam had hugged Cas tightly, thrilled to see his friend safe. But behind him, Dean had just quietly stared at Cas.
Dean scoffs, but walks over. He sits down, legs spread and elbows leaning on knees. He lets out another shaky breath, absentmindedly rubbing his lips.
Sam sighs.
Cas blinks, then closes his mouth determinedly.
“... that it’s
“Why don’t you lot come inside?” John says. “Mary’s almost done with dinner.”
“...I cared about the whole world, because of you. You changed me Dean..."
That’s okay, because he’s wide awake anyway. It’s been another late shoot on the Supernatural set because monsters don’t exactly come out in daylight.
Cas frowns and Dean remembers he already doesn’t trust computers.
Oof. His bicep’s straining.
Suddenly, Dean feels very sad for Cas.
this friggn crap
Dean bets that reaper never even told him how handsome he was. His heart breaks a little at that thought.
When Cas turns towards him, he’s all too serious. “Nora hasn’t trusted me again with baby Tanya.”
Oh yeah. Sure they do.
The alarm goes off, but the most alarming thing is that Barb is leaning over and whispering, “Those buns, I could feed my whole family with those.”
They haven’t had to use their free will against demons often. And if they do, it’s mostly easy cases. Nothing world altering or really life threatening. It’s been quite… well, Sam doesn’t like to call it boring. But sometimes he misses the thrill of it all.
Dean slowly shakes his head.
. Dean can see that name strike Cas like a lashing. But he just can’t say Cas right now. All feeling of familiarity must be broken.
“My brother - he’s still out there. He won’t leave you alone for a minute if we don’t come back.”
Jesus, even sitting down looks great on him. Cas’ body is like the sistine friggin’ chapel.
leave, if Dean asks him to.
“Touch yourself, Dean,” Cas orders, panting.
It could unlock all he’s been struggling with.
Dean swallows.
Cas positions himself half behind him, and uses one hand to spread Dean a little more open.
On the other hand, when you work out, you need carbs.
At least, to where he
“Well isn’t this a touching scene,” Chuck’s voice booms from behind them.
Cas bites his lip. “Go on.”
Man up, Dean tells himself. Whatever the hell that means.
?” Dean says, but just then someone taps on his shoulder. It’s the crew member he saw recording on her phone. She hands him the device with a grin.
Thank god there’s nothing sexual about this, though. Not a hint of eroticism.
They are like clay figures pressing into each other to make a new shape.
They stay like this for a while. It’s Cas who breaks the silence.
There’s only the name.
Oh. It’s not exactly the sunlight. It’s someone physically knocking on the trailer door.
Suddenly, Cas shifts a bit. A tiny adjustment, but with big - rather big, yes indeed - consequences. Because now, Cas’ briefs are in direct contact with Dean’s, and…
The wrath of an annoyed ex-angel, who’s currently turned away from him completely, once again relating Dean to the sight of only the expanse of his bare neck.
“I don’t know whatever went down between you two in the bunker,” Sam says, throwing him A Look. “But knowing Cas, whatever fight you had, whatever words were said, it’ll be forgiven.”
“You’ve gone soft,” John says. “You’re not the man I raised.”
Dean doesn’t actually think he remembers the physics of breathing, anymore.
Then, nothing. Just a dripping, human face.
“I was on set during filming just now,” Ben says. “Misha did a tremendous job.”
When Claire suggests they have dinner together, he’s so happy to have a distraction from his never ending thoughts about Dean that it overpowers his instincts.
Something that is a potential and permanent demise.
Dean decides to zoom in on each little pain his body is signaling. Each tickle. Each patch of skin demanding attention.
They. Don’t. Know.
Great.
He lowers his head into his hands. He should’ve questioned every participant of that class. He should’ve tortured pastor Richard for info. He should’ve…
He bites his lip. His head is impossibly, simultaneously full and empty.
Dean’s fingers clasp onto Cas’ nude skin until he feels his eyes prickle.
“What?”
“Yeah, I’m about to pop.”
“Cas, we’ll miss you,” Sam helps. “You know you are welcome to stay here as long as you like.”
Dean bites his bottom lip.
“A tulpa?”
The pencil dips further down. Then, halts.
Sam almost looks away, that’s how intimate it looks, his brother and the angel, skin on skin.
Dean spreads Cas further and suddenly his whole finger is inside, and Cas makes another, more urgent, desperate whine. Oh, Dean needs to hear
Richard frowns. “You’re not getting sick or anything, right? You sound hoarse.”
Except, no he isn’t, not if Dean has anything to do with it.
True. No longer calls him an abomination. But plenty of people like Sam, what’s not to like? He’s Sammy.
She shakes his hand warmly.
ON CASS. Emotional. Tears in his eyes, but they’re tears of happiness. Joy shines on his face. Dean is his sun.
He slams the script shut, and a separate note drifts out from the pages. Dean reaches down and takes it. The words are handwritten.
All of Dean’s loved ones showed up. Dean turned to them, clearly moved by their presence by evidence of moisture in his eyes, Cas noticed proudly. Dean greeted Jo, Eileen, Bobby, Garth and his family, Claire … Oops, somehow John Winchester’s invitation got lost in the mail. Oh well. Nothing that could be done about that now!
Jensen takes a deep breath. “Okay, bear with me. We got the scripts for the final episodes and like, it’s ridiculous. They barely mention you and Jack, and never even talk about all of Dean and Sam’s found family, you know?”
Damn it, Cass. Don’t tell me we’re not gonna talk about this because seriously, you can’t drop a bomb like that on me, and Houdini outta here and expect me to not… I did a lot of thinking. I mean, the world was friggin’ empty while you were in the Empty and that was a lot to deal with. Suddenly I had a lot of time to think, you know.
Dean cracked a small smile. “No, it’s okay dude. I’m human. Mortality’s kind of part of the deal.”
The angel looks pale as a ghost!
Jensen will simply have to go into hiding. Go live in the mountains and become a recluse who trudges through snow and shoots black and white videos just like that good little singer, Taylor Swift.
Dean’s tongue suddenly feels like a heavy slab of meat in his mouth. Cas didn’t know? He’s… not aware of the missing people?
“Well, Sam, as the designated witch…”
The dude can be really fucking thoughtful.
He passes out from exhaustion.
Dean smiles reassuringly while he turns on the bedside lamps. When he turns off the main lamp, he can’t help but notice how it changes the way the shadows fall on Cas’ naked chest. The former angel’s definitely not as ripped as some writers would have him believe. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t handsome or anything, Dean doesn’t like it when men are too muscled anyway. Cas is kind of perfect, actually.
“No! I’m acting
The whole world is empty. Cas is in the Empty but also the
“So that’s weird that she asked you to babysit, huh?” Dean says, locating the extra toothbrush and pulling it out triumphantly. “Ha!”
We’ll take it from the
“Do you need a dinosaur bandaid or something?” Sam says loudly.
“Family? Bobby is family, Castiel. You were a convenient weapon of mass destruction to us. Though a very annoying one at times. Sam and I often complained how hard it was to put up with you.”
“Kevin!” Dean hisses.
Cas walks up to Dean, who’s still holding onto his side as if he’s drowning and it’s a piece of wood floating in the ocean.
Then for the first time, Cas speaks.
Richard checks his clipboard. “Okay, we already shot the black goo bit. And since it’s Misha’s last day on set, we’re shooting the Carry On sex scene after lunch. Break!”
Dean lets him. He doesn’t let himself breath, as if filling lungs with oxygen will somehow break the mood they’ve set here
Cas is staring at him intently, looking a little grumpy. Sam, who was in the process of taking the dvd out of the player under the tv, turns his head to look at them, frowning.
He sure hopes Barb hasn’t watched
Cas turns to her so she can read his lips. “I don’t know yet. There’s a whole world to see, people to meet. I might visit heaven. Jack offered me a job when he first saved me...”
“Yeah, you couldn’t see it, that day you pulled me out. You were a foolish little queer angel. They were right. The minute you laid a hand on me in hell, you were lost. The very touch of me corrupted. ’Cause yeah…. I’ve always asked myself, if you’d seen all of my soul, how come you had missed those very darkest bits?”
They drive back to the bunker in stubborn silence.
“I couldn’t have written it better myself. Dean here interrupted Cas’ heartfelt speech - twelve years of repression, pouring out so beautifully - to call him a faggy fruity angel.”
“Cas, hear me out, please.” Jensen tries to think fast. “I’m —I wanted to talk to you. I’ve been praying to you, every night. I’m not sure why you haven’t come seen me but—”
“I didn’t
He straightens his back and gets a virgin piece of paper ready, avoiding the man onstage at all costs.
“Cas,” he forces the word out as if each letter burns his tongue.
“Wearing pink lace panties”. What the—
Weren’t there actual wars fought over this? Cas’ beauty is biblical.
He glances up at the angel. Cas’s eyes are still pinned to Dean like he’s determined to win a one-man staring contest.
Dean frowns. Did the phone accidentally glitch when it fell and switch over to some intense math test?
Sam draws his brows. "Cas is stuck in the Empty, Dean. And frankly I think it’s about time we stop going to food festivals and start planning the rescue.”
The next morning, Dean realises fics are a whole ass lie. He doesn’t wake up all tangled up in Cas’ limbs. Cas is not breathing softly on him while his erection pokes against Dean’s leg. Dean is not lost in the maze of Cas, they’re not inseparable like a pair of damn phone charger wires. None of that sappy crap. Cas is on his own side of the bed and Dean wakes up with drool clinging to the corner of his mouth.
The title is from Taylor Swift’s song Happiness, the full lyric is: No one teaches you what to do / when a good man hurts you
“I didn’t realise you were this… depressed,” Cas says, voice heavy.
There’s no street lights nearby. He’s halfway hidden in the dark.
Cas flashes Sam a disturbed look. Then, the briefest of glances — at Dean.
This startles Cas, who quickly straightens and takes a step back, avoiding both the brothers’ eyes.
John looks stunned. He looks at Claire, Mary, Cas. Then Dean.
go to the roadhouse, Cas thinks stubbornly. He would.
Frantically pacing around as if Cas will just pop up from under the bed, doesn’t help either.
He’s a circle. It doesn’t quite fit.
“So, um,” Sam starts, “What result did you—”
Cas opens his eyes.
And it’s not soft, like Dean imagined it would have been on the show. It’s almost… accusatory.
By the end of the twenty minutes, it’s game over.
Claire is still laughing in the background.
Dean friggin' can’t.
Dean—
He cradles Cas’ face in both his hands now, and feels the angel stir. Cas slowly lifts his arms to hold onto Dean’s elbows, almost shyly. As if asking for permission.
Holyfuckingdoodlefuck.
Dean’s not even sure anymore which ‘he’ the last thought of his is referring to.
Now it’s time for Dean to remain silent.
Dean smirks. “That was clear from your speech.”
“Cas,” Dean exhales.
“...You raised your little brother for love, you fought for this whole world for love, THAT is who you are. You're the most... caring man on Earth…”
“How are you coping, Steve?” Pastor Richard asks.
With no food and a hungry Sammy, scared of the dark.
“He was the. Um. He was the model,” he quickly, quietly says, rubbing his temple.
“Sixteen,” Dean says, finally looking up. Cas hasn’t moved, hands shaking, shock across his little face.
Obviously Dean would still have to be the “man” and be the big spoon.
Dean.
He shouldn’t have put his right hand like that, maybe.
Act cool, act cool.
Cas looks horrified. Well, so is Dean, of course.
“I do owe Cas, you could say...”
That... that couldn’t actually happen, right?
. Until I met you.
But happiness was in the
Next question almost has him tossing the phone against the wall, or better yet, at Sam’s head. If all that hair wouldn’t soften the blow like some party city wig helmet, maybe Dean would actually consider it.
Dean thinks about all the bedsharing fics he’s read. About fictional Dean waking up with fictional Cas all tangled up around his body. How that Cas would nuzzle his nose in that Dean’s neck and it would make all of his hairs stand up and how he’d feel like home, feel strangely safe. And then feel something poking in his back. And then-
But Dean’s mouth feels so, so dry. He looks away. “For... you,” he tells the wooden floor.
Dean closes his eyes and tastes the poet’s words on his tongue, each of them, quietly whispering the different excerpts into the air, feeling them hover between Cas and him.
Dean runs to Baby, opens her trunk and grabs a bottle full.
Suddenly, pastor Richard claps his hands. “People, please take your seats, we’re about to start. I’m going to fetch tonight’s model. As usual, bring your love and kindness to this wonderful person willing to pose for us.”
“Fuck it. I’ll just say it because you deserve to hear it. I love you, too, Cas.”
“Clai—”
Dean nods. God, he hopes she won’t glance at his shit drawings too much. “Right. Michelangelo. Donatello. Raphael. I’m into all that.”
He slowly moves his hand higher until he reaches Cas’ shoulder blades. Stopping at the spot he thinks Cas’ wings must have been.
“Or did you - am I wrong? Did you say it back, Dean?”
A frown appears briefly on pastor Richard’s face. Is he remembering the dead bodies in the freezer?
A pretty face, with — after a lot of failure — a GED. Not smart like Sam.
Dean turns to Cas. “What the hell just happened?”
It’s Kevin.
“Yeah, Sammy! Maybe I’ll like, open a pie shop. Or a bar, you know?”
“They redid the whole thing,” Misha says, stepping inside. “Wow, weird vibe in here.”
Dean stares at the blank space for a long time. Well, he’s not going to ‘skip.’ He’s no pansy.
Until, jarringly, Cas puts a warm, sleepy hand on his wrist. Slowly, Cas drags his thumb over Dean's skin, grounding him.
Some days, Dean wishes he could clone himself, so he could guard Sam and Cas at the same time. To give Cas all of himself instead of also having to worry about anyone else.
Sam blinks at her, surprised.
“Amazing roadhouse,” Sam said, looking fresh for an old corpse.
“One that saw
“The…” Jack frowns. “The moment of true happiness?”
“Please, Dean.” Cas sighs so deeply Dean can feel his hot breath land on the tip of his dick. “Please. Can I.”
Dean can see Jack’s hand curling up into a fist.
Dean shifts in his seat. It’s not easy drawing on a Bible. His right leg is starting to feel a bit numb where the book is being pressed into it.
It’s unclear, that result. Do they think Cas is gay or not?
Dean bites the inside of his lip.
Oh? So she’s alive, then. Jensen nods as if he totally knew that.
Cas’ left hand reaches for the base of Dean’s dick, to keep it in place, to add warmth.
for killing Cas.”
For some reason, his libido has perked up, too. Not that he’s getting any. But he starts getting horny in the weirdest moments now. He’s jizzing more than fake-him does in an average ao3 fic. In the shower. Late at night in bed. Middle of the night in bed. In the morning - well, you get the picture.
blue as the sky after a rainstorm, as plenty of fics have pointed out.
Whatever the title, everyone here’s dressed for Sunday service instead of the Porky’s fan club.
Cas, Jack and Dean drink, smiling to their own private jokes.
This is funny, right? Fun time between friends?
Yeah. He decides he can’t look directly at Cas for fear of
Dean’s observant, okay? He’s got the Artist’s Eye.
The second thing he thinks is:
Granted, he’s had to get used to the idea a bit. He’s just never seen his brother like that, you know? He always thought… apple pie life, you know?
“Why did that lamp just pop then?” Dean says, pointing to the ceiling.
Richard has apparently acquired a bullhorn.
Then, when he did fuck someone completely naked, it was mostly in the dark. The women generally didn’t love doing it with lights on, and Dean didn’t fight them on it.
He has no choice but to read on, of course. To ‘carry on’.
Dean hesitates.
Cas pushes bravely through, and leans forward. Their lips touch, and Dean - well, for one, he doesn’t
, he thinks purposefully in his mind. That’s how it works, right?
Cas considers Novaking John by putting his hand in a pot of boiling water. Instead, he follows them inside and takes a seat at the table, like a polite human guest. Who would never secretly give John a wedgie with his invisible wings.
Cas frowns. “Why did you come here?”
Of course things changed after Jack saved him. And Dean dying was no surprise. Humans are famously limited edition. But this soon? This was unfair —
Finally, the body drops to the floor, an empty shell.
He makes the mistake to look up, to find Cas staring at him again, brow slightly furrowed like a sixth grader trying to solve a maths equation.
Suddenly, Jensen realizes that there aren’t any boxes in the room anymore. Where did the lamb blood go?
Cas sighs. He forces himself to look up. “Please don’t tell him,” he pleads.
He straightens, his back tensing like he’s a whale struggling against a tight fishing net.
Dean’s fingers suddenly itch to try drawing it again and he frowns at them. Now is not the time for art. Cas is pissed.
“Nora invited me over,” Cas recounts, voice monotone. “She said it was hard to find decent men as a single mother.”
The first thing Cas thinks is:
“I…” Cas says. He swallows the rest, and looks up. He’s flayed right open. A tear streaks down his cheek.
Not that he’s checking.
Dean looks at Cas. They’re standing in front of Sam not even feeling a hint of a breeze. Like they’re in the eye of a storm.
Suddenly, a voice sounds from behind Jack.
Dean gets the stink-eye for the full rest of the pose. He gets a few good squiggles down, though. He feels inspired!
“My sex life is not a prophecy!”
Dean feels his face distort in Jack’s hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
. Jensen blows his nose.
Curiously, Dean flips a few pages back. It seems like this show follows their lives pretty closely (except for the romance part, his life is
“Did you tell him?” He asks.
Dean does feel bad for throwing him out of the bunker. He shakes off the guilt - it’s to save Sam, and one day, Cas will surely understand, he’ll explain and it will all be okay again. It’s not like he dumped the guy or something. They do have that profound bond, after all, as the fics keep pointing out between sessions of pounding. Dammit - why did he think about all of that?
Shit.
The door’s already halfway closed again, but Dean puts his foot against it. “Please, let me come in, and I’ll explain.”
Sam clears his throat.
Cas breathes heavily as he jerks himself through the orgasm.
Huh. It’s a quiz.
And also, Dean doesn’t deserve to die like that.
They’re barely able to keep up with the director’s pace as he rushes them to the makeup trailer.
Cas stops abruptly and steps in front of Dean, almost causing a collision of
A man in here is nothing.
Then, almost cartoonishly, a light bulb flickers on in his brain.
because he wants to, and he can, he can touch Cas’ arms, neck, chest. There’s so much to feel, to explore. It’s like there’s an electric current under his finger tips, the very root of life itself. Even now Cas is, while so human, still so graceful, still so full of celestial fire.
But it has kickstarted an unstoppable force in Dean. Like a snowflake rolling down a hill into a huge snowball.
He frowns at Dean and gestures toward Cas, but Dean just glares.
Cas blinks. “He dies?”
Dean still sits frozen next to him.
“What are you talking about?” Dean looks at Cas, and god, he wishes he could just turn the lights back off and disappear.
“What is ‘gross’ exactly?” Cas asks, tilting his head. He feels Dean turn to him. “Enlighten me.”
Right. Once more unto the breach.
Dean opens his eyes through wet lashes. God, he really did fail Jack from his very first minutes on Earth, didn’t he?
Cas could feel the heat of Dean’s quiet presence next to him like a burning fire.
Dean clenches his fist.
“Dean, talk to me.”
How dare he disappear.
Cas sits up, all at once removing all warmth and softness from Dean’s lap. An unwilling sound escapes Dean’s mouth, like someone’s disconnected his oxygen machine or something.
Cas is actually a pretty stand-up guy and anyone, man or woman, would be lucky to have him. He’s super kind. Rebelled against heaven, for fuck’s sake. And he’s just hot, objectively. Otherwise his lookalike Misha Collins wouldn’t get cast on a tv show, right?
Jensen immediately sits up straight in bed, bumping his head on the low overhead of the trailer. Shit. Shouldn’t have bought that second fish tank against everyone else’s advice.
“You should wash this.”
Not this beer, though.
It’s Cas.
ask. Dean just never had the guts to face him.
It’s quickly apparent that Cas, um, is. Up for it. Literally.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean forces out the words like air being slowly released from a balloon.
Cas sighed. His intuition had been right - he shouldn’t have killed the bassist. “For god’s sake. This is heaven — you can choose your form here. Move back into that young man’s body if you want.”
up to be,” Dean says, another joke falling flat.
Dean licks a strip along Cas’ nipple.
“John,” John says, as if just stating your name is a proper way to greet someone.
“Please,” she says. “Kaia’s not dead yet, I’m bored.”
This time? It’s definitely not a mistake.
He sounds so fucking
His eyes track back to Cas’ shoulders, tense with carrying his weight. He didn’t look this strong when Dean dropped by the Gas-n-sip recently.
“If you know what that is, I mean.”
Being naked was always a mid action type of thing. It was never like this, just… showcasing the goods. Putting himself on display. For some sort of divine judgment, or something.
As he burns the drawings one by one, holding on to them right until dropping them in shallow water in the tub, Dean is reminded of the loss of him.
It feels strangely good to destroy this evidence of Cas posing for — for money. Money Cas didn’t have because Dean didn’t fucking use his stupid skull, didn’t think to give him enough cash to get by on, when he sent him away.
“Jensen Ackles? That’s not a name,” Cas says.
“Yes.”
Some are more detailed than others, but it’s always undeniably Dean. With colored shade, just in pencil but somehow evoking different textures and movements.
Just to test out if Cas has a praise kink like many fans seem to think. No other reason.
Holding — no, demanding someone’s attention like that, arranging your body as a thing to be looked at, it’s powerful.
Advice Dean should definitely absorb.
“Yes you do, damn it Dean. I’m not a kid anymore. Now, we take care of
Cas nods mechanically.
He abruptly turns the car. Cas’ neck snaps toward him in surprise.
Love.
Once again Dean hasn’t touched his paper. The pencil hangs listlessly from his fingertips, still sharp-tipped and unused. His mouth is drier than dust.
many emotions mixed up. Sometimes Dean gets carried away in them because they’re so well written, well, that’s the power of good writers isn’t it? He starts almost believing it, until he has to remind himself, those stories are fiction and very unlike Cas, who’s a former celestial being and therefore entirely above and apart from human emotion.
“Look at me. It wasn’t true, Cas.”
Dean breathily wonders if maybe it’s Cas who’s Richard Siken, after all.
A lot of thoughts buzz through his brain but there’s not a single one he can catch. His arms are frozen in the shape of a hug but not quite touching her back. What to say in a situation like this? No angel training Cas had ever covered this particular scenario.
what Dean is about to do.
Sam clears his throat, and Dean’s looks at him like a child caught sneaking around.
And some of the outfits.
“I’m not homophobic!” He yells, scaring a few extras hanging around the set. They enter the makeup trailer, where two older women are awaiting them.
. That’s
When Cas replies, he sounds disappointed. “Dean. Your body is just a vessel. You are so much bigger on the inside. There is so much more to define yourself with there.”
He raises his eyes to John. “I prayed for it, actually. It was an honor. Castiel was a… good angel. Kind. And um...,” he says, pretending to be Jimmy Novak to avoid his crush. “... brave.”
Right. It’s all pretend. He doesn’t really have to… do it… with Cas. It’s not real.
“And why are you in the roadhouse?”
, Dean chokes out.
After making sure absolutely zero clues can be found among the drawings, being real thorough about it of course, Dean wanders to the half circle bracketing the wooden platform. He puts his stuff on a chair to the side and looks for a steady surface for his drawing papers.
So he improvises.
“I’m going to ask a few questions about the Destiel scene. Please look at me when you answer, not the camera, and fully respond to the question, repeating it in your answer.”
“You thought just
Cas blinks hard and then turns his head away, frowning.
“There are… bargains in heaven?”
“My fingers hurt,” the bass player complained. “I have arthritis.”
Dean’s over that. Over it.
Repressed? What do they mean, repressed?
Cas stares at him blankly.
“You know,” John smirks.
Holy shit.
Very straight. Extremely straight.
Dean slips behind the wheel. Cas is staring into space, still wearing that white shirt he wore to work, but looking a lot more broken in nocturnal shadows than in the daylight.
Bunch of dumbasses.
Loaded question. The whole situation was weird.
Thanks for reading <3 Sorry for all the pain.
And Confused, heh heh. Another great movie for straight dudes who enjoy men in tight bellbottoms. They should watch that one next.
—THE END—
He reads Sam’s newest messages.
It gets worse.
Like, two takes for each scene instead of yelling cut after one and moving on.
Eventually, Cas retreats his hand, and Dean looks at him with so much intensity that Sam swears he’s about to burst into flames.
“What?”
Dean watches Cas swallow hard, and he feels a pang of sympathy for the angel. His eyes linger on Cas’s exposed neck, and then, after he builds up enough courage, Dean looks up into Cas’s gaze.
Jensen sets to work, sipping his own delicious Cosmic Cowboy beer, reciting a spell and drawing some weird sigil off a fanlore web page. Too bad there’s no YouTube how-to vid for this.
Bile rises in Dean’s throat. He pushes it down, the acid of it a searing burn.
“Dean, you um… You know there’s a lot of fanfiction written about you, right?” Kevin asks on a quiet evening in the bunker.
Dean chews on the pen cap, wondering why none of these mention Cas’s good looks.
“They, um.” Dean swallows. “They think I’m repressing my… feelings?”
Sam drinks and quickly moves on, though. Not one to give up easily. “Never have I ever given up an army for one man.”
Dean glances at Cas, who is staring into the blank space in front of him.
If Dean adjusts his seating at that point, that’s purely because he has been sitting in the same position for too long, damn it.
Dean watches as Cas flinches for a fraction of a second. Way to go, Dean, sticking a whole finger in that wound. He just made things worse, as usual.
Dean sighs, a little sad. Long silence, then Dean clears his throat.
God, he’s going to hell.
The MONTAGE ends. We’re back in Dean’s room with Dean and Cass. Cass still hasn’t moved.
“Okay,
A much simpler time, that was.
Cas’ eyes grow wide. “What? Dean-”
Dean frowns. “You been reading about me, you little perv? Full frontal?”
You know, a bro smile.
Cas’s eyes briefly drop to Dean’s lips, then back up. Good. Up, up. Dean wills his own eyes back up from Cas’s mouth, suddenly aware of their placement there.
The angel stirs. He opens his eyes confusedly, and Dean forgets. He forgets Cas probably hates him. He forgets he’s supposed to be careful. He forgets himself.
Damn. This is really kinda getting to Dean, too, he must admit. Maybe Bobo is actually a damn genius after all.
objectified.
But that apple pie life is just with Cas, Eileen explained to him.
It is, after all, not a threat to a strong  heterosexual man’s sexuality to kiss a mate, right?
Pastor Richard screams.
Cas tilts his head.
Shit. Dean chases him, keeping up with his fast pace.
Dean’s face contorts for just a split second before anger takes over again.
He decides to pick an alias. A completely normal, straight name. A musician, a hero.
. Cas doesn’t need to pack a suitcase and walk out of here. He’s an angel, he can just zap away.”
And, fuck. Those long fingers again, flat on the floor like errant paint splashes.
Cas is just - so Cas, you know? Effortlessly beautiful. Dean shifts his weight to his left side, so he can use his right hand to
Positioned on the sink is his wristwatch. He checks the time. Shit - it’s half-past nine? Cas is gonna be late for work!
Why wasn’t he more focused?
“Cas-”, a strained Dean says, trying to pull away.
Dean purrs.
Maybe Cas needs some time to get over his experiences in the Empty, Dean reckons. And after that, who knows? Hell, he’ll give anything just to get his friend back.
Dean dares a quick glance at Cas. The former angel is just busy sketching, with great concentration, tongue firmly planted between his lips.
“Cas,” Dean whispers against his chest, but Cas doesn’t reply - he just wraps himself tighter around Dean.
“No! Me and Cas never-”
This question seems to spook Cas a bit.
“You had your…” Cas taps a finger in the middle of Dean’s chest. “
Sam stops him when he starts listing every car brand in the parking lot.
“Jack, too. And you miss Eileen, prob’ly.”
Chuck raises an eyebrow, seemingly surprised.
Something in his chest constricts as if some part of him is folded, too.
But Sam’s not even bothered, still watching the movie in silence. Like he hasn’t just sent a trojan fucking horse to Dean's phone with a little bow attached to its mane.
How can he bear to live with himself, carelessly carry on, play Chuck’s endgame on an empty board?
Dean realises he’s thinking these questions while staring directly at Cas’ balls.
Dean slips out of bed to the bathroom. He needs to splash some water in his face, damn it. Calm himself down before he embarrasses himself. Maybe reading all that fic has messed him up in the head after all. He shouldn’t be getting any ideas, because those are fiction, and this is real. Real Cas doesn’t need an unhinged friend like this, who’s constantly imagining a whole bunch of sex positions. Sex positions involving the two of them.
It’s Cas saying it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Some tension leaves Dean’s shoulders.
“Cas-“
Cas looks at him intensely. “Dean, she thought I was a homosexual.”
Thirsty? Oh, Dean has no idea.
Cas’ jaw snaps shut, and he swallows heavily before he turns back to the window, suddenly again very interested in the drab darkened suburbia outside.
Dean sighs deeply. Sam’s not gonna understand how it’s totally no homo.
Dammit. Dean forgot that his voice is unnaturally high in this universe.
Cas couldn’t look more beautiful. Well, maybe in a cowboy hat.
Cas bends towards him, holding his pencil in hand still. That’s when Dean notices them.
A look of pity crosses Richard’s face.
He spotted Dean hugging Lisa in the distance.
“Home? Heaven?”
Cas looks suspicious.
Dean never knew
Dean remembers when Cas wanted to be a hunter, before. Shit, is he working hunts on his own? Dean’s pencil presses hard into the paper. Damn it, Cas should have just called Dean. This could be dangerous.
Jensen glances at Misha, who’s happily tapping away on his phone.
He holds up his pencil and makes a diminutive gesture between his index finger and thumb, like he’s measuring something. He winks.
“... with women?”
Dean can’t allow himself to react. He can’t give Chuck the satisfaction. But he can sense Jack come to a realisation, and it is worse than going through hell and back, he would give anything not to have Jack feel this.
Misha lifts one of the empty whiskey bottles and smells it, raising an assertive eyebrow at Jensen. “Rough night?”
Dean freezes.
Quickly, he crumples the note into his back pocket and strides over to open the door.
bond.
His gaze wanted to linger on Dean’s hands, but he gathered all his courage and forced himself to look up at Dean’s face.
,” he imitates.
He gives his other hand permission to explore the bump of Cas’ ass, rubbing up and down along its delicious curve, squeezing it. When he reaches lower and ghosts a finger over Cas’ asshole, like a reminder, that’s when Cas finally comes, shaking against him in quiet puffs, fists tightening in Dean’s t-shirt.
“And then you come here, and pretend to be all noble, because…” Cas glances past Dean, and pain flashes across his features. “Because Jack is here? Is this all a charade for Jack?”
“No,” Dean says quietly, moving food around with his fork.
to befriend this evening’s model so he can watch over her all night. Uh, professionally.
“Interesting - this is too good,” Chuck says, studying both of them. “You haven’t told him, have you? What you did to poor old Cas?”
Dean almost feels offended. Dude, it’s not that bad to have to kiss him, right?
“Jack, you have to give me more time. Have Bobby distract him, please, so I can prepare the roadhouse for the festivities.”
He’s gotta pretend it’s nothing serious. Like a fistbump. A lip bump.
It’s like a gut punch. Dean hates nothing more than feeling helpless. His eyes dart to the ceiling with frustration.
they do, damn it? Does he have to spell it out?
Oh, so… So Cas is some kind of
What if he can’t get Cas back?
The being seems to consider this. All the Empty wants is peace and quiet, isn’t it?
Dean closes his eyes, fighting the wave of guilt. “You gonna help me or what?”
he has to stop thinking about that stupid website.
Dean’s jaw clenches tight. Not exactly the model he was hoping to bring to his motel room tonight.
But the coward doesn’t show. Day after day. Rinse and repeat.
“Cas…” he breathes. “That’s not—“
“This dinner would be pretty awkward, I guess,” John says.
Cas looks out the window again. Houses flash by in darkness. The silence is so loud Dean doesn’t even dare disturb it with any Zepp, though he spares a longing thought for the cassette tape.
There’s a long pause, seconds that feel like hours.
Right. Dean turns off the bathroom light, and lies down next to Cas, flat on his back. He stares at the ceiling, its popcorn texture slowly revealing itself as his eyes adjust to the darkness. There’s some light still trickling in, through the cracks of the door leading to the parking lot. There must be a pretty strong street light there.
“Never have I ever had to cover up a hickey”, Jack says, before Dean can make up his mind. The moment is gone, the atmosphere changed.
“I am, I am. Just, eh, I’m going about it my own way, Sammy,” Jensen smiles apologetically, and chooses a new exit.
“Dean,” Cas begs, chasing that soft feel of skin against skin.
Cas crosses his arms, and waits.
“What?” Claire bats her eyelashes innocently. “I’m just visiting my friend Dean with my dad, what’s wrong with that?”
“I’ll go,” Richard says, looking at his watch nervously. “We start shooting in two.” He scurries away to speak to a camera operator.
His back muscles are starting to feel like a pie crust, criss cross patterned alternating where it hurts.
He really shortens his syllables because of course he does. That’s how Dean talks. Jensen’s got this. He’s an
He promptly takes a couple of large strides to Dean, who looks at him like a wounded deer caught in headlights. Before he can react, Sam grabs his dumb brother by his dumb collar and pushes him inside Dean’s own room.
But Claire turns to him with eyes wide like she knows who’s coming, and says “I forgot, sorry about this.”
Dean feels all the energy drain out of his arms. He has nothing. No defense against this.
Shadows dancing over his moving shoulders, like who gave them the fucking right?
ON DEAN. He stuffs his hands in his pockets and stares at the floor.
Cas crossed his arms. What was Jack implying?
Cas sighs softly against him.
“No!” Dean yells, as if suddenly waking from a daze. This might be their chance. He lifts his hand. “Wait. Please save Cas. Please. You have power here.”
It’s surprising how much this position pulls on his upper arm. His fingers are
Right?
“Please help us,” Jack says.
After a while, he musters up the courage to look Cas in the eyes. Underneath his fingers, he can feel Cas’ heartbeat picking up, though his features appear calm and unaffected.
loved. Like, platonically. By Dean.
He cannot think about this too hard.
Cas’ head snaps up. “Hunt?”
They’re not their father.
Cas seems unimpressed. “Why are you so obsessed with sexuality, Dean? I am utterly indifferent to it.”
This can’t be his life.
“What?” Dean asks, lightly touching the bone dust with his finger tips. Hm. Interesting texture.
turn?”
Dean’s looked at a lot of pin-ups in his life, he’s pretty sure. But his mind is drawing a total blank right now.
“Yes,” he says, the word a hot pebble in his mouth.
Cas takes a few steps back, never taking his eyes off Dean. They’re that intense blue that Dean sometimes can’t help but feel totally undressed by.
CASTIEL
Feels so fucking good.
Well, that isn’t how this universe is gonna go. Team Free Will shouldn’t be disbanded after, you know, achieving their ultimate team goal. They’re not the Avengers. They’re
What are they doing that Look for? Huh?
“And there’s…. no other way?”
This shit ain't funny anymore.
Comprehension slowly dawns on Dean.
He looks at Cas. See? How okay he is?
Was it too revealing?
Jack reaches over and touches Dean’s arm. But Dean barely registers it. It’s like he’s been hit by a grenade; his ears are ringing. He is scattered.
Dean looked down again, tension clear in his shoulders. After a breath, he started talking again.
(he takes a deep breath)
“Thanks, Ron,” he says, and carefully closes the door, because even the sound of his own voice is a little loud.
Dean tells Jack and Sam the bare minimum, when he first meets them in the unbearable endlessness that is the abandoned Earth. He can’t look Jack in the eyes, can’t tell him how he
Cas’ warm breath steadies against the hairs on the back of his neck, and Dean begins to level out with it. Like a slow dance they breathe together, falling into each other’s rhythm. And if Dean shifts his bum a few times, that’s just because it’s not healthy to stay in the same position all the time, your leg can fall asleep, it’s much smarter to move around. So what if he accidentally sticks his back out against Cas. It’s only a little.
“Leave my practice space immediately,” the choir director hisses.
“When you found me, I was Alastair’s best student in hell. Do you think that was a coincidence?”
“I’m not your dad.” He stares out the window stubbornly.
He’s no bendy young sapling, sure. But he didn’t fancy his body such a crumbling cathedral.
Cas doesn’t like the way she’s looking at him now.
What went seriously  wrong in their lives that they bought a… they bought a. Dean briefly closes his eyes, taking a very measured breath.
He is fucking amazing. He is living art.
Cas swallows, and leans into Dean, their chests touching as Cas lifts his arm over Dean’s good shoulder to reach the bad one sideways.
Cas looks a bit shell shocked.
“Cas,” Dean says, and immediately the angel rises from his seat. Ever the dutiful soldier.
And what I love, Cass, is you.
He walks back into the bathroom, picks up his phone from the sink and calls Sam.
Why are the fans so nosy anyway? What’s it to them? Is it some sort of sick and twisted joke?
It’s Dean’s turn to avoid gazes.
. Dean was on his way.
Finally, Dean looks at Cas, then back at his dad. “He’s staying.”
So far only women have been targeted, but 3 out of 3 is hardly a scientific sample. Who knows, this creature might be, um, bisexual or something.
- Dean doesn’t for one second think about how the fans are so wrong, because the real Cas is actually not gay at all, and he doesn’t feel any twinge of disappointment in his stomach. And when he drives Cas to his date’s house and says,
Fuck. It hurts this time, though Dean can’t pinpoint an exact spot of pain.
“Right, let’s get started.”
Cas’ look is open. Without judgment.
He squints at Cas. Shit. Who knew there was a male model hiding under that Columbo cosplay?
Sam is Sam.
“And what was the disappearing like?”
“Uh —“ Dean’s treacherous dick twitches. “Sure thing, Cas.”
But then, suddenly, one of the missing women reappears.
His thighs —
Chuck shrugs. “As you wish. I have some other social calls to do around here.”
Okay. Two boxes left. Jensen swallows and opens the dry one. Yep. The bone of a lamb. Gross!
He does not want Cas to feel like it is a burden on him just to kiss him. Cas is not…. repulsive. He would never want his…. friend…. to feel that way.
Eventually, Cas speaks to his own reflection in the window. “I need the money.”
Cas touches Dean’s lips, tilting his head in a question.
For a moment, he feels like the dumbest guy on Earth. What is he, an erotic rotisserie chicken?
When he greets Cas in the Gas-N-Sip with a sweet smile and a joke, it’s just because he hopes his buddy has forgiven him for sending him away, that’s all. And when the Gas-N-Sip manager reminds Cas that they have a date -
“I didn’t mean to explode like that,” Jack says. “I couldn’t stop it.”
Dean looks down. “Jack, we should.. I’ll explain later. We should find…”
Another pause. Sam’s voice is careful.
Jensen’s face is beet red. “Jesus Christ.”
Dean just hadn’t expected it to be so literal.
Quizzes that Dean has to now complete, because he’s a man who finishes what he started.
He should have known it was a trap.
“What I’m up against?” Cas looks at him incredulously.
He leans back, gauging Cas’ every reaction. He looks… open. There’s delight in his eyes, as he watches Dean show himself. Something… something Dean can’t name.
now, and for a second Dean is afraid he’s going to come in his boxers.
Dean is not ready to see the crack in his chassis.
He grins at all his own jokes, but when he looks back up, Cas is already walking away.
Cas frowned. “I’m not some lowly vfx worker with a Twitter account. I am a celestial being.”
“We’ll start with short sketches to warm up,” pastor Richard says kindly. “We’ll do a few one minute poses, then two minute poses, then two ten minute poses, and we round off the class with two twenty minute ones.”
Besides, it’s all bullshit. The whole thing. Those books aren’t actually… The stories don’t represent them at all.
“The bastard said he loved me, and then he let the Empty just
Dean clenches his jaw.
“No offense, but, gross,” John says, twisting his fork in his food.
In the middle of the hug, Dean finds Cas’ hand and brushes his fingers softly, softly past his.
Dean grins - ah ha! got you, and goes for the Zepp lyrics.
Cas hasn’t come yet.
you’re implying. I am not gay for Cas!!” Dean yells and throws his phone against the wall, not caring if it shatters into pieces at this point.
He’s not gonna have to
Well, ‘accidentally’.
Dean is trying to gather all his courage. That’s not all he came to
Something tugs on Cas’s heart. Dean told John? Were his feelings nothing to Dean, just a casual conversation with his father?
“No, Dean. It wasn’t.”
Dean laughs out loud, but then immediately feels a little defensive on Cas’s behalf.
“Mary, let’s leave,” John orders.
Since there is no “what the fuck” option, he opts for “Every day I read words”.
Dean looks skeptical.
Gabriel! He’s alive here? Dean isn’t surprised, actually. He always knew that psycho trickster would find a way to cheat the cards he’s been dealt.
(stepping closer)
Not ever really stopping to think about what I really needed, what I… wanted.
“Did you sleep?”
There’s a long pause in which Dean tries to avoid making a mooning joke.
Fuck.
He perfects his origami skills with the napkins. He tries to make an instrument out of straws. He counts peppercorn.
Cas just frowns at him, hand still grasping for something just outside of reach in that trench coat. “I don’t…
Jensen glances at the bed. Nope, he’ll be out of here before any of that can happen.
Dean reads the first sentence after the title.
Dean’s dick twitches a little. It’s just aware it’s being seen, no matter who owns the eyes looking at it, Dean tells himself. It’s bound to respond. Only natural.
It had been Jack’s idea. Why not welcome Dean to heaven with a surprise party? Once he died of old age, of course. But it was best to plan ahead. Cas had already had one meeting with Bobby, who’d raised his eyebrows and suggested a couple of beers on a porch instead. Blasphemy!
“What?” He asks.
Cas walks to the chair — Dean is certainly not looking at his wiggling dick — and takes a seat.
He reads through the options. “I would worry that my friend feels uncomfortable” (umm dude, get it together), “Wait. Why HAVEN’T we fucked yet?” (you got issues), “I’d wonder if we would make a cute couple, maybe” (nope, not relatable at all).
“Come on, Dorothy. When do we get to click our heels back to Kansas?” Dean asks, deciding he’s really had enough of all this.
Dean’s hand curls into a fist. What’s he talking about? Their life isn’t a college class, it’s just them sitting in a car and driving through America with zero homoerotic activity. They save people, they hunt things. It ain’t that deep.
And maybe they don’t, um, have the knowhow to vpn a PornHub session?
“Go ahead, Cas. Press play. I mean, start. On the timer.”
Cas shrugs.
“Sorry,” Cas repeats the apology, sounding dazed.
Dean blinks.
She nods and walks off. Next to Dean, Cas is doing his weird staring thing. Dean looks over at him with sudden trepidation.
“Draw me like one of your French girls, Cas,” he says, hoping his smile is charming in some way.
“And the party’s just fine. Dean will be the happiest to see
Dean recovers quickly and lifts his chin.
It’s the PA. He’s holding like, five cardboard boxes in all kinds of sizes.
black briefs. His shirt and trousers are folded over his arm, and he walks over to the little desk in the corner of the room to drape his clothes over the chair.
The fire in the bowl is burning higher now, turning a blue color.
He directs his own body one step closer to Cas.
Cas’s ears perked up. How would Dean react to hearing his name? With sadness? Shock? Neutral? Or… or…
“How... did you do that?” A startled Cas asks.
Nope. Mind not wandering.
He tried to stop crying, eyes pressed tightly shut. He felt Dean hunker down in front of him, warm hands seeking balance on Cas’s knees. On his
Jensen exhales. Whew. Cat’s out of the bag, at least.
Does he
Sam nods seriously. It feels like they’re on a spy mission.
“Hey, Jimmy,” Dean says, stuffing his hands in his pockets once again. Cas thinks he could live in one of those pockets and be perfectly happy, pressed against his thigh like a queer little handkerchief.
That thought slows him down slightly, and he opens his eyes again.
“I see, yes,” she smiles with a knowing look that makes Dean feel just a tad unsettled.
Dean plops down on the nearest sofa and nearly bumps his knees against the tiny table.
“I don’t owe a living being anything, child.”
What is this, a poetry book?
In large, black letters, it reads:
Enough pep talk. Let’s talk prep. He coats his fingers in lube and uses his other hand to spread Cas further. When his fingertip touches Cas’ rim, Cas jolts forward.
The guy tries to lunge, but Dean quickly avoids his fist and in one beautiful motion, he splashes him in the neck with a good dose of holy water.
of whiskey. But Cas doesn’t move.
Something was stuck in Cas’s throat. Everyone else was drinking and laughing and dancing, but he needed some air. Needed to get out of there before ‘Dust in the Wind’ started, certainly. They couldn’t start playing ‘Carry on Wayward Son
. Just like Dean.
Cas crosses his arms over the chair’s backside, and rests his head on them, slightly tilting towards Dean.
Swallows lots and lots of whiskey.
He reaches the last page of the script and it just ends with the kiss.
If Cas is this exhausted, they should definitely let him catch up on some Z's. It's Dean's turn to frown. Since when do angels even
Dean gets really into drawing this one, racing against the cellphone timer driven by an inexplicable need to keep this moment forever, the only way he can — by moving that pencil to the paper. Hoping to even catch a flicker of that fire that’s radiating from Cas’ entire being. Blazing. Scorching.
Dean jolts backwards, reflexively pushing Cas away from him. Cas’s eyes blow wide open, terror and hurt on his face. Dean feels a twinge of guilt, though he swears he didn’t even shove that hard —
Dean feels like a video game’s life bar filling up, right up to the tip of his ears, which flush with red and heat.
“Cas. I’m…” Dean’s voice breaks.
Cas, clearly at a loss for what to do, chooses his usual course of action - walking out the door.
Just for a second, there’s a flash of something on Cas’s face, something Dean has never seen before but it suits Cas so well. The emotion illuminates his entire being even though he is just an actor named Misha here, to Dean, he is everything at once.
It’s a good thing Dean’s always liked
“Sorry about the yorkie joke,” Cas says.
He is strong.
Good thing Cas feels indifferent about sexuality, otherwhise he might think this was gay!
Both are places they never felt
Right. Dean swirls his glass between his fingers, studying the liquid. Lights are bouncing off its golden belly.
But that’s not exactly something he can explain to this character who doesn’t even know he’s fictional.
After a long silence, Claire puts a hand on his shoulder.
Cas’s blue Misha-but-not eyes stare back at him. There’s a hostility there still, but understanding is beginning to bleed through their edges.
After a long silence, Dean cleared his throat. “You’re right.”
He’s trying to curb his bubbling anger, doing his damndest not to shake all over (can’t wake Cas). Where do those so-called fans get off? Making lame quizzes about his life? Annoying, probably even homophobic little nerds.
He sat down on the porch and rubbed his eyes. When did they become so wet?
He opens his eyes. Nothing.
Dean swallows.
“Oh no, this party is
He should definitely teleport elsewhere.
“Cut! It’s
“You ok, Jen?” This so-called ‘Richard’ asks, his mouth a tiny sliver of concern.
“No bullshit,
“Yeah?”
Dean exhales shakily, twisting his eyes shut for a second. He can do this. He can do this. He’s read about this so many times, he’s basically an expert now. Ok, ok, he’s got this, c’mon.
“But I got this feeling that Cas is out there, alive, and Jack’s with him, you know?” Jensen tries to sound reassuring.
It’s an angel modeling the beauty of creation.
Dean drags his knuckles across his brow. Whew! Awkwardness narrowly avoided.
Boy? Dean can feel his own dad echoing out of his mouth. God he hates himself, now.
“You’re kidding??” Eileen responds, laughing out loud now, and Sam moves a finger to his lips.
“Only if you’re up for it, Cas,” Dean says.
“Anyway, It’s dumb and… offensive, and I shouldn’t have taken it.”
He walks up to Dean’s bed and sits down.
When the alarm goes off, Dean feels a twinge of disappointment in his drawing. He couldn’t quite get Cas right.
Sobriety.
Dean clears his throat.
Well, maybe Dean kind of deserved that.
Dean holds up a finger. It’s his damn phone.
“Angel’s kiss”, Sam explains, behind them. “To summon you.”
“The walls are really thin, Dean,” Cas says, voice strained.
Dean is falling into place, all his broken pieces knitting together as his lips press against Cas’s mouth, more eager with each second.
! Filling out forms for these clowns.” He gestured to the seven dazed rockers behind him, who had been following him around like he was Snow White. “It’s not even been that long since….” He sighed and rolled his eyes. “Just tell me.
“Fuck,” Dean says.
,” Jensen corrects, gulping. “You and Dean. Anyway, they fight the vamp mimes. He, um, becomes a human satay. He has the longest monologue in the history of film writing, and dies.”
he cannot touch him.
It’s just that after reading the season 15 finale script, he’d been upset.
It’s not like Dean is trying to hurt Cas’s feelings. Not every day you get yeeted into your best friend’s mouth as a fun surprise. Also, a guy could get a little warning. Had Dean known they’d land here he would’ve at least eaten some mints.
Maybe Jimmy works out, you know?
hadn’t moved at all.
Good, at least Cas sounds alive now. And hoo boy, does he
Kevin squints at him. “That’s how those stories usually start, Dean. Denial.”
The Shadow turns her attention to him, raising her eyebrows.
Dean can see Jack glancing at him, unsure. Because Jack
He moves his fingers closer to Cas’ cheek, cupping that angel face. He wonders if Cas is even capable of, you know. All that.
Naked chicken. Plucked chicken.
“I mean,” Dean corrects, though he doesn’t know what he’s correcting. Nothing, that’s what. Shut up. “It’s to keep you safe.”
Sam bursts out in laughter, and clinks Cas’ glass.
He traces Cas’s edges, making sure there’s enough lube, before he hesitantly pushes one finger in, one digit deep. Dean breathes heavily. Or was that Cas breathing? He can’t tell anymore. It’s so hot. Man, has he conditioned himself to find this hot, with all his nighttime (and okay, daytime) reading? Or is it. Just hot.
, Dean thinks while missing the touch.
A long moment passes before he dares move his arm again, now back to his phone.
“Go on,” Dean says. He is ready.
But what can Cas even say? He’s not ‘in love’ with Dean. He remembers rebuilding his body the way Michelangelo remembers chiseling the David from a slab of marble. He can recount from memory the fifty three (53) subtle shades of green in Dean’s eyes. He hears his voice in his mind, still - like an ancient poem repeated so often it becomes legend.
Cas starts to nod in realisation. “Yes, I remember Balthazar bringing Dean and Sam there as a distraction. And you’re from that universe?”
make me into a hero. They carved me into a new animal in hell. But the one thing I never dared to admit to anyone - I
“Sorry,” he mumbles. “This was… S— sorry.”
She’s gulping, and looking scared and disoriented, and wearing — presumably — the clothes she disappeared in. Dean wouldn’t know, since all he’s seen is what is uh. Underneath ‘em.
Dean turns. It’s a skinny man, dressed in jeans and a dark green knitted sweater, smiling at him.
He should probably clarify to Cas that he was talking about Dean Winchester the Fictional Character.
Dean reaches for his phone, moving slowly as not to wake Cas.
Dean shrugs, looking away uncomfortably.
Then, Dean taps back to the different answers.
Cas sighed. This was his own personal hell. “Dean, you don’t have to—”
. And Cas was proud to be his bud. Really.
Right?
You were right in front of me. And I couldn’t stop for one second to pull my dumb head out of my idiot ass long enough to see it. We were Harry and Sally, and I’m sorry it took me so long to realise.
But Dean Winchester — the guy’s been through so much, you know?
He smoothes out his hair. He’s a devout man. A dad. His name is Jimmy. He likes falling asleep in front of the tv. He has never had a gay thought in his life.
Nothing. Dean said... nothing.
There’s a small pause.
“Cas, you arranged your books by color, and then alphabetically and then by whether the author went to heaven, hell or purgatory.”
“Come sit on the bed with me,” Dean requests, and Cas allows him to lead him by the hand.
The final screen takes forever to load, and Dean's getting kind of antsy now. Not every day you’re sitting there with your best friend’s head close to your dick wondering whether strangers have parasocially assigned you Gay At Birth.
the missing ingredient, I guess,” Cas says, seemingly resigned. He looks up.
“I tried so damn hard to tell you. Every time I saw you. I waited for the right words, the right time. And I just about died every time you touched me. It killed me to have you heal me, and at the same time, I wanted it so hard.”
Richard adjusts his cap. “Some fan outrage. And a few… Headlines questioning whether you are homophobic.” His face is apologetic.
life. He should check out at least what those philistines are writing about him.
, Dean thinks. He did lose his humanity, during those forty years in hell. The things he did to people, inside and outside of hell. They are unspeakable. He did corrupt.
Hm, Dean thinks as he absentmindedly strokes Cas’ hair with his other hand. He’s starting to think this quiz is actually a little weird about homosexuality.
That’s when it hits him. Like a hammer. This is a love confession. Cas
Dean holds a breath, and Cas can’t help but notice his furtive glance at John.
“Why are you wearing Cas’s trench coat?” Dean says, suspiciously.
Cas startles. He turns his head. “I haven’t been to any carnivals lately, Dean. And I only have a little experience handling hot dogs at the Gas-n-sip.”
Cas tenses and slowly turns toward Dean to look him in the eyes.
Last question isn’t even really a question, it’s just an open suggestion box.
The fuck? Is this Siken guy obsessed with their lives too or something?
“Cas, you dumbass, look at me,” Dean says fondly, putting his hand on his cheek.
Sam's eyes turn sad for a brief flash, though his cheerful mask soon slips back in place.
This is what you get for trying to be a hero, he supposes.
Those blue eyes remind Dean of the way oceans reflect heaven. Who knows what secrets lie there? Who knows what sexuality and gender mean to such ancient beings? Maybe Cas has kissed men before.
Normally there’s stunt guys for that! Choreography! Cables to fly them into the air that are “definitely going to look great after special effects are added”.
“There you are.” Richard’s voice floats in from around the corner.
Cas looks up, defiantly, his eyes a sharp slice of heavenly blue. “You
Cas rubs the tip against his hole again, and Dean almost blacks out with the anticipation.
“Dude,” the lead singer complained. “That’s the twentieth time you’ve done this!”
Dean steps closer to the wall. Some students seem to focus on the face, mostly. Others aren’t quite as prudish.
Cas does it again. And again. And again.
“Um. No, please leave them on, sir,” the woman says awkwardly, red flushing up her neck.
Cas freezes, one hand still on the edge of his briefs, near the dip of his hip.
! When would his suffering be over?
. Only kiss. Definitely.
REASONS DEAN LOVES CAS, it says in large capital letters up top.
He looks entirely disoriented, scrambles to his feet and takes heavy breaths. His hair is disheveled. His briefs are still sticky. His hands seek purchase on the sink.
Dean immediately feels like the crooked crayon in the box. He never thought he’d feel underdressed in a – wait, what are these called anyway?
Dean very pointedly ignores the fact that he, himself, turned down Sam’s offer to come along with him for this particular case.
“Yeah,” Dean says, glancing at Cas. Did they put that makeup crap on him? He looks… different. Why’s it all orange?
(See the end of the chapter for
Maybe he should have given him more cash before he sent him away from the bunker. Maybe he should have given him a fake credit card. Shit. Shit. The guilt slams into Dean’s chest. Why didn’t he think about any of these details?
Now Jack’s head does turn. Dean fixes his eyes on the floor. He can’t bear to look at him.
Cas avoids his gaze, and moves closely past Dean to his desk. There, Dean’s coat is thrown over the chair.
The woman may be parched, but she’s not wrong.
“Good morning,” he greets. “I’m here to, um, collect all the art off the wall.”
“Demons and angels relive their memories here, in a dream-like state. Billie made his everlasting dream to be reliving only his very last moments. Eternally.”
Jack will come to the only possible conclusion soon. That he should rescue Cas and leave Dean behind.
“You’re in the car with a beautiful boy, and he won’t tell you that he loves you, but he loves you”
Cas pauses, and seems to gather all his strength before continuing, a faint crack in his voice. “Of course you couldn’t ever hate me. But you couldn’t ever love me either.”
“Mmmmh. Yeah, uh, Sam Dean slash or whatever,” Dean says absentmindedly. He’s busy pouring himself another glass of whiskey. A visionary act he’ll soon be grateful for.
“You. What?”
Dean’s still fuming as he puts his pajamas on, brushes his teeth and crawls into bed. The one where he’s recently added another bedside table, on the other side. You know, for symmetry.
. Dangerously close to a rejection. Good thing he assumed Jimmy’s identity, Cas thinks. Extremely smart decision.
Seconds tick by.
The cloudy haze in his mind starts to feel threatening. The alcohol finally catches up with Dean — like muscle memory, it takes him back to the weeks he spent trying to forget about Cas. The weeks his whole body felt ripped in half, missing an essential part. And now, he’s looking right at Cas, yet
Dean feels something sink in his stomach. Shit. How much did Cas overhear? The last thing he wants is for Cas to find that dreadful piece of fanfic, that whole bunch’a made up lies.
have to drink.” And he downs a shot. “My turn?”
Dean is remembering all of this as he looks at the tear in the wall, the gateway to the Empty that is, under extraordinary pressure, opening right in front of his eyes.
Suddenly, Dean understands why ghosts thrash and struggle against the pull of being unseen, being forgotten. He gets why they charge against gravity and rip the veil to shreds. To be seen is to exist. To matter.
“Don’t you worry about it, I’ve talked to a couple of journalists,” Richard continues reassuringly. “Told them how much you were on board with Destiel. All the face grabbing throughout the years, the trenchcoat stuff. All you. I made sure they knew, man.”
That’s what knocks Dean over the edge. He can’t stop it anymore, and he’s falling, he’s plummetting, fast and hard, and he spills inside Cas, quavering, losing balance, losing everything.
“Cas. Look at me. I love you. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner. I love all of you, I
They walk for what feels like hours, but every time Dean checks his watch, only a minute has passed.
It’s like the Spider-Man meme but sexier. No! Not sexier. Just. Nude.
Hm. How the hell does a pose that looks so natural, feel so cramped?
Cas frowned. What was the man talking about? They
Just breathe. You’re a good actor. You got that Kids Choice Award to prove it. You
They don’t seem to be paying attention. Seems rude — are they even watching the show? Dean frowns at them.
Cas shuts up, blinking up at Dean and it’s almost endearing. A baby in a trench coat. Um, without the trench coat. Saucer eyes. Tight briefs.
He runs back into the room. It’s Cas’ phone alarm, the one he set for the last pose.
No, no. This is going all wrong.
“You don’t look like you’re dying,” the angel remarks.
“Now where the hell are we gonna find an angel’s kiss?” Dean wonders aloud, frowning.
Actually, Dean decides, watching Cas’s face -
But Dean just stares back, eyes tightening, jaw clenching.
He can feel Cas’ eyes measuring, comparing. Like Dean’s more an object than a purpose, a thing to be drawn, little more than a bowl of fruit.
In an automatic reflex to douchery, Dean squares his shoulders and lowers his voice. “Or what?”
The words seem stuck in his throat. How to even explain? How can he push himself to even say the words? Just thinking about it makes Dean feel like he’s about to fall off the edge of something, something big.
Dean wonders suddenly — as a witness to all of time, did Cas also notice just then how it — stopped?
“... Cas helped,” he heard Bobby say.
Cas watches Dean’s shoulders tense.
“Now! Do it now!” Jack screams by the doors, barely holding back invisible forces.
Oh god.
“Cas, you are so fucking tight, man,” Dean says, precum leaking on the mattress.
They’re half an hour into the second Monty Python movie of the evening when Cas falls asleep on Dean’s shoulder.
Jensen shakes his head. No. He knows Cas is alive, because Bobby’s going to tell Dean that later, in heaven.
Richard sighs, suddenly seeming very tired. “Apparently your OUTtv footage already leaked all over Twitter. There’s um…”
With his leg in front of the other, his dick is once again hidden from Dean’s view.
that to me, do you know how damn stupid that is?”
Blue eyes blink from the entry.
“I think I’ll pass,” Castiel says, already turning toward the door.
Cas places it against his right pec. It’s warm, hard against his skin. It moves over his nipple, and Dean inhales sharply.
“Now shake it and bow. Three times.” He watches as his little brother steals glances over at him, trying to watch what he does.
So the baker takes Cas back to the market. So he helps him secure the honey jar crate onto the back of the scooter with the bungee cords. So Cas would think that’s where it’s going to end.
Cas leans down to kiss either of Dean’s cheeks. It’s not something he does often, the gesture (like most things) too intimate for them in outside settings. But here, here they are safe. Here, Dean can relax.
But he
She scoffs. “Then why are you here?”
Cas knows. “Of course,” he replies, “Always.”
She lifts her hands up to her face, trying to see what it is. Oh god—it’s blood. Red, red, red. There’s a sharp pain, like something’s tearing her apart.
Dean gives a half-smile, a consolation even as he claps his hands together in anticipation. “Hey, it’s fine. Let’s see what you’ve got; I’m starving!”
“I will ask you again, Dean, about what you need. Not want, but
He can vaguely hear Dean talking again, so he tries to focus on that. Even now, Dean’s palm is a warmth at his back.
Dean gives the man a better look—how his hair is matted down, but still dark. The dust on his clothes, the way his shoes are broken at the seams. Something definitely happened.
“I meant great! It was great!” Cas hates himself for the way he’s fumbling over his words.
“I’ll drive you. I can—anywhere.” Dean shoves his hands in his pockets to stop fidgeting. He looks away from Castiel, unnerved.
(See the end of the chapter for
, she whispers. And it’s over before he can say anything back.
They are driving back from the hellscape of the broken town, the slow rumble of the Impala’s engines a soothing lullaby. Cas is in the backseat, having decided to accompany the brothers back to Bobby’s house. Dean’s knuckles are white around the steering wheel, jaw clenched tight.
This is him—raw and beaten down—praying in bathroom stalls, asking for things to be okay. For his mom to protect him.
“Cas, man, wear a fucking bell. Or better yet, don’t come in at 4 in the fucking morning.”
“I’m okay.”
He looks peaceful, but Cas can see the dark circles underneath his eyes. Likely a result from waking up at 4:30; after all, fresh bread doesn’t bake itself. Cas moves toward him, careful not to make any loud noises.
Cas, if he thinks about it, could probably say he’s screwed. To feel this in love with the baker and not be sure of the other man’s feelings. At least, for this moment, he’s content just being by his side.
The gravel scrapes the inside of his hands, making red bloom across his knuckles. The pain is negligible. Nothing matters anymore.
Dean stares back. There’s a confused expression on his face. “Come again?”
Cas with
The beekeeper’s resolve breaks down a little, just watching the other man completely still. Of all the bad decisions that Cas has made, this probably ranks highest.
The angel’s voice is soft when he says next, “I died for love. And you brought me back.”
“Long time no see, right?”
Dean thinks,
But she doesn’t do anything. “What are they for?”
Dean frowns. “Buddy, what’s wrong? You don’t want me touching you?”
“Hey, buddy.” Dean’s voice is rough, hoarse with use. Cas’ honey could fix that. If only Dean wants it—Cas had tried once, when he first started out, but Dean just waved him away. So Cas had learned his lesson; even if he still thinks Dean Winchester is gorgeous, he’s absolutely infuriating.
The contact makes Jess break. Everyone has been so afraid to touch her; the funeral spent arms crossed, huddled into herself. She—she just wants someone to get it. To say something other than empty condolences.
“Hello Dean.”
So Cas is right. Dean Winchester will—certifiably, absolutely—be the death of him. At this point it’s just a matter of whether it’s quick or slow.
“You sure you’re okay?” Dean asks, looking back at the beekeeper.
Dean stays awake some nights thinking about it, thinking about how things might have been different.
“What do you need?”
“—can you promise me that?”
But despite a general lack of awareness in regards to coats and cold weather, Dean is—well, he’s Dean. It looks like he should be brusque and burly at first glance—large shoulders and beard—but then there’s the way that his crow’s feet appear whenever he smiles, and the small grey flecks in his beard. It makes him look kinder.
Dean opens one eye, tracking Cas as he lays his head against the pillow one more time. There’s a quiet reverence between them, something fragile.
“Yes, Dean. It’s better now.”
Dean lowers the mug. “How’s it going, buddy? Doing okay?”
If Cas is honest, he is in love with Dean Winchester.
It doesn’t make it hurt any less. The nurses come in and they poke and prod, asking questions with fake smiles like they can pretend everything’s fine. Like he didn’t get electrocuted.
Dean’s hand runs across Cas’ back even as he gently peels himself away to get a better look at the wound.
Dean’s alone, yet again. Like he always is. And it feels like he always will be.
Looking down at his work, Cas doesn’t understand. “I’m not sure what you mean.”
, is it
A shot of light emanates from behind him. Dean and Cas are pulled back into the Bunker, covered in black ooze. Dean breathes out hard. Cas is unresponsive above him.
“I think you know that’s not true.” Cas tilts his head, a sympathetic look on his face.
There’s a bit of silence before Cas definitively says, “You don’t need to take care of me.”
“It’s good,” Cas confirms, nodding slightly in affirmation. “It’s a bit
Dean’s throat is raw, a scream away from losing his voice.
“What?” she asks, shying in on herself.
She thinks maybe that isn’t so bad.
Dean squares his shoulders. He’s going to bring Cas back, whatever happens.
runs through Cas’ mind.
Cas turns to his left. Dean Winchester has a grin on his face and a plate of sliced bread in one of his hands.
What a fucking joke it is, having to look at this reminder. Having to realize over and over again that Dean living meant Cas’ death.
All that disappears with Dean’s next words.
The words are out of Cas’ mouth before he can take it back. Dean whips around, eyes wide.
Even when Dean’s next words—I’ll take you home—make him choke a little.
Dean brings his hand up to his face, presses his fingers along his own jaw. If he concentrates hard enough, it’s almost as if he can still feel Cas’ touch, the way he leaned into it.
“Can I shower?”
And Dean? Dean didn’t know what to do.
He’s never forgetting his gloves again.
“Cas?” he whispers, shifting so he can see the angel’s face. “Cas?”
“I am stoked about this episode. Absolutely.”
He leans forward, and places a kiss on Cas’ neck as he pulls back and then pushes slowly forward, feeling Cas stretch around his dick, and it feels so good and so right and so -
Dean mutters something incoherent as a goodbye and ends the call, gripping the phone hard enough to leave pressure marks on his hand from its edges.
been slow in the bunker.
He keeps one eye on Sam just to make sure he doesn’t turn around to catch him taking some fanmade uquiz. Luckily, Sam’s munching popcorn and laughing at the British monarchy jokes coming from the tv.
“Never have I ever been completely banned from driving the Impala,” Dean says and stares at Cas and Jack until they drink.
One by one they burn.
Dean holds his gaze, shoulders tense, trying to breathe through something. And Sam really does want to tell his brother that it’s okay, he can be who he is and he can love who he loves. But the words are stuck in his throat. This is for Dean to tell him, this isn’t something that should be dragged out of anyone before they’re ready.
Ron shifts nervously on his feet. “This one’s eh. Bleeding a bit through the package.”
Say it.
However, Dean feels a twinge in his stomach as Jack takes a hesitant sip.
Both of them are staying behind. Dean insisted. This is for him to fix alone.
The last one, he found cowering in the corner. If there was any time for ethical reflections he might have hesitated. Did he really
Cas kicks Claire under the table.
He does the actual air quotes. How can Dean lie when Cas is being so bloody adorable?
But Cas continues, thoughtfully. “I always wondered about ‘I need you’… When I nearly killed you under the influence of heaven, that is what you said. Not
Cas’ pulse, he allows his eyes to interpret actual words.
But before he can process that little comment, pastor Richard introduces the m… the model… he introduces Cas.
“Cas told Dean to stop,” Sam signs to Eileen. When he glances back, Dean is alone. “Now he’s gone into his room, I think he’s angry. And Dean is just staring at the door like he’s going to open it with demonic telekinesis.”
Frozen still, he waits, staring into the relative fuzzy shadows playing over the motel room wall. He hasn’t felt this lost since he was in hell. It lasts a minute. It lasts a lifetime. There’s no way of knowing. Then, Cas slowly moves closer, until his naked - oh God, oh God, Dean forgot it was naked - torso presses up against Dean’s t-shirt clad back. Cas’ legs effortlessly bow into his. It’s unexpectedly warm, it’s… It’s strange how well they fit. Almost divine.
“Cas, I… I…”
He finds some sort of rhythm now, pushing into Cas with long and slow thrusts. He angles his hips so that with each move, the waistband of his boxers slides down further, shifting around his groin. Slowly, the tip of his dick tents the cotton, ducks, then peeks out, glistening above the fabric.
Yup, it’s spilled a bit but salvageable.
“So yeah,” Dean continues. “This
Cas wondered how many women Dean had turned down in his life. Then realised with dread that probably Dean was such a ladies man he never turned any woman down.
!” He shuts the box close. “And
“You go do soundchecks while I make some phone calls,” he ordered, clapping his hands. “And smile! You’re in heaven. Eternal bliss, I wanna see nothing
Oh no.
“I meant you, Chuck,” Jack says, his eyes nearly shooting fire.
“Never have I ever behaved in such a way that people start to suspect I’m missing my own soul”, Dean says.
So, Gabriel’s directing this crap? Doesn’t really surprise Dean. It
“Never have I ever…” Cas starts. “Never have I ever.”
Yes, things
He strokes Cas’ cheek, sighing into the air and frowning up at the ceiling.
“Leave him alone,” Jack demands.
Cas closes his eyes.
So if he has to keep a silence going for three days in this damn room, to evoke that spontaneity, then he will.
Dean rubs his eyes, wishing he could stab them out. He turns his phone off and throws it back on the bedside table.
It is almost the last verse.
After an encouraging nod, he takes it.
He glared at what some obviously misguided people called “one of the greatest rock bands of all time”. They all had puzzled looks on their faces. He reached into his trenchcoat and took out a shotgun.
” Kansas sang as Cas stumbled through one of the exits.
But this is just mimicking Cas’ earlier pose, that’s all. Eye for an eye, ass for an ass.
Sam nods. To the air, because his brother’s eyes are aimed straight to the floor.
“Go!” Jack yells.
“Yes I’ve read it, assbutt!”
Yeah man! Not even
It’s just. Cas is definitely more buff than Dean expected. Not that he ever thought about what Cas would look like naked, of course. Certainly never fantasised about it!
An actual angel of the Lord has appeared out of thin air and Jensen has about thirty different crises of faith. This is definitely
to rest? This must be some urgent celestial nap-time.
“Are you sleeping at work?”
“Dean-“
“Demon’s blood, wolf’s bane, a whale’s grinded bone dust and a sample of Edinburgh’s sewer water. I have collected everything needed for the spell, Sam,” Jack says proudly, spreading out the ingredients on the table in the bunker. “Well, everything except…”
“I’d say 90 percent is dest-,” Kevin says, quickly correcting himself: “Erhm - I mean, you and Castiel.”
“Go! Now!” Sam yells at him.
He gathers all his courage and lowers himself onto Cas’ body until his elbows are on either side of him, and their dicks - ohhhh god. Their dicks are actually
They remain like this for a while - Dean panting into Cas’ chest, Cas clutching onto his back like he’s going to fall off a cliff now and Dean is the only thing tethering him to higher ground. Until eventually, with a small sigh, Cas pulls back and moves to his side of the bed again, looking up at the ceiling.
him.” Chuck finishes him off, like sliding a knife out a body.
After a lot of spraying and wiping and slathering and carefully avoiding Cas’s eyes in the tiny trailer - though fine, he looks nice without a shirt, Misha must work out a lot, those arms are only second to those hands - they’re ushered onto the set.
He stands up, stretches his body, and places his hands on his hips.
There’s no grace in this universe but Dean could swear there’s a glow emanating from those fingertips against his cheeks, and the way those long fingers just fit around his jaws, it’s like — like falling into place.
Funny guy, Eric.
No friggin’ way. Dean’s not homophobic, and obviously, neither is this Jensen guy, they’re both gay or bisexual or whatever on this tv show, dammit! Which is a-okay with Dean. In fact, he’s pretty sure Sammy went through a phase in college, that was totally fine too. The Winchester brothers are as accepting as they come.
(not what Cas expected).
Cas nods and flashes a quick look at Dean, before standing up. He turns away slightly, and crosses his hands over his chest, somehow exuding a new kind of vulnerability. Cas keeps his gaze on the wall opposite him, expression hard to read from Dean’s sideway position.
“Cas, please. Don’t leave again.”
Something drops in Sam’s stomach.
Probably red as a beet, he scrambles for his stuff, and glances at Barb. To his horror, she’s snacking on a piece of beef jerky. Where the fuck did she get beef jerky?
“Cas, I…” Dean starts, and Cas is on his feet immediately. “I accidentally put a staple in my side.”
“You’re wrong, Sam,” Cas says, staring him down.
Jack put his hand on Cas’s arm in a soothing gesture. Almost… fatherly. What should have been helpful now became confusing to Cas. He’d been a dad to Jack, but now, the kid was God, so technically his, uh,
Then, Dean unclenches his jaw.
Sam pulls back his silver machete from the last vampire’s head, and looks behind him to see Cas instinctively rush to Dean’s side.
. “Please, I…”
Dean immediately turns to face the wall. Like he’s on autopilot or something.
It’s never bothered him before.
This isn’t looking good.
Dean exhales unsteadily. Are his ears hot? Or is it just Cas’ breath that keeps blowing softly against them, like, almost erotically? And - and worse: the heat being caused by the feel of Cas’ chin nestled in his neck. Something twists tightly in Dean’s lower abdomen.
“Show me,” Cas commands. He only briefly makes eye contact with Dean.
Dean smiles at him reassuringly. Just because he’s not gay, doesn’t mean he’s opposed to being intimately touched by a man! “I don’t mind, except that you apparently think Monty Python is boring. Nobody’s perfect though.”
He clicks on the top link, a collection of Castiel / Dean works on a website called Archive of our Own. Of whom? Whose throat can he go rip out?
Dean focuses very emphatically on Cas, who’s crossed his arms for the next pose already. Cas’ hands are resting on his own shoulders, while one leg stretches to the back. Like an… olympian… of hugs.
Not cool.
Cas bites his lower lip.
Jack squinted at him, hands folded behind his back. “You didn’t feel it?”
“That you’re not
And he french kisses him again.
He runs back to pastor Richard and splashes him in the face with it.
“Thanks, Jimmy.”
Dean goes for levity again. “Babysitting hourly rates are down, huh?”
Dean closes his eyes, mouth hanging open. He’s just grinding and grinding like a dog in heat, his underwear sliding off more and more. He’s almost completely exposed now. Sure, his underwear’s restraining him but also, it’s so fucking hot. Fuck. Fuck.
Jensen shakes his head in the darkness. One of his fish says glub.
Dean frowns.
“Um. Well, that’s beside the point but — the quiz, Sam sent it to me, and it’s supposed to be showing how much we… I mean, the characters of the book repress their sexuality.”
But now, it all clicks like a puzzle.
, and suddenly everything makes sense. Every tug on his heart whenever he saw Cas. Every hug that made him feel new kinds of warmth.
(backing away)
Dean closes the distance between them in three quick steps, then reaches for Cas’ shoulder and turns him back around.
Dean’s thoughts divert to his own relationship to his body.
? The list goes on. Praise kink? Dry humping? Frottage?
“These, um, these past twelve years, we’ve been through so much together. Ever since you pulled me out of hell, there’s been a pull between us.” Jensen swallows.
The woman presses a fake possession tattoo on to the side of his chest.
Sonofabitch.
Because Cas sure is a
He’s actually doing this, he supposes.
“Stand there,” he directs Cas.
loosen Cas’ tongue, so to speak.
What the-
“No! No, uh, Cas. That’s not necessary.”
“I errrr — I think this was a bad idea,” Dean says, shakily getting up.
Please God. Smite me instead.
Dean’s heart leaps in his throat.
“Cas! Come on dude. You gotta g-”
“You’re outta line, son,” John says.
Dean holds his gaze. Slowly, the pencil travels downward, down his chest, over his abs.
His eyes do
Dean’s ending — dying young — doesn’t sit right with him. So Danneel had suggested asking Eric for advice. Supernatural’s his baby, after all. At the core, it’s still his show he knows and loves, and Dean Winchester is as much Eric’s as his own.
Cas, hidden in half darkness where Dean is lit by the lamp, reaches out to his timer. He fumbles with it, then puts it away.
Depressed?
He’s just getting ready for the night with Eileen when he suddenly hears voices in the hallway. So he reluctantly gets out of bed, in his warm winter pj’s and slippers. He peeks outside, mostly hidden inside his own doorway. A little further down, Dean and Cas are standing in the hallway that’s shrouded in patches of shadows. They’re right by Cas’ door.
Dean looks at the guy suspiciously.
Dean lifts his eyebrows. “You have grace!”
John flexes his hand on the table. “How do you know—”
Hips.
(looking up)
“You good? You look a bit... shaken,” Dean says.
“Well, for one, I have read a ton of slash fanfiction and that’s how I know I’m not into it.”
He hesitates, and downs another drink even though it’s technically against the rules.
,” Chuck says, and laughs loudly. “Isn’t that grand?”
“You wanna quit hunting?” Sam looks at him like he’s grown a second head instead of a second vessel occupant.
One short for a two bed motel room.
He reads it all he way through, then closes his phone quickly. What the fuck. What the actual fuck.
“It’s only fair I bring
is probably the scariest thing about the whole mess.
“Hey, bud,” Dean whispers to Cas, because that’s what he is. His normal, heterosexual buddy.
He looks up. Cas’ fingers are twitching, but his face remains a slab of marble. Fucking angelic statuette. Unmovable.
Cas shifts again, tight black briefs rubbing against his butt, and
“Come home with me,” Dean says breathlessly. “I’m done posing.”
he’s hot. That’s what you get when people tell you that from a young age.
Dean’s breath stops.
It’s not as danceable though.
“I never took you for a cruel man, Dean.”
“How?”
That’s ok. Jimmy is just here for a good time.
He reads through the answers. Now he’s certain of it. Whoever made this, is insane. Dean coded? Cas girl? Cas Coded Dean Girl? What does that even mean??
“Mad?”
“Dean, what are you doing,” Cas says flatly.
Right. A clown.
“Three, two…” Richard counts.
But to see Dean just nod shortly at Cas when he turned out alive and well? That was so unlike him. It must’ve been a devastating fight, then, Sam decided. Best to let time heal the wounds.
for me?”
,” Cas says.
Dean shakes his head. No. It’s not pathetic to do anything to save Cas. He is worth it.
Cas fucking
And thank God he’s not dressed in
Jensen can make it happen here.
“Retire, finally. We beat Chuck, Jack is out there creating a better afterlife and after that, probably a better life. For all people on earth. There’s like, some small demon stuff here and there, sure. But we can leave that for younger hunters and have them come by the bunker and check out our library, train them even. What do you think?”
Dean swallows.
And for what? Because he’d made a few jokes? That was just for diffusing any possible tension.
Yeah, this guy with his weird name and his weird fish doesn’t know squat.
“It’s none of your business.”
When the alarm goes off, Cas turns around for the next pose.
Maybe it’s not the right time.
When the men looked up from their instruments, Cas decided then and there he was doing the whole wing reveal against a thunderclap thing. He loved the drama, to be honest. A little divine Plato’s cave for the mortals. And a nice callback to Dean, too.
Hell, it’s been years, but Dean did always enjoy art class in high school, actually. As far as first attempts go, this ain’t half bad.
Loves it, even.
It doesn’t sound like that at all.
Cas moans again, and Dean has never heard a better sound in his entire damn life.
For, you know. Art reasons.
“Hey Miracle,” Jensen smiles.
Cas closes his mouth. Dean sighs, trying to read his face. He looks a bit pissed, but about what?
“Don’t be an idiot, Dean!” Sam tells him off, and releases him with a large, frustrated sigh. “Holy shit, I never knew you were this desperate!”
“Um, yeah sure Claire, he was my best friend.”
His body’s good. It… satisfies the ladies. It gets people to flirt.
Jensen shakes his head. “Nah, no need, he ain’t there.”
Dean frowns. Oh, right. Sometimes he forgets Sam went to college.
Cas looks up, fixing his gaze on him fully. “No. You need to hear this.”
Dean’s in the bathroom, damp towel wrapped around his waist, having a little no-big-deal fucking blind panic after a shower that probably should have been a
Dean can level the playing field.
“The naked ladies, Cas! They’re all missing!”
He drags his eyes upwards, and finds Cas is looking to pastor Richard for further instructions. Thank god for small mercies.
He felt Dean trembling against him, almost pulling away, alerting Cas to the fact that
He’s writing with such concentration - trying to help this Ackles out for when he returns to his body - that he jumps about a foot high out of the sofa when there’s a firm knock on the door.
Cas quietly drops his gaze to his shoes. As if something has fallen.
, Dean,” he says.
It’s embarrassing.
Fuck. Dean’s brain is done rebooting and his once-again functioning synaspes suddenly cackle to remind him that this is an actual case. Cas’ life might be in danger just for posing as a nude model now.
That needs to be rectified. Dean’s made all of his former girlfriends come each time, he’s not about to break that streak. That would be homophobic!
