“This is J.J, he is a prototype Ai system a guardian of sorts he will be there to protect the baby when she is born and I know, why need him if we are there but we would not always be with her to protect her, he's not done yet it still has some added additional adjustments that need to be done but when he is done he will be fully operational” Tony knew he was ranting off but the concern look Rhodey was giving him was working on his nerves.
It took then a short time to get to the factory with their suits looking around before they landed and with a boatload of confusion no guards or mercenaries came running out guns raised and ready to shoot not even so much as a Hydra agent in sight walking toward the door tony was surprised to see it wasn’t even guarded glancing at one another tony turned to head inside but was stopped with Rhodey’s hand “I don’t know tony this seems too easy”
The doctor steps through the door “well Mr stark most of the test states your in healthy conditions but there is something strange that showed up in your blood and urine test”. He reported confident yet confused.
His emotions were running high and he has had a hairline temper trigger he was tired of being cooped up he needed out and with fury's surprise visit a week ago made it worse, he wanted to demand fury to tell him if he knew all along but given who he was talked to he already knew his answer and that didn't help at all so he kept cool, showed nothing slapped on his mask, a mask which usually gave him great comfort, NOW send chills down his back and sat a ball of disgust in his stomach, he hated the lies, necessary, but still he hated them.
“It’s not okay, we have guests coming over. We can’t not give them food. You know how Bucky is. I know where to get a ham though. So don’t worry.” Peter huffed as he closed the door to his room and rummaged through his coat pocket before he found the card. After that he stumbled over to his desk and poured himself a shot of NyQuil before downing the red liquid.
The first part of this chapter took me forever to wright. Seriously. I would type it up, delete it, and retype it again and again. I don't really like how it turned out, but I have to post something eventually. I'm sorry.
“I dunno...maybe ten minutes?’ Peter said carefully. “I didn’t want to wake you up...but then you woke up all by yourself,” the little boy explained.
“We’re back at the compound upstate. But...I went there. Pepper,  they were doing human experiments. There were so many dead woman and children and...I took some back with me and...Pepper,” Tony stammered. “I can’t do this alone. Steve is here with me but I can’t...I can hardly look at him and-”
Hi everyone. I know this is an extremely late update. Sorry about that. Life just kinda sucks right now.  -- On the bright side, there is an update. Not a lot happens in this chapter, but I just wanted to get it out there and let you guys know that I'm still working on this thing.
Sitting on the couch, Peter turned on the TV and flipped through the channels till he found a movie to watch.
“Aunt Pepper!” Peter giggled as egg spewed from his mouth and onto the table and plate underneath him.
“Jarvis,” Tony said, as if that was the answer to his question. “He has eyes all over the city. But most importantly, all over my tower and the surrounding block. After the battle, he alerted me to the fact that there was another Captain America...and another Ironman. And I know for a fact it wasn’t me,” Tony said as he fished out his phone. After fiddling with it for a moment, security footage appeared in front of him. The first was a shot of 2023 Tony flying in the broken window of the tower, behind everyone else before jumping back out. Suddenly the footage changed to Steve and the 2012 version of himself fighting one another.
“Steve,” Tony suddenly said, his voice raw. “Oh my god. Steve, it’s actually you,” Tony said, his words slurring as he began to make his way over to Steve. The blonde was concerned that Tony would hurt himself on the glass and in an attempt to keep him from injuring himself, Steve stepped forward. Tony practically fell into his arms as Steve pulled him close and away from the shards of glass.
“Steve Rogers. Always the gentleman,” Pepper hummed, a small smile on her face. “Well, I’ll let you go then. But get some sleep when you’re done. That’s an order soldier,”  Peter said.
Tony immediately thought about how he would get there, and seeing as he was taking additional people from the location, he obviously needed a jet. But a jet would take too long. Tony didn’t know if he could stay sane the entire flight. It was too much time to think, and he needed answers. In the end, the billionaire pinpointed Steve’s location (thanks to F.R.I.D.A.Y.) and set up a jet to meet him there. It had a pilot and medical staff because by the way Steve was talking, they would need some help. After that, he took his suit.
Tony and Steve were not the only ones in the room, though. In fact they were causing quite the scene. They hadn’t publicly announced they were together, yet, so many people were watching. Some of those people included Sam, Clint, Natasha, and Bucky. They had been watching the entire scene go down from the bar.
And the thing was, things were amazing. The dinner on the river was intimate and beautiful and Tony enjoyed not having to worry about anything else except for having a good time with the love of his life. They talked over dinner before going out on the deck to watch the city as they floated by.
The inventor let out a heavy sigh, his head dipping slightly as he tried to decide if he could tell this kid “no” a second time.
“Boss,” Friday commented. “I would suggest that you don’t wait much longer with this task. It will only make it worse, and I’m sure the boy is uncomfortable.”
3.) I had a general idea about where this fic would go, but I wasn't really sure after about 4/5 chapters worth. Now I have a good idea, but I'm thinking about changing the name of the fic. (Honestly I didn't know what to name it in the first place) Thoughts on this? Please let me know!!
“Remember, just hug Mr. America tight. He’ll make sure nothing bad happens to you. And since I’m here I’ll protect you to. If Tony hurts you, I’ll beat him up.” Steve said, holding Peter tight so that he couldn’t squirm away from Tony.
“And I could say the same to you,” Loki hummed. “Good luck Captain Rogers,” Loki said before disappearing in a cloud of blue smoke, leaving Steve behind.
“And then he just left me for dead. My suit didn’t work, I was bleeding everywhere and...God, it was cold,” Tony huffed, his body limp as he leaned into Steve. Honestly, the blonde was not expecting Tony to be this bad off. And he knew it was foolish of him to think he would fine.
“My savior has arrived,” Tony proclaimed as he tried to pull Peter back to his earlier position. “Mind holding the kiddie?” he asked as he turned to face Steve. The blonde strode into the room, closing the door behind him and in a moment he was in front of Tony with open arms.
“I’m not sure, but they didn’t express interest in him. Either way, I should probably be there with you as well. I’m sure there is some legal paperwork one of us will have to fill out.”
Tony was quick to lead Pepper over to the bed where Peter was quietly sleeping. His eyes were closed and his long lashes tickled his cheeks that were pushed up from the way he was sleeping against the pillow. Peter’s face was not peaceful. In fact it was very obvious that he had been crying, and a drying wet spot from the tears was evident on Peter’s shirt, but Tony tried to ignore that.  And to top it all off, the Captain America plush was held tight against Peter’s chest as he slept.
The mind stone was the next thing to be returned. After using the time stone to restore it back to the staff, Steve was careful to put it back in the case, next to his younger, unconscious, self. As if he had never taken it in the first place.
“Good, I would hate for you to be stranded in some god forsaken time that’s not yours,” Tony said, giving the man a wink as he began to get out of the car. Steve saw this and quickly did so as well so now they were both standing outside of the car, looking at each other from opposite sides of the vehicle. “Take care of yourself Steve,” Tony then said as the quantum suit surrounded him.
“Well…” the Doctor said as he tilted his head from side to side, the pitch of his voice going up slightly. “It honestly looks like who ever was doing this stopped in the middle of what they were doing. It’s obvious that Peter has heightened senses. Especially hearing. And I’m sure when we get an optometrist in here, we can see about Peter’s eyesight. But honestly, that is all I see that’s enhanced. I’m not sure if other things will appear as he grows, but it does look like whatever they were doing is incomplete. I’m sure some sort of foreign material would need to be introduced into his body before the full enhancements took place. Luckily for you, I’m one of the only doctors on in the country that specialises in enhanced individuals.”
And at first Steve was worried that things might not work out with another version of himself floating around, but surprisingly that never became an issue. Because Thanos’s invasion never happened, there was never a reason for 2016 Steve to get back in contact with Tony. In fact, the man stayed on the sidelines for years. And it was strange, because each Steve knew about the other, and both kept their distance. Twenty years down the road, the Steve Rogers that was native to the timeline died. Killed while on some top secret mission. -- And Honestly, Steve Rogers never would have thought he would attend his own funeral, but he did. And it was weird. He vowed never to do that again.
“I’m still scared,” Peter muttered sleepily, “But you’re back...so it’s okay.” Tony was so taken back by Peter’s statement that he honestly didn’t know what to say, and that gave time for the little boy to ask another question. “Why did you come back?” He suddenly asked.
“Nope. Don’t want to hear it Cap! I said it’s going to be okay, so it’s going to be okay. I’ve seen your true colors today Mr. Rogers,” Tony said as he suddenly stood up, only to look down at Steve. “So when my Steve does me wrong, I’ll know there was some form of positive intent. I’ll know that this sappy Steve Rogers is out there somewhere, madly in love with me,” Tony said with a smile. “We’ll see you in a few years then,” he said before patting Steve on the shoulder and walking away.
Pacing back and forth tony didn’t even want to think about what was happening to his little girl or how scared she should be, he shouldn’t have left it was his fault he shouldn’t have left he left her unprotected, he didn’t blame pepper he knew that she was a busy person with running his business and now helping him with trying to protect his daughter with all good it did she’s gone kidnapped by the very man he was trying to protect her from, it was all his fault.
Tony listens like he was told, like every single one of them told him to but it didnt matter because even that was wrong, sign the accord to keep control wrong, keep Wanda in the base for her own safety wrong, trying to bring in Barnes safely so he could get the professional help he needed Wrong, Steve was so close to signing the accord so close for tony to get a better grip on their shaky situation to amend and revise the accord to better suit them and not give the corrupted more power than they wanted he was close if only the brotherly love steve had for Wanda didnt peek its head out, internment, merely confining one to a comfortable location so her blood doesn't paint the streets red was far from internment and for her to use her powers to defend herself would have muddied the water more than it already was, he was losing his grip fast but he refused to let go, then the attack happened Barnes got triggered steve went after him, Wanda left the base along with barton leaving a broken vision behind after that the airport fight and a two faced Natash, to be honest, he wasnt even surprised not since the first time they met, steve and barnes got away Rhodey and sam giving chase only for Rhodey to... fall taking the beam ment for Sam bringing Tony close to a heart attack then he would have liked, the rest of team cap gets locked away in the raft which barton blames him for of course he couldnt blame him tony even blamed himself for some of it.
“Boss your blood pressure had skyrocketed and at your state that is unwise,” Friday said it wasn't like he already knew that but something wasn't right his stomach was tight almost at the point it hurts.
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
“what did you want to discuss with me, Mr. Stark” T'challa ask as soon as they stepped out in the warm yet humid air.
“we will always be there for her Tony, me, you, pepper, happy, vision, hell even peter and Charles will be there and speaking of how was your talk with him anyways,” Rhodey asked with a reassuring pat on Tony's leg earning a smile from Tony.
“Friday Call Charles tell him were coming for a visit tomorrow,” Tony Said tucking his daughter back into bed hoping she has a dreamless night.
“Why,” Tony asked simply he should have known it wasn't going to be easy hell he expected it but for him, not Rhodey.
Standing tony started swaying and his sight blurred the mind connection must have taken a lot out of him but he wasn’t going to stop him from going to get his baby girl back “I found her she’s in an old abandoned shoe factory in Brooklyn”.
Looking around Sam spotted Natasha standing by the window not really admiring the view and by the way, she was working her lip and her crinkle in her brow told him she was concentrating on remembering something he just didnt know what.
“Yes thank you, but that is not what i wanted to discuss, ever since Enchanted humans or Mutants came to be in the world they were mostly run by the UN, judged unfairly due to their gifts” Tony explained.
“Come on Mason, it's dinner time, you want your food don't you nice yummy yum in you're tummy” Tony tried to coax mason out of her hiding place but he knew she wasn't going to fall for it since she hasn't fallen for it the other times they had tried it.
Those words haunt tony endlessly, it been a month since the attack on Hawaii and tony couldn't get that moment out of his head, steve was right there, right there but Tony couldn't do it he should have told steve but he couldn't do it, does Steve deserve to know yes he does, does steve deserve to be part of his own daughter life most definitely, every fiber of his being wanted to tell him, just a big part of him deep down didn't want Steve to know, so he didn't tell him and God doesn't that make tony feel like shit.
“Charles?” a voice called next to him, turning his head he looked at hank he shook his head to clear the fog Charles to wonder what had she meant about mason destiny and only she could discover it and that she had survived for a reason made his gut clenched mason will always be in danger due to her gifts she had but was this another stone in her path of life or was it the meaning of her end he sure doesn’t hope so to lose such a brilliant, sweet, and kind child would be too much of a loss for the world she could do so much in this lifetime and she had wormed her way into his heart he couldn’t even think about losing her “Charles are you okay” hank ask again.
“Tony I took my eyes off of her I didn’t watch her close enough, we knew she was in danger but I still didn’t stop it from happening it was my fault she got taken from us” pepper whispering at the end new tears running down her face and he couldn’t take it anymore tony took pepper in his arms allowing her to cry on his shoulder.
An Explosion rocked the building as they announced their arrival, no alarms had gone off to warn Hydra of the upcoming attack thanks to Dr. Halliway it should be easy in and out, Charles had also volunteered the X-men to help in Tony's rescue but they knew if the world found out about it there would be too many questions that were going to be asked questions they didn't need so it was a three men op, they just hope they can get to Tony in time.
Tony cursed mentally he really need to control his emotions and not broadcast it to mason accidentally but he couldn’t close it off completely that would mean he couldn’t feel masons either and he wanted to make sure she was okay at school during the day so he kept it on with caution “Oh sweetheart don’t worry about that daddies are supposed to worry it our job”.
“Rogers, what the hell are you doing here,” Tony asked ignoring the way his body vibrated with energy with Steve presents he looked older with his beard and messy hair, his suit looked well cleaned and repaired.
*Rogers DNA* the only DNA tony found was Barne's unless *oh god, i need to get out* as more memories sent tony head first into a panic attack.
Walking into the medbay the doctor was there along with vision worry echoing on his face ever since their heart to heart vision had been more and more support going to almost all of Tony's doctor appointments not really communicating just being there for him,Tony was glad vision had decided to stay with the Avengers instead of leaving on his own, the pain had gone away while they were in the elevator it had only lasted a few minutes which was strange Rhodey still brought Tony to the medbay just to be sure there was nothing wrong with the baby.
Enchanted individuals paying for crime they didn’t even commit due to hate and fear individuals being dragged out of their home and treated as freaks for something they had no control of and what they were born with kids being bullied because of who they were being kicked out of school no less and being traumatized by people who wants to use them for their own gain T’challa forced himself to swallow the bile that rose in his throat cursing as he read a family of mutants killed out of fear and the man that committed the crime was patted on the back and walked way without punishment for committing murder his blood was boiling and this was only the first folder.
“I'll go pack a few things and get my kids ready,” she said turning towards the house but stopped“ where are we going to stay”.
Landing next to rogers as the team finally got disposed of the Monsters “Rogers you need to go, go before i do what i have to do” Tony said hearing the sirens of the authorities get closer tony know if they get here before Rogers was gone tony was going to have to arrest steve and he didnt want to do that not after steve saved both Tony and their baby go he wanted to tell steve but it wasn't the time or place.
Settling his hand on Tony's hips “God Tony you feel so Good” Steve said panting as he grabbed tony's ass grinding him down hard “please tell me you've got something here”.
“No, no, no” tony panted frantically when he didn't see Dr. Halliway among one of them she was the only one he could trust and she wasn't there, they pushed him out of one room into another he felt a wave of ease as he saw Dr. Halliway came into view everything went over in a flash they moved him from room to room as they tried to get him out of there before the Avengers could get to him but with the labor and his contractions coming closer together there weren't much time left, his baby was coming and she wasn't waiting for anyone.
“No” Mason screamed jumping in front of Tony as the gun went off the searing pain rocked through her body as the bullet lodged itself into her chest nipping her heart sending her over the other side of the bed with the force of the blast, she could feel it, she was dying she didnt want to but if she had to do it over again she wouldn't change a thing a child deserves to have a chance at a normal life and not some toy Hydra could play with, turning her head Mason looked at where Tony was laying he was staring at her with horror, sadness, and anger she only had a matter of second she needed him to hear her for the last time.
Nothing could go wrong, this had to work since  few of the guard had disappeared and the camera system was fried the rotation of the shift had become a frenzy guard filling in for the ones that were gone, it was a perfect time to put her plan in use there for Dr. Mason Halliway had contacted Virginia potts, she didn't know exactly the right person to have contacted but it had seemed to be the right choice as she was put through to Colonel Rhodes and Charles Xavier they had already found Stark's whereabouts (How they found it she had no idea) but they didn't exactly know the place or how to get in it, to have someone on the inside was a safer bet they didn't want to tip them off and allowing them to escape with Stark and the baby, So this had to go right Stark's people were arriving in 2 hours everything was prepared for what's to come.
He could tell they were enjoying his pain he was in, he stayed cuff to the bed for 21 days so his wound could heal and be removed with minimal pain it was torture being cuffed to the bed being cleaned and fed taking the last bit of his freedom it took him a week to heal and walk again but then they came again with more guard so he didn't fight they didn't want the same thing to happen like before so they came prepared for it he couldn't remember what they did to him they knocked him unconcience after that, they left him alone which was strange the guards didn't abuse him as they use to which was on the plus side that and the more food before they gave him barely scraps.
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
Tossing and turning tony could not get to sleep he had maybe an hour or more sleep in before he woke up again the sun was starting to rise and he already knew vision was in the kitchen the smell of bacon was starting to make his stomach turn in the worst way he hated that feeling
Tony hated Hydra, No he despised Hydra if it was a person he would beat it over the head with a rock before killing it painfully, being tied to a table or so say bed again have lost its appeal, back then he would have loved being tied to a bed but now all he wanted was to be freed so he could go home, he didn't know for how long he was there he was 8 months along, but he knew if he didnt get out before he went into Labor they will take his baby away from him and use her for god knows what, over his dead body.
“Whoa Tones easy everything is alright,” Rhodey said soothingly trying his best to calm tony down keeping a gentle grip on his shoulder.
Rhodey knew tony was having a hard time lately with everything he been through along with the pregnancy and not to mention the things he still needed to do, pepper was trying to hold off Ross while tony recovers but he was stubborn if tony doesn't go see Ross or even call him Ross is going to take things into his own hands which was going to be a disaster he will show up here unanticipated at any time and that can't happen not with tonys present state they needed to come up with a plan to deal with everything and try not to put too much on tony's shoulders work together even if he's not going to like it.
Feeling a hand move up his chest tony turned his head to look who it was when he put his sight on a very naked Steve he only had a blanket over his lower body “Steve” tony gasp steve was in his bed how he didn't know but he was there naked and he couldn't bring himself to care
Completely deep in thought he missed vision facing into the Entertainment room and put his hand on Tony's shoulder making him almost jump out of his chair Tony had made sure to stay out of visions head he didnt want to be like wanda even if it was just with tech he also stayed out of his out of Dum.E, U, Butterfingers and also Friday unless they talked to him first it just felt wrong, they were like people to him even if others dont see it that way.
There standing was mason as the age she was now, wearing her blue top with butterfly patterns all over along with a jean, oil spots littered her pants her hair was braided while few strands hang into her brown eyes that had specks of blue, but he could already sense that this wasn’t the real mason it was something in her eyes that made him feel small, weak and useless, it was deadly and dangerous not something you see in a small six-year-old.
“I’m sorry your highness I need to take this” Tony said before standing phone in hand getting a nod from the king tony walked to one corner of the room answering his phone.
“Boss a vulnerable spot has opened right below their tentacles” Friday informed Tony who turned toward Rogers.
“I found her” rhodey called out as he picked mason up of the ground they had searched for hours everywhere in the tower for her but hadn't found any trace so rhodey had suggested they check at the compound and sure enough she was there.
With a small nod Charles took masons hands in his own “I want to go into your mind look around to see if I can help you in there but ill only go if you give me your permission” Charles explained he could see mason was thinking it through by the way she nibbled her lip and how she wrinkled her nose it was kind of adorable.
“So how do we keep that from happening again,” Tony asked rubbing his hand over his face stress showing vividly on his face.
“So what do you guys wanna do? …Since the monument is out of the question,” Clint said, obviously not looking too happy. He was itching to explore beyond the areas they were only allowed to step in.
Steve’s eyes snapped open, his heartrate soaring from the loud voice. His anger quickly subsided, it being replaced with an almost fond exasperation once he saw a blonde-haired male peering at him from above. His arm was circled around a cooking pot while the other held onto a large wooden spoon.
Wanda’s heartrate increased, watching the horror unfold before her. Her hands shook; she had to do something. She couldn’t be afraid, not especially at a time like this.
The person stepped back and…transformed his physical appearance. Steve’s eyes were unblinking when he saw his own self looking back at him, albeit with a staff and device on hand. The person quickly reverted back to his original form.
Beside Clint, Wanda glanced down at her watch, noticing how fast the time had gone. It was 2:21 P.M, already nearing the middle of the afternoon. They would be back home by 4:30 at the earliest.
Seldom using her actual powers, Wanda opted to train in close combat. Coulson understood this due to her unpredictability of them and the trauma she faced from being forced to strain herself to the highest degree by the facility. Wanda had never unlocked the full capacity of her powers as much as Hydra wanted her to, regardless of how young she was at the time. After they escaped, she was taught to suppress them because Coulson knew the extent of what could possibly happen if they were left unchecked.
“We haven’t fixed the car yet. We can’t go anywhere, unless we want to walk for hours to the nearest store and carjack someone else’s vehicle,” Tony spoke up.
Tony saw Wanda rushing towards them. His eyes briefly darted to the scene ahead of them. Natasha and Steve were beginning to struggle with the Hydra soldiers. Much to their chagrin, there were more than the initial eight they had to deal with. Though, Clint had managed to get the cylindrical weapon, a rifle specially manufactured by HYDRA, working. With his perfect dexterity and enhanced sight, he was able to shoot some of them down, but it wasn’t enough as they kept swarming in like ants. Just how many were they?
and they prepared for it, down to this exact moment. They specifically made sure they wouldn’t be heard, not by anyone, not even by Steve’s heightened senses, until it was too late.
Steve pushed himself away from Natasha’s hold before heading towards Wanda. He could see the soles of her feet no longer touching the ground as a crimson cloud of energy surrounded her. Truth be told, Steve had no idea what he was doing but any second wasted wasn’t worth it. He or the others didn’t have to deal with Wanda’s powers spiraling out of control, for as long as he could remember. The facility, however, had many mishaps involving her unpredictable powers. This was uncharted territory for them.
Finally, Wanda was the youngest at sixteen. She had a quiet but strong personality. She often left the more pointless squabbles to her older friends. Although they’ve all known each other for a better part of eight years, she was naturally secretive and very hesitant to trusting those around her. It was a part of her nature that would never go away. Her getting the harshest treatment out of the six at the facility permanently traumatized her and steered her away from people. Steve was naturally protective of her for this reason alone. She was like a little sister to him.
“Yeah, because of the nightmares,” Steve replied, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Tony’s jolly voice broke through their conversation. Steve and Wanda whipped their heads back and saw that the other four had a head start, their steps crunching through the small rocks and gravel.
Once Natasha had set the gears to neutral and lowered the brake, Steve headed towards the back of the vehicle, ready to push. The red-head firmly clutched onto the steering wheel as she watched Tony run up to the front, keeping a wide distance between himself and the stationary vehicle.
Steve’s blue eyes darted to a cylindrical weapon one of the men held. He had no idea what they were, but what he knew was that these men were obviously here to take him and his family.
The bickering voices of Clint and Natasha became louder as he left his room and went down the steps. He didn’t bother to change out of his sleepwear, opting to do that after eating a late breakfast and apologizing for keeping everyone else waiting. Steve was naturally good-natured like that, some of the others often rolled his eyes at his do-gooder persona, but he never quashed it. Old habits die hard.
“Tony, do you by any chance know how to turn this thing on?!” Clint frantically asked after trying to decipher what the hell kind of weapon it was. He stopped, noticing the other was trying to comfort a very anxious and agitated Bruce, “…Shit.”
It was silent between them, the only noise being the occasional chirping of birds and the gravel coming into contact with the tires of the car. Natasha’s eyes were glued onto the clear path, one that wasn’t engulfed by large rocks or trees.
Wanda lifted her hand with a certain calm. She shifted her fingers, her middle and ring fingers lower than her index and pinkie. She made sure her heartrate remained steady as her eyes were deadlocked onto Bruce. Her blue eyes turned crimson for a split second as a quick stream of red energy emitted out of her pulsing fingers. The energy ray drifted into Bruce’s head, instantly causing him to loosen his hold on himself. The green tinge on his skin slowly faded away, his natural olive tone coming back.
Natasha and Clint helped Steve back up to his feet. His entire body was aching. All of those injuries he amassed really did a number on him. At the end of the day, that mattered the least to him. What mattered was formulating a well-thought out but doable plan that involved finding out where they took Wanda, and then getting her back in one piece. He had to get her back.
“We really don’t want to fight you,” The other said. Steve’s eyes trailed down to the breast pocket of his suit, a silver nametag pinned onto it…only, there was no name. A faded, circular black tattoo on his neck was partially hidden behind his suit collar. The tattoo had a simple but elaborate drawing of an octopus, six tentacles springing out of it.
“Okay, but you need to get some rest while we bring the car back to life. We can devise the plan once we’re home.”
“Like shit,” He replied, surprising everyone else by his not-so-colorful language. Although they knew he often did it when he was beyond stressed out. After all, he wasn’t really going be like himself after witnessing his longtime friend get kidnapped by sadistic people who wanted to experiment on her like a lab rat.
Steve’s anger soared the moment he watched Wanda pass out from the fumes of the Chloroform rag. They were taunting him…they were taunting him and his friends on purpose. They made sure he would watch, watch Wanda get harmed by those men as he was too paralyzed to do anything in the first place.
He ran at a breakneck pace, his eyes stinging and his sight blurred. He had to get to them, he couldn’t lose them, not ever. His lungs were burning, the adrenaline leeching into his blood. It felt like the longer he ran, the further his friends were moving away from him.
“Hey, hey! Wanda!” He crouched down and brought her back up by her shoulders. Much to Steve’s relief, she was still awake. Her eyes were no longer crimson; her normal blue irises were back however unfocused they were.
Steve couldn’t finish his sentence. With a forward jerk of her arms, she sent Steve flying back a few feet. The side of his cheek scraped against the rough gravel on impact.
The dreams were all the same, only with slight variations, every time he had them. Hydra agents would find out about their top secret living area: break into it, knock on the door, ring the doorbell – whatever they could do to enter their home. Steve would try to run, defend himself, fight them, anything to protect himself and his five other friends…but he always lost. Regardless of what decision he tried to make in those lucid dreams,
“Such a mother hen,” He mumbled, his lips tugging into a coy smile. He reached up to fix his own hair once Steve removed his hand, “Its fine, I’ll live with it.”
“Don’t like that nickname you gave me,” He mumbled, before continuing in an audible voice, “What do you want me to do?”
…How Steve wished Tony could translate the seriousness and urgency he had towards his work outside of his work.
Steve coughed up blood before drawing his brows together in confusion. Clearing his blurred sight, he saw Natasha electrocute one of the Hydra soldiers with their own shock tonfa before running towards him. With the help of her extended arm, he was able to pull himself up.
“Hey! He’s down now, so I’m eating,” A very hungry Clint said, seeing Steve enter the kitchen from the corner of his sight. He attempted to grab the patty again.
Wanda was an enigma. They had known each other for more than ten years and lived with each other outside of the facility for eight years, but Wanda often kept a thin safeguard between herself and the others. She would only ever confide in Steve and occasionally Clint about how she was truly feeling when the time came to it. She loved her friends,
“Yeah, that’s easy enough,” Steve replied. Not only did Steve possess super-strength, marked with the ability to lift a maximum of 800 pounds, his abilities spanned endurance, agility, strength, and speed beyond the peak of human efficiency. Steve’s healing factors were enhanced and he had near-immunity to harsh impact. Hydra often tested for and looked at his extensive list of powers and saw him as a possible combatant for them. The thought of that terrified Steve beyond belief.
“Twice this week now,” Steve said, sinking down in his seat, “At this rate, I’ll be having them every day by next month.”
He brought her into a hug to which she returned. They let go of their short embrace, Steve giving her a quick but reassuring smile. Wanda couldn’t return it. Instead she peered over Steve’s shoulder, taking in the extent of the damage, a good deal of them caused by her powers alone. Some of the Hydra soldiers were knocked out cold, their bodies sprawled out against the ground while others could barely stand.
“If that doesn’t go well, then it’s unwanted attention for us, which is what we don’t need right now, or at all,” Bruce added.
That was why they were valuable assets to Hydra. Hydra’s facility in Siberia experimented on humans, gifting yet cursing them with special powers. How they were acquired by the facility was a mystery to them, but the six knew they’ve resided there since they were babies. Their first memories involved the invasive experimentation by men and women in lab coats who only saw them as their valuable possessions, weapons. Then Coulson, a former S.H.I.E.L.D agent, had broken all protocol on his undercover assignment to Hydra’s Siberian facility and rescued them. He had taken care of the six – he educated them, taught them useful life skills, and loved them as if they were his own children. Losing him was easily the most difficult predicament they’ve faced since leaving the facility.
That, compared with Tony’s innate interest in mechanics and engineering allowed him to learn such complicated tasks at a very fast pace. Steve was often amazed by Tony’s capabilities and the amount of ease he brought into their lives with his ability, even with Coulson gone. He thought it was such a contrast to his occasionally childish attitude and his inability to take things seriously outside of his projects.
“You spend way too much time on the internet, dude,” Clint said, “Is what you’re describing even a thing?”
“I don’t know,” Natasha replied, absently dragging her fork against her plate while her other hand cupped her chin.
“Clint!” Natasha shouted, grabbing the fallen cylindrical weapon right before another soldier could grab it. She flung it forwards, watching Clint catch it with ease.
Because of this, school was out of the question, doctors were out of the question, living quarters within close proximity of other humans was out of the question,
Steve frowned, a little taken aback by Bruce’s sudden deviation onto such a question. He knew what the other was trying to do, but he quickly assumed that it wouldn’t be much of any help as much as it helped Bruce deal with his own afflictions.
Just to say this again, they don’t have wings, but their original superpowers, some of them with superpowers based on their abilities (if they weren’t superpowered in canon). The six main characters who are taken from that facility and live together are Steve, Tony, Natasha, Clint, Bruce, and Wanda.
Steve drew his brows together, noticing a slow-walking figure heading towards him. They sported an outfit distinct from the uniform the Hydra soldiers wore. He managed to blink out the tears, trying to focus his sight. He could see the soles of their shoes upfront and close as they came to a stop.
“I’ll make do with what we have. There’s a lot of useful junk in and outside of this house,” Tony replied, noticing the other’s disbelief. He tapped at his head with his finger, “Do you forget what I have up here?”
“Steve!” Wanda yelled, causing Bruce to put a sudden halt to his words. She saw Steve get slammed in the head with the back of a titanium baton. The blonde fell forwards, the impact sending a shooting pain through his skull. When Steve tried pushing himself back up, he felt the baton collide with his ribs.
There was Steve, the eldest of them all at eighteen. He was the undesignated leader of the group. Though, it was natural of him to take on that role, due to his age and especially after Coulson had left all those years ago. His no-nonsense, cautious demeanor and acquisition to lead brought this on. Next came Natasha, who trailed a few months behind Steve in age. Her cunning and savvy personality made her the most adaptable to the world outside of them, at least compared to the others. It was why going out for a trip to the faraway grocery store didn’t faze her too much. If they ever found themselves in a sticky situation, they were confident she’d be able to get them out of it.
The sounds of painful thuds and shouts tore away Bruce’s attention momentarily. He saw Natasha closely dodge an electrified tonfa, light blue electricity fizzing out of it. She landed a roundhouse kick on the Hydra soldier who carried such a weapon before sinking down to the ground and tripping him over.
“Come on, deep breaths, deep breaths,” Tony said, his form crouched down next to the other. Bruce was on his knees, his hands firmly cradling the sides of his head. His body was trembling, his breathing heavy and frantic.
“Fuck…” His voice was strained as he watched his surroundings turn dark, the spotlight of his friends within the darkness becoming smaller and smaller. Everything felt like slow motion, his running feeling slower by the second. It felt like he was running in something viscous.
“How are you feeling, Steve?” Bruce was the first speak. Beside him, Tony was uncharacteristically silent, a level of concern clouding his features.
“Let me finish; I haven’t gotten to the good part,” He easily interrupted Steve, earning a cross of the arms from the other, “I’ve been designing schematics for the types of repairs I’ll be making on that car.”
He could slightly tilt his head, blinking to clear his sight muddled from the tears. He could see that same helicopter they initially saw before this all went down. It was much closer to the ground, the propellers causing a torrent of air to rush towards them.
“And since your so concerned about the welfare of the Avengers, don't, I'm already working on a way to change the accord and get them pardoned and to be the first few to know i plan on retiring from both the Avengers and Ironman,” Tony responded.
“The Whole World, Where is it coming from,” tony asked making his way up the stairs he couldn't take a chance with the elevators.
Wakanda was an absolutely beautiful place with the mountains that almost surround the vibrant city that boomed with life and the people going about their day as if they didn't have a care in the world but he knew better everyone has problems.
“I do understand that the Avengers or any other Enchanted individuals operations such as the Avengers, Earth defenders, X men, and Shield needs supervision the people are entrusting their lives in our hands and that is a trust we cannot lose but Giving even the United Nation that much power of deployment whenever and wherever they deemed fit its just too much I'm not saying their all not to be trusted I'm just saying there will be times where power like that could go to a person's head and they will abuse it and innocents will get hurt” Stark explained T'challa could see where stark was coming from he knew there are many unsavory characters within the Government that liked to hide in the back and also play with the higher powers strings to get what they want.
“She's there,” Tony asked the feeling of dread ebbed away knowing she was in safe hands and knowing Charles would protect her.
Walking toward the living he sees pepper sitting on the couch tapping away on her stark pad “hey didn't see you here Tony is asleep if you wanted him”
*I know baby we will come to get you but you need to do something for daddy first okay I need you to focus on everything around you the smell the sound anything you can think of okay can you do that for me* Tony asked again before he focused his other senses hopin,g it was going to work.
Glancing at the clock Tony noticed it was only early afternoon and he was already bored“ Okay Peach its time for a walk” Tony said sliding out of bed feeling the numbness in his legs as he stood he hated the feeling“Let's see if we can get Friday will let us in the workshop huh”.
“I'm so sorry Tony protect her and love her like you only have a day with her and tell my son I'm so sorry i never wanted this to happen Dont waste this precious opportunity you'll never get it again,” Mason said panting through bloody coughs blood running out of her mouth, giving him one more smile before she took her last breath.
“They’re great and all but I can’t take care of them like a can a puppy,” Mason said as she placed another piece of metal on the robot puppy that she was building.
Watching as tony talked on his phone T’challa studied Tony’s features he had noticed the confusion on his face when this pep had called as if not knowing why she would need to call, as fast as the confusion came and went as Tony’s face pales anger and fear showed on his face something must have happened.
Everyone had told Tony to listen, to follow orders to be a team player at first he didn't listen he didn't want to but then he was warming up to it, getting to know the team even trust them built their armor and weapons looked after them, spend time with them, he grew to care for them and they (dare he say it) became a family.
“Well I'm sorry you feel like that if i could make it better i would, but you do know what they say about safe sex tony” pepper said pulling a laugh out of tony, god how he loved this woman.
“Sweetheart you see daddy he got into some trouble with some very important people because they wanted to hurt his friend so daddy went to help him and that made the important people mad so now he has to stay away so the important people don’t find him and his friends and put them in a very bad place” tony said kneeling in front of his Daughter one hand holding hers and the other brushing the curls out of her eyes.
Finding the strength Tony stood from the bed and walked sluggishly towards the nursery rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, it wasn't until he reached the door he realized the crying had stopped and the temperature had dropped with the feeling of unease tony opened the door, instead of walking into the nursery tony had walked back into his own room but it was deferent there was no comforting feeling or steve sleeping in the bed only a darkened room grayed from the storm outside with rain that pelting the windows and on his bed lay a female figure rolled into the fatal position body shaking with heavy sobbing, Tony couldn't see her face but as he walked closer the thick whisper of words reached his ears “I'm so sorry i let you down PaPa i should have saved you” Said the figure shakingly, an overwhelming feeling of emotions rushed through Tony he reached out to comfort the figure but only reached an empty bed the figure had disappeared and the room around him lit up till the point he couldn't see anymore.
“Still pouting tones you know it's for your own good,” Rhodey said standing in the doorway, Tony Stark does not pout his lips aren't even plumpy so how could Rhodey see he was pouting in which he is not, he wanted to scream at Rhodey but he knew it wouldn't help he was bored, his hands are twitching his body was vibrating with energy he wanted something to do, he needed something to do.
“Mr. Stark is recovering quite nicely, and due to the serum in his blood he would recover faster than he had before but he would still be out for some time the procedure had taken a lot out of him, you can go see him if you like”.
Grunting tony halted emitting a groan from steve missing the friction, Tony leaned down grabbing his pants, pulling out (convenient) packed of lube and throwing it back down, straddling steve's thighs again tony tore open the packed and added a considerable amount of slick in his palm and slicking up steve's Cock as he was about to slick up his fingers to loosen him up for Steve, Steve grabbed his wrist.
Tony hummed half-asleep half-awake he knew after every nightmare mason had ever had she had trouble falling asleep so tony stayed awake until mason was fast asleep again “why are you mad at daddy” mason asked softly the question taking tony by surprise he didn’t expect that from his daughter no less in the middle of the night.
Sighing run a hand through his hair, Tony felt like he was going nowhere it's not that he wasn't doing anything but because it's going so slow, Tony liked fast and getting things done, its already been three weeks since Tony found out due to his now screwed up DNA he was a mutant and he was also related to Barnes, it was starting to give him a headache.
Stepping out from behind vision peter stepped toward tony putting his hand on his shoulder and helping tony up “sorry mister stark but this place was not easy to find” vision stepped  forward helping Peter get tony up from the floor tony whispers
This is not a part of the story i just wanted to give you something special steve will meet his daughter in a later date and another story part injoy
Starting from one corner tony went through a the tower, living room, kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, masons playroom, the lab, tony's workshop, even the gym, and med bay she was nowhere as Tony came back to the living room tony started to really panic when a shrill ring sound of his phone echoed through the room, grabbing the phone tony saw Charles name on display, why would Charles be calling him.
Rhodey knew that pepper was worried he didn't forgive her for hurting tony but he could try and understand.
He wondered when it became morning he couldn't have slept so long he always woke up before the sunrise no matter how late he stayed awake.
“he wasn’t in his right mind back then sweetheart something bad had happened to your uncle and he was very hurt and we didn’t know if he was alive some bad people come for him and hurt him some more but I have forgiven him for it but papa is still mad at daddy for not telling him” tony said
“Where is this coming from Charles,” tony asked he didn’t like the look of concern on Charles's face he didn’t know if he wanted to find out what it meant.
“Good evening Charles, right now is not a good time,” Tony said as he answered the phone still walking around searching where he thought he hadn't looked.
“Yes on occasions but how far will that stretch before or after someone innocent gets hurt and the ones responsget gets away wi,th it,” Rhodey said.
“Even if you did find someone they would say the exact same thing at least wait until its almost his due date unless you want to lose both of them then all that work wasted because you didn't want to wait”.
“Mr stark will not be answering any questions there for no question will be asked or answered” pepper finished and gave way for him to take the podium.
It was almost ten when tony had finally gotten Mason to bed she had put on a struggle she had also been fighting sleep the tiny yawns was adorable but as soon as Tony started reading to her she lost the battle of sleep after he put her in bed tony headed down to the workshop trying to get in as much as work as he could before he too loses the battle of sleep.
“uh You know i just realized something,” Rhodey said pulling their attention away from his daughter to him standing next to them.
“It was counterproductive, like the king he couldn't give me his full support he understands why i want to do it but unless i get the thing going he can't help me and i can't get things going until after the baby is born so i can be more publicly available” Tony explained.
Shaking her head“No the Dora just told us the king requested our presence I know not to ask questions” Natasha said turning her head toward T'challa arrival followed by his Dora bodyguards.
“Tones you've been asleep for almost two days I was starting to get worried, ”Rhodey answers opening the door allowing Tony to go out first as they made their way to the kitchen.
“Arent you supposed to be out, how did you get in,” Tony asked he didn't want Rhodey to see him as this Ross had never gotten to Tony before but Today was a bad day he felt uncomfortable like everything was pushing to tight on him and pulling.
Tapping his fingers against the conference table“ yes stark I did notice although for someone who has been kidnapped recently I would have thought you would take some time to yourself”
Shaking his head tony raised his arm and fire up the repulsor with no intent to shoot“No we don't, you need to go Steve” Tony said he could see Steve wanted to say something more but before he could Natasha grabbed him by the shoulders trying to steer him toward their quinjet.
“I can see that sweetheart what do you say we make it work,” Tony said as he was about to stand to look for the necessary thing to make her little bot work Mason grabbed his hand pulling him down again.
He would bet that the procedure had taken out of tony it wasn't every day you give a c. Section to a man before nor being pregnant either.
“No, you don't we can survive without you tony” Rhodey Snapped the minute it left his lips Rhodey wanted to take it back the absolute devastation on Tony's face made his gut twist in guilt he didn't mean it that way “Tony shit I'm sorry I didn't...”Rhodey started but stopped when tony held up his hand.
“how could you let them get him you where suppose to stop them do you even know what you let get slipped out of your greasy idiotic hands you morons, the testing, the procedure and the DNA fusing and combining took to him to his blood fused with his DNA and for what now his gone because YOU could not do your fucking job” pointing his finger infrond of the head guards face spittle flying out his mouth as he yelled at them he needed new people those that listen and do their job without making excuses but that was hard to come by he needed to get stark back and fast the last test they did come back positive and that is what mostly failed with all the other patients he needed to do more tests but he couldn't and that was a problem he was not willing to accept “find stark and bring him back I don't care who you have to kill to do it just get it done” debroski orders watching as they left.
Passing back and forth Rhodey waited for any news it's been 6 hours since they had gotten back and he was getting worried, what was going on, was tony alright, was the baby alright, the door burst open and a very worried pepper and peter stepped into the waiting area.
Shaking his head Rhodey hated his stubbornness sometimes“What about shield” Rhodey ask it had been years since shield/Hydra had fallen well not completely they have been working off the radar and in the dark ever since doing god know what.
“It's good to see you awake stark,” Gaurd McCrawl (as tony had dubbed him now) said Running a hand up tony's ankle towards his knee “it would make this so much more fun” he continued rubbing tony knee there was an echo of chuckling in the room as the Guards cackled the feeling of dread run up his spine as McCrawl's hand went higher up to his thigh resting near his crotch.
Not to mention nausea, bloating and cramps the odd dreams, however, he can deal with they ward off the nightmares he's getting more sleep in then he had in years
As it got louder and more forceful, he couldn't stand it anymore for the fear and the adrenaline came to much to bare he felt himself start to lose consciousness when a massive force of energy erupted from the car causing the other two cars to flip and roll.
“Steve?” Natasha asked, and he looked at her, feeling shock starting to roll over him, now that he was away from Tony. Rhodey sat beside him, and Sam knelt in front of him, resting his hand on Steve’s forearm.
Steve shook his head slightly, his lips pink and parted, his blue eyes smoking like an opium den. Tony lusted and despaired.
“Well you know, if you don’t have anything and you’re stuck, you could always start by writing a scene in a coffee shop. Make the barista devilishly handsome and madly in love with the main character, who is a Brooklyn hipster writer with a bad attitude and a heart of gold,” Tony said, and slyly slipped a cup of something frothy and sweet onto Steve’s table. By the time Steve realized what Tony had just said, Tony was already behind the bar again.
he shouted, jumping down beside him, hands fluttering uselessly. Tony hit his head on the corner of a table the way down, a gash in his scalp matting his hair with blood and smearing garish red on the floor when Tony tried to move. The unnatural angle of his left leg indicated that it was broken. Tony stared up at Steve with wide eyes and pale lips, a gurgling sound coming from his mouth along with a sputter of blood.
“Tony, he’s not here. You can tell me the truth,” she murmured, using the hem of her dress in a futile attempt to wipe a bit of blood from Tony’s lip. “How long has he been treating you like this?” Tony batted her hand away, dropping his head.
“On the house. It’s cheaper than you going through a pound of sugar a day in your black coffee anyway.” Tony grinned again, then waggled his brows. “I get the impression you like things sweet.”
“Steve, I didn’t-“ Tony said, and his words were cut off into a gasp when Steve’s fingers twisted in his hair and he found himself thrown across the floor, sliding hard into the glass window, a similar move to what they’d practiced countless times while sparring. “Stev-“
Steve looked up at Tony, who studiously kept his back towards Steve, scrubbing mugs and banging espresso grounds into the trash. Steve couldn’t believe that there was any way Tony felt the same, but it had to be true. The lingering touches, the excuses to make conversation, the drinks, the art, the laptop…
“You all right over here?” Tony asked, sitting across the table from Steve again, another drink in hand that Steve completely ignored. Steve shook his head, his damn eyes prickling in frustration.
But this time, his muse wasn’t there, with his dark hair falling over his forehead and sharp goatee looking nothing like what you’d expect from such a non-corporate place. Steve glanced about, seeing him nowhere, then scowled back at his computer. He closed his eyes, trying to imagine the scene he was working on, and let his fingers type as they pleased.
“I can’t. Thank you, but- I can’t,” Steve said, rushing to pack up his things and get out of there as fast as he could, humiliated as Tony called after him.
“So why the secret?” Natasha asked, expression almost offended, and Steve could guess it was because they hid it right under her nose and she never suspected. Steve shrugged a shoulder, his cheeks pink.
“Whoa! Hey, Steve, man, I didn’t mean to upset you, you were just doing what you had to do,” Sam said in a rush, worry pinching his face. Natasha rubbed his back between his shoulders.
Both of them jumped at the shout, and Tony’s head shot up to see a line at the bar, where his friend Rhodey was the only barista working.
Rhodey jumped up and went to the TV, not even bothering to find the off button, and just yanked the cord out of the wall a little too violently. He returned to his spot beside Steve, and silently offered Steve a box of tissues. Steve grunted gratefully and took a handful, wiping his splotchy face and wet eyes and blowing his nose.
“I can’t go again,” Tony protested weakly, a tired smile pulling at his lips as Steve brushed his fingertips up Tony’s inner thigh, tracing idle patterns in the dip of his thigh, until Tony laughed at the tickling, pushing Steve’s hand away. Steve only resumed his lazy touching, kissing Tony’s shoulder, laying against his side as if he were made to fit there.
And now Tony was so still, frighteningly so. Steve’s lips pressed into a thin line, and he strode to the ICU door, only to be stopped by two hands to his chest.
“It’s okay, Tone. We’re gonna get help,” he rambled, not even thinking about trying to find the shooter. “Just stay with me, okay? Stay with me, we’re gonna get you fixed up. Tony?
Steve crowded Tony against the edge of the pool, stars and fairy lights sparkling on the smooth water that lapped against their chests. Tony craned his neck to give Steve room to nuzzle him, then gasped lightly when Steve bodily turned him, pressing Tony’s chest against the edge of the pool.
Steve vaulted up onto the stage, just as Tony crumpled and stumbled backward, collapsing off the back of the platform and falling some six or more feet into a jumble of tables and sound equipment. Steve couldn’t get to him in time, and his gut turned to ice when he heard two sickening cracks.
Steve didn’t stop though, and Tony fell into a hazy, pleasure-pain drenched cloud as Steve fully used him, coming on his back, in him, holding him tightly enough that Tony’s hips, waist, throat, neck, and nipples would be covered in dark bruises. Steve managed to tease Tony’s cock mercilessly until he took pity on Tony’s incoherent begging to tear another orgasm out of him, but at that point the oversensitivity began to crawl in Tony’s skin, his nerves firing unevenly, his cries becoming louder, higher-pitched, more pain than pleasure.
Steve blanched. Tony was always filled with life. Vitality. He was vivid and loud and charming and a whirlwind of constant motion and brilliant thought and crackling energy, even in his brooding silences. He bled life into everyone around him, and all Steve could think of was how Tony had bled his life right out onto the floor of the conference room.
“Well when you say it all like that, I guess I would have followed me, too,” he said, giving her a small smile as his irritation began to dissipate. “Just don’t shoot him, okay? You better talk to him, I guarantee you he feels like the worst person in the world right now and is second guessing everything he’s ever done in his life.” Natasha chuckled, and Tony squeezed her hand. “I’m grateful to have a friend like you Nat. Someone who cares enough about me to follow me and rescue me from my kind, adoring, beloved, and sexually gifted husband. But don’t do it again.”
“Can I get a small cup of black coffee, please?” he said, smiling happily at Tony, and just like that, Tony’s smile lit up the entire planet.
a tech guy. And not in a hobby sort of way. Like, in a let me fix your shitty computer sort of way. You are personally hurting my feelings by using that thing in my presence,” Tony said. Steve immediately hugged his computer to his chest.
Tony didn’t respond, just nodded feebly, and could feel Steve’s heat nearby, as though he had knelt beside him. Tony flinched involuntarily at his touch, before leaning into it blindly.
you. I don’t care how much money you have, I own you and I swear to god I will take what I want out of you, when I want it, and I don’t care how fucking much you scream.”
“You’re welcome, Stevie. I mean. Steve. You’re uh, you’re welcome. I need to get back to-“ he said, fumbling his words as he jerked his thumb at the counter. Steve smiled at him, letting go of his hand so Tony could get up. Steve fumbled in his pocket for a moment, and held out 73 cents.
