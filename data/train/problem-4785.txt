Cas just stares at him. If there were ever words in the English language, he has forgotten them all. It’s all angel screeching in his head.
Cas’ alarm beeps and Dean falls nearly out of the couch.
Dean looks over his shoulder, suddenly missing Cas. Where’s the angel?
“What about…” Cas pauses. He looks suddenly so small on the bed. “Did you mean the thing about Crowley?”
All that time, and Dean never gave him the credit for being so much stronger than he looks.  At least with clothes on.
Isn’t he? Maybe out of all those stories, Cas’s sexuality is the one thing those fans actually got right?
“And you could have
He wasn’t ever embarrassed about… whatever. Down there. He didn’t think about it much.
This is it. It’s turned into gay chicken now.
Cas swallows, and even straddled, he bravely pushes through. He closes his eyes and moves his thumb over Dean’s lips.
It takes all Dean’s strength not to move his hips, thrust into the hint of a touch. After all, right behind that eraser is the feel of Cas’ fingertip, the small ridges of his skin. So close, but so out of Dean’s reach.
“Cas?” A familiar voice by the doorway startled him.
Kansas died on a Thursday.
After momentarily leaving this plane of existence, Dean moves down Cas’ body, hovering over Cas’ underwear. He rubs his cheek against the soft cotton - barely - restraining Cas’ hard dick. Cas rewards him with another moan. Cas’ dick
“I don’t wanna talk,” Cas said abruptly, surprised to realise it was the truth. “I’ve said enough.”
Wait, have they?
But Cas shakes his head. “Do you need me for another scheme? The strength of an angel? Is that what this is?”
Sam shifts uncomfortably in his chair. Neither Cas nor Dean is looking at the other, they’re just both frowning at their hands, completely still as if they’re posing for a painting.
Dean turns to drinking. Anything to stop hearing…
Cas’ fingers hover over the dried up bloody handprint.
A few hours later, he’s woken by sunlight slamming into his throbbing head.
. I’m not-”
Is he… embarrassed?
“Whenever you’re ready, Steve.”
Cas frowns. “I don’t know any Fr…”
“I swear, if you’re gonna throw some five stages of grief psychoanalysis at me like this is a Thursday night soap opera—”
Dean met his eyes. “Tell me again,” he said in one quick breath.
It’s a question, a longing, it’s everything still unsaid.
“I don’t know what you’re getting at, Sam”, Dean mutters, trying not to sound defensive.
“Eight. And it’s very stressful to organize events of this scale, you know.” He stepped a little closer to them, menacingly. There would be no escape from this roadhouse.
There’s an images section with what looks like… obscene drawings he’s not even going to click on. Nope. Staying the fuck away from that, and actually, he should sue Google for even subjecting him to that ungodly sight.
Dean ignores his clenched stomach. If Cas says so, he should, yeah. Trust him.
Dean opts for the latter. At least this’ll count towards his correct, heterosexual end result!
Chuck smiles. “Jack, you had to be there. Really, you had to.”
Soon, there’s salad and lasagna and wine and too many uncomfortable silences where there should’ve been laughter.
Yeah, actually this is a pattern — Dean’s always underestimated Cas.
Cas increases his speed, rutting harder against him, making him feel every fucking inch of his hard dick.
Harsher and harsher lines appear on the paper, and Dean can see Barb frowning at him out of the corner of his eye. He tries to calm down his breathing. Who knows, she might be a creature, a thing, and he shouldn’t tip her off on something being off about her new BFF Iggy.
“Everyone, this is Steve,” pastor Richard says.
Suddenly, they’re in the bunker again. Dean, Cas and Jack look right at Sam, who’s rubbing his jaw.
It feels goddamn impossible to find Cas in this place. But from Jack and Cas’ previous experiences in the Emtpy, it sounds like things find you, not the other way around. Dean tries to trust that process, and focuses on thinking about Cas.
Cas remains mostly quiet, except for the occasional hum or whimper that seems to come from so incredibly deep within.
After a short pause, he says dryly: “I am posing.”
No. Dean’s gotta stop now. He’s gotta redirect his mind, or start talking smalltalk with Cas, which’ll probably be worse.
Cas! What’s this, the Icelandic Phallological Museum?
Cas doesn’t move a muscle. Until, almost imperceptibly, Dean hears an exhale. He tries to make out Cas’ shape. Cas draws in another breath, and Dean can’t help but marvel at him, this timeless being that’s breathed in the very first molecules of air, and would have probably breathed in the very last, if he hadn’t become human.
No, he reminds himself. This is not a strip club.
“You don’t talk to me. You… avoid looking at me.”
“I… I know I told you in the Empty, but honestly you seemed a little out of it. I just wanted to make sure you know… what I said to you before you got taken… Well. I didn’t mean it. None of it.”
Just like in a fanfic.
“Bloody hell,” Richard yells from the director’s seat, and Cas’s face flips back to normal, looking maybe even a little sad.
Despite this perfectly clear re-enactment, Eileen frowns. Sam turns the laptop around so she can watch the frankly embarrassing scene play out live with him.
He stills, and glances down. Cas is looking up at him, in that peculiar way of his, like he’s studying him.
Cas opens and then closes his mouth, and for a minute Dean thinks he’s going to ask Dean to leave, but apparently he’s decided to not even mention he frigging knows Dean. To not even acknowledge he’s in the room.
Not like Dean! Dean is fine with homosexuality.
Slowly, Cas reaches into his front pocket and retrieves a ripped piece of paper that Dean recognises. It’s a page from the script.
Cas’ lips fall onto his, and there is something that awakens in him.
Maybe it’s because Cas has run out of luck. Maybe it’s because he’s a former angel and the mojo doesn’t work on him. Maybe he’ll never be back.
Dean doesn’t feel worthy of receiving this revelation, but he also doesn’t dare move.
Next up:
Dean’s bum twitches.
Cas grips him tighter.
Dean stops him, because hell — he doesn’t need the actual history of this monster. One bit of info, and one bit of info only is what matters to him now.
He can feel Cas’ intense gaze on him.
Dean looks up at Cas. Huh? He looks pissed again, even more so this time. What’s that for?
After Billie sent Jack into the Empty to safely ‘explode’, it had been made Loud. But what did that mean? The Empty did not strike Dean as particularly noisy. On the contrary, there was something unsettling about the quiet. Quiet implies a counterpart of noise. This was just… absence. The way a hole in the wall is just there by courtesy of the bricks, it is not anything in itself. It is a shortage of the other.
Dean bites his lip.
It’s Dean.
“That’s not all it’s
“I love you,” is the shape they make.
Back in the bunker, Kevin is looking for sharp objects to gouge his eyes out.
There’s a gurgling sound behind him. He looks over his shoulder, tears filling up his eyes as he watches a black oily goo drawing a shape on the wall.
The MONTAGE shifts to images of Dean trying to pick up women, scenes of Dean talking to John and Mary.
Just Jimmy going about his day. Wandering the streets, for no reason at all. Definitely not in the hopes of bumping into Dean.
Sam can only barely make out the white glow because they are so close. His brother stares at their connected hands well after the wound has disappeared, with such concentration as if he is desperately holding something in.
“It’s the dumbasses,” he signs to Eileen.
He looks at the last remnants of drawings floating in the bath, then at Dean.
He stares at a bunch of meaningless pictures. Books? Yeah, sure he likes books, who doesn’t? What’s with this guy giving the devil a lap dance? Bro. Why not put a giant “this is the gay answer” neon sign on there while they’re at it?
His dick agrees.
Cas sighs deeply. Maybe Dean is an angel because it feels as if that hand is sending grace through him.
“Dean,” Sam says, ready to tell his brother exactly what is
“For what?” Cas asks, and he is not entirely sure his face hasn’t turned into that heart eye emoji Jack kept telling him he was using wrong.
He picks one up with trembling hands.
He should take it for the warning it is. But the thing is, Dean is nothing if not stubborn.
He opens his definitely secret Spotify account and puts on
in this universe?
Cas doesn’t reply, and Dean ignores the knot forming in his gut at the uncomfortable way Cas’ shoulders are tensing in the passenger seat.
It is absolute hell to stay sober for 24 hours. Not because his body craves a drink - it does, and it hurts - but because his mind is not nearly cloudy enough.
He spots Cas and beelines over. The angel’s talking to Gabriel.
So Sam’s noticed some tension. So what? There’s been conflict before, and worse than this. Sam should mind his own damn business, that’s what.
Cas opens the door and squints his eyes. Dean feels pinned like a butterfly to the board. “Is it some sort of witch's curse?”
“You kind of are, Cas,” she says, hitting him right in the heart. He turns to her.
Dean laughs. This is no normal family, that much is certain.
“Fuck,” Dean breathes.
by the kiss, Mr. Ackles. What happened there?”
Sure, plenty of girlfriends have seen him naked.
Beautiful. Framed by moonlight, dark and open and… vulnerable.
“Dude. Your name is literally Castiel.”
Dean has no choice but to turn his phone back on and redo the quiz, going with different answers each time. None of them anything he himself would actually choose.
“My name is Jimmy Novak,” Cas says as convincingly as possible. “I’m from Pontiac, Illinois.”
. That first time was just a shock response. Give a man a break when he’s switching bodies like switching channels.
Dean has a thought. “Lie on your back,” he orders the angel.
“Don’t make me read sexist headlines, too, in half an hour, Jensen,” Richard says, shooting him a strange look. “We’re filming you from the chest up, remember.”
Not bicurious.
He wonders what Cas is feeling right now. Is this just another Tuesday for an angel? Did he used to have a lot of angel sex? It doesn’t matter, Cas is human now. Does angel sex feel different than human sex? Did it feel good? Did Dean make him feel good?
alive.
He squints at her.
“We can’t…” Dean tries again.
Hm, come to think of it, maybe his anti possession tattoo stopped working?
In one breath, Cas crosses the space.
Brief reminder that this is tagged as angst with a happy ending...
It was too much.
After a long pause, Cas speaks up, in that low and determined voice he uses when Dean is being intentionally disobedient.
in heaven. “You
? This Cas made a deal with the Empty??
Cas is carrying a suitcase.
“You’re… you’re.” Dean’s voice is flat.  He tucks his hands into his front pockets. “You’re Jimmy Novak.”
Dean meant to think the word friendly.
“No, no, you’re doing great, buddy,” Dean says quickly, cursing his own stupid words at the loss of the slick content, and Cas squints at him. “I just… fuck. I think I might… soon.”
Like that’s a normal thing to say.
“For taking that deal with the Empty. For… for springing that on me like that. Then just leaving me alone with it all.”
Aw, he looks so nervous.
Fuck. It’s been years since he thought about this song.
“Wait, Sam too? Oh. Time really moves too fast up here. There’s still too much to be done, Jack, the guests…”
Another silence. He listens to Sam’s breathing. It’s grounding, sort of.
, the quiz asks him.
“Choose a side,” Cas says, tipping his head to indicate he’s talking about the bed.
Uh. Jensen tries to school his features. He didn’t go to improv school or anything.
Cas looks up. “If you think I’m embarrassed about the human body, I can assure you, I am not. I saw your kind molded into shape by eons of divine evolution. I saw your bodies emerge from nothing, dust and mud, water and sacred energies. The human body is extraordinary, Dean. I will not be complicit in your making a mockery of it.”
He lets his hand travel slowly down Cas’ spine and then sneaks it around to his front, searching for Cas’ dick pressed between their bodies. He finally reaches it, and just a brush of his fingertips against Cas sends a shiver through his entire body. Dean exhales shakily. It’s the first time he’s touched another man’s dick. Ok, ok. This is fine. He’s fine.
Ben grins. Dean isn’t sure the sarcasm is coming across.
“Excuse me?”
A living body in a crime scene.
Chuck tilts his head, then, in a flash, he is gone.
“So Dean,” Claire blurts out after her second glass of chardonnay. “It’s almost as if Cas is here, isn’t it?”
He’s gonna regret this worse than the night he clicked on a link in the author’s notes and it took him to - what was that horrible site called - right, Tumblr.
“Oh, sorry, it’s just something I was wondering. No reason. I’ve just got a… curious mind.”
Dean briefly pushes his eyes closed. He’s shaking with anger. “I am not a
“Ohhh, finally,” she whispers, winking at Dean suggestively. “One for
Claire’s eyes grow big. “He
dad, too,” Claire says, and Cas frowns but suddenly behind Dean, there he is.
Though it’s not distress, not sadness. It’s peace.
The other attendants abort their conversations and snacking, and find their seats. A wrinkly man in a French beret glares at him. Dean reckons he’s stolen the guy’s usual spot. Well, tough shit. No way he’ll sit front and center across from some naked chick. He doesn’t even do that at the strip club. Seems disrespectful. He’s quite happy in his chair to the side of the stage.
Dean’s hand moves over the paper like he’s being puppeteered by some higher force.
“I merely observed that you hadn’t had many chances to drink yet, Dean,” Cas says. “I figured the point of this game was consuming alcoholic beverages.”
Dean breathes. Sam is right. This isn’t helpful.
“Ah, yes. I’m Iggy. Thanks for letting me join the group this late in the, uh, year.”
Dean holds his gaze. He is strong. His eyes will not falter. Not slide down that… pink pathway of temptation.
is. But best to get it over with quickly so they can get their shirts back on.
“Dean, I can’t help it, it’s the Word of God, and I’m a prophet.”
“Yes,” Cas says. He pushes his ass backwards again, to Dean’s fingers.
They’re digging deeper into this ancient couch than expected. Doesn’t have much bounce left.
“Errr… It’s not a fic, it’s a prophecy.”
He keeps remembering Cas’ tear as it slid down his face, even though he’d stubbornly, bravely been holding it in.
said?”
Cas blinks at him, and clears his throat.
Sam smirks at Dean from the safety of the floor and ostensibly stuffs his phone away in his pocket. Dean wills lasers to shoot from his eyes, Cyclops-style, but Sam ignores him and focuses on the movie again.
“The nude modeling pays good. It’s honest money, Dean,” Cas continues. “Pastor Richard told me they even raised the cash payout, to 30 dollars per session!”
Dean reads on, eyes glued to the pages.
?” Dean suggests, glancing at Cas.
Sam just stares at him, angrily. “This isn’t funny, Dean.”
Then he pulls back. Cas is gazing at him with quiet blue eyes. Waiting patiently, but there’s no timer that’s going to go off and prompt what Dean has to do or say next.
One just runs away in a panic. Another demands answers he can’t really give her.
“I know you’re not a homophobe, Dean,” he grumbles, voice never lower. “You don’t have to try so hard.”
Dean releases a shaky breath.
Cas pauses, mind elsewhere. When he proceeds, he sounds angrier. “But I did. And it changed you, Dean. You barely look at me. You don’t want me to touch you unless I heal you, unless you can use me… and then lately… And
Cas wraps his arm around Dean and spreads his fingers on Dean’s chest, over his heart. It’s pumping like a car engine on a hot summer’s day. Dean’s afraid to move his hand up, too. That would be too much anyway, of course. Holding hands. Just… no.
“Welcome back dude,” Sam says, hugging Cas. Jack joins in. And then, after a little hesitation, Dean does too.
up against his face.
Why must the Lord test him like this? Oh right, yes. The homophobia.
“You know, eh, Sam. Actually, I was thinking we should quit hunting.”
“For sticking up for Cas. I know you had a… complicated relationship with him.”
“Okay,” Sam says. “You’ve given me a lo… something to work with. Nothing you can do from that motel room, though. I’ll wake up Kevin and we’ll hit the lore. But you should get a few hours in before the church opens again — before your, uh classmates are awake for questioning.”
“Those stories don’t just appear out of nowhere, Dean.”
well they kinda moved on to this
The last Dean and Sam they met were a bit off to the left, that’s all. Sam’s man bun wasn’t even the worst part.
Dean walks over to his duffel bag and digs around for his toothbrush. It’s in there somewhere! Shit, does he have a spare one for Cas? He’s pretty sure he does.
But he is not going to fuck this up for Dean.
Cas jolts out of his frozen state and turns to Richard. “Yes?”
It feels like a punch to Dean’s gut.
CASTIEL
“You ready?” Dean asks to distract him. Not that
The movements grow more and more aggressive and suddenly there’s a squeeze of fingers on each of Dean’s asscheeks.
It’s a job Jensen’s dedicated fifteen years of his life to. Dutifully. He acted, he directed, he went to cons, posed for fan pics with a surprising amount of handholding with Misha for some reason, he retweeted The CW tweets for fuck’s sake. He’s been
“I’m glad,” Dean replied. “I really want him to like me, if I’m being square.”
“We need to clean up and I need to get back…” Cas said quietly, frowning as he turned to look at the alarm. “You have to leave in an hour.”
“Ah-ah-ah,” Cas pulled his hands back up by his wrists. “Nope. Not right now, old man.”
” Castiel rocked him and Dean in his spot, his heart shattering as Dean remained still in his arms.
Cas cried out. “Right there!” He moaned brokenly and Dean lost the last bit of willpower he had to hold off his orgasm. Slamming his hips into Cas with reverence, he crushed his mouth onto Cas’s, slipping his tongue in for a second before he had to pull away to breathe.
“Can I ask…about the scars?”
Cas bit his lip and whined again. “Please!”
Dean’s hands came up to rest on Castiel’s hips and Castiel noticed his scent change. It grew heavier, and it made that heat flare in Castiel’s abdomen.
“It’s you, too,” Castiel said, tilting his head back for Dean.
“Dean?” He whispered, because it was all he could manage at the moment.
“And you think he loves you?” Lucifer scoffed. Cas recoiled by pushing himself up and out of his chair.
“You don’t understand family, Cas,” Rachel said, and huffed out another dry laugh. “You don’t even understand what it means to be in a relationship.”
“Yes, father,” Cas intoned. He held up his papers and began reading back what he'd written.
Dean crushed his lips onto Cas’s and slid his tongue into his mouth to tangle their tongues together again. They both moaned and panted into each other’s mouths as their hips moved together, slowing down at a steady pace.
"Me," Dean whispered, burying his face in Cas's neck. "Me against you."
!” He heard multiple shouts call from the main deck before he felt several hands on his arms, pulling him back up.
“I understand,” Benny said and took one of Dean’s hands in his own. “It’s okay.” Dean sobbed again, gripping Benny’s hand. “Mates,” Benny whispered after a few minutes. Charlie and Sam left after giving Dean hugs.
Yet, it didn’t help to calm him now. And it certainly didn’t help to keep him focused from not running into anything on his way home; because one moment he was laser focused on the sidewalk in front of him, and the next he was laying on top of someone on the concrete.
“Sure. Because you’ve had
Vocab You’ll Need For This Chapter:
Michael raised his hand and cleared his throat to gain Meg and Crowley’s attention.
he’d accepted that that was just going to have that be a part of who he was for the rest of his life…but then Cas had come along and changed everything. Cas helped him to
“I can’t say it enough or with as much meaning as I want it to have,” Dean continued. He pulled Cas up into a sitting position, standing between his legs. “I love you so much.”
before he swiftly crawled on top of him and slotted himself between his legs. “Happy birthday, my angel.” He pulled Cas’s cock out and gave him a few quick strokes, making him gasp in surprise. Dean smiled smugly and gave Cas a quick kiss before sliding down to be level with Cas's groin.
“Absolutely,” Cas agreed, nodding. He watched Dean put yet another bite of pie into his mouth. “You’re twenty seven now, then?”
Dean balked. “First, this is our workplace, we have to set an example for the students! No PDA at work. Second, y’all know we live together. That should’ve been your first—” Dean cut short at the guilty looks on his friends faces. “You
“It’s actually the same day of your fight at Hunter Arena?”
“You made all these?” Castiel asked, tearing his eyes away from a sunflower that had such intricate and amazing detail.
Cas breathed out a sob. “No, do it when I get close, again.”
“I don’t know,” Dean whispered, his arms shaking with how much restraint he was using to hold back.
“I can’t—” Cas gasped, “I can’t breathe!” He pushed his face into Dean’s neck. Dean jumped off the side of the house and a jolt of pain spread out through Cas’s body, emanating from his stomach. He bit the junction where the pirate’s shoulder met his neck to stop himself from screaming. Dean’s other arm came around him and he felt wind rushing past him and heard loud, quick steps being taken. Dean was running.
“Dean, please,” Cas moaned around the pirate’s fingers, pushing back to feel Dean’s hard member. Dean removed his fingers from Cas’s mouth. “Oh, fuck Dean, please? I need you now.”
“And that’s the only reason?”
“Whoa there, Cas!” Gadreel said, his voice a little deeper than normal. He’d already downed a few drinks bought for him by some cute betas. “Who gave you that lemon that’s got your face all twisted?”
“Patience,” Dean said, keeping up his leisurely pace.
Dean's been docked for three weeks. His ship is all stocked up and fixed. The Impala's crew are itching to get going again.
Dean shook his head. “That’s not going to happen. You don’t need to worry about us.”
Castiel looked over at Dean and stifled his laugh at the pink that stained his cheeks.
“It was really fun,” Cas nodded, leaning into Dean’s body for support.
“Yeah,” he said, “Yeah, I’m good.”
“I guess so, I don’t know. The one you used to tell me I could say no to whatever you’re planning tomorrow,” Cas could feel himself blushing.
Castiel felt tears begin gathering in his eyes again and when Ellen pulled away she laughed and shook her head.
Castiel wasn’t sure how long he was frozen for, but then the man laughed, and Castiel stopped breathing.
“Oh,” Castiel whimpered, “Yes.” He pushed back to meet Dean’s thrusts, begging Dean, “Alpha, faster!”
Inside it was well lit, and nicely decorated, if a bit dusty. Alfie stood just a few feet from the entrance, and as Castiel caught up to him, he noticed that Alfie was frozen. His eyes were glued to one spot in particular and as Castiel followed it, he saw that Alfie was looking at a man. A tall, burly, and scruffy looking man cleaning a wooden mug.
Castiel let out this cross between and sigh and a whine and Dean could feel his channel getting ready to push him out again. Dean let go of his legs and grabbed hold of Castiel’s hips, pulling their bodies together and keeping himself seated deep inside as Castiel’s muscles worked to push him out. Castiel kept spasming around his cock, and when he mewled loudly Dean gave a firm pull and smiled as it happened.
“What can I do for you, Cas?”
“We saw Abbadon’s ship,” Sam said. Dean nodded his head, getting impatient waiting for the other shoe to drop. “She’s not alone,” Sam finished. Now, even his voice wavered and for Sam to be shaken enough to show it? That meant something truly tremendous had to be waiting for Dean.
“Formal or informal?” Ruby asked.
“Why?” Alfie demanded, blocking the guards from getting into Castiel’s room, “He has not had his first heat yet, you cannot take him. That is what the rule stated!”
“Yes,
“I agree with that, too,” Benny said. Dean looked up at him and nodded with some finality.
she’s talking about. I never cry.” He brought his hand up to rub Ben’s back.
Dean, listen to me.” Benny came over to kneel in front of him. “He’s the son of
“Yes, that is true,” Charlie said.
It had been six years since he’d been home. Castiel had gotten out of his father’s house as soon as he turned eighteen. He got his GED because he’d never been to actual school—he was homeschooled. Or rather, he homeschooled himself because Zachariah believed in self teaching rather than traditional education—and attended a community college for four years to catch up with the gaps in his knowledge before being awarded a scholarship and transferring to a four year. And in the past six years, he had never visited home. Or even
Dean kissed his mating mark and then Castiel’s head.
“I missed you,” Dean breathed hard, “Missed you so much.” He pressed a chaste kiss to Cas’s lips, nibbling on his bottom lip before pulling away.
“Then why do you stay with her, Dean?” Castiel studied Dean, his brows furrowing as this shadow seemed to drape over Dean’s entire being.
“I agree.”
“You wanna come on my tongue, then?” Dean asked, smiling as a pretty pink blush spread across Castiel’s face. “If you want, I’ll go down on you until my jaw is so sore I can’t talk.”
“Actually,” Gabe said, “
“Alright,” Cas said absentmindedly as Dean made eye contact with him and his face lit up. “I’ll see you then.” Dean jogged over to Cas, giving Benny a nod before he hugged Cas.
“Yeah. Um, thanks. That’s actually really sweet.”
“Can I take this off?” Dean asked. He wanted to be able to feel his skin against Cas’s.
“He’s an…” Dean trailed off and Castiel’s stomach dropped.
“More,” Castiel said, forcing his eyes open to meet Dean’s. “Please? Please, I need you.”
“You've done better,” Dean said. “But thank you.”
Dean’s eyebrows shot up and his mouth curled into a beautiful smile.
“What?”
“Oh, no, I have. You simply haven’t changed how you look at me, brother.”
“C’mere,” Dean said, turning Cas around as he backed up to his desk chair. He sat down and sucked Cas’s length into his mouth, bobbing his head a few times, before holding the ring out and looking up at Cas. “You sure you want to?” He asked, smiling comfortingly.
“Helpless,” Cas breathed out, feeling blood rush to his groin. “I see why you’d use something other than stop.”
“The only reason that we even survived and won is because reinforcements came in at the last moment and saved our asses,” Dean said. “I lost a lot of good men and women because of Abbadon. But we won and I—”
“Color?”
“You don’t—it… He…” Dean hit his fist against the table. “You don’t know that. No one knows that. Maybe I could have found somewhere for him to stay safe. We have allies all over the place, why didn’t I think to leave him with any of them? At least then he wouldn’t have had to stay in Heaven and have a wedding looming over his head. If I hadn’t—”
“Yes,” Cas cried, thrusting his own hips in Dean’s hand and heaving again at the sensation of the older man’s length against his own.
“Good.” Jess ran her hands through Castiel’s hair and sang softly, urging him to get more sleep now that his heat wasn’t keeping him up.
“Oh,” Alfie said. His arm dropped from around Castiel’s shoulders, but Alfie didn’t move too far away. “That is great.”
“It is worth a try,” Ellen whispered back, “You understand how brutal first heats are.”
won’t be starting anything and I want them to know that; but we’re not going to go down without a fight if
But everything comes to an end; some things sooner than later. And this time that Cas was happy didn’t last long. The breeze died down, and Cas was left breathing stale air. The same air he’d been breathing his whole life.
“I did whatever I could to give Sam a better life,” Dean continued, “but there isn’t much need for a teenage alpha in the workplace, so…”
“No! Dad, stop it!” he giggled, failing to keep that straight face. Dean laughed and threw Ben into the air again, catching the boy when he came back down and spinning as he did so. Lisa came by and gave them a look, making Ben look away and Dean nod with a straight face. When she walked away, they both hunched in and talking in hushed tones, giggling every now and then.
“Really?” She asked, hope in her voice.
Castiel slowly reached out to grab the angel from Dean, examining it for a beat before he held it close to his chest and looked up at Dean.
When Castiel was twelve and a half, he began the first step of presenting, and his mother stepped back from caring for him. Alfie stepped up. He kept him safe in a way Castiel’s own mother never did. Alfie was family. He became more family than Castiel’s own mother.
Castiel snorted. “Fuck off,” he said, laughing to himself as fire raged behind Amara’s eyes.
Cas felt his orgasm building and started making breathy little noises, never breaking eye contact with the man above him. Dean smirked and slowed his hips, pushing Cas’s hips down into the bed and keeping them pinned there by his own as he dragged their cocks together painstakingly slowly. Cas’s mouth fell open and he started to go limp under Dean.
“But you’re my boyfriend,” Dean said, “My mate someday, if you’ll have me.”
“Sex...” Dean started, smirking at the little gasp that Cas let out. “...seemed like a good idea?” Cas’s breath caught in his throat, preventing him from answering. “Although,” Dean started, moving away from Cas and pulling the blindfold up just a bit to give Cas a peek at him. “If you don’t want to—”
… You’re so used to bad things happening, but good things do happen, Dean Winchester.”
“I love you, too.” Dean breathed out a laugh, sounding close to crying. “I’m going to miss you so much, Cas.”
“I’d never leave
Cas looked up from his plate to see Lucifer. He rolled his eyes and glanced around the mess, noting where everyone was. Dean was with Benny, Lisa, and Sam in the drawing room going over a few last details before the feast, so they were nowhere to be seen. Charlie and Gilda were sitting together, Charlie in Gilda’s lap, while Jo was next to them both, smiling and laughing. If Cas didn’t know better, he would definitely say that the three of them were...flirting? It was quite a sight.
Cas inhaled sharply and moaned. “Yes.” His knuckles dug into the sheet beneath him, turning white from his death grip. He bent his legs up farther. “Please.” Dean moved so Cas could rest his legs over his thighs and stroked himself faster, looking at Cas’s blissed out face.
“I know you said you’re ready, that you want this, but Cas,” Dean whispered, trailing his eyes back up to Castiel’s face. “If you need to stop at any point, tell me, and we will. We can just talk or just ease into it, okay? We don’t have to have sex tonight, there’s no rush.”
Dean couldn’t help his smile as he grabbed a green tea packet and opened it up, dropping it into the mug. “Okay, fine, I’ll get over it. Back to the original question: why did you try and convince me you weren’t a virgin?” he asked, grabbing the mug and the honey as he moved back over to Castiel and set the items in front of him.
inches?
Dean paced in front of her cell. Ava sat on the wooden bed frame, watching him with angry eyes.
“Castiel, I have to ask,” Ellen began, “Has anyone prepared you for what you are about to go through?”
Meg winced again, but said nothing. She kept her eyes downcast and crossed her legs. Castiel could tell by her scent that she was feeling uncomfortable, but she didn’t regret what she said.
“Hey,” Benny comforted, getting onto his knees to pull Dean into a hug. “It’s okay.”
was in
“What? What do you mean?”
“I love you, too,” Dean said, grabbing onto Cas’s hip with one hand while the other came and slid their fingers together. They kissed one last time before Dean settled his head over Cas’s heart and closed his eyes.
“We will fuck tonight,” Cas stated. Dean inhaled through his nose.
“What’s wrong?” Benny asked as he came up to stand next to Cas. Cas looked up at him for a second before looking back at Dean.
of the situation the
that made Dean important to the Garrison.
As Castiel grew older, the farthest he could go from his cellar chamber was the kitchen because only a select few alphas were allowed in the cellars, servants’ chambers, or the kitchen and therefore Castiel was in the safest part of the castle from the most amount of alphas.
Castiel understood that, and did trust Alfie’s judgement, but... Of all the things he’d learned this afternoon, there was one he just couldn’t and wouldn’t understand.
“You are forgiven this once,” Castiel said, “Now that you have your answer, I expect you to let all your subjects know that Winchester is open to all men, women, and children who seek asylum, regardless of designation. And I expect you to allow any who wish to emigrate to do so freely and without consequence.”
A string of curses left Dean’s lips as Cas started to pick himself up and fall back into Dean’s lap. “Fuck, Cas!” Cas couldn’t stop himself from repeating the same words over and over again:
Dean felt his resolve crumble. “Fuck.”
“Fuck you, Dean,” he growled, bolting up and pushing Dean down onto the bed.
The boy and girl laughed as Dean pretended to be dead, but after a few seconds Dean opened one eye and then jumped back to life. He hugged the two children and spun them around a few times before letting them down. The girl ran off while the boy stayed put and reached up towards Dean again, pulling at his pants leg.
“Fuck, Cas, just like that, I’m so close,” Dean stuttered.
“I can tell you thought a lot about this.” Gabe’s voice was bitter.
Castiel wasn’t stupid. He knew what it meant to be an omega in this world. It meant pain and suffering and never being able—never even getting
Dean scoffed. “Get out of my head.” Dean shook his head. “You’re using your powers. That’s not fair.”
“You’re acting odd, right now,” he said. “Why haven’t you looked at me?” Michael made a irritated noise. “I
“Cas, I—”
“Yeah?” Dean husked.
~  ~  ~
He ran his hands up Dean’s chest, opening his shirt and pushed it off Dean’s shoulders.
“Thank you,” Castiel sobbed, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck. “Thank you, alpha, thank you!”
“I don’t know what happened,” Castiel repeated, “Honestly, I don’t. I just want to forget about it and move on.”
“I love you,” He whispered. Dean froze for a second before tilting his head down to kiss the top of Ben’s.
“I…” she brought a hand to her stomach, touching the spot Castiel had held the gun to before bringing her hand up to look at it. “No,” she whimpered.
immediately falling from his lips.
I need it!”
But that good news comes with some bad news: Cas's father has hurt Cas again and it's not just a few kicks to the ribs this time.
were going to end the world. They didn’t even take a fucking
“I only have a few more deals to work on,” Dean said, concentrating on the words he was reading for a few second before they began to swim off the page. “I’ll be done soon, I promise.”
“...bullet hit an artery…”
Dean smiled, looking over at him out of the corner of his eye. “Soon.”
Cas cried out as he sank back down onto Dean's cock. He struggled to keep his hands behind his head. “You’re making me lose my mind! It’s so
For now, they were content with just this.
With the state Cas was in, Dean was about to lose himself.
“You’re in for a hell of a talk when you see Rachel again.” Castiel opened his eyes, blinking a few times to clear the sleep from them before focusing on who was talking to him: pale hazel-green eyes, light skin, wide nose and thin lips. “She’s real pissed,” Gadreel said.
“Nothing,” Lisa said. She wouldn’t look at Dean.
“Yeah, they’re here,” he said.
sensitive.”
“I’m fine,” Dean rasped. Cas hummed out another pleased noise, signaling to Benny he had done an amazing job with dinner. Dean glared at Cas from across the table and mouthed for him to stop. Cas only smirked and brought his fork up to his lips, exaggeratedly licking away the excess sauce. Dean had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep himself quiet.
Castiel couldn’t focus. He had been just staring at his entomology textbook and reading the same paragraph over and over again for two hours. Not even the noises from the café around him had helped him to concentrate. So, when he finished his coffee, he decided to take a walk. And it led him to Manhattan Valley. It led him to Dean’s shop,
sheets. The expensive silk sheets Dean insisted on because
“Are you… Are you still coming?” He asked, kneading his fingers into Cas’s stomach and letting out a breathy laugh as he felt Cas’s muscles twitching and spasming. “No,” Dean said, digging the palms of his hands into Cas’s abdomen. “Not coming, exactly. But you’re not
“What is it?”
wrapped around his little finger. Every single little thing about Cas was perfect and amazing and Dean believed, down to his very core, that Cas deserved anything and everything he wanted.
“I—” Castiel cut himself off as a wave of heat made him desperately push back against Jess and palm himself.
“Put your hands behind your head,” Dean said, using his Captain voice again. Cas locked his fingers together behind his head and looked to Dean for more instruction. Dean raked his eyes up and down Cas’s body hungrily before issuing another command. “Fuck yourself on my cock." Cas whimpered and raised himself up an inch or so. Any more and he wouldn't be able to handle it. "Talk to me, tell me how it feels."
“Omega,” he said, his voice deep and commanding, reminding Castiel just how much of an alpha he truly was, “bite me.”
rough?” Dean asked, quickening his hand. “You’ve got to be the most spoiled angel in all of creation.”
Castiel smiled, blushing softly as he turned around, waving goodbye as he walked to class.
Castiel was going into the ring tonight. He was going up against Crowley, a retired beastie fighter. He’d had a long winning streak until his beastie had been torn apart. He retired just days later, even though a pilot’s entire life was bet on their beastie. To lose was basically to start from the absolute bottom again. Dean knew that that meant he had taken Amara’s deal, and spent the last ten years living a life of bliss. And Dean knew that him coming out of retirement meant nothing good.
“What do you want to know about me?” Dean asked, rubbing the top of Cas’s thighs endearingly.
“Fuck, Dean,” Jo said, exasperated.
"Yes," Cas whined, moving his hips to meet Dean's thrusts.
“Please look at me,” Dean asked, his voice soft and fond. Castiel still didn’t lift his head. He didn’t want to see the alpha’s face if he could help it. It would be better for his peace of mind in the long run if King Dean remained a faceless man, “Please, Castiel. Please look at me,” Dean begged, and strangely—and very, so very surprisingly—something in his voice made Castiel want to do it. Made him want to look at the alpha.
“I… I don’t know what you mean,” Cas said quietly.
“Just one thing?” Dean asked.
“Dean,” Gilda said in a firm voice. “You’re actual colors, they’re beautiful and big and vibrant.” She came to sit next to Dean, putting a hand on the side of his face. “Brilliant blues, greens, yellows and reds. There’s even some white.”
Castiel stopped at the top step and Rachel looked at him questioningly. He stammered as he said, “I, uh, I’m not going to stay at the house.”
Gabe looked from Rachel to Castiel and laughed. “You get it, right? You should be the happiest out of all of us. He treated you the worst.”
Castiel jumped and threw his arms around Dean’s neck, joyously pressing his lips to Dean’s in a excited kiss as the people out in the pews cheered and clapped for him and Dean.
“What do you mean?”
Jo was waiting for him when he got to the main deck. “How’d it go?” She asked, walking beside him cautiously.
“We can be together,” Castiel said, almost unable to even get the words out because of how excited he was.
“Sit up,” Cas instructed, pushing the older man into a sitting position before he straddled his lap. “I want to ride you.”
“Yes,” Cas moaned in agreement, bending his knees up to open his legs. “Please, Dean, please.”
Then, like he could smell the content and happiness from miles away, King John came and tried to ruin it.
“Oh,” Gadreel hummed.
“Yes,” She said, nodding.
“Why?” Dean repeated, and Castiel felt this stab inside him.
“Sounds good to me,” Meg said, darting her eyes to Cas again as Ruby gathered her documents and began making her way out of the hall. When she passed by Crowley’s chair, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her down to whisper something in her ear. Cas heard her giggle softly and gasp.
“You sure about that?”
“You just wanna know because you thought we were gonna lose tonight,” Gadreel said.
“But I mean… Come on, I would never be able to fit your needs. You want an alpha who’s nine inches,” Dean said, grinding down into Castiel and smiling at the way the omega’s eyelids dropped. “I could never compare because—”
“You’re wrong,” Castiel said, forcefully. “
“I do,” Dean said, smiling again at how charming and angelic Cas was. “Other than sore, how do you feel?”
“You should’ve told me. We could have celebrated it.”
A ripping sound followed soon after Dean’s words and Castiel saw Dean holding the belt he’d been wearing. “Worth it,” he said.
"I got caught up at the library," Cas cried harder, his head pounding. "I'm truly sorry."
Cas stared at her. “I can get you as far as the dock,” he said. “But I can’t promise that he’ll let you onto his ship or into his crew.”
“I am happy to hear,” Dean said, and a small pause followed, “Is Castiel willing to speak to me?” he asked.
The next thing he knew there was an ear piercing boom and he was falling off the bridge, grabbing onto the wood just in time with his good arm before he plummeted into the quickly churning water below him.
Number Four was Gabe, and he was a beta. He was what Jo called a trickster, because he could alter reality if he tried hard enough and had a clear enough head. He was loud and boisterous and hardly ever tried hard enough or stayed sober enough to be able to conjure an alternative to reality. Last Castiel had heard he was in rehab.
“I’m not upset,” Cas rushed out, sitting down on his bed with his back to Gabe and crossing his arms as his uncle flopped down behind him, stretching out over half of the bed.
Dean lifted his head up to look at Cas. “Are you sure?”
It was because of his apathy towards the wedding, and his future, really, that Alfie had finally broke and took things into his own hands.
“How was it?” Gilda said.
“I’ve some good news,” Michael said suddenly. Cas heard him walking over to sit down at the table in the kitchen usually only the staff sat at.
“Cas!” Dean yelled, enveloping the young man in his arms and holding him tight. “I got you, baby, I got you!” Cas buried his face in Dean’s chest and clutched onto the pirate. “I got you.”
“I love you, too,” he breathed out, running his hand through Dean’s hair.
and the fact that Dean was close to
of Dean using his alpha voice? That was something else.
“So, um, dinner,” he said, “There’s actually a little grocery store right by your house I like to go to sometimes.”
“Wait, Dean—”
“Now,” Cas demanded, grabbing onto Dean’s bicep tightly. “Now, Dean!”
Castiel was actually quite excited to meet him. “I would enjoy meeting Sam,” he said. Dean smiled again.
Dean was an alpha, which made how beautiful he was just that much more unfair.
“Please.” His voice came out strained and suspiciously like a whine. Dean chanced a look down at his groin and saw that a small bulge was beginning to form.
as my father put it. The only reason I'm  not going is because Michael thinks I'm going to thwart his attempts to repair the irreparable." Cas sighed. "Oh well. He's just... He's... Stressed."
Dean joked, turning around as he spoke. The sight he was greeted with made him almost drop the spyglass and Cas giggled before taking it out of his hand. “I’m dreaming, aren't I?”
“Fuck you!” She screeched and turned back, sweeping her leg out in hopes of knocking Dean off the bridge and to a watery death. Dean laughed as he grabbed a handful of her hair and tossed her down the bridge towards her own ship. The downward angle helped and she had to scramble to gain purchase.
“And Ava is going to pay,” Jo said. “Everything is fine. Cas doesn’t have to worry anymore. He’s okay, you’ve taken that weight off his shoulders.”
shape.
The next thing Castiel knew, his body was being lifted up, what felt like miles, from his face-planted position in his pillow. He felt an involuntary whine escape from his throat before he was being lowered back down. He sighed as the coolness of the new pillow soothed his burning skin. And then... As he inhaled, the most amazing thing he’d ever smelled overtook his senses and he couldn’t stop the pleased little noises he made as he tried to burrow deeper into the pillow.
Dean smiled and laughed, leaning down and kissing the young man beneath him. His hands came to push Cas’s shirt up to pool under his arms. Cas whined into Dean’s mouth and pulled his shirt off the rest of the way.
“Omega—”
“You are right,” she said, frowning and backing up. Meg looked back to Castiel and gave him a look of apology, “Alas, I see no reason to not say my thoughts about any matter, therefore, I can come across as inappropriate or aggressive when it is not my intention.”
“I know sometimes you don't think you're a good person or that you're not enough for me… But Dean, you are enough. You’re so much more than enough.” Cas came around to face Dean again. He undid the string keeping Dean’s trousers up and helped Dean to step out of them. But he didn't stand up, and instead he sat on his knees, running his hands over Dean’s legs and closing his eyes. “I know you think these scars you have…” Cas started, feeling his heart clench again at all the variations of skin he could feel on Dean’s legs. “...make up who you are, and that who you are is an ugly and unlovable person. But that's
A long enough while later, long enough for Castiel to almost speak up again, Dean’s voice filtered in through the door. “I did,” he said.
"Dean," Cas whispered in a rough voice. He planted his feet and fucked his hips down in a calculated way that had Dean's digit inside him in a second. Cas yelped loudly at the burst of white hot pleasure that shot through him violently.
“Oh, I thought I’d heard a party going on over that way. Happy birthday,” Dean said.
“But I just got my pie,” Dean said, raising an eyebrow. Cas’s eyes widened in panic and he started to fidget.
“‘M fallin’ asleep,” He whined. Dean had to stop himself from laughing at how drugged Cas was at the moment.
Dean quickly slid his hands back down to where Castiel’s wings attached to his back and grabbed them there. He used his grip to tug Castiel down into his lap as he pushed up. Castiel let out a short scream as lightning flooded his vision, and thunder clouded his head.
“Well...” Castiel chewed his lip now, a million thoughts running through his head at once. What to talk about first? The fact that Dean had a replacement in line in case he became like his father? The fact that Castiel didn’t have to accept his intent to court? Or the rumors that Castiel had heard about how his betrothal to Dean came to be?
“Alfie?” Castiel asked, “Who is that?”
“Hm.” Cas furrowed his brows in concentration. “Do I get any special talents for being a twink?”
“Yes,” Cas gasped. He felt the coldness of the tiles against the tip of his heated cock. “God, Dean,
“Sweetheart,” Dean cooed, “It will be alright.”
“Yeah,” Castiel breathed out, unable to stop the smile that spread across his face. “It’s nice to meet you, too.”
“God!” Jo huffed. “I’m so tired of alphas labeling me ‘high maintenance’ just because I want them to show me little acts of love.”
“We’ll find a way,” Dean interrupted, snapping his spyglass closed and stuffing it into his pocket. “We always find a way, Sam. This time is no different.”
“I’d rather you not be here at all,” Castiel said, caught up in the moment. He let his emotions get the best of him and he growled at Dean.
“You want me to touch you?” Dean whispered into Cas’s ear. “You want me to take your cock in my hand and make you come?”
“Please!” Castiel just about screamed. “I need it, Alpha! I need it!”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “What?”
Meg seemed to study him for a moment before she continued. “What happened after I jumped? What was it like for you guys?”
Dean started kissing down to Castiel’s neck at the same time his hands traveled down to the button of his jeans and Castiel reacted immediately. He shot his hand down to stop Dean from unbuttoning his pants and went rigid.
“Proceed.”
“That is part of the mating and marriage law. Courting must go on for a minimum of two months, and both parties must be eighteen for those two minimum months,” Meg explained. “Plus, Dean’s idea of courting is much more grand and romantic than group outings to the garden or a weekend in the hillside. Or a tour of the castle.”
“Yes,” Castiel moaned softly. Dean could scent the spike of his arousal and for a second time, all Dean could focus on was the fact that Castiel was getting
“You’re
“Someone has to be pure on that ship,” Cas joked, smiling as he sorted through his papers. He handed an article to Gabe and told his uncle to read it before checking his answers.
“My son got caught up at the library and ended up losing track of time,” He said. “He came home close to noon, about an hour after your representative left.”
“What?” Both Jo and Castiel said at the same time.
“Twenty-three,” Dean said.
“You don’t have to, Benny,” Dean spoke, shaking his head. “I was actually about to go to sleep.”
The dog backs up a little, the hair on its neck raised slightly.
It’s much of an issue. Somehow, Cas keeps bumping into Dean. At Walhallamart. Crossing the streets. At that one odd large bridge. At the movie theater, watching
time in a row, right?
Then, to Dean’s increasing horror (among other things growing at a rapid pace), Cas sits down on it backwards, legs spread and dick on display for the whole class to see.
He finishes a third piece.
Dean bites his bottom lip.  When he looks up, the tip of Cas’ tongue peeks out. His eyes are half lidded now, almost staring through Dean, down to Dean’s very soul that Cas knows so intimately.
. It takes him a few seconds to adjust. To have his body still feel like something in the middle of pure nothing.
“Well,
Maybe he should focus on Cas’ eyes. Yes, that seems fair, and... uninvasive.
Nothing wrong with that nose.
The more minutes tick by, the more Cas’ eyes soften.
Wait,
Cas turns to him. “You grazed her shoulder, so she’s mortally wounded, remember? We’ll just have to wait her out. I’ll hide us in an alternate universe — buy us some time.”
When Cas looks over, Dean remembers to act like a human.
He’s gonna take a page out of pastor Richard’s book of advice and choose a simple pose.
“You made it loud. Oh the things I’m about to do to you-“
Duh. No way he’s gonna put Dean. He’s not going to give these quiz makers even one hint of an advantage in assigning him his gay Hogwarts house.
Oh. So
Yeah. Dean’s gonna just
. At the time, it was a scrap and I took it, it released me from the hold heaven had over me, that’s how desperate I was for you. So when you told me you and Sam simply needed the strength of an angel…. used me…. it made sense. It clicked.”
It’s a tough job but someone’s gotta do it.
Ummm.
Dean looks down at him. Sure, to outsiders, maybe this — er,
Hm. Curiously, he opens another tab and googles this bloke. To his surprise, he’s some sort of poet. These fans are also into poetry and shit? That’s deeper than he expected.
But Claire throws her arms around Dean’s neck - Cas is starting to think it’s her signature disarming move - and sighs deeply into his shoulder.
Dean figures some things they just cant tell you. You have to find it out for yourself.
Cas’ head tilts. Another one of those friggin’
A full fucking frontal facing puzzle. No missing pieces.
Maybe none of this was ever funny.
“Alright, I’ll… I’ll go then.” Cas says eventually.
“Oh Dean.” Chuck laughs loudly. “What makes you think Cas
naked actually, the minute Cas’s eyes are on him.
A tired look crosses Cas’ face, and he just gets in the Impala quietly. Odd.
He follows the pencil’s movements like Mowgli being hypnotised by Kaa.
There’s gotta be some unwritten rule - ‘do not mention online porn stories starring your friends’.
, he is definitely not thinking about the things fictional Cas and Dean have done in this Impala. A lot of. Impaling.
It feels rude to pull back.
moving that tongue around with skill Dean didn’t know he had. By the time they untangle, Dean feels, uh, almost light in the head. Dizzy.
“Scene 57, take one!” Richard yells.
”What?”
“Here’s your phone back. I got the whole thing, just like you asked.”
Jensen rubs his eyes. “How many times do I gotta tell you, Ron. Call me Jensen.”
“Hi!” Misha beams, holding up a stack of paper. “Did you see the rewrite?”
What if, like, The French Mistake was more like a documentary? Dean is real, he feels so real to him, sometimes it doesn’t even feel like acting when he’s on set.
Dean shoots him a look. He’ll get him for that one, later.
He presses his arm against the pastor’s throat.
What’s going on in that massive head of his? Sam’s smart as hell. He’s absolutely going to figure out something’s off about Dean soon.
Dean’s always believed he didn’t need protecting like this. Now he’s not so sure.
“Oh, Sam,” Chuck says. “Sam is boring. Don’t worry about him. Worry about what I can do to you, here.”
Dean takes an excruciatingly long time to find his words - Sam almost wants to speak up, but the moment looks so tense that even a cough would sound like a ricocheting pebble in a cave.
Dean’s not even that hard!
Dean swallows hard. He can’t believe this is how he’s made his friend feel, not his
“Cas, I’m sorry. Look.”
Cas tosses the pencil on the floor, steadies himself on Dean’s hips and then the bastard just
“Well, the fans who read them think you’re definitely gay.”
“How excited are you about this episode, Mr. Ackles?” The interviewer pushes the microphone towards Dean’s face.
“Dean, just… just do it already.”
He coughs. “Right, I found you a toothbrush. Bathroom’s over there.”
Then he holds one hand open near his forehead, his other arm stretched over his head.
That’s just it. Zap. No more Cas.
He focuses on it, forcing his own breathing to match.
“Okay, okay.” Short pause. “And they don’t just target women. Cas too.”
Cas looks at his hands, his palms facing up as if he’s only just had to let go of something.
It’s like those kids toys where you have to put the triangle into the triangle shaped hole. The shape is just
He shields them, and wishes for his own demise.
Oh yeah - Richard mentioned something called ‘Carry On’. This must be the wrong episode he’s reading over.
Dean curves his back, presenting his ass even harder.
Cas’s throat ran dry with indecision. He’d already said it once, and to be honest, the consequences of that were a bit traumatizing. With all of the, uh, being taken to the angel elephant cemetery.
“But it was in the script, right?” the journalist asks. “Bobo Berens…”
No, no. Can’t be. Cas did have sex with that female reaper. This is information those fans don’t know about.
Was it even a homosexual declaration of love? Dean is not so sure anymore. Cas is an angel after all, who knows how he feels things? If he even wants Dean -
The members of Kansas exchanged glances with Keanu Reeves-level of confusion. Then, in a snap, they all had long hair and STD’s again.
“Let’s play
He remembers discovering Becky’s fanpages for the Supernatural books a few years ago, though he tries not to ever think about it. Dude, they’re
Dean finally looks Cas in the eyes.
A tear finally slides down Cas’ cheek.
“Cas, I’m going to die,” he says.
“Dean?”
“No.”
“Boys!” She exclaims, seemingly at the end of her wits.
Cas pulls back first, his hands leaving Dean’s skin. There’s rustling behind him as he pulls his briefs up.
“Dean, be reasonable. You drove all day, then all this. Your brain’s probably pretty fried now. We need you fresh and alert tomorrow.” Sam’s voice is slightly softer.
“Brother, if this is your idea of a date, I’m starting to realize why you have relationship problems.”
, but-”
“Sh,” says Naomi, “you can go back to sleep.”
Dean frowns, perturbed. He’s only met Naomi Milton once, and it didn’t end well. Half because the woman had decided she didn’t like Dean before she ever met him, and half because Cas mouthed off at her over that decision.
"I give them away, more often than not," Dean says honestly, and if he hadn't turned his head just then, he would've missed the minuscule pout on Cas's face. "What's that look for?"
“It totally matters. You can’t bitch about this shit unless he’s yours. And he’s not yours.” She gives a little sigh. “If you’d been like this with me, I probably would’ve slapped you.”
Castiel lets out a high-pitched giggle, ducking away from her and clutching the strings of his tote like a lifeline. “I think Dean might object,” he tries to joke, but his voice cracks again, and this time Charlie laughs.
Castiel searches her face for a moment, then draws back with a sigh, releasing her hands as she releases his. “Of course,” he says, offering a smile. Her own grows in response as she reaches over to tousle his hair, then grabs his hand again to pull him up, drag him out to the field where the rest of their friends are organizing a game of HORSE.
A smile stretches across Castiel’s face. “I’m glad I make you happy.”
But Lucifer, a senior then, had taken up for his younger brother. Introduced him to important friends, led him to study groups, and even encouraged him to try for track and field. As a freshman, Cas could only make second string, but he plans to practice and run every day this summer, and impress everyone come August. And that's all thanks to Lucifer.
Don’t think he’s not grateful for his sentence. Considering how much time Alastair got, Dean could’ve been a lot worse off, especially considering he did all the bloody work. Bi-monthly therapy (because the judge thought Dean was
The baby is something to deal with a few months from now. Right now, Cas has to win over the royal family.
Not until Cas goes quiet for a moment before saying, “Dean, I want to ask you something.”
Castiel holds up a placating hand, nodding slightly. “I know. Better than you do.” He knocks on the car’s roof, jumping when the minivan behind them honks its horn, the driver waving in annoyance. “I’ll call you,” Castiel repeats. “Drive home safe.”
And Castiel feels happy.
Sleep doesn’t come easily these days.
When he looks up, Bela is actually smiling as she taps the buttons on her own phone. Curious, Castiel leans over, and manages to catch the name before she pulls away and frowns at him.
"If you're interested, I could take you to one of their parties."
-----
“You need to leave,” he says, taking a seat on the couch and burying his face in his hands.
Dean manages to smile. “Well, good. Only losers don’t like Ewoks.”
Something about this makes Dean feel like a blushing virgin again, and that realization makes him actually blush. The flowers, the sunlight, the perfectly gorgeous alpha, built like a prince and hung like a centaur… those torrid books Dean had read always featured virgin omegas in white, crossing their legs even as they begged for it, so maybe that’s what Dean is thinking of. Or maybe it’s just that, for all the times Dean has had sex, he’s never felt the rush that comes with just kissing Castiel. He hadn’t even thought to ask for it over the days he was here, but now that he’s gotten one, he finds himself reaching up for Castiel, guiding him in for more kissing.
“Good luck, Spock!” Dean says cheerfully, and Castiel can hear laughter before the line cuts off. He’s smiling to himself, unconsciously, as he tightens his laces, changes into a lighter shirt, and slips out of his room. With Gabe occupied, he’ll have to run out to town, but that’s not a problem; he runs through town every morning for practice, and before Lucifer ratted him out, he would typically run out to see his friends later in the day. His time is already much improved, and it hasn’t even been a month.
. Didn't we discuss this before?"
After a moment, Dean texts back a series of question marks, but Castiel doesn’t want to ease his confusion. It’s hard enough parsing through his own.
about it, as soon as you tell me
Castiel tightens his jaw and stubbornly keeps his eyes on the grass. The wind is up, whistling past his ears and through his hair, and Bela’s shoes fidget back and forth as she waits for him to respond.
Sam considers this for a moment. Castiel turns to check on Mary again, a little surprised that she and Naomi have managed to converse for this long, and when he turns back, Sam is smirking in a way that immediately has Castiel feeling defensive.
Anna and Castiel exchange a confused glance before turning back to their mother. Was that a serious statement, or an actual attempt at humor? Now Castiel knows how people feel when he makes a joke.
, and then Dean is coming as well, head falling back as his body tenses.
Cas says Meg’s name reproachfully, but Dean’s barely paying attention. He’s assaulted with mental images of Cas and Meg, tucked together in a bed, her wild hair spread everywhere while Cas presses kisses against her naked thighs. The clueless, innocent kisses Dean and Cas had exchanged are meaningless now, just like Dean had said they could be. Dean realized last year that those kisses had meant something to him, that his relationship with Cas wasn’t quite what it was supposed to be, but he’s still too afraid to examine why, let alone admit it aloud. Now, he realizes that he’d wanted those kisses to mean something to Cas too. And for a while, he had the distinction of being Cas’s first.
“But we still have an issue,” Michael continues. “If you
Castiel actually laughs at this, pleased not to be alone in this passive-aggressive battle against the king, but then they turn a corner, and Lisa stops climbing. Castiel nearly runs into her, and quickly peers up to see what’s wrong.
.” Charlie rolls her eyes. “Between work and homework, did you really think you could do more than a couple hours a week?”
“This is no worse than all the times you’ve used me!” Cas yells, reaching over to grip Dean’s t-shirt in his hands. “All those drunk dials where I had to steal Gabe’s car in the middle of the night to make sure you got home safe, where I was worried sick about you, was that just you using
“What don’t you like?” Because maybe Dean can fix this. Maybe he can make it all better, and they can go into their junior year stronger and more in love. But Lisa doesn’t look back at him, choosing to continue staring out the window instead.
“That’s the weirdest Panic at the Disco nickname yet.”
Sonny chuckles softly and stands up, off to help his other students. When he’s gone, Dean takes another look at his canvas, trying to put the product in his head on top of the unfinished work in front of him. For a moment, he wishes Cas was around to model for him again.
“I got hit. More of a slap, really, but I was little and Dad wasn’t really in control, so it bruised pretty bad. And that was it for Mom. She packed up and took me and Sam to her parents’ place in Topeka the next morning.” Dean rubs at his face again before finally lifting his head to look at Cas, chuckling slightly. And Castiel can see the shine in his green eyes, the tears he was trying to hide as he spoke, and for one rushing second, Castiel realizes how rare this is, how absolutely atypical it is for Dean to talk about this part of his life, let alone with someone he’s only known a few weeks.
Castiel’s family hasn’t engaged in Christmas Eve traditions since Anna entered boarding school. They certainly never had anything as low-brow as this, but he finds himself charmed by its simplicity, by the excited energy Sam and Dean are putting into something so low-key.
“No thanks, Sammy. I’m stuffed.”
. And Dean’s
“Anything.”
Dean pulls his phone out of his pocket and immediately sends a text saying as much to Lisa. Cas laughs softly, shaking his head, and Dean narrows his eyes.
“You’re the one digging into my personal business,” Dean mutters, but there’s less venom in it. He sketches in silence for another moment, then groans in frustration, dropping the book to his knees. “Can we at least make it an even exchange here?”
“Mom. Don’t.” Dean sighs. “Please.”
Dean knows who’s on the phone as soon as he walks into the kitchen and sees the look on Mary’s face. Tension in a solid line, all the way down her back, eyes tired, and lips so tight they’re almost white.
Castiel purses his lips. “Who is ‘us?’”
Dean winces and fidgets in his seat. “Oh. Uh. I didn’t know. Sorry.”
“Why do you want to watch a movie about lesbians?” Dean frowns, flipping the case over in his hands. “How did you
After a slight hesitation, Dean smiles. It’s small but pleased, and he gently squeezes Castiel’s hand before guiding him towards one of the windows, indicating that he should have a seat on the floor. “I’ll be right back,” Dean says. “Enjoy the view.”
Dean ignores the cheering going on in the back of his mind, and despite what Anna had said the night before, he asks, “You guys seemed happy together.”
“Are these good for you? I’m afraid I don’t know what horses eat.” The voice is muted, but even from this distance Dean can tell that it’s deep and rusty, like a growl. The alpha. Talking to… a horse? His Impala, maybe?
“So if I said that this is okay,” Castiel squeezes Dean’s ribs, turns to bury his face in Dean’s neck, “and we can make out sometimes, but that’s it, you’d really be okay with that?”
“Shut up, I’m gonna make it.”
Now it’s Sam’s smell that sours, and Castiel is having difficulty breathing while John sits, serene as a baby centaur. “What if both of your sons had been omegas, your majesty?”
Just like the painting.
“Yeah,” Dean says again, unsure of why he feels so fucking
The truth is, Dean is confused. He can’t tell himself that he doesn’t like kissing Cas anymore. Not after what happened at the concert. He knows he’s not gay, though, regardless of both the real-life kisses and the dream sex, so he’s not sure what’s happening. He’d rather not think about it, honestly.
“You wouldn’t know it from the way you talk about him,” Bela responds, and he can hear the smile in her voice as well. Castiel rolls his eyes.
excited to meet alpha daddy over here. The
“You know how Uncle Zach is,” Castiel says. “Fire and brimstone for homosexual desires, and he wouldn’t be saying it if it didn’t make him money, and it wouldn’t make him money if people didn’t actually believe it.”
He aches all over, neck and shoulders and down his spine. Dean must have rearranged them after Castiel fell asleep, because now they’re laid out on the bed, though Castiel is still spooned up behind Dean, arms around his waist. It’s warm and the blankets around them are soft, but Castiel feels like a dried out sponge that got hit by a train, so he sits up and rubs futilely at his face.
better,” Dean repeats earnestly. “But I’m never gonna
“I need help,” croaks Dean, and proceeds to relay what just happened. Cas listens carefully, never interrupts, even when Dean starts to go off about his fears, about what could happen to his mother or his brother or the girls he loves like sisters, about how his only option is to keep doing what he’s been doing.
“What?” Dean croaks, when his voice starts working again.
Castiel can’t help thinking at least that’s a plus, and it makes him feel horrible. God only knows what his brother’s doing, if he’s even alive, and here’s Castiel feeling grateful that he doesn’t have to deal with those fights anymore.
Dean doesn’t have that luxury.
“I’m getting better,” Dean says quietly, staring down at his drink. Anna shifts on the bench, but doesn’t respond, so Dean continues: “I haven’t been to any parties or gotten drunk since last year. I helped put the guy that was funding the parties behind bars.” He rubs a hand over his face, finds his fingers and cold and damp and soothing. “I had to do community service, and go to therapy. I like both. Therapy has… it’s helped a lot. I don’t get worked up so much anymore, and I’m learning how to handle it when I do.”
“I don’t need a babysitter,” comes Castiel’s voice, dripping with annoyance. Dean grins anyway, and gently pushes past Jess to seek his alpha out.
out!”
Again, Castiel wants to ask him why, and even leans towards telling him to leave. He doesn’t need Dean’s worry, or his pity. He just wants to escape into his book for a little while longer. But it’s as he’s reaching up to close the window that he realizes, that’s exactly what Dean had offered. He just didn’t want Castiel to do it alone.
Dean’s face crumples, and he makes a strange little groaning noise. “Probably,” he says, running a hand through his hair. “Alastair doesn’t like to start without me.”
"I have high hopes for you, Castiel," Michael continues. "You do so well in school, you always listen when Mother or I need your help. I was willing to let you continue your extracurricular activities, but if it's just going to make you behave like this, then maybe I'll have to talk to Mother about letting you back on the track team in the fall."
“I don’t need to talk about it.”
Lucifer, still looking like someone just informed him the sky is actually red, finally stands up and half-heartedly ruffles Castiel’s hair as he passes him on his way to the stairs. “Don’t stay up too late,” he warns as he heads back up to bed. Castiel just smiles, pleased with himself, and pulls his phone back out.
.” Dean rolls his eyes. “There's no way he could've done anything to justify that. He’s the sweetest alpha I’ve ever met.”
“What the hell are you doing?” he whispers, frowning.
Not that Naomi isn’t trying her hardest to open him up too. She catches him alone whenever she can and asks about Dean and Charlie and Jo. While Castiel is impressed that she remembers the girls’ names, he doesn’t want to tell her the whole awful story of his and Dean’s courtship. It doesn’t paint him or Dean in a good light, and even though things are shitty right now, Castiel still wants his family to like Dean when they inevitably come back together.
Dean takes a deep breath. “You’d do this but you don’t wanna date him?”
Castiel nods slowly. “Winchester, you said? That’s only a couple hours from here.”
Dean stares at the plate, assaulted by the smell until his stomach rolls, and he gently pushes it away. “Not hungry,” he says softly.
Dean smiles, because that’s what Dean does. Don’t think Castiel doesn’t notice how Dean isn’t touching him anymore, however. “Listen,” Dean says, soft like he’s soothing a wild animal, “I’m sorry I tried to push you. I’ll wait as long as you need. Until you finish school, if I have to, and I won’t go around with anyone else in the meantime. I swear.” He holds up a hand when Castiel opens his mouth to protest, and continues, “There’s not much else for me, y’know? I’m gonna work at Bobby’s and now that I’m eighteen Ellen’s gonna let me help out at the bar so I can take care of Mom and Sammy. Most of my friends are going to college in a couple weeks, and Sam and Jo will be gone before I know it too. Who knows if they’ll ever come back? But you…” Dean’s smile stretches into something a little more genuine as he leans closer into Castiel’s space, still without touching him. “You keep coming back. No matter what. I keep expecting you to get bored or find someone better or whatever, and it’s like a miracle every time you come back and smile at me again.”
She stomps a hoof in the grass, glaring at him with one baleful brown eye.
Castiel stares up at the ceiling, the only empty space in Dean’s room, except for the ceiling fan. Dean raises a good point; he’s been pushing him to share information since they met, and Dean usually, eventually, crumbles. But while Castiel feels he has proven himself a good listener to someone who desperately needs an ear, he hasn’t done much sharing of his own. Though, again, this is the only time Dean has asked. “What do you want to know?”
“When,” Dean says. Lisa frowns and looks out at the ocean.
“I’ll talk to Dean and see what he wants to do,” Castiel decides. “I’ll come if he invites me, and if your dad and his wife are okay with it.”
And now it all makes sense. Now, Castiel feels like he can trust Dean again, like he knows who Dean really is deep down. He’s seen past the veil that even Jo, Charlie, and Sam can’t get around, and he smiles until Dean hesitantly smiles back.
“Not to me.”
"Alright."
“And?” Dean prompts, nudging Cas with his shoulder. “What did he say?”
! Wouldn’t let me near him while he bathed, wanted to dress himself, then got all tangled up in the laces…” She rolls her eyes when Dean laughs again. “You guys are so easy, but he just won’t let me help him with anything until it’s too late.”
“Something good,” Castiel insists, and Dean chuckles.
Dean gently squeezes Castiel’s hand as he eases into the garage, and they both hesitate when he turns the car off, a quiet clicking sound emitting from the engine as it cools down. Finally, Dean sighs heavily.
Cas is quiet, his fingers gently clenched in Dean's t-shirt. "Yeah, well, that's what I'm here for, I guess. Lighten things up a little."
, fall asleep.
Lisa puts her hand on Dean’s back, trailing her fingers up and down his spine. She smiles when Dean turns to look at her, but the smile drops like a stone when Dean pulls away from her touch. She tucks her hands in her lap, frowning at Dean with hurt painting her features, but how can he possibly explain that that gesture just reminds him of Cas?
The response is immediate.
Dean lowers the jug and winks at Castiel. “Whatever you say, alpha.”
From the way Castiel’s hand is clutching at his arm, maybe he wants to keep Dean too.
“Was that Dean’s brother? The little one?” Chuck asks. Castiel pulls his seatbelt on and fidgets; he’s suddenly cold, like those several minutes subjecting himself to the wind’s abuse have hit him all at once.
“We’ll leave your door open.” Castiel takes Dean’s hand and gently tugs on it. “I won’t make any moves if you don’t.”
friendship to revolve around
Castiel huffs in annoyance, dropping his chin down to rest against the pink marble that makes up the breakfast bar. The arm that’s not busy holding his Blackberry is spread out in front of him, and he wonders why he bothered calling Meg after all.
“I like her,” Pam offers. “She’s really sweet, very patient, which is good for a Winchester.” Dean growls at her from behind Cas’s hand, and she sticks her tongue out at him.
Mary raises an eyebrow. “Why not?”
It's flawed logic and a poor play on his emotions, Castiel knows, but he can't help panicking at the thought of not being allowed to run with his team next year. "No! No, that won't be necessary."
She gives John another piercing look, and Castiel decides two things in that moment: One, this is not his business and he shouldn’t pry; and two, he really hopes Dean didn’t inherit that deadly stare or else Castiel is in big trouble.
“Yeah, but at least you’ve been here long enough that you’re on your way to it!”
“Yeah. You and Lisa, and me and somebody else.”
Dean side-eyes him for a moment, then laughs, straddling his bike. “Your humor’s going to take some getting used to. Hop on.” Castiel hesitates, and Dean sighs. “You sit, I’ll stand, let’s fucking go.”
awkward, the way Dean drops one hand to Castiel’s shoulder but quickly removes it, doesn’t try to pull Castiel closer or hold him or nuzzle him, and Castiel finds himself mourning the loss when Dean pulls away and shrugs, forcing a laugh.
Tattled. Called the cops. Sure, Cas did something, all right. Dean snorts. Mary frowns.
“I wanted to apologize for last night,” Bela says, glancing at Castiel, then clearing her throat when he gapes at her. “Don’t look at me like that, I mean it. I thought you knew what Dean was like, so I didn’t think a fight night would bother you.”
Sonny takes a seat next to Dean on the stool. “How about you just draw today?” he suggests. “Don’t worry about colors or planning anything out in advance. Just put a pencil to the canvas and see what comes out.”
to actually
“Um,” Castiel croaks, “okay.”
“Like
Jo chimes in, “It is really confusing.”
“Being a little chickenshit!” Meg supplies helpfully, laughing in the distance as Cas grunts, probably shoving her away.
Because he can tell Jo he’s not obsessed, over and over again, but the truth is, Dean thinks about Cas a lot. Wonders if there’s nice weather where Cas is, if he’s able to run in the mornings like he likes, if he’s watching any cool movies or making friends. He thinks about the curl in Cas’s hair, which makes it look so messy and frizzy in the Oregon humidity -not that Cas ever noticed or cared. He thinks about blue eyes and an array of silent smiles that speak hundreds of words. He tries not to think about what Cas would look like under his clothes, but thanks to those unstoppable dreams, he usually fails and ends up daydreaming anyway.
Then, everything stops again. Because at the sound of the door, of footsteps on gravel, Cas looks up and accidentally meets Dean’s eyes. The smile drops from his face, and Dean’s heart stutters as his own smile fades. He can feel it, the phantom pressure that comes just before a headache, the shuddering breaths that come just before his chest opens into a black hole, because it’s about to happen. Cas is about to tear into him, or worse, turn away and pretend he didn’t see him, and now that the moment is here, Dean’s not so sure he can handle it.
The rest of it may be complicated, but that much is simple. And as long as they have this, that love that ties them together, maybe they can pull through the rest.
Dean takes a short breath, squinting at the signs beneath the streetlights. “It’ll be… fun,” Dean tries, but it sounds weak even to his own ears. Lisa glances up at him, but quickly turns back to the sidewalk. Maybe she’ll accept it as Dean being distracted, trying to find the right house.
"Yeah." Dean fidgets a little more, picking at a hole in the knee of his jeans. "It's not a big deal, y'know, it's twenty bucks a class down at Michael's, and it's not a serious thing-"
, so I don’t understand how you can spend
It’s Jo. It’s messy and a little cartoony and done all in pen, but it’s clearly Jo, laughing at something unseen. Surprised, Castiel flips through the pages.
, it’s always been
Bela gently tugs at Castiel’s hand, leading him into a clearing bathed in bluish light. There’s a pair of girls leaning up against a tree, passing a bottle in a brown paper bag back and forth. Closer to the lantern are a trio of boys, one of whom looks old enough to be a senior, or perhaps even older. When he smiles at Bela, the other two turn around, and Castiel can’t help smiling when he realizes one of those two is Dean.
listen to some of his stories about Dean.
They arrive at the park right on time, but Jo and Charlie are already sitting underneath a tree with a pile of comic books between them. Sam is out on the field, a soccer ball under his arm, though he seems far more interested in talking to the tow-headed girl in front of him. Still, Sam is the one who notices them first, waving cheerfully and handing his soccer ball to his friend before running over to grab Castiel in a hug.
“And Purgatory,” Dean finishes, gesturing at the back wall, a satisfied expression on his face. “It’s not finished yet - may not be for a while - but do you like it?”
“That’s implied now.”
“I’m Naomi, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you ladies,” she says, a friendly note in her voice, and Castiel is reminded of attending large parties in fancy clothes, watching his mother laugh with strangers only for that joyful mask to fade as soon as they were safely in the limo, on their way home. Pam shakes the offered hand, as does Charlie and Jo, offering their own names as they do so, and Anna and Castiel exchange a look while their mother chatters on about nothing.
“And it’s not like Dean would go to school anyway,”  Charlie continues with a roll of her eyes. “Especially not as far away as Chicago.”
“What’s the harm?” Dean still sounds defensive, irritated, as he steals Pam’s stool and holds out his hand for her to take. Castiel attempts to ignore Charlie, who has yet to unwrap herself from around his body, and studies Dean, his flared nostrils and twitching jaw and tight shoulders. Could he be jealous? It’s true that Dean is good-looking, from an objective point of view. He’s definitely the most attractive boy in town, at least that Castiel has seen. ‘Pretty,’ might be the right word, with his long lashes and full lips, just like his mother. Castiel had been joking when he talked about stealing Dean’s girls, but maybe it wasn’t so funny if it was actually true. Of course Dean would be jealous: he’s the king tomcat for an entire year, and Castiel waltzes in and steals his girls away? Castiel would be annoyed too, were he in Dean’s shoes.
Missouri sighs, setting her clipboard aside and leaning back in her chair. "We've discussed this before, Dean. Cas doesn't owe you anything. If he doesn't want to hear from you, you should respect that."
Dean never told John about Lisa. He doesn’t know why, but he doesn’t want John to know about that whole mess.
calling Dean.
“What else does she want from you?” Dean asks quietly, moving his hand to Castiel’s hair. The attention is nice, comfortable even. Meg used to do something similar, playing with Castiel’s hair until it was a useless mess, and then laughing at him when he frowned and tried to fix it. Dean, however, alternates between massaging and gently scratching Castiel’s scalp, and it’s relaxing enough that Castiel finds himself closing his eyes, twisting to fit closer to Dean.
“Dean.” And that one-syllable word says so much, tone and inflection speaking volumes, but it’s all in a language that Dean doesn’t understand. “Do you need me to come get you?”
“Something hits you, hard, and literally knocks the breath out of your lungs?”
“Dean,” he says, “is this one based on a song?”
ready.
“If you ever came out from under that rock, you’d know this is the Killers. No one else sounds like that.”
"That's not true," and Cas sounds like this is the most hurtful thing Dean has ever said, like hearing Dean's clarity on his own worthlessness is worse than if Dean had just punched him. “Dean, please don’t talk like that.”
“I know.” And Castiel feels a little lighter when he says, “I’m sorry I shut you out.”
Dean smirks at her. “Except you.” He playfully wags a finger at her, then waves Castiel over. “Your ingenuity pays off again. Jess, this is Cas. Cas,” and here he reaches up to pull Castiel’s hood off, the girl’s smile widening as she takes in Castiel’s face, “this is Jess. She’ll probably be in charge of you.”
, but he takes care of his needs and doesn’t need much more than a few visits from his mother or Sam, for a little familial cuddling. Granted, the only alphas who are normally in the castle around this time are related to Dean, or are already mated, so maybe this is just a reaction to the very un-related and un-mated alpha who took him in. Heat is about wanting to mate and have pups. It’s probably going to be easier to stand if there are no available alphas around, right?
“My mother knows about us,” Castiel says flatly. “She overheard me talking to Anna about our date, and she called Michael to deal with the issue.”
Castiel leans down to scent Dean’s neck, to nuzzle and nip at the offered skin. “No,” he whispers back. “I’m not going to knot you.”
“No.” Mary nods as if convincing herself, and reaches out to grip Castiel’s hand in her’s. “Better late than never. He deserves a chance at his own life, and I’m gonna make sure he gets it, come hell or high water. He can have more time for his art, and he can have more time for you, and you can work on convincing him to move to Illinois and make a life out there.”
“And you’ll try and convince your dad to let me visit you in Kansas?”
Dean seems genuinely confused by Castiel’s surprise. “You gotta protect the people, or else what good are you? Being king is more than laying around on pillows and throwing fancy parties in nice clothes, y’know.”
“Then what is it?” Dean shifts and gently nudges Cas’s arm, smiling wide and cheerful. “C’mon, man, after all we’ve been through, you can trust me.”
“Hey, hey, it’s Sheriff Mills when I’m on duty. C’mon, I let you guys hang out after curfew, the least you could do is try not to leave the tourists wondering if we host teenage orgies after dark.” Jody gestures at the rest of the kids, still untangling themselves. Castiel helps Dean up, then they both help Pam, while Charlie remains stubbornly seated in the sand. “At least you’re all clothed. You weren’t drinking were you?” She eyes Dean suspiciously, and he huffs in irritation before kneeling to help Pam start folding up the blankets. Jo goes to help them, Charlie watching unhelpfully, so Castiel steps in, clearing his throat.
Cas stares up at him for a moment, then sits up and stretches past Dean towards the nightstand, where he finds a notepad and a pen. “I’ll write some ideas down for you. Okay?”
“He’s staying in one of the bungalows down at the resort,” Dean offers once they’ve reached the concrete, as Castiel is staring down Jody’s brown and white vehicle. He pointedly refuses to look at either of his companions, especially as they start whispering to each other. They don’t understand. Appearance is everything, and it’s one thing for Castiel to show up back at the resort sweaty and covered in sand. It’s another thing entirely for him to be escorted home by the townie sheriff. Gossip spreads fast, and it won’t matter what the truth is: exiting a police car is exiting a police car, and wagging tongues won’t care if he exits from the front seat or the back as long as they have a story to tell.
“Shit,” Dean chuckles, rubbing his free hand over his mouth. “Well, I think you know the answer to that question.”
If Dean were a more poetic person, he probably would have wooed a classy girl like Lisa Braeden a long time ago. Because he knows she’s beautiful, he finds new ways to appreciate it every day, but he’s never really been able to tell her how beautiful he thinks she is. Jo and Charlie had insisted on a Disney movie marathon after finals, and when Aladdin struggled to describe Jasmine’s beauty to the Genie, Dean had really felt for the guy. It’s tough, trying to explain how beautiful someone is when you’re struck dumb just thinking about them.
“Great!” This exclamation is followed by muffled noises, probably Charlie conferring with Jo, before her voice comes back on the line, “Is two good for you?”
Dean clears his throat and sets his coffee on the ground, rubbing his palms on his jeans. Next to him, Anna sighs.
“You’re all my favorite,” Castiel offers. “Castiel’s Angels, right?”
It’s Castiel who reaches out to mess up Sam’s shaggy hair, laughing when he ducks and protests. Being the youngest brother in his family gives him a little sympathy for Sam, but at the end of the day, one of them is still younger and smaller than the other, and it’s hard to resist a little playful teasing.
He is genuinely concerned about Lisa swooning over Cas, though. Every other girl he knows has done it. Even Charlie, and it turns out she’s pretty gay. And Dean occasionally catches himself studying the bridge of Cas’s nose, the dip of his chin, the length of his neck, though he likes to tell himself that it’s all in the name of art. And that it’s not weird that he likes drawing Cas so much. Or that he ends up heavily basing his favorite characters on Cas.
“It’s windy on the Oregon coast, I’m shocked,” he drawls, self-consciously running a hand through his hair anyway. “Between that and the length, I didn’t have a lot of options.”
Dean shoves his hands in his pockets, whistling tunelessly to try and hide his sudden anxiety. Missouri walks beside him, staring straight ahead, but he's sure she knows he's nervous anyway.
“Now, Dean,” Alastair says, low and patronizing, “Be nice. Don’t you think you deserve a little relaxation? All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, or so they say.”
“She fully supports our celebration, yes, as long as we stay away from the bar.”
to kiss his best friend, and likes doing so.
“He’s a writer.”
“She’s right,” Cas sighs, “you do.”
Dean approaches the table just in time to see Charlie pull the phone away from Cas’s ear and say, “Quit flirting!” as Cas laughs. Dean takes a deep breath, taking it all in: the warm lighting casting a glow on Cas’s skin, his delicate hands as he tickles Charlie breathless in an attempt to get his phone back. Cas has filled out a little, mostly in his shoulders, but his jawline is still soft, and it’s a strange juxtaposition of boy and man, but Dean supposes they’ll all go through that in the next year or so.
