“—ankle—”
Castiel snorted and straightened, leaning back in his chair. “Yeah, because you know so much about world religions.”
thank you so much for all your support and lovely comments :3 you're all wonderful! thank you for reading!! <3
Dean gave a single nod, his attention on the monitor as he typed something in. “I’ll get you some water.” A moment later, he closed the window on the computer but pulled out his phone, his thumbs quickly jabbing at the screen. Then, he went over to the sink and filled two paper cups with water, coming around to Castiel’s right side.
Gabe chuckled at him. “Yeah. You can’t be one of the best bakers in LA without a decent social media platform. And everyone loooooves you.”
“So. Dean.” Castiel scooped up another spoonful of his unbelievably-good Turtle Sundae. “Why have you never taken me here before?”
“It’s been sittin’ there lookin’ all pretty for far too long.” Dean leaned back in his chair, looking playfully arrogant. “It needed to be sliced up.”
what can i say? in my (and everyone else's) headcanon, dean and cas make like bunnies.
Michael turned his gaze on Gabe like he was something unpleasant on the sidewalk. “Just visiting my baby brother,” he returned smoothly, a mocking edge obvious under his words. “I see you had the same idea.”
“So, Raj,” Castiel gestured to the seat across from him. “How are you finding those criticisms I lent you? Too dense, or not detailed enough?”
Friday, October 2nd, was also the day that Dean showed up on Castiel’s porch at 6:03 in the evening, holding a bleeding Bastet and dripping all over Castiel’s welcome mat. “Thank God you’re home,” Dean said, his voice trembling as thunder rolled through the sky.
The nurse let out a low whistle. “That’s gotta suck.”
Silence fell, and they stood there for a moment, just looking at each other. Castiel took a stuttered breath, wondering what was about to happen, when Dean’s gaze suddenly flickered to the garage door and he let out a little yelp of excitement. Dean was at the garage door’s controls in a flash, standing on his tiptoes to look out of the door’s narrow window, anxiously pressing the largest button. “I don’t believe it!”
“And how’d the new Theology Professor wind up in a car accident?” The nurse lowered the chart to make eye contact with Castiel, whose heart leapt into his throat because holy
Castiel nodded as he slipped on the pair of flip flops Dean had told him to bring. “He works here, actually. You might know him.”
“Dude.” Dean fixed him with a pointed look, which was rather negated by the hand he had curled into Bastet’s belly fur. “You turned me into a freakin’ marshmallow.”
Castiel set off down the hall, Dean following close behind. “Hey, this actually looks kind of familiar. The book, I mean,” Dean added at Castiel’s raised eyebrow. “Not the school. The school still looks very new.”
“Dean!”
you all should bow down before hubrisandwax because she's just a goddess ok
Dean frowned. “Naw. I don’t want to mess up your bed and get you sick. Just lemme sleep on the couch.”
“Good.” Dr. Bradbury nodded in approval. “It’d be worth asking that friend if you can rely on them when you need help.” She shrugged. “Takes a village.”
“Did you
, he thought,
Dean was still looking at him, his expression as unreadable as it had been before. Then, he took a slow step towards Castiel, then another, and another, until he was standing right in front of Castiel, unbelievably flattering in the reflected light and standing like he was on the verge of doing something or saying something. Dean’s jaw twitched briefly, then he said, “Here, let me help with that.”
“Nope, ‘cause most of the pipes burst and they barely had enough canned Campbell’s to feed everyone.” Gabe turned around and reached onto the porch, tugging in a large snow-covered suitcase with considerable difficulty. He swung it onto the floor, panting and grinning for all he was worth. “Surprise!”
“Happy Halloween, kids!” he laughed, tossing handfuls of candy into each bag. “What a cute little group of monsters you are!” He’d given up his ‘stern/Christian Bale Batman’ impersonation half an hour before, since it was a little hard to maintain around blasts of frigid air and when the kids looked so ridiculous wrapped up in layers of their parents’ Patagonia. “Now, don’t eat those all at once! And stay warm!”
“All right. Let’s sit over there.” Castiel nodded to an empty row of seats on the right-hand side of the plane by one of the exit doors. Castiel couldn’t complain; this way, they’d have more legroom, and no one could recline into their space. They quickly hoisted their luggage into the overhead compartments and settled down, Dean taking the aisle seat and leaving Castiel in the middle.
Hael scoffed. “Yeah, because broken limbs are
Dean coughed, caught. “No.”
When everyone was settled, Castiel faced his class with a somewhat-nervous grin. “Suprabhaat, class.”
“What are you worrying about?” Castiel asked him, giving Dean’s hand a quick squeeze. “Do you really think that they’d be upset about this?”
“Duly noted.” Dr. Barnes clicked her pen shut. “Well, Castiel, that’s all for now. I don’t want you to stress yourself out, but just know that you will be speaking with several more doctors before you’re discharged.”
“Dean,” Castiel repeated, liking the sound.
“Shh, Cas. They won’t be up for long time.” And then he licked at a bead of precum on the tip of Castiel’s cock. Castiel whimpered.
“Whatever you say, Professor,” Dean replied. He turned back to his car, pulling open the back door and sliding Castiel’s satchel onto the seat. Then he reached forward and opened the passenger door, turning back to face Castiel. “You ready?”
Dean raised himself and kissed Castiel on the mouth; Castiel caught a vague salty tang and realized he was tasting himself and then he got even dizzier. “Honestly, Cas?” Dean said, his voice low, rough, and his pupils blown wide open. “Take me like one of your French girls.”
, he thought.
“Yes,” Castiel insisted, though it sounded more like a plea. He opened the door and stepped onto the road, nearly whimpering at the way the world turned on its side and kicked his heart into a full throttle. He managed to swing his briefcase forward and out, using the momentum to get himself out of the car and standing mostly-straight on the pavement. He paid for it a moment later, though, when the spinning worsened and black spots sprinkled across his vision and he felt like he was about to throw up, sob, and melt all at the same time because this was torture, sheer torture—
Castiel swallowed. “Yes. I changed them this morning.”
His eyes caught her nametag as she helped him stand up. “Thank you, Dr. Bradbury.”
“Covered in Bibles, yeah, I saw,” Dean supplied for him, smiling again. “Livin’ room?”
“Okay,” Castiel found himself saying, gripping Dean’s arm. “And… thank you for telling me that.”
“Thanks, bud.” Gabe sat down in his customary chair and propped his feet up on Castiel’s bed. “Really feeling the love.”
Dean twitched, almost like he was trying to rid his hair of water, and relaxed into a grin. “Sure thing, Cas.” He offered Castiel his arms, which Castiel grabbed like a handrail to avoid touching Dean’s hands, and slowly pulled Castiel to his feet. Castiel exhaled at the tug on his ribs and gladly accepted the crutches from Dean.
Dean frowned at the contents of the shopping cart. “Man. You’re really into the rabbit food.”
Castiel felt his heart skip a beat and quickly licked his lips. “I believe you.”
They jumped apart, eyes wide, speechless for a small eternity before Dean demanded, “The hell was that?!”
Michael nodded once. “Dean, it was a pleasure,” he said, his voice dripping with disapproval and sarcasm, before he turned and went up the stairs, his pace measured and somehow intimidating.
“No,” Dean replied instantly. “I’m about to get into a dinky metal tube and fly through the sky.” The jiggling sped up as Dean shook his head. “I can’t believe you talked me into this.”
“Nag, nag, nag…” Castiel bent down to pick up his briefcase and pulled the strap of Bastet’s carrier over his shoulder (it was one of the fancy carriers with screened sides, a zip-up top, and a carrying strap); Bastet gave him a cheerful but sleepy meow as she swung against his hip. “Right,” he said, his keys in his free hand. “Let’s go.”
“Coffee. It doesn’t bother you?”
Castiel snapped awake, his body livid with tension and his teeth chattering. He lurched off the floor, a paper falling away from where it had stuck to his face. The room was dark and cut by jagged beams of light: both lanterns were lying on their sides. Dean was clinging to Castiel’s shoulders from behind. “What—what—?”
Castiel peered at the ducks, wondering if soggy bread really was that delicious.
Castiel nudged another log onto the fire and shifted the pan on the camp stove to make sure it was completely over the flame. The bacon and eggs popped merrily against the crackling of the fire and the low murmur of his small battery-operated radio, and Castiel surveyed his work with pride.
“I haven’t had one in years, not since—” He chuckled humorlessly. “Not since the last time I saw Michael, actually.” Castiel shuddered bodily and shrank back into his seat again.
, and before he could even second-guess himself, he was closing the distance between them and pressing his mouth to Dean’s.
“I told you she likes you.” Castiel was momentarily glad that he’d handed Dean two Claritins not two hours before.
Gabriel made sure to close the kitchen door before he shook his head and pulled out a can of cat food. “Shit. It’s bad.”
“Actually,” Dean croaked, his eyes open and shining in the darkness. “Stay?”
Castiel smiled and began filling in the forms. “No, just a car accident. That’s why I bought the Rambler.”
Castiel slid under Dean and rolled him over; the bed squeaked a little in protest and Castiel buried Dean’s startled squawk in a sloppy kiss. “You’re sure about this?” he whispered against Dean’s mouth as he pressed against Dean from above, his thumb running along Dean’s unshaven jaw. Dean nodded, distracted by the way Castiel’s other hand was sliding Dean’s boxers down. “Abso-fuckin’-lutely,” Dean finally wheezed, his eyes shut and his expression unhitched.
Castiel nodded. “What’s in the basket?”
Castiel’s fireplace was easily the biggest thing in his living room, next to his television. The old-fashioned red-brick fireplace was along the far wall, which connected to the fireplace he had in his bedroom upstairs, and he kept the TV caddy-cornered next to it. His couch and armchairs were correspondingly diagonal, with his stereo in the corner across from the TV, with each gadget framing his front windows, which currently displayed the three-and-a-half-foot snow drifts piling up past his porch. But, now that they were using the fireplace, he’d readjusted the couch, coffee table, and arm chairs so that they were facing the fire. The small camping stove was placed on the fireplace’s brick ledge, which was knee-height and ran the length of the wall. Since his dining room was just an extension of his living room, he hadn’t had a way to trap the heat, but he had closed the doors to the kitchen and downstairs bathroom.
“Ready for the next one?” Dean pulled yet another DVD out of his bag, grinning.
“Yeah, uh, upstairs.” Castiel swallowed and quickly stood up. “Be right back.”
Dean’s eyebrows flickered upwards. “All right, Castiel it is. This is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna give you your next dose of meds so you can breathe OK and get some sleep. You’ve had a long day and tomorrow’s going to be rough as well, so sleep’s gonna be your best friend. If you even try to protest, I’m draggin’ your orthopod in here so she can scream at you herself.”
Gabe blinked down at the counter before taking a breath. “Not mine to tell.” He straightened up, the bruise under his eye obvious in the kitchen’s light. “Let’s just say Michael’s an abusive son of a bitch and leave it at that.”
Dean snorted through a chuckle. “What, to sit in a wheelchair and stare at your neighbors ‘til you figure out one of them’s a murderer?”
“Ditto. Have you ever actually heard of Orson Welles?”
“Gabe, you were always so theatrical.” A pretty redhead strode into the room, looking half-annoyed and half-amused. “Why there’s a need for all this play-acting, I don’t know.”
“Good morning.” Castiel held out the pills, which Dean accepted with some confusion, and the glass, which Dean stared at woefully. “Take these. I don’t think your fever’s broken yet. It’s a long story, but a snowstorm hit during the night, and we’re extremely snowed in. I have to go and make sure that all the other pipes are still working and build a fire. You stay in bed,” he said, shoving the glass closer to Dean when Dean tried to sit up. “You need to rest, and I don’t want you getting up until the house is warmer.”
“Dean, no—”
“Certainly, Gabriel. There’s no need to be so unpleasant.” Michael’s smirk reappeared, and he turned to Castiel, who was still frozen on the spot, holding the front door open. “Come along, Castiel. Is there a more… private place we can speak?”
“Don’t worry about it.” Castiel reached over and carefully ran his hand along Dean’s arm. “I like you so, so much too,” he murmured, probably not loud enough for Dean to hear. The odds of Dean remembering any of this in the morning were slim to none, thanks to the sure-fire hangover he was going to have from the cold medicine, and from whatever strain of the plague he had managed to contract. What did Castiel really have to lose?
“Original interior,” Dean was saying, peering in the car’s window. “All the leather on the seats and the dash and steerin’ wheel is exactly the way it was in sixty-five.” He flicked his gaze to Castiel, his eyes wide and happy as he straightened up and came over to Castiel. “Just give me’n Bobby some time with it, and it’ll be purrin’ like Bastet when she’s gettin’ a belly rub.”
Dean’s face broke into a sudden smile, and he pushed the correct key into his lock. “The snowball kind.”
He and Hael, as he’d expected, quickly became firm friends. They’d even met up for brunch once or twice, Hael taking the opportunity to show Castiel around Cleveland, which he still hadn’t really explored. His favorite place so far was Bella’s Chocolates: “The best damn chocolatier east of the Mississippi,” Hael claimed. Castiel had to admit that their chocolate turtles were especially delicious. He took to keeping a small take-away box of them in his office.
endless gratitude to my lovely beta, hubrisandwax! you should all send her llama slippers and hugs.
It was too much to handle; Castiel pushed forward, pulling Dean in for another kiss, snaking one arm around Dean’s back and sliding the other up Dean’s arm and gripping him by the shoulder. Dean responded eagerly, but a few moments later Dean started smiling again, making it hard for Castiel to kiss him.
She chuckled good-naturedly. “First day jitters. Happens to the best of us.” Castiel had liked Hael from the very beginning: her pleasant, open face encouraged friendship and her bright blue eyes were sharp and observant. In other words, she was one hell of an assistant. She started to lead him down the hall, her stride quick and efficient. “You weren’t too far off the mark. Your office is just one floor up, is all.” Hael reached for the door to the stairwell and started up the flight of stairs.
She’d rolled up to his house in a modern truck towing a small trailer behind her. Castiel had found himself reminded of the trailers that carried horses down highways before Jodie popped open the back and his new 1960 Nash Rambler gleamed up at him, cheerful despite the shadow. “You made a good choice,” she said as she and Dean towed the Rambler onto the road. “She’s been sitting in my garage for Lord knows how long.”
p.s. i'm no master at hindi (thank god for translation websites!) but basically what was going on: cas said "good morning" and his students said "good morning, teacher" and that's just because they're learning about buddhism and cas is a geek ok? ok.
Castiel frowned and mimicked Dean, swiping a thumb along the edge of his bottom lip. A ridiculous amount of whipped cream came away, and he smiled as he licked it off. “Thanks.”
They were silent for a moment before Hael nudged his elbow. “C’mon, Prof. Tell me what’s going on in that ridiculously large mind of yours.”
to talk about it, but thinks that doing so will make life harder for the people who care about him, so, he never talks about it.”
Castiel smiled at the euphemism. “When I was younger, I did have faith, or, at least, I thought I did. But my parents were the extreme sort. During my adolescence I came to the realization that my beliefs and my parents’ beliefs did not align, and that led to a sort of break in the family. It sounds terribly cliche, but that was when everything changed between me and my parents, and me and my siblings. For a while, I regarded religion with the greatest abhorrence, and I hated anything to do with the Bible.”
“No,” Dean murmured in reply, one of his eyes cracking open. With his mussed hair and half-asleep expression, he was more adorable than usual. Castiel could’ve sworn that his heart dropped into his stomach. “‘m good. But thank you. Thank you so much.”
Castiel actually groaned that time. “I don’t understand that reference, but I really don’t care.”
“Yes,” came Castiel’s reply, sounding closer than Dean had expected him to. A moment later, there was the familiar sound of crutches on wooden floorboards and Castiel appeared, looking very pleased with himself. “How is she?”
Dean grinned. “Damn straight.” He glanced at his watch and half-frowned. “Listen, Cas, I gotta finish up my rounds, but are you good here?”
Dean raised a jaunty middle finger into the air, flipping off whoever it was before leaning in to kiss Castiel again, neither of them able to stop smiling, and Castiel realized that they would be just fine, they would be okay, probably even better than okay. They would be fantastic.
“I don’t like Everett.”
Dean let out a little whistle. “Damn. You win.”
Castiel started to grin. “I did. One hundred and forty-six.”
Dean grabbed Castiel’s hands, pressed them into his hair, and sank right down onto the shaft the way he had the night before. Castiel thought he might implode, heat blossoming under the skin of his chest, his shoulders, his face. He groaned even louder than he had before; Dean popped off with a very loud, wet sounding
“Bobby’s a mechanic,” Dean replied as he anxiously scanned the crowd of people, only about a quarter of his attention on Castiel. “He’s always fixin’ up some rust heap or other. Sammy’ll probably have the only car that’s workin’. Hey!” This last word was a shout as Dean bounded in the direction of a nearby pillar, Castiel struggling to keep up. “Speakin’ of Bigfoot—!”
Castiel nodded once. “Are there any more papers I have to sign?”
>Anna: Have a great first day, Castiel! I know you’ll do wonderfully :~)
Dean shook his head and pulled up one of the miscellaneous chairs that was floating around the classroom. “All right. You owe me a lesson in the History of Cas.” He sat down on the other side of the table. “Go.”
sounded from the pocket of his pajama pants and he pulled out his phone with a grin. “Hey! That photo of you got more than two thousand likes. You’re getting popular, bro.”
Dean grabbed the box, hoisting it into his own arms. With a hurried sort of smile, he turned and started heading down the path again. Castiel followed tentatively, wondering what just happened and why it had felt so… raw. His quickly shook his head, trying to rid himself of the feeling, and followed Dean across the snow-covered road and up onto Dean’s yellow porch.
The nurse gave him a sympathetic look. “Don’t worry. I get it.” She stopped at the doorway to the waiting room and gave his arm a squeeze. “Tell him Lisa said hey, and that he should definitely take you to Sweet Moses to celebrate.”
Gabe reluctantly let go of Castiel but kept a firm grip on him. “How’re you feeling, buddy?”
“Thank you so much, Dean,” Castiel said for the sixth time that day. “I very much appreciate your helping me. It was a very kind and generous thing for you to do.”
being into each other. I mean—” He pulled up the photo and showed it to Anna with a grin. “Do ‘just friends’ cuddle with each other like that?”
Castiel smiled and stood up, pulling on his thick overcoat in preparation for going down to the basement. “Just like I promised.”
Castiel brushed a kiss to Dean’s cheek and felt Dean’s frame soften. “So calm down. We’ll walk down there like nothing is different, because nothing
Castiel frowned as they stepped off the escalator. “Does he have different cars?”
< Dean Winchester: didn’t work. he didn’t eat. and i think he’s consumed a pot of coffee by this point.
Dean made a funny coughing noise that sounded a bit like a suppressed laugh and Castiel raised an eyebrow. “What? Did I use that expression wrong?”
Gabe stared at Castiel like he had a third eye. “Pastry, Cas. I sell pastry. And other desserts.” A
Gabe hummed along as the song continued, and when it ended, he turned to Castiel and said, “You’re sounding pretty good there, bro. Is this your favorite Gene Kelly movie?”
Castiel answered without hesitation: “Definitely the Nash Rambler.”
“Because, uh, y’know.” Gabe shifted a little. “It’s basically all you consumed for two weeks straight. And you weren’t really in a good place while you were doing it, so I just thought—”
Gabe shot Castiel a mixed look of consternation and genuine worry before returning his attention to Michael. “Michael, this is Castiel’s friend, Dean.”
“Garth doesn’t do cell phones.” Dean ran a hand along his jaw, and he suddenly looked twice as tired.
Dean appeared to stifle a chuckle before saying, “All the same, Cas, that sucks. That’s not how family should work.”
“Michael,” Castiel choked out, hastily taking a small step backwards. He heard a distinct thump from the couch area and tried to swallow, feeling like most of his body had gone offline. “What—?”
“That’s ‘cause it is fun.” Dean pulled open the side door and flicked on the light. Castiel blinked in the sudden amber glare; as his eyes adjusted, he saw that the walls were covered in too many tools to name, and dozens of car parts that Castiel didn’t even know existed. To the right was a wide bay that held three old cars, the one nearest to them looking a good deal better than the other two. Castiel recognized the nice car’s trademark shape and wooden paneling and grinned. “So this is the station wagon.”
“Wait… we played Uno?” he asked not remembering at all. Dean just nodded and Castiel’s blush intensified.
Dean and Cas had their first fight and Sam talks to Cas about Dean...
(See the end of the chapter for
“Get lost Novak, this is none of your business,” he growled turning back to the kid. Cas approached a little more, standing right behind him. When the other boy turned around a fist collided with his face and he tumbled backwards, away from the kid. He recovered quickly and was now walking towards Cas, anger masking his features. He lunged at Cas who dodged his blow easily before hitting him in the guts making him bow over in pain. Castiel didn’t hesitate a second before repeating his motion, sending the taller boy to the ground. Suddenly someone was turning him around before he felt pain rush through his face. Alastair’s friend had punched him. He tried to straighten up again but another fist collided with his face, blood running out of his nose. Cas was able to dodge the next hit and instead landed one on his attacker who backed away.
They had decided to leave the next day and head back to the bunker. Gabriel had offered to just zap them home but Dean would never leave his Baby so now the Winchesters were sitting in the front seats and Cas and Gabe in the back. The drive was long and Cas spent most of it dozing and looking out the window.
“Dean, I was
“I know it sucks but at least we can enjoy the last night here,” Dean told him with a sheepish grin. Cas nodded in agreement before taking another sip from his drink. They were waiting for a taxi, Cas leaning against Dean, his suit jacket slung tightly around him, regretting not having brought a warmer one.
“Cas I want to pay”, he said happily,” it’s my treat.”
After they cleaned up if you could call it that, with Dean always trying to distract Cas, they went upstairs and started packing. They decided that they wouldn't stay any longer. "Hey, Dean," Cas said, packing away a t-shirt, "Yes". "We need to talk about last night. I feel like something is bothering you". Dean let his bag drop to the floor and sat down on the edge of the bed. Cas joined him and they sat in silence for a few moments. "Look Cas, what I said last night..." he stopped to gather his thoughts "I was really wasted and I didn't want to tell you like that. I wanted to be sober and actually remember what your reaction was and... and I am sorry I just started rambling and..." Dean started to drift off, losing himself in his thoughts. Cas laid a hand on his shoulder which made Dean look at him. "It's okay Dean, don't worry. I know you wanted to be sober but still, you didn't force this onto me. I would have liked it if you hadn't needed alcohol to open up but I appreciate it anyways" Cas stopped and looked into Dean's eyes. "I'll tell you what I told you yesterday. I'll always be there for you no matter what. I know I can't change what happened but I can be there for you in the future and don't you
Last year he wouldn’t have dreamt of being in a relationship, let alone so publicly. Dean and Cas left at around 10 pm, wishing all of them a good New Year before walking to the Impala.
“Your honor” he started but was cut off by the judge.
Taking a deep breath, he grabbed the edge of his shirt and pulled it over his head, revealing his, with scars and bruises covered, body. He gazed at Gabe who was looking at him with anger in his eyes; not against Cas but against the people who put those scars there, and at that moment he knew that Dean had been right.
After a few more punches, Alastair and his friend were beaten up pretty bad, retreating.
Castiel shivered as they stepped out of the back door and into the freezing air. Dean glanced up at the sky. “I think it’ll actually snow tonight. ‘Bout damn time.”
“I… you…” Dean snapped his mouth shut. “Shut up. C’mon, Cas.” He headed for the kitchen, tugging Castiel along behind him. “Let’s go make these fuckers some breakfast.”
“I figured out what we’re doing for dinner,” Castiel replied, handing over the paper with his own smile. “My treat, of course, but you’ll have to be the one to drive.”
Dean kept pace with Castiel as they walked up Castiel’s front path. “Most of the time, yeah.”
Dean: i figured out what we’re doing this wkend
< Dean: …
Castiel shrugged and leaned back in his armchair. “What can I say? Everybody loves Batman!”
“No.” Castiel stroked Dean’s jaw line and ran a finger across his bottom lip. “I want to see your face.”
Dean and Anna nodded, but Castiel shot a look at his brother. “I don’t understand. What’s a Vine?”
“Uh huh, sure.” The corner of Dean’s mouth twitched. “At least I know you’re takin’ your meds.”
that a therapist began to disparagingly question Castiel’s career. All in all, it was rather… overwhelming. He was finally left alone around seven o’clock in the evening, when the doctors began to retreat to their homes and dinners.
He could hear Dean’s smirk. “Amen to that, man.” He finished off his piece of bread before asking, “So what’s the deal with your car? ‘Cause I know a really good guy down off Central Avenue who—”
“So,” Dean said when he had reached the living room. “Blizzard.”
Castiel leaned forward to take a look at the drawing. “I like it.” He smiled. “You’re good at this.”
“Apple pieeee!” the others chanted back at him, barely holding back their laughter.
“Why don’t you talk to Michael?” Dean sat back on his heels, the Hydrogen Peroxide apparently forgotten.
“Oh, oh yeah. I just didn’t sleep well last night.” Dean waved away Castiel’s worry as he collapsed on the couch and pulled out a small notepad that had vague scribblings across the page. Bastet, who was curled up in her basket next to him, let out a little chirp as he threaded his fingers through her fur. “You tally up yet?”
“Professor Novak?”
Dean thought for a moment before raising his gaze above the edge of the book. “Irwin. Or maybe Papa Chance. He reminds me of my dad a little,” he added before Castiel could ask why. “And Winnie’s just…” Dean shook his head. “He’s kinda… wonderful.”
A habit that Gabe was forming was to rib Castiel on a twice-daily basis about Castiel’s civic duty to “climb Dean like a tree,” despite all of Castiel’s unamused, glowering silences and insistence that he was 99% sure that Dean was straight.
“If you’re still riding that train, then you aren’t as smart as I thought you were.” But Gabe wisely let it drop, and the conversation moved on.
“Okaythankyou,” Sam garbled. “I don’t need a visual
“But—but—I—” Castiel spluttered.
Castiel would persistently ignore this, much to Gabe’s eternal chagrin.
“Sure, buddy,” Gabe replied, dropping his hand from Castiel’s shoulder and turning back to the adventures of three sailors in New York City.
“I feel ya.” Anna stood up as well, looking a little out of it.
“No, but I’ve been asleep for at least a couple of hours, so maybe three? Four? It’s still dark outside.” Dean leaned forward, his hand firm against Castiel’s back. “Are you okay?”
Dean chuckled. “Nah, that’s just good filmmakin’.” He grabbed another handful of popcorn, although how he still had room for more food was a mystery to Castiel. “So did you like it?”
The voice was low and familiar. “You were havin’ a nightmare. At least, I think it was a nightmare.”
“I don’t doubt it.” Castiel stood up, reaching for her. “Here. I have to put her sweater on.”
Castiel nodded, even though he wanted nothing more than to turn and run in the other direction. “Let’s go upstairs and finish this quickly.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You bet,” she replied, still smirking in her infuriating way.
“You sure?” Dean prodded, one hand still on Castiel’s shoulder.
“Apparently.” Castiel shifted slightly in the bed. “I don’t suppose you’ll be letting me get out of bed anytime soon?” At least his catheter had been removed, which meant that, with some help detaching his electrodes, he could hobble to the bathroom a couple of times a day. But he was strictly told that he had to stay in bed, which meant no exploring, or walking around or visiting the cafeteria.
Castiel quickly went down to the cellar and threw together a box of canned and dry goods, an extra camping stove, and half a day’s supply of firewood. His mind whirling, he ignored the look Gabe was giving him as Dean pulled on Castiel’s old coat and snapped on Castiel’s extra pair of snowshoes.
“That’s us.” Castiel stood up, tugging up the handle on his carry-on as other people began moving towards the gate. “C’mon, Dean. Think of it like this: the sooner we get on the plane, the sooner we get off the plane.”
Castiel scoffed and unsuccessfully tried to shift away from Dean’s hand. “Don’t be ridiculous—”
Castiel took a quick lungful of air, his breathing coming in unsteady pants. “For whom?”
“Cas, you gotta WAKE UP!”
Castiel opened his briefcase and removed a sheaf of papers. “Proofing my current paper.”
An hour or so later, Castiel finally gathered his things to go home, and Hael bundled Bastet into her carrier, making sure there were at least two blankets to keep her warm. Castiel thanked Hael as he shouldered the bag, wishing her a good night as he left the office. Once he was safely down the hallway, Hael ducked into his office, her hopeful mood vanishing when she saw the French roll sitting on the edge of his desk, the smallest part of the end broken off.
at some point,” Dean reminded him, pulling up the information on the Rambler’s current owner. “Don’t forget that.”
He stood up accordingly, ignoring the way Dean did the same. “What’s the verdict?”
Castiel snorted. “Like I fell down the stairs twice and spent the night in a ditch.”
Castiel shrugged, tucking Bastet against his side and sitting down on the couch, reaching for the small knitted garment he’d left on the coffee table. “I keep it handy for the colder months. She is a short hair, after all.” He slid Bastet onto his lap before gently pulling the tiny sweater over her head, then carefully lifting each front paw and nudging them through the arm holes, Bastet licking his wrists through the entire process. Then, he unfurled the rest of the sweater down her body, where it almost reached her hind legs, gave her a quick kiss on the head, and put her back in her basket.
“Got any sevens?”
“Your dream, Cas.” Dean didn’t move his hands from Castiel’s arms and, if anything, gripped them more tightly. “You were havin’ your dream.”
wahey introductions yaaayyyyy
“Do you always do this?”
Dean hummed in agreement; he’d believe it.
p.p.s. according to my beta, there needs to be a kiss soon. any other opinions about this? ;)
thanks for reading!! <3
Tuesday was a little less intense, much to Castiel’s relief. He woke up around six, feeling fully rested and blindly wondering if this was what it was like to never have nightmares. He was just beginning to bemoan Bastet’s absence (Gabe had taken her home after dinner the night before) when Dean appeared with a toothy grin and a little dish of bandages and tape. “How you doin’, Cas?”
“Jesus, man.” Dean released him with a sigh. “What the hell are these dreams  doin’ to you?”
“Right?” Dean grinned around his glass before draining it completely. “Good times.” He put his empty glass down on the coffee table. “All right. I’d better get goin’.” Dean stood up and headed for the front door. Castiel inhaled slowly and accepted the silent dismissal. He stood up as well, and frowned when he saw Dean staring in fascination at his coat, which was suddenly two sizes too big.
“Do you have a spare?”
She chuckled, walking with him back to his room. “I can’t blame you. Hospitals can be pretty suffocating.” He looked at her in surprise — was everyone in this hospital so open with their patients? “So you’re on these for six weeks, aren’t you?” she continued.
At this distance, Castiel could smell Dean’s old-fashioned soap, his laundry detergent, and his unique scent, something like freshly-cut grass and the oily lanolin smell of a thick woolen blanket. It was… very distracting. He swallowed heavily and smiled back. “That sounds charming. But seriously, what does it look like?”
Castiel, true to habit and his very real fear of what havoc Michael’s visit had wreaked on his psyche, had stayed awake for all of Sunday night working on his paper, groggy though he was when he hugged Gabe goodbye (“Call me, Cas, seriously, call me,” Gabe had insisted while his taxi lingered by the curb) and taught his class (he’d only fumbled his words once, which he considered a personal achievement). He’d managed to make it through the day on coffee and a little bit of wishful thinking, ignoring the worried looks that Hael sent his way every time he came into the office.
There was the sound of someone coming up the stairs and a second later Gabe banged into the room, rebounding off the door. He leaned down to look Castiel in the eye, one of his cheekbones bright red and starting to swell. “Are you okay?”
“Oh, and Dean’s coming,” Anna tossed over her shoulder as she settled back into drawing what looked to be the love child of a serpent and a griffin.
sorry for the late update x_x but tech weeks are so killer. i'll try to write the next chapter more quickly!! again, thank you so much for reading xxx
Dean chuckled, flipping to the next page, which showed more photos of Castiel wearing his little suit and serving bite-size cakes and pastries and sandwiches to his mother’s Bible-and-cream-tea group. “You look so… professional.”
“I’m not going to impose—”
Castiel licked his lips, belatedly wanting more water and wishing that Dean wasn’t in the room to hear this. “He… abused me sporadically throughout my childhood, but took… ‘special care’ with me during his last two years in the house, when I was fourteen and fifteen.”
Castiel chewed his lip and shifted slightly. Yup, that was definitely an arm. A very strong arm. A very warm arm. An arm that didn’t belong to him. He turned his head to the side and almost yelped because yup, yuppity yup, that was Dean. Dean, curled into Castiel’s side, drooling on Castiel’s shoulder, snoring a little, clinging to Castiel’s torso, pressing his very evident hard-on to Castiel’s hip.
he rationalized.
“I—I never meant—”
Castiel scoffed and bit a piece of bacon in half. “All right. Let’s pretend that I full-on Florence-Nightingaled you instead of just handing you a couple of pills.”
“Me too,” Bobby added, putting down his hand of cards and rubbing his eyes with a yawn.
Castiel tried to think of a reason to say no, but he couldn’t find one. “Yes, Dean. I’d really like that.”
Castiel lowered his bare right foot to the floor and slowly put some weight onto it. The floor was cold and smooth, and a slight tingling sensation traveled up his leg.
Dean raised an eyebrow at him. “You’ve got a broken ankle and bruised ribs.”
Dean nodded and managed to force out a shaky, “Yes.”
Michael’s lip curled again. “
regardless, HAPPY CHRISTMAS!!!!! <3 hope this is a good enough gift :3
“Oh mah Gah.” He took a bigger bite. “The hell did you put in this?”
. He tipped the pill into his mouth and took a swallow of water.
He gave the phone back to Gabe, who read the sentence with a nod before his brow furrowed and he typed out:
Castiel couldn’t suppress a smile as he passed Dean and headed down the second flight. “Yes. Hysterical.”
“Meg.” Garth tugged her in the direction of the door. Kevin groaned from the porch. “Time for bed.”
“That didn’t count,” Dean insisted, hoisting his duffel over his shoulder. “That was only for an hour. This is sweet, blessed earth.”
She spent the next twenty minutes showing him how to use the crutches, even taking him out into the stairwell so he could learn how to go up and down stairs. Castiel wasn’t fond of the way the crutches rubbed under his arms, but he was grateful for the mobility.
Castiel sighed in defeat, pulling up a chair and sitting across from Dean. “Okay. I went to Middlebury College for my undergrad. I mainly studied world religions, gender and sexuality, pop culture and media studies, Latin and Greek, some Ancient Hebrew…” He waved a hand dismissively. “Long story short, I took a lot of classes and got myself noticed, if not because I was working so hard that my advisor was worried for my health. Like I told you, I always just sort of knew that theology was what I wanted to study, specifically the role of world religions on politics, pop culture, and global media. I was accepted into Harvard’s graduate program, where I published several papers mostly out of my own boredom and partially because I couldn’t fit everything I wanted into my doctoral thesis. For my thesis, which was about how religious views on gender and sexuality are reflected in respective Eastern and Western society and pop culture, I traveled to several different countries for research and published my thesis by the time I was twenty-six.” He shrugged again. “I’m a fast worker. By that point, Harvard had decided that it wanted me to stay on as Assistant Professor, so I accepted, and I worked there for four years, teaching courses like the one you experienced today and working on a new research project while I was getting my first couple of books in order. I also attended many symposiums and conventions, and guest-taught at several universities. At one point, NPR asked me to be a part of their speaker series, so I accepted, which is why, unfortunately, my voice is now forever on the Internet. Last winter, I decided that I wanted a change, so I used my contacts to start looking for different positions. Oberlin was one of the most lucrative offers, and they said they would give me a full Professorship if I tightened up and renovated their department as the Chair. So, I took it, and here I am.” Castiel blinked. “Can we get lunch now?”
Dean chuckled lightly. “Angel of Thursday, huh? Is that who you’re named after?”
“You’re not intrudin’,” Bobby said instantly. “Besides, you’re—” He cut himself off for a moment before he said, “You’re basically family at this point.”
“Hot damn,” Dean mumbled close to Castiel’s ear. “You didn’t tell me that they were all obsessed with you.”
Castiel barely managed not to groan. “No, not really.”
“Aw, you—” Suddenly, Dean let out a violent sneeze, followed by a fit of coughing.
Dean, looking as irritatingly perfect as ever, was standing over Castiel’s stove wearing yesterday’s clothes. His mouth twitched into something like a smile as he slid his cell phone into his pocket and absently waved the spatula in Castiel’s direction. “Mornin’.”
taken from
Agnes grinned widely. “That would be wonderful! Thank you so much, Professor!”
“Anyway,” Dean was saying, shaking his wrist to look at his watch. “I’m here ‘cause my shift ends in an hour and I thought I’d remind you that you’re gonna be discharged around eleven, maybe noon if the PT is runnin’ late. Means you’re gonna need someone to pick you up.”
only the epilogue left now...
say you’re sorry for somethin’ like this.”
“For God’s sake, Cas,” Dean interrupted, finding the right drawer and grabbing a few forks and spoons. “You’re on crutches. I’m not about to let you cook.” He shot Castiel a look. “That would be violatin’ my Hippocratic Oath.”
different.” He considered. “Well, except that we’ve seen each other naked. That’s different.”
Castiel stared at him. “What?”
“You look good, Cas!” Meg said after polishing off her beer. “You work out?”
“The only long-term relationship he’s ever had. It was during college.” Gabe noticed Dean’s look and smirked. “Jealous?”
“Here.” Castiel dropped the bedding down onto the couch and started taking off the cushions lining the back.
Castiel gasped awake, someone’s hands on his arms and shoulders and face and —
Dean glanced at Castiel and chuckled. “You so are.”
Dean sat up instantly, almost spilling the rest of his chili as he half-threw his bowl onto the coffee table. Bastet jumped off his lap, indignant. “Is she okay?” he demanded of whoever was on the other line. “Where did they take her?”
Castiel jerked backwards, doing a very sloppy job of scrambling towards the other end of the couch. He kept on backing away, his hands reaching behind him. “Dean, I’m—I’m so—”
Castiel nodded and went out of the room, closing the door behind him. Letting out a mental stream of curse words, he pulled out his phone and began a new text:
Dean made a small sound in the back of his throat and squeezed his eyes shut. “Jesus.”
< Anna: Thanks, sis. Everything is going great! About to head to class. More details soon.
“We’ve been over this. Yes. I did.” Castiel gave up on Dean’s mouth and started trailing kisses along the underside of Dean’s stubbled jaw.
“Yup,” Dr. Bradbury was saying as she watched him swing himself around the hallway outside his room. The nurse behind the desk — Jo, Castiel remembered — grinned at him as he went by. “I think you’re ready to go. You’re a fast learner,” she added, giving him a smile.
Castiel went still, wondering if Dean was going to ask him what he was doing. “Yes, Dean?”
Gabe scoffed and waved a patronizing hand at him. “If I didn’t love it, I wouldn’t be doing it for a living.”
“Sally was here yesterday.” Dean smiled as he turned on the TV. “Remember? The RN when you had your broken leg? She saw you through the door when you were still asleep and she asked me what you had done to yourself this time. We got to talkin’, and she confessed that you two had quite the
Castiel slumped back in his seat and Dean shifted so that he could grip Castiel’s shoulder. “Panic attack,” Castiel mumbled, rubbing his eyes.
Castiel shook off Dean’s hand. “Then why’d you say it?”
“Please, Dean.” Castiel waved a piece of bacon around like a wizard casting a spell. “I grew up in Maine and went to college in Vermont. My basement is a snow-hoarder’s paradise.”
> Dean: whoever hands out most candy WINS
Castiel opened the box of cards and slid the deck into his hand. “So are you in, or are you out? Going to leave me sitting here playing Solitaire until the crack of dawn?”
“Shit,” came Dean’s muttered curse, and he gave Castiel an apologetic look. “That was the cat’s fault, not mine.”
A proper scowl knit Castiel’s features, and he fought the urge to slump. “I don’t like it.”
” The implication was hard to miss.
“Mrrawp,” Bastet replied, her eyes squeezing shut as she purred.
“Don’t be embarrassed,” Dean told him, reading Castiel’s expression correctly. “Happens all the time.”
“Will do.” Dean smiled, and it was something more tender, more sweet, than before. “And thanks.”
“Why won’t Bastet come and sit on
“Cafeteria food isn’t Pad Thai,” Dean clarified as he grabbed his own portion and dug in. He moaned a little and Castiel tried his best not to stare. “It definitely isn’t Pad Thai.”
“Then that explains why we haven’t seen each other very often. Or, you know, met.”
“Huh?”
“Fuck my life,” Castiel whispered, wondering how the hell he was going to get out of this and preserve any illusion of their ‘friendship.’ And without encouraging his own semi, which, yeah, was definitely and unhelpfully there. Then, he realized with a shock that the air around him, was… cold. Very cold. Abnormally cold. A lot colder than it was supposed to be. He sat up, plunging into the frigid air of his room and forgetting all bedroom etiquette, which he immediately regretted when Dean grumbled in his sleep, adjusting and tightening his grip on Castiel’s waist. Bastet chimed in with her own sleepy “mrrrawp” from the vicinity of Castiel’s shin. But Dean failed to wake up, and Castiel reached for a spare pillow that he slowly coaxed Dean into accepting as a substitute for Castiel’s body. Dean hugged the pillow, burrowing into the duvet as Castiel slid out of bed.
“Here.” RN Sally turned on the TV and started flicking through channels. “Anything in particular?”
Castiel paused for a moment, his grin too big to swallow as he leaned over Dean, their legs tangled together. Here, in the staggered, silver rays of moonlight, Dean looked more beautiful than he ever had before; his eyes fairly gleamed in the dark as he stared back at Castiel before the corner of his swollen mouth twitched and he said, “What?”
Dean huffed, almost laughing. “Okay, okay…” He took the medicine and quickly tossed it back, grimacing at the taste.
The nurse raised his eyebrows. “Hit n’ run?”
“You’re tired,” Castiel stated. “I’m sorry. I’d forgotten that you just worked the entire night. Please, don’t let me keep you any longer.”
“What?” Dean smirked. “Don’t you think it suits me?” He adjusted his red tie, which stood out magnificently against his long-sleeved blue plaid.
Castiel let out a small squawk of surprise. “Thirty?!”
“I would’ve chosen the dirt.”
And here they now were, six weeks after Castiel’s accident, and just a few days before the start of his semester, walking into the hospital to get his cast taken off. He wasn’t sure how he felt about the whole thing: the end of this, of being injured — in addition to  the beginning of the school year — had to mean the end of something with Dean, but he wasn’t sure what it would be, or if it would even happen, and he sure as hell wasn’t ready to find out.
If any surprise had to occur on his first day at Oberlin, Castiel was glad it was the addition of fifteen students to his intro class. They were all bright, welcoming, and, somehow, very excited to take his course, which wasn’t always the case at his previous school. After smiling his way through a half-hour of get-to-know-you games, Castiel moved through the syllabus with ease, making sure to emphasise his office hours and the level of work required for the course. “This may be a 100-level course,” he warned them, “but I’m going to expect a lot of you.”
“But this one jerk threatened me to behave or otherwise he would make my time there be like hell and then the principal told me that I have to change my appearance or otherwise there will be
“I just wanted to see what was taking you so long.” Dean frowned a bit in annoyance.
After some days of silence, Cas and Dean finally talk to each other...
"You think you deserve to suffer because of all the things that happened to you. Well life ain't always how we want it to be. Get over it." "Are you serious right now. After everything I told you, after everything you saw, you think I should just get
Hey guys, I'm sorry again for not posting last week but school is so stressful right now.
“Not necessarily. I mean maybe the ghosts were close to the current owner and they help them get revenge.”
“Maybe, we have to look into it, ask the locals?” Dean said as they went back outside to find Sam standing at the Impala.

Castiel was standing in front of the mirror in his room, looking at his reflection. He was wearing a black suit with a white button-up shirt and a blue tie. He pushed his hair down, trying to make himself look somewhat presentable. Today was the day of the trial. He hadn’t really slept last night, overthinking everything that could happen. His hands were shaking slightly and he put them in the pockets of his pants in order to still them. Dean was going to pick him up in a few minutes and they would meet Gabriel there. Taking a last look at his reflection he grabbed his phone and trenchcoat and walked to the living room.
Cas frowned at the note and made his way to the coffee machine to make himself a coffee. He had no idea what he should do and so he went upstairs and pulled his notebook out. He started scribbling pieces of poems and songs down until he had enough and decided to go out and discover the city alone. He walked through bookstores and tried on different shirts and jackets until he decided to buy a beige trench coat. He had seen it when he was walking out of a store and decided to try it on. He loved it and bought it without hesitation. He was so happy with his purchase that when he exited the shop he put the long trench coat on, which was something he never did. When lunch came around he went to a coffee shop and ordered something to eat and a cappuccino. His phone started ringing and when he saw who was calling he almost dropped it. The name on the screen read
Special thanks to my beta E. You are just great
Holy shit guys so this is the last chapter of my story (without the epilogue). I am so grateful that I actually got to finish this story because of all of you guys so a massive thank you for that.
“Not really. The victims don’t really have any defensive wounds. The slashed throats are way too neat for a human, too precise.” Cas commented. Dean hummed and pulled out the emf-meter after making sure nobody saw him. The thing beeped slightly.
“Well, Cassie here said he needed help with a case so I decided that I don’t want to leave my baby bro hanging.” He said and snapped his fingers, a lollipop appearing in his hand and he popped it into his mouth.
“I would like that…” He admitted and Gabe shone his light away from Cas and up at Sam.
A chill ran up his spine by the touch of hands against his bare skin but he relaxed immediately. They continued kissing, hands wandering around, kisses being placed on lips and jaws and necks. Everything was great until Dean’s hands started fumbling at the hem of Castiel’s shirt starting to pull it up. Cas pulled back a little.
“Sorry guys it’s just so funny, like haven’t you heard about locking the door?” Anna asked clutching her stomach from laughter. Dean just glared at her, embarrassment still visible on his features.
“Cas?” Gabe asked a little concerned.
“On it,” Sam said and focused back on his laptop. A few minutes later he looked back up.
“Hey, hey, calm down. He won’t think any less of you, he might even think that you are stronger than he already knew you are.”
Love, Winchester_destiel.
“Dean are you in there?” he asked but he got no answer, so Cas tried to open the door but it was locked.
“Yea,” Dean said but Cas could see that he was lying.
“Just take it Cas. I don’t want you to catch a cold,” the green-eyed boy interrupted him. Cas knew how stubborn Dean could be and so he put the jacket on, smiling gratefully at Dean. Soon after, their taxi arrived and they drove to their hotel, holding hands the whole time.
“Cas it’s 10 am,” Dean chuckled.
“Cas listen to me, you didn’t ruin anything. I hadn’t even thought that we would be making out tonight and to be honest I don’t want to be drunk either when we sleep together. The night was, and still is, perfect because I am with you and no matter what we do, it’s great.” When Cas finally looked at him there was pure honesty in his eyes.
He wanted to work in a coffee shop near his apartment. He knew it wasn’t much but it would be enough for now. He still had some money stashed away for emergencies anyway. He spent a few hours working and then sending his application before driving back home.
“Why didn’t you do anything to help your son?”
Dean laughed a bit at the last name. „Lucifer really? Well my brother is called Sam. He is a few years younger than me and is still in high school." and so they talked about their families, school and pretty much everything. The time passed so fast, that when they looked at the clock over the counter, it was already 5pm. Through their whole conversation, Castiel took mental notes of all the things Dean liked and disliked. They walked back to their cars, it had stopped raining, and when Castiel saw Dean car, he let out a whistle. „Is that an impala Chevy?" he asked. "Yea it's an impala Chevy 67 and it's my Baby. I wouldn't give her away for anything." Dean said. Castiel noticed how proud and happy Dean was when he talked about his car.
Cas took a deep breath, "mom, dad, and Lucifer". There was a silence for a long time before someone spoke again.
“Hey, you ready?” he asked and Cas nodded, grabbing his phone and pushing it into the pocket of his pants. The ride was silent, only the hum of the Impala's engine and the soft music, filled the small room of the car. Cas looked over at Dean and saw that he was gripping the steering wheel so tight that his knuckles were turning white.
“You have to open it.” Dean did as he was told and opened it, looking at the first page.
The next few days Dean and Cas spent by walking through town before ending up in a cafe or bookshop, not only to warm their bodies from the cold but also to look for more books they could buy. Dean mostly sat in a chair waiting for Castiel to finish his shopping before leaving again, continuing their walk.
“Now, I’ll go and get some well-deserved rest. I’m dead tired and I can barely keep my eyes open.” Dean said and pushed his chair back. “Night.” He said and left. The others cleaned away everything before Charlie and Sam turned in for the night as well, which left the two brothers alone.
“Hey can I sit here?” the boy from one of his classes said. The one Cas was crushing on, to be exact. Castiel gestured to one of the many empty chairs to which he complied.
Dean thought as he felt ‘little Dean’ take an interest. So instead of giving in to his temptations, he turned the water as cold as he could handle and quickly left the shower.
“Oh nothing, just waiting for you to finally confess your feelings for Dean-bean.” He smirked. Cas rolled his eyes.
“Wow indeed. So… this?” He gestured between them. “You want this?” Dean placed a hand on his cheek, rubbing his cheekbone.
“Well that was awkward,” he stated turning towards Cas.
So that's it. This is the last chapter of my story. After you read this it'll all be over. I hope the road was great and I hope you all had fun reading it. I am so grateful that I got to bring you along on this crazy story and just wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped me and who read this. So yea thanks, guys.
“What do you mean?” He asked with a head tilt. Dean sighed.
“I’d like to call my last witness, Lucifer Novak” he stated. When Lucifer went to the seat at the front, Cas could feel his throat close even more. His brother had a confident smirk on his face which Cas hated. He gazed over the room until his eyes met Castiel’s. Cas wanted to look away but felt unable to. His stomach turned by the cold and evil look in his brothers' eyes. They were so filled with rage and anger that Cas was afraid of what would happen if they lost.
Castiel froze when he saw his brother. He had the same short blond hair and the same blue eyes he had too. His grin sent shivers down Castiel's spine. His brother sat on the only empty chair at the table. Opposite to Cas. Castiel's stomach hurt and he wasn’t hungry anymore, he just wanted to get out of there. The conversation continued but Castiel was silent. He tried to eat more for his mother’s sake but he couldn't. "What’s the problem Cassie, not hungry?" Lucifer said, pulling Cas out of his thoughts. "Yes I am" he answered. "Then eat" his brother said provokingly. Castiel shoved some food into his mouth even though he had to force it down his throat. Lucifer’s eyes stayed on him the whole time. "So Cassie tell us, have you found a girlfriend yet. Or any friend at all?" "Lucifer" his mother exclaimed. "It's okay mom" Cas said and turned his gaze back to his brother, trying to stay calm. "Yes I have friends and no I don't have a girlfriend yet." His brother wanted to say something to him but was interrupted by the sound of Castiel’s phone ringing. It was Anna and Castiel was grateful that she called him so many times a day. He stood up and went to his room. When he entered his room, he locked his door and slide down on it. He let the call go to voicemail and he started crying.
“Why because you are afraid that you’ll lose?” Dean asked sarcastically.
When they finally arrived at the Winchester house, it was already 1am in the morning. They entered the house and Sam went straight to his room, mumbling a tired good night as he walked upstairs. Dean led Cas to his room after drinking a glass of water. Even though the house wasn't really big or something, with bottles lying around the living room and the kitchen, Cas already loved this place. They went upstairs and entered Dean’s room. When dean turned the light on, Cas was met with a small-ish room. The first thing he saw was Deans king sized bed, which was standing in the middle of the room and was talking away most of the space. The covers where made and on top of them were some pillows. Nothing special. Over the bed were some band posters. They were decorating the wall, together with some pictures. His desk was squeezed between to bookshelves on the other side of the room. His desk was kept pretty simple with only the necessary things on it. The bookcase to the right was filled with old books and journals. Cas loved it. The other one, Cas founds out, wasn't a bookcase and was rather a dresser.
“Hey, Cas you still in there?” Dean’s voice bled through the door.
“Actually that’s not true. In nature there are over 1500 species that have same-sex couples and there are also animals where the female is the highest in their hierarchy. In a school of clownfish for example the female is the biggest fish, she’s also the only female, and if she dies the next biggest male fish, turns into a female and is then their new leader,” Cas said, looking at them.
Castiel was starring at the door on the other side of the room. He was sitting on the edge of the bathtub and starred into space, Dean next to him. All the memories from his childhood came back. All the horrible things he had to go through and all the pain. Tears were filling up his eyes again and he felt his body shaking. Dean's grip around his arm tightened and he felt how the other man put down the scissors and pulled Cas closer to him. Cas was now leasing against Dean's chest, silent tears running down his bruised face. They sat there without saying a word for a long time before, Dean got back to patching him up, still staying silent. When they finished, Cas had calmed down again and he was just quietly sitting there, while Dean cleaned everything up. He wanted to do something, say something, but he couldn't. His body felt numb. "Dean... I am so sorry..." he finally said. "Hey it's okay. You don't have to apologize for anything. It's not your fault." Dean said wrapping him into a tight embrace. "So let's go and pack up your things" Dean said and walked to the door.
“Yeah? And what would that be? He didn’t leave a note or something and he is not answering his phone.” Dean growled. Cas frowned and walked past him to his own phone, turning it on. He had a message from Gabe.
Bartholomew isn't happy with Cas,
“Awesome,” Charlie said, the first thing she had said the whole time.
Dean grabbed a sandwich but he didn’t take a bite but instead continued to look at the television absently. Cas put his own plate down and reached out touching Dean’s arm softly.
"Nah don't worry, it's nice of you..." Dean raised an eyebrow at that. "Really?" Cas nodded.
“Maybe you wouldn’t be so grumpy if you… I don’t know, flirted with Dean too? Way more fun than holding a light.” Cas flushed and looked down, focusing on his job because if he looked at Dean right now, he would see how much cas actually wanted that.
“Nice meeting you Castiel,” she said a genuine smile forming on her lips. Anna’s voice spoke up again over the sound of the music.
“Smartass,” Dean said teasingly before focusing back on the situation.
Dean helped him change into one of his hoodies and a pair of sweatpants and then Castiel fell back down onto the mattress with a loud groan, lying in the middle of the king-sized bed.
"It's okay Dean, you don't have to apologize. It's okay" Cas said reassuringly and kissed Dean again, this time softer. They exchanged a few more kisses before Cas said
They were sent outside after some more formalities were discussed so that the jury could think about their decision. Cas stood up and ran into Dean’s arms, letting him pull Cas into a tight hug.
When Dean woke up the next morning, it was to someone knocking on his door. He groaned and leaned up on his elbows.
They sat on the bed, cross-legged, opposite to each other.
“So you two together or something?” Balthazar asked, earning a punch on the arm from Benny.
"Let's burn the bodies first, stay a few more days after and see if we get more killings. If not, we leave, okay?" Dean grumbled as he pulled back into traffic.
It was afternoon when he responded with the words
“Tempting… but maybe you’ll be the one to ride me. Of course only after we come back from our date. Our date at the-” He broke off, kissed Cas passionately and dirty before he pulled away.
“Cas, you know the rules with alcohol,” Gabe said seriously.
"That you Sam this is really sweet of you. I know that Dean would do anything for the ones he loves. That's one of the reasons I fell in love for him..." Cas said, a blush creeping up his face "and I would do the same for him. I did and I have to admit that I can be just as stubborn when it comes to my family, well whatever is left of it..." Sam cut him off "Don't worry Cas, we are your family now and we would do anything for you. But can you promise me one thing" Sam said, not looking at Castiel. "Sure what is it" Cas said. "Can you please promise me that you won't leave Dean because it would break him. I know he plays tough and everything but he is just a man and he wouldn't survive it. I see how he looks at you when he thinks nobody is looking. He hasn't been that happy since mom..." Sam stopped catching himself before adding " If you break his heart, I will beat you up, or if I don't Bobby and Ellen will" he said and both men laughed. "Trust me I will never leave him. I couldn't" Sam stood up and walked towards the door, before Cas said "Oh and Sam, could you maybe bring me my guitar. Since I can't get out of bed, I would have at least something to do" Cas said with a smile and Sam nodded before leaving the room, closing the door behind him.
