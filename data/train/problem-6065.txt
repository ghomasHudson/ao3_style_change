he sent urgently.
Rhodey stood by him, recognizing all the signs. “Guess that’s another dead end, huh?”
Rhodey seemed unsettled, frowning slightly, but let it rest. “That’s…not so unreasonable. Okay.”
“I’m carrying you to the bathroom.  We need to get cleaned up.”
“Look at that.  You are a miracle, Steve, you really are.  Give that a stroke for me—just one.  Wouldn’t want you to get too excited, too soon.”  One stroke—not enough, not enough, but Steve forced himself to take his hand away, after.  The blue lace of the torn negligee, still hanging off his shoulders, tumbled into his face with the movement, and Steve blew a puff of air at it to send it off of his skin.  “Gooood.  Now then, what else did I want to make you do...
It was likely this wouldn’t be one of those. There were no obvious red flags in the area, and Tony wasn’t even going to be taking his suit like he did during his most dangerous escapades. It was too clunky and unwieldy to take when he went exploring (now if it was more streamlined, easier to put on, and not as likely to bring the cave ceiling down on his head…).
at you.”
“Lick it off.”
But that's not why he's going to Hell.
It wouldn’t be the weirdest thing Tony had ever encountered, even if the situation definitely was.
Tony didn’t bother responding, stepping into the room with an eagerness that would probably make Rhodey regret letting Tony go first. He didn’t think this was a solution to his heart issues, but that didn’t matter.
out of Steve’s grasp, wadding them up, and stuffing them in Steve’s mouth.
He started to move, and Steve clenched his hands into fists at his side as Tony rode him.  He hadn’t been told he could touch, for one thing, and his strength for another...  As Tony bounced him into the mattress, the plug pressed into him on every stroke.  Steve moaned wordlessly and tried for kisses, which sometimes Tony gave him—other times he missed, bounced off-course by the rhythm of the fucking—and Steve tried to think about it, tried to focus on that missed rhythm, because otherwise he was going to come too soon, too soon—Tony needed him to last for him, needed Steve to stay in control while Tony used him...
The plug was about five inches long, about four of which was designed to be inside the body, and that was one inch more than Steve could comfortably hold in his mouth without gagging; the plastic was somehow much worse than when it was Tony he was swallowing.  He tried three times before giving up on it, and instead cleaned it off with his mouth and tongue as best he could before setting it down.  There were a couple of soft gasps behind him when he was done, followed by some slick sounds and a moan.
“How about the year?”
“More sooner than not, considering this skirt,” she said dryly before standing and stepping into her own—much more modest—shoes.  “More modest” in the sense that they were platform heels; while they appeared to be just as sky high as Stark’s, the actual arch of them was only about one and a half inches.  Given the gems on them, however, she suspected “modest” might not be the right word; the bands around her ankles had more sapphires and diamonds in gold settings than they did leather, and all together the shoes were as heavy and unwieldy as some manacles Gwen had worn.
“Well, that’s not surprising,” Steve said. “You’re clever. You’d probably revamp their entire weapons system in a week.”
nice touch, using the AI’s monitoring equipment; that’s resourceful, good job—and then—no, not your hands; I want your hands free, put your chest all the way down on the bed.  That’s it.  Head turned away from me, since we’re doing this.”
to that rule was a police chief who had, three days before, attended one of those charity functions with you.”  Gwen paused, and watched the knowledge pass over Tasha’s face.  “Exactly.  SHIELD didn’t spot it at the time, because the allegations only came to light months later, but from my perspective?  Pretty obvious, Stark.”
good.  And that was sort of the point of all this...
The Himalayan Mountains were old.
“What are you going to do?” Rhodey glanced back to the tent.
He took the lead, Rhodey falling in behind him. Keeping to the path made walking easier than if they’d gone elsewhere, since at least human feet had gone this way before. Even if it was rocky, occasionally slippery, and almost twisted their ankles at certain points.
“God,
And he can knit.
her mouth moving steadily, her tongue flickering down, licking along Gwen’s insides and then returning upwards with that delicious, too-much-just-enough suctioning
blush this time, ducking her gaze away as a sunlit smile bloomed over her face.  It made her look softer, kinder.  Like a walled garden when the sun comes in.  “Okay,” Tasha said softly.  She took Gwen’s hand, squeezing their fingers together.  “Okay.”
Yeah, he didn’t have the best track record with lovers. At this point Tony had given up and was just trying to make it to the next year before his heart gave out. He’d try and find someone after that if there was any chance.
The foothills were a different matter, as they hadn’t had any luck finding a local to guide them. The language barrier surprisingly wasn’t the issue there. It was that no one seemed to want to go with them.
Tony would have said something, but he was still strangely at a loss for air that wouldn’t come. And his heart – his heart was stuttering in his chest, feeling weaker with every beat.
Steve flushed again, as he was pretty sure he was intended to, but he did it, angling his other leg out, too, so that Tony had a good view.
porn, though.
Gwen snorted.  “SHIELD doesn’t appear to have noticed this, but Iron Man isn’t actually all that bad.  I read the reports—did you know they gave me almost unlimited access to reports on you and him?  I think they were trying to prejudice me against you, but it had the opposite effect.  Iron Man—what is he, anyway?  A robot?”
There’d been something in the mountains. It might not have been what he expected, but he’d found it all the same.
He shuddered all over, from his shoulders to his knees.  He clenched down around the plug, which of course didn’t yield, and the resultant faint ache made him shudder again.  He was hard, he realized.  He supposed it shouldn’t really be a surprise.
to make her opinion known, smiling widely and too brightly.  “Gosh, do you think I could have some more champagne, Tasha?  It’s so bubbly.”
this was… Well, Tony could figure it out later.
Tony fired his own gun, not even aiming at anything specific. It was enough to make Zemo flinch and have his next shot go wide, clipping the top of the truck instead of Steve. The cloth caught on fire from the impact (but that wasn’t important, not as important as
the cold and being alone.
Steve had groaned and started to bring his legs back together.  He was squeezing around the plug, again, too conscious of it holding him open not to.
They hadn’t gotten that much information from the locals. They didn’t speak English and the local dialect wasn’t one that Tony or Rhodey were familiar with. What they did manage to cribble together from pantomiming and showing pictures of the guy that had gone “crazy” in the mountains was vague and didn’t tell them what they were looking for.
Tony smirked. “You sell war bonds with that motto, Cap?”
Gwen gritted out at her, “I was still conscious when you picked me up by that ugly jewelry you have decked me out in!”
It was chilly.  The lace bra, which in Gwen’s opinion had been insufficient in the first place, was definitely not enough to keep her nipples from pointing through the dress, and the blue was a pale enough shade that it would be immediately noticeable to anyone who walked in.  She wasn’t wearing any stockings, either, and her legs were breaking out in gooseflesh.  Her lower lip trembled, and she clenched her jaw; it wasn’t cold enough for her teeth to chatter yet, but all her kidnapper had to do was wet her down and then it
It took Rhodey a little longer than Tony since he actually took the entire backpack with him. He left Tony’s abandoned supplies down there, although still hidden behind a pile of rocks.
“Yeah.”  Tony’s words were low and fervent.  His eyes on Steve felt like warmth off a fire.  Steve found his hand moving, small little movements that wouldn’t jostle too much.  “Oh, you’re so good, Steve.”
“And they were all over the place?”
Gwen rather liked confusing beautiful women.  She always had.
She looked like she expected Gwen to say something, but there didn’t seem to be much point to that, so Gwen hung out in her bonds and waited for Tasha to lose patience.  Eventually, Tasha edged her way in front of Gwen and stood, arms crossed, glaring up at her.  When she finally spoke, it was a sulky mutter.  “...How’d you know?”
“Let’s take this elsewhere,” Steve said, ignoring Tony (which was honestly insulting but it wasn’t like Tony could protest about it right now). “You don’t want to do this here.”
but he decided against it. “He was going to shoot you.”
“Does that mean we’re eventually going to court your supposedly nonexistent death wish?” Rhodey asked.
The light swept over ice and snow that covered the rocky ground and hugged the walls in patches. It was sparse to the edges of the cavernous room, but piled up more vigorously towards the center.
“we’ve barely even gotten started!”
Still, a bouncing shield? Shields were supposed to be defensive, not…whatever this thing was.
Steve fumbled the damn thing when he went to pick it up, then caught it before it hit the bed and turned it around again.  It occurred to him that he could use two hands for it, but by then he was pressing it one-handed to his hole and shoving forward, his other hand still holding himself spread, at least halfway, so that Tony could get a good view.
But that's not why he's going to Hell, either.
“It couldn’t.”
Tony had
was a pretty good sign, though.
Tony rubbed at his mouth with his ungloved hand. Rhodey’s flashlight was trained on the shield, illuminating it. The way it was positioned and the amount of ice still left made it difficult to make out any features of this mysterious person beyond general facts like these were their legs, torso, arms, etc.
“I keep my promises,” Steve said, returning Tony’s kiss. And then, “You give me a home.” The words seemed like they were spoken absentmindedly, in-between kisses, but that didn’t make the weight they carried any less.
The first bulge slid into him with no more sensation than he had felt at first in this process, so Steve pushed on immediately to the second.  That he felt, but again, it was like the single finger.
She smiled at Stark again, because she was free from SHIELD for one night in a dress she was certain they had not signed off on, with a dangerous woman Gwen was certain they didn’t entirely approve of.  And because she thought Stark might find the sheer warmth of her smile either confusing, or confounding, or both.
“Fast forward,” Tony said when the three replays were done.  “Annnd... stop.  God, I will never get tired of this moment...”
Well, it didn’t matter. Tony wouldn’t let Zemo have him. He wasn’t going to let HYDRA turn him into another Zemo and use him to further their scheme for world domination.
Tony couldn’t see Steve’s face, but he had the solid impression that Steve was becoming uncertain (why was that thought vaguely terrifying?).
“Was that for the motion, or the way I said it?” Tony asked.  Steve tipped his head forward.  “Hmm...  Is it the word cock that you like?”
“What, by lubing yourself up and plugging yourself open?”  Tony obviously saw the effect his words had on Steve, because his eyes narrowed and he kept going.  “How much did you work yourself open?  Did you start out slow, gentle?  That’s how I would have done it.  I would have started with my tongue.  No, don’t close up.”
Gwen felt a little bad for her.  “I don't think anyone else has guessed,” she offered.  She shrugged as much as she could, still strung up like a Christmas goose.  “I really did have the advantage of getting it all at once.  Lets me see the larger pattern.”
“I definitely still am.  Okay, vibrator!  We don’t have one of those handy, but— grab that pretty blue plug of yours and stick it back in for me.”
All in a quest to try and find a way to keep his heart working beyond the mechanics of what he had in his chest. He’d been unsuccessful so far and had to put his search on temporary hold during World War II with Fury calling him in to help serve the country in the name of justice, spying, and sabotaging the other side, but the war was over now. Which left him free to continue his search and hope that his heart didn’t give out in the meantime.
and also—I’m stretched open, Tony, so much—so I can’t...”
“Do I know you?” Zemo asked, sounding politely confused. “Is there a reason you’re still standing here when you have better things to do than defend someone who doesn’t need it?”
“I don’t?” Zemo still had that tone of polite confusion, although it was now accompanied by an air of bemusement. “Why would I not?” He sounded slightly interested in Steve’s reasoning.
Tony touched him before he realized he was reaching out, moving over to tug him into his side. He almost froze when he realized what he was doing, but Steve was moving into the embrace like he’d expected it, body shivering violently against Tony’s.
His pulse raced ahead, outrunning even his rasping breathing, and he jerked back against the wall again.  Tony was watching
“If I have to,” Tony said. “First things first, we’re going to find out what happened to his team. If we get that, finding the rest should be easier. They were in the Army, so there are going to be records of their enlistment, even if most of it is censored.”
“Don’t move,” Steve said quickly, hands snapping out to stop Tony. “You’re still recovering.”
“I think it’s science,” Tony continued absentmindedly, remembering how Steve had lifted crates that Rhodey and Jarvis needed to help each other with. “He doesn’t
It should worry Tony that he trusted Steve this much after meeting him only a few days ago, but it didn’t.
What had an underage kid known to let Steve have him join the war efforts? It must have been something incredibly important.
The shield flashed through his mind, and Tony swallowed.
Gwen let her throat open, cries spilling out of her like wine from a too-full cup.  It was good, it was
,” he repeated in response to Steve’s pinched expression. “And I don’t regret it.”
Putting in the plug was the oddest part.  Steve hadn’t done much of that—not much anal play in general, really—but he knew Tony liked it, liked receiving specifically.  And he had a hunch Tony wouldn’t switch things around without Steve prompting him in some way.  So,
Tony realized he’d been staring rather dopily at Steve for too long to be brushed off as casual. He managed a relaxed grin and shook his head, jogging lightly over to the truck and accepting Steve’s hand as he clambered into the back of the truck.
By the time Tony entered, Steve was lounging mostly on his right side, top knee drawn upwards and obscuring his groin, the other stretched out straight behind him.  The enhanced rear view on the oversized screen helpfully showed off the curve of his ass, but only faintly hinted at the dark solid curve of the plug.  His weight was largely on his right arm, like it would be for a side plank, while the left arm draped backwards over his hip.  The position required him to twist a little at the waist and felt a bit casual, but it certainly
“But now...”  Tasha took a step closer to her; close enough to touch.  “Now, you’ve seen my face, which means that now, I can’t let you go.”
“I feel like I’ll see a ghost waving at me if I look over my shoulder,” Rhodey said as they walked through the village and back to their campsite.
Not begging, but close enough, Steve decided.  It was hard to think. His mind’s eye was crimson with the wanting.  Desire and ecstasy pulsed back and forth between the two of them, too fast to know who was starting it, who was sending what...  Steve changed grip again and sped up, bringing them off together, catching both of their come in his spread fingers, mixing it together until you couldn’t tell whose was whose.
“If you’re going to tell me I don’t know you, I’m just going to have to say I disagree,” Steve said, glowering. “Because I do. I know exactly what I need to. And…” The glower transitioned to something much more uncertain. “Whatever I don’t…I can learn?”
There was shouting, and when Tony turned his head he could see Steve knocking Zemo out with a single beautiful punch and then crushing the gun in his bare hands. (Which was kind of hot when Tony thought about it, which he wasn’t doing now clearly because
Even though Zemo was wearing a mask, Tony could tell that he was staring at Steve.
so good, and all the aches that had spread throughout her body were gathering in, now, coiling around in her center, and she was so close,
Steve whimpered—there was no other word for it—but did it, raising his left hand to his chest and rubbing, pinching, squeezing first one nipple, then the other.
“I’m a man who believes in science,” Tony said instead of answering the question. “I don’t know what this is, but it’s nothing that’s ever happened on any of my adventures before. But yes, Steve. I trust you.” He hesitated, then thought it was only fair to let Steve know some of what he’d been thinking. “I don’t know what’s going to happen once we’re back – if we’re able to find your team or not, Steve.”
Tony’s breath fogged in the air as he took an unconscious step forward, his face prickling at the abrupt change of temperature.
was immature, that was nothing compared to this!— he caught a flicker of guilt from his soulmate.  He realized that the guilt was a response to his anger and pushed an apology over the bond.
“They’re going to try to guess.”
It was strange, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility given all the other shit Tony had seen in his adventures. It was just…magic.
and that was all Steve needed to be a little bit brave.  "I thought you might like to watch, maybe."  Steve tilted his head at the screen.  "Either angle."
Steve froze, suddenly going cold, only to be reassured by Tony’s next words.  “You’re better than that, even.  You’re
“If our guns don’t work, we can always just smash them with a rock.”
His cheeks flushed slightly, and Tony cleared his throat, ignoring the amused look Rhodey shot his way. “Maybe. If I didn’t blow their base sky high first.” If he didn’t make sure that they’d never ever turn him into the next Zemo.
"Where are we going?", Wade heard Gwen whisper to Peter.
If you wanna chat or leave some requests for fun, angsty or fluffy one-shots, hit me up on Insta: @dead_cherry_bitch  or Tumblr: dead-cherry-bitch
. There was no denying that he was trying to hurt them, Wade couldn't blame him for that. They respected his wish and left, except for Steve who promised to call if he needed help.
Anyways, I hope you like this chapter and leave a review!
"You're a good dad...", Peter whispered and for the first time let himself lean against his father, let himself have that.
"Then why do you keep going?"
After a few days Kid was almost completely healed up and could walk around the apartment. Bucky was faced with a decision, he didn't really plan this far so now he had no idea what to do next. He had an escaped HYDRA- agent living at his place, how was he supposed to keep that secret? And how was he supposed to explain that to anyone? He spend hours trying to figure out what to do next. In the end he arrived at the conclusion that he should talk to Kid first. So he went back to the bedroom. Kid still spend most of his time in there. He only left it when Bucky told him to. Like it was a prison cell. Bucky didn't like thinking about it that way but he couldn't help it.
"Yeah. Sorry.", Peter sighed before taking another drag of his cigarette, letting his lungs fill with the bitter smoke.
"Something about this doesn't feel right...", Tony mumbled more to himself than anyone else but he was damn right. Something about this felt fishy.
"I could never.", Peter chuckled before pulling out the file and flipping it open. His expression darkened automatically as he started to read through it. Wade was about to say that maybe reading that wasn't the best idea when Peter spoke up again.
Peter couldn't quite believe his ears. He turned the words over in his head again and again, trying to make sense of them."I promise.", Buck y said, his tone genuine and ernest. Peter felt like crying, but he lacked the energy.
"We'll let you sleep then. ", Peter said as he got up, his voice a little too sharp, his departure a little too sudden. Wade didn't stop him though. He just led Peter and MJ back to the door as if Peter wasn't clearly upset.
"Your father?", MJ asked.
"I like to draw people in moments of crisis.", she said with a grin that was neither happy nor bitter. Maybe it was smugness.
Still, I hope you enjoy it and leave a review. The responses I got for the last chapter really blew me away.
"Yeah that'd be nice. "
"I don't know, but if they do we might find out if Peter's okay.", Tony returned.
"I love you.", Wade said and just like that, the truth he hid for months was out.
"No-", Tony gasped out, jumping from his chair. He reached towards Peter but Peter flinched back. Even when he did that, his expression never changed.
"What movie are you seeing?", Bucky asked when Peter took his suitcase to the bathroom to pick out something to wear.
Peter didn't remember how he got to the side of the road, he couldn't remember the nature around him, he couldn't remember what time of day it was or how the weather was. All he registered was the sound of his steps, how he dragged his feet along the concrete. And the
Tony pulled a face before replying:"Yes, but I am recognizing that it isn't actually harmful to you and that it's better than your other coping mechanisms so go on."
He wasn't sure how long his brain checked out but next time he was fully conscious it was silent. No fighting, no screams or gunfire. Somehow he felt worse.
Peter returned his attention to the file but still kept on talking. It might've been the most he'd ever said in one go. "Don't get me wrong. These were awful times as well but...not as awful as the things that followed. They're some of the only remotely pleasant memories I have..."
Tony looked anything but. His father looked like he hadn't slept at all, hair disheveled, face burried in his hands. "Yeah, yeah...", he sighed before looking up again. "I know, just...try to give us as much time as possible. I don't think that he's ready to deal with anyone else. Hell, he isn't even ready to deal with us, not to mention Fury."
"Calm down. We didn't do anything. She's just detained for now.", Natasha replied, crossing her arms, seemingly unmoved by Peter's comments.
"I didn't.", Tony snapped back, clearly irritated as well. "They got to her before we did. We're lucky that we even know about her."
The file. She had read Peter's file and then she told them. She told Tony and Steve what Peter did. That's where the anger came from, he thought. And the disappointment. They knew what he was now. That he wasn't good, that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't be.
"Who are you?", he asked.
Peter looked at his own handwriting on the first page of the notebook. HYDRA had taught them how to write but he never did it much so his writing was so messy that it resembled chicken scratch. He glanced up and out the window. They had been driving for a few hours now and the sun stood high in the sky, beating down on them. He wondered if summer ever came to an end here. He wasn't sure what date it was but it had to be September already. It was still hot. Not extremely, but one would think that it was about time to cool down.
Ever since they got to Bruce' lab the boy was trembling uncontrollably and when Bruce took his samples his breathing got so quick that Bruce asked, if he should stop. But Peter just shook his head frantically, his eyes clenched shut, and told him to get it over with.
"I said I'm not hungry.", Peter stated, not laying a hand on the menu. As if on cue his stomach growled once more and Bucky gave him an unconvinced look. Peter quickly glanced away, almost sheepish and Bucky let out a soft sigh.
Okay, don't panic, this isn't turning into a Peter/MJ thing, I swear this serves a purpose so bare with me!
"I'd just call it a road trip.", Bucky smirked.
The towel was warm from the radiator and soft against his skin. Peter avoided looking at the mirrors in the bathroom once he was done drying himself and instead focused on the bandages. They were stained red and had gotten wet anyways so he pulled them off before looking at his wrists in the bright light of the bathroom. They already looked much better. Still bleeding but it didn't look like a wild animal ripped his skin to shreds anymore.
They didn't drive for long and didn't speak much either. They were both weirdy quiet and Peter could tell that MJ was just as nervous as him. So they just filled the silence with MJ's spotify playlist that was inexplicably called "
A short one today but at least you finally got their first meeting! And because I love pain I'll let you feel it, too!
"What do you mean?", Wade asked instead of Steve because Steve seemed to know, by the look on his face.
For Peter it was anything but casual. Then again, what would happen to him if he didn't cooperate? Did he really want to find out? He found that he was still too tired, too exhausted, too shaken by the dream and the pain that came with it. Even the thought of enduring any form of punishment right now filled him with dread so he didn't even try to protest. "She's a friend of mine.",he replied before wrapping his arms tighter around his legs. He didn't want to talk about Gwen, preferred to not even think of her. It made his heart ache with guilt, shame and loss.
"It's Gwen, your friend, she's alive.", Tony replied, getting right down to it.
That's how Bucky still felt hours after it happened. He was sitting on the floor of the livingroom, staring at the elevator where his fist had left a dent. Everything was quiet, at least it was now. So quiet that Bucky could hear the steps, so still, that he could feel their vibrations through the floor.
Except that he wasn't, not quite. After Wade left, things moved quick. Too quick for Peter. Their conversation left him emotionally drained so he checked out. For once he didn't mind losing time. He embraced it and just let himself float through the day.
"You're a hypocrite, that's what. ", Wade replied. "You're much easier on everyone but yourself."
but their concerns seemed to be unnecessary. He didn't even argue.
"You made a friend."
He could imagine what they'd find in that file. And the thought that Peter grew up like this and that there was no way for them to tell how much
"Don't worry, it's not your fault.", he quickly said and Peter looked marginally calmer. Wade got up to get another wet towel and more bandages from the bathroom. When he returned Peter still sat at the same spot, his eyes tracking Wade carefully.
"Hey, Petey-pie! You requested me?", Wade asked cheerfully. Seeing Peter alive and well still set his heart ablaze.
For a solid week Wade was convinced that he'd never see Spidey again. He had done his deed, returned Peter to his family, fulfilled his
"Your friend, Gwen, did you love her?" Peter was caught off guard by that. It was enough to bring his racing thoughts to a screeching halt.
"Well, in our defense, the only time we caught you flying a jet was when you crashed it, so that doesn't really reassure us in your abilities. ", Wade pointed out.
. With a sigh Wade finally caved in. "But don't say I didn't warn you...", he tried to joke before pulling off his mask revealing his face and head that was completely covered in scar tissue.
"You're not fucked up.", Bucky stated, foolishly, like Peter would accept that.
"Just because she hasn't done anything yet, doesn't mean that she isn't dangerous. ", the woman tried to argue.
"Yeah, he's upstairs twinky-boy.", the other man stated and Peter rolled with his eyes.
"Uhh...yeah, you are- you're my son.", Tony didn't know what else to say, he didn't even know if he himself truly believed the words yet.
MJ let out a dry laugh before noticing the confused expression on Peter's face. "Wait, you're kidding, right?", she asked, looking alarmed now. Great. Peter shook his head slightly and MJ's eyes went even wider. "You don't know what gay people are?"
"Peter, I can imagine that this might feel easier right now but it won't help you in the long run." His words felt useless, like screaming at a wall, or arguing with his boxes, absolutely fruitless. Peter couldn't be reasoned with when he was like this.
"So, are we ready to go?", she asked so Peter made his way over to the passenger seat and got in.
Peter didn't want to disappoint Bucky, didn't want to prove that he couldn't even keep it somewhat together for 24 hours. And it's not like he was completely losing it right now. He just needed to be under the open sky. He wouldn't do anything stupid. So he left the room and then he left the hotel until he found himself at the pool area. Out here he could breathe properly. Out here not every second of living
"I would've rather died than to feel the mess you left me with. I would've killed myself. The only reason I'm still alive is because of my fucking healing factor. Not to say that I haven't tried! And I've been told to stop blaming myself so that's on you now! And if you think that after all this shit, I'd let you anywhere near my friend, you're fucking mistaken.", he spat and when Wade glanced over at Natasha he could see her mask crack ever so slightly, revealing something underneath, something like regret or guilt. Something like horror.
"I don't swim.", Peter replied immediately.
"Peter?"
"Is that all I gotta do to get you to take me out? Say that I crave death?", Peter smirked and Wade's eyebrows shot up.
"Something like that. " Bucky didn't know what that was supposed to mean but he didn't start digging.
"Yes. Yes I am.", Bucky finally admitted.
"What's it like to die? I mean, once you're dead, if you don't mind me asking.", Peter then asked. That was actually a far easier topic, going to the afterlife was like a visit to the dentist. So Wade told Peter about it. About how he felt when he woke up on the other side, how much easier, how much clearer it all was, without the voices, the pain, the darkness. When he was finished Peter let out a smirk. Wade couldn't see his face, he was staring at the ceiling. "What's so funny?", he asked.
now, he could be good all the time if he just got to be
We are still searching but we haven't mentioned it to him yet.", Steve replied.
Anyways,I hope you enjoy this one, there's probably gonna be more fluff for now so tell me if you like it!
"Of course!", MJ exclaimed and relief washed over Peter.
"It has been way too long, dear boy."
"Sort of? Something came up. ", he replied his voice shaky. All of him was shaky, his whole body was trembling.
Wade glanced at Tony. The older man had been burning the candle at both ends since his son took off and it showed. Tony was devastated and just as desperate as Wade, but when they looked at each other Wade knew that they thought the same thing. 'How long could he have survived that way?' Peter was injured when he got out of the wreckage, that was indisputable. The amount of blood he lost should've killed him but he had a healing factor. One that
"Would you believe me, if I told you that you're a good person?", Tony asked and he knew that he had cornered Peter with that.
Suddenly his voice was crystal clear, almost too sharp for Peter, too loud, it hurt his ears. "Hey, listen. Listen! You'll be fine. I've never met Irondad personally but I was about 15 when you disappeared, I remember how the whole shit went down. Your dad pretty much disappeared off the face of the earth with ya. For months he was just gone! I mean, I'm no parent but I love speaking on behalf of people so I'll say that I'm like 87 % sure that he was devastated. He'll be so happy to have you back, you're his golden boy, his special creation-"
Tony Stark jumped up from his spot on the couch the second Wade entered the livingroom. "How is he?", he asked alarmed and something tugged at Wade's heartstrings. It wasn't exactly envy but Wade couldn't help but to wonder how it felt to have parents that actually cared about you.
. He didn't want to think like that but the thoughts still crept back in. He was
A noise suddenly chimed through the jet. Peter couldn't see the controll board from his spot on the floor but he didn't have to wonder what was happening for long.
"It's not like I told you my intentions,  sorry 'bout that. I knew that Tony Stark's son has to be a perceptive one.", Wade smirked, opening the door and stepping outside. He was relieved when Peter did the same, even though his whole body was trembling, he managed to stay on his feet.
you. And believe me when I say that I don't pity you, that I don't think that you're a lost cause or a timebomb. Maybe I'm not in my right mind, no, scratch that, I'm definitely batshit crazy but I know what it's like, okay? Believe me I do. And I am here, Peter. I'm here and I'm not going anywhere."
"What do you want then?", Bucky rephrased the question.
"I will!", Wade exclaimed, getting Peter to smirk as well.
Tony stayed silent for a moment, his eyes tracking Peter. The boy tried to seem calm. He schooled his expression to be a neutral mask but his breathing gave him away. Short, shallow gasps for air that felt like it wouldn't come. "I don't know how to do this...", Tony finally admitted and it was worse than Peter imagined. He didn't even try. Was Peter really so much beyond repair that his own father didn't even want to try to correct all the ways in which Peter was messed up? Really, he couldn't blame him. Who would want to put up with him?
Tony stuffed his hands into his pockets before squinting at the horizon for a moment. "Not a fan of New York?", he then asked in a teasing tone.
"Is that nickname going to stick?", he asked seriously but then Wade chuckled slightly.
. "Peter... what are you doing?", Wade asked and his voice cracked. Peter didn't hear it, he could barely hear Wade's voice over the sound of his own racing heart.
"I'm not HYDRA, I promise, not anymore at least.", Bucky hurried to explain. "You don't remember me, do you?"
"Yeah, good."
To be fair, Tony was looking at him like that, too.
?” Rhodey asked. “Not everyone reads it, but it’s kind of hard to miss, even on the frontlines.”
A faint hue dusted Steve’s cheeks. “Maybe…” He averted his gaze. “I’m glad you’re awake, Tony. When you passed out…your heart
take. He just…always seemed to be able to exceed that and then end up at the brink of death, only to come back through some miracle or another.
Tony toppled slowly over on the bed in front of him, tipping to the side so that both of his hands could work.  His left hand sped, the length of the strokes shortening until he was barely nudging the head of his cock, thumb circling directly over the frenulum as he beat like a hummingbird’s wings.  He gasped Steve’s name—Steve barely managed not to reply—and on the screen, out of Steve’s line of sight once more, Steve’s own voice said,
Steve’s lips thinned. “I suppose I missed it, then.”
). “You’re here now.”
of a “teammate” of his had almost ruined everything— and Thor hadn’t helped!  It was only the fact that there was nowhere for Loki to go that allowed them to take him into custody in the end, and even then, they caught him trying to slink away to civilization.  And if he had managed it,
Steve tested it out.  His muscles were loose and happy as they always were after an orgasm, but his cock and hole were two different stories.  His cock was throbbing around the stopper—not in a bad way, but it was sensitive; he hadn’t twitched his right hand since his orgasm ended—and he was too over-sensitive in the wake of his orgasm to want to do anything with the plug.  “Mostly pretty good,” he decided.  “Maybe not any direct touch for a couple minutes.”
"Oh, you're still- ", Peter started but then his voice broke off once his eyes fell on the item in her hand.
"How are you doing?", Steve dared to ask after a moment of silence and to his surprise Peter actually answered.
"Don't look at me-", he rasped out before an awful sob escaped him, wet and ugly. God, he wanted to dissolve on the spot. "Don't-please- Get out- please?!", he hated himself. Couldn't stand his own begging, couldn't even try to look at Wade's face. He didn't want his horror or disgust, couldn't even handle his own.
"Fuck you...", he whispered  but his heart wasn't in it. His heart was with Peter.
Fury didn't budge, it wasn't a surprise. "Calm down, Stark! You're being overdramatic. This isn't the first time we're doing this and we have him under control." Wade's blood was boiling.
"No, I'd never do that. ", he replied and it sounded genuine but it didn't make sense to Wade.
They had stopped in front of a window that revealed the inside of a plain white cell in which a girl was sitting on a bed, her head leaning against the wall, vacant eyes staring straight ahead at them. It had to be a two-way mirror because she didn't seem to notice them.
gay way? Or
"You mean the registry for supers? What does that have to do with Peter?", Wade asked.
Wade was sitting on the couch next to Peter but with deliberate space between them. He'd been especially twitchy ever since he woke up again. In general Wade felt like Peter was somehow excluding him. It was silly but his boxes made sure to convince him of that. Still, he couldn't help but to feel like Peter was more distant than before, barely talking, deliberately not looking at Wade.
"Answer the question!", Wade demanded and there was an edge to his voice that made Peter comply immediately.
"Take a picture, baby boy, it'll last longer.", Wade smirked, but there was a slight strain in his voice, like he was a little bit on edge. "Wait, no. I'm immortal. I'll probably last longer.", he then added.
Sometimes he wished that his apathy could encompass everything, that he could just stop worrying about everything. Of course that also came with not caring about anything which was something Peter didn't want so he didn't resort to calling up Natasha and asking her if she had some of those psychopaths drugs to spare. Sometimes it was tempting though. Peter was sick of this purgatory that he seemed to be trapped in, where he didn't care about most things but was still conscious enough to notice that that wasn't good while also lacking any motivation to do anything about it. He knew he should care, he knew he didn't.
The two males quickly nodded, eager to respect Peter's wishes and after Tony stood up again the Superdads left the room.
"Depends on when he had his last dose. I think we have a few more hours until withdrawal sets in.", Bucky replied.
But I'm reaching ahead. Right now I want to hear your thoughts on this chapter and what YOU think will happen in these last few chapters! Tell me in the comments!
"Peter, you still with me?", Wade's voice pulled him out of his thoughts and focused his attention back on Wade's worried expression. Peter wanted to believe that Wade actually stayed because he liked him. Obviously he couldn't but Peter still liked to indulge in this fantasy. "Yeah, why?", he lied. Lying came easy to him, much easier than most things, it was almost second nature.
. He was in the gym, sprawled out on a yoga mat, staring at the ceiling. He wasn't sure how long he had been laying here.
Peter didn't wait until Wade allowed him to eat, he just grabbed the first waffle off the stack and stuffed it in his mouth. He couldn't remember the last time he ate real food, HYDRA usually just forced a tube up his nose and fed him through that.
The girl came alive, jumping up from the bed and launching herself into Peter's arms. They held onto each other for dear life, both unwilling to let go, both trembling violently.
"Don't touch me-", he hissed in a frenzy and felt bad the second he saw the hurt in Wade's eyes. He covered it up pretty well but it was still there. "Shit, fuck, I'm sorry...", Peter whinced, covering his face with his hands for a few seconds, trying to take calming breaths. He was so sick of having to explain himself. "I- I'm sorry, it's not you, it's just- I know it's irrational but I have this fear that you're going to dunk my head under water and I can't- it's dumb-", he gasped out, he couldn't stand to look at Wade right now. This was all so pathetic.
"Foster mother.", MJ said, as if it was supposed to clear up anything for Peter. It didn't.
"Gwen and I used to sing."
"Yeah that one. He went missing and I'm worried.", Wade stated, no humor in his voice. Death's hand curled in his hair as she looked up at him, smiling like this wasn't about life or death.
Peter didn't back down though. On the contrary, he pushed himself off the wall and for a second Wade thought he'd crash but instead he landed on his feet perfectly, it was almost elegant and Wade marveled at what good some food and sleep did for Peter. The boy turned his back towards Wade and looked outside instead, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his jeans. Outside, the sun was rising and Wade could now only see Peter's dark silhouette against the pink sky.
"Yeah...", Peter shrugged. "Surprise! I'm not dead, yay me!",he then added with a slightly awkward smile. When Natasha didn't say anything Tony could see the discomfort creep back into Peter's expression. He had his five minutes of levity. "So? You're a friend of Tony's?", he asked awkwardly, even though he probably read dozens of articles about all of the members of the Avengers. Research about what he missed was one of Peter's few hobbies, though Tony wasn't sure if it actually brought him any enjoyment or if Peter was just trying to catch up on lost time. Tony had felt something like that when he returned from Afghanistan. But he had only been gone for three months, not nine years.
Peter had to smirk. Bold was really not a term he'd use to describe himself but if there was a time when he could afford to be reckless, it would be now. He had nothing left to lose.
Peter froze, only for a second and then the boy was on high-alert. "Did you tell him that I'm here?", he asked, his voice controlled, completely ignoring Bucky's question.
"You good, Peter?", Wade asked, trying to ignore how tight his throat felt all of a sudden. Peter nodded slowly, mechanically, before he seemed to snap out of it. Again, a slight headshake, then his eyes met Wade's.
"She showed up at Stark tower looking for you. ", Tony went on and Peter couldn't take this.
"I'm sorry... it won't happen again...", he suddenly whimpered and Wade knew that Peter wasn't talking to him, that in his mind Peter wasn't even here.
With a handful of warm water (he couldn't handle anything else) he washed his face, washed away the blood and vomit and sweat. In a weak attempt to salvage something he tried to brush the mess that he called his hair into some shape before quickly giving up. "You're just sick. You'll get better.", he repeated what Wade told him the other night. It felt hollow. With that he turned around and stepped outside the bathroom again.
, then. Peter could be
He stepped into the dark bedroom, all the curtains were drawn and there was a distressing smell. Sweat and... blood. It took his eyes a second to get used to the dark and another one to locate Peter. Hanging from the ceiling in one corner, not moving at all, predictable. His body was completely curled up and in the dark it was hard to make out body parts, he was just a ball of limbs and messy brown hair.
Peter had never witnessed MJ so upset so he had absolutely no idea what to do. Especially since he didn't even know what he did wrong. "Why? Because I'm a bad kisser?", he asked, unable to hide his growing confusion.
I also changed the chapter number, it won't be more than 56 total. But I also started outlining the first chapters for the sequel, plus, I'm considering doing little one shots and if you want you can request scenarios, fluff, angst, whatever you want to read, just text me either on my instagram which is @dead_cherry_bitch or my Tumblr dead-cherry-bitch.
He was shaking.
this- I-
It was awful, there was no point denying that. Natasha knew first hand what these organizations were like. The red room wasn't much different. And after everything Bucky told them about HYDRA... she wasn't surprised that the kid was messed up.
"Exactly! Would you want some stranger reading about all the horrors you went through? After everything that happened to him? You are a lot of things, Natasha. I never thought of you as cruel."
"He's coming, okay, Tony's on his way, you just gotta hold out for him, okay?", Wade nodded, he reached for Peter's face, cradled it in his hands.
"I don't think you should be alone right now.", Wade admitted, not backing away. Peter could scream and attack him if that's what he felt like doing right now. Wade could handle it as long as Peter didn't turn all his violent potential against himself. He didn't scream. He laughed and Wade wished he'd punch him instead. It was icy and cruel. Peter cackled and turned away from him, making his way back to the window where he came to a halt. It was getting dark by now, the sun disappearing in the ocean, painting the sky red. It looked like blood to Wade. "Of course you think that. I forgot, I can't be trusted. I ruin everything.", Peter said once he finally stopped laughing and this time he sounded bitter.
So Steve took over for him. The receptionist called him when they had another fake-Peter on their hands. Steve would take care of the tests and he'd take care of sending them away once the results came back negative. They always did. Tony didn't need to know,  didn't need to suffer more than he already did.
Still there was no way to tell how he would react, it was a medical procedure after all. The doctor had to remove the tracker and then fill the hollow tooth again. It wasn't even clear, if Peter would agree to that
"You do?", Peter asked surprised, looking over at Wade. He didn't look as nonchalant as he did before, his shoulders looked tense, his jaw tight. Peter knew that feeling.
"Anyways. I wouldn't want anyone catching you without a license but we can work on that if you want.", Tony then suggested carefully, like he feared that Peter would reject him.
(See the end of the chapter for
After their meeting they'd all separate again and Wade would wander the city, searching for something to take his mind off of the bottomless spiral it threatened to tumble down. It never worked, not really. He'd always find himself empty and desperate in the end.
"Are you mocking me?", he asked, pushing himself up again. His tone was as sharp as a blade. Wade could tell that this would be hell.
"I can't promise anything. ", Wade returned, a small smile creeping onto his face. It wasn't all lost, yet.
"No.", he snapped and he didn't dare to look at their faces, screwing his eyes shut instead. "I- I won't fuck off again if that's what- no. I just- I- space. Please.", he stammered before reaching for the door and making his way past Natasha.
For starters, I wanna say that I'm not trying to make Natasha the villain here. I don't consider her actions in this chapter right personally but I hope I did a good job of describing her point of view and why she did what she did. She thinks what she's doing is right.
"No. I can't. ", that was it, cut and dry.
"Nah, we're staying here for now. Get you settled in. ", Peter replied, looking over at Gwen who gave him a quick nod without looking at him. "I think we should get you some clothes first.  We could do that today if you feel up to it.", Peter suggested next, just trying to get a reaction out of Gwen, even if she just told him no.
"Yes please.", Peter replied for the two of them.
In the end it was neither of those, because Tony was better than Peter gave him credit for, and maybe he cared about Peter's well being, even though he didn't allow himself to believe that. Peter couldn't see Tony's face when he said it but he could hear how choked up he was. "Okay... Okay. If that's what he needs than you should do that. But you have to promise me, that you'll watch out for him, that you'll call every day, that if anything goes wrong or if there's even the slightest bit of an inkling that HYDRA is onto you, you'll tell us."
"Yeah.", Peter admitted, not bothering to hide his own surprise at that. Bucky smiled and Peter pretended not to notice.
"Can't you just leave me alone?! Please!", he begged and then he started to sob. He tried to repress the sound, he pressed a hand to his mouth to muffle it but it didn't help. It just made it so much worse.
"Yeah, but I didn't think that you are serious.", he admitted, still holding on to the car and Wade had the suspicion that it was the only thing keeping him upright.
Peter's shoulders sagged with relief. As much as he didn't want anyone around him, he also feared being alone. Another one of those things that were just fucked when it came to him. His hands were still shaking a little when he opened the door of the car and stepped out. Then...he froze. For a moment Peter wasn't sure what he was looking at. He was surrounded by a huge space made of stone that ended in boulders that were thousands of feet high. Like a gigantic gash in the earth's crust and when he looked up...there was the sky, rich dark blue but sprinkled with more stars than he'd ever seen before. Thousands, forming the milky way, illuminating the imposing landscape around them.
Five minutes later they were all gathered around the console of the second jet, all suited up except for Tony who's nano suit sprang into action on command.
"It's okay. You can be honest, I don't mind. I know that I'm an obstacle. No point in denying it.", Peter shrugged.
"Yeah, and they all treat me like one, too. They ask me for my wants and needs and they want to know my opinions and shit and what I'm okay with and what not. Weird isn't it? ", he smirked."You'll have to get used to that, too.", he added, his smirk softening to a gentle smile.
Tony quickly got serious, letting out a short sigh. "Firstly, you're not a difficult person, okay? And second, Wade's definitely into you, alright? That man is whipped for you."
Lorenz explained that they were already able to decondition Peter's association with the words
"I'm not falling for anyone. Just protecting him.", Wade quickly shot back. He didn't think of Peter that way, didn't plan on getting attached.
"Hey!", Wade exclaimed, reaching for his hands to loosen his grip and that turned out to be a bad move. Peter let go of the phone and grabbed Wade's hand, twisting it until his wrist snapped.
"Oh wow, tough shit, kid.", Tony laughed.
"Never heard of Skyrim.", Peter added launching both Wade and MJ into a long-winded explanation of what Skyrim, a videogame that Peter had never heard of, was. Once again he could just lean back and let his nerds run the show. He was content just listening to them.
Is it below my pride to use Deadpool's ability to break the 4th wall to explain my own shortcomings? No. Will I do it again? Maybe.
"Shit. Liar.", he stated, each word punctuated. He shook his head and pointed ahead. "Eyes on the road." Bucky listened to him. They drove like this for a while, in silence, but at least Peter stayed present. He started to rummage through the glove compartment until he pulled out a stack of Cds. "Are these Tony's?", he asked as he looked at each one.
"Because I hate myself. " It was an attempt at a joke. Maybe it was too real but
Tony's eyes glanced over at Wade but the other man only gave him a helpless shrug. "You- We don't expect you to talk about anything that happened... All I'm asking of you is to tell us when something makes you uncomfortable.", Tony tried to rephrase it. He was met with a puzzled expression, narrowed eyes, furrowed eyebrows. He thought of Harley and how Peter waved him off, not seeming genuine at all.
"Of course not.", Peter mumbled before picking up the pack at fishing out the lighter and one of the cigarettes.
"What the fuck is this noise-?", Wade groaned, joining Steve, Tony and Bucky in Tony's workshop. A deafening siren was blaring through the entire house.
"I don't believe you...", he hissed and Death gave him a pitiful look and it was so much worse because she wore Vanessa's face.
Wade had all but forgotten about their fight, he didn't care what Peter had said in anger , not now, not ever.
Doing exactly what Wade said without questioning it. It was disturbing.
Peter flinched violently at the mention of his name and realized that his presence was noticed. He expected anger, disappointment, screaming and braced himself for exactly that. When Tony didn't even make a move towards him, Peter wasn't sure how to react.
He couldn't even remember the woman he supposedly impregnated. That didn't have to mean anything though. Tony's drinking habits were less than stellar at the time.
"You know, Tony, Steve, Wade. What do they want from me?", Peter asked. His face still didn't change but he sounded tired, resigned, like he was
Wade wasn't sure why he was freaking out, Peter had been close to him in the past days, too. They had sat next to each other, close, even if they didn't touch. But Peter was showing no signs of stopping and Wade didn't know what this ment, so he froze, like all the time the last few days.
Peter laid his head back to look at Wade and Wade quickly had to school his expression back to his regular face. "I don't want to die, though. I need you to know that. Not right now." He seemed sincere and it was embarrassing how relived Wade was.
"Peter, wait. We need to-", Bucky started when Peter was almost at the door. Natasha was staring him down and it was too much.
Suddenly everything stopped. Peter felt a needle pierce through the skin of his neck and cold rushed through his veins. Whatever they gave him, it only took minutes to take effect. The fuzziness dispersed, the fog lifted and everything was crystal clear. The white lab, the doctors in white, agents in black, Lorenz smiling. Peter didn't hate her.  He didn't feel anything for her. He didn't feel anything at all. It was weird. It wasn't like he was numb to his feelings, his panic and terror that had been so prevalent only minutes before. It's like they weren't there entirely. Peter was empty. But for the first time he was empty and fully conscious. They lowered the halo and the cold plates pressed against his face, soon the shocks would run through his body, manipulate his brain in whichever way SHIELD saw fit. Peter wasn't afraid. He could get used to this.
"I'm just checking in on you.", Wade replied, leaning in the doorway. Peter stared at him for a moment before getting back into bed.
"One more thing you should know, dead people aren't supposed to be alive, he won't be the same.", she then said and there it was again,  that tone that Wade hated so much. Foreboding and mysterious, like a threat or a warning. But Wade had already come so far, he didn't care for the consequences, he just wanted Peter back.
A single tear had escaped Peter and was now rolling down his cheek. "You're not a person, you're a weapon,-", Keipon told him, a dangerous edge to his voice as he reached for Peter's face, wiping away the tear. "And. Weapons. Don't. Weep.", he spat, accentuating ever single word with a harsh slap to Peter's face. By the end, his face was burning and more hot shameful tears were trailing down Peter's face but he couldn't do anything to stop them, couldn't even hide away.
"Nah... It just felt like... recognition. Like looking in a mirror."
Maybe he was loosing his mind. That was the only logical conclusion there was. That after everything he had been through he was just...damaged beyond repair. Do crazy people know that they are crazy? Do they care. Peter didn't. He knew he should, his concern was purely rational but it was fake, he didn't care, that's why he didn't tell anyone, that's why he didn't do anything about it. He'd rather be insane than in pain.
"Yeah.", Peter nodded before slowly glancing up at Wade, his eyes unsure. "A lot.", he added.
Peter watched him for a while before returning his attention to his suitcase. "Okay.", he said, before continuing to pack, and that was that.
“Yeah.”  Tony smiled up at him.  “Yeah, that’s what it means.”
“So I’ve gathered.” Steve leaned forward, his own hand covering Tony’s where it was touching the repulsor plate. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
The second time, he actually woke up for real, sitting up in bed and glancing around the room for a clock.  There wasn't a display; Steve had never figured out why not, but he knew Tony had some reason for disliking digital clocks beyond their uni-purpose designs, some wreckage caused by the high emotional waters of Tony's past.  Steve had chosen not to push at it, instead asking FRIDAY to monitor for a series of taps he could make against the headboard.  Long, short short, long long, short, and FRIDAY would illuminate the display panel Tony had built into the wall.  It was an easy enough workaround.
“Pull the plug out again and then fuck yourself with it,” Tony told him, “because that’s what I would want to do to you.  With the vibrator.”
A shiver ran through Tony. The skin on the back of his neck prickled; when he closed his eyes, he could almost picture what Steve must have looked like as Captain America. He’d seen the outfit already – ruined and tattered as it was (and now stuffed into a bag while Steve wore some of Rhodey’s and Jarvis’s spare clothes) – and Steve didn’t lose any of his commanding presence even in rather ill-fitting clothes (probably had more what with how the shirts just couldn’t really fit over his broad shoulders and amazing muscles).
It wasn’t just a star, Tony realized as he kept the light trained on it. It was surrounded by what seemed to be circles of color. It was clearly metallic, gleaming in the light in a way that the snow and ice didn’t.
“You don’t even
indulged a kink—a somewhat shameful kink—while you were safely out of the country and couldn’t see it,” he said.
It turns out there's a
“I’m fine,” Tony said. But at a look from Steve he relented and settled back down. He refused to relinquish his grip on Steve’s arm, though. Some things had to be done. “As I was saying,” he continued, “we don’t know that you can’t go home.” Even if he rather thought it was likely Steve was stuck here (fifty years or maybe even a few decades from now it might be a different story but Tony didn’t have the technology here to determine what the hell had happened).
Tony waited for him, but when Steve didn’t manage to come right that second, he went on.  “Once you were all swollen—engorged—and so sensitive after coming, then I would give you a little more.  Small probing jabs of my tongue, followed by those deep, plunging kisses.  You know the kind.  A little bit of suction.  I’d suck your pretty red asshole until you were begging for it.”
Her teeth were getting closer and closer to Gwen’s throat even as Gwen was getting closer to orgasm, and Gwen thrust and thrust again, trying to get there faster.  It came down to the inevitable, though: Tasha’s teeth grazed the column of Gwen’s throat before sinking in on the long, diamond-shaped muscle there, and Gwen climaxed immediately, wild beneath the pressure of Tasha’s hands and body and bite.
Much of the rest of the day was spent doing actual work:  finishing up the paperwork from "Paste-Pot Pete" took most of the morning, and drills with the Avengers were an afternoon well-spent.  Steve had taken a QuinJet from the Tower out to the compound at noon; by seven, he was back, and had to hustle to the shower.  Tony would be home soon.
“He’s alive,” Tony said, switching from the man’s neck to his mouth to see if he could feel him breathing. “Holy shit, he’s alive.”
“I refuse to comment,” Rhodey said. “You have fun with your new bosom buddy.”
Tasha looked briefly irritated.  “Yes, and you aren’t known for any special skills in that arena at all, either,” she snapped, then looked even sicker.
Gwen opened her eyes—when had she closed them?—and looked up through her lashes as much as she could, considering the height difference.  Tasha sighed again, her face softening.
Steve moaned again.  He forced his fingers to release, letting his hand fall, palm up, onto the top of his thigh.
“It’s okay,” Steve said, sounding like it really was (even though it wasn’t because holy shit this wasn’t
This time as he whined, Steve felt his face heating with a blush.
“It rather does,” Rhodey admitted slowly. “A bit flashy, a bit loud… Yeah, that sounds right up your alley, Tony.”
Gwen kissed her again, then looked into her eyes patiently.  “Yes,” she said pointedly.
Oh.  He shook his head.  “Not with the plug,” he managed.  “I did—earlier—before it was in.  Should be good for a while.”  He rubbed the lace over his nipple again and lost some time, remembering he had been saying something only when he was reminded by the sound of Tony’s harsh breathing.  “You can go more than once, right?”
He didn’t become aware of the bond again until he was mid-confrontation with Stark.  He had been planning to check on Doctor Banner first, but Stark caught him in the hallway outside the lab, spinning him aside into what looked like a small meeting room of some kind and, ominously, sealing the door behind them.
Steve sucked gently and swirled his tongue around Tony’s index finger twice, cleaning the last of Tony’s juices from it with his tongue, then let it pop from his mouth.  “You really object?” he asked lazily.
Peter dared to crack a smile and he was going to reply something until he heard Bucky's panicked voice coming from the entrance of the motel. "Peter?!"
I hope you enjoy it!
Peter hated it when he lost time.
Now Natasha's face fell completely. "No...", she whispered and Tony let out a sigh.
"I didn't see you do it before, though.", Peter pointed out. He was sure of that. After all, he used to live with Bucky. A smoking habit would've definitely been something he would've noticed, especially because of the smell.
"Where is she?! What have you done to her?!", he asked sharply, jumping up from his seat and meeting Natasha halfway.
"No, please, can you talk to me, so that I don't spiral?", he asked and he hated how needy he sounded.
"No.", he then said and Wade was so taken aback by the blunt response that he raised his eyebrows in surprise. It was so unlike Peter's usually timid behavior. It reminded him a bit more of how he was like when they first met. He was sharper then, not intelligence wise but in his tone. Not that he was ever particularly snappy, but recently he had really quieted down.
Wade couldn't look at the man, couldn't speak. Peter was gone,
Death had wrapped her arms around her torso like she was shielding herself but she didn't step away when Wade got closer and closer.
"Unfortunate is one way you could call it.", Wade remarked. "I'd pick 'absolutely horrifyingly torturous'."
He led her back to the kitchen. Wade was currently the only one there, eating waffles that were, judging by the smell, freshly made.
"Then we'll have to stop you.", Tony stated and it sounded like a threat. Peter wanted to believe him, he really did but it was difficult. He could never rely on anyone saving him.
'. It didn't feel like a home anymore, maybe it never had, Peter couldn't tell anymore.
"Have you been watching me?", he asked. Could they do that? Watch the others?
"Finish him and we'll meet you at the extraction point. Oh! And love? Draw it out, make him suffer. ",Keipon ordered with a smile before turning his back on Peter.
Steve didn't consider for a second that this boy could really be Peter Stark. That's why, when Bruce announced that the results came back positive, Steve didn't register the words for a long time. It just didn't make sense, none of it.
"She's using herself as leverage.", Bucky stated the obvious and it made Wade's blood curdle.
Stark! Find him!"
Still, Wade couldn't stop his own mind from racing. He never had much control over that anyways. The current topic of discussion between him and his boxes was what Death said earlier.
"Fuck, if I was an evil asshole, what code would I use...", he mumbled under his breath as all of them failed.
"No problem, kid.", Bucky said with a careful smile. Peter didn't return it but he also didn't argue about the nickname again.
"He turned off the tracker of the jet, how did he even know how to do that?", Tony cursed. They had gathered in his workshop, trying to figure out where Peter went.
Right now the Superdads were his point of concern, though. They seemed shaken, and were desperately trying to hide it. Even though they acted all normal Peter seemed to notice it as well.
"Those are just words. Just because you say something doesn't promise that you mean it.", Peter shrugged. The dread was back. It had never left.
Peter knew what she ment, or at least he thought so. The emotions he felt right before his death were still there but the things that came before it, his fear of touch, of disobeying, of being punished, the things that had controlled him for so long were gone. Was that how normal people felt, just generally fine? Would all of his emotions fade like this? "I don't want to forget them though, don't want to forget Wade."
"Yeah...?", Peter asked, his smile turning a bit nervous, like he feared rejection, like Wade could ever say no to Peter.
"Dangerous?", Peter interjected, his tone nasty.
Wade left to go to the bathroom next door and Peter was left by himself. The boy desperately tried to hold on to consciousness but memories flashed before his eyes like fireworks.
There it was again. That stupid thought that just popped up all the fucking time, but especially at a time like this, especially laying there by himself, next to a pool staring up at the sky, all alone, when Wade had been with him the last time. Peter missed him and in this moment he suddenly wished to not be quite as alone.
Could guilt kill you? Could he physically come undone because of what he did? If it was possible than it was a fitting end, to be suffocated by his own regrets. For a while he just waited for the blood to rise in his throat, until he choked on it. Until it was finally over. It didn't come. He wasn't dying, not immediately. So he got up.
They stayed a couple hours, watched a very bad slasher movie that inspired a discussion on why Peter and Wade didn't already become a horror-film-actors-duo.
Wade didn't find the answer to that question, because Peter quickly moved on, seemingly distressed by the topic of conversation.
"You put her in a cell?! Do you people never learn? What else did you do to her? Did you get her hooked on your psychopath drugs already? Fried her brain like HYDRA used to?"
"Really?"
Okay, this one's a doozy. Not gonna lie, it's dark. There is a lot of talk about death, there is mildly graphic selfharm and torture. I marked it with this **
A little later Wade put on some music and went to the kitchen to get them some chimichangas. He returned with two regular plates and one giant portion. That one was for Peter.
It reminded Wade of motels and laying by the pool under the night sky and breathless laughter mixed with tears. But still, it didn't mean that Wade knew what to do now. "Baby boy, if you want me to stop doing all of that, I will. But is this really what you want?"
"Yeah?", Peter shrugged. "I suppose it just didn't have a priority in HYDRA's curriculum.", he added but it sounded off-hand enough that Bucky didn't comment on it.
"Nobody will ever read it besides you, I promise. ", Bucky replied without a second thought.
"Don't-", Death groaned, already annoyed with him but Wade wouldn't let her stop him.
"You don't have to say it, if you don't mean it. ", Peter told him and he really sounded like he expected Wade to just take it back.
Wade knew that Peter had an unhealthy relationship with death, god knows, Wade could relate. He also knew that Peter had tried to kill himself in the past, Peter had told him in the first few days of them meeting. And Peter had a tendency for self harm that they all knew of and had witnessed before. But Wade had never witnessed him trying to kill himself. He had never seen anyone attempt it but himself. When he held Peter on the bathroom as his blood bubbled from his wrist, he just heard Death's rattling laugh in his ear, mocking him. Wade wasn't sure if Peter felt better now. The mood swings were gone, he seemed more like he did before the withdrawal, cold, numb. Bucky said that that was to be expected. The Peter wasn't numb but
Bucky thought about it for a moment. He had been largely convinced that Peter's suicide attempt had been because of the effects of the withdrawal but he still didn't want to risk Peter being by himself. Better safe than sorry and all that. But he had to admit that Peter was doing pretty well lately and that he deserved this.
"I don't understand what you are saying.", Peter stated, shaking his head. Apparently he wasn't aware.
But I'm also really excited for the next one. I miss my boy Wade and there will probably be an appearance of his special skeleton lady-friend soon because I have some bad things planned.
"Just try it, okay? That's all I'm asking.", Bucky said, careful to not let it show that he was dejected by their exchange.
What do you say to that?
All eyes were on him, Karen and MJ were horrified but Bucky just looked surprised. "You saved us!", Karen suddenly called out at the same time as MJ exclaimed:"You got shot!"
"Yeah, because they know that Peter would do anything to keep her alive.", Wade added and he couldn't ban the resentment from his tone any longer. He knew that it wasn't her fault, that Gwen was a victim in this, too, but if she did anything to Peter, he'd...
"What was that about?", she asked, her neutral demeanour back in place. Peter let out a deep sigh, dropping his head into his hands before noticing his cigarette that had gone out by now. He flicked it away before facing MJ again.
"But you don't want to be around me either." He didn't mean to sound so hurt. The last thing he wanted was for Peter to feel bad about taking care of himself. Peter didn't react, he didn't look hurt, his face just as blank as previously. Wade still had to clarify. "I'm not guilt tripping you. I want you to know that if that's the case than that's okay. Whatever you feel comfortable with."
we're the next ones to go. After that it were
"He's on drugs.", Bucky had been the first to talk after they left SHIELD's headquarters.
Peter glanced up at him, his eyes were unfocused, his lips were turning blue. Love was vicious torture and Wade didn't know why he put himself through it over and over again.
Tony didn't look angry, or disappointed. Mostly he looked surprised and a little relieved. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.", Peter said before forcing himself to step out of the shadows.
And every time Peter sent a new picture he sent one back, but he didn't flood him with texts either. It was like physical touch, he let Peter initiate it, let him choose when and how much he wanted. And Wade? He cherished all of it, whatever Peter was willing to give was enough.
Peter let out a heavy sigh. "Gwen is different. It's my fault. I didn't fail to protect her, I literally killed her.",he then said and Wade stopped cutting for a second.
"Wade, what just happened?", Steve asked, gentler than Stark.
Bucky didn't mean to go off on Wade, this wasn't his fault and if he was honest with himself, all that Bucky wanted to do was break Peter out immediately and hide him somewhere neither SHIELD nor HYDRA could find him. But he knew that he'd only move Peter from one prison to another. That it wasn't of any use, not really, not if there were any other options. Wade deflated like a ballon, all the anger fading from his face, making way for misery. "I just... I can't bear to think of him all by himself.", his voice was barely above a whisper and it broke Bucky's heart, apparently there was still something left to break.
"Haven't bit the dust in a while, D.", Wade smirked before looking around a bit. "I like what you've done with the place. You gonna let me ride that rollercoaster or am I not tall enough?", he asked pointing towards the themepark.
"Okay, it's all good, you're all good, you're amazing...", Tony whispered over and over again. His son was safe, alive and in his arms. His baby.
None of that had happened. Peter had woken up and he had been himself, at least that's what it seemed like. That observation hadn't had the calming effect that Tony had hoped for. Because that ment that whatever had changed about Peter, it wasn't obvious, which in turn ment that if anything bad happened because of this, they might not see it coming.
Nepal wasn’t a country he’d been in before, but then Tony hadn’t been to every place on Earth yet. He’d seen a lot, but he hadn’t seen
Tony’s knees gave out.  Steve released him as he tumbled to the floor.  Steve himself was more intact, still upright under his own power, and not at all because he was clinging to the edge of the conference table with his free hand.
Rather confused at the easy acceptance, Tony shot Rhodey one last look before returning his attention to where he should place his feet. They needed to get higher still, and he wasn’t sure he could do it with a heavy backpack strapped on.
Steve tried, but couldn’t choke back the emphatic
He hesitated, chickening out one more time.  Tony raised his eyebrows as he moved towards the seat, and that was what did it:  Tony was still here, Tony was not bothered—it seemed like maybe he was the opposite of bothered—and he was
“It’s cold here, too,” Tony said when Steve didn’t say anything further.
“‘There are more things in heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy,’” Tony murmured.
Gwen nodded.  “I should hope not,” she said.  “If they do, SHIELD has a serious security breach.”
Zemo raised the gun, and this time Tony could hear something like high-pitched humming. He was going to shoot Steve again, who was still looking rather dazed and twitchy from whatever that energy bolt had been.
Tony shook his head, entire focus on the sole contact he had with this mysterious man. Something seemed to pulse under his fingers.

Gwen hummed thoughtfully.  “I do like pointy things,” she mused.

Somehow, Tony suspected even
"Soft," Steve answered.  He felt like he was soaring, flying, as he watched Tony’s face go dark and intent.  "I was surprised—good surprised.  I thought it would scratch."
She let her eyes flick down to Stark’s mouth before bringing them back up again.  “It sounds
“Sure, okay,” Rhodey said dubiously. “Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
Steve drifted for a minute after he came, panting on the bed and thinking of nothing as Tony rested his head against Steve's thighs..  The world was fuzzy and soft on the edges, and Tony's hair was just long enough to curl around Steve's fingers as Steve carded his hands through it, a rhythmic, soothing motion.
Steve goes to an actual craft store to buy the yarn, because he doesn't quite trust the monitors to convey color, and definitely not texture.  He winds up with a simple set of yarns in straightforward colors (along with a dozen notions and a decorative cake mold) and heads home happy.
Steve moaned an agreement.  Fabric rustled behind him.
His asshole was twitching from the change, from being held open so long and then released.  It felt, just as Tony had described, swollen and puffy.
Then he noticed Tony was awake and his entire face
“Tony?” Steve sounded bemused, and he eyed Tony in thinly veiled concern.
“What?”
Her hands were wandering all over, touching and testing and then moving onward again, drifting over Gwen’s too-tight dress and bare legs as lightly as a silk nightgown.  Gwen craved; she wanted
The effect was instantaneous: the crowd screamed and scattered, running probably for the exits but mostly into each other.  The press of bodies became intense, and Gwen started a mental timer.  She would give it no more than a minute before breaking cover and taking charge; there was no excuse for allowing even
“Okay,” Tony said. “Okay,” he repeated, tightening his grip on Steve’s shoulder. “Let’s find out.”
Tony wasn’t psychic, hated anything and everything to do with magic because
Tony inhaled sharply, lips parting, and his hands grasped Steve’s arms, fingers tightening in his shirt sleeves (which were so tightly fitted over Steve’s ridiculous biceps that it was a miracle nothing had torn yet). He pressed back, feeling like this was
magazine, and the man known worldwide over as Iron Man, had seen a great deal of things that most people could never even dream of. And some things that people did.
Tony reached out and took another pump of lube and switched hands, stroking his cock with his left while dipping his right hand behind himself.  Steve had a perfect angle to watch as Tony leaned forward, fingers sliding beneath the loose boxers.  It was easy to see the fabric distorting, marking the progress as Tony reached for his own hole.
Stark smirked.  “You have no idea.  Drink?”
Steve groaned.
His skin was ice cold to the touch, and there was no way that he could be
“An amalgam.  Parts of him are a robot, and then the driver—JARVIS runs him sometimes, other times it's me.”
And the shadows were watching, even if Tony hadn’t come across any legends about the shadows eating people alive here. (Or ever, but he’d been in the game too long to dismiss the possibility entirely.)
“We don’t know that.” Tony reached out to touch him, beginning to shift his legs so he could sit more on his knees—
“Probably a good idea,” Tony agreed, his own voice just as breathless to his ears. “Even if I wish everything was fine.” He swallowed, taking several more breaths and feeling his heart return to a more relaxed rhythm. No one was going to let him do anything strenuous for a while after this, which was a shame since Tony and inactivity did not mix well together (Pepper had an entire book full of incidents, most of which had been contributed by Rhodey).
Steve stiffened, trying to control his breathing which hastened at the sight of Tony’s long, clever fingers wrapping around himself.
“Fuck, Jarvis!” Tony scrambled for the exit, only to be held back by Steve.
“You weren’t supposed to tell me you’re Captain America, were you?”
Tony crouched, barely aware of Rhodey coming up behind him, flashlight in hand.
Steve acknowledged the statement with a nod and a rueful smile. “I was the result.” He gestured with the arm that Tony wasn’t touching (he hadn’t even noticed he’d never let go), hand encompassing his entire (very impressive) body. “I’m still not sure what it did to me beyond the obvious, but clearly it went beyond that since I could survive being frozen in a block of ice.”
clean, but he still kind of didn’t want to just set it on the covers.  Instead, he just held it in his hand as he waited for Tony to continue.
It was completely improbable (not impossible because clearly Tony was seeing it happen with his own eyes). But then…this was vibranium they were talking about…
It wasn’t like Gwen couldn’t spot the difference.  She looked down at her adorable bronze dress and huffed to herself, annoyed at having to be annoyed at anything so cute.  At first, she hadn’t said anything because SHIELD seemed to have some sort of plan in mind for her reintroduction to society.  But at some point along the way, the plan seemed to have gone sideways: Gwen recognized a holding pattern when she saw it.  Now, she was mostly just spooling out enough rope for them to hang themselves on.
Tasha laughed, low and confident.  “Baby,” she said, half tender, half
“Nineteen forty-five?” Steve said it uncertainly, like he wasn’t sure what Tony was expecting of him. He put the remnants of his meal down. “How long has it been?” He sounded faintly terrified, like he expected it to have been decades since he went under.
Tony watched Steve for a moment, seeing no hint of a lie in his face. “Since you know…I should tell you why I was really in that cave. This keeps my heart running, but it’s a temporary stopgap measure. It’s not going to last in the long run. My heart’s only got so much left in it, and I’ve been looking for a cure for years.” His mouth twisted. “I wasn’t really expecting to find anything but then…” He gave Steve a pointed look.
“After all,” a smooth, mocking voice said from the doorway, “he has cost my company an awful lot of money.”
“Sorry?  No, I don’t—do
This cave did seem like an actual cave.
“No, uh…” Tony eyed Steve for a moment longer before shaking his head. “That’s it.”
When she pulled back, it was only far enough to let their noses rub together, breathing in deeply and reveling in the moment.  Tasha smelled like expensive perfume and cheap wine, iron and synthetic oil.  Intoxicating.  Delicious.  A terribly tempting bad idea—but then, Gwen had always been good at running with bad ideas.  She leaned in again bit Tasha’s lush lower lip, not hard, but firmly.  It seemed to wake Tasha up, to send her gasping, groping for Gwen’s hips and hauling the two of them in tightly together.
But soon it didn’t matter, anyway: the armor opened like a mussel shell and Tasha stepped into it.  It rocketed out the hole in the side of the building and up into the sky, Gwen still clasped in its arms.  Somewhere between twenty and thirty thousand feet above the ground, the armor changed course, and between the cold and the gravity and the lack of oxygen, Gwen’s head swam right away.
Once, twice, three times... and then Tony was reaching up, opening the slit in the front of them and pulling his hardening cock through.
“A dress,” Gwen repeated.  She smiled, the winsome, superficial, glass-and-champagne smile she learned with the USO.  “It sounds like a very fancy party, Miss Stark; surely you don’t want me showing up in something SHIELD picked out.”
Miss Stark was tall for a woman but shorter than Gwen.  (Most people were shorter than Gwen.)  She wore her dark hair short and combed away from her face, although one thick lock was trying to straggle into her eyes. Her makeup was both minimal and expert. Her suit—three-piece with boot-cut trousers, charcoal colored and pin-striped with lilac, with a mauve blouse, matching waistcoat, and tie beneath—was cut on long and lean lines, a masculine sort of style even compared to what Gwen had seen of modern dress.  She wore it shockingly well; she gave the impression, instant and strong, that this form was the only possible form she could ever have, the only version of herself to exist in the entire multiverse.  Gwen knew for a fact that this was a lie—she had seen pictures in her briefing packets—and she
“He’s not—” Tony started to say, then cut off when he realized that it felt like a lie. And off in the distance, like a vague whisper, he heard the words

The ice had retreated from the man’s head, so Tony felt relatively comfortable reaching out to tug off the mask that hid most of the man’s features from view. He was even more handsome now, and Tony could see that his hair was blond.
Tony watched him, thumbing his mustache (definitely not an evil villain mustache!) thoughtfully. Well…if there was any time to try go back to his old style…now was probably the best time to do so (no one could yell at him for not adhering to military rules, even if he’d never technically
“Why would I want you?” Zemo sounded like he was considering Steve an idiot. It was a tone Tony was intimately familiar with, as Howard had loved to use it on people he thought too stupid to breathe (or make important decisions. It would be easier to hate Zemo if he didn’t have so many of Tony’s father’s mannerisms). “You have muscles, but anyone can hire a set of those.” He waved a hand towards the minions surrounding them. Some did look rather like they could give Steve a run for his money in the muscles department. One even cracked his knuckles threateningly.
Steve shot back.
“Shouldn’t?” Steve was leaning in. “They already know, don’t they? We haven’t exactly been subtle.”
Just when it seemed like he was about to be done, the pressure around the cock plug became too much.  The ring under the glans stayed in place, but the plug itself swung free, and final stream of jizz, freshly released, poured out into Steve’s hand.
“Damnit!”  Steve didn’t hesitate, though.  He had to rest a moment between pulling his fingers out of his ass and reaching up to spread himself, but he did it.  The air in the room felt cool on his over-heated rim.
(being practically married to electricity to keep his heart pumping was not something he wanted in the long run. Longer run).
“They were the best,” Steve said wistfully. “I don’t want them to think I’m dead.” Left unspoken was the silent
There’d been a few of those. Tony always regretted having to be the one to find them and then make that decision.

actually stagger a step, going sideways until he caught himself on the wood veneer of the conference table and brought himself back upright.  His momentum was gone, his ire burned away by shock. His blood, already pumping fast from fury, heated even hotter and charged in a new direction.
So why did he feel like there was something in the mountains here? A nagging, prickling feeling at the back of his neck, at the back of his mind, poking and prodding him even though there was nothing there for him to see.

“...You have dried come in your hair.”
Like someone had decided to fuck it and kick him right there with extreme prejudice.
This wasn’t exactly what he had been expecting to come home to...
“Exactly.” Tony pulled his hand away from the ice, wiping the water off on his pants. He didn’t put the glove back on just yet, watching trickles of water run off the ice and to the ground. He turned off his flashlight, wanting to spare the battery since Rhodey had taken his own out now.
“You said you were fighting HYDRA,” Tony said, “but you don’t remember how you got in that cave or what happened. But do you remember
Tasha froze, eyes going wide.  “What?”
at the touch, bucking hard, but Tasha had her shoulders pinned well, and Gwen’s self-restraint, practiced so often that it was automatic, kept her from throwing her off, thank goodness.  Tasha’s mouth was like heaven and hell on her breast, licking and nipping roughly, a feeling so good it was agony, too intense but
Tony’s heart was still at full charge. Unless something terribly drastic happened, he should be good for the next week. He wasn’t planning on being out here for a week.
“Just reach back and pinch it.  Either cheek, don’t be gentle.”
It was an instinct deeper than blood, one that Tony didn’t even realize he’d had until it was shoved directly into his face. Ignoring the sharp pain in his knee, Tony
“You don’t know how you came in here?” Tony asked again, just to be sure.
Tony swallowed, Steve’s hand over his so very warm. “What’s that?”
He was halfway through sucking it off his fingers before he remembered to look at Tony.  Tony’s head was tipped to the side, the hand not on his dick stroking steadily behind his balls.  Steve didn’t quite have a good enough angle to see what he was doing, but he could guess.
“Yeah, well Iron Man only attacks targets that are involved in illicit deals; he only
"You're a shit liar.", Peter stated with a smirk at which Bucky only shrugged in a 'so what?' sort of way. As strange as it was,
"What? No. You're not going anywhere until you tell me why you're running away."
"So?", Peter asked, in all seriousness, as if that wasn't an awful thing to say, as if he wasn't breaking Wade's heart.
"SHUT UP!", he screamed, completely erratic.
Bucky froze for a second before glancing up at them. Peter took the opportunity to take the jacket from him , still pressing it to the wound but slowly lowering himself to the ground.
"Don't touch me.", he stated, matter of fact, his voice like steel. Then his eyes wandered to the rest of the group, lingering on them for a second before returning to Tony. "And don't bother coming back. I'll see you when they're done with me."
"Don't be. I don't blame you. Just, maybe don't do it again?", he suggested with an awkward shrug which actually got Peter to crack the tiniest of smiles.
"And until then?", Peter asked and there was something in his tone and in the way he worked his jaw, he seemed defiant, almost challenging. Or like he was preparing himself for something.
"Don't you want to live?!", she asked, digging her nails into Peter's face as she shook his head.
She was sorry. It didn't matter. Sorry wouldn't bring Peter back.
He could've told him, it was tempting to just let it out. But Wade knew how selfish it would be to put his feelings on him, when Peter could barely handle his own mind. Additionally, Wade was also scared that if he ever told him how he felt, Peter would feel obligated to return his feelings in some way. He had a tendecy to do what people wanted, even if it made him really uncomfortable. Wade couldn't put either of them through that.
Peter tried to snap out of it, tried to think of something else. But all he could think of was Keipon, forcing his head under water until he passed out. He tried and tried, until...
"Do you really expect me to believe your story?", Peter then asked. His voice was monotone, Wade couldn't see his face, had no idea what he was thinking.
"And how? Send me to some fucking lab where they take my brain apart?! I can't, Bucky. I can't go back. Please don't make me go back." He was crying by then, it pulled at Bucky's heart, made his throat tight, all this pain and fear that he knew so intimately made it hard to breathe, to keep a clear head in this.
Peter didn't wait on an answer, though. "I want to try it, though.", he stated and suddenly the wall was gone and Peter was coming closer, step by step.
"Gwen is currently located in Peter's bedroom and Peter is on the rooftop.", FRIDAY's pleasant voice replied.
"I need you.", Peter said, Wade liked it when Peter needed him. He stepped closer because Wade liked it when Peter was close to him. He reached out and touched his chest because Wade liked Peter best when he touched Wade and could be touched by him.
Once Peter woke up again it took him a minute to remember where he was and what was happening. His headache really wasn't helping either. He might've been concussed, judging by the dizziness and nausea. Peter was slumped on a seat in the quinjet, Gwen beside him, piloting the jet as they flew through the sky.
how Tony flinched beside him at the sight of his face. Wade focused all his attention on Peter instead. "Peter, look at me. You're okay. You aren't with HYDRA anymore, remember?", he pleaded with Peter and slowly his eyes cleared up and focused on Wade.
Wade wanted to scream at her, he wanted to call her selfish and cruel, but he didn't. Instead he realized the thing that might help him to get Peter back. Death was in love with him, or at least as close to love as literal death could get. She was jealous of his human relationships, she wanted him to keep on coming back to her. Maybe they could find an agreement based on that.
"Eventually he'll be fine."
Peter wasn't in bed anymore when Wade entered the room. He had crawled into on corner of the ceiling and was staring down at Wade now, with narrowed eyes.
"Sorry, you don't need to swim if-" The voice sounded distant, his vision blurred. He felt like he was under water, like he was drowning over and over again.
"I can't be what you want. You might not see that right now because you think that having me back is some kind of miracle. Soon you'll realize that I'm- I'm a burden at best and a catastrophe at worst. Nothing good can come out of this and I can't let you make me believe that I can be anything more than this. The inevitable disappointment would destroy me. "
"Tomorrow. I have some things to take care of first. You should watch him in the meantime. But don't crowd him, maybe just one person at a time. I wouldn't expect any emotional responses out of him. The withdrawal leaves you...drained. He might not even talk. But don't leave him alone, okay?", Bucky instructed and Peter didn't even mind that they were talking about him like he was a spooked animal. Maybe he was.
Natasha smiled and Tony knew that she was genuine. "Definitely. She's amazing. They both are. The things these kids went through... I thought the Red Room had messed me up but HYDRA is a completely different beast. And somehow...", Her voice trailed off but Tony knew what she was talking about.
Then he told him that he could leave the table. Not because Tony wanted him to leave but because he was 97% sure that Peter wouldn't move an inch, if not ordered to do so, no matter what Peter wanted. Tony felt like a handler, not a father and he was disgusted with himself.
Steve's eyes wandered over to Wade who had folded up the bottom of his mask to reveal his mouth to enable him to eat. The skin around his mouth and his jaw was covered in scar tissue. "You can take the mask off if it's more comfortable, by the way.", Steve than suggested and Wade glanced over at him.
MJ glared at him for a long moment before getting up from her seat and grabbing Peter's sweater that she then threw at his face.
"I thought we weren't supposed to kinkshame?"
Tony didn’t say anything beyond humming slightly in acknowledgement. The back of his neck prickled uncomfortably, but there was nothing unusual here. Even if he did sometimes feel like there were eyes in the shadows.
“Sooner or later, they’re going to claim you’re a prostitute.”
“What’s it made out of? The metal’s nothing I’ve seen before.”
“You were going to come on me,” Steve reminded him.
for whatever you're doing, like the project just wouldn't be right without them.
“It lines up too cleanly with your goals—your
“Well, this guy calls me Rhodey,” Rhodey said, sighing. “It’s Rhodes – James Rhodes.”
Taking the flashlight Rhodey handed him, Tony turned it on and pointed it into the darkness to get a better idea of what they were in for. There really wasn’t much to see beyond the fact that there was indeed solid ground a good dozen feet below them. The cave went on further, but the light of the flashlight didn’t go that far.
Steve?  Are you serious about this?"
“Now there’s a nice thought.”
Tasha’s knees buckled and she sagged against Gwen’s hold.  Slowly, Gwen lowered her down to the floor, wrapping her in her arms and rolling them, pinning Tasha to the wall with a knee flung over her just in time: it took Tasha a minute to regain her sensibility after her climax, but once she did, she tensed into rigidness, lying stiffly in Gwen’s grasp.
The cuffs, she discovered, were large ones, almost an inch thick and most of a foot long.  Even her fingers were pinned, spread out with bars of metal between them.  She was still wearing Stark’s jewelry, and she snorted aloud to herself at the sight.
Then he stood outside and proceeded to freak out. Silently.
it been for...?
She met Stark’s eyes as she unzipped the dress, letting it slip down to her waist where it stuck—quite predictably, given how tight it was.  She didn’t break eye contact as she changed into the bra, either, and she got to see the exact moment when Stark’s eyes dropped to her chest, darkening hungrily.  Gwen couldn’t blame her, really; she did have a
Tony let the backpack drop once he was close enough and pulled out some rope and their camping supplies. The latter he started stashing behind some rocks.
Steve’s breath hitched, his eyes closed, and he drifted forward to press his forehead to Tony’s. “I don’t want to be lost again,” he whispered.
“...Oh, God.”
the mirror before he turned.
hit a little too close to home.  Steve flashed back to half a dozen entitled assholes who had tried their damnedest to grind him into the dust and saw red.  He reached out and jerked Stark towards him, looking down, his jaw clenching with righteous fire—
Steve caught the mental image of himself:  splayed out on the conference table, legs spread wide where he sat on the edge, his weight back on his hands as Stark’s dark fingers curled around his cock.  His face, he could see, was ecstatic. His mouth was open, lips pink and trembling.
close, now, he realized.  His mouth fell open.  “Please, Tony—tell me I can come...”
“Tony—”
“Yeah,” she repeated.  “That is... amazing.  Thank you for that.”
"Yeah.  Can you move it to the side enough to get at your—?  Yeah, like that.  Flick 'em, get 'em nice and hard for me."
“Yes.” Steve watched him with bright eyes, a small smile pulling at his lips and lightening his whole face. “You feel it, too, right?”
Of course Rhodey had noticed. Tony didn’t know why he’d expected anything different.
“Like that," Tony said, collapsing into a more comfortable position and opening his buckle immediately.  "Just—oh god, this is—yes—oh, hey, lube under the chair, nice—run your hand down your chest.  How does the lace feel?"
