Finally, John planted his foot and wrenched out of Sherlock’s grasp and turned away, pacing up the road and back. “What…”
John was a bit surprised to hear the young voice of Mads. He hadn’t thought anyone else was human in here. “Yeah, Captain Watson. I’ve been out a while. What’s happened?”
“Moran.” He greeted back, voice dripping with distaste behind the hoarseness.
John frowned. “Well I’m not doing that.” He looked off to the side.
cross with me, told me to turn back and never show anyone, ever again. To never talk about it. She was older, even though she isn't a Shifter, she understood the danger better than I did. I didn't take her
Sherlock was perched atop the lounger, with his arse settled on the back and his feet curled on the seat. He was balancing the paper pad provided for letter writing on his knee, and was already tearing off another sheet. “Yes.”
dangers, John! But denying the change in your life is denying the other dangers we need to handle now! If you took it as seriously, this wouldn’t keep happening. Wake up! You didn’t want to be a part of this, too bad! It’s happening!”
Chuckling, Kar shook her head. “Yeah. Getting a straight answer without a trade is very unlikely. Even then, they mostly enjoy riddles.”
“Hm.” Faas looked past John, out his window, thoughtfully. “Wonder what they’ll have to say about glowing. Not strictly forbidden, I’d think, but with those’n-”
“Ataem. It is the Fari language, as is Heira. Ataem is one like us, but not us.
Please still go read Part Two as it comes up. Should be posting chapter one within a day or two.
After a moment for the two of them to process that, Faas burst out laughing. “Pfft, is that what you meant?”
“It shouldn’t matter! The Cursed aren’t welcome here! Leave them out for the slavers!”
“That was when you’d still believe that sort of thing.”
“No.” Mycroft drawled, looking as if he runneth over with spite.
Left with an unfamiliar and unsure feeling, Sherlock backed up and allowed himself to be shut out, the door locking audibly. He stood there, trying to think, until he heard the water turn on. Then he rounded back into the flat, hung his coat on the hook where it lived when not on his person, and went into his bedroom.
“You idiot… she told you clearly not to go out there when it’s light out.” John sighed, still pulling Sherlock along behind him. He wasn’t resisting, but he wasn’t keeping up properly either. “You’re damn lucky that’s the worst that happened.”
She ripped the fur lining out of the collar of her coat, the speckles of an entire pelt of some sort of cat. She threw it over her head, the paws wrapping around her neck, and the pelt melded into her.
“But he didn’t ask me anything.” Kirsty pointed out, frowning at him as she bit into her apple. “He’s here to find my rabbit, isn’t he?”
"Because, brother dear, the folk around here do not like technology. When we get back to London, you’re going right back into hospital.”
“Yeah… they only hurt Faas and you.”
” John grabbed Sherlock by the collar and pulled him in, which stunned the detective into silence. “No.” He hissed, his voice leveled and dark, a warning left from time as a soldier. “If you dare do something so fucking
’, as John described it.
“Mo…” He managed to force out as Sherlock settled for just helping him stand and putting his arm over his shoulders.
“I’d say that’s proof enough.”
“All else aside, you haven't even been looking to date since before we went to the moors.” Sherlock's playing slowed and transitioned into long, soothing tones. “Curious.”
The elder Holmes put his hackles up, but nodded. With some sense it was forced, he slowly spoke. “I’m sorry.”
little twerp from overseas come in here and tell me my business!”
He surmised, though the boy was at least 18 and could pass for older if he didn’t act so energetically. He also noticed something in John he found he liked… a gentle hand, perhaps? Or the fact he hadn't nearly as much color in his cheeks or vivacity in his demeanor for a long while...
Bluebell groaned and let her hand come back from her hair to cover her eyes.
Sherlock grinned and linked his fingers. “Ireland.”
When John slumped into 221B, sluggish with the desire to get a good night’s rest in his own bed before running off on their huge search, he was unpleasantly surprised that Mrs Hudson wasn’t the first face he saw when he got in the door.
Bluebell eyed the door. “We’re not getting the others, not just now. There’s just no way with the risks and what we have available to us.” She looked at John, who’d already begun to protest, but Sherlock cut him off first.
He noticed Bluebell’s face sour in his peripherals, but kept his attention on the girl. “You want me to come with you.” She said sardonically. He ignored her.
It was the first time John had seen him as human, and he could tell why the not-so-rare Shift was taken; sparkling ice blue eyes, hair white as the face and ruff of the cat he had been, skin a deep tan… he was hardly ordinary now. He was beautiful. John scowled at the thought… whoever wanted him was likely a disgusting creature who’d lay hands on him. He looked barely 18.
“Do you live in Europe? How is it you’ve never heard an authentic French accent before?”
Something else could, though.
; I stopped. They netted the elk as well, but before I could even move… there was Harry. She’d tossed my clothes at me, grabbed me back… I dunno why, but I shift- shedded. Changed back. By the time the men saw us, we were
John smirked and tossed Sherlock’s coat at him. “There’s something for you in the pocket.” He said offhand, going to the case and getting out his own clothes. “I’m having a shower. This entire thing has made me feel gross.”
“Of course I did.”
on you and everyone just acts like it’s
“Sherlock…” John rubbed his temples wearily. “Why haven’t we been tracking them? We’ve been home for a week already.”
“What it looks like. Probably tuned into fire.” She watched it as well. “Don’t shift. Shifter magic is an odd thing, neither human nor fae. It doesn’t seem to know what we are yet.”
like them. Why risk this at all? Why not get Mycroft to begin with?” He asked, eyes cold, daring the detective to… to what? Sherlock couldn’t quite grasp…
Mycroft seemingly had nothing to say, blinking with a twinge of surprise on his face.
you and I were connected in a deeper sense and you would not turn me away.”
“Yeah,” John agreed, smiling, “moreso than usual. Other than that, we could use someone watching imports, updates on underground deals involving things from other countries in the UK. With things as they are, using the homeless network isn’t-”
Trekking over the Irish countryside was a little harder than John had anticipated, the feeling of the alder cane Sherlock had given him after they landed strange in his hands. He couldn’t adjust the height of the solid wood, but Sherlock had measured it properly for at least flat ground, and insisted his would be safer than aluminium. They’d left their phones in an airport locker, along with anything else higher tech than the compass Sherlock had with him.
“Left behind. You’ve already told me. You think I will leave you behind, or not allow you to work with me. But even if you can’t follow me, there are things you can do to be part of my work. I can’t do it, not nearly as well, without you. ‘Incandescent’, I believe was the term I used before.”
Hey look, I'm not dead!
John looked at Sherlock carefully. Above the sliding bow, his piercing eyes met John’s vehemently. “You’ve never asked me why I’m a doctor, or why I joined the army.”
Sherlock blinked and looked down at her, then walked within a couple feet of her and crouched down. He’d seen John interact with children this way, and they seemed to be less prone to high volumes afterward. “Yes, Kirsty, I have taken your case. I promise to return Bluebell to you. But I’m going to need Miss Grant to help me. Will you lend her to me for a bit?”
“Leave?” John asked fretfully, a few paces behind. His hand pressed firmly against Sherlock’s cheek. “Why…” Ah, there it was. The realization. The proverbial shoe. “Because you’re cursed.”
Compared to the nine odd hours from Baker Street to the continent the week previous, a three hour flight to the tiny island of Grimsey in Iceland was nothing. Even if the silence pervaded until they walked out into the cool sea air.
It has come to my attention that my use of the wendigo is very possibly appropriation of Native lore/spiritualism. I’m a white person. So until I can assess this and either get a person who knows better to sign off, or I fix it or replace it... this chapter will be down, as well as any other mentioning this creature.
“The question is how are they controlling it…”
“I’ve never seen a shift like that.” John spoke softly, with deep concern. “It looked as if your body didn’t know what to do. Jesus…” Now that they were somewhere safe, John took a good hard look at the animal Sherlock had become, but he couldn’t place it. “... what are you?”
“Here, it says when he was arrested, he admitted he deserved to be. But then he also says he’s innocent.”
“Ah. That would be Keya, a spirit of protection in our lands. We often give talismans of the turtle to our children.” Kar answered distractedly.
Bluebell was made to feel a little better as she sunk into her seat across from Sherlock, barely ruffled while the detective was flushed and catching his breath. Being a rabbit-shift had advantages.
John stopped, Something was wrong. He couldn’t think, everything was lulling and foggy. If he really tried, he could still feel the stiffness of his wounded leg, so he let his hand rest directly over the place the bullet had torn through and
“But she is unaware you used to be her pet.”

“What? Don’t we need to follow them?”
“Sorry?”
arms and face above him. But leaning away, the attacker didn’t support him, and the sharpness in him slid out as he fell.
“Neither is the Yard.” She replied calmly, though even she looked unimpressed by his ignorance. “The call came from London. All he wants is access, he’s not taking over the case.”
“I’d watch what I was saying more carefully if I were you, Mr Blythe.” John huffed, looking down on him. “You’re tied up on the floor.”
“You…” He gripped her collar with both hands, though it tugged at his cast and his arm, and raised her. Her eyes cleared, he knew she could understand. “God help you, if you’d killed John,
Then there was a loud bang from outside that made them both start, their faces losing all mirth.
Turning from laughter to a wicked grin, John hoisted Sherlock under the arms and held him up. He was dense, but John was strong. Only the fluffy tail grazed the floor. “This could be useful.”
As Sherlock watched them closely, he found he didn’t have the hissing tug in his gut that often followed people being that close to John. The only times it was completely absent was with people he trusted, or children.
“Yes, yes. No need for another outburst.” Mycroft sighed, giving John an unappreciative side-look. Then he was off at very much his own pace down the stairs.
“Thank you for watching over her.” He removed his hand and opened his bedside drawer to retrieve a pair of surgical gloves. “I can take it from here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Trying ta shake things up? Find buttons ta push, sait his curiosity… That sorta stuff.” Faas sank into a cross-legged position on the floor and leaned back against Bluebell’s chair. He pulled his legs to his chest and held them there, resting his chin on his knee. “She okay?”
“Did it interact with the caster?”
Trigger warning: reference to off-screen gore.
Mycroft tapped his fingers on the smooth hard wood and considered his options.
By the time he was satisfied by his investigations, even if he had to sit and wait to turn back in lieu of dragging his clothes around again, Sherlock had a fair picture of the events. He used this time to mull over the collection of facts he’d gathered both here and from other sources. The victim supposedly referenced ‘a rat’ in his dying moments, but there was no indication one had been there or at all involved. Even if it were a Shifter (the scent he’d learned to attribute to them lingered there), rats were much too small to be anyone’s Shift. It seemed unlikely, in addition, the more colloquial meaning was behind it. It was much too archaic, unlikely to be used as a last ditch communication. No. But he was more certain than before that the son was innocent.
John took a very deep breath, knowing he should ignore it and not engage. But he also knew, from the first ridiculous request he’d performed for Sherlock (come back across London to send a text because I can’t be arsed to get up), that he’d never do that. He turned around to stand in the living room doorway, leaning heavily on his cane due more to fatigue than pain. “How d’you figure that? We had to leave ours in an airport locker just to go somewhere we wanted to
“Is that John?” Bluebell kept her voice casual, but she knew with certainty it was.
“You didn’t even know which twin she was.”
John turned his gaze up in surprise. He hadn’t seen the figure above them; a pale man, medium build from what John could see, with his greyish hair either cropped oddly or just hanging at a weird angle as he looked down. He had a more subtle accent than the woman’s; a French one. He flicked the ashes off his cigarette down towards John, though it was entirely an empty gesture with the wind as it was.
John waited, willing himself not to think anything of it. Not right now.
“Not forever.” She tried to push off the ground with her powerful legs, the assailant was already off balance from bending awkwardly, due to her height. “Just until I can fucking tell what it
Giving a curt nod to him, the woman offered her hand. “And I am Cennerous, of the Theluji clan, and emissary for my people.”
“It doesn’t matter. I took the case. I’m nearly
After a moment of John staring back and trying to think of some reply, anything, Sherlock tsked and narrowed his eyes. “I do not enjoy being distracted on a case. And I
“I’m a paranormal expert.” Bluebell announced confidently, chin up, head tilted a little to give her tiny form an intimidating aura. “A skeptic.” She added at Lestrade’s wrinkling of his brow. “Now are you going to allow me to do my job, or do I have to go over your head? After the myriad of regulations you toss aside for your other consultant, it would not be hard.”
“I do not.”
Mycroft cleared his throat. “Very well, I shall begin then.” He looked sidelong at John and frowned politely, if that's possible. “I am privy to certain knowledge pertaining to the therianthrope community, knowledge neither of your have access to. A pertinent example is what occurs when one such creature denies it’s nature overlong. Doctor Watson seemed to be an exception, but since recent events involving his exposure to the other side, I am no longer confident of that.” He looked at John. “In layman’s terms, I don’t trust you can stay in this form indefinitely anymore, nor that you’re able to control yourself once changed.”
“Hm. You give me far too much credit, it seems. It would appear we have quite a pest problem. More than, I admit, even I was previously aware. Likely the crew were standing by as soon as the base here began researching something very different than their reports would lead you to ascertain.”
Sherlock frowned more deeply. This was not her at all, nor, in this moment, was he confident she would ever be again. He forced his mind to block out the mirrored image of himself, years past.
“Yes, good.” Sherlock nodded to spur her on. “And…”
“Sherlock, it’s fine.” John stood and faced him. “I get it. I’m just…” He pushed his hair back from his face. It’d been too long since he cut it, though it was by no means very long. “I can’t handle this as well as I should, sometimes. I didn’t expect her to be the first one, there’s no reason why I didn’t, but. Jesus, Sherlock, she’s just a kid.”
. She’s
John watched him walk past and out, unilaterally finishing their discussion, then looked back at the bed.
“Nope.”
“Doubtful.” Sherlock finally interjected. His gaze was harshly trained on the compound ahead of them, which the headlights had just illuminated.
John should not have underestimated Sherlock Holmes.
He had a leisurely walk back, the inklings of a sunrise teasing the horizon as he came finally to the Shifter village.
John however wore something you might see in a Cher video. Leather pants, a set of black belts crisscrossed and attached together with a metal ring across his chest, and a thick black collar. The band over his stomach made him wish he hadn’t gained back so
“Why yes, that seems to be the case.” John deepened his frown. “How is this different from the week you slept in my bed? I won’t be using it.”
John huffed, leaving the guard he’d knocked the breath out of for Sherlock to deal with and stepping forward. The dark circles around his eyes and gaunt figure, now he was wearing something reasonable, only served to add menace to his visage. “Let her go, now, or I will break your arm.”
“Look at me.”
“Kelley Blythe?” Sherlock drawled as he surfaced, now carrying his laptop. He walked to the far side of the staircase to access the dumbwaiter, withdrawing a dusty bottle of wine. “Unlatch the collar, if you please.”
“You’ve avoided the subject until you felt safe and vulnerable, just like with magic. And you’ve told me you feel guilty about that in many ways. Should I list them off?”
“Sherlock…” John huffed. He sat on his haunches in front of Strel. “Did you sl-”
“You can’t draw conclusions like that without significantly more reliable data.” The deep voice from where it hadn’t moved croaked a little, sounding disapproving and disappointed.
Sherlock followed her gaze and hiked up his scarf against the cold. “That’s entirely up to her.” He said, voice as chilly as the weather. Then he went around, told the driver “Baker Street.” and got in.
-Sherlock convinces Bluebell to come with him to find John
“The next time a Neighbor asks you to follow them into the Faerie realm, ask them if a human can go.”
“Microscope, at the very least, mass spectrometer, benchtop centrifuge, a computer with more processing power than John’s laptop would be remarkable….”
John smiled, a little surprised there wasn’t more push back. “You told me the one about giving your full name, I know they don’t like iron, salt or bread. I know not to walk into a fairy ring and what one of those looks like. And from what I’ve seen, I know what gnomes and sylphs look like.”
“Better, then?”
“Mycroft!” Sherlock reappeared, empty handed, and stalked up to glare point blank. “Just tell us the markers you're taking, I'll hand over the artifact, and you can scurry out of here.”
The rabbit-shift turned to look at him, her hand still supporting Kirsty’s foot steadily. She sighed, unimpressed, as Sherlock looked at her from across the yard. His collar was up, his coat pushed out like a cape in the wind.
Sherlock found himself a little impressed, despite himself. John must be rubbing off on him. "Very well, then. Why don’t you tell me why you’re living in this house, as a human, and where Dr Stapleton has gone.”
Sherlock had yet to release John, who was now still. His muscles were tensed and ready, but he didn't realize the emitter was off. There were two reasons the detective kept his hold; to keep still and unnoticed while he worked out their escape, and the other was floating in the back of his mind. He wasn't entirely clear on it, he'd have to come back to it later…
“Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson rushed out towards him from her flat at the back of the front hall. “You were out of hospital two days ago, where have you been? I’ve been trying to reach you!”
, Sherlock.”
’ He thought fiercely. ‘
“Damn it Harriet you always throw this bollocks in my face! I’m a bloody adult, I can take care of myself!”
“Not my mother…”
Sorry this took so long, and I won't be posting at all this weekend as I will be volunteering out of town. I'll try to post the next chapter tomorrow, but if I can't, I promise to have one up on Tuesday.
He could hear another struggle nearby, voices echoing and ringing. But he could make it out. The twins were resisting, and a handler threatened them.
After glancing over the article quickly, a son was arrested on suspicion of killing his father, John smirked and huffed a breath out his nose. “That’s pretty suspicious right there, isn’t it.” But when he looked up at his detective for confirmation, his smile faded into a quizzical look. Sherlock had on his smuggest of grins. “On the contrary, actually. That indeed was what led me to doubt his guilt altogether. It isn’t a far leap to feel guilt and shame when you’ve just been quarrelling with family before they die. Thinking he’s deserving of punishment, though not for the crime with which he’s being charged… he is either an innocent man, or one with prodigious self-restraint and control.”
I hope this somewhat makes up for yesterday's very short chapter. I now have 20 chapters planned. I do not promise I'll update daily, I will just write as I can and post when it's ready.
"Ever been?"
“They are, it’s imperative you don’t give them or any other fae your or my full names.”
John finally let Sherlock go, a terrible dread overcoming him.
“She can’t come with us, there’s some sort of tracker. If she leaves the immediate area, the collar goes off.”
She slapped him, hard. He stopped to glare, huffing his breaths with dark circles under his eyes.
The girls, whom John now strongly suspected were twins at the sight of their identical features, were the first to turn back to him. One eyed him warily, while the other came right up to him. John looked down at her and blinked.
“What is it?”
John took in the surreal sight, even as a small lizard-like fae creature climbed up to his shoulder. “Um.” He looked apprehensively at Sherlock. He’d never spoken to anything fae before except the sylphs that had nearly led him away to god knows where. Sherlock nodded, so he cleared his throat and tried anyway. “Is that a name, ‘Heira’?”
Hot, cold, numb… these changed randomly, shooting through Bluebell’s diminutive form as she shook, almost rattling, in a ball under several thick comforters in the upper bedroom of 221B. Concealing her from Mycroft was moot and it was no longer safe to leave her by herself. No one would admit it out loud, and in some cases not even in their head, but John didn’t use his own bed anymore anyway. Besides, his medical tools were in there, and therefore close at hand for her.
“There are times I think I don’t give you enough credit.”
At one point, someone had tried to pet John and Sherlock backhanded them hard enough to send them spinning to the floor, but that was expected to happen at least once, according to the guests around them.
But, maybe because his resolve was no longer needed or maybe because of simply coincidence, Sherlock shifted so quickly he ended up a couple inches off the floor and fell to it on paws and tail with a low, dull thud. He looked pitiful in that moment, still holding the throw with one paw and gazing upwards.
“You could have asked, you know.”
The cat blinked and sat up on the branch it was perched upon.

The detective opened their room and went to their suitcase as John tucked the sleeping Shifter into bed. She looked so small on the queen sized mattress.
“Oh don't be like that, you were half asleep. My device doesn't interfere with that type of plane, it didn't matter if I used it.”
“Who is your brother?”
She stopped, laying still. Panting, she opened her eyes to look at John. He saw no fear or pain in them, which greatly surprised him. She pulled the white fluffy ruff down on her neck, and John saw the same tall jeweled collar she wore at auction.
’ Bluebell thought to herself. She put her arms up and helped her charge down, the girl having executed her goal of pulling an apple off a higher limb. “I’ve answered your questions, Mr Holmes.”
“Yeah. Every day since we met.”
“I said something foolish…” Sherlock said, not looking away from the top of the stairs where John had disappeared.
Miss me? Damn but this is a long chapter, and as much as I wanna skip ahead sometimes... I gotta lay the groundwork first. If it helps, Chapter 17 (or what at this point will be chapter 21) is almost entirely written. So that'll go up quickly following A Drama in Four Acts.
“Another ten minutes, to be safe.”
“Are you not coming?”
Sherlock turned to look at him. “Why not?”
“Pick one. You’re going to help my baby brother find his lost sheep.”
“Oi!” John jolted away, yelling again in pain as he pushed back with his legs. “Fuck. Sherlock.”
John pushed himself to move faster, gritting his teeth, but he was already slowing. His leg wouldn’t cooperate, even though he’d been able to remove the stitches. He cursed as Sherlock rounded the stairs into the guard tower and vanished from sight.
“I know,” John waved as he caught sight of the bouncing white locks he’d been scanning for, “I’m the absolute worst.”
John looked over incredulously. “What-”
“Ah. Right.” Lestrade stepped away and pulled out a letter. “I know you chaps haven’t had much of a chance to recover, but I really need the help.”
“It's ok, Faas. Thank you. Knowing something… is better than not. Right?” John mumbled, deep inside his own head.
Sherlock was completely taken aback, his chest aching with what he’d just seen. John pushing him out, John hating himself, John closing down every confidence and trust built between them. He didn’t consider it at all, the stakes were much too high. “I promise.” He breathed out, quiet but certain he could be heard.
.” Sherlock urged John towards the entrance to the wings.
“So she has found a way to work around the regular distaste for technology the fae have, or her familiar doesn’t apply that particular hang up to it’s work with her. Most likely the latter.” Sherlock reemerged in his pajamas; sweat pants, a loose tee and his dressing gown. “I haven’t seen a Bugul-noz in any of the anthologies Bluebell lent me. Could you describe it?”
“This is the more important case.”
Bluebell kissed her on the cheek and moved past her. “I’ll try to remember that, if I end up having the time.” She said, feeling hopeful and energised as she turned the corner and started up the stairs. She didn’t make it up even three.
Mrs Hudson sat her up gently, unperturbed by her exposed body, and guided a straw to her mouth. “Oh hush.” She admonished gently. “You’re capable of more than getting through this nasty business.”  She said as she coaxed her charge to sip at the water. Bluebell started coughing, so she removed the water and rubbed her back. “This won’t take you down. You know, Sherlock went through something similar shortly after I met him. You can’t tell me you’re not at least as stubborn as he is.”
He opened his mouth to yell as the spreading pain became unbearable, but was relatively certain he couldn’t make a noise let alone scream.
Sherlock’s face warmed several degrees and he put his hand on hers. “Count on it.”
curse yourself,
“Magical and not? I thought yours was a powerful community.”
“And you’ve obviously been ignoring fae as long as you could see them, or written them off as fantasy. Now you haven’t any idea how to go about it properly, evidenced by how easily they’ve provoked your fae instincts and nearly spirited you away.”
“What’s that?” John murmured, sitting back as they took off.
“You said sylphs, yeah?”
It has come to my attention that my use of the wendigo is very possibly appropriation of Native lore/spiritualism. I’m a white person. So until I can assess this and either get a person who knows better to sign off, or I fix it or replace it... this chapter will be down, as well as any other mentioning this creature.
“I guess… at least I’m not crazy.”
“Likely there was. Just not in our news.”
“She’s smart, she’ll know a fake. I figured if anyone can fool her it’ll be you.”
Lestrade stared an almost embarrassingly long time in disbelief, then cleared his throat. “Yeah. If there’s… there’s anything I
Bluebell looked carefully at them, though they were upside down. The first page was one photo, nearly larger than the page, with 25th December of the previous year printed in neat scrawl in the top corner. It was half candid, a photo of a blond man in a terrible seasonal jumper who sat on the arm of a leather armchair with a smile and a glass of wine. He was looking at the camera with his arms around Mrs Hudson in a handsome purple dress. And in the background, just in front of the window where one could see snow falling outside, was Sherlock. His back was three quarters turned, and he was playing a violin. The tiniest bit of one eye could be seen among his dark curls, closed in the rhythm of the music.
John’s attention was caught by something hissing as soon as Sherlock had addressed their kind; a cat. It looked normal enough. John looked away quickly, but then… Sherlock seemed to see it, too.
“Because he’ll either screw ya around ‘er, if ya show ‘im up, he’ll take it out on someone.”
Prepare for fluff, my friends!
“Not to
“And cursed Shifters gain the Sight.”
“I’ll look into this book!” Lestrade called after them. Bluebell lifted an arm in acknowledgement, not turning around.
Shaken back again by her hand on his… but damn, the heat. He put his forehead to hers, then sat back with a frown at her unknowing face. “Your damn brain is being poached in your skull.” He said, more to himself, with the taste of rot in his words.
John looked a bit wary still, but nodded and after a few minutes was able to slide into conversation and forget his apprehension.
“Leo!”
“How did they find you?”
It was only for half a second.
Blinking again, as if he hadn’t noticed the mob or cacophony around them, he did a quick sweep with his eyes before he put his hands, still gloved, to John’s. “Seems they’ve taken issue with something.”
“You’re taking this seriously and you want me to believe what you have to say, not just pacify me.” John spoke as if making a guess, albeit an educated one. Then, unexpectedly, his eyes flashed and though he didn’t move, he filled the space between them. “And, or, you’re testing me. I’m listening properly, Sherlock. Just tell me straight out what happened. I don’t want to circle around defensively. What happened when you went searching for Moriarty?”
Something light with a sharp edge hit him in the head and he sat up. There was a paper ball on his lap, where it had rolled.
Followed by an angry hissing, a growl. John pulled at his chains, at gravity, at his body’s protest. He let out a threat he didn’t know if he actually articulated or if it was just howling, then there was pain, and then darkness.
“‘Petty bullying’ is so far from what that was, Sherlock, it was a bloody angry mob. The only clue missing is torches and pitchforks.” He pushed into the front door, which had been left ajar, and up the stairs to the bathroom.
“John.” Mycroft said a little less smugly after a moment. “Regardless what you might think, I do not have a personal, private jet. Last you made such a request, that was not
“I was shot straight through, from the back. When the round entered it was cleaner, and it takes a lot of force to get through everything in its way. So it sort of takes bits of whoever it hits with it when it comes out the other side.” John was not used to teaching, and he wasn't sure any of this was appropriate… but he also felt he should be honest with them when he could. He would almost certainly have to lie about something crucial later.
John put his hands, folded, on the table. “This is not clearing out heroin or hiding a pack of cigarettes, though I should resent the implication. I’ve lived for years without incident, a couple of them with Sherlock even, so I’d say you either give some proof I’m a threat or bugger off about it. As far as I can see, there’s no reason it’s any of your business.”
“No. But at least I know why Harriet is jumping back into my life so aggressively.”
fucker
Why did that make the hair rise on John’s neck, make his face feel flushed? He wanted to refute it immediately, but didn’t, and became incredibly uncomfortable. Both Sherlock and Faas were watching him closely. He set his jaw, raised his paper, and spoke in as casual a tone as he could muster. “You may get a frustrated call from Lestrade later, though. I was forced to employ self-defense with a local police sergeant.”
John pushed as hard as he could down on Moriarty’s hands and swung up with his elbow. Moriarty dodged back, then backhanded John in the face…
Her face paled, and Sherlock’s eyes shone with triumph.
John groaned and put his head down in his arms. “Of course you do.”
“You already know.”
John knelt beside Sherlock and spoke into his radio. “The bird coming up on the roof is the warden, don’t let her escape.” He looked over Sherlock carefully and helped him sit up. “What the
His handler walked away, shoes clicking on the hardwood. John could see a girl in rags and chains, and his vision cleared. His ears stopped ringing. He took a step towards her but was stopped by his restraints. She was a small, ordinary girl… but something was odd about her… John supposed there would have to be, for her to be here.
Hearing that, Sherlock pushed himself up so he was sitting on the top of his seat and swiveled around to look at them. “Oh yes. I am Sherlock Holmes.”
This is a shorter chapter, and the next will be quite long. So it'll take a bit for me to finish and post it. Apologies. I will do my best to have it up in less than a week's time.
“Yes, she thinks about if it were you in that field because she didn’t find you in time.”
And by the end of her tale, no matter how embellished some parts seemed, the smile on Sherlock’s face was completely erased.
“You realize I could easily agree to this and if something does happen, you have no guarantee I’ll do it.”
where it was, making it a bit easier for John to determine how long he’d been out.
“Do I enjoy… what?”
“I despise you right now…” Sherlock seethed quietly.
“Captain John Watson.” For half a tick, John thought he would have to just leave it and huff off. “Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Army doctor.” He raised both brows, looking proud. Of himself, or of John, the man opposite couldn’t tell. “Doctor Captain, or Captain Doctor… hard, with all those titles. To decide on one. Now, at least to some, there’s another. What is it?”

people,
“Escape to where? I have nothing, no currency nor identification. How would I get from this island to anywhere?”
“Christ. Your eyes are bloody unsettling, you know that?” Lestrade huffed, annoyed he’d been taken off guard. Then he really saw the clay-like substance in his paws properly. “God, man, is that
“Any inclination to steal an ashtray from
Sherlock looked at him affectionately, huffing out the last of his exasperation. He stood carefully, taking John’s cane and handing it to him. Then he helped the cane help him stand. “Come on. If we are very, very fortunate… we can still catch the ferry back and take the midnight flight from Siglufjordur to London.”
Malnourished, extremely. Even in a vastly unfamiliar anatomy, it was obvious. Nothing broken, but several marks where he’d been burned by electric shock, healed over, then burned again. Movement weary. Hints of recurrence of psychosomatic limp…
“Slowly. Don’t speak.” Sherlock was moving to…
She looked up at him. He was very different, right after accessing whatever ‘Redbeard’ was. She shook her head. “I need to shift, it’s very uncomfortable to go this long without. I couldn’t shift after leaving Baskerville. Not around K.”
John opened his eyes to see his detective was right in his bloody face. “What?” He huffed, still not remotely calmed down.
“You’re going to start me smoking again.” He muttered. “Back with us in reality, then?”
Sherlock knelt in front of him, eyes running over the brace and identifying what John was having issues with. “You’ve exacerbated it, the top hinge will unjam if you start at the center.”
Hollow eyes devoid of recognition stared at him, a dumb grin sliding along her face. “Looked so soft…” She muttered as her hand slowly fell down his ear and off.
“My niece.” John said quietly, mostly mouthed actually, at her.
She would sit at his feet, reading something on John’s laptop in a language Sherlock didn’t know, likely from the look of it something close to Spanish or at least from South America. Given her shift, if it had anything to do with her heritage, it made sense. He also noted though she could speak it, she could not read or write in English.
John stalled again, and just shut off the engine. He left the lights on.
“Not really, I’m afraid. She changes frequently, within a half hour most times, and she has trouble remembering she isn’t in a lab.” Mrs Hudson reported before putting a hand to her mouth and gazing down at Bluebell with concern. John put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed gently.
But Sherlock didn't linger, using the vantage only to see what he was doing more clearly as he washed the larger exit wound. He set John’s foot back on the hardwood and wrung out the cloth. Then he stood again to empty the water and wash his hands.
“Are you giving me lip, Sherlock Holmes?” Mrs Hudson pushed him over to take off his coat. “Really, ill or not you can’t sleep like this.” She tutted.
Starting at the sudden show of cognizenze, John looked at the sopping figure to find he was looking right at him with a wicked grin. “Um…”
“Hey.”
” He could hear… not his voice, but one from many years in his past, and mumbled the words they’d said then; “If you give into this, you’re letting someone else dictate and snuff out your life. I know you’re stubborn enough to make up for the strength they took from you. If you can hold on… this will pass. Something better will replace it. If you can hold on.”
John smirked. On the way back, Sherlock had gone into great, unsolicited detail about how he couldn't deduce which Mycroft would go after, because he didn't pay attention to the vast array of connections his brother kept. That, and they'd stopped to grab something to eat at the airport. Apparently Mycroft hadn't banked on something as pedestrian as their getting peckish.
Bluebell sighed and replaced her cup in its saucer, keeping tuned to the hall Kirsty had gone down. She couldn’t hear any of this. “Safer, less conspicuous. Until the gene therapy finally kicked in. She hadn’t thought it would, it took a week from injection to be remotely detectable in my fur. By then it was too late to take me back, but Kirsty started telling people I was a fairy, and Bluebell had to go. Had to be something a child made in her fantasies. She doesn’t know.”
Even after getting about six solid hours of sleep before they left, John managed to kill some of their time by napping. The other bits were spent secretly checking up on their route and transfers, reading whatever local newspapers he could find in English, and ignoring texts from his sister. She hadn’t been able to visit yet and was becoming unbearable about it. John wasn’t about to tell her he’d left the damn country, he knew she wouldn’t take that well at all.
“I don’t think I could have taken more than that pompous Frenchman this trip, honestly.” He announced, resting his head back on the neck pillow he’d purchased in the airport.
“Thanks for coming. Let me know what you find out.” John offered, sitting up properly and giving a half-hearted smile.
John looked a little annoyed, but mostly unimpressed. If someone wanted to push his buttons, they’d have to do better. He’d lived for some time now with
He put both of his hands on the table, on either side of his phone. His eyes were shut and he was concentrating on his breathing.
I'm not bitter.
“What, a vampire?” John read the lines over to be sure.
“It is not at all random.” Sherlock hissed.
Blinking, Sherlock didn’t move. “We’ll get there around dusk. It will be dangerous, that’s an active time for Neighbors.”
John sort of moms all over the place, because someone has to, and then gets momed because no one is perfect. We meet Faas' brother finally. Bluebell mostly sleeps.
Mycroft rubbed his left eyebrow. “Do you know me as a jokester.” He replied, dry as a bone.
“The New Scotland Yard did call, sir, to back his credentials.” She offered.
“Payment, miss.”
“Dunking your head.” John warned blandly, thinking Sherlock wasn’t paying attention anyway. Holding his detective’s nose closed, he pushed him under the soapy water and back up, taking up the conditioner (they’d packed Bluebells as John was certain Sherlock used it but couldn’t find any in his bathroom)...
Was it arrogant of him to have thought he could live his life without the wolf?
“Alright?” John asked after watching sweat bead on the pallid face of his detective. He stood away after seeing the the minute nod, then pushed the back of his hand under dark curls. “Shit, Sherlock, you’re burning up.” His frown darkened as he cursed his direly limited knowledge of this side of medicine. He had no clue what to expect or how to treat it, and Bluebell was in no state to be consulted on the matter.
“Food is there, bathroom is there.” Sherlock said to her shortly, pointing to each.
Sherlock frowned deeply. He stopped walking and turned to fully face his doctor. “... I need your help.”
“I…” Faas hesitated.
“Oi!”
Andrea waited another moment, tapping on her blackberry. The Bugul-noz reached over and tapped a key now and then, looking as if it were a friend pointing to something missed on the screen. John saw something shoot out of the mobile, making him flinch back, and through the wall out of sight.
“What's that?” She asked, pointing with her whole arm at his left shoulder. The spidering scar of his wartime exit wound was no longer (mostly) concealed by fur. “Can I touch it?”
Now she knew she had his attention, the older woman smiled warmly at Bluebell and pulled her gently into her kitchen. “Now, dear, you look as if you haven’t eaten in days. You’re not like Sherlock, I can tell. He seems to think he can sustain himself on the air alone.” She joked lightly, sitting Bluebell at the table while she put on the tea and got out a dish of bread and jam.
“Yeah, he wouldn’t while he was awake, but when he was sleeping sometimes he would say stuff like ‘
“It will be far easier if I remove your trousers.”
It hadn’t been as long a walk as John would have thought, though part of it he had to carry Sherlock’s clothes and wait out in the brush (what little of it there was) before continuing. When they reached the next town (jumping the fence, Sherlock had admitted, was unnecessary. Just faster.), Sherlock went into the local grocery first thing and flipped through more papers, buying a few and leaving the rest. All the ones he’d chosen were very local.
There was a long pause (two minutes, thirty-six seconds) before John spoke again. “I don’t like calling in favors like that unless I really have to.” Sherlock abandoned the thought entirely, searching his database for a redundancy to fit the voice on the other side of the line. “No. I don’t have an alternative. Yet. I have a little time.” That little rub of friction; he’d moved his weight off one leg. He was irritated but submissive, to the person or the facts they presented Sherlock could not yet tell. He was also wearing jeans. The list of things that indicated flashed through Sherlock’s mind and he picked out the most damning (he was railing subconsciously against his ties to the fae, he felt out of control of something and wanted reassurance, and he either wasn’t leaving the flat today or he was going to a pub. Most likely the latter. Frustrating.) before tuning in for the end of the call.
“No-”
“You could look at it like that.” John offered, grinding the gear shift but managing to continue down the dark country road.
John wouldn’t approve. He was far more on edge after the assault via egg than Sherlock was. If nothing else, it proved he was in far less danger here than in London. For whatever reason, it seemed at least one Neighbor was inclined enough to shield him when Miss Kar could not. Not that he considered himself an easy victim, in any case.
Yes I left a fairly literal cliffhanger and yes this doesn't resolve it at all. But I'm not the showrunners. I'm not going to give you bullshit, I'm going to actually explain things properly. Because I'm not a dickhead.
Just before he went inside the lodging, he caught a glimpse of what could be the sylph from Ireland. He put that aside for the moment and walked in. Sherlock was in the waiting area, spinning what John assumed was their room key on his finger. He came over and took John’s bag without a word, and took off at a quick walk past the lobby and down a hall.
John shut the door and took a whiff of the coffee, bringing the tray over to the table and setting it down.
John sat back and crossed his arms, looking out on London as well, though he did not see it. “She really made an impression on you, huh?”
“I don’t need the hassle, the little twerp confessed at the scene. Doesn’t matter if he took it back the next second, he’s our perp, and there’s no need to let some
Returning after a minute with a bowl of water and a cloth, Sherlock said nothing more as he worked. The warm water and soft cloth (who knew they had any left?) felt soothing enough John forgot the situation. At least until Sherlock cupped a hand behind his knee and lifted it up to rest on his shoulder.
“Gibson Blythe, if you must know. What business have you in taking other Shifters. You were sold.”
“How- ugh…” John let his face fall into his hand and stifled a giggle. “Sherlock, if I go in
“Yes, John. But you need to be the one to assert it, I’m not strictly part of this contract. Why else than Mycroft would she mention anyone else in this context. He must have a Shifter helping, a heron. Grey Heron, in all likelihood.”
“No matter, this will be easier.” Sherlock walked right up and knelt at John’s legs, his hands going to John’s waistband.
Either way, neither man spoke until they were back in their room.
After making several practice planes, John jotted a short message and folded a better one.
Sherlock’s expression ticked a moment before setting back as it was, his eyes flashing. “Did you now?” His reply rumbled out of the depths of his chest, and John felt he’d hit a nerve.
“Hm. We’re tied, Mycroft’s found two as well. That takes South America off our list.”
-Bluebell gives Lestrade the name of an occult book as a lead and proves she actually knows what she's doing
John watched, and Sherlock blinked. “Yeah. That’s what it’s like.” He stood and took two steps closer, so he was looking down and Sherlock tilted his head back to look him in the eye. “Who am I to anyone who doesn’t know me?” Sherlock gave him a look. “Humor me.”
“He was and he wasn’t. People keep a particular sense about them forever, I’ve found. But John lost nearly all of it during his service.” Mike’s jovial face took on an almost alien sense of sadness and contemplation. “He got back and it just… confidence, weight, humor, color… people change as they age, yeah, but that wasn’t it at all. Now, though…”
“If this is about your vacation…” He started. Bluebell couldn’t tell if he was joking.
Not that he had to ask, John was pointedly staring at a spot about ten feet above their heads and off down the road. Opposite the way they had to go. “Do you know her? Bluebell, like me but a rabbit.”
with the case. I’m not dropping it now.”
As he carefully began to open the door to peek, it slammed hard against him and threw him back. He managed to stay on his feet, but the knob had hit him in the eye. He blinked, getting it re-orientated as he crouched, adrenaline pumping hard through him.
“Enough!” She yelled, moving her finger to the trigger. “I’m starting to think a minute was too generous.” She seethed.
John had heard cats speak before, not in human tongue but at the least he understood them sometimes when they made noise. No other animals seemed to have that skill, or if they did, John hadn’t seen it.
What had followed was a deep series of quick motions and blurred circumstances, and pain.
“Fer folk who make their stock in solid facts, ya both communicate almost completely subtextually.” Faas drew John’s eye; he’d forgotten the other Shifter was in the room.
the animal. We have some time. I was going to teach a little Shifter culture to the girls, if you’d like to listen. They haven’t said where they’re from, but they don’t know much about themselves either.”
“Miss LeCoup is not doing well.” John answered, voice taut and dull as he slumped down on his lounger and put his hands over his face. “Nothing more can be done, though, thanks.” He assured Lestrade, tone softening to become more friendly opposed to business-like.
Sherlock moved first, to cock his head a bit. Right. Sherlock didn’t get this sort of thing. “Yes.” He replied, unsure but unconcerned. He blinked languidly. If this suited to distract John from the real mortal danger they were powerless against settling upstairs, it didn’t really matter the context.
John couldn't tell if Sherlock was asking normally or poking fun. “Why… why are we talking about this?”
“Quite anticlimactic.” Sherlock mumbled in the passenger seat as John stalled the rover for the second time. John just grinned.
“Hold on!” John called, grabbing his cane and following. “Is that it?” He huffed when he’d caught up.
“Yes, an excellent question. I’m afraid I haven’t worked that out just yet. What I-”
As Kar spoke to the angry people, John led Sherlock out through the space she’d created and back towards the villa. Faas moved once they passed to the middle of the road.
“Yeah…”
can hear
John stared daggers but sat back. “Fine.”
John’s mouth was dry… even if Sherlock did find him, or if he escaped somehow… Baskerville was only the preamble. They couldn’t go back to how things were.
He’d been everywhere remotely possible on the bottom and ground floors without so much as a whiff of Shifter, and he’d started to regret dismissing the sylphs help so soon. But she would have caught attention if anyone there had the Sight, which there was highly likely to be at least one of.
“Then we would have wasted time arguing about it.”
“You did say you’d be up all night.” She replied with a warm smile. “Should I bring yours and Mr Holmes’ meals as well, or will you be dining with us?”
#TheAuthorIsBadAtTimeManagement
“Here.” Sherlock tossed him a small black cylinder, which John managed to catch one handed.  He pocketed it as he started off behind the detective, who was already walking towards the outskirts of town.
Sherlock frowned, not backing off. “I don’t see the humor.”
to love and be loved.” He let the music settle so he could hear John hum assent. “Who, then… someone Sight-less but who knows and accepts you as you are.” The music picked up, setting a feeling of anticipation into the space. “Who could you feel comfortable around, enough to share this secret and allow them to keep close regardless?” John raised his head at the behest of the violin as it picked up speed until the strings vibrated visibly. “Who, indeed, would love a werewolf?”
John didn’t touch his tea. He just listened to the rain and London and the tap tap tapping of Mycroft’s trademark umbrella on the tile.
Currently twelve chapters are planned (more or less) but there will be more than that. Sorry this chapter was so short ^_^;
“Probably.” Faas said, slowly relaxing since his brother had left. “But can everyone else.”
see. It wasn’t difficult to identify which people to be wary of, even if he had no Sight. He checked his golden pocket watch. They’d arrived during cocktails, the auction wouldn’t begin for another hour. That was his time limit.
John answered it hastily. “God bless you.” He said as he saw not only the covered plate and glasses of both juice and milk, but a carafe as well.
With a wink, she was off. She strayed far off the main road, veering east.
There had been no alerts from Mrs H while he was gone, so he was fairly certain there was no change, and without an idea as to the substance used there was no way to safely lessen her body’s sudden drop in whatever experimental drug Moriarty and his people had been testing on her.
“Possible? Are you really in a position to say that?” Sherlock sighed and walked swiftly over. He pulled a pin from his coat and made quick work of the simple lock. He pushed it open. It didn’t squeak. “If you’re so keen on seeing for yourself…” He made a gentleman’s gesture and John gave him an odd look. But he had to see.
Mycroft put the letter on his desk and looked down upon it with his disapproving frown. It was telling, that he’d gotten a hold of this other than his brother for whom it
John’s skin crawled and he didn’t have to look to tell the creature was directly next to him.
“No, my parents don’t know anything about it. Harry saw me change as a kid. She isn’t magical either.”
Sherlock played high notes, which took his excellent control to keep from being screeching. “Did she tease you like the others?”
John.”
She patted his arm and looked up at him. “You bring our boy home.”
The two men sat in silence until the door downstairs was shut to indicate their visitors departure.
“Detective Inspector.” Sherlock interrupted loudly, looking perturbed. “Did you, or did you not, come here with a case?”
“Rabbit-shift.” Bluebell corrected, rolling her ankles to stretch them.
John looked up. “What?”
Sherlock pursed his lips, but bit back a snide remark. “Fine. Give me a moment.” He turned and left the kitchen, and a moment later the women heard him taking the stairs two at a time.
Sherlock had shared that their hostess had gone so far as to register the Andean Cat as her exotic animal with the proper authorities, so if they were getting the girl out of the country without incident, it was going to be as a human. That held it’s own set of problems, which Sherlock assured John he’d taken care of. When John asked for details, Sherlock refused, saying the fewer details John had to remember, the less likely it was he’d be caught having to lie. And they hadn’t yet figured out how to handle the bogle.
“Sherlock!” John gripped hard onto Sherlock’s upper arms and wrenched him sideways, away from the wall. Just as a burst of very real flame shot down upon them.
’ It seemed to say. Which was contradictory, in logical terms, since taking on the ‘curse’ and becoming a Shifter too would only serve to bring them closer. But in John’s personal terms… he’d given Sherlock the data to see them quite clearly. This was a part of him he resented and hid from, and not for unsubstantial reasons. Even though he hadn’t said it, it was obvious John blamed himself for the abduction of the boys who showed him what he could do. That and his sister’s terrified reaction had made that event solidify in it’s power in his mind, even now.
It had taken no small amount of cajoling to settle things between brothers, at least to the point Sherlock would be in the vicinity of Mycroft without spitting at him like a cat. Once again the situation looked to John to be the adult.
.” John commanded. The detective frowned deeply but complied. He wouldn’t listen forever, so John took a breath and dug in. “You’re not going to pull another stunt like that with us, right?”
John hummed, thinking about that. “I suppose Sherlock’s lucky he has a friend here.”
She screwed up her face as she tried to hang on to cognizance. “Today… god, how long had today been?”
Sherlock put his hand over the strings to interrupt the reverb and stood, replacing the instrument in it’s case. “One explanation is she’s using her own power.”
Sherlock looked quite interested at that. “But that’s…” he read the nervous agitation on John’s face, “not what you want me to say. Not… what you’d prefer to discuss.”
“Just take them off yourself, then.” Sherlock huffed. “There’s no reason you should have to change the bandages yourself, at least.” He went off to the kitchen without waiting for a reply.
People were starting to leave finally, many chortling about how unexpectedly entertaining things had turned out.
“I’ve gotta see him home, I don’t know if you’ve been on the receiving end of Sherlock’s displeasure but…” Lestrade chuckled as he stood outside with Mike, waiting for John to come back from the loo. He’d found the new man to be a disarming, supportive presence and had taken to him quickly.
Sherlock looked up from the blueprint he was scanning. “She wasn’t a Shifter. What was she?”
Sherlock stood, though it looked as if he used self-restraint (who knew he had any) to keep his hands to himself. “We’ll be in the air about eleven more hours, I suggest you’re human when we land. Until then.” Sherlock sat back down in his seat and pulled out a laptop he’d gotten off one of his contacts. When he looked up again, he couldn’t see the rabbit-shift anymore.
“Yeah, and what are you going to do? Hit me again when I’m not looking?”
“Why would I care anymore, it’s basically random.” John answered as he poured himself a cup, downing it without regards to temperature.
“Sherlock… jesus.” Taking his hand off the wound, John put his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and shoved him up out of his lap to face him. “Look at me. It fucking
“Why would we need more than one bed, John.”
Looking disgusted at that, Sherlock ducked back into the kitchen. “She's a caster. Of course she's a bloody caster…” he mumbled.
“Not that I can tell, but I might ask someone who would really know once we get back. For now, though. Sherlock, cut it out.”
“Try.”
Something in that stung, and made Sherlock weary. He wanted to sleep, rare as the compulsion seemed. Instead, he shrank in the front seat into his clothes as they crumpled around his new lion-bear form. John was right, lord it was uncomfortable to shift with clothes on. With as little movement as possible, he kicked his pants and trousers and the one sock he’d somehow kept partially on his paw, off himself. Then he curled up and pushed tissues into his ears and calculated how much longer this drive would be.
Everything came rushing back, all his senses, much too quickly. A heat, a rage he’d never known. As the woman groaned, getting her own senses back, Sherlock was upon her.
He learned a bit as he listened to them blather the morning away, such as this lady’s eccentric, somewhat famous mother who had inherited both this and another castle in Switzerland from her parents, and other stories of the things she’d said and done. It wasn’t until just before noon something actually interesting was said, though.
“Yeah…” John licked his lips thoughtfully, troubled. “Nothing is all we have. Sherlock…” He stood, the twinge in his leg back for a split second. He opened his mouth to say something else, to ask… but he stopped. Sherlock was staring at him, carefully and curiously. He waited for John to speak. After a tick, John awkwardly cleared his throat and shifted his weight. That look, when it was entirely focused on one thing, was often awe-inspiring. When it was focused entirely on
“Did I not see you at a delightfully engaging auction in Ireland last month?”
“I can’t.” Blythe hissed at Sherlock, getting riled up at the sight of him.
The fae creature put a finger to it’s mouth and winked, flying past him to the fairy ring and diving excitedly onto the watch. It clutched it and snuggled against it like a long lost pet, then flew out of the circle. Or at least, it made the attempt.
A long, deep groan purred over the motor when they were a few miles down the road. John was already taking off the cuffs and collar. “God what a nightmare. I really hope finding the rest won’t be like this.”
“Something like that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked over at Sherlock, who was working on something in his mind. That could take hours or seconds, and with no way to tell, John heaved himself up.
Then he was choking on the gas, doubling over as he gasped. It only fed more of the flavorless white smoke into his lungs, and he collapsed slowly down the metal mesh, not giving Moran the satisfaction of a curse.
Even from the greenhouse sitting room in the Kar family house, shouting carried from the middle of the miniscule town and caught John’s attention. It rang through, bouncing around off the stone and sounding more like barking than yelling. His guts twisted terribly as he pushed himself up, knocking over his teacup but ignoring it as he started in a brisk walk to the door. “Faas, stay here.” He called back even as the teenager jumped down.
Frown turning thoughtful, Mycroft thumped his umbrella gently, twice. “That’s never been a documented occurrence; neither of those symptoms.” He hummed.
Processing things he felt he needed to do that he really would rather not, Sherlock silently reached out of the pile and retrieved his own mobile from his dressing gown. It was awkward to type with his Shift hands, but still doable, and he clicked off a short message with a determined frown.
“Oh, that was the Geek Interpreter case.” Mrs Hudson cooed. “You hadn’t slept in more than a full week that time. John wasn’t much better off, but he refused to crash until after he was sure you were under.”
As predicted, the feather finally fell to earth and rested still around dusk. John hadn’t seen any fae during that part of their trek.
Bluebell glared. She took the plate of biscuits Kirsty had brought over and placed them in front of Sherlock. She shot him another mean look before turning her entire body to face the child, her demeanor changing completely. “K, I know it’s your friend Mr Holmes has come to find, but I need to talk to him about a few things first. Could you please go into mommy’s study and water her plants for me?”
Sherlock just looked at him with a deep frown. “Do not do this.” He said; a warning.
“Right. Okay. What else, then?”
“The warden wasn’t a Shifter, nor was she a caster from what I could tell, though how would I know? Most of the evidence is invisible to my eyes. Do you have any idea how frustrating that has been since this began? It doesn’t factor in, regardless.” He stopped a moment, turned, and started pacing counterclockwise. “She used a skin, a very particular skin. Rare, because it’s difficult to tell whether it’s genuine unless you’re a Shifter yourself. You’ve been close to something similar before, you couldn’t hide your reaction every time the reek hit your nose.”
Only having to maneuver around two of the servants of the house, John found their quarters and, more importantly, the uniforms they were to employ for the evening. So far, things were going smoothly.
Then he stood and waded to his bedroom to descend into the depths of his cool, smooth sheets.
John was thankful for the reprieve to collect his nerves. Even though the wet on his leg made him feel cold; the dreary dull ache from something warm and safe retreating. He closed his eyes and settled back, wanting to ask for his little bottle of pills.
So Sherlock had taken off alone to stroll around out of sight, do his own legwork. John didn’t know which scent to track anyway.
“You should know me. You had everything set up, the whole thing just to lure him out and take him. Where is he, Doctor Watson? No games. Or I will kill you. And I'll have your friend show me.”
“No.” John looked at him quizzically.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good, done.” Sherlock said after a minute of staring and circling and bending over until his nose nearly touched the ground all around it. As soon as he’d said it, the wind kicked up again and wiped it bare, just another patch of soil. John could hear giggling from somewhere in the trees. When he turned to look, Sherlock was already hiking off the way they’d come.
Lestrade wrinkled his brow a bit and nodded. “In any case…”
Watching the cab pull up on the curb, Sherlock leapt out of the chair, pecked Mrs Hudson on the cheek, and was off. After all that time to plan, he knew exactly where he was going. Exactly where he might find an elusive door into Shifter society. He tried, after giving the address, to not dwell on the very frustrating fact he’d not seen the proverbial hide nor hair of all of this before it’d been thrust in his face. Stupid.
Lights further up began to flicker on, orbs lining the road kept aloft by something unseen, and Miss Kar shut off the lights on the SUV.
“Here.” Sherlock came up and handed him a passport. “‘Uncle John’ should carry it.”
“Faas. Hush.” His mother chided in a firm, quiet voice.
“This is what I need you to do…” he spoke quickly and quietly as he led her around to the back stairs.
“Yeah and how is Clara by the way? She’s always been the one to stop you coming after me to yell ignorant shit in my face.”
Wrinkling his brow, John looked at the small woman driving. He hadn’t taken notice, but she seemed terribly anxious in a way that hadn’t come out at the airport. “Will having Bluebell here for her rehab be a problem?”
“Mycroft Siger Holmes, if it comes up.”
“I… I dunno.” He admitted. “I dun think he’d poison her ‘er anythin…”
John looked over at this random-seeming break in the silence, and at Sherlock's apparent opinion that 'in passing' meant 'during an ongoing murder game'. “Yeah. Possibly Moriarty’s first murder, if we were optimistic people.”
“Hm,” Faas looked up and tilted his head slightly, “you didn’t know? Because’a him.” Since he was holding his breakfast in his dominant hand, Faas gestured towards Sherlock with his elbow. “One’a the easiest ways ta get the Shifters ta turn on ya is associating with someone being punished by the Fair folk. Dun matter it wasn’t yer fault, you got cursed and it’ll never be accepted by other Shifters. ‘Least not th’ traditional ones.”
suitcase) had been moved to the table at the foot of the bed, the lights had been dimmed, and Sherlock was gone.
“Good. Strel, I need you to put these on ok?” John handed over his small brown paper package.
“I’m not saying all this ta scare you, or ta hurt. It’s… a friendly warning. What happened, is happening, with my brother... is not right. I don’t like ta see anything like that happen, and if you haven’t been around any of us much until now… you deserve ta know.”
Deciding at that moment this man didn’t possess the logic needed to have a discussion, John turned to see what Sherlock wanted to do now. He wasn’t there.
“What is that?” He asked Bluebell, speaking quietly and moving slowly. Sherlock helped him stand.
Sherlock threw it into gear and they raced off down the country road.

Sherlock just nodded, keeping his gaze on her. It wasn’t one of anticipation or expectation, just… looking her in the eye, blinking occasionally. She looked right back, feeling a pull in her gut of deep sadness. The way he looked now, she was
John regretted acknowledging the cat immediately as a chatter began around him, most definitive of which was a little creature the size of a sparrow that looked like a little naked girl with bird’s wings and taloned feet. With her tiny humanoid hands, she took John’s finger and raised it, tugging gently.
“Would it have changed your mind?”
Scrunching his face in thought, John considered her questions. After a moment, he took a drink, put down his cup, and replied, “I can’t say I have any of those things. Actually, it’s sort of the opposite. Between moving around a bunch as a child and being in the army, I’ve never attached myself to physical possessions. I could leave everything and start over without much trouble. It just seems… practical. And I’ve never noticed or had anything pointed out that was odd about my body, besides you know… when I’m a wolf.” He sighed, crossed his arms, and leaned back. “Don’t suppose asking them would be the obvious answer.”
“Seven.” Sherlock interjected.
. Jesus! We need to
Seeing lights… Sherlock… Hands were crushing again, no air… dark…
“John-!”
. The other two got ahead of me. They were a deer of some type and an elk, so they were faster than me. I was still getting used to being on four legs, as well.
“So…” She began. There was something peculiar that stuck out to her. “Did you learn how to seem like you care from John, or did he open up the part of you that actually does?”
She was taller even than Sherlock by a good three inches, with ice eyes that rivaled the detective’s and straight, white hair that was tugged neatly back in a tail which draped from high up on her head to the small of her back. Her dark skin was mottled all over, and she carried herself with an easy grace as she looked down at them with a level, neutral face.
Now, as they sat in the cab and drove towards Heathrow, Sherlock was caught somewhere between sulking and relieved.
“Yeah.” Bluebell breathed, her pounding head pushing her consciousness far below the surface.
She seemed taken in by all of Sherlock’s peacocking, though once she saw John she frowned. “I’m afraid I was not expecting company…” She began, before Sherlock jumped in.
"Hm." Sherlock barely acknowledged him, clearly in his own mind.
“What exactly constitutes whether one can or cannot use ‘magic’?”
“Yes after the sale went south, of course I could smell plebeian on that little woman no surprise there, I was able to make a very shrewd deal to bring home the Warrah.” Sherlock boasted behind his mask. “It wouldn’t do for a place like that to put a sold lot up, and reveal they’d let in someone of… questionable pedigree.”
“You’re right.” Sherlock started slowly, carefully. “I have no idea what that’s like. And that’s why this is going to work, why we’re going to find all of them. I don’t have to know, or worry, because that’s the balance you strike. I can focus on logistics, because I trust you to give me insight I’m not capable of when it’s needed.”
“John! Do
I'm the first to admit this chapter is not my best, and likely need to be rewritten. I'm shaky, coming back into the story after so much time struggling with other things. But I figured I'd rather push through and conclude this story properly. One chapter left to go! It's started but I'm still having issues. Wish me luck, and I hope you enjoy.
John watched, transfixed, as with that simple phrase the creature seemed to dissipate. In it’s place was a little ball of black light with eyes like fireflies. It seemed to blink, and then it floated off into the woods like a wisp of fire.
John sighed. Telling a story like this, instead of typing it out one letter at a time, was intimidating. But most of the others shared stories.
“Of course.”
“Miss De Mueron!” Sherlock exclaimed, twisting on his heel as she appeared in the doorway in a tailored sundress and impractically large hat. John wondered, amused, if the flowers sewn into the accessory were alive as they looked. “Such an honor, my lady, to finally meet such an esteemed figure as you.” Sherlock continued, taking her hand dramatically and kissing the large jeweled ring adorning it.
But Sherlock didn’t reply, just stood there with a half-smile. He moved his fingers and made vague gestures once in awhile, but was definitely not present.
“Alright.” She put the towel over the back of one of the empty seats, then moved to the open part of the aisle, where she had the most space. She undid the belt on her robe, but hesitated. Not many people had seen her naked, at least not with permission. She’d been made to shift and shed many times against her will, left shaking and confused on a cold, laboratory floor. She began to regret her agreement, but he’d put up his end…
“I pray for your swift recovery, my lady.”
“As we all well know,” Mycroft tapped his umbrella, making a show of being ‘mature’, “you often act against your own self interest, and we interfere for your sake.”
She simply nodded, and John went to check the hall while she changed.
you know.”
In surprise, John looked up in time to see a line of light dance around in the direction he’d been walking. Someone was looking for them.
At least playing catch up was normal, as far as John’s part in cases was concerned. He’d had to stop the lanky bugger before he dashed out of the bathroom, starkers and soaked.
John stood up straighter, in the stance that had initially informed Sherlock of his military origins. “I’m
“Miss Grant.”
John jolted and his eyes shot open, forced himself to sit up no matter how his body screamed in protest. He wasn’t letting Sherlock carry him.
John sipped his coffee again. “Come now, boys. I didn't drag you out to see whether people really can kill with a look.”
Again, nothing.
As he shook her hand, John tried to push down the anxiety, but was sure some of it showed on his face from how Cennerous was regarding him. “Emissary? You were sent as a representative?”
The hatch opened, flooding the place with light that made John, and everyone else with hands, put one up to guard their eyes. Boots clicked as they came down, shutting the hatch after and making everything seem that much darker. John turned to face out but didn’t stand. He sat up straight as his eyes adjusted to reveal the grinning figure in front of him.
. Home was having to check if Sherlock had taken his Browning again before leaving the flat. It was sitting in a pub with Mike and ragging him about introducing him to a ‘consulting detective’. It was Mike seeing the light and thanks in his eyes instead of the frustration his words implied.
Loving the comments!
Mycroft has the McGuffin, who knew?
Sherlock gave John a few moments to sit, both torches off to keep themselves from being seen. They didn’t light them again until they were well within the line of trees.
She paused before replying, Sherlock picked up on it as her not sharing the real answer. “Maybe they came to their senses. Magic isn’t real, Detective Inspector.” She looked him dead in the eye as if to dare him to challenge her. “In any case, whoever lead this group was versed in a very old, Celtic-originating folklore. There aren’t many copies I know of, for the books they’d have learned this from.” She turned to Sherlock and held out her hand. He lowered his brow but handed her his flipbook. She pulled the small pencil out and scribbled down a title, then ripped out the page and handed it to Lestrade before returning the paper to it’s owner.

for his attachment to Watson.
“Can I pick you up?” John asked. Strel hissed at him. “Fair enough. But you have to sit with me. I can’t drive and Sherlock can’t really do it if you’re sitting with him.”
“You’re not angry anymore.”
“He’s been marked by the White Lady, if you keep him here the Fari won’t work with us!”
Bluebell huffed, wrestling with either going forward blind or giving him the satisfaction of asking for clarification as she climbed in after.
John took out a pair of somewhat less expensive shades, though that suited him much better, and leaned back as he slid them on.
“The administrative assistant will back me up if anything comes of it, and I don’t think I’ll have much trouble with him again.”
.” John seemed to be getting more strength in him every second he stood there, Sherlock’s hands not steadying him but ready to, immediately, if needed.
, Sherlock. I’m talking about people being kept prisoner. If we can do something to help, that’s our priority.”
’ He thought, putting a hand to John’s forehead. He was feverish, though not enough to panic over. “We’re not remotely safe yet.” He spoke softly, eyes scanning for anything new, any injuries he hadn’t witnessed.
’ He managed to reach, and brought down his hand on both of Stewards. The orb fell to the floor with a heavy clunk.
“And his girlfriend, she wasn’t intimidated… she loved him more than even
“John.” Sebastian Moran greeted him warmly, and the first thing John noticed was the gas mask pulled back to rest on the man’s crown. “See you’re getting along comfortably.”
“As for walking around at night, would kipping in for a rest be safer? I doubt it. So we should move and get back to the airport quickly.”
Shifters.” After half a second to confirm, Sherlock continued. “You didn’t know that bit, either. There are two ways Shifters come about. The first is obvious; they are born. The second is something of a punishment doled out by the higher Seelie and Unseelie courts; a curse.
“Once she engages, give it back. It's easier for me to tell her off, she already thinks I'm a prat. And it's distracting you.”
Mormor will be a background thing but it will be a thing. It's coming. Don't worry.
It will probably be in a similar style of slow burn, case fic, interpersonal plot, as well as in a similar tone. I don’t think I’ll be inserting as much fantasy (the setting is already sci-fi) at least not in the one I’m currently working on.
“Mr Malone, I am to escort you out of doors. Follow me.” His voice had lost all countenance of respect, and John saw he was holding something small in his gloved hand. The spirit with his reached for it and withdrew again and again, with it’s twig-like fingers which protruded from a scratchy shirt stuffed with hay.
Kar’s laugh made John look at her, surprised. “I think you’re misunderstanding, Doctor Watson. Keya was not there for his benefit. The spirit protected its people. From themselves, perhaps, but it’s arrogant to think our protectors work on your behest.” She looked at John with the weary annoyance of having to explain such things to outsiders many times. “I will admit, where you are concerned, the canotila seem fonder than I’d expect. Though no, your partner does not inspire the same attitude.”
“Tell me what he said to you.” Sherlock’s voice was clear but weak in it's demands.
“I’m a bloody doctor, I can remove a brace on my own.”
John looked over at the detective, flummoxed. “Yeah. Not too happy they can’t, either.”
But John didn’t move, solid as he ever was. “Sherlock.” He raised his face to look, to be sure. His voice was still rolling off his tongue like gravel under heavy tires on a grid road. But he did not allow himself to feel relief. “We’re right here, we can’t leave them. If they’re sold, we won’t find them again.” He rasped, his face the terrifying calm which instilled chills in those wise enough to read it properly.
“No!”
“Yes, indeed. Though I regret to say I must keep him as he is for now. You can see he’s gone and hurt himself. If he changes around too much, it might scar.”
The action ramps up.
“So it was with his partners… they were engaging enough to stop him running around with anyone who caught his eye. Those three were a little

There, curled up enough so she only took up half the available space, was Strel.
Narrowing his eyes, the butler changed gears. “Were you sold at the last Fair Folk auction?”
“Hey. I don’t strictly understand, but I’m guessing I should be greatly offended.” John retorted.
John watched him, wrinkling his brow, and the animal reached forward and began running it’s fingers over John’s face. It was careful of the claws, the pads on its hands soft as satin, but that hardly made the experience less surreal.
of his weight, among other things. He even had on bracers that could be linked together like handcuffs.
“Not unlikely, it seems like it wouldn’t be helpful.”
THIS CHAPTER HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY REMOVED.
In the end, the case was spectacularly easy, especially comparatively. Blythe had given several names and contacts that his brother kept, those likely involved in the Shifter trade. Sherlock texted them off to Mycroft as soon as he was done with the collar, which left deep indents in Cennerous’ neck. And that Sherlock fastened around Blythe’s thick neck, with the quip ‘I’m sure someone will be along eventually to let you out.’
John was led out, wearing his ridiculous BDSM outfit, to meet Sherlock in the middle of the floor. Though it was unlikely anyone could see through the oni mask, Sherlock was sure to look down at his companion with a cold stare.
“That is inconsequential. It’s an interesting case, and one I assume would escalate, unsolved, in the hands of anyone else.”
“You… I really wish you’d talk to me. About this, about Bluebell, about… other things.” He spoke to himself quietly, scrubbing gently much longer than he needed to. He’d never really touched Sherlock’s hair much. It was kinda… nice.
“Right…” Lestrade barely started to say.
The ringing that clouded his hearing hid the crunch of dirt nearby, but did not conceal the whipping wind created by quick-spinning blades. Sherlock tried to deduce if it were friend or foe upon him, most likely the former as the sun was up and none had come to finish him off in the hours he had been trapped. He lay still anyway, to be safe, as he listened to the rotors slow after the landing.
What had finally convinced the irate detective was one sentence from John’s last nerve.
Mycroft looked over the childish doodle his brother had texted him, disregarding the airplane’s policy against using mobiles in the air. He huffed with disapproval and forwarded it.
The animal let out a sort of yipe or bark, then deeply frowned. John barely stifled a laugh, getting a more pronounced look of disapproval.
Sherlock began to share a look of camaraderie with John, but it was quickly undercut by another, harsher exclamation from the rabbit-shift. In the dim light of the hall, she had begun to have a bit of a shimmer around her. Sherlock’s mind recalled the description Kirsty had given of a fairy’s likeness and deemed it accurate.
It was actually making less and less sense to John as he went out to see Sherlock had bound the Frenchman’s wrists behind his back, and that he was not yet conscious. That didn’t bode well. John bent down to look him over, as he likely had a concussion.
“You haven't been reading any of these. She's included a link.” Sherlock nodded his head as in indication and John took his phone out. The article was already loaded once he opened his browser. “What is this?”
“Gone. I don’t know why. Suddenly he decided to run off and put out the fire.” Sherlock looked around the ruined hall. Even the guards were gone. “He took Bluebell.”
“It was a 50/50 shot.”
Sherlock, curled forward like a perturbed child and looking through his curls at his brother, didn’t react to John. Instead, he answered Mycroft’s silence. “Apologize, now.”
“If you weren't delayed trying to fetch it back…” Mycroft started, as John huffed and fell into his own chair.
John is in transit and tries to figure things out, and ignore how worried he is about Sherlock. He is in some ways successful.
“This is a terrible way to spend your last minute alive.”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed for a second. “More or less. What were you thinking?”
“You’re wrong, it’s our best option. Not only for this case, but for every case after. If I’m going to work with you-”
“Do you find you’re feeling a bit put off, working this case with me?” Sherlock asked, regarding her.
“There was a time I could, you know.” John looked at Sherlock with a cocky gaze. “Climb this without you, easier than you could, even.”
“I don’t… they let us go and we came out in a field in the Irish countryside. That’s the best I can do, I don’t know where they kept us. I spoke to your son, but as another prisoner.”
John looked from Sherlock to Blythe, interested in how this was going. “Well?”
John complied. The sensation of
Sherlock locked his phone and replaced it in his pocket. He suspected DI Lestrade had been ordered by his brother to keep tabs on him, and the case was just a means to that end. But he couldn’t be sure, either. He looked up and over to Bluebell and Kirsty, who were supervising and climbing a tree, respectively. He replaced his gloves against the chill, just as his phone buzzed again. He ignored it for the moment.
“Come on. I’m done, I have a lot to tell you.”
John felt the rush of air and things seemed to return to normal as the sprite danced around him, and his body felt suddenly very heavy. He took his hand back to steady himself as he intentionally fell backwards on his arse. He leaned forwards, pushing his face into his hands and breathing slowly.
“Or, alternatively… Kat?” Sherlock looked down at her through the mask, angling his head just so to let the light through, making his eyes sparkle.
“She had to. Everything I needed to know about your world, I learned from her.” Sour, Sherlock closed his eyes and tried to ignore the distances he was creating.
“Right. Anything I can do?”
It was a map drawn in the dirt, the style something akin to an old parchment you’d see in a museum. John didn’t recognize any of the markers on it, and the coastlines even seemed… wrong, somehow.
More giggling, for fucks sake, and then everything faded into the pain that locked him inside his body.
Sherlock blew a huff out his nose and walked swiftly up the stairs. He found John sitting on the edge of the tub, his thick trousers off (he wore a light pair underneath as cushioning) and working on removing the brace that was obviously digging into him hard after all the strain.
John turned, and the man grabbed his face by the chin. He flinched, but kept control of his reflexes.
He ushered both child and man who acts like one into the flat quickly.
John came over and continued checking Bluebell. “So that’s your brother, hm? You’re not responsible for him. What do you think he was doing in here?”
Reaching into all of this was very upsetting to John, who had long since left it all behind. He watched Sherlock, who paced the kitchen as he placed an order over the phone. He insisted on always doing it himself, even when he wasn’t eating. Unless he wasn’t paying attention, and then he just passive aggressively sulked around or pointed out some mistake, related or not, John had recently made.
John pushed himself up and stood. “She’s
“You said you knew who did it.”
“Anytime, love.”
“Yeah?” John crossed his arms and put his weight on his good leg. “Why’s that?” When, after a moment of silence, it was clear there’d be no answer, John’s frown deepened. “I have to. Bluebell can’t drink any longer, she needs a fluids IV drip. I can’t kludge one, I need to go fetch it.” He studied Sherlock carefully, but there was nothing he could pick up on. “Unless you can give me some valid reason I can’t, I’m going to get one as soon as I’m able.”
“Nothing to be done about it now.” John sighed, putting a hand on his hip and turning his head down. “I’ll deal with it.”
“That won’t matter to
Sherlock frowned now. He wanted to play, but he really didn’t have the time. “Wrong?”
.” John dropped his chin and bore into Mycroft with his eyes, crossing his arms.
Still somewhat mindful of what was happening, Bluebell nodded. She didn’t ask any questions. Odd.
Sherlock looked up, his ‘I’m on a case, John’ expression in full possession of his face. “Getting one step ahead of Moriarty, finding the link to the center of his web, is my priority.”
John started over towards Sherlock, worried because he’d taken a blow to the head. He stumbled on the way and put a hand to his head, the other to the wall, and slid down onto his haunches as he tried to fight off the dizzy spell swimming behind his eyes.
“Why is this one smaller?” She asked, gently prodding the bullet’s entry wound. Nobody had done that since the last time a doctor who wasn’t him changed the gauze on the original injury.
John, on the other hand, was focussed entirely on the now. While Moran, the patrons, and presumably any staff were distracted, he slid the gun out of the pocket of Sherlock’s coat. Raising it with one quick, efficient motion, he levelled the gun at Moran, center mass, and pulled the trigger.
Lestrade pondered that. “I never knew John before I knew him around Sherlock. Was he really that different before going overseas?”
Sherlock didn’t ask, either. He just got out of the car and walked quickly so he could open the door for them.
TRIGGER WARNING!
Please let me know if you'd read a continuation.
“Did he say which ones he’s found?”
-The two arrive back in London and go to Bart's to look into the case Lestrade told them about
“I don’t know who you are. Who is your son?” John answered.
“Consultant.” He muttered, looking around and determining he needed to get inside for anything relevant. He sidestepped Lestrade.
The oddest thing though, was that Sherlock had come in about a half hour after he’d been there… right as John was in the middle of shaving, with a bundle of his own. He looked annoyingly smug when he came into sight in the mirror, chin up, and told John he looked much better clean shaven before claiming rights to the next shower.
After going through the blueprints in his head, Sherlock found his path. He slowly released John and helped him stand, eyes never leaving their enemy.
“How was mummy’s aloe?” Bluebell swept lightly past him and took Kirsty’s hand, talking breezily to her as they went out to the garden together, leaving Sherlock with his cooling tea, abandoned biscuit, and deductions.
“Oookay.” Bluebell stepped forward. “Are you maybe going to… elaborate on that?”
“She-”
“There is no record of the lighthouse belonging to anyone other than the local governing body or the settling people who built it. Whoever is in there, they’re playing things close to the chest.” Sherlock closed his laptop, tented his fingers, and took in his flatmate’s weary visage. “I suggest we break in.”
“John.” The familiar voice was frantic, hands moving over his throat to his face, pinching open his watering eyes to examine him. “John, it’s me. Breathe.”
“Obviously. And you’re now employed here as what, the nanny?”
. (Rather, Mrs Hudson was the recipient. It hadn’t been easy to get her to part with it.)
“Why bring him here at all, then?” John’s face darkened.
“Yeah…” John’s only connection to the human world out here was Sherlock. He decided mentally to never try speaking to the fae unless he was close by. Clearing his throat, he turned to the cat. It seemed to be amused, watching this. “You have my gratitude. But we should go.”
“Morgue. Or what passes around here.” Sherlock replied curtly as he pulled his coat collar up against the brisk fall air that blew powerfully around them.
stay.
“Don’t.” Sherlock grumbled.
Then he knew where Sherlock had gone, because he knocked the Frenchman over the head and took the device before settling him on the floor.
Narrowing his eyes and scowling, Sherlock tsked. “Don’t fuck around with me, John, I know better than most you require the drug to survive withdrawal this intense. As things are now, she will die.”
“Holmes.” Sherlock finished for her, standing up straight and turning to the small young woman who had come from the house. She had a plain sort of brown hair, but with oddly spaced bits of a much lighter color. As if her hairdresser was attempting to mottle it. Sherlock let his mouth turn up a twinge. He’d been right in one. He processed her (
John just barely stopped himself saying ‘thank you’ to the spirit. Instead, he just told her this was fine for this mark, and they would go to the next soon. Seeming satisfied, she flew back to the trees and flickered out of sight before reaching them.
He managed to put a shaking hand to the wound, not feeling the site where the knife had gone in any longer, and raised it to his muddied vision. By contrast to his gloves, it was hard to tell, but the feeling was slick. Even a moment’s touch brought a worrying amount of wetness.
“Such as luminescent rabbits?” Sherlock coughed, trying to turn his face out of the dust he was inhaling.
Andrea stepped forward, her heels clicking like a defined metronome, and the familiar (Basil apparently) reached out with its surprisingly long arm and took the pouch. John wondered what that looked like to the Holmes’, who were Sight-less.
“I’ve got it, boys. Don’t worry about it, just rest your leg dear.”
“Yeah.” Still uncomfortable, John adjusted his stance yet again. “Why have you changed into… that? And you’re not demanding something. You’re asking. Politely.”
Sherlock pushed away the image of Bluebell on the plane, and what she'd told him about the intimacy and vulnerability of shifting. It wouldn't help anyone.
The detective definitely noticed, but he didn’t say anything even though the top was up now, and they could have talked if they wanted to.
Sherlock started to scoff, but stopped and shared a look with the rabbit-shift.
(See the end of the chapter for
John groaned into his hands, unable to look at himself any longer. “I’m a licensed doctor, I’m a veteran Captain of the British Forces, I’m a fearsome werewolf…”
“Promise.” Sherlock absently stroked the rabbit, mostly with the cast, deep in his own mind.
“Is your sister alright? Is anyone injured?”
Out on the road, after about ten minutes of driving at high speeds, Sherlock pulled over into a disused drive. He turned to John and took off his shades.
Sherlock struggles with his shift, and with Bluebell unable to help, John turns to someone Sherlock is far less comfortable with...
Shifting his weight to jut out a hip with a huff of air through his nose, John raised a brow and smirked though Mycroft couldn’t see him over the phone. “Really? You don’t need to put on airs for me.” He remarked in a faux-sweet tone. Exactly as he’d hoped, he could hear Mycroft’ breathing change as his feathers ruffled the wrong direction.
“You damn lucky bastard.”
Panic rising up as what John suspected was a side effect of the Bakkakarlinns touch, he grabbed the cane tightly and swung it out around his legs. “Fuck off!” He bellowed.
“No…” Bluebell sat up straight. “I certainly am not. And I’m not here to find John, not entirely. I’m here to find kidnapped Shifters. There’s been an enormous spike in abductions in our community over the last ten or so years. But as you’ve said, I can’t find them on my own. You can.”
He felt he’d been improving, as he’d remained human all day thus far. Now he’d snuck out to sniff out the murderer, quite literally. The same tickling Shifter scent he’d honed in on at the crime scene was amongst the tumult of smells in the angry mob that morning. There were only a few hundred Shifters in the village, and based on the order in which the rabble had gathered in relation to the first inklings of the familiar scent to Sherlock… well, only a few dozen households could play host to the particular party he sought.
With a huff of resignation, Lestrade thinned his lips and furrowed his brow all the same as he turned instead for the door.
Sherlock hauled John up slowly, the doctor digging his feet into crags where he could find them to scramble towards safety.
The walk across the glen to the apparition of his brother was slow as Sherlock stepped carefully on the dew-laden grass and moss, his arm supporting John. The army doctor was set and determined, he leaned on Sherlock for help but not nearly as much as the detective thought he should.
“Thank you.”
Breathing carefully in the wake of the experience he’d just gone through, John held on and looked credulously up at Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I think he just didn’t want to assume.” John told the spirit, though it just stuck up it’s nose in reply. “She wants more compensation, and she said something about a heron…”
The girl, Mads apparently, smiled and didn't hesitate to come right up and investigate the scars both front and back of John’s shoulder. It was still quite stiff some days, and both his shifting and being restrained brought out some old aches he'd been done with for some time.
“LeCoup.”
When they finally got their shit together enough to leave for Iceland, Sherlock couldn’t get out of the flat fast enough. The little Shifter seemed to prefer him, for reasons he didn’t understand, to John or Mrs Hudson. It wasn’t as if she was crawling over him or asking him a million questions. If fact, he often forgot she was there. Until he looked up, basically at any time, including right as he woke up. Then he had her deep, inquisitive eyes staring at him.
“I do notice.” Sherlock mumbled, turning away to take in his city. All this work outside of it put him out of step with the particular rhythm London possessed. No matter the other changes, London was a constant. He did entertain the thought of even glancing at Lestrade’s case. He let out a frustrated sigh, all of this couldn’t finish up soon enough. He wanted back to his flat, his violin, and his people where they belonged; John with him, Mrs Hudson tutting around in the background, Mycroft… out of his hair and too busy to spy on him.
Taking in and cataloging the looks and movements and ticks of John for closer examination later, Sherlock blinked, decided on the wisest course, and opened his mouth. “He wanted it for himself.” Putting his hands behind himself and folding them meticulously there, Sherlock stood properly and felt his height. He spoke down to John like a parent or teacher, and knew only partially it was to offset the tension of the stakes of this tale. John didn’t seem to notice, or if he did, mind. The familiarity of explaining locked in and Sherlock became more sturdy as he went on. “He has such deep disregard for life, significantly for his own, so he procured Fairy Ointment and went about raising the displeasure of, I believe he said, the Seelie court. I supposed he must have been distracted or showing off as he was notably surprised by the outcome in addition to his great displeasure. I went in search of his knowledge of Bluebell’s condition, as I’d said.” Lowering his chin and calculatedly softening his features, he finished his report. “I did not intend to become cursed, nor did I passively allow it. I was physically unable to anticipate it.” He tapped beside his eyes to illustrate his point, to be especially clear. Then he replaced his hand behind his back and waited.
Sherlock’s smile came back, curling. “She was unexpectedly helpful on that case. You rather liked that one.” He picked up his violin again and his voice began to drip with superiority, “What ever became of her?”
“Sher-!”
“Well you need to learn, it’s irritating at best and enormously dangerous at worst to have you unstable like this. Not to mention I do have enough data to predict the longer this goes on, the more horrid you’ll be as a flatmate. You can’t trust yourself enough to do things that take time or concentration.” Now he wasn’t practically in John’s lap, Sherlock’s nudity was just another quirk. It wasn’t as if he didn’t wander in sheets or a dressing gown or towel and nothing else long before now. The difference was he had a fair reason to stay unclad. John knew from experience how uncomfortable it was to Shift and shed with clothing involved. No, the more annoying side-effect of his tremulous state was he’d been unable to use nicotine patches reliably, and had a constant need for them, so he’d taken to sucking on a pipe he’d hidden long ago in an odd, curl-toed slipper at the back of the front closet. It was a funny image, well enough, but it wasn’t a pleasant scent. And he didn’t seem to realize it was in poor taste to use an addictive drug so openly while someone else in the flat was going through hellish withdrawal. But teaching his detective consideration of others was hardly John’s concern at the moment.
“No.” Another voice called down the stairs at the end of the hall, from which the creature had emerged. “More like a guard dog.”
The detective came in behind him, shirt and bow tie undone. “Oh good, it fits. Don’t look at me like that, this society regards Shifters like glamorous pets. And you won’t be wearing it long.”
