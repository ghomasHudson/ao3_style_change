Sam puts a hand up, stopping Steve from going further, grin on his face. “Steve, shut up man. I’ve seen you get like this only once, and that was with Peggy. You ain’t foolin me and when I tell Bucky all about this he’s just gonna agree with me.”
Steve decides then and there that this boy is going to be his friend and he waits for him, the man leaving with a dismissive wave as he walks over to his very
At 11.30am Steve walks in. Tony is not in the office, and Steve who had opened his mouth to begin his speech, shuts it so fast the camera picks up the sound of his teeth clicking together.
“Getting to be with you the last 3 years has been some of the best years of my life, and I’m including all that time in the ‘20s,” Steve says, looking at Tony whose eyes are starting to mist. “You’re the most amazing, beautiful,
that look in your eyes and I will actually melt your shield into a trash can lid if you give me another
The department heads file out of the conference room not too long after, murmuring to each other about the new developments.
Nat comes limping into the living room a few hours later and spots them both asleep on the couch, Tony’s hand in Steve’s hair and Steve’s hand on Tony’s well -
Clearing his throat, Bucky grabs Sam’s arm and says, “We’re gonna go check out some art. Coming Nat?”
Bruce’s entire face goes red and he makes an aborted motion like he wants to flee. No one else in the office even blinks.
about you Tony,” Sam continues. “In fact, I may be billing you my hourly rates for all the sessions Steve here has-“
Tony looks up from the papers strewn about his desk, his glasses sliding a little down his nose before he pushes them back up with his index finger. “Uhm, Rho- Mr. Rhodes isn’t here right now,” voice clear of any emotion. “You’ll have to come back later if you want to talk to him.”
Steve nods, cutting up his waffles into bite sized pieces. “Yeah well, he didn’t exactly say no way but he brought up the fact that he’s here to cut the budget like I was stupid to not know what their job is a-“
“Unsurprising, seeing as all you had to eat yesterday was a packet of blueberries and my entire pot of coffee.”
Sam and Bucky step out, and make their way over to them. “Hiya punk,” Bucky greets before looking Tony up and down.
“Nothing is going on. Tony and I are friends, that’s it. And he’s gonna head back soon so nothing is ever gonna be going on. And that’s fine too, it’s not like I want to date him,” he eventually says, not looking at Sam.

and there won’t be a day that goes by that I’ll let you forget it, if you’ll have me. So, Tony Stark, will you do me the honour of marrying me?”
Steve stretches out his hand to Tony, grinning down at him. “Up, lazybones! We’re trying to reach the top before sunrise not sunset.”
decided it and I was in full support when I realised you listen to it every single time we come back from a date,” Steve informs him and Tony feels his face heat.
And maybe it’s the lights sparkling overhead, or the 2 glasses of wine he had, or the knowing curve of Bruce’s smile he shoots at Tony when he dances pass with Thor, or the
after he had left - to find Tony sitting at their kitchen counter, cradling a mug of coffee to his chest and wearing one of Steve’s shirts, he just about melts to the floor.
There’s a slight quirk to Tony’s lip when he says, “Nat’s going to kill you if she has to ask SHIELD for a drop off. She’s still fuming at Fury over last time.”
The diamond wasn’t too big but it wasn’t too small either and it had a strange tint of blue in it that made it seem like it was glowing. It was beautiful and absolutely perfect for Tony.
“Due to this, every department will be facing budget cuts up of at least 20% and effective immediately any projects in the works will be scrapped or put on hold until further notice.”
“Baby, stop okay- you’re right, you’re big and strong and I’m sorry if I ever insinuated otherwise, so why don’t you just give me -”
They both grin at each other before saluting Steve, who rolls his eyes, and tell Tony they’ll catch up with him later before sauntering off hand in hand.
But today is definitely not the day to ask so they continue to watch/argue and in the morning before Tony wakes up, he cleans up the rose petals from the table and floor.
“Now who am I to argue with signs like that?” Steve says, pulling the covers over them, their conversation drifting off with the waning moon.
“Well, I just wanted to do something special for you,” Steve says pulling him closer and tucking Tony into his chest, partly so he doesn’t see the sting of tears in Steve’s eyes and mostly just so he can hold Tony.
The whole office with the exception of Clint shout, “No!” while the latter shouts, “See it was him!”
He slams the door with his foot and Steve winces. “Well, I’ll carry this one and you can get the smaller one!”
He looks, eyes darting up and around the man to stare at Steve who must have a silly look on his face because the boy looks a little shocked and his ears go red but there’s a smile, there and gone before he quickly looks back down at his feet.
Tony huffs, “Is this another one of your things about making sure I eat? Because I’ve been eating! Semi-regularly!”
There’s a light in Tony’s eyes that warms him to his core, the colours of sunset bathing them in soft colours and Steve wills his palms to stop sweating as he traces ‘
Steve just got out of the shower while Tony was just done getting dressed. He looks adorable in his red sweater that stretch past his knuckles and it has a Rudolph stitched into the front with a red bobble for the nose and it honestly should be ugly but as always, Tony just makes it endearing.

[Shot of the camera in the bathroom, catching Steve standing in front of the mirror, hands on his hips and smiling awkwardly at himself. “Well, I think it’s time we harvest the rewards,” he says and shoots finger guns.
He blows out the candle before then promptly taking it out and smears the cupcake into Steve’s face that frosting goes up his nose.
In between preparing for the harvest fest, Steve spends the remainder of his time waiting outside the doors of Tony and Rhodes’ office.
“Hi, sleepyhead,” Tony smiles down at him, kissing his brow. “You were having a nightmare. Thought I’d bring you out of it.”
“Did you get us presents?” Harley asks into Tony’s shirt at the same time Peter asks, “How’d the conference go?”

He makes a face at the camera when Tony angles the phone again and Tony doesn’t even notice until he looks at the picture.
Steve smiles, kissing between Tony’s brow before moving to the bathroom. “Do you want me to fill the tub or just start up the shower?”
He loves Tony when it’s 4pm and they’re both tired from work followed by their classes, and Tony calls him from the lab with

Steve gives a small laugh at that before jerking to where everyone is, huddled around the fire Bucky and Rhodes have got a flame going, “Wanna head back up?”
Steve isn’t really too bothered by it as much as Tony is, arguing with them that they should get a cut off the money cause as he looks at Tony’s smile that’s he now carries with him on his lock screen, his laughter

- god, he’s so relieved he thinks he’s shaking - and he nearly lifts Tony off his feet when he starts kissing back.
He’s currently pacing up and down the floors of Tony’s office. “One of the vendors pulled out at the last minute. Oh god, what if it starts a chain reaction and slowly but surely all of the others start to pull out and then there’ll be no booths at the festival which wouldn’t even make it a festival! It’ll just be a bunch of people standing around on the grass, going hungry and restless and then they’ll start a mob and call for my head on a spike and then-“
Rhodes shakes his hand with his left, the right still holding his coffee mug, before dropping back down onto his seat, “You can lose the formalities man, as of 10 minutes ago we’re all of the clock so it’s James. Everyone calls me that except for that little twerp over there”

There’s a look in Tony’s eye he can’t decipher before the other man grabs his arms and starts leading him towards his painting and
but he also has his own mini library with a reading nook that he goes in whenever he wants some peace and quiet.
He repeats the words a few times before Steve’s eyes flutter open, his voice like a scratch when he says, “Tony?”
“And I know you said you’re nervous, but you really have nothing to be nervous about Steve. You’re incredibly talented and you’re gonna get an exorbitant amount of money thrown at you from all these stuffy art snobs bidding on your work.”

Tony has been subtly looking at Bucky’s metal arm since he sat down but not subtle enough because Bucky tells him, “You can go ahead and ask. I’m not shy about it much no more.”
Steve tries to say something back but his mouth just feels bone dry at the moment and he has to clear his throat to choke out a simple, “Yeah, baby. I really,
“If the both of you don’t stop screaming, I’m going to throw you in a vat of this stuff,” Nat hisses at them, picking the substance from her hair.
Says, “Do you think we could get away with showering together or will that be pushing it?” instead of everything he does want to say.
“Yes it is,” Fury says, already walking out the door and not looking behind to see if Tony is following him.

“After reviewing all your departments closely these last 5 days, James and I have come up with plans for each of your departments on where to make these slashes,” Tony says as Rhodes hands out a file to every department head. “We know that it seems harsh, but it is necessary to keep your town afloat. If you have any comments to make about our master plan, you can schedule a meeting with James and I,” Tony says before he and Rhodes leave.

“Courtesy of the best bakery in New York,” Steve tells him, holding out the cupcake. “Bucky’s kitchen.”
that has him home at midnight and awake before 6.30AM but it does help Steve understand his less than cheery demeanour.
“The wedding was gorgeous, don’t you think,” Tony says, swinging their arms by their intertwined pinkies.
Back before they started dating, spotting Tony wrapped up in it would fill him with an irrational jealousy despite knowing that Tony and Rhodes aren’t together -
They make it to the top of Eagle Hill at 5.16am, exactly 11 minutes before the sun is set to come up over the town they are now overlooking.
“I know you do,” Tony says, turning his head so Steve can hear him, “but I don’t think it’s healthy for you to-”
Steve shrugs. “Maybe! There's a lot of history in this one! I just- you can’t just waltz in here and-“
“Yeah, I’m sure you’re real torn up over having an excuse to hole up in your lab to finish off the Mark 56,” Bucky drawls, flicking at Tony’s head as he heads to the fridge.
James “Bucky” Barnes is lounging in the chair of Steve’s office, spinning around in the seat absentmindedly when Fury walks in.
“We gotta wash up or we’re gonna be stuck together,” Steve says eventually though he makes no move to get up.
“Thor’s dad is a real piece of work though,” Tony continues. “Bruce practically turned green when Nat came to tell us that he showed up.”
Steve snorts. “I don’t think I’m even gonna be allowed near him anymore. His partner was there too and basically kicked me out after I called him heartless.”
The villa in Ostia that Tony’s mother had given them as a wedding present was gorgeous, the view of the moonlight on the water a perfect backdrop for their nights spent as husbands.
Tony comes closer to him and says, “Though cooking me my mom’s Carbonara on the anniversary of her death seems a little on the nose even for you,” he says, giving Steve a small smile. “You’re usually subtler than this.”
and Steve is smiling at him so fondly, hand outstretched and Tony’s heart kinda feels like it’s about to
He grabs the materials and brings them over to the attached sink in the room to clean them, looking at the disgusting black swirl that goes down the drain when he dumps out the water.
He’s standing by the kitchen before it comes to him and he’s off like a shot up the stairs, nearly bowling people over in his haste.
There are a lot of emotions swirling through Steve’s brain right now but at the forefront, it’s definitely
The entire parks department is on the chopping block if the harvest festival fails, a collateral damage offer that was given not by Rhodes but Steve.

Tony doesn’t fare much better but he drops Steve’s hand and turns away hastily, resuming their trek. “Come on, Rogers! What were you just sassing at me? Sunrise not sunset!”
Steve grins back at him before placing Morgan onto his shoulders and yelling, “Alright, let’s see who can hug Dad the fastest!”
The camera focuses on a sign proclaiming “Lee’s Diner” but the apostrophe has come loose and is hanging upside down. Fury and Tony enter, sliding into a booth a few spaces from the door.
“There better be a vegetable somewhere in there,” Steve says, not entirely jokingly as he moves to stand to Tony’s left and bumps into Rhodes.
Tony sighs. “We’re not just sleeping together. We’re dating, technically.” He narrows his eyes at Fury, pointing his fork at him. “How did you find out?”
He says something to Bruce who then hugs him whilst glaring in Steve’s general direction and Thor joins in on the hug, nearly engulfing the two men.
- smiles on their lips, casual touches that always make Tony’s smile go tight around these people who are
Tony’s surprise turns out to be a drone show spelling out “Happy birthday Steve” across the skyline before rearranging to write out “I love you.”
Tony looks up from where he's hunched over his desk, scribbling away over numbers but a calculator is nowhere in sight and neither is Rhodes.
“You need to turn it off or I’m going to go nuts,” Tony garbles from where he’s laying face down on the couch.
A lean man with white hair comes up behind Clint and startles him. “What, you didn’t see that coming Hawkman?”
- and Tony’s had a rough week, spending whatever spare time in the lab to finish up his final project which thankfully, he submitted yesterday.
“He always agrees with you,” Steve says mulishly. “It doesn’t matter if I think Tony is attractive anyway. He’s just here until the budget is fixed then he’s gone. Nothing’s gonna happen and I don’t even want it to.”
Though, in recent times, he finds Steve down there with him more often than not, sitting on the couch sketching or playing fetch with DUM-E while Tony tinkers with equipment for the team.
“Tony, I knew I loved you from the moment I met you. These last 3 years have been the happiest years of my life and the very idea of ever ending
“I’m a little busy right now and I don’t really handle much of your department’s business anymore s-“
They’re on the beach having a bonfire night - though Steve suspects that Clint just wants to eat S’mores without judgement since he’s hogging all the supplies. Thankfully, Sam had packed
He loves Tony when it’s 9pm and they’re curled up on the bed and he’s running his hands through Steve’s hair as they unwind from their day, mindlessly scrolling and sharing funny posts with each other.
“Okay!” Steve cuts him off, hands clapping together in front of him loudly, “can you both be useful maybe and help out with the stage? Thank you!”
He stifles a laugh into his hand but Mr. Vanko’s hearing is scary good and he always seems to have it out for Tony anyway so he turns away from the chalkboard to glare at where Tony sits.
But when he shows up to practice, already making his way over to where the cheerleaders are to say hello and maybe steal a kiss, he thinks that Tony is trying to put him in an early

“At least it isn’t corrosive,” Bruce says, coming up from the labs. The Hulk hadn’t been needed but Bruce looks
Steve shakes his head, a small smile on his lips. “Nah, I know you’re not. For one, you’re still here, helping out all the departments over minuscule things even though you and Rhodes have completed everything you came here to do a week ago.”
“You asked me what I was still doing here last night! And since you can’t wait for me to get out of town I thought I might as well get to it ASAP,” Tony says, voice rising causing Steve to wince.
“We have to head back to DC soon,” Rhodes tells Tony, tipping his head back and staring up at the ceiling. “We were only supposed to be here for, at most, 2 months and it’s been almost 3 now.”
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve tells him, but indulges him anyway because saying no to Tony when he’s looking at Steve
“James is my best friend’s name too but he doesn’t respond to it. It’s nice to finally meet you, I-”
Tony grins, “Yeah, Thor’s been crushing pretty hard and Brucie’s been locked away in his lab for an unhealthy amount of time - and if
“These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings,” Steve says, voice steadily rising.
“Of course I made it,” Tony says, punching Steve lightly on the arm. “I wasn’t about to miss your birthday, old man!”
Steve looks around at them, this group of chaos he gets to call family - albeit, with a missing piece,- smiles softly to himself before dusting off the sand clinging to his jeans and heads to the shoreline.
Steve frowns harder, putting the plate back in the microwave and setting it to 50 seconds before moving to stand in front of Tony. “What’s wrong?”
Fury has already kickstarted the grills and is preparing all the meat along with Stan and his workers who are generously sponsoring the main meal of cheeseburgers. Rhodes had gone over to help them.
I don’t want - Hey, Tony,” Steve says, walking forward and cupping both of Tony’s cheeks so he can look into his eyes. “Baby, I don’t know what’s been going on in that head of yours, but
Tony stares at the paint brushes that are drying out with paint stuck to the handles and the metal mixing palette that had dark swirls of colours coming together that just look like black to him and the plastic container of water that actually is
Like 3 nights ago, when they had been curled up on the couch together under the blankets and drinking eggnog, Home Alone playing on the television and the lights from the Christmas tree casting a warm glow around the room and the ring was safely tucked away in Steve’s pajama pants. It was peaceful and perfect yet he still hadn’t asked. Every time he tried, it was like the words got stuck in his throat and he must have made some sort of sound because Tony had looked over in concern. Steve had just brushed it off and pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead and they just continued watching Kevin set up his traps.
The police department also arrive, the officers who volunteered to provide security for the festival beginning to set up roadblocks and perimeters around the park.
Steve’s face goes red, his pale skin not aiding in his predicament despite the dim light of twilight.
“You don’t even know me, Rogers. Stop acting like you do just because you’ve happened to see me do my [bleep] job,” Tony says.
is untrustworthy and the wild card of the team — a liability. I should have just stuck to those cards,” he says all in a rush, and he’s blinking rapidly, staring up at Steve now with wide eyes like he can’t believe he’d just said any of it at all.
Tony laughed before falling onto Steve and crashing on the floor with a shout of “Yes, you idiot! Oh my god oh my god!”
of the evening wasn’t evident on his face before, it definitely is now because Tony is staring at the ring, eyes wide and mouth slack.
“No one can verify this for sure but Natasha hasn’t said anything to make us believe otherwise,” Thor says, standing next to Bruce.
Steve smiled up at him. “Well, the deal is that you gotta be a Rogers. So, Tony Stark, would you make me the happiest man on earth and marry me? In exchange for looking good in Christmas sweaters?”
Tony seems to be weighing his options of asking Steve to just leave or straight bolting out of his office himself before his face becomes unreadable and makes a go on gesture.
Tony doesn’t answer for a while, both him and Bucky sitting in silence and watching the ducks float around the pond.
“Ugh, you’re an angel,” Steve says, opening up the microwave. He pulls out the plate and frowns. “You cooked chicken tikka?”
“I’m still eating that tiramisu but you better wipe down that ring before putting it on my finger,” Tony tells him, and Steve dutifully wipes the ring down with the cloth the jeweller provided him with.
“Mr. Rogers,” Rhodes says, voice polite but eyes cold, “if you wish to talk further about your idea, please schedule an appointment in the near future,
“Yeah, like right now I’m reading this book about gravity. It’s proven impossible to put down,” Tony tries and for a moment there’s only silence - just Neils’ voice drawling in the background - before he
you a hero? No, Tony Stark has been a hero long before he was Iron Man,” Steve says, turning Tony’s head towards him so he can look into his eyes.
When Natasha walks into the office, everyone gathers around her and starts singing Happy Birthday, corralling her into the chair by the main desk.
Steve stays crouched in front of Tony’s chair until his breathing goes back to normal and his eyes don’t look so glassy, filled instead with resignation and despondence and Steve
Tony stares at him with a look so full of love with the flickering of the flame reflecting in his eyes that all the air rushes out of Steve’s lungs.

Steve takes a breath and Tony thinks he sees condensation when he exhales. “I can’t move, I can’t scream, I’m - I’m just
The easel is facing a blank wall, where Jarvis projects the videos and there are paints and brushes strewn all over the table beside it.
Trying to pry his pillow away from Tony was considerably easy since he barely even moved and come morning, he just gave a small
“Thanks for coming everyone,” she says, smiling at them before wandering off to a group of women by the bar, her gown swaying behind her.
Tony’s hands are fidgeting, his fingernails plucking at the skin of his nail beds and Steve doesn’t even think about it when he reaches over to pry them apart.
“Yeah, we Rogers’ sold our souls to look good in these. You want in on the deal?” Steve asked, wincing at how weird the proposal sounded.
Steve seems to be panicking but is trying very hard not to let it show. He’s failing rather spectacularly at that.
Steve doesn’t say anything to that, just kisses the top of Tony’s head and thinks about the ring hidden in the back of his sock drawer.
He grins when they get to the door, placing the boxes just outside before sweeping Tony up, carrying him over the threshold.
He’s gotten used to Steve’s smile and his laughter, the way he lights up a room with it and makes him feel
“Yes, well I was actually referring to Rogers,” Fury says and then tries not to grin when Tony chokes on his drink.
in his office, Rhodes is often there with him and whenever either of them see him hovering by the door, it is always Rhodes who greets and sees to him. Tony then either goes to the back room adjoined with their office or simply leaves altogether without so much as a nod in Steve’s direction.
Stan comes out of the kitchen just then and places Fury’s usual, fills up Tony’s coffee mug before heading off to another customer.
He knows that Tony taps at his arc reactor surreptitiously whenever he needs reassurance or whenever someone likes to bring up SI’s
Tony isn't ashamed for his love of Taylor in the slightest, having met her a few times and attended a few shows, but there’s just something —
“Our investigation has shown us that things here in SHIELD are far worse than we were led to believe,” Rhodes says before gesturing at Tony to continue.
“Who broke it?” Fury asks the office, all of whom are gathered around the broken remains of a coffee maker. It is smashed almost beyond recognition.
“Hey sweetheart, you’re early,” Steve says into his hair, carefully holding onto Morgan as she attempts to climb from him to Tony.
“Why the hell not? It’s the truth,” and Steve hasn’t really finished that sentence before he has an armful of Tony Stark, face tucked into the crook of Steve’s neck.
He continues reading for a bit - The Turner House, a pretty good read - before calling it a night, Jarvis dimming the lights as he places a kiss on Tony’s cheek before settling in behind him.
“Mr. Carbonell, I see your without your usual limpet today,” Fury says when he spots Tony sitting at the booth in Lee’s.
Neither does Tony, because his leg starts to bounce. You wouldn’t be able to tell though because his voice is as steady as ever when he answers, “I know I make an impression but Victor and I were never
Tony jerks out of a dreamless sleep, wide awake in a darkened room, illuminated only by the sliver of moonlight slipping on through the curtains.
Currently, Steve is hiding behind the potted plant in the hall a few feet away from their office. His blonde hair and broad shoulders are sticking out very visibly.
He loves Tony when it’s 10am and he comes into the coffee shop when they’re both on break and Tony is there with a mug waiting for him.
“What? You’re gonna come over to eat my food so now I’m stealing yours,” Steve tells him. “Listen, you’re coming over today. Ma can be scary when she wants to be and not even your dad can stop her.”
[Shot of Fury in his office, watching the chaos from behind his desk. “It was me. It burned my hand so retaliation was swift. They’ll be at each other’s throats soon.”
Steve grabs the bottle of maple syrup on the table and shakes it, “My idea was good! And he shot it down! Just like that!” He pours a torrent of syrup onto his waffles. “He wants this town to fail. He wants to ruin us,” he says, venom in his voice.
“Does your boyfriend know you flirt with people like this? And also, how did you possibly get a boyfriend with lines like that?”
Pink dusts Tony’s cheeks, and he clears his throat, “So Rogers, what’s this idea you have that’s lead to the demolition of our door?”
around the diner and the feel of him where they’re pressed side to side in the cramped booth, he knows who really won.
They’d all dispersed shortly after the last veggie dumplings were eaten — stolen, really— by Natasha.
“Interesting that you’d immediately shoot down his confession Nat,” Clint says. “You not letting someone else take your blame?”
The boy watches him leave before making his way over to Steve, shoulders still hunched but not staring at the pavement anymore. “Hi. You - you didn’t have to wait for me.”
He takes in Tony’s position on Rhodes’ lap and his face turns an alarming shade of red. “Uh sorry! I should have- I’m- I just wanted to- lunch- but clearly your-bye” is what he manages to say before closing the door with a slam.
“Well, when you figure out how to do that, why don’t you let me know so we can all go plant flowers in the parks and read to the woodland creatures,” Tony says, voice mocking before starting to walk off.
Steve gives an exasperated sigh but he’s not really that bothered, especially in the face of Tony’s attempt to look innocent. “I knew you only liked me for my pancake flipping abilities.”
Steve’s eyes are wide, soaked through waffles forgotten on his plate. “I didn’t- I ju- I was just excited- in the hall he was so condescending and then I went to my thinking place and then it came to me and I just had to rub it in you know he- he thinks it can’t be done and he- he’s just so-”
They fly to Florence in the morning, but for tonight they’re wandering the streets after eating their filling of ravioli and having
“Ignore this moron, he has no brain to mouth filter gorgeous,” Sam says with a grin. “I’m Sam and this is Bucket.”
“A good morning indeed,” Tony replies, turning in Steve’s embrace, moving his arms up to rest on Steve’s shoulder. “What do you want for breakfast and why is it pancakes?”
Steve sighs, wondering just how long Tony is going to be mad at him for his slip of tongue, putting up his hand in thanks to the driver who waits for them to cross to their new apartment.
“Okay,” Rhodes cuts in, the atmosphere in the room doing a complete 180. Tony doesn’t move, eyes unblinking.
She snaps a picture and posts it to both Instagram and Twitter with the hashtag #SleepySuperhusbands.
“He led his own team. I’m not surprised that he didn’t tell you. He tries not to bring it up. Anyway, I was part of his team and long story short a mission went wrong and I kinda went missing for awhile there. Got my arm blown off,” he says tapping on his prosthetic, “and that’s how I met Sam. He was a pararescue who Steve knew from training camp. He called in a favour.”
“Yeah, well maybe I’m done being a good friend to someone who’s such a stubborn [bleep]!” Sam shouts before dragging Bucky off to the dance floor.

“There are worst fates,” Tony says, turning in the circle of Steve’s arm, grimacing a little at the slick feeling between them.

“Dude! Your ma raised you to swallow your food! And what do you mean what presentation? Steve you love printing out pie charts and bar graphs and details!” Sam’s eyes and voice are filled with disbelief. “Steve, are you trying to tell me that when you said you barged into Tony’s office, you really didn’t prepare a proper and detailed proposal for the harvest fest?”
“I doubt it,” Mr. Vanko sneers before looking at the board then scowling when he realises Tony is right.
He brings Tony’s hands up to him and places a kiss on the palm, “There was a slight hold up. Just, wait here.”
missed a few meals while you were away,” Tony mumbles around his glass, “but it wasn’t like that time a month ago!”
around his temples - no product or styling other than him running his hands through it every 5 minutes.
When he checks his messages later he sees that Tony had sent him the picture, with Tony front and centre but the perspective makes it look like Steve is popping right up from his head with a goofy look on his face.
“Hey!” Tony calls out, glaring up at Steve. “Alright, alright, you’re so big and strong. There’s no need to show off now,” he says, dropping the box to the floor.
Steve whips his head to stare at Tony so fast, he’s possibly sprained something. “What do you mean ask
“GET YOUR DIRTY FACE OFF MY THOUSAND DOLLAR KITCHEN ISLAND BARTON,” Tony shouts, stomping into the kitchen, looking relatively unscathed except for the streak of neon green
“You look cute,” he tells him and Tony’s nose scrunches up the way it always does whenever someone calls him cute.
“It’ll suck if we lose the parks department for sure but I’m not actually worried Steve is going to fail,” Clint tells the camera. “I mean, it’s
“Man, what have I said about ranting with your mouth full? Shut up and chew,” Sam says, taking a sip of his tea.
Dinner and debrief had thankfully been short, the team just as eager as him to call it a day and crawl into bed; happy to deal with any minor problems
Now it’s been a few years and they were adults, with their own adult apartment, working at their adult jobs but God help him if he still didn’t feel like that 19 year old who stumbled over his own words when that tiny 18 year old had looked up at him and beamed.
Tony doesn’t seem aware that the parks team is going about the grounds and setting up without an issue.
Steve doesn’t seem fazed by the harshness of Tony’s words. “I believe what I believe and I know what I know.”
“When I asked you that last night,” he says, standing in front of Tony, “I was hoping that maybe you’d say
“Wanted to surprise you guys,” Tony wheezes, placing kisses on Peter and Harley’s heads and then smacking a kiss on Morgan’s cheek.
“Mr. Rhodes. Good morning. I was hoping to be presenting my idea to the both of you today,” he says, inclining his head towards Tony’s empty desk chair.
“The betrayal I feel right now is overwhelming,” Steve calls from the door of the nursery. “This is my favourite game.”
“I ain’t like Stevie. When I got my honourable discharge, Steve pretty much came with me since his contract was up and funny enough so was Sam’s. I didn’t want nothing to do bureaucracy and Steve honestly hates redtape more than Fury but he’s always liked doing good. The parks department is his way of doing good by this city without actually having to suffer too much politics.”
Tony is full on crying now, tears tracking down into his beard and he practically falls out of his chair to crush his mouth to Steve’s, the word
It’s the “Love you’s” that are giving him pause though, keeping him from completely breaking down on the phone to Rhodey over the familiar patterns cropping up and ugly thoughts swimming through his head because
The first being that he’d love to be out of New York for the 4th weekend because past experience has taught him that Doom is likely to pull another
“Hey, will you at least think about it instead of immediately shooting it down!” Steve says, voice rising. “You’re not even going to give me a chance to save this city? Or people’s jobs? Are you that heartless?”
“You’re it for me too, Steve. Always have been,” Tony says, and really what else can Steve do but kiss the smile on Tony’s lips.
“Oh yeah, and what’s the deal?” Tony asked, smiling at him as he sat on the edge of the bed to put on his socks.
Steve isn’t really one to deny Tony anything, let alone on his birthday and definitely not when he’s beaming like
Steve snorts. “Except the fact that I’d have to move to another state, change my name and possibly work at a job I despise?”
“Ecstatic,” Tony replies drily, holding his hand out to Steve who takes it bemusedly, pulling him down to his side so they’re both laying across the couch, legs tangled in a mess.
Steve eventually silences all the questions they get bombarded with when out in public by just kissing Tony in full view of what seems to be every camera in existence.
Tony looks at the rip sadly before carefully folding it and placing it back in his closet. He turns to Steve and gives him a sheepish smile, “Guess it was bound to happen sooner rather than later.”
there are canvases all over, only a few blank - the others are filled with gorgeous landscapes and Steve clearly has a partiality for the sunsets, though Tony does spot some glaciers and meadows around.
Tony shushes him, running his fingers through Steve’s hair - which in all honesty, he’s wanted to do
. Extravagant bouquet of flowers and expensive restaurant type plans - but the very idea of you thinking for a minute that I’m going to break up with you is nightmare inducing so,” Steve reaches into his back pocket while slowly lowering himself to one knee and
Tony tells him that he does it so he can stay in shape since now he has to keep with Steve’s insane growth spurth over the past year and so he can be
“You say that like you haven’t rolled off a roof to prove a point before,” Steve tells him, reaching through the window to snatch the bag before coming back to sit in front of Tony.
Stan just laughs, “Don’t you worry son, you’re not town gossip just yet but I do know all about you since Steve’s been coming in almost every day this last week to eat me out of my waffles and to complain,
Tony seems on the verge of tears but before Rhodes can so much as move to comfort his friend, Steve is suddenly in front of him.
“Alright listen,” Tony begins when Fury offers nothing else, clasping his hands together on the table, “at the end of the day Rhodey and I are just here to give financial advice. We don’t actually have the jurisdiction to fire anyone, we’re not state auditors. We’re just providing your government with the best solutions.”
Tony smiles up at him. “There you go, deep breaths. Steve listen to me. Just because one vendor pulled out doesn’t mean everyone else is going to. I’m sure there’s already someone who’s called that’d be happy to take their place. It’s all going to be fine.”
“You mean you have poker nights and don’t invite me,” Steve glares. “Yeah, I know all about your special invite game nights.”
“Steve? Why are the lights off? Are you doing some strange art thi-” Tony cut off as he came into the kitchen, seeing Steve standing there holding the chair out for him.
He stands, gathering all the papers he had pulled out from his folder that was tabbed PARKS. “I’ll get what I need from the spreadsheets,” he says before walking out of the conference room.
i've been crying for half an hour over how much i love and miss tony stark and how much he deserved better and that has manifested into this
He crouches down next to Tony, both hiding behind the blanket before dropping it again, making silly faces.
He gets a soft smile and affectionate kiss to his temple for it and feels the familiar sting of tears forming. “I, uh, I left some dinner in the microwave for you,” he says, walking to the kitchen, surreptitiously wiping at his eyes.
The camera swings towards the office where from the large glass window, Natasha can be seen picking up the ringing phone before immediately slamming it back down onto the receiver.
Steve kisses the curve of Tony’s shoulder, aggravating the beard burn he put there not even an hour ago. “A few more months,” he sighs.
Tony swipes at his eyes roughly, “I’m sorry, I just, I looked over the numbers and this really could help the town so much. Yeah, yeah you can save your
for half an hour before deciding on something to watch - or it’s a day where they run errands and do chores, the pile up of their laundry growing too large to be ignored.
“We already do that,” Steve says, grinning down at Tony as he squeezes a dollop of shampoo onto Tony’s palms.
wine, listing into each other as they dance along the cobblestones and all Steve is able to think is
“Hi, handsome,” Tony smiles up at him. “You’ve got a real dumb look on your face so I’m assuming you like the uniform.”
Steve, holding onto his drink with a pink umbrella sticking out of it, “I didn’t even say one thing and they attacked me, not one thing and then it was the whole thing-“
Tony’s palms are damp and once they’re off the platform and away from prying eyes, Steve sits Tony down and places those palms on his own chest, rubbing at his inner wrist with his thumb. “Count my heartbeat and breathe with it, Tony. Come on — breathe in, there you go, and breathe out. You’re doing great.”
He can’t smell any salt in the air and the sound of the sea is gone, replaced by the pounding of his heart in his throat.
He squints at the camera against the morning sun shining through the courtyard, “I’m not that worried. Everyone here in the parks department is an important member of the team and absolutely needed.”
He’s staring at his phone, hidden behind his open textbook and he’s taking a selfie that Steve is just going to
Most of the patrons of the restaurant had dwindled out as the night wore on but Steve had called in a favour — well,
“Somedays I think I should have kept my identity to myself,” he says, after the silence stretches, still not meeting Steve’s eyes. “I never get to
“Eh,” Bucky shrugs. “I’ve hand enough time being moody and upset. Life’s too short for that sort of thing.”
“I promise I won’t take too much of your time and this doesn’t really have anything to do with department matters,” Steve cuts in, hovering by the edge of Tony’s desk.
Steve went to stand in front of him before getting down on one knee and getting the ring from his back pocket.
“I stand by it,” Tony tells him, poking him in the thigh with his toe. “Steve, these things are going to happen on a battlefield. Come on, you know that soldier.”
Bruce is walking around the mud pit with a tape measure while Natasha and Clint seem to be making the pit deeper and removing any rocks. Natasha has gloves on and somehow barely a speck of dirt on her. Clint is barehanded and there’s mud up to his forearms.
The door of Tony and Rhodes’ office opens with a bang, hitting the wall loudly as Steve enters, shouting excitedly, “I’ve got it! I’ve figured it out!
But Tony really had been breathtaking under the lights hanging above them, clutching Steve’s hand so they wouldn't get separated by other people on the ice and just smiling at him with the purest look on his face. As opposed to 3 nights ago, Steve had to practically stop himself from blurting out the question.
“You’re way too in shape to be eating like that man,” Tony says, eyeing Fury’s plates. He glances down at his own plate and blinks. “How did he know I like blueberries?”
“So,” Steve begins, clapping his hands together, “the city of SHIELD is in debt. The big ups have sent for financial advisors, all the way from DC! They’re gonna take a look at the city’s spending and make some cuts.”
He usually lets Pepper deal with public appearances, choosing to fade into the background to let her do what she was
Bruce is swaying heavily against Thor and he looks a little green in the face but he’s hissing, “I’m gonna smash Steve into tiny pieces! How can he hurt Tony who is so small and must be protected and- baby, babe,” he says turning to Thor, “you’ll help me smash Steve right? You’ll protect me?”
Steve must look an absolute fool right now because the cheerleaders burst into giggles around him, Tony included, who walks up to him and
“I’ve no idea where Stevie is,” Bucky says, still spinning. “We were supposed to have lunch today but that was 20 minutes ago and he ain’t answering his phone.”
“I appreciate this, and you so much, but you really didn’t have to. I’ve gotten better with this since it happened Steve, I promise. I’m alright,” Tony says to him before giving him a chaste kiss on the lips.
“A harvest festival?” Tony says, an eyebrow arched. “What year is this town in? Do you also pray to the great pumpkin? Ritual sacrifice for  bountiful crops?”
Sam opens his mouth to say something but Steve continues, “No Sam, I’m serious yeah he might have an ass I could bounce a quarter off but he’s still a conceited arrogant prick that’s trying to put people outta jobs and he doesn’t even care.”
Then he had begun pacing, and got mud all over his sneakers and the hem of his jeans for his efforts. “Of course this happens today. No one will come because no parent is going to want their child trekking dirt and so no income is going to be made and the whole department is going to be fired and then it’ll be true Rhodey,” he continues turning to Rhodes who’s leaning against the car and taking in his surroundings.
in the afternoon sun with the crinkles in the corner, cheeks flushing with pink on his brown skin and hair falling on his forehead,
“Actually Mr. Rogers, I can just waltz in here,” Tony says cutting him off, “Because I was asked to waltz in here and fix the mess your town created.”
He moves as quietly as he can, snaking his arms around Tony’s waist and tucking his face in the side of his neck, giving it a small kiss and getting a delightful shiver in return. “Good morning, beloved.”
Tony offers him his pinky, letting him know he’s not actually mad. “Maybe - Maybe dad can let you go on his shoulders! Then
Steve sputters, cheeks going red. “I do not! He’s just aggravating! I’m aggravated! It has absolutely nothing-“
and what Steve imagines sunshine would sound like, but he still manages to get a laugh and that’s the important part.
“Well, I am all about green, clean energy,” Tony says, watching Neil explain Herchel’s observations of light impact and trying to ignore the taste of ash in his mouth whenever they pan to shots of the solar system.
Steve’s hair and clothes are damp, the bags under his eyes have never been more pronounced and his shoulders are so
They stare at each other for a whole minute before Tony says, “Fine, don’t fire him! But at the end of the day you might have to make tougher cuts and don’t blame me for that.”
“Yeah, Natasha’s birthday is gonna be lit.” Clint scrunches his nose. “That’s what people say, right? It’s
Tony looks to where they’re friends are all seated together - near the now married couple before looking up at Steve, “Guess family means something else to me know,” he says
Tony’s chest is heaving, whether from the indignation or from the sobs building in his lungs, he isn’t sure.
They’re in Lee’s diner, sitting at the booth near the jukebox that seems to only play What’s New Pussycat. Stan comes out of the kitchen, bringing a fresh plate of waffles to their table before going over to a family sitting sitting near the windows, greeting them warmly.
He knows that Tony has a habit of biting his nails after a particularly bad night of restless sleep, the jagged edges of his nails looking so out of place against his otherwise impeccable appearance.
“Well good, cause we’re going to be best friends,” Steve says confidently, dragging Tony through the front doors. “Come on, we can’t be late on our first day.”
Nat’s never gonna shut up about the turtleneck,” Tony huffs, raking his right hand through Steve's still damp hair. “We really should have been more thorough in the shower,” Tony sighs, plucking at a dried piece of slime from his hair.
Steve can’t help the laugh that bubbles out of him as Tony drags him along. “They’re not for sale, Tony. Erskine has to grade them.”
A small whimper escapes him, so soft Tony thought he’d imagined it but he hears it again and he’s back in bed in a flash - moving to wake Steve up.
He forgot to check the date today. December 16th. He was going to propose to his boyfriend on the anniversary of the day his parents had died.
“Steve, take a deep breath,” Tony says. “This is unusual for me, I’m usually the one that works himself up to a panic attack but it’s okay, I can be your Rhodey right now.”
Steve Rogers had made an appointment at 11.30am, all with the intention to pitch the harvest festival, folder marked with many coloured tabs and a board filled with graphs in hand. It is currently 11.27am.
But Steve doesn’t find out what Tony’s going to get Pepper to do, because he stops dead in his tracks and tapers off, eyes wide and mouth open just a little as he stares at the portrait - his own face reflected back to him on canvas.

Tony watches them go, only walking closer to Steve after hearing the elevator doors close. “Hey,” he says, circling his arms around Steve’s neck.
It trends in under 5 minutes, becomes the fastest photo on Instagram to hit 2 million likes and is the only thing the news covers for a
He gets to Luna in 15 minutes and chains his bicycle to the rack. He’s looking around for Tony when someone jumps on his back.
“So, do you want to join me for breakfast at Lee’s? There’s nothing waffles can’t fix,” Steve says, hope clear in his voice.
Bucky shoots a look at Tony, who seems to be processing all this information. “What about you? How’d you get into all this?”
“I hate this,” Steve says into Tony’s hair, disturbing the bubble of peace that’s encased them since stepping into the hotel room.
Clint, Natasha and Bruce are by the wayside where a dip in ground has caused a pool of mud to form. They’re taping around the area and are arguing over something, Bruce pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Come on,” Steve says, gently taking Tony’s hands in his again and pulling him out the side entrance where he knows Happy is idling with the car. “Let’s just get home, huh? The rest of them can find their own way back.”
“I swear to God, the next time a baddie does anything relating to the words Slime, Goo or Sludge, we just hand it over to the Fantastic Four and call it a night,” Clint says, slumped onto the marble counter.
Tony turns on his back with a grunt, trying to hide the wince from the twinge in his side.  “Yeah, I get it Steve, but
Thor nods at him, eyes bleary. “Yes, smashing? Who’s smashing? Are we gonna smash? Let’s go,” he says, pulling Bruce away to the exit.
Steve snorts. “Doesn’t matter anyway. He’s probably gonna head back to DC soon. Maybe it’s for the best.”
,” Steve echoes before striding over to Tony and stopping just short of their lips touching, eyes questioning.
When Rhodes sees The Chief, directing all her officers to their spots, he makes a beeline right for her.
“Thor didn’t fare much better when he found out, - though he probably took it better than Loki did,” Steve tells him.
He tells Tony that maybe his bed sheets were cursed after all and Tony just laughs along, not mentioning the Mullein petals and Marjoram leaves stuffed in the pillows and the protection spell done under the Moon’s watchful eyes.
“You know, if the team didn’t know before, they definitely know now,” Steve says, pushing open Tony’s bedroom door.
“Hey, Stevie,” Bucky says, clean shaven and hair swept back neatly, wearing a crisp white button down. An ensemble Sam - looking put together as he always does-  clearly appreciates from the way he’s eyeing his boyfriend.
“Hey, so I cooked us dinner. Thought we could do something a little special tonight.” Steve said, trying not to fidget and tip off Tony that he was nervous.
“It is criminal how good you look in that Christmas sweater Rogers. It’s a conspiracy,” Tony says, looking at him with bright eyes and a cheeky grin on his face.
of hesitation to refute it, causes the entire press floor to burst into noise; laughter replaced with questions and accusations being hurled in a cacophony of sound and flashes that makes Steve’s head hurt and Tony’s breath come in stutters.
He loves Tony when it’s 1pm and he sends a text to make sure Tony goes to get some lunch and receives a slew of emojis in reply,
Steve goes pink but he has a smug smile on his face, advancing to Tony’s desk, “You said to let you know and I’m here to let you know that you better get your gardening supplies and to pick a book to read to the all the animals!” He stops and his brow furrows. “Don’t read little red riding hood though cause the raccoons will get ideas and this town can’t survive that. Not for a second time.”
Steve takes a swing of his drink, pretending not to notice the slight fissure in the stem of the glass as a server takes it away only to replace it by pushing another glass in his hand.
Tony gifted the art studio to Steve back when they’d all started to live together, fully stocked and equipped with all the necessary amenities.
Tony looks at him quizzically. “And you want to throw this festival now? When we’re literally here to bring about more budget cuts? What the [bleep] are you not getting about our jobs here?”
He knows the tell-tale signs of an oncoming panic attack whenever he hears the short but rapid pulls of breath as Tony tries to
Bucky moves over on the bench and gestures for Tony to sit. “Sammy is an even worse flirt than I am. It’s a miracle we even got together at all, but that’s fate for ya.”
There are barely any hiccups except for a minor incident where a raccoon got into the mud pool, Natasha got her hands on some chinese throwing knives and proceeded to give a demonstration of extreme accuracy when some guy asked her what she was going to do with them and also when Fury kept flashing a piece of paper that said
Steve sighs, getting out to get the boxes in the backseat and trying his hardest not to laugh as Tony grabs the heaviest one before Steve can reach it, clearly struggling under its weight.
“I hate all of you for doing this,” she says when they finish and place a mini cupcake in front of her, a lighted candle sticking out.
“Yeah,” Steve grimaces, walking in with Bucky, slime all over their suits and in the plates of Bucky’s arm. “If I have to hear Buck ask me
“Oh my god, oh my god, it’s ruined! No one’s gonna show,” Tony had said the moment he stepped out of the car.

Steve’s face must have morphed into the strange expression he does whenever Tony mentions anything about his home life because when he looks up from the plate of fries he’s not eating he gives a
“You’re more likely to blast your repulsor to Jamesons’ office window,” Steve tells him, closing his eyes and luxuriating the gentle strokes of Tony’s brush.
- Tony think the ice-cream is gonna instantly melt in his mouth from how warm he feels as he looks at his family.
Tony just moves on to biting at the skin on his bottom lip. “Howard will be really mad if I miss dinner. He says the people coming over could really make or break the the company and he wants to make a good impression.”
He throws the paper wrap from his lunch in the trash and walks out, leaving Steve to continue staring at the mural.
It’s a painting of a photograph, one that he had instantly favourited and stared at all day after Bucky sent it to their group chat - of Tony at the park when they’d decided to have a picnic after Nat’s last paper. His head is thrown back in a laugh, but his eyes are open,
Rhodes doesn’t say anything for awhile, tipping his head back against his chair once again. His eyes are closed when he says, “We don’t have to leave just yet. Maybe we can still stick around until we know for sure that the town won’t run into the ground again if we leave.”
“Should we get the check?” Tony asks, setting down his glass. “We’re the last ones here and I can’t begin to imagine how much the servers must hate us right now.”
Steve turns, a sheepish smile on his face as he stretches out his hand, “Apologies Mr. Rhodes, I just uh, got a little excited and wanted to pitch an idea.”
“In comparison,” he continues, “there’s only 1 box that’s not even fully filled for actual projects that were carried out. So no, you will not be fired.”
“Tony’s on his way,” Sam says before Steve can even get the question out, whose mouth shuts with a click. “He got caught up with Thor.”
She’s dressed in a black gown that has fur trimmings along the hem and sleeves complete with gloves and a veil.
- this wonderful, maddening, roller coaster of a journey with you frankly makes me want to break out in hives. You’re the most amazing, beautiful and brilliant person I know, and there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t thank the universe for thinking I’m worthy of you so-” there’s a box in Steve’s hand, and there’s a
He tugs Steve down, his back to Steve’s chest. “I - I got worried when you didn’t call. Thought maybe you forgot.”
He’s also kind of hoping to spend some time with Tony. He hasn’t seen much of him outside of battles with Tony spending whatever spare time he had at SI but unfortunately, Tony is
Tony glares at him, running his hairbrush through Steve’s hair. “I’m gonna go to the Bugle first thing in the morning and tell them you’re a menace to society, I swear it.”
“Your friends are kinda weird but I like them,” Tony says, smiling up at Steve. “What did Sam mean? Hourly rates?”
“Turn this movi-music down!” Bucky shouts then proceeds to belt the chorus to Nickleback’s Photograph.
, taking off his glasses to rub at his eyes. “All I can tell so far is that it causes momentary confusion to anyone it hits. Never longer than 5 minutes.”
Steve stares at Rhodes, shoulders practically up to his ears, before turning on his heel and stomping out.
Rhodes steps out into the hallway, on his way to the meeting with the City Planning Department, information that has been awarded because Steve had called specifically to ask whether Rhodes would be available at this time and was told no, he would not to which Steve then asked if Tony would be around and was told yes, he would be.
Clint, Natasha and Bruce have finished setting up the mud pool, quick work thanks to Thor’s help. It’s rather decent looking, like it had always been planned rather than a quick fix.
The club is starting to fill with people and the music is rattling the glasses on the bar. Everyone from the parks department has arrived, including Fury who is wearing a bejeweled eyepatch, when Natasha finally walks in.
The camera focuses on Fury’s face, his brows drawing together as he reads through the new Parks department budget plan, the popcorn baggie abandoned at his feet.
Steve gives a huff of laughter, pulling Tony’s hands to his lips for a kiss. “Thank you. For waking me.”

Tony raises an eyebrow at Fury, “I actually expected Rogers to be the one barging in here. He’s scheduled 11 meetings with us since we arrived,
in this class confuses Steve considering how smart he is — when he realises Tony isn’t paying attention to a single thing Mr.Vanko is saying.
He knows that whenever there’s leg room and probability of no one seeing it, Tony bounces his left leg whenever agitated, particularly when the press turns to a line of questioning he hadn’t anticipated.
“We needed to be here to see if the festival was a success. And it was,” Tony turns to look at Rhodes.
Everyone from the parks department is drunk and dancing on the dance floor. Including Fury, who is singing along to the Ariana Grande track currently playing.
Steve stops chewing and a tiny speck of waffle goes flying onto the table when he asks, “What presentation?”
“I’m fine, no memory loss for me. Only affects you if there’s skin to skin contact so I got lucky,” Tony sighs. “My suit, well, not so much.”
Tony has a huge smile on his face and he hurries over to Rhodes side of the desk and sits in his lap, hugging him. “I know you’re doing this so you can woo Carol.”
The parks team had arrived at 5.30AM, the sun having just risen with the two financial advisors arriving ten minutes after.
“Papa, I’m so tall now,” Peter says, clutching the top of Steve’s head and Tony nearly laughs at the way it causes his blonde hair sticks up in all directions.
Tony is lying face down on his desk when Steve comes into his office. He knocks on the door and Tony shoots up, piece of paper sticking to his forehead.
The sun is rising, light slowly creeping in from the edges of their curtains dimly lighting their tiny apartment, the sounds of the city getting louder and louder aided by their neighbour’s alarm
Steve moves to follow him in the same direction and Tony starts walking faster, “Wha- go the other way!”
“Just a few more months and I’ll cut it,” Steve tells him, bending his knees a little and thinking Tony doesn’t notice.
“Oh, I know who you are Rogers,” Rhodes cuts in, grin on his face and a quick glance at Tony. “Nice to officially meet you too.”
“You should bang him,” Sam says. “Maybe some hate sex will loosen the both of you up and you won’t be at each other’s throats, huh?”
In the evening, the day before the harvest festival, it starts raining and it doesn’t stop raining well into the night.
. But even if he does, I’ll be fine. I’m like a bird ya know, I always find my ground,” he says, grin on his face.
Tony isn’t sure how much quiet Bruce gets whenever Thor is in there with him, but he’s never kicked him out.
He sighs softly before slipping out of the bed, careful not to jostle it too much and disturb Tony, who doesn’t need to be awake for another hour.
There are in fact cars pulling up and parking by the roadside, mostly all the vendors with their supplies to begin setting up. Everyone is wearing rain boots.
Steve pulls out 2 granola bars from somewhere, offers one to Tony who takes it readily and then one to the camera. Tony splits the bar with Steve.
He wonders if he should ask - biting his lip as he debates with himself but he must not mask it well - or well, Steve has gotten too good at reading him - because he says, “It’s a recurring dream I have. Since I was a teen really - it’s - it’s like I’m floating, I guess. In this big wide void, just darkness and it’s - it’s
“Course I did,” Steve says with a shrug. “You and me are gonna be friends. I’m Steve Rogers,” he says, sticking his hand out for a shake.
It gives him only a few hours to come home and basically pass out on their bed before groaning himself awake, leaving Tony with a quick peck goodbye and a “Love you!” shouted to him from the door.
His hands start to fidget and he’s biting on his lower lip. “Do you- do we have to leave immediately? Are we being called back? Another assignment?”
“You know,” Sam says, cutting of Steve’s stumbling sentence. “I’ve been hearing an awful lot about this Tony and I still haven’t met him but from the way you’ve been behaving since he rolled into town, I’m just gonna go out on a hunch and assume you think he’s hot.”
had called in the favour — but he’s also compensating the remaining staff for agreeing to stay on an extra half hour after closing time.
“No, no, just that you wrote out the equation wrong,” Tony says, shutting his book, his phone wedged between the pages.
Rhodes had mentioned to check the workshop but that had been the first place he looked anyway and he’s gone through the whole house at this point.
Natasha, who doesn’t at all seem affected by the alcohol she’s been consuming only says, “The night is going as planned.”]
But as the keynote speaker, he couldn’t exactly get out of it, nor would he pull the kids out of school for 3 days, thus leaving him with an itch under his skin that grew everyday, turning him into a ball of anxiousness.
