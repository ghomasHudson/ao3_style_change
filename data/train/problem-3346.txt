Dean jumps when the set of doors that lead back out into the hallway burst open with a bang, as do a few others, and when he looks up, it's to find a man he's not quite sure he recognizes. Dean squints, looking closer, and he knows he
“Time for a breather, man,” Caesar tells him, shooting him an eyeliner-darkened wink, and when Dean looks around, catching snippets of faces bathed in reds, greens, and blues, he sees that Charlie was right; everyone in the club wears some variation of the striking eye make-up.
Dean nods, shaky with relief as Castiel’s hand falls from his face. The heat of his palm lingers though, long after Castiel leaves him in the entrance hall—long after Dean leaves, too.
“The good news is you don’t have a concussion, but I would like you to keep me updated. If you feel nauseated, lightheaded, dizzy, or your headache persists—”
Castiel smiles, holding up his own glass, and they follow suit. “To you,” Castiel says, simply put, and the rest of the suitors repeat after him, raising their glasses as well. Except for Dean, who’s too busy staring into Castiel’s eyes, and if he wasn’t watching so intently, he would’ve missed it—the way Castiel looks right at him and mouths
“You’re incorrigible,” Castiel laughs, smiling that beautiful, blinding smile. “Though I wouldn’t be opposed to—”
minutes! Do you know what I can do in ten minutes?” Her scowl only grows more severe, and Dean would feel bad for Castiel—he really would—but she’s not yelling at him for once, and he’s too busy being happy about that to notice his prince’s discomfort.
“Are you, uh…” Dean starts, scratching the back of his head as his cheeks heat. He pulls his hand away when it starts getting clammy. “Are you done for the night?”
Inside, the training area is warm and cozy, brightly lit by soft, yellow lighting high in the rafters. Dean closes the door behind him, feeling a shiver work its way through him as he turns to face the soldiers.
. It’d just make things worse. They’d worry, and he’d have to explain. Or lie. And really, what’s the point of causing such a stir when there’s probably nothing—
“Fuck,” he breathes, and he can’t look at Dean. Can’t see whatever’s in those big green eyes, because he’ll crack—he’ll break apart in a million pieces. “Dean—”
“Dean,” Castiel says, quirking an eyebrow. “Will you accept this rose?” His smile turns playful like they're sharing a private joke, and Dean decides it’s a good look on him.
Dean startles so badly, he drops his bacon, tossing it into the bushes for the bunnies to find. With a pout and a huff, he looks up to find sharp blue eyes watching him from mere feet away.
Dean slips the book back into his bookshelf, his sapphire rose pressed safely inside. His room is dark, long shadows creeping up the moonlit walls, and Dean can’t bring himself to turn on the lights.
Dean glances at Castiel, his exhaustion forgotten in the wake of this new-found adventure. He studies the calculating glint in his prince's eyes, watching as he scans the hallway, thinking faster than Dean can imagine.
my shirt!" That's all he says, over and over, his voice thick with rage and despair, and if Dean didn't know any better from watching the footage, he'd think someone had died.
Over the next half hour, Dean tells them everything, starting from the moment he walked out of the sitting room after dinner, to the minute they pulled up outside of the palace that morning. Castiel does a lot of scowling, but Duma is professional and diligent, not showing any signs of personal feelings.
Dean’s heart flip-flops, excitement mixing with his nerves as he steps aside. What could Castiel possibly want with him at this hour? He’s not that kind of guy, and neither is his prince, but come on, it’s near midnight. “Yeah, of course.”
Dean rolls his eyes on a heavy sigh. "All I'm saying is it'd be nice to have someone to hang out with even when the prince is around, but especially when he's not." Dean flaps his hands around, struggling to make sense of his words. "This place is boring as all hell when Castiel isn't around, and filling that time with friends would make it easier on all of us, I'd think."
Hannah’s cheeks color as she ducks her head. He doesn't think he's ever seen a member of any royal family
The guard doesn’t answer, eyeing him up as Dean does the same. He’s not as tall as Dean, but just as broad in the shoulders, and there’s something sharp in his gaze—something ruthless that’s great in an ally, but terrifying in an enemy.
With that, Dean stands, not even bothering to say goodbye to anyone as he leaves, weaving through the tables and chairs as his heart races and his body aches.
"You know that's not true," she spits, her voice getting more and more venomous by the second, and Dean doesn't envy Castiel one bit. "We will all suffer because of your selfishness."
“So, uh,” Dean says after a minute, pushing himself up on weak arms. He meets Castiel’s eyes where he sits beside him, a sheepish grin curving his swollen, cock-sucking lips. “Want some pizza?”
He swallows it, but just barely, coughing and hacking as his eyes water and his throat screams at him. “God, holy fucking shit, Cas! Warn a guy before you give him a shot so early in the day.”
Mick sputters, readjusting his headset and holding tight to his questions. “You know you’re being recorded, right?” Mick grates, his eyes boring into Dean’s, but he just shrugs again.
Quiet murmurs move through the amphitheater like a burbling wave, sweeping across him and sending a shiver down his spine.
Dean’s almost too startled to answer—Castiel never talks, unprompted, during dinner—and he chokes back a cough, making sure to chew properly before swallowing the food in his mouth.
Dean turns left down the hall, heading for his room. It’s just about time for his turn anyway, so if he waits there, he shouldn’t miss out.
“That, and then some.” Jesse swings the wooden sword left and right, a smile on his lips as his bare chest shines with sweat, smeared with dirt as he pants for breath.
Susie stops with her back to him, one hand on her hip and the other cradling her forehead as Dean fights back his frustration. This is ridiculous—no one’s going to care if he doesn’t tilt his head up at the perfect angle, or if he holds it for a half a second shorter than the prescribed two point five-six seconds. No one will notice, and Dean sure as fuck doesn’t care if they do.
"Good evening," Castiel says, his warm voice filling Dean's ears like honey, and it has a smile twitching at the corners of his lips as his eyes turn to his prince. "It has been such a pleasure getting to know you all, and I look forward to the weeks to come." His eyes meet every one of them in turn before landing on Dean's. A flash of a smile as his gaze holds for a second too long. "You have brilliant minds and captivating ideas that I can't wait to hear. I know you will all do spectacular things, even when all but one go home." Castiel meets Dean's eyes again, and his heart skips a beat. "I will turn it over to you now, as I believe we have all waited long enough."
He doesn’t do more than tip his head under the stream, though, before snatching the shampoo off its shelf. He’s in so much of a rush to be done, that he doesn’t even notice the smell until he’s flipping the water off and stepping out.
Dean’s heart aches, and he opens the last bottle, knowing they’ll need it. He never really took the time to think too much into what it means to be the Crown Prince; how Castiel has had all these expectations thrust upon him from birth without so much as an opinion. It’s easy to forget he’s human, but here, sitting in this abandoned service hallway, drunker than they should be, it’s impossible to miss the pain infused in every word Castiel utters.
“Okay…” His eyes flick across the lines as he mouths the words. “Would you mind speaking about the events of last Monday? What was that about?”
Kelly hums as Dean shifts closer, his head pounding and his muscles protesting the awkward position, but he ignores it all, wanting to know what they think.
"Dean! Dean, please! Please, don't—" Kelly begs, coming up behind Lucifer, but he cuts her off with a glare over his shoulder.
He shakes away the daze, snapping back to the present when a couple brushes past him, and heads in the direction Castiel went, but not before snatching up a couple more bottles of champagne.
"Pretty until you open that mouth," Susie murmurs under her breath as she knots his shoes and fixes his socks. No tie today—Dean's good with that. "Good thing you're so damn cute."
“Call off the national guard. Let them know they’ve been found.” The words are clipped and cold, directed at someone behind Dean, though Castiel never breaks eye contact.
Also, I know we're a long way from the end, but what do y'all think of timestamps from Castiel's perspective? Just some times when Dean's unaware of him, but Castiel is around, or when Dean's questioning Castiel's feelings, or whatever. I'll write them anyway, but are there specific scenes you'd like to request? Let me know!
Without thinking, Dean lets his hand drift across the space between them and wraps his fingers around Castiel's where they rest on his lap. His hands are warm, but Castiel shivers, and after a moment, he squeezes Dean's hand so tight, his joints ache.
The roar of the water cuts over her, drowning out her voice as Dean drops his sleep pants to the floor, unconcerned with the fact that Susie’s right behind him. He slides the glass panel aside and steps in, closing the door behind him for some modicum of privacy as he refuses to meet Susie’s eyes.
“Why, your highness, are you planning on putting me in handcuffs?” Dean drawls, low and gravelly, and far more suggestive than he has any right to be.
He contemplates for a moment, fingers stilling on the chair as he stares at the cookies with barely-contained want. "Yes," he blurts after a moment, reaching for the bowl as Dean laughs. "Thank you." He settles his handful of cookies in his lap, eating one at a time in a respectable, princely manner. Dean shoves three more cookies into his already stuffed cheeks.
Dean nods as she tugs his pants up his legs, maybe a little rougher than she needs to, and he stumbles a bit before steadying himself on her shoulder.
He has to admit, he looks nice, and even if Sammy likes to tease him, he knows the kid’s happy for him. So, he gives himself one more glance over, and turns away from the mirror—there’s no way Castiel will turn him down.
tied neatly around his best friend’s neck. The crisp, white button down hugs Castiel’s broad shoulders like a glove, tapering down at his waist in a way that has Dean’s hands itching to touch.
Dean pulls his memory stick from the laptop with shaking hands, his knees weak as humiliation still pumps through him. He retakes his seat and tries to calm his roiling stomach as Kelly rises to take up the podium, and the night carries on.
"Yeah, for the second one," Dean grumbles, bumping Castiel's shoulder with his own as his bottom lip juts out in a pout.
But she just shakes her head, something in her eyes he’s never seen before, and doesn’t like one bit. “No one is saying anything. They’re treating us like criminals, though. I don’t like it.”
Benny leads him down a wide hall, this one different from the rest of the palace, with its stark white and smooth tile. It's definitely a hospital, though much nicer than anything Dean's ever seen.
“Dean. Dean!” Duma snaps her fingers in his face, startling him awake and upright. “Are you sure you’re—oh, for fuck’s sake.”
What's weird is that Castiel doesn't bother saying good morning to any of them. It hurts, if Dean's being honest, but he doesn't let it sour his morning any more than it already is. Castiel is just tired—he was up all night trying to figure out what happened. He's allowed to have an off day, and Dean should respect that.
“I run the kingdom, of course.” Castiel flashes a grin over his shoulder, disappearing around a corner, and Dean practically trips over his feet in his hurry to catch up.
Dean’s heart kicks up a notch, pounding against his rib cage as a shiver works its way through him. Even with everything going on right now, Dean can’t deny how much he loves having Castiel so close.
So, he lets go, falling into the heart-wrenching, clenching, pounding pleasure of this night. He lets himself forget his past, and their pasts, and everything wrong in the world for one night, and he just lets himself
“We’re meeting with a lawyer; you need to look less like… well,” he waves his hands at Dean, his face twisting up in apology.
, Suse. Please don’t.” He drops the square of cheddar he’d been nibbling on and turns to her more fully.
As Susie leads Dean away, his prince throws his head back on a laugh, because, really? What's Susie going to do to either of them but make Dean change and send him back?
threatening, and like he’s not alone. Like he’s not safe in this room, and there’s someone watching him, and like there’s not a person in the world he can turn to to make this okay.
Eventually, Dean finds his way outside, toes sinking into the chilly dirt when he steps off the cobbled path. Despite the icy earth, the air is warm and soft, the wind almost still, and the sun beams down in brilliant rays.
“Come on,” Charlie whispers, bouncing on the balls of her feet as she looks around. “And don’t rip those jeans; they’re actually nice.” Dean shoots her a glare, which she pretends not to see, and lets himself fall the rest of the way, landing with a soft thud on his good side.
"Will you back me?" He looks at Castiel, eyebrows raised, and rolls his eyes when he sees the look on his prince's face. "You're such a child."
, and yet, here he is, looking like the sun’s shining out of his ass even with the tired, worried undertone he can see in his own face.
Dean doesn’t bother watching the road, keeping his eyes closed. The whole experience is exhausting, and now, with the sun long gone below the horizon and the world fast asleep, Dean wishes he was too.
“You prefer healing rather than hurting,” Dean whispers, something like awe in his voice, and it’s not a question, but Castiel nods anyway as a humble blush colours his cheeks.
Castiel just laughs and laughs, keeping a firm grip on his wrists as he trails his fingers up to Dean's armpits, digging in hard just to hear Dean’s pleas.
“No, thanks.” He doesn’t really know why he’s being a little shit, but he wasn’t lying about this place—it’s boring as all hell, and if he’s not allowed to explore the upper floors of the palace, then he’ll find somewhere else to acquaint himself with.
“What's the matter, Cas?” Dean teases, feeling all light and bubbly when his prince cuts his eyes towards him before glaring back at the screen.
“So, you know Meg? Apparently, she’s on the run. Something about a crime in her old country, but if she marries into royalty, all suspicion has to be dropped.” Jo leans back, her cat-caught-the-canary grin widening as Kelly gasps.
"You'd think," Susie agrees, one thin, perfectly plucked eyebrow arching as she looks down her nose at him.
“Hand me the phone,” he says, one hand shifting from the blankets to reach for Dean, and Dean’s eyes snap up with his prince’s pale face—he had dark circles under his eyes, and his bedhead is so bad, he looks like he stuck a finger in an electrical socket—but he hands Castiel the phone without protest. He
He doesn’t even have time to react before it hits him and then he’s on the ground with both hands covering the spot just below his right eye where the tennis ball hit. His face throbs as he touches the spot, hissing when the cut stings, but it’s not a big deal—he already knows it’s nothing serious.
Castiel laughs, though, throwing his head back while Dean scrambles to get his mouth under the foaming liquid.
Dean doesn’t move. Doesn’t nod or blink or breathe. He sits, frozen in his chair. How did it all go so wrong, so fast? And they’re blaming him? Twisting the story, tangling the facts, and throwing him under the bus because… why? Because he’s poor? Because, to them, he’s insignificant? As if this won’t ruin his life and any chance he’ll have at… well, anything? God, he doesn’t have the energy for this. His head pounds in a steady rhythm, and the congestion in his sinuses has moved to his chest.
She pulls him back in for one last hug. “You’re one of the best friends I’ve ever had,” she says, her voice thickening with unshed tears. “If anyone deserves his heart, Dean,” she says, fingers stroking his cheeks when she pulls away. “It’s you.”
“Hmm,” Susie hums in agreement as she nods, but she doesn't say anything more on the topic as they turn the corner and find that the hallway of windows is more crowded than normal.
Though it’s not late, the sun has long-since set, leaving the sky beyond his bedroom windows a deep, inky black. It’s a moonless night, like the ones he used to love. Easy to hide in, easier to disappear in, but now, they scare him, because he’s not the one trying to hide.
They don’t answer but shove him through his bedroom door before locking it behind him. He hits the floor hard, his already bruised face smarting when he doesn’t get his hands up fast enough, but he hardly notices as the reality of what just happened sinks in.
“Good.” She relaxes just a little, dropping her hands to her sides, but there’s that judging, untrusting look in her eyes—a look like he’s a troublesome child. “It needs to stay that way, Dean. You can’t know what would happen if he finds out, but I can assure you—”
dating all of them, after all—but seeing the way he feels for Sarah still cuts deep, even with the harmlessness of their flirting.
Even his stewing sounds more appealing than the alternative, but he doesn't have a choice, now does he?
Dean’s stomach flips, his heart tripping over itself as his breath catches. Heat floods his cheeks and tingles race up his arm from the spot where Castiel kisses the back of his hand.
Castiel chuckles, his eyes crinkling at the corners as his nose scrunches up, and Dean’s stomach twists itself into a knot. “Almost definitely. Cookie hasn’t let anyone but me ride her since the day she was gifted to me for my twelfth birthday. I raised her from a foal, you know?”
Dean snatches the plate out from in front of her as she closes her eyes and sways a little, but he doesn't dig in yet, more concerned about the well-being of his friend.
"Charlie!" Hannah snaps, shooting her a glare before flicking her eyes to Dean and back with a warning look. "You can't say things like that."
Dean tries to think everything through—tries to figure out how it all happened—but it’s fuzzy and unclear. What he
"Get out," he says, tugging the shirts off as fast as he can, then his pants. He tosses them aside, not caring where they land until he's back down to nothing but his underwear.
With that thought in mind, Dean spins on his heel and continues down the hall, not caring that he’s leaving the prince behind—he’s tired of trying not to step on any toes.
, and before anyone can stop him, he pushes to his feet, ignoring Susie, and Charlie, and Hannah, and everyone else as he escapes into the hall.
?" Hannah snaps, and Dean blinks at the bite in her tone, his head shooting back as he scowls. She's never spoken to him like that and he pulls away from her, put off by the accusation in her eyes.
Dean can picture it—a much younger Castiel, blue-eyes shining and messy brown hair wrangled into some semblance of order, grooving along to music only he hears as a his tutor watches on, mouth hanging wide as he struggles with what to do with the little boy—and it has him glowing with delight.
“Nope, not a one,” he says, popping the cherry red candy between his lips. “Try down a ways, there’s another motel about a mile back.” He waves a hand in the direction they just came from, and Dean lets out a groan.
“A toast!” Duma calls over the bustle of the other suitors. “To the prince, and to you!” Dean takes the offered glass of champagne and searches the room for Castiel.
But, more importantly, it’s big, and it reminds him of his prince. So, with a contented little smile and a secret delight warming his heart, Dean flips the book open to its center pages and, with the utmost care, settles his rose inside.
He's not thinking about the person in the field or the fact that Sammy broke his leg, or that there are still six other people trying to marry his prince—all he can focus on is the relief, and he sags with it, dropping onto the edge of his bed with a soft bounce.
Castiel’s lips move to his ear, breathing out his words in the softest voice. “Perhaps not as well as I’d like to, but I know who you are.”
“What? No, Cas, it’s okay, you just…” He trails off, taking a deep, steadying breath. “You startled me, is all.”
He leans into Dean’s legs, spreading them up and apart until Dean gasps at the strain in his hips. “Relax,” Castiel croons, pulling his track pants up so he doesn’t fall on his face, before stretching up the bed to tug Dean’s shirt off. “I’ll make you feel good.”
“Hello,” Dean says, crouching in front of Darren with a smile. “I’m Dean.” He reaches out a hand for Darren to shake, and the kid takes it. “Nice to meet you, Darren.”
Dean nods, squinting at the bright screen as he tries to lock that information away for next time. "Okay."
“Four gone, seven remain as we finish off another week at the palace,” Duma's voice booms over the speakers, filling the room as everyone inside falls quiet.
Lucifer brushes Dean aside, turning his back to him as he waits for Castiel’s answer. He doesn’t want to, Dean can see that clear as day, but he takes the sword back from Victor with a sigh.
Dean huffs, scowls, and glares at the back of his head, beyond confused, before Castiel pivots to walk backwards, watching him with a smirk. "I didn't flirt with your aunt—wait," Dean cuts himself off, eyes widening as horror sinks his stomach. His voice chokes off into a strangled whisper. "That was your aunt? Your… the
Dean lets his eyes wander for a moment, not really able to help the way they travel over Castiel’s broad chest and strong shoulders, down his torso to his thick thighs, hugged perfectly by his trousers.
Even though there are a few windows with light shining through gauzy curtains, they don’t obstruct the view, and for that, Dean is grateful.
She lifts her shoulders in a delicate shrug. “I don’t fully understand it since I’m the fourth of five children, but it was explained to me as having something to do with the purity of touch. The intimacy that comes along with touching another human being is something that shouldn’t be shared between the royals and the commoners.”
him. His heart pounds against his ribcage like a drum, so hard it almost hurts, but his blood sings in his veins with every hot breath he feels against his lips.
"There are people going hungry and the fancy-pants upper-classes can't wear the same fancy pants twice," Dean grumbles under his breath, more than a little annoyed. He still remembers the hunger pains of his childhood. He remembers his parents pretending to eat, so he would, too, because, at the age of four, dirty, scuffed, second-third-fourth-hand plastic food doesn't look all that different from soggy beans on stale bread.
“I suppose you’re rather hungry?” Castiel asks as he packs up his things, smiling over at Dean, who rubs his wrist and shakes out his hand. God, he doesn’t think he’s written that much since high school.
be almost done considering he’s mostly dressed, but what does he know? They could have hours to go, what with the way she fiddles with his hair and stage makeup.
Naomi nods but doesn't look away, keeping those steely eyes locked on his—assessing. Challenging. Always challenging. "I'm glad. I want you to be prepared. The other suitors know what is expected of them, but you…" She trails off, a tightness in her voice that sets Dean's teeth on edge. He knows what's coming—
The crowd explodes, music pulsing along with the adrenaline in Castiel’s veins. He jumps down from the stage, feeling like he could conquer the world, and heads right for Dean—his Bi-Explosion Cowboy—who’s got a smile that lights up the rainbow-coloured world.
Dean’s hands tremble where they’re stuffed deep inside his trouser pockets, though whether it’s from excitement, nerves, or the ridiculous amount of coffee he needed just to function, he doesn’t know.
There’s another door across the room, and he wastes no time pulling it open. Behind it is a bathroom, still a bit damp, with condensation dripping down the glass walls of the shower, and a used towel in the hamper by the door.
“I want,” Dean blurts, like he’s been waiting for the offer. Like he can hardly contain that want for even a moment longer. “Please, Castiel, I want it so bad.”
“Your highness!” A woman dressed in slimming black and thin red heels steps into the hallway, a tablet in hand as her perfectly curled brown hair falls around her shoulders. “So good to see you. Come with me, please.”
In the space between his speech and his silence, Dean feels every bit of his future closing in on him, one way or the other, and as Castiel opens his mouth and takes a breath, Dean aches so bad for the one that has a rose in his hand and Castiel by his side.
He opens his mouth to respond, but Charlie beats him to it. “Strip poker!” She leaps from her seat, snatching up the cards from Castiel’s fingers as he laughs, but to Dean’s, and everyone else’s shock, he doesn’t veto the idea right then and there. “That's it! We’re doing it! You don’t get out of at least
to dispatch one of my suitors violates that contract.” Castiel leans over the desk, using his physical stature to intimidate his father, but Chuck just looks smug—pissed off, yes, but mostly smug.
In the next few minutes, the queen marches back inside with her guards trailing behind, the ball disappears, and with it, the easy, laidback atmosphere.
Dean's stomach sours, her meaning ringing clear as a bell as his heart clenches—images of Meg and Castiel tangled up in each other's arms, lips locked together, surge in, uninvited. He shoves them back, annoyed at letting her get to him in the first place, and rolls his eyes.
Dean rises to his feet, looking anywhere but into Castiel’s eyes as another blush rises in his cheeks. “Thank you, your highness.”
“Dean,” Castiel whispers, but still, Dean can’t look up. He feels so fragile—like any little thing will shatter him in this moment. “Dean.”
Dean opens his mouth to snark back, but Charlie beats him to it, leaning forward with her elbows on the table and her head cocked to one side. “What? Like he can get a word in edge-wise? You won’t shut up long enough for anyone else to hear themselves think, so…” Charlie sits back in her chair, holding her hands up in a
, he thinks, and she must read his thoughts on his face because she gives him the dirtiest, darkest look he's ever seen.
Ten minutes, and several outfit changes later, Dean’s balancing on the top of the wrought iron bench in his garden, struggling to lift himself over with a bum shoulder and a bad knee.
Dean's mouth pops open but nothing comes out, and he looks around at the perfect fall morning like it should be obvious.
“It’s alright,” he murmurs, his eyes finding Dean’s for a fraction of a second before he looks away. It has a knot twisting in Dean’s gut though, because Castiel doesn’t look happy to see him. The opposite, actually—he looks annoyed, and more than a little jealous as he turns away without so much as a greeting.
His spirits are high and he can’t keep the smile off his face for more than a few seconds at a time—he looks ridiculously smitten and, judging by the dirty looks shot his way by almost all the others, they know why.
“I was in the library, I was on the top floor since it was less crowded, working on a research paper. I had this table that was in the far corner, specifically so I would be left alone. Then someone decides it would be a great idea to come over and ask me if I was going to leave anytime soon.”
“At the time I thought it was unfortunate. Now I don’t,” Castiel assured him, squeezing his arm. “It was the next semester, in January, we had this group assignment. I’d booked one of the study rooms in advance so we could meet before we had any other assignments to deal with. Those rooms were very illusive, even early in the semester. But when we get there he shows up with another group from a different class.”
Knowing it was a failed endeavor to convince him otherwise, Castiel took a seat at the table. Considering their relationship had started with Dean poking at him and trying to seduce him, he thoroughly enjoyed being able to return the favor. Sometimes in a more overt fashion, but more often than not all it took was little things like this to get Dean flustered while he himself had become nearly immune to such things. It had done wonders for his control, being his mate’s constant target.
The Demon paused his slurping to shrug. “I’ll eat just about anything. Cheeseburgers, pizza, tacos, Chinese, barbeque. Please tell me you’re not one of those health nuts.”
"I couldn't bring myself to hurt you," Castiel answered honestly. "As I said, I already have three children. It was not a hardship to kill their fathers but....with you it was impossible. It's not something I've experienced before."
For a moment Dean was quiet, staring into the ice box. Then he closed it without taking anything out, turning to face him, expression grim. “What’s it to you?”
“Higher than Abaddon, lower than Lucifer.” He poured the soup into a bowl, tossed in a spoon, and went to stand in the doorway. “How did you last this long with no sense of self-preservation?”
Not that he was given a choice in the matter, but he gladly took it. Castiel took his time, stroking the Omega’s throat through his orgasm. When he withdrew Dean was dripping tears and saliva and somehow it was still more of a turn-on than a turn-off. Especially when the Alpha patted his cheek, moving back down to thrust back into his soaked and stretched hole.
"Yes, we do. I haven't been in the mood since that last siren hunt, but Dean could use the chance to kill something."
Once everything was in position, Castiel read off the fifth question. “’Were you ever in a Christmas plan?’ Well if they had a Thanksgiving play, they had to have a Christmas play. They had a play for every holiday, and it was the same story.”
The Demon, who’d been unwrapping the bundled packages of boxers and socks, let his face fall into his hands with a groan of despair. “You’re not kidding. You wanna know why Gabriel gets Chuckles? He knows how to laugh. He doesn’t take everything so literally. How the hell have you lasted this long with such a big stick up your ass?”
“Those are valid complaints too,” Castiel pointed out. “And I do appreciate you getting the lights up there. He’s the one who puts them in the trees and on the roof.”
Dean didn’t seem to take offense, chuckling quietly. “Don’t get me wrong, you were cute and all, but you were also kinda pious, kinda self-righteous.”
“We did,” Castiel agreed, rolling his hips. He was rewarded with hands moving from his hips to his ass, giving a none-too-gentle squeeze. The Omega squeaked, then grinned. “I got all the globetrotting out of my system, love, and so long as you allow me good reading material I’ll be content for ages. But I do like to be useful.”
Papa looked like he was about to choke on his milkshake, but Dad was grinning ear to ear. “You know what, Cas? I think I agree with her. We’ll just have to try again. After all, we did want one of each.”
Margie braced her hands on the counter, mouth twisting in a hooked grin as Dean laid his binder on the belt. "Alright, hit me."
Castiel paused, hands in his trench coat pockets. He’d thought soap operas were to be avoided, but it seemed Dean had started watching them as a substitute to alcohol for inducing sleep. Somehow that had evolved into him being oddly invested, something Castiel had shamefully gotten caught up in. Particularly since this particular show was in Spanish with French subtitles. He still wasn’t sure if Dean spoke either one, but he did.
Within an hour the irritatingly pretty Demon shucked his jeans, too, but left on the boxer briefs. When he suggested Castiel take off more than his coat, since the Angel was visibly sweating, he refused. It took a great deal of temperature change to get an Angel or a Demon to feel it, but when Castiel tried to find the thermostat to turn it down Dean all but sat on him.
By the time his head cleared it had dully clicked just what he’d been hit with. His clothes were singed. He knew that burned scent. Holy fire. Blasted from an odd grenade-like weapon he’d never seen before.
Saturday morning, Castiel left bright and early with Charlie in tow. Like her brother she’d never been outside Haven before, but she’d gotten less practice using their secondary form. He went slower to accommodate, but was pleased at how well she kept up.
back next time, Castiel used a bit of angelic power to clean himself up where he knew Dean would be going. He wasn’t sure about prepping, but he did want himself clean, and he assumed that was how Dean had done it last time. It was one thing he didn’t envy humans, the need to do such a thing manually.
“I can reach climax twice in one day, if allowed a short recuperation period. Are you aware of your limits?”
Dean opened his mouth, closed it, then turned to walk out of the kitchen. He couldn't stay anymore. Beyond the simple fact John had crossed an unforgivable line, if he did either he'd say something he'd regret or he'd kill his own father, which he might also later regret. All he knew was that he couldn't stay in this house anymore.
“There may or may not be an additional party added, and none of us could achieve any form of resolution without incurring harm.”
“When she gave me the post, and told me I was to stay there until I either got myself killed or came to my senses. Whichever occurred first. I was never her favorite, neither was Anna. Frankly I think she would have preferred I died at that post, it would have allowed her to save face.”
“I don’t. If it were just me I wouldn’t but…” He closed his eyes, sucking in a deep breath and letting it out as he said, “You are everything to me. You deserve the best, and this way I’ll be better able to give you that. My initial change was a desperate attempt to stop squeezing into the mold my parents had designated for me, it just grew on me very quickly.”
“If you were still human, you would hardly be such a complicated case.” He handed over the soup, hoping it would at least stem the flow of conversation.
Chuck drifted out of his study to bid them welcome, only to retreat again when Lucifer had to herd sugar-hyped kids into the backyard. They took advantage of the break, grabbing their bags from the car and dropping them off in Castiel’s old room. It seemed a good a time as any after that, especially since the kids were winding down. Castiel slipped outside as Dean made sure the camera was ready for a different sort of filming.
Introductions made, and his parents seeming to approve, they unloaded the car and bustled inside before it got dark completely. Though Castiel had improved a bit over the years, Dean was still the one in primary command of the kitchen. Samandriel didn’t walk so much as he drifted into the room, inhaling deeply.
They were coming back through the house, getting an extra duffle and some food, when John lumbered out of the kitchen. Castiel froze halfway down the stairs, eyes locked on the newly angered Alpha. Dean bristled, stepping between them, back to his mate.
Castiel’s personal effects went straight to Dean’s room. He would have said something about there being a half-cleared closet and the number of empty dresser drawers, but the Alpha wouldn’t meet his eyes and grumped a few words as he shuffled off when he tried. Castiel chose to let it go. Especially when he found out what he’d been planning for Valentines Day. Fortunately by then Castiel had been able to soundproof their bedroom, but they couldn’t do everything Dean had originally planned. Not with three younglings in the house.
Castiel inclined his head. “Yes, I’m aware. But that’s not the point. It’s been two weeks, and I’m surprised you haven’t brought it up sooner. Surprised and…impressed, I suppose.”
“I would like to monitor things, but there’s no more I can do. Your body will have to do the rest on its own.” In hindsight, it was a minor miracle he’d been able to prod things along as much as he had.
“Yes. There’s plenty of nudity in art, and that’s what this was. Art. You might like it yourself, if they have another one.”
The Omega nodded absently, humming as soft lips pressed to his. He settled back down, yawning and resting his head on a pillow as the sheets were drawn off him. Gabriel doubted he'd been out for very long, judging by the clock on their nightstand. In truth he'd known it was a thought in Sam's head for a while, but he'd avoided it. Then his cousin had gone and said something that made his Alpha muster the courage to ask. For all it had been asked after his enjoyable punishment, Gabriel had said yes and Sam had mated him. When he'd passed out the Alpha's knot was still inside him.
“Tell you what? Just try it for a little while. If we like it, we keep the gig. If not, we do it long enough they can’t bitch if you bow out.”
He moved a bit closer, putting himself fifty feet from the tree line. The Alpha didn't look up from his work, attention focused. If he had a mouth Castiel might have huffed. He was closing the distance to forty feet when the Alpha abruptly went around the car, sliding in behind the wheel and trying to crank the engine. When all he got was spluttering the human went back to work.
Dean stared at him, blinking rapidly. The entire time he’d known Castiel, his wardrobe hadn’t changed much. It had gotten marginally more practical since graduating high school, trading tattered and ripped skinny jeans for often ratty and torn jeans of the baggier variety, graphic and striped shirts for plain dull, often black-based colors. He’d given up trying to tame his hair with a comb ages ago, leaving him with semi-permanent sex hair. He’d ditched the gaudy piercings for more subtle bars and small, slender rings. Two of the former were in his left brow, one of each of the latter in his upper and lower lip, not counting the silver stud in each ear and bar in his tongue. Castiel was a creature of habit, change was minimal and gradual if there was any change at all.
“Maybe. I didn’t tell you the details because I found it embarrassing, and…I didn’t want you to see me that way. Why do you think I’m so introverted? I’ve always been that way, I never saw the point in pretending I enjoyed something for the sake of blending in. I only went to that party because Gabriel thought it would be a good idea. He was sick, that’s why he wasn’t there. After that, it was as much about being safe as not seeing the point.”
“No, it’s not. But it seems they’ve taken offense.” He carefully retrieved his phone from his pocket, unlocking it and placing it on an area of the table that hadn’t just been wiped clean of drink. “What are your names?”
Whatever he’d expected, it wasn’t to find Gabriel leaning against a nearby tree, munching on one of those triangular candy bars. He gave a start when he saw the elder Angel essentially pop into existence after he touched down, especially since he hadn’t sensed anyone. It was reinforcement of his notion that Archangels weren’t among those you wanted to irk.
As he watched, propped up on his elbows, Dean got some of the clear substance on his fingers. He coated two digits to the knuckle, then to the Angel’s surprise, dipped his head to lightly lick the tip of his cock. It was already half hard and working its way to full attention, but the light flick of a hot tongue made him gasp outright.
Their exchange was brief and exclusive, though Castiel’s mouth was twitching a bit as he went to shake Gadreel’s hand in turn, greeting him in his usual stoic fashion. Castiel knew certain details of certain things because he was Castiel, he was their mother. Just like there were a few details Dean knew because he was Dean. In this case, Samandriel had decided it was best for all involved if the man he called ‘Dad’ was blissfully unaware of how they met. As far as he knew, they’d met on Bourbon Street, which was true. What he did not know was that the recently-of-legal-drinking-age Omega had gone there when Mardi Gras was in full swing. He did not know Gadreel, owner and bartender of one of their establishments, had plucked him out of a particularly rowdy crowd before the police had to get involved. He did not know Gadreel had offered him a drink while things settled down, or that Samandriel had woken up the next morning in the Kodiak’s bed with no hangover and the discovery that getting fucked against an assortment of flat surfaces left you sore the next morning. No, he would much rather Dean not know that, so would Gadreel. The Alpha was a true gentlemen by all accounts, he’d refused to so much as kiss him until he’d bought him dinner, had somehow managed to put off sex for nearly a month while he tried to alternately court him and convince him he was not a good choice in boyfriends. It had helped a bit when he knew precisely what Samandriel was. Not a witch, but just as strong, if not stronger. More importantly, Castiel’s case was unusual enough it had trickled down to the other branches of non-human folk. Shifters had heard of him too, the will-o’-the-wisp who gave up his immortality to live with a human.
They were kissing again when Dean pulled away abruptly. “Wait, you don’t live in the barracks, do you? ‘Cause that’s gonna get real tight, real fast.”
The Omega glanced over to make sure both Winchesters were out of earshot before lowering his voice and stating simply, "We just came from a cemetery."
Castiel blinked. Well, that had backfired. “I will not touch them. That was my point, I will leave them be.”
“I do.” But rather than explain, he picked up a burger and took a bite. Normally he displayed restraint, but he was fairly sure sounds could also be used to entice a mate. So he moaned as he bit into one of his favorite treats. Not a lot, and not very loud, but enough to not be mistaken.
Dean rolled his eyes in exasperation, passing him the notebook sheet of written questions. “First one, Cas.”
Castiel’s head tilted slightly, brows furrowing. “I thought that was the purpose of meeting your family, to ease their concerns and allow them the opportunity to satisfy their curiosity.”
"It's the job. Go back to this little town about a week's ride north of here pretty regular, but I wouldn't call it home."
Dean grimaced. “Yeah, well, you win some, you lose some. Anyway, my point is…if you want to talk to us, say hi or whatever, that’s okay. We’re happy to talk to you, take selfies, or whatever. In fact, we enjoy it. But please don’t make assumptions, and don’t do things based on those assumptions.” He paused for a second, then looked at Castiel over the camera. “Sound good?”
Resting a comforting hand on the Omega's arm, Dean turned to face them. "The dragon isn't a threat to you," he called, the babble of questions falling silent as he spoke. "They never were. But they're leaving the area anyway."
Before Castiel could ask, Uriel was pivoting around, thrusting a palm up towards him, something silver in his hand. The Seraph barely had time to throw up his grace in a crude shield before he was struck with a blast that knocked him off his feet. He went down hard on his back, still clutching his blade, stunned.
The Archangel smirked. “That’s part of why I came out here. I felt it break, again. There’s this teeny, tiny crack out in the garden. This one showed up about twelve hours before I got word a Knight of Hell had been killed. You know that’s all it takes to break a trap.”
What traces of amusement he felt vanished as he saw Hannah start to approach from Dean’s left, two more doing the same from other sides. Each were armed, each were raising their blades. Dean noticed, he couldn’t not, but he didn’t raise his own weapon.
“It’s the closest to an apple pie life I’m ever gonna get,” Dean reasoned, still smiling. “Just wasn’t sure if you’d wanna keep a Demon like me around.”
Among the first items to be piled into their carts were six packs of sodas, diapers, and baby wipes. Supposedly so they wouldn't crush anything else they loaded into the buggies. Then they moved on to health and beauty products, by which time Castiel had a feeling he'd be sent to fetch another cart before they were done.
Dean glanced to either side. He’d dragged them in to a half folded position, so each wingtip had an inch or two of clearance between them and bathroom tile. “Yeah. Can you see them?”
Castiel had everything ready by the time their first early morning rush hit, mostly people coming in for their coffee fix. He went through the rest of the shift mechanically, aware he probably looked as weary as he felt. No one cared, though, no one ever did. As long as he could still ring them up.
This was his least favorite part of his heats, crossing the distance to where he might find someone sufficient to lure. Even as a dancing ball of flame he still felt the draw, to return to the safety of his nest. It was a very long three miles from there to the road, where he decided to begin his search. It was the nearest point to his nest but still far enough away that anyone who came looking for them would still be turned around. Even before the more sophisticated forensic methods, his people had mastered the art of breeding and disappearing without leaving a trace. Part of his preparations had been to lay down disorientation and confusion spells around his nest, as well as lay out previsions so they wouldn't go hungry or thirsty. When the ritual was complete a spell placed over the Alpha's corpse would have the very earth swallow them up along with the used nest, erasing the last pieces of evidence before they returned to their communities.
"So they can't do anything. It's pancreatic cancer, stage four. Even if I did take any of the meds they wouldn't do me much good, and I don't want to go around zombified my last days on earth. There's nothing they can do, so I'm going to keep hunting until something finishes the job. Thought it might be a good idea to tie up some loose ends while I was at it."
The present from Jody and Bobby was far easier to accept. At least in his case he wasn’t going to run the gamble of not liking this very nice bottle of scotch, he’d tried some over at Rufus’s place once. It was the good stuff.
Even knowing he had to leave, Castiel found himself reluctant. The children would be awake and the longer he was gone the more chance there was of attention being drawn. But...damn it all he was
Gabriel made a face but he didn't respond, he just dropped onto the least rotten section of worn flooring. They'd set up camp around what remained of what used to be a hunting cabin. Most of the walls were gone, but the more fragile wood was doing their fire good. It was burning a safe distance from the cabin's remains, all of which was inside a circle of protective sigils the wendigo couldn't cross. This was their second night in the woods, and Castiel was hoping it would be their last. This whole camping thing wasn't to his taste.
Once they were inside Castiel took to his flamed form, waiting until Balthazar had joined him to cloak them in Mist and rise into the sky.
"I noticed." Callused fingers gripped his chin, his hold firm but gentle. Castiel turned his head one way, then the other. "You're going to have a wicked shiner. Looks like you hit some of the shards into your face. I think I can get some of the bigger pieces out. Want me to try?"
Licking his lips, Dean glanced back around the room, then focused his attention on the people gathered in front of him. It looked like an old warehouse, a few of the stained windows broken, but the lights were working well enough. There were some dust-covered crates stacked along two story walls, some tarps, some general clutter, but not much else. Frankly he was a little more worried about the fact that no less than forty people were in front of him, ignoring him, and arguing adamantly amongst themselves.
When he tramped back through the door for what he hoped to be the last time this visit, Castiel found Dean poking at the two remotes. The television set appeared to be set up and operational, along with the box that would get the shows that would hopefully keep Dean occupied. The Demon looked up as the snowing screen started showing pictures, which Castiel took to be a good thing.
Dean had had enough. He'd have to hash things out with his mate later, but for now he wasn't about to let Castiel get caught in the middle of this. His first question was going to be what the hell he was thinking. The Omega didn't like conflict, not between the Winchesters. He had proved useful time after time on hunts, had no qualms about ganking monsters, but the minute Sam and John started yelling he'd disappear somewhere to wait it out.
Dean hesitated, then his shoulders slumped. Something like worn weariness crossed his face, all the things he kept buried around Sam finally allowed to surface. He still managed a tight smile, reaching up to clasp Castiel's wrist. It was answer enough.
He switched gears as he moved to stand by the couch, brow furrowed. Unlike Dean, he wasn’t exactly privy to his enemy’s mating practices. Did they touch each other’s wings? Did they give certain gifts? Prepare certain foods? Make certain gestures?
Castiel spared a glance for Gabriel, who was crouched by their fire. Thankfully they'd managed to convince the worried loved ones to hold off coming into the forest themselves, even if it meant they were out here alone. At least the other Omega didn't seem overly concerned by that part. He seemed more worried about the thing that was trying to hunt them.
“It’s the internet, the ideas were already there. If they’re given a conduit perhaps you won’t be bombarded with so many unpleasant requests. Frankly I don’t mind answering some of the ones I saw- “
This one only got a few strides away before he stopped short, body tensing as the scent reached him. Without his flames there was only a little moonlight and the dimming flashlight aimed at the ground between them. This was the first time Castiel had bothered taking a good look at the Alpha, who was gaping at him even as his eyes dilated, breath hitching.
Reluctantly, feeling ill as he took in her tone, her expression, Castiel made himself put one foot in front of the other. The last thing he needed to show his mother was weakness, especially with his kids watching.
Castiel’s temper only grew hotter as Dean blinked, the Demon’s own anger apparently halted. “Did you just call me sour-tongued?”
The Omega tilted his head, studying the windows. Mmm, it'd been a while since they'd been fogged up in this fashion, but then it
“Expression, Cas,” Dean drawled, flipping cooking patties in his pan. It was something he’d said with frequent regularity.
“It’s not even about that,” the Demon interjected. Quite enthusiastically, considering not having to worry about STD’s was something Castiel regarded as a boon to their existence.
He’d taken a page from Bobby’s book, becoming a source for tools, information, and strategies for other Slayers. The father figure was also mate to a strong healer, one who seemed to be a surrogate mother to the semi-retired Slayer. Each time Castiel became pregnant Dean would fetch Ellen to check on him. Each time his third trimester was reaching its peak he would fetch her again and Ellen would stay with them to help him through the birth. Castiel liked Ellen, she was kind, no-nonsense, and far more maternal than his own mother had been. In truth he’d essentially been disowned when they’d found out he’d mated a human, which hadn’t been a big surprise for all it’d still hurt. The only one who hadn’t had been dismayed had been Gabriel, who’d been delighted by the whole thing and was one of their kit’s favorite uncles. Right up there with Uncle Sam, who was now mated to Uncle Gabriel. If all went well Castiel would have his first niece or nephew within a few months.
Since Christmas fell on a Wednesday this year, they’d decided to drive over to Mary’s on Saturday. That is until Dean decided he didn’t want to risk traffic, and see if it was any better at night. Castiel had slept through half the trip, but Dean swore up and down it was much easier. Despite Friday night traffic trumping Saturday morning traffic, Castiel insisted they drive home during the day, if only because they wouldn’t be able to record at night. There wasn’t enough light without impairing Dean’s ability to drive. Mary also hadn’t liked them driving at night on tricky roads. Between the two of them they were able to talk Dean out of another overnight trip.
“I like to eat. If you want something done right, do it yourself. Besides, everyone needs a hobby. You have bees, I’ve got this.”
Gabriel grimaced slightly, sitting in a fashion that favored his backside. "We still have cake, right?"
Dean stared at him for another minute, then turned away to set the gun down on the table. He stepped forward, wrapping both arms around the Angel and holding him tight. Castiel returned the embrace, a little surprised but not at all displeased. Dean was better with actions than words, he knew. He’d assumed it was part of his ravenous sexual appetite, it being easier to engage in intercourse than verbally express affection.
Castiel grabbed the gun, offering it grip-first to him. “Demons. They need all the help they can get.”
Castiel brought the stack of pizza boxes inside, pushing the door closed and setting them on a free stretch of counter. He was in the process of looking for plates when he heard, “You got pizza?”
Dean scratched the back of his skull. "Well, you could homeschool 'em if you want. And there's always online classes."
He guided the cart through the isle that had laundry detergents on the way to the cold food section, grabbing a box of dryer sheets. As they went back onto the main isle he looked over, reading off the fourth question. “’Do you hand out candy every year?’ Yes. But we have to get two bags.”
Reluctant plan set in place, the Angel landed just outside their current base of operations. A plant of some sort humans had abandoned a decade or so ago, nice and isolated. He absentmindedly saluted those guarding its lone entrance, trudging inside, folding warm wings to his back.
capable." Dean was close enough now for Castiel to reach up, pressing a hand to his chest. "In the future you will be kept strictly up to date, but I won't stop. Isn't this part of it? Saving people, hunting things, the family business. We hunted a thing, we saved people, and are we not family?"
“He’s smart about it,” Gabriel reminded him dismissively. “There’s a reason we prefer special chains and prisons to hold our P.O.W.’s. There’s a reason Sam’s got this really nice bracelet with charms and sigils in it to keep him inside a perimeter. Devil’s Traps can be unreliable. If the Demon’s strong enough, they just need to give a little seismic jiggle and boom, crack, they’re free.”
’. He’d tried to smooth out his ruffled hair after he’d showered, but Dean had simply ruffled it up again. To top off the image that so starkly contrasted the persona he held up at work, the mug he was currently using was decorated after the marauder’s map and proclaimed ‘
“Yeah you do. At every freaken’ opportunity. Plus you own every single “Let’s taco ‘bout it” and “Oh Whale” t-shirt ever made.”
In the end he did cum with a cry, with only the Alpha's tongue and digits inside him. He almost buckled to the ground, but was held upright. Castiel was still catching his breath when the Alpha finally, at long last, mounted him. He moaned long and loud as a hard, hot cock slowly pressed inside him.
“We’d been doing and doing for over a month at that point. We were beat,” Dean admitted. “So we spent the last two weeks of our time off putting our feet up and leaving the house as little as possible.”
“It is. Speaking of which, I need to swing by France before I head home. I promised I’d bring him fresh ingredients for dinner.”
"Attempt ain't a guarantee," Dean pointed out casually, shrugging. "Better move him before we blow town."
They’d slowed to a stop, all of them able to feel it now. It was close, this seam. It took a moment, but Benny saw it. A ripple in space at the top of a rise, leaves and brush drifting towards it, disappearing in a faint flicker of light. Their way out.
Castiel thought she was speaking to him and Dean, but when he made to obey she caught his arm. “Not you. Them. I brewed up some decaf.”
Dean huffed as he was dumped flat to his back, his basketball shorts slipped off his hips and down his legs. Castiel somehow managed to get them over is clunky boot in mere seconds. Dean sucked in a sharp breath, then bit back a whimper when his mate growled softly at the sight of his underwear. His mate had always seemed to delight in the shy Omega’s kinks. Among those were panties, which he wore as often as he did boxers. He honestly hadn’t thought he’d be getting laid today, but they were comfortable and he’d been in the mood to feel sexy this morning. Now he was very glad he’d put on the pink silk bikini, a tremor running down his spine as he saw the look in his mate’s eyes.
“Didn’t scare me,” Dean protested automatically. That much was true. They had fights, but they were always verbal, and he always gave as good as he got. Never had Castiel raised a hand to him. Well, never in a way that wasn’t in consensual sexy fun. Never had Castiel been the domineering, controlling bastard John had been. But after so long some reactions had become ingrained, and Dean hated when they were triggered. He hated it even more when Castiel noticed and started treating him like he was made of fragile glass. Hated that John had had such a lasting effect.
Perhaps he should have punched Dean. Put him through a wall. But that would have risked compromising the wards. Stabbed him? No, in his condition he’d have to heal the damage right away.
Castiel visibly relaxed when Dean said the word ‘brother’, and returned to the compliant behavior he’d been displaying all morning. He obligingly stepped aside, the blade disappearing, wings going transparent again as they folded themselves to his back once more. Sam clamped his mouth shut, stumbling inside when Dean dragged him in so he could shut the door.
His mate turned, smiling wryly as Castiel offered him two fresh clips of silver bullets. "Thanks, Cas."
Lucifer scratched his jaw with a single finger, out of eye sight of the kids now clambering on a playset, making Gabriel snicker.
“If all goes well, soon there will only be one Winchester Knight to deal with. Good riddance. If you insist on going, go carefully. You’re the most reasonable commander I’ve had the pleasure to serve under.”
The Omega took his time, taking care to make sure the human never got closer than twenty feet or so. He stayed just within sight, enough to keep the Alpha's attention but not enough to disappear. He preferred more distance, but it was foggy tonight, which would work in his favor for all it meant he couldn't get too far ahead.
“’Putting a lot of trust in you, brother,” the vampire reminded him, chin dipping in a nod of recognition.
In all honesty Castiel had seen worse in the glow of his grace. This Demon was dying, not dead. Someone had certainly done a good job of trying, though. Besides missing armor, weapons, and footgear, his clothes were in tatters. By the looks of it his pants had once been jeans, but they were covered in mud, gore, and who knew what else, torn and ratty. What remained of any shirt clung to him in bits and pieces held together by the barest of threads and wishful thinking. It made it very easy to see all the wounds. Cuts and bruises covered every square inch, several fingers pointing in odd directions, a cut over one eye bled sluggishly, half blinding the Demon. A particularly nasty gash was cut across the right side of his chest, and unless Castiel was mistaken they were using their good hand to hold a belly wound closed. The sort of wound that had entrails spilling onto a battlefield.
. Because stuff like this doesn't happen to him. The Crown Prince doesn't just throw himself at people like Dean—it would be too perfect—and yet, here he is, grinding down on the man's lap, feeling like every part of heaven is falling down around him, soaking him in its glory.
Castiel opens his mouth to respond, but Susie cuts them both off with a sharp look. “Oh, you think that’s funny, Mr. Winchester?”
He laughs, but the weight on his chest from his conversation with Kelly the night before drags the airy sound into a bitter bark. He shakes his head, looking into the middle ground by Nicholas's shoes before answering. "I've learned that making friends here isn't really at the top of anyone's priority list."
“Come Thursday, we will be embarking on our first group date.” Murmurs fill the air and Castiel waits for them to quiet before he continues. “The orchards are in prime condition for harvest, so we will be going apple picking before returning to the palace kitchens to make ourselves dessert.”
“What’s the matter?” Castiel must feel the tension inside him, growing and shifting with every passing second, and Dean doesn’t have the energy to lie.
to tell him. It's all too much—too fucking much—and he should trust his prince, same as he sees all that precious trust Castiel has in him. He should believe in the fact that Castiel is a powerful man; that he can protect Dean's family, and keep him safe, too.
"D'you know what happened to him?" Dean whispers, watching closely for the spike of pain that keeps flashing in Castiel's eyes. Yep, there it is again.
"Want to jump in the leaves with me?" Dean asks instead, forcing a smile he knows Castiel sees right through, but he can't tell him, and he can't lie to him, either.
“He did, in fact,” Hannah says, soft and gentle, and with the kind of smile that tells him she wishes what she’s saying wasn’t true.
are you doing, boy?" Susie takes a step back, out the way of his flailing arms—her eyes wide and a little annoyed. "Don't be ridiculous; I won't
Logically, Dean knows the echoing footsteps growing closer in the dark passageway are Castiel’s, but his heart still seizes with the sound. He swallows the lump in his throat, sitting still as a statues as he waits, until—
“Calm down, pretty boy—cover’s dealt with.” Gordon slaps his back, shoving him along and jostling his shoulder—not enough to actually hurt, but he still winces like it does.
Dean tries not to sink into those thoughts, but it’s hard when he’s sitting up here and Hannah’s down there—having dismounted her horse—talking quietly with Castiel, their heads bent close as they laugh and joke about things Dean will never understand.
“Who’s ready for the final three?” Duma says, turning her back on the camera to face the crowd, and Dean swears he can hear them yell through the walls. “Okay! Okay, number three goes to someone near and dear to this kingdom’s heart—someone very special to the prince, you could say. Number three is her royal highness, Hannah Becket!”
“What are you waiting for?” Those lips smile, eyes crinkling at the corners, and Dean’s heart races, his hands sliding up Castiel’s arms until they reach his cheeks.
“What did I say, pretty boy?” Charlie nudges him with her elbow as Hannah squeezes his hand, but all Dean can do is sit in silent dread.
It's disconcerting how on the nose Castiel is. A testament to how well they've gotten to know each other, perhaps.
The grand ballroom—easily filled with two hundred people—falls into a hush so absolute chills race down Dean’s spine as they wait for the doors to open one more time.
, nearly drunk enough for a nasty hangover, and Dean has a knot in his stomach telling him they might be taking advantage of his laidback, relaxed state.
"You're missing it," Dean murmurs, talking around the echoing booms, but still getting cut off as one shatters the sky. Castiel only smiles, and he doesn't look away, but lets his gaze travel over Dean's face, taking him in.
“He came to your room?” Charlie blurts as Dean contemplates the space between Hannah’s bed and the wall—how does she manage to climb in and out?
Dean rolls his eyes, but his stomach has settled and he smiles. “I’ll do my best,” he says and shoots her a wink.
He scowls. “Yeah, Alfie,” and points over his shoulder at the cameraman, who gives a tiny, awkward wave before hiding back behind his camera. “We were trying to find the kitchens.” Sure, let’s go with that.
the place. It’s a tiny little soup kitchen built into the only twenty-four hour shelter in the kingdom. At some points in Dean’s life, it was the only thing that kept him from starving to death.
Dean sucks in a breath when he spots Castiel in one of the leather chairs in front of the desk, but it freezes in his lungs when he catches sight of the queen in the corner, pouring herself a drink.
She huffs, visibly reaching the end of her patience as she drops her hands to her hips and glares, her Amarellinian accent getting thicker as her annoyance mounts. “I have twenty minutes, Mr. Winchester! You need to be
For a moment, Castiel doesn’t speak. He just stands there, a piece of crumpled paper in his fist and his mouth open like he’s about to say something, but doesn’t. His eyes give Dean a quick once-over, making him shift on the spot, but they lock on his so fast and hard that the fury Dean sees there almost knocks him off his feet.
He wanders into the garden, once again finding a spot in the grass amongst the flowers to eat and cheer himself up. The birds sing and flowers bloom as the sun creeps its way into the sky, warming the cool morning air that nips at his nose.
“Hannah, would you mind helping Charlie?” he asks, catching her arm on her way by with a pleading smile.
Dean’s grin widens as he does what he’s told, barely noticing Alfie as he hovers close to Dean’s side.
His mind floats in the space between consciousness for a long time, catching snippets of conversation, before they're distorted by dreamland, but his eyes slide open when a deep, gravelly voice speaks, closer than the others.
He leans closer, lowering his voice to a mere whisper. "Are you, Crown Prince Castiel Charles James Novak, flirting with
It's almost embarrassing to know how bad he is at hiding his feelings, but the warmth blossoming in his chest is soft and fuzzy, making him feel more loved than he has in so long.
He’d ordered the custom outfit from a local vendor at last year’s parade, working with the man to fine-tune his specifications, and he hadn’t been disappointed. Garth is magic behind a sewing machine, and a good friend to boot, so he’d been able to whip Dean’s order up just in time for this year’s festivities.
“Dorothy,” Charlie says, leaning against the doorframe with her arms crossed and a pleased grin on her face. “Figured I’d show you, too. Y’know, since we don’t have secrets.”
?” Dean begs, hands pressed together close to his chest as he follows the frazzled cook around the kitchen. “It’s for the prince.”
“Not a bad idea, actually.” She tilts her head to the side, looking thoughtful and ignoring the dig all at the same time as Dean rolls his eyes. She nods, slapping his bare, sweaty arm. “Thanks, Winchester.”
to deserve him, at the very least—and having his hopes crash and burn right before his eyes is the worst kind of pain he’s ever felt. He wanted it to be him so badly, and how that it won't be, he doesn't know what to do.
Dean’s stomach turns at the sight of his indulgent smile, and the way he helps her press down the edges. The fact that Sarah’s beyond beautiful, even sweating, covered in flour, with her hair tucked into a hairnet, doesn’t make it better, either.
“Seriously? Charlie, come on,” Anna says, staring at the little pencil-stick with a tired look. “Just leave the poor guy alone.”
This one is really long, which is funny because it was supposed to be really short. Just like this fic. What is wrong with me?
He’s never felt so alone—not here, or anywhere else—but the weight of it, and the constant, battering self-doubt, makes him think this is all happening for a reason.
“Me too.” Dean closes his eyes, feeling warm and safe and more loved in that moment than he ever has. “I need to clean you up,” Castiel says but, still, he doesn’t pull away, holding on for dear life, his hands clenched in Dean’s shirt with his nose hurried in Dean’s neck. “And you need to stop touching me before one of my guards comes in and puts you in a chokehold.”
“Pleasure is all mine,” Castiel replies, and his deep, rough-honey voice sends tingles down Dean’s spine. “Dean has told me so much about you, especially…” Castiel survey’s the group, but Sam’s not there.
He stops walking and tilts his face to the cloudless sky. He needs to remind himself that Castiel has yet to even
. He takes a bigger sip before gulping down half the cup, burning his tongue in the process. “I’ve only been telling you since I met you—the people
Castiel slips off his gloves and tucks them in his pocket as he speaks. “Reginald, I trust you’re well?”
“We went out, Cas. So, what? I’m not a fucking prisoner here, and neither are they,” he says, throwing his thumb up to point over his shoulder at the others. “We were out for a few hours—who fucking cares? Calling the
“Come here,” Charlie says, cupping his chin and holding his head still as she brings the pencil closer to his eye. “This’ll make those big, green eyes of yours pop like crazy!”
Castiel dusts the powder over Dean’s face as he answers. “I’ve been on numerous newscasts throughout my life. I’ve picked up a few things along the way.”
Dean's heart just about leaps out of his throat when Cookie rears up, pulling the reins from his hands and sending him stumbling back. He falls to the ground, hitting the half-frozen dirt with a shock of pain and thundering terror.
“Inexperienced, not stupid,” he corrects, standing his ground when all she does is cock her head to the side.
There’s pain there, and fear, but more than either of those, Dean can see the preemptive hurt. He knows why—of course, he does—but there’s really no reason for it.
Dean doesn’t know how long he waits, but eventually, he moves away from the door and sits on the floor with his back resting against the bed frame. It could be hours that he sits there—and he’s sure it probably is because the next time the door opens, it’s long gone dark outside the glass doors into the garden.
“Menace,” he whispers, though more to himself than to Dean, and crosses the room to put his kit back in its cupboard.
Dean’s stomach summersaults, dipping, and diving—threatening his dinner—when the doors crack open and Castiel steps through in a simple black suit with a sapphire tie to match the ten long-stemmed roses on the table waiting to be given out.
don’t even think it half the time—but here I am.“ He throws his hands out to his sides and slaps them against his thighs as he shrugs again. “Who knows for how much longer, but I’ll take all the time I can get with Cas—with the prince.” Dean feels a smile tugging at his lips and he tries to fight it as a blush follows close behind. He looks down at his hands as he twists them in his lap. “He’s—the prince, that is—he’s pretty damn special.” He jerks his shoulders in yet another shrug—for good measure. "It's a privilege just to speak with him." As he says it, he realizes just how true it is. The prince is something special and rare, and that scares Dean even more.
He doesn’t want their pain pills, though; he doesn’t need them, and he sure as shit doesn’t need anyone taking care of him—he does well enough on his own, thank you very much.
“Go ahead,” Castiel whispers, watching Dean with keen, penetrating eyes. Dean rests a few fingers on the handle and pushes it down, letting it swing in as he holds his breath.
his parents to go. Every year, he’d look up at the towering Ferris wheel, the tunnel of love, and the tilt-a-whirl, and ache to get in line. Every year it’s too expensive.
Dean’s free hand flies up to Castiel’s hair, sinking his fingers into the tangled locks and giving a sharp tug. It’s slopping and rough, all teeth and tongue, and Castiel dives into it, rolling his hips into Dean’s fist as he hardens in his palm.
He doesn’t say anything—not out loud, anyway—but the question in his eyes is so obvious, it has an ache building right behind his ribcage.
"Damn, I was just trying to find the kitchen," Dean whispers, looking away from Castiel, but he jumps when his prince laughs, his eyes snapping back to see full lips twisted in a smile and glittering blue eyes.
He grunts, sliding a hand over Castiel’s, who lets go immediately, soothing his aching leg as Dean twines their fingers together.
The doctor nods, looking startled and more than a little jumpy as she bobs her head in a vigorous nod before barking orders at her staff.
they haven’t tweaked the recipe or added something new—but still, he would swear on his last pair of hole-free socks that it’s the best slice of cherry pie he’s ever had.
April got the date instead of him, and now there’s a sour feeling twisting his gut. Castiel had barely looked his way all through dinner, and Dean can’t figure out what he did wrong, or if he did anything wrong in the first place.
"How’s the royal-adjacent douchebag?" Dean asks, flicking his eyes to Lucifer as he scoops a crêpe into his hands and takes a bite.
“He is, yes, but he’s being ridiculously stoic for some reason.” He cuts a narrow-eyed look in Castiel’s direction.
“He’s supposed to meet us by the fountain,” Dean tells Charlie, craning his neck to see past the jostling crowd to where the streets meet in the middle—the normally-dull, stone figure at its centre is covered in streamers and glitter of every colour and shine. This is where the parade will start, and the flash and pop of every colour of the rainbow, in every direction he looks, is evidence of that.
“Hold up,” Victor says, sitting up straight with both hands up in front of him. “Dean, don’t take this the wrong way, man. I know I said you could join, but you’re going to need a whole lot more training than I can give you in, what? Six weeks, maximum? You’ve got the drive, I’ll give you that, but the life of a soldier…” he shakes his head, eyes growing distant before snapping back to Dean’s. “I know your childhood wasn’t the greatest, and you learned how to fight for what’s yours, but—”
“No, honey—” Dean’s mom starts, but there’s a knock on the door, startling them all to their feet. All but Castiel, who looks at the door like he’s expecting someone.
The chatter quiets down, and Dean sits up from his lounging state, giving Charlie a nudge with the tip of his sock-covered toe. She gives him a swat but tosses his stollen shoe back in his lap. What a fucking weirdo.
After an exhausting day of filming and socializing, Dean would’ve thought he’d fall asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, but alas, that isn’t the case.
“Shave the scruff,” Dean pouts, but he doesn’t pull away, letting her turn his face from side to side.
Black drapes, photo setups, and flash reflectors fill half the room, and there's so much chaotic energy buzzing around, Dean can't figure out how anyone would find this
! Is that why she was sent home? Dean's stomach turns at the thought of her forcing herself on his prince, and now Castiel has to watch it all over again? To relive it with everyone else? Even if the footage does cut off after that, they still get to see it, and his sweet, shy, kinder-than-he-needs-to-be prince has to suffer under the scrutiny of their judgement for
, but—” Castiel flushes, his cheeks darkening almost enough to match his suit, and he huffs. “But, you’re meeting with a
“I need you to step up on your platform now.” His voice is flat and professional, and somehow, it gives Dean the energy to do as he’s told. If he can just get through the next half-hour, he’ll be free of this humiliating ordeal.
“Who am I to meet of your family tonight?” Castiel asks when his plate is clean, and the servants take it away.
“Come on!” Victor shouts, waving them on, but not to the end of the line like Dean expects. Instead, they waltz right up to the bouncer in their ripped jeans and paint-splattered shirts. Victor has a short conversation with the mountain of a man—their heads ducked close to hear over the bass—before he shows them inside.
"Not like that. There's these people—they don't like me, and they want me out. I got drunk and I was carrying my pie back to the couch, and I don't even know how they managed it, but I tripped, and..." He breaks off on a sob. Everything just
They’re being clipped with microphones since this, too, will be broadcasted, but all Dean can think about is the headache starting up in his temples. He’s irritable and upset and he just wants to
Dean laughs as he turns away, but it's bitter and annoyed, and he pulls out his shirt just to spite her before hurrying to catch up with Charlie. Hannah shouts after him, but he ignores her—he’s not about to change who he is just to meet someone else’s expectations of how he should be and it’s best if she learns that now.
He pulls off, then, gasping for breath, spit stringing from the tip of Castiel’s cock to his bottom lip. “I am, too, by the way. Got tested after I found out Benny cheated on me.”
. It’s clumsy and their teeth knock, but Dean’s knees shake and his heart just about beats through his ribcage as Castiel sinks his fingers into Dean’s hair, pulling him closer with a good, hard tug. His prince melts into the kiss, opening his mouth and letting Dean in.
So he gives him the former. Without warning, he swallows Dean down, hollowing his cheeks and sucking as hard as he can. He’s given a lot of blowjobs in his thirty-five years—more than half of them in his freshman year of college—but he wants this one to be the best. Something about Dean’s breathy gasps, the way he arches his spine, his hips rolling and lashes fluttering—God, Castiel can feel himself getting hard already.
Dean crams the paper under his bed with the others without a second thought, his heart racing. Shivers dance along his spine like eyes are peeping through the windows, and he hurries to double check the locks and sweep the curtains closed.
Dean starts to pull his hand away, hyper-conscious of the solid muscle of Castiel’s thigh under his palm, but Castiel holds fast, twining their fingers together as he speaks.
Dean doesn’t dare to say anything as Susie dresses him, muttering under her breath. She tugs at his clothes a little harder than she has to, jerking him around as she pulls his pants up his legs—forces his arms into the sleeves of a white button-down—and a waistcoat is pulled up over his shoulders.
Dean waits with bated breath, both terrified of being rejected—told it's too dangerous for someone like him—and hopeful that Castiel might support him in his desire to serve him.
“Aw, how sweet,” a saccharine voice says behind him, and Dean's mood plummets when he turns to see Meg, Michael, and April step into the dining hall. “Is he your new fling? Or are you still seeing the club tramp?”
"I'm sorry, Dean, but every person on camera is now considered a witness and could be called on for questioning if the events of the trial are deemed unjust. You are required to attend."
“About me; that I’m not of noble birth, or money,” Dean finishes for him, and the way Castiel’s shoulders sag, all the air whooshing from his lungs, tells Dean that’s exactly it.
“Suse, I need to tell you something,” Dean says, then looks to the rest of the girls, who lean in to hear.
“Best birthday ever,” Castiel breathes, chest heaving as he comes down from the high, sated and shaking. Dean doesn’t move, doesn’t look at him, instead staring somewhere around Castiel’s belly button.
When Dean pushes through the double doors and steps into the empty hallway, he’s panting, and he stops to shove both hands through his hair, not caring if he messes it up. He tilts his head back, feeling anger pulse through him in waves. God, how can people be such
Dean’s stomach swoops and dips, sending shivers down his spine as his heart thunders out of control. How can the heir to the throne be so fucking
Dean doesn’t think about any of that, because all he can picture is Castiel kissing April, and it breaks his heart, over, and over, and over again.
Dean is speechless for a moment, unable to move but, eventually, he gives a shaky nod and steps into the crowd, which parts for them. With every step they take, Dean can feel the crackle of awareness in the air; people are watching them—well, watching
“I—yes. Yes, I know.” He smiles, warm and radiant, but a little sad. His hands move from Dean’s neck, sliding over his shoulders before skipping to his waist, and Dean shivers, his breath catching. “You should get ready for dinner.”
“He's my boy as much as he's his momma's,” she murmurs, setting her papers aside before rummaging through the garment bags again. “They know that.”
It's sickening, really, and Dean's stomach turns the moment he sees the men and women in chains at the feet of the royals. They're worse off than he's ever been—dirty and sickly in their tattered clothes and matted hair—and Dean has to turn away before guilt eats him alive.
“Dean, the pizza guy,” Castiel murmurs, taking the hat from his head and setting it aside. It’s covered in sauce, and there’s a pepperoni in his hair, so Castiel plucks that out, too.
Still keeping with the once a week posting schedule because it'll be about the only consistent thing I do, so sorry or you're welcome, depending on how you feel about it.
Dean paces the entrance hall, back and forth and back again. He’s freshly suited up in a replica of the one from earlier today, only now he can add another tally to his list of tongue-lashings from Susie—not the fun kind, either because…
,” Castiel says, and Dean jumps, turning wide eyes on Castiel. “I’m afraid I need to head back.” Castiel gives him a tight smile, his disappointment evident, and Dean’s displeasure swells up to match what he sees in the prince’s eyes. “It was lovely meeting you all, and I hope we get another opportunity to speak.” He smiles at Dean's family, giving each of them a short nod, before meeting Dean’s gaze one more time. “Dean.”
He wanders in a little further, feeling the squishy carpet under his shoes as he turns in a circle. There’s a fireplace on the wall to his left, opposite the bed, with a seating area around it, and Dean wants to sink down onto the cushions immediately.
“Thanks for the food,” he says when he sees the tray sitting on his bed, filled with more than he’d ever eat, and definitely more than he can eat with the lump in his throat. “Any news?”
“Which one?” Dean asks, his interest peaked with the mention of Castiel and his charities. The fascination he’s always held with the Crown Prince’s endeavors has in no way lessened over the last six weeks, and in fact, has made him love the man all the more. Even now, a pleasant shiver makes its way through him as he thinks of the man caring for his people.
The cheering crowd overpowers Lydia, drowning out the rest of her words as Dean takes a deep, steadying breath, looks at Castiel, and walks out on stage with his prince at his side.
Dean grins, trying in vain to wipe the flour off his cheeks as they meet in the middle, Castiel still grinning as his eyes shine in a way his late grandmother's hadn’t.
"It takes vision." She gives him a look like a challenge. "It takes a keen mind, willing and able to look beyond the everyday, and into the future." She doesn't elaborate or tell him he possesses none of those things. She doesn't even look at him, actually. Not for a good few minutes. "I'm sorry for my outburst during your presentation."
“His highness says she needs to get used to it.” That's all the boy says as he hands Dean the reins and offers him a nod before going back to his chores.
After a while, Castiel takes a deep, rattling breath. "Come, let's get you back to your room before Benny has a breakdown," he says and pushes himself up with more grace than Dean expects—though he still stumbles into the wall—and without even a moment's hesitation, he reaches for Dean to pull him up, too.
“Now, I’ve talked a lot about the problem, I know, but there’s a solution to all this that has far-reaching benefits for everyone.” Dean smiles, and he’s not sure why, but it feels right. “Universal healthcare,” he says, like it’s the simplest thing in the world.
“So this is where the magic happens, huh?” Jo says, grinning at Dean as she takes another step closer to the worktops and stoves. “Bet this is like heaven for you.”
Now, though, with Dean by his side, and Charlie there, too—along with about two-hundred-thousand others—Castiel can feel it. Community.
"He ignored you? Just like that?" Dean leans a bit closer, but ducks behind the wall when Castiel glances up, his heart skipping a beat as his breath catches, but he doesn't think he's been spotted. "I can't imagine anyone ignoring a lovely lady such as yourself."
from perfect. He’s a good boy, and a good prince, but sometimes…” Susie trails off with a sigh, smoothing a hand over her pristine hair before pulling Dean’s vest on, then the jacket, doing up all the buttons on those, too. “Sometimes, he hurts himself for the sake of duty. Too much, I say—he hurts himself all the time.”
"And you think the other suitors lack integrity?" Mick leans forward and he can tell just by the keen interest on the other man's face—who isn't supposed to say a word unless asked—that he's missing the point entirely.
“I just—” he stops. Pulls out of his arms with a sigh. “I wish… I don’t know, Cas, I wish I could’ve been your first kiss.” As soon as the words are out of his mouth, he knows it’s the wrong thing to say. Who the fuck says stuff like that? And to the person they’re trying to win over?
“Well, I don’t think I’d make it to any sort of championships, but I’m not too bad, huh?” Dean grins, pushing away from the fence as Castiel quirks an eyebrow. Dean turns away, his focus back on the ball, and this time, when Charlie sends it flying over the net and Dean swings like mad, he manages to hit it square in the middle of his racket. It flies back at Charlie so fast that she misses. For a minute, they're both too shocked to react.
Dean snaps his mouth shut, guilt flooding him as soon as he sees the defeated exhaustion in her eyes, and the way her shoulders fall. She looks like she’s at the end of her rope, and instead of pushing the issue, Dean steps forward and wraps her in a one-armed hug.
Lee snaps to attention, his sweaty t-shirt sticking to his chest, and his hairnet bunching up at the edges, but he smiles anyway, standing with his shoulders back and head held high, totally in charge.
?" he huffs. Can't a guy just take a nice, solitary walk in the rain? Instead of turning, he just squeezes his eyes shut as running feet squelch in the mud behind him, slipping and tripping, but Dean just waits.
“They think you attacked the prince, and I must say, the evidence against you is pretty damning.” She clears her throat, but still, Dean stares at her knees. There’s a lump rising in his throat, threatening to suffocate him. “They have to investigate, Dean. You understand?” He doesn’t answer—he knows his words mean nothing here—but she reads his thought anyway. “They will take your character into consideration—I’m sure Prince Novak will vouch for you—”
But he’s in distress, and Castiel isn’t that guy. He doesn’t take advantage of vulnerability, and yes, it really sucks that he can’t even give the guy his number because it feels wrong to give it to someone who is hyperventilating on his unmade, lumpy as hell motel bed.
“God, you’re so much hotter in person,” she says, her dark eyes glowing, and with Dean’s arm in a sling, he doesn’t quite manage to catch her hands before they glide up his chest and over his shoulders.
Who the hell decided public speaking isn't a form of torture? Because they're dead wrong, and Dean's been stuttering and stammering—tripping over his words and dropping his cards—during
"What's the matter, pretty boy?" he rumbles, using a nickname only a few others ever have. "Can't keep up?"
“Only the one show and, believe me, it was just as tedious and annoying as you’re imagining it.” He flashes her a winning smile and carries on. “So, somewhere around this time my dad lost his job, and we were really struggling to keep food on the table, you know?”
“Aprons are on the hooks. Make sure to wash your hands and tie back your hair—watch out for each other and
“Okay,” he says again, letting the weight of his worry fall away in the wake of Castiel’s assurances. What was he thinking? Of course, Castiel believes him, and of
"What's up?" he asks instead of dignifying that with a response. "How's he doing?" Dean lets his eyes wander to the man lying, still and pale, in the hospital bed. He tries not to stare too long, but it's hard with how skeletal Susie's husband is. His gaunt face is hollow in places it shouldn't be, and his sunken eyes give Dean the chills.
He starts to think maybe Castiel won't answer—the question, too intrusive, and his prince, too polite to refuse—but he sets his pie down, his hands coming to rest in his lap as he turns his torso to face Dean.
“Aww,” the crowd coos, almost in unison, and it catches Dean so off guard that his head snaps around, eyes wide and blinking through the bright lights. He smiles, soft and hesitant, and when he looks at Castiel, his prince mouths,
Dean swallows the lump in his throat, keeping his eyes glued to the screen as the silence stretches on.
“Castiel,” Dean returns, a smile on his face as he nods. He watches Castiel as he walks back to his throne and, once again, the crowd parts for him before meeting back in the middle to hide him from view.
of metal on priceless china before answering. "Yes," he says, and there's not a hint of hesitation in his voice. "It was my idea, after all."
Some time after lunch Dean finds himself in a random sitting room on an upper level of the palace, cursing technology to hell.
The list of names continues, jumping all over the place as person after person steps down from their platform, accepts their rose with enthusiasm, before practically dancing back to their place.
"Really? More suits?" Dean pushes himself up and pouts at the garment bag by her feet, only just noticing that it is, in fact, full of suits.
Dean can tell. Castiel’s eyes shine with the love he speaks of, much like Dean feels for Sam. They’d both do anything for their sibling, and the realization has Dean feeling all the more connected to the Crown Prince.
Dean starts to relax the longer he’s on the horse without falling off. Charlie rides ahead, but Hannah lags behind a little, chatting with Castiel as they make their way back to the stable. As Dean watches them, he can’t help but notice how comfortable Castiel is with Hannah, and he knows, deep down in his heart, that she’s the best match for him. It has his stomach twisting in knots just thinking about it, but he knows there’s nothing he can do—if Castiel’s going to choose Hannah over him, there isn't anything that’ll change his mind.
Castiel sits up, one eyebrow raised. "As I have told you before, I'm trained in combat, and you…" he says, trailing off as his eyes roam over Dean’s bare chest and loose-fitting sleep pants. "Are not."
“Here,” Castiel says, handing Dean a bottle without meeting his eyes. Dean takes it, but when their fingers brush, Castiel jerks away like it burns.
“Why not?” He scowls at her, crossing his arms over his chest. “Victor’s a soldier, and so is Dorothy; why can’t I?”
Benny examines his shoulder as he talks, rotating it here and there, before, with a sudden, excruciating tug-twist-pop, his shoulder sets back into place.
“Bail? But I don’t—Duma, I can’t afford bail. I’ll… I’ll go to prison, I’ll—” A lump lodges itself in Dean’s throat, cutting off his breathing and choking him with panic. “Cas, I can’t—” He looks to him, silently begging him to make it better, but Castiel’s face just about crumples.
The name is like a bomb dropped in the room—theirs a ringing in Dean’s ears, but everything is silent. He realizes every person in the room was expecting him to go home, too, and a flare of defiance lights in his chest when he sees the shock written all over their faces.
"Don't ask stupid questions," he tells him, hands on Castiel's stubbled cheeks, looking into his shining eyes, and he wants to kiss him. Wants to close the space between them so bad, but he doesn't. They're in the palace, and what they're doing is already too much.
“Dinner started only a few minutes ago.” Castiel steps around his desk, but scowls when he sees the soggy bandages Dean slapped back on after his shower. “But I need to change these first. Take them off while I grab my kit.”
“Maybe this is just a drill?” April says, but her voice wavers, and her hands shake as she brushes her hair over her shoulder—a poor mirror of the usual condescending move.
important to him, and maybe it’s stupid to feel so much, so early, but what if his worst fears come true? What if he loves too much?
