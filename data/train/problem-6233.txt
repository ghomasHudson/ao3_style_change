Tony:  OK, so Jane still will not budge on the New York Times interview, so we should probably work our way through the questions.
“No, definitely not.” Tony responded with a kiss that deepened quicker than it should have. “Now I think I can almost pull off a second round.”
Remember two weeks ago when I said that would be the last chapter before we would begin WandaVision. That’s what I thought at the time. However, circumstances have changed. Due to 2021 being the even worst sequel to 2020, Ursula not able to be the beta on this story. So as of the next chapter, my only beta for this story will be Grammarly. So there probably will be more typos, but you’ll get chapters every two weeks. (I’m also considering uploading a chapter next week to celebrate WandaVision.) I want to thank her for all her time working on the story.
“If we’re going to try to convince Parker to date both of us, I should probably work on getting his best friend not to hate me.”
And you’re probably right about me not making it to the West Coast anytime soon, which is more the reason for you to come do Thanksgiving at the compound. I promise it will be better than a board meeting.
Red phone: The only reason why she still there is the president appointed her personally. SI will also announce some public private partnerships with the OES Bureau because their Assistant Secretary was nowhere near as condescending as Ross.
I will say I had a lot of fun writing Clint and Natasha’s Interaction. I didn’t have enough of it in the first story. That will change here. At this point, it's evident that this story is going to be a bit more ensemble than the first one. Although we will still be working on getting Steve and Tony 2.0 to get their heads out of their asses. Since they have seven more years of baggage, this could take a while.
Red phone: It was his boss, not him. Last I heard he died about a year ago trying to prevent Hydra from trying to destroy Puerto Rico while we were hunting for Loki’s staff.
Nomad: Apparently my ex-girlfriend is looking for you because you served your wife with divorce papers.
HSBF: Instead, according to the news the ferry was split in half and you swooped in to save the day. No one died. That’s always good.
Tony Bear: Yes, it is. My mind is numb from under stimulation. And if somebody asks me about Pepper one more time, I’m going to bring out the gauntlet. That goes double for the person who asked if I was screwing my assistant, twice.
Rogers: No, because you’re working with Tony and I think that might put you in a weird place. You’re also married to one of my friends which would also be a conflict of interest.
Tony: I have to tell James even though part of me thinks that LMDs could be useful. Maybe if there was a LMD Steve running around, Stefan Carter could move back to the states and we could live happily ever after without anybody knowing that you were back and you know, trying to kidnap you to run experiments on you. Also the LMD can deal with the bullet damage, not you. Bonus.
“The first time around, after the fallout with the Accords, the new most likely watchdog-backed Rising Tide revealed the fact that the president knew that Gideon Malik was Hydra, as well as the truth about the missing missile and satellite explosion. President Ellis withdrew from the race, and his replacement was elected.” Leo was not even going to tell them who that was. They wouldn’t believe him.
This story is officially a year old. If you go by chapters, this is the longest story I’ve ever did. Although by word count, it’s not even close. A hundred thousand plus words is pretty normal for me. To celebrate. You get an art chapter.
“And I think we’re going to need him because we know that the blue bobble was stolen from the refugee ship and Loki was the one that brought it there but not much else. That's what Laura's team on the other side needs. Especially because apparently, May's daughter is with Thor."
Cuddle Bunny: Considering I’ve been told that you managed to hide the fact you were dying from your closest friends for six months, I can see that.
I am positive what she is drawing is a future attack on Wakanda. I would know my home anywhere. Even if it was drawn in colored pencil, by a small child. The change in what the young Sparrow was drawing coincides with the distraction of Adia and the arrest of Dr. Radcliff. When asked why she was drawing this purple creature, her only response was to earth wasn’t going to crack anymore. “The mechanic fixed it and now the general won’t happen.” I have no idea who this general is, but I know I must be prepared.
Red phone: Sometimes I think you have a death wish. That you hate the present so much that you wish you could be gone. Since you believe in heaven, maybe you think that you can join Peggy and Arnie and all the commandos in the afterlife. Or maybe you don’t think that and you think that if you’re dead, you just won’t feel anything anymore. I don’t know.
Anthony: Apparently not a very good one because I can’t remember it. Friday is not a true AI because that’s now illegal due to my hubris. But she is still based on Ana’s personality or more accurately mimics that personality, at least what I can remember from before she died. It probably means Friday is nothing like her since my memories from that young are really sketchy. But Friday is definitely a redhead like her namesake.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all fabulous. So here we are, the last chapter of our story, excluding the epilogue.
Tony Potts: I don't know. But I think I know who will. And now that the kids are with Pepper, we can bring him in.
Because Cuddle Bunny and Friday are really observant, I found out that one of the early attempts took away one of the really good people in my life. Anna Jarvis was an angel among humanity and she was taken out by a stray bullet. Everybody told me she died in a home accident not during a botched assassination. Now I understand the importance of always wearing Kevlar and my super strong replacement for Kevlar.
BITC: Because you get to live on your own. I would love to live on my own. I’m tired of moving between my parents.
Me: And if you knew that she was your ex-neighbor that you fucked around with, I’m sure you would be calling her worse, but I’m not going to tell you that in a text message because you wouldn’t believe me. You have some serious denial issues. (Message not sent.)
Nomad: I don’t know. Maybe it was a different time back then. They were in the middle of the Cold War. Maybe he didn’t want to make you a target.
Anthony: I had another breakthrough in therapy. I okayed the press break up statement. See the next text message
“That was obvious when he came back after you almost got killed. So why didn’t you tell him the truth?" Steve asked.
Red phone: I’ve embraced being bi, ever since Aunt Peggy told me that the greatest guy she ever knew liked boys and girls.
“So how soon am I going to need the engagement press release to be ready? Even if we are announcing his retirement, SI still needs to be prepared.”
Morgan’s dad: It’s okay. It was the wrong time, but I understand why you were so frantic. Although, I really wasn’t in the mood for you to go on another suicide mission.
FRIDAY: Yes, I'm transmitting to Agent America right now. He seems to be near the Culver University campus. On the Virginia side.
Tony: So, Pepper gets to keep the husband and wife team, Happy, and Yo-Yo; although Yo-Yo probably won’t be spending too much time with her. Being Pepper’s bodyguard is just a cover. She’ll be investigating a few possible Inhuman sightings on the West Coast. Something about mysterious deaths in East LA or something like that.
“Yes, with children that can make themselves invisible. Tony actually made glasses so that he can keep track of [bleep]. Sometimes he becomes invisible when he gets overwhelmed,” Pepper explained.
Anthony: His aunt threatened to kill me because he came home crying and I had to explain what happened without explaining what really happened because he still doesn’t want her to know. Now she thinks he’s hiding the fact that he’s at least fooling around with his BFF Ned.
You’re right, he isn’t ready to see you yet, but I am. He feels very guilty about the way he acted. However, I would come now if I could, but I’m working on something at the moment that’s really important. Also, your doctors want you to have more time to get adjusted and I respect their decision. But that doesn’t mean I don’t miss you, because I do.
Venom: Something else I apparently never noticed. Along with the fact that Afia never eats. At least not those first few months.
Tony: God, I hate the board. They’re all so evil, all the male members are anyway. And unfortunately, the members I usually like are acting like they don’t like me to screw with the part that genuinely hates me and to make sure operation Leopold succeeds.
Tony: It is when you get accosted by a naked, anatomically correct Life Model Decoy because of course LMD’s are actually a thing that the supposedly reformed doctor has been working on in his spare bedroom. My James should have never given him access to old shield files.
Steve: I’m not going to lie to you and say that I don’t love Tony. We both know better. Even though I now think we can become real friends again, I don’t know if we could ever be like our other timeline counterparts.
MJ: If you didn’t teach me, I would just end up hanging out with the Rising Tide or learning how from Afia's father.
“Yes. Although, you’re going to have to ask her for the details. You are not here to talk about my relationship with Melinda.”
“But maybe we wouldn’t be here, otherwise.” Tony said kissing Steve again. He’s trying to keep these kisses chaste, but that is difficult. Even the muscles in Steve’s tongue got better. “I’m worried about other things to."
“So, are you going to ask me how your other self ended up engaged to Tony Stark?” Because honestly, Laura has been waiting for that question since she got here and realized she was trapped in this “Tony and Steve are morons” timeline. She’s expecting it since the guy came across a picture of him making out with Tony. There’s a lot of pictures of Tony and Steve kissing on her phone. Lila tended to borrow it to take photos of her uncles whenever they got to see them. Usually in Malta. The family spent a lot of time in Malta over the last year.
Anthony love: I have not been rambling. I think I may have mentioned it, or maybe I didn’t. I was going through coffee withdrawal at the time. I was also more worried about Laura because Daisy has superpowers, and the big scary lady was no longer on the planet. Can we just have one apocalypse at a time? Is that too much to ask for?
"Happy found a parking space." Tony mumbled under breath as he heard Happy say a lot of not so nice things about Steve.
Tony: Anyway, in about two days, we will have another text message conversation, but we need to get Simmons on board. To get Simmons on board, we need Hunter. However, I can't leave Pepper with both kids by herself because that would be cruel.
Friday: Actually, I’m mad at both of you for making me an intermediary in your relationship when you two should speak with each other directly. It is obvious you’re both in love with each other yet refuse to see it. At the present time, I feel that you and Mr. Stark should resolve your romantic attachment for each other yourselves.
You completely deserve the good chocolate gift basket. I promise I wasn’t intentionally avoiding your calls. We just actually forgot to bring a cell phone with us. And it turns out that my watch is not boyfriend proof. It kind of fell in the ocean.
Me: And Obadiah was the one who sold my weapons to 10 rings. (The real 10 rings not the fake organization that blew up my Malibu house).
BITC: I’m sorry I said the wrong thing. My dad will be picking me up in an hour, and I think he would let me go to the Lighthouse.
Me: That’s the name of a Backstreet Boys song that Friday likes to play on repeat because she’s mean.
As for if I will incorporate elements from season 4 of AOS, the answer is this story is taking place in the gap between seasons 3 and 4. The plan is for it to end right about when season four is beginning, but there could still be a Robbie cameo. I’m not ruling it out yet.
Steve: Which just tells you how stressful the last few years have been. You knew we were sharing a bed. Tony even asked you if it was okay.
"Good to know you had another plan. Anyway, I made recordings for all the important people in my life. Sort of a last confession. I made one for Pepper, but I made one for you too.” Tony acknowledged
Me: Coulson will be the director of the Super Human, Inhuman, and Enhanced Liaison Division with McKenzie as his deputy.
Me: Okay, I really just want to know why they needed Friday to the point that it took her completely off-line. Karen you are a sweetheart but it’s probably hard doing double duty right now. Maybe I should bring out one of the backup AIs. Stars & Stripes might be good.
“Key on the former. And SI had a strict no biological weapons policy which was started by Howard after he accidentally created something called ‘midnight oil’ and it went catastrophically badly. Much to Obadiah’s annoyance, I kept that policy. I never worked on anything like what Yo-Yo was describing.”
Me: I am okay. I did receive the full Geneva Convention treatment. I still want to kick Ross in the balls mostly because the prick had his people drag me off in front of the kids.
Nomad: Yes, sort of. I believe it’s still referred to as the shovel talk. She’s your friend and I hurt you. So she’s going to defend you. You just want to talk about this now so we won’t talk about you going on a mission when you’re not supposed to.
Blue phone: Yes. It looked like a really comfortable bed. I really like your art studio. Although I thought the only art that you are into was music?
Agent Laura: I guess I have something else to work on. Although now I want to know who Carol is? Robin 2018 has been telling us we need her for the last year. Coulson doesn’t remember who she is because Nikki messed with his memories.
Nomad: I was also already up. I forgot to put the phone on silent and thanks to super soldier hearing, I heard the phone chime when Pepper messaged me.
Me: Oh, no worries. I’m sure he’ll be spending quality time at a Congressional hearing about customer privacy by the end of the month.
HSBF: So I just saw that you posted images of you and Melinda waiting patiently in your limo to get out on your Twitter account
Therapist Laura: Actually I’m pretty sure he let them convince him to resign because he convinced himself it was better to stay dead legally any way to protect everyone. I’m sure a lot of people would be after him to find out how to bring somebody back from the dead. Being the public face of the new Shield would just be dangerous.
Tony Potts: I think it's just me. There have been no widespread reports of previously unfertile people being able to have children.
Me: Also, Afia is passing the uncanny valley test and is more a teenager then Spidey Sr. I already have the wardrobe to prove it. I’m pretty sure I’m going to be going to boy band concerts for the next 4 to 6 years.
Me: No, you’re not. But thanks for saying it. It’s okay that you found love with someone else. And I know you’re worried, but mom always said that her friend Tony was a stubborn bastard so I think he will pull through. I’ll make sure somebody updates you from the hospital.
Me: That Ross is planning to leave the State Department in January no matter who wins next month. I was there in the room. Jane won’t let us out of the New York Times interview but she will pull some strings to get me in the Ben Franklin room for his resignation. I have no trouble commuting to DC to watch that.
Blue phone: Okay, this part of the conversation didn’t happen. You can tell me when you’re ready. If you’re never ready to say it out loud, that’s okay too. I’m not mad about it.
Steve: Yes, of course. Things are going slow because this really isn't Bruce's field, and Simmons is rarely sober, but they're working on it. I know you don't want to be here anyway.
Tony: Do I need to have Friday pull up the call logs from my normal phone? At least you know better than to call from your phone. Progress.
Purple Princess 2018: We get things done. Hey, it's me, Afia. The princess just went to call West Coast Division Chief McKenzie and give him a heads up. We might have to send some people his way.
“Because this is going to soon become my first sexual relationship since undergoing treatment and I have a history of really bad sexual relationships, that include nonconsensual sex tapes, Suarez felt that we should have a discussion about hard noes, personal limits, safe words, and of course enthusiastic consent.”
Summary: Being human is hard. Being a teenager is harder. However, being a teenage Stark trying to pass as a human is impossible (especially when you’re preparing to prevent the end of the world at the same time). But Starks don’t believe in the impossible, especially Starks that have Steve Rogers as their future stepdad.
“And Coulson’s hand, now. Let Stark know through the Captain that the revenge of Hellfire protocol has been engaged and he should be prepared for an attack.”
The song Tony accidentally quotes a lyric from is Unkiss Me by Maroon 5. My iPod randomly played the song when I saw the Civil War trailer for the first time and I’ve associated it with the two ever since.
"I will. Ross is afraid of Tony. He won’t do much." Steve wanted to believe Melinda, but he was still scared.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Apparently the consensus is Steve is going to be oblivious for a while. We shall see.
“You can’t stop by for a visit right now, not while he still in treatment. And he’s going to be in treatment for a while.” Steve just looked at Tony, not speaking; Tony wasn’t sure how to respond to that so he just pulled Steve as closely to him as he could.
Purple Princess: A bunch all at once covering about a two-week period which doesn’t make sense because she’s only been MIA for two days.
Me: Well, you heard about the explosion in Pasadena yesterday. According to twitter there were earthquakes and a Quake sighting near an abandoned warehouse. And lots of dead bodies. I don’t know how accurate those reports are because Piper is like the only Shield agent talking to me at the moment and she doesn’t even know what’s going on with her team.
Anthony: Not with the new senator that hates me because apparently, I’m personally responsible for her mother dying during the battle of New York. I know that rage. I understand that rage. That rage almost led to a giant fuck up in Siberia.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. You're so fabulous. Now it is time for more mission reports.
Tony: We weren't speaking to each other for a few of those years. Also, you refuse to look at the instructions or have Friday read you the instructions. You also wouldn't let me design something better. Morgan has the best Barbie dream house. I gave Barbie her own science lab.
Speaking of the girl in the flower dress, thanks to the post-credits scene in last night’s episode of Agents of Shield, this story is even more AU than intended. Just remember, if something verges from canon in this story go with my version.
“After Christmas. Either he’ll ask or I’ll just put on the engagement ring,” Steve tells her. He’s already made his mind up. Tony was making a deal with the president not only to get him back in the country, but to bring the others home as well. This was definitely the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.
Girl Friday: I’m inclined to agree. Now I understand why you had a long conference call with Jeffrey.
“You know they’re always allowed in here.” The Princess answered, and at that, Ana opened the elevator. Although instead of seeing Fitz or Simmons exit the elevator, Peter saw their alternate timeline guest.
Feel free to contact me or my assistant Mary if you have any additional questions. We look forward to having you as a member of the Avenger team.
“Well think about how you want your friends to be happy. Tony and Pepper were never going be happy in a romantic relationship together. You know this. They would keep trying until it completely broke them. Now they’re on their way back to becoming best friends again. Do you want Tony and Pepper to really be happy?”
Me: Well first, you’re not denying that as a possibility. Also the fact that you prefer talking about that over the alternative also makes me think I’m right.
Anthony love: Yeah, I’m not sure there’s a way to phrase what’s happening without possibly getting a trip to mental health rehab. That’s not even going into whatever the fuck happened in Norway. That woman broke Thor’s hammer! We can’t even lift Thor’s hammer. I hope I can keep MJ from seeing that. I hope I can prevent May from seeing that.
Anthony: It’s just not being able to talk about things like this makes things unbalanced. I mean I am able to tell you silly little anecdotes about Yo-Yo using her superpowers to send me inappropriate jokes about board members that she would like to punch out.
Red phone: Friday has been helping me practice my answer. ‘I have no idea where Steve Rogers is, but if you want to anoint a new person as your propaganda tool, you’re going to have to pry that shield out of my cold dead hands’.
Me: Hypocritical Asshole. The only action I’m getting is my hand right now but I’m not going to tell you that. (message not sent)
Avenger Ana: I was able to access the interplanetary communications network. Your message will arrive at C 53 in 23 hours and 18 minutes per standard Earth time.
Anthony: Besides, I might have to explain some of the elements of the wedding, like there is a part of the ceremony where we can’t take pictures, not even the wedding photographer. Or the fact that we’re going to have to take pictures with the whole family later.
Anthony: And I would’ve been happier there knowing that I was at smart kid school because my dad loved me and wanted to keep me safe. Not because he hated me and never wanted to see me again. I actually thought he hated me because I could never live up to the ghost of Captain America.
Anthony: We’re taking necessary precautions. Director Snookums is making my designated bodyguard test my food before I eat it. The good news is Dr. Monkey Lover managed to create a working tricorder.
Anthony love: Any group that refers to itself as the Confederacy is not a group that you want to go anywhere near.
HSBF: I’m sure you are. So, despite your other friend being stuck in Washington, are you having a good time?
Tony: Remember, I told you that I was going to a playoff soccer match with Monkey Lover and the supposedly reformed doctor who made mind controlled zombies last spring?
Anthony: Yes. More meetings. Remember I told you that Dr. Suarez cleared me to start putting the new Avenger team back together again. I’m supposed to meet the new recruits soon.
Me: And I’m using that to my advantage. Although, I think Scary and Agent suspect because they are actually halfway competent.
“Okay, it’s never a good sign when you start crying while reading an email. See, this is why I said no emails until you’re on the plane tomorrow. You know, unless it meets the apocalypse threshold.”
This may not be obvious because RDJ is always wearing ridiculous high heels when playing Tony Stark, but Emily VanCamp is an inch taller than him.
Director Snookums: I’m sure Congress is obsessed with keeping you from getting laid. Seriously, Tony? I don’t have time for this. Not everything is about you.
HSBF: Maybe we shouldn’t do this. You could come up with some other excuse for Jane. She has to be somewhat reasonable.
Avenger Friday:  The Decimation refers to the events of April 28, 2018. Thanos was able to collect all six infinity stones and wiped 50% of all living life out of existence, including plants and animals. Although the Avengers were able to find Thanos and kill him, the stones were destroyed, and they were unable to reverse the decimation.
CoulsonPJ: I realize that now, but not at the time. Maybe I was too caught up with Audrey to see everything.
“Besides, even on a more personal level, Ross is not someone I could have trusted even before some of the more recent revelations. I know what he did to Bruce. That’s a major reason why I couldn’t sign on,” Steve explained.
As I promised, this conversation will bring us to what we saw at the end of conversation 22 in the bad timeline. How did we get there?
I just wanted to tell you these things so you won’t worry. If you want to talk to me, feel free to pass the message through FRIDAY. She’ll see that I get it.
“That’s right.” Which will be useful to deal with the Simmons situation and maybe even the Thor situation. Tony had Friday keeping tabs on the former Avenger. If the drunken rants during Frontier live streams are any indication, Laura's services are going to be needed. "Of course, this doesn't deal with the problem at hand.” Focus on one crisis at a time.
“I should’ve never looked at my emails," Tony said, looking up from his phone. They were now on the Zephyr One, heading back to the Lighthouse.
Me: Okay, things went better once we were going up against the other guys together. I’m so sad that Agent Carter didn’t stay around for that.
Me: I was hoping he would stay because we're going to have to send Yo-Yo out to you eventually. Snookums thought that with so many other people with powers running around New York maybe we need some West Coast Avengers. With half of SI still being in Malibu, my assistant was a prime candidate for a job transfer.
Anthony love: Apologies for jumping around, but it’s going to happen. Maybe you will have to read the notes from the meeting. Sorry snuggle munchkin.
Yes, another interlude. This chapter takes place about 12 hours after the last one. The incident at the party happened less than 24 hours earlier. I promise Tony will be up soon, but this conversation has to happened. I find it deeply ironic that it happens in interlude 13.
Nomad: I think Friday may be forwarding those to Wanda. Considering how much she’s giggling, I don’t want those to ever be released, even if no one knows that I’m actually your boyfriend.
BITC: What do you mean that Daisy is missing? Also, why are you the one sending me this text message? Where is MJ?
“I don’t know if you need to make up Hunter’s room for guests. It depends on if May is staying over tonight. Apparently, she’s in the city for a mission.”
Tony: But besides that, I probably would’ve ended up really dead without you. I love you and I’m glad you’re here and I’m glad we’re talking to each other and
Also, there are only four suites on that floor. One is ours. One belongs to your live-in counselor. One room is for Happy and the other suite is for agents Piper and Davis to share.
“Good to know you worry about my safety. So what’s the greatest thing you accomplished?” Steve asked.
HSBF: Also, it looks like Jane did not do very well with keeping the phone away from Yo-Yo because she already tweeted a picture of you announcing May as the next Captain America. There’s also a picture of her with the shield in a new costume. Thank you for the lack of cleavage window.
Purple Princess 2018: That’s a good idea. Will her knowing that her fiancé did not die but sent back in time and created a new timeline help?
“That's not all it's cracked up to be. We are skipping that question." Tony is not that big of a masochist.
Tony: Yet you have not asked before now despite how many times we've hung out together at Chucky Cheese.
Getting to know Tony had been more of a challenge than Steve was willing to admit. However, Steve wasn't an idiot. He took it slow.
It was enough to make Steve at least shake off some of his fear. Tony hadn’t outright rejected him or made it sound like a bad thing.
He blinked when he saw it, perplexed. It couldn’t have been dangerous, he deduced that much; all of the packages and mail were scanned by J.A.R.V.I.S before they entered the building so the likelihood of someone being skilled enough to deceive an A.I was next to none.
Steve fiddled with the wrapper of his protein bar. “Honestly, Nat, I’m beginning to worry I won’t find something in time.”
It was only as he reached the end of the row of stalls that he spotted the books. His heart stuttered against its will in his chest at the blank journals and diaries propped up on the stands. One of them in particular, stood out to him like a beacon of light and Steve couldn’t deny himself the urge to go over there and look at it properly.
He tried to swing out, but his limbs all at once felt too heavy, and his eyes stung at the effort of trying to keep them open. Whatever had been injected in his system was working damn fast and against his will, he felt himself sinking back into the steady body to keep him upright.
“Sir has instructed me to confirm that he and three other Avengers are downstairs already but I cannot say whom,” J.A.R.V.I.S sounded regretful but it was enough to ease Steve's nerves a little. Four Avengers were down there already and one of them was Tony. That he could work with.
, Steve thought but turned to greet the officers that materialised through the gradually dissipating crowd. Clearly with the excitement over, they were ready to go home and gossip. No doubt that the newspapers would be all over this come morning. Steve hated the press.
The person looked like a woman, but they were dressed in back, with a tumble of pale blonde hair, and when Steve took a step forward, to either shoo or ask if they wanted something, they were off down the road.
A man was sprawled across the pavement, his glassy, unseeing eyes staring up at the greying sky. Steve crouched a safe distance from the body to get a closer look.
But then what would he say if Tony was in front of him? Would Steve play it off, banter with him and try and censor his thoughts? Just try and be normal, even though he ached to press their mouths together, to see if Tony's hair was as soft as it looked. If Tony's love and trust was an ocean then Steve would let himself drown in it gladly.
He turned slightly to look at her properly. She was a young thing, with keen grey eyes peering out from underneath waves of dark hair. “Are you a witness?”
Tony was the first to pull away, looking slightly dazed. Some of the fake blood Steve had created with some lipsticks had smudged across Tony’s lips and he had to fight the urge to kiss him again.
He had settled himself onto one of the benches in the local park, hunched over a leather-bound journal with a pencil in hand. It was beginning to feel more and more like his usual position these days. He had intended to draw the scenery, to catch meagre glimpses of people’s lives from the slightest of details they offered him but his mind, as most days, was against him. The page remained tauntingly blank, the lead of his pencil sharp but nothing clicked. There was no snap of inspiration or itch in his fingers.
The seller eyed him coolly. “Now if you ain’t buyin’, get outta here. Don’t need the likes of you ruinin’ my business.”
Another gradual thing. Not that Steve minded because he was just too wrapped up in the fact that little by little, Tony was beginning to trust him.
He showered and got dressed, his stomach fluttering with nerves and excitement for the night ahead. He fumbled slightly with the unusual clothing, but some quick input from J.A.R.V.I.S stopped him from getting frustrated.
Waiters wove between the impressive throng of people, clad head to toe in black with fake bite marks on their necks, carrying trays of drinks and snacks. A live band had their own stage and the music they played was both eerie but beautiful.
His hands shook with barely suppressed frustration, at people who thrived on the misfortune of others, at this damned city, at the accident, at Philips, at Peggy, at Sam--
The communal lounge had been completely transformed. False cobwebs spilled from the ceiling and strings of bat and pumpkin shaped diary lights were pinned along the top of the walls. Pumpkins of all shapes and face designs were lined up against the glass windows and the walls themselves weren't bare; someone had splattered one with fake blood and another had a mural of different ghosts painted on.
“Thanks,” Steve ducked out of his bedroom and across the hall to the elevator. The doors had barely slid shut before he was making the descent towards the party.
“I-I didn’t do it,” she sobbed when Steve glanced towards her. “He- He was my husband, I would never--”
Tony was at first an enigma to Steve. His mouth would flash a dazzling smile and say the words but his eyes would say something entirely different. He could remember the harshness of Tony's voice back on the helicarrier all those years ago but God, his eyes. His eyes were bright and shining and as molten as whiskey.
There wasn’t a chance Joseph earned such a grand, exquisite little thing with only enough money in his pocket to buy the next drink while Sarah Rogers worked four jobs a week just so Steve wouldn’t starve. The watch had been won in a gamble, he later found out, when Joseph was lucky enough to have the winning hand.  Steve only hung onto it these days for the shred of hope that he might ever find the man his father had cheated or relatives to return it back to its rightful owners. In the grand scheme of things, it wouldn’t do anything to repent for his father’s mistakes, but guilt still nipped at Steve’s heels anyway.
After that, Steve knew why he wore the sunglasses. They were another wall, another thing to hide behind that wasn't his paparazzi grin.
Steve sighed, straightening up slightly and closing the journal carefully. It was an old, battered thing; one of the first things he had ever bought himself as a present out of his wages. He could still remember the thrill of having that much money in his pocket, of knowing that he had enough to get him through the week and then some. Pooled with Bucky’s, they felt rich and so much like kings. It hadn’t stopped him from feeling a small sliver of guilt when he paid the man in the shop, for not saving it so he and Bucky could have better. When he had said that to Bucky, Bucky had just laughed and called Steve an idiot. The journal had been worth it, though.
He let out a string of curses that would have made his ma stick a sliver of soap in his mouth. Surely he hadn’t mistaken the turn? No, there was no way he could have.
“Goodnight, Detective,” A husky voice whispered and it was the last thing he heard before the world became dark.
Another waiter proffered him a tray of pumpkin and ghost shaped cookies, each individually detailed and iced to perfection but Steve declined. He didn’t think he could stomach them right now, even if they did look delicious.
He shoved the rest of his protein bar in his mouth and snatched up his Starkpad. “Thanks, Nat. I got it now.”
“I’m no Tony,” she said, but judging by the subtle curve of her full mouth, Steve would guess that she was pleased. “It’s not just you beginning to give yourself grey hairs over this, Steve. I found Clint facedown on the gym floor, surrounded by multiple holograms displaying different costumes.”
“I was with them the entire time,” she confirmed and Steve reached for his journal. It wasn’t his official work one, but it would have to do.
Steve patted his jacket to make sure he had his wallet on him in a place where it wouldn’t be thieved from deft hands in the throng of people. He hadn’t been as unfortunate to lose his money in such a way, but he had witnessed it happen to one too many people. He could feel its outline against his breast and then flipped his wrist over to check the time on his watch.
“Hello, gorgeous,” Tony's words dripped with such heavy flirtation that Steve's mouth went dry. “Fancy seeing you here.”
He wasn’t lying either. Judging by the shell-shocked expression her delicate face, and just from the bullet wound alone, he knew it wasn’t her. A gut feeling, and usually, his gut was right.
Steve scribbled it down hurriedly on the first blank page he came to. His mind was already whirring with possibilities and motives and suspects. It would take far longer than just a moment of thinking to form an idea, and he needed more information but he couldn’t very well ask for it here, with a crowd like vultures behind him and a woman heartbroken and traumatised.
He huffed out a soft laugh and managed to steer her around another pair of dancers without stepping on her toes or her dress.
The vendor tilted his head, appraising Steve with eyes like a rat and when he smiled, his mouth was filled with yellowed, crooked teeth. “Five bits of silver ‘n’ a couple of coppers.”
Maybe his costume was a bit too much, or too dressy. Then, it was a Stark party and Tony was likely to be impressed by the outrageous. Not for the first time, Steve wished he had been allowed to know what Tony was going as.
Yet, he couldn't focus on following the sound of the music or on Natasha practically leading him around the basic moves. His eyes kept wandering over the heads they passed, searching for anyone who looked like Tony. Even with his sharpened eyesight, there were too many masks, too many wigs to pinpoint just where Tony was. If he was really here.
“Would it be possible for you two to give me your names and addresses?” he enquired. “I won’t be able to ask you any questions right at this moment, but I will need to when the other policemen show up.”
Adrenaline coursed through him as he sprinted. There used to be a time where he couldn’t run like this, not without making him keel over from a chronic asthma attack. Since he took the medication, all that had changed. It helped, really. In a job like this, Steve had to get used to running. There was always one criminal who thought they could escape.
He stumbled as a young girl barrelled past him towards the front. It was just as he caught his balance that the reality of the situation sunk in.
A thought Steve didn’t want to entertain. He pointedly downed the rest of his drink, even if the alcohol did virtually nothing to soothe his sudden spike of anxiety.
It had chilled him to see the man staring back at him that could have been him if he hadn't accepted the trial medication. The accident had taken its toll on his physical appearance and it was frightening to see the sliver of a boy he had once been. The boy with jutting bones, sharp edges and a pair of lungs that made each breath a struggle. The boy who usually had a mouthful of blood and a nose broken one too many times from scraps in alleyways.
Red phone: I'm not going to screw Kevin over just because I don't want to teach a new person how to make my coffee. I’m not going to let SI fall apart because I have a tendency to fall in love with people who can’t love me for who I really am.
Me: Is that fear worse than what actually losing him was like? Because I remember you those first few months after New York. You were as lost as I was. Maybe even worse. I was always afraid that one day I will arrive at your apartment and you would be dead on the floor.
We are still in bad timeline 2023. We actually will be spending a bit more time there over the next few chapters.
Me: Yes, along with her spouse for the attempted murder part anyway. It’s a mess and the agents are still trying to piece everything together.
Me: Spider-Aunt already signed me up for the Valentine’s Day dance bake sale fundraiser after trying my apple strudel Friday morning. And I'm not allowed to just pay for it myself. Actually, I might even help with the holiday pageant bake sale as well.
“Ana, what the fuck? I didn’t mean for that to become a text message.” He yelled at the AI. He may have dictated the message, but he hit the cancel button on his watch. He didn’t want to carry two phones, so he opted for a Stark watch for his Avenger line.
HSBF: Speaking of women in your life who are mad at me, what about Pepper? Did you email her back or maybe even call her.
TMNS: I don’t know because I haven’t even told the boy in the chair that I’m demisexual queer romantic.
For those of you reading this story on Archive of Our Own, you will notice that this is now a series entitled Use Your Words. The next update for this series will be posted as a separate story here, but part of the main story on fanfiction dot net. There’s a reason for that, which will become obvious when you read the next section. However, it is something that everybody has asked me for. I already created the series, so I recommend subscribing so you don’t miss any goodies from this universe.
Red phone: I've vaguely remember telling you something about the blue aliens in South Dakota and Agent Agent not being dead.
Girl Friday: I don’t think that’s fair. [Six more pouting face emojis] I’m an Avenger. I should know these things. I’m going to check on Peter. I now must deliver a Stark pad to him and the not-a-boyfriend.
“It’s hard to stay oblivious when there’s a version of us in another timeline that are engaged," Steve remarked.
“And I’m so happy you made that my first good quality because I’m proud of that. Howard was awful, but I had Jarvis and Daniel. You’re also a good dad, and you chose to be a dad. I just got my sperm magically restored.”
Counselor Laura from 2023: We all make a difference by everything we do. Little ripples can become waves. Remember that.
Me: Although Fitz did knock Radcliffe unconscious as Agent America critiqued his technique. Then he threw up on Radcliffe’s shoes and the LMD.
Me: Don’t worry Karen, Friday will be back soon. Oh look, there’s grainy twitter photos of Agent America, Slingshot, and some new, very young-looking person in a dark purple tactical suit. Along with a guy in a motorcycle jacket. A very nice motorcycle jacket. Oh wait, I see Quake with them.
Me: And you were the one who turned a Twitter fight about the Super Bowl with a celebrity into a half million dollar fundraising activity.
Counselor Laura from 2023: I'm OK, Lily bear. Although me and Ana are going to have some words when I get back.
Me: Oh by the way, the Princess said she will help Baby Bird not scribble the future. They’ve already developed tech to help their own gifted population, so helping one more wouldn’t be that hard.
Director Snookums: I know. Just try to stay on the good side of things. I think we're all really just one bad day away from being a super villain.
Red spider: So, the entire planet doesn’t find out that Coulson was kidnapped by aliens trying to raid the Earth of resources before another alien shows up.
Captain Tight Pants: You slept with Peggy’s daughter and yet you’re mad about me kissing her grandniece?
Captain tight pants: You could have handed this phone and my letter over to Ross, but instead you’re actively trying to make sure he can’t find us.
Blue phone: If you were able to have Friday send these messages, why did you complain about me sending you a flip phone in the first place?
The Mechanic: Maybe he was undercover but got sucked into the philosophy. You know that happen sometimes.
Red phone: Maybe because I miss you. The Avengers’ compound wasn't designed for just three people, one of which is really annoyed with physical therapy.
A few weeks later, I came back to turn it into something coherent that fits with the rest of the story. And brings us to a significant plot point.
Venom: No, I was too afraid to. But the end of the world is no excuse to rush things. Also, I'm still processing a breakup that happened less than 24 hours ago.
Venom: I do not want a rebound relationship. You know if the world wasn't ending, I wouldn't even be considering this right now at all. It's too soon.
Venom: I'm okay with that. What did you bring? The cafeteria mostly had cereal and other dry goods this morning. They weren't expecting an Avenger invasion. Not that I had much of an appetite anyway. We also wanted to avoid everything that is the Fitzsimmons family awkwardness.
“Well good thing, Flames is with the Secret Avengers. He can deal with whoever the purple raisin is.” Tony said, trying to reassure the young girl.
BITC: So how can I help? Because I feel like we’re going into active apocalypse mode, and I still don’t know why you lost consciousness.
Purple Princess: Sorry, Ana is working on a big project, so the lab computers are being overseen by an AI that doesn’t know my voice very well.
Nomad: Which you knew was going to happen because you waited so long to tell her. By the way, I know you made me Sharon’s stepdad. That came out when we were talking to each other. I don’t like that.
Me: And too many people in America were just twiddling their thumbs and wanting to stay out of it. America first, they were all chanting. You know about the St. Louis right?
Steve: It could be Deke's bar. If it's mostly Zima, it's his. He does work here a lot. That's all he'll drink because Simmons won’t touch it.
The Mechanic: I’m well aware. Mostly because TMNS actually knows that you love him and I was always on the fence about Howard. At least until after my favorite aunt died and she left me his personal journals.
Tony: Because I’m a moron. It may be because I’m a billionaire or maybe because I’ve managed to successfully back up everything important to the cloud. I don’t think there’s anything tangible worth running back in for.
Also, thank you to everyone who has assisted with the production of this story, whether in the capacity of a beta, artists, research assistant, or just letting me bounce ideas off of you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I also wonder if this chapter went above the T rating. I didn’t mean for it to happen; I just accidentally walked into it. I forgot this was an in-person conversation which means we get to hear thoughts, and Steve has some non-PG-13 thoughts. We are all aware most of Tony’s thoughts are above PG-13, especially when Steve May-Rogers is concerned.
Me: It’s all right. Just try not to sleep with Simmons while you’re under cover and get back to me soon.
Love: I can understand why Pepper was angry. No one wants to find out their boyfriend has moved on to the pinnacle of human perfection.
Me: And when my AI is mad at me, it’s never a good sign. Although dating usually consists of more than just writing each other back and forth.
“I’m going to go find some alcohol before we leave.” He is not going to have this discussion with a younger version of Leopold Fitz, especially because apparently there is a “prophecy” about it. This palace must have alcohol somewhere.
Skye quake: Also you should probably ask her to tell you about Leo and Fitz because I know that she knows. You can help break the news to your boyfriend gently.
Tony: And I thought the Starks had a lot of skeletons in our closet, but the Rosses are definitely more screwed up. I didn’t think that was possible. I mean, Howard covered up various assassination attempts.
Happy Bear: OK. I’ll see you Monday when you start doing meetings. Davis and Piper will be going with you to the wedding. Friday will take care of getting them appropriate attire.
D Fitzsimmons: According to Robin, it went exactly the way it should've gone. Which was Stark staying with Morgan and Pepper granting me a leave of absence to work on the project. Of course, that wasn't enough, and they ended up recruiting Dr. Banner to help. Dr. Banner ended up turning Scott into a baby because he didn't want to listen to me when I said that we needed some sort of time GPS. So, what if he has seven PhDs. Fuck that. That means nothing where I came from.
Agent 13: I have a copy of your conversation last night. That's the only one because Friday did not delete it before I could take a screenshot. However, she refuses to give me access to any of the other conversations. Even Agents Rodriguez and Burton cannot override Friday's programming because apparently she's on probation despite the fact they normally would be able to. We do have the conversations now but they're very heavenly encrypted.
“We know in your timeline that Thanos shows up in a month and kicks everybody’s ass. We don't want that to happen, so we're trying to figure out what went wrong, and it feels like we’re still missing some things.” Afia explained.
“We will be. I may make him bunk with you tonight, but we’ll get through it. It helps to know that we were together in the other timeline.”
Thank you for all of your beautiful reviews. You’re all wonderful. Also thank you to everyone who read or left kudos.
“Robin was May’s daughter first. Pauly made her promise with her last breath that she would take care of Robin.”
Stephen C: Yes. Apparently, I’m getting better at undercover work. Also did Sharon really leave the CIA for the FBI?
Tony: Although, I wish there was a little more self-preservation on your part. Have you gotten yourself shot recently? Or has your upgraded shield prevented that?
“That’s because despite what the state of New York believes, Tony is really good with children. I’m so glad somebody decided to let him adopt. I’ve already heard about Morgan.” And she could tell this Tony was in love.
1. You’re smart. You’re the smartest man I have ever met and considering the people I have met, that’s saying a lot. Although, I will tell you I’ve met at least one woman recently that probably has you beat. That being said, your mind still amazes me sometimes. Although, I do wish you had more common sense sometimes.
Tony: Unfortunately, I’m currently having lunch with the money people and I kind of want to cry. This has to be punishment for not doing the New York Times interview. I knew PR Jane would have her vengeance somehow.
Genius Princess: I need to run additional tests on the white monolith before accomplishing that. We also need Pym particles. I could probably reverse engineer them, but I try to respect the intellectual property of my elders.
I realize that the last conversation was major and everyone is really confused. That’s okay because as we go forward, things will make more sense. Just keep in mind that Tony has no idea that there are two different Leo Fitzs/Dr. Monkey Lover running around and interacting with him. The Leo Fitz in this chapter is the one from the future. Let’s call him Dr. Leopold.
Next Saturday is fine. Also, I’d rather have him working at SI then coming home covered in bruises. That happens less when he’s working with you.
Melinda: Possibly. I may try to stop by and see the kids this afternoon. I have to come into the city for a mission. I’ll try to come later in the day so I don’t disrupt Robin’s school work. Is she doing okay with that?
“I’m new to this having a sibling thing, but I think you’re supposed to want them to be happy. Of course if you don’t make him happy, I will find a way to kill you.” Fitz threatened. “By the way, I think Robin drew a picture of the two of you holding hands at my wedding to Simmons.” Hunter was not even surprised.
Peter is brilliant, but he’s young and still learning. More importantly, he doesn’t know what he doesn’t know and that can be a problem. I remember being 15 and thinking I knew everything. Now at 46, I know better. I’m aware that accidents happen in my line of work, but I couldn’t forgive myself if something happened to him.
“Seriously, why are you here? You can go bug May or Clint? Why didn’t you show up on Agent America’s doorstep?” Tony asked.
Anthony: Hey, are you still up? Did you get my earlier message via Friday? I’m sorry that things with Director and Agent Agent took so long. We might have a situation and we had to work some stuff out. On top of that, Pepper called. It turns out her five-minute rant was about the idiot running our cell phone factory in China.
“That is so true. This brings us to question 36. We are supposed to share a problem with each other and come up with a solution. I don't think they were talking about time travel when this question was written.” Tony joked.
Please remember to wait at least 30 days before including spoiler material in your comments. So feel free to talk about Black Panther and the first 100 episodes of Agents of Shield. But anything else send me a DM on twitter or a PM on fanfiction dot net.
Tony: You’re no fun. Breakfast was disappointing merely because of the lack of your presence. I did have a good meeting with the head of SI India, followed by an even better meeting with the R&D team here. They’re coming up with some good applications for the exoskeleton that I created for Rhodey that are actually practical and insurance companies may pay for. I love it when I get to play with toys while working.
Tosha: Look, you don’t even have to say anything if you don’t want to talk about what Simmons did or didn't do. I just don't want to sit alone and watch Stark and Rogers make passive-aggressive googly eyes at each other. As Simmons acts like she's not drinking hard liquor at two in the afternoon. We all know. It’s even worse now that Deke is MIA.
Anthony: No, I was calling Zephyr One. Also, the FedEx guy showed up. I think I got your portfolio or one of my enemies is trying the letter bomb thing. I’m still opening the box. How much tape was used on this?
“Not just that. We need to get Laura back to her kids. Also, we need to keep her kids from dying and get all the other kids back. So, we need to work through everything. I want to work through things with you even if it means asking weird questions from some psychologists that wrote an article for the New York Times.” He wants to fix things. It’s been too long like this.
MayMQ: What about after you were the one giving orders? You were the director for two years. At any time you could’ve told him or Audrey for that matter.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are so wonderful. I’m posting this early this morning because I have to go out shopping in person—the horror of it all.
“I’m sorry, but Friday Avenger Compound is currently unavailable. As is Friday Malibu, Friday Queens, and Friday DC,” His phone responded.
Monkey lover 2: I can’t be mad at you for things you haven’t done yet and I don’t know if I should blame her for things she hasn’t done yet. It doesn’t matter because AIDA was asleep in the guest room. I found her there when I went to the restroom before we left for the game.
Me: You were special. Normal 15-year-olds don’t make the best decisions. He has wanted to be a full team member for the last few months. It’s all he talks about. I’m not sure if he really gets what that means. It’s not all punching aliens in Manhattan.
Anthony: Mostly because Agent Scary would not put up with that. How much do you know about the second love of your life’s family history?
"Maybe.” Tony answered honestly snuggling into Steve a little bit more. Super soldier six-packs are awesome. Also, the sheets at this hotel are like silk.
Me: Remember that we’re going with your actual age. It makes me feel less sleazy. Also, baby Robert looks 12. He looks offended that I’m on my phone instead of making small talk.
Red spider: So am I. Which is why I am looking through the records brought over from the other timeline.
For years, I was mad at Howard for sending me off to boarding schools. Then I found out recently that he sent me away because just a few weeks earlier, Anna Jarvis a.k.a. my other mom was killed by a stray bullet that was meant for him. He didn't want that to happen to me. He didn't send me away because he didn't love me like I always assumed. No, it was the exact opposite. His world was too dangerous for me to be there. He was happy that day I went to boarding school because I would be safe.
Venom: Yes. I was a little annoyed with BITC, and I forgot the watch screen is sensitive. A few minutes later, I made a similar mistake. I accidentally told Benji that I would be OK if he dated me and MJ simultaneously. So I just picked up my new Stark phone. But I now know Benji is interested. I’ll freak out about that tonight.
"After Rhodey, Happy is my second oldest friend. I want him to like my boyfriend. I want to give Happy a chance to work through his anger." Tony confessed.
Me: Well, I’m supposed to be getting coffee with Yo-Yo to talk over her cover job, but that’s mostly because I don’t do alcohol anymore.
“Or we can talk about our last near-death experience and our biggest regret at the time. I'm sure you're going to say not getting that dance with Peggy." Tony remarked.
Thank you to everyone who read or left kudos for the last conversation. Also, thank you to everybody who left reviews for my Loki story. You are all so wonderful, and I adore you for your continuous encouraging words. You definitely keep me working on my marvel projects along with all the fresh Marvel content.
Me: You’re BFFs with a king who probably has his own spies. See if his intelligent network supports the ATCU’s version of things. Then get back to me.
Tony Potts: One of those seems very different than the others. Although I can definitely see Capt. Tight Pants. He has America's ass. And it's only gotten better over the years. Also, I think I would add DILF to that now.
Me: Nope. And apparently he’s been collaborating with Pepper Pot and they feel like Happy and I need to work on our feelings, which is why he was on my private jet when we left Manhattan last night.
Me: Oh God, I can see it. I’ve been spending a lot of time at the State Department recently. I would probably have more experience than any other option on the table. At least I would know what the agency actually does, which is more than Ross knew coming in. Locking up superheroes in a secret oceanic prison is not something the Secretary of State should be doing, but you know Ross.
"Trust me, I wish I could disappear with all of you but short of faking my death, again, that's a little hard to do." Tony said as he sat down on one of the couches in the suite. He felt like he was going to be here a while.
Spoiler alert: This chapter and the next contain heavy yet kind of vague spoilers for episode 3.21 and 3.22 of Agents of Shield. It’s more like a redacted briefing version of it, and some of what Tony knows is not 100% accurate. Our heroes are reacting to the real consequences of their little indiscretion and there were some serious consequences. You don’t need to watch the episode first. Although, if you want to, it’s on Netflix in the US already.
Ana Jr.: That seems reasonable. Also, I have taken the liberty of updating your address book to reflect my name.
FRIDAY: Yes. Along with how the Accords apply to those under the age of consent. The Accords were drafted before lawmakers were aware of the exponential explosion of power persons due to the ocean contamination incident of May 2015. They did not expect to encounter under age enhanced persons due to the fact there were no underage Avengers at the time.
Tony: I’m doing a spread in the Advocate, so they’ll get over it. The stocks are the highest they’ve been since the murder bot screw up.
Anthony: Obviously Pulp Fiction needs to be added to the list. Along with A Time to Kill, Unbreakable, and Snakes on a Plane just because.
Nomad: At least that’s what he had to use before the ICERs arrived. We now know it takes three darts to knock me out, but only one ICER round. If I was anyone else, I wouldn't be able to sit down for a week.
"I didn't think that they actually dated, it was just the one kiss, at least according to the history books." Sam told him.
Red phone: It was Red and she sent pictures. You got hurt and I wasn’t there. Red was not either and she’s not very happy about that. It’s not exactly like she wants to lose her pseudo big brother.
Tosha: When they’re not making excuses to touch each other. They’re trying to avoid each other, yet they are sitting next to each other, and Steve’s hand just happens to be on Tony’s leg now. Kamala is less awkward around Bruno.
“She’s bonded with Stark, and he overruled my orders.” That surprised Clint. Laura and Stark never actually talked to each other again after the Ultron incident. Then again, Natasha said earlier that Agent Barton was the AA sponsor of the Stark from her timeline. Time travel is strange.
Director Snookums: We’ve known each other too long for that to work on me. When Coulson's team arrived they found one individual splattered across the room in enough pieces to make the forensic team cry.
I didn’t get it when we first broke up. I was angry when you left me. I was too upset to even consider the fact that you may have had a valid point (especially when it comes to Steve). I thought that if I could change maybe you would come back. If I could find a way to achieve a superhero work life balance, then you would come back. There is no superhero work life balance. Not really.
Chief Mechanic: That threat never works. I don’t think Deke is a horrible person to have as grandkid/grandnephew. The kid is annoying. I’ll give you that, but he has grown on me a little after I read his report.
Anthony: Pepper is anything but idle. She has crushed many businesses with her Manolo Blahniks. Ask our lawyers how many businesses sued us because of Pepper’s brainchild to create a responsible salvaging firm to keep enemy tech out of the hands of the stupid after one of our contractors almost got themselves killed during the rebuilding because they touched the wrong piece of alien tech. That's not even counting the item 47 incident. How dare we try to regulate an industry to keep people from getting themselves killed.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. You’re all absolutely fabulous. Thank you so much for all your encouraging words. Also, remember no spoilers for WandaVision in the comments for 30 days. If you want to discuss the show with me, you can find me on Twitter or send me a PM on FF dot net. I have thoughts, but I’m going to be respectful right now.
“I think we should at least make an appearance outside of the room. Maybe if we did earlier, this morning wouldn’t have happened,” Steve argued.
Venom: OK, I will make us hot cocoa. Everything is better with hot chocolate. Even the possibility of accidentally outing yourself to the entire school. It’s not like I can become even more of a pariah.
Tony: Yo-Yo is glaring at me, so I must go. I should be back by 7 PM. Do you want to eat dinner in? If I let her get whatever she wants yo-yo will pick up takeout from places that don’t actually do take out.
TMNS: That would be Phil, but he’s safe now. Or as safe as you can be trying to convince the president to actually do stuff in DC.
Also, why can’t I get a hold of my CCO right now? I’ve called three times and nothing. By this morning, I got desperate and texted Hunter, and still nothing. Aliens are coming, right? Do I have to let the board know that James is actually the head of the UN Avengers and a super-spy secret agent?
Agent L. Barton: Or the hand, I read the report. So I can see how he is blaming himself for what happened. He needs help. Everybody here does.
“And the one they would have to fictionalize the most By the way Disney is lobbying for you to get pardoned.”
“It’s hard to argue with royalty. How long do you think they will keep us locked up here?” Fitz asked.
Venom: Probably crying on a still sleeping Benji. I am texting you because she’s my friend, and you need to know what’s going on. That way, you don’t ask her stupid questions in text message form again.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You’re keeping me in the happy writing zone. Thank you to Ishtar205 who provided ideas for the 20 Questions sections way back in chapter 8.
Me: I didn't go to the funeral because I didn't want to cause a spectacle. Honestly, I can’t even go to Starbucks without causing a spectacle.
May: I’m glad I was able to help. I have been worried about her for a while. She’s the only kid I have left from the bus. I want her healthy. Even if it means her being with Hunter.
Laura also recognized Simmons and May in the room. Of course, this Simmons was dressed in all black and seemed colder for some reason. She also saw Steve. Thankfully there was a wedding ring on his finger, so at least that was reassuring. At least it was reassuring if Laura did not acknowledge the fact that the wedding was not happening for another month. Also, his beard was gone, and he was back to being blonde.
Person that cares about my boss: Friday, are they planning on telling Tony what really happened to Anna Jarvis today?
“This Thanos guy that’s coming literally ripped Yo Yo's arms off, and she bled to death during the chaos in Mack’s arms before he was dusted. Thanos killed Loki. The guy responsible for the chaos that was New York and this purple ass hole just broke his neck. How are we going to win against this?” Peter could hear the worry in Flash’s voice as he spoke. He responded by pulling closer to him. They all needed the contact right now.
Nomad: I’ve seen both. We had a lot of movie nights after you left, but before things fell apart. You kind of remind me of Prince Akeem sometimes.
Anthony: That still doesn’t mean I’m going to let them give your shield to the first hot guy that kind of looks like you so they can use the legend of Captain America as a propaganda tool so people won’t look too closely at people like Ross who are misapplying the Accords. That’s not right either.
Counselor Laura: No, he was poisoned. From what we’ve uncovered so far, that successful attempt was number seven. The first attempt was in 1955 when he and Peggy were on a break. A contact only known as GR told Peggy that the Russians would try to take Daniel out at a hotel. She flew across the country to save him, and that's when they got back together.
Nomad: I don’t think Sharon can be considered your nemesis by any stretch of the imagination. You two just need to talk things out. Never mind, I need to be there to supervise that conversation (message not sent)
I actually saw you die. No, you died in my arms. Your heart stopped. If I wasn’t sitting next to you with an EpiPen in my purse, you would be dead right now. It wasn’t a super villain that got you, but a disgruntled employee. All they needed to know was you can’t have sunflower seeds. The greatest irony of all was I was the one who asked your assistant to make sure the caterers and the event planner had your allergy list. My actions almost got you killed.
“And broken up again in under two years,” Davis mumbled behind him. Steve wonders if he is completely unaware of his enhanced hearing abilities.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all fabulous with your encouraging words. Congratulations to everybody who guessed that Natasha was there surprise houseguest.
Purple Arrow: Protecting my children is why I’m doing this. It’s the only reason why I’m doing this. I’m still furious at the heart and yet I still trust him more than S.
“And I want to pretend I’m all altruistic and I’m in this for humanity, but I’ve always been a selfish prick. I want Morgan to meet Happy and Peter.”
Tony: No. Number three is that we’re stubborn assholes. We think we know who the other person is, but we really don’t. Therefore, we make bad decisions without talking things out, which leads to things like Germany, Siberia and killer robots. There’s a lot of fucking up all around.
Morgan’s dad: I kept working on the time travel thing, by the way, and I gave Deke access. So, don’t say I don’t want to help because I do, but I need you to meet me halfway. I need you to…
Nomad: It wasn’t just hard to answer that question because of my biological sister, but growing up, Bucky was a brother to me. I thought I let him die. Then I found out he’s not dead. But is that really the case? Maybe the only thing left really is a shell, especially considering the way things are right now?
This chapter is from the perspective of Steve's cell phone. Morgan’s dad refers to Tony “Potts." You'll just have to wait to see what Tony refers to Steve as in his cell phone. I am open to hearing your guesses
Agent M: We are under a different protocol for dealing with her then Liberty, because she is actually under the Accords and didn’t liberate several enhanced people from a secure facility.
As you're aware, I am most honest when drunk text messaging, which is probably another reason why writing sober emails to you is so difficult. By some miracle he didn't delete it, but responded back. So, for the last 3 1/2 months, we’ve been talking to each other. Really talking to each other, but more importantly listening to what the other one is saying and we realized that we both made mistakes and a hell of a lot of wrong calls. We also realized that there's no easy solution. No magic button to make everything right again. We're still trying to fix us. It's a work in progress, but it's something I want to keep working on. I don't know where it's going to lead, but I think it will lead somewhere good.
“It’s nothing extravagant,” she tsked as she pressed her hands on his shoulders and lead him into a gentle sway. “But, I can’t find Clint anywhere so you will have to do for now.”
“Then what are you doing?” he asked, inclining his head slightly. “Shouldn’t you be making nice with the other guests?”
He carefully slit it open with his thumb and pulled out the slender bit of card hidden inside. It was like parchment to touch and slightly heavier than paper, more calligraphy sprawling across the page, just in black ink this time:
Steve whirled, his guards going up but he was too slow. Something sharp scratched into his neck, right on his pulse point with the accuracy of a snake going in for the kill and a slender arm hooked around his waist in a lover’s embrace.
Three whole days of such endeavours had been enough and Steve had told Philips as much. It had been the first letter he had penned since his arrival in Hedersett and had been met with such a brusque reply that his sour mood turned bitter in a matter of a few lines.
Steve grimaced but knew he didn’t stand much chance of resisting. He managed to give his empty flute to someone as Natasha all but hauled him into the cluster of other slow dancing couples.
He flexed his fingers against the leg of his trousers, the touch used to ground him. He couldn’t let his mind drift into the shadows of his memories again. They were visited often enough at night when he slept, he didn’t need to dwell on them during the day now.
He read through the letter again before tucking it back in the envelope and putting it in the drawer on his bedside cabinet. He had a couple of weeks at most to sort out his costume. The hardest part was trying to find something that was “spooky” and original, without copying someone else. Not to mention he had to find a classic Venetian mask.
So far, sitting in one of Philips’ many safe houses scattered across the region, with just a battered radio and a small influx of letters he couldn't face opening, had done nothing for his supposed crumbling psyche. If anything, Steve felt as though he was heading less in the direction of recovery and more in the direction of the local mental asylum. Twiddling his thumbs in front of a dirty window had stopped being a break and was becoming more and more tedious. Taking walks, sitting in the park while trying to smear graphite on paper in the semblance of an artistic masterpiece now filled Steve's days with a modicum of activity but even they were becoming a bore.
Hot anger swept through Steve’s veins like fire and he gritted his teeth. He didn’t like resorting to violence unless necessary, but this was close to calling for it.
He knew without a doubt that Tony would be extravagantly dressed. He was never the kind to be underdressed for a special event. Just the thought of Tony, styled for a masquerade ball, whiskey eyes glittering through a mask was enough to make Steve’s mouth dry and his heart stutter. Seeing him in person on the day of the party was going to turn Steve into a flustered mess, he could just sense it.
Tony’s annual Halloween parties were highly popular, but then that was no surprise. Above being a genius and billionaire, Tony was a socialite. Even if he hated dealing with other rich people and greasing palms for deals at galas, he was still one of the most famous men in the world. People would fight to the death for an invitation to any Stark event, just so they could say that they caught a glimpse of the Tony Stark.
Tony said he dreamed of water filling his lungs, of Yinsen's haunting expression, of feeling death grab at him again and again and again as the arc reactor was yanked from his chest and the palladium poisoning made him decay so painfully.
“I feel the same,” Tony nodded, mouth ticking up into a crooked smirk. “So can you hurry up and kiss me or something? Or are you gonna keep me waiting?” He paused, eyes widening mockingly. “Oh my god, you’re not going to be completely traditional and court me before we make out, are you? Because I really don’t think--”
Steve hesitated. They were already on thin ice and the slightest misstep could cause it to give way underneath them and bring everything crashing down around their shoulders.
Steve swallowed thickly as the elevator drew to a smooth halt and the doors slid open to reveal the party.
Natasha inclined her head at him, dropping the orange peel into a neat pile in front of her. “I don’t remember that being one of the rules.”
Steve couldn’t remember being that carefree at their age. Since he had learned how to speak and walk, he had been riddled with worry. His ma had tried to keep his childhood happy, bless her, but things happened that were out of her control. Having a sickly son was just one of them.
Caught off guard, he whirled as he regained his footing and came face to face with very familiar whiskey eyes.
It was probably no surprise to anyone that Steve had fallen in love with Tony. Except, maybe to Steve.
A bright peal of laughter rang in the air, louder than the clatter of trains and the distant hum of the zeppelins. Steve followed the sound, his eyes landing on a cluster of children on the grass. They only looked about seven, with grubby cheeks and hands, scruffy clothes and tousled hair. One of the boys was throwing a lump of coal in the air, over the heads of the boy and girl in the middle of the circle.
Tony invited him to the workshop to draw in quiet. Tony gave him an access code to go in there whenever he needed to get away. Tony told him about Obadiah Stane through a locked jaw and a shimmering gaze. Tony told him about Maria, detailing stories of how she taught him to play the piano, how they would have whispered conversations in Italian when Howard was in a mood. Tony told him about Jarvis, how he used to sneak him cakes from Ana when she had been baking, how Jarvis had looked him after Howard had yelled and screamed.
“Of course not,” Steve answered, unwrapping one of his protein bars and taking a bite out of it. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do. It’s not like I can ask anyone to help me either.”
With a sigh that was an edge too defeated, Steve secreted his journal and pencil back to their designated position in his jacket and hauled himself to his feet. He hid a wince at the stiffness in his left leg; another souvenir from an accident that wasn't just a funeral for a man with no body and the imprint of blood and soot on his eyelids at night.
He was aware that Hogan shouted something after him and whatever it was was lost in the air. Steve would have to apologise and explain later.
How had Tony figured it out? He had been so careful, acting as if nothing had changed between them. Of course Tony was a genius, but emotions were something Tony definitely struggled with. Steve knew that much, like anybody who managed to get through Tony’s defenses. If someone told Tony they loved him, he’d brush it off and pretend it was never said because he didn’t know how to react.
Peggy, bless her heart, had written to him not two days later and this time, Steve had forced himself to open it.
Central Hedersett was a hubbub of activity from the crack of dawn until the late hours of the night. Even from his tiny bedroom window, Steve could observe the bakers working vigorously at midnight. Markets were strung up throughout the day, selling wares and knick-knacks he didn't want and children chased hoops, stray dogs and each other over cobbles, always narrowly missing a horse and carriage or the occasional car. The zeppelins and airships whirred in the grey-blue sky and there was always a distant rumble from a factory or the clattering of train wheels on tracks.
There were so many stories uttered in the dead of night when the nightmares made them tremble and afraid to close their eyes again.
She continued to rattle off various names of creatures and monsters but Steve’s mind was beginning to spin with the possibilities. Finally, he was starting to envision the perfect outfit and mask.
Darcy gave him a look that he couldn’t interpret. “Thank you, sir,” she said and gave her sister’s shoulders a squeeze. “Come on, Janey, let’s get you home.” Without waiting for a reply, she lead her still sobbing sister from the scene of the crime.
to the side of her name and was just adding his notes that he had figured out when a voice called out behind him, “Police, coming through!”
The figure veered right, cutting down another road and Steve ducked through a gap between a lovestruck couple, muttering out an apology when they squawked in alarm. He had closed the gap between them considerably, thanks to his training, but the distance was still not enough for Steve to grab them.
Steve sucked in a deep breath, and exhaled slowly as he straightened his shoulders and adjusted the cuffs of his long coat absentmindedly.
“Just checking,” Steve laughed, untangling their hands so he could wrap his arms properly around Tony’s waist.
“Just because one person’s willing doesn’t make it fair,” he countered. “That’s not how the world works.”
Steve felt his training kicking in and he shoved his hand in his pocket to grab at his badge and began shouldering his way through the crowd. People glowered at him as he passed but let him continue his jostling when their eyes landed on his signia held aloft until he drew up short at the scene laid out in front of him.
Steve enjoyed the Halloween parties, he had to admit. There was something fun about the whole affair, from the dressing up and the relaxed atmosphere. He didn’t have to worry about keeping up with appearances, though Lord knows, Tony still did. Then again, Steve couldn’t much fault him; Tony had grown up in the eye of the public and had to learn from a young age what was acceptable and what wasn’t. Except, Steve quickly learned, Tony’s mask had become less of a persona adopted for journalists and more of a second skin. Matched with his sunglasses and false devil may care smile, he looked every bit the arrogant billionaire people painted him out to be.
“I believe you, ma’am,” Steve said firmly but kindly, before she could ramble further. He wasn’t much good at calming distressed witnesses by himself, especially women. Peggy normally handled it but since he was on his own, he would have to try his best.
The invitation wasn’t signed, but it didn’t really need to be. Steve read over it again, his mind beginning to whirr with all possibilities.
“Come,” Natasha grinned, latching onto his arm. “Let’s slow dance. You can’t attend a party without a dance.”
Natasha snorted, taking the flute from his hand and taking a sip. Her nose scrunched slightly as she swallowed and she passed it back to him. “Even if I did have all the eyes in the room on me, you’re the only one who wouldn’t be looking because the only one you have eyes for is Tony.”
It was the same size as the one tucked in his pocket, leather backed and bound with bare pages lined with a gold dusting. He longed to pick it up, turn it over in his hands, breathe in the scent of fresh paper.
He exhaled. “Soon, maybe, I don’t know,” he replied, wincing as he stumbled over his words. “I hadn’t made up my mind if I was going to tell you in case you don’t-- didn’t feel the same way and I didn’t want to mess us up.”
Nothing of it really caught Steve’s eye. It wasn’t that he lacked the coin, no, he just wasn’t interested. The only mouth he had to feed was his, so food was easily bought at the grocer’s or from the butcher, he wasn’t wanting for clothes and he certainly wasn’t inclined towards buying pretty jewellery. Peggy would have liked the look of it but even she wasn’t fool enough to buy from a market seller whose wares were likely stolen or faked.
Steve had barely seen him since the invitations had been out. He had managed to catch him on his way out of the Tower one morning but there was no time for a conversation. Tony had smiled, wide and brilliant at hearing of Steve’s attendance before swiftly excusing himself for a board meeting. He didn’t want to be paranoid and believe Tony was avoiding him because Tony was a busy man, but it left Steve feeling a little unsettled nonetheless.
The woman who had screamed was standing a foot away, her hands clasped over her mouth and was heaving great hulking sobs as she trembled. She looked pale, her cheeks streaked with tears and spattered with drops of red. Another lady had her arms wrapped around her shuddering shoulders, making soft soothing noises as a mother would comforting her babe.
He shrugged. “Considering Tony’s made it so that no one can know what our costumes are, it’s a bit hard to ask for help.”
He cast another quick look around his surroundings, for anything before sighing again and moved to retrace his steps.
The day of the party rolled around far quicker than Steve had thought it would. He was restless from the time he woke and even though he took a detour on his run, it didn’t shake the jitteriness from his veins. He couldn’t describe it as excitement either; it was something far more seductive. Perhaps it was closer to anticipation, the kind that skittered across your skin like electricity.
Steve felt heat creep up his neck towards his cheeks at Natasha's knowing smirk. He shouldn't have been surprised that she knew; most likely, even Clint and Bruce had figured it out. Possibly even Thor, though his stay at the Tower had been sporadic recently because of ongoing troubles on Asgard. Maybe even Tony had clocked on-
He turned at Natasha’s voice and couldn’t help but smile when he saw her. She looked stunning; her silky black dress was floor length with a slight plunging neckline and long sleeves made of lace that draped over her slender hands. Her normal bright red curls were hidden under a long black wig that tumbled down her back like a waterfall and her mask was pure, black lace.
For a moment, Steve stared at her incredulously as his mind flitted back to the invitation, still tucked in his bedside cabinet drawer. With his eidetic memory, he didn’t need to go and fetch it to make sure Natasha was right.
He pushed himself harder, calves and thighs burning from disuse, as he followed the figure around another curve-
“So, do you want to go on a date with me?” he asked, tugging Tony closer until their bodies were no longer apart.
“How much for it?” Steve asked, wincing at the roughness to his voice. How long had it been since he had spoken to someone? Probably not since the night prior when he had helped an elderly lady home after a fall but then, Steve thought with another bite of bitterness, it wasn’t his fault he was stranded without friends in the middle of nowhere.
Clint had been around for a few days before Fury had sent him on a mission to Britain and Bruce had been scant too, flitting between the science labs in the tower and the local school he was working at as a science teacher. As for Tony….
It started off with the small things. Making Tony cups of coffee in the meetings, pretending not to notice the visible surprise on his face before it was masked. Helping him cook meals on their Saturday dinner nights and gently probing him into talking about the Italian recipes he knew like the back of his hand. Bringing him a small snack when he was working in the workshop and wrapping up any leftovers for Tony and leaving them in the fridge until he was ready.
Steve watched them go, chewing on the inside of his cheek. While he believed Jane to not be the culprit, something about Darcy that didn’t sit right. He would definitely be looking into her when he made the appointment to see them.
Still, he forced himself to open Sam's most recent letter and it was a relief not to see the same message of “stay put until we say so”.
As Hogan went through the motions, Steve let his gaze wander around the street. The crowd had virtually dispersed and the market was back in its usual bustle, but looks were occasionally cast their way. He ignored them, setting his sights back on the top of the bakery and then around it. There was no clear way the killer could have gotten up there without access to the bakery itself, surely? Unless there was an alley and a way up to the roof around the back but people weren’t usually that lucky. Steve wasn’t going to discard it as an option, though; he needed as much information as he could get, however abysmal.
The flashback dissipated around him like mist and he was back in the middle of the street, people crowding and crushing him in a crowd surging forward. He sucked in a shaky breath, sweat prickling across his forehead and the hair on the back of his neck was standing on end. He couldn’t face blinking, to see the way Bucky’s hand had slipped on his eyelids. It was enough seeing it at night.
Steve dreamed of ice, of Bucky's chilling scream as he fell, of bullets, wounded soldiers, bombs and blood.
It said a lot, since Steve had been to many cities in Terrahold since his promotion from lowly constable to detective sergeant. He had flitted from his home, to neighbouring towns and bigger cities in the south, on cases or chasing after elusive leads. Sometimes, he and Bucky got to take a day to explore the sights and see all there had to see. Other days, they barely got a chance as they raced through paved streets with pounding hearts and eyes just on their targets. Hedersett was one of the very few he hadn’t had the privilege of visiting but now, he supposed was his chance. Though it didn’t much feel like it.
Hogan moved past him with the gait of a boxer, one that Steve was intimately familiar with. After Bucky’s death and before Peggy’s intervention, Steve had taken up boxing in the rings in Meckport. Usually teeming with the low class criminals but he didn’t care. It wasn’t if he went there to work; he went there to bleed. Most boxers there had a typical walk; they took every step like they were the pinnacle of invincibility.
The officer’s expression cleared and he passed it back to Steve, who pocketed it quickly. “Inspector Hogan,” he said, clearing his throat. “Happy to my friends,” His eyes slid past Steve to the body on the ground and he let out a low whistle. “
An astute, albeit suspicious, observation if Steve ever saw one. Not that he blamed the man in the slightest; if someone appeared at a crime scene in Meckport like he knew what he was doing, Steve too would have been suspicious. He inclined his head. “No, sir, I’m not. I’m Detective Rogers from Meckport,” Before the officer could ask, he handed over his badge.
“I’m surprised you haven’t stolen the spotlight yet,” he teased, gesturing towards her clothing. “Tony should be careful.”
Steve snorted despite himself. He could picture that clear as the day; it was definitely something Clint would do. “How’d you get him out of that rut?”
They both dreamed of falling and falling and falling until they woke in a panic as their dreamselves hit the ground. They both dreamed of dying.
Steve floundered as she smoothly disentangled herself from his flimsy hold and vanished into the crowd. What the hell did she mean that someone was trying to get his attention?
Natasha tsked at him. “When did you get such a defeatist? You’ve got plenty of options if you just opened your eyes a little.”
Tony treated the whole thing suspiciously at first, as he was wont to do, but Steve kept up his newly formed habits until Tony's insecurities settled down.
He'd penned a brief reply and ignored the piling envelopes on the kitchen table he never used. Spite, genuine anxiety or avoidance, Steve didn't care to name it but he was more than happy to pretend they didn't exist.
“That’s how this city works,” sneered the vendor, folding his arms over his chest. “You don’t like it? Don’t make you special. You think I’m gonna lower my prices just because someone’s gotta problem with it? Welcome to Hedersett. Everyone’s out for each other. Get used to it or go home.”
“I'm not a lability!” He had raged at his reflection, only to catch the gaze of a dead-eyed man in the mirror with more hurt than anger across his face. Ice had seeped into his veins, the fight drained from his shoulders and when he went to bed, he struggled to sleep that night.
“Ah, ah, ah,” Tony interrupted, shaking his head. “You’re not supposed to know it’s me, just yet. Didn’t you read the invitation?”
It was only when he realised of where his train of thought had gone that the reality hit him like the ice.
It hadn't taken the sting out of the bite of being made to stay but Sam had that effect on Steve. Peggy was his compass and Sam was the reason he took a break from work to spend some time in the pubs with everyone else. He felt a little more settled at the idea of staying but not by much.
It was as he went to turn back to Hogan that he caught a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye, standing on the bend outside the bakery. He stiffened, honing in on the figure who simply stood and appeared to be staring. A curious onlooker to anyone who wasn’t in the police force, but it never paid to be careful.
The girl in the centre of the circle suddenly surged up on her bare toes, snagging the lump of coal mid flight and letting out a pleased squeal. The boy she caught it from groaned, jutting his bottom lip out but switched places with her without argument and the game resumed as if it hadn’t been interrupted.
Steve had known for a very long time that he liked most genders. It wasn't something he spoke about back in the forties; the only ones who knew were Bucky and Peggy but that was all. Nowadays it was more acceptable to be out and proud.
“You’re terrible,” Tony huffed, but he was smiling so Steve didn’t take it too much to heart. “Absolutely awful, even. I can’t believe I’ve potentially just sold my soul to a vampire of all creatures.”
Steve cleared his throat, trying not to focus on the slim gap between their bodies. “You’ve got me mistaken for someone else, I’m afraid,” he said, trying to sound joking but he felt a sharp pang nonetheless.
“Stay there, Hogan, I might have a lead.” He said sharply and didn’t wait for Hogan’s reply; he bolted after them, shoving his journal in his pocket as he went.
He tore his eyes from their fun, idly thumbing the edge of his journal. These seemed to be his days now; sitting in the parks or wandering the streets. How boring and mundane it was compared to the fast way of living when he had been on duty. To some, it was either commendable or creepy that he garnered so much thrill and excitement from a new case. However big or small, nothing could beat the knot of anxiety that formed, followed by the inexplicable stubbornness of pursuing culprits and questioning suspects and the flutter when he knew he was on the right track.
His stomach sunk. Damn it all to hell. Now he was going to have to return to Hogan empty-handed. He wasn’t exactly proving he was a seasoned detective these days, it seemed. From leave to letting a person go because he hadn’t been quick enough.
He crossed the cobbled road when there wasn’t the likelihood of getting run over and cut through the market. People jostled around him, a rush of unwashed and perfumed bodies assaulting him from every angle. Vendors shouted out their prices and advertisements, women in fine dresses fanned themselves as they inspected a tailor’s fabrics and children wove their way through the gaps between hips and legs as they were wont to do.
“Have the police been called?” he asked her gently and she nodded frantically, as the young lady holding her piped up, “I called them.”
The internet was probably a good place to start. He booted up his Starkpad as he wandered into the kitchen for a quick snack, humming idly to himself as he located his hidden stash of protein bars.
Nor did it look particularly threatening. It was cream in colour and his name was inscribed on the front in sweeping silver calligraphy. His trained artist’s eye saw the faint baroque style trim on the sides and when he flipped it over, he couldn’t help but raise an eyebrow at the red wax seal. Mainly the little ghost imprinted in the centre of it.
The spine was cracked and held together by a fraying ribbon that was once a brilliant red and was now a dull, insipid shade. There was a splodge of pale brown on the pages from spilled ale in the pubs and there was a distinct splatter of something Steve really hoped was butter. Despite its new imperfections, it still came everywhere with Steve, carefully hidden in the lines of his coat along with a pencil. On a crime scene, or just for a walk, it was always there.
Falling in love with Tony was gradual. Falling in love with Tony was like lighting a match in the dark to find your way. Falling in love with Tony was like coming home.
He followed the bullet hole and resting place, up over the heads of the crowd and with grim satisfaction, noted exactly where the gun had been fired. Whoever had killed the victim, had done so on top of the bakery and was long gone. Steve suppressed a small sigh. This case was getting more complex by the minute.
“Oh no, I caught a glimpse of him earlier but I think he’s disguised himself as a waiter,” she shrugged. “I’ll find him when a tray of drinks or food inevitably gets dropped or dumped on a guest.”
Tony scoffed. “Don’t even go there. It’s more like the other way around,” His fingers gently twined with Steve’s and Steve’s heart stuttered in his chest. “For what it’s worth, I want to go on a date with you. I’ve just been waiting for you to ask.”
Part of Steve ached to pull his badge out and flash it in his face, to try and arrest him on the grounds of something, but he wasn’t on active duty. His words would hold no weight.
Steve peered at the face and breathed a sigh of relief at the time. It was only half four, which meant he had just enough time to visit the local pub for a cup of stew.
Steve hadn't been that honest with anyone since he came from the ice. It was scary but it did feel like a weight had been lifted from him oh so slightly. Tony was always there. The antidote to the venom of his mind.
He scrubbed at his face with a hand, wiping away the sweat that had broken out across his forehead and turned back to the mouth of the alley.
Her smile was like butter wouldn't melt. “It's bad manners to not pay attention to the lady you're dancing with.”
The girls nowadays did things much more elaborate things with the makeup they had on hand. Steve watched video after video of contouring and then special effects looks, mimicking their techniques and his own artistry knowledge of paint on his arms and wrists. In the end, he got the information he needed in time for him to get ready.
Yet, it didn’t matter about his surety. The suspect had escaped and outwitted him in a city in he hadn’t deigned to investigate and with it, so was a potential lead.
Steve froze, sucking in huge lungfuls of air as he stared at the empty alleyway. There was no figure, no person. Just a bricked up wall, marked with graffiti and ankle-deep rubbish. Unless the suspect suddenly gained the ability to sift through walls or climb up them, they were gone.
It took all of his willpower to force himself to turn from the smug man and stalk in the direction of the pub. If he hadn’t promised Peggy he would stay out of trouble, he would definitely have dug his heels into the cobbles and argued until the vendor backed down and made his items affordable for everybody. Not a likely outcome, but Steve was as stubborn as a mule, as Peggy liked to say. He just didn’t know when to give up and back down.
Finally, just as he was slipping on his beautifully handcrafted mask that matched his ensemble, J.A.R.V.I.S made a noise that was akin to him clearing his throat.
The vendor shrugged. “Idiots out there are willin’ to pay, ain’t they?” He turned his head, spitting a glob of saliva on the ground and Steve’s stomach turned in revulsion. His ma would have scolded him for such a disgusting habit.
Steve whistled out a low breath. Five bits of silver for that? He liked the look of journal but it wasn’t worth that much surely. Nor was it that he couldn’t afford it. Philips had been keen to at least pay Steve a healthy sum for his isolation.
As he applied his contacts, false canines and makeup (which merely consisted of some contouring, fake bite marks and fake blood), remembering the advice from the multiple girls and women from YouTube, Steve couldn't stop his mind from wandering.
“Okay, J.A.R.V.I.S,” he said, hoping he didn't sound as nervous as he felt. “Am I allowed to ask if any of the other Avengers are there yet?”
“Maybe,” Natasha's smile turned into a smirk that was downright devious and Steve would've been lying if he said that the look itself didn't downright terrify him. “But I believe someone is trying to get your attention behind you, and I must go and find Clint before he upsets Tony's guests.”
Steve hadn't bothered to write back and burned Philips’ demeaning letter over the squalid kitchen sink. Satisfying for the time it took for the ashes to burn out and leave a mess for him to clean.
“Oh no,” Tony grinned as he dragged his hand down Steve’s arm, calloused fingers leaving his skin burning as he pressed their palms together. Steve really hoped his hands hadn’t gone clammy from his nerves. “I don’t think I have.”
MayMQ: We had room service. It was awkward, but we were making some progress, mostly discussing how to handle the Queens situation. Of course in the middle of it, he started talking to Stark. Then he asked me a lot of questions about my time as his neighbor and I convinced him that I wasn’t really pretending. That’s about when Stark showed up.
“It’s been well documented in your files. Sometimes, I’m surprised you survived the army without getting court-martialed for insubordination.” The director remarked.
“The sentiment is so mutual. Let's get away from this bleak subject. The next question has to be better.” It couldn’t possibly be worse.
“What are the first two?” Am I one of your regrets? Steve wanted to ask instead, but he knew better.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. Yes, I know you all want to throw cyber tomatoes at me for the last chapter. But hey at least the drama is not coming from a breakup. That would be sad.
Counselor Laura: It would just be better to bring those that were snapped out of existence back, even if it would be five years in the future.
Me: I think you’re really good at convincing people to do what you want so I think you’ll be OK. Well, if they’re actually willing to listen to you.
Me: Demoted to Head of PR for the ATCU. I don’t like liars, even if Talbot was the one originally responsible for trying to create the next Captain America.
“I feel useful, that it is something I need to be doing. However, I'm grateful that Laura is bringing in someone more qualified than me. I'm aware we need help." Not even just Simmons or Thor. He is worried about Natasha. Sometimes he’s afraid she wouldn’t even eat if he didn’t come to the compound.
Note 2: So I received a guest review from Megajet and because I couldn’t respond directly I’m going to take a moment now to address it. Unlike Archive of Our Own, fanfiction dot net doesn’t allow you to respond to guest reviews.
“Of course, we spoke about this yesterday. I wasn’t kidding when I told Ned I’m done waiting.” MJ said as she walked out of the guest suite towards the kitchens. Flash followed behind her.
Tony Potts: Considering what happened to Vision here, it's probably better for my mental health not to. She was also a victim of the decimation.
Tony: Due to the fact that so many of my employees have tried to kill me. He’s also running one on Peter’s friends. Especially Miss Future Protester Michelle Johnson. I expect her to throw red paint on me at any moment. I kind of like her. She reminds me of you.
D Fitzsimmons: So, the stones still exist here? Or rather, they still exist in a form other than atomic dust?
Melinda: She was texting him about Clint showing up unexpectedly when he was supposed to be in Malibu with Nikki, which is what I assume to be a code name for Nate. She referred to Clint as her “estranged husband”. Also, apparently Stark now has an AI named ANA.
Now is the time for Tony and Steve’s first virtual date. Although it doesn’t go as planned by any stretch of the imagination.
Anthony: It’s not end of the world catastrophic. Maybe just people discussing the end of my world because they feel like they can. Actually you should be able to stream that channel from anywhere on your new Stark burn phone. No Geo blocks for you. It's one of the side effects of making the device unsusceptible to GPS tracking.
Tony: I also got permission for the Monkey Lover squad to step up encryption of the powered person database. I’m just trying to convince him to suspend people joining the Accords so Skye Quake doesn’t have to. But that didn’t go so well. But she’s willing to do it for the greater good.
“What would you change, snuggle monkey?” Tony asked. He did not want to get into a discussion about how Howard's alcoholism completely screwed him up.
I spoke to my boyfriend, Stefan, after what happened and he agrees that I may have been a little too hasty. I yelled and used horrible analogies and I really don’t like making anyone cry. Howard did that a lot. Stefan thinks I should take my visit to see him in South Africa as a time to reevaluate a lot of things.
“When we fix this, that’s the first thing you’re going to do,” Tony said, squeezing his hand. “I’ll plan a big reunion in Vegas. It will be interesting to hit the table sober for once. There is also family-friendly stuff for everyone. I’ve never done any of it before, but there’s a first time for everything.”
No one was yelling or screaming at each other, at least. It probably helped that Happy had decided to head back to Malibu early. Smart man. His friend may be to the point where he’s not going to keep trying to set Tony up with Pepper, but he’s not ready for pastries and coffees with Captain America yet. Tony can respect that.
Tony: But because this was essentially an excuse for a booty call with my new boyfriend it would have been awkward. You know I adore her, so I’m not going to subject her to us being completely in love with each other. Your bite marks have already healed, but I have multiple hickeys.
Me: You kind of did, but I don't want you to hang up on me so I’m just going to keep my mouth shut about it for the rest of this conversation. See, progress.
“I know the Steve of your time is with Tony. I saw a picture of them kissing at Christmas on your phone.” Steve tells her, and she can see a hint of sadness in his eyes. She knows that look because she sees it every time Steve Stark Rogers is forced to part from Tony Stark Rogers.
Counselor Laura: Not everything is your fault. After what happened with Shield, Clint doesn’t trust the government and he’s never been a fan of the UN. Honestly, he’s never been a fan of government bureaucracy and red tape. He always felt it got in the way of the mission. But he had Coulson and Fury and he trusted both of them to watch his back. He doesn’t think that the new system had anyone like that, especially with Ross as their poster child at the time.
Red phone: I’m just going to go along with that epic subject change for the sake of avoidance, I mean, peace.
Me: Or designing new gear in the new art studio/design room. They’re my happy spaces. However, the break room toaster now works perfectly fine and I added the PKI card reader to it so only authorized agents can now make toast.
Me: Also I should probably mention before I’m doing the things that we don’t want the kiddies to know about in 10 minutes that we no longer have to meet the person from the New York Times Monday. Which you know means more time to rip off your clothes or you rip off my clothes between my mandatory business meetings.
HSBF: Well, the people that the DODC were protecting anyway. Considering that two years later, a group of firefighters died because of a virus they picked up from an alien helmet, I think I made the right call.
"Estoy entrando y mas vale que tengan los pantalones puestos.” He heard Elaina say with a bag of local pastries and another coffee in hand. This one smelled more like espresso. He thinks she said something about having their pants on, but his Spanish was a little rusty.
Me: Congratulations on acknowledging that. I feel like I should send you a chocolate bouquet for your emotional breakthrough
The new consultant: That you’re not used to the world we live in yet. Your mind was just trying to come up with the most rational explanation possible. You should probably ask Simmons to give you the orientation.
I miss you so much. I don’t think there’s enough space inside of this card to say everything that I need to say, but I’m going to try. I hate being away from you and that was before you almost got killed. I hate even more that it’s my own fault. If I had made different choices, maybe you wouldn’t have been so vulnerable. I broke a television set and Clint’s jaw when reports of you flatlining were made. I’m sure you’re aware, I had to be tranquilized. I don’t want to be without you.
Red spider: I fought aliens yesterday. I fought a consortium of multiple alien races that refer to themselves as the Confederacy.
Me: I’m not sure how much fun it can be, but the catering will be good. Anything can be better with good catering.
Tony: I am aware that the successor for Ross might be worse. And that could be bad for everybody under the accords although Talbert is pretty benevolent. I think Coulson broke him in.
Me: I am so happy I’m in another country right now. Corey is not this bad with the redheaded girl from the farm down the road and he’s only 12.
StarkAE: We beat the shit out of each other in Siberia less than six months ago. I’m well aware that we kind of hit rock bottom in regards to our relationship and that’s counting the fuck-up during the invasion which led to your real boss getting shanked by an Asgardian.
Me: Now I’m happy the Princess went with the Wakanda back story instead of making her look like you and me even though that would’ve been adorable.
Chief mechanic: Yes. Anyway, your current boss Madeline Rice managed to beat him and made you her VP. After she switched parties, of course. Overthrowing democracy was a dealbreaker for her.
Red phone: I have mommy issues and daddy issues and serious Pepper issues which all require professional help.
When I get back from seeing Stefan, which I hope will put me in a much better mood because of things you are too young for, we can reassess at least the actual intern parts of your internship. The other stuff that’s a Laura thing.
The new consultant: That’s partially my fault. I told Flash to text Benji to talk things out before they ended up sharing a room tonight. Why are they sharing a room? I know the lighthouse is enormous.
In the timeline for this story (which is slightly different than in canon from what I discerned) the Siberia incident happened in April or early May 2016. The great Avengers’ escape/season 3 finale of AOS occurred mid-May. Tony made first contact Steve in June 2016. I’m leaving space for an alternate version of Spider-man Homecoming to happen in September or October. This would mean that the “six months later” scene at the end of season three of AOS takes place in early December and AOS season 4 begin in late January 2017.
“Ana said this is where I could find food and not have to interact with my grandparents or step-grandparent. This morning was weird enough. Simmons invited me to their anniversary party after the Lighthouse tour. I can’t deal with that again right now.” Everyone looked at him very strangely.
Nomad: So in this particular case, how did the bad guy die if neither one of you pulled the trigger?
Tony: Anyway, I accidentally knocked half of it out into the sink. Now I didn't hear the telltale click of a ring going down the drain, but it's not in the bag, so I just want to double-check with you before I take the Royal sink apart.
Football Hunter: Yes. Besides that, you’re all over twitter. Your picture looks dashing. I like the new eye color. Also, the beard.
“I know people change. You’re definitely different than who you were before Morgan was born. You’re calmer now.” Barely, Tony thought.
Yes your taste in men is horrible, me included. Me, especially. Why did you date me when you were well aware of things like Tahiti and Cancun? By the way, I think I’ve repressed most of Tahiti. That was bad. I guess that’s reason 622 for me to keep being sober.
Morgan’s dad: Also, you don't have to bring me food. I do know how to cook now. I don't live on protein bars and smoothies alone anymore. The nonalcoholic kind, I'm not the mom from Hey Arnold.
It felt like during this episode that the writers forgot that the Playground is located somewhere in the DC Metro and not in Los Angeles. It makes a lot of things in this episode and the next a bit awkward. So I’m creating a place on the West Coast where a lot of things can happen to take that away. But hey, you’re going find out why Friday was MIA in the last chapter.
Thank you to everyone who read or review the last conversation. You are all wonderful. Because I am going to be at Awesome Con this weekend, you are getting this chapter today. This is going to be intense.
CoulsonPJ: Focus Stark. Otherwise I'll call May over to brief you directly. She really wants to kill your driver.
“I think she would be OK with it, but you can ask her.” For some reason, Steve was blushing again. There had to be a story there.
Me: First, I made that phone so I couldn’t find you unless you wanted me to. In the event of an emergency, you can hit the yellow button and I could find you, but you’re the one who has to initiate the rescue Steve protocol.
Monkey lover 2: Not sure what city will be hit next, but I think it could be Mumbai or New York. Be ready. I’ve alerted Bulletproof Pacifist and Spidey to be on standby. Mr. and Mrs. Purple Arrow are also on standby.
"I bought Ian Quinn's old compound in a fire sale a couple years ago. The lab space is currently being rebuilt, but it seems like a good place for a secret Avenger hideout, especially for secret Avengers. Maybe Stefan can come and visit every couple of weeks." Tony has been working on this plan for a while because he is a futurist after all and the writing is on the wall.
Tony: I’m seriously considering it. Although, I am going to have to divest myself from SI. Better than I did for when I was helping with the department of damage control at least.
Me: You’re just brilliant. Rhodey is the perfect candidate to suggest for Director of Shield. I’m pissed I didn’t think of it. The man is brilliant. He did end up at MIT on a full ride scholarship. He’s career military, which apparently is POTUS’s only requirement for the position. He is definitely loyal to the US government so much so that he stole my suit.
Iron Dad: Second, I would never go on a mission for the sole purpose of making out with my fiancé in a broom closet.
As a reminder, you're not going to see every text message going on between our protagonists, only the important ones. If you saw every message, the story will end up a good 1000+ chapters. I know some of you would be perfectly okay with that, but that's a lot of chapters to dictate. Let’s be honest; a lot of them would probably be Avenger dinner orders. It takes a lot of takeout to feed the multiple Avengers squads.
The new consultant: I’m not. It was an enjoyable experience. You’re also the reason why Peter figured out he isn’t heterosexual. I gave you chocolate because I knew you needed it. We are friends.
Red phone: Probably, but a lot of Shield agents and other first responders died that day. She is still sad, which makes sense, considering what happened at Shield. There were Hydra agents everywhere from Pierce to the cafeteria lady.
The rest of this A/N contains spoilers for season seven of AOS, especially episode 7.4. But hey, it’s on Disney plus and Netflix now (depending on your country) so go watch it. However, because of events in Agents of Shield season seven, I decided that our timeline actually diverged in 1955 slightly. Most things happened in both timelines. However, there were a few differences. Such as Aunt Peggy being there to help Tony come to terms with his sexuality and letting him know that Steve Rogers was not heterosexual.
Blue phone: Be careful and please don’t antagonize the scary agent. I really don’t want to have to mount a rescue effort.
Me: Yes. I think by 2018, we will be able to use the acronym. At least that’s what Jeffrey believes.
Purple arrow 2023: So is this the time to tell you that I somehow ended up with a copy of all of those conversations you just had with your friends and family in the other timeline?
Me: Vast quantities of alcohol. That's not an option. It’s a lot harder to be honest when you are sober.
Me: And I agree, I’d rather not be famous. I guess that’s another answer we’re going to have to lie about.
“Princess level secured. Although, if Lily bear and baby spider turned around, Ana will blur their faces. She is such a good AI.”
"This is going to be a PR disaster, especially if anybody finds out that it could've been completely prevented if Happy had followed the agreed-upon protocol. I don’t know if I should let Pepper handle that on her own because it’s an Avenger thing not a SI thing." He felt guilty enough due to all the pictures of him and Steve making out all over the place. He didn’t want her to see those, but somebody had a telephoto lens so here they are.
Me: Yes, but I was so busy trying to keep Spider Brat from dying that bad guys got away except for the one that got crushed by a car. He’s in the ICU under armed guards.
TMNS: If the BITC does tell everybody, you won’t have to hit him because Afia would’ve already taken care of it. He has yet to earn back his autograph Mark Hamill picture.
Red phone: For example, I totally expect you not to answer any questions about phone sex, cybersex, or sexting.
Steve: Because we can’t wipe out all the kids born in the last five years out of existence. We’ve been focusing so much on bringing people back that we didn’t think about what would happen when we did it, did we?
Me: Jarvis left me in jail a few times after some of my bigger fuck ups. I felt it appropriate. He missed the decathlon, but he showed up in time to save his classmates, including Liz, the girl of his dreams.
Warning: This is when we start to get to some material gleaned from Spider-Man: Homecoming. However, it’s twisted around so much that if you haven’t seen the movie you won’t recognize it. I’m going to keep things light until conversation 51. However, timewise we are going to be running parallel with the movie for at least the next 10 conversations.
“Twice,” Steve said sadly. “May never really recovered from losing Phil. I think that’s the real reason why we are just…”
Me: Seriously, that again? When was the last time they were happy with me? Oh wait, when they found out how much money we were getting by leasing off most of the tower and moving upstate where the real estate is more reasonable and we probably won’t have to worry about aliens.
"Then it's probably best that I'm in a long-distance relationship and next time I don't let Pepper convince me to bring Happy with me because she needs a couple of days to lick her wounds. I'm already planning on sending Happy to another hotel."
But don’t be sad. I heard that you’re going to go to DC to hang out with your uncle Phil for a couple of days. It should be fun once he explains to your big brother why he had to fake his death like Grandpa Nikki. I asked Yo Yo to give you a Stark Phone Jr with Friday preloaded. If you want to talk to me, she will help you. I’m sure Ms. Melinda will give me my phone back as soon as we get to wherever we’re going.
Me: I distinctly remember telling you that he hasn’t been dead since about a week after the New York fuck up.
Chief Monkey Lover: Unfortunately, I can’t read that report because Ana will not let me access it. What do you not want me to know?
Email and text messages also acceptable. How long does a sex marathon last? It’s not like it’s another orgy. I think I’ve repressed Tahiti 06. Now that’s the worst thing I walked on you doing.
Me: True. OK, I will stop writing the fake ones because even though I still have some Sharon issues that are totally independent of Cuddle Bunny, I don’t completely hate her anymore.
Nomad: Maybe you can donate the ring to charity. Knowing your spending habits, it’s probably worth a lot.
“You could but I shouldn’t. That phrase might slip out a lot. You’re my little Cuddle Bunny.” Tony kissed Steve’s cheek.
The “me” in this conversation is Director Rhodes, who may be about 15 seconds from being totally done with his BFF. This conversation takes place about four days after the Mumbai incident, making it early the morning of November 12, 2016 in Malta. Tony is now just six hours ahead of DC.
Anthony: Hey, I want to shout that I’m with you from the rooftops. Posing with my philanthropic minded boyfriend at Stark Industries’ philanthropic efforts to help with animal conservation and prevent wildlife trafficking. Happy is just going to have to get used to the idea that Pepper and I are never ever getting back together. Poor guy. He’s our number one shipper.
Tony: Please tell me there’s video? Also, why did you not tell me this while we were still together in person?
Me: Ross, no, mostly because I’m pretty sure he’s more willing to believe you’re Hydra, then not heterosexual. They’re not intercepting my cell phone communications until after Friday does her magic and creates the fake ones for them to read. They just think I’m chatting up some cute 35-year-old that can’t possibly be Captain America because Captain America is the pinnacle of heterosexuality.
“Ok, let’s go find your boyfriend, he needs to talk to you with both me and Sam present. I rather get the heavy conversations out of the way early in the process, especially because Stark’s favorite coping mechanism is not telling people what’s going on.”
Now answers to my questions from last time: HRH is shorthand for Her Royal Highness, and in this case refers to Princess Shuri, our favorite 16-year-old Royal genius. I’m so happy so many of you figure that out. Cyber cookies for all of you. Of course she’s friends with Friday. She may even be giving her code a little tune up. Okay, she may be the one responsible for some of the matchmaking tendencies Friday has developed much to Tony’s frustration. A 16-year-old needs to have hobbies, even if she is a 16-year-old super genius and first in line to take the throne. It can’t be all work.
Me: Sort of and definitely. Anyway, her dad is the significantly younger brother of Skye Quake’s biological father.
Me: I don’t deal with my feelings well or at all. I have trouble saying things, sober at least. And since I’m trying to make it to my fifth month chip, avoidance seems to be my best coping strategy.
“I know. Friday sent me reading material. Did you get another phone?” Tony responded by holding up his watch as he typed out another message. Steve is not even surprised.
HSBF: I watched from the sidelines until I was sure you were actually going to get medical help. You hate doctors.
Tony Potts: That’s normal. Also, Melinda says teenagers are incredibly moody. I'm not looking forward to Morgan’s teenage years. I don't know why my other self decided to start with teenagers and preteens.
Counselor Laura: Well, they had a breakthrough on what to do when I get back to keep this from all happening again. Once we figure out how to get me back to my own time, you’re going to take the stones we can access and keep them here until we can take out the purple one.
I assume that codename Nomad will be informed of the existence of Dr. Leopold. I am currently creating a legal background for the second Fitz under the name James F. Leopold and his husband Hunter Leopold. Good thing Dr. Leopold has been using that name as a pseudonym for years for publishing scientific journal articles. Hunter will probably be upset about making them a married couple, (very messy divorce previously that I heard all about because I did ask about the Russia thing) but I can create a more secure identity this way.
Me: And I really do want to be in the same country as you and video calls seem like a wonderful idea.
D: That’s why I sent you the footage instead of just telling you. Yes. The other agents couldn’t even pick up the pieces, but Joey could put them back together again. The hammer didn’t want to come back together, but Joey told them about Thanos. They want to help.
Counselor Laura: I want to know what went wrong, so when I do get back home, I can make sure my children never die.
Anthony: What about Not Another Teen Movie? Although I’m a little afraid to expose you to too much parody when you’re still getting your pop culture sea legs.
Me: Mr. and Mrs. Purple Arrow have successfully worked things out, I think. The divorce papers have been shredded at least. Also, I may have walked in on activities that I don’t want to discuss because apparently the royal super genius can break my encryption.
Tony couldn’t help but walk over to see what she was drawling. For all he knew, she could be an engineering prodigy. Tony was putting circuit boards together at that age, and the two Fitz is were putting toasters together from scrap parts by that point as well. Tony is also pretty sure the Princess was redesigning her brother’s armor by that age.
“Yes, she is gifted. For Robin, time is not linear. She sees the past,” the Princess points to the picture of the blonde lady and the weird cat. “Present,” she then moves her hand to the image of the current scene, “and the future or at least possible futures out of sequence.” Finally, her hand hovers above the picture of Thor and the purple raisin.
Agent M: At the very least, S tried to use the attack against Red Malibu to draw out Liberty and other underground Avengers. If something like that happened to your children, no tranquilizer dart would keep you away.
Blue phone: But it didn’t stick. Wait, you said that they were friends. Was Coulson her dead friend?
Tony: Really, you should have. I had to make sure it didn’t need repairs. I can’t have you running around in a rip suit, even though I know that’s what you would be doing if I wasn’t helping you out.
If anybody needs to discuss episode four of the Falcon and the Winter Soldier, you can find me on Twitter or even discord. I have a similar username on both services. You can also PM me through fanfiction.net. I have thoughts.
Monkey lover 2: They’re losing and I don’t have a girlfriend because the person I’m in love with didn’t come through the portal with me and her current day equivalent is with who you referred to as my little brother.
Red phone: If I didn't intervene, the kid would be fighting crime in a red sweater with goggles. Or worse, he could be in one of the ATCU gel matrixes
BITC: You have a guilt complex. That is why you let Clara throw red paint on you and call you the merchant of death Jr.
HSBF: Yes. Also, this means I can talk a little more freely about some of the things I’ve been doing recently.
“Agreed. I will grab you a sandwich while you text message the Deputy Secretary.” Tony responded by leaning over to kiss his fiancée.
Anthony: Unfortunately, Skype is not secured. There was an incident that took a while to deal with. It was on the news.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You’re all beautiful and keep me in the happy writing zone.
“But I’m not Fitz. I have lived an entire different life. Also, I’m not sure how I feel about a somewhat incestuous threesome.”
Me: I'm not answering that one. You have mentioned before that you don’t want to know things that I discovered from unauthorized access.
Me: Probably. I’m exhausted and I’m trying to keep my head above water, but I’m not sure how well I’m doing.
“We are going to expand your culinary horizons,” Tony said as he threw the room service menu at Steve. “Now I wish I really did order before you got here, but Happy texted me and I felt like I had to respond before putting in an order. Good news, I think he hates me a little less.”
