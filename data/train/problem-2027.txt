When he opened his eyes, it was still dark. Rosie still was not awake? What exactly did Sherlock do to get her to sleep. He should go wake her, she needed to be changed and fed. He rolled over and winced, his uninjured shoulder ached from Sherlock’s nails digging into his skin. He closed his eyes and smiled, hearing the way Sherlock said his name, he was begging, pleading for John. His eyes opened and lingered to said man. He was lying on his stomach, neck covered in love-bites, arse exposed. The only thing that was covered from the sheet was a small part of his leg. John bit his lip in arousal, he looked so good. Slowly he leant forward and peppered kisses all over Sherlock’s back, pausing whenever the man stirred. He propped himself up on his shoulder, wanting to take in all of his lover, his boyfriend. The moonlight shone on him perfectly, as if he were walking art.
You sat up first and waited for me to stand. You didn't know what to think, I saw it on your face. You must have thought that you were dreaming. Me too, I pinched myself a few good times. I grabbed your hand and gave you a hopeful smile.
Watson’s words rang in his head that night, which is probably the reason why he woke up in the first place. He looked around, The Doctor came back. He was sleeping on the vacant bed. Sherlock was out cold; his thin body was pressed against John’s so closely, he could feel the light movements of Sherlock’s chest. He smiled at Sherlock’s sleeping form and pushed a few curls back. He placed a kiss on Sherlock’s forehead and managed to settle back into a comfortable position. He closed his eyes and eventually found his way back to sleep. But then his thoughts could only go to Watson’s words.
you. I want you to understand the depths to which I love you. I’ll love you when you’re happy, I’ll love you when you’re sad. I’ll love you even when you think I don’t, and I hope you don’t believe that. I know that you’re hurting right now, and I promise I’ll let you sleep in a moment, but please…
“No gentleman would ever be caught in public without his hat, and you lost yours yesterday so I figured that you can borrow one of mine for a while.”
John popped the disc into the player and then took his seat on the couch with Sherlock. They were practically sitting on the same cushion. John stretched and yawned, and placed his arm behind Sherlock, much to the brunet’s amusement. Sherlock took off his shoes and turned to have his back resting on the arm and his feet tucked under John’s legs. They watched the movie with the smallest of smiles on their faces at the missed intimacy. How long had John been waiting to feel Sherlock’s ice cold feet under his warm thighs, and hear the soft noises that the detective would make whenever a scene in a movie caught his eye or amused him. John missed him so much his chest ached.
Now here he is. It's nearing ten at night on a workday, and John is sure that he would be stopped from drinking soon. If not by the bartender, then Greg, though he was sure that it was going to be Greg.
“I’ve always been meaning to tell you, how I felt, for so many years, but we haven’t seen each other. We haven’t talked. I thought that maybe I could when I came back, but you were trying to propose to Mary and then every time after that seemed like an inopportune moment.”
When he gets home, Mrs. Hudson and Molly greet him at the door. Mrs. Hudson doesn't notice that John doesn't look right, but she tells him that Kylie already went to bed. Molly chimes in and says that Mrs. Hudson cooked her famous beef stew and that there was some left over in case he got hungry later on. John tries his hardest to smile and nod without telling them to leave. They do, eventually, and the first thing John does is go right to his alcohol and pop open the whiskey bottle that only had a few cups left in it. He doesn't stop until he had to wobble over to the armchair to take a seat. There's Sherlock, staring at him with his arms crossed and eyes narrowed.
She released her hold on his waist and let him bend down to reach her level. She grinned at her papa and tilted her head slightly so that he knew she was listening.
I nodded excitedly and watched with anticipation as she reached into her jacket pocket and fetched a photo. I grabbed it out of her grasp, I didn’t snatch. God she was so pretty, Sherlock. Our baby, Kylie, she was perfect. Sure she was only a gray blob on a picture, but she was still beautiful. I know I shouldn’t have gotten so attached to a baby I might not have, but Susanne liked us. She told us so.
“After that day, we all sort of drifted apart, Sherlock. Without you, I…none of us could function properly. Mrs. Hudson couldn’t bear to come up and clean your things anymore, she would always tell me that you hate with when she fusses with your stuff. I never responded to her. Greg, he stopped me for a cuppa one day. He said that crime scenes, Scotland Yard as a whole was a lot different without you there. He told me that even though they didn’t have the greatest amount of respect for you, he knows that Anderson and Sally regret their treatment of you, at least, partially. He’s getting on well, I hear. He remarried, and he’s even expecting a child with the new wife later this year. Molly would always pause in the lab part of the morgue, so she tells me, and she says that she always expects to find you there, messing with the microscope, or snooping about like you always did. I’m not quite sure about how she’s doing these days. I’ve had no business going to Bart’s and…you know…I’ve not been on any cases for some time.”
“To be honest, it would be unnecessary for me to even put so much thought into such a moronic concept. Secret Santa, it’s obvious that nobody would ever get what they wanted if they weren’t allowed to speak to the person they were going to be gifting.”
"We could make a paradox in time and trap them all in there, but I don't have my TARDIS with me, so that plan goes into the trash."
Moriarty’s smile slowly downgraded into a smirk, it was a smirk that was full of evil and wickedness as he began to think about what he might do to them. He sauntered over to a table and then moved as if he was picking something up. Whatever it was, they couldn’t see. All they noticed was that the lighting in the room was better. Moriarty had his hands folded behind his back as he made his way back over to the two detectives.
John laughed. The man could be butt naked, and still act like the most pompous ass in the room. John took the time to survey Sherlock. He was so thin, yet, he had muscles from all the cases he’s taken on and solved. All the years of fighting and trying to be strong. He looked like something out of a museum.
“Well, yeah, that stuff too but I think, for me at least, it’s because you protect things so vehemently. You go through all these lengths to protect things that are important to you, whether it’s a person or thing.”
I nodded. That's not what I wanted to talk to you about and you knew it. It was obvious that you were unsettled by the upcoming appointment and I didn't like that. Not one bit. I nodded to myself because I knew what you really wanted, and what you really needed. I got up from the bed and then walked over to you. You looked bewildered at first, but when I wrapped my arms around you, you looked relieved, like all your troubles went away in that hug. I rubbed your back and I planted a few kisses to your cheek and head. You missed it, Sherlock. You missed the intimacy we used to have, so do I. I miss it each and every day. You were the one who pulled away and gave me a kiss. It was short, but it was much needed. We were staring at each other now. Your eyes looking right into mine, not moving. You looked so...so soft in that moment, Sherlock, it was almost as if I couldn't touch you because I would break you. Your face was so youthful...you never seem to age...I did the aging for the both of us. I wanted you in that moment, I wanted you so bad. The timing seemed perfect, Kylie was asleep, we were alone...if only you allowed me that Sherlock, if only. But that kiss was enough for me.
“I bought them for you, love. I thought, if maybe there was just a bit more color in this flat you’d…maybe you’d cheer up.”
“The day awaits us, love.” John threw his blankets off his body and left to tend to his daughter. Sherlock was still in the bed, fingers lightly caressing his lips and in awe. He put his hand down and whispered, “Love?”
“Would you have even returned the feeling? For all of the times that people thought we were a couple you were always keen on shutting them down.”
Sherlock nodded, touched that John was so concerned about making him feel good. John smiled and then gently pushed Sherlock so that he was laying on the bed. He straddled Sherlock and continued to kiss his neck, and then made his way down to his chest. He relished the soft moans Sherlock made as he littered his body in soft kisses. John moved back to his mouth, and kissed him deeply, allowing for their tongues to intertwine. When he pulled away, he felt Sherlock’s growing hardness tickling around his bum. He smiled and started to stroke Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock was reluctant at first, but he responded and felt the hot breath of the older man on his neck. It smelled of brandy and faintly of cigarettes. He didn’t take Moriarty for a smoker.
Sherlock snapped his head to his left to see John standing there with Watson, and The Doctor. They looked unharmed, minus the gash on John's head. Sherlock took a mental note to make Moriarty pay now.
Sherlock seemed to let the tension in the atmosphere leave before examining the flat further. He turned back to Holmes with a smirk on his smooth lips.
“The day you showed up, actually. My man, I fed him to the angels some time ago, was chasing our dear friends Holmes and Watson down the winding streets of London. He was stopped and ran face first into your blue box. He says that it was like magic, your box, there was no way he could have not noticed it during his pursuit. He hid behind it, and watched as Holmes collided with Sherlock, and the rest of the scene that played out.
On the first week, you only wanted to see me. You didn’t want Kylie with me, or any of our friends, they weren’t allowed, it was just you and me. We didn’t say much, but we preferred it that way. We would save that for later. When it was absolutely necessary. On the second week, you allowed our friends to come and see you. One last time…
Sherlock didn’t respond, but John could hear him blush through the phone. He waited a bit before he heard Sherlock singing to the baby.
Sherlock and John glanced at each other, thinking. Then, they turned back with wide smiles on their faces. Holmes and Watson were now smiling too.
"Nope, we've only gotten to the front door before Sherlock and The Doctor had their row, I included myself in it as well. As soon as we cleared that mess up, I remember getting hit with one of those blasted darts. I heard Sherlock shout my name, and then everything else was blank."
I smiled. In so many ways, you reminded me of a child. But that wasn’t always a bad thing. It was cute when you weren’t in one of your black moods and sulked around the house.
John. You stayed, and you listened, and you cared and I never thought that I could have something, someone like you in my life!”
"I'm still here you know! Now let's go, there are alternate dimensions to be discovered, ancient cities need to be revisited, history needs to be witnessed!"
“No, we’re not going to pretend it didn’t happen. What we’re going to do, what I’m going to do, is gave you some space and wait for you to tell me what happened. Same as you do for me.”
John chuckled. He remembered when he was asked that same question by the innkeeper during the Hounds of Baskerville case. He rejected the idea, but now, he wanted it.
He didn't give Sherlock time to answer, not like he was going to anyway. John sniffed and then got up and made his way over to the whiskey bottle to refill his glass. Sherlock didn't budge from his spot while John was talking.
I hope you know Sherlock, I wasn’t mad at you, I was mad at myself for not knowing why you were so pained. Why you felt like you couldn’t tell me. I just wanted you to be okay.
“Mycroft, we’ve only spoken once since everything happened, he asked about Kylie, and then he wished me well and hung up the phone. I know that he’s known for doing stuff like that but, I’m worried for him now. All he had in the world was you and you’re…gone.” John’s brows furrowed as he choked out the last word. He had to wrap things up, it was getting late, people were staring at the man who sat in front of his late husband’s grave and talked to it all day. He didn’t care, they all could sod off for all he cared. He shoved his hands in his pockets and felt the envelope that he brought with him. He pulled it out and showed the tombstone the childish scrawl on it. It said ‘To Angel Daddy: From Kylie’. It was written in black crayon.
John was mentally screaming. His eyes flashed over to the Doctor, who was giving him the same look, and then back at the two men who not only shared the same last name as Sherlock and himself, but also live in the same exact flat!
John phoned his job and told him that he was going to be attending to a patient, and wouldn’t be coming in. He felt that they didn’t deserve to know about Sherlock’s personal problems. The media already had a field day with him when he jumped. John felt sick to think about all those news articles that called his Sherlock, his love a “fraud” “phony” “fake”, and demean him and destroy all that he worked hard to prove.
It was alright that Sherlock didn’t answer, his squeezing John’s shoulders was enough of a response. He was okay, he was okay…
John groused around before resigning to say yes. If only they had this discussion before he was ready to pass out.
I came back into the room at, I think it was a quarter to midnight, I can’t remember, time has no place for me anymore, Sherlock. I crept in the bed carefully, I thought you were sleeping, the light was off, and you were facing the other way so that I couldn’t see your face. You were still, and I was not. I wanted bodily contact with you, I wanted to shag, we hadn’t done that in months, and if we did, it lacked the spark it had before all of this.
“We are here today – before God – because marriage is one of His most sacred wishes – to witness the joining in marriage of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. This occasion marks the celebration of love and commitment with which---“
I packed your bag; I knew that you would be staying for a night or two. I made sure Molly was situated, and that we were mentally prepared to leave. You looked so pale. I told Mrs. Hudson that the surgery could be hours, so I wouldn’t be back for quite some time, either late at night, or quite possibly, early the next morning. She was teary-eyed; she gave me a sort of wave and a curt nod. She gave you the biggest hug, like she would never see you again. You gave the smallest reaction; you gave her a few pats on the back.
He took the spare key from the kitchen and clicked all the lights off before leaving the flat. He hailed a cab and held onto the baby tightly as they traveled to the clinic. When they got there, he walked up to the receptionist and put on his politest smile. She set the phone down and immediately began to dote over Rosie, who was busy twisting around surveying the new environment.
Sherlock turned to see John standing in the doorway with two cups of tea in his hands. There was a warm smile on his face as he saw John nearing him, the scent of the warm tea wafted in Sherlock's nose. John always could make the best tea. Taking a seat next to his fiancee on the bed, John handed Sherlock his cup and silently started sipping on his own.
You mulled it over in your head and decided that my logic was sound. You were tucking your shirt into your pants now.
“You know how I feel about you, Sherlock. You know I love being with you, that I love waking up to your face in the morning. You’re so fucking gorgeous, Sherlock. God, I don’t think there’s enough words to help you fully understand how captivated I am with you. Look at me now, I don’t think anyone could ever make me smile like I am now.”
Of course, that was all he said to me. He was a smart lad and could tell that I wasn't in the mood to hold a conversation, so he backed off. It was the man next to him that came up to me. He looked a bit smug if you asked me.
‘Yep…doctor said that you’ll be alright…’ I lied to you, love, and I’m sorry. Mycroft told me later what the nurse said, it wasn’t anything important. She said exactly what I told you when you got out. You needed a lot of rest, and even though you weren’t taking many cases, I still had to stop you because you needed to take it easy.
'Are you alright?' I whispered it to you because I felt like I was going to irritate you by speaking normally.
"Think Watson, think! They came here, they have knowledge of a world outside of our own! Think about all the secrets we could learn from them!"
You would crawl into the bed with me after Kylie was put to bed, and you would hold me, but you wouldn’t speak to me. If you did, it was only because I initiated the conversation. You laughed sometimes, but your smile looked forced, like you did everything out of obligation.
'Sherlock, there is absolutely no way I am going to leave you, especially now since you are so ill. If I have to tell you that I love you every morning when you wake up just to get it through your enormous brian, then I will. We took vows, in sickness and in health, remember? You are my husband and you mean more to me than I can possibly say. Please, Sherlock, stop expecting the worse from me.'
Sherlock heard him and released his hold on John's waist and allowed for his husband to move over so that he can resume his cuddling. John flipped on his other side to be free from the sun's hot rays. Almost immediately. Sherlock rushed back into his position, except now, Sherlock was nuzzled onto John's chest, snoring lightly. John kissed Sherlock's curls as he felt the soft air on his chest from Sherlock's breathing. Sometimes he couldn't believe that he was married to him, it seemed like a dream at times. They've only been married for a few months; they wouldn't forget the events that took place before and during their wedding ceremony either. He wondered how Holmes and Watson were doing, or if Moriarty came back and was now tormenting them. He wondered where The Doctor was at the moment. Was he in the past, the present, the future, or somewhere in between? Was he going to come back for them? They told him at the end of their reception that they would love to be his companions, but they would need some time to adjust to married life first. They never seen The Doctor smile so brightly before. Holmes and Watson went home after them, it would take more time, The Doctor said.
Watson laid a hand on John's and forced the shorter man to look him in the eyes. Watson saw the worry in his face and he knew it all too well.
“Sherlock, love, it would be the highest honor to be called your boyfriend. That is…if you feel the same?”
‘Easy Sherlock, I have to check you. Where does it hurt?’ I was trying to be as gentle as possible because you looked like you were in extreme pain, and I need to have some sort of diagnosis before I called the ambulance. You told me it was your stomach, and so I felt around for any abnormalities. Save for the surgery mark, there were none. Whatever was happening to your stomach was internal, and we would need the paramedics for this one.
‘And what about the other people, the unlucky ones?’ You were so eager to find out about this surgery, and since I was the only doctor in the room, all the answers had to come from me. I was surprised you didn’t know the statistics already. You probably deleted it.
John shook his head. This was ridiculous, he was talking to himself. He has officially lost it. He takes another swig of his drink and motions to sit up, finally opening his eyes.
'You're my Sherlock, you understand?' I wanted to make sure that we came to the same understanding. Through sickness and health, remember Sherlock?
'It seems that you, Mister Holmes-Watson, your....it's about the cancer...' Your eyebrow rose and your eyes darted over at me.
“I was even drinking coffee. Then Mike, don’t know why he was in the park either, saw me and asked me how I was.”
"Do it, Doctor! My eyes grow sore and weary from all of this staring; end it now so that we may find Holmes!"
Sherlock smiled and moved Rosie up so that her face would be buried in the crook of his neck. Her soft breaths tickling at the skin of his neck. John was stroking her hair to help her stay asleep.
“I haven’t gotten around to having that talk with John yet. I’m sure that John will decline the offer. He seems…comfortable where he is, with Rosie.”
‘Do these surgeries often work?’ You were getting nervous again. You were over-thinking, always over-thinking.
“My great aunt always talked about you, and she has pictures of you and Sherlock Holmes, many pictures. She used to show it to me all the time when I was younger.”
alcoholic, he was always the one who helped the alcoholic. Harry’s probably laughing at him right now. She would probably say it was Karma. All those years he spent ignoring her, or fighting with her because she drank too much. Now look at him, he was being threatened with his daughter in order to be sober. What did Kylie think of him now? Was he still the hero to her? Her father’s trusted partner, her army doctor who saved dozens of lives before he needed his own saved. He hated disappointing Sherlock, and now he hates to disappoint Kylie.
And that seemed to be the one word that Sherlock heard after their morning together. When he finally joined John in Rosie’s room, the blond already had the baby laid out on the changing table. Her diaper was just removed. John looked up at Sherlock and smiled. He reached his hand toward the baby’s items and said, “Could you get me a wipe and nappy, love?”
It was John’s turn to laugh. He placed a kiss on Sherlock’s forehead and sighed, “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
The Doctor gave a quick spin around while he was still in motion. He was definitely looking for something, but what was it? He wanted to ask but he had a feeling that he wouldn’t have gotten any information anyway, so he decided to turn his attention back to Watson.
John, feeling the heat of arousal and his climax pooling in the bottom of his stomach, positioned himself to enter Sherlock’s asshole and as he eased his way inside of Sherlock’s hole, he gasped at how tight and warm Sherlock was, god he wanted him so bad.
Angelo’s was more crowded than the first time they went all those years ago. When John was still haunted by the war and enchanted by the handsome detective. When he was the only one who ate, and asked Sherlock if he had a boyfriend. He smiled as he thought about his reaction to Sherlock’s answer. He was single, he was available, he could be his! And then, Sherlock ran off with the killer taxi driver.
John shrugged and nodded. Watson ended the conversation and continued down the stairs and made his way to the guest bedroom quickly. He opened the door to find the Doctor holding Sherlock as he threw up into the half-full bin that was on the side of the bed. Watson set the candle down and made his way over to Sherlock. He didn't notice that the Doctor was there, or simply wasn't focused on that at the moment. He knelt on the floor and waited for Sherlock to finish before unscrewing the cap to the bottle.
The chapel was big, Sherlock and John deliberated on the size of their wedding location. John wanted it to be traditional, whereas Sherlock just wanted something private and intimate. John just gave him a cheeky smile because he knew that Sherlock was never comfortable around large crowds, or just people in general, let alone something as personal as a wedding. John made sure that he told Sherlock that they would only invite people they knew, close friends and family, most of them being John’s friends; Sherlock’s amount of friends were in pale comparison to John’s. They didn’t care how many friends they had, all that mattered was them. They were each other’s best friend.
"Anyway, how would like to see your aunt today? She offered to take you to the park and everything."
Some mornings, typically weekdays, he would wake up and say, “Kylie, time to wake up!” then he would pause and remember where she was, and how she got there and then John’s body would get heavy again. He closed the door and walked into the kitchen. There would be no alcohol tonight, his headache was too much to bear. He dropped an Alka-Seltzer in his water and watched it dissolve in the liquid. He didn’t move for a few minutes, he found himself moving slower than he usually would. He took a shower the night before and discovered that he lost weight. About five pounds or so. He hasn’t had a full meal in a while, this was bound to happen. He did shave that night, he could feel his cheeks thinning without the stubble redirecting his attention. He sighed. He was always tired now, and there some days where he didn’t even get out of bed. What did he need to move for? There was no one left. It was just him, he was always alone.
Sherlock swayed his head back and forth as if he was rethinking it to himself, but then smiled and laughed at John’s face and said, “I will.”
I raised my hands up and told you that that was new. You never volunteered to help with taking care of the baby, you still never held her. You didn’t know how to respond to that and started typing away again, determined to act like the whole conversation never happened. I looked at you for a while, and hearing Kylie’s screams get louder, I had no other choice but to let you. She was already a handful when she was upset, and it was always nice to have the other parent help once in a while. I shuffled to the room and heard you preparing the bottle for her. She had a pair of lungs on her. I scooped her up and tried to quiet her down, which wasn’t much, it was just bouncing up and down and shushing her. I was surprised that it worked, to be honest. I looked down at her to see if she was truly awake, and sure enough, she was. Her big eyes looking right up at me, they were still watery from her tears. I think I remember giving something of an awkward smile. Holding Kylie and realizing that she is my daughter, it’s not something I ever feel myself getting used to.
Those three weeks were dreadful, Sherlock. Each day, the doctor would come in and say, ‘He hasn’t got long now.’
John felt like he wasn't in his body, like he was on auto-pilot. He nodded and then left the flat to get Kylie.
I didn’t want you to bring it up. Those awful two years you spent away, away from me. I was so alone, Sherlock, and I’m sure that you were too. Nothing killed me more than thinking that you were gone from me. I opened my mouth, my lips were quivering, but I found the strength to answer.
I told you that I had to return to Kylie, that I needed to check up on her and that I would return tomorrow after work. I promised you. You shook your head, displeased with me.
Sherlock laughed. He walked back over to the TARDIS and then opened the door. John couldn't believe his eyes. It was so...big, it most certainly wasn't like a normal box. John had to step out again and then reenter because he couldn't believe what he was seeing. Sherlock and the Doctor were having their share of giggles.
It must have taken a lot of courage for John to work up the nerves to say something like that. He was being so extraordinarily brave and Sherlock was so proud of him. Sherlock sat up and kissed him gently.
Before any of them could reply, The Doctor, John, and Watson came running into the room. They found them even quicker this time.
‘Molly, Mrs. Hudson, I don’t know how long this procedure will take, but I’ll take John’s word for it when he says that I’ll be alright.’ You said.
"He took me to Bubopolis. It's a planet with nothing but huge bubbles on it. And then we had tea with Queen Victoria, and that skull, the skull on my mantelpiece, I got that from chasing Jack the Ripper through the catacombs! I got my very own pirate hat from Blackbeard the pirate!"
John sniffed. The air was bitter, his hands were freezing, but he didn’t move from that spot. He smiled and blinked whatever tears tried to force their way through as he recounted his tale with Sherlock. They buried him where his fake grave was. John gave the order to place him there, to fill that empty spot with the person that was inscribed on the headstone. John closed his eyes as he remembered the funeral that took place some days after Sherlock’s death. He forgot which church it was in, the church they were married in. It mattered little to him the location, all that mattered that day was Sherlock.
"All of those times I tried to get you out of those jeans and into proper trousers, you never agreed. What happened now?" Sherlock grumbled.
I was cut off by your voice calling my name. You were signalling that you wanted to get out. I set Kylie down in the crib and went into the bathroom. You were reaching for the towel that was folded on the toilet seat. You couldn't seem to get it without the risk of falling out of the tub.
Sherlock was already flashing him the puppy eyes. The Doctor sighed in defeat. He has no choice now.
“Shall I take you inside? Or will we spend the remainder of the night standing out here hugging, because I’m getting rather cold.”
His daydreaming was put to an end when Sherlock made his way into the flat. He looked a bit green and his clothes were disheveled. His curls were out of place, but not enough to be noticed by anybody else. His eyes were still lidded, telling Holmes that he was just waking up or recovering from previous events. His body posture showed that he still wasn’t fully recovered, but healed enough to move on his own. He made his way to the couch, with a bit of staggering, and took his seat. He sat like he was expecting something. Ah, he came from a wealthy family, old money, no doubt, much like Holmes himself. He stared intently at Sherlock, watched as he examined the flat carefully. He was deducing. Good boy. Holmes was noting the physical differences between them, of which were many. He wasn’t even going to get started on Sherlock’s hair, or his cheekbones that looked so sharp that somebody could risk cutting their hand open if they smacked him. His eyes reminded Holmes of a cat’s, almond-shaped, piercing, enchanting, cold.
He opened his mouth to ask why they’ve stopped but the words died on his lips when he turned his head. There it was, 221B Baker Street. From the looks of the front door, you would have sworn that a bomb never went off in it. His eyes slowly trailed up to the windows of what was his and Sherlock’s flat, well, these days it was Sherlock’s. The windows were taped up, and from the outside, it looked like it was repainted, he wondered how far along in the reconstruction process it was. He turned to face Sherlock, whose eyes were fixed on the windows, a look of longing and melancholy washed over his face. The bags under his eyes became pronounced, his mouth looked longer due to his frown. John could only press a kiss to his cheek in the hopes to snap him out of his thoughts.
When he finished his bowl, he took his and Kylie's to the sink to wash them out. He hated having to deal with the sticky residue in the morning if he let it out. He told her to go to his room and get the DVD player ready so that when he comes in, they can start the movie. When he heard her little feet scamper off, he started the faucet and lathered the sponge.
I smiled too at the sheer child-like joy of his and nodded. I patted him on the shoulder and headed over to the kitchen to start dinner. He sat in the chair and stared at his gifts the whole time I cooked and possibly after I went to bed.
I scratched the back of my neck uneasily. It was like defusing a bomb. Molly was still ticked off, but she looked to have calmed herself down enough to actually listen to what I was saying, or, trying to say.
“But as I was saying, I knew that deep down, Sherlock was a good person, and he is, even though few others can see that. As far as I’m concerned, nobody has ever taken the time to understand him fully. From what I see, people are quick to dismiss him and label him, same as he does to them, but that can’t continue. He smiles around me, a lot actually. He has a cute smile, a bit crooked, but still nice all the same. He’s nicer, well, his version of nicer, when he’s around me. He’s downright attractive, I can’t stress that enough. But all in all, we’ve been through some shit, and I’m glad we ended up where we did.”
And then while she was hugging you, Molly looked close to tears too, but she did a good job at stifling them.
John looked up and saw that Sherlock's face was blank. He was scrutinizing John like when they first met. John's head was swimming, and he wanted nothing more than to have Sherlock's lips crushed against his. He just wanted Sherlock wholly, he wanted Sherlock in his arms. He wanted something from Sherlock, anything at all would be good enough for him. Sherlock's fingers ran through John's. John leaned all the way back in the chair and closed his eyes.
Sherlock kissed John’s smiling lips and moved down to his stomach. John watched with careful eyes as Sherlock pulled his shirt up and kissed the pudge. John blushed and threw his hands to his face.
The Doctor didn't reply for a minute. But then he found the right words and said, "Well look on the bright side, I opened the door for you!"
Immediately John’s hand was covered in Sherlock’s cum. His cock, resembling a fountain with the way Sherlock came. How long had he wanted this?
I always loved that, Sherlock. The way you made sure that whenever people met you, they met me too. Guess there really is no Sherlock Holmes without John Watson, is there?
The thought of asking John gradually faded, as each day he would tell himself another day, but another day never came. Sherlock’s mood since that night also plummeted, in a way that it has not in a long time, since before he and John had ever met. He hardly moved, if he was not burrowed in their bed, he was briefly in loo. He showered once…he forgets how many days ago. He felt grimy and sluggish, and most of all with the horrid sadness that was in his heart. He never told John about the scars, he doesn’t elaborate on his nightmares after John comforts him.  Lately, they’ve been reoccurring, and he’s been powerless against them. Sherlock was simply
Their time was cut short when Mary gave birth. John was on his way to work, he spent the night at the flat again and so he got the call from the hospital. When he got there, he found her. Her blonde hair was stuck to her face with the perspiration of a long and tortuous process, her face downtrodden with pain, but it wasn’t only caused by the pain that is childbirth, but it felt deeper and more emotional. It wasn’t until after he was trying to get his bearings together, he noticed that the room lacked a few things, one of them being the baby itself and the other was lack of happiness and joy in the atmosphere. Mary didn’t say it but John knew he’s seen it happen before. The baby was stillborn. He had to stay with her now; he had to help her heal, he couldn’t leave her with the weight of her…their dead baby still keeping her down, he had to hurt with her. He told Sherlock, and he understood, like John knew he would. That was the last time he’s seen Sherlock. He didn’t mean to abandon Sherlock for a second time, but the death of his child hit him hard. Mary didn’t help matters either, they fought even more. Both threw around harsh words to bring the other down a peg because that was the only way they could deal with the death of the one thing that kept them together. John hated Mary as the years rolled by, but he wanted to help her through her pain. It was the doctor in him and the smallest part of him that wanted to be a good husband, even if she was a shoddy excuse of a wife.
"Mycroft has taken the liberty of paying my rent. He doesn't want to see me and Kylie on the streets."
Sherlock slept for the rest of the night. John woke up to the sound of his daughter crying, his new alarm clock. His eyes were crusty from the unwiped tears he shed with Sherlock. God, he never thought that he would be able to say all of that to Sherlock. Those words wrapped around his throat and choked him each time the thought popped in his mind. He meant every word of it, every tear. It was Sherlock who never judged him for wanting physical attention. It was Sherlock who let him wear his jumpers without calling him any names other than “Gorgeous” “Dashing” “Clever”. It was Sherlock who lets him cry without calling him a sissy, who lets him be as soft and gentle as his heart always wished to be.
Just like that he left the flat, said something about getting back to the Yard before the others strangled the new recruit, I don't know. He left me alone to my thoughts and Kylie. I couldn't help but worry about you, Sherlock. Of course, my worrying increased when you started the chemotherapy...days I'd rather forget..."
John reaches out to grab the bottle again, but he makes the mistake of looking at Sherlock. He hates disappointing him.
'Sherlock, do not doubt that I still love you because I do. You know that, right?' I asked. You nodded and responded with, 'I do, John, but I need to know, I need you to prove it to me. Otherwise, why are you still here then? You could have left by now, and you could've taken Kylie with you. Why are here taking care of me? Why...why are you being so...so good to me, John?'
“You clearly seem uncomfortable with me now. You tune me out, you reply in short sentences, and what’s worse…you seem bored.”
She handed me the box and uttered a brief “Have a happy Christmas, John. You can tell him I said that.”
"You can't fucking do this, Mycroft! You can't take Kylie from me! Please...she's all I have left...don't you do this!"
“They like to call him names; freak and psychopath are the popular choices. I know that he isn’t the nicest person in the world, and that he doesn’t always say the politest things, but you know he mainly fights back because they start the argument. And part of me thinks that he was a lot nicer and kinder when he was younger, but people took advantage, or the bullying started and it made him into the person he is now. I’m pretty sure that Mycroft had a lot to do with it as well. Mycroft is his older brother.”
From that day on, Sherlock took note of John’s behavior in the flat. He noticed how the man took to wearing tighter shirts, when he wasn’t snuggled up in his beloved jumpers. Sherlock nearly fainted one night, he was watching Rosie while John was having a shower. John usually came out wearing all his clothes, but this time, John emerged with nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist. Even Rosie halted her playing to stare at her very naked father. John smoothed his hair back and walked over to the two with a warm smile on his face. He kissed Rosie’s head, earning him a smile from her. He moved to kiss Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock merely stared. John titled his head and caressed his cheek. Then, without a word he got up and walked to his bedroom to dress. The only thing that Sherlock could think of was how
It was some time before Holmes heard the door open again and saw Sherlock walking out. He stopped in front of the chemistry set in front of Holmes and stared at it for a while. Holmes tried to ignore it but eventually, he couldn’t stand the eyes anymore.
Harry’s thin lips curved into a small smile and her blonde bangs covered her right eye. She had an asymmetrical bob, and it suited her so well.
“Ah, so this would be your time-travelling machine, yes? You refer to it as “her” so she is your ship.”
'Are we going home now?' You asked me. I nodded and gave you a warm smile. You wanted a bed and you wanted your kip. I just wanted you to feel better.
I thought it was the Christmas spirit making her so happy. She looked around and said, “Say, where is he anyway? Thought you two were joined at the hip.”
“I have asked your companion before but seemed to have insufficient answers and told me to wait for you to wake.”
"John!" She whispered, “How can you forget your own husband's birthday? I've even marked it on the calendar for you!"
They both looked up at him and then quickly separated and stood up, brushing themselves and each other off. John was smiling to hide his embarrassment and Sherlock's cheeks were as red as roses.
I didn’t speak of it with you. What he said to you, and what you responded with was your business. He still hasn’t confided in me since…everything.
“So you just want us to stay here, instead of with you where our chances of survival would be better.”
“Do you Sherlock Holmes take John to be your husband – to live together after God’s ordinance – in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you love him, comfort him, honor and keep him, in sickness and in health, for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, in sadness and in joy, to cherish and continually bestow upon him your heart’s deepest devotion, forsaking all others, keep yourself only unto him as long as you both shall live?”
At the threat of John’s life, Sherlock shut up and continued walking. When they reached their destination (another dark room) Moriarty released them from his grip which was surprisingly strong for an older man.
"Holmes-Watson." He corrected harshly. Sally swallowed hard and said, "Mr. Holmes-Watson...please take a seat."
I thought that it was the wound acting up because you stopped making complaints, and you didn’t look like you were in pain anymore. I still kept a close eye on you, you were a skilled actor, Sherlock, and I knew how you operated. You always acted like there was nothing wrong with you, but there was, and you never told me anything. I can’t say that I have the right to get mad at you because I did the same.
"Oi! I have never been to the loony bin in my life! Well, if you don't count that one time where I had to do that thing that I can't tell you about because all of time and space relies on it, but other than that, I have never been there, now are you coming or not?!"
‘We’re going to meet the mother of the child today, so come on, get up and put your coat and shoes on.’
John shook his head in disbelief and ran his hand through his hair. Sherlock was real, this was all a nightmare, just another nightmare brought on by his time in the war. He was going to wake up and realize that it was all just a dream, that Sherlock was fast asleep in the bed next to him, that Kylie wasn’t there, or maybe she was still a newborn sleeping soundly in her crib. This was all one big dream.
John woke up the next morning in his bed with tearstains running down his cheek and Kylie’s stuffed animal half draped across the bed.
“Ta-da! It’s not much but it’s something. I would rather not see Mrs. Hudson get assaulted again to make the scuff marks.” It was a lame joke, but it made Sherlock smile and that was all he needed to see.
Sherlock heard John yawn. He raised his head to look at Sherlock. His eyes were still glassy from sleep, and his smile lopsided but so warm and compassionate that Sherlock thought he would cry all over again.
The car pulled up in front of Mycroft's home. It wasn't as big as some of the other houses, but it was still a decent size. The driver opened the door for Mycroft, who got out and then opened the door for Kylie and John. He held his hand out for Kylie's small one to grab, which she did. John closed the door behind him and stared up at the house. Whatever was going to happen next wasn't good. How long has it been since he's seen Mycroft? His head hurt, and he wanted nothing more than to be resting in his chair. Mycroft and Kylie were waiting for him at the door, he didn't move, even though that's what they were waiting for. He gave in and walked over to join them. When Mycroft opened the door, John felt this wave of unease wash over him. Mycroft shut the door behind them and led them down the long hall. It wasn't how John expected it to look, the decorum was lavish, of course, but it wasn't over-the-top. You could tell that Mycroft kept up appearances, but he didn't spend every waking moment stressing over the price of his interior. He was rich, but not showy about it. John strayed behind Kylie and Mycroft.
What kind of thing is that to say, Sherlock? You know that's not true.' I said to you. You clutched at the blanket harder and said, 'So lay with me, John.'
He didn’t miss the way Sherlock’s face flushed when he said that. He hid his smile behind another sip of coffee.
Taking a deep breath and clearing his throat, he opened his mouth to begin reciting his vows to Sherlock.
“….And then I looked into your eyes one day….and I saw it…I saw the light that shone through your eyes....and that’s when I knew that you and that man….not just any man….John Watson were the real deal. And all I can say to you two now is I’m so proud of you. I’m bloody fucking proud that you two found each other. It’s rare that people find a relationship this genuine but I’m so glad that you were one of the lucky ones. Sherlock, you’ve come such a long way from the man I first met all those ages ago, and I can tell you this.”
In the beginning of the dance, Watson was watching Sherlock and John with such intensity that he wondered if they could feel his eyes pressing into their mind. Likely not, they were surrounded in their own impregnable shroud and there was no place they would rather be. He felt his eyes lingering up to the stage where his Holmes was playing the most wonderful romantic melody he has ever heard. He would have to have Holmes replay it again at their flat for sure. As he watched the languid movements of the violin, and the graceful agility in which he moved the bow, he was enraptured. He couldn’t help but think back to earlier that day in the chapel.
"I assure you he's okay. John, Watson, and that chap, The Doctor, they're all okay and searching for us as we speak."
Sherlock didn’t respond and he found himself doing exactly has Holmes said. Holmes watched as Sherlock’s eyes darted back and forth and bounced all around, it was a miracle that they didn’t fall right out of the sockets. Then Sherlock’s eyes snapped back to Holmes.
He walked out of her room and went to his own. He was going to have to sleep alone again. There was no Kylie to bring him back to reality, there was no one to keep Sherlock’s side of the bed anymore. John let out a shaky breath. It wasn’t until now that he realized that he was alone.
But John looked so happy to be with him, to hold him, to kiss him. How could he deny the man that he loved such a simple request? He nodded and let the man guide him to his room. It wasn’t Sherlock’s room, he couldn’t call it theirs. He settled in first, and patted the empty spot for his boyfriend to join him. Sherlock crawled in, desperate to be as close to John as possible, wanting his face to be buried so deep into his jumper that he could feel the beating of his heart underneath. He wanted to be calmed by his love’s presence, he didn’t want to think that he didn’t belong, he wanted John to hold him and to kiss him until his lips were ready to fall off. He wanted them to be back at Baker Street, it felt
You passed out on the bed as soon as your face hit the pillow back at the flat. I did the usual and stripped you into your pajamas. You didn't even nudge. I would have found it cute if it didn't worry me so much. I remember telling myself that this was temporary, that you would go back to being you, the Sherlock Holmes that I fell in love with. You didn't want to be sick, you could barely manage when you had a cold. You were a sniffling, whining mess.
Whatever Sherlock wanted to say in response died in his throat. He only shook his head and chuckled. “You know me best, I trust you.”
They all changed directions so that, with the exception of Watson, were staring at the angels directly in front of them.
Sherlock is standing in front of John now. He's smirking, there's some sadness in it. He grabs John's hand and slowly pulls him up.
“Congratulations, may you find eternal peace and love in the arms of each other, I can’t believe it Holmes! I never thought I would live to see the day!”
“But then I met you, Sherlock, and you returned all the passion and life to these tired old bones. You took me with you to investigate the murders, you told me my life story in the cab, and we ran all over London in search of a taxi. You are beautiful, Sherlock, and I’ve always thought so, and I just couldn’t tell you because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship, and you never seemed to rebuff my emotions, when I let them slide. You asked me to live in the flat with you, and I am glad I did. They say that happiness is unexpected, you can never truly feel it coming, it just springs on you when you least expect it. But I know, that whenever I see you on a case or just being your wonderful self, I feel it, I feel the happiness, Sherlock. You’re my happiness.
John was trying his best to keep his eyes open and not blink; he tried to ignore the stinging sensation that is dry eyes. He started to wonder if his eyes were red, but even if they were, he would have to deal with it; eye drops weren’t invented yet, so he would just have to rely on his body to repair itself. There was a breeze, not a cold, sharp wind, but a cool one, a breeze that suited the warm climate well. John was able to keep his quivering eyelids from shutting but he felt something land on his eye and basic instinct caused him to shut his eyes temporarily, just to get whatever speck out of his eye and stop causing him more discomfort than he already had. He blinked. And when his eyes opened again, the angel seemed to be closer. Not directly in his face, but it was obvious that it seemed to be back in his view, and it turned too. Its face was not that of an angel. It was gnarled, and twisted. It wore a deep frown that held razor-sharp teeth to add to its grotesqueness, its fingers did not resembled that of a delicate divine being; they were claws, claws of a vicious animal. Its eyes, they possessed no pupils, all it had was blank, stone-grey eyes. There was nothing there. John was convinced now that it wasn’t just a simple statue any longer.
I made my way over to our bed and sat down and continued the mediocre method of keeping Kylie quiet, which was still effective, surprisingly, while I was waiting for you to finish up with the bottle. No doubt you were making sure that it was the right temperature and the exact measurements, don’t think I didn’t see you out of the corner of my eye whenever I was making it myself.
You said, ‘The right thing for you to do would be to leave my flat, now.’ You were past irritated, you were angry at me. You should’ve known Sherlock that it would have been made obvious one day, and telling them would be a lot harder.
Immediately Kylie ran behind her father's legs to protect herself from the strange woman headed her way. Molly stopped just in front of John and crouched down to meet her eyes. Molly's smile shortened as she waited for Kylie to speak.
“You’re spot-on with that analysis, John.” Sherlock joked. Could he not make this any harder than it had to be? Could not be so…so Sherlock? No, no, if he had to stop being Sherlock, then this wedding wouldn’t even be happening. He took another deep breath.
“That’s right, Giraffe Lestrade as the best man. You would think that he would know my name after five plus years, right? Nope, he doesn’t.”
"Yes, the TARDIS picked up a distress signal and so naturally I listened, it wasn't normal, not like the other ones I have gotten in the past. It was crying, the soft, anguished cries of a child who has lost something precious and dear to them. I couldn't possibly ignore it, I'm the Doctor and I help people...well...there are a few times where I failed in that aspect...but I don't want to dwell on that now. I followed the signal, and it led me to him and let me tell you, I have never felt so much sympathy for a child before. I couldn't just leave him there, alone and helpless, I had to take him, and I gave him back, mind you. I wanted him to smile, even if it was for a little while."
While Holmes and Watson were upstairs coming to terms with Sherlock and John’s relationship, the other pair was still downstairs, sleeping soundly, regardless of the sunlight shining through the sheer curtains. The Doctor woke up before they do, he didn’t even remember going to sleep. It’s rare he ever has the chance to find a few moments of peace to take a quick nap, but he was glad that he had the chance. He was lying on the bed now with a book that was in the drawer of the nightstand next to it. Every so often he would glance at the couple on the other bed, knocked out cold; he was trying to be patient, and to him that meant that he had to ignore every impulse to jump on the both of them and scream good morning, which was proving to be a very hard task. After an agonizing two minutes of fighting off the urges he sighed and threw the book to the side and stood up. He stretched out his limbs to prepare for his stunt, cracked a few knuckles and stood in the readying stance. With an intake of air, he ran over to the unsuspecting pair and then jumped, landing right on top of them shouting, “GERONIMO!”
John didn't respond. He wanted to say it to her, he wanted to tell her that he loved her so much, she was the one thing that still tied him to the earth, but he couldn't say it. He cursed himself and shut his eyes out of disappointment. For all of the times he scolded Sherlock for lacking the emotional support towards Kylie, he was doing just the same. She was going to hate him when she got older, and she would come to resent Sherlock because he's the reason why John couldn't say three simple words. He had no problem telling Sherlock each and every time he saw him. He wouldn't even blame her if she did.
You had the look that you wanted to protest, but thankfully, you didn’t. You kissed me on my forehead and then moved to put your clothes on while I waited outside.
John figured that Kylie could sleep in the bed with him tonight, so he laid her down and covered her up before placing two kisses on her cheek and on her forehead. While he watched her sleep, he debated on whether or not he should drink that glass of whiskey now.
John had a guess they were both smiling into the phone now. Sherlock coughed and said, “I’ll see you when you come back.”
It was a little bit after five when John got the text from Molly, telling him that her shift was over and she was on her way to their meeting spot. John was already dressed, it was a habit for him. Kylie was still lying about in her pyjamas. John didn't mind it so much, it wasn't like she had school anyway. He'd just finish making them both dinner, an early one since he expected them to return home late. It all depended on how much fun Kylie had while they were out with Molly. Ah, Molly, John wondered if she was still the same person from when they first met. Judging by the message she sent, she probably hasn't. That's good, as far as he was concerned, he was the only one allowed to change. He grimaced at how selfish he just sounded. Kylie came skipping into the kitchen and watched as her father cleaned their dishes. It was always the same two plates, bowls, and cups that they used. Kylie always wondered why that was since they had cupboards filled with all kinds of glassware.
‘You remember that, don’t you Sherlock? You remember how he never feared anything? Not even the firm hand of mummy.’
Sherlock looks angry, but not with John. “Don’t…I hit you. I saw the bruises when we were getting dressed.”
'I feel like this is a pathetic attempt at getting rid of me, John.' You breathed out. At least I discovered the reason for your stubbornness, and not wanting to go to hospital. You thought that I was getting rid of you to lessen my workload. Those thoughts came back to my head, that you were right and that I couldn't handle the task of taking care of you. That wasn't true, it never was, Sherlock.
Thankfully, Kylie woke up and gave me a reason to leave the room without being awkward about it. Her cries told me that she was hungry, and that meant that I had to warm up the bottle and keep her busy till then. I folded the paper up and set it down on the right arm of the chair, and then stood up and stretched a bit. I didn’t even get to the kitchen yet when I heard you ask, ‘Do you want me to prepare the bottle for you, John?’
When they got upstairs, they found the two men already dressed as if they were going somewhere. Watson greeted them with a bright smile.
He didn’t say anything else after that and I realised that he wasn’t going to. It doesn’t take the mind of one Sherlock Holmes to understand what he was saying. I couldn’t help but smile, I was quite flattered, actually.
Before John could disappear out of their sight completely, they managed to catch up with him in search of Holmes and Watson.
“She has done the impossible today, Sherlock.” He looked triumphantly at the now excited infant. Sherlock rolled his eyes and got off the floor and walked in the direction of their room. John was still laughing as he called after Sherlock, picking the baby up in the process. “Oh, come off it, Sherlock, I was just kidding!”
I held both of our coats in my arms and tried to keep still, I thought I might have a quick kip to pass the time and to stop worrying so much because I knew you were going to be fine, the surgery was going to be a success. I just wanted everything to go back to normal, or as normal as we could manage. Nothing was ever mundane when you were around, Sherlock.
"Yeah, I forgot he was still in the TARDIS when that last part happened but, that's not important now."
Words couldn’t describe how much that meant to me, you heard her, I know you did. She looked over my shoulder towards you.
“I didn’t notice it then, but I started to use drugs because I couldn’t bear the weight of my loneliness any longer. Everywhere I went, I was reminded of it and then mocked and insulted because of it. I never let the remarks get to me because I knew that I could just forget it all with the sharp pinch of a syringe, and for those few hours where I was high off of the drug, I could imagine a world where somebody would just…”
In almost no time, I was curled up in the bed with you again. I told myself to start on supper once we woke up. You were important in that moment, you were always important. Kylie managed to lull herself to sleep, and the flat was quiet. Instead of watching you sleep, Sherlock, I slept with you. Of course, that didn't last very long.
He waited until his patient left the room to call Mrs. Hudson. She answered after two rings, and told him that she was just about to ring her sister. He smiles, they chat for a bit, bring the other up to speed about their lives. She asked about Sherlock with the hesitation of a worried mother, to which he smiled warmly and told her all about their change in relationship. She was positively giddy then, shouting about how she knew it and that it was only a matter of time. John had to stop the conversation when she started inquiring about their sex life, however. He asked her if she would be available to watch Rosie for a bit while they went out. She agreed and expressed her longing to see the baby again.
“But John Watson isn’t everybody, I know this now. He isn’t a face I can forget, he doesn’t pass by in a crowd. He doesn’t bore me like other people do; I’m interested in what he has to say believe it or not. But that day in Barts, when Mike—“
I noticed that you were taking the pills again, even more than usual. I had to warn you, overdosing on painkillers didn’t seem like a smart choice, did it Sherlock? And whenever I was home, which was a lot more now since I was worried about you. You would make these brief faces of discomfort and press a hand to your stomach, or where they operated. This got me worked up, Sherlock, because I’m your husband and I was your doctor, so any time you acted like you were in pain it set me into doctor-mode. Every time I asked about you, if you were okay, if you needed anything, you would shake your head and tell me that it is nothing that I should worry about something else. You were hiding something from me once again, and frankly, Sherlock, I was tired of it. I nearly got fired so taking so many days off, but they could sod off. You came first, always.
Sherlock shuffled in the couch, thinking of something to say. He never was good with conversation with people, it was even worse with people he didn’t know, it never even gotten that far sometimes, they would simply call him a freak, or some other harsh term, and then walk out. Sherlock learned how to tune them out over time, but there were still just some moments where those terms found a way to get to him.
“I do enjoy being around him, believe me I do, but there are times where I simply wish to have the companionship of somebody else. Surely you feel that way at times?”
"Sherlock used them. Most of them were used for his experiments, not sure how many of them are clean enough to use."
Send me ideas for the next story in the series! I have a few of my own but I'm saving them for later.
I nuzzled my face into your soft, and thinning curls. Each time you went back for chemo, the more your hair fell out. Thankfully, you didn't go completely bald, but I don't think that you cared about that anymore. I whispered your name and told you that we had to get up and, of course, your response was a groan. I removed my face from your hair and then started to move it out of your face. Your eyes were closed, but I knew that you were awake, otherwise you wouldn't be answering me. I peppered delicate kisses all over your neck in hopes that it would persuade you into getting up. It got a reaction, but not the one that I was looking for. You rolled over to face me, your eyes were tired and you looked positively drained. Your hand made its way to my cheek and you gave it soothing rubs. Such a small act of affection, but it left me wanting more.
“Yes I know that Holmes, but I know you, and you would have outright rejected the idea with scorn and mild amusement.”
“When I woke up and you weren’t in the bed I thought that…maybe I just dreamed everything…or you left.”
"I am thinking about her. This...this helps me calm down, Sherlock, it helps me think better. I...It's my way of coping."
Rosie was getting heavy so he repositioned her. It was a good thing he brought the carrier in the diaper bag. “Well, this is your lunch break. Show me how John Watson spends lunch.”
Watson tilted his head from side-to-side, listening to John's words. Holmes finished his toast and then took a sip of his tea. He placed the cup down and then folded his hands in a regal manner and placed a smile on his lips that John could instantly see was fake.
"You hated the chemo so much, Sherlock. The first day we went to hospital to start your therapy, you were so upset. You crossed your arms and pouted for the whole cab ride. Even though, you didn't let me, I laid a hand on your thigh and gave it a squeeze. You weren't talking to me, but I had your attention. I told you that everything was going to be fine, this will only take a few hours, I said that we could go home and watch any movie you wished. I wasn't treating you as a child because you aren't a child. You were nervous, and you had every reason to be, chemotherapy wasn't easy. You were so brave, love, you didn't fight the nurse as she sat you in the chair and prepped you for the session. You looked at me and your eyes were big and they were scared, I might even go so far as to say that your lip trembled. I gave you a smile as I took your hand. There were several other people sitting in the same area as us, some of them looked about your age, like they just started, the others there...those were the ones I didn't want you to look at. You were eyeing this woman who was sitting adjacent to us. Her hair was already gone and her skin had a yellow tint to it. Her eyes were closed as she sat back in the chair. She didn't have much time left. You looked at me and I could tell you wanted to leave, Sherlock, you wanted me to stop the machine so that we could return home and cuddle on the sofa. I couldn't do that. I didn't enjoy watching you get pumped full of medicine that made you sicker than the actual cancer, I didn't enjoy watching you squirm around with your arm firmly placed on the rest. I didn't enjoy seeing you suffer.
"I know that you need this right now, and although I am not a fan of hugs, I'm willing to give one to you."
“There is no risk because nothing is going to touch him, do you understand me? If they think they can mess with my Sherlock then there will be hell to pay.”
John had no choice but to listen to him. He wasn't going to trust him yet, but he had nothing else to go on. He wasn't even sure if this was all real or not, it all seemed like a blur; one minute they were sitting on their bed talking about their marriage and then next thing he knew, he was riding in a time-machine with a madman with a box and ended up in Victorian England. But if this was really happening, then that means that Sherlock really did get a concussion and that they were in their flat, or a version of it and that he was in the company of two men who were exactly like Sherlock and himself. That also means that man who calls himself the Doctor was also in his time-travelling police box trying to find out where they are.
I couldn’t respond to either of those questions so I stood there and stammered like an idiot while you tore me to shreds with your eyes. I let out a sigh and told you that our friends were waiting to see you outside. Your eyes nearly popped out your socket. You moved a bit to try and get a good view through the small window that was built in your door. You couldn’t see anything from where you were sitting, but that didn’t stop you.
"Don't worry Kylie, I'm coming with you. I know that you aren't too fond of being around strangers."
‘And tell me then John, how would I be acting if I were myself?’ You were always so sarcastic and snarky.
Sherlock looked like he wanted to ask him to stay again, but if he thought it, he never said it. He only nodded.
John never understood why he said that, but now he does. Sherlock told John that he was losing him, that he was Mary’s now. John wasn’t going to need him anymore because he’s going to have a family, a real family, and there was no room for him. How wrong he was, John needs him now more than ever. He opened his eyes, and they wandered him over to the band again. He can’t wear this around, it reminded him of a time where he thought everything was better, but it was only tragic. What he wanted was Sherlock. Sherlock was the only thing that could save him from himself. He grabbed his cane, clenched his jaw and the rose up from his miserable chair and walked out of the house to go find the one person who can make everything right again.
Like a petulant child, Holmes rolled his eyes and then nodded. Watson was highly satisfied with that.
Rosie was silent now but he could hear her soft noises through the phone. John was sitting in his office grinning like an idiot. One day he’s just going to sing to Sherlock, with Sherlock, he didn’t know. He just wanted to hear the man sing again. Sherlock was talking to Rosie now, “Are we better now?”
John was still screaming her name. Even though Greg was pushing him farther and farther away from her. He saw her giant blue eyes staring at him with tears spilling from them. She saw Sally’s hand resting on her shoulder, and Mycroft standing behind her, just staring at him. How dare he? How dare he look at John with remorse? He planned this, he knew that this was going to happen. Was this why he supported John for so long? Why he paid his rent without any sort of repayment from John? He expected this, of course he did. He wanted John to slip up like this. John’s face was so hot from anger. Mycroft took Kylie away, his pup, Sherlock’s little dove. Greg was speaking to him as he opened the door to the car that brought him to this godforsaken place. John stopped moving as the front door closed behind him. She couldn’t hear him anymore, it was over, and Mycroft had her now. He felt his body being pushed down and then the familiar feeling of the leather seat against his hand.
'Sherlock,' I said,'We don't need to have sex in order for me to find you sexually attractive. We don't need to have sex at all just to prove that we love each other.'
'It fell out...' You still didn't move. I was confused and so I asked you what was falling out and your eyes got glassy and I immediately felt bad for asking you. You held up your hand to me and then you opened it. You were holding a tuft of your hair.
Sherlock was very pleased with himself for showing off his flashlight. He clicked it off and then made his way to The Doctor.
The Doctor was taken aback, but he let him vent, he knew that he was very worried for Sherlock, as he rightfully should be. Watson just stood there, not knowing if he should intervene or not.
Sherlock walked into the room and gave him a kiss. John rubbed Rosie’s leg and said, “Hello, Rosie.”
John woke up before Kylie. It was always this way on weekdays. He would wake up and make them both some breakfast and then the smell of the food would have Kylie racing to the dinner table in no time. Sherlock was gone. He was expecting this, Sherlock would show up for only a moment, and then, whenever John would fall asleep, or lose his focus, he would vanish again just to pop back up and torment John some more.The sad thing is that John shouldn't be looking forward to it, the two-second visits. He shouldn't be happy to see that transparent figure staring at him with those eyes that he missed terribly. He shouldn't be willing to ignore his daughter, just to be graced with Sherlock's visit for however long it may be.
He crumbled the paper up and let it fall on the empty seat of the couch. He tried to remain indignant, aloof even, but we’ve been together long enough for me to realize that he was sad.
“John Watson.” He breathed. Said man pawed his face and shuffled closer to Sherlock. Sherlock was sitting up; John’s arms were wrapped around his waist and his head was resting on Sherlock’s stomach. He smiled and rested a hand on John’s back, raking his free hand through the soft blond hair. He had to admit, John’s new hair was very fitting for him, he was always handsome to Sherlock. John let out a soft groan at Sherlock’s head massage and held him even tighter.
“Can’t help it, besides, isn’t that one of the things you admire about me? I remember you telling…who was it…everybody on your blog?”
John turned his attention to Sherlock and walked over to him before taking a seat in the chair he sat next to the bed. He took his lover's hand in his and rubbed it with the pad of his thumb as he let out an exasperated sigh. He let his free hand wander to the younger man's cheek and rubbed it. Pulling Sherlock's hand up, he pressed his lips against the soft skin and kept it on his lips. Remembering that the Doctor was there his eyes shot over to the man and he briefly pulled the hand away to respond.
They sang to Sherlock, no matter how much he hated it, John smeared some cake frosting on Sherlock's nose, much to his secret enjoyment. Even though he acted like he didn't like the party, he was secretly pleased. John and The Doctor could see that. The party ended after two and a half hours, with a slightly tipsy Mrs. Hudson, a bubbly Molly, and Lestrade in a better mood than earlier. The Doctor said goodbye as well, promising that he'll have to take them on a real adventure soon, since they were his honorary companions. All that was left was Sherlock and John. John was cleaning up the aftermath of the party, while Sherlock was sipping away on a cup of soda. He rarely drank the stuff, but it was a special occasion.
“I wouldn’t have remained with you for this long if you still remained a mystery to me now would I?”
As the guests shuffled around to push the tables back, Holmes and Watson, along with The Doctor made their way up to the couple, who were recovering from their pulled heartstrings.
Sherlock was crying the word “no” and shaking his head, his limbs were flailing as if to protect himself from an invisible entity. His low whimpering turned into screaming. He was shouting “get away” “leave me alone” and John’s heart broke when he saw the tears streaming down his face as he screamed for help. John went to hold him when Sherlock started screaming his name, voice dripping with agony. John wondered if it had something to do with the scars on his back. He didn’t want to ask because Sherlock never interrogated him on the state of his wounds, he made it a point to love him for all of his scars, and John would do the same whether he knew the story or not.
I was visibly confused at that point, and I asked him to clarify what he meant by that. He put down my soiled jumper and looked at me with a calm face.
“Hello, John.” Sherlock looked up at John with a warm smile on his face. John smiled back and stood up. He ruffled the man’s curls and walked over to the coat rack.
Greg was pretty miffed too, but he kept quiet. He just folded his arms and glared at me while the two women, and the baby, tore my head off. I think Kylie was only shouting because everybody was doing it too. I held my hand up in the air to halt their yelling and tried to explain without throwing you under the bus and making myself sound like an arse. It was quite possibly one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do.
Your smile softened and your eyes glazed over. I felt bad, I was acting rather cold towards you, and I do apologize for that, Sherlock. God knows that you needed the company during that time. Kylie made some sounds of excitement once she saw you. You bent down and placed a short kiss on her forehead.
I cocked my head at her. I had to readjust Kylie’s bottle because she was sucking on air for a few minutes.
Mycroft looked down with a pained expression. He knew he messed up, but he was only trying to prepare Sherlock for the outside world because he knew how cruel it could be, and how soft Sherlock was. The only thing he accomplished was making Sherlock just as harsh as the rest of the world.
The suspense was killing them, it was almost as if it weren't a person walking towards them but a ghost of some sort, haunting them and making them think they lost their minds. But once a foot stepped into the light, John and Watson were ready. However, when the rest of the stranger's body was revealed to them, they realized that it was no stranger at all.
And there it was. Sherlock thought that this relationship was temporary, to fill a hole that never needed to be created in the first place. He knew that he shouldn’t have left, that he should’ve left all his belongings here and found excuses to visit him every day. He wished that he didn’t leave him alone during the honeymoon, leaving the blog comments unread, text messages unanswered, phone calls sent straight to voicemail. If he wasn’t such an idiot, he would have seen that Sherlock tried everything he could to keep it all together for the hopes that maybe he would come back, but he ignored it, and the feelings that bubble over whenever he looks at Sherlock, and now here they were.
"Ah, so your companion has the same vice that my own does. Holmes has a nasty addiction to cocaine and although I try to ween him off, he does have the habit of going back to it."
And just like that, he turned them around and started walking. John could’ve sworn that he saw The Doctor looking behind him every so often. That made John very suspicious.
No answer. The cab pulled up and Sherlock opened the door for her. When she was inside he gave her some money and stepped back so the car could leave. Mrs. Hudson rolled down her window and she was frowning.
John turned his head to face Sherlock’s. There was something that made his boyfriend so tender, the white pillow that he was resting on, the sun shining right on his pale skin, illuminating him into what John liked to think, a work of art.
“You protect me, John. You. It’s always you, John Watson, you keep me right. And I know that I almost never say it, or when I do, it comes out as something completely different, but today is a special day for the both of us, and I think I can let myself say it now without worry of rejection.”
Once again Sherlock gave a cough and John just kept that goofy smile on his face. The Doctor walked over to the entrance and then opened the door and stepped out. The first thing that was wrong was that it was daytime, and the second thing was that he couldn't see the Eiffel Tower anywhere. He looked around, there were no hover cars, no roads, just horse carriages and people shuffling up and down the street.
Sherlock stood back up, neck stretched and eyes glued to the wallpaper as he walked up and down the small hallway.
He held his hand up and struck Sherlock across the face. Of course it would sting, but he wasn't doing it out of anger, it was clear that Sherlock needed assistance in returning from the state of slumber that he was in. He needed just enough shock to force him out of it, and hopefully that was enough. Sherlock awoke with a strained yell. He looked around at his surroundings while trying to get out of his bindings.
The irritation in Sherlock’s face dissipated and he lost whatever nerve caused him to get this far. John was rubbing his bare thigh now. It was so soft, and wet, and he smiled at the way Sherlock’s muscles loosened and his body slowly lost his tension at the simple touch.
Holmes didn’t respond and only moved away from Watson and tried to look as detached as possible. But Watson has lived with him for so long that can look past the man that Holmes wanted people to think he was, and the man that Holmes really was.
“How was that?” Sherlock’s voice was unsure, nervous almost, and even though John was still recovering from the amazing oral, he didn’t want Sherlock to think he was inadequate.
“I understand, John.” He said, “I understand completely. I feel the same way; I just wanted to see if you thought the same. Holmes is like a drug, I can’t get him out of my system, no matter how hard I try, though I think I don’t try that hard.”
The last person I wanted advice from was my alcoholic, divorced, sister. If I hadn’t been so stubborn, I probably would’ve followed her advice properly, and I would have handled it better.
