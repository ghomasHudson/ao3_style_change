They take their books outside to the yard and sit down on the ground, their backs to the fence and they begin to read. Occasionally the older man squeezes the teens thigh to let him know he's still there because the boy was so wrapped up in his new book. The thigh squeeze brings him back to reality the third time around, finally causing him to look up at the older man that he had been unintentionally ignoring.
Dean winces in pain and begins to cry-though no tears fall from his eyes.
When he walks into the high school he sees the principle waving him over, "This way, Sir. You have got to do something about this boy or he will get kicked out of school for good." Castiel nods, he's being led to the nurses office and he sees the teen there - holding an Ice pack to his mouth. "Dean-"
Dean was at the table eating cereal, and he ignored the boy-not on purpose, not because he was being mean-he just didn't want to talk to anyone. Castiel smiles weakly at him before walking slowly to his car. He does stop by Starbucks before going to the hospital, it was his prize for surviving another night with his boyfriend. Though the coffee does very little to lighten his spirits, it does ease the headache he'd woken up with.
Dean wraps his arms around him and starts licking into his ear, "Dean, please stop. I'm not comfortable with this-" It's not long before Sam joins them, pressing nervous kisses to Castiel's neck. "Stop-"
Castiel admits with a hard "No, I didn't." and that visibly upsets her. "I just- I can't leave him." he says, typing quickly on the keyboard so he can finish up his notes because he doesn't wan't to talk about this.
"Two months-" the teenager hugs him tightly in an instant. "That's a yes, right?"
He's instructed to stay put and does as he's told while Castiel disappears for almost half an hour. It was pretty scary to be all alone in a hospital room and it's the main reason why Dean was holding onto his Spiderman that his father says he's too old for as he waited for the man to come back to him.
Castiel wipes under his eyes too, "Sure-" and stands up, guiding the teenager back into the house, leaving Bobby outside. Once in the kitchen he cuts into the pie with a large knife, cutting two big pieces for Dean and his friend. "Ice cream?" he asks, opening the freezer and Dean nods. "There you go-" he hands him the plates.
After arriving at the teenagers house, Dean was about to park outside by the mailbox when he saw Castiel running up to his car.
Castiel knees almost buckled, “Ohhhhh shiii-” he steadied himself on Dean’s strong shoulders. His hips now having a mind of their own, he began to fuck Deans face. “Fuuuck-”
There's a soft knock on the door before the doctor lets himself in, "Hey Dean, what's the problem today?" he sits down on the little stool that he pulled out from underneath the counter. He opens his file next, ready to scribble down anything he's told.
Her whole vibe shifts to one of utter compassion but she doesn't pry, "I see, would you mind if I take a look?" Dean hesitates, biting his already short nails. "Either I look or the doctor does-"
The next few days Castiel comes around often, to hang out with John- but it's also a way to check on his son. He came around the day before school was supposed to start with a gift for the boy, he'd intended on leaving it with John but he hadn't been home yet so Dean answered the door.
"You're fine, Dean. You worry too much-" he pulls the teen closer, pressing a few kisses to his tummy. "I love you." After a short make out session- Dean falls asleep rather quickly. Castiel was right- the wine worked.
Soon enough they're eating their burgers, plain of course because Castiel forgot to buy mayo and ketchup so their meal was free of any toppings. Though it was still good nonetheless, Dean made the best beef burgers and they didn't need anything on them to make them great. Dean gets up and goes inside to grab another soda, bringing his step father a beer as well.
Dean's enjoying a hot cup of coffee and a bowl of cereal when there's a knock on the front door. It almost startled him because no one ever stops by, "Kevin-" his eyes widen almost as soon as he's opened the door. Surprisingly his church buddy came to see him, "What are you-"
Castiel blinks, ignoring the exposed thigh flesh. "A new leather jacket, but you have to promise not to ruin the surprise-"
"He probably likes seeing naked people passed out." Dean jokes as he now finished his chips as well. "Why are you here? I mean- don't you gotta be checking on people?"
It's not until he's on his way back to his bedroom with a bag of chips and a can of soda that he notices sweet little Dean Winchester. The boy was fast asleep with his beloved spider man plush doll in his grasp, the view tugs on his heart strings a little too hard right then.
"Can't we get my suit after we go see the doctor?" Dean's pouring way too much cream and sugar into his coffee. "Bobby said you were really out of it, don't think you should go anywhere alone-"
His hand is caressing the teens hair lovingly as if to coax him into believing his words. "I never would do
Ash laughs, "This isn't high school buddy-" and wraps his arm around the Winchester. "I like that we can fuck around like this and still be cool-"
"He wasn't sleepin' was he-" Bobby says, one arm around his boy.
"Your eating disorder, yes." She smiles, "By the way you can call me Jody-" and finally allows the teen to call her by her first name. "I think we're on a first name basis now."
"It's a little strange-" Castiel says, "-Dean doesn't like having me here."
"I came to check on you, Dean." He really doesn't want to ask why he hasn't been in school the past few days. He's happy John isn't around, If he was he'd probably rip him a new one. The poor kid is probably so used to getting beaten up by now.
Castiel whispers, "No baby-get that out of your head." Dean nods. "I just feel sad a lot, that's all- it's been hard these past few years." Dean lets him speak. "Raising you all by myself hasn't been easy, I tried my best and somehow still feel like I'm failing you. You're getting arrested-" he pauses, -you're beating people up, I don't know how to handle you sometimes. I know
Ash picks up on the silence after being on the road for a while, "You alright?" he looks over briefly.
Dean shoves him aside and walks in, now he's suspicious of his step dad. "Why was the door locked-" he looks into the living room, then peeks into the kitchen. "You got some dude here?" he crosses his arms.
Castiel is drinking his morning coffee at the kitchen table one morning when his love stomps over to him, clearly in a rush before school. "Good morning baby-" a very impatient hand is held out for him to place something in.
"Go answer that girlfriend of yours-" Bobby hands him a clean rag to wipe his hands with. He rolls his eyes and wipes his hands clean before fishing his phone out of his phone. It wasn't Robin, it was Castiel. His eyes dart up to look at Bobby- he's too busy focusing on the car so he opens the message.
Castiel pulled his hand back harshly. Both of his hands now under the table.
Castiel nods in his own humiliation, "I'm sorry-" his arms wrap around his love again.
It's a little too awkward so the younger teen excuses himself to the porch to smoke a cigarette. After lighting it, his friend comes out to join in and they pass the cigarette back and forth in silence for a while. Until he excuses himself once again, but this time for the bathroom since they're about to get on the road to Bobby's.
Dean rolls his eyes, "Well I wasn't doing
"Or else what? What are you gonna do?" they both laugh like children before his eyes. "What's the worst you can do. Fuck us?"
"That alright with him?" he looks at Castiel as he's putting the hot dogs in buns, handing them over to his guests on paper plates.
Dean starts crying like a baby and his
Dean goes red instantly and he shakes his head. "Of course not-" she then asks about how he's been dealing with his grief. "Uh-" his hand instantly rests over his arm, where the fresh cuts were. No one knew about them, not even Castiel. "Been angry a lot I guess."
Almost like the shadow heard him, it peeks out and he sees it. But this time it looks real. It looks solid. He's not imagining it.
"Mmmmhmm-" she nods, shutting her eyes before she starts to tremble with her orgasm.
Castiel shuts his eyes, a single tear rolls down his face and just keeps going.
"Hey!" he shouts over cupped hands, Both he and his uncle look his way. "They announced a tornado warning on the news just now!"
"Ah-" Castiel nods in understanding, "-so you like Jennifer Love Hewitt."
awesome.
"Morning sunshine." Castiel kisses his lips before he's even woken up, "Feeling better?"
“Dean?” His eyes were wide. Like he had done something wrong.
"Baby, I like Robin-" sits down on the edge of the bed, taking the playboy away from him and setting it on the nightstand. "I just worry that she's going to get you involved in her drama-"
Dean snorted, "I'll call you Cas, but maybe Jimmy rolls off the tongue a little easier." he winked.
"Do you mind me being here?" Castiel asks after another while. "I know you were mad when I moved in-"
Kevin's eyes bug out, "Really?" Dean nods. "I kinda like-her." he looks over as a pretty blonde girl who looked to be the nerdiest of the bunch.
"Since when?"
"Get some sleep, tomorrow you're helping me put it a transmission."
"He's here-" Gabriel blinks, looking down at his chart. "He's in the ER, in room three-"
Dean sighs and shuts the door. "They're not here. Why?" Instantly Brady pushes him against the door and he winces when he doorknob digs into his back. "What the fuck is your problem?"
By the time he's done
Castiel comes over to him with a plate of eggs and pancakes, "Cas, I said no fucking pancakes-"
"Guess I look younger than I am, I'm forty one-"
Dean kept his mouth shut even though all he wanted to do was scream and kick everything in sight just like his father kicked him and his little brother around like trashcans by the curb. In some sick way he's jealous that little Sammy didn't remember any of this, because he'll always be older and always old enough to remember everything. After a warm shower, he's dressed in some new khakis and feeling no better.
Dean nods, knowing all too well how angry the man can get. He'd been on the receiving end of a whole lot of spankings growing up and the occasional beat down now that he was older. Lately it was mostly hair pulling or some shoving around when he came home drunk and he actually preferred this since it left no bruises and there was no down time.
"It hurts-" Dean whines, his fathers grip on his arms burn- "Stop-" he looks around the living room and sees that John was stealing Castiel's flat screen, "The fuck-"
Dean whines, the doorknob digging into his back is pressing into his spine. "Whatever-" he lets himself slump down to his knees but Brady yanks him back up by the arm.
Dean would come home from school and pig out on everything that was in the fridge and he did that every day the last few weeks. If Bobby woke up to find his nephew eating at the kitchen table in the middle of the night, it didn't phase him.
"I don't work this weekend." Castiel says in a cool tone, "I can do it then."
Castiel hands him a napkin, "You're still sick?" the boy shrugs. "We'll stop by the store, get you some medicine."
Dean lets himself into the tow truck, making sure it's got plenty of gas before driving away. Derek had sent him directions to where his car had died on him, it was way into town, near the diner so he manages to get there in almost half an hour and he drove slow like his uncle told him to. There he was, Derek hale- leaning against the coolest car he's seen in a while. He honks at the guy, who quickly turns his way and smiles.
He nodded, lifting his head to meet his gaze.
"How do you feel about me?"
At the hospital, he's got the blood pressure cuff on his arm- "Easy!" Dean hisses- "That hurts." The nurse doesn't try to be gentle with him- she looks stuck up and is probably grossed out by how sweaty and smelly he is at the moment. Dean could care less, he doesn't know why he's there.
The man smiled all the way home to shower and get dressed for another work day.
Dean blushes, "Nothin'-" there's a hint of a smile on his lips. Once inside, the subject is quickly changed. "So that blonde chick, she's got huge jugs-"
"Whenever you're ready." he simply says, "Don't stay out here too long." and he goes back indoors for dinner. Both men eat their greasy burgers at the kitchen table but keep an eye on the teenager through the window- they always keep track of him these days. Even if Dean doesn't always know about it.
Castiel shrugs, "I was going to pay you three hundred a week-" Dean quickly retracts his statement. "-thought so. Besides, if you want to be my little housewife one day you have to learn how to clean and do laundry for me-" he takes another large bite of his sandwich with a smug smile.
Brady pulls the younger teen close, by the waist. "You smell good-"
Castiel gets why and peels away from him, "Okay Dean, that's enough-" he stands up and carries their dirty dishes to the sink to place them inside for later. "So, now that I'm free today. What should we do?"
It wasn't until Sunday the following week around 1:45 in the morning that he spotted him.
Dean looks up at the sky, they're both already walking to the Mcdonald's near their school. "Yea, sure. Cas gave me some cash."
"Ugh-" Dean moans, he's sliding down Castiel's body when strong hands lift him up and he feels something hard and thick poking his hole. "Shit-" he braces himself for it, meanwhile wrapping an arm around Castiel's neck for leverage, planting his feet firmly on the tubs floor. "Ugh-" he winces, he's extremely tight. "-fuck."
Dean doesn't care about choir practice or Sunday school right now because he just met a girl his age named Claire and shes got blonde hair with blue eyes. His mind is on overdrive and all he can think about is that he found Castiel's daughter, he's not sure- it's highly impossible but he can't shake the thought. Even as Castiel drives to the diner for lunch afterwards, he can't shake the idea.
The following day, Castiel feels no different- except for the side effect of nausea from his new medication. It's the first and final time he will be taking that darn pill. "Cas-are you still sick?" Dean asks while they're sitting down for dinner- he hasn't eaten all day.
Castiel smiles instantly, "Yea-" and tells his friends to take a walk. The teen quickly sits down at his side on the bench, holding onto his arm like a needy toddler. "What's going on baby?" the question is asked mindlessly as he picks up the cards to put away in his jacket pocket.
"I like that." Cas whispered, not wanting to ruin the moment.
Dean takes in her words and feels a little better because it was true, this was a real fear of his after Castiel made that joke about dying one day. Before then, his death wasn't even on his radar as a possibility. It always was going to happen but not any time soon and Jody helps him to see that clearly.
Castiel goes with Mr.Winchester for coffee and is confused about what he may feel for him, and what his parent's have told him in the past about letting someone get too close to him.
"I'll be packing up the rest of our stuff- the stuff I think is worth keeping anyway."
"I care-"
else. "Thanks-" he says shyly. "You always come through for me-"
Dean makes the bed and doesn't do a very good job at it, the corners are never even but it's better than sleeping in their mess again. He takes care of the dishes, which is the absolute worst chore of all time. Then comes laundry which he doesn't mind so much, it's quite relaxing to get lost in the folding and putting away of shirts and pants. It's only relaxing to do this with Castiel's clothes, his own always end up on the floor and it's unclear why.
Dean's tears fell, "Yea."
Castiel groaned in anger, his thumbs typing out a reply on the touchscreen.
Castiel bites his lip, "Yeah."
The boy looks at the money, then up at him in confusion before taking it and all Castiel can think of is Alex. The urge to see him again is growing with every passing second that he stares down at the innocent child in front of him. Dean walks away, going to his bedroom and leaves the door wide open as usual.
"You gonna need help getting into the shower?" his dark brown eyes are focused elsewhere because he's not comfortable in the aftermath of what they do.
He shook his head. "Do you want to see mine?" the boy asked quietly and unsure of himself.
"You let me worry about him." He watched the boy lick at his vanilla ice cream cone, it started to drip onto his fingers. "How about some cologne?" he asked, snapping out of it and looking ahead at the Abercrombie & Fitch store.
John mutters a string of profanities under his breath and yanks the screen door open angrily, going inside the home. The couple argue some more in hushed whispers until they notice the worried boy spying on them from around the corner of the hallway.
"Morning-" Dean mumbles, casually pulling away slowly. "Better get back before Cas finds out I'm gone." he swallows, looking over at the digital alarm clock on Jacks dresser. It was just before sunrise. "I'll call you?" His friend nods sleepily.
Dean sits down then, "Why didn't you just say that-" the look he's given has him kind of understanding his reasons. "You thought I'd steal the damn thing?" another
"Derek smiles sympathetically, handing him a few brown paper towels so he can wipe his tear streaked face. After standing up he says, "Here's some advice, don't let years go by without visiting the dentist." the teen nods and he's helped out of the chair and back to the waiting room. "We'll keep in touch, yeah?"
"Goat blood sucker-"
Bobby huffs, "I ain't gonna lie to ya because life would be easier if ya didn't love em'-"
Dean's face goes red and so does Bobby, it all feels awkward. "We brought you a cake." he says dumbly. Castiel laughs, waving them over to follow him inside. "Wow-" Dean looks around the place, everything Castiel touches turns out nice and fancy. "This looks great-" he's happy for Castiel but inside, he's just sad. He's now remodeled two houses and he doesn't even get to live in them- he feels so far away from him.
Dean swallows, "Why do you like it when I slap and choke you-"
Derek smiles, flashing those perfect teeth. "Dental hygienist, I'll be a dentist soon. What do you do, sir?"
"So, you probably will have another boyfriend then?"
They part ways while they shop - he does find a pajama set for Cas and he gets his dear uncle a little something too. After all Bobby is like a second father. Once they have their gifts they head over to the diner for a quick bite.
Castiel knew this was the most he was going to get out of him for now, he pulls into a grocery store and parks around the front since it's early in the day there aren't many cars around.
Dean shivers and Castiel holds him tighter, "Just thinking about a lot of things." He feels lips press to his temple and he closes his eyes. "I mean it, I love you."
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry okay? But I feel like shit because of Bobby."
Normally he would just do what he wanted as he always did with these twinks that popped in and out of prison in the blink of an eye but not Dean. His eyes look directly into those sad green orbs staring up at him in the darkness of the cell. That sweet innocent face, no way he could force him to do something he wasn't ready for yet.
Dean's cock hardened a bit more at his tone. "Why do you wanna see it?"
Castiel nods eagerly and Dean jumps on him, wrapping his legs around the older mans waist. "Mmmm-" he moans after getting a taste the teens sweet tasting tongue, "What did you eat-" and drops him on the neatly made bed after the short walk down the hall to his bedroom.
Dean's often wondered about this, would he stick around if they weren't
aside from just sitting there and staring at him?
Their meal is eaten in silence and Bobby keeps giving the teen the weirdest looks because he's eating breakfast with a milkshake.
Dean blinks, "Uh no you're not." His throat suddenly feels dry and he doesn't know why that is. "Do you want some water, orange juice or something?" he clears his throat, "Are you hungry?" he changes the subject, Jack follows him to the kitchen and gladly takes the juice he's given, there indoors but they still are standing feet apart. They both secretly wish they were closer than that. They had cereal for breakfast, they talk about superheros for a while and the conversation goes back to
"I understand." Meg smiles, "Maybeee-if I saw a picture of the little bugger, I would understand even more."
Dean's blinking, taking in the surroundings. "My brother-" and he sounds so distracted, so far away.
Castiel stands up abruptly, "Goodnight,Dean-" and leaves the giggling teenager to himself in his room to laugh at his
Dean smiles, typing his response.
"What is it that you won't tell anyone?" he states, "Sam. I've never done anything with Dean before-"
Castiel could adopt Dean and he wouldn't even really have to marry his father, not legally anyway. If they make it to one year together, they'd be in a common law marriage. It's not ideal but staying has it's benefits, all it would take is one year and if things got really bad after that he could leave and take Dean with him and John wouldn't be able to fight him on it.
Castiel finishes off his cigarette before getting up to get dressed in a pair of sweatpants and remains shirtless. "So, dinner?" he asks, not meeting the mechanics eyes right then.
Castiel inhaled deeply, eyes closing. “I did. I regret letting you slip away.”
Dean nods in compliance before going back to his table to sit down to wait the hour out until he can go back to the safety of his cell. So far things weren't that bad yet, this kind of reminded him of school with being in the cafeteria and all. He's looking around at all the different kind of guys around him, until his eyes land on blue eyes. The guy was sitting down with a group of guys who looked pretty damn scary.
Dean spent most days outside shooting beer cans with the rifle or helping his uncle with a car- he'd been learning a lot about cars from Bobby.
Dean comes into the dimly lit room anyway- Castiel sighs, turning the page of his boring book. "So I gotta suck your dick if I wanna sleep in here?" he says seriously. "Because I'll do it."
Castiel moves to pull the jacket back on him, "It's freezing, Dean-" his voice is loving. "Let's go inside, we can talk-" and the teen follows him indoors, into the home like a love sick puppy. When he turns around, he's almost startled by how close he was to him. "Dean, no sex. I mean it-"
Sure, his bunk mate was pretty fucking sexy for an older guy but the dude scares the shit out of him. If he really wanted to, he could probably kill him in one quick motion, maybe even in his sleep. That thought alone is enough to keep him awake half the night.
Dean moans loudly, eyebrows furrowed.
"Ughh-" Castiel arches his back in a way that makes his ass go up higher and Dean is in awe, just watching his dick go in and out of his ass. "-harder."
Castiel is startled from his thoughts, "Yea baby-" and calls back from where he's flossing in the bathroom with the door open.
He never really watched porn, but when he did he would binge watch and go through most of the categories. Castiel didn't even masturbate all that often. The guilt afterwards weighed on him too much for that.
"No friggin' way-" Dean mutters to himself.
Castiel notices, "She means you got taller." he reassures the boy, cupping the back of the boy's neck to keep him in place.
wakes up. "Mornin' sunshine-" the teen gags and turns his face away. "I'm gonna come for ya baby, promise it'll be sweet-" again, it's that prison accent that always has him melting- but the words do not.
"Don't wanna-" he says from where he was laying on the couch and sucking his thumb even though he was eleven- it was a comfort thing.
The woman smiles brightly, "He's really cute-" and winks at him for snagging himself such an adorable catch. "Like
Dean's confused, "Can't what-"
"I got out early-" he was making a few sandwiches on the kitchen counter. "Sit down-"
he's old enough to know the truth about who he was.
Only then, Bobby believes the story and who can blame him. They hid an entire illegal relationship behind his back for a long time and neither of them was fully trusted yet. Castiel doesn't stay long, only having stopped by to make sure he wouldn't be getting into trouble for the evenings unplanned mishap.
"Because- men are complicated. Things can get dangerous." His uncle sits next to him with his burnt toast and a glass of milk.
He shrugs, "The guys had polo shirts and khaki pants-"
Back at home, Dean is clinging to his stepfather for dear life and kissing every inch of his face and neck that he can get to. Castiel groans because this fucking turns him on and he's got to shove the teen away from him.
Dean goes pink in the face, "No-"
"If you don't want to see this, get out." he grits out, pulling out his cock to fuck Dean with. Sam stays, so he continues. He pulls Dean's boxers off of his still thin body before he works himself into his hole with no lube- Dean doesn't seem to care. He just moans through the pain of getting pounded raw and dry.
"Pick out some snacks will ya, don't feel like cookin' tonight." and that's music to his ears, Dean makes quick work of picking up a family size bag of chips, bean dip and several other tings. "I know I'm payin' but don't get carried away-" at the register Dean throws down the twenty he won when they played bingo. "In that case-" Bobby reaches over and grabs some snickers bars next to the register.
"Hey that's great-" they eat in silence for a while. "-did you like the clothes I got you? I took a wild guess on your sizes."
Castiel clears his throat because he's being a big baby right now, "I'm here-" sniffles. "I miss you too sweetheart-"
Robin clearly had more tasks than he did- she would take orders, bake the pies and sometimes would help out in the kitchen when one of the cooks was out for the day.
another groan escapes him. He's looking down at his stepfathers ridiculously long tongue and puffy lips devour his flesh tenderly, the view is so hot, so enticing that an orgasm is building up within him.
"Why don't ya come over for dinner? Dean's gone off with that Robin girl and some kid named Kevin that I aint' met yet-"
After polishing off the burger he picked up on the way, he's back at the house and letting himself in through the front door.
Castiel smiles brightly, showing off that great smile and those pearly white teeth. "Dean-" he mouths the name, waving him over with such excitement.
"Ah-gnn...Bet your dick isn't tired."
Dean tenses up because it's too much to take, in the sweetest way. "I feel weird-" he admits, but he doesn't know he feels exactly- something is happening and it feels different than last night. "Ughh, Cas-" his voice is laced with panic before some kind of internal orgasm hits. Hot come oozes out of his hard cock, dripping onto his flat tummy "Ughh-"
he's never off- it's a drastic change from his always cheerful ways.
"Dean-" he huffs nervously, a hand quickly lands on his thigh. "Uh-" his eyes are looking down at it sliding up his denim covered leg. "What are you-"
he promised.
He runs down the hall, seeing the teenager holding the rifle in his hand- looking out the window- "What the hell are you doing with that?"
Castiel groans, chest heaving and Dean rests his forehead against his shoulder as they both try to catch their breath. "That what you had in mind?" he asks eventually, his fingers carding lazily through the the teens short hair.
Dean pushes away his plate and starts chewing on the straw of his milkshake purely out of nerves, "Knee still bothering you Bobby?" his uncle nods and he smiles at the older man. "Sure, I'll get it done today-" it's the least he could do for the man who he wishes was his father over John freaking Winchester. "Anything else?" and he quickly regrets asking because there's a long list of chores waiting for him.
"I love you." John says surely, taking his hand and holding it in his own. Of course he didn't mean it but he had to be a good boyfriend or Castiel would leave and he didn't want that because this man was his golden goose.
Castiel stirred awake, he turned over to check the time on his phone. 5:32 in the morning.
-" swallows dryly. "Few days, max-" his lover gives him a shy smile. "Then I'll fuck you real good, yeah?-"
"Oh my-fuck." Castiel huffs out a harsh breath, "I-I can't even-" he pulls the boy up by his arms and kisses his forehead- the only inch on his face not covered in white. "You're so good for me."
They make the short drive from the diner to the market, Castiel needed help with his grocery shopping but it was just a sneaky way to spend more time with the teen since they were taking a break. Dean was just happy to be able to make money without having to go to an actual job everyday, though he knew this was his step father doing him a favor- hiring him to be his maid and errand boy.
Now his hands are going under the boys shirt to feel all of that tight flesh and it's so clear that he wants to go all the way with Tommy. From the looks of it, the feelings are mutual cause the boy on his kitchen counter is all hitched breaths and needy whimpers ever since they started kissing.
"You know you can get her pregnant, don't you?"
It's Saturday - Castiel's weekends usually began on Thursday but lately he's been working every day. When the table is set with the breakfast he just made he goes in search for him.
Dean looks up, whining "I don't know."
"Yea me too, sorta felt like- before, when he was with us still."
Dean takes a step forward until their bodies press together and strong arms wrap around his body. Secretly only loving this because he misses how much affection Castiel gives him on occasion, when he's got the time for it. He's only letting himself be seduced because he's feeling extremely needy while working through the pain of his betrayal.
The teenager sat down near a tree and leaned against it, looking up at the colorful sunset sky with watery eyes.
Dean shrugs, he's gotten used to getting hurt and abused that it doesn't phase him. If Castiel beat him up- he wouldn't care. It'd probably turn him on even though he knows it's twisted. "Looks worse that it feels."
"Dads coming?"
"If what?"
Dean shrugs, "Makes me feel funny inside-"
It's not long at all before the cartoons blaring on full blast from the living room capture his attention. As expected, the eleven year old was sitting on the floor a few feet away from the flickering television with an empty bowl of cereal next to him. He has to give him some credit, he can feet himself- even if it was just cereal.
Thank the heavens above because there was an available taxi parked right outside the bus station and they both sigh in relief before climbing in. Soon they arrive to their
"Shit-" Castiel groans in pain as he pokes underneath his bruised and bloodshot eye. John must have popped a blood vessel in his eye when he'd punched him, it was completely red except for the blue at he center. "Damn it-" he rinses his mouth with water in the sink.
"Grosssss-" Castiel groans playfully in disgust, setting his plate of eggs and the bottle of ketchup on the table for him to dig into.
When he rolls over he quickly lunges himself onto the older man, shoving his tongue into his mouth and moaning desperately. "Hmm-mmm-mmm-"
He whimpered.
"That's rough." Bobby sighs, his arms crossed at his chest. They both watch Dean for a while, Bobby gives up first and goes back inside while he stays. The day had been a breezy and sunny day until now- storm clouds were rolling by and the breeze had become a strong wind.
"Okay." he whispers, "I'm gonna finish eating then I'm gonna call Sam."
"I don't want to go back home-" Dean sits down on the rocking chair.
"Yeah-" Castiel hugs himself, "-I don't have any toys laying around that we can play with." he does have toys, but he can't really let the boy play with them. "I know it's not very kid friendly here."
Dean is tipsy but still manages to get nervous for some reason, as if it were his first time. Being with Castiel is so intimidating at times because he's a fucking
"Dean, you were perfect before. Stop-"
Dean and Bobby are halfway through breakfast when Castiel pads into the kitchen looking completely confused. Dean smiles at the picture before him and loved how the guy looked with messy hair. "Mornin' sunshine-" he drawls a little more southern than he meant to. That accent seems to show it's pretty little head every now and then, more so now after moving here.
"You ate Hot Cheetos, didn't you-" he scolds the boy on the line with him, who simply whines with guilt. His free hand begins to stroke his cock yet again without realizing it. "Alright, tell your friends mom that I'm on my way to come get you. I'll be there soon-" they hang up and his hard cock is stuffed back into his boxers.
That night he sleeps like a baby, someone was proud of him and it felt damn good. Even his uncle had been proud, he showed it by taking him to a local hunting store and letting him pick out an Air Rifle, even if it wasn't a real rifle- Bobby assured him he could still hurt someone with it if needed.
Dean looks over his shoulder and is a picture of beauty right then, his hair a mess and his lips parted slightly with desire. Castiel leans forward and spits on his target before lining up his already hard cock with the teens hole. He pushes into the familiar heat in one smooth motion since Dean was still a little loose from only a few hours ago.
Castiel grabs his keys, opening the door. "Alright, alright. We're going."
"I wasn't gonna waste a good prank just because some chick was there-" his tone is calm and cool. "Look, I'll tell him it was all my idea-" and that wouldn't make this any better because Castiel doesn't like Ash. Like at all, thinks his hair is a bad look.
"Mr. Novak, I'm sure Dean feels bad enough-Do you plan on doing it again?" Dean shakes his head, "Good, that's a start." After a few seconds she says, "I'm sorry but that's all the time we have for today but Dean, I'll see you in two weeks okay?" He nods and the three of them stand up, "We have a group that meets up weekly if you're interested-" she looks at both of them.
Castiel turned around and started pounding into the older man’s chest with his fists, “You jerk!”
"You wish he was here, don't ya-" his uncle seems to have read his mind.
Castiel sighs, his fingers brushing through Dean's hair gently as he counts all the freckles on his face for what must be the millionth time.
"Yea- you're right." he sighs, "Cas wouldn't let anyone hurt me, even my dad."
Castiel finishes getting dressed first and he does the dishes while waiting for Dean to get ready. "Dean, you ready?" he's wiping his hands on a dish towel when the boy emerges. "So you're ready-" he laughs, tossing the towel into the now empty sink.
Castiel laughs and gets up to grab his work bag from the bedroom. "No, now stop being a spoiled brat-" there's a moment of silence while looking through his things to make sure he's got everything that is needed for the day. "I didn't raise you to be like this-"
"But nothing was broken-"
Dean blinks stupidly, "I can?"
She pulls her stuffed bear into her lap, "Why are you here?"
" and isn't even trying to hide the annoyance in his voice because there's bigger problems to worry about like his boyfriend beating the shit out of him again over this very same thing. Except now, he's fucked the dancer he said he wouldn't and his world is crashing down around him.
Don’t freak out...please. Dean is in the hospital, Can I come pick you up? He asked me to come get you. He wants to see you.
Once again, Castiel got nowhere with his doctor visit except for a prescription for a refill on his anti depressants that he knows he won't be taking again. The doctor wasn't listening to him at all and unfortunately he was starting to understand what Dean might have been going through. Feeling horrible and no one being able to give him any answers. Well, not the answers he wanted to hear anyway.
"What are you-" he looks up at the teenager who now rolls him over roughly, now Castiel's ass is exposed after his boxers are pulled down and he's quickly moving to get up.
She tenses, "Dean, Please stop...I can't-" she feels his hands rubbing over her cotton panties.
Castiel wraps an arm around him and it's an easy thing to do, they're sitting next to each other in the waiting area. "Just tell her what you told me. She's not going to judge you, she's there to listen." Dean nods and right then the therapist comes to the waiting area and calls his name. "Good luck."
Castiel smiles, "Sure, Dean. Anything you eat makes me happy, I just want you to try." Dean nods. They eat chocolate in bed and talk like two small boys on Halloween night as they dig into their candy. It's refreshing to see Castiel this way- he's usually a very serious man. "I like this-" Dean runs his fingertips over the fine lines that form at the corners of his eyes when he smiles big and wide.
"You're a freak." Dean laughs, but it sounds sad.
"Eat it boy-" there's pure disgust on his face, but humor in his tone. "Don't have sex with it-"
Even though the words the two adults exchange between themselves about him is a lot nicer that was his dad used to tell his mom, It still pissed him off that Castiel would answer the phone for Bobby and not him. The excuse he's always given is that he's always busy with work. That work is
Castiel informs him on the way, about his worries, about how the last time the man had gotten upset it landed him in the hospital. Maybe nothing was wrong, but Bobby always calls and he didn't after their fight. They make it through the front door, which was left unlocked for the teen to come back home. Probably not the smartest idea, but they had no neighbors close by anyway and John Winchester wasn't lurking around to steal from them anymore.
She shrugs, "Don't worry about it-" and get's to work on the computer.
The two of them are kissing and it's hot and heavy until John says, "Get on top-" the heat seems to sizzle out a little bit on the doctors end. "You look fine, relax-" and it's stupid that he'd even be self conscious about such a thing.
"I hope she's not preg-"
"You callin' me fat boy?"
"It wasn't as pretty as you-" Castiel's eyes focus on him rather than the sky, it makes the sick teen blush under his gaze. "Dean, you've always been so pretty."
Dean smiles, "Thanks Cas-"
"Lady, you're not hearing me." Dean sits up, "I'm in love with my step dad."
Dean's eyes went wide, " I- "
Castiel stared at the man, "You're not serious."
"Poke it with a stick! Don't touch dead things with your hands!" he calls out after the boys, one of their neighbors looks at him like he's a murderer. He smiles in shame and hurries back inside.
"Ugh-" Castiel groans against his will, the sweet spot inside of him was getting jabbed every time. "Mmmugh-"
Dean nods, "Me too-" and waves goodbye with a shaky hand before ending the video call.
Castiel nods, "You're okay, Dean. I'm taking you home." Dean barely nods, he's gripping the door handle for dear life as Castiel drives him home. The man drives a mere 30 MPH but to Dean it feels like he's going more than 80. "Were here-" he looks over to the passenger side and sees Dean with his eyes squeezed shut. "It's okay-open your eyes."
He doesn't dare challenge his uncle, he has guns. "Sorry." The tears stream down his face, "He say anything else?"
Castiel's biting the skin on the side of his thumb while they watch a long video together. It was a man and a woman, fucking doggy style. He'd been so wrapped up in the video that he hadn't noticed when Dean started to jack off right next to him. "Why are you-" he gulps, watching the movements of his hand.
"What, no lunch?" he's asking Castiel, taking a seat at the table. "Mary always had food waitin' for me."
"Commissary-" his long tongue is licking the white plastic spoon. Their eyes meet, "Want some?" and the teen nods, so he shoves his index finger inside the jar to scoop up some of the brown butter. "Come here-" he shakes his head. "If you want this peanut butter you're gonna have to lick it off my fingers-"
"What did you do before you got locked up?" he asks, propped up on his elbow now.
Castiel shook his head rather violently. " You are abusive and I need to stay away from you. " He reached for the door handle. "
Dean's sitting down drinking a root beer, he'd love the real thing but his uncle Bobby counts every beer in the fridge before leaving him alone in the house. His eyes scan the many trees out back as he sips on his carbonated drink, he's looking for something- eventually standing up and going towards the woods by himself. He's never been in there alone before, sure he's gone in- but it was to wait for Castiel to meet him.
"Nggnnn-" he keens, "-daddy." the name comes out on accident and that drives his step father mad.
Castiel bites his lip softly, his eyes closing as he lets his head lean back against the cars leather headrest. Even though this just happened, his mind is recalling the feel of the boys nose brushing up against his own.
Meg doesn't look hopeful at all, she knows they are only best friends. "I know, I had only been teasing at the diner-"
Dean becomes uncomfortable but listens intensely anyway because he knows this information won't be repeated a second time. "It was more than a few times-"
"Tell me what's going on-" and that did it. It earned him that punched he was warned about. "Fuck-" Castiel groans, pinching his nose in pain, blood dripped from both nostrils. "I think you broke my nose-" he uses the end of his shirt to wipe it clean, but red keeps coming.
Dean rolls his eyes, shoveling another spoonful of ice cream into his mouth. "No one's ever home to feed me." Pink ice cream is melting at the corners of his mouth.
"Hmm-"
Castiel smiles, "I know what you need-" pressing a kiss to his ear, "But not tonight, you're not ready."
Castiel's phone starts ringing loudly in the kitchen, "Shit!" he peels Dean off once again and runs for it, answering the call "Hello?"
"He's not gonna find out-" Dean grabs his boots because he doesn't have time to lace them up, Castiel's already fumbling to open the motel door.
"Love you-" Castiel gives him a peck on the forehead before pulling out slowly and falling next to him on the bed. "How was that?" he asks breathlessly. Dean nods, catching his breath. "It wasn't really hate sex but-"
The last text from Sam had been about his house getting broken into by John, his father. Dean never did tell him that his father had passed, maybe he should have but why would he even care? He's feeling extremely disconnected from the world, had been for so long, ever since his
Dean shivers, "Ugh"- and moans beautifully. The whole time the cock is grinding into his ass, he's got his eyes closed with his head bobbing back and forth. "Ugh-"
" Dean no. What are you tryi- Stop. " Castiel looked up at Dean, who was now re-positioning himself above him and without consent he pulled off the boy's short's. Spreading
Castiel nods because he already knew this but just how much trouble the teens uncle was in was a mystery. "So you give him the money I give you?"
When he returns to his soon to be husband, he still can't get more than a couple feet into the courtroom before freezing. Castiel notices his presence instantly, frowning at the sight of him not approaching yet again.
"That bad huh?" Bobby walks through the screen door, Castiel was sitting on the rocking chair- keeping an eye on the teen.
Unfortunately Meg wasn't working that night, so he couldn't get the hook up and had to wait just like everyone else until another friend of his spotted him in the waiting area and quickly rushed him inside into one of the ER rooms.
"Ale-" he tries to speak but the dancers tongue is shoved into his mouth. "Mmm-"
but it wasn't. It was real and he had to deal with it.
Dean shoves him again. "Bitch."
"That's right, you just put people to sleep before surgery-"
"I can't hear you." Castiel husks into his ear- making him flinch. "I know my little girl is louder than that-"
Knowing that he can be a brat.
Everything was going as well as it possibly could given recent events, that's until Castiel's phone keeps buzzing with messages from Meg, which John thinks are from the stripper his boyfriend has been seeing.
"Well...I told Sammy here-" he patted Sam's thigh," All about you and he was sad for me. He hadn't seen me happy since you left. Cas if I was more of a man I would have found a way to have you stay, or go with you. I let money separate us and I didn't feel worthy of you at the time. Sam said I had to be selfish and chase what I wanted for once instead of always worrying about his needs, that I had to take care of my own. "
12:03 a.m
"Okay." Castiel rubs his back up and down, "Let's get you into bed-sure Bobby won't care if I sleep with you again."
"Yeah, why don't we go get one-" Castiel waves him over to the door with his car keys in hand, not wanting to spend another minute in the house.
They make eye contact and Alex tears up because he's developing some serious feelings for this man. "Please stay with me, just a few more minutes-"
"What's wrong-" his voice is full of concern and he's got an arm wrapped around the boy who is sitting on his lap. "Tell me what's wrong-" he unintentionally bounces the boy on his lap.
"No Dean, of course not." he smiles, sitting on the edge of his desk. "I wanted to ask you if you would join our all boys choir-"
card. Castiel swiped the card and waited for the amount to be approved.
If his father could have seen him a few months back, when he was so sick and weak. There's no doubt in his mind that John would have beat his ass, absolutely no doubt. It was almost sinful to have any kind of emotion while growing up, but it didn't stop him from showing them and he got a harsh hand to his backside many times for it. Dean sighs heavily, thinking about his father, really thinking about him for the first time in a long while.
"Good boy-" that was a test and he passed. "I'll see about getting something we can use as lube so it won't hurt so bad-" after one final kiss, "Let's get back before we get busted-" and helps the teen up onto his feet.
The nurse must have left an hour after taking the conversation outside to the front porch where they were sure to be safe away from listening ears. Meg stayed almost the entire day and left as the sun was starting to go down in the horizon. Castiel walked her to her car and kissed her cheek before watching his friend drive away until her car rounded the corner of the street.
from the strip club.
A few hours later Dean stirs against the body pressed against him, he moans softly, his arm tightening around the warm body next to him. He knows it feels different than what he's used to.
Their eyes meet and he can't be bothered to reject the man. "Of course." he agrees to the invitation before standing up. "I don't want to see you back here, no one in the hospital wants to care for you because of what you did to one of the nurses. I'm an Anesthesiologist, I shouldn't be in the ER taking care of some drunk-" he spits out before pulling back the curtain to leave.
Dean looks at him in the eye, "I promise I wont tell."
Dean’s head rose from the pillow just high enough to see who it was. “ It’s you. “ His voice cracked.
Dean's had stubble before, but it was pretty sparse and took forever to grow. Now the stubble came in after three days of shaving his face, it was a big change and it let him now that he's growing up. "You like it?"
Castiel laughs, fixing his dark blue tie. "I assume that I don't have to tell you not to mention us-" he reminds the teen while they walk towards his car.
"Yea- but I like it here." Dean looks up at him, "Do you think we could stay?"
"You don't have to choose, look-" he points to a sign above the display. "Buy one jacket, get the second half off-" that makes the boy smile because now he's getting two jackets. "Come on-" he grabs both jackets and they head for the register at the front.
"Sounds great." Castiel lies, toasting to their trip the following weekend. There's nothing more he'd love than to go back to the beach with Dean but this time he'll be off limits thanks to his uncle. "Can't wait-" They converse for a while longer, the beer bottles were now empty and Bobby had dozed off in his lawn chair. He looked over through the window and Dean's still sitting there nursing the same mug.
"I want a happy pumpkin-" Dean says somberly and Castiel agrees.
Dean barks a laugh- "Fuck that's just so funny- I'd love to see that. Think he gets a stiffy when she does his toes?"
Dean nods and he lingers about until Castiel's expectant gaze has him asking, "Oh you mean now-" he nods. "-right, I'll go tell him." and he's off back home.
The next page read-
Castiel rubs his back for a while but Dean doesn't get sick- the feeling passes and his stomach stops churning. "I'll go get you some sprite. I saw some in the fridge." Dean meets him in the kitchen and takes the clear bubbly soda.
"Yeah-" he says somberly, both men exiting the place at the same time. "What are you-" suddenly he's being pulled towards the back of the bar and slammed against the cold building. It's freezing and Castiel hugs himself, his jacket was doing nothing to keep him warm.
Castiel nods, crossing his arms at his chest. "Good, glad to hear that buddy."
"That all?" Derek laughs, "Don't you want a burger or something-" the look of worry on the teens face has him wondering. "Don't you eat?" the curiosity is peeked because now that he thinks about it the teen didn't eat much at the diner.
"Sorry-" Dean whispers again, "Guess I don't know the difference. You know, growing up around violence-" he shrugs, "You get used to it, think it's normal-"
"What baby, what is it? Talk to me-" he holds the boys shoulders, looking into his eyes for signs of pain or something wrong.
Dean thinks that it won't be a big deal if he just pours a little bit of water into the bottle and he shakes it a bit before putting it back in it's hiding place. "Aghh-" he whines again, "Fucking-" he catches himself mid curse and goes to sit at the table with his head in his hands.
fantasy to go down, but
"I know." she looks around, "Speaking of Dean, where is he?"
Sure his brother was well on his way to a successful career as a lawyer. He was in college, no time at all for Dean now. Sam even met a girl, Jessica was her name. They had been together almost 5 months now. Dean never kept a girl that long...he wondered how his brother did it.
"Sorry Bobby." They say in unison. Dean starts chowing down on his pie and ice cream, "Cas-" They make eye contact. "I have therapy tomorrow-"
"Hi, it's Dean-"
"You won't regret it." He stabs the steak in front of him with his fork, "Go on, eat- spent almost two hours on dinner." Castiel doesn't believe that, the potatoes are from a box and he recognized the taste since he ate them all the time himself. As for the steak, it was barely cooked at all- the inside was still pink and frozen.
Castiel laughed softly through his tears. “Yeah.”
When they unload him at the hospital, everyone there is wearing masks and gowns- making him feel more on edge. "I'm scared-" he says quietly to the paramedic, who thankfully stays for a few minutes while a nurse draws his blood. They do a chest x-ray on him, he was never told the results so he assumes that the results came back normal. The same nurse comes back and asks him to repeat his symptoms, he'd already told the paramedic but he repeats them anyway.
Castiel crosses his arms at his chest. "Those are condoms, Dean."
"Then why are you moaning-" Castiel keeps slamming into him, finding that sweet spot by accident and Dean's eyes go back in his head.
The older man pulls into the malls parking lot finally, "Feel like a new comic, Dean?" his eyes are looking into the rear view mirror and he nods in excitement. "Cas, you gonna behave?"
“Not one bit. You fell for him, I understand the hurt.”
His father stands up, coming close to his son. "You wanna mouth off to be boy? Go ahead, I'll beat you so good you'll be crying for the next two years while you're locked up where your ass should be." the teen looks up at his father, blinking in fear. "How far do you think all your crying will get you?"
"Please don't-" Dean begs softly, knowing it won't make a difference when his father crawls into bed with him. "-I don't like it." Rough lips and hands are all over him and he bites really hard on his bottom lip. He didn't like the way his father touched his body under the covers, it was mostly kissing and rubbing but it still hurt.
The next thing he sees is red flashing lights and he's freezing, probably outside getting wheeled into an ambulance. They take him to the hospital in town and he's not the happiest or most compliant patient.
Dean sat between Sam and Castiel on the couch, facing the love of his life. "I know I did...I wasn't going to find you, I wanted to let you live your life and I dunno-" he rubbed at his eyes. "Thought maybe you ended up hating me since you didn't come back to find me either."
"Excuse me, I didn't hear you-" he already looks pissed, like he already knows what he means but wants him to say it anyway.
Castiel visibly relaxes, "I was worried about you-" and ignores the question because he doesn't know where his father is.
Castiel nods, "I understand but-" there's a pause. "This changes things, I can help you pursue that-"
The teacher is passing out small plates of cookies and kool aid, he declines but he's forced into taking the refreshments anyway. He stays among the circle of preppy teens until he sees Castiel by the door.
"Not now-" Castiel spanks Dean's bubble butt loudly in the shower, causing him to whimper. "I'm in a rush. Finish up in here while I get ready to go." he gives one last kiss to the back of the boys wet shoulder.
who you really have the hots for." Dean looks confused and she looks over at Cas. "I'm not an idiot."
"I'm not. Can I taste yours?" Castiel asks, in a way that almost makes him sound like a teenager himself.
"Nothing's going to happen just cause you miss a few days here and there-" Dean reassures him, "-the hospital will always be there." what he says next surprises Castiel greatly, "Don't take your life for granted Cas- if you get a day off, even if it's because you're sick or because of the weather, enjoy it and spend it with your family." Castiel looks at him, "Me, dumb ass- I'm your family."
The teen shakes his head because he's so eager to please, "No-" and his knees go up to his chest now, which completely changes the game. "
Dean lets himself be pulled out of bed and is helped into some jeans and a sweater while his eyes are still half closed. Though when they stop by McDonald's for breakfast, he quickly perks up and digs into his food right there in the car on their way to the library. Perhaps he ate a little too fast, because by the time they get to the libraries parking lot his stomach begins to feel funny.
The teen steps out of the warmth of the car and runs back to Bobby's, luckily the man never knew where he'd gone off too. The guilt over going against his uncles wishes is something that he's willingly choosing to overlook in order to be with Castiel every now and then. Because what could it
Dean was already dressed in something comfortable but warm so they head out instantly and he sleeps the entire ride to the hospital. When they finally arrive, Castiel guides Dean into the large building and into an empty ER room.
"James Novak?" one of the two offices says.
"I love you." Dean whispers breathlessly as Castiel kisses and licks at his neck.
"Just like that. You trust him?" They keep walking.
Dean looks pained, "Why?"
"Fuck, Dean-" he groans, leaning back onto the headboard for support.
As soon as they walk outside of the school Dean spits out blood again and whines, "Yea-"
Dean blinks away the sweat threatening to roll into his eyes from his forehead, "Such a fucking slut for me aren't ya Cas-" and the man loses it, instantly getting up and man handling the teen where he just was on the bed. He yelps, "The fuck-" because his step father is climbing on top of him and begins to ride him. "Ugh, Cas-" his eyes roll back in his head for a few seconds as he gets used to this new position.
"Please." Castiel begs,"I'm not trying to be an asshole...Just know that I do love you. I'm trying to protect you."
Castiel nods after being pensive for a moment too long, "Mhm-"
Dean gulps but the second he feels something hard pressing against his abdomen, a smile appears on his angelic face.
time with a friend for the first time in what feels like forever.
Dean frowns, "Don't tell me you're still pissed?" the man looks down at the bags in his hands. "I never called you a-
"Go ahead-" he pushes the basket of wings to the center of the table because John kept eyeing them. "So tell me, what do you do for a living?"
"Cas-" he sighs sleepily and makes his way to the kitchen. "What are you doin' here-" he's hugging himself again, still in the same clothes he wore yesterday- he hadn't showered or changed into pajamas when he'd gone to bed.
"I actually really do need your help, It's like I have time to do anything. Besides, you already cut the grass around here- you shouldn't do it for free."
"Yes, baby- come here." it's so smooth, he melts. "Daddy wants to love you-"
"Sorry." Dean looks down at his sneakers. "He has a date-"
Castiel smiles at him when their eyes meet, allowing this to go on because he trusts his love completely now. Dean is gracious for this because this was nice, being with his friends like this with not an ounce of jealousy from the man he loves.
"I was sort of hoping to see him." he admits, though he doesn't know why he is anxious to see the boy again.
The two teens make themselves comfortable on the bed for the next few hours and manage to fall asleep together. It's purely innocent and Dean stays with her for a long time, though most of the time had been spent sleeping. It's not until Metallica blares loudly in the quiet bedroom that they both startle and Dean looks at the missed call on his phone.
Castiel refuses to get in the middle of whatever this is because it's no secret that they've been getting closer. John has noticed it and has been jealous about it, thinking his own son loves his
Castiel walks back to his car and drives home. He shouldn't have ever kissed the guy, he ends up kicking himself internally about it for hours.
"Boyfriend." Dean shivers as he says the word. "They were boyfriends."
Meg nods, "I'll go get him."
Castiel couldn't be like his father, the guy must be a loving dad and husband. Somehow thinking about his wife and kid make him sad, so he pushes thoughts about his family to the back of his mind, pretending he doesn't have one. On the long walk to the library, Dean looks up at the taller man beside him and admires how nice his hair looked and how clean he smelled.
"Why don't you grab a few of those-" he gestures to the poster boards, "I'm sure this won't be the last project you'll need to do this year." and he does, he grabs at least four of them to keep in his room, just in case. "Let me get a few things we need for the house-"
yet it doesn't sound-"
Castiel keeps quiet, he didn't see him spinning in circles. He didn't see anything.
Aside from everything that has happened the last couple of days and the cherry mess on his kitchen floor, he slept quite well.
"That it?" Dean says, looking around for anything they may have missed. They're cart is almost overflowing. Castiel nods and they make their way to the check out line. "I'm gonna go to the bathroom-" Castiel nods again, he was reading a magazine he picked up so he wasn't paying attention. It's not long before his phone pings with a text. It's from Dean and all it says is,
"Tell me about that, please." Castiel asks, "I need to know."
The man waved at him then blew him a kiss. Castiel waved back and did the same.
His uncle glares at him- "Even if you were a unicorn with devil horns, I wouldn't shoot ya. Now come on- keep walkin'!"
"It's a school night." Both boys roll their eyes, "Okay. Sam, can I call your mom? See if shes okay with it."
Castiel laughs, "I know baby-" and kisses the teens soft lips quickly. "I know you do-"
Dean blinks, "I-I feel drunk." he flinches really hard and shuts his eyes, "I feel like I'm falling-"
"You're a big boy, you can do it by yourself." Castiel smiled, nudging the boy's arm with his foot.
"I myself am really lovin' it here-" Bobby says, grabbing a flat stone that was near his chair on the earth and tosses it into the lake- they watch it skip a few times before it sinks into the black abyss. "Always been an outdoor kinda guy-"
They're making out like teenagers until someone bangs on the door saying, "We're closing!"
"Right." Dean smiles. "I'll let you finish painting my room-" he pauses. "Pink." Castiel laughs and they hang up. Bobby comes into his room a while later while he's on his laptop, tells him he'll be gone for a few hours. He gives his uncle a thumbs up before he leaves. A few hours go by and his uncle isn't home yet, it makes him restless so he goes to Castiel's room to snoop around because he's that bored and he wouldn't dare snoop around his uncles room- he's probably got cameras in there. He's one paranoid fella.
"I'm not proposing just yet so you can relax-" Dean sighs in relief, he's not ready for
Castiel wipes down his chest with the shirt he had taken off once he got too hot while cutting the grass. Dean looks, chewing his cereal slowly now that hes distracted. Castiel doesn't seem to act different or notice he's being watched. Maybe he's pretending. Castiel has kept his distance since he told him what happened in the past with his dad. "I'm going to take a shower." Castiel says, walking away from Dean.
Dean quickly kisses him-surprising them both. "If you were hurting me I would have told you Cas. But It felt good, really good-"
Dean's stomach instantly felt better the second the walked out of that house, now all he's dreading is having to face his uncle and his step father since he hadn't been home for hours. As Bobby's house is getting closer and closer, the cellphone in his pocket is making him painfully aware of the many missed phones.
Dean almost choked on the last bite of his hamburger. Almost. “Can you.” he whispered under his breath. Eyes lifting to find Benny’s.
"Cool." Dean smiles.
"He doesn't have money to buy me stuff this year-" he admits, covering his face with the blanket. Castiel's heart wants to break instantly and wishes he could help but instead he just tucks the boy in and leaves the room. He knows it's none of his business but he can't help but feel sorry for the boy.
Castiel looked up, the morning sun blinding him a little. Dean glowed in pure innocence behind the rays of light. “Oh.”
Castiel gulped, "I did promise. Yeah, alright-" he tries to move but the teenager corners him in against the edge of kitchen table, "Here?"
Bobby sits on the edge of his bed, "Not possible bud-" and he keeps the teen company for a while until he's calmed down, that's when he gets up to go back to bed.
The man closed his eye's at the sound of his name. " Someone has to show you how to be a man- I mean show you car thing's, as you call it. "
Dean moans again, climbing on the bed anxiously once he's stripped his clothes and starts off with the man's thighs first. He laps at the still cold and white creamy liquid all over his skin. Every time he licks, he makes a sucking sound because that's what hes doing to the older man's skin. He gets carried away, basically french kissing every inch of the man's body that is covered in that sticky sweetness. Dean couldn't help but this that if come tasted this good, he'd swallow it.
Tonight is no different than previous nights and they are laid up in bed with their dog wedged between them. It's beyond amazing to be laid up like this together but Castiel still wishes they had already gotten married and were moving on to bigger things but his boyfriend is young so extra patience is needed.
Dean quickly spots him after a nurse points him out and damn it all, it looked like the man had stayed up all night long crying his eyes out. They looked so pink and puffy, even from behind those dumb nerd glasses.
Dean nodded silently. Half an hour later they stood outside Castiels door, "This is it." Dean asked, not expecting an answer. Castiel nodded then smiled after a minute "Maybe we got off on the wrong foot." They searched eachothers eyes. Green and blue.
That pisses him off and he's being forced to roll over, his face shoved into the pillow. "Stop-" his muffled plea is barely audible. John pulls down his boxers and rubs saliva against his hole, before pushing in without any prep- not caring to help him along. "Stop-" he begs again, struggling against he man holding him down but getting free was hard to do with his hands being held behind his back.
"What are you feeling-" his words are practically said into the boys ear, making him shiver. "Is it your tummy-" his hand rests on his belly a little possessively.
Everything is fine until they sit down for the movie and see nothing but babies, parents and kids all around them. Great, this is going to be so much fun for Castiel-
The man shakes his head, "Nah. Gotta come back-" and his eyes check the teen out a little too long. "Where's your dad?"
relationship with his step father- he would never disclose that information. At least not until he was of age, just a few more months. As far as she knew, Castiel was just guy who took care of him- a guy who had taken him in as his own.
Dean sighs, finally Castiel kissed him like he loved him. "Love you too-" he wants to move in closer but he hears a bedroom door open down the hall so he plays it cool.
"I've been proud of you." Bobby pats him on the shoulder before heading to his room for the night. Dean looks at the kitchen table- he was hungry but decided to leave the plate left out for him untouched. As sick as it sounds- he kind of missed feeling
He smiles, putting away his tooth brush. "Yea- that'd be nice." Castiel wraps his arms around him and kisses him softly- "What was that for?"
Castiel smiles, "Pack what exactly?" he looks over to the three boxes that lay on the floor by the door. "I don't have much here, remember?" he looks around the vast emptiness of the home, "I'm gonna need to buy some furniture, and a bed- just about everything." he resumes sweeping.
"Calm down-" he kisses the boy's face repeatedly until he's calm, it takes about a minute and tears are spilling onto his slimmer cheeks. "Why do you think you're chubby?" he gives him a once over, looking him down and seeing nothing. "You've never been chubby, Dean. What are you talking about?"
"All his cop buddies think he did it."
Castiel looks up, through his glasses at the teenager. He looked extra cute today in jeans and a grey shirt that hugged his body the right way. His blue eyes quickly scan the boy before him up and down in a nano second. Resisting the urge to fuck him right then and there but he stands up instead, "Yeah, follow me-"
Dean nods, his chubby fingers holding his half of the scone. He sniffles again, looking for something to wipe his nose on.
Dean drives with full confidence now because he's got somebody to follow back home. Driving out here on a whim was pretty stupid, but at least he knew where his friend lived and hopefully wouldn't get lost next time. When they reach the old dirt road that leads them home, they part ways when Castiel reaches his house first and Dean keeps going a few more yards.
"With a girl?"
Dean punches him lightly in the arm, "Stupid-" he says with a silly smile.
"Your eye looks cool-" Dean mentions suddenly,"You look like a monster."
"You look exhausted baby-" Meg smiles up at him from her chair, "Relax, I'll give you a massage."
"It had nothing to do with you-" he blurts out, loud enough to prove his point but quiet enough so that no one else could hear. "I wanted to go through with it-" he looks down at his half eaten breakfast. "I felt real anxious or whatever-" blinks away tears. "I didn't feel good, that's all-" looks up to meet icy blue eyes.
Castiel shrugs, "I got matched for residency here, Anesthesiology." he sips his coffee, "After my residency-" he pauses. "I just never left-"
Dean makes a sound that he's never heard before but that's all he wants to hear, for the rest of his life. His teeth sink a bit deeper, of course being mindful that he's just a child so he would never really hurt him.
Dean's a bit hurt by that admission, "He said that?" but it's not like his dad took him anywhere to begin with so It wasn't his fault he didn't get out much.
"Yea-I remember." Dean sits up, taking a sip from his milkshake to wash down the fry he almost lost his life over.
wasn't always like this, there's no way he came into their lives just to prey on John Winchesters underage son. His first initial interest had been his father, and he just had to leave
"No, it's not that." Castiel blows on his soup, "I feel it in my body, I feel heavy and tired-emotionally I'm fine." and he's in denial yet again. The doctor told him that depression doesn't always feel like a sad feeling that lingers for a long time.
Castiel smiles, looking at Dean's hole twitching and glistening with his saliva. Without thinking he brushes his thumb over the twitching hole, Dean's whole body buckles for a second as if asking for it. "May I?" he asks, Dean opens his eyes to look, he nods. Castiel licks his thumb, then presses it gently over the boys hole. He's so surprised when the whole actually allows entry. "Fuck, Dean."
for him,
Bobby puts down his beer on the ground, "I asked- he said he didn't know anything. Asked about Gordon too, they're still lookin'- everyone thinks he ran off to mexico." Dean nods, at least one of the bad guy's is gone. "Not to worry, he doesn't know where ya live. Even if he did, that's why we got guns-" he nods again.
"The guy threw money at me and left-I laid there for a while. I couldn't get up- the guy hit me too." His knee starts bouncing under the table anxiously, "Everything hurt. Still does-"
Dean glances up from the playboy that he never bothered to hide, "Just friggin' anxious-" and it felt so weird to be honest for once about how he was feeling. Suddenly he sits up, "I need a cigarette-" and the older man stops him from getting up.
The next day Bobby catches a glimpse of the love bites on his neck, he doesn't confront Dean- Instead he asks Castiel about it when Dean goes outside to work on a car.
As promised, Castiel comes back with his discharge papers right at five on the dot. "What's that for?" Dean asks as he dresses into new clothes- Castiel had a large plastic zip lock bag with the hospitals logo, inside were things for an at home IV set up.
Dean suddenly has a worried expression on his gentle face, "What if Dad gets mad-"
Castiel hopes he's kidding because he doesn't want his
Castiel thinks about it, "I have no idea what kids do." he admits honestly as he puts everything away either in the fridge or in the kitchen cabinets.
Soon, he's tucked into bed and he's looking up at the man in wonder once again. "-can you read to me?" and he points to his backpack that was hanging off the chair in his room. "-my book is in there."
Castiel stands too, "Do you need a ride?"
"What's a milf?" he questions suddenly, head tilted slightly to the side.
Bobby wipes his forehead on his sleeve, asking- "You wanna get in the truck, go look for him?" But before they make it down the porch steps they see Dean- walking up the dirt road. They wait for him to pass the fence before shouting- "Where were you?!"
Castiel looks down at his watch for the time, "Take a shower and call Bobby, check on him for me-" then exits the room. "And clean the fucking house while I'm gone!" his voice calls out from down the hall before the front door slams gently behind him.
Castiel wipes the saltiness of John's kiss from his mouth with the back of his hand, "You- I hate you and Dean hates you too." John laughs, shoving his sudden windfall in the breast pocket of his hospital gown. "If we see you again, I'll kill you- and If I don't, Dean will."
"What are they for?" Dean puts his hand on it, over his shorts.
Dean sighs, taking his cereal to his room before Castiel speaks up- "Can I bring you coffee in the morning? I have the whole weekend off."
Castiel blushed. “Go on.” he sat up on the couch, pulling his legs under him as if he was a kid sitting down for storytime in kindergarden. “Spill the dark secrets that makes Dean Winchester, Dean Winchester.” he said in his best scary voice.
