“I'll get you another one. A better one.” Suddenly, Sherlock scrambles stiffly to his feet, his face distorting in pain as he moves.
spread out in front of his naked chest.
They quickly get dressed and make their way downstairs into the kitchen. Sherlock is wearing a pair of his old skinny jeans, but as the longsleeves are just a bit too short in the arms and at the waist, exposing a sliver of pale skin, he's chosen the hoodie again instead, looking skinny and lost in the oversized garment hanging loosely from his light frame.
“I see what you mean, Doctor Watson. He still has a lot to learn. Listen, pretty boy, it's not you who'll get sucked off. Kate, take your place.”
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock didn't relent with the eye contact and John avoided it by glancing down at Sherlock’s hands, feeling a change in the tone of the conversation despite his rambling. His skin tingled and he tried hard to push away the explicit thoughts from earlier, the ones involving those cool fingers that had brushed his own on the day of their first encounter, involved them caressing his...
“Because you don't need to know everything about me and because it's
He exhales, and it's not quite a laugh, but is close enough that a tingle of pride threatens to colour my cheeks.
"What is the matter?" the dark haired man inquired, after John was silent for a few moments.
“I’m thinking.”
care. Now here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to go down to the medical lab and find the first aid room at the back. You will go in there and wait for me and I’ll be there in a few minutes,” John whispered in a gravelly voice, rough with arousal.
… don’t make me do this, Sherlock.”
Sherlock grunts again, this time in frustration. Clear precome is leaking from the slit in the metal covering his trapped cock. His testicles look painfully swollen and almost purple but there's no chance for release or for his shaft to escape its confinement. It must be agonising, John thinks, sliding in and out of Sherlock's wet, docile mouth. It feels delicious.
As Sherlock's tongue presses into the boys arsehole again, it twitches a little. “Easy.” Acri says, and then, to John: “Quite the comewhore you have there. Come on, give it to him.” Sherlock groans as come spurts form the boys arse directly into his mouth. He pulls back a little so John and Acri can watch.
“Those are my pets. They don't have names, just call them whatever you like.” Acri grins proudly. All men are tall, well built, hairless, with huge cocks in different states of arousal kept in cock rings. Their eyes are obediently cast to the floor. “They do anything I want.”
“Oh, Sherlock? I also want the shirt off by the time I get there.” Sherlock flushed pink.
"John?"
"So you've never had anyone then?" Sherlock glanced at John, causing him to quickly rephrase the sentence. "I mean, you've never met the right one? Your soulmate, I mean."
“It’s on your exercise books,” Sherlock said, the corner of his mouth hitching up, and John chuckled.
“Hello. What is it you need?” The man was more striking than John could have imagined and the only answer to the question he could think of was 'you'. Instead, he smiled and gestured to the shelves.
to keep beside the phone. After uncovering the paper and tracing his finger across a lined page, he made a mental note to reprimand her again for her inability to do simple tasks. He eventually found the appointment scrawled in a blot of purple ink at the back.
Sherlock drew his wallet from his coat pocket, not noticing the solemn look on John’s face, and glanced at the menu board.
"My second, preferred name. But my mother only ever calls me Billy." Sherlock smiled, his expression faltering as his fingers intertwined experimentally with John's.
“I’m sorry, I tried to stop you from-”
“Strange but nice.” Sherlock flushed slightly and dropped his gaze.
“Look. It’s difficult. It's fucking difficult, but things are… you don't understand. I can’t.” He trails off, struggling to find words or come to terms with what has been on the brink of being granted freedom for months, almost years. Finally, instead of freedom, he cages us for the last time; “You know we left it too late.”
“Not at all, only fifteen minutes or so.” John cringed, guilty he'd made him wait.
“Hey again, is there something you wanted me for?” John asked, a sudden awkwardness causing paralysis.
“A textbook.” A statement, not a question.
“It’s only a creased collar, John.” The response feels like a wall placed between the two of us and a boundary demolished at the same time. I allow myself a second to meet his gaze and immediately regret my decision. His dark eyes, grey in the dying firelight, pierce me. They are sad, they are apologetic, and they do not look at me in the same way I look at him; they are without hope.
"Oh just Sherlock, please. You are about to shove a needle into my wrist after all. No need to be so formal." The stranger had an intense gaze, one that made John feel as if every inch of his person was being scrutinised. He nodded as he walked to a chair, gesturing for his client to sit before him.
“I don’t need to
“Oh it's fine, I usually come here alone anyway. They're used to seeing me by myself,” Sherlock told John in what sounded like a reassuring tone, but it made him sad to hear. He thought of Sherlock sitting in the corner people-watching, making deductions about customer’s relationships, all without having someone there to tell them to, and wrinkled his brow.
'John' in the perfect stranger's mouth sounded so right, causing the artist's breath to hitch as he watched the letters form on the man's lips. Although the bitter tone behind it sent disappointment creeping over John's chest. "I've met many Johns in my life, several Jonathans. Even a rather... insistent Joanna." Sherlock rolled his eyes and John felt himself fall a little deeper, despite the sadness crawling across his skin.
“Sherlock, I want to know.”
“I want to do what you did to
“A lack of care?” Questions are never a good sign with John Watson, they are how I know he is pissed. Pissed or confused or bewildered, or any emotion that does not bode well for the coming minutes.
“I know you did, that’s why I kept on going,” John told him in a voice that was croakier than he’d expected. He grinned and hushed Sherlock’s concerns by pressing his own lips hard against his mouth and realised how different this version of Sherlock was from the strange library attendant he’d first seen.  The kiss was wet and Sherlock was trembling beneath him, his thin frame writhing against John’s body with the aftershocks of orgasm.
“Mrs. Hudson!” He called as he reached the last few steps. “This is your front door, answer it!”
"Simple; I deduced it. Now about my tattoo," Sherlock continued so insistently that John dropped any further questions.
Thoughts of the tall, curly-haired man from the library tortured John's mind for the rest of the week. In his lecture halls he saw the attendant’s profile in those of his classmates and he saw man’s dark hair in every other brunette from the corner of his eye. It drove him mad. Never in his life had he been the romantic type but there he was thinking about this perfect stranger, who he knew nothing about, but who knew John’s name, career trajectory and probably countless other things not mentioned.
“I couldn’t ask you, you weren’t there when I came.”
“Indicative of what?” He asks me, tone less carefree than it was before; interest or suspicion, I cannot tell. The glimmer of something else fades.
“No!” Sherlock called. “Please don’t,” he said, softer.
“Any time, John,” the stranger called back, leaving John to wonder how the man knew his name.
“I... better leave you to it. I should go an-”
, thought John as he watched Sherlock sigh and tuck clasped hands under his chin.
“It merely suggests a lack of care. That is all.”
“I love you, John,” Sherlock whispered against John’s cheek, tracing the bone with the tip of his thumb as he spoke.
“Oh, they came then.” John smiled, remembering the ‘lessons' Sherlock had given him. He had read an entire book about flower language aloud. Not quite a lesson in botany but John would accept it as one if Sherlock said it was so.
“Mm, not said it before because your ego is already big enough.” He takes another sip of alcohol. “But you make me laugh.” He shuts his eyes, grin still on his face, whiskey still in hand, and I inhale slowly to detach myself. My cheeks can redden if they wish but I will not allow my heart to race or my pulse to quicken; I promised myself.
“Nothing if it’s in here.”
"William." He flexed his fingers and stood up, moving towards the tattoo machine in the corner where the latex gloves and alcohol rub were kept. "I've met a few but none were right in the end. Turns out they all had someone else's name on
“May I sit?” They were on the same page, which John found to be a relief, so he nodded a yes and kicked the chair lightly, eyes flicking over Sherlock's figure as he pulled out the chair the rest of the way and sat beside him.
“Please, John,” he whispered, guiding John’s rough hands down to his erection. John took in the sight before him—Sherlock on his back, chest heaving and hard cock pressed against his stomach, and felt like orgasming there and then. Instead, he ducked his head down and used something he knew to be much better than his hands.
,” Sherlock hummed, sitting up on his knees and pushing John onto his back.
“We b-... Sherlock. I care. She cares. We both...
“My clothing?”
A knock on the door to 221B startled Sherlock from his thoughts. He clenched his jaw in frustration, ignored the sound, and continued rearranging his test tube rack.
“Tell me what to do,” he asked quietly and John considered that Sherlock might actually be a virgin and felt a pang of guilt that this man’s first experience was in a first aid cupboard at the back of a University medical room. However, these thoughts soon faded when teeth scraped against his jaw and hot lips sucked on his neck, bruising the sensitive skin.
John smiled and pocketed his phone, tapping his fingers on the desk in his room. It was silly to grin like a lovestruck teenager but the idea that a beautiful man had asked him out for coffee, after only one hour of talking, felt nice—like something from a novel. How very fitting, he thought, to be living in a real life romance plot whilst dating an almost-librarian.
It was two days later that John received a text.
a date at all. John was pulled from his thoughts as he focused on an elderly couple holding hands... three ladies laughing in the corner... two children fighting under a table and...
"Well, what do you think you'd like? Surely you must have some idea what tattoo you want, this appointment has been booked for two weeks," John scoffed and Sherlock smiled, the expression touching his eyes. John felt the faint beginnings of a flutter in his chest but repressed it; he was a professional and must focus, he told himself. Besides, there was absolutely no point taking too much notice of the way the other man's eyes held so many different shades of blue.
John stands carefully, finding a balance I don’t think my shaking legs could replicate if I did the same, and my eyes drop to the embers in the grate between our chairs. A warm hand hovers close to my face and I don’t react. I mustn’t.
“And I love you. More than you know. Now, let me see what you managed to conjure up to use as a vase for those poor carnations.”
"I suppose you are right. And I do find myself resenting it significantly less at this moment, I should like to keep it for now - but my appointment is surely going to waste." John opened his mouth to protest, to say finding each other and having a chance at love was not a waste, but was interrupted once more.
John pulled his coat collar up against the wind, shielding his face from the icy rain. He jogged towards the library, a bag of textbooks pressing on his back, and cursed Britain for its less than temperate climate. The library doors opened and he was welcomed by a familiar warmth, a dry heat that burned against his face in the best way possible. While removing his coat the heater blasted droplets from his hair and sent them trickling down his face; he wiped them away with the sleeve of his jumper.
He found that distraction in the form of a library attendant; a tall, dark-haired man dressed in expensive looking clothing and looking much too bored to be there. The stranger was facing the shelves but John could tell he was about the same age as him, and also rather beautiful. Biting the bullet, he cleared his throat and put on his best flirting voice.
“Of course you can,” he replied with a wink. As John sat, Sherlock intertwined their fingers and both of them thought about how happy they were and how lucky they were to have met. They proceeded to talk about everything and anything; from bees and books, to their futures and music. They even touched upon who gave the best blowjobs.
Except he never really left, did he? John never leaves completely. Sprawled less than a metre in front of me, toes inches from my own. He is always there, at my side, in one way or another, reminding me of both his presence and his absence.
. Well, they always have been but now they are evolving to be a special brand of stupid.”
“I’m not
“Staring.” I feel my breath hitch but manage to conjure a laugh. Contentment is dangerous; he is too close, and I know he will regret saying that by morning.
“You’re thinking,” he says to me, and I have to remind myself not to drop my gaze to his lips.
John's head snapped up as the door to his tattoo studio opened. The artist left his daydream to find a man of considerable height standing in the doorway, eyes flicking around the room in all directions yet avoiding him. Straightening his back in a feeble attempt to appear taller, John smiled at the handsome figure approaching the counter.
“What's got into you?” His friend Martha asked, swatting a book at his arm with too much force.
Something tells me this moment is now vital in a way that moments can come to be. The answer I give will be pivotal, will determine the outcome of tonight, but either way he will be angry at me. Because I am an arse and will take things too far, and he has a Captain’s temper.
Except this time around, the smaller of the two was prepared; his head not empty but on overload. John pushed forward until Sherlock was leaning against the worktop, his hands finding their way into curls while teeth nipped at an angular jaw, drawing small moans from parted lips. They were possibly the hottest things John had ever heard and he found himself going from semi to fully hard immediately. He was not shy about it now though, as Sherlock’s erection was just as insistent pressing into his thigh.
“You’re staring,” he tells me, because it’s true.
“No, but someone’s ordered ‘em for you, mate. Bit odd though. Ain’t seen many men receiving carnations since I started the job.”
“Well, would you tell me? You know mine, somehow. I want to know yours.”
It was amazing how much you could get to know a person in a short time, John thought as he recalled his first encounter with Sherlock Holmes the week before. Ten days ago they had been strangers; Sherlock being another beautiful and unattainable man that John didn’t really consider he had a chance with. Today they were on what John now felt
.” I look up at him and find him leaning forward, silvering hair shining in the light and the rosy glow, caused by alcohol, now absent from his cheeks. “A lack of care from
After a few moments, he decided to follow his heart, ignoring how cliché thinking that felt, and pulled open the door.
“Of course I know. You tell me all the time, how could I forget?”
He made his way through the shelves of books, spying each section’s name but ignoring the screaming children and squabbling students around him. John continued past sci-fi and history and almost past romance until he reached the desk he usually sat at and touched his fingertips lightly against the back of a chair.
“Shut up. He deserved them and I'd do it again. I couldn’t find enough daisies at the time so I had to make do. But I used to give them out hoping someone would pick them for me in return. I never did get any because, according to my family and much of society, men ‘can’t be given flowers’.”
"You don't think you'll ever find the one then?" Suddenly the room felt hotter. Sherlock was a client, a stranger in every sense, yet here John was asking him increasingly personal questions regarding his love life as if they had been close for years. He avoided the man's gaze as he waited for a reply, almost regretting his interrogation, but he waited so long it felt as if he would get no answer at all.
The words, closest thing to an admission of
"Oh no, it's a-"
"I-I'm sorry?" John's heart skipped again, bounding ahead of his brain which was much slower in terms of comprehension.
I sit and stare intently into the fire place until my vision is obscured with coloured spots. Wisps of smoke escape and strive for freedom, rising into the haven the chimney provides, leaving the flat we call home. Called home.
, he thought as the lab door closed, realising that he had just ordered the most attractive guy he’d ever seen to a first aid room where he was then going to… he didn’t know exactly what, but he was sure his body had some ideas.
This library was quiet compared to others he'd frequented and was free of any screaming children which immediately made it his favourite. The only noises were the flicking of pages and the sound of computer keys tapping; the opposite of a distraction, it comforted him.
le fin.
. The theories hardly hold any scientific credibility. It is a distraction to me - to my work. I am best off without it." John was puzzled at this.
John looked up and swore he detected jealousy in Sherlock's voice. Hiding a smirk, he pushed further.
John could think of nothing to say to this and instead threw his head back and laughed, putting an arm around Sherlock’s neck and pulling him in close again for a soft, sweet kiss.
“That’s good,” Sherlock broke the silence a few moments later.
Shaking fingers press into my shoulder instead; comfort? apology? goodbye? My pulse quickens at the thought of goodbye but I push it away and remember how many times he has left me in the past, only to return and save me from oblivion once more. This is what we do.
"Angelo is my Uncle." John shook his head and chuckled. Sherlock realised just how close they had come to crossing paths in the past before dissolving into soft laughter. John joined in, disbelieving that for so long he had waited for a William when all along he should have been searching for the handsome man grinning before him, ready to take him to lunch; a man with the name Sherlock Holmes.
“Yeah, actually. I was looking f-”
“Got that bit.”
“I was observing your clothing.”
Sentiment won over, or maybe it was spontaneous hayfever, and Sherlock’s eyes watered. He smiled and headed up the stairs to find water for the flowers, cradling them gently to his chest while searching for something to use as a vase.
Sherlock.
“She's nice though. I think you’d like her.”
“Becau-
“The what?”
"I don't... how can it be? What are the chances, Sherlock... William...
The stranger spun on his heel and walked away. John stopped frowning and followed, half jogging to keep him in sight.
"Wait, William is your first name? And Sherlock is-"
“Thinking?”
I am, you know.” John stops again and I know he is watching, desperately trying to observe and deduce in the same way I do to him except I am an expert and he is not. Of which I am glad. I blink, clear the moisture from my eyes and resist the urge to laugh. He would not appreciate it.
,” Sherlock whined, his legs nearly squeezing around John’s neck again. John pressed a hand down on a pale thigh, keeping it there as he sucked harder, obscene noises sending jolts of pleasure to his own erection.  His hands stroked soft skin while his mouth worked, teased it until Sherlock’s breathing increased and his balls tightened and suddenly a hand pulled his hair hard. John swatted it away, knowing what Sherlock was trying to do, and instead hummed around the dick in his mouth.
. Please don’t stop,” the man on his back begged, thrusting his hips softly in anticipation. “I won’t do it again,” he added, breathing shallow.
have a form of headache, just not in the head that would usually earn you a place in the University's medical room.
"He's just a guy I met in the local library. He probably wants to... give me back my library card or something," he whispered, unconvincingly, and cursed himself for being so terrible at coming up with excuses.
"Yes... how poetic. But I have looked long enough and if anything he will have to find me. Maybe you should do the same." John only nodded as he mulled the words over, his fingers tracing the name of his destined other half's name through his sleeve. He had a feeling Sherlock was doing this because he believed he wouldn't find 'John'. Many clients had behaved in similar ways but he never felt quite as determined to stop them as he did with this particular one.
“Yes.” The earnest reply shocked John a little and he closely watched as Sherlock turned and placed a beaker of blue liquid on the shelf behind him. “I was waiting for you to drop by, as a matter of fact. I even inquired about you with your room-mate.”
The aroma of fresh coffee and warmth filled his lungs as he scanned the tables for a sign of his date and then wondered at the same time if this was
“Why not?” The familiar voice had changed completely, now something else entirely; it sent a shock wave through John’s body that prompted him to bite down gently on Sherlock’s skin.
“How long did you stay?”
Because some of you have kindly asked, I'll have to pause with this story for the Summer. But I'll finish with them in a good place and promise to pick it up in the Autumn again. I have plenty of ideas I'd like to explore with them both.
Sherlock squirms a bit on his chair. He can't imagine how that will feel like, given the intense pleasure he's already getting from this tiny plug. He just nods and licks his lips.
“Take your clothes off, all of them.” John tells him now, bringing him back to the present as he unpacks a few neat bundles of dark rope. Sherlock obeys quietly, folding his linen trousers and light cotton shirt before placing them neatly on the bench.
“God, fuck me, John, please, I’m so open for you, I prom-…”
The noises Sherlock makes when John hits his prostate send a shiver down John's sweaty spine, spurring him on.
“I am calm.” Sherlock retorts primly.
Sherlock stays on the floor next to the bed, spits into his right hand and strokes John to full hardness. They don't have any lube, so saliva and John's pre-come will have to do. Soon, he starts leaking, and Sherlock's ample fingers smear his juice all over his cock. John hums with pleasure as he watches, his eyes darting between Sherlock's hand on his cock and Sherlock's face. His lips are wet and slightly parted, his eyes hooded beneath heavy lids.
John sighs. “He said nothing, Mycroft. He wasn't...”, John crosses his arms and looks away. “He was in severe shock, I'd say. He had shut down. Completely.”
“Don't move.” Mycroft says, removing his fingers. Sherlock's hole gapes for a moment, staying open before slowly fluttering close around John's cock again. Mycroft growls.
Sherlock is sitting on the chair in his room after finishing his morning routine, his skin flushed a rosy pink from the shower. John has just administered his shot of glucose. Now, he steps back and admires Sherlock's new jewellery. He looks ravishing with his long, graceful limbs, his pale skin, damp black curls falling over his forehead, an uneven seam sealing his mouth, the black twine disfiguring his strangely alluring alien features. He seems almost unreal, like a spectre from a nightmare or a fiendish demon.
John takes his time fucking his mouth. He pulls off now and then when he gets too close, to draw it out. Sherlock's throat starts to hurt and the corners of his mouth get stretched and tear a bit, but he doesn't protest or resists. He just opens wide and takes it.
“You understand that you need this, right, after your disgusting behaviour in the bathroom? Getting off from being used as a piss-pot.”
Sherlock looks down and starts fiddling with the sheets before asking way too nonchalantly: “So you'll keep me company for while?”
Sherlock feels his tormented cock twitch in anticipation as John helps him up and into his coat before getting dressed himself and calling a cab.
Sherlock reluctantly sits back on his heels and waits. His cheeks are tinged pink with arousal. He blushes even more as John slowly strokes himself in front of Sherlock's face. Sherlock can smell him, can see the salty fluid well up his slit, and it's maddening being not allowed to taste.
“You want to offer Sherlock to those guys as some kind of incentive?” John knows he sounds way too agitated but he can't help it.
As Sherlock sinks slowly onto his knees, he can feel his skin being torn open. The spikes on his shins sink into his flesh and are driven into his knee caps. He groans low in his throat but doesn't hesitate to obey, despite the pain.
Sherlock tries to concentrate on the task, but the vibrator is still buzzing inside his rectum, distractingly, making his cock leak copiously. Too much sensory input he can't block out; he's totally helpless. He admits defeat, tilts his head back and lets Mycroft shovel porridge down his aching throat.
“So they played happy families in your dungeon and all had a jolly good time.” Sherlock interjects. “But what changed tonight that it ended in the girl dead and his Lordship being castrated?”
John watches, enthralled, then speeds his movements up even more, fucking Sherlock so hard that the chair slams repeatedly into the wall. When John eventually comes, he groans like he is in pain while biting so hard down onto Sherlock's left nipple that he draws blood.
Sherlock casts his eyes down and bows his head, not sure if he can hide his feelings from showing on his face.
“I wanted to be ready and wet for you to just push into me and fuck me.” Sherlock sighs with pleasure as John adds another finger.
“Take the weights.” John groans. They are slim, silver pieces, fastened with a clamp.
“Thank.. you.” He croaks, his eyes fluttering shut.
“Wrong place, wrong time.” Sherlock gets up, swirls around and leaves the room. “Where's my brother?”
Sherlock doesn't so much as look at him, but instantly walks towards the passage leading to his room.
“I told you I could arrange for a body to be found and identified as yours.” Sherlock half turns around, looking up at John from under his lashes, utterly debauched.
Sherlock's heartbeat starts to race as he watches. He remembers John filling him up with his piss a mere hour ago, the sensation, the smell... he wants it again, desperately.
It takes a few minutes for John's red hot anger to simmer down to a darkly determined ire. But eventually he releases Sherlock's hair and shoves him away as if repelled by the broken figure at his feet. “Stay like this. I get everything ready.”
When he opens his bag Sherlock's eyes go wide and his pulse quickens. Meticulously John sets out the content on their kitchen table: two screw top jars, a plastic-wrapped syringe, a black tourniquet, latex gloves, a small sachet of medical lubricant, black hemp rope and a chrome device not unlike some futuristic scissors, only with three blades instead of two and a screw in the middle of the handle. Sherlock is equal parts horrified and aroused by this display and looks questioningly over to John.
“Just say it.” Yet John doesn't feel as calm as he pretends. In fact, an ice-cold fear spreads in his stomach. Sherlock never instigates such talks. Relationship-talks.
One of them suddenly stands right in front of him and pulls on the silver rings piercing his nipples. Another man steps up behind him and fondles his arse, squeezing his cheeks before pushing his hand in between them. Sherlock doesn't protest, only freezes. He doesn’t like this at all.
John grins as he eventually tucks himself away. “God, look at you. You get hard when I use you like this.” Sherlock just moans again and writhes in the rapidly cooling puddle of piss on the floor. “Stop it. Come on, get up.”
“Why wouldn't I be able to speak?” Sherlock asks confused.
After a few minutes, John quickly removes the shower head and stuffs the plug back in. Water is still sloshing around inside Sherlock. He gasps in pain as the large toy fills his raw colon again, stretching his abused intestines. Soon, the building pressure will have him cramping, he knows that. He’s not sure he’ll be able to take it. But fainting would mean lying in the grimy brew filling the tub.
Sherlock can feel his face heat up in humiliation. Oh, god! All those pictures John had taken! He has to close his eyes, unable to endure the lewd smirk Moriarty gives him.
“We'll lie down a bit. But we won't leave you alone. If you can't endure this anymore, just stamp your feet. We'll free you anytime you want.”
John nods, a small smile on his face. “Show me. I want to look at you.” He steps back and gives Sherlock room to undress. For the second time today, Sherlock neatly folds his suit and shirt and steps out of his pants.
John quickly removes his fingers, but otherwise, they stay like this for a few moments until Sherlock has his breath back. They are both too weak and tired to tug themselves away. When Sherlock scrambles eventually to his feet, his wet trousers just drop to the floor, soaking in the yellow puddle. He steps out of them rather unceremoniously before looking a little sheepishly at John.
“I can be sure that I wouldn’t.”
“Odd thing to observe. What does my clothing show you then, clever boy?” There is amusement in his voice and something else. My stomach lurches at
Sherlock continued to drop coloured alkaline solution into clear acid while John was left to think of a response. The best he could come up with was: “I... well. I like you, too.”
“Wait, are you sure? I get the impression that this is your first time doing this stuff, you don’t have to...” John protested half-heartedly as Sherlock stroked his aching cock, eyes fixed on the wet tip.
. Leave it.”
“Pfft,” Sherlock scoffed. “Well, I'm sure
“Woah, woah! Calm it, Sherlock, you’ll have me down the stairs!” John chuckled, wrapping his arms around the taller man’s waist to steady himself.
"Yeah?"
John's hands curled around the handle of the coffee shop door, his stomach doing what could only be described as somersaults. His head told him to turn around, his heart told him to walk inside, and his body wanted other things John dare not consider if he wanted to look Sherlock in the eye for the next hour or so.
“Is that a euphemism?”
"William Sherlock Scott Holmes." The man said the name with a gentle smile, his thumb stroking John's skin delicately.
Unfortunately, John found the Chemistry department with ease and was standing at the entrance of the lab Sherlock had asked to meet in sooner than he would have liked. He inhaled deeply, steeling himself against the nervous adrenaline running through him. Seeing Sherlock, knowing that the last thing they'd done was kiss, was giving John all sorts of feelings and as he reached for the door handle they doubled in intensity.
“Wait, why are you crying? I thought you’d like them,” John fussed.
“She, actually; Molly. Rather good. Studies criminology at the Uni.”
Sherlock smiled as John’s eyes took in his pale chest, collar bones pink from where John had nipped them minutes before. He grinned, locked the door, pulled his jumper off, thankful for the cool air that rushed to his skin, and crawled onto the small bed that was supposed to be for students with headaches. John suppressed another laugh as he justified that he
John and I.
Sherlock dropped the pipette and John turned to face him, eyes flicking once again to rosy lips and a perfect cupid’s bow. It took two seconds for John to reach forward before their lips collided for a second time.
"Yes, it's my name, but you are no longer here to erase it."
“I would tell him not to bother,” Sherlock played idly with a sugar packet, poking the granules around the table.
“Of course you’re my love, you know that. I wanted to do something nice for you, you’ve been so stressed recently what with the lack of cases and all. Thought you’d need some cheering up,” John reassured whilst reaching up to wipe a tear from Sherlock’s cheek.
“I always do.” The man smiled wide this time and turned on his heel, heading for a different cluster of shelves, leaving John slightly bewildered.
means acting like a
At first sight of '
“We can’t do this here,” John groaned, lips working on the base of Sherlock’s neck while cool hands roamed his back and caressed his shoulders.
John knew Sherlock could taste himself on his tongue and the dirtiness of it went straight to his already throbbing cock. He moaned and thrust against Sherlock’s thigh, remembering how turned on he was and not able to hide it. Sherlock pulled back from the kiss and pressed his face into John’s neck, cool fingers wrapping around the smaller man’s dick and stroking slowly.
The conversation, if it can be called that, dies and I force my eyes back to watching sparks of the fire, only for them to be pulled to John against my will. His jumper is askew and his shirt collar is creased, but instead of aggravation it sends a wave of something moreunfamiliar through me. Perhaps affection. It makes my fingers itch to reach forward and straighten the clothing, to fasten the button of his shirt slowly and look into his dark eyes as I do so. But I don’t. I’m afraid of what might happen. My hands, untrustworthy, would betray me and find themselves on his cheeks, his jaw, his waist and all the other areas of John I have forbidden myself to consider.
"Oh, wasn't expecting you to stand up. We're not ready, you haven't picked a design yet." Having Sherlock so close was a little hard to bear and he felt his pulse quicken. "Uh, sit down in the chair and keep looking, or something, maybe I can just sketch a design you'd like-"
John felt heat clouding around him, pushing down on his chest and making it harder to breathe. His collar was too tight, he suddenly hated jumpers, and his heart would not stop beating against his ribcage. As for his brain, it was blank as all the blood had rushed in directions further south, creating a problem he soon wouldn’t be able to hide.
I smile, not breaking our gaze, and nod slowly. A collar can tell me all I need to know about him, but it is unnecessary for I already know it all. He watches me for a long moment and I wonder if he can see the sparkle in my eyes, whether he thinks it is tiredness or a trick of the firelight or if he sees it for what it really is; grief. A mourning for something never had, only danced around and snatched away by fate and too much fear.
“Thank you for everything, I'll be in touch,”  he said to a stunned John, who was still recovering from what was possibly the best kiss of his life and glancing around to see who had watched the passionate display.
“From both of you.” His fingers flex, jaw clenches; he knows I am right. A shuddering exhale before he is able to find words again.
“That just makes it sweeter.”

On rare occasions like this, when blinded by emotion, I find myself with no response. No witty remarks or snide comments that earn me disapproving looks. My mind fails me at the times I need it most and my body is left to pick up the pieces.
“You sound like you know what you're talking about,” John remarked, with what he hoped was a smirk on his face.
They talked for another hour and John discovered Sherlock was studying Chemistry but actually wanted to pursue a career in crime. He found his new acquaintance wanted to become a detective, was gay, loved books, found children fascinating, adored bees and loved black coffee. Meanwhile, Sherlock had deduced that John was considering joining the army but wanted to be a writer when he was old, loved Bond films, dogs, tea, and had a strange obsession with knitted jumpers. How they had reached these topics of conversation, John didn't know, but he couldn't be more chuffed that they had. A stranger that had seemed so aloof and mysterious last week was in reality a kind soul who read to children and liked to impress people with his extraordinary observation skills. Well, he certainly had succeeded with John when it came to impressing and he thought about this as he left the library; a stack of crime novels and medical journals in his arms and a developing crush somewhere in the vicinity of his heart.
“May I sit?” He asked Sherlock, who was sitting and studying pages of Chemistry notes and a crime anthology at the same time. The dark haired attendant sent John a grin. He considered John’s question for a moment before kicking the chair lightly so it could be pulled out with ease.
thank you for reading, commenting or leaving kudos on this fic! i really enjoyed writing this au, cliché as it is, and i hoped you also enjoyed reading it.
“You asked
As soon as John saw him, the man who was no longer a stranger but maybe a date met his gaze and smiled. He leaned back, placing the phone he had been fiddling with on the table and John's heart skipped as he took in Sherlock’s appearance. Purple shirt, dark blazer, expensive coat draped over the third chair; he looked stunning.

crying about that?” John asked softly.
, John? Policeman these days are...
“Not a compliment I can say I receive frequently,” I deflect with cheeks flaring. John’s words too often have that effect.
,” Sherlock said, intently looking at John who flushed pink at the compliment. “You’re beautiful for getting me flowers and thinking of me and calling me your ‘love’ on the card.”
“Here, try this. It's a simple annotated guide to the basics of human anatomy but it's often helpful to start with what you
The corners of my mouth turn upwards as my eyes close. When they open moments later John is lingering at the doorway, half with me and half lost to me; tied to her and me simultaneously.
“Thank you.”
“Yeah, well. It’s just. Well, why did you-”
"Are you sure?" he asked gently. "You're only, what, thirty five?" Sherlock arched an eyebrow at this and John prayed he wasn't blushing under the gaze. "There's still plenty of time to meet..." he carefully reached for Sherlock's slender wrist and read the name.
“Oh.”
“Me too,” Sherlock interrupted and John stayed quiet, a warm feeling spreading through his chest.
information is not as hard. I think it will help.”
Taking a breath that was more shaky than he’d have liked, John spoke.
Suddenly, his head was crushed and he pulled back from between Sherlock’s thighs.
"That's the whole of it." Bright eyes locked onto his own and a realisation struck him.
“I'm not
I cannot deny him when he says my name like that.
“I’m sorry! I... wasn’t expecting you to do
* * *
“Oh, about what?”
John stared at his phone, not sure what to think but still feeling an excited tingle all the same. Of course coffee with Sherlock was what he wanted, and had been since he left the library approximately forty eight hours before, but the idea sent a nervous shiver down his spine.
“I don’t need to tell you for you to remember, you don’t forget anything anyway.”
“You know I’m sorry. You... you
John stopped thinking and nodded, searching the desk a little frantically for the notebook his assistant Mary was

“My friend wants to go into policing,” John said, taking a sip of a now cold drink.
He hesitated, pursing his lips, thinking of how best to phrase a reply.
"No. I... I don't want to. I don't need a 'soulmate', whatever that actually
John pulled his coat collar up against the wind as he half-sprinted across the road, heading for the local library. Rain trickled from his hair down to his neck and he reached the doors shivering, cursing Britain for its weather until feeling the warmth from the heaters tickle his face.
“Again then, why are you..
anything and racked his brain for a book to pretend he needed.
?" John asked, exasperated. So many names but only one person that mattered.
“I’m… you know I’m no good at this. There’s so much to say.” There is no anger, surprisingly. Stupidly, I find myself wishing there was. Anything is better than hearing my name spoken in John’s strained voice.
A second knock echoed through the flat a moment later and Sherlock spun on his heel, heading downstairs.
“Nothing of import-”
John texted those exact words and a reply pinged back at him almost immediately.
I drop my eyes to his knees and let my gaze wander to the print of his chair. It is not new or even unfamiliar to me. I could trace the design onto his skin with my fingers whilst blindfolded, should he ask. Since he left, or moved away, many evenings are filled only by staring at that chair and its network of floral patterns and mockery.
Realisation struck the detective at the same his eyes found the silver card attached to the stem of carnation. Gently, he pushed his hand into the bouquet and retrieved the card, stomach erupting with butterflies.
“Simple. I observed it. What specific topic areas are you researching?”
The almost-stranger's fingers were cool as they traced John's wrist and it felt nice, almost like John had been waiting for it to happen. It was a strange action but he didn't question the motives or the sudden softness behind the movements.
than odd.
“Are you okay? You’re not usually this...” John searched for the word, “affectionate,” he settled on.
“Is it a girl?” John rolled his eyes and turned his head the other way, hoping it would signal the end of the interrogation. “Is it a boy?” She persisted.
what I was doing? Why didn’t you ask me if you were in my dormitory anyway?” John thought briefly of how his room-mate would react later. He could see it now, being mocked for what Greg would surely see as
“After gathering sufficient data, I have come to the conclusion that I like you considerably more than previously thought.”
“Just do – hmm-  whatever you’re,
An attempt at being flirtatious but John knew somehow it would be lost on Sherlock.
, I'm just... distracted,” John revealed, making an effort to avoid Martha’s gaze and focus on the lecture about cardiovascular diseases instead. His friend had a way of getting the truth out of people, even if she never seemed to tell it herself.
"What is her name, anyway?" Sherlock asked, eyes dropping to John's hands. The question evoked a flush of the artist's cheeks.
"Well, surely I wouldn't be covering up his name if I had, would I? I see your deduction skills are not exactly advanced." John ignored the insult and nodded, chewing his lip thoughtfully.
There is nothing for me to say. The clothes are just one piece of evidence, there are many more that I would never tell him. The way she looks at him, like he is a burden. The way he looks at her, because she isn’t me. The bitterness and the arguments and John leaving the surgery late, missing dinner to waste time with his ex-flatmate. A creased collar is nothing in the grand scheme of things.
“You’re going to make a good soldier,” Sherlock whispered before he left, leaving John to inhale and exhale deeply, getting himself under control while suppressing a laugh at the absurdity of it all.
“Distracted by who?”
“Hello,” John greeted, shedding his own jacket and laying it on the same seat as Sherlock's coat. “You haven't been waiting long, have you?”
A few seconds later a note was pushed onto his desk and he glanced at it in horror.
wrist anyway, but that's the way it goes. Can only keep hoping. Not that I would cover the name up just because..." he realised he had been rambling for slightly too long and turned to see his client standing behind him, an intense but unreadable expression contorting his features.
“Yeah, uh... text me?” John called after Sherlock, who had left him to undo his top button in frustration and wonder what the hell any of it had meant. The only thing he felt certain of in that moment was that
"Yes, well. John is a very common name."
this is the nsfw chapter. i've not written anything like this before so hope it reads okay! :)
John thrust the paper into his pocket and swallowed his embarrassment, earning a hushed snort from Martha.
“I kissed you because I like you,” Sherlock didn’t hesitate to answer, halting John’s sentence and his thoughts in their tracks.
"How about lunch?" Sherlock asked, a little hesitantly. "I know a lovely little place not too far from here that we could go to. Angelo's, it's called. I know the owner, actually. Helped him out a few times in the past."
"Uh, nothing. Nothing. It's just funny because, well, that's my name." John glanced up and met Sherlock's eye, catching a flicker of something registering before he half snatched his wrist back and sniffed.
“What is that supposed to mean?”
we’ve achieved in ages, sting unbearably. They are sharp and cutting but not the worst I’ve heard; hearing him whisper ‘I do’ was worse.
"Of course, course. Hello then, Mr- I mean... Sherlock. It's a habit of mine I'm afraid, this formality. My assistant always says I'm too uptight and clinical." He laughed nervously, conscious that Sherlock's eyes were now glued to him.
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock said. John smiled, pleased to finally have a name for the striking face.
“That’s because I didn't tell you.”
“No way? I haven't seen you around. The chemistry labs are right by the medicine ones, how have I not bumped into you?” John asked, astounded that he hadn’t met this fascinating man sooner despite going to the same university and both being in the same year.
The flowers were bright and beautiful and Sherlock felt his heart flutter as their perfume tickled his nose. He wondered who sent them, not having any previous flower-receiving experiences to base his deductions off of, and thought maybe it was his parents. It would never be Mycroft, his brother often made a mess of things but flowers would be odd.
“For saying you’re affectionate?”
Once inside, John was hit with the smell of experiments. He glanced around and saw the science room was large, crowded and much more interesting than the medical labs he spent much of his own time in. Several workstations were dotted around the place, with beakers and vials lined up on each surface, but only one station was occupied. Sherlock was stood poised over a Petri dish, pipette in hand, a concentrated look contorting his pale, angular face. John cleared his throat and Sherlock met his eyes and smiled.
?” John’s heart skipped at the sight of Sherlock’s lips quirked into a half smile. It skipped faster as he saw the devious twinkle in the man’s eye and John silently promised to send Sherlock flowers as often as he could afford it.
John realised that what Sherlock actually wanted was a chat, not anything in particular, and so John approached Sherlock’s workstation and casually leaned on the counter.
“No, for the Dianthus caryophyllus.”
They dissolved into silence again as Sherlock glanced at the chair and touched his fingertips to it, eyes finding John’s after a few moments. John opened his mouth to offer him a seat before closing it again. It would be weird to ask him to sit with him, wouldn't it?
“And what’s that?” He hummed, feeling calmer than he had for weeks.
Sherlock frowned slightly. “Nothing in particular, I just thought…” he paused and chewed his lip.
"I don't know, but you told me he would find me. Ironic the one that told me is quite literally The One." He paused, looking at John fondly. "I never believed in coincidences yer here I am to erase a name off my wrist... one that belongs to the actual tattooist I was hoping would do it, it seems."
know, so that learning
textbook. You're studying to become a doctor, aren’t you? If you follow me I'll show you the section you're looking for.”
“We both do, okay? We do.” The ‘we’ here is not us, like it used to be.
The man of whom I speak is sat across from me, glass of whiskey in hand and a dazed smile softening his features. These days they are often contorted with stress, boredom; a cohort of things he doesn’t tell me but I observe anyway. For now, however, John is at ease.
“First, he has to lick up the mess here.” John's point towards the small puddle of come on the floor and Sherlock goes for it. It's not much but as he keeps it in his mouth and gargles a bit with it bubbles start to form, spilling over his lips. At a nod of John, Sherlock swallows.
“And your occupations?”
When John senses how close Sherlock is he fiercely tugs at the chain attached to the nipple clamps. Sherlock whines but is unable to lean into the traction, as Mycroft pushes him down onto the floor, both hands on his shoulders, as he presses open mouthed kisses all over Sherlock’s jaw and throat, sucking cream from his Adam’s apple and honey from the hollow of his neck between his collar bones.
“Not often.” He manages to pant weakly.
“You do as you are told or I'll start breaking your fingers one by one. See how you'll play the violin with that.”
Even Mycroft seems extremely affected by the sight. His eyes are wide and dark, and a bead of sweat runs down his temple. His bespoke trousers are tented by a huge bulge between his legs. Suddenly, it's all too much. His hands slide out of Sherlock's hole, making a lewd, slurping noise. He quickly peels off the greasy gloves to unzip. His flushed cock is hard and wet; he just pushes in in one go and starts to fuck Sherlock, deep and fast, grabbing his hips for leverage. He's grunting, his lips drawn back, teeth bared.
The inspector doesn't bat an eyelid. “Of course.” She retorts with only the smallest hint of an accent. “Or we could get you an interpreter.”
“No. Yes, well, I will set it in motion, but, of course, I will cover my tracks. I have to do that alone. The people involved... they know me, not you.” Sherlock beseechingly explains.
“You look so fucking hot Sherlock, so open, vulnerable, broken like this.” John bows down and kisses him very softly, stroking his tear-stained face. “Just one more go, then it's over.”
“Oh, don't be shy. I like it.”
Just when Sherlock thinks that he can't take it anymore, John orders him to turn around. The bedding is superior quality, very soft, but his back got so badly abused that it still hurts to have to lie on it. Nevertheless, John continues his ministrations at Sherlock's front, this time concentrating on his sensitive nipples and soft belly, deliberately avoiding his groin.
As he looks pleadingly up at John the only answer he gets is: “Crawl.”
“What's so funny about?” John shouts, and is tempted to smash the laptop onto the floor. Instead, he just shoves it onto the mattress, disgusted.
“I'm so sorry Sergeant.” Kate heaves, her voice hoarse from crying. “I deserve to be punished.”
John's eyebrows shoot up as he files away this idea for later use. Sherlock squirms in his seat.
Sherlock turns his damp face up at her, fully aware of how filthy he must look; still, he has no choice but to obey her.
He later makes the most desperate and funny noises when John starts to play with his stiff, tortured nipples. John takes his time as he pinches, pulls, licks and bites the sensitive nubs until they are bright red and raw. He imagines getting those lovely nipples pierced, two thick silver studs attached to them, but is sure he has to consult with Mycroft first.
“Are you trying to convince me or yourself?”
“Everything you say is important to me.” A wave of warmth seeps through me but I repress it with a blast of cold indifference. I must be above such things now John has left me. Left Baker Street.
“Yes, indeed there is. I wanted to talk to you.” This response surprised John but he tried to hide it from his face.
“If it's nothing then why are you blushing and why are you meeting him in the Chemistry labs after class finishes?” Martha smirked and John felt his cheeks flush darker. Sherlock wanted to meet him again? Suddenly the anxiety that had been pooling in his stomach all week was replaced with an even more intense nervousness.
joke, John-"
“Yes. But a collar to you speaks a thousand words.”
“Yes.” Keep answers short, don’t encourage anything that the alcohol makes him say, I tell myself.
“Doesn’t matter, John. Rest your eyes again. It's nothing.”
"Ah yes, sorry, you must be Mr. Holmes? Nice to meet you, uh, please make yourself comfortable," John said, cursing himself for his overly formal tone. He smiled in an attempt to seem less flustered to the rather beautiful and clearly posh man before him but, before he had a chance to say anything else, Mr. Holmes interrupted him.
"Sorry, what? How did you... know I was in the military?"
Sherlock, who the hell gives people
"Hello. I believe I have an appointment scheduled for 11:30?" The man asked and John was forced to make a considerable effort not to stare at his striking eyes or trace his sharp cheekbones. The owner of them was a strange creature, John thought, and very different from the studio's usual clientele of burly men and rebellious college students looking for something to do. Not many customers came into the parlour wearing what looked like a Dolce and Gabanna shirt.
Sherlock is so turned on that he pushes into John's touch, trying to rut slightly forward. This is followed by a sharp keen at the back of his throat as the rope tugs much more fiercely on his fresh piercings.
Tears run down Sherlock's face as his gag reflex is triggered and he retches violently before eventually accepting the intrusion, lying still, allowing John to play with him. The sugary flavour of the honey overlays the stale taste of come and piss. From time to time, John pinches his balls or tugs at his nipple weights. Pain shoots through Sherlock's body like a bolt of lightning, almost driving him over the edge despite the sweet abuse his mouth and throat suffer.
Mycroft had arrived with the SWAT team but had stayed back in their van to watch the action from a safe distance. Therefore, he wasn't aware of the details of the scene down at the morgue. John should have known that such a state of uncertainty wasn't acceptable to a Holmes.
John pulls on latex gloves and sets to work. Sherlock hisses and shudders visibly as the needle breaks his sensitive skin but stays in place. He needs three injections until John's sure that he won't hurt Sherlock more than necessary. While he waits until the local anaesthesia takes hold, he gets Sherlock a glass of water that he greedily drowns.
John moves insistent and fast, and it doesn't take long before his thumb joins his fingers. Sherlock's head falls back onto the floor, hitting the carpet hard as he tries to relax even more to let John in. Lube would help but John doesn't seem in the mood to get it. Sherlock has no choice but to stays down and take it. Only when John's knuckles slide into him, the widest part of his hand brutally breaching Sherlock, opening him up almost past endurance, does John suddenly still.
“Greg, get a SWAT team. I'm requesting a helicopter, and will call in a few favours.” Mycroft gets his phone out and starts dialling, but is interrupted by John's hand on his arm.
Behind the next door are Mycroft and Lestrade, leaning against a heavy mahogany desk. “We should have dinner soon”, his brother offers, his voice deep and cultured, full of dark promises. Greg nods.
Irene senses the sudden panic welling up inside Sherlock; her fingers pull fiercely at his hair which make his mind stutter to a halt. They lock eyes and her firm gaze grounds Sherlock, offering him a fixed point to concentrate on. He silently begs her and Irene wouldn't be good at her job if she didn't respond to Sherlock's need. Therefore she pulls his head forward until it's almost touching Kate's well-rounded arsecheeks, her brand mark dancing before his eyes. Irene hums low in encouragement before her hands leave Sherlock's hair and spread those cheeks apart, her red fingernails digging into sensitive flesh as she exposes Kate's cleft. Kate's pink hole flutters and contracts in front of Sherlock as Irene tells him: “Lick her.”
“God, that bitch truly loves its come.” Ginger laughs appreciatively, and warmth spreads through Sherlock's body as he can see John's proud expression. He revels in the men's attention, trying hard to be a good obedient slut - for John. He'll do anything for John.
This is not helping to calm Sherlock down.
It's a large rectangular building, three storeys high, built of grey granite, with a peaked slate roof. It stands on the top of a small hill, overlooking a well-kept if conventional garden. The lawn gently slopes down until it reaches the edge of a dark wood in the gloomy distance. There's not a soul about. Around here, you can walk for miles without meeting another human being. The solitary bleakness has always appealed to Sherlock. He'd stayed here after rehab.
“You go.” Sherlock decides briskly. “Call me if it's something important.” With that, he flops onto the backseat of a black cab and leaves John to his own devices.
Suddenly, he can feel Mycroft's hands around his waist, grounding him. “It's ok. I'm here. John's here. It's all right, Sherlock.”
In retrospect, Sherlock doubts that this was the ideal moment for his stomach to decide to exit its content, but, judging by the following projectile vomiting, it couldn't been helped. When his legs give out he briefly reminds himself to better not fall forward into his own sick, and then his world goes dark again.
Mycroft has heard this speech often enough to know when he's expected to nod and hum in approval. Tuning his father out, he's able to retreat into his mind palace – or in this case, rather his mind dungeon – to conjure up memories of Sherlock: Tied to a beam in the attic of the manor house, getting whipped hard; fucking himself nearly unconscious on the toys he'd provided; bending over Mycroft's desk in his club, exposing his tight pucker; Mycroft and John both taking his brother at the same time, their cocks rubbing against each other inside Sherlock's hot, pliant body; Sherlock writhing in his lap, moaning his name.
“Well, you are only the second man to fuck him, Greg.” John says. “But I'm sure, in a few weeks, he'll be able to take us both at the same time.
“Don't. You'll tear the stitches.”
John grins back. “Shouldn’t he be servicing us?” He asks.
“I'm not sure how public I want to go. It's possible that your brother is still looking for us. I'm not sure he bought my disappearance...”
John takes his chin between thumb and forefinger before he can wipe them away. Sherlock feels unmoored, reeling, and is unable to hide his disturbed state as John stares right into his eyes, deep down into his soul.
“John, we have no time for your usual stalling tactics. Is Sherlock at Bart's?” Mycroft presses, his stern voice bearing no prevarications.
Miss Adler turns his face slightly from one side to the other. “Nice. Very nice indeed. Strong-willed, independent, if a bit troubled. I can see what you like in him.” Her voice is deep and alluring. Sherlock feels himself blush.
“Stavanger.”
They take him in the middle as they all slip naked under the luxurious covers made from Egyptian cotton. Sherlock can feel John's arm around his waist as his head is pulled back to rest against Mycroft's shoulder. It's cosy, comfortable; it only takes a moment for Sherlock to fall fast asleep.
“No, that's the point.” John sighs and finally looks at him, pinching he bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger.
While Sherlock is happily licking and sucking with abandon, the two boys continue to fuck the pig, their cocks kept hard by their cock rings, all three of them grunting and hissing.
The man gives John an amused smile.
Sherlock nods, if a little dazed. John helps him up and holds out the Belstaff for him to cover himself.
Yet it feels glorious. Getting his cock fucked is an intense experience. Acri has stepped closer and watches mesmerised as well.
Without a cock ring, Sherlock is dangerously on edge, but John had made it very clear that coming without permission would lead to his eyes being sewn shut as well. Therefore, Sherlock pinches the base of his cock every time he feels his orgasm approaching until John finally tells him to come while he pulses deep inside Sherlock's body.
Sherlock wants to plead, wants to throw himself at John’s feet and his mercy, but he’s frozen, pinned down under John’s gaze.
In a quit pro quo manner, John does continue with Sherlock's body modification. If Sherlock wants to be put in the bag, he has to accommodate ever larger plugs before, during or after. Not just accept them; he has to beg for them, lube them up and push them inside himself regardless of his inclination or mood.
They had arrived in Florence yesterday. While Sherlock had visited the Uffici today, John had gone shopping. Sherlock had been thrilled all day imagining what John might have bought and how he intended his purchases to use. They had left most of their gear in Berlin, wanting a fresh start. Sherlock imagines that Judith might get a little shock when she opens her wardrobe... But as they had paid for the damage to some of her furnishings, he didn't have a guilty conscious.
“You can take it, I know you can. Stop fussing, Sherlock, this is what you were made for. See, about two thirds are already inside you. Come on, tell us how it feels.” John cheers him on as Sherlock is impaled by the oversized toy.
He's not sure for what or whom.
“Stay like this, I'll be right back.”
“See? That's what I mean. This wasn't a question, Sherlock. When I want you to speak I'll tell you.” John really starts to get angry by now.
Eventually, John gets a flannel and a bowl of hot water from the bathroom and starts to wash Sherlock's lithe, trembling body. He catalogues all the bruises and other marks he's left on the white skin over the past weeks, kissing welts and scars, as Sherlock looks on from brightly radiant eyes. When Sherlock is cleaned up, John gets the violet satin kimono from the bedroom and drapes it over Sherlock's narrow shoulders, before pulling him into his arms on the couch.
