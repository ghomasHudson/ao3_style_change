“Oh I think you’ll find that I can, John. And as you so carefully pointed out, we’ve had this conversation a dozen times and yet you still think that you have the ability to modify my behaviour in this area. Is it stupidity or just condescension, I wonder,” Sherlock sneered.
“If you need help, you could ask me, you know.”
Sherlock grinned and set his phone on the arm of the chair. John kept his word.
As John finished helping Sherlock rinse the conditioner out of his hair, both men studiously ignored the tears they knew were washing away as well.
John swallowed and looked up, searching Sherlock’s face. He knew that Sherlock cared for him but it was different to see it there in black and white.
“Lividity suggests the body was prone on his back for hours after death.”
John’s mouth worked against itself as he decided against a dozen different responses to that particular question. Eventually, he determined that the best course was simply walking away, which he did. Finding Lestrade just outside the church door, John pressed him for details of the discovery of the body, any persons of interest, and any theories that Lestrade might have. Unsurprisingly, Lestrade was extremely thorough in his list of all the things he and his team didn’t know. How long the body had been there. Who put him there. The exact cause of death. The time of death. The identity of the victim. The identity of the perpetrator, or perpetrators. The reason the dead man looked so much like Sherlock.
“If Sherlock’s deductions are accurate, we have it narrowed down to a very small area. A car is on the way for you. Two minutes.”
Over the course of dinner, the pair drank several glasses of whiskey each, both becoming increasingly cheery. After John stored the leftovers in the fridge far from the bag of eyeballs, he retired to his chair by the fire, opposite a glassy-eyed Sherlock who seemed to find something funny.
. He’s trying to amuse
Sherlock entered the flat and hung up his coat, then walked a few steps and stood in the middle of the room with his hands at his sides. His chin was pointed up, but John could tell he had absolutely no idea where to go from here. John, shutting the door, smiled fondly and decided to put Sherlock out of his misery. He walked up to the detective and recaptured his hand.
This time, there was a response. It was a simple sentence, only a few words, with a link attached:
Not-Sherlock had clearly been dead for longer than the hour since New Scotland Yard had been aware of the body. From what John could see, lividity suggested he had been killed in a prone position on his back and left there long enough for the blood to pool along the backs of his legs and, presumably, elsewhere along his back side. However, the fact that he was now in rigor mortis in a seated position suggested that he had been moved into the pew before full rigor set in. Depending on temperature and other conditions, rigor mortis is usually well established by the time lividity is fixed. The discrepancy wasn’t unheard of, but it was at least curious.
“You think?” John snapped, his discomfort bubbling up as anger, as it so often did.
“Doubtful, John. Moriarty certainly likes to make me dance and play his games, but this is a little theatrical, even for him.”
Sherlock looked up at Moriarty and hoped that his face was the neutral, bored expression he was trying so desperately to put on. In reality, he was aching, thirsty, exhausted, confused, terrified, and he needed the loo. He knew that he could only disguise his actual state for so long before time or torture wrenched the truth from him, but he wanted to delay that as long as possible.
Moriarty strode into the room with the unhurried air of someone who had absolutely nowhere else to be. “Hi, darling!” he announced, chipper as ever. “I must apologise for the lacklustre accommodations. I know your posh self is used to much better lodgings, but I had some particular specifications I had to meet for us. And, you know, needs must and all that.”
When John was about two hours outside of London, Mycroft confirmed that they had found the correct location and were moving in now. Somehow being on the way there but not having arrived was worse than simply watching it all happen from 221B. John kept his eyes trained on his mobile, the video feed revealing none of the chaos that was sure to start any moment. After several more minutes of nothing, John could hear background noise through the feed, muffled yelling, gunshots. Sherlock began to stir. John’s heartrate picked up and he gripped the phone tighter. There was a loud boom and the feed went dead.
Finally sitting up on the sofa, Sherlock looked at John. “Are you the model by which I should attempt to mold my reactions and behavior? Should I be endeavoring to weep at the movies, smile blithely at every person I pass on the street, find a moronic-but-pleasant girl and tell her that I love her
“You’re not…worried?”
For his part, Sherlock seemed delighted. The more he examined the body and the crime scene, the more his eyes lit up like it was Christmas morning. John had long since abandoned trying to get Sherlock to show any decorum when dealing with a murder, but this unabashed glee was almost enough for him to try regardless. Realising that Sherlock was too much in his own world, John swiveled to look at Lestrade. “Well?” he asked, notes of agitation and accusation in his voice.
“The best we can figure, someone’s trying to send Sherlock a message,” Lestrade replied.
John awoke with a start an indeterminate amount of time later. It was dark. Sherlock was no longer alone. His mobile beeped, a low battery warning. John scrambled to find his charging cable and plugged his phone in, then opened his laptop to watch the video on a larger screen. As if it would make a difference. As if seeing things unfold more clearly would help.
“Greg?” Sherlock questioned.
“I know I must be a horrific disappointment to you, John. First, a selfish and odd friend, then…then I managed to ruin our friendship twice over in less than 12 hours. Not exactly what I had in mind for this week.” He tried to chuckle but the pain was unbearable. It took him a moment to collect himself. “I’d like to think that my brother’s people will burst through the door any minute and I’ll be home for tea, but I’m not so sure that’s how this ends.” The effort of speaking was wearing on him. He paused. “I suppose…I just wanted to tell you, John, that you’re a good man. A good friend. The truest one I’ve ever had, not that there’s much competition. I know I’m not enough for you, but you’ve always been enough for me.” Sherlock’s ankles wobbled as his legs began to go. He stopped talking, using all his concentration to try to stay up.
that I want to
Opening his eyes, he could almost see John there with him. The words fell from Sherlock’s mouth without his mind’s permission, hardly more than a whisper.
“’m here, John. S’okay,” Sherlock slurred, clearly mostly asleep, but still somehow intuiting John’s embrace.
“John, if you ask me if I’m sure one more time, I’ll never let you wash my hair again.”
Behind a painting, inside a wall safe, Sherlock retrieved a keepsake box containing every compliment John had ever given him, every genuine smile and laugh Sherlock had ever received from John, and the newest addition: a perfectly-preserved memory of John with his hands in Sherlock’s hair, breathless and helpless, driven over the edge by Sherlock and Sherlock alone.
spoken about the events prior to Sherlock’s abduction, nor the specifics of what Sherlock inadvertently revealed over the live feed. John was done shampooing but he kept massaging Sherlock’s scalp anyway. After a few moments, he spoke again. “I meant what I said on our first case, you know. It’s all fine.”
As John tried to emerge from the shock and the haze of his own thoughts, Sherlock reluctantly disengaged from John and pulled back just far enough to look into John’s eyes. John had no idea what he looked like in that moment, but he knew that Sherlock was reading him like a book. When it seemed as though perhaps Sherlock wasn’t going to continue the kiss, a tiny, involuntary whine escaped from John’s throat. At that sound, John saw Sherlock’s pupils dilate instantly, his irises practically gone. A new level of intensity brought Sherlock’s lips back to John’s, this kiss as much a gnashing of teeth as anything.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, annoyed that he had to explain. “My range of motion is significantly reduced. I’ve been advised not to move my left arm significantly until the threat of dislocating it again is diminished, and the tear in my right shoulder needs similar treatment in order to heal.”
John merely blew out a laugh and laid back on the couch once again. “Yep,” he agreed, but made no move to get water. Sherlock allowed himself to smile for a moment as he picked up his violin and began playing a joyful but sedate tune that John didn’t recognise. John allowed his eyes to close. While listening to Sherlock compose was grating and listening to him work through his frustrations was bloody awful, getting to hear Sherlock play just for pleasure was perhaps John’s favorite sound in the world. He told himself he’d just listen for a few minutes before getting ready for bed properly.
[Well, most of it. All of it, really, if you exclude the snogging. But even then, this is the first time I did that with someone who mattered to me. –SH]
“Exactly like me, John? Surely you haven’t missed how his ears are a completely different shape to mine. And it’s obvious that his hair was styled to look similar to mine, but wouldn’t appear this way under normal circumstances.”
Hours later, John was awoken by Sherlock calling out to him through the bedroom door. Instantly fully awake, John strode to the door where a positively giddy Sherlock awaited him. “There’s been another!”
“Everything.”
As Sebastian set up a car battery with what looked like a cattle prod attached to it, Sherlock forced a smile onto his face. First a smirk, then an ever-widening grin. Moriarty stepped closer and peered into Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock said nothing for a moment. Then he broke into a wide grin and said through giggles, “Did you see the son’s face when I revealed the secret bank account?”
Trying to play it cool, John asked, “Is this sort of thing going to happen every time we have a row?”
When Sherlock’s calves failed and his feet could no longer hold his full weight, he bit off a scream. As he began to lose consciousness, he could only be grateful for the darkness that consumed him.
“That’s what you’re choosing to focus on here? My sarcasm?”
“Sherlock, I’m—“
“John.” Sherlock met and held John’s gaze for a moment. “I know you won’t.”  John simply nodded. After another long beat, John allowed himself to feel just how intensely he wanted to be with Sherlock and all the things he yearned to do. Ever so slightly, he loosened the tight leash he kept on his desires.
John realised that Sherlock was leaving him standing in the street by himself and he caught the sight of a long coat swirling as Sherlock ducked under the tape and entered the house. He rolled his eyes, the smile never leaving his face, and followed behind.
“Sherlock,” John began, the effort of steadying his voice apparent, “we have had this conversation a dozen times and yet you still seem to need me to explain this to you. You
John just smiled and nodded. Sherlock’s request, while practical in nature, meant a lot more than that. Sherlock was trusting John, asking for help, admitting he needed it, and allowing John to see his vulnerability again. Right now, John would do anything Sherlock asked him to do.
After several more blood tests, a repeat x-ray, and two hospital meals, Sherlock was practically vibrating out of his skin. Regardless of the severity of his injuries, he simply detested being there and finally convinced John to get him signed out. Mycroft sent a car and the pair finally made it back to Baker Street late Thursday morning. Three days. John couldn’t believe all this had happened over three days.
[I suppose I could be convinced. –SH]
This victim, it turned out, required a bit more primping and effort to turn into a Sherlock lookalike, but the effect was still striking. The location at which this Not-Sherlock was found was about as far from the church as it could be, figuratively speaking. The relatively-posh brothel was a small operation run out of an unassuming house outside of London proper. Although the owner had been hesitant to contact the police as the business wasn’t strictly legal, a dead body showing up in a hot tub merited phoning up the Met.
John risked a glance up at Sherlock and felt his soul leave his body. Sherlock’s hair was a riotous mop and the pink flush John had observed earlier was now colouring Sherlock’s entire torso and most of his face. Sherlock’s lips were slightly parted and his eyes…his eyes held the most intense hunger John had ever seen. Swallowing and blinking a few times, John looked down at Sherlock’s achingly hard cock. “I’ve never done this before, so…well, I know what
John understood what he was asking. “Yeah.”
John’s heart constricted in his chest. He stood, facing Sherlock, and bent down. He put his arms under Sherlock’s and did his best to avoid putting strain on any obvious injuries. After a nerve-wracking moment, Sherlock was able to get to his feet. John took much of his weight as they hobbled the few metres to the waiting vehicle, where Sherlock permitted himself to be helped inside. He looked as though he would run away from the vehicle itself if he could even walk under his own power. John climbed in the back with Sherlock and the EMTs had the good sense to say nothing about it whatsoever.
[Typing that out was even worse than I expected. –MH]
“I swear to God, Mycroft, if you don’t find Sherlock tonight, no one will ever find
Lestrade furrowed his brow. “But they didn’t ask him anything.”
As John stood by the couch and inhaled in advance of speaking, Sherlock muttered, “Don’t.”
Sherlock pulled back just enough to look in John’s eyes.
“It was good, very thoughtful.” John laughed again.
Sherlock sighed, the set of his shoulders revealing resignation. “I can’t reach it.”
John threw his hands in the air in exasperation. “So I’m either an idiot or an arsehole for not wanting to see you killed? Those are the two options?”
Sherlock nodded, avoiding John’s eyes. John sat down next to Sherlock, close enough that Sherlock would know John was there, but not so close that it felt oppressively intimate. They sat in silence for a few minutes until Sherlock tried to shift his weight and nearly fell over in pain.
John risked a reply. “You already are being vulnerable Sherlock. Telling me this, being open with me like this.”
“I happen to like my jumpers.”
For his part, John had no intention of getting into a screaming row with Sherlock in the middle of the Yard, particularly when he knew that his concerns came from a place of deep affection. The last thing he needed was to shout at the top of his lungs about how Sherlock meant too much to him and all that. The chin-wags around the water coolers would persist for months.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. When he continued, his voice was low and wretched. “When I….approached you after the second body, when I—when we—“ He inhaled again and let the breath out as slowly as his trembling body would allow. “I haven’t had much cause to explain myself to anyone, and certainly not my
“What am I supposed to say, John?” Affecting a treacly tone, Sherlock exclaimed, “‘Oh darling, I’m ever so glad we’ve found true love. Let’s retire to the country’?” His normal tone returned. “I hardly think a few kids and a dog are in our future, certainly not in mine. You needed distracting and a physiological release. I simply determined the most expedient way to provide both. It won’t do for you to get all maudlin about it.”
Sherlock cut him off. “Bedside drawer.”
After a moment, John groaned and responded, “I’m alright. I’m alright, Sherlock.” He grunted and sat up, holding his torso stiff as he did so. “I just landed badly. Nothing some ice and rest won’t fix.” Sherlock searched John’s face and was relieved to find no deception there. Even so, John’s obvious discomfort and the rigidity with which he held himself as they returned to Baker Street were concerning.
Mycroft, unruffled and unsurprised, simply replied, “We
“Agreed.”
“Simply, I should put myself on offer. Cut to the chase, if you will.”
) knelt between Sherlock’s knees.
It all began when Sherlock agreed to take on a case that was barely a four. He’d solved it in two days, and it only took that long because the lab results were slow in coming. Once Sherlock had proven that the son had perpetrated the scam in order to defraud his own father of millions, the father – their client – had been lavish with his praise. He had also been lavish with his gratuity; on top of the substantial fee to be paid for solving the crime, Sherlock and John were gifted an extremely expensive bottle of whiskey. Arriving back at the flat feeling accomplished, John poured two generous glasses and toasted to Sherlock.
John furrowed his brow but said nothing.
Hours later, as Sherlock lay in his bed next to his sleeping fiancé, he toyed with the ring for the hundredth time, rereading the inscription on the inside:
A line of concern marred Sherlock’s perfect brow. “If you’d rather not, John, I’d completely understand—“
“Come now John, you liked mine and it only cost me four quid for the memory stick.”
John sat stunned for a moment, then took in what Sherlock said and immediately released his grip on Sherlock’s foot. He very intentionally rolled his shoulders and relaxed his jaw, trying but failing to erase the obvious tells that Sherlock had listed. After a moment, he looked back down at his hand, now on top of the blanket, and breathed, “Sorry.”
“I told you to shut up because I didn’t want you to tell me ‘no’. I didn’t want to hear your doubts or your apologies. ‘I’m not gay.’ Again and again. And afterwards, when I realised how far it went, I couldn’t bear to look at you.” Sherlock tried to turn his head but found himself unable, though his muscles groaned in protest anyway. He took a steadying breath. “I didn’t want to see how disgusted you would be. Or how much you would pity me. ‘Poor Sherlock, the sociopath who thinks anyone would want him.’” His voice lowered to a whisper. “I was so…afraid.”
“After what I did and said, John, after the way you looked at me that day, I knew I could never let myself be so cruel to you again. I needed to find a way to talk to you, to be open with you. I don’t really know how to do it, but I want to try.”
John felt a thrill skitter up his spine, goose pimples breaking out all over his flesh. “Have you got—“
After finding Sherlock absent from the flat, John managed a shower and a shave, feeling almost human by the time he finished a very late breakfast. As he braced himself for his afternoon shift at the clinic, he ruminated on his and Sherlock’s conversation the night before as well as Sherlock’s caregiving overnight. John knew that Sherlock would offer a perfectly rational, impassive explanation for the blanket and water and medicine – something about not wanting John to be incapable of consulting on a new case, or knowing that John would be intolerably grouchy, or the like – and it did nothing to read more into it than that. Sherlock, at his core, was fundamentally self-serving and had demonstrated such repeatedly over the course of their friendship. Regardless, John wasn’t entirely able to talk himself out of feeling a little bit of warmth at the image of Sherlock (himself still tipsy and exhausted) caring for John as he slept.
“Good.”
“John,” Sherlock began, “he’s not trying to amuse
“Yeah, I know, not exactly rocket science, but we’ve only just found the poor bloke an hour ago. Best we can tell is that the murder was committed elsewhere and the body was left here for some reason. A bit too obvious for someone trying to hide the crime, so clearly there’s a message. That’s as far as we’ve got.” Lestrade rubbed his jaw, clearly not liking the situation any more than John.
As they interviewed friends and relatives, examined the homes of the men, and looked at the evidence, John began to notice little things about Sherlock. Specifically, little things Sherlock was saying and doing for John. He complained less about John’s unreasonable requests (like occasionally eating or sleeping). When he borrowed John’s phone to send a text, he actually said “thank you.” Most damning of all, he complimented John’s work in deducing the significance of the evidence. When Sherlock figured out that three of the brothers were dead and one was in hiding to avoid being murdered – by a fifth non-quadruplet brother, no less – Sherlock actually told John that his help had been invaluable. John had no idea if he was only noticing these things for the first time, or if Sherlock’s behavior was actually changing. Regardless, he chided himself not to read anything into these niceties. After all, for anyone else, this behavior would be considered only moderately friendly, and certainly not remarkable. Of course, Sherlock isn’t anyone else. Trying to compare him to other people was both impossible and useless.
John’s heart broke for the man. How could he believe that? John steeled himself for what he knew he needed to say, finally.
, Mrs. Hudson!” John simply dissolved into giggles. The sound of Mrs. Hudson’s approaching footsteps stopped abruptly.
Ex-Military lifted Sherlock from the ground easily, setting him onto unsteady feet. Despite his intent to follow Ex-Military’s instructions, Sherlock’s brain went into full panic mode and he began to struggle and squirm, trying to get away from Ex-Military and whatever pain awaited him. Ex-Military seemed to be expecting it and simply punched Sherlock in the stomach as hard as he could. Sherlock doubled over, a sound between coughing and retching echoing around the room. As he desperately tried to keep his feet, Sherlock felt his bladder let go and the rush of warm fluid stream down his leg. Moriarty sucked his teeth as if disappointed.
John spent three hours in his bed pretending that he might go to sleep before he dressed himself again and went back to the sitting room. His mobile and laptop were now fully charged and he went back to the blog, refreshing it for the hundredth time since his useless post some hours before.
,” the last word coming out with some disdain. “I don’t know if I have the words for this. But I want to try to explain.”
“Can I kiss you?”
When he returned to the sitting room, John found a familiar sight: painkillers and a large glass of water on the table. This time, Sherlock had provided John with co-codamol (that Sherlock wasn’t supposed to have), correctly ascertaining that paracetamol alone wasn’t going to do it. When John called out to Sherlock, however, he discovered that he wasn’t in the flat. Confused but too achy to do much about it, John sat and put something mindless on the telly.
An indeterminate amount of time later, John found himself in St. James’s Park, sitting on a bench being angry at everyone who passed by. Happy couples, an old man walking a tiny dog, a group of teenagers giggling about something or other. Irrational as it may be, John hated them all. He allowed himself to stew and seethe for a while until the chill in the spring air began to numb his fingers and the tip of his nose. He knew he was being childish and stupid, but he was just so
Sherlock’s grin shifted from forced to genuine. “Thirty-six hours. That would put us at…early on Wednesday, 1am or thereabouts if you’re being precise with your statement. Given the ambient temperature in here, the conversation I overheard Sebastian having with your night watchman, and the fact that Sebastian here still has traces of rain on his coat, I’d wager we’re north of London, probably closer to Manchester. London isn’t due for rain for days. This room is clearly purpose-built but not entirely soundproofed, so it’ll be somewhere on a large plot of land, nowhere downtown. Can’t have anyone hearing all the torture, after all.”
Sherlock’s form went still. “Mycroft told you?”
“John, I should—“
“Don’t get carried away, John. I want my present as well, especially if it’s ‘a bit much’.”
John shook his head. “That’s not what I mean, Sherlock. We spend a lot of time together, but it’s not…it’s not enough. I want to share every single part of my life with someone. I want to be head over heels. I want to take care of her while she takes care of me right back. I don’t just want to go on a string of dates until I’ve struck every woman in London off the list.” John heaved another heavy sigh and brought his hands up to his face, rubbing his palms roughly into his still-closed eyes.
John had almost drifted back off when Sherlock spoke again. “What happened with…” He faded out for a moment, clearly thinking. “The…the one with the nose?”
The weeks following Sherlock and John’s conversation were characterised by tentative gestures and strategic retreats. Sitting on the couch together, Sherlock would shift incrementally closer to John over the course of an evening, ending up pressed fully against him but never looking over at John or acknowledging their closeness. John made a habit of sweeping Sherlock’s hair out of his eyes, ruffling his curls as a sign of affection, and gently scratching the nape of Sherlock’s neck as John asked about the parameters of a new experiment. John knew that Sherlock wouldn’t be the one to make the first move – or rather, the first move
John rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I’m sure I’ll crease up any moment. The bloke who’s been murdering ‘you’ is just so…
“What’s next?” Greg asked. “A football match? Riding the Vampire down at Chessington?”
In the months that followed, John was surprised both by how much and by how little changed between him and Sherlock. John still did the shopping, made the tea, and tidied the flat. Sherlock sulked if they went too long between cases and gave up both food and sleep if a puzzle were interesting enough. Last they heard, Moriarty was in Belarus keeping a safe distance from a variety of crimes and schemes that were clearly his work. They knew it would be foolish to assume they’d be free of him forever, but John breathed a little easier with each passing day. Seeing every CCTV camera in London follow them anytime they left the flat was oddly comforting as well.
“Yeah, well, we are.”
This is Meant to Hurt [link]
Sherlock ducked his head a bit, clearly self-conscious but still grinning.
John was glad that he hadn’t eaten since the night before. He felt overcome by nausea but willed himself not to vomit. He kept his eyes on the screen, watching Moran and Moriarty leave, although not before Moriarty looked at the camera and winked, of course. After Moriarty and Moran left, the only sound was Sherlock, breathing raggedly. John hoped that he would pass out from the pain or from exhaustion, but he was clearly still conscious, at least conscious enough to be aware of how awful everything was.
Mycroft’s expression remained as cool as always, though his eyes flashed dangerously at John’s threat. Even so, Mycroft knew that John’s heart was in the right place, and he needn’t make an enemy of the man who sought Sherlock’s safe return as much as he did himself. “Quite clear, John. Expect updates from my people on the hour, or sooner if merited.”
Sherlock tried to catch his breath after the blow, but found himself unable. For a moment, Sherlock was overcome with a new feeling of panic, but soon realised that he was experiencing a diaphragmatic spasm. He tried to regain control of his mind and body, focusing his energy on getting his breath back. After a few moments, he inhaled deeply and basked in the relief for a split second before Ex-Military was back on him, roughly guiding him over to the wall opposite the door, pushing Sherlock face-first into it. Moriarty delicately stood, turned his chair 90º to the right, then sat down so he could face Sherlock once again.
your emotions would affect your work. That’s the bloody human condition.” John approached Sherlock and tried to make him see reason. “But the Work bit is just an excuse. The real reason you don’t want to get caught up in emotions is because you’d have to truly deal with relationships and the messy world of socialising, and you’d be utterly out of your depth.” Now facing Sherlock, John stabbed a single finger into the detective’s chest. “When it comes to relationships, Sherlock Holmes, you haven’t a single clue.”
“You already are.”
“I don’t want to come yet. I need you. Please.”
“Hey babe,” Moriarty casually sang at Sherlock.
“What, no witty comeback? No joke or threat? I mean, I’m glad you’re not begging or sobbing all over the floor, at least not yet, but nothing at all? I’m disappointed, Sherlock.”
“Sherlock!” he called, as if gently chiding him. “Don’t go leaving us again so soon. It’s time to play and it’s no fun if you’re not here for it.” When Sherlock didn’t respond, Moriarty continued. “It looks like you couldn’t keep your feet. Sebastian here is going to set you to rights so we can have a bit more fun. I would warn you about the pain, but I don’t know what the point would be.”
from harm?” Sherlock stared at John expectantly.
speak. In that case, let’s see if we can draw some more sounds from you.” Moriarty nodded his head toward the door, a motion so subtle it would have been easy to miss. The door opened again and Ex-Military came into the room carrying a chair and a large duffel bag. He placed the chair two metres in front of Sherlock, then approached the kneeling detective, dropping the bag and squatting down to open it. Moriarty grinned and took a seat in the chair, crossing one leg over the other and resting his hands on his legs.
“I—,” he began, his voice coming out rough and uneven. He cleared his throat and tried again. “I don’t know how long I will last, and I don’t know how long Moriarty will keep me alive.” His voice sounded strange in the empty room, but he continued. “I should like to think…that I’ll get myself out of here shortly, or perhaps even that you and my brother will come for me.” He took another breath, shallow and desperate. “But those seem less and less likely as time passes. I want to…explain myself. I want you to understand.”
It was obvious that displaying the tools of his torture was part of the process itself, and Sherlock watched as Ex-Military pulled item after item out of the bag. Most of their uses were self-explanatory, although a few curious pieces were not immediately apparent in their application. He desperately tried to analyse his situation for any deductions that could allow him to escape, any information that could be of use, but there was nothing. Even if Sherlock managed to break free of his bindings, or if he was released as part of Ex-Military’s torture plan, he would still be in a locked room with one exit and two extremely dangerous individuals. There may be others under Moriarty’s control who awaited Sherlock outside the door in case of an escape attempt. There are so many unknowns and he had virtually nothing at his disposal.
Blinking rapidly and looking at where John’s hand rested lightly on his, Sherlock swallowed and tried to put words together in his brain. “That would—I’m—if you—“ He closed his eyes and shook his head, his brow furrowing in frustration and concentration.
John huffed out a laugh. “Right, well…just…it’s okay if you don’t like it, okay? I just want you to know that.”
Sherlock paused for a long moment, then began typing again.
“Shall we do gifts?” John asked, joining Sherlock where he sat on the sofa.
Moriarty shrugged and left the room. Ex-Military removed Sherlock from the table with brutal efficiency. He dragged Sherlock back to the center of the room, where he bound his wrists together behind his back once more. Using the chair as a step stool, Ex-Military then yanked Sherlock’s hands up forcing Sherlock to bend at the waist, affixing the bindings to an anchor in the ceiling. He made sure that the length was just enough so that Sherlock needed to rise up on the balls of his feet in order to relieve the pressure on his shoulders. Ex-Military then removed the chair, the table, and every single item from the room, leaving Sherlock suspended from the ceiling and alone.
Moriarty removed Sherlock’s hood and looked into his eyes. He seemed frustrated. “Sweetheart, I’ll be honest, I’m really disappointed by your performance so far. It has been far too easy to reduce you to a quivering mess. I expected some resistance, some training to kick in or some sort of method that I would have to break through. Instead, the most basic techniques are undoing you with no fanfare at all. Makes me wonder if keeping you around is worth the trouble after all.”
Straddling Sherlock meant that John could control the kiss more effectively, plus he no longer had to crane his neck up at the tall git. He was simultaneously desperate to touch all of Sherlock that he could reach and unable to take his hands away from Sherlock’s face, neck, and hair. Sherlock sighed and trembled as John continued snogging him within an inch of his life. John tried to pour all his affection, his respect, his desire, his longing, his relief into the kiss. He needed Sherlock to understand that this wasn’t a one-off or some trial run. John wasn’t going to flee back to his bedroom and have a sexuality crisis. The past month was plenty of time for John to sort his feelings out and he had no intention of giving Sherlock up now that he finally had him.
Sherlock allowed the smallest of smirks to show on his face. “Why, afraid it’ll get boring?”
The landlady looked guilty. “Sorry, John. Everything happened in just a few seconds, and besides, they had their hats pulled very low.”
John felt his heart ache, but he smiled at his friend. “You’re doing a perfectly fine job so far. Better than me, that’s for sure. I’m shit at this open communication thing.”
“I wanted to tell you that I understand why you pushed me away. I didn’t get it at the time, but I do now.” He could feel Sherlock tensing under his hands. They hadn’t
It took John over an hour to retrace his route back to 221B with a few bags of groceries in tow. Taking a deep breath outside the door to the flat, he finally bit the bullet and went in. After all, maybe Sherlock wouldn’t even be home. It might be fine.
It was on their way to their first crime scene since the doppelganger case that John decided he was sick of dancing around the prospect of something more with Sherlock. The spectre of Moriarty’s inevitable return and the trials that awaited them made John determined to make a move. Although he’d hesitate to scorn the past few weeks they’d spent together, John didn’t want to waste another day. In the back of the cab, he reached over and captured Sherlock’s right hand in his left, lacing their fingers together and resting their joined hands on the seat between them. John pretended not to look at Sherlock, but sneaking a glance, he saw Sherlock’s face break into a grin even as Sherlock continued to stare out the window. John allowed himself a private smile and rubbed his thumb across Sherlock’s soft skin.
John squeezed his hand reassuringly. “You can just nod. If…if the answer is yes. It doesn’t have to be.”
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock muttered almost inaudibly. John, unused to such gratitude, simply put his hand back on Sherlock’s bare foot and gently rubbed it in a gesture of acknowledgment.
It wasn’t clear whether Sherlock had even heard him for a moment, but then he grunted. “Good.”
John offered a wan smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Thank you for that helpful analysis, Sherlock,” he replied, exhaustion creeping into his voice. “It’s just…” John hesitated for a moment, as if unsure about whether to delve further into the conversation. After a small sigh, he continued. “It’s disheartening to realise that I’ll go on being ‘bachelor John Watson’ forever. That this is all there is, and I’ll never find someone to be with that way.” John briefly turned his head to glance sidelong at Sherlock and huffed a humourless laugh. “I wish I could be like you, y’know, ‘caring is not an advantage’ and all that. Thriving by being unattached and emotionless. I just can’t be like you.” He let his head fall back to rest on the couch again, closing his eyes once more.
John licked his lips and laughed again. “Just remembering our first dinner together.”
Sherlock, feeling as though he had made peace with his own demons as much as he was able, decided to change tactics with Moriarty and Sebastian. He knew he would die in this place. It was time for last-ditch efforts. Now tied to a chair (in a blissfully-normal manner), Sherlock pushed his brain into operating at bare minimum levels so he could formulate a plan.
“Rigor mortis suggests the body was placed into a seated position not long after death.”
Sherlock was barely conscious when Moriarty and Ex-Military returned. Once again bringing in a chair and using it as a step stool, Ex-Military released Sherlock from the ceiling and his wrist bindings, and allowed his body to collapse unceremoniously onto the hard floor. Sherlock was too exhausted to groan. His left shoulder felt…wrong. Probably dislocated. He felt the mercy of unconsciousness begin to pull at him again, but Moriarty walked over to Sherlock and slapped him several times rapidly on the cheek.
[Any luck tracking down Moriarty?]
John grinned. “Okay.” Without wasting another second, John dove back in for another kiss, this time pulling Sherlock flush against his own body. He stripped off his own coat and dropped it on the floor, then moved his hands to the bottom of his jumper.
John met Sherlock’s eyes and allowed his smile to fade to something more subtle. “Want one?”
Suddenly, the spell seemed to break and the action of the Yard resumed. Lestrade was barking out orders, telling his people to begin investigating slaughterhouses and other locations that might feature the distinctly industrial-looking space that Sherlock was being held in. While the DI coordinated to follow even the thinnest of leads, John sat motionless, his elbows on his knees and his fingers on his temples as he stared at Lestrade’s computer screen. He saw Moran tie Sherlock’s wrists and secure him to the wall. He saw Moran rifle through his interrogation kit, although what information they might want from Sherlock was a mystery.
Sherlock simply let his chin fall to his chest, the grin still widening on his face. He must’ve looked deranged, a madman with a secret.
John smirked to himself. “Apologies.”
After wrapping up at the church, Sherlock and John followed the body to the morgue in the hopes that a full post-mortem exam would shed some light on an otherwise very thin case. Molly was able to rule out a number of causes of death, but a full toxicology report and other tests would take some time to run. The body was otherwise clean of all trace evidence. No stray hairs, fibers, fingerprints, fluids, or evidence of trauma. It was as if the man had simply stopped being alive.
“Awake already?” John asked, worry creasing his brow. He put his predictable spy novel down on the side table next to his armchair.
“Yes John, do keep up.” Sherlock waved his hand impatiently. “More importantly, if we wish to catch him before he kills every Sherlock-esque person in London, now we know what we need to do.”
As the silence continued to stretch out, John thought about the first time he came here with Sherlock just after they met. He remembered their awkward exchange where Sherlock had told John that he was “married to his work,” trying to rebuff John gently. In spite of himself, John let out a chuckle. Sherlock’s eyes darted over to him.
“I like you out of them.”
John, who had been pacing in increasing agitation, turned to Sherlock, wagging a finger in his face. “Yeah, well, one day your luck is going to run out, Sherlock. It’s going to run out and I –“ John’s voice caught on the last word, his protest choked off by a sudden swell of emotion that made him bring his fist to his tightly-shut mouth as if to stem the flow of words that threatened to spill from his lips. Sherlock bit off a retort at John’s reaction, instead staring at his flatmate steadily without so much as a word. After a moment, John continued, his voice low and ragged. “When your luck runs out, Sherlock, I won’t be able to take it.”
“What d’you reckon, take-away?” John asked.
Sherlock stared down at the tea. Eye contact for this would be too difficult. “I have always been a man of science, logic,” Sherlock began. “You know that I don’t have—that I don’t allow myself emotions. What I said when…when I was in that room…” He paused, then stiffened his spine almost imperceptibly. “I allowed myself to be vulnerable because I thought nothing would ever come of it. You weren’t really there, and I wouldn’t see you again. It was my…goodbye.”
The next morning, John awoke slowly, his memories of the prior evening slotting back into place in jarring succession. The second body, the argument at the precinct and the bigger row at home, then…out of nowhere, lips and tongue and teeth and good lord. It was deeply unsettling to have the hottest experience of John’s life take place between a painful fight and an even more painful conclusion to the evening. Why had Sherlock left without a word? Did he regret what happened? Did he not enjoy it? Was he embarrassed? John’s questions spiraled inside his mind. He began to wonder if Sherlock had been entirely willing. Had John somehow taken advantage of Sherlock? Was it even possible given that Sherlock had initiated every single step?
“It’s a stress position,” John explained. “It’s meant to cause discomfort that gets worse over the time. The longer he’s in the position, the more it will hurt. Some stress positions can even be fatal. This is what the Americans call ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’.”
“I’m going to, Sherlock. We have to. We have to talk about this.” John could already tell this conversation was not going to end with more snogging.
When John’s car pulled up to the still-smoking compound, he leapt from the door before they had even stopped. He spotted Mycroft off to the side barking orders into his mobile. He met John’s eye and simply pointed with a firm nod. John felt hope stir in his gut, but he needed to see Sherlock. Touch him. Anything.
When he finally came to a third time, Sherlock felt as though a great deal of time had passed, although he had no way to know if that was accurate. The room he was in had no source of natural light and no clock, so there was no indication of the time. The space itself had an industrial feel to it, though it was cleaner than most operating theatres. The ceiling was somewhat low with several fluorescent lights throughout the room. Sherlock’s best estimate for the size of the room was perhaps six meters by six meters. There was one door, obviously quite robust.
“John?” Sherlock pressed, failing to keep the edge of panic out of his voice.
Sherlock looked at John and tilted his head in a questioning gesture. “No…?”
Sherlock heard the door shift and groan as someone entered the room. To his knowledge, it was the first time that anyone had come in there since his abduction hours earlier, but he spent some time in and out of consciousness, so he couldn’t be sure.
After ages and ages of physio, Sherlock’s shoulders healed well, with only a minor limitation to his range of motion on one side. His hand improved as well, though much more slowly. It was still unclear whether it would ever be the same again. One afternoon, when John arrived home earlier than usual from his shift, he heard Sherlock practicing the violin. It sounded far better than anything John would ever be able to produce, but he knew it wasn’t up to Sherlock’s standards. He paused on the steps. Sherlock gave an angry grunt, and no more music followed. When John entered the flat, Sherlock was seated in his chair as though he’d been engrossed in some data analysis for ages, but John could clearly see his bow snapped in half peeking out from under the table. The next day, John received a parcel from Mycroft with a new bow, which he snuck into Sherlock’s violin case without a word.
John blew out a breath as they entered the flat. He knew they’d have to make statements and all that down at the Yard eventually, but he desperately wanted some painkillers and some rest. He went up to his room to change into clean, comfortable clothes, gingerly peeling off his shirt. He could already see a bruise beginning to bloom across his left shoulder, wrapping around his back and encompassing his old scar. Testing his range of motion, he could tell that nothing was too badly damaged, but it would take quite a few days for the pain to subside.
“Sorry?” John replied.
“Yes, well, with you hovering over me like some mother hen, I thought it best to avoid re-injury. Besides, my left hand is all but useless like this.” Sherlock held up his hand in demonstration, a splint and tape still evident. He seemed uncomfortable.
[I’m going to come over there and snog you now]
John composed himself and called out, “If you wouldn’t mind coming back later, Mrs. Hudson, we have a lot of snogging to do!”
Mycroft sighed, and John knew everything he needed to know. “I wish I had more for you, Doctor Watson. Moriarty knows how the police and the government, even my humble office, operate. He knows how to avoid us, taunt us, track us, and bait us. I am confident that we will find Sherlock, but it won’t be easy. He may have to…endure.”
They arrived at Angelo’s and took their usual spot by the window. When Angelo greeted the men and brought over a candle, John simply thanked him. Perusing their menus, Sherlock and John sat in companionable silence until it was time to give their order to the waiter. Once the distraction of the ordering was depleted, John found himself staring at Sherlock. The detective was looking out the window, down at his own hands, across the restaurant – anywhere but John. His expression seemed impassive. Having learned many of Sherlock’s tics and idiosyncrasies, he knew that Sherlock’s apparent inattention spoke more of nerves than boredom.
“Yes, John, you were perfectly clear the first time.”
[Your protective streak operates in a predictable pattern, John. Clearly you and my brother have finished doing your ridiculous little mating dance. –MH]
“I see it. Do you see it?”
John huffed out a breath when he realised the body had been in the hot water for an indeterminate period of time: no precise way to determine time of death without more information. Again. As the flashes of the forensics team’s cameras went off over and over, documenting every inch of the makeshift “spa”, John found himself unable to look away from the body. Even if it were clearly not his friend, he couldn’t help but envision Sherlock in the dead man’s place. Evidence markers, a stretcher and body bag waiting off to the side, a flurry of activity all surrounding a disturbingly still Sherlock.
“What is it?” Sherlock asked, his tone suggesting the sharpness of his mind still working underneath the whiskey.
John let his hands fall away from Sherlock’s hair and he leaned unsteadily against the wall. Once he caught his breath, he couldn’t keep the grin off his face. He looked down at Sherlock, knowing that they’d have to talk about what just happened, but too blissed out to be worried about it. Sherlock, however, was staring at the ground, sitting on his heels with his palms on his thighs. After a moment of stillness, John prodded him with a gentle “Sherlock—“ but the detective said nothing. After a moment, Sherlock stood up in haste, tucked himself back in his trousers, then turned on his heel and strode into his bedroom, all without looking at John. John attempted to follow him, but Sherlock slammed his bedroom door. John called out and knocked, but Sherlock only locked the door.
to touch, John found himself unable to stop. His hands touched everywhere he could, practically ripping Sherlock’s stupid sexy coat off of him so he could have better access. Between kisses, John tried desperately to catch his breath. “Sherlock—“
John blinked a few times and sat up a bit in an effort to wake up. “’The one with the nose’? Oh, you mean Abby. Right.” John absently ran a hand over his face and up through his hair. “I don’t know. I liked her. But I think she’d had quite enough of me after a few months.”
“No,” he replied simply, leaning on the N as if annoyed that John even bothered to ask.
Ah. So no one had told him about the video. “There was…” John’s voice wavered and he cleared his throat. “There was a video camera. Live feed. Moriarty wanted us to see what he was doing to you.”
After staring at his ceiling for far too long, John decided that he couldn’t justify lying in bed self-indulgently moping for any longer. Rising and preparing to go through his typical morning routine, he found himself both dreading his next encounter with Sherlock and consumed with curiosity as to how Sherlock would act towards him.
“Molly’s going to have to tell us more.”
When Sherlock’s brain came back online, his eyes darted from John’s face to the ring back to John’s face. After a long moment, John coughed and looked down. “Well, like I said, it’s okay if you don’t like it—“
It turned out that Sherlock was a responsive lover, and John’s ego was well and truly stroked as Sherlock groaned, whimpered, shuddered, and flailed. After a few minutes, just as John was getting comfortable with this particular activity, Sherlock gasped out, “Wait, John—wait.” John immediately let Sherlock’s glorious cock fall from his lips and hand. John could see Sherlock’s chest was heaving as though he’d climbed two dozen flights of stairs.
“They would!”
“True enough.” John then put on his best Sherlock impression. “’You should know that I consider myself married to my work…’” John couldn’t help the ever-widening grin spreading across his features.
“Sherlock,” John began, then cleared his throat again. “I tried so many times to think of what I might say to you if I ever worked up the courage to ask you. I don’t even know if this is something you want. I hope it is.” John swallowed and opened the box to reveal a simple gold band. “William Sherlock Scott Holmes, will you marry me?”
Minutes later, Lestrade came over to check on John. When John shrugged off his inquiries, he changed tack. “What’s with this position they’ve got him in? Surely there are easier ways to tie a bloke to a chair.”
When Sherlock finally began berating John, Mrs. Hudson, and anyone else who had the misfortune to cross his path, John knew it was time to let him take a few cases again. He had been healing well in the month or so since his abduction. John was the only one who noticed how careful he was with his arm movements, or how his left hand would tense and flex when Sherlock thought no one was looking. More than once, John had stolen a glance at the violin, tucked away in its case since…well, since before. Sherlock had finally been able to do away with the splint he wore to allow the hand to heal properly after surgery, but it was too soon to tell if he would regain full function and sensation. For the millionth time, John felt his blood boil, wishing he had five minutes alone in a room with Moriarty. The slippery bastard had escaped and gone to ground before Mycroft’s agents infiltrated the compound, leaving Moran to take the fall (and ultimately, the fatal hail of bullets).
view.
Sherlock’s words bit into John far worse than John would ever admit. It felt as though Sherlock was taking John’s words from their drunken night several weeks prior and weaponising them to strike him where it really hurt. John would probably have had the good sense to feel betrayed if he thought Sherlock truly intended harm. More likely, this was Sherlock being Sherlock, brusque and straightforward no matter the consequences. Even so, that fact didn’t stop John from allowing a biting retort to pass his lips.
Sebastian turned on the device, which came to life with an unsettling hum. He fiddled with the dials, then stepped in front of Sherlock. “Try not to bite off your tongue.” With no further warning, he pressed the wand to Sherlock’s ribs, sending a burning sensation rippling through the consulting detective’s body. Although he couldn’t prevent the shout that arose from the initial pain, Sherlock turned the sound into a chuckle. Sebastian circled Sherlock, shocking him in various areas with higher currents, but Sherlock kept laughing.
Despite being affected by John’s statement, Sherlock scoffed, crossing his arms over his chest for effect. “Oh come now, John, you’d be fine I’m sure. Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t dream of letting out the flat to anyone else even if you couldn’t afford the rent on your own.”
“If we can ascertain that the killer is playing a game with me, that this is more about entertainment than anything else, it can give us a lens through which to view his work.”
John glanced at Sherlock, then closed his eyes and rubbed them with one hand, the other hand planted on his hip in exhausted frustration.
“Oh!” John cried, far too loudly. “Wonderful! He’s got different ears and some product in his hair, so then it’s not a threat on your life. Glad to know we’ve nothing to worry about then. Fancy some telly and a game of Cluedo?”
“Do keep up, John.”
When no reply seemed forthcoming, John tapped Sherlock for another rinse of his hair, then began applying conditioner. He was fine continuing in silence if that’s what Sherlock needed, but after a minute, the consulting detective responded.
The drive, normally four hours, took only three, but John felt as though it were an eternity. He knew that Mycroft’s agents would be there ahead of him, but he had no way of telling Sherlock to hold on just a bit longer. John continued to watch the video feed, but it had been mercifully quiet after Sherlock’s last “interrogation.” John hoped that they would make it in time. Getting this close only to lose Sherlock now would be devastating beyond compare.
“Sherlock, I’m serious. For such a posh git with impeccable grooming, I’m surprised you haven’t at least given it a rinse.”
—“ which was enough of an affirmative for the man in question. John climbed off of Sherlock’s lap, secretly pleased at the tiny whimper that escaped from the detective’s throat as he did so. Dropping to his knees and working on Sherlock’s belt and trousers, John was more than eager to settle the score, so to speak, after their abortive tryst over a month prior. His enthusiasm getting the better of him, John simply got Sherlock’s trousers open enough to pull his cock out, both men sighing at the contact.
Moran apparently had decided to go with a classic, and picked up a long, multi-tailed flogger. He moved with an ease that spoke to full control, calm alertness, and true comfort with what he was about to do. He stood a ways back from Sherlock and delivered his first blow. Sherlock trembled, his back bowing only slightly, and John knew he must be pressing his lips tightly shut given the muffled shout that John could barely hear. John watched Moran pull his arm back for another blow, and when he struck Sherlock again, both Sherlock and John flinched as if both had been hit. Moran continued methodically, changing the force, timing, and location of the strikes, ensuring that Sherlock couldn’t predict where or when or how hard he would be hit next.
“Even if your tone weren’t obvious – and it is – your offer to play Cluedo with me gives away your question as wholly facetious.”
He jammed his eyes shut as though struck.
[There’s no way you deduced anything happening between me and Sherlock from a text message]
“And you’ve yet to go to sleep at all.” Sherlock paused. “You were thinking too loud.”
“Come off it, Sherlock. You know I’m fine treating you at home for all manner of basic A&E injuries, but this is beyond the first aid kit.”
John nodded. “Okay, what about build? Age? Race? Any details you can remember would be helpful.”
[I had figured that out, John. –SH]
John knew he should be thinking about what was happening, maybe trying to slow things down or talk to Sherlock about what this meant, but trying to string two coherent thoughts together felt like walking through waist-deep mud. After a while, he gave it up as a bad job, too overwhelmed by the reality that he was literally inside his best friend. He heard a rustling of fabric and felt Sherlock’s rhythm stutter. When John looked down, he saw the single sexiest thing he had ever witnessed in his life: Sherlock was eagerly jerking himself off whilst sucking John’s cock. “Fuck—Sherlock—“ John gasped, completely overwhelmed. The sight on its own was more than he could take, but the knowledge that Sherlock was just as turned on as John was…well, it wasn’t going to take much to finish John off.
“I’d rather not, John.”
“Yeah, they had those funny old hats like Sherlock had on in the newspaper that time. What’s it called…a deerstalker. They had those on. Couldn’t see much of their faces under those.”
“Come, John, you’ve seen the forensics reports and the crime scenes. We’re not going to catch him with lab results and standard detective work. He’s playing a game that ends with me, and I’m suggesting we skip to the end. Isn’t that what you want? To spare any other
John nodded, encouraging Sherlock to continue.
The last items Ex-Military pulled out of the duffel bag were a protein bar and a bottle of water. He opened the water bottle and held it over Sherlock’s face. “Open,” he commanded, his voice brooking no response other than compliance. For a short moment, Sherlock debated refusing, trying to demonstrate his strength and control even in this circumstance, but he also knew that his mental prowess would not be at its peak if he were severely dehydrated. Food he could do without, and he often avoided it in order to focus on a particularly difficult problem. Water, however, was far more necessary. He made eye contact with Moriarty, then raised his head and opened his mouth. Ex-Military poured sips of water into Sherlock’s mouth as Sherlock gulped it down, taking as much as he was given. Sherlock knew he would have to evacuate his bladder soon. With half the bottle now consumed, Ex-Military placed it back near the bag and turned back to Sherlock.
John stared at Sherlock for a second. “I had no idea you actually intended to follow medical advice.”
Sherlock’s answering smile was soft and genuine. “Alright, perhaps not the best line, but I
John chose not to take the bait. “I’m not talking about my living situation. I’m talking about going back to my life before you. I know your enormous brain has already deduced everything there is to know about what my life was like in the weeks before Mike introduced us. Don’t act like you have no idea that I was about two steps from putting my gun in my mouth.” John’s eyes, faintly rimmed in red and burning with intensity, met Sherlock’s without blinking. John willed Sherlock to understand, to see.
Sherlock opened his eyes and slowly nodded his head, uncertainty creasing his features. John’s answering grin could’ve lit up the entirety of London. Relaxing a fraction, Sherlock turned his hand to lace his fingers with John’s. When their food arrived, Sherlock was too entranced and too happy to remember to argue about eating. Throughout the meal, paying the bill, hailing a cab, and arriving home at 221B, the pair never let each other go.
“People will talk, John. They’ll know.”
“STOP!” he cried out. “PLEASE—” He couldn’t see either of his captors, but he heard small indications of movement. The water had stopped for now. He could’ve cried with relief.
[That’s incredibly invasive Mycroft]
John stopped his agitated movements as if physically struck. “You’re a right prick, you know that?”
Sherlock locked eyes with John, his expression a mix between murderous and ravenous. John couldn’t help but chuckle, then went back to working Sherlock open. Before long, Sherlock was writhing and panting, his cock leaking all over his stomach. John finally couldn’t wait any longer and lined himself up, taking a steadying breath. It wouldn’t do for him to go off like a sodding teenager as soon as he got inside. He pressed the head of his cock to Sherlock’s hole, waiting for the consulting detective to relax and allow the intrusion. Caressing Sherlock’s hips, he rocked slightly, encouraging Sherlock to take him. After a moment, Sherlock canted his hips and John slid a few inches inside with a distinct pop that made both men groan. John held himself steady to allow Sherlock to get used to the feeling. After a few ragged breaths, Sherlock began quietly whimpering, then pleading.
“No,” John confirmed. “They didn’t.”
“Unfortunately, no. We at least have something to go off of, but it will take some work to see if this gets us anywhere. The most important thing right now is to see if the video itself gives us any clues as to Sherlock’s whereabouts.”
The second time Sherlock awoke, he managed to open his eyes, though his brain was still disconcertingly sluggish.
“I am going to unchain you,” he said, his voice reflecting that same unyielding, flat quality. “Although I doubt you have the strength to put up a fight, I would advise against it regardless.”
“I don’t think I can make it to the ambulance by myself, John.”
The approaching sirens offered a small measure of comfort that Mrs. Hudson would be seen to shortly. “The smaller man,” John pressed, “do you remember anything else about him? Even something that seems insignificant could help.”
Sighing with the realisation that this wouldn’t be a single-day case, John stood and crossed his arms over his chest.
Sherlock, grateful for the out, graced John with a small chuckle. He stood suddenly, his sullen affect abruptly replaced with his usual cool demeanor. “Better hydrate, John,” he announced, the note of imperiousness offering a comforting familiarity to both men. “I fear we’ve gone very deep into the bottle indeed.”
“mean—“
“She clearly wasn’t good enough for you, John. I know you find value dating these idiotic women for whatever reason, but it’s unbelievably depressing watching you toiling away in mediocrity in your dating life.”
“Seriously, Sherlock, I don’t want to hurt you—“
John finally allowed himself to close his eyes for a moment, though Sherlock’s contorted and abused body was still there behind his eyelids regardless. Picking up his mobile and dialing Mycroft, John cleared his throat and began to rattle off everything he could think of. “Well, they’re not planning to kill him right away, if ever. They’re giving him water and they clearly intend to feed him later. And this setup with the camera, far too elaborate for just a snuff film. He wants to drag this out. He wants us to see and see and see.”
A delighted “oh!” sounded from the hallway, and quick retreating steps faded into silence. John turned back to Sherlock and was met with a look of mild shock, which went rather well with the flush that went all the way from Sherlock’s neck to the tips of his ears.
That enticing thing turned up after another few brutal days. Sherlock’s phone beeped, and as soon as his eyes fell on it, he leapt to his feet with sheer delight on his face. John looked up from his laptop and knew at once that Sherlock would be heading out the door in about ten seconds – with or without him. John slipped into his shoes and jacket, a mixture of relief, dread, and pure adrenaline awakening all his senses. In the cab on the way to the crime scene, Sherlock was unusually tight-lipped about the nature of the call.
“Sherlock,” John began, his voice soft and low, “if you want me to move out, leave you alone, never speak to you again, then you can tell me that and I’ll go.” Sherlock twisted slightly in confusion and alarm, wincing with the effort but meeting John’s eyes nonetheless. The doctor was quick to continue. “But outside of that, nothing you can say is going to ruin our friendship.” Though Sherlock tried his best to hide it, John could see the way Sherlock flinched at the word “friendship”. John allowed his fingers, still massaging conditioner into Sherlock’s hair, to stray slightly. He traced the shell of Sherlock’s ear, making the detective shut his eyes instinctively. His voice barely above a whisper, John amended his previous statement. “Our relationship.”
The scene John discovered as he entered the flat was horrific. Clutter was the norm, but this was destruction on a massive scale. John’s chair was overturned and the kitchen table was broken clean in two. Papers and bits of equipment were strewn about the area, hardly leaving any part of the floor free of debris. The most disturbing detail was the blood spatter. John’s experience as a soldier, a doctor, and a crime blogger told him that it wasn’t nearly enough blood to put someone’s life in jeopardy, but it wasn’t
Sherlock appeared in the doorway only moments later, still out of breath but now magnificently naked, as was John. The men were drawn to each other like magnets, and resumed the furious snog from moments earlier. Between kisses, John panted, “What do you want?”
A series of gasps and shuddering breaths heralded Sherlock’s release, which made Sherlock nearly levitate off the bed. His hole clamped down on John’s cock, wringing a cry from the man and pulling him along over the edge with Sherlock. It went on long enough that John briefly wondered whether he would ever stop coming, before his mind whited out completely. Trying to catch his breath, he gingerly pulled out of Sherlock and half-collapsed next to him on the bed. After a moment, he glanced over at Sherlock to say something moderately witty but his voice caught in his throat. Sherlock still lay on his back, chest heaving. Although his brow was dotted with sweat, John could discern tear tracks running from the corners of Sherlock’s eyes. He opened his mouth again but thought better of it and gently pulled Sherlock to him, ever mindful of his shoulders. The detective curled into John’s chest, seeming so small in that moment. John snuggled closer, wrapping himself around Sherlock as though to shield him from the world, and stroked his hair until Sherlock fell asleep.
He began to notice something that he thought he was making up at first. Moriarty seemed to be looking directly in the camera now and again. It could have been mere chance the first few times. Then, rotating his body fully and staring into the camera, Moriarty grinned broadly and flicked his eyebrows up, as if to entice or interest a viewer. By then, John was certain of something he suspected from the moment he clicked on the video link: the torture might be for Sherlock, but the video was for John. Moriarty meant what he wrote on the blog. This was meant to hurt. Both of them.
“He’s got Sherlock,” John said into the phone. “Moriarty’s got Sherlock.”
For a while, the only sound in the flat was the crackling of the rejuvenated fire. John stared into the flames for a long while, his mind harkening back to their earlier conversation about John’s love life. He hadn’t allowed himself to think about it in broad strokes because it was, frankly, too disheartening. The reality was that he simply floated from relationship to relationship, hoping each time that this girl would be The One, yet quickly finding that she was just someone who could stave off the loneliness for a while. He wasn’t as young as he used to be, and while he enjoyed his blogging and crime-fighting(ish) and flat-sharing, he knew that he was supposed to be settling down. Wife, kids, suburbs, all that. Some part of him yearned for the simplicity and normalcy of that life. At this rate, though, his “simple life” would be in a care home where the staff changed his nappies.
“No,” Sherlock nearly shouted, then paused. “Not a secret.”
Mycroft hung up without another word and John immediately called Lestrade to update him, then loaded the video on his mobile and raced downstairs to get a cab.
[Very well. When you said you’ve never done that before, do you mean…]
Sherlock sat there for another moment, looking for all the world like he would have a nice long sulk there outside the place he had been held captive and tortured for nearly two days. After a moment, he sighed and hung his head.
John blinked at the message, then looked over at Sherlock. “We’re in the same room, you know. We could talk out loud.” A moment, then another beep.
“You could, you know,” John offered, the words leaving his mouth before he even thought about it. “You can tell me anything.”
“I’ve got you, Sherlock. I’ve got you.” John continued to caress anywhere he could reach, from Sherlock’s chest down to his feet. He encouraged Sherlock to hook his legs around John’s waist, then began tentatively thrusting. Sherlock grunted in what seemed to be discomfort for a moment, then let out a long and low moan. Soon enough, Sherlock’s erection, which had flagged a bit, came roaring back. John’s strokes became longer and surer, his pace steady. He wanted to make this good for Sherlock, better than good, and that meant figuring out how to make his boyfriend (boyfriend!) come so hard he forgot his own name. John grabbed a pillow from next to Sherlock and shoved it under Sherlock’s bum, experimenting with angles until he made Sherlock shout again. A grin spread across John’s features and he made sure to maintain that exact angle, his pace increasingly little by little.
