Once he was by himself again, John's gaze became dull and empty. The entry hall was dark and deserted, and he was all alone. No sound penetrated the space around him. The only thing he could hear was his own breathing. Stuttering. Pained. Gasping for control.
"Both," Irene declared promptly, taking a seat on one of the cream-coloured leather armchairs without waiting for an invitation. She managed not only to lower herself onto the seat in her tight-fitting, white skirt suit - whose understated elegance indicated a four-digit price tag - without flashing anything improper, but also to cross one leg over the other.
Sherlock turned to John now, making his hand slide onto Sherlock's hip, where it stayed. Safe, firm... an anchor in this dark sea of uncertainty.
"John... before you say anything... you're planning on doing exactly the same thing to him," Sherlock remarked with mild cynicism. "You haven't said anything about it, but you've been trying to figure out for days how to get one of your people into his household. Am I right or not?"
"Good morning, Mike," John greeted his friend and stopped beside Sherlock's chair. He put a finger under Sherlock's chin and tilted his face up.
After Mike had finished his little speech, Mrs Turner nodded contentedly and Thomas also appeared to be in agreement with the changes. Eleanor, on the other hand, seemed to be uncertain and looked to Anthea as if seeking her help.
"That's right," Sherlock replied, obviously pleased that John had finally understood. "I don't want you to end up in prison. I want you to stay here with me."
Sherlock tossed all his fears and reservations overboard, infused his gaze with all his emotions, all the love he was capable of, and looked directly at John. "Yes."
Oh yes... Sherlock recognised that well enough. Whenever Mycroft answered in such detail, he was trying to deflect from something else.
John turned onto his side and tried to make out Sherlock's face, but it was too dark. So he simply said, "Yes."
John's eyebrows drew together. "The bombers used their clothes to disguise themselves as employees... we need descriptions of those two men."
After a deep, heart-felt sigh to express his ennui, Sherlock finally reached for the letter. Even though he didn't expect it to be very entertaining, it should be slightly better than watching his pubic hair grow. He slit open the envelope with a pencil without checking the return address, and took out several sheets of paper.
"Yes. But if this takes any longer I may change my mind," John remarked dryly and gave Sherlock a light slap on his buttocks.
"For me – and your house staff. Wouldn't want to you shoot your cook because she put too much salt in your scrambled eggs. Take the magazine out and put it somewhere you won't be able to get to it that fast."
When Sherlock's mouth released his erection, leaving just his tongue dancing around the head, John sent him a questioning look, which was promptly returned. At the same time, John saw Sherlock rubbing the bulge in his own trousers with his free hand. John licked his lips and answered Sherlock's unspoken question with a silent nod.
"Mmmhhh," Sherlock mumbled, his mouth full of potatoes, and continued watching Irene, who was cutting up his meat for him on his plate. Sherlock was perfectly able to do it himself, but Irene – four years older – absolutely worshipped him and loved to mother him. Also, despite his limitless curiosity, Sherlock was basically lazy and careless at heart, and he was happy whenever someone did something for him so that he wouldn't have to do it himself. Especially when he was occupied with more important things – to his mind, anyway – than wiping his nose or tying his shoelaces.
John wasn't exactly sure why... but he didn't want to face Sherlock yet, didn't want Sherlock to see him like this, didn't want to tell him everything right now, didn't want to have to look him in the eye and see concern or pity or... John shook his head. He shouldn't lie to himself. The only thing he was afraid of was seeing no emotion at all in Sherlock's face after telling him what had happened.
"You know what? You were a tad more expensive than I expected. So..." He wet his lips. "I'm not really interested in moving things along in too much of a hurry. I think we should take our time, enjoy things
look (only to be used sparingly as it would otherwise wear out too soon), which had never yet failed to hit the mark and had always gained him everything he'd wanted whenever he'd employed it.
A scream, a sob - half maddening relief, half shooting pain. Tears shot into his eyes, making the silk damp and hot. A feeling like burning coals spread out from between his legs. Cold sweat ran down his back. Had that actually been a blow or just a tap? Sherlock didn't know, but he suspected he was going to feel the echo of it in his balls for quite a while. But all of that paled in comparison to the single pressing desire, the one urgent need...
"Of course I have," John replied with a small, rather unpleasant smile. "I like to know about things I regularly stick my dick into."
Mike groaned and passed his hand over his eyes. "I didn't want to know THAT. I know approximately what John's preferences are. I can do without the details." He pressed his lips together and scrutinised Sherlock's amused expression. "Aside from that. I want to know if he treats you decently - otherwise."
A pleasant shiver rippled down his back as he came to the conclusion that they were probably no longer alive. John was a dangerous man. More dangerous than cocaine, and therefore more attractive to Sherlock.
John was crouching more than kneeling, with Sherlock's lower body in his lap. Sherlock's long legs were spread wide, lying to the left and right of John's body on the mattress. It wasn't possible to go deep or hard in this position, so their joining was more like a sensual rocking, helped along by John's powerful hands holding Sherlock's hips and pulling him in more tightly.
But maximum fun? John doubted it. It went strictly against his principles to pay for something he could just as easily have for free. On the other hand ... the pretty waiters or barkeepers he pulled in restaurants or at parties were rarely completely free either. It never took long for them to grow restless with no compensation beyond free room and board at his house, and they started demanding watches and silk shirts. And most of them became steadily less willing to satisfy his more exotic preferences. John sighed.
it to Susan, and I also know you couldn't help it... Susan probably squeezed it out of you. I know her and I know how she is when she smells a secret. Susan called and read me the riot act, and it was a long one." John took Sherlock's hand and held it fast. "I trust you, Sherlock. I've always trusted you. Yes, I know... that's not entirely true... but it feels like it now, so... just let me finish this thought... this isn't exactly... all of this isn't easy for me. All right?" Sherlock nodded silently. "All right. So I... of course I trust you and you haven't done anything wrong, Sherlock. You've... always done everything exactly right. It wasn't your fault that I didn't tell you. I'm... I was embarrassed. That's why I didn't want you to know. I didn't want you to think... I... that there was... that I wasn't..."
Sherlock flinched a bit and blinked at John crossly over his shoulder. "If by that you mean I should go get a wet flannel and wipe it up, we can
The double penetration, the double stretch, the double stimulation, sent Sherlock into a floaty state that he only started to emerge from when John emptied himself into him with a groan.
Scant seconds later, Sherlock's flies were open as well and his fingers were rubbing his hard penis rather than the soft material of his trousers. Sherlock tilted his head back and a long, drawn-out sigh escaped his lips.
Her smile became a touch frostier. "Then unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't do anything for you. If you don't have an appointment then I can't let you in to see him. I have strict orders to that regard from Mr Holmes."
For days - weeks, even - a heavy blue smog had settled down on their flat as the contents of the cigarillo box were decimated. John had endured it, albeit with quite a bit of tooth-grinding, but in the end Mrs Hudson had added her complaints as well and Sherlock had smoked the rest of his present outside... there had only been a scant few left anyway.
"Open wide," John ordered, a little breathless. "Stick your tongue out and leave it out... until I say otherwise. Got it?"
But Greg still wouldn't let him finish. "Do you know what the worst part is? It's actually okay. It's all right. I know I should do everything I can to put John Watson under arrest... He killed two people - my God!" Greg stopped where he was and dragged both hands through his hair. "But all I can think of the whole time is that that criminal... that Moriarty... practically sat in your front office for months and I... the only thing I want to do is shake John Watson's hand and thank him that you're no longer exposed to a threat like that."
The bomb in Dimmock's car, the bomb at the police ball, and Charlie's death... they were all connected … they had to be connected. There was certain to be only one person responsible for it all. But WHO? Who had such a great interest in forcing John to his knees? And why was that person going to such lengths? A clean shot between the eyes and '
John had taken a jar of vaseline from the sideboard and now returned with it to the bed where Sherlock was lying, to all appearances calmly waiting.
Sherlock had noticed the small lump in John's breast pocket by now, as well as its unusual, long, cylindrical shape.
So. He'd told Mycroft. Now he could sit back and wait for the lecture. It would probably go something like '
"Oh God..." Sherlock croaked. His arms cramped up, his hands tore at his bonds until he felt a cool hand on his overheated cheek. John. He calmed down immediately, nestling into the caress.
"I need to get a closer look at your wound - get your mind out of the gutter," John declared in a feigned teasing tone that probably wasn't fooling anyone. He inspected Sherlock's leg as well as he could. It was a clean shot, straight through, and there still wasn't very much blood. The artery probably really was still intact. At least all the evidence indicated as much.
Braced for the worst, he tore open the bedroom door, not caring what the consequences might be. A moment later, he saw Sherlock draped in John's arms, one of his own arms hanging lifelessly over the edge of the mattress. Stunned, his brain tried to make sense of the tableau, but all it could come up with were comparisons to Michelangelo's '
Maybe he was going to get lucky for once in his life, and his fears would turn out to be nothing but figments of his imagination.
"When will you ever learn to act like a Holmes - or at least like a reasonable human being?" he asked, having a hard time remaining in control.
"All right," John said slowly. "You've had your fun and your petty revenge. But that's enough now. Get going."
"Mike..." John retorted with a long-suffering expression. "Are you going to do that every time someone says
Sherlock scrabbled up onto it, his heart pounding and his erection throbbing, and got into the required position. He used to be so good divining the desires and plans of his clients - but John had been a mystery to him from the beginning. It was true that he'd become better at identifying John's needs and intentions over the past few weeks, but today... today he was at a loss. He had no idea what John was going to do with him. And maybe it was exactly that uncertainty that made him tingle with lust like this. Despite everything, though, it was unpleasant not knowing where he stood with John this time. The same uncertainty, the effect of not knowing what to expect, that had been so exciting and erotic before was now - although still arousing - tempered by a certain disquiet. Sherlock wondered if it were due to the increased familiarity between them which had marked their interactions in the past few weeks that he felt differently now.
Had Sherlock projected his own desires and emotions onto John? Had he simply imagined a presumed romantic motivation behind John's actions?
"The mob," Greg stated flatly, although he was certain that Holmes knew damn well what he was talking about. "The lads are knocking each other off left and right, and having a field day doing it. If it weren't summer already, I'd say Doc Watson was doing some spring cleaning."
Sherlock was possessed of the audacity to actually roll his eyes before answering. "Of course not. You do recall my speciality? Blowjobs? That's what most of them wanted – the rest were happy with a handjob. Once in a while someone wanted a spanking. That's it," he concluded with a shrug.
The almost ethereal tones resonated around the room, detached from string and bow. Yearning and lightheartedness were concealed within them, along with an undefinable sense of recognition. As soft as a thought, the harmonies floated through the air, unrestricted by measures or bars. Sherlock's modifications flowed naturally into the breath of the music. The notes melded together seamlessly, springing from Bach's genius and Sherlock's heart and soul to create a unique declaration of love for John. The tones rose higher and higher, purer and purer, jumped for joy with a lightness they'd never known before, fanned out and found each other again, before they finally joined together in one last, tremulous, almost surreally sweet sound.
"Nothing... just that she hung out with some odd blokes back then. First she let that Powers do her, then she was always gadding about with that queer fellow, what's his name..." Patrick frowned and scratched his head.
' in an endless litany. The muscles of his arse had clamped down, virtually milking John's orgasm out of him. Had he fainted or something? John felt Sherlock's neck for his pulse. He was relieved to find that everything was in order.
Sherlock was truly the unsurpassed master of this kind of sexual foreplay. His tongue was soft and malleable, yet firm and certain of its goal. He used just the right amount of pressure to fan the flames of desire even higher.
John knew what he'd promised Sherlock, but there had simply been too much to do. He hadn't been able to get his head clear. But now it was Saturday, their most urgent business was all taken care of, and Mike could handle the rest himself. John therefore didn't have so much as a twinge of a guilty conscience when he made a point of placing his phone firmly on the table and turning it off.
Why didn't Sherlock make a sound? Why couldn't he hear anything from that bloody sod? He couldn't keep his mouth shut otherwise... why didn't he bite someone again? Why didn't he call out his name?
Lestrade nodded as well. "Drugs, running guns... like you said, the usual. He's supposedly got half of Scotland Yard on his payroll." He finished his water and, after looking around, set his glass on the mayor's desk. "But the interesting part is..." Lestrade chewed briefly on his lower lip. "This bloke, Mike Stamford, was his advisor for years … his right-hand man, if you will. But recently, there's been word that
Rather than lying in his own comfortable bed - as John had instructed that he be told to do - he'd fallen asleep on the couch. John sighed. Then he went closer, sat down on the edge of the coffee table, and watched for a while as Sherlock's chest rose and fell and his breath passed over the plump, slightly parted lips and was sucked in again. He observed Sherlock's cheeks, pink with sleep, and the unnatural angle of his back and neck.
The sulphurous smell of a burnt match. The crackle of the wick when the flame reached the wax. The ropes around his wrists and ankles. The cool sheets beneath his naked body. The rustling of clothing whenever John moved.
John shook his head, smiling gently. "I'm not going to punish you, Sherlock. I have something else entirely in mind." Then another thought occurred to him. "Where's Mike, anyway?"
"Hmm." Mike made a neutral sound, taking a seat in the leather armchair. "I saw on my way over that they've put up the first campaign posters."
“Oh, yeah,” John panted when Sherlock's body tightened magnificently around his erection following the spank. “Okay,” John growled, his voice filled with heat. “Again.” He hit him again. And again those muscles squeezed his hard cock. “Mmmhhh... just like that. Do it again. Tense up your muscles... go on... again... yeah … again … you're so good at that... that's... oh yeah... oh … yes... that... FUCK!”
"No more interruptions!" John barked, not sparing so much as a glance for his men. He knew his orders would be carried out.
"Long enough," John answered evasively, but with a gentle smile, handing Sherlock his shower gel. "Here..." he said, winking. "You can wash my back."
"And why shouldn't he be," John whispered back, unconcerned. "It's a free country. As long as he doesn't start making trouble again..."
When John inserted his hard cock between Sherlock's thighs, pressing against his taut, stretched testicles, Sherlock let out a lust-filled moan of relief. John's fingers massaged and rubbed his erection while he fucked his thighs with short, firm thrusts, hitting Sherlock's sensitive balls in a highly arousing way every time. Sherlock's arousal quickly spiralled upward into an ecstasy that nearly overwhelmed him, but the tie that still bound his testicles, pulling them back away from his body, made it difficult to reach the orgasm that would set him free. Everything was so sensitive... so swollen... the painful pull... the tightness... the pressure... the incredible hotness... all at the same time, and it made his entire body tremble, catch fire, and burn.
When he opened his eyes again some time later, the vaulted brick ceiling was still above him. It wasn't as if he believed in a heavenly paradise with clouds and angels, but he had imagined the afterlife would be a little different. And then John's face invaded his field of vision, and he started to suspect that something hadn't quite gone the way he'd intended. However, he didn't know yet whether that was good or bad. Then he abruptly became aware of the pain in his leg and he knew he was still alive. And that John was too.
Sherlock's arms yanked at his bonds as he screamed at the top of his lungs. Pain pulsed through his erection, which didn't become one whit softer, and even as the soreness slowly ebbed away, the lust-fuelled urgency returned to his groin.
"Not always," Sherlock admitted, even as his hips jerked upwards to press against the crop. A languid attempt to seek further friction and stimulation.
And if they weren't talking about him... well... then this was a unique opportunity to set things straight. It still bothered him that John had glossed over the true nature of their relationship in front of Mycroft. It was high time to come clean with his
Sherlock hadn't done anything more than wrap the sheet around himself before leaving the bedroom, shortly after John. Since then, he'd been sitting at the top of the stairs, trying to catch whatever snatches of conversation he could. But the room John and his brother were in was at the other end of the entry hall, and Sherlock still had no idea what the two men were talking about.
Was it the deceptive lighting of the summer twilight? Was it just wishful thinking on Sherlock's part? Was it a mirage of light and shadow? Was he the victim of an optical illusion? Or had John's gaze really rested on him lovingly for the bat of an eyelash? On
Again that strange look for the length of a single heartbeat, and then Sherlock slipped out of his jacket the rest of the way, tossed it carelessly over the now-empty chair, and began to unbutton his shirt at a snail-like tempo.
"I'm not going to say it again, Sherlock," John said, still with that cool detachment that was worse than any screaming and ranting would have been.
Adamant. Almost concerned. Sherlock would have liked to sigh, but that might knock everything out of balance. So he didn't.
"Wroooong," Moriarty sang. "Lions aren't dogs. Lions are members of the Felidae family." When he was met with nothing but uncomprehending looks, he waved his hand in disgust. "Whatever. Tie his arms behind his back and keep him still. Especially his legs. I'll take care of him myself... let's see what else he's got with him aside from his phone." Moriarty handed Sherlock's phone back to Mary - the same phone he'd just used to place the call to John Watson. He stepped in front of Sherlock and stared down at him. "Quite sporting of you to have called your Johnny so often. So many entries on your call log... must be true blue doodle-dee-do love," he taunted.
John's hands caressed Sherlock's thighs before pulling his buttocks apart so that he could see the handle with his initials better. His gaze became soft, almost reverent, before his fingers slid over the end of the plug and tapped it softly. Sherlock stretched toward him luxuriantly, and that greedy gleam appeared in John's eyes once more.
"Working!" Sherlock yelled. "I call it WORKING!" But if he'd thought the logic of his response would make John see reason, he had another think coming.
John didn't know exactly what role he played in this scene. Was he the high priest intended to enact the cult ritual, prepared to initiate something holy... or was he about to defile something exalted, to tear it down to his level and desecrate it over and over again? No matter what it was... it was bloody hot.
"I... don't know," Holmes confessed, looking John in the eye. "I do not know. I presume something like a jammer was used that was set to the frequency of the cameras."
"I know," John said softly, tugged at his hair, kissed him on the cheek, and did a double-take. "Hey... don't cry," he scolded him tenderly. "You know that turns me on," he complained, half joking, only to then ask with concern, "What's wrong?"
John's burning gaze focused on him, yet all of Sherlock's attention was on the hard, painfully throbbing shaft. John bit down on his lips and his entire body tensed. The throbbing in his groin slowed but became more intense.
"Poor boy," John mocked him, gloating over the beads of perspiration on Sherlock's forehead. "Still not enough? Are you still not ready to beg for mercy?"
," Mike hissed. "You're going to do the right thing for once in your life! You're going to see to it that Sherlock goes to hospital, right now. And then you're going to take responsibility for what you've done. Do you hear me, John? I'm going home to my wife now, and don't you dare call me. You can find your own way out of this mess. Have I made myself clear enough?"
Sherlock's eyes twinkled with amusement, but his mouth remained shut. He lowered his head at a deliberately measured pace over John's lap and pressed his lips against the head of John's penis. John unconsciously held his breath.
"Sherlock," John said gruffly, moistening his suddenly dry lips with his tongue. "You don't know what you're saying."
"I warned you," John said coolly. "Keep a lid on that mouth of yours and don't try to play me for a fool. You'll regret it in the end. I know how to arouse unquenchable desire, but I also know how to cause unbearable pain. There's a good reason they call me
"Très bien, monsieur. Bien sûr, monsieur. Je vous en apporte une assiette tout de suite." He bowed briefly and was rewarded with a bright smile.
"You can't be serious!" Sherlock smouldered. "You know perfectly well I'll die of curiosity before then!"
An orderly entered Sherlock's room and set that morning's pills and a letter onto the little table beside the bed.
Sherlock caught John's gaze and held it firmly, took a deep breath and then spoke to him as if to a small child: “Because... I... can't.”
At some point he would certainly allow Sherlock to get him off with those talented feet alone. But not now. He really didn't have time for it that morning.
John was too shocked to even begin to react to that. It wasn't until Sherlock cuddled up against him again like a kitten – with a sated, almost happy smile and a tired yawn, nestling against the arm that still rested on his shoulders – that John's brain came back online and began to understand what had just happened.
' John's grandmother had always said. John had stopped believing long ago. And yet, here was Sherlock, who had fallen into his lap like a silver dollar in the fairy tale. John was forcibly reminded of the many times Sherlock had been there for him... had done things for him... had been prepared to make sacrifices as if it were a matter of course, all but giving up his entire self in a way that nothing else even came close to.
"No... I promise you, I acted the same toward him as I always do. I was my usual charming self," he added with a lopsided, unhappy grin.
"Oh," Sherlock said as if he understood, even though it was apparent that he'd neither understood Mike's question nor his indignation. "I was merely being polite. Shouldn't I have been?"
Astonishment and merriment brightened Lestrade's face. His mouth split into an incredulous laugh. "YOU? That was
'. Sherlock was rarely wrong, and no one had contradicted him - neither Moriarty himself nor that Mary. What had Sherlock called her? Miss Moran? Was she related to Sebastian Moran in some way? Maybe his wife? That would explain quite a few things. In other words, she was out for revenge along with Moriarty.
He ground his teeth inwardly. That wasn't going to happen to him a third time. He wasn't going to let himself be played for a fool again.
Before Sherlock even realised what he was doing, his hand had wrapped itself around the door handle, pressed it down, and opened the door to John's bathroom.
Sherlock's breath caught and he flung his eyes wide open again. Was John really going to? No... or... yes? He watched raptly as John's hand moved in between his spread legs... closer and closer to his erection, glistening with precome... and then – a gentle bump, a deft twist, a virtually endless shiver running down Sherlock's back, and the cigar was coated with the proof of Sherlock's arousal.
"Busy..." the doorman tried again, his voice fading, just before noting with relief that his boss was coming down the stairs. He tried to give her an unobtrusive hand signal.
"No... I..." Sherlock stammered with difficulty. His tongue was no longer fully under his control, unable to form the simplest words. "That belongs to..." He paused and gasped for breath along with the words. That infernal finger was making it almost impossible for him to think. John, on the other hand, was enjoying seeing Sherlock struggle and didn't even consider for a moment making things any easier for him.
"Everything all right?" John murmured softly when Sherlock didn't make any more sounds. Sherlock nodded, and John ghosted a kiss over his sweaty temple, whispering, "You're doing brilliantly... just a couple more..."
"All the better for me." Moriarty nodded to his henchmen. "Unbutton his shirt and take his trousers off. I want to know if there's anything interesting to see under there. And go through his pockets while you're at it. I don't want any nasty surprises later." He watched the proceedings for a while. "Shoes first," he snapped at his men. "For heaven's sake, I'm surrounded by eejits! And a little faster if it's not too much trouble. The Doc has a bit more of a trek to the rendezvous point than we do, but I don't want to be late for our date." His gaze swept over Sherlock's half-naked body. "Oh ho..." he whistled softly between his teeth. "What have we here? Oookay..." he drawled. "We're going to take a little detour on our way to the park. I need to pick something up from my flat."
Mike strolled along the hospital corridor, humming softly to himself. He was carrying a flower bowl with an arrangement of orchids in one hand. Susan had ordered it several days ago, and now that it was ready Mike wanted to bring it to Sherlock personally. He knew John wasn't going to be stopping by until later, so he only knocked perfunctorily before opening the door.
Greg shrugged his shoulders. "Months," he affirmed and dug his teeth into his lower lip. "I have a thing for these suits..." He ran a finger down Mycroft's waistcoat. "They're pure porn for me... and when you wore a watch on a chain..." He shook his head, chuckling. "Those were my happiest moments. I never would have thought... never even hoped..."
"What are you doing?" Sherlock asked. He hated asking questions like that - it almost made him physically ill - but John was being very, very opaque today.
"Stuff and nonsense," Mrs Turner waved off his objection and put a slice of bread on the serviette beside his plate. "What do you think Mr Watson will say to me when he comes home and finds you nothing but skin and bones?"
Franco shifted from one leg to the other. "Didn't use to bother you," he said. "Doc's bent himself."
"You don't need to bother with all that," John answered dismissively, although he did stop and point to a neutral door on the far end of the entry hall. "That's the way to the
!" John declared firmly, his cheeks betraying a faint flush. "What do you think of me? No, never mind," he retracted his question promptly, brushing it away with a wave of his hand. "Don't say it. Otherwise I might end up shooting you after all, and that would only confirm your opinion." He scraped his hand down his face, appearing very tired all of a sudden. "Lie down so I can take a look at you. I want to know how much damage I did." He pointed at the bed.
A smile flickered across John's lips at Sherlock's halting, tentative answer, and he breathed out another kiss over a different injury on Sherlock's shoulder. Although Sherlock seemed to enjoy it, his posture was still quite stiff.
– as she continued to jokingly refer to his visits. Although Sherlock never asked her to do so, she never booked another client for him on those days. They didn't discuss it, but Sherlock was certain that she thought she was doing him some great service with this arrangement.
His last piece of tail had had to be eliminated a few weeks ago, as he hadn't understood when to open wide and when to keep his big mouth shut. The fucking slut had thought he could rat him out to the police. Too bad for him that most of London's officers were on John's payroll anyway, regardless of what it said in their contracts. The little cocksucker hadn't remembered how long the mob's arm was. And it was very long.
"You're a grown man..." Mycroft declared. "If you want to leave, I'm not going to stop you. I simply wanted to make you aware of the consequences of your actions."
John smiled, rubbing Sherlock’s back in soothing circles while Sherlock nuzzled his way into John’s neck like a sleepy cat.
"Yes..." Mycroft inhaled loudly through his nose, and his lips twitched. "It concerns a rather delicate matter." As Lestrade continued to watch him with an open and expectant look on his face rather than responding, Mycroft continued, "I must ask you not to undertake anything in regards to this Mr Sigerson."
"Sorry, Mr Watson," Moran said in a flat voice, lowering the arm with his pistol. "Couldn't warn you in time. He always kept a gun in a compartment under his desk. Had to be faster than him... He would have had you otherwise."
"I'm very sorry," he said with a fake smile. "Wrong answer." He got up from the bed and watched Sherlock with a gaze that was heavy with distant, cool appraisal.
a very nice man," he said to the empty spot where John had been standing moments before. "And I know that was a lie too." He lowered his head, and his gaze fell to the floor, where the used condom had landed. His eyebrows knitted themselves together in confusion.
I can't keep living like this. I never agreed with you joining the mob, but you didn't listen to me. You never listened to me. I wanted you to quit, to take up your studies again, because I knew the company you were keeping wasn't doing you any good. And my fears were justified, as it turns out – you've changed. I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen to me. Again. You're not the witty med student I fell in love with. You've been reduced to nothing more than a stooge. A criminal with one foot in prison already. I don't want to go on like this. So I'm leaving. I've taken what's mine. I'm leaving the unsuitably expensive gifts you gave me when we were together. They're on your night stand.
John forced the gleaming metal sound through the small opening, this time employing a slight twist, and pushed it slowly but surely deeper with gentle pressure.
"How? Easy. You're a bloody terrible liar," John said with a lopsided smile. "I've told you that before. I always know when you're lying. Your face, your body language... all that might not give anything away... but your eyes... your eyes always tell the truth. Your eyes can't lie."
"But it's just a body ... just a shell... it's not me, it's merely a relatively unimportant vessel ... a means to an end.
"All right," John said and drew deeply on the cigar until the tip glowed bright red and kept glowing even after John had taken the cigar out of his mouth.
, after all? His lips, which had just burned with heat and desire a moment ago, suddenly felt cold and numb. But before Sherlock had a chance to ask John anything, a rather corpulent man with glasses and a double chin came in, only to stop in the doorway. Sherlock blinked in confusion. That wasn't exactly the way he'd pictured the man John might have at his side.
Sherlock quickly ran through all the weapons John had at his disposal in the bedroom. Mike had taken the revolver... there weren't any open blades in the room other than a knife like the ones used by mountain climbers to quickly cut through ropes in an emergency. Maybe a nail clipper... but he didn't have to worry about things like that. Sherlock briefly thought of the two Chinese vases. Shards could be dangerous. He'd have to watch out for those. A chair leg could do some serious damage if it were wielded against the neck or the head. Then there was the risk of strangulation... by hand, or with one of the bondage ropes... even a pillow held over the face could lead to suffocation.
"That wasn't Mr Watson," Jacques retorted bitterly. "That was HIM." His mouth twisted with contempt.
“I can't believe that,” she replied, taken aback. “He came highly recommended.” She tilted her head a bit to the side. “And he's not exactly cheap.”
It shouldn't be a problem for him to pick up that box with its contents, take it downstairs, and toss it in the bin. But he couldn't bring himself to do it. That violin had meant too much to him... he'd placed too many hopes in it... there were too many memories wrapped up in it... but too much pain as well.
The grinding stopped abruptly. "Don't rush into anything," Mycroft said calmly, although it sounded a bit forced. "I'll take it under consideration."
He didn't blame John. He understood what John was trying to do with his refusal to help. Sherlock was supposed to prove himself. Show his own strength. Stand up to his brother on his own. He did feel a little bit abandoned, as John couldn't know - couldn't even suspect - what this
It was only now that John fully comprehended what he'd committed in this room. The force of the realisation made him stagger.
," a cousin had once said to him when he'd tried to explain the complexity of the piece to her. Sherlock had always been especially proud of his exacting and technically flawless technique, such that Bach's
John felt very cold at Sherlock’s carefully unaffected manner because there was no denying: Sherlock was more than a little bit crestfallen although he tried to hide it. John knew him well enough to see through the false bravado. Sherlock had opened up about something deeply personal, placed his trust in John and John had stomped on it. There was no other way to put it. Stomped. Like a stupid, idiotic elephant.
An understated black limousine stopped directly in front of the main entrance to the house. The back door opened, and John got out.
John started to get a very bad feeling. "You..." he said in a dangerously quiet voice. "You have something to do with the mess with Charlie and Albright's nephew... You... you're behind everything! You're trying to use this to get rid of me, aren't you?"
Mycroft propped his elbows on the table and buried his face in his hands. Then he straightened up again, undid the first two buttons of his shirt, picked up the glass, leaned back in his chair, and took the first sip. He closed his eyes, waiting for the gentle burn of the alcohol to drive the chill out of his bones which was making him shiver from the inside despite the summer heat.
John pulled him closer, kissed and nipped greedily at the proffered lips before pushing him away. "You're going to be the death of me," he panted, licking his upper lip with lustful desire. "All right, fine - you asked for it. Take off your clothes. I want to see you naked."
,' but Albright didn't react to the barb. His face was bone-white, with just two spots of high colour on his cheeks.
"We'll remember next time," John suggested, trying not to let it show how relieved he was to hear Sherlock speaking again.
?" Sherlock cut across his brother's wall of words. "JUST NOW?" he repeated. "Is it normal practise for you to hold meetings with him in the middle of the night? Do you always investigate bombings at this hour?"
When he'd just stood there gaping at her in disbelief – completely unable to move or even understand that his suffering was almost at an end – she'd laughed and said, "Come on, get going, my little virgin. Get to work! The clock is ticking – you'd better start getting ready for your
Sherlock could do nothing but gape at him with his mouth hanging open in the face of such heresy. In the meantime, John removed several tools from his trouser pocket, laid them out on the side table, and took a seat in the armchair he'd set up.
Once he could halfway trust his body again, he pushed his finger in even further, gently yet firmly, until he felt a slight rounding under the tip of his finger. He waited until he heard a soft sob of relief, then pushed his finger in a tiny bit further and rubbed relentlessly across the countless nerve endings of Sherlock's neglected prostate.
Sherlock lay down on his back on top of the table, stretched his arms out over his head and grasped his lower arms with his hands. He bent his splayed knees and placed his feet flat on the floor. Fortunately, the table was just the right height for him to do so, and long enough that Sherlock fit on it more or less comfortably.
Thomas forced down a big bite of his apple and then said with a broad grin: "Ever thought of the fact that only half the stains are from Sherlock? I'm sure the boss is doing his fair share."
"Thank you!" Sherlock said, but he didn't really sound grateful. "And when John comes home... don't interfere."
“You will anyway, whether I give you permission or not,” John answered placidly. “And set up a couple of appointments for him with my tailor... he'll need a few nice suits.”
As it was, he sat down unsuspectingly on one corner of the couch, and Sherlock immediately glommed onto him as if his life depended on it. With one hand, he held fast to the lapel of John's jacket, while his head sank onto John's shoulder. He pulled in his legs and wriggled around on the cushions until he was lying half on John and half on the couch. John was amused to be used as an oversized pillow and began absently to comb through Sherlock's disorderly, sweaty curls.
"Again," he ordered roughly. His fingers sought and found the unruly curls, delved into them, pulled and yanked, and Sherlock moaned again. More vibrations, more pleasure, more urgency ... "Again!" Moans, vibrations. Tightness. Heat. Pressure. John's hips jerked forward, deeper, ever deeper into that sinful mouth...
That blasted Mycroft! It was clear that his thrice-cursed brother was somehow going to manage to rub Sherlock's nose in the fact that he was the eternal loser of the Holmes clan. Sherlock inhaled the smoke as deep as he could, even as his agitated steps slowed on the manicured lawn. Bit by bit, he calmed down. Bit by bit, the anger and pain faded away. Bit by bit, he was able to think clearly again. What was it that John had said?
"Oh, that's good!" Mike cried in indignation. "That's a good one! Because he wouldn't let me! If it had been up to me, this door would have been broken down three hours ago. But no..."
"If you've already done all the research on the internet," John began with poorly concealed sarcasm, "then you may have noticed that there are certain things you need to watch out for. To be safe. So that nothing happens."
Now it was Mike's turn to frown. "You mean after the Schultz brothers left that slaughterhouse scene behind on your instructions? Yeah... could be. I think that's right," he replied a little uncertainly. "But do you really think there's a connection?" he asked, his scepticism clear. "It seems a bit far-fetched."
"Fine, all right. If it makes you happy," Sherlock said with an indulgent sigh. "If you ever attempt to attack or injure me, I will defend myself. Happy?"
Less than fifteen minutes later, Sherlock was kneeling naked on the seat of the couch, his legs spread, holding himself steady with both hands on the backrest. His arse was straining back toward John's passionate thrusts, and the tip of his stiff member tapped against the aforementioned backrest in time with their motions. Sherlock moistened his parched lips. The fleeting yet solid contact of his hot, swollen glans against the cool leather of the couch was both exquisite and agonising, and was hopefully going to continue for a while.
John took his clothes off, pumped his own stiff cock a few times, and then settled himself on a pillow behind Sherlock and wrapped his arms around his upper body. He looked with lust-filled, greedy eyes at Sherlock's hard, pulsating erection - still waiting for satisfaction - and sucked an open-mouthed kiss onto the alluring, white curve of the neck in front of him.
"You're only saying that because your brain is drowning in serotonin and endorphins," Sherlock murmured against his chest. He sounded sleepy. "Do you feel better now?"
"I shouldn't..." Mycroft started to say but didn't get any further because Greg's tongue slipped between his lips. "...come here to your place..." Greg kept kissing him relentlessly, but Mycroft was stubborn too. "… so often."
"I'd miss you too," John whispered gruffly, once Sherlock let him have enough air to do so. "Terribly."
"How are you?" Sherlock asked softly. It sounded as if he weren't sure whether the question was allowed.
It was late, but not yet past normal business hours. Lestrade was used to worse from his work with the police.
"You're the only one who's ever done something like that for me," Sherlock answered, burying his face in the crook of John's neck. "And I thought... I thought it was a one-off... that you'd never do it again."
All of a sudden, John didn't want to wait a single minute more. He didn't want to revel in it any longer. He didn't want to wring out the pleasure from every single second. The urge to
Just as the door flew open, Mr Glendale said, "Until I'm ready for the second round..." No one would ever know how that sentence was supposed to end, for the words froze in Glendale's throat at the sight of John Watson.
The corners of John's mouth twitched with reluctant amusement at the simple greeting. Without responding, he came further into the room, took out a thin, rolled-up file folder from the inner pocket of his coat, walked past Sherlock without so much as glancing at him, and tossed the folder onto the bed. Then he took off his coat, let it fall carelessly onto one of the armchairs, and remained standing next to the chair. Only then did he turn his full attention to Sherlock, who had an ominous sense of foreboding.
"Perhaps," was Mycroft's simple answer. "If there's no other way. But first and foremost, I would merely like to initiate a phase of peace and quiet for London."
All of a sudden, Sherlock thought he understood what was going on. A smile stole across his face. "Is this your way of apologising?"
before disappearing into John's office without so much as a good-bye kiss. John was in a hurry, and Mike was nagging at him, so all John had been able to do was ask Mike to keep an eye on Sherlock, which he agreed to.
A whimper escaped Sherlock's lips before he was able to answer. "No... I haven't earned it." The words burned in his throat, droned in his ears, and made his penis swell up just a little bit more.
"The yellow looked like shite," Sherlock explained in passing. "I had it painted over. Billy has been quite helpful."
Greg had already opened his mouth to reply, but he snapped it shut again. Was that an actual compliment? Or even an attempt at a... come-on? What the
John cautiously pulled the metal rod back out of Sherlock's penis, and Sherlock gasped. Once the rod was completely removed, Sherlock's cock twitched slightly once and the small opening closed up again.
Mycroft Holmes stood in Hyde Park, off to the side of the groups of people enjoying the free hot rum punch being offered to the guests of honour, their expressions relaxed and their cheeks red. As for Mycroft, he had already done his mayoral duty by opening the ridiculous fun fair which cast its blight on Hyde Park every winter. The other VIPs and guests were therefore - mercifully - leaving him in peace, and Mycroft was finally able to take care of this call after having tried in vain for several days to reach
"Yeah, those are real," John said, smiling as well. "You're free to use any of them - same as you're free to use anything in the house."
"Deeper... DEEPER! Yes – right there... right.. there..." Sherlock gasped, stretching his upper body and curling forward a bit to give John more room. John's other hand held him fast by the shoulder. A feeling of safety and security flowed through Sherlock, his mind finally let go, and when John introduced a third finger, lust and ecstasy pulsed sluggishly through his lower body like dark honey, pulling him along, further and further, deeper and deeper, more and more...
"You were just boasting of your creativity," he taunted provocatively. "Prove it," he whispered, rubbing against John in an unambiguous manner.
that he was the mayor's protégé. At least his status had now been made official by his new title, and the suggestive innuendos - which weren't meant to be taken altogether seriously - had ceased.
He looked around. The space next to him in the bed was empty, and he couldn't see or hear John anywhere.
"Don't ask, John," Sherlock cut him off sharply. "You promised. Just answer the question: who has access to the recordings?"
That seemed to be the end of Sherlock's patience, as his expression changed suddenly to become alert, distrustful, and closed.
While Mycroft was still standing half naked in his office with his phone in his hand, Greg had already put on his trousers and lit another cigarette, which he was smoking in short, frantic puffs. His expression was harsh and stand-offish.
A week after the mayoral election, Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade strode into City Hall. A single, courageous ray of the setting sun had struggled through the rainclouds, causing the crests of the waves on the Thames to glitter like diamonds for a brief moment.
"Where'd they have the stuff from?" Mike wanted to know. "Did our guys siphon some off to sell to those scumbags?"
After that, Mycroft had stubbornly cloaked himself in silence and Sherlock had tried to forget the entire incident – with less than stellar success.
"If you did what I said more often you wouldn't have that pain in your neck right now," John stated. "And now come on. Up with you." He stood up and held out his hand for Sherlock. Sherlock took it and stood, ending up directly in front of him rather more quickly than he'd expected, looking down at him through half-lidded eyes.
A pleasant shiver ran down Sherlock's back, ending up between his legs, where a certain part of his anatomy twitched hopefully.
John sighed. "All right, fine. But Sherlock... trying to make your brother think we fucked three times already this morning... he didn't buy that for a second."
Moriarty gave a short laugh. It rang through the stone hall. "You see, Sebastian was all ready with his people. Ready to switch out the urns. Imagine his surprise when another gang did exactly the same thing. As they weren't
"I'm afraid I don't understand the question," he said with a hint of the same aristocratic attitude he sometimes displayed.
With a queasy feeling in his stomach, Sherlock considered what means Mycroft would employ to get his hands on Sherlock again and bring him to heel. He choked on a lump in his throat. Would the entire nightmare start all over again? Were all the games of hide-and-seek through the years in vain after all? The room around him began to spin again. He dug his fingernails painfully into his thigh until his lungs were able to fill with oxygen once more.
"Let me... I... please let me..." he stammered, gulping in air. Why was speaking such an effort all of a sudden, one he hardly felt up to? "Let me come... let me come... please..." He bit down on his lips as his neglected cock twitched and pulsed one more time. "Please fuck me. Fuck me properly ... let me ... I have to touch myself... it's too much ... much too much ... I can't anymore... I beg you..." With a concerted effort, he directed his gaze directly at John, tears of humiliation gathering in the corners of his eyes. "Mercy, John..." he whispered softly. "Have mercy on me and fuck me so hard I won't be able to sit for a week."
, WRONG. And yet his body interpreted the act in its own way, reacting to the pain and the rough stimulation in the only way it knew how to: with arousal.
Sherlock's disarming honesty made John shake his head. “You should know by now that I never deviate from a plan once I've made it.”
John wasn't entirely unhappy about the fact that all of the top-ranked mobsters were gathered here on neutral ground to follow the election returns and projections on the television in one of the lounges. If it hadn't been for this engagement, he would have had to invite them all to his house for a similar party … with free drinks and the BBC on the widescreen. He'd been spared that fate thanks to the enchanting Clarissa and the man who was head over heels for her, Francesco.
Secretly, John took a deep, measured breath. His mob cohorts didn't care about his sex life as long as they were afraid of him and he was successful. Just that long, and not one second more. But he'd have to keep a closer eye on this Albright. John had absolutely no idea why the man was up in arms all of a sudden. There'd never been a problem with him before - he'd had control of the borough of Southwark for years under John's command, and he'd always done a solid job. But the night of the election, when it had looked like the reins were slipping out of John's hands, it had been Albright who had let the first arrow fly. Tonight was the second. What was the saying? The first hit goes on the opponent's account, the second on one's own. John gritted his teeth. He'd be damned if he'd let it come to a third.
"He was quiet as a lamb the whole time... and then all of a sudden..." one of the men murmured in a low voice.
"What?!" There was a hint of panic in Sherlock's horrified cry. "Oh no... don't you dare ... don't even think about letting me hang like this!"
Jim didn't say anything; instead, he continued to watch as Moran put away the rest of the pieces of the gun and closed the case.
"Don't stop!" Sherlock groaned, spreading his legs even further and putting his hands on his knees to pull them close to his chest. "More... John... I … I … I think... OH GOD!!"
Irene shook her head, both touched and irritated. "Sherlock, you don't have to tell me this. It's..."
A fresh surge of precome spilled over onto John's tongue, and he intensified his efforts as best he could.
"Not that I have anything against the male eroticism of an unshaven face..." Mycroft remarked, taking the drink from Greg. Instead of trying it, however, he eyed the cup with distaste.
, as Mike always insisted) were with him, one on the front passenger seat and one next to him in the back. For that reason, he perhaps should have resisted the urge ... but he'd had a shitty day and wasn't in the mood to take his men and their quitting time into consideration.
John let him. He found the scent of Sherlock's hair tickling his cheek surprisingly soothing. Sherlock was actually pretty heavy and he was lying in a rather uncomfortable position on John's legs, but the warmth emanating from him felt good. John's hands absently caressed Sherlock's back, moving lower and lower until they reached his naked bottom (his pyjamas had ended up somewhere between his thighs and his knees) and finally felt in between his buttocks. John paused, surprised.
Mike nodded. “I couldn’t let it go on any longer,” he explained regretfully. “He can’t keep calling him a cocksucker. You put up with that way too long.”
John teased Sherlock a little more by angling his hand from time to time such that Sherlock couldn't reach his knuckles, but when Sherlock buried his head in the corner of John's neck and did nothing but whine with unfulfilled desire, he gave in. Although the tortured whimpers were music to his ears, he didn't want to be unnecessarily cruel. His own arousal had reached the point where everything in him was screaming for release.
It was over pitifully fast. It only took a few strong thrusts to give John an almost desperate orgasm. Silently, accompanied only by a stifled sob, he emptied himself into Sherlock then collapsed on top of him.
"Leave those two alone for a bit," he said all of a sudden. "I think they can handle it well enough without you spying on their every move." He tossed a glance over his shoulder into the cemetery, where two figures could be seen in an open space devoid of trees or bushes. One was tall and slender with dark hair, wearing a long, dark coat, while the other was somewhat shorter and had lighter hair.
Sherlock gave John a searching look. "Has he seen worse?" he asked, nodding toward the door. "He didn't seem particularly horrified."
. There's no way in hell I'm taking out your rubbish for you. I put it in your old room. No matter what's going on between you and your brother..." John took a deep breath. "Sherlock... I'm not going to fight all your battles for you. You're going to have to take care of this parcel from your brother yourself. All right?"
"All right," Sherlock capitulated. "You're probably right... I probably would have, back then... but today... Mycroft, I'm sure Father loved you just as much as he did me."
Thomas took an apple from the sideboard and took a crunchy bite. "Why're you complaining? At leasht the bossh's been in a good mood and leavesh ush alone," he mumbled through his full mouth.
"Take them all the way off," John instructed him, stepping back to give him more room to manoeuvre. "Shoes and socks too."
Greg shook his head firmly. "Revenge and retaliation don't lead anywhere - other than into a downward spiral of violence."
Naresh slowed the car and flipped on the turn signal. John found himself back in the present and shook his head in annoyance. He couldn't afford to think about his … about Sherlock right now, right before the most important meeting of his career.
John set Sherlock's phone onto the nightstand next to his own. "Personal interests..." He shook his head. "What a load of horseshit. Do you know what personal interest your brother might have in this whole affair?"
His fears had been completely groundless. Yes, he'd seen it as a problem that John's two worlds - which he'd split his time between for all these months, and which he actually wanted to keep strictly separate - would be irrevocably intermingled through Sherlock's arrival.
His hand laid itself across his mouth of its own accord, his fingers cutting off the sound – half laugh, half sob – that came out of his throat.
"I mean it!" Bridges insisted. "I've had much worse employers. The Doc might not always mind his p's and q's but I always get paid on time. And he's never puked in the car or pulled anyone from the street and got off in the back ... and then took the cost for cleaning it up out of my pay-cheque because the stains wouldn't come all the way out."
"Mycroft's not the only one who would have been left waiting for me to sit up and beg," Sherlock couldn't help adding.
"Okay," Greg panted. "Enough foreplay for today." He turned around in Mycroft's arms so his back was toward him and supported himself with his lower arms on the desk.
The urge to see his sperm in orifices at both ends of Sherlock's body at the same time made John's blood run hot. As if he were seized by a fever, he opened his trousers and took out his rigid cock.
That statement gave Irene something to think about, and hit her hard. She hadn't known – nor even suspected – that Sherlock would be so affected by the thoughtless (and sometimes heartless) behaviour of some of their clients.
But despite his firm resolution not to get hung up on his own longings, he was even more restless, impatient, and twitchy than before. His restlessness didn't improve with working, as everything his clients did to him paled in comparison to John's visits. Everything they acted out with him – or on him – ended up being dull and boring compared to John's cruel kindness.
"There, now doesn't that feel better?" John asked in a patronising manner that he knew would drive Sherlock batty. Sure enough, Sherlock gave him a murderous glare over his shoulder, although there was also something akin to surrender in it. John pulled out his fingers and wiped them on a tissue. "Well, I have to hand it to you at least... you didn't beg for an orgasm."
"Most clients wouldn't have let that stop them," Sherlock interrupted him, his voice calm and composed. "The more I screamed and…
"Sherlock..." John said without taking his eyes off of Mike. "Please go to the kitchen and let them know we'll eat in an hour."
It all ended up being less fuss than they'd thought. The two men who were still huddled together lit a couple of cigarettes, making them easy to spot in the darkness.
There it was again - the strict yet slightly amused tone of voice, used to giving orders and having them obeyed, which only served to send more blood into his already quivering lower half.
Sherlock had looked up with a small, pleased - yet inquiring - smile when he came in, laying aside the papers he'd been reading.
“I've enjoyed a certain anonymity here,” Sherlock stated, his head still tilted in thought. John remained silent, waiting, and after what seemed like an eternity, Sherlock resumed speaking: “The danger is that that will change if I were to … live with you.” The concept seemed to confuse him, as he paused a moment. “What I mean is: it's going to come out eventually that you have someone living with you. And from that moment forward, it won't be long until the rumours start over whom exactly you've brought home with you, and... that's exactly what I want to avoid at all costs. I've been quite successful up to now.” He sighed heavily. “No one cares about some old prostitute in a brothel. But the crimelord’s new hobby?” His gaze bored into John. “Tell me I'm wrong.”
Instead, he went into his office. Once there, he closed the door behind himself and leaned back against it. He hadn't turned on the light, so he now stared into the virtually endless grey that spread out before him. The curtains weren't drawn, and pale moonlight seeped in through the windows. His eyes slowly grew accustomed to the semi-darkness, and he was now able to discern the individual pieces of furniture and items around the room.
Sherlock let his eyes fall slowly shut. “God, yes,” he whispered with barely masked sadness before raising his chin again in a sign of resolve. When he opened his eyes again to look at John, there once again was that calm, resigned acceptance that would always remain a mystery to John. “John, there's no sense in all this. Please, go... don't torture me any longer.” His face bore no hint of his inner conflict, betrayed only by the slight quaver in his voice.
The man sitting behind the desk, however, appeared oddly out of place with his three-piece suit and fob watch on a chain. He would have looked more at home seated behind a massive wooden desk and surrounded by dark oak with brass trim, in place of the practical, straightforward computer screens, glass and chrome of the current furnishings.
"Has a good feel to it," he murmured, half to himself, before turning his full attention to Sherlock once again.
"Will there be anything else, Mr Watson?" Jacques asked, but received only an absent shake of the head as his boss had already turned away from him in order to follow the sweet music.
"No," John answered calmly and laid out the salve and latex gloves. "But I would have preferred not to owe him anything..."
John knew from experience that, should he refuse to answer, Mike would keep nagging until he gave up the desired information. But that was the price he paid for having made an old friend his closest confidant and advisor. At least Mike would never stab him in the back. Neither literally nor figuratively – and that was an invaluable advantage that far outweighed any other disadvantages. Still, there were certain things that were really none of Mike's business. And one of them was the confusing desires that his two visits with Sherlock had unleashed in him, and that he wanted nothing more than to forget – or at least suppress. The sooner the better.
Just as he was about to turn around and leave, he noticed one of the very few men standing - like him - at the side of the path. Something in his posture seemed familiar to John... the rather compact, medium stature, the slightly curly, straw-blond hair... No. It couldn't be. He was imagining things. A fleeting similarity - nothing more.
"It's not ridiculous," Sherlock insisted and turned his head to look at her. "He doesn't love me," he repeated soberly, a wistful quirk at the corner of his mouth.
Irene passed her hands over her eyes in a gesture of exhaustion and resignation. "I was always afraid you'd swap your cocaine addiction for something else," she said quietly. "I always wondered what the substitute would be – what else you'd try to destroy yourself with. Now I know."
Having to show the three men the way to the new bedroom, watching as they hauled the well packed furniture up the stairs to the first floor, listening from the entry hall to the typical sounds of wooden parts being assembled, and not being able to be in there, not being allowed to watch, not being able to see... it was all pure torture for Sherlock.
"Absolutely," John answered with a hint of a tease. "And not just once, either. I want to see you here in front of me in an hour again... in exactly the same position. I'm going to stimulate your prostate until everything comes out... just that... no orgasm... and again an hour after that... over and over... and I'm going to do it until nothing more comes out... until your balls are as dry as the Sahara, and then... then I'm going to take you upstairs... lay you out on the bed... and then I'm going to fuck you until you can't see or hear straight anymore..."
"Soon..." Sherlock groaned, reached for another strawberry, and smashed it against his own chest. John's mouth sank onto it almost immediately, sucking hard on Sherlock's nipple until he felt Sherlock's muscles contracting around him. "
John didn't know what to say to that at first, and he remained just as clueless for quite a while. It wasn't until he was sure his voice would sound halfway normal that he whispered softly, "I never thought of it like that before... No one's ever seen it like that before you..." He turned his head toward Sherlock, but he could only make out a vague outline in the night.
At the moment when their cocks met for the first time, both men gasped for air. Sherlock was louder and more uninhibited, John quieter and more tentative. The feeling of skin against naked skin was equally intense for both, however. The slide of the soft, malleable skin over the hot, hard flesh underneath... the pull and give of the foreskin... the dry friction... the electric tingle when their glans stuck together, resisting the forward motion for a moment that was almost painful, followed by the erotic relief when a bead of pre-come supplied enough moisture to make the friction more pleasant again.
Sherlock stood in front of the open door of the green room, undecided. He'd half convinced himself he'd rather spend the entire day in his pyjamas and dressing gown than to go into the room to change, and have to endure the sight of Mycroft's package.
After several weeks had passed, one might say that Sherlock's life had taken on a certain routine character.
But Irene just laughed and went to the door. "Best wishes to you, Sherlock - and don't forget to invite me to the wedding."
"What are you doing to me..." John murmured so softly that Sherlock wasn't sure he'd heard the words correctly. "All right," John then said more clearly, rolling his eyes in a comical manner. "You heard Mike. Back to work."
"Jesus Christ... Johnny! Calm down. You're going to blow a gasket," Mike tried to soothe his friend. He raised his hands in a placating gesture. "All right, fine. We'll do it your way. You want a bloodbath – you'll get a bloodbath. But just as a warning, so you know ... get ready for DI Dimmock to send us a dry-cleaning bill."
They moved along slowly; even though Sherlock's wound had healed admirably, he still had a limp. He'd traded in the orthopaedic crutch for a fashionable walking stick whose silver handle flashed now and then in the light of the sun.
John's next words sounded like a sigh of relief. "Not that it isn't flattering that it's apparently so easy for me to fuck you into a coma... but I don't need that every time."
But what was he going to get for this act of self-sacrificing friendship? John was probably going to yell at him, Sherlock was going to make fun of him, and Susan... Mike sighed heavily. Susan was probably going to burn his fry-up in retaliation if he didn't get home on time tonight.
"A-all right," Sherlock agreed, hesitating. "It's just..." He chewed on his bottom lip. "I wanted... to look
"I don't want you snooping around my office," John explained firmly. "No matter if I'm in here or not. When I'm in here, I'm working and don't want to be disturbed. And when I'm not here, you have no business being in here anyway." He waited for a moment, but when Sherlock continued to give him a slightly puzzled look, John pursed his lips. "I don't want to see you in here. Not under any circumstances. Got it?"
"Okay." He heard John swallow. Then he repeated: "Okay." Gruffer this time. "You're going to think of me... every - single - second." He took a deep breath and let it go. When he spoke again, his voice had taken on a hard, strict tone. "Hands behind you. Spread your arse for me."
"It must belong to a very good friend of yours, Mr Watson, if you need to go to such painstaking lengths to ensure your security on his property."
His arousal, held back for so long, exploded in an orgasm that seemed to last forever. Milky semen spurted again and again from his slowly deflating penis. John kept skilfully rubbing his prostate. His entire body trembled with a climax that seemed to go on forever.

“Which brings us back to your blood test,” John returned unflinchingly to the original topic, causing Sherlock to groan in annoyance.
"Oh, yes! You rubbed my nose in the fact that Mummy treated the two of us exactly the same often enough!"
"I had the feeling this morning that it might be better to be prepared in case it had to go fast," Sherlock explained casually.
He forced his protesting limbs to stand, but the quest for water was useless. All he found was the whisky on the nightstand. Alcohol would only dehydrate his body further, but a little sip might help shorten the wait. Sherlock picked up the bottle and read the label. It was the same Glenturret Mike had mentioned. Eighteen years old and 59.8% alcohol... almost cask strength. How could John have drunk so much of it without watering it down?
The trip didn't take very long. Naresh was driving the car in place of Bridges, and Dave sat on the front passenger seat - his hands never far from his shoulder holster and the gun it held. The back seat was silent, with both men either looking straight ahead or out the window with deliberately bored expressions. But that was all part of the game, and they both knew it.
Higgins and one of his men were the only ones left. The others were trying to catch the shooter, following Dave's orders. John could see the barely disguised suspicion in Higgins' eyes.
A couple of links about the cognac that was consumed in this chapter and the cognac snifters that Mycroft complained about:
Greg's lips lowered to cover Mycroft's mouth once more. It tasted faintly of desperation. But Mycroft didn't care... at least not much. Greg had relented - that was the only thing that mattered. It was, however, astounding that his methods - the same ones that had served him well when dealing with a pre-pubescent Sherlock - appeared to work on a grown Inspector too. Astounding... but good to know. At the same time, Mycroft had observed often enough how compliant people could become when threatened with the withdrawal of affection - or when deprived of positive acknowledgments. How easy they were to manipulate then.
The flaring nostrils were the only sign that Sherlock was aware he was no longer alone. His eyes remained fixed on an imaginary point somewhere just short of the ceiling.
"Relax. And don't forget to breathe," John advised him in a low, soothing voice. "I'm not going to hurt you on purpose."
Oblivious to the panic coursing through Sherlock's mind, John traced patterns on the bedsheet with his index finger.
When Mycroft arrived at his office a short while later and stepped into the reception area, he took note of the reddened eyes and increased percentage of black in his secretary's attire (he hadn't seen her yet that day as he'd been at an appointment with the Ministry of the Interior since early that morning, right up to his meeting with Greg), but based on the old-fashioned locket that suddenly hung around her neck, he deduced the death of an aunt and didn't inquire any further. He just hoped Miss Morstan wouldn't want a day off for the funeral... he'd never had such a hard-working secretary in his entire career, and it would be difficult to do without her just now.
"Would you be so good as to remove your clothing now?" John asked, with a touch of frustration in his voice.
, on the other hand... It's going to be hard to deny that one," he remarked with a chuckle an in attempt to lighten the mood a bit. He'd had enough emotion for one day.
"Nouveau-riche, overblown, and kitschy - I know," John admitted with a shrug and a laugh. "But there's no other way to get enough light into this draughty hall … at least not when it's dark out," he added, waving his hand in the direction of the large, full-length windows. It was morning, and the almost garish rays of the robust, springtime sun fell through the clear glass, reflecting so strongly in the black-and-white marble tiles on the floor that it was practically blinding.
'), John made himself comfortable on his bed. He opened his trousers and pushed them down to his knees. His stiff penis was outlined clearly in his briefs. He was gratified to hear Sherlock's stuttering breaths and faint whimpers. He rubbed the damp material of his pants, going at a leisurely pace.
He nodded at a tall, blond man in his thirties. He presented quite the picture. But his chin was a little too angular and his eyes a little too deepset to really be deemed attractive.
Tonight, Sherlock was finally going to come clean and tell John the truth about how he felt... tell him that he loved him... how
John stood up, went to the little bar, drained his glass while standing, and poured himself another. It was his third drink. He didn't bother with ice this time. The curtains over the open window billowed out slightly in the mild breeze. John closed his eyes and turned his face toward the fresh air, which already bore a hint of coolness with it, while his thoughts continued to whirl. Why hadn't he gone upstairs already and confronted Sherlock with his wishes, with his desires? Sherlock was completely at his beck and call, could see each and every one of his wishes reflected in his eyes (and in his cock), and he even enjoyed it.
On the way back to his room, he realised he'd crossed an invisible boundary by visiting the kitchen, invading a territory he had no business in.
But John noticed what was going on before too long and stopped, eliciting a whinge of protest from Sherlock that was disregarded. He grabbed Sherlock's hips in a merciless grip and jerked him back further - away from any possibility of additional stimulation.
Sherlock struggled with himself. Sweat ran down his back and his temples. His knees were shaking and his lower body was quivering with the effort of remaining still and not thrusting his hips forward.
"His accusation is completely justified," Susan interrupted him sternly. "Of course I had to draw it out of him bit by bit... but after awhile I was able to piece together enough to figure out the whole picture." She took a deep breath. "John - how could you tell that poor boy to his face that you don't trust him?"
"Very good," John praised him, pressed a light kiss to his forehead and then tapped him on the shoulder. "Get up - there's more. I'm a long way from being finished with you."
"I'm a very busy man," John replied lightly, indicating that Dave and Naresh should wait outside the door.
“No. We’ll discuss it here,” Sherlock waved off the offer. John was inside. John should know as little about this as possible. At least until Sherlock had received some answers to his questions.
John already had his hand on the door handle when Sherlock's words reached him. They sounded like the desperate screams of a drowning man to his ears. He shook his head as if to shake the thought off. It wasn't possible to drown in a bed! Still, he hesitated – and turned around again. Just to make sure that Sherlock's face displayed the usual passive, controlled expression it had in situations like this. But rather than the resignation and acceptance he generally found in those pale features when Sherlock realised he'd gone too far, John saw the first cracks in the mask of forbearance, and behind that - naked desperation and fear.
Now Sherlock lay on the cold ground, completely exhausted and gasping for breath. John spread his coat over him again. It wasn't good for him to remain lying there in the cold, but Sherlock needed a short rest.
"You didn't say you got off on giving head," John scolded him. "Now I really am going to have to use the riding crop. There's no way around it, I'm afraid," he said in a tone of fake chagrin. "You'll have to be punished – so that you learn not to lie to me again."
It wasn't until he was at the hospital - while John was speaking to the doctors in the A and E - that Sherlock realised it had been his willingness to die for John that had ended up saving them. His willingness and John's cold-blooded, pinpoint accuracy had turned everything for the better, against all odds.
One night, when Sherlock couldn't fall asleep because his arse was still stinging so pleasantly from being spanked by John, he thought about how his other clients usually treated him...
From that time on, Sherlock would frequently put in a CD of opera music and sit at John's feet, nuzzling against him like an oversized Persian cat … or a tame black panther. John could never quite decide. However, he had noticed - from the early days of their meeting, in fact - that Sherlock had a tendency to cling, snuggling up so close that there wasn't room for so much as a slip of paper between them.
"Control. Why is it that you can never control yourself?" he said, playing at being aggrieved by the fact, and clicked disapprovingly with his tongue. "Lick it clean," he ordered with cold detachment, moving the two besmirched fingers closer to Sherlock so he could reach them.
The delicious, excruciating urge to come immediately... the need to come, which had completely dominated him just a short while ago, had ebbed somewhat in the meantime, which was fortunate. But he was still kneeling in front of John... tied up... helpless... ignored... with his thighs willingly spread and his penis obscenely upright.
When Thomas neared him, working at his usual unhurried pace, Sherlock spoke to him under cover of the hum of the hoover.
. Would you entrust your dearest possession to just anyone?" Sherlock spoke faster and faster towards the end. He wasn't used to speaking to his brother like this, and he wanted to get it over with as quickly as possible, before he changed his mind.
He had been so alone ... he owed John so much... a single lifetime would probably never be enough to express his gratitude. But he could try.
John could picture it vividly, and his penis twitched with excitement. "Feels good, doesn't it?" he replied with a fiendish grin, which Sherlock couldn't see, unfortunately.
"By you? Never," Sherlock retorted with quiet earnest, allowing his hungry gaze to glide slowly and explicitly over John's entire body.
No, Sherlock was not exactly suffering from boredom at the moment. Even the perpetual nagging desire for a cigarette which had haunted him almost constantly since that accursed promise, too flippantly made, had been extinguished... extinguished as thoroughly as a glowing cigarette butt that had been dunked in the wet dregs of a glass of cognac.
And from what I know of you guys, you'd probably like to see Sherlock asking to "top" one time? Or how the visit with Mama Sylvia goes? Or what it was like in Italy? Or... whether there may yet be a marriage proposal after all... But somehow I think Mycroft and Greg will be getting married first...
"If you want to... milk me... then..." he began hesitantly, "then I won't stop you. But..." He bit his lower lip and looked so innocent and so wicked that another wave of desire rushed through John's lower regions.
"You're wearing too much," he complained in a breathy whisper. "You always wear too much..." His fingers slid across the scar on John's shoulder, stroking it until John sighed and moaned at the same time. Then Sherlock squashed one of the strawberries - which he'd groped for blindly - on the ruined skin. John sucked in a sharp breath between his teeth and held completely still as Sherlock bent his upper body to lick the fruit pulp from his shoulder. Both of them could feel the strong pulsing of John's hard cock in Sherlock's tight, willing body, and both men shuddered heavily.
"Why the hell is your brother sending me a parcel?" he blurted out without thinking. Sherlock set down his teacup so hard that the tea slopped over - not just into the saucer, but onto the tablecloth.
The report of the shot affected John like an act of emancipation. Moriarty fell forward and came to a rest with his face in the brown water. Blood flowed out of the exit wound in the back of his head. He was dead.
"All right." John turned his attention to Albright once again, who was staring at him with anticipation. His posture, however, clearly expressed that he was prepared for anything. "Albright -
“We'll simply split the third one,” Sherlock announced, held one half of the delicate baked good between his teeth and leaned across the table to John, who closed his lips around the other half of the biscuit with a grateful smile.
Greg laughed unhappily. "You did back then. It looked better in the files." He sighed. "Times were different when I started out. Today... today a same-sex partner wouldn't be a problem anymore." His gaze became clouded, and his voice took on an envious tone.
"For the fifth time, Sherlock, let it go! We agreed on half, and anyway it's none of your business. It's still my money, and I can do what I want with it!" He followed Sherlock into the entry hall.
A mischievous grin flitted across Sherlock's lips. "But John... then I'd have to shower again. Some fibres from your clothes might stick to my penis and..."
"Okay, Charlie," he said, his tone not unfriendly. "Have you thought of anything now that you might like to share with us, or... do I need to jog your memory again?" He laughed briefly. "Although... you won't be doing any jogging for a while, I don't think."
"I..." John began, licking his lips in a very promising manner. "… have something to take care of first. In the meantime... as soon as you get home, you're going to undress, put the leather cuffs on your wrists and ankles... attach the spreader bar to the ankle cuffs, and then you're going to wait for me. In the living room. On your knees," he growled in a sinful voice, his expression perfectly innocent.
," Greg whispered, his voice hoarse. "That's one of the blokes that set the bomb off at the ball." He looked up, directly into Mycroft's face. His eyes had taken on a hard, steely gleam. "Where do you have this photo from?"
"By the way... I had the concierge replaced," Holmes remarked smoothly. "Nice idea you had there. Very nice."
There was something else, though, that continued to nag at him... the events in Albright’s office which had led to his untimely demise.
Another shiver shook Sherlock's body, and his still-hard cock twitched eagerly, if in vain. John's fingers were itching to explore Sherlock's masochistic tendencies (which he certainly appeared to have) immediately, but he'd save that for another time. At the moment, the torment of orgasm deprivation should occupy Sherlock well enough and keep him in check.
Several years lay between the photograph John had received from Mycroft and the man who now stood before him in the flesh, but there was no doubt it was the same person. That flickering look in his eyes - not just a trick of the petroleum lamps - would stay with him for the rest of his life.
John wrapped one arm around Sherlock's hip. "You're here. I'm here. That's enough for me. It can't get any more perfect."
As soon as Sherlock heard the sound of the front door opening, he came out of John's office into the entry hall, swinging his hips in a lascivious manner, meeting John's surprised gaze with knowing, bedroom eyes and saying in a dark, breathy voice, "It's a good thing you're finally here, Mr Watson..."
"John... please..." he moaned. "Fuck me now." Another viscous drop of clear precome ran down the head of his penis and landed in the smeary ashtray between his legs. He swallowed. "I want to... come... I need to! I need you!" he blurted out wildly. Everything in him was vibrating, his desire was eating him up from the inside, he felt as if he were nothing more than a single erogenous zone.
The left corner of Sherlock's mouth lifted in a sympathetic grin. It happened so rarely that Irene lost her cool and used such coarse language.
"At least you do admit it," Sherlock responded impassively, and with a hearty yawn. His arm slung itself possessively around John's midsection.
The butler served the coffee on the coffee table, handing Mike his cup, then filled the other two cups with the caffeinated elixir.
John stared greedily at the stretched anus, gleaming with Vaseline, and its spasmodic attempts to close itself completely. But after every contraction of the muscle, a small opening remained, out of which small amounts of semen oozed in the same rhythm as the convulsions.
None of the 24-hour surveillance had revealed any secret contacts with Moran, but John still felt there was something off and wanted to be on the safe side. He'd therefore decided to wait to off Moran until he'd interrogated him thoroughly about his contacts and any backers... an interrogation which John intended to carry out himself... an interrogation he'd been itching to get to for days. He'd had to control himself for too long, hadn't been able to show that anything was going on. Today he'd take that mask off and Moran would see his true face.
He heard John's excited pants, felt the pressure on his orifice and hands grasping his hips in an unyielding grip, and then John sank into him with several rough strokes.
He heard Moriarty's barely controlled breathing on the other end of the line. "I hope for your sake there was a good reason."
Sherlock saw John's finger move, heard the click, and knew what that meant. And yet his only reaction was to say in a flat tone, "Go ahead and shoot!"
"Nothing," John answered. "Nothing at all. Aside from the fact that you're his brother. And that was plenty, let me tell you."
Mycroft raised an eyebrow suspiciously. "Anyway...?" he repeated with an ominous sense of foreboding.
When John Watson and Mycroft Holmes sat across from each other the next day in the usual house, on their usual couches, they both rather quickly laid their cards on the table, forgoing most of the usual chit-chat, and exchanged what information they had.
"Sherlock..." John murmured in a voice that reflected both incredulity and desire. "Sherlock..." His hips jerked forward uncontrolled, and he stroked Sherlock's hair again in what he hoped was a calming way. "Don't..." he said softly. "You don't have to..."
John reduced the pressure of his lips, wanted to end the kiss, but Sherlock clung to him with a small sob that came from deep in his throat and didn't let go until the urge to voice those questions had finally disappeared.
"Dave, Naresh... You're off for the rest of the night," he said to the men sitting with him in the car.
"Not that again!" John cried out angrily. "Yes, your nephew is dead. A bloody shame. But shit happens! I did all I could to get to the bottom of it! I can't help the fact that Charlie White was shot dead right in front of me before he could say anything more!"
"Oh my God!" John groaned, but he took the gun obediently out of his shoulder holster and, with a practised motion, released the magazine with a clearly audible clatter onto the little table in front of him. "Satisfied?"
"But only from a very great distance with an abominable pair of binoculars," Mycroft tossed back lightly and entered the house.
John had resumed giving copious attention to Sherlock's nipples, with the result that Sherlock was writhing and squirming with lust beneath him, arching his upper body toward him as much as possible. Sherlock was positioned on the table in such a way that he was able to grind his stiff, slippery erection unremittingly against John's still-clothed lower body. He did so with abandon, pleasing John with his shameless moans.
It was like an image from heathen times... a human sacrifice on the altar. Tied down. Offered up. The youth fully aware of what an honour it was... chosen... called to appease the gods with his sacrifice. And yet... the fear... so alluring, so exciting, so empowering. And there was something else... the trust... the absolute trust in those fascinating eyes.
Sherlock clung to John's body with a soft whimper, surrendering to the familiar yet entirely new interplay of lips and tongue. Sherlock had thought he knew every one of John's kisses by now. They could be passionate or hard, tender or brutal, hungry or playful... but he'd never kissed Sherlock like this before, and Sherlock immersed himself in this new kind of caress, forgetting everything around him for the moment. There was only John... John was all that was important... his arms around Sherlock, the faint scent of gunpowder and gun oil which never entirely left him... his fingers stroking the back of Sherlock's neck and sliding through his hair... his tongue pushing in between Sherlock's lips, over and over again, licking and luring... his thin mouth moving greedily over Sherlock's... sensual, passionate and infinitely loving... and Sherlock couldn't get enough of it.
Lestrade meandered along the Thames with the takeaway coffee he'd just purchased, as he still had a bit of time before his second appointment with the mayor. It had just stopped raining an hour ago for the first time in two weeks, and the wet streets gleamed in the light of the hazy afternoon sun.
More than 24 hours later, John lay in his bed in a multiple stars hotel, completely exhausted and bleary-eyed, yet unable to go to sleep.
"You swallowed again!" Irene yelled accusatorily. "I should have known. You goddamned idiot! Safe sex! Is that too complicated for that genius bird brain of yours? You know perfectly well that all it takes is one tiny accident – a tear, an injury to your gums, any small wound in your mouth is enough to infect you! I've told you a
When John finally entered the room – his hands buried deep in the pockets of the long woollen coat hanging open off his shoulders, wearing his usual black polo neck top along with a blue-grey suit – Sherlock's mind was swept clean and he had no idea what to say. Too many unfiltered words clamoured for space on his tongue, but he swallowed all of them down. In the end, it was John's left eyebrow rising slowly – expectant, challenging, cynical – that released the paralysis that had settled over his vocal cords.
- what do you have to say in your defence?" Susan demanded. "How could you do something like this to that poor boy?"
"Love..." Sherlock scoffed. "One needs a heart in order to love. And we both know all too well that I don't have one."
John recognised the words as the same ones he'd spoken so long ago, at their first meeting. They touched him in a peculiar way, a way he couldn't quite categorise.
A reptilian grin distended Moriarty's lips. "I've developed a special affinity for water and fire, when it comes to certain... enterprises. Although I'd hoped the water here would be a bit deeper."
John gave Greg a sceptical look, but held his tongue as well. It was going to be difficult enough to transport Sherlock up the vertical rungs in his condition. He needed all the help he could get. Even if it involved an angry policeman. He just needed to avoid angering the aforementioned policeman any further. He took off his coat and spread it over Sherlock. "Here... you're shivering. And now hold on... I'm going to carry you over to those stairs."
Mike suppressed a smirk. He would have liked to ask what Sherlock was, if not a fling, but he decided to keep his mouth shut. It would probably just make John angry again. Like the time he'd thought Mike was insinuating that John was in love with Sherlock.
"Prima donna..." Mike said in an irritated undertone and set his mobile aside. As if anything could happen to John at Albright's... not even Albright was that careless. He grimaced when the pain in his back hit him again. What was taking the doctor so long?
The most important thing to consider here was certainly the fact that John was drunk. Not drunk enough that he was staggering or unable to walk on his own, but tipsy enough to let his baser instincts rise closer to the forefront.
," he hurled at Mycroft, elegantly avoiding the fact that he actually had bought Sherlock from Irene Adler (or at least planned to). "
"But of course, your highness," John replied, his tone teasing yet affectionate, and lifted him up. He was secretly glad that Sherlock's submissive side had retired for the time being and the spoilt prince had once again taken command.
That's when he knew it was over. He let himself sink deeper into the pillows, completely drained, pulled the cover half over himself, and fell asleep immediately.
"Good boy," John praised him, and felt even more tension leech out of the slender body in his arms. "That's right. Just like that... just lie there... I'll take care of everything..."
Dumbfounded and in internal turmoil, Sherlock listened silently as Irene apologised to the client – who had recovered from his shock by this time and become rather upset and extremely loud – with a silver tongue for the
Mycroft nodded in recognition. "Ah, false pretences, I see. Hadn't we agreed I would let you know when I was... shall we say,
Mike had seen enough to cause him to take a hasty step back and close the door again quickly. In doing so, he almost collided with someone.
Sherlock decided not to overestimate the importance of what had just happened. Jacques was back - there would be coffee again... that was the only thing that interested him in all this.
“You... you haven't even asked him?” Irene said, dumbfounded, as she blinked. “He doesn't even know that you...”
Mike put the phone to his ear and got out of bed. No matter what the call was about, there was no way he was going to take it with his wife lying next to him with that beatific smile on her face. A smile that another man had put there... and all he'd done was talk to her
Mycroft Holmes was still wearing his waistcoat, but - in a concession to the rising temperatures - he'd unbuttoned it and loosened his tie. The result - whether intentional or not - was that he didn't present quite as
John looked him over silently, then examined the cigar thoughtfully. There was already another sizeable cylinder of ash on the end.
"What do you think? Are you steady enough to clean up yet?" John wanted to know, pinching his nipples lightly.
Sherlock – the first and only person who'd ever knocked him off his feet ... at least since he'd been a boss in the mob.
He thrust fast and rough, virtually hammering into Sherlock's body, trying desperately to prove he was still alive, still breathing, that his heart was still beating, that his body was still warm and full of life, that there was another warm body willing to take him in, to give him warmth and affection.
“No, Mr Watson … I can't …” Irene actually intended to explain to John that there was nothing to buy out, as Sherlock didn't belong to anyone other than himself, but he didn't let her finish.
Unfortunately, none of the responses that had come in up to now contained any interesting information. But at least it was now possible to paint a more accurate picture of where the deceased had spent his time. Jason now knew (and kept Sherlock apprised through nightly texts) where Charlie had lived and done his shopping, which pub he'd drunk his beer at, and from whom he'd bought the occasional joint. They now knew his territory, and that knowledge made it possible to narrow down the search and target specific individuals to include in the search to send his picture to.
"Violet didn't realise she was pregnant until two months after you'd separated," Doris went on, more gently now. "She never intended for you to know."
for so long was because he placed a certain value on proceeding with a cool head and not making too much trouble with the law. That was precisely the reason why he was against any targeted murders of police officers. He knew perfectly well: kill a cop and a thousand other cops would set heaven and earth in motion trying to catch you... whether it be for tax evasion or an unpaid parking ticket.
"You didn't say I wasn't allowed to..." Sherlock replied, and John wondered for a moment why Sherlock was breathing so hard.
"You really found a bed?" Sherlock asked. His voice was filled with so much happiness and hope that John chuckled softly to himself.
Mycroft's heart rate shot up, and for a moment he wasn't aware of anything other than Greg, leaning against the desk and letting one hand stroke playfully over his stiff cock. But then he returned to reality with a jerk, remembering who he was and what responsbilities he bore. Although everything in him was screaming for him to go join Greg, he first went to the door of his office, locked it carefully, left the key in the lock and dimmed the lights. He'd been much too careless on this evening already, but he thought he could suppress a few paparazzi photos of the mayor kissing. However, he didn't particularly feel like explaining to the world - and his mother - any images of the mayor having a fuck.
John retracted his tongue and ran it across his own teeth in order to loosen up the muscles after the unaccustomed exertion, only to make a face which Sherlock, fortunately, couldn't see. Not that he had anything against Sherlock's own flavour, but the lubricant gel tasted terrible... and yet... if it enabled him to reduce Sherlock to a whimpering, quivering, snivelling heap of desire within mere seconds... he'd do it again in a heartbeat.
“Why is it so difficult for you to let me finish speaking today?” John asked so sweetly that Sherlock's gaze cleared for a moment and he regarded him with interest.
Sherlock was standing at the foot of the bed, as naked as the day he was born, quivering with barely controlled rage.
"You don't say," John answered dryly, pressing down a bit harder on Sherlock's shrivelling genitals.
"So, Mycroft..." John said at the end of that eventful day, once he was alone with Sherlock in the bedroom. "You contacted Mycroft behind my back?"
Mike highlighted a couple of lines in the document he was working on, slid it into a clear sheet protector, and laid it aside.
His eyes filled with tears again, and they ran down his cheeks. He felt John watching him and smiled.
a figure as usual. He still sat behind his desk as calm and controlled as ever, though, while Greg was so affected by the continual increase in the heat that he could no longer sit still and had resorted to standing.
"Nothing yet," Mycroft replied lazily. He felt sleepy and hated the thought of having to leave the bed and the warm body beside him.
"I know something's crooked here. With you, with Doc Watson, with that Sigerson, with your brother, with Dimmock, with Donovan... I just know it! And Donovan knows something. The way she's going after the mob isn't normal. She's already chalked up two successful operations! Honestly, now - where Dimmock was doing too little, she's doing too much. I don't get it! Donovan must have an informant. And I don't understand how you can just sit there the whole time not doing anything."
"It's all right," he answered softly. He knew somehow that John was referring to his promise which he hadn't kept. Sherlock's bottom was still pristine and white and unblemished.
"No!" John said, a touch harshly, causing Sherlock to snap his mouth shut with satisfying speed. "Your body will thank you when you're lying in hospital with a high fever and an extremely unpleasant urinary tract infection." He took a deep breath through his nose. "Tomorrow, Sherlock. Tomorrow night. I promise. But we really need to talk about it beforehand. All right?" He waited until Sherlock grudgingly nodded. "It's really all for your own good. You should understand what... My God, quit with the puppy dog eyes!" He laid a hand on Sherlock's cheek and gazed deep into his eyes. "And even aside from all of that... that was my third gin. I'm simply not sober enough for something like that right now."
Mabel clapped him on the shoulder. "Just because he encourages your laziness..." she murmured before saying with clear disapproval: "He didn't even say
"Friend … enemy... it's hard to tell the difference these days," he remarked acidly. "Just look at us … you might think we're friends, from a distance."
A hint of anxiety snuck onto John's face. “You're not going to seriously tell me you've had that monster hard-on for three hours? That's not exactly healthy...”
"A tempting offer," he said with cosmopolitan nonchalance. "Perhaps we can come back to it some other time. When the air isn't quite so humid as it is today."
He only got as far as the stairs before he regretted his decision to leave Sherlock so precipitously. But he forced himself to ignore the ridiculous impulse to turn around and comfort Sherlock, instead continuing on his way. The best thing – or perhaps even the right thing – would have been never to get involved with the man in the first place. But it was too late for such insights. He would always return to Sherlock's open arms. Even though he knew the impossible wanker was going to continue to do or say things that rubbed him the wrong way – in his own unique, direct, un-sugarcoated, and naïve way. Maybe that was the secret to his fascination, to the attraction that he exercised over John? That whatever he said, it was never calculated, or at least it was never meant to hurt anyone? That in and of itself was a feat, as most of what Sherlock said could be quite hurtful – or at least could be taken that way.
Sherlock felt himself blush. John had never kissed him on the forehead before in a situation like this. The praise felt good. A pleased smile appeared on his lips. He tried to gaze deeply into John's eyes, maybe to get a real kiss... but John's thoughts were already elsewhere, having moved on.
He was a little disappointed when John crouched - still dressed - between his splayed legs, opened his trousers and pushed them down along with his underwear, but only far enough to free his stiff member. John hadn't done this in a while. More recently, he'd almost always disrobed entirely. Sherlock had become so used to the feeling of John's bare skin that it felt like a punishment now. A punishment? Was that the reason for John's unusual behaviour?
"Yes, I believe so," he replied, without any great interest, before addressing the issue that he was itching to have taken care of. "Will you
"A couple of law compendiums … from other countries as well," John explained with a grin. "Some books on commercial law. A little on taxes … some chemistry and medicine... you know. The usual."
When he realised that, he felt reality slowly returning to his brain and sinking into his body. He was dumbfounded to find he was holding something in his hand. When he saw it was his own loaded gun with the safety off – and that it was aimed at Sherlock – he was horrified at himself.
He groaned in pleasure when his nascent erection met with a similar bulge in John's trousers. His hands got to work on John's flies, finally getting them open. There was already a wet spot clearly visible on the black material of John's underwear.
Greg shook his head. "You don't need to recite a campaign speech to me." He plucked his jacket up from one of the chairs and went to the door. "And another thing... I don't need to be protected! Especially not by you! I can take care of myself quite well, thank you very much. I've done pretty well on my own for years now."
"Pretty here, isn't it?" Moriarty remarked casually after a while, as if he were at a garden party. "An old drinking water reservoir from the Victorian era. It's not in use anymore... in danger of collapse. A shame. How do you like it, Doc?"
Moran straightened up. His eyes were, John now saw, light blue, and John's stare was returned without a trace of nerves.
"You just can't wait, can you?" John teased him with a lecherous smile. "We still have all night... but since you seem to be
"Yes," Sherlock replied, and John was surprised once again. This time not by his youthful appearance, but by the warm, deep, rich sound of his voice, as well as by the bored tone he affected. "You're here to deflower me."
There were just a few more steps between him and the final landing, which barely rose above the surface of the water.
Sherlock looked down at his hands, the fingers twisted around each other, and relaxed them with an expression of dismay. Mike was coming to see him - he couldn't be allowed to see how agitated Sherlock was inside. The steps had arrived in front of his door, where they stopped.
He wet his lips, pushed away his own desires once more, and then – once he felt he could trust himself and his body's reactions again - looked down at Sherlock, who still appeared upset but seemed to have regained control over himself ... almost like someone who was just waiting for the inevitable to occur. Did he think John was going to punish him for his failure? No, that couldn't be it – a punishment was more like a reward for Sherlock. Had he perhaps come to the false conclusion that this whole thing was so important to John that he'd drop him like a hot potato now? That might be a reason for the almost panicked reaction that was playing out before his eyes. John was a reliable source of income for Sherlock – along the lines of a jackpot in the lottery, in prostitute's terms. John considered briefly how high Sherlock's debt to Irene must be, and how much longer he'd have to work to pay it off. But he forced himself to abandon that line of thought.
"I don't know... you must have a hobby. Maybe you tend a rose garden on your estate?" Greg suggested.
Sherlock met her eyes sheepishly, looking like guilt personified. "Whatever makes you think I might have done something? I would simply like to know whether I'm... healthy."
Was this never going to end? Had the bloody bastard come to earth only to make trouble for him? To give him heartburn and ulcers? What mess was that walking catastrophe about to set loose now?
At some point, he noted vaguely that Sherlock's agile fingers were fumbling with his belt. In a flash, he buried his hand in the dark curls and yanked Sherlock's head back.
A brief inner struggle was visible on Jacques' face between the desire not to simply waste his carefully guarded and strictly rationed treats and the desire to be of service to Sherlock.
"It's incredible how sensitive you are," John whispered, almost awe-struck. "I'll bet, with the right training, you could come without anyone even touching your cock." Sherlock let out a lust-filled moan, and John grinned. "Yeah, I thought you'd like that..."
One more time... he'd just play one last note... then he'd hack the accursed instrument to pieces right here and now and mail the splinters back to Mycroft. With his regards.
- for control became greater and greater and threatened to sprout shoots that were increasingly eccentric... such as his insistence on the curtains being closed, and double-checking that fact.
Ever since Sherlock had assumed the position John had ordered, he was afloat on a hot-and-cold sea of emotion.
"BLUE?!" John suddenly cried from behind him, causing Sherlock to flinch. "What happened to the yellow? I thought we'd agreed!"
The black limousine was being driven by a man with close-cropped hair. Beside him sat another man with a slimy, contemptuous grin.
There it was again... that complete absence of fear... yet that was precisely what frightened him. Annoyed at himself, Sherlock shook his head and read the document through again which rendered his conservatorship null and void. Autonomy and a brother...
"It's not that I don't want to come with you!" Sherlock retorted. "It's that I don't want you to go! And Mike wouldn't have let me go anyway!"
Sherlock let him, even managing to maintain his stance on his own two shaky legs until John's strong arms wrapped around him, embraced him, held him close and carefully shifted him onto the bed.
Once again, Sherlock had to choke back the lump in his throat. John would get him out? John would come to his rescue? What had he done to deserve all this? Hesitantly, he turned to face John again.
(And despite all my promises, Sherlock won't be getting those biscuits until the next chapter. But you can probably guess now how that will come about.)
"I'm sure you don't blame me for giving him a plug from my own collection..." Moriarty went on in a chatty tone.
Following the exchange of these meagre facts, Mycroft finally agreed to leave any further investigation of the affair to John. Mycroft simply asked that John follow through on his promise regarding the body and evidence.
Sherlock's breaths were shallow and uneven, and John waited a moment to see if he would be able to calm himself without help. However, when that didn't seem to be the case, John asked in a purposefully even tone, "Does it hurt?"
Mycroft felt a chuckle bubbling up in his throat. The sensation was so unfamiliar that he suppressed it automatically. But when he felt Greg's shoulder against his, he allowed himself an extremely pleased smile, at least.
butt plug... his butt plug. He sighed happily when John slid it into his loosened, pliant hole with gentle pressure, ensuring that John's sperm would remain trapped snugly inside Sherlock's body.
"You're a fast learner," John acknowledged, licking his lips. "All right. I think we can indulge you." He pressed a button on his watch. "You have three minutes."
He put his hand on Greg's arse and opened his mouth to say something, when Greg moaned at his touch and spread his legs. All the words Mycroft had ever known escaped him completely at the moment. Had he wanted to say something? And if so, what had it been? Surely nothing important, otherwise he'd remember... although... was he even still breathing or had he forgotten to do that too? Mycroft gasped for air. The part of his brain that was responsible for instinctive actions took control. Later, he'd never recall how he managed to tear open the packet of lubricant and spread it evenly over his erection and Greg's opening. He didn't come back to his senses until his groin was pressing against Greg's arse.
"I hope the next generation of Scotland Yard's finest are trained better than that," Holmes continued, still smiling. "Now what about the preparations for the summer charity ball?"
For that reason, it was quite a surprise for him to see that Sherlock didn't even blink an eye as he approached. He didn't step back; rather, he maintained his position. Only his face paled a shade further, and his pupils expanded, as if he were aroused.
John reached into the thatch of hair with one hand, taunting, "Since you begged for it sooo nicely..." and pulled so abruptly and so hard that tears shot into Sherlock's eyes and he cried out. His erection jerked, but immediately afterwards the urge to explode on the spot wasn't quite so strong anymore, and he was able to get it under control. John let go, and Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief.
This hint of danger that triggered a gentle prickling on the back of John's neck, releasing a shot of adrenaline into his bloodstream, was just what he needed to make his blood boil once again. Mike had reproached him often enough in their youth for being an adrenaline junkie. He'd used to deny it, but since then he'd stopped his protests and begun to face facts. His love for taking risks and thrill-seeking had almost ended in disaster a few times, but he couldn't help it. It was simply stronger than he was. The tingling in his neck spread down between his legs, and he felt his cock, which had deflated a bit during their discussion - if you could even call it that – begin to fill with blood again.
Mycroft looked peeved but answered, albeit with a brief hesitation. "It was hidden in the base of an ice sculpture. There was a hollowed-out space that was originally meant to house some lighting effects or other. That's why no one noticed the bomb. Everyone thought it was part of the equipment. It wasn't just the explosion that did the damage; the flying ice shards caused quite a few injuries."
"Ah, John!" Sherlock called when he noticed him. "Good thing you're here. Your translator is an idiot. I've redone his draft for the letter to Colombia. My Spanish is a little rusty, to be sure, but I think I was able to convey your annoyance more clearly than the mumbo-jumbo from your translator that you were going to send. I've translated the inquiry from Germany for you - that's right here." He indicated some sheets on the edge of the desk. "You can dictate the letter for Italy to me later - that doesn't need to go out for two days. And then..." He scanned the jumble of papers in front of him until his expression brightened. "Oh yes - the invoice from Soho..." He shook his head. "They're trying to cheat you. It wasn't entirely easy to tease it out - they did it quite well … but the figures are fabricated. I can show you if you'd like." Once he was done, Sherlock took a deep breath, placed the fingertips of both hands against each other, leaned back in John's chair, and waited with bated breath and a pounding heart for the inevitable thunderstorm.
They'd reached the bottom of the stairs by now, and John pulled Sherlock - bristling and protesting weakly - into his arms.
The only somewhat unpleasant aspect was the hard rubber ball in his mouth that was being used as a gag, and which was fastened in place with a leather strap behind his head. Sherlock didn't like the way it tasted, nor did he like the way his saliva ran down his chin. It was humiliating in a way he couldn't appreciate, even if many of Irene's clients did.
The Highland Games had taken place in Crieff two weeks earlier. Afterwards, the tourists had left and the town had returned to its usual easygoing pace.
"I'm afraid not..." Mycroft answered lightly. "I've rather exhausted my repertoire, other than fisticuffs. But a scuffle is out of the question, as I'd certainly end up on the losing end of a physical confrontation. I don't believe I'm quite up to your par in that regard."
His bow elicited the first few, feather-light notes, more air than sound... more mist than substance... more notion than certainty... and Sherlock played them as perfectly as ever. But then something odd happened. For the first time, he felt something... the music changed... lost some of its technical brilliance and in return gained depth and warmth and pulled him along with it... ensnared him in its spell. For the first time, the music touched his heart and his heart touched the music. The movements of his body, his hands, his fingers, only changed minutely, but all of a sudden it was as if Sherlock had entered an entirely different world. A world in which his emotions were permitted, where he could express them, and...
"Oh yes, you can," John replied impassively. "Come on... assume the position. Did you really think I was finished with your arse?"
The pictures John was making fun of in the antique dealer's display window are these so-called 'bedroom paintings':
"John... please..." The hand he'd been holding onto John with slid jerkily between John's legs. "Fuck me... touch me … anything … please... let me come..."
Sherlock couldn't deny his curiosity upon setting foot in the latter room. Whereas he'd kept his hands clasped behind his back up to this point, they now moved with a kind of restlessness … gliding over the soft leather of the seats, touching the smooth wooden surface of the desk, stroking the spines of the countless books … only to discover something.
Mycroft opened the attachment to the message, and both men stared at the black-and-white image of a young man, perhaps seventeen years of age. Slim, not very tall, with smooth black hair. Mycroft shrugged.
Sherlock's eyes glittered with amusement. "I'd even go one step further and maintain that the two of them were looking at some sex photos on Mycroft's phone."
John had no idea what to say to that at first. "Did you... do you really think I'd do something to you?" he asked, shaking his head in disbelief even as he gave Victor a lopsided smile. "Do you honestly think I'd want revenge... for something that happened over ten years ago?"
Sherlock lay on his back on the blue sheets, permeating the room - and John's ears - with his lust-filled moans. John had arranged him on the mattress so that his buttocks almost hung off the foot end of the bed.
