John hesitated. He didn’t want to think about it. How could he be expected to agree to this? It was all kinds of fucked up on all kinds of levels, yet still he saw a very clear answer that he’d hate himself for giving.
“John,” Sherlock said, after looking at John for a long time as if he were some new species of idiot, “shut up. You might have died of your injuries and your own stubbornness if I hadn’t called. It
Sherlock, with no idea how to act to remedy the situation, slammed the call button, and held John’s hands away to stop him from the pathetic attempts he was making to pick up his own vomit. A nurse took one look at the scene and immediately went for the locked cupboard at the other side of the little room.
There was a frustrated huff down the line. “You can’t even think for yourself!” his father cried. “How am I supposed to believe you can bulk up and join the army when you can’t even
Sherlock nodded and moved closer, taking John’s hand again. “I won’t say a word unless you want me to.”
Greg sighed again. He was quiet a for a minute. “I’m going to record the conversation and have someone listening. They’re going to cut you off if anything happens, alright?”
To emphasise his point, John sauntered into the corner and sank down into a brown leather armchair, rubbing his hands together. Sherlock squinted and turned his back to John to queue. But he didn’t mind buying him a drink. This was something normal people did, something couples did. It really
him. With a content sigh and an excitable grin, he couldn’t help but squeeze Sherlock’s hand. He must have been awake, because the hand in his squeezed back gently.
“He’s not dictating my life,” John argued. Well, he wasn’t now, not from behind those bars. “I just don’t want to be a doctor anymore. I’m capable of making my own decisions, and I’ve changed my mind for my own reasons. What were you planning on being, anyway? Last I heard, you were still working out the best path to becoming a professional mattress-tester.”
John thought for a moment as if he could actually afford a lawyer, before settling on: “My sister, please.”
“Yup,” John replied with a smile. He looked up and accepted it, opening to the starters. “You want a starter?”
John made a face at him and brought the oxygen mask back over his mouth. He needed some help catching his breath after all of the talking and eating – and, besides. Now he had a real reason to get better. Now he was going home with Sherlock.
"Of course you did." Sherlock stared at the fingerprints on John's wrist where his sleeve had ridden up. "But I don't mean today. I mean last year when you came in with a sling. It's still sore sometimes but it should have healed months ago. Why?"
“Inside me with your penis… Jesus.” John snorted and clapped his hands to his mouth so that his laughter wouldn’t be too loud.
Sherlock, unashamedly, used John as bait for most of the bit of afternoon they had left. Funnily enough, John didn’t remember ever consenting or even being asked to lure in the various drug dealers and sexual predators that roamed the streets of London, but that was what seemed to have happened. He didn’t question it, because, after a few seconds of actually thinking about it, it did seem to make more sense.
“Hey,” he called over his shoulder, dropping his paper in his lap. “It’s ten o’clock, I think you need to put some clothes on.”
John’s dad came to pick him up at seven o’clock that evening, and he didn’t touch him or say a word to him. No surprise there, really. He got scared when John was hospitalised, he always did. He’d leave off for a day, a week, until he was sure that nobody had worked anything out, and then it would all start up again. John ate his biscuits and hid them behind his bedside table, his evening calm for the first time in months.
He sighed. “Jesus,” he muttered, leaning in to rest his chin on the bed. “You’re bloody high again, aren’t you?”
In the meantime, he fixed himself some dinner and wasted some time watching it sleep. He couldn’t resist inspecting its teeth, which were the same as his. He had a look in his eyes, too, but they seemed fine. John gave in and went to bed, leaving a glass of water on the table by the sofa and leaving the door open a crack so it could leave if it figured out how.
“Mm…” John whimpered and his eyes went wide as he began to take in the various pains shooting through his body. “M’head.”
“I’m hanging out of the window, I was just checking on him—” Sherlock sighed. He couldn’t get his thoughts straight. “It was his dad,” he clarified. And then, in the hopes that he could give them some sort of reason to let him stay closer to John, he continued. “He’s my boyfriend and his dad has attacked him. He stopped answering my texts and I wanted to make sure he was okay. I can’t get in.”
“No-pe,” John boasted, his lips popping to emphasise the ‘p’. He opened his eyes and grinned at Sherlock. “What you got on your clothe? Clothes. Clotheses. Your… you’re wearing. Red.” John nodded to himself. “Red.”
He approached slowly, making sure to keep his footsteps audible but not loud, and it still startled. He’d heard the noises coming from the kitchen, and so went down the hall to that doorway first. It looked different. Very different. Especially with the deer-man trying to cower behind an open fridge door. The sight was not helped by the mugs hung over his antlers. John smiled.
“I don’t think so.” Sherlock rubbed his forehead. “But I’ll be here the whole time. It’s going to be okay. It won’t hurt a bit.”
“No,” John shook his head. He lowered his hands and pointed to his chest, and then his eyes. “Me see. Me, look at your head.”
fault? Everything he and Sherlock had been working on for days was in mind of the eventual goal of getting John to understand that
Sherlock bristled. “Keep those,” he said pointing fiercely at John’s bedside. “I’ll see you tomorrow, if you’re feeling better.”
The rapid crunches that had gradually been decreasing in volume suddenly stopped altogether. John stayed still and then changed his mind, straightening his posture as he listened hard for any more sounds. He didn’t hear any, but he did see those huge antlers appear. He could see only an inch of them as the faun hesitated, and then the rest began to appear. It was just as he’d seen from the kitchen, but this time the faun looked much less defensive and much more worried. John frowned.
“Harry,” John squeaked, and she let go. His eyes were watering, and he took a second to breathe, his hand on his chest as if to keep it together while he got his body back up and running. “God. Hospital gowns make you realise how cold the world actually is. Let’s go in.”
John kissed his shoulder again. “I won’t be forgetting that any time soon, if that’s what you were after.”
It was surreal, actually, how much danger managed to find them that night. John knew it was a bad area but, well, that bad? He hadn't thought so. Everywhere had its ups and downs but being a victim of two muggings, two drug deals gone wrong, and an armed robbery in one night was definitely a first for him. He didn’t remember how, but at some point over the course of the evening he’d lost his drink, and he only realised when they were already walking back towards the bus stop they’d come from.
He craned his head and managed to see the barest sliver of the hallway, along with the tall figure in the shadows from the bedroom that was repeatedly lowering its weight onto the floorboard.
“So… So I rub up,” Sherlock concluded. He wriggled around a bit more. “Bloody hell, John, my fingers don’t
His heart leapt at the sight of the desk – maybe he could send a letter to Fawnlock, maybe he could explain, maybe he could say goodbye because this really wasn’t looking good for him – but there would have been too many complications. They’d wonder why he was sending a letter to his own empty house, and of course they’d read it before they sent it. Maybe they’d try and find this ‘Fawnlock’ and question him, and then they’d be on the lookout for him when they couldn’t find him.
another panic attack, as there was nobody else here and his accompanying officers didn’t look very worried. Just a little bit of a scare? Or maybe they just genuinely didn’t give a shit. Mm, that was comforting.
He swallowed. The more he looked, the worse it seemed to get. “I, um, I mean… I don’t know. Yeah. There’s blood. He’s bleeding, from his head. His hand looks… something’s broken.” He swallowed again. “Um.” He cleared his throat. “I don’t know. He’s just in his room. He’s not moving.”
“Just step back, please,” the assisting medic said, putting an arm in front of him and keeping him sitting back on his heels. “We’re looking after him.”
Sherlock chuckled deeply and gave John a gentle shove in the direction of the Starbucks. “I suppose we could get some to go. What would you like?”
The service started a few minutes late, but nobody seemed to mind. A swarm of people had gathered in those final few minutes and when Sherlock blinked himself from his deducing daydreams about divorces and ex-servicemen he jumped and sauntered back a few steps. Too many people far too close to him. Right then there was a squeak of a microphone, the voice of a middle-aged man calling politely for attention and inviting everyone to join with him in a hymn, and an introduction from a small band under a gazebo nearby. A mass rustling sound echoed through the park as everybody fell silent and opened to the first page of their programmes, and the first chorus of
When he was finished the doctor left and a policeman he didn’t recognise came in to handcuff him again and lead him back to his cell. He had to stifle a yawn as best he could with his shoulder as he unlocked the gate for him. Truthfully, he was just thankful that the cuffs had been removed again. He collapsed onto the little bench, exhausted, and flopped sideways. He was certain he was meant to have a mattress but the pillow was good enough.
He’d felt a pang of spite and glared fiercely at him, but as soon as John had held up the Tesco bag he’d mellowed. It hung from his index finger, swinging gently, and John had just stood there staring at him.
“Everything alright?” he asked, fetching a few cardboard bowls and leaving them on the bedside table.
shout again.” On one hand, it was a bargaining chip. A mechanism of control that he could brush off later as such, if need be. On the other hand, it was
“Please,” John squeaked, thankful that the iron grip on his bad shoulder had finally been relinquished.
“Sorry for that interruption, by the way. I wasn’t expecting things to get so far along, but the traffic was pretty bad on the way over here – not to mention I had my own fair share of distractions. Fucking hell, John, you could at least try and look a little bit pleased.” Sebastian crouched down and picked out one of the keys, but John flinched and snatched his hands away from his touch. Sebastian rolled his eyes. “Oh, come on. It’s the keys. To your handcuffs. What the hell do you think I’m going to do,
“Legs,” he said softly, patting John’s thighs with his clean hand. John obediently spread his legs a bit further, gave Sherlock enough room to get his hand down there.
He slid his hand up to the curls on his head. The faun had no objections this time. His eyes had closed and he was slowly working his way to flopping over John’s legs, he was so relaxed. John grinned and sank his hand into the thick hair, trying to work out all the knots he’d fixed a few days ago.
Harry might have poked at the bruise of her brother’s obviously latent bisexuality if he hadn’t started actually explaining what had happened. “John,” she said softly – a rarity, for her. Soon enough, as her mind worked for the next few seconds, her face steeled. “Let me guess. He called you an idiot and a pansy and then proceeded to beat you into a more manly profession.”
It took them a long time to work up to three fingers. Sherlock was patient, going slowly and carefully and always stopping when John told him to. He hadn’t quite remembered where to find a prostate, so that had been a bit of an unexpected adventure for the both of them. Sherlock had first tried with just one finger, pushed it this way and that until John had pulled his hair a bit too hard at a particularly ungraceful jab, and then he’d decided to get himself a bit more room and try again.
It was a long and embarrassing process, and eventually, when he handed the form back a second time, the psychologist was a bit nicer. He took the sheets in, explained that if he ever wanted to talk, he should just call a nurse and ask for Adam, and then he promised that he’d have a look over the questionnaire and get back to him soon.
“Don’t be stupid, he’s just excited,” John argued softly, stacking the menus that he’d forgotten to taken. “He said he had a girlfriend.”
“It’s okay,” he said softly, holding up his hands innocently. The deer’s wide eyes stared at him from above the door. “It’s okay, I won’t hurt you.”
The office didn’t seem too showy at first, especially not in comparison to its main feature downstairs. It was on the large side and had one wall made up of panels of tinted windows. There were a couple of bookshelves, a plain rug underneath a wall-mounted television, and a desk with no accommodation for visitors except the small sofa on the opposite side of the room. The basics such as the furnishings were all John could manage to register when he first came in, mainly due to the guest sat on said small sofa.
John paid with his card, but Sherlock left a generous tip, mostly because at the end of the meal John looked so elated and proud of himself that he thought their waiter deserved a bit extra. Maybe, because of all the buffing up the man had done for his ego, John would be willing to go a bit further with him tonight.
“Twat,” John muttered, rolling his newly stiffened shoulder. “I thought you were some sort of professional.”
John had to think. It was a week earlier, near enough. “I was at home. It was raining, and I was trying to fix my TV.”
“Stop your fussing.” Sherlock stood up, had a look, and then changed his mind. “I’ll be right behind you.”
“A minute,” he said softly, and Sherlock could feel him relaxing bit by bit. “Just… Been a while since—you know.”
“What difference does it make? You’re still going to think the same things about me, whether or not you’ve got this crap.” John flicked the papers onto the floor.
They didn’t talk about it, not for a few weeks. John carefully skirted every vague question Sherlock hinted at, and Sherlock didn’t want to upset John and alienate the only close friend he’d ever had – he’d started spending all of his breaks with Sherlock, if he could find him. Sherlock had told him he should stay with his friends, but he argued every time. They lived in a sort of imbalanced equilibrium, happy to never mention anything to each other, but things came to a head one day a few weeks later, as they always tended to. This was what Sherlock had been waiting for.
On Friday, during school, his teacher had called his dad. John hadn’t been there, hadn’t had any idea about it at all until he’d gotten home, been smacked over the head with a strong fist, and locked in his room.
It wasn’t. John didn’t find it the least bit ‘okay’. The whole way through, he was light-headed from his wracked breathing and blind from the onslaught of tears that the pain brought with it. The procedure was neither short nor relieving, as he still couldn’t breathe even after they’d all pronounced him fit and left. He couldn’t handle it.
“I’ve already dealt with it. She’s in the waiting room. I wanted to make sure you were okay before she came back in.” Sherlock kissed his knuckles. John didn’t notice.
It had been a long time since his last one, but he wasn’t stupid enough to assume that they’d just gone away. He started awake with a gasp so fast and desperate that he felt his throat burning – or perhaps he’d been screaming? In any case, there seemed to be an officer smashing his baton between the bars of the cell and barking out his surname.
John shook that off, too. Fawnlock’s face was beginning to fall. He’d obviously put all of this on for John, and was expecting
“They need you awake so they know it’s worked, John. It’ll be okay.” Sherlock gave him a tight smile and patted his hand. “It’ll be over before you know it.”
“Because he’ll start on her if I’m not here. He says it all the time. ‘Do this or she gets it, do that or I’ll pull her out of school.’ I need to stay here.”
“Everything okay, John?” Miss Hart asked as he lagged behind, the last one leaving the room. Aside from Sherlock. As usual. “You look a bit pale.”
“You want me to check those?” John asked quietly, tapping Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock groaned an obvious negative.
Sherlock eased his hands onto John’s shoulders and then down behind them, pressing until he could feel the muscles near his shoulder blades ripple gently with every stroke his hand made over Sherlock’s lower back. He’d never been this close to John before but he could already tell that he was intoxicating. He was unlike any drug Sherlock had ever known and yet he certainly held all the properties of them; he sent a unique buzz straight through Sherlock’s veins, he had a magnificent effect on his thought process, and he was certainly proving to be addictive. Sherlock couldn’t get his mouth off him, not that John seemed to be complaining.
“I literally just told you how cold I am, and tonight’s the night you want to walk? You bastard.” John shook his head.
John took the wad of paper towels and wiped his mouth, his face the picture of confused heartbreak. Sherlock put his own hand over John’s and gave him a bit of assistance.
Originally, John had been planning on ignoring everything Sherlock said, smacking his hands away, and running home to wait for his dad. He had the scene in his head. He’d be sitting on the stairs, watching the front door. After a few days, it’d all blow over. A set of keys would jangle in the lock. The look on his dad’s face when he opened the door and John was sitting there…
“You don’t remember. You had hardly any money and you still bought me a dozen eggs that you knew I’d only set fire to.” Sherlock was looking excited now. He was almost grinning. “I didn’t know why before but I couldn’t delete it. I know now.”
John rubbed his chin, taken aback. He didn’t have many friends, or even talk to many people outside, of his immediate group, but the friends he did have were kind. They cared about him. He was glad, yet again, that he hadn’t had the guts to do anything regretful the previous year. The people had been right: it
He didn’t care what they’d ask of him. Let them throw what they could at him, he’d do anything. Anything to keep Fawnlock safe.
By the time he was done, there was no paint left on the rock. John frowned as he tossed the instruments into the water and ran to the bushes, searching the floor (once again, John avoided looking at his bum) to pick out some weedy little green-leafed plant. He selected a few white and a few purple flowers to adorn the bases of his antlers, poking them into his scraggly hair, and John found it fascinating to watch the concentration on his face as he wove the green plants together in what he could only assume was the definition of daisy chain.
He tried his best to ask at least what was going on. Only the first syllable made it out coherently, and he was subsequently steered and planted onto the sofa next to the thing. He swallowed.
Sherlock didn’t sing, but he could hear John humming under his breath. As the service plodded on, with more hymns and a short reading from the bible by a local priest, he noticed John’s face getting steadily less and less respectful and more… well, sad. He just looked sad. He wondered if maybe he wanted to leave now and watch the rest on television, but he was listening intently to every word being said in every speech.
It was obvious that he was thinking about what day it was. Sherlock was thinking about it, too. They both had poppies on the coats hanging off the door, John’s a silver badge pinned to his lapel and Sherlock’s a paper one stuck through his matching red buttonhole. He made a point to get a new one every year, usually spending all the change he had on his person. John ended up buying a new one each year, too, but it was mostly because he always misplaced his previous ones.
John sighed and grimaced as Sherlock pressed his cold hands all over his head. Then he tried to think and, sure enough, it wasn’t long until the answer came to him. Sherlock shocked him by reaching his freezing hands under his jumper and pulling his trousers up far too high, and it was with that final yelp of pain and surprise that it solidified in his head.
After a moment he pried Fawnlock from his torso and ushered him inside, closing the door behind him. The house was cold, but, Jesus, it was good to be home. Fawnlock was stuck to his side like a limpet as he went to turn the heating on and stash the money he’d taken.
John lowered his chin as he took a deep breath. This was the home stretch, he thought, holding tightly onto Sherlock’s hand. It was almost over. There were wreaths to lay, prayers to be said, a grateful farewell speech to hear, and then John could go home and go to bed for a while. That was all he wanted to do.
“This again? God. Alright, John. I’m going to explain it to you one more time, and you have to listen. Everything I’m about to tell you is the truth. Does that make sense?” Sebastian slowed down and slapped on a patronising smile at the last question.
John put the bag by the door. He went to change into his pyjamas for the evening and when he got back, Fawnlock was crouched over next to the door, towel abandoned on the sofa. As John approached he saw him rearranging the chains and flowers on the bag, spreading them out to dry them off. John rested his hand on an antler. He knew Fawnlock could feel the weight. He didn’t seem to mind.
“My mum.” John sniffed a few more times, soaked the tissue with his tears. “She hugs me. Hugged me. Sometimes hugs me still.”
Sherlock bearing that thought in mind was the only reason they’d managed to survive the dinner as peacefully and quickly as they had. They’d only had one course, and then a coffee each, but, even with the fantastic service, it had still taken them two hours. Sherlock thanked the Gods that he hadn’t wanted a starter; it probably would have added an extra hour to their time, and he wanted to kiss John again. It had been all he could think about all through their meal.
John smiled. “Perhaps you don’t know the joys of double-glazing, but I dream about it frequently. I’ve never stayed in Central before,” he mused. “Maybe he’ll put you somewhere with a view. I’d love to see the city.”
Sherlock’s breath fogged the glass as he peeked over the sill again, and he stayed until he could see John’s back moving minutely. “Yeah,” he said, the relief obvious. “Yes, he’s breathing.”
Sherlock kissed him again, this time with his lips parted and dipping into John’s at every opportunity. John was a fantastic kisser – and, from the other end, John thought that Sherlock was, too, even if he was a little bit out of practice. He’d never experienced kissing like this before: kissing with a balance between lust and emotion. Not this sort of balance, at least. It was hard to pin down, as everything with Sherlock was, but both of them felt, somewhere, that it was more like sharing than giving or taking. The urgency was there but it was only bobbing along the bottom or the back of their minds. Even in the few serious relationships John had ever had, foreplay hadn’t been this sincere.
“What?” he asked suspiciously, turning back to Fawnlock. Fawnlock seemed to be keeping a deliberately blank face. “What is it, what’s inside?”
, and you can stop that right now, thanks.” He glanced up at Sherlock, who had frozen, still staring silently down at his phone screen. “Besides,” he continued, swallowing, “I’d be long gone if I’d told him anything like that. No, I just told him I still wanted to be a doctor.”
Once they’d eaten, John went around and gathered all of the plates and mugs from the living room without a single complaint. Sherlock resolved that sex really did put people in better moods, and made a mental note of that fact for when he next had to tell John he’d done something horrible with a rotting organ again. Sherlock, satisfied after finally getting first John and then lunch, sat slumped in his seat with his fingers laced over his stomach. He knew he didn’t eat as frequently as was encouraged, but he didn’t think he needed to. Even a sandwich was enough to fill him to the point of bloating.
John’s heart sank as he hung up the phone. His hands were bound again before he had time to realise what was happening, and he was being gently ushered back towards his cell. When he had been returned he tucked himself back under the blanket and covered his face with his hands to wait for this hearing that would most definitely send him to prison for a crime he didn’t remember committing.
“Mm?” John answered, rolling his head around to meet Sherlock’s eye. Somehow over the course of the last hour he’d slumped right down the sofa.
Sherlock started counting. He held the mask against John’s face with what was likely too much force, but he really didn’t like the idea of an even more damaged lung. He kept counting and breathing with John until tears were no longer streaming down his cheeks and the healthy flush returned to his sickly white face.
John thought) had grinned in response to what Sebastian had said, and put its sharp teeth on full display for John to enjoy as he saw fit. They were odd teeth, really. John gathered that they were more human than wolf, but much sharper once they reached the canines and back. He didn’t spend very long dwelling on them, instead letting his eyes take in the black-furred canine ears, legs, and clawed fingernails. This one seemed a lot more animalistic than his Fawnlock. The black eyes were certainly a bit more unnerving than Fawnlock’s rich brown.
Sherlock didn’t really know what to say to that. John was lying, that much was obvious. He felt like it was his duty, perhaps, as a soldier, to honour their fallen heroes, his duty more than it was anybody else’s because that was how John thought sometimes. Even if he did need a reason to have missed it, he’d have had one, because if Sherlock was correct in his calculations (he’d never asked) John would only have been in his first or second month home in November two years ago. Sherlock wasn’t an idiot; he knew John had been depressed. Not for conventional reasons, perhaps, but he had been, and that was all that was important. He’d have been lonely and depressed and just invalided home from Afghanistan – who
He hadn’t been planning on closing the door, but he realised as soon as they passed the doorway that there was a small chance Mrs Hudson could decide to pop in and say hello. She never opened a fully closed door, so Sherlock swung John around once they’d gotten inside and slammed the door shut behind him.
Bleary-eyed, he took his time waking up, but, no matter how hard he tried, couldn’t work out what time or day it was. The one thing that seemed to be firmly stamped in his head was the echoing memory of his father, and the words, ‘I love you, too.’
“Are you seeing how this is all tying together now?” Moran asked, putting his cigarette back in his mouth and tapping his fingertips together under his chin.
When he gingerly opened the door, a policeman was staring back at him. “Dr. John Watson? Police. I’m arresting you on suspicion of murder.”
“There’s a table for two just freed up right at the back. Do you want to sit now, or would you like it cleared first?” the man asked, pointing around the bar.
Fawnlock’s vocabulary, although widening rapidly, was still limited. As he picked off a vine and chewed at the end of it for a moment, John had to assume he was getting a snack, and he waited. Then Fawnlock pulled the vine from his mouth to reveal a mulched-up tip. John frowned, but continued his silence as Fawnlock started to lick the mush into a pointed shape. His disgust turned into proper confusion when Fawnlock started blowing on it as they kept walking.
John glanced around, but everybody was talking amongst themselves and not paying them the least bit attention. "Tell them what?" John said, ready to deny everything again as soon as he had to.
“Not all night,” he replied, dropping the magazines on his bed. “Just for the rest of the afternoon. This bit’s my date.”
John took his time again, making sure to study each one in turn, but eventually shook his head. “No.”
“Okay.” John sat up and pecked Sherlock’s lips again, not quite able to get over the fact that he was maybe on his way to being able to do that whenever he wanted. “When?”
They slipped into a sad silence. Well, the sad was mostly on John’s end, but Sherlock was hardly the best of remedies. He was a cool exterior with a floundering mind, scrabbling around for purchase on a slippery floor, because what the hell was he supposed to say now? Nothing, maybe. Were they supposed to be happy when they turned up for the service, even? God, he wished he remembered more about etiquette for these sorts of things. He counted himself lucky that John didn’t seem to mind the mutual silence.
“Oh.” John winced again and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. “I didn’t call them. I swear I didn’t.”
“Hey,” he scolded, and it instantly jumped away to bare its antlers at John again with some quiet clinks. John fought the urge to laugh at the stupidity of the situation. “Look. Bag, for you. Your things.”
on first dates, but… but technically this is the end of our second date and we’ve already gone a bit far once, before we’d even had any dates at all, so really, really you should.”
“Like you’re on your own,” Sherlock deduced slowly, “and you have nowhere. But that’s not true, John. You’re not on your own at all, because I’m right here, and there are people at all sides keeping you safe and sound and willing to talk to you for hours until you feel better. And you’ll always have a place with me.”
“Yes,” John moaned as Sherlock accidentally rocked against just the right place. “Yes, I… Keep going.”
“You want me to look weedy,” John concluded, letting Sherlock zip his jacket all the way up again, right up past his collar. “You think that a lot more people are going to see me as a much easier target if I look like I’ve never thrown a punch my whole life.”
After a week of staying and sniffing out everything in John’s cottage and struggles with failing to get Fawnlock to sleep in his own bed – John had needed several extra trips to the vegetable stalls of the market and he suspected the latter was because of Fawnlock’s insatiable hunger for heat – Fawnlock seemed to have decided that it was time to take John to where he lived.
Sherlock grumbled, shoving one of the medium-sized drinks towards John. He took him by his free hand and pulled him up. “You owe me about four pounds.”
John’s arm started moving fast again as he pumped his cock with renewed fervour, finally racing towards the climax he’d been aching for. A few seconds later his muscles were pulling tight around Sherlock and he came with a long groan, spurting white ropes all up both his and Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock followed soon after, thrusting hard once, twice, three times into John before he stopped and went rigid with a deep moan. He thrust a few more times after that, each time a bit slower, before finally pulling out and collapsing on his front next to John.
The raging fire that used to be his life had been put out, and he had to accept that, but it didn’t mean he had to like it. He just had to start a new fire.
“… May we have such a devotion to justice and freedom that the heroism of all who fought, and still fight, may continue to be remembered in a nation of service and in a world of peace.”
All Sherlock could think to do was wrap his arms around John and hug him close. He even thought as far as cupping his head to his shoulder so he had a place to hide his face while he cried.
“Boys,” the radiologist interrupted, “I’m sorry, but it really is important we get on fixing this as soon as possible. I’m going to go and call a doctor in to sort you out, alright?”
Sherlock didn’t move. He wasn’t so sure. “He was unconscious for a long time,” he muttered. “And…” He cleared his throat. “And he wouldn’t let them touch him until they’d jammed a painkiller into him. He couldn’t breathe.”
John replied with nothing but a tremendously breathy cackle from behind his mask, starting quietly and slowly building up to deep, infectious giggles.
Adam nodded slowly. “Alright. But if you want him out at any point, say so. And you have to leave if I request so.”
Sherlock scoffed. “If any of the comments she’s left on your blog are at all like her real self, I’d rather keep well away. Thank you for the thought.”
John looked up at him and smiled. Then, placing the menu until it was blocking the rest of the restaurant, he leaned down and rested his chin on his hands. Under the safety of the cover the menu provided, he said, “If we weren’t in public I’d kiss you right now.”
He sat still for another two seconds and then sprang off the sofa, dressing gown billowing out behind him. His attention turned to the cupboards for a moment before he marched back in, collected his tea, and then marched right back out again. John smiled to himself as he heard the crockery clink and some cutlery clatter from behind. He hadn’t read a word since Sherlock had made his offer, but he was finding it very funny to watch Sherlock get so flustered over something as normal as saying thanks.
“John?” he called desperately, crawling through and then over to him. “John, can you hear me?” He carefully lifted John’s wounded arm and rolled him over, lifting his bloodied head to cradle it in his lap. He tapped his cheek a few times. “It’s Sherlock. Please wake up. John.”
While his body had been going around being a criminal, his mind had been off gallivanting in the forest, plucking some flowery fairy tale deer creature out of the corner of his imagination to make him fall in love with.
He put the tub down with a content sigh and closed his eyes, hands rested on his stomach. “God. That was amazing. We need to get that again.”
John looked confused, and he shuffled closer to Sherlock, not wanting to make their relationship status obvious but still wanting to comfort him. “I know you do,” he said softly, “but I’m fine, I really am. I’ve been in more dire situations than this.”
After the interview John was told to wait in the room, but he hadn’t been told why. Being honest, he wasn’t really thinking about that part of things when he had bigger problems to worry about.
“At least the rain has stopped, I suppose,” he mentioned as he stepped outside. Sherlock hummed gently in agreement. “Have you got your poppy on?”
When he moved into his living room to start tidying there, he spotted his cane. It was still propped by the door where he’d left it going to help the… Thing. A slow smile spread across his face and he stood up from his kneeling position. A few cautious lunges later he did a quiet chuckle to himself.
Sherlock stood up and hugged John’s head to his middle, letting him hide his face until he could gather himself again.
“No, Dr. Watson. You’ll want to keep that on.” A paramedic crouched down next to where he was sat by the motorway and gently pulled his hand away. When he looked around, there was his arresting officer sat beside him and handcuffed to him. John lifted his knees and rested his forehead on them, closing his eyes with some deep, calming breaths.
. John felt like the worst person in the world when Fawnlock’s smile fell away and he looked at the floor. He stood up quickly.
“No, you kidnapped me from my own court case. I’m not sure that’s quite the same,” John snapped, following Sebastian from the car. “Where the hell are we?”
“No visitors, ma’am,” he repeated firmly, stepping in front of her. “He’s got someone in there already, and I’m under strict instructions.”
“Here,” John said, lifting their coats of the hook and tossing Sherlock’s over to him. Sherlock caught it with one hand and laid it across his lap, busy with his phone. John shrugged his own on and patted each pocket on his person, double-checking that he had everything he needed for their trip out.
By the time he found Fawnlock, he was already painting the markings onto his face. John didn’t have time to marvel over the river he hadn’t known existed, because he had his curious gaze switched over to Fawnlock.
Sherlock gave him a sidelong glance, a slight squint at his eyes. “Is that a romantic gesture or a lazy suggestion?”
Firstly, John tried to teach his company how to read and write. He provided flash cards so he could learn English, and once he had all the resources, the faun was happier to be left to his devices and teach himself. Unfortunately, he learnt his name wrong and refused to admit it, so John had had to change his name to Fawnlock. He couldn’t find it in himself to be annoyed. He found it painfully adorable every time Fawnlock got the wrong end of the stick.
It sidestepped its way into the living room with an armful of souvenirs from its search, all the while sticking to the walls. John watched it keenly as it skirted the room, and, even though he wanted to, didn’t offer it a bag. He didn’t want to scare it away. Maybe if it realised he wasn’t a threat, it would come again.
He lifted his hand and stroked over his own head, feeling how smooth it was. He sat up, and John let him. John also let him switch their positions so that John’s head was leaning against his own shoulder. Then John let him start returning the favour in the best way he knew how; with his tongue. It was weird, but far too sweet for him to put a stop to it.
But his mind certainly hadn’t stopped. If anything it had gone faster, and the thousands of buzzing thoughts had turned from their speedy circling into a wild tornado of noise and sensation. He knew he should have preferred the former, because that was much more ordered and easy to handle, and yet… And yet, he preferred the latter. He preferred the unpredictability of the latter, and the amount of John that was in it. He preferred that the ache in his chest was finally easing. He preferred that he was kissing John.
“Calm down, John. Calm down. Deep breaths. You’re alright, hon. Hey, it’s alright.” She took his hand and held his mask in place, but her eyes were focused on something at the end of whatever piece of stone he seemed to be lying on. “Deep breaths. Easy. I know it’s a bit scary, but we’re going to help.”
John let that slide. He closed his eyes with a shallow sigh, exhaustion taking him. Surely Sherlock wouldn’t mind if he had a little nap. “Where Harry’s gone?”
Adam’s nostrils flared and he picked them up and put them back on the bed. “They’ll be important for the case against your dad in court,” he said quietly, pretending to leaf through his folder.
He took another step forwards, wishing the God damned rain would stop for just ten seconds and let the moon come out. He couldn’t see a bloody thing.
“Good,” Sherlock said. He turned his ear towards the door as he heard some harsh knocks from downstairs. “There we go. Soon, they’ll be here soon. Just stay calm.”
Eventually he gave in and searched “faun”. He went straight to the images this time, and the first two were human with ram horns and goat legs, but the third seemed promising.
“It’s probably just the morphine,” the nurse explained, “don’t worry. I’m sure it’ll wear off soon. Use those if you need them.” He nodded his head towards the bowls and brought over some clean blankets, gathering the dirty ones up before setting the clean ones at the end of the bed. “Here, mate, wipe your mouth.”
John moved back slightly, resting back more firmly against Sherlock. He sniffed gently and opened his eyes, lifting his chin. The next reader stepped up and started a new poem about a soldier, but all Sherlock could think about was John. He was in two minds; every word the young girl said reminded him of John, and what John had done, but there John himself was, leaning against him, being company for him. They’d never been this close before. His heart fluttered slightly in his chest, and he beat down the entirely inappropriate urge he had to slide his hands around his friend’s waist and rest his cheek on his head. Apparently, friends didn’t do that.
John shrieked, standing up, balled fists at his side and shaking again. He was pulled back down by a clawed hand at his shoulder and a stern growl.
“You still don’t really understand,” Sherlock said softly, closing his eyes and tucking his face into John’s shoulder.
Harry couldn’t speak. John had flopped back against the bed and turned so he had his back to both of them. His hands, one finally snatched from Sherlock’s, were wrapped around his middle, desperately trying to hold his ribcage together as his breathing sped up and started crackling wildly. She’d seen him upset before, certainly, but this was beyond anything she’d ever experienced. She could’ve taken care of herself, she wanted to say, but, for once, the words wouldn’t come out of her mouth. It made her sick with guilt to think that John had put himself through hell because he’d thought he was protecting her.
Sherlock tipped his head back down and kept undoing John’s buttons, starting the pecks again. He kissed straight down the centre of John’s chest, circled around his belly button, and followed the faint trail of hair leading down to his crotch. As soon as he reached the more sensitive skin John’s breathing picked up and he smiled to himself. After another little kiss he crawled back up the half-stripped body and returned to John’s mouth, leaving one hand down there.
At three o’clock that afternoon, a tall figure came to stand at the foot of his bed and, much to his surprise, it was Sherlock. John blinked at him.
he loves you. It’s not that he can’t stand to have his hands on you, or whatever you think it is. It’s that he wants you to live.”
In a split second, Sherlock came closer still and kissed him. It was a simple, gentle press of lips, but it was warm and comforting, and everything John needed. It took him a second to remember how to kiss back. Strange, really, he supposed. He’d never kissed a boy before, but, as far as memory served, it felt almost identical to kissing a girl. Or maybe that was just Sherlock. The longer it went on, the more he had to remind himself that, actually, this wasn’t their first kiss. They’d done this before, Sherlock had said, but it definitely didn’t feel like it.
It was with this thought that he found himself right back at his own door again. A quick check to his phone said he’d been walking for an hour. The rain had just begun to let up but by no means was it dry. He still couldn’t see more than ten feet away. Somehow, drenched to the bone and shivering like a child, he didn’t mind going back inside. He dug his key out and fought with the old lock for a few minutes.
“D.I. Samuel Wells questioning Dr. John Hamish Watson, arrested on suspicion of murdering Mr. Richard Brook. Time, eleven hundred hours.” Wells finally looked up at a bewildered John and then flipped open his folder. He picked out a photo and slid it in front of John. “Do you recognise this man?”
“Sherlock,” he rasped, reaching with his bad hand to pat him on the arm. He had his attention immediately. “Where’s Harry?”
The older man gave him a tiny smile. “You had a panic attack. Everything’s alright now, but we’re going to take you to the police station in the ambulance to make sure you’re alright.”
“They’ll put you somewhere safe,” Sherlock continued quietly, his hand snaking across John’s waist until he was half-hugging him, because yes, he really looked close to tears now. “You’ll have people to give you enough food, and clean clothes, and hugs all the time.”
One day, months after his starvation incident (his dad had since only banned him from one meal a week, if ever), he came to school with the most obvious bruise he'd ever dared let anyone see. His whole cheek was pink from a smack that morning – he thought he did deserve that one a little bit for forgetting to lock up before everyone had gone to bed the night previous – and he was sporting a bit of a black eye. Sherlock appeared next to him in their registration period when John finally lifted his face from his arms.
“No, John.” Sherlock frowned. “You need to stay here so they can fix you and take care of you. I’ll bring you your work if you want.”
Sherlock growled in frustration. He lifted John’s hand, still in his, and put it over his chest. He was getting increasingly squirmy and (could John’s eyes have been deceiving him?) he was even beginning to blush slightly.
He considered offering a walk around the shops or a stop at a café but then John would know that something was up, and later on he’d get the piss taken out of him for trying to do something kind. That was always what happened. Today he left it, staring down at the pavement all the way home and growing to accept that he’d probably have this strange yearning in his chest for the rest of his life. It had flared today when he’d taken John’s hand, but he’d get used to it just as he had the softer feeling.
John snorted. He sighed and picked them up again, keeping his knees up to hide his answers as he worked through.
pillow. This concrete slab was freezing, and he was too tired to ask for a blanket, but he tried to get some sleep. The anxiety of his night had worn him out so much he was certain he could feel the bags under his eyes getting heavier each time he blinked.
First of all, he had antlers. Huge ones, that John was sad it was too late to put Christmas lights on, with sharp ends that he had no doubt could blind him purely by accident. As his gaze swept down over the body a lot more things became clear, including his realisation that this thing wasn’t actually all that muddy. The dark patches seemed to actually be markings.
John nodded slowly. “But there’s one thing you still haven’t told me. Two things, really. What do you want?” He spoke slower, making sure every word got across.
“John,” Sherlock said. He came to the bed and sat on the edge of it, taking John’s hands and holding them close. On autopilot, he kissed his knuckles. “Listen to me, you’re fine. You’re safe.”
It was only a few minutes before an officer in a suit came in with what John assumed was a recording device. It was placed on the table between them. The man put down a thick file and then pressed a button on the thing, turning on a red light. Definitely a recorder.
“Oh… Fuck. I mean, damn. Hold on. Go and hide.” John gestured to the bedroom urgently, relieved when Fawnlock followed a command he surely didn’t understand. John seemed frantic, John
also existed. He wasn’t sure how the last few hours of the day had slipped away from him, he really wasn’t, but he was damn certain that it was something to do with
Harry laughed under her breath, and John felt Sherlock stroking the back of his hand with his thumb. He rolled onto his back again and let the silence calm them all down after the discussion. His head, however, was roaring. Harry wasn’t really very good at keeping in touch, and tended to be a lot more of a free spirit in comparison to John. He had no idea when he’d get to see her again, but still, he didn’t want to tell either of them that he’d spoken to his dad the day before. Sherlock definitely would have been furious at him. So… maybe a different approach.
Once they had a basic form of language going, things got a lot easier. Tenses were still a mystery to Fawnlock, but John had spent years serving in a foreign country where most of them could speak partial English, so deciphering what he meant was easy. Besides, Fawnlock was an astonishingly fast and eager learner. John supposed that, being as he’d likely lived alone his whole life, it was an essential self-preservation trait to be able to learn.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock asked, looking him over. John nodded again, smiling slightly. “What did you actually say to him?”
Not just of the constant deafening silence (weren’t forests supposed to be full of life?) or the dreary weather (whatever happened to the summers he’d been promised?) or the general lack of presence all around him (“vibrant green vitality of the forest” his arse), but of everything.
Sherlock shuffled closer to John. He put his hand on the hipbone closest to him and held firm, but not hard. "Everyone needs someone," he insisted.
“I don’t believe this,” he continued, quieter this time, though it was more out of shock. “I don’t believe it. Don’t the police know it’s a fake?”
He had a feeling the questioning had gone badly. They had very clear evidence that he had brutally assaulted and killed an innocent man last Monday evening; the fact that he was telling them he had no memory of it, and no proof that he hadn’t actually done it, wasn’t looking good for him. Apparently his living half the country away from the site wasn’t enough evidence. If that wasn’t enough, his bum was starting to go numb again.
John blushed deeply, barely biting back an ecstatic grin. “I don’t remember.” He shrugged, plucking at the blanket. “Just stuff, I guess. The rest doesn’t matter. Not to me.”
Just told him I’d be staying with Sherlock. And that I’d see him later in the week. I’m going when I get out of here. JW
“We’re only taking him for an x-ray,” the nurse said, taking his hands from the railing and getting the bed moving again. “He’ll be back up in ten minutes.”
There was a cold slab behind his legs, under his thighs. He wasn’t sure what had happened but when he opened his eyes he was sat on a stone bench outside the courthouse, across the car park from the police car that had brought him in. Another panic attack, then. Or, rather,
Sherlock stepped a tad closer, and John shuffled further into him. They were close, really close. He couldn’t help but note that if he puckered his lips and tipped his head a bit, he’d be brushing his lips against John’s forehead. He swallowed down the squeak that threatened to beat its way up out of his throat and tilted his head down, closed his eyes.
Sherlock frowned, but he did return the chaste kiss John pressed to his lips. “Are you sure?” he asked, sitting back on his heels.
John busied himself with squinting sceptically up at the building they’d parked in front of. “It’s… It’s a bowling alley.”
John opened his eyes to find Harry staring at him, a thoughtful and stormy frown clouding her face. He shrugged and tipped his head back again. “I cook what I need. It’s fine.”
He turned around so they could handcuff him as they reeled off his rights, and caught a glimpse of Fawnlock staring with wide eyes from the doorway of his bedroom. John shook his head minutely, and he disappeared. He could only hope the faun had gotten the right idea and was at least planning to escape out of the window, because before he got another chance to check, he was turned around and walked back towards a waiting police car.
John’s head was hanging down, his chin back to his chest. The tears were rolling endlessly down his cheeks, but his shoulders hitched occasionally with sharp, stuttering sniffles. “Why?”
As he diverted his pecks back to the pink lips beneath his the remaining hand cupped the soft bulge he could feel in John’s trousers and squeezed gently, beginning to rub. John groaned quietly into the kiss, his hips pushing up into Sherlock’s hand appreciatively. His hands went from around Sherlock’s back to his front, where he began pushing the jacket from his shoulders and undoing his shirt buttons. He reached the last button and Sherlock pulled his hand back to the zip of John’s trousers, where he released the one button there and pulled the zip down.
“What?” John frowned again, now more annoyed than anything. Why couldn’t he just tell him, for God’s sake?
John shook his head again, his face still pressed against Sherlock’s chest. “I don’t want to, Sherlock.”
It took a full minute for John to catch up, and even then he didn’t see any of these points linking. Ever. Being honest, the next bit didn’t help at all, either.
“Marylebone, in London,” he answered clearly. “I’m not at liberty to divulge any more information at this point.”
“Close your eyes,” John parroted, with the emphasis on all the wrong words. Sherlock could tell he was speaking just for the sake of speaking.
Once he was certain he couldn’t feel anything to badly broken, he decided to inspect the head. He put the torch back between his knees so the edge of the light just managed to reach the man’s face and combed his fingers through soaking knots of hair. He couldn’t comb his hand through for more than a centimetre at a time but each time he pulled his hand out he was relieved to feel nothing wet that wasn’t water. That being said, he hadn’t checked the back of his head yet.
John, after staring at Sherlock for a few seconds just to make sure, backed away and sat down in his own chair. Sherlock’s heart did the clenching flutter again at the concern he saw in his expression.
With a warm embrace around his hand, the rest of the service seemed to pass quickly. A veteran laid one with a salute, an old man neither of them recognised laid one, a couple of child cadets laid one. There was a final hymn and then a goodbye that invited everyone to stay and watch the procession of scooters, but neither John or Sherlock understood any reason for there being scooters at a Remembrance Day service, so they turned around and left, Sherlock still holding John close.
John frowned as he sat back to read the questions. There weren’t too many, and they were all closed questions with simple “Yes” or “No” answers. John assumed these officers thought he must have had some sort of personality disorder judging by some of these questions.
Sherlock’s hand moved to capture John’s and hold it there, to his heart. “Are you always going to be my friend?”
“No, soldiers are supposed to be smart. They have to be able to predict exactly when and where they need to be paying attention, and organise appropriate surprise attacks and strikes on enemies. They need to be able to work in a team, and lead a team, which means understanding all sorts of things about other people, and common sense. They need to be able to think on their feet and decide what’s best for their team at that time.” Why, yes, Sherlock definitely was going to use John’s ‘dream’ against him. If it was the only way to make him understand his own worth, they would be using it.
“If I get stabbed tonight, I’m going to be so pissed off with you,” John muttered, stalking past Sherlock and plodding off down the road. Sherlock grinned at the back of his head but said nothing.
John already knew. He was sure he already knew, but maybe, just maybe, they’d say something easy to listen to.
John was woken the next morning by what sounded suspiciously similar to a glass breaking. He sat up in bed, his first thought
He pointed frantically in the direction of the door, knocking on it for emphasis. Fawnlock’s eyes flickered to the door, and then he disappeared. John stepped forwards again. He could hear a gentle scuffle and some scratching on the other side of the wood, and could only hope that Fawnlock was trying to figure out how to open the door. It was a good sign that it took him so long; at least nobody else had gotten in.
“Not all muggers are teenagers,” came the reminder as John crossed his arms. “That’s just a stereotype.”
Harry heaved a sigh and moved her chair closer. Sherlock was tempted to open his mouth and intervene, because he could see a certain
Admittedly, John had assumed he didn’t actually live anywhere. The thought was heart-breaking and the main reason John had never questioned letting Fawnlock stay with him. The journey had been… Eye-opening.
“I’m so sorry that happened to you,” he murmured, stroking John’s hair. “I’m so sorry that all of this has happened to you, and I wish I could try and help, but anything I do needs your full cooperation. You deny a single thing and they can’t do anything.”
Come Monday morning, John had collected his confiscated brick phone from the shelf by the door and all of his homework was safely packed in his bag – including the two pieces he’d failed to give in the week before. He barely made it to school through the haze of starvation-induced exhaustion, but he plodded on one step at a time until he could sink into his chair at the back of Miss Hart’s classroom and put his face in his arms on the desk. He thanked every God he could think of that nobody sat next to him during these registration periods to chatter mindlessly at his tired brain. Sherlock Holmes was watching him from across the room, but he always did that. John ignored the way the pale eyes seemed to prick his skin and kept his head down. Mostly, John found him quite funny in the real, amusing sense, but when he stared, he
go to prison today. He had no evidence to support his case, perhaps not even the mental health assessments he’d taken.
Not really. Maybe? Can’t tell. He was horrible, and then I told him I loved him and he said it back, and then he said, ‘Son, get help’. But he said it. JW
John grinned and broke into a quiet fit of giggles, pulling Sherlock closer with the arm spread across his body. Soon enough, his ribs started aching, and they slowed to a gentle stop.
Sherlock sat up with a major huff, practically stamping his foot on the ground. “John, why do you ask me
John shook his head firmly. He pulled at his collar, hot all over. “No. Don’t leave me. Please, please don’t leave me on my own.”
“Please don’t use that language with me. You’re disrespecting both me and the authorities protecting this patient, and if you don’t step away now, I’m going to have to escort you out of the building.” With his outstretched hand, he took her arm and pushed her back so she was in front of him.
“I’m never safe around you,” John muttered, but he shuffled closer to Sherlock anyway when the cold, dry wind hit his face. “God, it’s freezing.”
“Yeah,” John breathed – or, rather, rasped. He gave up and covered his mouth with the oxygen mask for a minute, closing his eyes. “Mm, remember a bit of it.”
“So wh… what do I do? Where am I supposed to go? Why can’t you just tell me, because every answer I try to give is the wrong one, and I don’t want to keep trying anymore.” John put his face in his free hand.
“I’m just saying,” Harry said, holding her hands up, “if you walk into any room that has Dad in it and Sherlock is with you, you’re going to end up exactly the same way I did: being called every name in the book and a few more creative combinations besides.”
Sherlock thought impatiently. John looked back at him, really looking quite nervous, but Sherlock gave him an encouraging nod and watched him walk a bit faster. His head went down and his hands shoved deep into his pockets and, just like that, he’d assumed his unassuming character for the evening.
“You won’t have time to read all of those before we go out,” John mumbled in a vague attempt to get him to put them back.
“There it is,” he mumbled, pulling his hair again but this time to bring him down and kiss him. Sherlock rubbed over the spot again and he moaned gently into the kiss. “Alright, that’s enough playing.”
“John Watson,” the one Sherlock recognised as Lestrade said. “I’m Greg Lestrade, and this is Sally Donovan. We’re just here to talk to you a bit about what’s going to happen with you.” He glanced pointedly at Sherlock.
“Harry!” John cried again, hitting her arm. She’d said it on purpose, he knew. She’d known Sherlock had been asleep. “It’s fine, Sherlock. Honestly, he was alright. I was just checking on him.” He turned and tried to smile. “Trust me.”
“Mm,” the officer on duty frowned at him. “Would you like some water? You’d have been due a drink, anyway.”
The better part of the next hour passed without a word between them, but it went that way sometimes. Today Sherlock seemed to be turning all the cupboards out in search of something, and John wasn’t really in the mood for a chat, but he was keeping a close eye on the time. Regent’s Park was just a short walk away but he wanted to be there in good time and it was already ten o’clock.
of a douchebag?” John asked, holding his hands up and away from him as Sherlock pulled the hem of his jumper down to a straight line over the waistband of his jeans. “Surely this is counterproductive.”
John sniffed sharply. A tear rolled from the corner of his open eye down to his temple, and Sherlock wiped it away with his sleeve. “I don’ wanna hug,” he whispered, sniffling again.
He tried “half deer half man”, which got him a lot of people suggesting things like satyr, and centaur, and one person saying faun, which, according to the next answer, was wrong. He knew centaur wasn’t right. Satyr turned up a picture of a human with ram horns, which definitely wasn’t right.
“Nobody’s given me an erection I haven’t wanted in ten years,” he murmured, rubbing his thumbs over the backs of John’s fingers. “Not one person.”
John didn’t answer. He stayed sitting there like a shy dog, letting Sherlock stare at him and pity him, only covering his crotch with his hands to keep himself at least partially hidden.
He’d taken a cold shower and determinedly pulled his suit back on, refusing to let the heat put him out of his usual, cool self, and, when he’d finally finished messing around with his hair in attempt to get it to look less like that of a ragdoll, he came out to find John waiting for him. His hair was stuck to his forehead with sweat and his breathing was slightly laboured, suggesting he’d only just got in, but his too-small jumper was already off and he was leaning casually against the doorway to the kitchen in an attempt at making Sherlock believe he’d been waiting for a while.
“It’s not because of that,” he explained. “It’s because if you didn’t have a morphine drip in your arm, you wouldn’t be nearly as affectionate as you are right now, and it wouldn’t be fair to you to continue on like this. It can wait until you’re not drugged up. It’s not going to change things on my end.”
“And hey. Son.” John listened – he couldn’t remember the last time his dad had called him that. “Get some help.”
“Good boy,” Moran praised patronisingly, catching both objects with a victorious flick of each wrist. He tucked the gun into the waistband of his trousers and slid from the table again and, in one fluid movement with two satisfying clicks, John had his hands back.
John trailed off, blinking hard, and felt Sherlock’s warm fingers worm their way between his. He held them and tried again.
“John!” he cried, fingers digging hard into John’s shoulders. A slow, amused smile was spreading across his face. “John, you’ve given me an erection!”
Fawnlock held tight to his little stick of vine and the slab as he disappeared back into the bushed, these ones to the side of the camp. John made a quick decision and followed.
“Great,” Moran said softly. He stood up and unlocked the door, leaving it open as he stepped back to lean against his desk. Jim sat back with a little teasing smile on his face, and Sebastian cocked his head in the direction of the sofa. “He gets cranky without his afternoon bowl. I knew I should never have introduced him to it, but what can I say? I’m a fantastic friend. Now, piss off. You’ll know when I need you. Take some cash from the till to get you home, and it’ll be done by this evening.”
John waited until she’d left to cough a few more times, another spot or two of blood staining his tongue. “What’re they gonna do? They gonna put me under?”
“I shouldn’t really tell you anything else. Try and go back to sleep. Put your cup just outside when you’re done.” John could hear the command in that voice, and he didn’t say anything else.
John locked the phone and slid it back into Sherlock’s pocket, sick of Harry’s damp wetting his newfound high. He rolled onto his side to face his bed partner and lifted their joined hands to his face, holding Sherlock’s fingers to his cheek in an affectionate embrace. He heard the phone vibrate in his pocket, but ignored it, closing his eyes in wait of Sherlock’s proper waking up. A few minutes later, Sherlock’s thumb started moving against his jaw, stroking gently, and his phone went off again.
He watched as Sherlock lifted his hand to his mouth and kissed his knuckles. “You’re my best friend, too. I want you around for as long as you want to be around.”
Dark ones over his shoulders, that looked like little suns with the triangles pointing outwards from them, a few bands down his forearms. Dark ones over his fingers with a spot over each knuckle, dark ones over his feet and ankles that faded back into light tawny halfway up his calves. John traced two fingers over the transition and realised it was skin, just a bit fuzzier. It was soft. He had to resist the urge to start stroking whatever this thing was.
John wasn’t sure how long they spent like that, curled together in a warm embrace against the biting chill of the air, but he was certainly brought back to awareness by an odd heat over his head. It was… It was breath, he realised, but that wasn’t all. He felt Fawnlock’s breath over him all the time. There was a pressure over his head with this, like Fawnlock was—
John took a very deliberate breath, nodding awkwardly. “Yes,” he whispered. Sherlock could hear that he’d been intending to speak aloud but hadn’t quite managed it. He tried again, a bit more confidently this time. “God, yes.”
Finally, she found the right corridor, two floors below her first indications. She could see the room with its blue “27” just across from the nurses’ station, and with a gently whined cry of relief, marched on over – only to have her arm caught by security when she got within six foot of the door.
“Yeah,” John said firmly. His nod was slow and uncertain, but his hand was sure in its movement to stroke Sherlock’s chest. “My best friend. You saved me.”
point,” he muttered proudly, but his eyes were focused on the blanket he was fiddling with. He cleared his throat again. “He told me I wasn’t smart enough, and that it would be silly of people to put their lives in my hands.” Could they really blame him for putting it mildly, here? “He started…”
He put one of the looped chains aside and started eagerly harvesting for another. John had a feeling he’d be there for a while. He sat down.
“No chance of bail?” John dropped his head into his free hand. “It’s because I live so far away, isn’t it?”
John was almost certain a little bit of pee came out when this Sebastian Moran pulled out a keyring with two little keys on it. The man held it up between thumb and index finger and jingled them gently. He had a disturbingly proud smile on his face, but all John could do as he kept talking was stare.
“That’s the sweetest thing someone’s done for me,” he said quietly, his voice rough. “Sweetest ever. You’re very nice.”
John’s eyes opened wide. He turned to look at the faun, still staring at him intently. It looked a little worried. John’s gut twisted as he thought that maybe it was worried about him.
“God,” John breathed as he came back down. He’d changed his jumper for a cardigan that would better fit under his coat. “Nothing with you can ever be normal, can it? We can’t just go out for dinner.”
. Shit, he had to stop thinking like that, or he’d probably have another panic attack that would only make things worse. He had to think of something sensible to do. He needed a lawyer. That was what he needed. Where the hell would he get a lawyer? Who would believe his story?
“No. Be straight with me. I’m not in the mood today. Is that your real name?” John spoke in a very measured way, trying to keep calm and not kick this man between the legs.
“Just tell me,” John snapped. He dug his fingernails into his palms in an attempt to remain calm, because his shoulder really couldn’t take another squeeze that hard.
“Get out before they don’t let you come back,” he said instead, shooting her a fierce scowl. “I’ll call you.”
Sherlock didn’t need telling twice. He pulled out slightly and then thrust back in harder, forcing as kindly as he could the next few inches of his cock deep inside John with a deep groan. “Oh, John,” he whined. He couldn’t quite stop himself from rocking again, feeling the tight heat squeeze his cock in all the right places, and eventually John stopped grunting out of discomfort and started grunting out of pleasure. Sherlock recognised that it was around the time he dipped his groin down a bit, angled his cock up towards the place he’d found John’s prostate.
“Oh, I am,” Moran replied keenly and with a careless shrug. He opened his door. “Aren’t I allowed a bit of fun? I did just rescue you from a murder charge.”
He stopped short as he approached the cottage. Lights were flashing. Why were the lights flashing? He put his bags down and crept up to the windows. The light stayed on. He swallowed where he was crouched and sat up a little, trying to see inside. He could hear things, now, things shuffling. No smashes or struggles. Light footsteps on the creaking floorboard that he knew to avoid in the hallway.
“But why?” Harry pressed. She knew John wouldn’t be happy with what she was about to say, but these were the facts, and he had to accept them. “I just can’t figure out what answer you were looking for that he hadn’t already given you. Our dad’s a sorry drunk who’s never gotten over the fact that bad things happen in life. It’s as simple as that.”
The faun looked at John like he was about to projectile vomit all over his hands. John groaned. He patted his chest firmly.
“Oh,” Sherlock said uncomfortably, cheeks tinting pink. John bit his lips to contain the awed grin. “I see.” He pouted, made some strange kissing noises as he thought, and then turned back to John. “John.”
Eventually, Sherlock had to pull back. John was going like he could go on forever (the expression on his face certainly said he missed having Sherlock so close) but he wasn’t so patient. He wanted John. He wanted to show him that this day didn’t have to be a depressing one, filled with sad memories and mourning. He wanted to show him that there was more to celebrate than all the friends he’d lost. It had to be today so he could remember it as today.
John tried to swallow, but what felt like a large majority of his saliva ended up down the wrong hole and he ended up choking instead. Sebastian chuckled again at the reaction, still tossing his playthings from hand to hand. Once John felt a bit better, he held his hands out.
“Then what… Tell me. We don’t have much time.” Sebastian crossed his arms and stood up, staring down at John with an impatient frown on his face. In the light from the window, John noticed the scar running down his face as it shone white against his tanned cheeks. It struck him odd that he hadn’t noticed it before. Maybe he’d used makeup.
“I,” Sherlock hesitated, but nothing that made any sort of sense seemed to want to follow the word out. He shut his trap immediately and nodded instead, uncertain.
“Alright,” Harry murmured. She put a hand on John’s shoulder, and, with a sigh, rubbed his arm fondly. “I won’t badger you.”
“I guess we could count this as a learning experience,” he said, trying to lighten the mood as he wiped his cheeks with his cast left hand. “Beat me half to death and I’m one-hundred percent guaranteed to change my mind about something. Keep that in mind for the future, hm?”
“Come,” he said softly, stroking the back of John’s head once again before he stood up. He kept hold of John with his other hand, pulling him up and gently tugging him along behind as he made his way to his bedroom.
The call cut off. Sherlock whimpered and put his phone in his pocket before working the window open.
John growled to himself and picked up the paper, chucking it as hard as he could back at Moran’s head. His aim was perfect, but Sebastian had seen that reaction coming and had ducked out of the way, still laughing mockingly.
John had to stop himself from laughing out loud when as soon as they hit Hackney, a bunch of teenagers got off the bus. Sherlock seemed certain of following them, and once the first knife was pulled on the pair of them and that first sting of adrenaline shot straight from the centre of John’s chest, he had to admit that, yes, this was the best date Sherlock could ever have taken him on.
John felt almost as if he was seeing the room for the first time. It was dark outside, but Sherlock didn’t put the main light on. Instead he held John’s hand over the bed until he took the hint and sat down, and then he put on one of the bedside lamps. It was nice, this lighting. Soft. All the sharp edges and dead animals looked much less threatening with the warm yellow light curving their edges and bringing life to their colours.
Well, that was strange, but John didn’t have any space left in his brain to think anything more about it, because only a madman would try and create a business partner from a wolf.
After that, the kissing got slower again. John settled over Sherlock, his erection getting heavy in his pants, and lined their crotches up. He thrust slowly against the groin beneath his own, savouring every spark of friction and every burst of heat he got. Just as he started to relax into the steady rhythm, Sherlock slid his hands down and over his hips. His fingers stroked and teased at the elastic of his underwear until, finally, he pushed it down and used a foot to hook it over John’s heels. John’s face blushed a very pretty shade of pink once the pants were gone, and Sherlock once again took control to roll them back over and pull his own boxers down.
“Sh-shit,” John ground out, not quite fully in control of his mouth, as he tried to hide behind Sherlock. “God, p-please, no. Please. Please.”
“Where’s my dad?” John gasped. His voice was still muffled by Sherlock’s clothes. “My sister. Please.”
With John it had been different. There’d been an instant connection there, he’d felt it. John was funny. He was brave. He cared about him. That was friendship too, right? But, of course, he lived with John, and he worked with John. They were best friends. He’d reasoned that friendship felt different depending on what type of friendship it was. He and Lestrade were friends (sort of) so that was a strong feeling right in his stomach. Something trustworthy and even, if he concentrated, pleasant. He and John were best friends, so that was an ache in his chest. It was uncomfortable a lot of the time but that meant he knew they were close. He could live with it.
“Alright, enough of that. This is a hospital, and there are patients here. Calm down, please, or I’m taking you in. D’you hear me?”
“I just think,” Harry continued, “that you’re an idiot if you think our father’s homophobically-charged gaydar isn’t going to pick up on this new whatever-it-is between you two.”
It was long, upsetting, and tiring. They talked for an hour about John’s situation (not in any specific detail, but about his life as a whole) and his schoolwork – which, in itself, had been a jungle.
John started to look less amused. He took Sherlock’s hands gently. “Sherlock,” he said, trying to coax him back into the real world, “it’s alright. I’m sorry, I… It was an accident. We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, okay?”
Sherlock nodded. He crossed his legs slightly and reached down to adjust his trousers. John had to look away.
“It’s Remembrance Day,” Sherlock said after a long bout of comfortable silence. His tea was half gone but John hadn’t seen him move once.
,” John demonstrated, pulling his lips as far apart as they’d go so it could see his tongue. He started as it dropped to its knees and crawled right up to him, levelling its eyes with his mouth. John felt his heart hammer in his chest, not even noticing the horn about to poke his eye out. “
Sherlock’s warm fingers combed between his immediately. “Probably making some other security guard’s life hell. Would you like me to go and find her?”
It seemed the word wouldn’t quite come out. Luckily, John was on hand to help. “You meant like an anniversary.”
“Alright,” he said, resigned. He took another step back so he was out in the hall. “Alright, calm. I’ll be… Um, I’ll be here. Right here, okay?”
In reality, Sherlock wasn’t sure, but he had a bit of an idea. “They’ve sent her away. It’s gotten a bit late, so she’ll probably be back in the morning. Here, put this on, and get some rest. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
“Marylebone High Street,” John said once they were out on the street again. Sherlock instantly took off to the right and hailed a cab. “Number 42, if that’s any help.”
He laughed excitedly and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck, using his firm cast to tug him down and into another kiss.
John ate all of it. Well, they finished the three containers between them, somehow. Sherlock had half of one, Harry had a whole, and John had his whole one, too – plus the second half of Sherlock’s.
“Look, John, I understand that you’re upset, frustrated, and confused, but you need to give me a real picture of how you’re feeling.” Adam handed him a red pen so he could go over the black choices with the correct answers.
“No, tell me,” Sherlock protested, taking the picture and looking at it again. He was in uniform trousers and a beige t-shirt, the bathplug chain of dogtags visible around his neck and under his shirt. “Where did you get this?”
John stood up again, with much less pleasant intentions this time, and was dragged back down by an even harder grip and a louder growl. The claws stayed digging into his shoulder wound this time, but he didn’t feel them.
, John, but all he got from Sherlock was a grunt of acknowledgement. He watched him to make sure he’d heard correctly, and Sherlock did indeed put down the stack of plates he was holding and slink off to his room. John raised his eyebrows, sat back, and took a sip of his tea to keep himself grounded. If this was the only day of the year he was going to get even slightly tip-toed around by Sherlock Holmes, he was bloody well going to enjoy it.
Sebastian continued to stare at John, but now his face was blank except for the faint glare in the furrow of his eyebrows. John didn’t even look at ‘Jim’. He didn’t think his stomach would be able to take any more twists.
“Nice to me is nice enough,” he decided. At a loss as to what to say next, he turned to the only thing on his mind. “Were you see my chest? And it bruised?”
“I’m upside down, I don’t bloody know! Usually I have men the other way when I do that sort of thing.” John blushed the most Sherlock had ever seen him blush, and he couldn’t help but laugh.
John thought for a moment, and then tapped ‘j-o-h-n’ into the phone and watched the screen give way. He smiled at Sherlock, but another line of drool was already making its way onto the pillow. Well, he supposed it was good that he’d gone back to sleep. John put Harry’s number into the phone and sent her a clumsy text, the mask abandoned under his chin.
Oh, hell. Sherlock supposed he should have known he’d be hearing of it again. “It wasn’t unpleasant,” he admitted, working to keep the flush from his cheeks, “and you didn’t seem upset by it.”
This brought along with it the realisation of possibly the worst thing about his situation: he’d probably never get to see Fawnlock again. He’d wished for excitement, but this was too much. He’d had enough now; he wanted the peace back. His fire had gotten too big. He’d preferred it when it was just a scrap of kindling, when he was merely nursing an old flame back to life.
A quick check of his hand suggested that his tremor was still present, but who the hell cared when he could bloody
in the car, yeah, that. And I… I wanted on a CD but I couldn’t find it. And we were stopped in traffic and she leaned over to find it for me in the… ‘partment… the, um…”
John was led over to a plain black car. It was inconspicuous, even with the tinted windows, but it was the only black car in the car park and he just knew it had some sort of tracker or gun storage unit or other such technologies concealed in it somewhere. Nevertheless, the threat of getting shot hung at the forefront of his mind and he forced himself to slide into the backseat. When he looked out of the window, the car park was full. Seriously, where had everyone gone? Who the hell was this Sebastian Moran that he had the power to do that sort of thing?
Upon reflection, he had no idea how they’d dealt with him at all. He’d been panicking badly, not thinking or seeing clearly, but he knew he’d been awake. He remembered blurs of sound and colour and faces, but nothing clearly, that was all. He very distinctly remembered a plate of food being placed in front of him, and he downed it all in two minutes and then threw it back up all over the bed. An hour and a drink of water later, he had another, slower try at a different tray. This one stayed down, and his headache started to disappear.
“I know,” Sherlock said, stroking a hand through his sticky hair. “But you’ll be okay soon. We’re going to get you some help.”
“Okay,” he said, relaxing slightly. John slid his hands down Sherlock’s wrists to lock their fingers together, and it was automatic, almost subconscious, for him to recognise the hard bob of his Adam’s apple and the faint lick of the inside of his lip. He wanted to try it, too.
Sherlock didn’t want to, not really, but he had to. The last time he’d come it had been in his sleep three weeks ago, and he didn’t remember a thing about it. Today John was with him, encouraging him, telling him to do it, and he couldn’t not. He rocked hard against John’s crotch and shuddered, groaning as he felt his cock twitch in its confines of stupid underwear and stupid trousers. He rocked a few more times, squeezing all he could, and then finished, panting, sprawled with limbs going every which way over John.
because of alcohol poisoning, thanks – and yet still, when faced with this situation, found she had no idea where to even start looking for her little brother in this cold, dense maze of a hospital. The boy at the desk had told her, “Twenty-seven,” and then pointed off down a corridor labelled “Rooms 101-110”. She’d followed his finger for lack of other instruction, and then used the signs to help with the rest.
I don't think there are words to describe my feelings about how late this chapter is. Let's not speak of it. Merry Christmas to all!
“You going to pick me up in a tux and then tell me how scary my dad is over a curry?” John continued, gaze roaming Sherlock’s face in amusement as it pinched. “Alright, alright, I’m sorry. Sorry.” He kissed him again. “I was only joking.”
“How so?” he asked accusingly. “What did I do? Erections aren’t bad, Sherlock. They’re the complete opposite of bad. Most men strive for erections at every opportunity.”
“Hush, relax, it’s okay,” John cooed, sitting forwards. “Hungry. I need food. Stay here. Please, stay here.”
Sherlock swallowed. “I will, for today. But I have to go to school tomorrow. Mycroft is taking me, I can’t get out of it. I’ll be over as soon as I can.”
The stranger boy stayed propping John up as they hobbled inside together, Harry closing the door not-so-gently behind them. She left her coat and bag on the floor and turned around to find John tucked safely under the few blankets he had, and the stranger sat on the bed, legs swinging.
“You’ve been through a traumatic experience and been suffering physical and emotional abuse for years. It’s understandable you’d be anxious,” Sherlock said, waving a hand. He sat back down.
John just shook his head. “No, don’t. There’s nothing wrong with your face. Your face is the very opposite of wrong, alright?”
frantic. Nobody had ever knocked on that door before. Nobody that wasn’t the postman, and it was far too late for that now.
The words took John completely by surprise. He’d known what they would be, he always had, but he hadn’t expected his dad to still mean them with so much violence. He’d expected defeat, maybe, or exhaustion, but they were spoken with as much grief and anger as he’d had the first time John had felt his hands on his face.
Sherlock looked very flustered. He shuffled awkwardly for a moment, wishing he still had his coat on so he could sink down into it. “I… I assume you want to keep this exclusive, too,” he murmured, unbuttoning and doing again the buttons on his suit jacket. “Not exclusive, I mean. Wrong word, perhaps. I meant… Quiet. Keep it between us.”
The program ended and a rerun of an old sitcom came on instead. John decided he could stand it with Fawnlock still at his ministrations.
John’s hand stroked down a fuzzy arm. When he took it back, a pink tinge to his cheeks, the faun shuffled closer until his arm brushed his hand again. John took the invitation gladly and stroked him again. A quick glance to his face said the faun was very happy with this; he looked like a pampered cat. John’s gut twisted again as he thought about how long this creature could have been alone for.
Police station, ambulance… Oh, of course. Murder. Jesus, this was messed up. He closed his eyes again until he felt less nauseous and then sat up straight with a little nod. In response, the paramedic helped him up and into the back of the ambulance, officer trapped by his side.
“At the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month the guns fell silent on the Western Front, to bring an end the First World War…”
After a few minutes of the slow, comfortable rhythm they’d set up between them, John’s hand fell from where they’d been clutching Sherlock’s back and dipped between them. Sherlock wondered for moment what he was doing, but John’s expression told him everything in the way the crease between his eyebrows softened slightly and he moaned again. And how he could feel him clenching around his cock. And, of course, the way his arm kept moving. Sherlock’s cock was fucking him slowly and deeply and John was… John was wanking.
“No,” John said firmly, his shock turning into firm defiance. “Absolutely not. I make my own decisions, Sherlock, I’m a big boy. I can handle myself and I know I want to be with you.”
“Well, then… call someone. There’s nowhere for you to stay here. Call Clara – does she still live close?”
“That’s it, Johnny,” Seb smirked, catching his eye in the mirror. “We’re going all the way across London. Might be smart to rest your eyes, because if I’m being honest… You look like you haven’t slept in weeks.”
again? He spent the rest of his tidying session shamelessly dancing around to an old Spice Girls CD of his sister’s, just because he could.
It took a bit more discussion, but the nurse eventually left with a promise to seek out a doctor. As soon as she was gone, John pulled the mask down from his mouth again.
All the way there, he was explaining the situation, getting increasingly agitated and nervous about John’s state of consciousness. His eyes were open and occasionally blinking, but he didn’t seem to be taking anything in.
“I didn’t say it had to be expensive,” Sherlock said, frowning. What a ridiculous assumption. “I simply like to eat in places that don’t make me look overdressed.”
“That’s… That’s actually the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard.” John stroked Sherlock’s chest gently before dragging him in for a tight hug – which Sherlock, startled, eventually managed to figure out how to reciprocate.
Sherlock thought for a second. Was he feeling any of those things? “What about a fluttering sensation?” he said, cringing. He really couldn’t think of any better words for it, but he hadn’t meant for it to sound so pathetic.
“I-it’s the most sensible solution,” John said quickly. “He lives closer to school, and he’s in a lot of my classes. He can, you know, get me the work.” He cleared his throat, wondering how on Earth he’d managed to be this close to Sherlock for this long and not pick up on how to talk like a normal human being.
“Besides,” John continued, “I’d rather that than this.” He couldn’t have stopped the words coming out as he gestured down at his battered body. “Honestly, Harry, getting
After a few more minutes John was silent again, much more contained, but Sherlock stayed squeezing him. He couldn’t let go.
He’d managed to dream up his own little world to live in while he went crazy. Well, nobody could say that insanity hadn’t been kind to him, could they?
“Well, your part of the date has been spectacularly boring so far,” Sherlock sighed, leaning back in his seat.
The silence crept back between them. John wasn’t sure whether to be thankful or not; he was pleased at not having Sherlock’s sympathy, because although he’d been a veteran himself, he, personally, felt like it was stealing thunder to make the day about the present. It was a day to respect and honour the past. His own past wasn’t a part of it.
The largest of the two small ones slammed a punch to John’s gut and he groaned loudly, dropping his chin to his chest.
of this Richard Brook man, how could he have killed him? He lived in the middle of bloody nowhere, for God’s sake. It took all of his willpower not to panic and start struggling, but the realistic part of him knew that thrashing when one had been arrested for murder was not the most sensible course of action.
John shook his head and whined gently, but Sherlock could feel his guard cracking. His eyes were open and they were beginning to shine.
John snorted. He hadn’t even considered that. He sighed and wiped his eyes again. “Finally handing myself to you on a silver platter and you still don’t want me,” he mused. Then he tried to pull himself up straight and take a deep breath. “I need to go. I’m so sorry about… everything.” He felt his heart twist. Would he ever get to speak to his dad again? It shouldn’t have bothered him, but it did. “I love you.”
“Uh,” John grunted, finding it hard to think as Sherlock moved to his neck. “Oh, God… I don’t know.”
“I’m going to see Dad soon,” he said quietly, staring at the ceiling. He hoped neither of them would see that he already pretty much had. “If there’s anything important you want me to tell him, you should write it down.”
John went still immediately. His eyes glinted in the light, moisture gathering, and Sherlock’s heart sank in his chest at the realisation that he may have said something John didn’t appreciate. The fingers tightened around his chin, squashing his lips together again, as John spoke.
Harry nodded. “I’ll do it later. What about you, though. You won’t be here much longer. What are they doing with you?”
“Nope,” came the answer as Sherlock pulled on his gloves. “We’re going to turn up in Hackney and walk around until we find something.”
“You don’t think I’m just going to milk you for a few bob and let you go on your way, do you?” Sebastian almost laughed at the idea. “No, I’m planning on using you. Every last bit of you. If you agree, I’ll even wipe your police record for you. I already stopped their property search so they wouldn’t find your gun. My little treat. What do you say, hm? A favour for a favour.”
He was tired of having routines. He’d never been a man for routines, even if the army had forced him to deal with them for his training. Once he’d been put in the field he lost all patience for them because he genuinely had never had one. He’d worked in tents, abandoned warehouses, on helicopters, in the firing line; those were the days. Those days where every day was something new.
John’s eyes filled again, but this time, he was smiling. He slid his cast hand into Sherlock’s under the covers – it wasn’t like he could use it to text, anyway.
John understand? He’d had friends his whole life. John’s natural state when faced with strangers and dangers was ‘friend’. Sherlock had been isolated as a child – willingly, he freely admitted, but isolated nonetheless. The few times he’d tried reaching out his hand had returned cold and bloodied, for the most part. He’d genuinely had no idea what friendship felt like before John. He’d gotten a taste of it with Lestrade, of course, but nobody ever had to know that.
John opened his eyes when the door swung closed, and was shocked to find Sherlock right beside him in the bed again. “When did you…” he trailed off, shaking his head. A sudden urge rose, hot and fierce, in his chest. How easy would it have been for him to pucker his lips and kiss his best friend, right then and there? He blinked. Clearly his body remembered more about the night before than he did.
He blindly put out a hand and patted around the coffee table until he managed to find his mug. His tea was just reaching the unpleasant side of lukewarm, so he drank down the last third in three big gulps and returned it to the table. John would, hopefully, see the empty mug and offer him a refill. He usually did, anyway.
, and a dirty one at that. “You’re a liar, John, and my friend and I don’t like people who try and lie to us.”
The more he tried to steer his thoughts from the worst case scenarios, the more his thoughts just went in a full circle, always right back to Fawnlock. John supposed (hoped) that he was just as scared for John, but that he was at least planning on staying the night. He deserved somewhere to stay, John thought.
the man had said, and John had thanked him in as shaky a manner as he could and leaned into Sherlock as they walked away. Of course, they didn’t go home.
Moran put his feet down, and John could see him staving off either an ‘I knew it’ or an ‘Excellent’. He couldn’t tell which.
There was silence, and then Sebastian puffed out a snort of laughter. “Come on, tell me.” A beat. “Alright, I’ll work it out. Oh, don’t look like that, I’m just as smart as you. Don’t even think about it.”
John couldn’t help but smile to himself on his way into the shower. It had turned into a full on grin by the time he rinsed his hair, and he was almost laughing to himself when he peeked into the living room one last time before going to bed. It hadn’t moved, and John stayed for a few minutes to check it was still breathing. John climbed into bed and smiled at the ceiling for a while, too excited to fall asleep. It was still raining outside, but he didn’t mind. For once, he was thankful for the rain.
He took John’s coat and hung it on the back of the door with his own. Not surprisingly, John’s first stop was the kettle.
Sherlock hummed dubiously but kept his next comments to himself. Nobody else on the whole planet seemed to realise the magnitude of how much the newspapers really got wrong or, sometimes, just plain lied about. It was endlessly frustrating but he’d given up having this argument with John a long while ago. After finishing off his reading he flicked through the rest of the articles with disinterest (falling in love with a man twice her age, inspirational story on how she overcame domestic abuse, competition for a free holiday in Prague) and tossed the magazine over his head. He laced his fingers together behind his head and closed his eyes, a deep sigh blown over his chest. He’d been up for hours now, and although he wasn’t tired he always appreciated time to rest his eyes – and wait for tea.
“Yes, I do,” John muttered as he tried not to think about how close Sherlock’s head was to his groin, “and I know it’s true, which is exactly why I’m having second thoughts.”
He took his cane just in case, and found a camera already tucked into his coat pocket. When he set out, it was a beautiful day. Not warm, but bright. The wind was still bitterly cold but the storm had given way to a beautiful blue sky, and he decided to take a picture. He was no photographer but he didn’t get many breathtakingly beautiful opportunities like this. He took just one, of the green treetops in the distance under that stunning blue sky.
“Watson.” John’s head perked at his name. A different officer appeared in the doorway, this one with grey hair and a friendly face. John wished he didn’t look so nice. Maybe then his situation would have been easier to handle. “Your court hearing is coming up this afternoon. Anyone you’d like to call? Lawyer, family?”
“Broken wrist,” Sherlock began, staring down at his reddened hands. “Trauma to the head. I suspect a damaged ankle and several damaged ribs, too, from the way he was groaning as he was moved, but I’m no doctor.”
It seemed far too smart not to notice the door open, or at least the draught coming from it. This creature must have stayed by choice. John reckoned it was curious.
When his little home was finally back in view, he felt on the verge of collapsing with exhaustion, and he still needed to put the dinner on. He groaned as he felt his leg twinge.
Harriet Watson had no idea what she was doing. At nineteen years old, she was in the last six months of her gap year, now, before her first year of university started. She’d spent the entire year drinking with her friends, been hospitalised twice – but only
“Oh,” John said awkwardly, pulling his hand away from the grip that was still covering it. Despite his flustered state, his smile was genuine. “That’s… really good. Thank you.”
“John Watson,” the man said with a smile. John nodded and he let himself in. “I’m Adam. Resident child psychologist. Pleased to meet you. I should say, before we go any further, that this was meant to be a private consultation.” He pointed at Sherlock.
Their banter continued in the steadily darkening afternoon light, and soon they’d been walking for fifteen minutes. John glanced up at Sherlock.
John shook his head, trying his best to keep track of Sherlock and not spiral into a panic attack. “F-fuck.”
John got up on all fours and moved until he was lying face-to-face with Sherlock. He smiled slightly and then moved forward, landing a sweet his to his lips.
He sighed and stepped back over to Fawnlock, patting his arm and smiling sweetly. “Never mind. Nothing. Come on, let’s go back. Show me your place. Your home.” John gestured back towards the shelter.
He took a deep breath as he stared down at his watch: he hadn’t actually been to a Remembrance Day service since he’d gotten home. It was one of his most shameful secrets. To others, perhaps it wouldn’t have come across as disrespectful, but he felt he had an obligation to attend. He simply hadn’t been able to, whether it had been because he hadn’t wanted to go on his own or he’d not even gotten over his own battles. This year, though, he was going, and he was going with Sherlock.
