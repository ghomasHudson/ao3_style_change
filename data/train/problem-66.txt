“Of course.” I moved closer to him, but not enough to feel his presence in the room more than I could handle. James released Silver from his firm grasp, and a sigh—of relief, or exasperation?—fell from him.
“Do not hesitate to regale me with them back at Baker Street, my dear Watson.”
In that moment, I heard a rustling from the secluded staircase, and two shrouded figures in the darkness. I could not catch their faces, but I could spot the hems of two nightgowns—Mary and Miranda. They must have been woken up from the noise. Miranda was too bright to put herself or Mary in the line of potential danger, however, so they stood in the shadow, listening. I was uncertain if they could see me from where I stood, but I gave a brief, inconspicuous nod of affirmation to the both of them.
“Is this the direction to his rooms, Holmes?” I asked in a whisper, leaning toward his ear.
Sherlock knows precisely to what tension Thomas refers, and it grates along his memories the same as the ticking clock does. He weaves his small pipe through his fingers a moment before packing a pinch of tobacco into it. The thin veil of armour it provides is a necessity to move forward.
Holmes looked at me and an unexpected smile appeared on his face, a smile that lit a fire in my blood the way only he could. “Now,” Sherlock Holmes said, “We are going to free Thomas Hamilton.”
“Bristol,” came John Silver’s voice, speaking over whatever other profanity was about to leave James’ mouth. “We left the information in Bristol, with one of our men. It was too dangerous to have in our possession.” A look passed between Silver and James, one that only lasted a second, yet did not go unnoticed by me. I felt some relief. These men had a plan. “You need to go to the Admiral Benbow Inn, in Bristol. There, you will meet a man by the name of Manderly, William Manderly. Billy Bones, he is also known as. He has the coordinates, in a sealed envelope that myself and the Captain entrusted him with before we came here.”
It appeared that James knew both these men well enough to speak to them with a casual air I had only seen him share with Silver up to this point. The pace of the conversation was giving me a feeling of whiplash so I asked the question that seemed most pertinent to me:
After Miranda had reassured herself that James had, indeed, not dropped dead in their dining room, she and Mary wandered off to walk along the hillside in the chilled night air. Both of them seemed rather wired with the knowledge that the remainder of our party lay not far behind us.
“Silver, what in the hell do you think you’re doing?” James spoke as though he knew the man well, and yet was exasperated with his very presence.
“I hope it’s all to your liking, folks!” A young, clean-shaven man with curly black hair beamed at us from his spot near the bar. His smile was bright and welcoming, though, I thought, it did not appear to reach his eyes. He waved his right hand at us, and I wondered why he elected to shout across the tavern rather than speak at an appropriate volume at closer proximity to us. The owner huffed and rolled her eyes but did not seem surprised at this display.
“I am grateful, as always. I shall wire the Earl of Ashbourne first thing in the morning to ask for an extension of the deadline he has set me; I will not go into detail of the circumstances for I do not wish to sow panic however I do feel it is reasonable, considering the careful approach this case needs. Now, do get some rest before tomorrow, we have much to do!”
With that, the four of us made our way to the epicentre of tonight’s festivities. Chairs arranged in a hemisphere around the fireplace within a large, immaculately decorated parlour room. Beside the fire were three chairs facing the others, two of them filled as one waited for the Lady.
“So, James, what is our course of action for the day? You appear to be the sole holder of that information,” I enquired.
After a while, James emerged with a new set of plates, carrying what looked like a far more edible fry-up for three. He had pointedly not made one for Silver. James sat back next to Miranda in the booth before taking nothing more than a cup of black tea for himself.
He hears Thomas stand and approach him carefully near the fireplace. “I do not tell you this to hurt you, or to make you uncomfortable. You ask me for forgiveness that you do not need to seek from me. You ask me for a pardon that I am not entitled to give. All I have done, I have done in the service of love. And so have you. There is nothing shameful in that.”
“Long John Silver,” the regal-looking woman said, looking at him. “Do not tell me I had to once again cross an ocean to save you from the trouble you have caused.”
I blinked; I was quite sure that Silver had noticed us on our doorsteps. Perhaps he thought that we were distracted enough with our own exchange, or perhaps his desperation had crowned to the point that he was heedless of whether anyone saw him. Even from the considerable distance we had between us, I could see in clear view the ease that settled over James’ shoulders as his hands pulled Silver closer by the lapels as if he intended to devour him. I thought of our conversation, of our fear just earlier in this endless evening, and felt my chest warm with happiness for him. Silver, it seemed, was going to be staying, at least for a while.
—recently heard from our powerful client, rang a garrish bell of recognition in my mind. This fascinating woman before me was none other than Lord Thomas Hamilton’s wife, the Lady Holmes and myself were to be investigating for her sordid affair. I dared not to indicate as such with my words, nor my expression, for it could jeopardise Holmes’ work before it had even begun. I could feel uncomfortable warmth creep on the back of my neck, thinking of the letter that the Earl of Ashbourne had shown us—it felt distinctly improper to be so familiar with a stranger’s private passion in such a way.
I noticed something in James’ voice then, something familiar that I had not heard in nearly six years. As he spoke of John Silver and their complicated bond, a tenderness coated his words in such a way that I was brought back to a conversation in a darkened parlour of 221B Baker Street. I remembered how he spoke of Thomas, and how he bared his soul to me just days after our first meeting in an effort to save the man he loved. Now, whilst a similar weight of urgency burdened us, I saw that very same devotion in him toward Silver.
“My name is Max for all intents and purposes you may have, Doctor John Hamish Watson,” Max enunciated sweetly, fixing me once again with her gaze. The fact that she knew—and used—my full name was not lost on me for the threat that it was. “I would take less interest in our identities if I were you.”
“Sherlock…” John stared ahead. “What is this?”
They both raced toward the gate, halfway opposite the way the intruders were dragging Henry to what they could barely make out as a black sedan with the headlights off. Unless Henry could break free, they’d never make it in time.
John is having a pretty hard time, Sherlock is mostly frustrated and confused.
Sherlock shot a glare at him, then back at Faas. “Go.”
Once fully on the cliff, John swung out again, at the gulls, catching one of them pretty square in the chest. It screeched and flew off, the others following.
Releasing him out in the hall and blocking reentry, John looked at Leo and tried to fathom how he could be that similar in looks and yet so entirely different in personality.
“Well, we
. It caused no end to his frustration. The Doctor was causing more issues than Mycroft had anticipated.
“You can. But I can get it off in at least half the time.”
“No.” Sherlock replied dryly.
More confused than ever, Sherlock stood apprehensively. “John?” He stood and grabbed his coat.
“Ya can’t just shout at him, he dunno what ya want.” Faas spoke to John’s handlers first, then used their confusion to address John directly. “Half-shift, mate. They want you ta only shift part-way. As a Warrah, you’ll look like a traditional werewolf.”
AliaArik beta'd again or this wouldn't be here, so go thank them and send them nice things.
Moran finished clapping with a last resolute smack… and took the mic out. He turned in one motion, his back to them, and addressed the audience.
“I do not. But I cannot back that opinion with fact. I did not interact with him.” Swivelling to look at John with a critical eye, Sherlock wore a stoic face to ask the same thing. “Do you?”
“You’re very ignorant for someone so well read.” Sherlock commented. “Did you not know anyone as a person first, and a Shifter later?”
Sherlock grabbed the arm holding him, tempted to twist it off him. He just held it for now.
He was led up some stairs that smelled heavily of polish, enough to make John’s eyes water, and the chains around his legs and wrists were circled through with another length, then locked into a bolt on the floor similar to the one he’d seen minutes before. He looked up to see a deep crimson curtain, huge and thick material that muted the goings on opposite them, and realised they were in a theatre. Because of course they were. What a cliched, stupid image of a black market was this…
Neither door opened until an hour and a half later, when Mrs Hudson was calling them to come eat.
Bristling with irritated energy, he tapped his fingers on the arm of the wheelchair where he sat, waiting for his cab. He’d never have put up with this nonsense, except there was Mrs Hudson, hand on his shoulder. He’d finally made Mycroft relent, but he’d only agreed to give Sherlock the go-ahead to leave if his landlady came and gave her approval, and saw him off. Sherlock mused it was because he was supposed to have some reaction, as if seeing her would remind him not to be overly reckless. As if that were ever the case. Nonetheless, he’d made the agreement to not remove the cast on his own. With his coat on and if he held himself a certain way, most people wouldn’t notice either way.
“Yeah…” John stopped himself asking the obvious next question; why. Instead he put his shades back on. “Oh.” He clapped his hands and looked at Sherlock, who had put his shades on too at some point. “The butler, when he came back, had something with him. Looked like a scarecrow.”
Arriving at his bedroom door, John knocked, was bid in, and entered. Bluebell was a rabbit currently, which made a visual assessment more difficult. “Any change?”
The worst part of any of it was how amusing it was to apparently everyone else. Including, somehow, both Mike and Lestrade. The former had come over at the behest of Harry Watson, to be sure her ‘brother with a death wish’ was actually in once piece. He still hadn’t returned her calls or texts, which he explained to Mike was her being overprotective of her new adopted daughter while he assured him Estrelle was as fine as he was. He’d have to take John on his word at that, because Strel didn’t seem at all fond of Mike. She hissed at him and hid behind Sherlock, holding his hand in both of hers. When Sherlock had looked over to John for help, both the other men just laughed.
“That’s Sherlock?” Strel asked, a little too loudly.
Update!
Sherlock thinned his lips, but didn’t disagree. He shut his eyes, and Bluebell sat quietly for a few minutes.
John caught the flicker of white sailing over the rail into another enclosure. This might actually work. Moriarty was clever enough to not have cameras, which can
The music swells as the climax is delivered.
Kneeling just inside the circle without touching any of it, she put a finger to the red paint and scratched a little off with her finger. Underneath was a line in black. “Mmhm.”
“Come on.” John commanded, getting into the cab and shutting the door. Sherlock downed the rest of his beverage and handed the lid back.
Frantic, uncomposed… desperate. He was in John’s lap, grasping weakly. He was coming undone. He…
John had already talked his way out of two stops from other servants, and he was beginning to get nervous. Though he’d gotten away without arousing suspicion, he doubted that would work with the regular staff. He’d only met people hired for the event, who had assumed he was part of the household and didn’t give him much trouble. If Steward found him, he doubted his mask would protect him. Especially if the bogle was still with him.
Sherlock complied quietly, his curious gaze flicking over John. “What?”
Stay safe out there folks, and thanks for reading!
Sherlock walked past him and disappeared into the kitchen. “No. They didn't see me use it, not even John did.”
John stared for a bit, heat rising up his collar. “Out.” Sherlock let his head tilt slightly. “Out, I need a shower, that’s why I came in here.”
After a particularly rough pothole (is that what you called a divot in a country road?) that rattled the satchel John kept safe on his lap, he opened the flap and peeked in to check his cargo was safe. A dull green glow illuminated his face, as if he were a teenager telling campfire stories.
“No.”
Planning out the second part of this, I have a solid plot (that was originally going to be part of this one) and some bouncing ideas, so that's happening.
“Don’t mind him, Greg, he’s just annoyed his body heals at a normal human rate.”
“Pot of coffee, thanks. Yes, sugar and cream. Guet, merci.”
Looking down in surprise to see Sherlock had finished (an excellent job, needlessly symmetrical even) and was holding up his baggy old trousers, John swallowed.
John gave the woman at the desk an apologetic nod and followed.
“Good. Then-”
Sherlock had grabbed his coat and wallet. “Running some errands. Come outside when you’re done, I shouldn’t be long.”
“I do.”
“But of course a Sleigh Beggy would bring out all sorts. Likely why so many lots were included this time.”
The lighthouse, a bright orange wooden structure made mostly of driftwood by knowledgeable men of the craft, could be seen far off. There were no trees to speak of, nor anything else around to block off the view of it. At the base of it stood a figure, and Sherlock also noticed the flicker of someone sucking on a cigarette on the balcony above. Both walked around the building and out of sight, though it was before John could know if they’d been seen. Sherlock was certain they had been.
In a posh sort of cell in the back of the theater(, something like a green room), John sat rubbing his temples on the plush bench. He’d been given a set of clothes (his own clothes, which though were comfortable and familiar, gave him a very off-putting feeling of being violated. Where had they come from??) and a shaving kit, then left and allowed to shave, check his wounds, even have a hot shower. The cell, though barred locked and sealed magically, was otherwise like a hotel room. It all felt surreal.
They were sat on the moss, facing east as they’d been told, looking up at the brilliant night sky. Alone. The noises of birds and insects and other ‘normal’ things were an undertone, of course, but there weren’t any Neighbors. It had been about an hour since the sun went down. John had paced after a time, but Sherlock insisted it wouldn’t do any good unless he was faced east. So with a humph, he’d sat down beside Sherlock and followed his gaze upwards.
Da da DAAAAAAA!
Molly fans: Will Sherlock ever forgive her?
Enjoy!
Goodbye, my friends. It's such a hard thing to say. I hope we will meet again. I will never stop writing. It is a part of me as much as you and these two idiots are. Keep an eye out for me because i'll be back. I pledge to make our boys fall in love again and again with you all by my side. 😂 Until then… Keep you pants dry and your dreams wet and remember, hugs not drugs. We’ll all get through this together.
The dance floor was already packed as John walked into the club. He had expected nothing less for a Friday night, and a late one at that. It was just after eleven o’clock and the club was in full swing. The lights were low and the bass thumped a steady rhythm he could feel in the floor beneath his feet. It had been a long day at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, packed with patients and an emergency surgery right at the end that kept him late again. He had dashed out of the hospital as soon as he was finished and grabbed a cab to a chip shop around the corner from the club for a quick bite. He came straight to the club after that one detour. He had meant to arrive earlier, like nine o’clock earlier. He could only hope the man he was to meet was still here, or had been here at all. Now the pounding music and vibrating floor rippled electric sparks through his body, making him want nothing more than to join the pulsing throng of people on the floor. He had the burning desire to be free and forget everything, but he had to find someone first. The man of the hour.
Darling, so it goes
John pauses. Sherlock meets his gaze and then lets his eyes drop down to John’s lips when the tip of his tongue darts out to wet them. Sherlock swallows hard.
“John, wait,” he prides himself on the fact that his voice sounds steady.
Chapter one of Persistence: Part 2 is up!!
“Of course.”
With the air between them cleared, they enter the house and pay admission. Soon their guide is leading them through a most fascinating tour. Though it is no longer furnished, it is not difficult to imagine what it looked like when Poe lived in it, between their guide’s descriptions and Sherlock’s additions. Not surprisingly, he knows a good many things the guide does not. To her credit, she smiles each time he begins speaking and waits patiently for him to finish. He is courteous as well, not interrupting her canned stories before jumping in. John appreciates it all until he begins to notice how her eyes stray from Sherlock’s face to glide down his body approvingly. Clearly impressed with more than just his knowledge of Poe, she begins flirting with Sherlock in more and more obvious ways as the tour goes on.
“Right about the time I went to uni, he graduated and joined the army. We were in contact all through med school and basic training. We found weekends to meet up here and there. I could tell him anything,” John smiles wistfully, but it fades from his face and Sherlock finds himself dreading John’s next words. “I thought about joining up once I was done with school. Figured they’d be happy to have a ‘brilliant’ army doctor.”
Much love, Jane
“Dr. Watson, if you’ll just listen to reason,” the medic implores, but John will have none of it.
WTF does Mycroft mean by "I will do whatever is necessary to keep harm from coming to [both of] you"?
“I don’t care. Just do it!”
“Burn the heart out of me. That’s what he said at the pool.”
Sherlock goes out on a dangerous case that follows him home.
“John, you’re distracting me.”
Their faces were dangerously close again. John could feel Sherlock’s breath ghosting over his face and he found himself wishing, hoping for the other man to do something. They pulled away to stand side by side, staring into one another’s eyes before moving in different directions to curl their bodies in identical fluid motions. They met again a moment later, back to back and angled in the same direction, their cheeks pressed together. John pushed against the taller man and he leaned into John as they slowly dropped low and raised up again, snapped their heads back and broke apart to dance in their own idioms again.
3) Will John delay telling him anything and, if so, will there be another accident to push John along?
Sherlock counts heads, making sure to see the face of every skater and support staffer before turning to the driver who sits directly in front of his seat.
“‘Course, Rol, of course,” Greg straightened and gave John another look before walking away.
John wakes up.
“Won’t you?” Mycroft queries with a knowing smile on his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
John turns to face him with an expectant look and Sherlock has a sudden flash of unadulterated panic, but he pushes it aside before he shows. At least, he hopes so.
“What impression did you think it would give?” Sherlock’s voice drips with annoyance, his whole body radiating anger.
KYFC can stand for something else?? How about Oh My Fucking God, Jane?!?! WTF are you doing??
“Molly was one of them.”
“You’re amazing,” John uttered with nothing less than awe. That was not quite what he had meant to say. Then again, what had he intended upon saying? John pulled back, biting his bottom lip in embarrassment, unsure of how to explain that one away. Sherlock’s cool eyes looked back at him without a hint of reproach as a deep, melodic voice boomed over the floor.
My god, I cannot believe it's the weekend already. Idk about you, but it has flown by for me. This new normal really is so weird. My husband says it won't change anytime soon. Gah.
“What do people usually say?” John wondered, trying to divert attention from his pink cheeks. Too quickly, but Sherlock made no sign that he had noticed.
John’s eyes open slowly, or more like not open. The lids are heavier than he would expect.They feel like mini lead aprons over his eyes. Like the ones used to cover parts of the body not being x-rayed. The weight of them us troubling. Just how long as he been asleep?
The sex holiday begins!! I don't know about all of you, but I'm excited! Yippee!! Not only are these parts perhaps The most fun to write, they are a lot of fun to edit too. Oh yeah.
“Are you all right?” he asks stupidly, already knowing the answer. He nearly rolls his eyes.
“Yeah, about that. When I first got here I was really abrupt and a little…” he closes his mouth suddenly and stares. “Wait. You’re...you’re glad I came?”
“What can I do about this fuckstick? It’s like I have target on my back,” Harry complains. “How the fuck do I stop her riding my ass?”
“You’ll be front and center this year,” Sherlock smiles back.
4. What was in Molly's note and will John even remember it after all this?
“Take off your shirt.”
“I’m sorry,” he says again, hoping his tone conveys the depth of his feeling. He does not want to lose this friendship. He cannot lose it. He watches Sherlock for any sign of forgiveness and, to his relief, he sees the coach’s grey eyes soften and his annoyance fading.
“Who was it, John?” his tone is soft, but firm. Sherlock has not heard anything quite like it from his own lips before. He wonders silently at this man’s power over him and wishes he had some,
John needs Sherlock to find him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“John? John, wait!” Sherlock calls from the top of the stairs, but John just slams out of the building and hails a cab as he steps quickly toward the street. It takes a moment for a cab to stop. Long enough that the building’s door opens and Sherlock emerges. Not wanting to hear what Sherlock has to say and not wanting to argue about where he’s going, John climbs in the cab and gives the driver quick orders. It starts off just as Sherlock dashes out onto the sidewalk. “John!”
“Maybe, maybe not, under normal circumstances, but you did just now. So, are you going to tell me? Are we going to talk about this or are you going to keep me in the dark? AGAIN.”
John’s eyes drop down his own body and Sherlock’s can’t help but follow.
Aaagghhh! So many questions!
It’s forever
John is captive on The Crown and a gun has been fired.
“Of course not,” Sherlock laughs, finishing with the bandage. “I have a few pieces of equipment here.”
John finds out Sherlock went to Nepal to help Irene.
“I’m glad it wasn’t,” Sherlock whispers reverently.
“Well,” John nods, “I could take you to your flat, if you want.”
“How long have you been up?” John asks in a groggy voice.
“Oh,” she gasps, but the warmth of his hand under hers and on the cool skin under her breast reminds her why she paid this visit in the first place. She narrows her eyes to look at him hungrily. “You can make me feel better, Doctor. With one deep injection.”
“For god sake,” Sherlock mutters. He opens his eyes and looks toward the team, catching Molly’s eye almost immediately. “I’ll be back.”
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for...
The detective and his blogger track down one of Moriarty's goons and Sherlock is nervous after John is shot at.
John leans in again, elbows on the table and hands together in between, his fingers entwined. His face is so open and sincere. Another flip.
Sherlock sneaks back into the hospital.
She puts her hands on her hips, but one is soon on his shoulder. Sherlock stares up at her, weighing her words carefully. He finally dips his chin in a shallow nod.
There is a sliver of hope in the words and hangs in the air between them. Sherlock opens his beautiful mouth to respond as the ringtone they both know to be Greg’s sounds. He had insisted on his own specific tone after Sherlock ignored one too many calls, which was not long after the lanky git was hired. John has caught shit on occasion for not forcing him to pick up.
Dear god, so much we don’t know yet and so much time to learn!
“If he’s so forthright, why has he given not even an inkling of his feelings on the matter?” Sherlock sniffs haughtily to hide his frustration.
Much love always, Jane
“Why not? He isn’t aged.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, no reason. I just.. I’ve never heard of it before,” John replied slowly, trying to gather his thoughts.
Life on the island continues.
“Why?” Mycroft repeats, raising his brows and tilting his head slightly.
2) What will Sherlock dream up during their evening planning session and will it work or fail spectacularly?
I hope you enjoyed this chapter and I hope to get the next one out soon. If nothing else, I'll see you after the holiday. I love you all and thank you for your kindness and support.
“Sherlock, listen. I…” John stops to wrestle with the panic threatening to burst from his chest. “I didn’t love anyone. I have never loved anyone I’ve been in a relationship with. I can’t guarantee it will be any different if we...if we agreed…”
“No, I’m not on speaker,” Sherlock snaps his eyes open, “but for god sake, Greg.”
A goofy grin appears on John’s face. He glances at his own knee where Sherlock’s had just been and a soft look comes over his features. He turns on the couch, folding one leg in front of his body. One arm rests on the back and he cups his own cheek in his hand, but he says nothing.
“But they’re blindsided, Sherlock,” John ventured. “I’m asking and I think it’s fantastic. I do. It’s amazing.”
Upon reaching the Sussex, Sherlock ushers the skaters to the elevators while telling them all to a good night’s sleep. He knows full well none of them will. About half will sneak out and the other will behave as though at a college slumber party. His and John’s only hope is that they not play any pranks on them in the night. Either way, none will get to sleep before 1am and will likely waste the morning sleeping in. Although, John has made an effort to have everyone up by nine for a team breakfast at all the away bouts thus far. To Sherlock’s surprise, the skaters have embraced the idea and most are up to join him.
“Sherlock, you have to be there by nine,” John argues, trying to make him see reason.
Great to see you all and fucking spec-bloody-tacular to be back.
Heck, yeah! To quote my new favorite message, "Sherlock has your number, bitch." (Thank you, Purrfect!) And now John does too! The plot most definitely thickens. And I still maintain that the first section is killer. I nearly cried just writing it. Just watching the scene play out in my mind and Sherlock's pain brilliantly acted by Benedict, and then John's too by Martin. I don't know how the rest of you feel, but it's super easy for me to picture them acting out all of the scenes in this story, which makes them all the more powerful for me. I hope you all have a similar experience.
John resists the urge to snap at him in favor of looking away and straight ahead instead. After a few moments of silence, John sighs and looks down at his feet.
Sherlock sighs again heavily and turns his head to see John sleeping soundly next to him. They were discussing a case and then Moriarty, and must have fallen asleep. He knows it’s foolish, but after the nightmare he just wants to touch John, touch him and make sure he is real and safe. Sherlock reaches for his flatmate and gently touches his hand. It feels warmth and alive. Sherlock slides his fingers to John’s wrist to feel for his pulse. Strong and steady.
“We’re flatmates,” he clarified with an easy shrug and then added after taking in the change in John’s features: “Yes, just flatmates. We keep each other honest.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know,” John responds in mock skepticism. “I’m not so sure about Harry.”
“John is different,” Sherlock mutters, straightening and avoiding eye contact.
I know what you're all thinking, so I'm just going to put it into words for you.
Sherlock watches John in fascination. There is absolutely no sense of superiority or condescension in his tone or manner. If anything, John seems almost dumbfounded by his own intelligence. It is both charming and odd. He is in a position to have become an incredible asshole and yet, he is friendly and unassuming. Sherlock wonders at how John’s parents kept him grounded. They must have been good people indeed.
AHHHH! Omg, we finally made it! They finally got there. Holy fucking shit, Jane! Why did it have to take so long??
“I see the evidence no one else can,” Sherlock answered after a pause. “I make the connections immediately and tell the police what to do next, where to go. I read people.”
John purses his lips and just stops himself from saying what the fuck out loud, spelling his doom. Speaking of which, if he doesn’t get some air fucking now he is fucking dead. As if reading his mind, Greg takes the regulator from his mouth and holds it out to John. He nods at it urgently and pushes it closer. John does not need to be asked twice. He grabs the mask with both hands and shoves it in his mouth, inhaling deeply. Greg motions for him to go slowly and John nods. He breathes twice more as slowly as he can bear and offers it to Greg. He takes it for a few breaths and gives it back to John. As he breathes, Greg motions instructions that John interprets as they will continue swapping the mask until they hit lake bottom. At that point, Greg will cut John loose and they will take turns with the mask on the way up. Confident he understands the plan, John nods. Greg nods back with a tight-lipped smile.
It's not all smooth sailing, but it never is.
“There was no one there to pull him from the water,” Mycroft’s voice is stern. “He drowned.”
“Sherlock?” he sort of half calls. His voice sounds frighteningly loud in the quiet flat. John walks quietly into the room and surveys the area. Finding no one, he walks toward the bed and bathrooms. The hair on his arms and the back of his neck is standing, the sense of foreboding growing with every step he takes. He curses himself silently for leaving his gun up in his room. He stills again just beside the formal loo. He glances ahead to the open door of Sherlock’s bedroom, listening intently for the noise he heard to come again. It’s from the loo and sounds like labored breathing, a bitten-off moan. Tensing his body for a fight, John  takes another step toward the doorway, jerking to a stop when he hears a quiet shuffle.
Suddenly the lights went up and a new song filled the club. Sherlock turned his head toward John and he felt the puff of Sherlock’s hot breath on his neck. A shiver traveled down the length of his spine and he hoped Sherlock had not noticed, but was quite certain he had. To John’s great delight, Sherlock seemed genuinely pleased with what he saw.
“How could you possibly know that?” he shakes his head with a laugh.
“Really, Watson,” he frowns mightily. “He is called Detective Chief Inspector Lestrade. I taught you to respect adults.”
Rosie’s jaw drops and she stares at him silently. She can’t utter a word. She can’t even begin to process what Sherlock has said. He covers her hand with his own.
“You’re bleeding,” Sherlock announces, eyes now roving over John’s body and searching for other signs of injury.
The words of both men are drown out by bustle of paramedics and police rushing into the room. John reluctantly steps back, letting the others take over Sherlock’s care. He watches over him closely, even as Lestrade takes a place by his side and asks questions that Sherlock can’t hear. Before long, the detective is on a stretcher and in an ambulance. In a haze, his eyes shift sleepily from one paramedic to another. Their already quiet words begin to wash together as darkness creeps along the sides of his vision. With his last coherent thought, he wishes John was in the ambulance with him and resolves to do something about it before the next time one of them is transported to the hospital.
“I should think not. I invented it,” Sherlock said haughtily, the pleasure obvious in his whole body. A sudden laugh burst from John’s lips, taking both men by surprise. Sherlock’s features were just beginning to harden when John caught his breath to speak.
“Ah,” John grins cheekily, “makes sense with all the strategies, cuts and turns, and all those jumps.”
“Homes,” John says unexpectedly and Sherlock’s heart stops. His silver grey eyes widen and his lips turn up into a smile. It is possibly the biggest smile Sherlock has even worn. John remembers him. John Watson knows him on sight, in spite of everything. Sherlock’s heart swells to two hundred times its original size and the yes flows past his lips in a voice so quiet and happy it scarcely sounds like his.
Sherlock turns his head to face away from the track, glancing at the clock. He puts the phone to his ear.
“Are they? Why don’t you sit down and let me take a look?”
Hello, my lovelies! I've missed you from one weekend to the next. This week went by so quickly too. I can hardly believe it. Like all of you, I'm trying to get used to a new schedule, kids being home from school and trying to home school them. God, what a time to realize I'm not cut out to be a teacher.
I connected it to the series, but is it a work that stands on its own. Please, if you like Part 1, go read Part 2 and see the story continue.
“No, John,” Sherlock is shaking his head before the words are even out, “you are extraordinary.”
“True enough. They’re rather adorable that way,” John’s eyes twinkle.
“FINE,” he replies through clenched teeth, wrenching his arm away and walking to his room. He mumbles as he goes. “You’re as bad as Mycroft.”
Could he have saved him? Would it have made any difference or is Sherlock right? Would he be dead too?
“You aren’t worth my time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock sits next to him and they both sip their coffees. He tries to read John in sideways glances. He looks tired, but not worried or frazzled. Assured of Janine’s condition, Sherlock allows himself to relax further and take a moment to observe John. It is quickly becoming one of his favorite pastimes; watching John. John’s face is all soft lines and dimples. His eyes are the color of the ocean, clear blue like a sunny day with expressive specks of midnight. His cheeks grow a most delightful shade of pink while Sherlock watches him. He finally stops his observations when John clears his throat and sits up straight in his chair. A bit not good, he supposes.
4. And the one question burning in everyone's mind... Just WHAT was John going to say after "But now"?? Oooo, oooo, a shiver runs down my spine just thinking of THAT one.
Still he tries, tearing at Moriarty’s flesh and grappling desperately for the upper hand or leverage or anything that will help. Even as he struggles for his own life, his mind turns to thoughts of John. Alone in the water, in the dark, dying. Sherlock’s lungs are just beginning to burn for lack of oxygen. John has been underwater for thirty seconds. How long can John hold his breath before his lungs inhale involuntarily in search of air only to fill with water?
boyfriend,” he said petulantly. Sherlock managed to mostly conceal his sneer as he said the last word. John could not stop his quiet chuckle at the man’s jealousy.
Read that last sound as a guttural cry of agony.
I also want to draw your attention to the tags. They have changed a bit and I want everyone to be prepared. In addition to the tags, I will be writing non-con warnings into the chapter summaries. I will also identify sections of chapters that can be omitted if it is a trigger to anyone.
“It’ll be fine,” Sherlock repeats in a whisper. “Clara will help keep her on track. She’ll follow her anywhere.”
John considers his dinner with Mary as he cleans his teeth. He supposes it would be easy for her to misjudge the detective. After all, John himself thought he was an ass when he first met him. An incredibly intriguing and sexy ass, but an ass nonetheless. The corners of his mouth curl upward as he thinks back on that day in Molly’s lab when Mike Stamford introduced him to the great Sherlock Holmes. It was all so coincidental, so perfect. Meeting the exact man he needed to meet at the exact moment he needed him. So much like the fate Sherlock doesn’t believe in. John looks at himself in the mirror for a moment and then leans forward to spit into the sink.
The detective and his blogger return home. Yay!
Sherlock finally casts a glance at his befuddled flatmate and immediately bolts from the room, leaving John standing in front of his chair alone. The door to the detective’s room slams shut and locks. John sighs and lets his shoulders sag.
It is not a question exactly, but his tone rises at the end as though it is one. Greg had donned his scuba gear and disappeared into the water when they were still quite far from The Crown. Sherlock could easily see its four occupants on deck, but not clearly enough to determine who was who by features. He still knew, of course, based upon their relative positions. He knew John would be in the water soon and that they needed to act fast, but had no idea how quickly Greg could swim or how easy it would be to find John once he got there. Sherlock had tried to delay Moriarty as long as he could and John still went into the water before Sherlock would have liked.
“It’s not going to be easy, but he needs a decent night’s sleep,” Molly lets out a puff of air, contemplating the task ahead. “He hasn’t even tried to sleep since this whole thing started.”
Sherlock glares daggers at him and Greg is certain the man is considering a full-on strop. He watches Sherlock with a hard, commanding and unrelenting gaze. Finally, the taller man sighs and grabs the small chair tucked next to a filing cabinet, leaving the more comfortable and prominent one for Mrs. Hudson.
“And how you brought the team back from ruin. Very admirable.”
“Jesus, Greg,” he huffs in mild disbelief.
Seriously, WTF!
"The cabbie."
The detective quickly snaps from his thoughts, looks at John for a moment, and then draws him in for a comforting kiss.
Thank you again for all the love and support. I love having little comment conversations, so thanks to all who left one and even responded back. Every one of you, reader and commenter alike, makes me smile.
Thank you all for your love and support and feel free to let your emotions fly. I must confess, I'm especially interested in seeing if my good friends, Sherly and AGPatton will leave comments with tons of swears. I love those messages. Tee hee.
This much is true-oo-oo
“Yes,” Sherlock answers before he can think better of it. He looks at John, who is very clearly surprised. Anything more than that is difficult to read. Sherlock crinkles his brow in frustration. This would all be so much easier if he could deduce John properly. Of all the people he has ever met, why does the one person whose innermost feelings he most wants to know have to be so damn impossible to read? “We are friends and I want to help.”
“You didn’t,” Sherlock says simply. John huffs a quiet, disbelieving laugh as Sherlock leans in. “You are concerned about your past, about what I have learned of it, especially this morning.”
Sherlock cocks a brow and gives him a questioning look.
“No, not really. We all had some good scrapes, but never anything serious,” Sherlock drinks some wine, replaces his glass and waves his hand as a means of transition. “We kept at it for years. We started learning everything - rules, techniques, strategies - everything. We were going to be championship skaters together.”
Love, Jane
“Yes, sir,” she replies and steps up to the steering column. The remaining officer takes hold of Moriarty and drags him to the side. Propping him up to sit, he stands next to him to prevent any escape attempt. Not that Moriarty could get away if he tried and he glares across the boat at John and Sherlock.
John isn't going to resign.
1) Is Sherlock right to worry about leaving John in Baltimore?
And don't forget all the other lingering questions.
After a short cab ride through London, John emerges from the car and walks swiftly into a tall, but rather inconspicuous building. Getting through security is no problem, due to his association with Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes, and the fact that has been summoned to the building before. He makes a beeline for Mycroft’s office, ready to push his way passed the man’s rather surly secretary. Much to his surprise, he finds himself staring into the eyes of the elder Holmes when he walks in.The gatekeeper is nowhere to be found.
No, I can’t help falling in love with you
Will John?
I guess you all know I'm not going to stop at Part 4 now. I hope no one's disappointed that the show goes on. I know this is one damn long series, but hey, I've never made a secret of it. Persistence is key. A BIG, HUGE THANK YOU to all of you! You, who have stuck with me through it all. I draw so much strength and joy from all of you, and hope I'm bring you just as much joy with each new chapter. I love you all and hope to see you for Part 5. I'll work on getting it out as soon as I can.
One of the other three officers who climbed onto the boat tucks his gun away and heads for Greg, pulling out a pair of handcuffs. Sherlock can see now that this sergeant is the highest ranking officer among them and clearly has no idea what is going on. Why did he even bother to call them and impart any information at all? Typical. Thoroughly annoyed, he rolls his eyes and says pointedly:
“Oh?” John tilted his head, interest peaked by that casual statement. “What does that mean?”
“Oh, right,” John looks disappointed and his face falls a fraction.
“Don’t worry about it,” Sherlock smirks. “Wouldn’t be the first time.”
legendary, isn’t it?” John replies from behind his water glass. “I think that’s made my choice for me. And you?”
“I know, I know,” Greg runs a hand through his hair. “Look, maybe he won’t bring it up again. He dropped it, didn’t he? He just thinks you’re a private person.”
Another flip.
I promise you won't have to wait as long for the next chapters. Love you all!
I know, I know, two chapters in two days is either Christmastime or overwhelming, but I couldn't sit on this chapter any longer. I just couldn't!
“You know now,” his words silencing John. “Now you can help Molly find out who’s doing it and then prove it. I have the tox report, but it isn’t much good without a suspect and proof.”
“A Herculean feet indeed,” Sherlock snarks.
“Because there are more important matters at hand,” Sherlock bends at the knees for emphasis with all-out annoyance on his features. “As soon as he gets home tonight, he’ll start asking questions and what am I supposed to say? Greg was surprised I’d let you live with me because I ‘like you’? Jesus Christ!”
Stay tuned. If it doesn't come out in this part, it will in another one. I know I keep saying it, but Persistence is key. LOL.
“Why on earth not? You’re equals within the organization.”
dancing his way toward John. He was decidedly not staring at John with his mesmerizing and other worldly eyes. John’s mouth went dry again and he blinked once more for good measure, his brain seizing utterly. He watched, unable to look at anyone else as the man left the floor and swept up to the bar next to him. The man gave John a knowing smile and studied him with a sultry, but intensely intelligent gaze. Dumbfounded, John could only look back at him with wide eyes and will his own brain to work again before he truly proved himself a complete idiot.
“The one in pink with the dark hair and flashy belt,” Sherlock directed John’s eyes until his gaze settled on a middle-aged woman holding a martini. She was laughing at something the man with her, clad in a trendy-cut white suit, had said. He tapped his G & T against her glass in a toast.
“He’ll listen to you and Molly, John,” Billy says in a voice of absolute certainty.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m good,” John replies, breathing a little fast. God, he is so exhausted. His body feels like it could seize up and drop at any moment. The adrenaline is wearing off and the shock of nearly drowning is catching up with him, but he has to hang on. He has to get out of the water and onto the boat where he can let himself collapse safely. As soon as he makes sure Sherlock is all right, of course. John cannot rest until he knows the love of his life is alive and well and before his eyes, cheekbones, curls and all. God, how he longs to see that smug smirk on Sherlock’s beautiful face.
“Six weeks?!” Sherlock bellows. John squares his shoulders and prepares for a fight, ready to defend his position to the end. But Sherlock surprises him, his expression becoming less angry and more thoughtful.
“But why do you two hate each other so much?”
Will John tell Sherlock what he finds out?
* Wait a minute. KC and the patriots? JaneOFCakes, the Empress of Evil, watches football on Sunday nights?? (You bet your ass I do and, if you ask nicely, I'll tell you my two favorite teams and the two I hate the most. I am a woman with many hobbies.)
Irene gives Sally a very sly, knowing look and the two dissolve into snickers.
“Yeah,” he replied in an even tone, not wanting to fully broadcast his irritation. Greg was perceptive though and John knew it. Damn that man learned too much about people’s tells in all his years of bar tending. “He called me at work and wanted to meet here. We’ve not seen much of each other lately.”
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock confirmed quickly. “Naturally nothing that would compromise patient confidentiality, but the work and advice of a skilled surgeon would come in very handy. Maybe even at crime scenes, if you’re willing.”
But John is not stepping back. His blue eyes explore every inch of Sherlock’s face as though he has the same idea Sherlock does, but that cannot be. John does not feel the same way and Sherlock feels so many things at once - joy, safety, adoration, comfort and... He feels like he is home. Not just in his condo, but home.
“Don’t be,” John answered, removing his hand from the man’s shoulder. “We’ve already moved on and it’s better this way.”
Sherlock cocks a brow.
Sherlock thanks him and sits down. He looks back at the skaters again and then gazes across the aisle at John. He has a curious expression on his face. His lips turned up on one side in that crooked smile Sherlock loves so much. His stomach flips, even as he affects nonchalance.
“I got him off a murder charge,” Sherlock answered in amusement, his rumbling baritone honeyed with satisfaction. John gulped, so caught up in the sheer brilliance of this man. There were a thousand questions in John’s mind and he wanted to ask every single one as soon as they could get out of the club with its loud beat, blaring music and tons of people.
1. What. The fuck. Just happened. With John????? Is he okay? Is he hurt? Surely not dead. Jane wouldn't do that, would she? Aaahhhhhh!
Hello, my friends! I’ve been working off and on all day to get this one out because I’ll be stupid busy tomorrow with it being mother’s day and all. As it is, I have to keep stopping for long periods of time when all I really want to do is post this and work on my bedazzling project. Gah. And I thought week days were exasperating. It’s so hard to tell the difference now anyway. Oh, shit. I need to do the laundry. And it's 7pm already. Fuck. When did that happen? Also, a lego campout set just arrived in the mail and I want to put it together instead of saving it for my daughter. Ha! I'm just evil.
Greg was the first to come into the fold as an expert and honest general manager. He revolutionized every aspect of team business, making it professional and accountable once again. Together, he and Mrs. Hudson hired a most accomplished staff for the team to depend upon. It was his demeanor more than his experience that made Mrs. Hudson trust his judgement implicitly, in spite of being roughly 25 years her junior.
1) What kind of hair-brained scheme is Sherlock going to come up for this one?
“John…”
“Ass,” John accuses playfully from atop Sherlock’s chest. The coach wriggles beneath his body to no avail. He places his hands on John’s hips and then slides them a few inches up John’s sides. Sherlock’s breath hitches and he blinks once. His nerves are somewhere between disbelief and sheer panic. If they keep this up his body is going to react in a way he cannot easily hide from John. He must end this here and now before he gives away everything.
“So we’ll watch for him at the bout and around the hotel. If we see him, we’ll get a hold of him and find out what the hell he’s doing here,” John tells him. Sherlock nods, unable to keep the smile from forming and John follows suit. “What?”
John asks Mycroft a question.
Sherlock darts forward, closing the distance between them in two quick strides. He grasps John’s biceps with both hands and squares his shoulders. John’s slackening hand drops the apple. His eyes follow as he looks down, crestfallen. A tear drips down his cheek.
“Did you consider the possibility that it might be someone skating with Rock City?” John all but whispers. It is a huge gamble. The man might clam up and throw him out at just the suggestion. He had worked with Rock City a long time. He is sure to have plenty of pull with Mrs. Hudson and the staff. One angry phone call about paranoid and insulting accusations could get John fired before he has even started. John waits and watches the doctor for signs of anger that do not come.
“No,” Billy sighs. John feels himself deflating and he cannot hide his disappointment. Billy shakes his head. “I could easily see there were more injuries than usual. It was as plain as the nose on your face. Didn’t really occur to me that it could be anything other than a series of unfortunate accidents until Molly brought it up.”
“Why not a house?” John’s voice is quiet and pained.
“You’re in the way,” he says petulantly.
“He’s a good ally to have, Watson,” Billy says instead of answering. He leans forward again and looks at John intently. “After what you’ve told me, I can see now that whatever was going on is more serious than I thought. I was a fool for not seeing it then.”
“You should know by now not to keep us waiting,” Hella teases, standing at her seat with a knee resting on its cushions.
“Thank you,” Sherlock all but whispers, giving John another squeeze.
“Yes,” Sherlock says again in a smooth tone. He notices a shiver ripple through John’s body and narrows his eyes. “I do. Thank you, John.”
“They’re over there,” Annika points. “I came over to get you.”
“What is this?”
“God, yes.”
“What about me?” John counters.
You should know how it feels
God, there are so many questions and no answers. No fricking answers, Jane. BAAAHHHHH! I know. Believe me, I know, and I intend to answer every one of them...at some point. By the way, you might have noticed in the tags that I have added another chapter. As I was editing, I began to realize that there was just too much for one chapter and it simply had to be split into two. So now there are two more chapters after this one to look forward to. Huzzah! 😁 I hope they continue to entertain and give solace. Thank you all for your love and support. I shall see you...oh shit! I just realized I may be traveling next weekend and unable to post. Given that, I may end up waiting another two weeks to post. Unless, of course, the outcry is too overwhelming not to. 😂 If it is, I might post next Monday. In the meantime, I love you. Stay safe and keep your stick on the ice. We're all in this together.
4) Will the dating begin when John returns to Detroit? (And how cute would that be??)
“You see,” John finally answers almost playfully, “I don’t know you.”
Sherlock looks past John for a moment, feeling himself being pulled down a rabbit hole to a place he would rather not go. He fixes his gaze on John once more, a more critical gaze this time.
He pauses to run a hand through his hair and cover his mouth in thought. When he removes it, he also shuffles his feet closer to Sherlock’s, bringing them even closer.
John nods and blinks slowly.
Recovery time!
“But they should start looking before he disappears,” John protests.
“The same man made another attempt here last night.”
“If all goes well, we’ll be able to follow in 24 hours. It won’t be long,” John reassures him.
Same bat time. Same bat channel.
“I can’t deny that Griffy vouching for him doesn’t lend credence to that, but I would like to have met him first,” Greg says carefully. “Asked him some of my own questions. Maybe had the opportunity to factor into the decision.”
“He’s your age, dear,” Mrs. Hudson ignores both men and what should be an insulting remark on her advanced age. Sherlock continues to frown.
John tilts his head and furrows his brow as he watches Sherlock. The taller man looks utterly flummoxed and John has no idea why.
Sally flirts with John.
The rest of the bout goes without a hitch. Rock City wins by fifteen points. Sherlock receives a call from John just after his celebratory remarks in the locker room. He confirms an oblique fracture of the tibia, just under the knee and a stable fracture of the fibula where it meets the talus. Both require surgery and John will stay at the hospital until Smacks is resting comfortably. Sherlock gives the news to the team once everyone is on the bus for the hotel.
* Does he care enough about Moriarty to want to continue his work?
“And would this ‘something else’ be a relationship?” he shakes his head, “No, Dr. Watson. Caring is not an advantage and my brother knows it. All hearts are broken.”
Sherlock shrugs away from John’s touch, leaving his hand hovering alone between them. By the time it is back at John’s side, Sherlock is at the door with his hand on the knob.
Thank you all for sticking with me and, hopefully, to stay with me (if another part is in store). I love you all. Knowing this story brings each and every one of you joy, sorrow, and love is the best feeling ever. I almost didn't post this story, but I am so very glad I did.
Looks like I've already stumbled into the DP questions, so bring it.
“Fine,” he mutters and sits with a thunk.
“Nothing. It’s just… You’re usually so polite and charming, but now…” Sherlock looks away coyly, but then snaps his gaze back to John and continues in a firm tone because he was absolutely
“Right, right. Sorry.” John turns to go and takes a few steps, but stops. Sherlock’s head is tilted to one side. John can almost see the impatient expression on his face through the back of his head as he waits for John to speak. John takes a couple of hesitant steps toward the sofa.
John wears a fond smile and has a far away look in his eyes. He clearly shares the opinion and loves them dearly. But suddenly he sobers and the wistfulness vanishes.
“It’s a big city,” Billy replies. “They are Rock City’s biggest rival. Bouts with them are always the worst and hardest hitting.”
The room is deathly silent. Mrs. Hudson has risen from her chair and crowded forward to glower down at Sherlock. There aren’t many people in the stadium who are taller than Sherlock and none when he has skates on, so when the rare opportunity to use height against him arises, everyone takes it.
* Where is John?? How is John?? Can Sherlock save John?? Can Sherlock even find John?!
“Oh, Sherlock, I couldn’t,” John starts, raising a hand in protest. Sherlock silently blows out a breath of relief that he has skirted the line and John has not taken offense. He shrugs, his confidence returning.
“Mine too,” John remarks. “Want to go through together? We could go for lunch when we’re done.”
He shakes his head, his face now full of regret and urgency.
“Absolutely! I’d love to...oh,” he stopped himself mid-sentence and his face fell, coming to his senses before getting far in his reply. Releasing Sherlock’s shoulder and straightening up, John remembered why he was here tonight. Jim was the whole reason for even being in the club. He could not just leave.
“Evening,” John answers just before losing his grip and clutching at the side, pulling himself tight against it in an effort not to fall.
Riley looks from coach to doctor and nods sharply. He rises and immediately addresses the sergeant. Already getting an earful from Greg, and beginning to understand the circumstances of the rescue, Budreau gives his approval. Riley adjusts Sherlock’s handcuffs so his hands are also in front of his body and then helps John to walk down the steps to the cabin. The man remains with them for the duration of the trip, standing back and silently watching, but neither Sherlock nor John spare him a thought.
“What? Why?” John’s eyes fill with concern and his pupils begin to shrink, even as Sherlock smiles and strokes his hair. “Have I done something wrong?”
He hrumphs and rolls his eyes. John continues to smile and reaches for Sherlock’s hand. Drawing it to his mouth, he brushes his lips over the detective’s knuckles and then kisses the back of his hand. John’s smile widens at the visible shiver that passes through Sherlock’s body. He closes his mouth around the index finger and sucks lightly. Sherlock slowly turns his head to meet John’s eyes and pulls the finger from his mouth with a pop. His face is dead serious, but John can tell he’s trying not to smile.
“Not physically anyway,” Sherlock clarified and actually looked a bit sad, “but an emotional connection really is more of a betrayal.”
“All right. Fine,” he agrees, still a bit tetchy. “In your car.”
“Do you…” John begins, but stops immediately. His features alter into something more decisive and his voice is authoritative when he speaks again. “This has something to do with Billy.”
“No? You don’t believe points on one’s feet or hands correspond to different organs?”
“She’s done it again,” Greg replies, ignoring the jibe and deathly serious.
3) How is Sherlock going to feel about all this once he has a chance to think about the fact that he just confessed his love for John? (head exploding)
Much love to all (and hopefully another new chapter will be out soon).
And yet, there he is. Still at Sherlock's side, still wanting to know more and learn more, wanting to understand why he did what he did and why he didn't tell John about his sister. He wants to get to the truth of it instead of blowing up. Greg was right when he said John is more patient than he was before and Sherlock was right when he said John is using everything he ever learned from him to put his memory back together. When Sherlock blames himself for what happened with Eurus, John comes to his defense. For as smart as Sherlock is, he doesn't always follow his own advice. Don't just see. Observe.
3) Will this distract them both from the bout and the mystery?
And then John says no. AH! Gut-wrenching! And why? Why?!? I hope you can all understand John's reasoning and don't hate him...or me.
“This will help,” he tells him in a quiet voice. John simply nods in response and sits up more, blankets falling away to rest on his lap. He takes the cup in his hands and breathes in the steam. He exhales slowly, the scent of chamomile easing his nerves.
Hi ho, Everyone! It’s been a rough week for a variety of reasons and just when stress was the highest, I got another curve ball. Gotta love that, not to mention your very own Cakey Jane using baseball metaphors. Gah! Has the world gone mad? Haha. Anyway, I’m hoping things get better and that you all like the chapter. It has also been a source of anxiety for me and I’m a little hesitant to post it. Any and all comments are welcome.
would have been a tragedy. And I think Bill would agree.”
“He’s not my date,” Sherlock says quickly in a clipped tone, feeling his cheeks growing hot and hoping they aren’t as pink as they feel.
* The apple!! Gah! WTF?!?!
'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
So what happens now? What just happened exactly? Tune in next time for the answers. Same bat time. Same bat channel.
“Fucking hell!” John shouted, looking after the cab. He lifted his arms and shook them slowly as he looked down his own body. He was soaked and filthy. A cab would never take him in this condition. He sighed and muttered angry curses as he touched his dripping shirt. His trousers were just as wet, and cold. Jesus, it was cold. It was going to be a long walk home.
Sherlock places the instrument and bow back in the case and moves toward the door, but pauses mid-step when there is another soft knock. He rolls his eyes and places his hands on his hips. This has happened before. There’s only one person it could be and Sherlock is beyond ticked off. He stomps the last few steps, releases the deadbolt in one swift movement and jerks the door open.
(Bonus points if you know the show and sketch. Oops! I just gave you a hint. Haha!)
It suddenly occurs to me that I didn't mention Jim in this chapter. Needless to say, he never returned to 221C. But he's still skulking around and pissed as hell.
I hope this chapter finds you all well and anxious for more. Honestly, I hope this provides a nice escape for you all. We are living in some crazy, crazy times. This has been a weird week with all the updates and changes. I hope everyone is okay.
He seems to be the exception to every rule, and he seems to encourage change in John with every passing day. Today’s is more obvious than any John has noticed to date. He simply does not get jealous as a rule. He probably hadn’t cared enough about any partner in the past to get jealous. Yes, he expects loyalty when he and a lover agree to be exclusive, which he and Sherlock have not done. John left Sherlock’s room before they had a chance to even consider it.
“Well, that complicates things.”
“I’m always at the stadium just like you,” John says with a smile, “and I’m not one for going to a gym in the middle of the night. Or getting up at the bloody break of dawn.”
John yells at Mycroft.
“We’ll get you to the hospital once we reach the marina,” Sherlock informs him, leaving no room for question. He is well aware of the fact that John Watson does not like to be told what to do, but he doesn’t give a damn right now. John looks up at him with a scowl on his face, but does not protest. “Stay here. I’ll get something to slow the bleeding.”
“Do we?” Sherlock quirks a brow, looking back at John. If he is going for confusion, he isn’t pulling it off in the slightest. John can tell he knows exactly what he’s referring to.
Yikes! I can't wait to hear what you all think of this one!
John’s forehead crinkled with doubt, his lips curling into a skeptical smirk.
Enough rambling, Jane! Get on with it. Here we go.
I am constantly blown away by all of you and I want to extend my thanks for all the love and support. All the comments and kudos and bookmarks on both parts always bring a smile to my face and a skip in my step. You all keep me going and make me love writing even more. Thank you from deep in my heart. I love you all.
“Right, right,” John replies. The expression on his face just as fond as his tone. He also looks very amused. Sherlock’s cheeks grow pink and his stomach flips again.
There. That's my philosophy lesson for the day. I also want to add that I'm already editing Part 4 and it'll be coming up soon. YAY! I also, also want to thank you all again for your love and support. Writing is such a joy for me and I am delighted to bring joy to others. I love you all. I also, also, also (I promise this is the last one) want to mention a snippet from a comment written by my one and only Sherly. "Moriarty is a shit. Fuck him! He is a total dick." Sherly, HE SO IS!! I'm right there with ya. He needs his comeuppance, damn it, and NOW. This message tickled me to the core. Love you.
“Yes, sir,” Riley nods and hurries away. Budreau turns back to Sherlock and John, giving them a congenial tilt of the head.
“After I rang Mrs. Hudson to fetch you from school,” he tells her cautiously, “Daddy asked about you.”
“This would be a lot easier if you lie down,” he says almost timidly, “and less painful.”
“But you nearly told the one person who absolutely cannot know!”
“Hey. Sorry I’m late. I was finishing up some notes,” he pauses to take in Sherlock’s appearance and tilts his head slightly. “You okay?”
“She hired a doctor she met at the conference,” Greg pauses, hoping Sherlock will not start shouting like last time. However, this is almost worse. It is never good when the man goes quiet. Greg bites his lip and goes on. “He starts on Thursday.”
But how long will it last?
“Christ, Coach, where have you been?” HardOn cries upon catching sight of him. “We’re starving!”
Thank you again for all the LOVE and SUPPORT! Your hits, kudos, and comments combine into a huge shaft of gold when all around is dark.
“I did once,” John replies in a choked voice. He clears his throat and seems to collect himself. Watching the struggle to reign in his emotions, Sherlock desperately wants to take his hand or even take the man into his arms. His body aches with the urge to comfort John in any way he is capable.
“John…”
“His name is John Watson.”
No docks or boats?? How the hell will John get off the island?!
John and Sherlock both swayed skillfully, waiting for the tempo to pick up and for the playful chorus to kick in. Sherlock rolled his shoulders to the music, snapping his head back with the flare of a flamenco dancer at just the right moment. His curls floated through the air for just a moment as though defying gravity’s bonds and then fell artfully around his face as he gave John a cheeky smirk. John could not help and laughed as the song broke open and they both began moving to the faster beat. The music and lyrics wrapped around them as they pulsed their way through the two men’s bodies and minds.
Sherlock and Rosie burst through the door to 221B. The little girl drops her school bag and tears off her coat. She tosses it to its hook and hits the target perfectly. Sherlock raises a brow, following her slowly.
“We did,” Sherlock nods, admiring the brilliant smile his answer receives. His stomach does a flip.
I'm baaaaack!
John's life on the island begins.
Dropping his bags onto the bed unceremoniously, Sherlock runs a hand through his hair and sighs. They boarded Mrs. Hudson’s charter plane that morning, destined for Baltimore and a bout against the Rolling Ravens. With the bout on the following day, they loaded a bus and went straight from the airport to the practice facility to get some footwork and scrimmaging in. It is now around 5:30 and, having just arrived at the Sussex, they are all dropping bags in their rooms and meeting back on the bus for dinner.
“Nine and ten,” Sherlock answers, silently cursing his damn stomach. “From then on we started blocking each other. Sometimes we got other kids in the neighborhood to block while we jammed.”
“I know, Sherlock. I know.”
“I may not have been the only target after all. You and Molly have to stop it before something terrible happens. Get Sherlock to help. He will face the devil himself for the ladies. He’ll listen to the two of you. Don’t dismiss him as a lost cause.”
Sherlock drapes a blanket around his shoulders and pulls a chair close to the bed to sit next to him, his perceptive gaze finally able to take in every detail of John’s form and condition. His bruised and lacerated wrists, bruised temple with a fresh wound that still slowly weeps a thin line of blood. He must get a cloth for that and some ice. That is when he sees it. The dark red soaking into the side of John’s shirt, on his torso and just under his right arm. It is easily overlooked since he is soaked to the bone and his shirt is such a dark blue that it looks black with all the water.
“Did you?” Sherlock asks, not failing to notice John has not moved his elbow. The doctor raises his eyes and looks at him sadly.
Also, before we get to the questions, WHAT THE FUCK, MARY?? Back off the doctor. Sherlock is jealous perhaps? Anyone else see that? Then a little spat and DINNER?? Ooooooo, the mind boggles.
“Sherlock,” she admonished. He sighed and looked down at his ice cream, prodding it with his spoon.
John and Jim had started growing apart a long time ago. They were happy once and for quite a while, in fact. They met when John was still in med school during the A&E rotation. Jim was working in construction and had sliced a substantial gash in his forearm. They hit it off while John stitched him up and Jim asked him out before he left for home that night. The rest, as they say, was history.
Yes, Jane is back and full of beans! (bonus points to anyone who knows where that comes from) I have a wonderful new story for you all, my friends. It's my very own Season 4 fix/continuation/ultimately-what-I-would've-liked-to-see-happen-instead-of-what-they-actually-did. I only changed, or subtracted one might say, the last episode. I hope you all like it and aren't too upset that it isn't Persistence II. (It's coming, I promise.)
Quads - roller skates with four wheels.
“But John…”
Now, a little of what you all love best about me - a chapter and a little craziness, maybe a little snarkiness, maybe a little of column A and a little of column B. Or maybe I'll save that for the end. Haha. Anyway, so John has a little more information from the good Dr. Wiggins, but what will he do with it? There's a lot to weigh in on and a lot to do. Getting to know the skaters and staffers is number one on his list.
“Bring a torch?”
“Yes, of course. Sussex, was it? Have Mr Ferguson meet us at Victoria station by 9:30 this evening, I need to see the house. John and I will stay at an inn and come over in the morning.”
John took two steps back and turned on his heel. “That’s my limit. I’m going to the lighthouse.”
“Well, best not to take chances. Look, it’s paid off.” Sherlock pointed to a dirt devil kicking up a few feet away from them in a patch of earth. Both men got to their feet as it calmed to inspect what had been left.
“Sherlock, what?!”
Frowning, Sherlock took the page from John. “How am I supposed to collect any data if all my resources are splattered with false leads? I may as well scrape through the children’s section at the library for all the good research will do.”
They landed hard but not worse than singed, and John scrambled to keep moving them as his eyes followed the erratic, flitting creature. It dashed around, growing smaller or larger at random, and as it went to pass Moriarty John readied himself to use the distraction to free Bluebell. She was hanging limp, eyes slitted and weepy, and as a jackrabbit she was heavy enough holding her that way could damage her.
Sherlock was mindful of the warning from their arrival, but John was distracted by checking his watch and calculating if they’d make it in time. His foot came down on rock instead of grass and at first he thought he was slipping on the wet surface.
Sherlock moves over to the fridge once the water’s been set to boil and roots around in the back. The experiments have, blessedly, been designated to the bottom drawer except for special circumstances, and even then they are labeled and sectioned off from the rest of the food.
The bullet burrowed deeply into his gut, and Sherlock recognized instantly that there was only one thing that mattered.
Sherlock scoffs lightly, but without his usual bite. “So you want to kiss it better, is that what this is?”
The detective moves his head from where it’d been relaxed, cheek to the soft covers of the bed with his eyes closed trustingly, and turns to look over his shoulder at John. “Can you what?”
These are not best friend feelings. These are far bigger and scarier than he could have ever imagined, far more joyous than he ever dared hope -- or possibly more catastrophic than he ever could have feared.
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock.”
“Get out, John, and don’t try to text me. I’ll text you. Please, just go.” Sherlock points with and long, pale arm and his head tucked into his own chest, and his voice is as soft a plea as he’s ever heard.
John’s grin splits apart his face until he can barely push his lips together to kiss the other man’s vertebrae. “That is quite a long time.”
“You’re rather cold, Sherlock.”
“Yes. Yes to whatever you were meaning to say. You, Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade would have been killed if I had failed to convincingly commit suicide. And that, before all other things, was the most unacceptable. I had planned to spend a few months at most dismantling Moriarty’s web, but it was much larger than I’d anticipated -- and, unfortunately, more dangerous. That’s where I got most of these scars. A knife wound from Ukraine. A broken hand in Brazil. They tried to scalp me in Crimea. Tried to bleach my fingers, once, in Canada. Cigarette burns, from everywhere. Whip lashes from Serbia. That was the last leg of operations I had to take down. There were others, but...”
A scabbed voice, something's voice, someone's voice, sobbed as he firmly pressed the flailing, fighting Sherlock into his sheets, "Stop, Sherlock, please, you're going to hurt yourself. You need -- you need to stop, you're making it worse! Stop it, stop hurting yourself; I can't bear to see you in any more pain. Stop it, STOP IT RIGHT NOW."
“I’ve done everything for you.”
Sherlock was confused. He'd fallen into the voices. He'd told John his secret; he'd drowned in his blood and pain --
John’s almost cross-eyed at the startling confession. “Huh?”
“Tea?”
Sherlock’s blush intensifies as John goes to put the gifts around the tree. He can see that almost all of them are for Rosie (Sherlock would make a doting father, surely), but some are mysteriously void of indications.
“I don’t deserve your pity either,” he murmurs so softly that John can’t actually hear it without piecing together the scattered syllables.
He winces, but he kisses back with a smile on his face. They've got a future, he thinks. And it's never been brighter.
“Get the fuck out.”
He would be one to talk, though.
“Right on the mark,” John chuckles quietly, brushing feathery kisses along a particularly narrow knife scar that traces a long line from the nape of  Sherlock’s neck to his left hip. “But I think you’re a better person than you let yourself realize.”
His hands still stroked Sherlock's arms, and he smiled a little as he tenderly said, "Hello. Thanks for joining me -- you're a bit late and all...But better late than never, right...?" He laughed a little, nervous and with new scars in his voice.
FINALLY, AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS, I AM POSTING THIS
“Well, you know me. Creature of habit.”
Despite the evidence, Sherlock refused to believe this result was an effect of him, of his impending perishment, or the lake of blood flushing out of him. People didn't feel like that for him, didn't care like that. Surely something else had occurred while he had been otherwise occupied? Certainly John's cry was merely his answer to glancing Sherlock in this state, if anything at all related to Sherlock.
“You didn’t think I didn’t know, did you? John, honestly, how could I not know?”
“And she was okay with that?”
Sarah smiles at the open doorway. “Happy Christmas, John.”
Beneath the glare of his shiny tears, John's eyes pleaded with hope. Sherlock desperately wanted to allow him that, to let John live in a perpetual kind of possibility. To let John believe that he was coming back.
Unnecessarily, he asked, "...John?"
((And Greg gets exactly what he wanted for Christmas: He’s won the goddamned pool.))
John sits in his misery for only a few more moments before squeezing Sherlock’s hands and drying his face. He picks up the tube of ointment again once they’ve settled back on the bed, John straddling the back of Sherlock’s thighs as the detective lies comfortably on his stomach, and gestures vaguely to Sherlock’s body. “Can I...Can I?”
“Okay, here it is: Talk to the man. Give him something from the heart. I know that sounds like some Hollywood bullshit, but by God that crap works. If you want to show that man he’s loved, do it. Don’t nammy about it. Give him something to hold onto when he doubts your feelings, to show that you’re constant and devoted and that you’re not budging an inch from his side, even
“Am I that obvious?”
Irrational fear flooded him, taking control of his mind and body like an overdose. It was unrelenting in its grip; it seized him and shook him and cracked his fingers until he was ripping at his skin.
The words rattled around his ears as Sherlock finally took in the room. Kneeling beside him was John. Surrounding them and the steady hum of panic was the unsuspectingly ordinary London flat in which dwelled their most recent Greatest-Threat--Newest-Foe, and wrapped around his belly was a rigidly tied white cloth decorated with large plumes of red.
His arms are stacked high with brightly colored boxes.
He sits silently for an endless few moments, letting the kiss dry on his forehead as he thinks. “What exactly will these kisses mean to you, John? Are they being administered by a practicing doctor or a concerned friend?” Or--? John thinks.
They pull away with a soft smack, and John is enraptured by the sight of Sherlock’s lips reddened by kisses. Unable to resist, John presses a dozen more across the other man’s face, smooching the tip of his nose, the high cheekbones, his high brow, the soft skin of his blushing red cheeks.”It’s a Christmas miracle…” John murmurs against his lips with a smile.
“Glad to be of service, John.”
The blogger, who, so dear to his heart, had snatched it away, and John loved him, too. John loved him, to some extent. He was loved, in return!
The doctor's fingers tightened a little in his curls, but he began speaking with only the tiniest tremor in his voice.
“That’ll be a wonderful gift for Rosie when she’s older,” he sniffs, wiping his eyes and grinning brightly at the genius.
“She, actually. Figured you would like the name Hamish either way,” John smirks. “She’s an Irish Water Spaniel, and she’s hypoallergenic. I'm given to believe that she's hardworking and attentive, inquisitive and brave. Affectionate with those she loves.” John smiles hugely, more in love with this man than
His fingers move more delicately than they ever have -- except for the possible exception of the first time he held Rosie -- as he grips the hem of Sherlock’s T-shirt between two fingers, and when he nods his head slowly, curls bobbing with the movement, John tugs off the shirt as gently as he can.
He turns to observe John once more after he’s gotten the pickle jar in his arms. It looks like he put in a physical effort to avoid making that grunt again, which is so startling John’s almost bursting with the need to interrogate. He holds himself back, though, because watching Sherlock close up again is in no way an acceptable consequence of obtaining answers. John’s willing to ask, to attempt to sate his curiosity and see if Sherlock is willing to be open like that, but if his satisfaction comes at the price of Sherlock’s comfort -- or, heaven forbid, their friendship -- he would never bring up the subject again for as long as he could.
“John, he’s amazing!! How precious!!”
The blogger settles down by the tree and places his daughter in his lap. “Where’ve you been hiding these gifts, Sherlock? Surely you didn’t just buy them.”
“Oh, Rosie,” he sighs, placing the bottle in her chubby hands. “Do you know where your daft godfather is?”
Carefully, Sherlock hugged his arms around John and pressed his cheek more fully against the good doctor's torso, snuggling. He would press against John's heart, but the few inches he would have to raise to get there suddenly seemed more effort than he could afford.
There was an approximate nineteen percent chance of survival, and Sherlock could feel it slipping out of his hands. He had to say his piece now, or he would die trying.
The genius -- who already has tears pouring down his face -- gasps and rushes forward to cradle the snuffling puppy. He hands Rosie to John as he smothers the baby dog with kisses.
John perks up and instantly forgets his anger. Before he can ask, Sherlock holds up his hand and looks at him with intensely dark blue eyes. “John…” he says. “Whatever I tell you, you must understand that absolutely none of it was your fault.”
In the uncomfortably bright lights of his office, John can see the tired lines around her face, ones collected through years of watching children die on an operating table, of having an arrow pointed at your chest being a good date. But he can also see the lines of laughter, the lovely etchings of holidays spent with family and friends, of finally finding a man who would lay the world at her feet. She looks good.
Who. John feels the answer wash over him in a wave of black sludge. There isn’t a what, and there’s not even a question of who. He knows who did this.
“I’d rather not have such influence over your feelings.”
John laughs nervously, caught by the other man’s intense gaze. “That’s a silly question.”
John laughs and laughs as he stands in the doorway and brushes something suspiciously similar to tears from his eyes. “Happy Christmas, Sarah.” And then he’s gone.
“I don’t have to tell you anything! I’m obligated to my privacy, aren’t I? Just like the rest of the free world.”
John smiles again, and this time it’s purer, lighter. Sherlock may not have admitted to any sort of lasting romantic feelings, but he did sort of admit to a something and that was all he could ever ask for.
“Mm, it does actually. I can feel my back aching less.”
“Oh so it’s something special. Someone?”
John chuckles and nuzzles his face into Sherlock’s neck. He never in a million years would have guessed that this man was so thoughtful, so caring as to build him a keepsake of his late wife. He’s this close to abandoning his inhibitions and kissing him square on those delightful cupid bows of his. But first he has to explain himself, has to show Sherlock that he can be just as caring and thoughtful and vulnerable.
“Mm, not as silly as I used to think it was.”
“Merry Christmas, John.”
“No. They healed long ago. I hardly feel them anymore.”
“Sugar?”
"There's only one of a kind."
His face brightens. “Sarah, I think that’s a little forward!”
((And in his heart, maybe even something more than that -- which honestly only made his actions against the other man ten times more despicable.))
"You didn't have a pulse," he half-dazedly repeated.
“Bullshit!” John snaps, and he has to take a few deep breaths before he’s calm enough to not yell. “You deserved none of what I did to you, and I ought to be crawling for your forgiveness right about two months ago.”
“I promise, that for as long as you want me to, I will never, ever, let you go.”
"That's a first." John removed his hands from Sherlock and began to run his fingers through the thick, sweaty locks evenly, careful not to make any movements out of turn.
But then Sherlock bursts through the door. His hair is dusted with snow and there is a lovely red blush high on his cheeks. The Belstaff hangs dishevelled off his shoulders, and the scarf is haphazardly draped around his neck and one end touches the floor. He stares at John in surprise, and a touch of embarrassment slackens his mouth.
The sentiment makes John’s heart swell like a balloon full of helium. It rises to the top of his throat, blocking his airway. He wants to believe Sarah; he does, but he can’t trust himself. He’s not sure if he’s just hearing what he so achingly wants to.
“When...Where did you…. How?” he stammers, his mouth filling with bitter saliva.
"John," he began, "I'm not that g-good withhh...emotions." Sherlock's hand fumbled and gripped John's. "B-ut with-th you... I feeeel- nice. I-ye fe-el l-love. For- you. I...love- you."
"Please, Sherlock, please tell me this is another magic trick? Tell me you've just got to go away for a little while without anyone bothering you? And then you'll come back when you're done, right? You'll come back to me?"
And when he finally sees what’s there beneath that shirt, the pain starts anew in a fresh, terrifying wave.
“You’re not just worried about Christmas, are you?”
“I can’t believe you got me a dog.”
Books on wild, inexplicable sciences like agrostology (the study of grass) or oology (the study of eggs) would be appreciated, but perhaps a bit too tedious. Would Sherlock even read them? If he did, would he just delete them? John wanted to get him something really special for him this year, something he’d cherish.
“Okay with a ham sandwich?”
A sob split in the wake of Sherlock's confession. He smiled brightly, regardless of his scarlet teeth, for he needed no more. The weight of his words was lifted. Whispering, Sherlock pressed a kiss to John's palm with the words, "Thank you for my last deduction, love." Then, he stepped back into the voices and happily let himself drown.
John goes over to his side of the table -- which, if he were a braver man, would be the seat directly beside Sherlock’s but is currently at the other end -- and begins to eat on his sandwich as well. The silence isn’t uncomfortable on Sherlock’s end, as he clearly has delved back into his own world and doesn’t mind John’s presence, but John can’t help himself from feeling a little strange.
“Naturally, dear, but there are more pressing matters.”
“Yeah, you could say that. I want them to feel like someone special, but I think I’ve messed it all up. I...I’ve hurt them quite a lot this year, and I can’t even remember how much I hurt them in the past… I need this Christmas to go well, but I’m worried I haven’t done enough. Gosh, I don’t think I’ve done anything at all, I’ve been so scared of starting.”
He looked around the room and went to a solid-looking table. “Help me with this.”
Despite our brief greeting, I had taken note of the modest furniture, the wallpaper, the dusty lamps bathing the room with a warm light. I had noticed a small front garden, the masonry lining the outside of the cottage. There was the faint scent of beeswax in the air and a fragrance of lemon and lavender, which I realised was one that Miranda favoured. But there was no time to marvel at the homely comforts that Mary and Miranda had instilled for themselves in such a short time. I turned to James.
“I presume McGraw was signalling Lady Hamilton’s window, and it was none other than the Lady herself who opened the door?” I inquired after a brief quiet moment. “I do wonder how he was so confident signalling her while knowing he may wake her husband instead?”
We moved into the dining area where we had taken our breakfast just the previous morning. It was nearly incomprehensible to me how much everything had changed since then, how we now found ourselves in this company of James’ friends, who seemed to be an odd mix of ruffians and yet to whom we now owed our lives. With a scraping noise, Charles unceremoniously pushed two tables together.
if you would like to skip the graphic description of medical malpractice, stop reading at the line "... but my words died in my throat as we entered the cargo hold." and start reading again at "Watson!"
Sherlock is taken aback at Thomas’ words, both due to the intensity of how he says them, as well as the implication behind it. “What threat are you speaking of?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The gruff man standing next to James shot Jack a dangerous look. “We don’t have time for this. We need to leave before more arrive. Flint, where are your horses?”
Every eye moved from James and Silver to the form of my friend, including my own, and I felt my heart move to my throat.
More notably, however, Miranda no longer carried the bright joy in her eyes that was so familiar to me in the past. Now, there was a solemnity to the warm expression on her cheek, and much of the—sometimes reckless—joviality about her had vanished without a trace. Her wedding ring still adorned her finger and seeing it, I realised something I had long known anyway—although her marriage with Thomas had been unconventional at best, the love they shared was deep and true. His loss had shaken her to her core. Grief and worry were etched deep into her face, yet when she smiled in greeting some of the familiar warmth returned to her eyes.
of the world burning around me, I had to fight back against the same awful memories that James’ gunshot had awoken just moments prior. Now, they were domineering, and pushing against my mind with as much force as the thick fog of smoke. It was as if I was thirty years-old again, rushing through the shambles of a barricade we hoped would protect us, and I was just able to escape before a searing pain shot through me. The heat alone was unbearable. It bled into every single fold of my skin and I was certain, as certain as I had ever been, that I was going to die.
“Gentlemen,” Holmes said from my side. “I suggest we follow the young lady’s instructions. It is clear she has the upper hand in this situation.”
“What absent phrases sparked your interest?” I hoped he could not read the battle behind my eyes, or the resistance in my heart.
I obliged with a silent nod, and the four of us rode the long way back to The Hangman’s Rest.
“Miranda,” James breathed, shocked.
“All this time? After all that we have done?” Holmes finally spoke, a creak in his voice I did not wish to hear again. I could do one of two things now: claim ignorance as to what he referred, or fall in. Dive into the heart of what I had kept locked away for so long, in the hopes I may be able to float up to the surface again.
“For me to employ the aid of none other than yourself and Mrs. Watson, of course. It is clear to me now that the Hamiltons—while often more personable than others in their social circle—are most secretive indeed beneath the surface. To uncover what they wish to cloak in the shadow of open minded philosophy and progressive politics, that is what interests me. Yourself and Mary must befriend them. Report to me whatever information you can muster, and do not withhold a single detail, no matter how insignificant it may seem. I need you to do this for me, Watson.”
“Protect me?” Even though he cannot see it, Sherlock can almost hear Thomas raising his eyebrow. “I was a Peer of the Realm, a Member of Parliament and of the Privy Council. With all my respect, Mr. Holmes, there was nothing you could have done to protect me. My father’s influence reached far beyond what you could ever hope to affect. Had you intervened, it would have meant more hurt for you, for John, for Mary. I can only be glad that this did not come to pass.”
“I would suffer a thousand burns before feeling that distance from you ever again.”
For a moment, she considered us all carefully, with calculations I could not begin to comprehend taking place behind her cold eyes. Then: “I have been made aware that patients from a... private institution, financed by the Earl of Ashbourne, will be transported to Germany in a week’s time, to be relocated to the sanatorium of a doctor by the name of Oglethorpe. It is something to do with treatment and reform for men beset by madness, I believe. There are several routes, all kept in secret. I will tell you the correct route, once you hand over the coordinates.”
“The coordinates of the cache.”
Phoenix and Tim <3
“The signal,” James voiced my thoughts from behind me. “Miranda said she would leave two lanterns by the path every night for us. A light to beckon us home.”
“Doctor Watson, as much as I would enjoy catching up with the particulars of our time apart, I came here with another request. I was wondering if I could have a word with your colleague alone?” Thomas Hamilton asks, and Sherlock’s attention is instantly forced up toward the conversation he was half listening to a moment ago.
It was then that I began to understand why it was that my wife had asked for us to meet at the tea rooms, rather than our home. My realisation was allowed to mingle for mere moments, though, as my wife stood to greet the third party, approaching the table with an easy, elegant step. By default response, I stood to greet her as well. The lady that approached us had dark chestnut hair, fashioned intricately with jewellery, and an extensive patterned gown with matching gloves. Her face was kind and bright, a grin upon it that could make anyone feel understood, and the sharp, intelligent look in her eyes was eerily reminiscent of the one I so often met when I looked at Holmes’ face. She extended her degloved hand to me, and I pressed my lips to her knuckles.
And, with that, Holmes departed from our rooms, presumably to receive more information about Lord and Lady Hamilton. My friend was not incorrect in his assertion. I had somewhere to be for a luncheon, and no intention of being late.
Holmes’ darkened, silhouetted eyes looked up at me then from their firm place on the floor.
On the subject of James McGraw, it was made clear to me over the course of the evening that Thomas felt nothing but deep respect and admiration for his advisor. When he spoke of their work—a project McGraw was advising him on, one which Thomas could not share the sensitive details about—or his readings on philosophy, or his thoughts on the Whigs’ latest act in government, Thomas’ sentences would often begin with “James thinks …” or “James would say …”. He recollected the events of his very first meeting with the Lieutenant to us with an obvious fondness.
There was no need for interpretation of the next part of the conversation, however. Even though Holmes and I were sitting a considerable distance from the bar, the next words from the officer’s mouth were loud enough even for us—and, I would assume, a good part of the rest of the customers in the Red Lion—to hear without straining too hard.
“Of course, my dear Holmes, I could not fathom missing such a crucial study in this case!” I prayed that some of my genuine enthusiasm for working alongside Holmes won out over the fearsome nature of what lay beyond this night.
Silver mouthed curiously at me.
You reject my efforts in closeness, or whatever intimacy you so often referred to us holding in the years before you left. I wish, often, to return to those years. The years before marriage, age, and scandal of the most dangerous sort. Do you wish the same? Do you wish for anything, save the next case in your records, the next client at your step? That is a foolish question, is it not? I know the answer, or at least I used to. I used to think I understood the complexity of your mind, and your emotions, beyond that of the aloof detective in my serials. Now, as I count the months since last we spoke as I read your name within the Times, I wonder if any of those past observations were true.
“I have reached rather the same conclusion. My introduction to the Lady this afternoon indicated her nature to be little but a devoted wife, unconventional as she may be,” I replied. Despite my despair at my circumstances within this case, it was refreshing to be able to provide equal input with Holmes. It was not uncommon for me to provide assistance in our work, though I felt that Holmes was giving me a more significant grip upon the Hamilton affair than others in the past.
The blonde woman was once again tending to the bar. She shot one look at James and turned around. “Everyone out.
If James did say anything in reply to this odd discussion I did not hear it, but he did not take his hand off Silver’s forearm. We reached my rooms and slipped inside, as Holmes locked the door behind us with a decisive clang.
“I see. It truly is remarkable—how our lives can change in the blink of an eye on account of one chance meeting with one remarkable man. I have had experience of this, myself.” My throat tightened as Thomas’ gaze remained fixed on me, though I could not tell why. There was an enticing curve to his smile. “Tell me, Doctor Watson, is it not exhilarating to be in the presence of great men? There is a feeling of a specific thrill and excitement one gets in these cases. Have you felt it?”
Tears flowed freely from his eyes now, and I allowed myself the indulgence of wiping them away with my thumb.
We made our way down the stairs and out the door of the inn, and ventured out into the chilled Glasgow streets. There were not many other pedestrians walking along the rather quiet road, so our privacy could remain intact. Her arm wound around mine as we walked and our boots made unpleasant damp noises in the mud. I noticed her dress was getting stained but she did not seem to care much.
As we reached the landing, I could see in plain view the predicament before us. Vane and Rackham had been bound against two of the posts in the tavern, faces bloodied and bruised from multiple sprawling blows that must have gone unseen by our party. The source of said blows could most likely be attributed to the two rather large men beside them, prodding the ends of their pistols against their temples. Miss Guthrie, proud as ever, stood back near the bar and watched with a keen eye as we understood the truth of the matter at hand. She nodded towards someone and I felt a pressure at my back, heard Holmes’ hitched breath.
, and that such acts could be corroborated by witnesses provided that day.
“I mention this, Watson, because I know of your attachment to this land. You have never lived elsewhere, and your practise in London is rather dear to you. I worry— I have concern that this part of the journey may be one that could be too dangerous, or perhaps too painful, for you to embark on. If that is true, I will hold no fault toward you. It is a large change to commit yourself to for a man you knew so briefly and I—“
“We have twenty shots between us. There are only two men coming for now, judging by the steps. The vanguard. But there may be more behind them; how far, I do not know.” James gave me a grave and serious look, the look of a commander looking to bring an army into battle. “I suggest you do not waste your bullets, Doctor Watson.”
I swallowed, my throat moving painfully, every word feeling overcome with effort. “Thomas, I am—” How could I say what was on my mind without risking everything? How was I to know I could trust this man? “I do not think I can give you what you seek,” is what I finally settled on, watching his reaction with care, my entire body tense with anxiety.
The cadence with which John Silver spoke was one that forced you to listen, and did so much as to convince you that listening was the sole option available to you. Every eye in our party was upon him, though James’ appeared lidded and heavy beneath his usual attentiveness. It appeared as if he did not want to show how closely his ears were attuned to the words coming from his younger friend, yet someone who had seen him listen to the words of Thomas Hamilton could pinpoint it in an instant.
“I apologise, Watson. We are meant to be preparing for our departure from this place, and I should allow you the proper time to do so,” Holmes said, standing up again from his chair, indecisive about his movements. He rushed toward the door again, and therefore toward me, and I halted him with a hand on his chest.
“Read for yourself, Watson. Tell me what you see,” he retorted, flashing a sharp smile as he handed me the offending article. The envelope was unmarked and unremarkable, save for the name
“It is my belief that, whatever sabotage occurred during your mission this evening was brought on by intelligence that Eleanor Guthrie provided. For, who else could have obtained the information to do so, save the men in this room?”
Holmes and I continued to walk about the parlour in relative silence, occasionally breaking from it for commentary on the decor, or the next guest to depart the estate. Before I knew it, our party was the last remaining in the room. A part of my mind attached to a sense of propriety—one I felt slipping as each second passed in the Hamilton home—quivered at the thought that we may be overstaying our welcome. However, I glanced to the threshold of the parlour to see Thomas return to the room, positively beaming at our maintained presence. Seeing Holmes and I along the perimeter must have drawn his attention, as he then made his way toward us with zeal.
“I am in love with you, John.”
“Go to Marilès. Meet a man named Featherstone, who Max has already contacted on our behalf. Let him take us to a place outside of town, where we will find long abandoned cottages. Make cottages habitable as much as we can. Immediately send you a letter with directions. I remember, John, I assure you that your fretting is nothing more than an indulgence.”
“What a ridiculous notion,” Mary laughed and gently patted my cheek. Even as our hearts belonged to others, my love for her was a constant I could not deny. In the weeks before our reunion, I would miss the warmth in her eyes as she looked at me. I would doubly miss how such simple, teasing phrases from her managed to ground me upon the earth like little else.
“Now, if you eliminate myself from the possible suspects—as I know what my actions were—the list was rather limited. There was Mary and John Watson, yourself, Lady Hamilton and… Lord Peter Ashe. You mentioned in your letter that he had offered to help Lord Hamilton and yourself with his political campaign, correct? Well, it seems that Lord Ashe’s intentions may not have been of the purest sort.”
Instead, I smiled up at him as he watched me button up my shirt, and slipped on my winter slippers that he had placed before me. There was an unbearable weight within my chest as I realised, rather abruptly, that this was not the first time Sherlock had selected clothing for me after arousing me from sleep in the early morning. In our younger years, it was a rather common occurrence, in fact. Now, there was a quite separate gravity to the action. He was helping me dress myself in typical clothing, not a disguise. He was waking me from our shared bed, rather than my own bedroom. And, perhaps the most significant shift, he was not waking me up for the purpose of a lead in a most fascinating case. Now, all he wished for was to watch the sunrise in our new home.
“I am not one accustomed to gentle handed conversation or apology. I imagine you gathered this from John’s writings many years ago, and it is one thing from those stories that does stand to be true in reality. In saying as much, however, I have had many years to contemplate my actions in 1895, and the role I played in your life then, and up to this point. I have churned the events over in my mind for half a decade, and there is little on this Earth that I am more apologetic for—”
A GASP COMES OVER THE GALLERY
“Yes, it is perhaps for the best that we go.” It was a welcome exit point that Thomas had provided us, for I wanted nothing more but to extract myself from this moment, this conversation. I left the empty port glass on the small table near the chair.
“Was there a specific purpose to our meeting today? Could we not have had pleasant conversation within our own home?”
“Yes,” I breathed, for we had all memorised the precise directions to the cottages from Miranda’s letter, just in case. “Yes, I do. We will wait for you there, God willing.”
“I would be rather grateful if you did not tear my skin with the suture.” There was no animosity in James’ voice; quite the contrary. “I shall be plain with you, doctor. One does not need to be a detective to see, quite clearly, that Holmes’ feelings for you are just as deep as the ones you have harboured for him all these years.”
“How is it that you are so certain to abandon your work in London for this? You knew the Hamiltons less than even I did, and you have spent so much of your adult life building your reputation as that of a consulting detective. What is it that motivates you to leave behind all of that for these people who have so often shown disdain and mistrust towards you? Especially considering the fact that we do not know for certain whether we will find Thomas Hamilton alive.”
James Flint was going to kill Alfred Hamilton. I knew this without a shadow of a doubt.
A crack, a grunt of pain. I could not see it, as Silver was standing behind me and I dared not turn, lest I provoke the man with the gun pressed to my back. An angry grunt came from what I assumed was James’ direction.
“Why Holmes, that now reminds me—on the evening of the salon at the Hamilton estate, I did not see McGraw leave. At the time I did not think much of it at all, assuming he must have made a quiet exit without bidding any of us goodbye but now your observations do leave me wondering whether he simply spent the night there. If you forgive my crudeness, I would assume that he did so in Lady Hamilton’s bedchamber.” As I spoke, the conclusion I related to Holmes was not one I had full faith in. I had been witness to the conversation between Mary and Lady Hamilton the previous day, and the implications of such were incongruent with my words to Holmes. Yet, stating such doubt was not possible.
This ache paled in comparison to the distress on James’ face. Silver watched him closely, looking for all he was worth like he wanted to provide a measure of comfort yet was unsure how to. James looked as if he was going to set fire to the first man to touch him.
James stared, blankly, at Holmes as he allowed the dagger to fall from his grip, and into that of his interloper.
, we dispatched Jack and Charles there straight away. I am glad we were not too late.”
I looked to James, and the fire behind his eyes transformed into that of an inferno. The rage bubbling up within him was not dissimilar from the very flames we escaped mere hours prior, and I cowered in his light.
“Ah, Watson, thank you for arriving so promptly. I have much to discuss with you in the ways of the Earl of Ashbourne’s case.” Upon entry to the rooms, I found my friend perched upon his chair with an intense look about him; his gaze focused in on me, the thrill of a new day on the job shown in the shimmer in his eyes. I removed my hat and jacket, placing them upon the stand beside the door, before making my way to be seated across from my friend.
“Now, Mrs. Rogers, we had a deal—”
I awoke the following morning at the sound of the eight o’clock bell from a nearby clock tower. James was still nowhere to be seen and he had not spent the night in the room. After dressing and washing, I ventured down to the tavern below in search of breakfast. No familiar faces were present at the tables or bar stools yet, so I located a booth suited for four, and ordered myself an Earl Grey in the interim. The early morning patrons of The Hangman’s Rest were scattered and few in number at this time of morning, presumably a majority of whom were guests at the Inn or locals who lived nearby and were desperate for company. There was one elderly man hunched over a pint glass, half asleep and swaying with his face hidden beneath the brim of his hat. Remembering James’ anxiety, I regarded him carefully but found no cause for concern; he seemed to still be nursing a drink from the night prior.
“An interesting observation, Holmes,” I murmured, watching the older man get up to leave McGraw on his own. “Do I find implication in your words that this is, perhaps, someone aware of McGraw’s work with Lord Hamilton—and even worked to facilitate it? I believe you are correct in your assessment of their relationship, however. Now that I can cast a closer look at the gentleman’s attire, I can confirm that this is the uniform of a Navy Admiral.”
The location in question for this meal was a modest tea room in Central London, and sitting at one of the comfortable booths was none other than my dear wife, Mary.
, anything to give me a clue, I can’t give up now, I can’t leave him—”
. I promise you, I will sit at that fucking station, and if that train does not arrive, I will keep looking. I will leave no stone unturned. I will stay at as many stations as I need to and wait a day, a month, a year, forever, as long as it takes. I made you a promise, when we set off from Georgia. I am not backing down on it.”
As we entered the lavish home, Lady Hamilton welcomed each guest individually, engaging them with an understanding smile and interested conversation. I was beginning to believe that her kindness and empathetic manner of speech was no act—as it was with many other members of the noble classes—but rather her natural state of being. It once again cast doubt upon the image that the Earl had so viciously portrayed of her.
going anywhere, if you think that I am going to just— just leave when—”
“Afraid not,” I admitted. “He left on business last night. I am quite certain he is alright, Miranda. He is a very capable man.”
“What ever are they saying, Holmes?”
“That would be the natural assumption, yes. Although, you know of my unwillingness to theorise without all the facts, Watson. This is little but another piece to the ever growing puzzle before us.”
This did not feel like my outings with Holmes, uncovering clues to a larger case or story. This felt like a vigilante mission with one aspect left entirely certain as the rest were left up to chance:
“Only a problem for their stomachs—and their ears, I’m afraid. I think I told you to drop the fucking accent.” James walked over to our booth and sat himself opposite us. Up close, I confirmed that he did not seem much worse for wear, though I could see the fatigue and exhaustion in his face. He did not take his discerning eyes off Silver as he sequestered Miranda’s fork in hand and bit off a piece of sausage. He then did what all of us seemed to be too polite to do and spat it out across the floor. “Good Lord. What the
“I don’t know about you all, but I could certainly sleep for at least a week.”
James’ breathing quickened, though he clearly made an effort to stay collected as much as he could. “Vane said it is a life akin to slavery. He killed them because he knew this; he has seen it before, I know as much. Would you— is this an assessment you would agree with, Doctor Watson?”
“I’m no clairvoyant, Captain,” Silver attempted to look at the three of us for some more sensical explanation, but James forced his gaze back to him with a rough shake of his shoulders.
my son and destroying my family, Mr. Holmes. I ask that you find… more concrete evidence of her affairs. Prove to Thomas that this woman cannot be given such a loose leash upon the world. My very livelihood may be at stake for it.”
“Perhaps so, but this is no matter. The true work begins at the salon, which we shall be tardy to if we do not descend the steps to the cab waiting for us outside.” With that, Holmes reached for his best top hat and previously discarded jacket before gesturing for Mary and myself to exit.
, I saw James’ silhouette, standing next to the other man in the pair who had come to our aid.
“Quite so, Mr. Holmes. Billy Bones was the one who called me
I nodded towards James, who was close to nodding off where he sat. “It would be a betrayal of my Hippocratic Oath if I did not send this man to get some rest right away. We all have been through quite the ordeal tonight and, speaking for myself and a few of us here, I would be much better equipped to plan a daring rescue mission on a head full of sleep and a belly full of food.”
“Quite right.” I nodded in somewhat solemn agreement at the reminder of how much chance lay in the balance still. All we had left to do was wait, and hope.
“James—” I started, wondering if my efforts may place me in the firing line of his poisoned stare. “Are you certain that he was the one to have done it? Is it possible that someone else could have—”
“My contacts in London are no longer just the street urchins and occasional patrons of the Diogenes Club, Mr. Silver. Working against high society blackmailers requires a delicacy found solely in the more clever criminal classes.” Holmes turned to me, then, for the first time since he began to speak. “Watson, I know I have removed you from much of my work as of late. I hope you understand that it was done out of an effort to protect you from unsavoury eyes, rather than out of disinterest in your assistance.”
She did not need to finish. James was on his feet much faster than I would have presumed possible for a man with his injuries, and out of the door like a shot. I took Mary’s hand to stand and went right after him, my heart beating wildly in my chest.
“I did not think it was possible. That sort of affection—
“I would claim to be surprised by your inability to maintain secrecy in our client’s issue, Watson, but that would be a fool's errand indeed.” He spoke as if he had reached acceptance of the matter hours prior. I could not gather if his words came from frustration, or applause for my efforts. He rose from the cushions in a slow, languid movement before offering his formal greetings to my wife.
James
As I wrote the name and address that so defined the man I wrote to, I thought of the last time I wrote him letters with updates of a case. An old case, from before the Reichenbach Falls or the tragedy of the Hamiltons, when I sent him updates about the mysterious demon hound haunting the Baskerville estate. I had yet to write up the account of such a case, though now it will be known as my return to publishing Holmes’ biographies. Many people wondered why I chose that story above that of Holmes’ return to mark the end of my hiatus. But, I think it may be safe to say that the reminder I felt in this moment was a contributing factor.
I closed my eyes. So many lives and loves at risk today, this week, the week after. All because of the small, fragile hope that a man we all thought dead may still be saved. That we may be able to bring life back to James and Miranda, two people who had lost it long ago.
I opened my eyes to see the somewhat silhouetted face of none other than Sherlock Holmes, hovering above me. The room was dark still, yet a faint blue hue spread across the room we now shared.
“Yes.”
better cook than I. But—that leaves us plenty of time for me to regale you with some of my stories of the Captain’s transatlantic adventures! Now, has he ever told you about the time he stole a Spanish ship? Well, I was there, see—”
We were met at the door with a warmth and splendour that we had by now learned to associate with the Hamiltons. Thomas’ smile was bright and charming and his deep eyes reflected the shine from Lady Hamilton’s spectacular jewellery. She greeted us with enthusiasm, as well and insisted that we call her by her Christian name as well. The habit fell easily upon our lips, for
“It is at the end of a dirt road on the outskirts of the city, and should be marked with a sign labeling it as
The man Lord Hamilton was talking to seemed enthralled with his words and, I would wager, had promptly forgotten why he had decided to counter him in the first place. This, I surmised, was perhaps something rather common in the act of disagreeing with the man. Lord Hamilton smiled with grace and looked at our group, aware of our arrival from the very moment we had walked into his parlour. The smile did not leave his face.
Silver steadfastly ignored James’ words; I had the feeling he was used to doing so. “I am going to assume that you haven’t told your lovely companions about me,” Silver grinned. “For shame, Captain! And here I thought we were friends.”
It was then that I realised just how frequent that same look had passed over him in my presence. Whether it was almost twenty years ago, as he regaled me with his most astute observations of the Jefferson Hope case; that sparkle of pride and excitement. Or, if it was in the moments before he turned his revolver upon the man who had dared put me in harm's way upon the train just days prior. Perhaps, it was found more often in moments I did not see. In the times I looked upon the result of a case he so astutely solved, and he admired my thrill from afar. How many times had this look upon his face gone unseen? How many times had it been seen, but dismissed as nothing but a fanciful expression from an eccentric man I adored above all others? How long had these glances meant what I dared to interpret them to mean now, before two men who loved so free of the shackles of shame?
A concern lined the face of my caring wife, and her grip upon my arm tightened. She stole me away onto a secluded bench within the park, and turned to face me.
“I cannot thank you enough for your gracious hospitality tonight, Thomas,” I began in earnest. “I am well aware that our social life has been somewhat lacking in the months since Holmes’ return, and I know that this has been taxing on Mary. She has enjoyed herself immensely tonight; as have I.”
The authority that Madi Scott held over her men was truly astounding. It was as if she did not need to speak at all to communicate her orders to them—all she did was nod in their direction and they set about to help the other woman free Vane and Rackham from their restraints and to clear up the bodies of our attackers without arousing suspicion to the neighbours of the inn. Mary and Miranda, having seen the danger had passed, finally emerged from their hiding space. Miranda instantly made a beeline for James.
“Quite right, my friend,” Holmes replied without looking back at Jack. “Here to inform Mr. Flint of some rather delicate information he may wish to know.”
“We’ll just stay here, I guess!” Rackham bellowed behind us as I nodded towards the stairwell. Holmes started forward, not turning around to meet my eyes. James and Silver went in front of me and I heard their conversation clearly.
His mention of this sent me back to the events of the previous morning, which felt infinitely further back in my memory than was sensical. The old man who sat alone, nursing a drink from the night before, looking disheveled and unkempt, was none other than my dear friend. It reminded me of a similar encounter I had with the man more than half a decade prior, when I thought him dead. He had dressed himself as an elderly bookstore owner, only to reveal his true identity to me within the privacy of my practise. The similarity did not go unnoticed in me, nor did the fact that much of our reunion on this night felt as though our friendship was coming back to life yet again. This time, with much more immediate danger.
While Perry’s prosecution of robbery and libel was a strong one, Viscount Henderson’s counsel appeared invested in proving his innocence. Named accusations included that of sodomy and gross indecency in violation of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885
Another voice joined with the first one, a gruff, low tone, that scraped like gravel into my ears. That was the voice of a man who did not waste time, and was not about to start now. “Flint, you stupid motherfucker, if you don’t come out
He averted the gaze of Holmes and I for a moment, contemplating his decision.
“Lady Miranda Hamilton," she said in a pleasant, clear voice. "It is a pleasure to meet you Dr. Watson.”
“I cannot say I am, Holmes. What is it that you are planning?”
“Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me—” he could not manage to finish the thought, so Holmes did it for him.
“Well, for starters, anyone standing in this tavern,” an all too familiar voice—quite definitely not that of John Silver—spoke over the top of the existing feud, and froze me in my tracks. It was a voice I would recognise on my deathbed.
Supper itself was nothing short of spectacular. Lord and Lady Hamilton’s cook had gone above and beyond any expectations that we may have had of the affair. Mary and I found ourselves enthralled by both the delicious meal, the beautiful ambience of the dining room and the easy conversation with Thomas and Miranda. It was clear that they entertained often and did so not out of obligation but with a gusto and enjoyment that was entirely singular to them. Spurred on by the recent developments in my case with Holmes, the eye I cast upon our hosts was a deductive one as much as it was a courteous one. I may have felt more guilty about this, was I not convinced that the Hamiltons’ safety—particularly that of Thomas—hinged on the successful conclusion of this mystery.
“My, Watson, you quite nearly caught yourself in the lion’s den,” Holmes murmured to my right, as if using my figure as a cover to hide behind, despite being taller in stature.
“They— It is a practise of surgery performed on the brain. Frowned upon in many civilised institutions as it is considered to be unnecessarily cruel. I would—I would assume that, whatever place these men came from, the doctors there had no such scruples.”
“This is no life. It is not.” He looked around and met James’ eyes, who was watching the exchange quietly, still holding on to Silver to stay upright. “It is slavery of the most insidiuous kind. Men held prisoner in their own bodies. I will not allow it. Not again.”
“I felt it necessary,” Holmes began, stepping back from me, “to speak with you about some of the details of this plan. One detail in specific, in fact.”
“And—what joy, indeed! For we have a real-life biographer in our midst tonight.” Several heads turned our way as Lord Hamilton rose to his feet and reached for Holmes’ hand in a firm handshake. McGraw stayed seated, however his sharp, discerning gaze remained fixed on us. “Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, I cannot express just how flattered I am to make your acquaintance. And of course, the lovely Mrs. Watson. Miranda has spoken of you so very often.” The Lord’s blue eyes returned on me, bright with fire or wine, I could not tell. I accepted the obligatory gesture in kind before he continued to speak. “I was saying, Doctor Watson, that biographical writing is rarely just an expression of one’s ego but—one does hope—has rather loftier goals. Would you not agree?” A playful look came over the Lord’s face and the corner of his mouth curved into a knowing smile. “For I doubt, in all sincerity, that you publish your rather excellent stories in The Strand under the sole pretense of waxing poetic about your esteemed colleague’s intelligence and skill. But, do correct me if I am mistaken.”
Despite our disguises, I could tell that he had recognised us; for I could see a torrent of emotion sweep over his face. I do not know if what I could see was shame—that we had gotten to see him in this state—or fury—that we were intruding into such personal business in the first place. After breaking his eyes away from us, McGraw became scrupulous. He bade a hasty farewell to his Admiral—leaving him confounded—as he pulled his coat on and left the Red Lion with determination in his step.
“So you are saying that, had I been in your position of knowledge and power, I would have betrayed James and risked his life for my own comfort?” Thomas raises an eyebrow. “Is that what you are telling me, Mr. Holmes?”
I sealed the letter in one of the several envelopes I brought in my bags, and addressed it as appropriate:
and with that, this marks the end of act one of Sherlock Holmes and the Lord in Disgrace! starting tomorrow, we will be posting 14 intermission chapters over the next 14 days (one chapter a day! exciting!). after that, we will be posting act two! i hope you're enjoying this fic, and please leave comments if so!
money?” Vane looks at the man who has a gun trained on him and the intensity of that gaze makes the man take a step back. “Why don’t you get on with it, motherfucker?”
“No, I suppose it isn’t.”
James ran his hands over his face for what must have been the hundredth time that night. Agony lined his every feature, just as much as exhaustion and rage did, and I thought back to the request Miranda made of me that afternoon. Could she find it in herself to forgive me for what I so failed to do?
“There is something beneath the surface of this case, Watson. Something I cannot place. It is unclear quite how sinister the layers may be.”
“I will get to this too, bear with. I solved the case regarding young Abigail Ashe—she was abducted by a scorned opponent of the Lord’s by the name of Low— and she was returned to safety. Afterwards, I dedicated the following months to studying Lord Ashe. With my many underground contacts around London, I obtained a correspondence between him and Lord Ashbourne from May of 1894, just before Lord Ashbourne came to employ my aid on proving his daughter-in-law’s infidelity.”
She did not seem comforted or reassured by my words, as her hands kept twitching nervously on the table.
“Why, of course! John, you must come. Lord Hamilton is a font of modern thought, much like Holmes,” Mary implored, looking back to me. The previous sentence from her lips held a weight to it, meant for my ears alone to comprehend. In another circumstance, I may have been more intrigued with the implication, but all my mind could manage was to think of Holmes. What he must be doing to obtain this invitation, what persona he may have adorned to do so. Was I to attend this salon as a friend, or as an outsider? At the moment, I was unsure which of the two was superior.
“How were you aware of my intent to leave Baker Street?”
But Thomas kept observing me with that gentle intensity, with that private, careful smile, and I knew that he had made a—not incorrect—assumption about me, an assumption that would leave many unsaid things between us. Once again, my thoughts drifted back to Holmes, what he had said of the love letter we were set on investigating—
His reassurance was brief, but a warm flush washed over me all the same. All these years, I had assumed the worst. That I had made myself too unsavoury of company myself, and that Holmes could not stand to tolerate it any longer. Despite the stress of the evening, a relaxing feeling came upon me that I had not felt in what I may have labelled an eternity. It did not answer all my questions, but it was enough.
With my legs trembling, I approached the cages, hoping to see the men’s faces. It struck me then that they were all dark-haired. None of them were Thomas.
A faint sob wretched from Holmes’ throat at that, and it was only then that I noticed the wetness upon my own cheeks. There was a deep exhaustion weighing on my bones, and I wanted nothing more than to take the man next to me into my arms and never release him.
I did not hear the end of this baffling sentence because, suddenly, the world around us exploded in a ball of flame and with it a big, horrible sound that left my ears screaming.
“I suppose you are, yes. I was told to expect any niceties to be abandoned for succinctness, but I suppose words only do so much,” the Earl’s discomfort toward my companion was palpable within the room, and this time I could do little to suppress the urge to quell it.
A sudden nervousness came over me as I rose from my seat abruptly and approached the fireplace. Heat was rising up in my face. “I do not see myself as being in Holmes’ shadow. He is my friend and collaborator,” I commented, focusing on entirely the wrong part of Thomas’ sentence.
“Excellent! In the interim, we have little to do but study the lives of those we have been recently acquainted with.”
The Admiral who was conversing with McGraw just before had stepped in, and ordered all his officers out of the establishment. McGraw himself was still trying to catch his breath as I saw the older man say something to him in a hush, though I could not hear what. Holmes, on the contrary, seemed perturbed by what he had seen of the conversation. I could not quite read the look on my friend’s face, but I could tell that whatever he heard, it unsettled him to his core.
Another officer from the group attempted to go at McGraw from the back, yet McGraw was quicker—he blocked the attack and grabbed the man’s collar, smashing his face into the bar with considerable strength that I would not have guessed he possessed from his form. I stood up then to go to them—for what reason, I could not fathom in a logical sense so much as an emotional one. It seemed completely unfair that two people should go against one, even if the Lieutenant was more than capable of taking on more of them if needed. However, before any advancement in my thought was possible, Holmes’ hand on my arm aborted my movement.
“Do you have any inclinations as to who the James in this letter may be, Lord Ashbourne?” Holmes asked in a far gentler tone to the one used before.
McGraw appeared to quicken his step in that moment, and Holmes clutched my hand in his as we rushed to follow him. I imagined the intimate gesture was no more than a byproduct of his excitement at the thrill of the game we were playing with our target, and promptly ignored the fluttering within my chest.
“Who else was I going to suspect to have sold us out?”
Holmes acknowledged his reaction and turned to myself and Silver. “You see, gentlemen, I am not a forgetful man. My work resides solely in the details, and the gold plated hands of this clock and the sound of its bell rang ever so familiar in my mind. I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that I had seen this clock before, and that it had been somewhere of importance. After a moment of rumination, I remembered. I had seen it five years prior, in the parlour of a house in Palace Street, where I attended a rather memorable salon hosted by Lord Thomas Hamilton.”
“Is there a more… private location we can take this conversation to? I suspect that, considering his injuries, Mr. Flint’s energy is unlikely to last all evening without somewhere to sit.”
The meaning behind his words shook me into a revelation of the most grand scale. I felt something burning deep within my chest as I turned around and raised my eyes to meet Thomas’. He smiled and moved so he was slightly further away from me and leaned against the fireplace, one hand braced on the mantelpiece. The firelight danced along his pale skin and his golden hair, making him appear close to angelic.
“Of course! I was about to deliver a letter to the post office if you wish to accompany me,” I offered, welcoming her into the room while I fetched my coat and boots.
“Captain. Flint. Listen to me.” Silver grabbed James by the shirt and forced their eyes to meet. “I
“Vane, Rackham, and Bonny have their own plans upon the success of the heist, yes? After all, they were never there for Thomas to begin with, their goals lay in undermining Richard Guthrie. But, Silver will be coming here. I wonder, I suppose, why that is? He has a wife to return to, does he not?”
A contemplative look fell upon Mary’s face, as if planning one of her clever schemes she so often employed.
“You said that all the Lords had rejected Thomas’ plan, Captain. That at the time you all felt that Lord Ashe was the only choice you had to go forward.”
Steadfastly ignoring James, Silver met my eyes. “Doctor, you need to get him out of there. You need to get him on a horse, get him to Marilès, and make sure he doesn’t fucking die on the way.”
“Tonight, you say? And what time might be best that we arrive?” I turned to meet Lady Hamilton’s gaze as I accepted her invitation, and she beamed in return.
“I am rather afraid I do, Mr. Flint. It appeared that Lord Ashe had come into possession of the old clock belonging to Lord Hamilton and his wife. Now, if your report of his trustworthiness from years ago was correct, why would he have acquired the condemned belongings of an old, imprisoned friend? Would he have bought it at an auction? Surely, that is not something you would expect a trusted friend to do, would it?
Mary and I reached Baker Street minutes before the time Holmes requested, to find the man himself lounged upon the sofa, eyes glued to his rather unspectacular ceiling. As we entered the parlour, Holmes did not change his positioning to greet or otherwise indicate to us his awareness of our presence.
“I have a question, Holmes,” I said after a moment. I had realised that there was still a piece of information missing from this unfortunate tale.
Silver nodded and stepped back. I met Holmes’ eyes, suddenly struck by the thought that this may be the last time I may ever see him. The thought lodged deep in my throat, unpleasant and burning like a piece of coal.
“My dearest Thomas is otherwise engaged today, involved in the planning of his next political venture.” There was something knowing and shrewd about Lady Hamilton’s smile, though I could not fathom what lay hidden behind it. “He does send his well wishes, of course, Mary.”
Even though I could not see his face, I could tell Jack was smug. “We will have to take the long way around, lest we be caught by Glasgow bobbies in the dead of night on horseback.” The lilt I had first noticed in his voice sounded again—I imagined it was natural to his way of speaking. “Apologies for the lack of detailed introductions, Doctor Watson, but I think we may need to find a roof over our heads and a stiff drink before we exchange niceties and personal histories, don’t you?”
“The gentleman was congratulating Lieutenant McGraw on his appointment as a liaison to the Hamiltons,” Holmes replied, speaking quietly and only barely moving his mouth. “Though I would assume his congratulations were not sincere in their entirety. He mentioned something about the ‘son of a carpenter’s mate’, which I assume refers to McGraw’s background. So you were correct, Watson—there is indeed some tension there.” Holmes hummed under his breath and knitted his eyebrows. “Oh, he has moved—I have a less clear view to his lips now—but from what I can tell, the gentleman is taunting the Lieutenant. Mark my words, Watson, I feel that this will not end well.”
“The Captain will be taking care of your breakfast, so you are in good hands,” Silver explained at our puzzled looks. “He is, I loathe to admit, a
“James,” she half-sobbed, half-whispered. “They—”
“It’s my pleasure, my dear. Thankfully, Holmes is out for the afternoon in search for information on our most recent case.” I arranged myself at the booth as Mary gestured to the attention of waitstaff, fetching me a late morning brandy.
“What information is that?” Eleanor asked, turning to look at him now. Whilst I had no clear idea of the nature of their relationship prior to today, the betrayal appeared to cut deep into James’ heart. He appeared willing to do anything in his power to end this with as little disaster possible and he did not wish to do harm to Mrs. Rogers, despite the fact that she still had a gun turned on him.
, Max,” Jack Rackham half-heartedly complained, his head lolling against the back of his chair with exhaustion.
The term of endearment stood out to me in that sentence more than it had in the past. I was unsure how long it had been since last I heard it, and I longed for a distant time when hearing such words was nothing short of normalcy. I reached to his arm, then, and gave him a reassuring shake.
“I… I thought your heart belonged elsewhere. I did not think that I—”
“Charles, if you don’t shut your fucking mouth, I swear I will do it for you,” Eleanor threatened.
“I understand.” James rose to his feet and shrugged his shirt on, with obvious effort. “And you do not need to say anything. I have said what I wanted to say and that is the end of it. I think you need to tend to your leg—and we both need to rest, before we see what the rest of the night brings us.”
“Perhaps not, no,” she beamed. “I have made a new friend, you see, during my visit to the Harringtons’ newest art exhibition last week. She is positively brilliant, John, easily the most fascinating woman I have ever met. I can’t wait for you to meet her!”
Mary caught sight of Sherlock and I first, and she sent a wave with a knowing glance our way. I sent back a kind wave, and as if to confirm her suspicion, Sherlock took my free hand in his and offered a greeting in return just seconds after me. Mary’s grin transformed into a beaming smile, and she turned to Miranda to whisper something before the both of them turned back to acknowledge us in silence. As I peered past them and back to the furthest cottage, the sun beginning to peek through the clouds just ahead, something curious caught my eye.
“I would not call him a
“I resent the implication, Captain! I was telling a few stories to my new friends, that is all,” Silver replied, a false sense of scandal lining his words as he placed a hand upon his chest. “At least, I hope I was not taking too much of a hold upon our conversation. Meeting new people has always been quite exciting.”
“Beg pardon?”
Mary squeezed my shoulders and pulled back to meet my eyes. “You deserve just as much,” she said, her voice careful and kind. The implication behind her words stung my heart, but I could not let myself ruminate on it, not now of all times. Mary took a deep breath. “Do you think you will find him, John? Thomas, I mean. Do you truly believe he may be alive?”
“You gave me every assurance that this would
Sherlock studies her knowing smirk and narrows his eyes as the ring of his phone finally reaches his ears and the doors to the strategy wing in his mind palace close. He pulls it from his pocket and sees the name Greg Lestrade, general manager of the team in bright digital lettering. He turns and looks back at the ladies.
He pauses a moment and mirrors Sherlock’s warm smile. Maybe it is the wine he drank earlier, although he did not have nearly enough for this, but Sherlock feels pliant and cozy. The soft oranges and yellows from the lamp lights in the room make the deep red of John’s shirt look even softer. The corners of Sherlock’s mouth curl further and he allows his middle finger to just barely graze John’s elbow.
Sherlock sighs, places his hands on John’s shoulders, and rolls them onto their sides. He looks into his flatmate’s deep blue eyes and tries to rid his own of the anger he feels. He is not angry with John and does not want him to mistakenly believe it so. He is, however, furious with the situation. He cannot allow Moriarty to disrupt their lives any further, but he cannot lie to John about the man’s motives. He must tell him what he has deduced, even if it may only cause John more concern.
“The one with the husband in the tacky suit?” John inquired and cringed. “He must glow in the dark when the blacklights are on.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There it is. His intuition laid out on the table with no basis in logic, just a notion that something is off. He expects John to scoff, tell him he is a weak-minded fool and walk away.
“You come here often,” Sherlock stated, his eyes sharp. Goddamn if he did not have the longest lashes John had ever seen.
“No. They’re waiting until he wakes up to allow visitors.”
John closes his eyes abruptly, struck by a sudden wave of memory that pulls him under. A pane of glass shatters and he sees himself in a lab at Bart’s. The man from the park, Mike Stamford stands close by as John passes his mobile to Sherlock. For just the smallest of seconds, their fingers brush and electricity tingles through John’s whole body. And those words, smooth and silky in that beautiful baritone that has secretly tickled John’s spine ever since.
He eyes John with concern when the doctor does not answer in favor of staring down at his own hands. Sherlock nudges him with a shoulder.
“It’s an accelerant. A coat won’t work.”
I know, I know. All the murder attempts are pretty soap opera-ish, but it's all going somewhere, I promise. And, hey... KISSING, FEELS!
“Yeah? Well, you could’ve told me. Given me a little warning maybe,” John ‘s voice is rising in volume even as his mind says
Sharp grey eyes study the five skaters as they race around the track. Wheels glide smoothly over concrete, one leg crossing over the other on the straight aways, knees bent to keep low around the turns. Bodies bent slightly at the waist and spines arched with shoulders back in perfect derby stance. They make each pass with ease and undeniable focus. Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody plays loudly from a portable speaker laying in the center of the track. A short woman off skates stands next to it with a timer, shouting out every minute as each one ticks away. The only other sounds that interrupt Freddie’s voice are the occasional cries of 5, 10, 15, as well as shouts of encouragement from the stationary skaters positioned around the inside of the track as they count their teammate’s laps.
“What kind of attack?” Greg interrupts, directing the question to John, but Sherlock continues speaking right over the GM.
Oooooo, smut.
But I can’t help falling in love with you
The words rang out in the air around John and he increased his pace until he was running for the door. He burst through it and stopped in the middle of the pavement, looking right and left almost frantically. He was not there. Sherlock was nowhere to be found. It was dark even with the streetlamps, but the tall man should have been visible. John looked both ways again. There was not a single figure on the abandoned streets. There were plenty of cars passing by though. John’s shoulders began to sag as it became clear that Sherlock must have caught a cab. John chewed on his lip in disappointment and stared out into the street. It was too late. He had missed his chance.
Sherlock’s hands found John’s waist and they began to dance in a slow shift. They moved their bodies so one shoulder was forward and then the other. By the third line, they had separated so they could better move to the solid beat and bright trumpet sound, but remained connected by holding one hand or even both.
“Right. Fine, but this isn’t over.”
“John?” a silky baritone called from somewhere close.
“Yeah, but hiding something from you,” John puffs out a breath.
So, our duo has been separated. Sherlock is back home in Detroit and John is still in Baltimore. Remembering the last chapter’s questions, is Sherlock right to be worried about John? Are he and Janine safe? Like I’ve said before, only one way to find out.
“Good, good,” some of the edge fades from Greg’s voice and he eyes the other two as he continues. “Why don’t we all have a seat, shall we? Talk like civilized adults. I’m sure Sherlock wants to know more about Dr. Watson as much as I do, if he can behave himself.”
Shit goes sideways.
4) Might Moriarty make a personal visit to see what's holding John up?
“Hey, Bossman,” a man named Roland called from down the bar. Greg and John looked his way immediately to see a bottle in each of his hands and people crowding the opposite side of the bar. “Give us a hand, mate.”
Sherlock just cocked a brow, his expression screaming ‘Come now, John, don’t be dull’. A smile broke over John’s lips and he tucked his chin down with a quiet self-deprecating laugh. When he looked up again, Sherlock’s amusement was easily apparent and he had taken a step closer.
“I enjoy the thrill and suspense.”
The car ride to Angelo’s is comfortable and has Sherlock feeling as though he has known John for much longer than he actually has. There is no insipid small-talk, only easy silence interrupted by Sherlock’s directions and occasional tidbits about the neighborhoods they pass through. He does tell John that Angelo is an old friend and that they met almost as soon as Sherlock moved back to Detroit. It has been a long day at the stadium and Sherlock was starving. He had gotten in his car and just started driving. It was late enough that the staff had gone, but Angelo let him in and the two had talked for two hours while Sherlock ate an enormous bowl of pasta.
Since I thought you and me
“And deduce,” Sherlock continues, looking at John with pin-point focus. The doctor’s eyes rise from the wound to meet his disarming silver gaze, steady and true. Sherlock feels warm, color rising into his cheeks and he feels light-headed. The air around them is heavy with promise, and the glimmer on John’s face is peaceful and welcoming. Looking at him, Sherlock is suddenly struck by the feeling that he has found someone who can truly understand him and the way he thinks, the way he sees the world. Molly has seen it too, but can it be? Could John really be what she thinks he could be? It is a concept Sherlock had given up hope of finding after Victor. At least, he thought he had.
John’s eyes go from hard with anger to soft amusement in seconds. A rather unceremonious burst of laughter pops from his lips, now turned up in a smile.
They share a look. It is very serious and intentional. Is it Sherlock’s imagination or is there heat in John’s eyes? He is certainly trying to keep it from his own. His hand is on John’s, holding it gently, though he does not remember putting it there. John’s hand is warm and soft. God, he wants to hold it forever. He wants to learn everything about this man, spend the rest of his life touching and holding and memorizing every inch, every thought, every dream he holds dear. It all comes upon him so suddenly that their one point of contact feels like the key to a secret door, opening and revealing a part of himself he never knew existed. Sherlock has never felt this way in his life. He had loved Victor, to be sure, but did not feel anything even close to this. It is amazing. And...Jesus Christ, he is completely fucked.
John stares for a beat, giving the man the opportunity to defend himself. When he says nothing, John shakes his head and sneers in disgust.
When Sherlock pulls away, he’s quickly off the sofa and walking toward the door. John looks after him in frustration, uncertain how to proceed. Sherlock glides to a stop in the doorway and turns back with a sincere and almost shy look on his face.
“Is there?” he tilts his head. “Please enlighten me.”
Please don't hate me.
“Affair with a colleague,” Sherlock said by way of explanation. “Her husband won’t grow facial hair and she likes the way it feels on her nether regions.”
“But now you think of old Angelo and bring your date to the best restaurant in all of Detroit,” he winks obviously at Sherlock.
“Good for you,” John laughed, placing his drink on the bar. “Keeps you humble.”
Hello, Everyone!
“John, no,” Jim’s hand was on John’s chest and he pressed in as close to in between them as he could. “It’s fine.”
WTF, JANE?? WHAT ABOUT THE WEDDING?!?!
“Now just calm down,” Greg Lestrade rises from the chair behind his desk. His hands are out in a placative gesture and he quickly side steps around the desk to stop in front of the furious man before him. Cold, hard grey eyes burning with fury are trained on him as he moves. If looks could kill he would be flat on the floor. Greg might have considered appealing to John to diffuse the situation, but he is just as angry.
“Yes, of course.”
The feels! Writing the conversation between John and Sherlock in the hospital room nearly killed me, y'all. It made me so sad to think of these two in so much pain. When I read through and edited "Sherlock's lip quivers" just a few minutes ago, mine was doing the same. Oh, my poor boys.
“Thanks for calling us in, Doctor,” she nods. John nods back, looking a little confused. Greg calls loudly from just inside the next room and Sally immediately diverts her course.
There must be more questions, don't ya think?
Sherlock looks around while John checks his watch. The dining room is empty. Sherlock wouldn’t be surprised if Angelo is the only other person there.
So, this is their last sex holiday day. We all know they'll make good use of it. Oh, yes! I'll try to get the next chapter out as soon as I can. I was way ahead with editing, but I've caught up now. Entonces, I have some serious editing to do before I can post anything more. Don't worry, I won't forget all of you, but I have some long nights ahead. Thank you all for your love and support. You make this even more of a joy than it already is and you all mean the world to me.
John makes plans to get himself and Janine home again and has a conversation of his own.
And sex!
“No, no,” Sherlock says quickly, suddenly on his feet and yanking the suit jacket from his chair, “it’s a good stopping point.”
“Yes, definitely,” he replies. “They will not stop until they succeed.”
I hope you all enjoyed chapter 3. I know we didn't see John and you're probably worried about him. Rest assured, he'll be in the next chapter, but I can't say things will be going well. :'(
Until the next chapter, keep your pants dry, your dreams wet, and remember, hugs not drugs.
Yay!! Yay, Jane, you have taken mercy upon us!
“No,” Billy shakes his head. “I can’t believe it of them. Any of them.”
“Right,” Greg drew out the word just enough to convey his disbelief without being an ass about it.
“Right,” an affirmation to continue, not a judgment.
I think I'm going to try and post chapters every few days instead of waiting a whole week. I can't help myself.
“No,” he answers plainly, averting his eyes to the table for a moment. “I retired and moved on. That’s what whoever did it wanted and I’m too old to deal with that shit.”
Always, Jane
“What did she do?”
Staring at the lemonade glass on the table, deep in thought, John does not notice Billy studying him closely. The older man wears a thoughtful expression. He is learning as much from and about John as the doctor is from him.
“Thank you,” John smiles. At moment, as if by magic, a cab stops right next to them. John glances back at her with his hand on the door handle. “Share a cab?”
Sherlock opens his mouth to fly at the GM, but does not say a word. To Greg’s surprise, he merely stands poised for battle and then lets his arms slowly drop to his sides. His shoulders sag ever so slightly as all the fight drains out of him. Greg continues in a kinder tone.
After two hours of work, Sherlock is so engrossed that he doesn’t even hear John approach. He looks up when a shadow other than his own appears on his desk to see John standing before him, hair mussed and bleary-eyed. He is adorable.
If this is a trigger, these two paragraphs can be skipped. The first paragraph begins "You son of a bitch" and the other with "It started as soon as". To help give the signal to skip, I have underlined the first few words in these two paragraphs.
A scrape of metal from the side of the boat catches the villain’s attention. He turns his head to see a hand clasp the side, groping for purchase as its owner climbs up the side of the boat.
The voice rang out sharply over the mass of people eliciting a loud cheer from the crowd. Prom time was over and everyone sprang into action, including Sherlock. Wanting to erase his words and the awkwardness from John’s mind, he raised his arms straight up and moved his lithe body in an obscene wave timed perfectly with the rhythm. He threw his head back at the next “Yeah” and when his gaze fell on John again, it was searing. John stood watching in shock. He could not comprehend the sudden change in Sherlock’s demeanor. As John struggled through the confusion and lingering awkwardness, he opened his mouth to speak, but was rendered speechless when Sherlock took a step closer. He lowered his arms, fingers skimming along his body as they went and resting on his own undulating hips. He turned his back to John, looking over his shoulder with those smoldering eyes, swinging and rocking his lush ass. He was just close enough to barely bump into John’s groin, filling him with a teasing pleasure.
That said, happy reading and I hope to see you all back again soon!
She begins slowly sliding his hand upward, but he immediately pulls it away and takes the barest of steps back before bumping into his own desk.
“Sherlock?” John whispers, bringing the man back to himself. John looks worried, his pupils already shrinking. “Are you okay?”
John’s eyes go wide and his lips part in shock. It only lasts a second before the doctor schools his expression, looks at his hip and then back at Sherlock.
“Are you?” John replied with barely concealed annoyance.
John’s brows raise as he blinks in disbelief. He leans back on the couch for the first time since he sat. He turns everything around and around in his mind, trying to put it all together in a way that makes sense. Who would target the Rock City players and their doctor, especially their doctor? Another team? Why? The answer is obvious. To be on top. To win the championship. But why Billy? Why not Sherlock? He rebuilt the team from the ground up.
“God.” Sherlock's eyes roll back.
“It could be us,” Sherlock blurted suddenly. John half wondered if the man knew he had said it out loud, but his wide eyes and scarlet cheeks told John he did. “I could be yours, if you would be mine.”
p.p.s. SHERLY!!! I can't wait to read your message on this one. Your swears are the best!
Will Sherlock find him? Will Sherlock even start looking for him??
Someone fired shots at John.
There was no fade out. One song moved seamless and fluidly into the next. This one took them into a heavier beat and a more forceful step. The drums and velveteen rough voice brought the floor into a darker place and the lights went down to match it. As if reading John’s mind, Sherlock stepped closer to him almost as soon as the song began. He lip-synced the words and drifted around John where he danced. The mysterious and sultry look on Sherlock’s face pulled John’s eyes in as he moved. As the first verse neared its end, Sherlock’s fingers scraped across John’s chest and lingered as they slid around to his back. The doctor’s skin tingled along the trail of Sherlock’s hands, the touch powerful in spite of the fabric between them. John’s mind jumped in his skull to thoughts he never would have anticipated when he walked into the club: God, to feel Sherlock’s skin on his. Nothing between them, no clothes, no air, no space. It would be electric. John swallowed back a groan as he continued to watch those silver-green eyes take in his every movement. Shit, the man could probably read his mind.
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
“It will come, John. It will all come back to you,” Sherlock smiles warmly.
“I will put a bullet in your brain before you touch John!” Sherlock snarls.
Did he really just say that? Sherlock nearly rolls his eyes in sheer embarrassment. Instead, he shakes his head minutely and then tries to adopt a more professional air, picking up the open bottle of peroxide. Placing the gauze on its top, Sherlock tips the bottle and saturates the gauze.
“Thank you.”
“Yes, well, short of drugging me every evening, which I think you’ll agree is also unhealthy…” his voice trails away as a tucked-away tidbit emerges from his mind palace. The first time he’d invited John into his room and they’d kissed, kissed intensely…he hadn’t thought of a thing. Not a damn thing. Aside from John, of course, and how much he’d like to shag him into the mattress and taste every inch of his body. Sherlock quickly shakes his head to dispel that line of thought before John can feel a certain hardness against his thigh. He frowns when his cock twitches beneath his pants and pajamas, and hopes John didn't notice.
“As a matter of fact,” Sherlock gives him a smartass grin, brows still raised. He places the gauze he is holding back on John’s hip, fingertips grazing the soft skin, and then reaches for John’s hand. He places it gingerly on the gauze. “If you would be so kind.”
“Sherlock,” he takes a step and rests his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders, shaking his head. “This along with coaching and everything else you have on your plate? No. Besides, it’s too risky. We’ve both seen how dangerous this is. I have the bandages to prove it.”
Quads - roller skates with four wheels.
“I hope you know, John, that this is not going to be one-sided,” Sherlock told him sternly, ignoring the question. “I want to know everything about your cases as well.”
Whew. Okay, that was a bit excessive. I'm like a woman possessed. Am I wearing a skin-tight black and red leather suit right now, living out my Deadpool dream? (uh, no)
Take my whole life too
I never thought I’d lay me heart on the line, but everything about you is tellin’ me this time
“I am well aware of that. Thank you,” Sherlock answers haughtily. “What do you know about him?”
“Angelo has won more awards locally and nation-wide than any other.”
“It wasn’t a whim, dear. John Watson is a good and honorable man, and an excellent doctor,” Mrs. Hudson answers, smile never faltering.
“I do respeck them!” she says loudly and defensively. “Uncle Greg wants me to call him that. He likes to play with me.”
Sherlock lurches at Greg and stops inches from him. Looking down at the GM, eyes still blazing, he paints a frightening picture. In spite of it, Greg stands his ground and looks directly in the face of the taller man.
They stare at one another, their words hanging between them, like a thick smog that leaves no room to breathe. John is no idiot. He gets what Sherlock is saying, but his past was the last thing he had wanted to talk about, especially after such a fucking spectacular night. Still there was no way around it. John had been angry while telling the story, but it had soon faded, leaving him exposed and frustrated. He had wanted only to leave as fast as he could before Sherlock had a chance to properly judge his actions and throw him out. He hadn’t meant to cast any sort of judgment upon Sherlock or make him feel he was being rejected. Christ, he is such a dick.
