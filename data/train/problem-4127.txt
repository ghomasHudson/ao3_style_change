Before they knew it, young Sonia Ivanovna was upon them, her pretty face drawn in suspicion and scrutiny.
“Winchesters." The lanky angel greeted dully, “My name is Harut. I apologize for startling you.  It’s been some time since I have interacted with humans, I forget your senses are--”
“What does that mean?” Evan piped up, seeming to find his voice once again. “Are you family or something?”
“I’m not sure.” Cas replied, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides, “Harut indicated that I should ‘steel myself’ before he led me to examine the sigil, but neither of them gave any other indication before or after that.”
Dean met his brother's eyes briefly before quickly glancing away. He thought he might have some idea what it was but...
For his part, Castiel set about cleaning up the kitchen, giving Dean privacy to eat in peace, but despite eating with his head down he kept sharp eyes glued on the angel’s back as he moved around the space behind the bar. He looked on as he performed the mundane tasks of rinsing and washing the pans and utensils before hand drying them and tucking them into their respective places. It was so simply domestic it almost felt like a morning off in the bunker. Dean refocused on his plate, pushing that idea out of his as the angel took up a wet rag and wiped down the stovetop and counter.
Despite the small victory, Dean couldn’t quash the dread that was needling between his ribs. He had been a hunter his whole damn life. He’d been to hell and back. He’d been shot, stabbed, shredded and tortured by creatures centuries, hell millennia, old. But this thing…this thing was bigger and badder and older than any demon or monster they had faced before. He wasn’t sure exactly how he knew this but every alarm bell in his head was going off and the closer they got to Faith, the more his stomach twisted into knots and his instincts screamed at him in warning. His dad would have called it hunter’s intuition.
to lie. No one had ever put the question to him so simply; it was almost a relief to finally say it aloud. “I do.”
“I’m fine.” He answered in a rush without looking at the angel. “What about you Samantha, how are you doing?”
“Experiments?!” Dean spat the word like it left a bad taste in his mouth. He was no fan of angels outside of Cas, but experiments on prisoners like lab rats were low even for the average heavenly douche bag.
“You took less time than I was anticipating.” He said easily, straightening up on one knee and half turning with an oil splotched towel in hand, whipping the worst of the dark tinted grease from his hands as he stood to give the hunter his full attention.
The angel remained silent for a beat before stepping forward, gesturing to the hunter’s plate. “You’ve stopped eating.”
“Not necessarily,” Sam countered, “We know that this monster is biological. We talked about this earlier Cas. Biological means it had to have originated somewhere on the third and fourth-dimensional plain...” The younger hunter took a moment to flip back through his notes before speaking again. “And according to Hannah, angels disappearing without a trace like this has happened before but not since before Michael gave the no-go order almost over 2000 years ago, and definitely not in numbers like this”
Cas had eased Dean’s nightmares many times over the years, mostly without the hunter being any the wiser. He let himself believe it was for Dean’s own sake; that he eased what suffering he could for his best friend, but the truth was far more selfish. He went to Dean’s side and observed him for a moment. Dean made another agitated noise but the words were indecipherable. The feeling of unease returned stronger there than it had been in the hall.
Someone else had taken the photo, probably Sam if the exasperated look on Dean’s face was an indication. The expression was one he’d worn many times, typically when his little brother was being a sappy dork, but the man in the photo wasn’t
“The bells too.” Dean interjected airily, “The bells felt like fingers on my--” He stopped short, his jaw audibly clicking shut before he could say
“WHERE?!” His attacker roared, pulling the terrified human off the wall only to slam him back hard enough to crack the brick.
That impending tightness in his lower stomach signaled his orgasm was fast approaching. The obscene wet slap of his skin made his ears and face burn with a shame that didn’t stop the low groan from escaping him when he finally crested, his cock pulsing in his own hand as ropes of cum coated his fingers and dripped onto the tile below to be washed away.
The sound of clattering flatware snapped Dean out of his stunned appraisal. Instantly back on high alert, Dean cast his gaze around for anything that could be potentially used to defend himself until his eyes fell on a simple, sleek candle holder situated on a small side table near the mouth of the stairs to the left. He tip-toed over to it, and breathed a calming sigh of relief when he grasped it’s solid weight in his fist.
Sam’s entire posture shifted as his brother’s words trailed off. With the barrage of events and information, he hadn’t even considered the possibility of Cas being in danger. With a sidelong glance, he carefully watched his brother’s expression and the genuine concern he saw there eased some of the heat out of his temper. Despite the obvious influence the Mark had had in that outburst in Hannah’s office, Sam felt more at ease knowing his brother’s heart had been in the right place.
Dean blinked rapidly as he looked around the room, feeling completely shaken and disoriented. He could finally see again but when his eyes fell on his brother his face was still a blurry smear.
“Take it.” The angel prompted with a nod, his expression infuriatingly sincere. “You always think more clearly with a weapon in your hand.”
Castiel closed his eyes and swallowed hard against the emotion welling up in his throat, willing himself to ignore it.
He’d been watching the angel long enough to know how he held himself and how he moved, could recognize it easily, even at a distance, and this guy moved like Cas with an accuracy that bordered on eery. Deciding that his desire to see Cas was getting crossed with his exhaustion and making him see things, Dean leaned back in his chair with a disgruntled grumble.
“Vic is all bone fragments and loose meat.” Sam replied warily, “Blue face, swollen tongue, and bloody eyes definitely points to strangulation, but Cas there’s...” Sam glanced at Evan and Gretchen, seeing that they were distracted in tense conversation, before finishing, “...there was a hand print burned into his throat.”
The rest of the day had been spent in and out of Evan’s small apartment, making calls and researching ways around angelic warding. Sam had the idea of using the map tracking spell Ruby had shown him all those years ago, but it proved only to narrow down Cas’s vague location to somewhere within the center of the 8400 square miles of the Black Hills National forest.
Wyoming was beautiful this time of year and the sun was at its peak in the cornflower blue sky over this week's shanty motel abode. Having just returned from a food run, Dean killed the engine and spared himself a few moments to soak up the warmth. It was the type of sunshine that made him want to toss a blanket out in the grass and stretch out for a nap.
Sam visibly tensed at the description; an image of Lucifer immediately jumping to mind. He pressed a thumb into the center of his scarred hand where it rested in his lap out of habit. If the Sheriff noticed his sudden withdrawal, he didn’t mention it. Instead he continued his summary.
The ache of the angel’s absence was more acute here than it had been in the closet, heightened in a way he hadn’t been expecting. He felt warm, almost feverish with it, and he had to catch himself against the counter as he suddenly swayed and stumbled.
A chill passed over him,  a deep sense of foreboding flooding his senses as the angel’s haunting words rang loud in his ears.
Sam looked to Evan then only to find the young officer’s face more set and authoritative than he had seen since meeting him. Without acknowledging the hunter’s bewildered expression, he puffed out his chest and knocked sharply on the plexiglass divider, "Gretchen! I’m here with Agent Scholtz for the Hishov case.”
Cas inhaled sharply, his eyes flickering away before slowly coming back to level the younger Winchester with an expression of open honesty.
The Sheriff shook his head, “Nothing like any storm damage I’ve ever seen. Every lightbulb, monitor screen, and window in the place was completely shattered. All the wiring was
Though he was anxious and a little ashamed, he resigned to the fact that this plan was as good as any. From the fridge he retrieved two beers; unsurprised at this point to discover they were his favorite, and then stood back to admire his work. Then, with a final dash of nutmeg, he cut the sandwich from corner to corner, rinsed the used pan and took the plates and beers in hand, and made his way over to the door ignoring the prickling heat in his palm. Dean took a final grounding breath, using his elbow to press the handle, and then shouldered his way into the garage.
As he reprimanded himself, his eyes were drawn to more movement by the door. The two shadows were moving away. It wasn’t particularly unusual for Cas to be roaming the hallways at this hour, though Dean had been sure the angel would have at least relaxed into a trance or something after the day they’d had. What did strike him as unusual though was how quiet he was.
“I’ve got some general supplies in the trunk. We’ll make up some hex bags to cancel out the basics.” Sam interjected.
A sitting room. A wall full of weapons. A house in the middle of nowhere. A stranger in the kitchen--Dean’s eyes snapped back to the stranger in question, zeroing in on the man who was now perched on the edge of the coffee table across from him.
The angel cried out when those teeth sank into the soft and sensitive skin just beneath the bolt of his jaw. From the angle of his head only the high wooden ceiling above was immediately visible, and with the apparition occupied for the time being, he squeezed his eyes shut without fear of reprimand, allowing himself to sink into the memory of a time when these hands and those lips touched him with tenderness and love instead of cruel lascivity.
the hunter thought sourly. He had definitely reached his quota of feathered dicks scaring the shit out of him for the day.
Possibility number one: He was hallucinating. He had gone through years of being thrown around by demons, angels, and monsters. He’d suffered through the traumas of death and resurrection so many times he was numb to it. He’d been dragged out of hell, tossed out of heaven and clawed his way out of purgatory and now he was finally going off the deep end. The strange sensations and sounds were symptoms of his dwindling sanity finally snapping and Sam would have to toss him in the looney bin by this time next week for being a danger to himself and others...
The moment she was gone, Evan turned wide bewildered eyes on Jack. Not wanting to be privy to more of whatever was going on between all the young people, Sam led Cas over the threshold into the house. They could hear the muffled bell like chatter of Sonia’s voice speaking in fluent Russian to her mother in another room as the hunter meandered into what appeared to be a sitting room on the left off the entryway. Cas drifted in behind him, followed by Evan and Jack.
The silence on the other end of the line was telling in that Sam was sure Cas was thinking the same thing.
“Do they know that?” He asked,  jerking his head at the pair before regarding Cas again, this time his brows drawn down with a look somewhere between suspicion and alarm. “I mean, they didn’t say anything about it and it seems like a pretty damn big piece of information to leave out.”
“Interesting,” Cas muttered, shifting half a step closer, his eyes roaming over the hunter’s body in a purely clinical fashion, though that didn’t stop his skin from heating up where his gaze touched. “There is a perceptual phenomenon that affects less than five percent of your species called synesthesia. Those who experience it report instances of senses becoming crossed, or linked together. For instance, you described
"Holy crap, holy crap, Holy crap!" Charlie yelled, jumping in circles and flapping her hands, "That was a ghost! A real, conscious ghost!"
She handed him an envelope with his name on it- no return address though. "This is for you," she said, "from the other side. Now, if you need me dearie, you'll know what to do."
Dean stopped, "I love you too, buddy. You're the best friend a dude could ask for- but nows not the time."
"Sure, Cas. I'll see what I can do. Why don't you head back home and take a moment to process? This has to be overwhelming." Dean didn't know if he was doing the right thing, but he wanted to try. Cas nodded, and they went their separate ways.
As he sat in the dim light of the TV which had long since been stuck on the DVD menu screen, with his palms pressed against his eyes, he was suddenly assaulted by an overload of sensory input.
Silence flooded the apartment.  Sam’s brows were once again lost in his hairline and he pointedly found something on his monitor incredibly interesting. Sonia was voicing something he had suspected for years, but despite his curiosity it still felt like an invasion to appear too interested in the answer.  Jack on the other hand, peered at the angel in rapt attention.
If this thing could get into Heaven and back to earth in no time at all, did that mean it could get anywhere? He was paralyzed by the idea that Cas could be in danger, even here in the safety of the bunker--No.
Cas inclined his head slightly, drawing his brows together. The corner of his mouth sunk down into a slight scowl. Dean’s anger, as usual, was vibrant and confusing but considering the Mark, the angel refused to allow the harshness of his friend's tone to get under his skin.
“Тишина (Hush).” Sonia tutted sweetly, “If not for your own sake, then allow me to keep my nervous hands busy.”
The shouted words “Dean!” and “Wait!” echoed in the hunter’s ears as he rounded the corner back into the dining room, but he didn’t stop. Realizing belatedly that he’d left the candle holder behind, Dean’s eyes darted wildly around for anything else to use as a weapon. He leaped swiftly through the atrium, thundering into the sitting room before skidding to a halt when he caught sight of the back wall.
The rest of the day was spent in the library save for the occasional break for food or the toilet. Sometime around 9 PM Sam was muttering to himself across the table nearly buried in a pile of red ink etched paper and about a dozen different scrolls all in varying degrees of disrepair when Dean’s phone suddenly began to ring.
"There is, a catch though," Gath said hesitantly, "They want you to treat it like a normal session. Talk to him about you life in the apartments. I'm to sit in and monitor and only interfere if you become volatile again."
So life update: I twisted my ankle, but that's overshadowed by the fact that I'm starting testosterone soon! It only took 6 years after I came out!
He couldn't get through with the pony in the way, Dean turned around to look for an exit or something. A dark wall blocked off the other end, but he spotted a ladder nearby. He didn't really see another way out, so he climbed up into a narrow hallway- there was another ladder that went up and right next to it, there was a large switch with lights above it.
"When a ghost is nearby, this will light up blue- instead of your whole screen lighting up and it should keep your battery usage down. To get the absolute best results fully extend the antenna. You can do that by pressing this button," she pointed to a button on the bottom of one of the handle " You can press it again to get an electrical output and basically force the ghosts to show. Oh, and I played that game in there. It's a simple horror game- the ending is pretty sad, though- everyone dead."
The level opened with Greg on the fifth floor of the Addison apartments surrounded by cultists. "Rowena said I need to cut the power lines on each floor. I hope we can pull this off. "
My upload times will no longer be at midnight, as it's been messing up my sleep schedule, but I will upload on Friday nights. Also, there will be no upload next week, but there will be one the week after. Work got super crazy, and I fell behind, so I’m giving myself time to catch up. Thank you so much for reading and for your patience.
"Hello?" He called out- he'd nearly forgotten about the person crying, but they were still crying fairly hard, Dean couldn’t just ignore it.
It tried talking to him, but he didn't understand. Coming through with poor reception. He told the head so, but it kept trying before it ultimately disappeared. "That was weird," he said to himself. "But then again, so is my life."
"Boy, you better not be getting into trouble now." He greeted Dean. Dean knew better than to sass him, so he stayed quiet. The older man sighed deeply, "What is it now?"
This chapter got super long, so I had to split it. The next chapter will be out on the 15th, though.  Good news though: I will be making the attempt to publish a new chapter every Friday around midnight MST.
He thought about where to go, skipping Mr. Addison- he and Cas had just made him a new sign for his tea and they'd been over almost everyday check on how he was doing. Yesterday, though, he snapped. Telling the boys that he'd get no customers if they were hanging around all day. They gracefully left and told themselves that they'd give him at least a week. Keeping it in mind, Dean instead went to the basement and into Cas's apartment.
On the way to the science lab, Dean spotted a paperclip on the ground and picked it up. Never knew when one might need to pick a lock. He continued to the lab, greeting Cas and Charlie, who were both crowed around the microscope when he arrived.
“That’s how long I've been able to feel you.” The hunter clarified just as quietly, too numb in the face of all of this new information to worry about how vulnerable he sounded. “Since the first time, you tried to speak to me. It was like being struck by lightning...”
“Hey look,  I lacked tact back there for sure, but I meant what I said. Angels are missing and she didn’t think to tell us about the first time it happened right off the bat? And those other two are throwing off some seriously shady vibes too, especially that skinny shark-eyed one. Cas told me they knew what that sigil was written with but they never said anything, they just let him figure it out himself. He almost passed out Sam!”
the demon growled. Once he was sure the angel wouldn’t look away again, he began stroking him with a lazy twist of his fist, causing the angel’s breath to stutter and hiss in an attempt to stifle the desperate touch starved sounds bubbling up from his chest.
The pair squared off for a moment before the young woman seemed to deflate, albeit with some scorn. “Fine.” She replied, “But you will call us when you arrive and when you find your brother.”
For the first time since Dean had seen him, the angel appeared truly uncomfortable, almost fidgeting and looking anywhere but at him. Dean lowered his head, the air between them now solemn and serious. Sure he knew he’d obviously die one day. Hell, he’d died a few times already, but to witness the pain it had clearly caused from this side made him feel guilty despite being alive.
Dark storm clouds crowded over one another in raging waves, bringing with them gusts of wind that made the trees howl and laid flat the surrounding flora. The red neon letters spelling out ‘VACANCY’ and their washed-out reflections on the flooded lot below were the only things clearly visible from the road.
Side stepping how this guy knew that particularly intimate detail about him, Dean leaned cautiously forward before quickly snatching the offered blade. The sharp edge slid out of the offering fingers without resistance. The hunter then darted back to put some distance between them, keeping his eyes on the angel the entire time, just waiting for the other shoe to drop. With a solid, firm grip on the weapon, Dean released a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
The Impala was on track back to the bunker after an overnight salt and burn two states over. It had been a welcome if short-lived reprieve carved out amongst all the crazy shit that had been going down lately.  The sleek car was a streak of glossy ink and polished chrome as it breezed down the empty highway. With just over an hour left before they hit Lebanon’s city limits, Dean tapped his thumb leisurely against the steering wheel to the quiet beat on the radio while Sam dozed in the passenger seat.
“Damn right!” Dean snapped but it came out far too shaky to be considered angry. He placed his hands on his hips and paced away just a few steps before turning back to Cas and leveling him with an expression of pure apprehension.
“Don’t dwell on it too hard,” Dean replied, “If what that Harut guy said was true, even the ones whose job it was to record stuff and
Castiel’s eyes widened a fraction. “Are you telling me a biological creature is responsible for this?”
. Cas bowed over a book, his eyes intensely focused and scanning page after page with impossible speed; distracting. Cas speaking soothingly, voice plaintive and understanding, to a prospective witness; endearing. Cas growling threats at a demon caught in a devil’s trap, his jaw set, his shoulders back; exciting.
“It was devastating to watch his fall and be powerless to stop it.” Castiel told him in a small, broken voice.
At that moment his brain unhelpfully supplied the memory of Cas following his lead without resistance. The mark on his arm flared and burned unexpectedly, a malicious voice lashing out from within.
Cas met her eyes briefly, feeling guilty for his insensitivity before nodding and turning just so to give his back, his injured arm once again curled against his chest
His temples gave a violent pulse when he tried to think beyond their conversation in the kitchen. He must have hit his head harder than he thought when he fell. He glanced back down at the note in his hand, considering its instructions, before looking passed it at his now two day old pajamas.
“No record?” Dean parroted in disbelief, “Aren’t you guys supposed to be the alpha and the omega? Know the A to Z on all of creation?”
By the time they rejoined Sam, the taller hunter looked just about as perturbed as Dean felt, something that only became more apparent as he filled his little brother in on everything they had seen and learned. Once they were all on the same page, Sam scrubbed a palm over his face to steel himself before slipping back into professional investigator mode.
Dean wanted to scoff to cover how that single sentence made his heart beat a little faster but he abstained, instead he mirrored the angel’s steps, coming to lean against another work bench near the nose of the sheeted car.
To his credit, once he'd gotten a handle on himself, Dean was right beside him but he wasn’t nearly as adept at diving in. Though he’d calmed down significantly, his nerves were completely shot. Not only was he worried about his friend but his sense of safety in the bunker was fundamentally shaken. Despite his best efforts, he was twitchy and restless. When he wasn’t rereading the same sentence half a dozen times, he was up and pacing under the pretense of searching for different books. By the sixth time he was up and out of his chair, Sam finally intervened.
He disappeared around the corner, leaving behind a stunned Jack and Sam, both of whom turned their eyes to Cas. If it were possible, Castiel appeared even more stoic and solemn than he had before.
Sam nodded in agreement, glancing at the numbered doors as they passed by on either side. “Yeah, I noticed that too. In all fairness though, last time we actually died.”
The fluorescent lights of the lobby glared off the wet glossy black bike helmet still clasped securely in place on the newcomer's head, completely obscuring any facial identification. The manager paused inside the back doorway, eyeing the helmet and accompanying layers of sodden black biking attire suspiciously before glancing for the first time outside. As if to emphasize the strangeness of the encounter, another clap of thunder rolled loudly overhead accompanied by the harsh
To his credit Cas remained sitting on the bench as still as stone, only his eyes moving to follow the hunter. Despite Dean’s efforts to appear casual, Cas could sense the tension manifold in the air and witnessed in real-time the hunter’s complete retreat from it. This wasn’t new by any stretch of the imagination. The hunter withdrew from any situation which he deemed too intimate or emotionally demanding more times than the angel could count. It was his nature, but that never made it sting any less.
Dean lifted his face toward the ceiling, letting the water wash over his face and hair, his expression screwed up into something like disgust. It felt like a betrayal no matter what he told himself but he couldn’t sit around and do nothing either.
His face hovered close enough Castiel could feel the heat of his breath on his lips, but he wouldn’t kiss him.
Dean gave him a small smile and a nod before they each took up their respective halves. They chewed in silence for a moment before Castiel once again spoke first.
As their conversation ended, Evan pulled into the mostly empty parking lot of a large, single story grey brick of a building.
Castiel once again ignored the honey sweet drawl vying for his attention, his eyes skimming over the apparition now lounging on the couch with its feet propped on the coffee table.
Sam returned the smile with a nod of greeting, flashing his FBI badge. “Yeah, hi. Agent Scholtz. I’m here looking into the death of Victor Hishov.”
“Hey.” He said quietly. “You bailed on us pretty quick back there. You okay?” He was aiming for casual though he felt anything but.
Heat flooded Dean’s face but he didn’t give his brother the satisfaction of a response to that. Instead, he shifted his focus back to his food, ignoring the smirk still resting easily on his brother's face in his periphery. He was teasing like he always teased but it was harder to brush off the disappointment this time.
However, now with Mrs. Ivanovna’s reaction, he was sure. They were dealing with another version of him just as they had dealt with alternate versions Michael and Zachariah. He had killed the disgusting excuse of himself from that Apocalyptic world so it couldn’t be him, but that only left the rest of the multiverse to worry about.
Dean thought about every instance he had assessed Cas at a glance, known what he needed or what he’d done, and vice versa. Then, simultaneously, he felt a wave of deep seething anger. It spawned from the same spot as the arousal had earlier; both instances then and now being somehow part of him, and also completely foreign.
Sam, who moments before had become a fully alert flurry of long flailing limbs during the initial swerve toward the ditch, now clung white-knuckled to the ‘oh shit’ handle above the passenger door. His other massive hand was pressed with stiffly splayed fingers against the dash, bracing him against the screeching stop. With his chest still heaving he whipped his head to the side, his tousled hair sticking up in every direction, both from the rush of air through the open windows and the sudden violent movements of the car, and pinned his brother with an epically scathing and scandalized bitch face.
The sky stretching out from horizon line to horizon line was just about as grey and dull as the road in between, but despite the hazy overcast, the air was balmy enough to leave the windows down. Somewhere between Colorado Springs and Burlington, Dean’s usual layers had begun to stifle him and he’d shed his jacket and his flannel. It left him in just his favorite band tee whose lettering and imagery were so timeworn they could scarcely be made out, but whose fabric was comfortably soft in a way only years of wear and washing could warrant.
“Yes.” The angel replied confidently, stepping over the glass to exit the bathroom. Sonia and Evan moved aside to let him pass while Sam and Jack followed him out. “He’s in the Black Hills of South Dakota in a cabin at the northernmost edge of a large isolated lake with no civilization in any direction for at least 20 miles.”
The suggestive lilt in it’s voice made his stomach flip, but he didn’t acknowledge the words as he passed by the couch to feed the dying fire with another log. A prickling heat at the back of his neck signaled the sickening brush of apparition’s fingers, but the angel anticipated it and skirted out of the way before it could touch him. Wheeling back around, he took it’s spot and sunk down onto the plush couch cushion.
Dean went very still, his eyes fixed on Cas with an unreadable expression before he turned away, looking forward toward their escort where they had both stopped several yards ahead, waiting.
“It wouldn’t be the first time,” Sam replied matter-of-factly. “But even if it isn’t, aren’t you even a little curious?”
And then everything clicked: the freak thunderstorm that had fried the motel video footage, the familiar build of the faceless killer, and finally the absolutely supernatural strength necessary to break Hishov the way he's been broken…
Two identical scars ran over the right side of his mouth, pulling the corner down into a permanent snarl as he growled in reply, “
“Unfortunately if Dean recognized another angel, it would likely be because they had tried to kill him in the past.” Cas frowned in response.
To test a theory, Cas allowed the feeling to sink into him, manipulating his grace to inspect it. Sure enough, it seemed to catch hold and maintain a connection. It was Dean’s soul he’d felt, just as the hunter had felt his grace earlier. He should have recognized it sooner, after all, it wasn’t the fact that he could feel the hunter’s soul that was new. It was the fact that he had not consciously made the connection that was strange.
“You said before that you came here to save me, you’ve clearly been through a lot to make that happen.” He forced himself to say, “And I can’t thank you enough for that, Cas, but I can’t help you if I don’t know what’s going on.”
“My apologies, “ The manager breathed evenly through a winning smile all the while his left hand moved ever so subtly toward the back of the counter and the twelve-gauge hidden beneath on the shelf. “I spoke out of place. What can I do for you?”
Dean preened at the praise. He’d had very little with John, so he’d become a sucker for it. Sam seemed to have noticed and smiled to himself- proud of his brother. They sat a couple more seconds in silence before Sam seemed to think of another question.
Once he got down to the basement, however, there was no one in sight. Dean made him cut the power line, but he couldn't use the elevator again. He tried the door one door, but someone had locked it, the other opened to reveal Rowena alone in an empty room.
Warnings and ask blog link are at the end. I know it's a little short (and late) but hopefully next chapter makes up for it.
"Hold on a sec, honey," she interrupted, turning her head toward someone or something Dean couldn't see. "Yes, he's here... Right in front of me.... Yeah, I can give it to him..." She smiled at him, "Sorry, Dean. Gotta go. Be safe."
He thought a moment "Tell you what though, make it worth the risk. I'll tell you what I know. But- uh, I know you're both broke, so no money. I don't want you guys to get into too much trouble." After that, he turned back around and went back to cleaning.
The boys looked at each other in panic. "Quick," Dean instructed, shoving him behind one bale of diapers, "stay. hide."
"Dean, you didn't give me any chips. I do not know what you're talking about. I've been reaching out to other occultists and hackers online, trying to see if anyone knows how we can get rid of that demon you told me about. "
"Dean, there was no metal box. The rubix cube had your attention, though." Cas replied, confused. "Dean, try to get some sleep tonight. You're wearing yourself out."
Dean felt sorry for the author. Whoever it was, they were clearly struggling with something. He felt sorry for whoever the letter was for, too. Someone clearly loved them, but all they got was someone who was mean to them. It wasn't fair, Dean decided. He shrugged to himself. He was glad he'd never have to deal with that.
Dean left the treehouse and went back into the apartment building, waving to Cas and heading into the other boy's kitchen. Where His Gameboy started acting weird again, the light that Charlie installed, glowing blue. When he pressed the button, a weird symbol came flying at him for no reason. He didn't recognize it, but he remembered it.
Together, they left and walked down the hall where Dean picked the lock, with Cas keeping a lookout. The coast stayed clear, and they were in fairly quick. However, As soon as they stepped in an awful stench assaulted their nostrils.
Dean boarded the elevator and went to the third floor. Skipping Chuck and Benny, he walked into 304. He could've sworn someone lived there, but the apartment was completely bare and no one answered him when he called out. Just in case, he pulled out the Game boy, and walked further into the apartment.
Cas had given Dean 10 Polaroids last week of the same picture of Gizmo over and over. He pulled one out of his pocket. "Will this work?"
That got Cas's attention. He looked up from the microscope for the first time since Dean had entered the room, frowning deeply, "Dean, V is too old for you," he said entirely too serious.
"I'm sorry, man, they never really stick around long." he gave Cas a minute to process what he'd just seen before speaking up. "We need to get into that bedroom, but it's boarded up. Do you or your dad have any tools I could use to get us in?"
Dean did so, taking the ladder down to the last level. In the corner stood a stick figure with a hexagonal head. He stood hunched over, cane in hand.
They both went their separate ways, with a promise from Dean to return. He immediately went down and show Cas and impressed him with the new super GBA.
As he walked, he saw bones scattered around on the ground. It looked like they were both animal and human, but he also spotted an ambulance- and none of it mattered. He ran towards it, although blood covered the back. Dean knew that ambulances help people, so he crawled into the open doors- hoping to find an adult that could help him and his face filled with agony.
"I have retrieved the remaining assets." Said the cultist. In front of them stood Cas's mother, and a woman with long, straight hair that had to be Lisa, and Mr. Mills. The skulls Dean had retrieved and more cultists surrounded them.
"Yek noitingoc eht dnuof evah uoy, ecno ta lla eldnah tonnac dnim ruoy. diarfa eb ton od. nekorb raeppa lliw sgniht emos."
"Wait!", called Cas, but it was already too late, Ben had already disappeared into the floor. "Fuck!" Cas yelled.
"I'd actually like to help instead. C'mon man, I won't tell anyone- You gotta talk to someone, eventually." Dean was uncomfortable, but it felt like the right thing to say.
Again he walked up to the machine and before Bobby or Cas could say or do anything, Dean yanked the cord from the wall and watched as the spirit in the middle of Mr. Carrigan's chest disappeared.
And in front of Dean's eyes, she vanished. He stood there, slack jawed, before remembering himself and opening the envelope- another journal page. How did she get this? He wondered. He pushed the event from his mind and walked out of the apartment.
He went to Cas's room and told him to follow. The other boy rolled his eyes, but did as he was told. They went to the elevator and up to the fifth floor, Dean filling Cas in on their way up. Cas wasn't sure if it would even work, but he could sure as hell try. They walked straight into 504 Where Dean pulled out the super GBA again and pressed the buttons.
It startled Dean when the stall opened to Crowley. His eyes were red-rimmed and his nose looked like he’d rubbed it raw. He was looking down, and his posture seemed that of someone who felt ashamed, "Thank you, S-Dean. I-uh, found this on your desk." He handed Dean an envelope with his name on it. Inside was a journal page. "I had been planning on binning it, but.... Look.-"
"Clearly not us." Cas replied in a deadpan voice. Both Dean and Gabe looked at him like he'd grown two heads. "Am I not allowed to be humorous?" At the silence from the other two he huffed and stood- helping Dean up off the ground, "Crowley punched Dean and I was going to report it before you came crashing into us."
Dean sighed heavily. He was almost glad Sam brought it up, so he wouldn't have to. "It's still fuzzy for me, dude, but I'm pretty sure it was after..." Dean let himself trail off and he looked away so he wouldn't have to see Sam's face fall. "Bobby said you reminded him of mom. But, uh, don't blame Bobby, he didn't know where Dad had taken you. And as soon as he did..."
Ben shivered, "Mommy scares me now. She scares everyone... but she wasn't always like that. She used to be nice, like daddy." he continued, unprompted, "I remember they had a fight and then she was really sad. Then her sadness turned into angriness."
Garth wrote something down and nodded at the orderlies, signaling that they had finished their session. They came in, ushering Dean to his room, where Dean lay down, awake for the rest of the day thinking about what he would tell Sam and coming up blank.
He supposed it might’ve surprised him to see Judy on the floor, dead and the place coated in blood from ceiling to floor. He wasn't though. The broken furniture didn't shock him, nor did the pieces of brain he found ground into the carpet. He was, however, surprised to see bloody footsteps leading to the front door.
"Castiel, please. No." Bobby begged before promptly vomiting on the floor again. He panted with his hands on his knees for a moment before blindly closing the cooler. "This... this is way over our heads, Dean- even mine."
They went their separate ways, Dean checked the mail first. It was mostly bills and payment reminders. And a cut-off notice for the phones. Dean sighed, he'd have to write the checks when his dad passed out- He made enough for them to live comfortably, he just forgot to pay the bills sometimes.
Dean didn't bother trying to figure out exactly what that meant, just continued walking until he came to the lunch counter where the emo guy stood alone, cleaning up and putting old stuff away. He looked up and noticed Dean greeting him while working.
His next stop was the ground floor. He went to talk to Rowena, who, as always, sat in her rocking chair, going gently back and forth. He walked up to her, greeting her as he did.
"Weird," he said aloud to no one, but selected the next level which presented him with: "She knew not why this place called to her, yet could not prevent her feet from treading the dirt path before her. Perhaps it was simply curiosity, or perhaps it was destiny."
Garth smiled brightly at him and told him it was a wonderful idea. Dean couldn't think of what to say, only reminded him to not serve him bologna.
It read, "A young occultist found themselves tangled in the bowels of the castle searching for the last components The Council required."
Dean, honest to god, couldn't remember, the beginning was blurry to him. Sometimes he forgot how old he was now, so he looked back over at Garth, silently giving him permission to discuss his case. However, in case the head honchos were watching, he spoke it too, surprising Sam.
She faded away again, and in Dean's hand now was an old hand held phone. The handset was black, like a void, and the golden buttons seemed to float on it rather than in it. He dialed in the numbers she'd said, not understanding why, but knowing to do so anyway. After he did though, everything faded, and black, a comfortable feeling, the darkness, in front of him- a brown, leather-bound journal surrounded him, floated in midair. Cas's mom didn't reappear, but he could hear her this time, more clearly than she'd ever been.
"I'm afraid I know nothing about bologna. This room is my prison, my tomb of infinite sorrow, I can never leave this state." It moaned.
The ones who had gotten sandwiches nodded, "I thought last week smelled bad, this week seems exponentially worse. I couldn't even bring myself to get one." Said Charlie.
Somewhere along the way he blacked out, Dean could barely remember what happened- his mind fuzzy, but instead of petting the puppy with his mommy, Dean was now wandering the city streets with a bleeding face- and it hurt so much. He didn't know exactly where he was, or why he was here. He didn't know where his mom had gone. Through his clouded vision, he could see destroyed buildings and an airplane on fire. Like the airplane had crashed through and left disaster in its wake. Dean didn't know if it was because he lost too much blood, or what- but he could've sworn that he could feel the heat from the inferno from where he stood, several miles away.
They were silent for a moment before Dean spoke again. "Psst, Gabe, I'll help you kill him when Cas isn't looking."
Only a couple hours later, the long-lost brothers sat across from each other in an awkward silence. In front of Dean was his usual meal- a bacon cheeseburger, extra onions. He wanted fries, but the center promoted healthiness, so he had apple sauce. He didn't mind; it was easier to get under the prosthetic. In front of Sam was a plain kale salad. No dressing or anything. He seemed to enjoy it, though. Dean didn't know how he ate the rabbit food, but didn't criticize, yet. He didn't want to lose his brother again.
"C'mon man. Do you have noodles for arms? Next time just hammer the nails in further." He asked. Not bothering to listen for the answer. He noticed a dial on the floor. It looked similar to Cas's puzzle box. He didn't bother asking, just took it and left.
"Look, if you won't tell me why you were crying, can you at least tell me why you hate me? I have done nothing to you, but it's day after day, man." Dean’d be lying if he said he wasn't curious.
He woke on the floor of Charlie's livingroom, his face aching beneath his prosthetic. He didn't know how long he'd been there. He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket, so he checked it. He had a few missed texts from Bobby.
"I'm not entirely sure," she replied, "but I found something else- missing person from 1993. Ben Breadon, 7 years old. He lived here with his mom, Lisa, and her husband, Greg. He must be the son that the chick in my bathroom was babbling on about."
The bathroom still stunk to high hell, so Dean wouldn't be going in. He stood in the Livingroom when his Gameboy started glowing again- another symbol. He drew it and continued down to the first floor.
Chuck winced at the curse but nodded, "I-I'd do it my-myself, but I- uh- I'm out of c-clean clothes."
Back at the apartments, after school had ended- Dean, Cas, and Charlie stood in the entryway talking through their plans.
Similar to Rowena and Anna, he led the unnamed cultist through the maze like a temple. For each section he collected skulls. Dean had a little more difficult than the other two, though. The cultist slid around at the slightest tap of the controller, but soon enough, he'd collected the skulls hidden around the temple. After he'd gotten them, it took him to a cutscene.
themes of suicide, themes of murder, demons, mysterious apparitions, strange symbols, witches, conspiracy, cults, mentions of child murder, mentions of child abuse, cursing, hinted infidelity, being mean to Chuck, tbh cannon chuck deserves it, ghosts, somewhat bad description of a video game, bending of reality, hints of parental abandonment, therapy

The scene ended, and it took Dean back to the level select menu again. He selected the fourth one. It opened with: "When his wife learned of his indiscretions, Greg knew there wasn't much time left. In fear of his life, he turned to an unlikely ally for help."
"The man is a threat to us. We cannot trust him. We will accomplish great things together and cannot afford any obstacles." it said.
Charlie agreed, and they made their way to her bathroom. When they were both in, Dean pressed the first button that Charlie had indicted to, and the antenna shot out, the blue light coming on immediately. He looked over at her, impressed. She cocked an eyebrow, so he pressed the other button. Nothing happened and her cocky look fell.
"Huh, you haven't been able to summon him?" Dean shook his head, "Maybe finding that rosary will help. Y'know connection to belongings and all that."
Gabe put his hands up, "Joking, Cassie. It was an attempt at a joke. Besides, he might haunt the school and the bone-head’d be haunting us forever."
"Oh my, it's been a very long time since I've had this body." Her accent was thicker than the older woman's, "I have to thank you, Dean. You've given me another 500 years."
It faded again, and Jody was now in a room filled wall to wall with cult members. They each paced in erratic patterns. It took Dean so many tries, but he did eventually get the book from the other side and get back to the door. When he did it cut to black again and Jody was in her apartment again, where someone was knocking on the door.
The screen faded to black for a moment. When it resumed, the cultist that had stood in the center was now a black mass of misshapen limbs that seemed to flicker in and out of existence- their face gone. The other cult members slowly backed away, but the council stayed, resolute. And the game cut to the level select menu again.
"Gabriel could have the right idea, though. If there is an issue with the meat product in our sandwiches, I'd like to look at it on a microscopic level, however it would be helpful to know what the exact ingredients are."
Together they looked in, Castiel's face pressed against Dean's cool prosthetic. Inside lay a severed goat's head. A small amount of blood pooled beneath it, sticking to the coarse fur. Its tongue flopped out and to the side and its eyes stared into the air, lifeless and blank. Unware of the two teenage boys staring at it in horror. Castiel quickly closed the freezer, both of them backing up and away.
"Oh," Ben suddenly remembered something, "Daddy and I were playing hide and go seek. "Gotta go, Dee!"
It now gave him Anna, from Charlie's bathroom, to control. She was in a forest, with bare trees surrounding her. She stood on a dirt path that led directly to a church. Inside were two doors. One had a man in front, guarding it. He led Anna to the guard, but only received a "Members Only" before moving to the other door.
Straight ahead was a button, and a statue of Lisa surrounded by flame. Dean led her over the button, the statue sinking when she walked on it, and into the flame. There was no cutscene, and the compulsion to play finally let up. He put his game boy away.
"Very good." they spoke together, and it labeled their dialogue as the council," the preparations are now complete. Stay within the circle while we perform the summoning. "
"It's more likely to blend of low-cost meat scraps from chicken, beef, pork, and turkey." Cas contributed.
"The council recognizes the great resolve you've shown us today. Let this book stand as a testament of your place among our ranks from hence forth. May our sight pierce the heavens and our reach be everlasting. For we will be the angels!"
Then he spotted it, perhaps because it was still nagging at his subconscious; the leather cord he’d seen earlier when he’d first confronted Alt-Cas. It was present in the picture as well, the cord hanging around the angel’s neck with the horned brass pendant attached to it standing out bright against the blue fabric on his chest.
Cas didn’t seem to notice him as he made his way between down the aisle between the rows, and didn’t acknowledge him at all until Dean was seated next to him on the bench. Even then it was only with the fractional movement of his head toward the disturbance. The air was still and tense as though Dean approached the edge of a wide bottomless chasm. Sensing that Cas wasn’t going to give him an in, Dean leaned back against the pew with a sigh and crossed his arms.
"I know you're worried.” Sam continued a bit softer, “I am too, but Dean’s a fighter. You know he’s not going to take this quietly. He’s probably giving this other you all sorts of hell.”
“Good evening friend.”  The manager mumbled through a thick accent, before shuffling over to the check-in computer. “Strange weather, yes? Lucky for you we have rooms.”
you. YOU. ABDUCTED. ME.” The last words were a deafening roar in the silent kitchen as his temper finally boiled over. “So how about you stop jerking me off here and give me some
The angel’s eyes snapped open as the hand around his cock sped up, expertly stroking over the engorged flesh as a long pointed pink tongue swiped tantalizingly at the lobe of his ear before sucking it between plump lips. Then, sitting up on his knees, the eyeless hunter pressed his torso up against the angel’s chest, licking a stripe along the angel’s jawline, before straightening his back and looking down into his victim’s face.
Dean shoved himself off the counter without a backward glance, shuffling awkwardly as he lifted his arms up to claw at the damp shirt on his back, dragging it over his head and tossing it haphazardly aside as sweat once again began to bead at his temples.
“Every reality is different. I have been to some in which the bike doesn’t exist at all for one reason or another.”
“No,” Cas replied. This time his voice was firmer, more like himself. His expression hardened as he looked away, meeting the gaze of Harut who had since moved to stand on the opposite side of the sigil several feet away, his brother ever at his side. Dean was about to ask how it could be so disturbing if he didn’t even know what it was, but one of the heavenly asshole brigade interrupted him.
Despite that minor hiccup, this Dean had been receptive to him in a way few others had been. Everything from his disposition, to his eyes, to his height, to the inflection in his voice; it was all the same. He was the same and the angel was sure that it would only be a matter of time before he came around.
The small shock of pain up his leg reminded him of a nasty bee sting, but it wasn’t anything he couldn’t handle. A small sad smile tugged at the corner of his mouth as he deposited the medkit on the counter. He could practically hear Cas’s exasperated lecture; something along the lines of being stubborn for enduring trivial pain.
“Okay.” He said, handing the keys off to Cas. “I’m going to head inside and ask around for some info. You and Jack go check out the Blue Mermaid and meet me back here in an hour or so.”
Then, all at once, the pain dispersed into nothing, and Dean gasped loudly, heaving the first lung full of air that didn't sear his throat along the way. Sam eased back when his brother finally unfurled himself and pushed himself up on shaky arms. Sam laid a tentative hand on his shoulder.
It dawned on Sam then, and he jerked the phone away from his face to look at the time; it was a quarter past ten. They should have left hours ago. Suddenly very aware something was amiss, Sam took a few steps toward the bathroom where he’d sleepily assumed Dean had been since he wasn’t in his bed.
He bowed his head in rumination, attempting to corral his racing thoughts when he suddenly felt a rush of heat overtake him. Blue eyes snapped open against the onslaught, the breath in his lungs escaping in a startled gasp. Vivid images and sensations flooded through his senses without his prompting;
Setting his time in hell aside, the fallout after Dean had received the Mark had been the darkest time in his life. The insatiable itch to kill, the uncontrollable rage, and later the twisting of his soul into something vile and demonic were all traumas he relieved in his nightmares to this day.  Perhaps the most damning though,  something had never and would never reveal, was that in the deep dark shameful corners of his soul, he could still feel an ache for the freedom he’d experienced when he’d finally given in to it. Freedom from not only the typical burden of human and hunter existence but also from himself; from his guilt and his fear and his sorrow.
“Please excuse my candor, Miss Ivanovna,” Cas finally broke the silence, the authoritative depth of his voice once again commanding everyone’s attention. “But we need to speak to your mother about the homicide she witnessed in the early morning yesterday.”
Cas appeared sheepish of all things, looking away from Dean toward the podium. “Dean please believe me when I say I had no intention of frightening you. Until that moment, you had never had any sort of reaction to my voice.”
“Not like I have a choice.” He grunted. “So--” He took the first bite of seasoned egg, fully intending on speaking through a mouthful but instead froze mid chew. His eyes went wide as the flavor hit him, barely containing a groan when he began chewing again. Despite being no where near trusting the guy, the hunter couldn't deny that the food was
Hannah appeared suitably contrite after Castiel’s reprimand but doubled down on her previous assertion. “I am aware now that my methods were perhaps a bit medieval--”
Dean heard the resounding disappointment in the single syllable that the angel was trying very hard to conceal.
The words had been ethereal bells; the sound of Cas’s true voice, but he had understood them in that moment like he hadn’t when he’d first heard them while the angel prayed. It was like he understood the meaning because the sentiment had been shared which was mind-meltingly confusing. If it was shared then that meant that they both wanted to be together and the hunter was not at all prepared to deal with that possibility.
When a dark throaty chuckle from behind them drew Dean’s attention, Castiel panicked. Before the hunter could turn his head to catch a glimpse of the dark spirit as it reappeared near the stairs, the angel gripped his chin and forced him back around.
Above him, Dean’s own eyes were wide with panic as he tried to control his breathing so as not to give himself away. Cas was filling up his senses. All around him, the warmth of Cas’s grace hovered but didn’t dare to touch him, it’s silvery blue shimmer blinking in and out like sunlight on water. Every breath carried with it the sharp scent ozone and a fresh crisp taste like winter wind and mint. Above it, all was the high pitched whine that now seemed tinged with distress and uncertainty, but Dean’s own frantic heartbeat nearly drowned it out.
“Fair enough.” Sam finally relented, but jabbed a finger pointedly in his brother’s face, “But I’m sure Cas has been thinking along those same lines. Anyone could be next, including him. I’ve never seen him this out of sorts but that just means he needs us now more than ever. So man up; he’s going to need pillar of support Dean right now, not irrational easily provoked Dean.” He looked as though he was about to let it go, but then poked the older hunter in the same spot he’d punched for good measure, adding a slightly less scathing and a bit more nagging, “And apologize!”
“It’s a different type of locating spell.” Cas replied, shoving the white sleeves of his dress shirt up to his elbows having long ago dispatched the suit coat and trench coat. “It requires only some sort of reflective medium and an incantation.”
Unable to see what lay beyond that from the room, Dean stepped out and slowly made his way down the hall. He tried each door he passed, finding a linen closet behind one and behind the other, a luxurious bathroom whose cobblestone walls and floor matched that of the earlier fireplace. When he reached the spot where the hallway wall opened up, his eyes widened into saucers.
This time though, Dean anticipated the vertigo and nausea-inducing drop in his stomach before his feet made an impact with semi-solid surface sand. What he did not expect, however, was to step off the lip of the sandbox, and once again collide with Castiel.
“The perp must have gotten cold feet. Vic was a young guy in a town just south of the border with Nebraska called Lebanon. Said he came across a man fitting the killer’s description trying to break into an old prep bunker just outside the city limits. Called him out, got into a scuffle, but the guy took off on his bike before the kid could call the police.”
As he fell into his own thoughts, the swell of sensation in his chest returned along with a frustrating mixture of apprehension and...something else. Something that had been skittering around the edges of his psyche for months now. Something he refused to deal with beyond the vague acknowledgment of its existence.
It really did sound like the haunting drag of a bow along the strings of a fine instrument, but it was one single elongated note. As he concentrated on the sound, his chest and throat grew tight with emotion, and when he opened his eyes he could
The footage was black and white and grainy--seriously, who used VHS tapes anymore?--but Dean could easily recognize the lobby. The assailant entered the screen from the bottom, having just walked in the front door directly under the camera. He still wore the helmet. Dean squinted at the dark figure. Though he still wore the helmet, there was something familiar in the slope and set of his black-coated shoulders. The hunter’s eyes flickered between the manager and the stranger, trying to discern their conversation through their body language alone. For a moment the pair just stood at the counter, then the stranger finally removed his helmet, and the manager suddenly jerked his hands up, palm out in the universal sign of surrender. Though his back remained facing the camera, more alarm bells went off in Dean's head as he took in the swath of messy dark hair curling around the assailant’s ears. Then the manager and stranger appeared to exchange more words before the stragnger suddenly vanished and the footage sputtered and burned out.
The angel released a curt breath, seeming to tire quickly of this line of questioning. Instead of answering, he asked a question of his own. “Are you hungry?”
“You are not crazy Dean,” Cas said quickly, not wanting to further frighten his friend by beating around the bush. His hands dropped to his sides when Dean appeared to no longer be moments away from bolting from the room. “I do feel something different; I sensed the change the first moment it happened.”
“Hungry--?” Dean began incredulously, before grabbing a fistful of his shirt and shifting the blade up to the asshole’s throat. “Listen, I’m done playing nice. Give me some real fucking answers or--”
“Before he died, my father was a scholar.” Sonia responded in kind, her tone soft and reverent, “He often spoke of fantastical creatures and entities relevant to his research. My mother was less inclined to believe his stories, but I always found them fascinating.”
After the allowance of the kiss, he attempted to resist the urge to touch the hunter further, but it wasn’t long before he caved, drawn to the other man like a moth to a flame. The angel reached for him with trembling fingers, hardly believing he had finally done it; finally found him.
The angel went rigid beneath the lean body, the muscle in his jaw jumping under the hand which caressed it in a mockery of tenderness. A dark smirk full of sharp teeth and lethal intent split across the apparition’s face like a wound.
“Dean,” Castiel murmured, continuing his approach and stopping only when the tip of the blade pressed against the black fabric of his shirt just under his clavicle. Beneath the loosened collar, Dean could just make out the hint of a leather corded necklace--strange his Cas didn't wear any jewelry that he was aware of. The angel didn’t seem to be concerned by the danger, his eyes still locked on Dean’s face. “I
After fully absorbing that fantasy, Dean felt a renewed sense of urgency to get back to the bunker, and so it was with a final satisfying stretch of his limbs that the hunter finally blinked open his blurry, tired eyes.
“Sheesh.” Dean hissed before suddenly going still. “Hey didn’t we stay at that place on the way up here?”
Sonia hummed softly as she dabbed alcohol onto the broken skin at the center of the bruise where the tile had cut the skin through his shirt. The vague response put Cas on edge and he couldn’t help thinking back to all her previous statements pertaining to the relationship between himself and the hunter, chiefly her question about love. He tried to push it away, knowing it was not important in the face of what they had yet to do, but in this quiet moment, with all eyes busy elsewhere, he couldn’t resist.
A brief glance around made him aware of three identical heated glares burning into him from the other three angels in the room. Though the hunter could have given a rat’s ass about them, he did feel a deep pang of guilt and shame for going off like that in front of Cas. He hadn’t been thinking, as per usual. Cas was still an angel, and he was obviously hugely affected by whatever was going on here, but that was the entire reason Dean felt so strongly about it in the first place. Whatever this thing was, angels were its main targets which meant that any one of them could be next, including Cas. The mere thought of it was enough to get Dean’s blood boiling again, but instead of spinning out at the stupid angel’s and their stupid excuses and half-truths again, he abruptly turned and made for the door.
the vapor. This seems to be similar to that, only it's both of senses that seem to be getting crossed, as well as your own.”
“Right" Dean muttered, lingering for a heartbeat before turning away. "Night buddy.” He added over his shoulder as an afterthought and mentally cringed at how terrible it sounded as he headed for the exit.
Both Cas and Sam sat up a bit straighter, exchanging looks of identical concern. They had grown used to identifying the signs of the Mark’s influence when the older hunter was most vulnerable to it and now was no different. The blank expression, the hard eyes, the tense body language; it wasn’t so dissimilar to how Dean normally handled himself under stress, but the gruff vibrato and the snark were absent and in its place, the eerie stillness and calm he’d exuded while a demon.
“Hannah?” Dean grated harshly, turning to face the angel for the first time, suspicion and resentment pinching his face into a bitter expression. “As in 'the angel who had the hots for you and told you to gank me to prove your loyalty to Heaven’?” A strange look flashed across the angel’s face at the mention of Hannah’s attraction to him, and Dean swallowed back an angry curse at the slip-up. He could feel Sam’s eyes on him too but refused to look at him. Instead, Dean did what he always did; doubled down and got angry. "The one who went over to Metatron's side?!"
Throwing a handful in the bag as well, Dean then raced back out into the garage. Shoving the waters and blade in one of the side saddlebags, the hunter searched around for a way to open the garage door, slamming the button so hard when he found it on the wall the plastic casing cracked.
threw off his balance sending him stumbling back into the pillar of boxes. They and the light crashed to the ground. The shadows rose even more dramatically, looming over Dean, ready to swallow him whole.
Lost in his own head, he didn’t notice Castiel’s measured approach until the backs of strong fingers caressed over his arm where it was crossed over his chest. The touch was gentle, meant to draw his attention but he jerked away regardless, dropping his hands down to grip the edge of the work bench.
“Cas…?” Jack began in a low voice so as not to alert Sam or the others. “When you saw Dean was he--is he okay?”
“There were no tricks.” The angel bristled, his eyes momentarily so full of fury that a thrill of genuine fear ran up the hunter’s spine.
Frustrated, Dean abandoned the bedroom for the stairs. However he felt about it, the angel was the single hurdle he had to jump to freedom, and he knew it was going to take some manipulation of his own to get it done.
Sam could see the flare of emotion his reply sent rippling through his brother so he quickly backtracked to avoid an argument. “Look, I’m not blaming you man, I’m just saying I get it. You’re all over the place because you’re worried. I’m worried too but neither of us are going to get anywhere while you’re like this.”
and he began shoveling it in with gusto; forgetting for the time being that he was supposed to be interrogating his kidnapper.
“Good” Castiel sighed an easy smile that seemed far too friendly for how tense Dean still felt, before settling his weight casually onto his back leg and giving the hunter an appraising once over. “Your cortisol levels have dropped and your heart rate has reduced substantially.”
Dean finally lost the battle with his nausea. Jerking to the side and doubling over, he retched and coughed, dry heaving around a minuscule amount of bile and foam.
Dean latched onto the mention of something familiar. “You found this gem at Bobby’s? Must be a dimensional anomaly. I never found anything like this there.”
“Nightmare.” He replied gruffly before stooping to pick the discarded blanket up off the floor. “Must have moved around and fell off the couch.”
“I think you’re right,” Sam affirmed, squirming to fish his wallet out of his pocket and produced a room key with the image of a mermaid in a blue shell laminated on the front, confirming his brother’s suspicion.
“Hey, hey it's alright." He soothed warily, awkwardly patting the angel's shoulders despite himself. "It's just coffee--" Then, something unsettling struck him. Very slowly, Dean pushed at the angel's shoulders until he knelt back on his heels, peering up at the hunter with tear tracks lining his face.
The rich aroma of fresh coffee and savory bacon hit him next, making his stomach tense and rumble; when had he eaten last? Sammy must have been up and out already; the kid was a saint. If he were to go on smell alone he could almost believe he was back at the bunker anticipating a full homemade breakfast waiting for him in the kitchen.
After taking a moment to get a hold of himself, the older man rose onto swollen feet and waddled out of the back muttering his annoyance in a string of colorful Russian the whole way.
“I’ll pull up a map,” Sam affirmed while Sonia flit around the kitchen to fetch some ice for Cas’s shoulder.
“I’m not sure,” the angel admitted with an annoyed huff, “She refused to give me any details over ‘angel radio’.” Though he didn’t physically indicate the quotes with his fingers, Sam could basically hear them in the brief pauses around the words. “However, Hannah would not reach out to me and you two by extension if it wasn't serious. Though she gave no verbal indication, I could sense her urgency which prompted me to find you as soon as possible.”
“So it would seem.” Cas replied gruffly. “And it’s likely whoever put you to sleep is also the one who took Dean.”
“Sorry,” Sam apologized immediately, “I misspoke. I wasn’t calling their character into question. I’m just trying to understand how something like this could happen, looking at it from all angles, understand?”
Cas’s eyes flashed defiantly at him. “I refuse to hide while my brethren are abducted! Sam was right, the creature could still be close by! If we could just--”
“Yes. Yes, of course, he did.” Castiel murmured, almost compulsively, keeping his head downcast low enough that his displaced bangs obscured his eyes. “Forgive me.”
“I’m not sure.” Cas answered honestly, trying and failing to meet his friend’s gaze, “This isn’t...typical...by any stretch Dean. Only prophets are supposed to be able to comprehend an angel’s true voice.” He did meet Dean’s stupified gaze then, his own eyes narrowing in that familiar way they did when he was trying to piece together something complicated. “It is odd that you describe it in different sounds but not words. Are sounds all you can perceive? Is there anything else? Can you feel it? Taste it?”
Like the scene in the garage, he simply stood and glared for a long moment, regarding himself with a critical eye. His naked skin was flushed red from the exertion. His knees and shins were splotched an angry scarlet and stung from the salt of his sweat but his knuckles had taken the brunt of the damage and dripped tiny droplets of crimson onto the white tile. When he finally raised his eyes to look at his own face, he was repulsed by his own piteous state: his hair clung to his slick forehead, his cheeks were streaked with drying lines, and he was sickly pale with dark bags dragging down glossy red-ringed eyes.
Something warm and fond swelled in his chest as he envisioned the scene; Sam manning the stove, and Cas grumpily sipping at a cup of coffee at the dining table while Jack twittered away over some sugary cereal.
The last sentence came out way more sentimental than he’d meant it to, but when Dean caught the faint smile that tugged at the angel’s lips, he found himself not caring so much.
“Maybe the toxin?” Dean suggested, “Anywhere that shit touched was scorched and dead, even the stone on the path looked like it was corroded.”
“No one has been able to decipher it.” Harut informs them, “The language appears to be one even Heaven has no record of.”
“Yeah, you said that before.” Dean retorted, “So what, you’re like the ghost of Christmas future; heed your warning or perish?”
Sam found his voice first, shouting after their friend, “Cas! Wait! We don’t know if it’s still here!”
“Look, I get it.” He said simply, shrugging his unoccupied shoulder. “It was a lot to take in, and we’re all tired. Let’s just get inside and get some rest.”
“There’s no way to know for certain.” Cas sighed, sitting back once again and running a hand over his face. “But it’s the best plan I can come up with. If it falls through, then I will have to face him directly.”
The younger Winchester watched as the impala backed out and drove off out of sight before he turned swiftly and strode up to the station. Inside he was greeted by a clean faced young man at the front desk with a courteous, “Hello, sir. Can I help you?”
At Sam’s questioning tone, Evan shot him something like a look of foreboding that made the hunter slightly apprehensive.
With a frustrated scoff, Dean stalked into the showers where the air was now murky with thick hot steam. For a moment he simply stood in the middle of it, feeling the heat of the mist clinging to his skin and tried not to think of the shimmer of Cas’s grace or how similar it had felt. He wasted no time in grabbing a cloth and soap to mercilessly scrub himself down, relishing in the sting of the suds over his abused skin. He inhaled sharply through his teeth as he rinsed off the raw skin of his knuckles before finally stepping fully beneath the spray.
“So get this,” Sam’s voice broke suddenly into Dean’s sleepy meandering thoughts just as the older hunter took a bite of his burger.
The lights in the kitchen flickered violently as the wind howled around the eves of the house. Lightning struck somewhere close, the ground quaking beneath the force of its fury.
“It is new, that’s true.” She replied in kind, “But these new realities are not what concern me my friend. My nerves are for you and your man.”
Sam stood stunned, unsure if he was hearing correctly. “Did your father ever give you the name of that scholarly branch?”
“So you can...feel stuff with your grace?” Judging from the slight catch in the middle of the question, Dean seemed to be at once wrapping his mind around this new piece of information while simultaneously reevaluating his interactions over the years with the angel. If the circumstances at the moment hadn‘t been so dire, the slightly perturbed expression on the hunter’s face might have been amusing. As it were Castiel’s jaw remained clenched with visible tension, but he gave one curt nod before taking the first step to catch up with the escort. Dean followed him after a fleeting moment of introspection, falling quickly into step with his friend. Ahead of them, their guides resumed their pace.
By some miracle, Dean was able to untangle himself from Cas without giving away the complete and utter panic that was currently flooding his senses. Thankfully his brain quickly provided context to justify what had just happened.
Absurdly, he thought about his asshole future self and the Cas from the Croatoan universe. That miserable human version of his friend had been his fault too. Was there any reality in which Dean didn’t let his angel down?
The angel looked torn between something like disbelief and timid curiosity before he replied, “You heard that?"
Angry charred holes filled with blackness void deep and wretched were the only things that peered back. The vibrant green eyes that had once brought such life to that beautiful face had long since been burned out, but even had they still existed, the warmth had been extinguished the moment the hellish mark on his arm had been seared into his flesh.
Whatever this was, he seemed to be the only one able to hear or feel it. Sam had admittedly not heard the buzzing or ringing in the hallway, and if the other angels heard the duel tone, or felt the charged air, they had given no indication. Maybe it was a common angel thing and they were all so used to it they didn’t bother reacting to it. Even Cas himself hadn’t acknowledged it beyond the vague recount of some weird mojo bleeding through a magical holy language.
Angelic grace was a dynamic incandescent celestial energy, but it was so much more than a mere power source. Grace was the very foundation of an angel’s being, at once it’s celestial body, it’s life force and something like a soul. To see it smeared along the ground, dull and dark and dingy grey, gruesomely viscid in a macabre mirror of coagulated human blood...it was both inconceivable and utterly horrifying to behold.
“No need to be so nervous.” Sam assured him, feeling a bit awkward as he added what he hoped was a firm, “Speak freely.”
When he was finally able to see the name, his heart sank; it was Jody. He tried not to let the disappointment seep into his voice when he answered.
the coins had worked so well. Oh hell no, they had not just been flung through interdimensional space on a hunch! He was about to unleash a tirade of expletives to describe exactly how he felt about that but was stopped short when a smooth voice with a clipped accent spoke up from directly beside his shoulder.
With a bit of maneuvering, Dean managed to keep the angel on his feet, muttering a reassuring, ‘I got you’, under his breath.
He then proceeded to fill them both in on all the details he knew as he tore around the room collecting all of their belongings and packing up. The pair listened attentively, and assisted Sam in bringing everything to the impala. When it was all said and done, Sam hovered near the driver’s side door and fussed around with the car keys.
“Jesus,” Dean hissed, “If it did this to some flowers and stone, what the hell did it do to the angel?”
Dean hated himself when his own angry voice echoed those same words back in his mind, harsh and spiteful. Cas’s eyes were glossy with unshed tears, just as they had been back in Hannah’s office, but this time when he met Dean’s eyes, it felt as though the air had been kicked from his lungs. He hadn’t seen the angel look so lost and afraid since Dean had turned him away from the bunker. Dean suddenly felt an overwhelming need to pull him close, to wrap him up and keep him safe but he violently squashed the impulse--now was not the time for that nonsense--instead managing to simply lay a hand over his shoulder in what he hoped was a gesture of reassurance
“Sorry Cas. We’re--uh--we’re still in Casper. I just...” Sam trailed off again as he opened the door to find the impala still sitting exactly where Dean had parked it the previous afternoon.
Dean was sprawled across his bed on his stomach clad in just his boxers with one arm curled around his pillow where his face was buried. He too was snoring softly.
“I haven’t!” Cas shot back, turning his own glare to Hannah, “What exactly were you referring to Hannah!?”
Coming around behind the desk, Dean scanned the work space for anything useful. What he found was an ancient looking tome in a runic language he didn’t recognize, accompanied by an explosion of journals bursting with pages on which all available space was crammed with ink.
“Shuddup will’ya” Dean hushed him, catching and holding one of the angel’s hands to get his attention. The hunter’s eyes were still dazed from the magic used on him, a sleepy smile pulling almost drunkenly at his lips.
Over the hood, on the porch, he could see Sophia and Evan growing more restless the longer they remained separated. Bolting mid conversation was, at the very least, incredibly rude but the darkening expression in Sonia's face made Sam's stomach twist into knots. Her mother already had the wrong impression of Cas and all it would take was a phone call on Evan's part to figure out they weren't real feds.
O.K.  Apprehensive was the understatement of the century. Still skeptical, the defiance he felt was all suddenly undone as his empty stomach betrayed his hunger with an audible growl.
The tight fold of the younger hunter’s arms loosened. “Huh. Now that you mention it, Harut did act kinda strangely toward Cas when we left.”
“Hell of a ride you’ve got there,” He remarked, setting his sandwich aside to meander his way over to the ride in question. “No offense, but you ain’t lacking wings or mojo so what gives with the wheels?”
The panic held at bay by his concern now flooded his body with adrenaline. He had just been holding Cas like he was some sort of white knight. Like he was his goddamned prince charming. His heart felt like it might simultaneously pound out of his rib cage and cease beating altogether.
"I made it the same way every morning for five years." Not-Cas answered the question Dean hadn't asked, and then gestured to the plate between them, "The eggs are made with sour cream instead of milk. The bacon is slightly charred because your mother always overcooked it when you were a child, and the blackberry jam is spread over melted unsalted butter because even though you pretend not to hear Sam when he warns you about your blood pressure, you do make small concessions."
