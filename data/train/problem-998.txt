The building he finally struts towards looks to be of one family with the one in Lyon: small, unassuming, two stories and only one visible entryway. Just as difficult to break into as the last, and even with the same type of goon guarding it. This one, though, treats Sherlock with utmost respect and a lot of courtesy, very much unlike the reception he got in Lyon, so it seems that Sherlock has guessed exactly right on which role to play this time.
I follow him all the way into his hotel room, watching him adopt a less haunted expression some time along the third bus ride. As soon as the door closes behind us, he falls onto the bed and punches his fist into the mattress.
Warning: this is easily the heaviest chapter of the whole story. This is where all the not-previously-used warnings apply. This is where our boys finally figure out just how far this case goes, and it might come close to breaking them.
“John!” So wonderful of you to help out! And you brought a friend, too! “, Hettie exclaims, and I smile. I do like the senior owner of the bakery, who’s been mothering Harry and me ever since Harry started working here twenty-five years ago.
Still, I can’t help but think that if the cameras catch even half of the show that presents itself in front of me, Sherlock should really get his money back. Either he is a fantastic lover, or this woman could be earning millions in porn. Possibly both. The view of the two of them together might just be enough to drive any man insane, and I’m glad when it’s finally over. To myself I admit that part of that gladness stems from the fact I don’t want to threaten my cover with unfortunate noises, even if I’d never tell a soul about it.
him of his instincts. Someone who’ll let him grow up into whatever he feels he needs to become after this.”
He starts carefully peeling off my fake beard and wig, and I hold still until he’s done. Then, I take off the cardigan without bothering to unbutton it and give Sherlock a small kiss and a smile.
“It took you a while to notice my recipes, too”, Harry jokes. “One of the few good things I learned in the wizarding world – the secret of the Weasley sweater.”
Back at the hotel, Sherlock starts packing, carefully rolling up his case-wall mat and placing it in his suitcase. I half expect him to change appearance again, but apparently he has decided that Djamil is a good guise to travel in. Switching identities as well as type of accommodation and method of travel will help to cover his trail, but even he probably does not have an endless supply of identities to burn through.
When I get up, Harry has made us a full English breakfast, as she always does when she’s nervous. I hardly manage a bite. Finally, I will go back into battle, and the thought exhilarates me. This time, I have no clue what is waiting for me, and no back-up. I am the back-up, even though the “main troops” has no idea I am there.
“Jumpy, are we, Mr. Al Marad?”, the other man asks bemusedly, and Sherlock improvises a nervous giggle. It sounds fake in my ears, but maybe I just know Sherlock too well.
When I awake, the sun is rising, which around this time of the year I’d guess to be maybe 7 or 7:30. The other half of the bed is empty, and for a moment I fear it was all a dream. But the desk lamp is on, and Sherlock is already hunkering over his case-chart. I sigh inwardly. Of course he didn’t sleep through the night. This is Sherlock Holmes on a case, and he would never let something as small as a nervous breakdown waste that much time. But when I climb out of bed and walk over to him, I’m surprised to find him greeting me with a smile and a kiss.
We’re all Watsons now, in every way that counts, and I’ll protect this family to my last breath. I know they all feel the same.
The bus station is incredibly busy, and I really hope our bus will not be quite as full, or I will be hard-pressed to find a safe hiding place. Of course, that hope is futile. There are at least thirty people all storming at the luggage compartment as soon as the driver opens it, and there is no way I will find a free seat or stand in the corridor during the ride. When all is loaded and the driver is busy checking tickets and passports, I make a spur-of-the-moment decision to crawl into the still-open luggage compartment. I find a place in one of the back corners, curling up and draping the cloak around me securely. It will be uncomfortable, but less risky, though I hate to miss the spectacle when Sherlock will undoubtably get bored during the fifteen-hour ride. Even the thought is entertaining. At least he doesn’t have my weapon with him – it’s still safely packed in the backpack I’m curling around. Maybe he’ll just sink into his mind palace? That might end up with him missing his stop instead…
I glare at him even more, digging for all the anger I felt when I confronted him about this before. My voice turns to ice, sounding ruthless enough to rival even Mycroft himself.
“Forensics is something with dead people, right?”, she asks, and I can imagine the scathing remarks Sherlock would love to make at that perfectly.
“Thank you, Ms. Wagner”, Sherlock continues and accepts the proffered business card. “I do have a certain attachment to this case. I would dearly like to see it solved to the last detail. You have my number at the hotel, please do inform me if you find out anything new.”
“I overheard that phone call you made to Mycroft at the cemetery. I heard you tell him you needed transport there. You made a lot of mistakes, Sherlock. It was almost easy.”
“It is the name your force and many others know me by. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Weißmüller. You’re the forensic IT specialist on this case?”
He grumbles, but takes a bite, and seems to even enjoy it. When both of us have finished our tea and muffins, he looks at me thoughtfully.
I rise, and collect some of my things, most importantly my backpack and the cloak. I don’t quite trust Sherlock not to experiment with either, even while he’s busy with a case.
“I will be there and answer any questions your team might have after reading the files. Thank you for including me.”
The waitress is young and pretty, and the perfect opportunity to see how much I can mess with Sherlock. I act clueless at what she is saying, adapting an atrociously fake American accent. I’m not as good at accents as Sherlock, so I might as well use that to make Sherlock's ears hurt on purpose. She starts flirting, and I introduce myself as Hamish, just because Sherlock knows I hate my middle name.
“Nah. They wanted me to become a new figurehead, marry someone from the sect and raise a lot of good little believer kids. But I called in some favors, new identities, new life. Got close to being discovered some years ago when my new wife turned out to be one of them and found out who I was, but… we’ve managed.”
“Heidi ist keine zuverlässige Quelle. Es war ihr erster Einsatz dieser Art, und es war ihre verdammte Idee, diesen Idioten vorauszuschicken. Ich hätte es besser wissen müssen, als auf Anfänger zu hören.“
Every single other deduction he made about her was ridiculously stupid, and I could have thwarted them all with exactly the kind of logic he was so fond of. It might have brought him down a few notches, too – “I usually get one or two things wrong”, indeed. Try “I usually get one or two things right”. Alcoholism? Ridiculous. Harry doesn’t drink, it would interfere with her hormone medications far too badly. Shaky hands are just as typically a symptom of PTSD, as he could have seen easily from my own hands even if he hadn’t known before. Harry’s case of it is just as bad as mine, and the scratch marks on my phone are probably from both of us equally. And sure, alcoholics have a high rate of divorce – but in almost all cases, it’s the partner who leaves, and the alcoholic who keeps crying and drinking even more because of it. No, Harry’s marriage ended when Clara found out Harry’s birth name and reacted badly, threatening to blow our cover.
We’re in an interrogation room, and Sherlock is handcuffed to the table with both hands. Niedermayr is shouting at him, and Sherlock is shouting back just as angrily, which is never a good sign. I’d have wished this to end on a different note, but once again, Sherlock has managed to antagonize a police force he was supposed to be working with.
“I went in undercover as a customer before, and got a lot of information from one of the children. A Russian boy named Alexey. I’m afraid the proprietors of this establishment might figure it out and try to kill him during the raid to eliminate an important witness. I would very much like to prevent that. He risked a lot to help us.”
It is only a few stops to what I know from our earlier trip to be the main transfer point of the star-shaped network. It is not quite as crowded as in the daylight, but there are still a lot of people here waiting for trams or friends. Grinning wildly, I wave through the crowds, one hand always on the opposite wrist to track Sherlock’s position. He’s having trouble keeping up, and I wait on the corner of a side street at the other end of the plaza.
The scarf keeps moving throughout the night, and I hardly sleep because I check on it so often. I keep wanting to follow it, but I need to ensure things will go as planned back here. I need to make sure Harry, Mrs. Hudson and all our friends are safe when both Sherlock and I are gone, and that my absence will stay a secret as much as the truth about his “suicide”. I will not endanger his mission, even when I go out to save him, and I will not endanger the ones we love.
“Sit and calm down, you’re making me dizzy acting like a giggly teenager. I got ten minutes till I gotta leave. Start at the beginning.”
Sherlock’s new “business partner” walks him to the door, and I slip out while they are exchanging pleasantries. Going down the stairs either before or directly behind Sherlock has too many ways unfortunate sounds could arouse his suspicion, so I decide to stay on this floor until he leaves. He is still wearing his tracker, and even Sherlock will hopefully not get into trouble if I leave him alone for a few minutes. Both the man who lives here and I wait for until the front door falls shut behind Sherlock. With a sigh of relief, the specialist disappears in his flat, and I slowly start towards the stairs, listening from the slightest sound from below. It would be very much like Sherlock to close the front door from the inside and hide down there somewhere, though I can feel Sherlock’s tracker move away, so my paranoia is probably unjustified this time. The stairs still creak with every step, and I’m very glad I waited. This surveillance thing might turn out rather difficult if he continues to visit places like these, and I have no clue what methods of travel he might use. Some might be virtually impossible to accompany, but I’ll have to cross that bridge when I come to it.
Watching Harry turn into me is a scary sight. The potion seems to turn her inside out, and the expression on her – no, my – face afterwards matches the effect. Pain and disgust show clearly, and it’s disconcerting to see it on those features without feeling it myself. When she talks, it’s my voice, but with her cadence. Our dialects are similar, but something still feels wrong about it. My vocal cords trying to produce her voice. She frowns.
“Just like the cloak. Go choose a cover identity, something inconspicuous. Someone I might now. I’ll pack this.”
“I think you were”, she finally says. “I probably wouldn’t have let him go that far, but that sort of overreaction on my side is exactly why you’re far better suited to this sort of job than I am. I’m too hot-headed to play bodyguard, much less stay hidden, and Sherlock’s right. The way he treated the whole thing is probably the only way to investigate all this without endangering the victims in some way. He might even have to go further than that.”
Sherlock nods shyly and turns to his luggage, opening it with a key tied to his wrist. I smile at the scene. Sherlock hasn’t even considered a date with anyone in all of his life, as far as I know, and I’m reminded of all the dates he’s ruined for me over the last two years. The few women he didn’t scare away on the first evening quickly realized that I love him more than I could ever love them. It’s been obvious to anyone but him for a long time.
“Together with a few colleagues, yes. We stumbled across their branch in Lyon, then fanned out to see just how widely spread this network operated. I am the one who investigated the branch here.”
“I don’t know, but the facts I have don’t add up. Either he’s getting into troubles he really needs me for and is doing the nobly stupid thing trying to keep me safe, or there is something I need to finish solving for him after his death. Either way, I need to investigate.”
“I think I can manage that. I’ve already eaten, but if lasagna is okay with you, I’ll heat it up again while you’re in the bathroom, and we can have tea after that while you tell me what ‘weird’ entails.”
“You do smell like half a distillery burned down. Well done, out there. One point for you in the ‘flabbergasting guards’ game, but I’m still in the lead so far.”
We reach one of the small streets full of quaint little shops that Paris is so famous for, and I’m not all that surprised to see Sherlock enter a second-hand bookshop that looks like nothing in it was printed less than a hundred years ago. The shop is far too cluttered for me to follow into, not even to mention the bell above the door. I decide to wait outside instead, enjoying the beautiful evening air. Sherlock browses the shelves for a long time, finally settling on two ancient tomes whose titles I probably wouldn’t understand even if I could read them from my position. The shopkeeper wraps them up very carefully, which makes me smile. The way Sherlock will probably treat these books – the way he treats all his books – would abhor this man.
“I thought you knew me better. I need to make sure both of you are safe if we go through with this alibi. Can you please, please go there with her for me? I’ll tell you everything afterwards, but please, just trust me this once. Play a show, prove that you can be me for a while.”
There is a waiting room again, but unlike the one in Lyon, this one is not empty. There are children inside, and from the look of them, I have to revise my original theory of them merely being blackmail material for their mothers. They are just as much part of the merchandise.
I feel torn as to what to feel about the whole thing. Parts of me scream at me to turn away as I did in Lyon, that this is private, while others desperately want to keep watching. Some parts want to be deeply jealous that it’s not me Sherlock is caressing that way, others remind me that Faduma is exactly the type of woman I usually prefer. At the same time, I can’t help but remember over and over again that neither of them is quite doing this of their own free will. They are both forced to do this, even if they have very different reasons for it.
“Meh, you haven’t done so all morning, anyways. Might as well keep it on, it’s comfortable. Think you can correct the haircut to match?”
He actually laughs out loud, and I can’t help but join in. I let his arm go and grab my backpack instead.
The portkey’s tug on my intestines feels almost familiar the second time around, and I manage to catch myself far more easily now that I know what to expect. I am back in Harry’s dining room, and it almost feels like coming home. I put my coat and backpack on the table with the portkey, then leave the room in search of my sister.
Again, we catch a bus, this time out of the city center. Sherlock seems to have looked up the address and route, as we have to transfer three times before we finally reach a somewhat rundown business park on the edge of the city. Yes, this is more what I expected from an investigation with Sherlock Holmes. Hunting through the seediest parts of town, saving him from getting shot at and possibly shooting back. Of course we’ve also seen the other extreme before, especially on the Irene Adler case, but this kind of case seems to always be more exciting for both of us.
“I’m still Harry. Short for Harriet now in the new paperwork I’ll have to turn up, I guess. I like the name, it’s one of the few things I have left from my parents. I’ll have to change my last name, though, if I don’t want people to find me.”
“I remember the looks on those guards’ faces when you paid them for their role in that… I almost blew my cover trying to keep in a fit of giggles… that was one of the reasons why I provoked you so much at the bar today. To warn you how hard such things can get.”
“So, what are you in Augsburg for, Hamish?”, she asks when she brings my drink, and I improvise. Now what would make Sherlock laugh…
“Which would endanger him even further by blowing his cover, and drive the enemy underground”, Harry nods. “So you need my help.”
The thought scared me, and we ended up talking about other problems instead. I told him about my newfound sexuality, about having a boyfriend and still being very much interested in women regardless, and Harry admitted that he’d rather have been born as a girl. She hadn’t even told her friends at school yet, and I still wonder how, despite all that had happened between us, I suddenly became the first person she dared to tell. Maybe it was because I was so far removed from her daily life, but suddenly it all came bursting out. That the worst part of being called “the boy who lived” wasn’t everyone’s expectation to save the wizarding world, but the boy part. That she had found a new family who seemed to love her, but that they were just as full of expectations as my own. That the library at her school actually carried old tomes with spells and potions for a complete sexchange, but that her new family would probably never let her use them. She was dating their youngest daughter and wanted to marry her just like they expected, but her girlfriend was very much not into women and found even the thought of having a girlfriend disgusting. Both the girlfriend and her family expected Harry to father half a dozen children and start a perfect family.
He takes a plastic container of what’s obviously tradional, home-made falafel dough out of the fridge. I haven’t seen that in Europe before, even with all the international food London offers, and it reminds me of my favorite days in Afghanistan, patrolling market days. Two of my squad mates and I always enjoyed these simple meals that contrasted so much with what our military provided day-to-day, and we volunteered for those shifts more often than not. The tea here is good, too, hot and strong, and I relax. If there’s one thing Brits and Arabs can agree on, it is tea.
“Good morning to you, too, JD”, Harry says dryly. “I see you haven’t slept yet. Congratulations on finally having the guts to tell him after so long.”
I look at him worriedly, and it’s not even all pretend. Even if I’m pretty sure I know what brings him here, there’s always that off chance that it’s something related to our past instead.
Sherlock listens with rapt attention, then seems to decide it’s time for experiments. Sneaking around the room, he knocks on the window to make me jump, then tries to sneak past me to the door. I grab his arm to stop him.
Two days have passed since we left the dossier on Mycroft’s desk at the Diogenes club, hidden in one of the books Sherlock bought in Paris. Sherlock included a letter that he would not let me read, but from his wicked grin while writing it, I know that it Mycroft will probably be mad when he reads it. All that Sherlock told me is that he included a new cover name, one that meant we had to get a new room. We’ve used it as an excuse to rent a double room this time.
“Sounds about right. Two idiot boys in love, both too spineless to say a word. No wonder the whole world was making fun of you.”
“Sherlock sagt, Harry ist genauso deine Schwester wie sie meine Tante ist, und deswegen bist du jetzt mein Onkel. Und er auch, weil er dein Mann ist. Stimmt das?“
Harry, bless her heart, is preparing dinner for both of us when I return. She nods almost imperceptively when I silently climb back into the window, and shuts it behind me. I cross into the hallway through the open door and take off the cloak, putting it back into the hidden storage box. Then I cross back into the kitchen. If anyone is watching, they will see me come from another room – Harry has always been paranoid, and living with her and Sherlock has made me even worse. Harry turns around and smiles at me.
“The ballistic report came back, Mr. Poirot, or whatever your name is. The bullet that hid the guard was not fired from his gun, but his gun was fired, and my team members all agree that they heard two shots. The projectile from the guard’s weapon is still missing. So tell me, Jacques - where is that second bullet? Where is the other gun?”
I wanted to end this with that scene under the shower, before Sherlock even says a word, but that felt like too evil a cliffhanger to leave for even a day. I needed some cheering up, some actually John-and-Sherlock interaction after something so harsh, and I figured you might, too. More of that tomorrow.
As the tram frequency has been decreased for the night, I catch up with him regardless. We manage the way to the hostel without any more incidents, though it takes a while. Back in his room, I watch Sherlock sit down at the small table with a laptop he grabs from someone else’s luggage. He breaks the password on third try, and it amuses me to see him treat other people’s property just like he’s always treated mine. This is Sherlock as I know him, and he’s buying a ticket for a long-distance bus from Amsterdam to Lyon, leaving tomorrow a bit after noon. I guess we’re going to France next, probably to investigate whatever is going on with those single mothers he mentioned at the IT-specialist’s place. He’s using the identity of one Jegor Sokolov, probably to hide any connection to his activities here. The game is on.
Checking both Sherlock’s and Harry’s location through that wonderful tracking charm whenever either of them isn’t with me has become second nature ever since he started wearing that scarf almost constantly. I keep checking on the scarf at least hourly for days, but only a few hours before the funeral does it finally move. I really, really hope that Mycroft will not give it back to me as a keepsake at the funeral or store it with the rest of his possessions. For now, it is my only reliable way of tracking the elusive Sherlock Holmes, and it is also one of the best protections he has, even if he doesn’t know it. The way he usually wears it blocks shots to his heart and lungs at least from the front, and it is designed to keep his core body temperature at healthy levels no matter which crazy climates this adventure might lead him to.
Eventually, we walk up to a supermarket, and I buy a can of cheap beer, a miniature bottle of vodka, and a pack of cigarettes with a lighter. I can’t fake bad hygiene, but if I want to look like a drunkard, I should smell like it, too. I duck into a back alley not far from our mark, making sure there’s nobody watching.
Prancing around an unfamiliar town with an invisible Sherlock is more fun than I should probably be having on a case like this. Doing this on a Friday night, when all shops are closed but people are crowding public transport and most of the city center on their way to or from various forms of entertainment, offers some almost evil possibilities to challenge Sherlock’s improvisational skills. I decide to start out small. Public transport is one of the most obvious things he’ll have to face, so I start by walking down to the next tram station. The tram is filled with people, far more than when we went out late in the afternoon. There is almost no standing room left, and I try to be nice to Sherlock for now, leaving him the very corner so the only person he can fall against is me. When the tram hits a switch point, I can see Sherlock grab for a handhold. Quickly, I place my hand over his so nobody will notice the fingers that have appeared out of nowhere. I can feel him drag the cloak back over them.
“Leider spricht Herr Poirot kein Deutsch, so dass wir in dieser Vorbesprechung zumeist auf Englisch zurückgreifen werden müssen. Gibt es jemanden, der dem nicht folgen kann?“
The old lady behind the counter wraps up my order to go, and I sneak out as soon as she’s busy with the next customer, with the food packed in my backpack and the cloak draped securely over me, coffee in hand. The 3 line tram northward arrives mere minutes later, and I check on Sherlock’s location before every stop. A few stops before the last, I realize that there’s absolutely no chance this tram will go as far out of the city as Sherlock’s gone. I’ll have to find a bus or track him on foot. Getting out at the next stop, the tracker tells me it’s still more than two miles, though he’s already stopped moving. He must have taken a bus for that much of a lead. Of course, the bus northwest only goes twice an hour, and has only left ten minutes ago. I can probably manage a large part of the distance on foot in the time until the next one arrives.
He looks like he wants to argue, but reconsiders, and I start to gather the papers into a neat pile. Twenty minutes later, we’re all done. Sherlock’s in the guise of that Arab guy I saw in Lyon, and the papers stowed in my pack. I present Sherlock with the tea towel Harry magicked for me earlier.
I feel close to tears myself, though not for the same reason. How can I not tell this wonderful woman, who loves Sherlock Holmes like the son she never had, that I suspect he’s still alive? Lying to her feels like one of the worst and hardest things I’ve ever done, but I have no choice. And the driver is still listening.
When I left for Afghanistan after finishing my doctorate, Harry again tried to stop me. She offered to get me out of my contract in some way or other, but I refused. I knew I had to do this, for my own sanity, and eventually, my sister relented. Soon, I found out just how different she and I were. Both of us were good in a fight and would do whatever we had to – but while she had hated every minute of her war, I lived for mine. The adrenaline of working medical support right on the front line, saving people’s lives in the middle of a fire zone, made me feel alive for the first time in my life. All the risks just helped to make me work better than ever before.
From that first day, I was raised to believe that Harry was a freak and an abomination, and the right thing to do was to treat him that way. My parents mistreated him while spoiling me rotten, and I was rewarded again and again for treating him like my personal punching ball. Most of the other kids at school followed suit, and I never saw anything wrong about that – after all, that was exactly what my parents had shown me to be the normal way of life. Ever since I found out just how wrong that was, I cannot help but step in whenever I even hear the word “freak”.
“I have told you before that I am incredibly sorry about what my misjudgment made my brother go through”, he says stiffly. “I miss him just as much as you do, never doubt that. If I could take back my actions of so many years ago and prevent the death of my brother and everything that led up to it, I would.”
“Losing my balance and almost falling. Well spotted. I shared all of your rooms, I have to admit, even if I did try to give you privacy. But please, never travel by long-distance bus again if there is any way you can avoid it.”
We end up at a small internet café not far from the hotel, where “Djamil” checks routes to each of the other six locations on various methods of transportation. Finally, we take a bus to the main station, where he buys a ticket for a night train to Lausanne. I thank all the stars and gods available that it won’t be a bus this time. A train might not be all that much more comfortable, but at least I won’t need to cramp up in a luggage compartment – after all, trains don’t have those anymore.
Meanwhile, Harry found the girlfriend she had always been dreaming about. They had met in the muggle world, and Clara seemed to love her for who she was instead of only seeing “the boy who lived” as Harry exes had. I got a week of home leave when they finally got married, and again Harry offered to get me out. Get me away from being shot at, without repercussions, a nice job as a surgeon back home. I refused.
“I’m so sorry, John”, Mrs. Hudson says, and I nod. She still believes Sherlock and I were a couple all along – if only she knew how often I wished the same.
Even after the ceremony, Mycroft doesn’t attempt to talk to me or hand me anything, and I rejoice. My plan to track a dead man might just work out.
“Thank you for what you said to Mycroft. It means a lot to hear that, both what you said and what he answered.”
Sherlock’s mused grunt is almost, but not quite imperceptible, but the waitress probably thinks it’s coming from the next table.
I can’t help but be excited when he finally checks out of the hotel. Another city, another country, another adventure, always on the heels of Sherlock Holmes.
Diagonally across the street, I spot a tiny, hole-in-the-wall shop that is exactly what I was looking for. The sign proclaims home-made falafel, and it’s so small that there’s only room for three two-seater tables and enough room for one person at a time to walk past them to the counter. The only person inside is a man my age sitting at a table with tea and a newspaper, probably the proprietor.
I find her curled up on the couch with one of her cats, reading. Her whole face brightens when she sees me, and she drops the book mid-sentence to jump up and grasp me into a long, tight hug. I relax into it involuntarily, finally realizing just how exhausted I am now. When she finally lets me go enough to look at my face, she asks:
“It does make a great disguise. We could make it semi-official when we go back to Amsterdam, I do need some identities to set him on so he won’t get suspicious, and I already have enough of them myself really.”
Harry and I only saw each other during the summer after that. I picked up boxing as my sport at school, thinking it would be a good match for the bully I had always been. Instead, I suddenly found myself in one team with people exactly like the everyone I had ever bullied. Kids like Harry, who had always been at the bad end of all the jokes and picked up boxing to finally defend themselves. My whole worldview crumbled and keeled over, and it forced me to look at myself and what I had done.
As soon as the door closes behind us, Sherlock starts talking quietly, but rapidly, in Russian. The boy stares at him, then answers haltingly. Sherlock’s next words sound almost like a challenge, followed by a question, and a look of determination crosses over the boy’s face. He nods, and Sherlock grabs for his wrists, pulling him towards the bed.
After dressing, he settles on his bed with a book, and the threesome leaves shortly after. I doze off for a while. Sherlock getting up and digging in his luggage jolts me awake and I get up as silently as I can, ready to follow him. He’s dressing to hide this time, dark muted colors and a hood, but the scarf’s still coming. He’s obviously too attached to risk it being stolen, which works out rather nicely for my plans.
Typing out the first part of chapter 6 now, then rewriting the second half of it (which is where the gruesome parts of the case start and the first few warning labels apply). If you're lucky, chapter 6 will be online within the week... but wedding prep might prevent that, so no promises.
Her confidence in me helps immensely. I do know Sherlock, and I also know that he wouldn’t thank me for intervening too early. I have to believe we’ll all make it through this without major damage, or I’ll be a risk on this mission. We will save whoever the victims of this network are, and bring the people responsible to justice. I have to believe in that.
He hugs me again, then runs over to show Sherlock and explain. Harry looks at me questioningly, and I smile.
He actually smiles at that, and I busy myself with my backpack until the tea arrives. Out of habit, I fix  cups for both of us, then pass his over together with one of the huge chocolate muffins Harry packed for me from her bakery. I don’t know the secret to the spells on my backpack, but these are still fresh after days.
Sherlock actually blushes. I have no idea how he’s doing it, but he’s playing the insecure traveler incredibly well. It makes him look ten years younger than I know him to be.
“I understand. Every second counts for those kids, and for their mothers. Go deal with our third, I’ll come join you when I’m done.”
“I – don’t – know!” Sherlock screams. “I was as surprised as your people were when that guard keeled over! I thought they had shot him from behind! You checked my hands for gunshot residue! Both of your team members and the boy can testify my hands were empty and ungloved at the time!”
“Yes, you dolt. I’d never do anything to hurt you, and that won’t suddenly change just because we kissed. Besides, I’m not all that sure I could handle any kind of being intimate with you without bad memories myself, not after all I’ve had to watch this week. This will most definitely be enough for as long as you need it.”
“Oxana, so probably Ksyusha to her friends and family by Russian traditions, if you want to be realistic. So you and she talked about her and the child coming to live with you because things were bad for them down there, then they suddenly disappeared.”
I assume bagel duty easily, having helped out at the bakery every now and then before, and when Sherlock sees Harry whirling around doing everything at once, he actually offers to help on his own accord. The door opens while she’s still showing him how to assist with preparations.
He clings to me, sobbing, not even questioning my presence, and that alone tells me more about his state of mind than I would ever need. Sherlock Holmes does not switch off his glorious mind, not for anything, but now, he’s foregone all thinking. He sobs into my chest for a long time, clinging to my coat with both hands, and I pet his hand wordlessly. Finally, the racking sobs calm down, and he lets go enough to glance up at me.
Right, I remember. She spent most of the year she was seventeen on a somewhat similar odyssey, with two of her friends at the time, though that one mostly covered Britain.
I walk over and sit on the armrest of her chair, petting her head awkwardly. She hides her face in my chest, and I glare at Mycroft angrily.
“We both think he might be better off with someone who shares that protective streak, who knows what it’s like always having to save everyone. Someone who knows what it’s like to fight at that age, and won’t try to
The cardigan in question was originally made for men, and it’s covered in a black and white all-over pattern of skulls and Scandinavian star motifs, with brightly colored flames around all the hems. It is also about two or three sizes too small for me, as I only notice when I pull it over my head and feel it cling like a second skin.
“Oh yes. The loyal assistant, desperately mourning his fallen idol, avoiding the public who doesn’t believe anymore, stubbornly refusing to admit they’re right… add in the rumors about us dating that kept flashing up… the perfect human tragedy. I like it.”
As soon as I have closed the door, Sherlock pounces on me, snogging me against the wall forcefully. I comes unexpected, but not in any way undesired, and I press my body along the length of it, leaning into the kiss.
He seems to have guessed right, though, as the woman stiffen almost imperceptively, then answers just as softly in the same language. I catch what might be the name Faduma, as that is what Sherlock repeats, but the rest is utterly foreign to me.The way Sherlock glances around the room without moving his head makes me guess that she gave him some sort of warning about cameras somewhere in all that, and whatever he answers makes her almost smile.
Hours later, we are ready to go. Sherlock refused to be wired “in case they search me”, and I grinned at the thought. Armed and invisible, I follow him to the door of the establishment soon to be raided, knowing the police is watching. This is it.
The bus stops hourly on average, sometimes more, sometimes less, and each stop means securing my invisibility cloak and trying not to get crushed by the new luggage that’s being stuffed in. Sherlock’s suitcase next to me assures me that he’s still somewhere above, that I won’t accidentally lose contact despite him not wearing the scarf. It really would clash with Jegor Sokolov’s fancy clothes. Somewhere between Brussels and Saint-Quentin, I dig through my backpack for a big lunch. There is nothing in the backpack to occupy my time, as it’s far too dark for the novel I packed and switching on my flashlight seems risky and a waste of batteries, so thinking about what’s to come becomes the default thing to do.
“Did the great detective ever figure out how much you learned from him, or is he once again trying to fool you along with the rest of the world?”, Harry asks as she enters the room with a big tray of food. I return the grin.
I pull the small jewelry box from my pocket and open it. Inside is a deformed bullet, now firmly attached to a golden chain. I place it around Alexey’s neck.
Finally, Sherlock gives his companion a kiss on the cheek, then they rise from the bed. He hugs her goodbye, and she whispers a few words into his ear again. He nods briskly, then opens the door to leave.
“Heidrun Huber ist eine der vielversprechendsten Nachwuchskräfte, die wir hier seit vielen Jahren gesehen haben, und ihr Bericht deckt sich mit allen anderen Zeugenaussagen. Ich werde eine solche Verleumdung meiner Leute nicht dulden."
“They might still get suspicious if another English speaker comes calling so soon after me. Still too risky. How good is your German? Just enough to order tea? “
Still, my heart is racing. This is it. I’m about to join in a part of Sherlock’s work that I’ve not really been in contact with before, having always rather been one for the direct approach.
“I know, and I understand. I do love you, Sherlock Holmes. I would have stepped in even had I known I would die. You’re that important to me, and the work needs you.”
Mycroft is getting rather suspicious, but the combined protective streak of TWO Watsons does not make things easy.
The look Sherlock gives me can only be described as one of utter adoration, and it makes my heart speed up badly.
The inhabitant of the flat is snoring at his desk, half a dozen windows still open on the screen. Sherlock smirks in satisfaction – did he do something to drug the man while I was out of the room? -, then kneels down behind the man and picks up his mouse. He clicks around wildly, nodding every now and then, but I can’t see the screen from where I’m standing. The room is too small.
I manage to avoid all but the tiniest trace of accent, and the dialect I picked up while stationed in Northern Germany will probably cover that here in the south. Sherlock stares at me in amazement.
“What do you need to do?”, Harry asks finally, after granting both of us a break to eat some. Not “what do you want”, no – like any good soldier, she understands that some actions are pure necessity. I think for a moment.
“Now we only have to finish that report”, I cut in. “And the accompanying blackmail letter to Mycroft.”
Then, two weeks into my summer brooding, my teammate’s mother knocked on the guestroom door. “There’s a girl downstairs to see you. Dark hair, skinny, didn’t give her name.”
A server brings in a cart with selections from the breakfast buffet while Sherlock is in the shower, but when Sherlock returns, he hardly spares it a glance. The game is on, and Sherlock Holmes does not eat while he’s on a case. Instead, he lays down on the bed still wearing only a towel and falls into his typical mind-palace stance. This might take a while, so I settle into a corner and try to catch up on sleep.
The discussion between him and the shopkeeper turns more and more heated, yet somehow, Sherlock manages to make his fake accent get stronger the louder he becomes, which tells me none of the heat on his side is real. He seems to convince the stallkeeper of whatever he’s trying to achieve eventually, and the man relents. He passes Sherlock a note wrapped up with a watch. Sherlock pays far more than any of the price tags says, so probably some sort of information bought. With a nod, Sherlock dispappears into the crowd, and I have trouble following him without breaking my camouflage.
When Sherlock is done, he struts out in so ridiculously posh a manner that I wish he had Mycroft’s walking stick to complete the ensemble, as well as a servant to carry the small suitcase in his hand.
I have one more stop to make on our way home, one that Sherlock does not yet know about. I have asked Hettie to recommend a jeweler who does custom work some days ago while Sherlock and Harry were busy preparing for Alexey’s arrival, and I would love to hear Sherlock’s deductions when I pick up the small box today. As he’s still invisible, he does not get to make them out loud, nor yet get to know whether they were anywhere near the truth.
We zig-zag through side streets mostly downhill, past large fast food restaurants and yet more bars, and Sherlock is probably wondering where we are going and what I am looking for by the time we reach another main street. This one seems to be mostly for transit, as there are still a lot of cars passing by and almost no pedestrians near.
“Let me talk to them, first. Someone who first saw battle at eleven and managed to build themselves a life after years of fighting. Someone who might be a good example for him, one of the best people I know.”
Navigating the busy walkways past multiple museums while invisible proves a challenge, but I’ve done it in London before on the very few occasions Harry let me borrow her cloak. I have to swerve from the direct beeline route towards Sherlock twice until I finally find a bridge to cross the small river that suddenly blocks my way, then it’s mostly straight on.
“I couldn’t bear the thought of losing you. Not so soon after getting you back, after finally telling you what I feel. I'm sorry, John. I guess I never realized just how hard my faked suicide would hit you. I only thought I had to keep you and the others save. I didn't realize it would be this hard.”
We both are out of breath when we finally reach the hotel, but Sherlock doesn’t stop for a second until he’s reached his room. He rips the auburn wig and beard off his face forcefully, not even noticing the door swinging back open after it he almost smashed it in my face. His clothes are next, and he doesn’t even close the bathroom door before he steps into the shower. Almost as soon as the water starts running, Sherlock breaks down. I have never even seen him cry before, but now he is sobbing, sinking to his knees.
We’re in luck, as the guard opening the door is one Sherlock encountered on his previous visit, and he lets him in almost wordlessly. Sherlock pays him up front, and the guard picks up Alexey from the day room and leads them up the stairs. I stay behind, opening the front door a mere inch wide as soon as the hallway is empty. Then I hurry to follow.
“Boyfriend, actually”, Sherlock interjects shoothly. “I’m Bram. Short for Ibrahim. Lovely to meet you, Mrs. …”
“Your invisibility cloak, and an alibi for the next few hours. There’s something wrong with this, and I will find out.”
“The obvious reaction… John Watson, heartbroken and depressed, moves back in with his sister, only comes out to visit Sherlock’s grave every few days… I have about a week’s worth of polyjuice potion to pose as you every now and then, and I can always brew up more. It takes a month, but my stash should last that long easily.”
I reach for my backpack, digging. When Sherlock sees what I finally pull from it, he stares at me incredulously.
“Janus Cars, already solved that…”, he mumbles to himself, then: “boring… boring… obvious, boring… illegal arms trading, should probably stop that… boring… more going into hiding, boring… traditional terrorism, let Mycroft deal with that… boring, boring, boring… huh. Now that is interesting. All single mothers with one child, multiple nationalities…”
“See that shop over there?”, I ask and point. There is nobody near who might hear us talking, but Sherlock only gives a hum of agreement anyway. “I’ll go and buy dinner for both of us. If you manage to grab something small from the counter inconspicuously, maybe some napkins or some such, and eat what I buy for you – without taking the cloak off or breaking cover, of course, that will be part of the challenge -, I will grant you one wish or favor to be collected any time during the next week. Within reason, of course.”
I desperately wanted to help, but there was not a single thing I could do to ease the catalogue of problems haunting her, neither with the war nor with the personal issues. The only thing I could do was listen and be there for her whenever we could have time together without my parents noticing. We spent a lot of time together that summer, but it was the last time I saw her for more than two years.
I remember him telling me exactly that, about getting one or two things wrong, back when he made those ridiculous deductions about Harry on our first day together. I can’t help but tease him.
“Ich würde sagen, eigentlich ziemlich gut. War ‘ne Weile in Bergen bei Fallingbostel aufm NATO-Übungsplatz stationiert, und hatte danach auch noch öfter Gelegenheit drin zu bleiben.“
“And you think that won’t have consequences? You think he won’t start investigating where it comes from? You’re threatening to blow our cover sky-high, John.”
As soon as we’re inside our hotel room, I throw the invisibility cloak into a corner and find Sherlock suddenly clinging to me tightly. He is shaking badly.
“I love you, John Watson. Do be careful about your secrets, I might take an interest when this is done.”
“Let’s do this”, we mutter at almost the same time, and with her body changed into mine it sounds like a weird echo. Wound up as we are, it makes us giggle almost hysterically, as Sherlock and I so often did at crime scenes from that very first case. The thought makes me sober up immediately. Too much is at risk. I pull the cloak over me and the ridiculously loaded emergency backpack. I still haven’t dared to ask what kind of spell work is layered on to make everything fits inside, but with the contents of this unassuming pack, I could probably survive three apocalypses and a nuclear war. Even some choice items I snuck out of Sherlock’s personal belongings made it in there – they might prove useful.
The man greets Sherlock in English, and Sherlock’s West Asian accent is even stronger in his native language, probably because he’s gotten a lot more practice going undercover in Britain. More pleasantries and code words exchanged, the man finally invites Sherlock inside. This time, I barely manage to sneak inside before he closes the door again, and I accidentally brush against Sherlock’s arm in the process. He whips around, and I press against the wall as far away from him as I can. The cloak hides me from sight perfectly, but not from touch, nor any of the other senses. Sherlock frowns when he sees no one, then shakes his head.
I watch Djamil al Marad transform into Jegor Sokolov in a public restroom near Amsterdam Sloterdijk station the next morning. Sherlock actually deigned to have breakfast at the hostel before he checked out, probably because there won’t be enough input to really think about the case until we reach Lyon, so I managed to sneak healthy portions off the buffet when nobody was watching and he was seated at a table, and the big communal bathrooms with multiple shower stalls meant I could actually have a shower without fear of discovery. Two less things to worry about, so I can enjoy watching the transformation. The two identities have next to nothing in common. After Djamil’s beard already disappeared yesterday, the next step was a complete change of wardrobe. Compared to the height of fashion Djamil was wearing, Jegor’s choice of clothes seems almost out of this world. He’s the very image of a stuck-up aristocrat, in finery that might almost make Mycroft Holmes look plebeian. Sherlock only makes it worse by adding huge blond sideburns that make his narrow face look a lot wider, as well as a straight-haired blond wig that almost reaches his collar. The result looks like someone who belongs in the backseat of an expensive car, and the thought that he’ll soon be traveling in something  as common as a long-distant bus seems utterly ridiculous. This is quite obviously not an identity for stealthy operations, but for direct interaction.
After what might possibly be the most satisfying meal in my life, I catch her up on all that has happened, mostly sticking to the three situations with enemy contact and glossing over the rest. Harry is just as thrown as I was at the thought of how far Sherlock was willing to go at the last stop, and somehow, that gives me back some of my confidence.
“You’re better at that sort of search than me. I’d miss all of the most important things. Let’s switch roles for that plan.”
Once again, Harry had been in danger, and once again she had had to save herself. Once again, I had not been able to rescue her, just like I hadn’t been able to save half a dozen soldiers in the attack that injured me so badly. I was honorably discharged some weeks later, but refused to move back in with the sister I had let down so badly. Deeper and deeper I slipped into all those pesky PTSD symptoms, and only when I got sucked into the whirlwind life of Sherlock Holmes and had to kill to save him did I realize the truth: I did not see all my bloody failures flashing by because they scared me. I saw them because, crippled as I was, I did not have a way to save anyone else. Sherlock Holmes changed that.
“Single mothers with one child” is now underlined twice, probably to mark its importance, and connected to a scrap below it with the question “Where are the children? / Find my daughter”, which is in turn connected to every location but Lyon and Lausanne. “Separated at the airport”, “no drugs”. This looks like… human trafficking? Probably with a side of forced prostitution. Maybe blackmailing the mothers into compliance with threads to their children? Either way, very much not good, and exactly the type of thing I could see James Moriarty masterminding.
We stroll through the side streets for a long while, until it’s finally time to find our next bus. I wish fervently I could let Sherlock know I’m walking beside him, could joke around with him the way we’ve always done so well. But it’s too risky. I’m here to guard him, and nobody must know, lest we endanger this whole mission. The bus to Lyon is even fuller than the last, even though it is a night line. I’m getting cooped up even more in the luggage compartment, but I manage to fall asleep between stops regardless. Uninterrupted sleep is a luxury wartime rarely affords, and despite all outward appearances, this journey feels very much like going to war.
Sherlock struts through, and I shadow after him. Another guard lurks down the hallway, nodding to Sherlock in greeting as the door closes behind us.
He looks her up and down – the lithe form, black braid, brightly patterned cardigan covered by a dark red apron. He’s probably making dozens of deductions on the go.
[Nobody must know I’m here. I watch out for Jacques like you do for the other children. That works better when nobody sees me.]
“He deserved it, and he knows it. And it’ll probably help convince him I have no clue you’re alive, no connection to that case you’re in Germany for. And if it helps Alexey get here even one day quicker and with less trouble, all the better.”
[Unfortunately, Mr. Poirot does not speak German, so we’ll mostly have to stick to English in this briefing. Is there anyone who won’t be able to follow that?]
Whenever it all came crashing down on me, I grabbed my walking stick and hobbled for a walk, often for hours or even whole nights at a time. It was on one of those walks that I met an old friend from university. Unlike me, Mike Stamford had been able to afford his tuition without enlisting in the army, but we had shared a similar dedication to our studies and always made great study partners. Neither of us was a man of many words, and our contact after university had been accordingly sporadic.
It does sound like the title of a superhero comic we've all been waiting to read, does it not? Let's see what kind of shennanigans our beloved detective will be up to, and if John really will come to rue this decision...
“I know you’ve always said you wanted to have some. Would you raise one that isn’t yours? Would you care?”
“And honestly, why would you, if you’d just kill yourself afterwards? Even if you’d killed him in revenge for speaking the truth, there’s just no reason to cover up a murder if you can’t be prosecuted for it any more. And a fake you never could have managed the cover-up. So Moriarty had to be real, it couldn’t have all been a lie. Really, Sherlock, did you think nobody’d notice? Then I watched Mycroft identify that corpse that didn’t even look like you, when Molly Hooper was on a convenient leave of absence so she couldn’t correct the identification…”
I might have to warn Harry about that, but she’ll probably laugh it off. She believes Sherlock to be one of the good guys, and she’s right about it, too. He might be deeply curious, but he’s just as loyal as we are.
We end up on the bed facing each other, kissing over and over again, holding hands and looking at each other.
“Alright. But I expect answers, John. Real answers. I need to be sure nothing will endanger this mission. I need to make sure you won’t. Moriarty’s web needs to fall.”
Yes, sister dearest, I get the hint. Now please tell me how the fuck I’m supposed to solve this mess – are you deliberately challenging me to make me turn back from my plans?! Mrs. Hudson pats “his” arm.
“I feel like I hardly know you. Even I never bothered to learn this ridiculous language. Then what are we waiting for? Let me practice!”
“We’re going out for drinks downtown tonight, wanna come?”, the brunette girl asks, gesturing at the three of them. Sherlock shakes his head.
“Guten Abend. Hier ist Zimmer 317. Könnten wir vielleicht eine große Kanne Tee mit zwei Tassen bekommen?... Ja, 317, genau. Danke. Einen schönen Abend Ihnen ebenfalls.“
“Of course it will, if you practice enough beforehand to avoid risky situations. A few hours should be enough, knowing your speed of figuring things out. And I think Harry won’t rip off my head too much if I tell her why we needed you to be the one wearing it. This would be a case she’d wholeheartedly support.”
His face is still insecure, far beyond anything just about anyone might ever associate with him. It throws me so badly I can’t stifle the urge to react sarcastically.
There’s only one person I know who’s been through that much at such a young age. Someone I’ve realized before is a lot like that kid, and more importantly, someone who’s complained about not having children before. Someone I vowed only last night to talk to more often, and who still doesn’t know what happened between Sherlock and me. I frown thoughtfully.
“How long did you plan to give detective-or-whatever Wagner until you disappear? I didn’t believe that nonsense about a week for a second.”
[I’d say pretty well, actually. Was stationed at the NATO training ground in Bergen near Fallingbostel for a while, and had opportunities to stay up and using it every now and then after that.]
“From what I know, Sherlock can take a lot of things he usually dislikes when it’s for a case. Solving that sort of crime keeps him going even through really bad experiences. And you know him better than anyone else in this world, probably. Watch him closely, and I’m sure you will be there to intervene when he’s nearing his breaking point. I know you, JD. You won’t let it get that far, you’ll step in before some case or other breaks him, and you’ll know when it’s time. That’s why you’re doing this ridiculous thing, after all.”
It might take some weeks or so for me to start posting that one (I do have novels to work on, and numerous shorter non-fanfic works currently brewing - wrote one near-future urban fantasy short story between finishing this and starting on the sequel, and will probably need to get some more out before I really start working on this again), but I'd be glad if some of you would join me for the ride!
We catch a bus, then a tram, and when I see where he’s getting off, I get a strong feeling I know where he’s going. Indeed, he’s soon ringing the IT-specialist’s doorbell. When nobody answers, Sherlock nods with a smile, and pulls out this trusted old lock-picking tools The door is open in seconds, and I use the same sneaking trick as last time to get up the stairs. The flat door is even easier to pick, pried open with a simple credit card. Sneaking in past him is easier, too, as Sherlock pauses in the hallway listening.
“I need to find him. The ridiculous idiot is probably trying to break down Moriarty’s web solo, to keep everyone else safe. He’ll kill himself for real that way. I need to support him, preferably without either his brother or Moriarty’s henchmen finding out.”
It doesn’t feel right to talk about the case here, not when we’re not alone in the bakery, so we keep working till noon, only interrupted by tea breaks every now and then. All the food around us seems to incite Sherlock’s appetite, and he actually eats what we place in front of him. Sherlock dons the cloak before Hettie’s son Adam relieves us at noon. We walk back to Harry’s place, Sherlock invisible for fear of anyone recognizing him, even in this guise. It would be all over the news by tonight, and there are too many who are paying close attention to anyone in my presence.
I’m deeply relieved when finally we reach Paris and I see Sherlock’s ridiculous sideburns as he fishes for the suitcase next to me. We have almost three hours of transfer time, if I remember the information on the laptop yesterday correctly, and I desperately need a bathroom break as well as some moving around to minimalize the risk of thrombosis after being cooped up for so long. It seems Sherlock has had similar thoughts, and we hit the station bathrooms together after he locks up the suitcase in the provided lockers.
“Sherlock, this jokester’s my sister, Harry Watson. We’re at her place of work, a small bakery in Kensington, because she’s been working far too much lately.”
“Ich will doch nur mal ein paar Stunden vergessen, dass sie weg ist… Bitte, Kumpel… Das Bier reicht einfach nicht…“
We’re down the street from Harry’s house when one of Mycroft’s cars passes by us. Even I can deduce what that means, and it makes me suddenly hurry up. I can feel Sherlock’s hand grabbing mine while I unlock the door, so he’s probably deduced the same – and we’re both right, too.
I really shouldn’t overdo this, because Sherlock is getting angry. Getting Sherlock angry always has dangerous consequences.
“Slowly. Learn the ground rules first, then practice. There’s quite a few things you need to look out for if you don’t want people to notice you. This is not a magic ring you place on your finger, it only makes those parts invisible that it covers. Try it.”
When I close the door behind us and turn back to the room, I suddenly feel lips on mine. On pure instinct, I respond, but the kiss is over far too soon.
We port back to Baker Street right from the IT specialist’s office, and I say goodbye to Mrs. Hudson as soon as we’ve gotten rid of our camouflage. She does not need to know that the things in the bag I carry are not from upstairs, but were only bought today.
“I did what I had to do. The war’s over, the monster who killed my parents is dead, and now I’m done doing what everyone wants me to do. I’m leaving that world. I’m leaving everything. Wanna come with?”
Sherlock struts out the door and down the street confidently, and I follow. As soon as we are out of sight of the building, he glances back, and his content smile has morphed into a grimace I have never seen before on his face. Then, he starts running. I have trouble keeping up with him, trying desperately not to let the cloak blow away, but somehow I manage. In a way, this reminds me of the last time we ran like this, on our last case together in London right before he “died”. But this time, we’re not just running to escape police custody, not just trying to wash Sherlock’s name clean. This time, there are dozens of lives at stake, people who are going through hell over and over again.
“He tries to get all the most dangerous clients away from the others, especially from the younger ones. He even taught himself to speak German from listening to the guards, just to be able to talk the clients into switching choices. It didn’t always work, but often enough to scar him badly. We need to get them out of there, all of them, but the way these houses are linked… this isn’t even the only one with kids. We’d have to hit all of them at the same time, and wherever the leaders are holed up, too. How are we supposed to that, just the two of us? I haven’t even found out where the leaders are, yet.”
I lean against the wall outside the door, not willing to watch what is unfolding inside the room. The sounds are very much enough, and they seem to be going on for a long time, though my watch tells me otherwise. Finally, it is over, and the two guards drag Sherlock out of room and down the stairs. I follow quietly. In front of the entryway, they forcefully turn him around and demand something. Sherlock nods and very slowly reaches into his coat. They watch him with obvious distrust, ready to manhandle him at any moment, but he only pulls out a big bunch of Euro bills. With a smile just as leery and malicious as the one the guard gave him earlier, he counts out what is probably the amount the two guards demand, gestures up the stairs with a few words and hands it over to the guard. Then, he counts out two more sums, gestures to each of the guards in turn and hands that money over as well. Both guards react in shock and anger, the second one actually going as far to punch him in the face. Then, they push him out the door violently and swear at him while he struts away grinning.
Harry opens the door under the watchful eye of Mycroft’s driver, who will surely report back to him. The first thing she does is pull me into a tight hug, the kind that seems to be reserved for when we first see each other after some life-changing event or other. Our lives have seen too many of those by now.
The card connected to Lyon on the map by a yellow string is one of the few that are almost full, and I try to get close enough to read it without getting too close to Sherlock, but it proves impossible. I have to wait until Sherlock finally lays down on the bed and sinks into his mind palace. I lean over the chart and study it, beginning with the Lyon card. On top is what’s probably the address from last night, followed by a few notes like “only entry: front door”, “guards suspicious now” and my favorite in word choice, though not in content: “lim P(office access) -> 0”. It is very much like Sherlock to phrase such things in mathematical formulae.
No, it was that phone call that was the lie. Another trick to thwart some sort of final game his arch enemy James Moriarty set to roll at the time of his own death. That’s the only thing to make sense – if Moriarty’s claims had been true, as his true name been Richard Brook, there would not have been a reason for Brook to kill himself, and I saw his corpse. All the evidence points against murder, even one committed by Sherlock Holmes at the height of his game.
[Heidrun Huber is one of the most promising junior officers we’ve had here in years, and her report matches every other witness statement. I will not allow that sort of defamation of my people.]
“Let’s suppose I had heard these names before and could offer the kinds of services you seek. What kind of shenanigans would you need them for, and what sort of compensation could you… friends offer for this work and risk?”
“That sarcasm of yours hit surprisingly close to the truth, to be honest, even if it was the wrong order of events. I imagined something quite like what you described to keep my cover. After all, I couldn’t exactly have them see me not react after using the cover story of a wife who’d never blow me…”
Did he just… I shake my head in amazement, barely managing to stifle a laugh. Yes, it seems like in a spontaneous bout of malice, he paid them just as much as the whore herself for their role in this escapade, to make it look like this was exactly what he wanted when he came to this place. That is exactly the kind of messing with people’s minds that Sherlock enjoys, and it will provide reasonable doubt towards whether he was some sort of spy, covering his ass while ruining their day by making them feel used at the same time. They keep swearing madly, and finally disappear in a back room. As soon as the door closes, I open the front door silently and hurry after Sherlock, finally catching up with him at the bus stop. He glances around almost paranoidly until the bus finally arrives, probably hearing my footsteps and fearing that one of the guards is following him.
“My real parents died when I was a year old, and Hettie’s been substituting since I started working here in my late teens. She’s the best.”
Yes, I think I lied at the beginning of this story. For you to understand what is happening now, two years after that, and especially what will happen in the near future, you need to know who Harry and I were before. I need to tell you my birth name.
I don’t have to wait long. Only a few minutes after I arrive, Mycroft Holmes and his ever-present assistant arrive in the wake of a morgue employee I have only seen very few times before. Sherlock preferred to deal with his friend, Dr. Molly Hooper, but she, like all of his closer acquaintances, have been given a week of paid leave starting today.
I’ve only inspected about half the notes, nor figured out what the various colors of connections mean, before Sherlock returns, wearing only a bathrobe. I have to scramble out of the way to let him look over the evidence again, adding a few more notes and deductions that probably came to him in the shower. Then, he rolls the whole thing up again tightly to hide it away. He pulls out some pajama pants and his scarf instead, getting ready for bed. Soon, he is curled up beneath his sheets, hugging the scarf to his chest tightly as a child would his favorite stuffed animal.
Both of us have been edgy ever since we got back, and for long stretches, kissing has been the only thing that kept us sane. We have not dared to leave the room even to inform Alexey of our plan, for fear of not being here when Interpol calls. Warning him will have to be part of whatever plan we make once we know what the police is going to do. Neither has Sherlock dared to take off the wig and beard of the French “businessman” and undercover agent he’s used here before, as he does not want the police to figure out his real identity.
Sherlock launches off into a whirlwind explanation that hints at a lucrative combination of smuggling and international terrorism, without ever stating anything truly incriminating outright. He’s far too good at this, and I tune out quickly. The self-proclaimed “IT-specialist” listens with rapt attention, apparently very much in favor of this business proposal. I look around the room and the ones I can reach without opening doors instead, but apart from this one small office, which contains nothing but computers and computer parts, this seems to be the very typical home of a young single man, so I finally go back to watching them. It seems that they come to a mutually beneficial arrangement, as Sherlock eventually hands over a memory stick and they agree on another meeting within three weeks, which apparently is the time completion of the first sample identity will need.
“That should be enough for now. I’ll brief Alexey before he is rescued – mother’s cousin Harriet Watson in London, who they were trying to reach when they were abducted. Anything else they’ll probably ask you, not him. He was too young on that trip, and too much has happened, since. Improvise.”
Mycroft frowns, then spots the black-and-white fur ball curled up in the chair. He sits down on the couch instead, and I take the seat next to him. A moment later, he jumps. Wordlessly, I reach under the couch, grabbing Remus by the front legs and pulling him out. The red tabby hisses at me.
“Was kann ich für Sie tun?” [what can I do for you], he asks, and I study the small menu on the counter.
“Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit!”, he mutters. Obviously, this order of events was very much not how he expected the whole thing to go. He lies on the bed staring at the ceiling for a while, obviously trying to figure out a plan of action. Finally, he gets up with a sigh and starts digging through his suitcase, pulling out a large rolled-up puzzle mat and a pile of pins. He unrolls it on the desk and pins a small map of Europe in the middle, marking various spots on it, then writes down addresses and such on pieces of paper and pins them around it. Obviously, this is to become a portable version of the case-note wall he used at Baker Street to sort various clues, and he always took a long time working on that. As soon as Sherlock takes a bathroom break – even he has to listen to at least some of his “transport’s” needs -, I pull out the portkey from my coat pocket and activate it with a few quiet words. This might be the perfect chance to visit Harry and bring her up to date as to what is happening.
