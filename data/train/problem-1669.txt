“So am I,” John replied softly. He kissed Sherlock, hand sliding into his curls. “We should go home.”
“The Prince will catch you,” Sherlock said. “And he’ll hang you all from the tallest tower with the shortest rope.”
Holmes shrugged off his own hurt and fear and held up the bandage. “Will you show me how to do it properly?”
“My brains, his steel, your strength and some insider knowledge against sixty men and a castle full of guards…and you think a head shake will make me happy?!” John groaned. “You should have left me dead.”
"Can you? That's brilliant, it'll be easier than a cab." John held Sherlock's hand firmly, rubbing soothing circles over his palm. "Keep your eyes closed, dear, you're just fine."
“Hello everyone,” Lestrade said cheerfully. “I know it’s tradition for the best man speech to go before tea, but it’s also tradition to have only one best man and several more boring people here, so I reckoned we could do away with that.”
“Escort the Princess to the honeymoon chamber,” Jamiarty told his parents before dashing out of the room.
"Thank you," Holmes replied. He smiled at John. "Ah, John. Good to see you're well. They found you, then?"
“Oh I expect more than one, if the two of you are amenable.” Mycroft’s eyes were twinkling. “You see, I wish to perform a marriage this evening.”
Now he watched his sleeping lover, his throat tightening. Sherlock’s arms were locked around him in desperation, chest and back muscles strained. John moved his hand to the small of his back, trying to soothe him without waking him up. Sherlock was coming down from pure terror, and John swallowed guiltily.
Kitty, despite loving kids, doesn’t think she’ll be a good mum. Stan doesn’t think he’ll ever be a father. They’re both wrong.
The train ride was long and hard, bitterly cold even wrapped up, and Holmes felt the beginnings of a fever seeping into his bones. He was coughing by the time he finally got to London. Spending an hour at the station attempting to catch the attentions of a cabby hardly improved matters, and now it was all Holmes could do to dig out two pound notes and hand them to his cabby. He waved off the thanks and stumbled up the seventeen stairs. The clock chimed midnight as he reached the top, and he groaned. "Happy Christmas," he muttered under his breath.
“Sher, listen to me.” John cradled that dear face in his hands. “I love you so much. You know that. And I hate Jamiarty almost as much. But the love eclipses the hate with no question. And I want a future with you, with our family, where we can be free of his influence. If he dies, we’ll never hear the end of him.”
"Sherlock!" Watson chastised, looking about nervously. "You didn't really...you couldn't have really thought..."
“I didn’t come in the normal way,” Sherlock croaked. “But no matter. Where is Eria, that young one? She was helping me yesterday.”
“She’s technically Extra right now,” Raz answered. His eyes were overbright. “The Crown’s loss, my gain. Please help her.”
Kitty leaned against him, her arms still at her sides, but she offered no resistance to the embrace.
John glanced over at Sherlock, who was nodding off in the seat next to him. They'd chosen to go south for their honeymoon, to Bermuda in fact (this had been settled by a game of darts). What John had not factored in while debating different sunscreens and hotels and things to do (they were not going to go diving for sharks, he didn't care if it was mostly safe, he wasn't going near predators on purpose on his honeymoon) was that Bermuda was far away.
"Oh don't be silly, Molly's plenty." Molly pulled some T-shirts and a pair of jeans out from the bag. "I hope you like the colours. You can keep them as long as you like."
"So you're telling me you were looking in the window and didn't see who was next to you?" Greg's eyebrows were raised.
I just laughed, for if I know my husband and my surrogate niece I know two things for certain. The first is that we will both speak to Hopkins, and make it clear that he should have Kitty’s best interests at heart. The second is that Kitty will have prepared him for this talk, and will make a scene of great distress and enjoy herself hugely.
John watched them go with a fond smile. He turned to Greg, who he was surprised to see was scowling. "What?" he asked, suddenly apprehensive. Greg surely wouldn't have hired someone if he had problems with their gender identity, would he?
Soon—all too soon, but there was time for that later—Holmes pulled away, swiping at his eyes. “Would you like to see the garden? And the bees?”
“Yes. He and his Watson had defeated Moriarty, but...well, I changed my mind after I spoke to him. After I...after we...”
“As to worrying about being King…” Sherlock shrugged. “I took Princess lessons for three years, and I never felt ready to be Jamiarty’s Queen, even when we agreed not to be in love. When I asked the King, he told me that it was a living job. You’re never ready for all of it. You have to love your people and do your best, and if you can commit to that and your Queen, you will get through.”
“I couldn’t agree more, my dear…John.” Billy felt a strange lump in his throat; he’d never heard anyone’s name spoken with that much reverence. “Well, Billy, you’ll hear a story tonight you must never tell. Your Mum and Dad know most of it, but we never have told one part, not to anyone.”
“I have to go,” Sally replied. “I need to do this. Florin is in trouble, and if I can save it…if I can save it from Jamiarty, I will do whatever it takes.”
And if anyone wanted to fight him on it…well, he still ran rooftops twice a week. They were welcome to try.
John grinned as Rachel explained her latest games with the unshakeable gravity only four-year-olds possess. Sherlock was all attention, offering advice on dealing with troll queens.
They didn’t talk during the short ride, still hand in hand. Sherlock wasn’t even looking out the window, trying to deduce anything. He was looking at John, and John felt a strange kind of lump in his throat. He couldn’t see Sherlock’s face all that well, but the brief flashes of streetlight gave him a hint, a glance at the kind of love he’d been so lucky to find. To have.
The last robe was huge—it could have fit Grezzik without trouble. It was bright as the dawn, with oranges, reds and yellows competing for attention. It sparkled, and Sally realized that it was made entirely of jewels—rubies, topazes, amber, and others she didn’t recognize.
Queen Bella touched her husband’s arm. “How did you find out, Sally dear? Did someone threaten you?”
Faithful Skull was waiting for him, and Sherlock swung himself up for his daily ride. He rode hard that day; Skull hardly had to be told to go faster. If was as if he sensed his master’s turmoil.
Lily and Jacob are their only blood children, but when the twins are eight they decide to become foster parents. Sherlock and Kitty find children among the Homeless Network, and a little bureaucratic meddling means their house is full of kids for years. Mike retires to become a stay-at-home father.
And yes, I brought Ireni back. I didn't want to kill her in the first story (even though that's what happens to Vizzini), but she was going to be too much trouble. She's helpful now!
John smiled, though it was crooked. “Should have taken you up on your offer, I suppose. But I thought…there was a moment when I knew I was dying.”
“At last, he gets it!” Jamiarty clapped his hands. “Yes, of course I’m clever. It’s been fun playing stupid, but time for the charade to end.”
"Don't be cruel, John," Sherlock said mildly. "Your Uncle Mycroft has a similar set he doesn't use, Kitty. I'm sure if you asked nicely you could go and borrow one. You'd better be quick, though. Mrs. Hudson will be back in an hour."
They reached the bridge to Florin just before noon. To Sherlock’s relief, Jamiarty hadn’t implemented his bridge guards despite London technically being its own small country.  They crossed the bridge, John keeping a hand on his sword. When they’d crossed, Anderson led the way into the woods.
"Better to go now, don't you think?" Donovan asked soothingly. "He's cruellest to those who disappoint him. you've seen that. Don't let him find out those things on his own. Make some excuse. I can help you find a cheap flat if you like—"
“I’m trying to give you a chance. Prince Jamiarty will find you, and he will take your life for taking me.”
“Are we sure you should be travelling?” John asked. “You’re still not fully well, and it’s a long journey.”
“Alright,” Janine said. “You know you’re in trouble, Riley. What you may not know is that everyone in this room is willing and able to kill you, and several of us have no qualms about killing you painfully. Those are facts. It is up to you whether you want to take those facts into account.”
And Maria attacked, attacked using the same moves she’d used on the Cliffs, but the Count wasn’t the Man in Black, and he backed up desperately.
“Please, John. If I'm wrong, we can stop this for Sherlock. Come to my place, it's on Alder Road. We can talk it out.”
Poor Stan, who'd done much of the physical work the last few days, fell asleep fairly quickly, but Kitty couldn't sleep. She watched her fathers, knowing that the moment she closed her eyes, they'd fall asleep too and never wake up.
“No, I did not want a dress. I just wanted to match you. Do keep up, John.” Sherlock turned to Kitty. “You want to know what I finally decided?”
The giant approached him. “Then there will be no one to hear you scream,” he said in a thick Turkish accent.
The wedding started twenty whole minutes early, but Sherlock didn’t mind. John could just as easily be early, and he would be looking his best. He’d designed the wedding costume back when he was committed to the marriage, and it was lovely. Diamond blue and shining, it draped his body well, and contrasted beautifully with the pearl-encrusted tiara.
“I agree, but perhaps it would be better to keep moving,” Holmes replied. He drew Watson close and they proceeded, walking arm in arm instead of hand in hand.
“We’re the farthest fucking thing from traditional—I’m a retired sex worker, he’s a cop, we’ve been living together for two years, I just…why is this what I want?”
The story came out in broken phrases, combined with apologies and sobs. Sherlock barely heard half of it; he was too busy berating himself. Of course Moriarty would have chosen a case with children involved as his final touch—Donovan came from an abusive family, and she'd always had a soft spot for children. Of course Sally would have jumped at the chance to destroy him—she'd hated him from the first time they'd met, when he'd flirted with her for a chance to get into a crime scene, then cut her cold once Lestrade saw his talents and allowed him to consult. Of course Sally would believe 'Richard Brook', who hated Sherlock just as much and wanted to bring him down.
Mike had resigned himself to a single life well before he introduced John to Sherlock. He just didn’t see why anyone would put up with him.
Holmes had taken the train up north, where he discovered to his great grief that Lord Conan had indeed been killed—at his own request. His eldest daughter, Holmes' friend long ago and now the mother of five, tearfully confessed to increasing the dosage of her father's medicine after he'd begged to be put out of his misery.  Holmes commiserated with her, covered up suspicion by announcing his fervent belief that the old man had died of a heart attack, and the doctor's incompetence had led to this suspicious atmosphere. How he'd wished that Watson could have been there.
Sherlock drew John back, holding him against his chest. “I believe John has found the better solution, Mycroft. This changes little, you know.”
They rode on that afternoon, with the sun now over their right shoulder as it set. The air was warmer with every mile, and the cloaks were becoming oppressive. When they stopped for the night, Sally shed her wrap with a sigh of relief.
Not ten minutes later, Watson came downstairs, his legs threatening to give out from the peculiar combination of joy and exhaustion that accompanied every delivery.
“Yes, I have.” Cerise stood tall. Her face was tearstained as she looked at Jamiarty. “You will be kept in the Zoo of Death, from now until the end of your days. You will be in a cage, surrounded by other beasts, and you will be an example to anyone who visits there. It will no longer be a hunting preserve, but an educational one. Carla loved animals, after all. Anyone who aided you will join you there, chained without magic.”
“Precisely.” The dim light from the street lamps still showed the fond expression on Sherlock's face. “You've always had a way with words, Doctor.”
John, the mask had come off in the tumble and it was his face, his eyes clear, his gentle smile, though it looked worried now. He crawled over to Sherlock quickly.
Greg whistled. “Blimey, that’s a real small wedding. My sister had a ‘small’ wedding that was over a hundred.” A thought occurred. “Are you going to have attendants?”
The next few hours passed in a blur, as Maria, Grezzik and Stam (he didn’t like being called Mikey) helped to gather ingredients. Stam snuck to the castle at one point to look at the festivities and gather information. He came back in time to see Miracle Max and Martha applying a coat of chocolate to the pill.
Sherlock only had time to have a few mouthfuls of cheese before the mysterious man in black yanked him to his feet. “We’re going.” He began to run, dragging Sherlock by the hand.
The last case we worked, published under the name ‘The Adventure of the Illustrious Client’, was finally wrapped up judicially. Miss Winter was cleared of all charges
“Regalia already has people on their way,” Sukiv growled. “They’ll be on the London border by sundown.”
“To stop Prince Jamiarty, of course. Whether that’s by war or other more diplomatic means, he cannot be allowed to continue this way.”
Holmes glanced up. He and Watson had spent the last two hours exploring the ship and then attempting to find their bags, which had mysteriously disappeared from where they’d left them. A deckhand had finally told them that their belongings were safe but they weren’t to disturb the several locked rooms. It was enormously frustrating, and if Mycroft had not been aboard the ship Holmes would have taken Watson and escaped via on of the lifeboats.
Sherlock entered the suite. It was a lovely room, supposedly, but Sherlock hardly saw it. Sally was there, her eyes huge.
Sherlock shuddered. They hadn't talked much about what happened in the Zoo of Death, partly because John wasn't willing to go into details, partly because Sherlock had guessed some of it. But the nightmares were there, the Machine was explained, and the hardest part was watching John wake up one morning to Stam calling and breaking into a cold sweat, curling into Sherlock's arms like he was trying to disappear.
Kitty looked away. "Alright, fine." She sat down at the table and picked up a pencil. "Graph paper, please."
“We need to keep things diplomatic,” Mycroft warned. “Make sure those you send for understand that we might be taking down a prince, but a princess is there to take his place.” May the Powers will it so, at least.
"Of what?" Sherlock asked. "Of us?" His face grew more serious when Stan looked away. "Why on earth?
Four months before the five hundredth anniversary of Florin, the messengers went out, officially announcing the betrothal of Prince Jamiarty to Princess Sherlock of London.
Sherlock stopped swimming. It didn’t help. The moon came shining down again, and he saw a large body move through the water not far from him.
“Well, he normally does it with books. He insisted on reading outside so Mummy wouldn’t fuss at him for exercise—he needed it even then—and the sun was his constant enemy. He kept trying to make the light fall differently, but he would always end up holding the book the same way without even realizing.” He sighed. “Should have known then he was going to be a controlling, stubborn…”
"You told me that you desired me when we first...came together. That we oughtn't do anything about it, because the risk was too great, but you wanted me to know that if we could have been safe, that you would want to."
John smiled to himself as he heard Mycroft and Greg chatting with Mrs. Hudson downstairs. It wasn’t an occasion, exactly, but it was the first Saturday night all summer when everyone was off and there were no murders to be solved. John had put his foot down. They were having a family dinner.
He hung up; what was the point of going on? There’d never been enough time to say everything to Sherlock.
Molly listened as Moran outlined the plan, to use Waverly to start a war, and felt absolutely sick to her stomach. “Fucking monsters,” she snarled. “She’s an infant.”
Ireni pouted. “Oh, that’s so simple! All I have to do is take what I know of you, and deduce whether or not you’re the type of man to put the poison in his own glass.”
Mary came to love Sherlock—platonically, closer to a brother than a friend. She even managed to forgive him for loving John, and allowed them time alone. After all, she trusted her husband. (Watson never disappointed her).
When everyone had finished cake (even Mycroft had a piece—both Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade insisted) Lestrade got to his feet and tapped his glass. It wasn’t really necessary; there were only ten people in the hall, but it did get everyone’s attention.
Mr. Forrester’s eyes twinkled. “He only had to be here twenty minutes ago. He’s more eager than many a lad I’ve seen.”
Moriarty giggled. "Oh, the big guns aren't here. Well, one of them's...somewhere around here, telling you exactly where would be cheating. There's one near Scotland Yard as well, and one just across from your flat. Big is a relative term, but I'd say they're guns you need to worry about."
“Sally,” Sherlock said, and he didn't know how he was still so calm, how he could sound so cold. “Sally, where is John?”
Bertie Gruner was one of the most famous men in London. Well known for his philanthropy and sound business sense, Gruner was a regular face in the more respectable newspapers, a constant presence at society events, and a three-times heartbroken widower.
Horror struck, Watson moved his hands to Holmes’ face. “Don’t you dare think that. Ever. That isn’t true.”
A few years later, Molly returned to that town. Waverly had a new husband, a newly-man named Tristan, and a baby at her breast. When Molly asked about the woman that night, Waverly shrugged. “I didn’t notice her, sorry. And we don’t have many Natives living around here, and none fit that description.”
The floors of the Summer palace were all thin carpet, perfect for ocean-soaked bathers returning to the halls. It also made their footsteps nearly silent, and Sally led her party in total quiet to the library.
I reached out and took her hand. Her eyes were brighter now, perhaps, but there was still a shadow there of remembered loneliness and fear. I remembered seeing that expression in the mirror.
“I understand Holmes and I,” Watson replied. “I must, after so long.” He paused. “I don’t like this much, Mr. Holmes, but it is how we must be. I am willing to live this way.”
Kitty bowed her head. "I suppose it's better...better that you’re together, isn't it?" Stan took her shaking hand in his.
With Molly's help, Sherlock positioned the dead body near the window and draped the dusty curtains over it. Moriarty wouldn't come into this room, but it would be the first place Sherlock would run to, if this building were really on fire. Finding the body here, burned beyond recognition and identified tearfully by John, would raise little suspicion.
is generally around Florin this time of year. We’ll deliver the message, and if John wants you, I’ll send you the best of wedding gifts.” Jamiarty hesitated. “If not…well. I’m afraid I may have gone back on our bargain, Sherlock. I have developed feelings for you. I have been trying to learn to be a good husband, for you. If John says no…will you consider me as an alternative to suicide?”
No, the signs didn't start until the fall. A Sunday where they decided not to take a walk with Rachel, staying inside instead. A week where Sherlock had to force himself out of bed to tend to his bees. A tentative video call to Stan and Kitty, suggesting that perhaps they might not be able to visit this weekend.
(That wasn't quite true, of course, but all detectives needed to lie to their Mums once, so he was just being sensible and getting it out of the way early .)
"I'm not," John answered. He reached up and wrapped his arms around Sherlock neck. "I just understood why this feels so special."
The man in black stood after he loosely bound Maria’s wrists. He laid her sword by her side. With any luck, she would awaken and run off. That’s what he would do if he was her.
Maria knelt, to check that he was truly gone. Her head was swimming now, and the pain was coming back, but he was dead and gone and her wound was not fatal after all.
Ireni groaned and sent the horse running. “The country across the Channel. It’s the sworn enemy of Florin! Once the prince sees it, he’ll think that his precious Princess has been stolen by Guilder. And when he discovers the corpse on the Guilderian frontier…well, the war will be glorious.”
"She's telling the truth, but she doesn't know how bad it is yet," Sherlock said, sitting on John's knee. John wrapped his arms around his husband and listened intently.
It was Mycroft who said it. He took off the heavy chain that marked him as High Priest, and gave it to Grezzik. “It holds the blessing of the Powers. You will be protected.”
"And that's none of her business," John replied. "You're not the only one who can defend their partner, you know?"
“Then your trial is complete. May the Powers witness this and grant their favor.” The King paused for a moment. “Cerise of House Donovan, have you determined a punishment for the prisoner?”
Holmes made that horrible noise again. “What am I thinking? I am thinking that I despise my brain and my body, because they are too quick for ordinary people but not quick enough to solve the most important problems. I am thinking that there is a soul in utter agony tonight and I could do nothing to stop that outcome. I am thinking that I must stop turning to chemical comfort because it upsets you, but I do not know how to do without it. I am thinking a hundred other things as I think this, but those are the chief problems. Tell me, Doctor, what is your diagnosis?” His body trembled under Watson’s hands.
John looked at him. Hesitantly, as if he was afraid Sherlock would shatter (he wouldn’t shatter, but he might burn with this strange new heat), he took Sherlock’s hands and helped him up. “As you wish,” he said.
John came in less than an hour later with a strong feverfew tea, and Sally drank it all. Her fever came down hard, leaving her weak and chilled, but that went away soon.
Mrs. Hudson came up with the Hopkins family, Rachel wearing a bright blue dress and beaming. Kitty kissed John’s cheek and picked up her daughter. “Rachel, tell Grandad what happened today!”
Moriarty nodded. "He should be here soon; Donovan will have given into her guilt. But not just Sherlock."
John opened the bathroom door. Sherlock was stark naked. He was trembling head to toe, but his eyes were calmer.
Sherlock chuckled. "I'm planning nothing of the sort." He put a wiry arm around John's waist, stooping a bit to do so. "I just thought it would be a change of venue from our usual rendezvous."
“Well, your Highness, I’m not built for love. That’s not fair to a partner, and certainly not fair to a child.”
John understood. He feinted towards the rat, leaping back just in time so the lunging rat took the brunt of the flame. It died with the same horrible shriek.
When they separated, the Queen beamed at her and took her hands. “I am so glad you know at last, Sally. May I hold your child?”
John wiped his eyes. “I think that might have done it. I didn’t know I was worrying about all of that.” He smiled. “You did, though. Thank you, dear.”
“How long?” Molly asked, enunciating. Her accent always got thicker when she was sleepy, though never so thick as Grezzik’s. “When did she realize she was in labour?”
So I was going to post this every other day, but everyone's been very kind and energized me, so I decided I will update daily. ON ONE CONDITION: I don't get bugged too soon for a sequel. I have one planned, but I've got other projects I need to finish first, so there might be a bit of a gap between stories? Is that fair? I promise it won't be as long as the real-life sequel is taking (WILLIAM GOLDMAN PLZ).
Compared to the loud, long church service and burial in London, this one was deeply calm and quiet. Stan dug a deep hole on the edge of Watson's garden, the edge that faced the beehives. Together, Kitty and Rachel wrapped the box in one of Watson's scarfs. It was a light box, holding only a journal and a folded piece of faded paper covered in a messy scrawl. The cufflinks were buried with the lovers, but these last reminders of the love they held, the love that never dared to speak its name, were better kept at their sanctuary, so hard won.
"Then I suppose there's the important matter of my being in love with you." Sherlock's voice had gone softer, deeper. "And I'm not under any false illusions, John—I see who and what you are, more so than most people, wouldn't you agree? I'm in love with the person you are, for everything you are, even the parts of you that you despise." He put a hand on John's cheek, caressing him. "How could you ever be boring?"
“I will hear Mrs. Hudson if she comes, and quite frankly I don’t care what she thinks.” Holmes’ voice was tense, but Watson could feel his arm trembling. “I can invent some reason—it’s a cold night and you need watching—”
“Of course we would,” John agreed. “But they haven’t said a damn word about any of it, and they gave us a brilliant wedding. And I know you missed them just as much as I did.”
“Well, I wish you the best of retirement,” Mycroft said. There was a pause. “Do you need something from me?”
First off, thanks for reading! If anyone is hopelessly confused by the reference, just ask in the comments and I can answer for everyone.
Holmes spotted his brother the moment they reached the docks—a person of Mycroft’s stature tended to draw attention. Here, in a suit far better suited to Parliament than holiday making, he stuck out even more so than usual.
“We don’t have to use both of them, you know,” Watson said quietly, startled by a sudden lump in his throat.
Maria’s father made swords. Beautiful, perfect swords. Her father’s friend Yeste ran a sword shop, and whenever an order came in for a special sword, he climbed the hill to their tiny village.
Sherlock was awake before John that morning, a first in their relationship. Even before he knew his heart, he would wake to see John in the fields, or to breakfast left in his room.
“Scotland Yard has done some very competent work lately, and there are some, such as Wiggins, who will continue to raise the level of skill in that outfit. Hopkins is well placed as Deputy Commissioner, and with Mrs. Hopkins and Billy to consult when they are out of their depth, it is an ideal time for us to bow out.”
"And two other girls, he calls them Lupin and Pansy. They're both a bit older than Kitty, but they were still after the third wife."
The albino coughed. “Yes, sorry about that. I’ve had no voice for two weeks. With the miracle man gone, I’ve had to wait it out.”
The performance group fired him at last. They were being booed now, and they could see they wouldn’t get much more out of Grezzik. They left him sitting on a rock in Greenland, all alone in the loneliest country in the world.
“Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned?” As he spoke, Grezzik kept swinging his fists. The man in black dodged each one.
For the first time in her life, Ireni was speechless. She looked at Molly. “Maria, you’d better explain to this woman that I passed ruthless ten years ago.”
Stan laughed. “Not at all; that means the hormones are really working.” He stroked his beard. “Anyways I…well, I can’t. We can’t have our own baby.”
The doorman let them in without a word, and they got into the elevator. Sherlock typed a code into a keypad, too quickly for John to tell, and they started going up.
He spun around just in time to see Moriarty fall to the ground, slumping over to reveal a disgusting hole in the back of his head. A tall man with pale blonde hair stood near the door, a gun raised. John stared back at him.
The doctor saw her sorrow, and ran a hand through her hair. Like any father, blood or not, it killed him to see his child in pain, but there was little to be done.
“That isn’t what you said two days ago, your Highness.” With one quick movement Cerise ripped off her bandages. The crowd gasped—there were deep cuts up and down the woman’s arms. Some were still bleeding. “When you were cutting me, trying to make me tell you who carried Sally, you told me I was just above my daughter. That you’d taken her from her beautiful grave and stuffed her into a pit.
“Pretty direct hit to your lung,” Sherlock said. He got up and whirled around again, robe twisting behind him. Long fingers grasped instruments. Watson recognized a few.
"Can we see them?" Sherlock interrupted. He was a bit surprised that Mycroft's name was the first to spring to mind.
“You can relax, Princess.” The giant’s voice rumbled through Sherlock’s body. “I will keep you safe.”
But they weren’t Jamiarty’s. He’s always had small hands, but these hands weren’t his. There was a mark in the left palm; it looked like a scar.”
Billy laughed. “I will, Grandfather Sherlock.” He swallowed hard, bowed his head, and walked out of the room.
Greg loves music and poetry, but he’s utterly rubbish at writing his own. He can, however, appreciate Mycroft’s attempts fully.
Mindful of the dire threats Kitty had made if Rachel got wind of certain ones of their adventures, Watson kept it light, describing some of their more madcap adventures. Holmes chimed in every once in a while, mostly to correct timelines. “My dear Watson, I dressed as the old woman
Hope you enjoyed! I wanted to give Ireni more backstory, because it does inform some of her actions.
“We’re starting a war, idiot. They always start with a dead body. Preferably royal.” Ireni’s lip curled into a smile. “This is a prestigious line of work, you should be proud.”
"You're reckoning wrong," John said firmly. "So you decided to keep it secret? That doesn't quite explain the shouting."
So Max is Max (I couldn't find anyone among the cast who was worthy/not already taken), but yes, Martha is Mrs. Hudson. And see? New stuff!
Sally's worry over Waverly gets the better of her, and she and Miracle Max have a talk. And they discover something shocking in her past.
Secondly, I've made a final list of chapters. I currently have four more weeks worth of chapters (there's one multi-parter that will come out in the same week.) So I'm going to take prompts from today until next Wednesday (October 19th). Any that come in I'll add to the list, but otherwise this story will end on November 9th. You can still submit prompts after the 19th, but I won't be posting any further chapters until about 23rd of November at the earliest; I need to take a week's break, especially since I've got school deadlines (and another deadline that will be of interest in January) all that month.
“Well, I don’t exactly want the baby. I want to demand the baby, them to refuse, and then we invade.” Jamiarty cocked his head. “But I take your point. Moran, how long has it been since you were there?”
“We can spare a few moments,” Sherlock whispered, his free hand reaching up to stroke John's hair. “Miss Riley won't be home for another half an hour, and we need her...assistance.”
But Watson didn't hear, and kept calling. Eventually, with Stan's help, Holmes managed to put his hand in Watson's, which finally calmed him. It was dawn before either man fell asleep.
“Are you sure?” Molly asked. Sherlock was healthier now, but he still was far too thin for her (and John’s) liking.
Mary was innocent, but not naïve. She knew that love was between man and woman, that marriage was the highest form of love, and that she and John were meant to be together.
Now just a heads up to everyone; I'm coming to the end of my list of stories (DON'T PANIC--I have at least 7 more weeks of stuff). I've also got quite a few longer ideas in the works, as well as some shorter stories which are complete and will be posted this month (both SPN and Sherlock).
As I said before, while Prince Jamiarty’s father was in good help, there was no question of him being needed for anything royal. He had all the privilege and none of the responsibility.
When Molly Hooper was thirty four she realized that, after all, Mike Stamford was actually very interesting and plenty romantic, and she’d fallen in love without noticing.
Rachel came in first, trying not to weep, and Holmes held her tight, running a hand through her curls. "Little Rachel," he murmured. "Be good for your parents, alright? And keep dancing. I have no doubt you'll be a ballerina someday."
“Yes, and I thank you. You’ve been more than fair.” The man in black drew his sword in his left hand.
The doctor's husband reached out to the woman's husband as a long scream echoed down the stairs and took his hand. "It will be over soon, and the rest will begin," he said soothingly.
Sherlock looked at him. “Mycroft and I are seven years apart, while you and Harry are barely five. You would have been around her more often than I with Mycroft. Why don’t you remember?” Sherlock felt his gut tighten. John had an excellent memory.
John lowered his voice. "Sherlock, close your eyes." He waited until Sherlock obeyed, then carefully drew his chair closer, trying to make as little noise as possible. "Are you having a migraine?"
“We need to call our banners,” Queen Chessa said. “We may be trying to avoid war, but if it is coming the troops should be on their way. Besides, a coronation is an important event. I would like to attend.”
"Keep Kitty safe. She's right about that book—my informant knew about it too, but apparently it's not widely known, especially among the women. It seems like it might be enough to put him away for life, as well as save Kitty's friend. We can get started on that tomorrow."
"I hope you don't feel the need to do that," John answered quietly. "But if you do, remember that we'll still help you. Your friend will be alright."
Kitty laughed and scooped Billy up. "Well, I suppose it's alright, then. But if Stan and I run out of answers to his questions, I'm bringing him back here."
Seven years after Billy’s born, to their complete surprise (Watson laughs and asks them what they could expect; it was bound to happen the way they ‘carried on’) Kitty becomes pregnant again. She delivers a daughter; they name her Rachel for Stan’s sister.
"I won't if you don't," John rasped back. They'd left the lamp on, both trying to make sure the last glimpse of life they had was of each other's faces.
In his mind, Sherlock came to him, and explained that it had been fear and fear alone that sent him away. “Of course I love you, John. Of course you’re mine, and I’m yours. I’m free now, I got away, all on my own. And we’ll go away and have our own adventures together, I promise. Let’s talk about them, shall we?”
"Then I'll be right here to make it better," John promised. Still touching Sherlock, he moved quickly around the bed and got in under the covers, spooning Sherlock from behind. "I'm right here, dear. I'm sorry you're in pain. Don't worry."
“We have no time to waste!” Molly grabbed her sword again, and almost looked like her old self. “We must find him!”
"I had to do this!" Kitty was tiring, her struggling becoming weaker. "I had to hurt him, he can't ever hurt anyone else like this, no matter what happens!"
In the village close to where they retire, most of the inhabitants have accepted the fact that the odd men in the cottage are a bit…different. They don’t particularly care; Holmes’ honey is good, Watson’s generous with his time and his vegetables, and really, they’re doing no harm.
Well, there you are, the end of 'Have Fun Storming The Castle!' This was awesome to write and awesome to see how people reacted, thanks for all the kudos and comments.
Maria lost track of the names of her moves, the styles she should employ. For the first time in twenty years, she was going purely on instinct, and all she could do was keep moving, not drop her blade, and pray that her instincts had been trained enough.
Grandad John was sitting in his chair writing as they played, and Billy was suddenly concerned that Grandad John was lonely. He got off his chair and curled up next to him. "What are you writing, Grandad?"
Retirement had brought peace the two men had never expected to have. Sherlock's bees loved John's garden, and on quiet days they worked together in their 'study', as they called it. John found time to write every case down from hastily scribbled notes, even the short ones, and Sherlock alternated between composing and blowing more things up. They took the high-speed train into London every weekend to visit the Hopkins', and every summer they had them down for a few wonderful weeks of exploring the Downs.
And it got worse. The powerful numbness spread to her torso, at least stopping the pain, but then it was in her legs. By dawn, Sally was barely breathing, and Anderson’s sobs couldn’t be muffled.
Watson started shaking. Alarmed, Holmes stopped walking, drew him into an alley. “John? What—” Then he glared as Watson burst out laughing. “This isn’t funny!”
“We are circus performers who have lost our way,” the woman explained. “Is there somewhere nearby where we could earn our bread?”
“Tell me about it. I’ve been mostly dead, and my husband went from a dairy farmer to a Princess.” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “We should get moving.”
Grezzik took a deep breath, cleared his thoughts, his mind, his body, and pushed all of his energy into his mighty arms and
“As ruler, you need to be the sword of your people. You must fight with voice and might and heart for your country, always taking the option of least harm. Your people should feel safe with you upon the throne.” The last part was said much louder. Sherlock and Jamiarty were circling each other, trading blows in almost perfect silence, but Jamiarty’s eyes still flickered over to the throne.
Months after that strange night, Holmes was still surprised by the change in his…well, in his John’s face. They were subtle, small and insignificant to anyone that hadn’t seen that face every day for years (Holmes swallowed his guilt about the three years he hadn’t)…but they were clear as the blue sky to him.
“As we have for many years,” Watson replied evenly. “Those of our acquaintance know us as friends, and we are careful not to appear otherwise to strangers. It is not an assumption many would make.”
Also, for those of you who don't know who Kitty Winter is, she was a character in 'the Adventure of the Illustrious Client'; she was horribly abused by a sadistic monster...and threw vitriol in his face. She's basically so much better than Irene Adler. Stanley Hopkins is a young detective (similar to Dimmock's character but much more polite) who idolizes Holmes. Together, they are my new OTP.
Now I know this isn't the anniversary of this fic, but it is my one year anniversary of being on this site, so I wanted to write something appropriate. This has been a crazy, wonderful year, and I want to thank all of my readers for being a part of it.
Sally was positive her child was going to be a boy, though no one actually knew for sure. She’d dreamed of a boy-child twice, and she and Anderson had already decided to name the baby Tom.
That was a new voice. Sherlock looked up and saw one of his abductors, her face drawn with pain and stomach covered with blood. “You’re Maria, right?”
Kitty stayed quiet as John carried her up the stairs. His old bed was still there, in case of visitors (rare) and migraines for both him and Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson gave it an airing every once in a while, and the bedding was clean. John put Kitty on the bed then stepped back, unsure of what to do.
Neither Holmes was religious, but Rachel knew the secret of their love, the strange dream they'd had years before. She wondered whether that meant that her grandads were still together, somehow. If someone had gone to all the effort of having them meet, why wouldn't they stay together beyond a lifetime? Wasn't that logical?
“It was him?” Janine was shocked. “Damn it, I should have responded to his invitations. I could have helped you…”
Sherlock put a hand on her knee. “Sweetheart, anyone who can’t see how much you two love each other are idiots and don’t deserve to be in your life anyways.”
The one next to the wailer, a six foot tall Male woman Sherlock recognized as Eria, stared wildly. “Princess? It’s—she’s having a night terror. And we can’t wake her.”
The hallway was blocked with people, gathered around a pale, young officer. John barged in without a thought, glaring at all of them. He placed himself between the stranger and Blackwater, a Sergeant with a nasty history of confrontation.
On an ordinary Saturday night with no case to distract them, they would have gone back to Baker Street and used the time to watch bad telly, catch up on their blogs, etc. Now that they were a couple, they often included cuddles (which Sherlock called 'physical bonding ') or simple make-out sessions (Sherlock didn't have a name for those) to the mix.
And if they both wore those particular sets as often as they could, and certainly every Christmas day, no one thought anything of it.
When they were all gathered, Janine looked Moran right in the eye. “And royalty to royalty, take back this message. We are willing to keep a truce for the sake of our people and the innocents in Florin, who have no role in this quarrel. But our royal person has been insulted and threatened, and our people are still in danger. We advise Prince Jamiarty that our allied leaders will know the truth of this exchange, and if there are any threats they will be informed and we will go to war. And if this should happen, expect it to be short, fierce, and unstoppable.”
Kitty never joins Stan at the Yard, despite Greg’s urging; she prefers working the way her dads do. Her child care job keeps her busy during the day, but when Stan’s off-duty they go round to Baker Street and h
"I think I'd better go now," David said gently. "If you've got any questions, don't hesitate to ring, my number's in your phones. I reckon you four want to get on with things." He walked to the door, then turned, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Oh, and one other thing; Sherlock, John, you might appreciate this more than the other two, but...there's no need for lube."
“I asked him not to.” Mycroft Holmes’ face was stern. “I wanted to speak with you privately before relaying what Sherlock and I discussed.”
Kitty took Billy's face in her hands. "Listen to me, William John Hopkins, do you think the same God who made them, the same God who brought them together, would punish them for loving each other?"
“No. I’m fine.” Sherlock put his arms around his Prince and shut his eyes. And for a moment, let himself believe that maybe Prince Jamiarty did care, because he allowed the embrace and even put on hand over Sherlock’s.
Mike was driving as quickly as he could, Molly shouting in the backseat, switching between her phone and Sherlock's as she tried to coordinate with Mycroft and Greg. Sherlock sat motionless in the passenger seat, eyes fixed straight ahead. They were going to save John—no, he was going to save John. That was all there was to it.
David's eyes twinkled. "Me and a few friends. We’re incorrigible romantics, and everyone thought it was a brilliant idea. Anyhow, that's not really what we need to talk about right now. So, here's the standard bit. Yes, you are all dead. No, there's no real tribunal, we sort of see all, know all...except the more, ah, intimate details. The people you love are all here. I do love saying that, it's not always true."
Watson just waved his hand. “You mean now that we've both given up unhealthy vices? I quite agree. But you were saying?”
“The only news people said in the village was about the Festival in a few days time,” Katie said. “And I spoke to the head of the Gossips. He hadn’t noticed anything.”
The woman’s voice was horrible, and Grezzik could hear Waverly crying. But he didn’t have breath for shouting, only for climbing. So he returned his attention to the wall.
Then Holmes had gotten called away on a case five days before Christmas. He hadn't wanted to go at all—he'd explained this to Watson three times in twenty minutes—but it was an important case. The fortunes of an old family depended on him discovering which one of the heirs was a murderer. Holmes hadn't felt the need to explain that it was his own godfather who'd just died, the very man who'd introduced him to the study of chemistry and logic when he was a boy of ten, and though the old man hadn't left him any money (per his own request), he was determined to discover his murderer.
“They won’t catch us,” John said, as if he’d read Sherlock’s mind. “And if they do…well, we’re guardians of the Princess’ child. I think we’ll get off.”
Lestrade shrugged. “I’ve known for years, Mr. Holmes. Besides, someone had to keep an eye on Hopkins.”
“How are you going to catch us?” John asked. “We survived the Fire Swamp. We could have magic for all you know.” He seemed utterly unconcerned, but Sherlock had seen that look in the Prince’s eyes before. It meant death.
“Well, I’m speaking from the perspective of a friend; I never walked in on my sister much.” John ignored the twinge of memory. “But I suppose the procedure is the same.”
Without any consideration for the heat of the drink Kitty raised the mug and downed it in one go. "There. Thanks Doctor, that does feel better. So what you need to do—what I'm asking you to do—is to find his book."
“A marriage between men will never be recognized!” Holmes spat. Then he remembered a pale man in the mist asserting the exact opposite.
She left once her wounds were healed and began to travel. She learned the art of the sword, but so much more than that. She learned to be strong, to be fast, to keep her head in the gravest crisis and to channel her pain into combating weariness.
“Grezzik, be a dear and drag the prisoner for me? He won’t wake up from that until I let him, so no need for gentleness.”
John glared at the man, his eyes desperate with pain. His hands shook as he turned his back to Moriarty and walked towards the edge of the roof.
Mycroft had always suspected his little brother was different. Removed as he was from the idea of love and romance, particularly with his size, he never even considered that he was different in the same way.
From the outset Maria was delighted. The man in black knew how to counter, knew how to thrust—he knew how to use the rocky terrain to his advantage. She leapt up on the rocks anyways; he wasn’t much taller than her, but that inch or two might make a difference.
“This plan was conceived several weeks before your...alteration of relationship with Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “When I discovered you were lovers Sherlock insisted that the plan would still work, but that you did not need to be involved. As it stands now, however, many of our alternatives have been made impossible and the remaining option isn't tasteful. Still, Sherlock wants you to know, John, and I do believe that is for the best.”
Lestrade shuffled as the guests chuckled. He was nervous, Sherlock could tell. He hadn’t really wanted to make the speech, but it was him or Mycroft, and Lestrade knew that Mycroft couldn’t do public speaking, not like this.
The man in black released him immediately and rolled him over, checking to make sure he was breathing.
“He’ll know the moment it begins; the throne room is too public. They will need cover, and none of our allies can make it there that quickly.”
Ireni turned. To the south stood a small hill, covered in flowers. The fading sunlight made the flowers nearly glow.
“Then explain me.” Watson cradled Holmes’ head with one hand. “Explain how you have given me entertainment and kindness and affection. How you have given your heart, dangerous as it is.” He drew back just enough to look Holmes in the eye. “You deserve to seek comfort for the pain in your heart, Sherlock. And I’m here, I’m right here.”
Sherlock was positive now, there was nobody there. He moved closer to Raz and spoke in his normal voice. “I haven’t been in this castle for months, have I?”
Lestrade yelped and left quickly. He would make the train, his bags safely stowed, and go to Scotland He’d be with his daughter her family by the next day.
“To be great, one has to be terrible.” For a second Mycroft’s face hardened, and Grezzik saw a power, a force he’d never known. It spoke of searching, of scratching remorselessly away at reality until it gave up its secrets. Then it was gone, and in its place was a tired man.
Sherlock hated calling their dates 'dates'; he'd do it if pressed, but 'rendezvous', 'outings' and 'time together' were his preferred terms. It was only after one too many glasses of wine at Angelo’s that he’d confessed that he thought those words sounded more ‘romantic’. John never let on that he knew.
John said nothing. He had nothing to be ashamed of as far as his sexual prowess, although he was certainly more used to being with women than men. But there was still that worry, that concern that although the physical side of things had been progressing slowly and with great enjoyment on both their parts, that if they went all the way that Sherlock would find him wanting. Because what was he, really, almost four years older than his partner, scarred and...ordinary.
Please tell me someone got that reference. I also thought I’d give another style a try. Let me know what you think! Set about a week after ‘Sleeping on It’. Also John has a potty mouth.
"I had to see it!" Kitty was shaking now. "I had to see it, I had to know he was finished, don't you understand?!"
“You don’t know who I am.” Kitty’s face was drawn with fear as she stared up at Hopkins. “If you knew…”
The figures behind Janine removed their hoods, and Molly recognized Queen Chessa and Prince Sukiv, along with Miracle Max and Martha.
The three of them went inside. Billy marvelled at the little house. He’d always thought that Baker Street was his grandfathers made rooms; they fit so beautifully. But this was their own place, and every little thing from the blue sofa to the thick drapes (in case Grandfather Sherlock had a headache) was perfectly them.
They were sitting by the fire in an inn’s quiet dining room, just after dark. And Sherlock was shaking, sweat beading on his forehead, claiming that he’d seen a spectral hound.
Mycroft drew a small box from his pocket. “I know I didn’t give either of you much time for thought, but I also don’t know if the traditional vows quite work for this occasion.” Opening the box, he drew out two identical gold rings. He handed one to each of them.
When Stan was thirteen his father died. He was twenty-two before he stopped looking over his shoulder for the next blow.
Molly looked at the old woman. Her eyes were narrowed in concentration for a second, and then she looked calm again. The girl stood there, her arms akimbo, her face fierce.
John had to practically drag Sherlock out of the cab. He tossed the driver ten quid and took his still-protesting husband’s hand. “Come
Three days before the wedding, the Thieves’ Quarters was nearly empty. Most of the thieves went quietly. They knew they’d be out of jail soon, there weren’t enough cells for all of them. That was the whole point of the Thieves’ Quarters.
You could get a fair bit of fun out of tradition, John conceded as he tried to keep up with Stan. You just had to use your imagination.
"Probably not. Sher will come around, though. I think he's just startled." John was still chuckling, but his voice had turned much warmer. "So...you and Mycroft, eh? How long?"
He was chained to a table in a dark room. There was one candle, and just before it sputtered out a silent albino would appear. He would dress John’s wound, which was healing nicely, feed him, ignore all of John’s questions, and leave. That left John alone with his thoughts quite a bit. He’d had a touch of fever the first week, and hadn’t been able to process much, but now his mind was clear. He could hear the faint sound of different kinds of animals above his head, so he had to be under something, but beyond that…
“I think we might have some other things to do,” Anderson said. He looked thoughtful. “You know, the executioner didn’t put up a lot of resistance. She actually let me put her to sleep. She doesn’t like Jamiarty either. And she might not be alone.”
John had spoken to both of them quite sternly about professionalism and politeness, and to a certain extent had succeeded. Until, of course, Sherlock had tried to help, and managed to insult both of them by saying that they were behaving like children. Kitty had taken this to mean that her insults weren't up to snuff—Stan had been furious to be called a child.
Well, if John was working towards their happiness and love, then surely he should do his part! He needed to be strong and fit, so John would never have to leave him again! Sherlock leapt up, tucked the note into the pocket against his heart, and sprinted outside.
It opened onto a small sitting room with two armchairs close to the fire. A bookcase stood next to the wall, all of their books neatly organized. The kitchen was just through the next door, a bright, airy space with two large windows overlooking the sea.
John shrugged. "If you want to stay that's fine. I just want to know if I'm going to have to make a hasty exit if my partner  gets caught snooping through old cold cases or something."
Sherlock wasn’t awake yet, his face relaxed for the first time in months. John kept his breathing slow and even, not wanting to wake his partner up.
John dug out his key and opened the door. Mrs. Hudson was likely asleep, and John helped Sherlock up the stairs as quietly as he could.
"That's the idea. And of course there's two outsides.” David indicated a door by the window that was certainly never in Baker Street. “You go out that way, you'll be in Sussex with your bees and gardens, and down the stairs is London from both times. You should try exploring each other's times, that might be interesting."
"We can protect Delia if we have the book. It'll be enough to call the wedding off, no matter how ensnared she is, and that'll buy us some extra time. "
Sherlock wrapped his arms around and smiled tolerantly. “Apologies, my dear John. It appears we had the same goal.”
Kitty dropped by late one night in the middle of a summer storm. She accepted the hot tea John pressed on her without a fuss, so they knew something was up.
“You are not dragging my grandson into this mess!” Miracle Max snapped. “I’m not bringing him back to lose him again!”
“We thought about it, but we’re not exactly Mike and Molly.” Kitty smiled a little sadly. “I don’t think even Uncle Mycroft could forge enough documents to make us look like suitable parents, especially when there are so many couples that are infertile.”
And of course, this is for Willow_Angel, thank you for the prompt, lovely, and I hope I did it justice!
Relief filled Sherlock, and he laid his head on John’s chest. Then he sat up again. “Who the hell is Stam?”
They were in bed together, sated and happy. Or at least, John was sated and happy. He had his husband, they had fantastic sex, they had friends and family. Little Waverly had recovered quickly from her difficult birth, and she was the happiest baby John had ever seen. Sally was still recovering herself, and she and Anderson spent many days in the gardens, playing with their little daughter.
Lestrade squeezed his hand. “I want to sit with you for a while,” he replied. “Sit and tell you all the things I could never write. Does that sound alright, love?”
Her brother, Prince Sukiv, had come from Regalia. The underground kingdom technically existed within Guilder’s borders, but they lived so far down no one bothered. Sukiv had a heavy hood and wore thick gloves to protect himself from the sun.
“North of Regalia could cause a problem,” Sukiv rasped. “Lord Banesworth of Nepce doesn’t like Jamiarty, but he’s a fanatic about the Right of the Crown.”
“No thanks to Jamiarty.” That was Queen Bella’s voice. She’d clearly just awoken, but she looked as regal as her husband. “The poison was slow-acting and mimicked true illness, and it was hidden by Riley’s magic. You bear no responsibility for that.”
“Let’s just say that Jamiarty has reason to fear one of the Carriers. She holds a secret that will bring him down. But I can’t tell you anymore. Just…stay here. For now. And if you hear a row in the next day or so…” Sherlock lowered his voice. “Get to the Throne Room.”
“You’re not a bad mother, Sally.” Max held up his hand. “I’ve seen you. Every time someone has to carry Waverly instead of you, every time she drinks milk that isn’t yours, every time Grezzik solves a problem you didn’t even know was there…I see it. You hate it.”
Mycroft loves labels; he organizes, he files, it’s what he does. On the other hand, he refuses to find a label for his own orientation. He doesn’t like the idea of filing a part of himself away—he likes the idea of analyzing how he feels about Greg even less.
The rest of it didn’t matter so much. Sure, they were on the run from one of the most powerful men on earth, and they were gearing up for a war with Florin, but…well, they had each other. And they had Mycroft and Molly and Grezzik and Stam, plus John’s grandparents and Princess Janine of Guilder…they would be fine.
“Is that not a good reason?” John asked lightly. “After all, you can have love without marriage, but after all the work Mycroft did—yes, Sher, I know, your brother’s terrible at keeping secrets.”
“Let me see if I understood my little brother correctly. Your feelings for him are not only friendly, but romantic. My brother has revealed that those feelings are mutual, and you have both decided to keep quiet on the matter to avoid scandal and imprisonment.”
Really though, he hadn't needed his husband's confirmation. Kitty's shirt was rumpled; Stan's tie was on the ground, and they were both breathing heavily.
Molly grinned, her sword ready in her hand. It felt like old times for a moment, the good days when the Sicilian Crowd had missions they cared about and a target to take down.
"That was one of Mrs. Hudson's best set," John clarified. He chuckled as Kitty and Stan's faces took on identical expressions of horror.
“Someone may still come in.” Sherlock returned to the old woman’s voice. “What happened to Eria and the other Carriers?”
“Because I didn’t trust Prince Jamiarty,” Mycroft answered. “And I knew something was going to happen. I’ve been busy, these last two years, making contacts among other nations. I even let myself get conquered.”
There was a pause, and then the banner man removed his headdress, revealing a carefully powdered golden wig, with a tiara perched on top. “Long live the Princess, Heir by the Powers.”
Of course, life isn’t fair. Everyone in that room knew it, down to the bones that had given them frames for their trouble and the hearts that had broken more than once. Even stories aren’t fair.
Watson pulled him tightly against him, leaning their foreheads together. "And if I do?" he teased. "'What will you do then?"
He fell, and Maria dashed to him. But there was no goodbye, no final word. Domingo was dead before he hit the floor.
Holmes blinked rapidly and wrapped his arms around Watson. There was no one to see them now—their nearest neighbour was almost two miles off. No one to barge in, no one to judge, no one to report them. They could share a room now without consequence, without fear of discovery as they had the few times they’d thrown caution to the winds.
Good old Kate, she didn’t ask questions, though she was clearly bursting. “They’re in the library, I believe. Leave your horses here, I can take them to the stables.”
“No,” Mycroft said, and his tone was gentler now too. “Your mind is fascinating the way a tangled field is fascinating—Nature grows within it, its power coming from the chaos, springing forth new blossoms that no one’s ever seen.”
“I do,” Sherlock and John said in unison, and they ignored the laughter around them as they kissed for the first time as the ‘married ones’ of 221b.
So Sherlock hasn't been eaten by the Eels (like I TOLD you), but there's quite the climb ahead. Meanwhile, the Man in Black encounters a Spaniard who hates waiting, especially to be out of trouble.
“The man who saved you? James? No, that wasn’t Mycroft.” Sherlock closed his eyes, memories of the little boy he’d left behind, just as Mycroft had once left him. He hadn’t thought about him in years. “That was someone else.”
Sherlock forced himself not to stumble as they ran across the rocky terrain. Who was this man? He’d just murdered someone in cold blood, and if Ireni was right (and she probably was), the other two were dead as well. There was something terrifying about the man in black, even if he was at least half a foot shorter. That was making it very hard to run behind him.
The man in black put his sword down. “I appreciate the offer, but I believe my chances may be slightly better hand fighting.”
“I’m not a witch, I’m your wife!” The woman was shaking with indignation. “True love, he said true love, Max!”
Sherlock took Rachel very carefully from John, holding her in front of him, supporting her head carefully. “Hello Rachel,” he said. “You won’t remember this, but I’m your other grandfather. It’s very…very nice to meet you.” He cradled her against his chest, closing his eyes.
“I haven't heard from him,” Sherlock said curtly. “My phone hasn't rung in the last two hours. Not since I left John.” He steepled his fingers. This part of the plan wasn't totally necessary—he'd just wanted to say goodbye to John. In order to make the ruse look likely, John had to stay behind for the funeral and burial—at least a week. It wasn't that long, but it would be the longest he'd been apart from John in their entire time of knowing each other, and seven times as long as they'd been apart since they'd gotten together.
“By your tone, I’m assuming it’s not the war-mongering,” Sebastian continued. “No, you sound disgusted, cousin.”
“Sherlock had a similar issue.” Mycroft sighed. “I tried to persuade Sherlock to simply compose a waltz of some kind, but he’s having creative block.”
Mummy had both hands on her face, but her eyes were doing her happy sparkle so perhaps she wasn't cross. "Billy, that's impolite!"
Grandfather John laughed. “I don’t think we’ve got time before we get back to the cottage, now do we?”
They are due to be married in November. Hopkins has asked Sherlock to be his best man, and Kitty wishes for me to escort her. Kitty knows about us now. She has promised not to say a word, and calls our arrangement ‘frightfully romantic’. I am not entirely sure this is a compliment.
“Mother wasn’t unkind to me, but she died when I was eight and then it was just Harry and I with Dad. It was bad for quite a while—when she came out, when she started to drink as much as Dad, when she refused to go to school anymore—well. I had to be the perfect child. There was no reward in it, no congratulations: I wasn’t supposed to be alive so I had to make up for the mistakes of the daughter he adored. Still adores, despite everything.”
They could have walked all day, but storm clouds were brewing on the horizon, and Rachel was growing sleepy. She still napped in the middle of the day, and fell asleep clinging to Billy’s back as they returned to the cottage.
Watson nearly reached out to take Holmes’ hand before he stopped himself. “Mrs. Hudson,” he said as gallantly as he could, “thank you for your assistance, but I believe that Holmes and I can manage from now on. I simply need rest.”
“Do you know how many nights I’ve lain awake thinking about losing you?” Holmes managed, voice dropping a whisper. “How many times I’ve watched you beside me on a stakeout, thinking it might be the last time? At least when we were younger the odds were in our favour, but now…I can’t lose you John. Not to something I can prevent. Please don’t ask me to do that, even though I once asked that of you.”
Ireni considered that. “I suppose I’m…happy now. That you’re happy. But I don’t really love you. I don’t think, at least.”
“We still have some questions to answer,” Molly said. “Once we’re inside, how do I find the Count? And how do you find the Princess? And once that’s done, how do we get out and to Stam’s boat?”
John laughed. "D'you know, I think we ought to at least have a cuppa together before we start discussing the finer points of modern sex equipment. And get you used to talking about it openly," he added as Holmes jumped. "You're sharing a room, too."
“Jamiarty wouldn’t be able to keep their capture quiet,” Molly said decisively. “He is a proud man, always ready with a lie. He would have announced the joyous return of the Princess.”
This is for merlynnllwyd, hopefully I've done your request some justice. It was tricky to write but I enjoyed the challenge.
She knew that the way John looked at his friend was beyond friendship, beyond law—and one time, just once when she’d come into Baker Street to find John asleep on the sofa, she saw Sherlock Holmes looking at him the same way.
“So Jamiarty has always wanted to be King?” Mycroft said in disbelief. Of all things, he hadn’t expected that.
“You do a bit more than halfway, Da,” Stan replied. “But Kitty’s right—I don’t think adoption is something we’ll be able to do. At least not right now.”
It was a joke between them, a come-on for Sherlock to use his “bloody brilliant” powers and coax the information out of his silent but smiling lover. It was fun, although apparently it ranged from ‘adorable’ to ‘vomit-inducing’ in public.
"Yes," Watson nodded, but his attention was drawn by the door. It didn't appear to be locked, and when he tried the knob it turned easily.
“Impossible,” Sherlock said at last. “The way it moved isn’t possible with robots; it was too fluid. I know how dogs move.”
Holmes leaned into the touch for the briefest minute. “What are we to do, then?” he said in frustration. “If someone else notices and understands—”
“Yes. She had royal blood, and could inherit should something happen to both myself and Jamiarty.” The King bowed his head. “On that trip, she fell ill and died suddenly. It seemed like the Cough that was going around at the time.”
“Sure.” Billy looked up and seemed to notice how close they were together. “Oh no, you’re not going to be all fluttery like Mum and Dad, are you?”
“I’ll go help Holmes with luncheon then.” His grandfather left the room and Billy set about unpacking. He took a big armful, dumped it in the top drawer, then took another and put it in the bottom drawer. Finished. Easy.
“There is…” Sebastian swallowed. “In the diary, Jamiarty talks about his first hunt. The whole process, laying in wait, waiting for the creature to be vulnerable, waiting for the poison to take effect. He even said that none of the creature’s herd understood its death, and wailed for the accident.”
Sherlock doesn’t truly approve of Mycroft and Greg’s relationship, but that’s mainly because he now has to share both of his favourite people that are not John or Mrs. Hudson. It’s a minor comfort that he’s sharing them with each other.
Kitty hadn't had much nurse training, but she followed Watson's feverish instructions as best as she could. There wasn't much she could do anyways; she'd never felt so helpless. Logic wouldn't help here, nor love. Her fathers were racked by coughs and pain, and all she could do was try to keep them cool and hydrated.
“I love to read.” Watson looked up in him. The flickering light brought storms into his eyes, though they were still kind. “There’s so much I want to know.”
…seriously go read the story and come back it’s utterly incredible and it’s one of the most stunning moments of real emotion in all the ACD canon. Which makes it excellent fodder for a romantic moment. :) Now, on with the show!
John let Sherlock make the introductions. He helped his grandparents down from the boat and concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other.
“I will do the same for you,” Sherlock interrupted. “Jamiarty had me fooled last time. He won’t again.”
“I have access to the royal library,” Sherlock explained. “There isn’t much about the Fire Swamp, but that was one of the accounts.”
He and John were young again, for starters. John had done a rather enthusiastic cartwheel when he realized that his old wounds were gone too, even the scars faded. For his part, Sherlock's chest no longer felt tight and his hearing was as good as ever. They were also in an interesting blend of their retirement cottage and their Baker Street flat bedroom. John was keen to see if sex was easier than it had been in recent years, but Sherlock resisted, wanting to see if the rest of the flat was there.
Damn it all! Of course Watson was familiar with Holmes' contempt for many aspects of the Christmas holiday, but that was before...well, before this strange, new happiness the two of them had found. Holmes had barely wanted to leave in the first place, and now he didn't see much point in going back.
“Don’t be ridiculous. We’re going to get Waverly back, and then we’re going to destroy Jamiarty.” Janine’s voice was the coldest Molly had ever heard. “And you don’t know anything about her powers, Moran?”
"What's the matter?" John was shaking with rage. "Don't want a spectacle made out of yourself? You've made this lad's day difficult, you wanker. Allow me to return the favour."
“That’s why I can’t pick the song,” John said seriously. “That’s the best I can think of and he’ll—he’ll think it’s a joke. Please, Greg?”
John has been keeping an album since just after he moved into 221B. When he has a quiet day, he looks through it, remembering that all the people in it are family, and he marvels at how lucky he's become.
“Sally was born before the King remarried, but there would have been room for another child.” Max bit his lip. “I delivered all the babies at the palace, but I can’t…the King never spoke about another child. There were none who died young.”
Greg dug in his glove compartment for a moment, finally coming up with a pill bottle. As he drove out of the car park, John let go of Sherlock's hand and uncapped the bottle, shaking out two pills. Extra strength. Good.
Molly watched Janine walk to a large, ornate table. King Lotharon and Queen Bella were sitting there, with Queen Chessa, Sukiv, and Savira. Sally was sitting there too, crowned with a simple gold coronet. Anderson sat next to her, with Waverly in his arms. There were bannermen in the court from Prumpt, and Nepce, but their leaders weren’t there.
Kitty and Stan have met. John and Sherlock need to invest in earplugs (not for the reason you think).
He felt John’s hand around his wrist. And now John was pulling him up, but it was so much slower going up than down, and Sherlock’s arm felt like it was being pulled from his socket, and now he was starting to panic, but he swallowed it down, pushed it into the cave where his heart had been hidden, shredded and bleeding, three years back…
His gaze fell on the sofa, and he smiled. Watson was curled up there—he'd clearly fallen asleep without meaning to, head tilted awkwardly, body leaning towards the fire from lack of blanket. Holmes hesitated, fearing to wake him but wanting to cover him to keep from catching cold.
So they had a quiet weekend with their daughter, who'd become such a wonderful, happy woman, braving her losses with dignity, and held her tight when she sobbed and swore that they needn't worry about her. With their son, who now walked in a world where gender wasn't nearly so important as your quality, but was exceedingly thankful for the men who'd accepted him when the world was different. With their grandchild, who in spiritwas partly their Mum, partly their Dad and partly them, through blood and heart, who grew up thinking that love was brilliant, even if they didn't want it.
On their marriage certificate, it shows that John changed his name to John Hamish Watson Holmes. He keeps his own name for professional reasons, but Sherlock calls him ‘Mr. Holmes’ as often as he can.
"Yes." Moriarty smiled. "I really should have given you more credit, John. Really I should have; you're quite clever when you want to be. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though. You'd better jump."
Holmes has a letter tucked away among his commonplace books that is for Watson’s eyes alone. He truly hopes that Watson will never read it; his husband has already had to lose him once, but at least he’ll have a written record of how much he loves him.
That got Molly out of bed. She grabbed for her clothes as Janine murmured sleepily. Her heart was in her throat; it was only spring. Sally should be having a summer baby.
Jamiarty was beyond speech, his eyes inflamed with madness. The way he looked at Sherlock almost made him shiver, but John’s hands were over his, and that was all that mattered.
Mycroft lived another year, his time divided between Scotland and Sussex. Fittingly, however, when he died it was at the Diogenes Club, stopping over in the Stranger’s Room for one last memory.
Sherlock looked more nervous than John had ever seen him, eyes nearly glowing in the bright light. “John, will you let me ask you one question?”
"Kitty, then." Sherlock turned to John. "John, this hasn't happened in a while, and never in quite so dramatic a fashion—I had a basement flat on Montague Street, which is where I assume your information comes from?" He directed this inquiry at Kitty, who nodded. "This—playing burglar—was a way I devised to allow for people to get in touch with me, people who can't be seen coming to me."
Watson shrugged. His vision was blurring again, but he saw the glint of gold on Sherlock’s hand, remembered the night in the park a few months back. “How long have you been married now?”
Kitty shrugged. "It's all one, I suppose." She leaned back just a little bit on the sofa, body still curled in on itself. She looked exhausted, all of a sudden, and John wanted to give her some kind of comfort. Not knowing what the problem was, however, made it difficult to treat the symptoms.
Their rings would have to be hung on chains, there would be no photographs of the wedding supper (which was a shame, Mrs. Hudson dancing was a sight to see) and their only honeymoon would take place on the overnight trip back to London in a locked room with one double bed. Only seven other people would ever know what had happened that night. It would always feel like a dream.
Sherlock didn't seem in a rush to talk when he arrived home. He chatted with the twins, consulted on the fort that Kitty was building to be the dragon's cave, and even asked Molly if she and Mike's garden was turning out properly this summer.
And that afternoon, after Sally had slept, when she asked Grezzik and Molly to be Waverly’s Caretakers, Molly promised with every fibre of her being.
John didn't quite see the connection, but clearly Sherlock did.  "Tell me about your friend first," he requested.
There was no sign that the last summer would be the last. They were in their nineties, to be sure, but the average age was now nearly a hundred. Sherlock had rheumatism, and no amount of modern medicine could fully heal John's shoulder, but they were otherwise perfectly healthy.
He tried, but he couldn’t delete the look on Holmes’ face when he asked whether John had told him about his family. How Watson hadn’t told Holmes about it until after fifteen years of friendship. How it was that revelation, more than Afghanistan, the horrors they saw as detectives, or even the ‘solution’ to Moriarty, that taught Holmes that Watson ‘hides his pain well’.
Also...I made a reference explicit here that was already made in the last Reichenbach chapter (Ew). If you don't like it, that's fine, it won't be a major part of this verse's canon. If you do like it, see point 1 but feel free to imagine :) If you don't get it, don't worry (because of point 1). Now, on with the show!
So Sherlock was eighteen, and his gangly limbs were starting to settle, and his hair was darkening from ginger to something closer to the last drops of sunset in a night sky. He was moving up the ranks (not that he would have cared).
Nevertheless, once they had reached the park, Watson did have to admit that there was a strange beauty in the darkness shrouding the park. Utterly alone, he and Holmes walked slowly through the park, in no particular rush. Watson felt no fear, and though he could hardly see Holmes, even in the occasional burst of lamplight, he could feel his husband walking next to him. On impulse, he reached out and took Holmes’ hand in his. He felt Holmes’ hand tense, but he didn’t pull away. As they continued walking, he intertwined his fingers with Watson’s.
“You can too,” John finished. He kissed the top of Sherlock’s head. “Anyways, we’ll be the grandfathers. It’s our job to spoil the little one.”
Angelo directed them to ‘their’ table, which was always free any time they went to Angelo’s. John suspected Sherlock of making a standing reservation.
“I don’t love him John.” Sherlock was panicking now. “I swear to you, I never wanted to marry him, but you were dead, and he ordered me to, and…”
Kitty leapt to her feet, and I was surprised to see her blush. “Oh, thank you, Stanley. I hadn’t realized I left it.”
Kitty rolled her eyes. “Dad, I live four doors down.” She hugged them both and left, slipping her hand into her purse. Where she had the engagement ring, John figured.
The King took a step forward, and Sally found herself in his arms. They were frail and trembling, but they held her close.
When it was done Watson leaned back, Holmes automatically plumping up the pillow. “Thank you, Holmes.” He thought of something. “You can go upstairs if you like,” he whispered as he closed his eyes, weariness making itself known at last, the pain beginning to fade. “I know the sofa hurts your back.”
“We never meant to be apart in the first place.” John took Sherlock’s hand. “And we shan’t be again.”
“A good detective,” Sherlock allowed, though I saw his gaze harden as Kitty took the bag from Hopkins, her hand brushing against his. “Any official business, Hopkins?”
“Not I.” Jamiarty shook his head. “I didn’t want to fuck her. No, Anderson—the spy guard—he knocked her up. And the child has been born, a healthy baby girl.”
He didn’t resist as Sherlock drew him close, tucked against that familiar coat. Sherlock was shaking, and John clung on, trying to be solid for this man who’d become so vital to his life.
“Of course.” Janine was there now. She went to Molly and took her hands. “I am glad you are all back. Where is the witch?”
Sherlock raced towards the group, sparing only a second to look for traps. You didn’t need bars for traitors; only a locked door.
And it was. Despite being two weeks early, Stan and Kitty’s daughter was a perfectly healthy weight. The Hoopers arrived just as John finished cutting the cord. Tears in her eyes, Molly wrapped the baby in the blanket she and Lily had made. Then, cooing over the small curly head, she tucked her back into Kitty’s arms. Kitty rocked her baby, tears in her eyes. “Oh look at her, Stan,” she whispered. “Oh, she’s lovely.”
A small window in the door opened, and an old man’s face peeked out. “Beat it, alright? Or I’m calling the Brute Squad.”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide. He opened his mouth, and then shut it and dragged John out into the hall. “Drugs,” he hissed. “Drugs?”
It takes a lot of smarts to be a Detective Inspector. What takes more is being married to a Holmes, and learning when a case file is an apology and a request to close the curtains is a hint to go to bed. He learns.
“He beat me with steel, he beat you with strength, yes?” Maria began to pace. “He must have out-thought Ireni! Anyone who can do that can plan my castle onslaught with no problem!”
“Wonderful. Henry’s going to do the same thing, and tomorrow we’re going to figure out what the drug is and where it came from.”
“It went through,” Sherlock said. “It’s legal now, John. We can get married here, if you like. Unless you want to go elsewhere—”
“You’ve asked a lot of questions this year, and it’s only fair you get a chance to see the answers.”
And in less than ten minutes, everyone was cozied around the fire, with Waverly in Uncle John’s lap. Well, everyone except the little ones, who were lured away with cake and promises that they could hear the story when they were
What started as a simple missing person’s case combined with robbery ended with a desperate gunfight under the London Eye. Victoria Hatherley, who was only a puppeteer on weekends for children in the cancer ward, had lost her thumb trying to escape from a drug ring. Their leader, “Robert Stark, please no wedding jokes,” had tried to convince the young electrical engineer to do a show at a church to raise donations. She arrived to see no fewer than seventeen men and women waiting for her with bags of cocaine to put in her puppets. Her refusal had cost her a thumb, but without the help of Stark’s daughter Lisa it would have cost her life.
He could tell from Arthur's relaxed stance as he walked away that he'd made his decision. Sometimes you just need a bit of a shove to do what you already know you want, John reflected, thinking of the help he'd gotten to go after Sherlock.
Max was staring at her. Without a word, he grabbed her wrist and tilted her hand palm up. He traced the lines on her palm in shock.
"I'm up on the roof," he whispered. He saw Sherlock look up, could almost make out the confused horror on his face.
“And the King is in the South,” Miracle Max muttered. “But if you have royal blood, you can challenge the prat for the throne.”
Finally, the music started, everyone stood up just like in films, and John blinked away tears as his daughter came down the aisle, Sherlock at her side. Kitty’s dress was strapless, satin to her just above her knee and a filmy fabric flowing down to her calves. In her heels, she was nearly as tall as Sherlock. But it was her face that was lovely, her smile so bright when she looked at Stan that John knew her doubts were gone. They were happy, and strong, and they were together.
Sherlock inclined his head to the judge. “Apologies, Your Honour. As my partner could tell you, I tend to ramble when I am excited. I will stop…showing off.”
It seemed an instant later when she was shaken awake by Grezzik. “We’re leaving now,” the giant said. He lifted her onto her horse, and Sally winced. Her legs were aching, and her scars ached.
“Forgive me,” Watson said automatically. “I did not intend to be here.” Then it hit him. “Sherlock?”
“I never meant to hurt you, Riley. You told me you didn’t love me. That’s why I wooed you. I knew you weren’t going to have feelings for me.”
“Exactly. Mycroft has a certain level of protection, but he…doesn’t. He’s more hands on, my little brother.” Sherlock turned to Mrs. Hudson. “What did he say?”
Grezzik opened his mouth to cry out, but nothing happened. There was no sound. He could still feel Waverly in his arms, and he knew she should be screaming too, could feel her little body straining with the force of her cries. But he couldn’t hear her.
Granddad John bit his lip. "Well, Billy, your Mummy isn't quite sure you're old enough to hear stories about what we do together. It's a grown-up job, and there are scary parts."
Kitty moved to leave, but stopped when Watson called her name. “Father,” she whispered as she approached them. “My Fathers.”
“Yes, he has.” Moran had a couple drops of Veritas in him, but he was speaking very quickly, as if he was trying to outrun the truth spell. “It’s all in his book. He doesn’t want the care of a Kingdom, so to speak. That’s why he was so upset when he had to get married; it tied him to the throne. But he absolutely wants control.”
Now they just kept the two of them separated as often as they could. It was a shame, John thought as the argument died down outside.  If the two of them hadn't had such a bad beginning, it might have been a wonderful friendship. They were very alike in some ways—both terribly keen and clever, both anxious to look after the victims and survivors. They both enjoyed the same sorts of books, too (except Brontë). Yes, it was a shame.
John got up and watched their daughter run in the rain, a flash of lightning showing her getting into her building. John sighed.
Watson can't quite escape scrutiny of his relationship with Holmes...especially not from a 'superior intellect'
Molly never found the woman, no matter how long she looked. She left America after, but she kept her ears open thereafter, waiting for more stories of Invasion. A few came, and the elements were always the same: it was done for a person in desperate need of help, it was done by magic, and it was only done when intentions were pure.
His grandfathers exchanged another look. "I suppose there are some we could tell you," Grandad John said eventually. "But you must promise to tell us if you're frightened and want the story to stop, alright?"
“Then you go ahead and do that. We’ll go to the dungeons and see if we can find the Carriers, see what happened. Meet back here, and if we’re not back by sunrise…wait for the others.”
Sherlock threw on a long coat and rushed outside, his feet crackling through broken leaves. The moon was high over Watson’s hovel. There was candlelight under the door, and Sherlock banged on it.
John turned to see Sherlock, his face pressed against the window, snoring quietly. "Sher," John said quietly. "Wake up dear, we're here."
“Because he’s a fucking coward,” Sherlock replied. “He’ll wait for us to be helpless. That’s why he booby-trapped the door to lock behind anyone who entered.”
Sherlock couldn’t look at him. “If I come back with you, let him go. He’s a childhood friend, a…a sailor on the pirate ship
“You already know I love him. You’ve known as long as everyone else I'm sure, way longer than I even knew, just for the record. But this…taking me to your club, drugged and bound, threatening me in person rather than a phone call…I must say, this was more than I expected. More than he expected.”
He stepped forward and grabbed hold of John, yanking him by his bad shoulder towards the edge of the roof. Moriarty peered down; John did as well. There were a few people walking around even this early, and he briefly contemplated calling for help.
“I dunno, maybe.” Kitty was quiet. “I’ve always loved looking through bridal magazines. I know, I know, I’m a discredit to feminism—”
Holmes saw Irene Adler Norton one other time; it was during his time abroad after the Fall. In disguise as a fireman, he saved her daughter, Rose Norton from a house fire. Irene recognized him, told him sharply to go home, and thanked him. A month later, Holmes sent her a marked copy of the Strand with Watson’s story,
"Then don't," Kitty replied, pulling him close again. "Because they won't, you see. They'll be in Heaven, or no one ever goes there."
Grandfather John smiled. He swung their intertwined hands over Billy’s head so he was perched between them. “Sherlock, I think the lad wants to hear our story. And I think he might just deserve to hear the whole thing.”
John froze. Sally being smart wasn't part of the plan. She was meant to be the police officer who hated Sherlock enough to set things in motion. That was all.
“He’s doing it by trying to claim that Janine stole his property when she took Sally in,” Grezzik said. “Sally is from the Carrier family.”
The Carriers are a family descended from the first mother of a king’s illegitimate child in Florin’s history. If a king should marry a man, it is the responsibility of one of the lucky women of this family to bear the king’s child. They can never be pregnant unless it’s with a royal baby (which might never happen), and even marriage is discouraged. It’s a terrible institution, and Guilder does it much better, but you probably don’t care too much about Florinese gender politics. Or political genders.
Lord Moran wasn’t speaking either. Then again, it was difficult to speak when one had a gag in their mouth. He was tied to a chair in the middle of the room. No one was looking at him, and he wasn’t protesting the circumstances.
“Moriarty will want Sherlock to kill himself,” Mycroft continued without remorse. “So Sherlock will, but we will plan a way to save his life. Moriarty will relax his guard allowing my people to arrest him; Sherlock will unravel Moriarty's Web from afar.”
The man in black was being very slow. He was climbing, certainly, but he climbed deliberately, making a fist and plunging it into a crack in the Cliffs, lifting himself up and trying again.
The shooter stepped forward. “You need to get down, Dr. Watson. Sherlock Holmes must be worried. You don’t really need to worry about the details right now, do you?” His tone was considerate, but John didn’t move. If this was a trap…
In her eyes, Mrs. Hudson has three sons (two who live with her and one who rarely comes home). All three men privately think the same.
“Well, we’ll have you all down for a visit later,” Grandfather John said, “and we’ll all be ill if we stay out in this rain much longer.”
This is the most NSFW I've ever gotten, and I feel accomplished. (shhhh I know it's not that much shhhh) Just a heads up that from now on I'll be skipping more around in both timelines; next week's Victorian, for example, is set almost twenty years after the one three weeks from today.
“I am waiting for Ireni!” she screamed as the latest staggered away bleeding. “I will not be moved!”
“I’m not supposed to,” Grezzik said guiltily. “But Moran mentioned it one night. He thought the Prince is being very kind to give him a chance to be happy with another and still put in all this effort, especially when there’s so much concern about Guilder. Since they kidnapped the Princess; that’s why we were clearing out the Quarters.”
John stumbled forward, dropping to his knees and cradling Sherlock’s face in his hands. “Yes,” he whispered. He was shaking so badly he could hardly speak. “Yes, yes…I don’t know what else to say—”
So they’d spent that day getting ready. John camped with the Carriers outside, tending to Cerise’s wounds and watching the door. If Jamiarty was going to come during the day, they needed to be ready.
“I don’t know. Jamiarty never said, and the King never said a word about her. Neither of his daughters, actually.”
“See, you’re making rhymes again!” Grezzik said proudly. Then he remembered his second piece of news. “The six-fingered man is Count Magnussen. He lives in the castle with Humperdinck.”
“Put it away, lass.” Molly looked over to see an older woman, shaking her head. “There’s no good in that.”
The King and Queen had moved very quickly once the decision was made. Before noon, they were packed up, their retinue ready to go, and they were in a nice carriage. Kate was going to ride with them, as the King's newest bodyguard.
Jim Moriarty wasn’t on Carl Powers’ swim team. He was, however, on the chess team that went up the same week.
Prince Jamiarty was just setting aside his wedding gloves to write one last report when Moran arrived and knelt.
This one is very bittersweet, so read it with some tea. It takes place both in the past and immediately after chapter 48 (I borrowed SPN's 'then' and 'now' for clarity's sake)
Stam drew his dagger, but Maria crossed in front of him. She drew her sword, the one made for the man in front of her. The guards were on her, but four quick slices and they were down.
“Don’t worry, I propped it open. We’re fine, John.” Sherlock took his hand. “Now…why don’t we let the people’s voices be heard?”
“There will be no conflict from Florin.” Moran looked worried for a moment. “The Prince is not a fool, and he knows of your alliance with London and its allies. He would rather…not engage in conflict. Not in this way.”
Sherlock threw open his own window and leapt inside. Molly and the security guard were kneeling over Gruner, who was howling in agony and clutching at his now-ruined face.
“He didn’t know when he sent Riley and I here,” Moran replied. “I’m sure he didn’t; he would have sent Riley to poison her at least, and definitely to kill her child. But he knows now.”
Watson reached over and took Holmes’ hand under the blankets. “I’m glad you’re staying,” he murmured. “Goodnight, my dear Sherlock.”
Dimmock's face changed to a look of great concern. "Christ, those are terrible. Make sure he has water, dehydration makes them last a hell of a lot longer."
Holmes sent a quick text and put it down, picking a test tube out of a giant sparkling beaker just before it caught fire. Like last time. “It will be nice to see them,” he said, eyes warm. “I am not afraid, John.”
“I decided to put my pain away,” Sherlock replied. “I didn’t want to look at it, so I buried it. I suppose it was just once too many.”
“Now go home or your scallops will have been in the freezer too long,” Sherlock said, waving his hand.
but before he could the rope had broken and slid down the cliff side, no doubt taking the man in black with it. There was no scream, and no splash.
"Why, Heaven, of course." The man cocked his head. "Do you lot still call it that? You'll have to forgive me, there's an awful lot of dimensions and not everyone's up to the same terminology. Heaven, Paradise, Elysium...you know, the good place." His face turned serious for a moment. "I know you weren't all expecting to end up here. Very sorry about that."
Sherlock didn’t answer, and John sighed, stretching out just enough to light the candle. One look at Sherlock’s worried face, and his annoyance fell away. “Sher? Darling?”
“And how do you know John's in danger?” Iceman, Moriarty had called Mycroft. Perhaps that ran in families.
John and Sherlock attempt to show their support for Mycroft and Greg's new relationship. This does not go as planned for anyone.
“Yes. Greg called about it too. He said she wanted to resign before she was fired, and she’s moving up to Glasgow to be near her family.”
Listen. LISTEN. If you think I'm not going to put Mystrade in every single chance I get, you CLEARLY haven't read anything else I've read.
So yes, just to be clear, Stan is transgendered in modernity. He'll be meeting Kitty soon (as soon as I write it).
Generally her adoptive fathers wrote once a week, sometimes every ten days. She saw no reason to worry about them; Watson was a doctor, for goodness sake, and their cottage wasn't far from the village. They were both getting on in years, they were both in their eighties now. But she'd never thought that three days after a normal, cheerful letter, she would get another from a stranger informing her that both her fathers were very ill with pneumonia in late March.
“Of course,” Watson said. His vision was definitely blurring now. “Have to. S’all I can do for him. How I can show him I love him. It doesn’t always…doesn’t always seem like he knows.”
Then everyone sprang into action. Martha took the baby from Grezzik and began to wash her down, and Max and John began to sew Sally up. Sally had awakened, somehow, but she didn’t seem to be in pain. She held Anderson’s hand weakly. “Our son?” she rasped.
“My name is Molly Montoya,” she whispered to the corpse, “you killed my father, and now you are dead. Rot in hell.”
Even before they got together John was determined to find Sherlock a book that he would enjoy and not toss away. He started reading his favourite books aloud, with varying amounts of response from Sherlock. John almost gave up until he awoke from a two-day coma to Sherlock’s deep, shaky voice reading
“And yet here we are, two men who already live together have decided to embark on a romantic relationship. You’ve already done things out of conventional style, so…”
“He won’t be fighting,” Maria promised. “We’re going to avoid engaging as much as possible. We just need to steal the Princess and I need to kill the Count, then we’re gone.”
“John, if we start that…we’ll never get Sally safe. You know that.” Anderson looked panicked. “Even if he does know—”
A short interlude, where Duke Mycroft addresses some concerns, and Grezzik thinks he's getting a job offer.
.           Supper was quiet that night. Billy picked at the food, even though it was quite good. It just took too much effort to pretend that he didn’t notice Grandfather Sherlock’s red eyes, or the pain in Grandfather John’s.
Mrs. Hudson made it to her hundredth birthday, but she died in her sleep just before the first blooms of spring. John and Sherlock bought Baker Street from her estate, never mind that they’d been living in Sussex since Sherlock was sixty five. Looking around the flat they’d lived and loved in, they both prayed they wouldn’t feel the utter absence of the other so vividly.
There were dozens of people in the main hall, so many that Sally recognized as the regular backdrop of faces around the castle. Servants, knights, even lord and ladies ran through the halls.
“I’ve no idea. Look up the trains in Bradshaw, will you? Unless you don’t want to go,” Holmes added, suddenly concerned.
Except for Jamiarty. He was genuinely friends with her (though not ‘best-friends’), because they understood each other well. Riley didn’t pretend with Jamiarty, Jamiarty didn’t pretend with her, and they hunted together.
“She’s upstairs with that nice guard Kate. They’re watching Jamiarty and Moran. Enjoy yourself, Molly.” Then he waltzed off—with Duke Mycroft, of all people!
as wonderful as it would have been terrible to wake up alone. A shudder ran through his body, and John held him tighter.
Bonus points for those of you who know your canon well and can guess at who the mysterious Mrs. Hopkins is. Her backstory will be addressed (in both timelines) in the coming weeks. Along with a certain...other event.
They hadn’t written vows. Stan had found a set he declared ‘perfect’, and the way they spoke them sounded like the words were new, that no one had ever had a love like theirs. Maybe they were right, John thought. He remembered how they’d looked when he’d first seen them; two frightened, damaged people who clung on tight to being good in defiance of a cruel world. Now they stood together, their delight palpable, and John felt the proudest he’d ever been of being allowed to witness this moment.
“Right, hello, Carin. My name’s John. I’m Princess Sherlock’s husband. We’re here to help with a coup.”
WARNINGS FOR: Mentions of prostitution, underaged prostitution, rape and sexual slavery. This is never explicit, but if you're not comfortable with this subject matter feel free to skip this chapter.
"Or you can draw us a map," Sherlock retorted. "Kitty if Gruner sees you, if anyone in that house sees you he'll know that the jig is up. He'll take Delia, kill your friends and disappear. You know there's nothing you can do, and I know that's frustrating, but you're going to have to trust us."
“I would never kill an artist like yourself,” the man in black said, circling her with his sword still out. “Besides, you have your quest. But I can’t have you interfering with mine.”
John looked strange for a minute. Greg had seen that look a few times since he and Sherlock got together, like the man was stepping back for a moment, looking at how amazing his life was…like he'd almost missed his chance.
I'm going to start tagging requests in the chapter titles, so people can find their chapters more easily. Also, would it help if I went back and marked them as Victorian or Modern (or both, occasionally?)
Watson’s whole body ached. How could he help, what could he say, what could he do? Desperately, his mind seized on the one question he could ask. “You call it comfort…” he said slowly. “But you don’t usually refer to it as such.”
"Thank you." John kissed him hard. "Let's go get Anderson. Do you know where the Zoo of  Death entrance is?"
Jim is a psychopath. He’s been off the charts of every test. Sometimes, just for fun, he’ll try to get a normal person’s answers. He’s only managed it once.
Mycroft waved a hand, trying his best to shake the strange feeling. “Not all, Inspector. May I offer you some tea?”
“Daughter, you’ll do no such thing,” Holmes said sternly, putting a hand on Watson’s shoulder. “I’m rather fond of him.”
The basement of the Zoo of Death, far below the animals Jamiarty had collected to kill, was the Pit of Despair.
“You’re trying to make me give something away. It won’t work.” But there was nervousness in the man in black’s eyes now, and Ireni could see it. The Princess shifted restlessly, but Ireni wasn't paying attention.
Martha’s eyes filled with tears. “We had one daughter, and she married and had a son. When her child was two, the three of them moved, and a few years later we heard that they’d…that they were all killed.”
Mrs. Hudson nodded and left the room. Watson counted her steps in a haze. He didn’t quite hear her door close, but Holmes must have, because he sprang forward and grabbed Watson in a tight embrace, leaning carefully to keep from putting pressure on his wounded leg.
The second thing was the group of soldiers waiting for them. Prince Jamiarty was at the front. “Surrender,” he said.
