turning our furniture into kindling!”
he told it. But in Sherlock’s experience, difficult situations took thought. Easy words, happy words, generally fell out of people. Ergo, John was not happy.
“Let me get behind you, so if you topple down the stairs, I won’t have to spend the rest of my day getting you back to hospital.”
John laid waiting, nothing happening, wondering what Sherlock would do next.  And though there was nothing in particular that came to mind, it was still unexpected.  And unexpectedly pleasurable.
“What the—?” Stung, John thumbed out an answer.
I cover my face with my hand, moaning.  “Jesus, you didn’t really say that, did you?”  How did I miss
“You are a horrible liar, John.  Always have been.  You have not stepped into a bookshop in years, and I do not know what you are lying about, but you
“What is it, Greg? What aren’t you telling me?”
Sherlock was alive.
that objectionable, he thought.
Seeing my hesitation, John stands and places his hands on the back of mine, holding them as he puts them on the band of his jeans.  I shadow him.  Gripping the band with my fingers, I wait as he pulls his glans out so as not to get caught, and together we pull his jeans and pants down his hips.
Bundling ourselves under the covers, as we caress flesh we have explored countless times, we listen to each other’s sighs of contentment.  At 66 and 71 years of age, our bodies do not respond as quickly or intensely as they once did, but the fullness in our hearts is more than enough to compensate for whatever our physiologies lack.  And, as thrilling as an orgasm is, even after all this time nothing thrills me more than to, quite simply, touch John.  To touch him with the pads of my fingers.  To touch him with my lips. It is as if every time I do, somehow I am made whole again…and again and again, a sensation I will never get used to.
What?  Just now?  What took so long?  He should have arrived nearly 24 hours ago.  But with further scrutiny I see that the text was sent at 7:45…yesterday morning.  And there are no others. Why is there only one?   Did he not wonder why I did not answer?  And why does he not tell me more?
The edges of Sherlock’s mouth quirked as he saw John giggle, unable to keep himself from joining in.  They lied there laughing, not really knowing what they were laughing about.  But it felt good after all the tension, all the uncertainty there had been since they had re-discovered each other the night before.  And when the laughter died down, as they caught their breathe, Sherlock grew serious once again.
“We do these things, John.  How will your book help?”
“Home.  Right.”  John scoffed bitterly.  “I’m a wanted felon, or don’t you remember.  Besides, it hasn’t been much of a home since Mary shot you.”
”  Clearly she thinks I am obtuse.
He remained seated, watching the clock on the wall, ignoring the chaos that resulted from the mysterious boom.  Ten, nine, eight… he counted slowly until he reached ‘one’.  The facility alarm went off, alerting those present of imminent danger.  A little late for that, Sherlock thought wryly.  More importantly, the alarm signaled that the locks on the prison doors were now deactivated.  Looking over to where John milled with several others in apparent confusion about what to do, he caught his eye and tilted his head toward the door.
“Where’s Sherlock?” He needed to see Sherlock.
“Sherlock, soon they will play something less brisk; go dance with thy mother.  Colin cannot watch after her the entire evening; he be newly married.”  John’s knee bounced, and his whole body swayed back and forth in rhythm with the music.
I take a fortifying breath and nod my head, “Yes.”  I nip my bottom lip, bracing myself.  What will this man who never ceases to surprise me do next?  My eyes and nostrils flare in anticipation.
Getting out of the cab, Simon swept his hand in a wide arc, motioning Spencer to go ahead of him. “We’re going upstairs.” And as he looked around, the nerves in his stomach started to settle; as far as he could tell, they had arrived at their destination without being followed. It was a victory, albeit a small one compared to the one to follow—getting Rose safely back. But he couldn’t help but recognize that Rose or no Rose, his quest to be Known, to be Famous, was over. After this, he would never be able to complete his mission.
“Yes?”  He is watching me apprehensively.  Of what he is afraid I do not know.  I can only hope he is not afraid of
“Thank god, you’re awake.”  Mycroft arose from his chair and stood over where his brother laid, not quite sure what to do once he got there.
“Give me your mobile.”  Mycroft held out his hand, silently demanding it be placed in his palm.
“I am well aware Heaven is not your first choice, but given time I’m sure you will come to see it is an ideal location.  To aide you in your transition, I’ve secured a private room for you to rest until you’ve had time to adjust to your new surroundings.”
“I am thinking I have things to do.”   I wiped my hands on my apron, and, untying it and laying it neatly on the bed, I walked out of the bedroom.
His knife mid-spread on his toast, he looks up at me, confused.
Leaning down to kiss Mary one more time, John shut her door and waved as she backed out of the driveway to the road.
“Ahhh, that’s why you came—”
“Oh, Dad! Not everyone in London is a pervert or a serial murderer! That’s what you get from knowing Uncle Sherlock for so long.”  She winks at me over John’s shoulder.
“Yes, yes, I know of what it means. But Eduard? Dead? That makes no sense.”
“Thank God, brother, you live!”
John's hand shot out and grasped Sherlock around his wrist.  “
“No,” Sherlock shook his head. “James is Simon’s latest victim. Forced to jump to her death, making it appear to be suicide. Even had a note.”
“No, Sherlock.  What I want to talk about is…sex.”
Affronted, Sir John opened his mouth to object to being spoken to in such a way, when he saw the quirk at Sherlock's mouth reappear. Brazen bastard, he thought, unable to stifle a mirroring smile.
Sherlock’s heart fluttered, erratic in its anticipation.
Just as I pull my jeans on, I hear the front door open, then quietly shut.   Sherlock!  Tugging my jeans the rest of the way up, I’m still zipping them as I hurry out of the bedroom.
like a man who had been, well, you know.
“Sherlock.”
As always, love and gratitude to my Mega Beta, Burning_Up_A_Sun.  Thank God I don't have to deserve her, because I never would.
As she is in many things, Katie is punctual; the baby is due to arrive almost exactly 8 hours after she texted John.   When we arrive at hospital, Paul is already in the birthing room, as are his parents, but John refuses to go in without me; only four people are allowed.  He and I would make five.
“But that was not on your list.”
made him feel better.
I consider his question.  It is a fair one.  I do not move from where I am; I think it will be easier to tell him if I do not look at him. Though I have nothing to hide, it is so uncustomary for me to speak at length of personal thoughts that have nothing to do with my work, I am uneasy.
I nod my head and take another deep breath, unable to tear my eyes away from his.  “Yes, John.  I need you.”
“You do it all the time, John,” I said simply.  It was a fact.
“I’m getting dressed.  Isn’t that
“If your father will pay so handsomely for your return, then why do these men not take the purse gladly?  I have little doubt they could buy a small farm were the reward so generous.”
person I’m going to be intimate with is
“Hi!”
“Jesus, Sherlock, I’m sorry.  You were talking in your sleep and I wanted to hear what you were saying…”  The words rushed out of John’s mouth in his embarrassment.  Christ, now he’d probably have to move out; he would never be able to look Sherlock in the face again.
No, delight.  Perhaps an old friend come to visit.  Muffled voices exchanged presumed pleasantries for several minutes.  Mrs. Hudson waffling on about lord knows what as she walked back to her flat.  Where did the other voice go?  A man’s.  What men friends does Mrs. Hudson have?
“Uh, no.  No, not at all.”  The smile disappears from his mouth, but not his eyes.  “Lie down, love, whilst I finish packing for us.  You need to rest.  Did the infirmary give you anything for the pain?”
The hand on Sherlock’s shoulder squeezed, a gesture of reassurance. It didn’t reassure. This hallucinogenic journey had twisted him. Its long, dark tunnel pushing his psyche to what might be its breaking point.
“Be this true?”  Sir John asked, Sherlock’s quick nod telling him it was.  “There could be many explanations for her condition, but prove to me you have this special power to know things you have not seen.  Tell me something about me.” Sir John watched Sherlock’s eyes roam over every bit of him, from the tips of his shoes to the top of his hat, blue eyes shifting about until Sir John had been thoroughly examined.  Just as he was becoming uncomfortable under the penetrating inspection, Sherlock spoke.
Sherlock turned back to John and Mary, seeing the look in her eyes that held the same challenge as the nearly undetectable stress on ‘
To test his supposition, Sherlock first looked at the screen and away, focusing on the movements of his eyes in relation to his head and neck, and then he mimicked what he had seen James do. He was right. Normally, the eyes and head move independently of each other, but James’s hadn’t, making her motions feel inhuman. Robotic.
~~**~~
thou,” he said, a smile spreading wide across his face; it had been forever since he last had last seen his love.
With one last look at the sleeping man, he left the tent.  Instead of finding two squires guarding the camp, Aldus sat alone, warming up meat left from the night before.
you?” He asked in disbelief.  Not in way that indicated that it was the most repellent thing he had ever heard, but in a tone that said he was genuinely puzzled.  Where had
“Yes, Mary is fine.”
And as John walked off, twas as if he felt Sherlock’s eyes bore into his back.
The mood of the crowd had shifted. Some people still chanted: “Hang him!  Hang him!” But many others, their brows furrowed as they cast puzzled glances in the direction of the quarrel, became angry at the interruption: “What be ya waitin’ for?  On with it!”
“I…I just wish Katie had her mum here.  She should have a mother with her at such an important time.  I know she says it doesn’t bother her, that I am more than enough for her, but…”
Reaching down and pulling the blade from the leather, I nonchalantly dry it and place it in the rack.  At least, my hope is I look nonchalant, for inside I am trembling at nearly scarring for life the man who is without flaw.  Maybe if I pretend it did not happen John will quickly forget.
He also knew it never did any good to lie to John; in the end he always found out anyway.  And maybe this way they could get the arguing out of the way now instead of postponing it until later.
I hear noise in the distance. I think it is John’s voice, or maybe a vacuum cleaner… I am not quite sure.
Andi took a photo of the monitor with her mobile and sent it to Mycroft.
Mr. Holmes stood, looming over her in the enclosed space. “And under what name shall I have your new identification made?”
Katie and Paul were to have taken the cruise themselves, along with JJ, (Our grandson!), but at the last minute, Paul’s firm acquired a new client who insisted Paul was the only one he would work with on a project with a deadline of December 27.
“Here,” I say, as I straddle his knees, and with a hand on each of his shoulders, I push him down onto the bed.
“Four-thirty five.”  I am puzzled, why is he asking me this?  Why did he not look at the watch himself?
’ face disappears and a smile replaces it.
John typed, his sentences lurching forward as Sherlock waited to learn something he hadn’t already known.
With a last look at the man he knew would take a lifetime to forget, John turned around and left the flat.  He had put himself, his heart, on the line, but he couldn’t regret it.  Had he not, he would not have known the indescribable relief of telling the greatest man he had ever known, that he loved him.
Walking into the shop I spy a sign in the window I’d rather Sherlock not see; I don’t want to spoil the surprise just yet.  Pointing across the street, “Sherlock, honey, look!  A sale on microscopes!”  A weak distraction, I know, especially as the business is a bakery, but I didn’t have time to give it any thought.  Whilst Sherlock’s head is turned, I pull him by the arm into the shop and he doesn’t see the sign.  Whew!  But stepping inside I see there’s no way to avoid him discovering my secret; two large stand-alone signs announce the book signing.  Two large signs it is impossible to avoid walking directly past.
With fingers that felt sluggish and a heart that felt more so, Sherlock typed.
“It is not you touching me that caused the nightmare, John.  It was you holding me that made me feel as if I were trapped.   The answer is very simple.  I will hold
“Sherlock?”
“I am sorry, John.”  My brows knit in consternation as I try to explain to him what I meant.  “It is just that what you do to me feels so good it is as if my body is going to jump out of its skin and my heart pounds in my ears and down to my…penis.  Never has anyone had this effect on me and it is so new and extraordinary and…and not at all dull!”  I know I am speaking too fast, but I cannot help it.  My heart ispounding at about 120 beats a minute, rushing blood to every part of my body.  My entire being is throbbing.  Throbbing with desire for John.
“I assure you, I am not.”
So deep is my sleep it is as if I die all over again…
… erect penis.
With deliberation, Sherlock turned to see who be behind him.  The man, but short distance away, reigned his horse to an abrupt stop and jutted his jaw toward Sherlock.
As he continued to touch Sherlock, a need for him deeper than any physical need, permeated him.  He needed to show this man, in the most primal way possible, how much he loved him.  How necessary he was to his very existence.
Too content to trouble himself with finding the answers, he decided was a thicker coverlet than he had thought.  That the fire had been strong enough to last all night.  Bunching his pillow, he huddled further into the bed, his buttocks bumping into something firm as he wriggled his hips.  Hmmmm, he did not remember lying so close to the wall when he came to bed, but then, he had been so weary he barely remembered anything at all.  Still, twas something different about the wall.  It – it moved.
(Do you need it spelled out for you?  We kiss. That is what two mature men do when they are in love.  Now go away; I have better things to do.)
I can’t resist a curious glance up when Sherlock and I step outside. As I suspected, Dr. Watson peers down at us through drawn curtains, making no move to conceal he’s doing so. And as I climb into the cab, Sherlock has already given the cabbie our destination and has tucked himself onto the far side of the seat, creating as much space between us as possible.
“You remember what I told you to say?  And that you are to act as haughty and bored as possible?  Take thy time as you search the house.  No overseer is going hurry.  You have to appear as if you be a public servant doing tedious work.”
right, Sherlock, and you’re
As if she were an annoying fly flittering about his head, Sherlock waved away Andi’s repeated plea.
“In the years I've known you I've never seen you so robust, Sherlock.  You're not as young as you used to be and it's time you slow down. Try it out.  If you don't like it the flat is always here for you. ”
After a lengthy deliberation, I state simply and honestly, “I cannot remember there ever
“Exactly.”
Pat, pat, pat.
The body he held in his arms trembled.
“Sherlock…” John breathes, as touched as I by the sight before us.
“Be my guest,” Sherlock said, hoping that by the time John brought the chair over, he could get the grin on his face— the one that likely made him appear somewhat deranged—under control.
“Would you get the key and set my hands free.”  Gone was the demanding voice, replaced by a gentle appeal.
He waits patiently until I am ready.
“You don’t have a fever.  Do you feel unwell?  Sometimes delirium doesn’t manifest itself with a high temperature, but it is rare.”
“Yes, you do.  Now what time did I leave?”
Hardly had he hit Send before he received a reply.
Shoving the sock back onto John’s arm, Sherlock nabbed the bits of face and hair that had fallen off, slapping them on in a Picasso‑esque fashion; Simon hadn’t demanded perfection. And capturing the image haphazardly on his mobile, he ran across the room to Simon’s note for the email address and hit Send. Almost immediately, a text with a link arrived.
“Then that is what you should have said.”
In attendance at the wedding of one of John’s Army mates, Sherlock and John sat at their table, watching the crowd around them dance.  Sherlock’s shoe tapped in time with the lively music, the fingers of one hand dancing on his knee, his other hand holding John’s beneath the cloth covered table.  John’s free hand drummed the table top as his eyes followed the wedding guests, the longing he felt to join them badly concealed.
But Sherlock thought not.  Surely selfishness be the root of Cedric’s acts.  There be something he wants.
“Here, take mine, you are shivering.” I take my gloves off and hand them to him, but he shakes his head at them.
Mycroft had seen the pictures.  And Mycroft was never wrong.
“When did you become so philosophical?  I cannot say it suits you.”
Sherlock swiveled his gaze around the room, texting Andi when he didn’t see anything obvious.
Flick.
“You be all right, Sherlock?”  John asked, a frown creasing his brow.
I need to know as soon as possible.
What kind of spell has this man cast on me?! I do not believe in witches or spirits, yet what other explanation can there be?
“That was a long time ago and that was different.  It was consensual sex with…”
“Mr. Holmes, I apologise for interrupting you,” He says as He ruffles through a stack of documents several metres high, “but that information is many, as one would put it in Earthly terms, decades old.  The characteristics you mention reached their peak in your early thirties.  Beyond that point you exhibited increasingly frequent instances of kindness and thoughtfulness.  Many years’ worth of altruistic acts amply counterbalance any of the less desirable traits you wish to emphasise.”
John thought back to Andi rousing him from a dead sleep, wresting his covers from her in protest. But she hadn’t played fair. Not only had she somehow enlisted Geoff’s help, using a
“He’s gone and made himself a hostage; that’s what he’s done. Swapped himself for a young girl whose family says they can’t pay the ransom. I’ve sent a car for you. Bring your gun.” The line went dead.
I hear his voice as if he is right next to me.
of doors in London, the boys kept themselves quite amused.  Public places weren't off limits as a rule, they just knew it took a little extra finesse to keep their private activities private.
But as he drew closer, all he could think of be that his world felt right again; it had been so dark all day.
thinking?”
Not sure what he would find, but certain it wouldn’t be his sleeping friend, Sherlock ripped the covers off the mound in the bed.  Instead of John, carefully molded piles of blankets and towels rested on the mattress in a rough approximation of a sleeping body.
“That is not a no. And even if it were, this is
“Of course!  Do you want me to call someone?  Your doctor?”  The man sitting across from her became alarmed at her distress.
Sherlock couldn’t be sure if he smirked. “Why, Molly. I thought you knew me better than that. Move out of view if you want plausible deniability.”
Faster than any small man has the right to move, John sprung out of his chair.  Throwing the paper down, unconcerned as it flapped chaotically to the floor, he rushed over to where Sherlock stood just about to nip at one of the small succulent leaves.
“Looks like he just died in his sleep.  Looks right serene to me, I can’t imagine someone thought it was murder.  Wouldn’t mind goin’ like that myself someday.”  He almost looked wistful at the thought of leaving the world so quietly.
“Mmmm hmmm…”  Against my will, my back arches as I recall the intense pleasure of John’s lips on this most intimate part of me.
Just the day before, John had been certain, had
A voice whispered in his ear, deep and low, “I’m sorry, John.  I didn’t mean to leave you.  You were the best and wisest man I ever knew; my life would have had no meaning had I not met you.  I never told you, but I will tell you now.  I loved you.  I love you.”
I have a brilliant idea!  Yes, I know. It is a redundant statement as I am
But he didn’t care; John was here, alive, and Sherlock would be happy to be imbecilic the rest of his life,
“Whilst I cannot say I will be perfect, I can promise to, from this day forward, strive to show you every day how very much I appreciate and care for you.  I love you, John.
—the pressure inside him had mounted.
“I prefer to call it bargaining, Mr. Holmes,” Nika said, forcing herself to be steady; if she showed fear, she would lose. She wouldn’t lose what she already had, he couldn’t take that from her, but she could lose what she could already taste, freedom.
Walking into the sitting room, the TV is turned on low to one of those insidious shopping channels.  For some reason John John has been fascinated by the hostess, a slim, animated woman with long blonde hair and blood red nails, and a way of ending everything she says as a question.  I don’t see the appeal.
“Thou can
Flummoxed by Sherlock's audacity, Sir John nonetheless said, "Yes. Yes, of course. Very well, then, we will go find this woman of whom you speak."
As the helicopter came into view it shined a bright light onto two downed men and one fearful, but erect, one, whose hands were held high in anticipation of what was to come next.
“Watch out…!”  A shout escapes me as he passes a lorry, the oncoming car in the other lane far too close for my taste.  Jesus fucking Christ.
I frantically search my brain for possible causes to this anomaly.  Perhaps I hit my head and lost my memory.  Or maybe I have an undiagnosed sleep disorder.  Most alarming, I consider the possibility that John has drugged me to avenge himself for the countless experiments I have conducted on him; he told me he forgave me, but perhaps he has been lying in wait all these years for a time when I am at my most vulnerable.  (It was for science, John!)
“Is there something wrong with your hearing or is it with your comprehension of a simple question? I said, are you MI-5 or Scotland Yard?”
As the prisoner and the guard arrived at John’s cell, the guard unlocked the door and pushed the prisoner in, telling him ‘take whichever bunk you like.  Just shut up will’ya.”
He is lying facing me.  Watching me.  Smiling at me.
), but Andi understood what Kaur said; that was the important thing.
“My precious girl,” she whispered to the small, wizened face she held in her arms as she sat down in the chair.  “You are more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.  Your daddy is going to fall in love with you.”
Opening the door, Sherlock shined his torch, first at John’s bed. It was empty. Myrtle’s chair, too. No sound from the house reached his ear save for that of the low hum of the refrigerator. Rushing inside, Sherlock called John’s name, Myrtle’s. Switching the lights on room after room. But no one was there. No John. No night nurse. In fact, he didn’t recall seeing an MI-5 agent out front.
Hearing the alarm, John awoke with a start, his heaviness making him feel as if he must have slept the sleep of the dead.  Lifting up his hand to rub his eye, he found that there was one… minor problem.
I wait, giving him time to think. (And giving me time to swoon over that thick, rich hair. Unprofessional, I know—tell someone who cares.) To many of us, dating is as natural as breathing; yet to others, it’s not a matter to be undertaken lightly. And worse yet, to the very few, to embark on a romantic journey is antithetical to everything they have ever believed, as if it were a life principle to not “get involved.” Since Mr. Holmes is here, it appears the last is not the case. Unless that is why he hesitates…
The only problem was they kept their true relationship hidden from the two people that counted the most.  Themselves.
did you do, Sherlock?”
“Who?  Katie?”  John answers.  “Every day.  But it’s not unbearable because I know she has a husband who loves her; Paul is a good man.”
I must amend myself.  I would shrivel up into a tiny, tiny little ball and hide under the sofa with the other mites and drift towards a sad and lonely death.  No, John must stay.  With me.
John had seen the unused room upstairs and intuitively knew what was going through Sherlock’s mind.  Jesus, this was just getting harder.
Pushing the money back into my pocket, John wraps his arms around me.
“Yes, John, Moriarty’s web died just as he did.  But this,
With the late afternoon sun blaring through the window, he squinted at the screen, blinking away the sleep until he could see clearly.
When he either didn’t hear her or he ignored her, she said his name more sharply. “Sherlock.”
No, they would not talk about any of that right now.
“Of course, I remember.  How could I forget?”  John’s groin tightened at the memory.  He nibbled at the finger that Sherlock slid into his mouth, sucking it. Savouring it with the roll of his tongue.
“Chip, puppet, dog,” John said as if thinking out loud. “Puppet, chip, dog. Chip the puppet. Chip the dog. The puppet dog.”
John rubbed his hands together, warding off, if not a chill, because twas not overly cold, but his unease.  It did not work; his worry grew.  If Sherlock be detained, twas not because he sat down to tea.
He had few qualms about his methods.  The stakes were too high to make an error this time, for he had a date.
"Idiot."
He is shocked.  Why should he be?
Turning on the small beside lamp in Mycroft’s guest bedroom, Sherlock saw what he wasn’t able to see in the dark…the puffy, red-rimmed eyes, the almost undetectable tremble in her lower lip.  Clear indications the woman sitting before him was distraught by the events of the day.
Coughing a laugh, John nodded.
time trying to get John to enjoy a trip he has always wanted to take.
Sherlock took in a sharp breath: this was video from the day before, when he and John were in the park putting out bait for Mayhew. And it was from John’s point of view. No, the camera was
He looks interested as he wipes his hands dry on the towel. He is always interested to hear what I am working on.  At least he is when I start explaining it to him, then his eyes start to glaze over and he says "uh huh, uh huh" as if he is listening, but I know I have lost him.
Sherlock stepped out onto the stoop, glancing around to see who had brought the dog and seeing no one. “Dogs don’t ring bells.”
“Stay with me, stay with me,” John implored, the words sounding like a prayer.
Simon wrote on:
Mistletoe.
Yes, had John ended his life due to his inexcusable mistakes he knew there was no way he could live with himself.
“Yes.  Of course, John.”  I will bring my concern to his attention at another time; it is of little importance when he is in such pain.
no one,
So here I am in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, North America, 5217 miles from the cottage.  But I have not left home; he lies beside me.
“And so?  Tis probably just someone coming down the road, or hunting; we will meet up with them soon enough if they be travelers.  Oh! Maybe tis that Gareth fellow.”  Aldus shuddered.  “We had best be most alert.  We do not need more trouble.
It is early afternoon.  This is what my day has consisted of thus far:  I watched John lying in bed until he arose for the day.  I sat in the bathroom and watched him shave. (He would not let me watch him shower.  He said we are not far enough along in our relationship…yet - whatever that means.)  I watched him make breakfast eat wash the dishes read the paper start his new novel wash and iron our clothes leave the house to go for a long walk come back from the walk balance his checkbook make an entry in his blog take a nap.
I mentally don my deerstalker and inquire to no one in particular as to the means of death.  “Poison?  Smothering?  Mad hound, perhaps?!”
Sherlock and me, me and Sherlock.  Any world around us has vanished.
, you idiot!”
“NO, I’m not jealous, like I said, I just would have thought…”
Just as she arrived back in the visitor room, a deep boom resonated through the building.
Looking up and down the street John took in the dank dreariness of it.  Took in the old man carrying a cage of chickens, their squawks and flapping wings compelling him to hold the cage as far from him as possible, but not so far that he be relieved of their furor.  Took in the exasperated woman who swatted a small boy’s bum, and instead of being chastised, the boy stuck his tongue out and taunted her by running out of her reach.  These be what John’s eyes looked upon, but not what he saw.  Never out of his sight be the house into which Sherlock went.  Knowing he had told Sherlock not to hurry.  Knowing that Sherlock should not be in harm’s way.  But John worried, all the same.
Even Anderson, ever the skeptic, poked his head around the corner as he paused in his pursuit of fingerprints to hear what Sherlock had to say.  This
“Well, that certainly puts my proposal to shame, doesn’t it.  At least
”  Calling after him, “Give my love to Katie and Paul.”
“So, they’ll just let us saunter in, will they? And with a dog, at that.”
you, John!
“So you can dream about Sir John and the servant?” Cedric scoffed.  “I want no details.”
“Simon was in your regiment?” Sherlock said, not quite believing he had heard correctly. If that were true, then—
I cannot bring myself to say ‘yes’, to verbally agree to exile myself from him for one minute more. John will have to read into my silence whatever he will.
He hesitated before finally walking over and sitting down on the sofa, reclining to let John pull the covers over him.  This really wasn’t
His shower now forgotten, John shook his head.  “No.  Not a mate of mine.  He was injured and I was helping him out.  Nothing more.”  His mind raced, trying to figure out how to defend himself.  The odds were not in his favor; he had no weapon and the other man easily had 4 stone on him.
“Sherlock, what the—” But the door that slammed in his face was indifferent to what he had been going to say, and John stomped down the stairs, grousing. Thinking about the many ways in which he would like to murder Sherlock.
“I said, why not try an image search?”
With a vague look of annoyance on his face, “Yes, I’m thinking; I just can’t remember where I left them.” Scanning the room, “I was using them just a bit ago; they can’t have gone far.”

eat Christmas dinner in your bedroom, even if you do have a two way radio,” our exasperated mum would tell him.), and parents who everyday acted as if they had met and fallen in love the day before.  Sigh.  The crosses I have had to bear.
“What is John talking about?” I thought.
“John,” Sherlock admonished.  “Brothers?  We look nothing-”
“Yes, Sherlock?”
“But John, the page is blank.”
“Now this.”
, I will be able to think again.  I know I will.
Our heart.
My thumbs hesitate over the keys, ready to compose a response. What do I say?  I have already asked him many times what he is doing and he has not told me; I do not wish to annoy him.  And I am less than adept at mindless chatter.
Sherlock grabbed the wrist attached to the hand still on his shoulder, twisting it as he wrenched it away. And whirling around so the agent, wincing from pain, could feel the full force of his furry, Sherlock ground out, “MI-5,
prick you be.”
And think.
“Shhhh,” Andi said as soothingly as she could while her heart thumped wildly in her chest; Simon could hear everything they said. She needed to be cautious not only in what she said but in what Sherlock was allowed to say. “No need to say it right now. Let’s just say that we create a plan that we implement on
Sherlock Holmes.
“Hold on, John,” Sherlock said, exiting onto the pavement and shoving a wadded note into the cabbie’s hand. Long strides taking him into the building.
“No." And clearing his throat, John said no again, this time with unmistakable resolve. “This is my home, and this is where I ought to be.” John set the crutches’ tips onto the bottom step and hoisted himself up.
Opening my eyes I look at him.  His softened eyes.  The hand that reaches up to brush my face.
His eyes roaming my face, his hand squeezing mine, he assures me, “You are perfect, in every way.  Your brain, your heart.  You are absolutely amazing and there is no one else I would ever want here with me at this moment or any other.
here now, that’s what matters.  Besides, how could you know when I didn’t tell you?  I should have.”
I hiccup.  “Why?”
The second time was when he almost died on me after being nicked by a cab as we chased a mugger.  He stopped breathing due to his punctured lung and in my brilliance (fright) I shouted at him, startling him from his journey to the afterlife. (‘I figured it was the only way to get some peace and quiet.  I was afraid you were going to follow me to wherever it was I was going,’ he groused long afterwards.)  It still warms me to recall his gratitude for saving his life.
He moves toward me and resting his lips on me just above my clavicle, he remains motionless.
Letting his breath go, the relief in John’s eyes says it is as if a huge weight is lifted off him, as if now,
piece of possible evidence with all the care and attention it requires.
“So you aren’t…  You didn’t…  So you aren’t in love then.”  John finally managed to say.
“Give me the sword, I say.”  Sherlock reined to a halt, swinging his leg over the horse and dropping to his feet.
I stick my neck out, but as hard as I try, from where I sit I cannot see John’s chair.  John’s old chair, I mean.  I have to see it.  I drag the table a few feet over.  There!
Sanjay sat in the dark, wondering when he would ever feel safe again.
?! I wonder.  Nervous haze or not, those words should have cut through the thickest fog.
“Nothing.   I do not want you to forget.”  Ever.
Ahhhhh…
“So you keep saying. Yet, you see and hear me well enough,” Sherlock said sharply.
“Thou be not at The Slaughtered Lamb this morning when I went back for thee, and I be—I thought Cedric had found thee.”
, you idiot.  Out!”  I sweep the finger I am pointing at him toward the door.  “How dare you try to lay a hand on my fiancé!  Now, OUT!”
“Do not be so obstinate.”
It explained so much.
“No.”  Aldus shook his head in dismay.
Reason told Sherlock twas unlikely he be released at such a moment, seconds before they were hang him.  But his heart?  It did not reason.  His heart hoped, and it thumped against his chest, hard and fast.
It is rare that I get truly angry, but I do not believe that is the emotion I am feeling.  I do not think it is fear, either.  If I am honest, I think it is terror.  Terror that I may have to one day live without the person most singular amongst all others.  Someone who has become a very part of me.
Sherlock seemed to be surprised that he was.
Later, there would be many times John wished he had told Sherlock what he had been thinking.  What he had been feeling.  There would be many times he wished he had told Sherlock that he had fallen in love with him.
“Of course.”
“Laila,
He looked over at John frequently, wishing there were something he could do to ease his discomfort.  But how did one go about easing the pain of a fractured marriage?  Sherlock did not know where to begin.  Despite his limited knowledge of human nature he recognized John’s code of loyalty.  He saw it in their own friendship; even with the pain Sherlock caused John at the time of his ‘death’, John eventually forgave him and allowed their relationship to mend.   Would it not be the same with Mary?  If John could forgive someone who was only a friend, could he not forgive the woman to whom he pledged his life?  Sherlock had no answer.  It was not his place to make judgment on what went on between a husband and his wife.
I use my sweetest voice.  “May I come in?  I can keep you company whilst you pack.  I can even help, if you like.”
A heavy breath of air left Laila; reliving the past wore her more than she thought it would.
“You’ll do as well with Tracy,” Sherlock said, missing the sarcasm.  “You don’t have to get her into bed, you just have to use your, well, charms on her.  She attends the event every year.  She’s the only one that wears a mask so she’ll be easy to spot.”
“What’s wrong?” For once, her smile was nowhere to be found.
be there,
“I thought about you, Sherlock.  I thought about you all the time.  Jesus, sometimes I think you’re the only reason I’m still alive, thinking about the day I would see you again.”
“Yes, love?”  His eyes warm.  He loves me so very much.  I have done nothing to deserve his love, and yet I find myself graced by it time and time again.
Everything
“No, honey.  You’re no warmer than me.”  John hunches his shoulders in an attempt to warm himself, cupping his hands in front of his mouth and blowing on them.  His breath leaves his mouth in billowing white puffs.
“My pleasure, but I’m not your mate. That’s over.”
I am vaguely aware that he pulls a towel out of the bedside drawer (when did you put that there?), wipes his hands and me, throws it to the end of the bed and crawls up beside me, where I can see him out of the corner of my eye.  My panting recedes as I re-oxygenate; I roll toward him and look into the kindest, most loving face I have ever seen.  I thought before that I was in love with him.  I was wrong.  It was no more than the tiniest atom in a universe filled with atoms in comparison to what I now feel; the swell of love in my heart nearly overcomes me.
John?  What is it?  What is hurting you?  You look so different than you did just a few hours ago, telling me you love me…with your mouth, your hands, your body.  Full of joy, as if life were perfect and never could be any other way.  As if you had everything you ever wanted.  Now you look as if your best friend has died.
much.”  His head cushioned by his pillow, John looks at me with such love I find it hard to breathe. “Speaking of which…”
I set the mobile down, roll toward my husband, and lightly put an arm around him.  There are too many layers of clothes and blankets between us, but it is far better than being apart from him.
I am nervous.  Why I should be, how I even have the
John’s face blurring in front of him, Sherlock pushed on. “No explanation needed, John. You had a shock that would disorient—” But a wave of lightheadedness hit him, and Sherlock grabbed for the foot of the bed to keep himself from falling.
“A car is on its way to retrieve you,” Mr. Holmes said, after having given her the briefest of summaries of what he knew. Which, in reality, was nothing. Then, uncharacteristically for someone who wielded almost limitless power, he offered a humble “Thank you, Nika” before disconnecting.
?”  Hope and disbelief mingle in his voice.
“I am dressing him.”
I fall asleep.
I cannot think of anything.  All I have been doing is sleeping and I can safely say this act has no wonderment-making capabilities.
Looking dazed, John sets back on his heels.
Sherlock struggled for something to say.  As much as he wanted to make everything better for John, he knew there was little he could do.
The smile on his face is bright.  He looks happy.  “No need to thank me, Sherlock.  The pleasure is all mine.”  He giggles, bites his lower lip (oh how I wish it is me biting it) and looks away briefly.
It scared the hell out of him.
“Well, we’ll do what we can to keep warm until furnace repair gets here; you’re already about to turn blue. I’ll get the rest of the wood for the fire, but you do know, don’t you, it won’t last even one night?”
Sherlock inserted the key into the lock of his flat in Regents Place and opened the door, his nose assaulted by the odor emanating from within.  He’d never been an especially tidy person, but even to him, the flat he looked at was slovenly and unkempt.  Mentally shrugging, he tossed his coat and scarf onto the chair sitting near the door, indifferent to the small heap his garments made when they slid off the chair to the floor.
Mycroft gazed down at his umbrella, tapping it at the vehicle floor. And when he turned to look at her, she thought she saw naked pain, but it flitted away too swiftly for her to know for sure.
...kisses me on the forehead.
Sherlock got out of the Land Rover, leaving the keys with John in case he needed to make an escape.
, I think were I to do so, amongst all his qualities ~ his beauty, his intellect (Do not tell him I acknowledge this attribute; I know I would never hear the end of it.), his patience, his ability to forgive, his loyalty ~ his strength is that which draws me to him most.  It is the foundation upon which all his other virtues rest.
They swiftly made their way to the wing of the hospital that was being renovated, Sherlock finding a room at the far end away from the workers.  Walking into a room, Sherlock took John’s hand, and shutting the door after pulling him inside, pushed him up against it with a solid thud.  By no means a novice in these situations, John quickly sized things up and taking the cue from Sherlock’s intense stare, hastily began unbuttoning the detective’s coat.  Grabbing his scarf by both ends, he pulled Sherlock against him, pressed his hand firmly at the nape of his neck and pulled him down for a blazing kiss.  With trembling fingers, Sherlock rather clumsily finished taking his coat off, allowing it to fall to the floor in a heap.
“John, you must move out.  Obviously.”
were the one who nearly rendered me unconscious with your…”
“You aren’t going to believe it, Sherlock.  Bloody hell, I don’t.”
Sir John looked down at Sherlock's bare feet. Clod-brain, he admonished himself. Why had he not thought to give the poor man shoes? Stopping Jocelyn, Sir John removed his shoes and, again riding up alongside Sherlock, held them out. To be sure they would be too small for such a tall man, but crumpled toes would be preferable to wearing no shoes at all.
His hand about to press the button, Sherlock said over his shoulder, “I’m not saying it could happen—it’s an absurd idea—but
The midnight blue suit (new), pale blue shirt (freshly pressed), and color-coordinated knit tie (tie?!) made Sherlock’s eyes almost painfully vivid, and John tried not to stare. He’d known they were blue, and a beguiling shade at that, but Jesus.
“Does thou want me?”  John asked.
His mind whirling, John grabbed the dirty clothes he’d left on the floor and shoved them on as he raced into the bedroom to retrieve his Sig Sauer.
“Come on honey, wake up.”
“No need to be so pleased with yourself.”  I try to sound stern, but I cannot maintain my pretense.  I have made John happy, and I find there is nothing in my new life with him that pleases me more.  Even if it is as a result of him trying to murder me in my sleep.
’.  He seems unimpressed; his expression has not changed.
It was very rare that anyone saw Sherlock or John without the company of the other and so, of course, the gossip flew. They lived together, they worked together, no one ever saw either with a date, so how could they
Katie lets go and I look around for a clear spot to set my overnight case.  Seeing none, I continue holding it.
Passing Sherlock on the way to the door, she held out her hand, but he deftly stepped back, avoiding her touch.  “I be so sorry, Sherlock.  I mean thee no harm.  I know twould be difficult for anyone to understand what I have done, and why, but I hope you will give me the chance to explain.  And that when you hear what I have to say, you will someday find it within you to forgive me.”
Despite being uncomfortable with such sentiments and even more uncomfortable with expressing them, John knew he couldn’t leave it there.  Couldn’t let Sherlock think that though his love would never be similarly returned, that he was not necessary to John.
Attempting to look stern, Sherlock raised an eyebrow and glared, but he had not the fortitude to maintain the pretence.
sniper bested him!  This sniper beat him at his own game; he couldn’t even commit suicide without this person getting in a shot first.  A rogue sniper, or perhaps the hired hand of someone who wanted Moriarty eliminated.  You knew Moriarty as well as I did.  He made it his business to ‘rattle the bars’ as it were, the ultimate unwanted guest, insinuating himself wherever he pleased.”
“Oh, a couple of hours, now.  Beautiful piece by the way.  New?”
Sherlock sprang upright on his knees, rounding on John. “Overboard?! If you think killing yourself is—”
Aldus and Cedric paid no heed to him when he arrived back at the camp, their conversation animated, punctuated by flailing hands and raucous laughter.
. Off. My.
to do this. Not in the stable. Not anywhere. But all rational thought fled his mind, his back arching, pushing himself into the wet warmth that gave no pause in its pursuit to pleasure him. Plush lips gripped him, pulling up the length of his shaft to suck at his tip, to roll that clever tongue around it until he thought he might go mad. And just when John thought he could bear no more, the lips slid back down until they swallowed him whole, again, and again. Whatever thin thread of resistance he had sped from his body, and John thrust into Sherlock’s mouth.
read… ‘a foolish or senseless person’?”
I see from his expression that I do not fool him, but to call me on it means he will have to admit that he knows I touched him…there.  And for some reason he is unwilling to do that.   Just as well, it is nothing about which I want to talk.

for the person they love without causing suspicion?”
My heart aches. This magnificent specimen should never,
“John, love.”
John grunted a laugh. “What else you have in there, a hat rack? A potted plant?”
It strikes me that John can hear me just fine.
“Can you get it a little closer? Thanks. From here, it looks like…it looks like an egg with glasses.”
As I peer into my microscope, I hear the kettle come to a boil and turn off.  John does not reach for it.  I take my eyes from the lens and look at the floor behind me to see John’s shoe toes pointed my way.  He is leaning against the counter, most likely watching me.  I suspect he is mentally packing his belongings.  I do not look up into his face; I do not want to see what he is thinking.  If he thinks I will help him pack he is mistaken.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and reopened them, quite sure they deceived him. And while he was rereading the stunning entry that looked quite real despite what his mind said, John deleted it.
Dammit.  Sherlock hated it when John spoke sensibly.
“Aha!  I thought you were acting suspicious that day!”  As quickly as his exuberance over not having lost his ability to act as my personal lie detector surfaces, it dies down again.  “Still, there are those other things…”
I am offended he thinks I have an ulterior motive.  Even if he is right.
He could feel Sherlock’s eyes locked on him as he stood, waiting.  Waiting for his life to take one of those dramatic turns that always seemed to happen whenever he accompanied the world’s only consulting detective.  Only
“I’m afraid I seek your assistance in a most urgent matter. I trust I’m not presumptuous in thinking that, after all this time, your offer is still valid.”
“Go ahead, I’ve got this, and Mycroft’s team just arrived outside; we’re covered.”
Mycroft. Boring.
“And what did you find?” Sherlock finally asked, growing still. Intent on her answer.
“I have money enough. I will bring ‘round another coin on the morrow.”
Oh god oh god oh god oh god john oh god john
“I didn’t know. I saw him sitting there, dressed to the nines, and I took a chance. He looked like he needed a…like he needed a friend. So, I was friendly.” Mayhew’s fear glistened on him, a thin sheen of sweat on his skin.
Minutes later, toast and tea in hand, John and I slide into the back seat of the limo, on our way to become grandparents.  As proud as I feel, I can only imagine how much more so John does.
together.”
“There be nothing more I need than thee.”  John said it simply, an absolute truth needing no explanation.
I calm.  Though I may not at this moment agree with all his words, I know he believes them; that is enough for me.
His eyes, as bright as the sun.  His lips, parted.  Sucking air in…
“I wouldn’t have. I’m on your side in this.”
He squeezes my hand and lets it go.  If I could I would cut it off and let it live with him forever and ever, but I know I will need it again someday.  Probably today.  I do not tell him things such as this, for I fear he would have me locked away just as the old woman in town who was taken to hospital (mental ward) for keeping the head of her deceased husband in the freezer.  Rather sentimental really, but apparently not everyone sees it that way.  I know John did not.  I will have to create another plan for if John goes first.
“Laila,” he said softly.  Twas a beautiful name, one that had not laid on his lips in many a year.
“Consulting Detective? How very…interesting,” they would say, while inwardly rolling their eyes in self-congratulatory superiority.
It is almost as if he is saying goodbye.  I swallow but I still cannot speak, my throat is constricted.  So I nod.  I understand, John.  You want to know that I love you
Twas as if John had waved a magic wand, that be how fast the pout transformed into a smile and shining eyes; Sherlock could not wait to share his plan with John.  And in truth, John could not wait to hear it, if for no other reason than to make Sherlock happy.
“No.  Who is he?”
His muscles tensed, on alert.  Twas not the first time that day; several times travelers had approached Sherlock.  In the end, each had failed to be cause for alarm, gentle folk who stopped to ask Sherlock if he be in need of assistance.  All dismissed with a churlish word and the flick of a hand.
“I heard thee clearly, John, and have not a clue of what thou speaks.  I go nowhere.”
“No, tis not the point, though tis quite apparent you did. Why did I do it, John? Because tis something else on which you need to focus. Something other than...” Jutting out his chin, Sherlock nodded in the direction of John’s groin. “Twas but a means to an end.”
And he realized that to believe what he’d been told, he’d had needed to see John with his own eyes.
“How do you mean?”
“But you—”
The consulting detective looked at the man Lestrade was talking to, for once his razor-sharp mind becoming dulled.  His steps slowed as he tried to comprehend who he saw before him.  He took in a sharp breath.   His heart, normally slow and steady, began to beat at an alarming rate.
“Uh, my error, Sir.  Apologies.  I will have no problem.  No problem at all.”
Today I,
“But Jo-o-o-hn,” I whine.  “We are on our honeymoon, on holiday.  A…a…sex holiday!  That is what this is!  Are we not to have fun?  You said that is why you wanted to come here.  Another rum whatchamacallit?  Please…just one more?”  I plead, holding up two fingers.
Not after so many months of waiting.  Of hoping.  Hope that waned bit by devastating bit, until he finally resigned himself to never again hearing the sound of those beloved footsteps.
“I says it again.  What I do wit my Lord’s servant aint’ none o’ your business.”
“That’s not what I’m asking.”
Returning my oxygen level to a normative state, I am able to ask, “Why did you do that?”
still, the room too void of sound.
“Thou be—thou be the—devil incarnate.”  But John could not help from angling deeper into Sherlock’s mouth, desperate for more. Desperate to make it stop before he burst.
He would have to give this some thought.  Sherlock powered down the machine and sat there for several minutes, trying to pull up the memory of John’s face, the open smile.  Remember the way he had felt when he had been with John.  As though he had been in the presence of someone who had actually wanted to be near him.
His thumb.
.  Now!  I have to get to work,” he said, his exasperation heading toward overload.
I have a confession.  As much as I enjoy thinking about John, the way he looks, the way he feels, the way he smells, the way just the twitch of his lip can make me…
, is why I don’t tell you what the story is; I want to enjoy it without knowing the end before I even get started. Or know what a complete load of bollocks it is.”
“Just say it, John,” I snapped, becoming impatient as I waited for the “but”.
“And just why do you think that?”
“Yes, your Sherlock.  Come on, up you go.  That be good.”  With John on his feet, Sherlock wrapped an arm around his waist, steering him to the stairs.  Waiting at each step whilst John fumbled to find the next one.  Catching him when he lost his balance, pitching forward.
“Your choice, Sherlock, clean up or I’ll see that someone makes you.”  Lestrade stood there for a few more moments wondering where the former Sherlock had gone.  True, when off drugs he could be a proper pain in the arse, but it was far preferable to the lifeless image before him.
I had no idea John was still armed; I thought he disposed of the firearm when Katie was born. 'A gun has no place in a home with a child,’ John declared.   I argued with him that he could safely keep it with the proper protective equipment.  With marriage, and then impending fatherhood, I knew that when he rid himself of his weapon it was one last reason he would not be a part my life.  Our life.  But here it is, ready to serve us, just as much a natural extension of John as...as....  Searching for a suitable analogy, the one that keeps pushing itself to the forefront is… ‘me’.
The build and movements of the person in the video suggested a male, likely in the 25-to-40-year-old range. He wore a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and trainers—in other words, the uniform for half the population of London. And the footage was in black and white, so that was of no help.
John stops what he is doing and sits up.  I roll onto my back to see what he is doing.
Lestrade was conflicted.  He didn’t like to interfere in other people’s business, especially between Sherlock and his brother, knowing there was no love lost there.  But this was just too much.  Sherlock was using again and he feared that one day it might be once too many.  The last thing he wanted to do was knock on Mycroft Holmes’ door to tell him his brother had died.  Of an overdose.
“I’m trying to tell you—”
Most inmates quickly learned to keep to themselves, not to do so only invited unwanted attention.  Attention that could mean anything from a beating to ridicule.  And only the truly uninitiated declared their innocence to anyone within hearing distance.  For it would be the same as declaring oneself weak, unable to fend off the aggressions of the seasoned criminal.
, to do with him? No, no time. He must have gone over it two dozen times, and one more wouldn’t help.
“If you have no reason, then there we shall stay.” When Sherlock offered no explanation, John started to walk away. Stopped by an urgent “No!” he turned back to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s mind whirled, as if somehow his brain matter had been separated from the stabilising force of gravity.  After several tries, Sherlock found the wherewithal to speak, “How long have you been here?”
“Watch for the light in the cab when I send my text,” Sherlock tells me. “For the cabbie to receive a text at the exact moment I send one to John is a near statistical impossibility.”
“If you be sure…”
Andi had been dreading this question. Every few minutes, she had been trying to reach Sherlock, with no luck. And the CCTVs at his flat, in Baker St., and in the surrounding areas revealed nothing of him. The streams at the Belgravia house, too, came up empty handed. There was nothing to be done but to tell Mycroft the truth.
“Yes.”
“I will be back soon.  No need to look so pleased with yourself.”
Remarkably, he does…with a little help from number 57.
--------------------------
“I love you, too, honey; now head this way.”  John puts his hands on my waist, and walking behind me, bulldozes me through the crowd, my drink sloshing out the top of its uncovered container.
"I do, Sir. Simon's at an employee entrance on the west side of the building." Andi kept her voice low, so Rose wouldn't hear. She'd stuffed the poor dog's ears with tissue, but the information was too sensitive to take a chance that Simon would hear what was being said. "There’s something else you should know. Sherlock finally turned his mobile on, and its coordinates have been identified.”
“What do you mean, then?”
He shrugs.  “I was curious to see how far you’d go.  And to be honest, it was thrilling watching you; it’s been a long time since you’ve gotten to play a role.  Every moment was fascinating.  Everything about you fascinates me.  Always has.”
—Sherlock fled the flat, ignoring Bayers pleas to be released.
And, as if he remembered that he does, indeed, have manners, the man holds out his hand to shake mine and says, “Of course. So sorry. Dr. John Watson, Sherlock’s, uh, flatmate. He knows you’re coming? He didn’t say anything about, a, uh...,” he looks again at the box. Its presence seems to fluster him.
“Say it!”
I practically bark out, “Because I can
John struggled for the right words.  Though it seemed wholly insufficient, he wanted thank Sherlock.  Wanted to somehow tell Sherlock how filled with love for him he be, sure he would fall far short in any attempt to tell Sherlock how much he meant to him.
“I be with Sir John last time he be here, and I know where you can get some of what you need.  Tis a blacksmith Sir John has used who-”
Whilst John waited for an answer, he listened to the breeze whistle through the treetops. To the patter of rain hitting the ground as it diminished from fat drops to a slow drizzle.  Letting it lull him.  Letting it calm his restless mind so twould clear for the coming challenges.
?”  I snake a middle finger along the inside of his thigh, and I’m uncertain whether the shiver I feel is his or mine.
I go to the kitchen to boil cups of tea for Katie and me; I have acquired John’s lifelong habit of making tea when I am unsettled.  I cannot say it calms me, but it gives me something to do.
“I need no help; I be not a child.”  John’s appearance silenced the other men.  He shuffled to a makeshift seat and sat down, grimacing when his body inelegantly landed on the hard surface.
With every touch, every sigh, from Sherlock, John could feel more of his former self resurrected.  Could feel new life breathed into him.  Could feel that not only was it not wrong to be near Sherlock again, but that nothing, absolutely
“Mycroft works from home?” Sherlock asked, uncomprehending of how the brother he knew, the one who thrived on being at the epicenter of power, could consider a life that did not revolve around bustling London. “The government allows this?”
He saw Sherlock practically press his nose up to the screen, peering at it as though John was mere inches away from him.
“He is dead, John.”
“I be showing him how to hold himself,” Aldus whinged. “All I did was position his arms.  I have no idea why he be so angry.”
Perhaps the inevitable could be postponed…
Sherlock had never held hands like this with anyone before aside from the girl in year six who, fancying him, had snuck her hand into his as she stood next to him in choir practice.  Her hand had been clumsy and sticky and when it had squeezed his, his stomach had roiled in revulsion.
He smiles…I have pleased him.  I like to please him.  “Oh.  Well.  Right then.”
Following after him into the bedroom, I wrap my dressing gown tighter around me, hugging myself.  Protecting myself against the cool night.  Against my unease.
His breathing becomes slow and steady and his hand stops moving, laying limp on my head.  He rolls over away from me to lie on his favored side, mumbling something unintelligible as he drifts into sleep.
“Who do you love, ‘too’, Dad?”
“Sir, I—” began the agent.
The familiar cry jarred Sir John awake. Scrambling to his feet, he flew in the direction of the shouting, his heart pounding. Had Merek and Henry found Sherlock? Had they overpowered his squires with the intent to once again try to drown the defenceless servant?
“I do, too, John.”
“Yes, my dear?  What troubles thee?”
Sherlock’s sudden inability to breathe may have had something to do with John’s weight on him, but John didn’t think that was entirely the case seeing as his hand was rhythmically stroking the engorged shaft and their mouths were clamped together so tightly there was little room for air to intrude.
Sherlock sat there, uncomfortably aware of John’s need for an explanation.  He wanted to lie to John, had
“You be not our Knight,” Cedric protested.  “I be the squire of the body; you have no right order me or Aldus.”
to be needed.  By Sherlock.
“What?”
Sherlock,” John mocked playfully. “First let me thank your friend.
“I love you, too.”
“Calm down, Sherlock!  It wasn’t an accusation.  I’m merely trying to make a point.  May I proceed?”
“Twas what true?” Though his head turned to John, Sherlock still had a look that said his concentration twas elsewhere.
I move next to him, close enough to hear him breathing, close enough that should one us move we would brush against each other.  (You look so sad, John; what do you need?  How can I make you feel better?)  For once, being the smartest person does me no good; I have no idea how to comfort John.
“Sir John,” Colin affirmed.
kiss and snake my hand into his bathing trunks.  But he will have none of it; he pulls his head away, my hand out of his trunks, and glares at me.
Were I to hear anyone else make such declarations, I would scoff, immediately analysing their food and drink for hallucinatory additives.  But as I say the words, I know for myself there are none truer.  To my great fortune, John is not me; he does not scoff.
“Yeah, he looks familiar,” John said. “Don’t know his name, but I saw him there a few times. Always alone, of course. And he didn’t drink. I mean, not alcohol. Had fizzy water whenever I saw him.”
John couldn’t help but finally look at Sherlock.  “Is that all?!  You are getting engaged to be married, the biggest event of your life, and I didn’t know?!  I mean, not that it’s not fine, but I would have thought you would have told me.  After all, I thought at this point we considered ourselves pretty good friends.  Friends tell friends these things.”
), say simply, “Trust me. I know.”
want to keep on, at least for a while longer?”  I will defer to his wishes.  If he answers ‘yes’, I will do my best to be more cooperative.  But if he answers ‘no’, the barricade between us will disappear faster than a humming bird flaps its wings.  I hold my breath, uncertain what I want the answer to be.
One more look and he knew for sure it was the face he had seen earlier.  No one could forget eyes like that, they were almost catlike.  Penetrating and aware.
Walking to a bed, Sherlock sat on its edge, tossing clothes to the side as he bared himself to the waist. “Here,” he said. His back to John, he held out the mazer.
“It seems I have little choice.”
Sherlock solved the problem for him. Snapping out of his daze, Sherlock spun and headed for the bedroom.
Half way to 221b, Sherlock slowed his pace, deliberating his next move. Knowing that running away was not the answer.
Or ever will.
And Sherlock realized he would never fully capture the complexities of John’s memories, no matter what he saw John watching or heard John saying or listening to. While the discovery of the focused vision was useful, because a memory’s data was made up of so much more than what one saw or heard, John’s memories wouldn’t reveal his feelings or what he was thinking. What sensations arose in his body.
"Ahhh, I see you have your spirits back," Sir John chuckled, pleased that Sherlock appeared far healthier than the last time he saw him. "Why lash out? They mean you no harm. They apply the herbs for your own good so that you can mend."
John wanted to shout, but twould be no use rushing Colin; he would say what he had to say in due time.
“Silly man.  Nowhere else holds any appeal for me.”
Sherlock gasped.
the blows inflicted by barbed wire lashing at fragile flesh.  Wire that had ravaged the body he now held so dear.  As he had listened to the story he had held his hand to his mouth, holding back the sobs as he was told they had been endured for him.  For
No one alive knew her real name.  No, there
time it had the potential to be far more devastating than any he had ever known.
Because his thumb again moves against my palm, and only someone who does not love me completely would want to reduce me to a heap of boneless flesh as John is about to do.
Too soon the show, and the moment, is over and John disengages himself from my arms, ready to move on.  His hand on my face I am bestowed one more kiss, a kiss telling me how very much he loves me.  I nuzzle into his neck, my lips tingling from his salty perspiration.
“Of what is this ‘miracle’ balm made?”
“What?!”
“No John, I don’t wear dresses.  I did it because, well, I didn’t know if you would accept me any other way.  I didn’t know if you would want to kiss me as
What did I see in his eyes this time?  Something he has hidden…
“Yes, honey?” His thumb strokes my neck and I cannot breath.
“No, I’ve got it; go back to whatever you are doing.  Maybe now that you know you’ll have time to think, you can get started right away.”
John watched Sherlock retreat.  Watched the tall, dark figure get smaller, less distinguishable in the fading light.  If he weren’t so disheartened, he would have smiled when he saw the detective turn his coat collar up against the cool, evening breeze.
“Yes, honey?”
He looked around, stopping short. He no longer knelt in the cemetery; he knelt on his own bed with the pile of used tissues. In his own room. No sign of Stamford. No black cab.
John knew why he himself thought so, but he found that in general others found Sherlock objectionable.
“Pretend I be stupid.”  John had sighed, weary of the game.  Knowing twas not a game to Sherlock, but that Sherlock assumed John understood what he said.
“I remember because every “little” thing you say is important.  So what would you like to do? We could find a small flat near Katie and Paul and then we can see little Jo-, I mean, hmmm, John John, anytime you like.”
"All right, the squires will soon have everything readied to leave. Would you...are you..." Becoming tongue tied, Sir John wondered what it was that flustered him. In his life, he had spoken to kings and archbishops with confidence, ease, and yet a servant made him stammer.
“Believe me, it is the last thing on my mind.”  The horror on Sherlock’s face almost made John laugh.
The second time their hands came together, each man had a sense of wholeness.  As if they were meant to be.  Meant to always be.  Together.
“Mmmm?”  I murmur, my languidness too pervasive for my lips to form a proper ‘what’.  I sprawl over John, my body making contact with his at every point possible.
I must be patient.  Last time he left for 28 minutes and 23 seconds.  I can bear his absence that long, I am sure of it….I am not sure.
~~**~~
And think.
“Mr. Holmes?”
“Yes, we must,” I say. “No whinging.”
” The voice beseeched him sharper that time. John looked around and there he stood. Sherlock.
“Thou becomes quite an expert with thy sword and in Germany we be paid for soldiering; it will not be so easy to take my riches with us.  No one will know who we be and we would say we be brothers-”
he had viewed the information on the memory stick.  But he said he had not and lying was not his forte; she would have sensed his untruthfulness.  Besides, the prison would not let him post letters in his first week and, more significantly, there was no reason for him to send her a veiled threat.
John’s heart pounded in his chest as he watched the stillness of the face that was paler than humanly possible; a stillness that belonged to the man who had always been the very definition of ‘alive’.  Who had somehow become even more alive after the two long years he had been away; who was now living life in a full-spectrum that had previously been unknown to him.  To have come so far for nothing, not to be able to experience the world that was new to him in so many ways, was a tragedy.
“We’re not actually a couple.”
“I love you, too,” Sherlock said with an assuredness that could not be doubted.
“It be no difference to me.”  Counter to the thrill running through him that his plan be working so well, Sherlock assumed a disaffected air.  Twas difficult when John’s hair sparkled in the sunlight, his eyelashes be feathery and golden.  And his eyes…his eyes be as blue as the stormy sea, like the one Sherlock had seen in a painting at the manor.
“I did encourage you to come live here, yes.  I wanted what was best for
Toweling off, I look to see if I missed a text whilst I showered.  My heart sinks; I have not.
“It never stopped.” Sherlock took the bold step of enveloping John’s hand between both of his own. John
. Sherlock’s eyes blurred, but no tears fell, not until he read the rest of the engraving. For, following John’s birth date was a date that Sherlock would never be able to mistake: the day after they met.
He puts both hands on my face and with a tenderness that nearly causes me to become a puddle of flesh and melted bone, he kisses me and tells me, “I love you, too, Sherlock.  Everything I have, everything I am, is yours.”
be the smart one.” John tasted Sherlock’s lips again.  Sweet.  So, so, sweet.  “But why would thy father want to see thee dead?  If thou be kidnapped, as thou believes, he would want to bring thee back home.”
Ending his hushed conversation with a man who looked as if he had authority but apparently had none, Mycroft headed her way. No doubt to ask her the one question he had been asking her ad nauseam and to which he would get the same answer he had before—her answer would not, could not, change. It was No.
Kiss me!  Kiss me!
Sherlock held the box, feeling the weight of it. Not only the physical weight but the responsibility.
I do not like this; I do not like it at all.  And I tell John so.
Walking downstairs and into the night, Sherlock felt a peace that he had never before been able to call his own.
Dr. Juma whipped around and stared at Rose, struggling to maintain her composure. “Get it out of here!”
“Stupid!”  Sherlock rolled his eyes in frustration with himself.  “Why didn’t I ask him where he lives?”
cell coverage…  Yes, there’s a doctor in the village just in case the baby decides to make an early appearance…  Okay, I will.  Bye, I’ll call you when I get back.  Give my love to Sherlock.”
“Okay, what’s up? What are you doing?” John asked, glaring at Sherlock.
“—about the jacuzzi death that I don’t? Because, Sherlock, if you—"
Wasn't the Special FABULOUS!!!
Sherlock cocked an ear.
.  There has to be some other reason Cedric ran.”  The anguish on Aldus’s face made him look iller than when he had gone to lie down.
“Ocifer, this man,” I nod toward the dead body and my head spins.  This man…”
The chair scraped the floor, moving closer, and Sherlock felt the heat of John’s legs as they drew in to him, nearly touching his hips.
“This is your house? Why would—”
added it to the list,” I said, my eyes narrowing at him, unsure if I were correct, but knowing he would break under such pressure should I be.
I am exhausted from all the praise I give him.  I had best be careful; I do not want to give him a big head.
John knew what he needed to do.  He needed to cushion his heart the best he be able so that when Sherlock, whether by death or choice, no longer be with him, John would have the strength to carry on.  To live a life that, whilst not as happy as he enjoyed with Sherlock, would still have purpose.  Perhaps he should get serious about finding another wife as so many he knew suggested he do.  Yes, tis what he would do.  Once the joust be over, and Sherlock left to seek his family (If he be alive to do so), John would return to Cambridge and find a suitable wife.
"Get...your hands off...me...! Swine!"
Arse!
Nikolai Vetrov watched as a policeman half-led, half-dragged the girl down the hall to the interrogation room.  Even from where he sat in his office, he saw the blood on her clothes, the fresh bruises on her cheek, the hatred in her eyes.  Seeing the contempt for the officer radiating from her, Nikolai concerned himself little for her state of mind; killing an officer of the law was the most egregious crime one could commit and he held little sympathy for her indignation.  But his interest was piqued by the young woman despite the seriousness of her crime, or perhaps because of it.  Rarely did one see such an act of defiance and courage (for yes, it did take courage to murder a police officer in cold blood) in someone so young.
The man in the red suit, the tracks and sleigh bells, the footprints.  Could it be…could it be true?  Could there really be a Santa Claus?  No, there cannot be.  But what other explanation is there?
Meeting Sir John’s unflinching gaze, Sherlock saw something he wasn’t sure he had ever seen before.  And though he did not know what it was, he turned his back to Sir John, instinctively knowing he was putting himself in hands that would not hurt him.
“My eyes are up here, John,” I say drily.
me. No one’s ever loved me like that, Sherlock.  Like you see and know everything about me.
“John, I don’t know what the connection is between you and Simon, or James, for that matter. But you are safe.” Sherlock mustered the little energy he had left into convincing John of his certainty. “He will not get near you; he would be dead if he tried.”
tell me he misses me, loves me; he would want me to know I am important to him.  He would know it makes me feel good.
I sit just outside of camera range as John is prepped for his interview.  His makeup already applied, the crew adjusts the lighting and his microphone.  To have me in the studio is an unusual arrangement, one to which most media take mild exception, but from day one John has been adamant in his request: no Sherlock (Me!), no interview.  Non-negotiable.  I admit it is a request I find unusual as well.  We go nowhere without the other, but it is not as if I will be in another city or even another building; I will be in the next room.  When I asked about his requirement, John said it ultimately makes no difference to him whether the books sell well or not; it is not his intent to become rich or famous.  Neither is important to him.  What
Sherlock came to a dead stop in the middle of the pavement, the mobile’s screen the center of his universe as he waited for the words that would tell him how to fix John.
I remember thinking, after I kissed John that first time, that I had no more regrets, that I had realised my only unfilled dream.  But now a feeling washes over me that I do not understand…regret for the years I did not have an intimate relationship with this man who has become everything to me.
“A package? No, but I found an envelope halfway under your door, so I scooched it the rest of the way. Don’t want the wrong person to get ahold of it.”
Sherlock took in the eyes which could not see him. In the years since he had last laid eyes upon her, her blue in her eyes was no longer visible. Where they had before only been partially obscured by clouds, they now were completely white.
Pinching his bottom lip between his teeth as he thought, John’s gaze flitted from Cedric to Sherlock, and back again. “No, go without me. But do not drink late, a long day be ahead of us tomorrow. And mind Aldus, will you. His young body does not handle strong ale well. I have no wish to be woken in the middle of the night to his retching.”
A block out, he heard the brief rumble, and he lurched—
Sherlock cut a mental knife through his fog; he hadn’t the time to waste it on muddled thinking.
Fifteen minutes that feel like fifteen hours later, I struggle with my next words,   If he
“Don’t worry, I’ve got it.”
“Why do you think it worked?"
Simultaneously pulling his mobile from his pocket, powering it on and switching off its sound, John reached for the gun at his ankle; Derek hadn’t found that one.
I frowned at him.  Where did that question come from?  Not once have I doubted John’s love for me.  (Do not look at me like that.)
“What mean you, Sir John?” Aldus asked, his confusion apparent.  “Sherlock be in the stable.  We helped him carry Eduard downstairs and Sherlock be, well, settling him in. He said he would wait for us down there.”
“How about living here?  With me?  I know it seems sudden, but you stay here most nights anyway and I think it would be nice to have you here all the time.”
Simon glanced again at his hostage. John looked his way, alert to the conversation and no doubt anxious to seek help from the outside world. But that wasn’t how this was going to work.
I am not a person someone falls in love with.  I am a freak.  I am someone who makes children scream when they see me.  I am someone people, even John, call an idiot.
There it is.  Perhaps I should ask John to wash my bedding since I will be back in my old room tonight.  I will be kind and tell him he can wait until morning; there is no need to rush.
John is standing by the bed, pulling a trouser leg on.  My eyes shift back and forth between him and the bed, and back again.
Panicking, his eyes flew to Sherlock who stared back at him, just as stunned.
“Uhmm, Sherlock.”
But he has not.
I wait to strike, giving John time to calm down.  I spend the evening reading, researching articles on the internet, and playing my violin, never straying too far from him.
“Tis a death wish, Sherlock; capturing Cedric be not worth your life.  You have no training.  Not to mention, no one will believe thou be me; thou be a head taller than me.”
Nika really felt it wasn’t any of her business what was going on, and she couldn’t say she had a personal desire to know, but the man looked shaken, in need of emotional support. Especially after what he had said to the person on the other end of the line about Sherlock.
get to have sympathy pains! Just help me get to my bed, will you, love?”
John pulls a tissue from the box by the bed and gently pats my wet cheeks, cooing to both me and the baby.  Telling us he loves us.  Giving us each a kiss.
I sigh.
“Tea?” Appearing out of nowhere, Sherlock loomed over him, his face eager.
Briefly meeting Sherlock’s gaze in acknowledgment, Andi lifted the half-full pint to her lips, clearly uninterested in leaving any of its contents behind. And walking briskly out the door and down the empty street, Sherlock thought. Anything to cleanse his brain of James’s last moments.
comfortably for the rest of his life without the sacrifice of a day-to-day job.  All he was required to do was disable the electronic security system - doors, gates, and cameras - for a specific 15 minute timeframe.  That’s all.  Just 15 minutes of work in exchange for a lifetime of financial security.
“Sir, I will be happy for Sherlock to come with us.” Aldus spoke quietly from where he still stood at the hearth, his first words since his emotional outburst earlier.  “It will be good to have another set of eyes and ears. And with Eduard gone,” Aldus’ voice broke, but with a deep breath and several rapid blinks, he composed himself.  “With Eduard gone, I could teach him how to use a sword.  He is not as senseless as most servants; I think he would learn quickly.”
“He was.  By God, he was.  Even at three years old, when I last saw him, I knew Sherlock be something special.  A precocious boy, smarter than lads of nine or ten.  Almost as tall, too.  And the
For the first time Sherlock looked unsure of himself.  “I’d, I’d like to kiss you again if I may.”  The words coming from his mouth were both a statement and a question.
“Your other lovers.  Though, given your age and presumed diminished stamina, I may be overstating your ability to keep up with more than one.  One other than me, I mean.  So who is he?  Or perhaps I should say ‘she’?”
“A private jet!  Sherlock, the cost--”
He finished the project a week early, eagerly anticipating the day the system would go on line.  World renown would be within his grasp.
“Why, yes!  What an excellent way to start a marriage!  I knew there was
important thing: a man sat in John’s chair, the back of his perfectly shaped head covered in short grey hair the exact, perfect, shade of John’s. The man’s fingers thrummed impatiently on the arms of the chair, exactly as John’s perfect hands would do. And Sherlock heard one perfect voice rise above the din: “Sherlock? Where is he? I need to see him. At least give me my goddamn mobile back so I can call him.” Beneath the impatience was a hint of desperation that Sherlock had never before heard leave John.
“Dammit, Todd!”
And though Stamford winced under the assault, he remained steadfast. And silent. The crease that formed on his forehead plowing deeper.
It was thrilling and more than a bit scary the way the car raced through the streets of London. It was a pace Nika had never experienced in a city center unknown as a place anyone expected to move with expediency. But running late following their quest to relieve Spencer of his implanted chip, a police cruiser—siren and flashing light included—had been provided at Mycroft’s behest.
“And if I am not?”
Crouched behind the shrubbery, Sherlock watched the exchange with fascination.
It is well documented that I am able go days without talking.  Alternatively, I am able to speak so fast and for so long that peoples’ eyes glaze over, nearly rendering them comatose.  But never do I recall having the intense desire to speak and not being able to do so.
It enters my mouth, thick and strong. It is not intrusive; it feels as if it always belonged there.  I suck at it and it pulls back; I have to dart at it to catch it again.   And again.  And.  Again.
“Lube, John.  Lube.  Now,” Sherlock said, still sucking in air before he got any more lightheaded.
“Let me think. I was in the shops, Borough Market, in…September, I think it was. Didn’t recognize him; he had to tell me who he was. Anyway, said he’d been in a nasty car crash and had to have plastic surgery and that that was one of the first times he’d been out in public.”
Simon grunted. More like softcore foreplay given Sherlock’s soft moans as Dr. Watson massaged his shoulders, something that snippet of a girl, Andi, had suggested. Simon rolled his eyes.
Lying down, I rest my head on the pillow beside Sherlock and scroll up to the beginning of the texts and read.  The first time stamp is about an hour after he came into the bedroom.
Sherlock swallowed back the acid rising to the back of his mouth.
“You said that earlier, too, that John loves me,” he says to the congealed chicken parm. “How can you be so sure? How do I know you aren’t saying that because I’ve paid you to?”
“‘Half-cocked.’  I do nothing of the kind," Sherlock had snorted when he had recovered from the slight.  "I have created the per-” Seeing John’s unfavorable reaction he had bit himself off.  “We.  I mean
Grabbing his mobile, John dialed 999.  “Two men just jumped into the river and I think one might be unconscious,” he said somewhat breathlessly to the dispatcher, proceeding to describe what little he had seen.
John, feeling dazed, was having trouble absorbing all that had happened in the last few minutes.
“So when I found out, I couldn’t bring myself to tell you.  How could I tell you that I hadn’t talked to or seen my own mother in over 20 years?  That I hadn’t had any idea where she lived or if she was even alive?  I didn’t want you to know what kind of person I truly was; that I abandoned my own mum.  What kind of son does that?  It’s eaten at me for so long, Sherlock.  Sons are supposed to love their mothers and help take care of them when they get old.  I’m sixty-two fucking years old and sometimes I feel like I’m twelve, still rebelling against a mother who was too sick to know how badly she hurt other people.  I feel ashamed, Sherlock.  That’s why I didn’t tell you.”
Keeping his eyes on John, Sherlock took John’s hand in his and guided it to his own groin, where John could feel the erection that mirrored his.
Behind Sherlock, Colin and Aldus yammered about the joust, their voices rising in excitement.
Legs crossed and hands folded in his lap, Sherlock sat on a chair in the middle of the otherwise empty space. His appearance as crisp and clean as when he’d left the flat that morning, Sherlock looked to be the most unruffled hostage in London’s history, John thought.
The furrow in Mrs. Hudson’s brow smoothed, and a smile reclaimed her eyes, making his half-truths worth the trouble.
It is an immutable fact, as much a truth as the Earth goes round and round the sun.  I think how John would laugh at this bauble of information floating to the surface of my brain.  But he will not laugh, not ever again.  Never again will I hear the giggle which starts deep in his belly, spreading out until his whole body shakes with joy.
I sigh regretfully, I must not get caught.  With a force of self-control I have never known, I heartbreakingly tear myself away and put his shirt back where I found it.   Goodbye, dear back; I hope we meet again.
Taking a longing look at the water, without protest, Sherlock raised his arms so John could ease his shirt off.  Tossing the filthy garment into the corner, John loosed the belt of Sherlock’s breeches; as Sherlock stepped out of them he balanced himself by holding onto John’s shoulder.  Any other time Sherlock might have bristled at being helped to undress as if he were a child.  But, his defenses diminished by exhaustion, he instead felt a tightness in his chest, a deep well of love and gratitude for the man who had seen the very worst of him.  The man who had been
! Now do as I say, wench!” She mocked the words, her voice high and reedy. “I heard that too many times and
Looking back at John expectantly, he asked, “Now what?” entirely unsure of what was to come next.  Entirely unsure why John was looking at him with such intensity.  What was going on in that funny little brain? He wondered.
“No, I’m in a new flat on Baker St.  You haven’t seen it.”
“Go, John,” I urge.  “This may be the only birth of a grandchild you will witness; I do not want you to regret missing it.
His flannel shirt is soft against my cheek; it is comforting.  But not as much as the truth I hear in his voice, in his promise that he will never leave me alone, without him.  Not if he can help it.
“Did something traumatic happen recently that you know of?”  Even more gently John asked, “Do you have any reason to believe this was a suicide attempt?”
Was that the reason John had a strange hold over him, causing him to follow without protest?
John.  But he does not.). I wrap my arms around him, pulling him to me.  Almost as if against his will, his arms reach around me and hug me, one tight squeeze.  His head lays against me just long enough that I think perhaps he has changed his mind, that I will not be required to make a ‘decision’.  But I am wrong.
Sherlock reaches for my hand under the covers, kissing the platinum band he put on my finger as he finished his vows.  Looking up at me, he asks, “Why are you crying?”  A rather ridiculous question seeing as his own eyes are moist.
“Hello, John,” came the rich voice that reached down and settled deep in his soul.
At the sound of a taxi door slamming behind him, Sherlock spun around, the look in his eyes one of someone not quite comprehending what they were seeing. “What are
“Delirious?  I am perfectly well, John.  Is it not feasible I would be willing to help you without having lost my mental faculties? “
Silence greeted the man as he dispassionately tried to persuade her to consider the alternative. Walking slowly around where she sat handcuffed to the chair, he watched her, seeking even the slightest reaction.  It pleased him to see she had none, for the ability to control one’s emotions was one of the very qualities he was looking for.
Emerging from the loo, John and Sherlock rejoined Lestrade and his crew. Seeing Donovan staring at them, Sherlock gave her a withering glare as she obligingly looked away, a poorly disguised look of disgust on her face.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so alive.
“So, you didn’t you see a man?” Sherlock pressed. “Someone you haven’t seen before?”
Sherlock stared at his mobile, trying to comprehend what he read. The text clearly was not from Andi, and the screen displayed no caller name or number.
him.  Could it be?
be why he had had the nagging feeling he had seen him before.  How could he have been so blind?   Now he saw the resemblance.  Whilst Colin be not entirely similar to Sherlock, his height, his build, his full lips and keen eyes - his intellect – all be akin to Sherlock’s.  Twas no one else Colin could be.
Sherlock grew silent, a silence that stretched on to the point that John thought Sherlock had fallen asleep, but he had not.
I spy Katie across the room helping the bride keep her train out of harm’s way as they make their way to the bridal table.
“And finding my father,” Sherlock finished, abruptly launching himself down the road.  “Come, John.”
Sometimes, he was so overcome by emotion in his appreciation of all I did for him during this period that his reactions seemed more akin to anger than love, but I knew he was pleased.  (‘Sherlock!  You do
Cedric closed the door, his feet heavy on the floor as he trod to an empty bed, throwing himself onto it.
“Do not be ridiculous.”  Sherlock kissed him.
“Yes, it could.”
“I told you earlier the answer is ‘
Sherlock slowed and stopped.  John, relieved for a respite from the demands of keeping apace of him, did the same.
“Twas never any doubt.”
Mycroft nodded. “MOD’s chips collect the memories and transmit them, along with corresponding biodata, to experts who determine which memories should be destroyed and which should be kept.”
Swirl.
In the last two days I have had my first kiss, fallen in love, and become someone’s lover.  Not ‘someone’s’, but John’s.  No other person will do.
But no, his hand molds itself against my skin; it is at once gentle and firm.  The same as I have seen him do with Katie so many times over the years, only with her he would be watching her with a mixture of tenderness and wonder.  I cannot imagine what is on his face right now.  I am not sure I want to know.
I look around as if there might be someone else in the room.  Seeing no one, I look back at him and ask, “Who?  Me?”
“Good evening, Nika. Sorry to disturb,” Mr. Holmes said, affecting a smooth tone of reassurance. Nika was not reassured.
And pulled the trigger.
“Sherlock be an extraordinary man, Laila; his intellect will help him find his way.  If I may say, despite having been separated from you at such a young age, I have no doubt he owes a great deal of his intellect and sensibilities to you.”
Envisioning Mycroft huffing in indignation, Andi chuckled; he really was too serious for his own good. But then, look at where it had gotten him. If she wanted to elevate her position, it would do her well to emulate that gravity. And pomposity. And—
“What? I do not hear anything unusual.  You are probably going to blame that on Sherlock, too.”
Laila’s hands, resting on her lap, worried at her skirt.  “Yes, Sherlock, you be my son.”
A restless night it had been.
On the table, Simon’s mobile beckoned Sherlock.
“Where did you get the idea I tried to kill you?  Been reading your old case notes again?  It always puts you a bit off, thinking everyone is out to murder someone.  You just slept well because you got shagged.  It’s not uncommon, you know.”
Thank you for joining me, I hope you enjoyed it :-D
Sherlock mentally shook himself and moved on, trying not to read too much into that piece of information.  After all, it wasn’t uncommon for close friends to name their children after one another.
Sherlock’s tea grew cold; he would sit and wait as long as he needed to until John was ready to talk.
“Since I have no great urge to do so, it is of no great import to me whether we do or not.  But I am well aware that since the desire to engage in sex is a primary indicator of whether or not someone loves another, I have been disappointed that you have not at least suggested it.”
“Yes?”  His hand clasped hers a little harder, his apprehension palpable.
The detective drove straight to the hospital.
for you to think.”
. It was not unpleasant.
“There was never anyone I wanted to kiss.  Well, apart from you.  Thank you, John.”
The rest of the evening he is quiet, watching telly, a beer in his hand that he rarely brings to his mouth.  I do not think he dislikes the beer, I think he is thinking.  Thinking about what, I have no wish to know.  At 11 o’clock, I watch him go to bed without saying a word, without taking my hand.  Without folding his fingers with mine and telling me that nothing brings him more happiness than to be with me.
Kneading, pressing, massaging, John didn’t stay in one spot too long, after all, the point was not for Sherlock to fall asleep.
“Yes, that thou has been, and a skilled one, as well, but it will wait until morn. If you are to leave, you need a good night’s rest.  And we need to gather provisions for you, bundle clean clothing for thee to take.  I will not send thee off ill-prepared.”
“Yeah, you. God help me. And when I saw your text I thought…”
Sherlock turned to John, his eyes unreadable.
Throw!  I need the throw.  I hurry to John’s chair, which has never been out of my sight since I moved the table.  I am not cold, but John’s throw will comfort me until I can get over my disease.  Before I wrap it over my shoulders, I lift it to my nostrils and breathe deeply.  It smells just like John, just like soap and after shave and a little hint of the cologne he wore when we went to the play last week.  I put it on.  It is warm.  Like john.
A sniffle escapes me and I rub the sheet corner across the bottom of my nose.  “There’s dust in the air tonight; it has been abnormally dry this month…”
. Sherlock answered anyway, talking through the smile that he couldn’t seem to suppress. “Yesterday? Day before? Is that what you wanted to talk about, my eating and sleeping habits?”
I am exonerated.
Mr. Holmes crossed his legs, a sly smile crossing his face. “I
Sherlock grew restless under John’s search. At what did he look? Sherlock wondered. And why did he take so long?
“Oh, Sir John, do not be so modest.  Tis you who has given him a stability he has never known.  And from what I understand, you be the first one he has allowed himself to love.”
“These be my parents, my mother’s engagement ring and the one my father wore after they married.  Twas one reason I came to thee so late tonight; she said she wants me to have them.  For when I find the person I cannot live without.”
I have already lost him.  It is very kind of him to try, though; most people do not get that far.
“Shut the door!” Sherlock shouted over the wind. It would be impossible to go anywhere right then. Or anytime soon.
“But I let the accident happen; therefore I share blame for the repercussions,” Sherlock had countered, firm in his belief he was correct.
Think of poor John.  He has been in love with me for 25 years.  How has he done it?  No wonder his brain capacity has always been so diminished, his synapses have been occupied with being in love with me, eroding through the years from lack of productive use.  Though if I may say, there are far less worthy causes for being an idiot.
Dr. Watson nods a rather tight nod and sits down in the chair opposite me. “It’s all right, I guess. If you go in for that sort of thing.”
I am not moving, but I freeze anyway.  Maybe he is talking in his sleep, though I have never known him to do so.  I say nothing, hoping if I do not I will not wake him.
The paper rustles as if folded in a hurry and without any warning the shower curtain whips aside as John says, “Who are you calling Smirky B….”.
And many thanks to Thorntonsheart for allowing me to pick her Brit brain.  You would also be depriving yourself if you don't go read her work, luscious!
A hand rested on John’s shoulder, a hand attached to a pretty young woman with long brunette hair.
I cannot speak.  I am spellbound by the effect his body has on me.
“I brought you some suitable clothes in case you want to reconsider the suit; they’re hanging in the closet.”
You know?!  Why did you not tell me?  Why did you not shoo me away and tell me never to touch you there again?
“Be you well? Were you hurt?” Though John directed his questions at both squires, only Cedric answered.
“And just what kind of business can that be, here, in a prison?”
slept, and besides, your bed be much more comfortable.
Alight with excitement, Sherlock’s interest was dashed in the next moment when he read that this James Alderman had not only been male but had died in 1929. Several search pages in, he found banker James Alderman. The ordinary one. Alderman had been a back office lender who negotiated legal documents, according to her bank’s website. (How Sherlock loathed the current predilection of adding personal information on a professional website—“James enjoys spending her Saturdays hunting bargains at open air markets.” Blah, blah, blah.)
“Sir John may call me anything he wishes,” Sherlock retorted unkindly, moving the flame so he could see John’s face.  His breath left him. Twas one thing to feel the wound and know John be injured, twas a devastating other to see John’s face, white and still.  His eyes closed, his mouth slack.  The mouth that so little time ago had kissed him, had told him he loved him.
I lie down and put my head on his chest; he makes room for my knees as I draw them up against him.  His hand rests on my head and his fingers weave through my hair, over and over and over.
I hear the incessant tapping as I leave, and, forty-five minutes later, instead of rejoining John, I return to our cabin.
“Here you go,” the server said, plunking the pint and chips onto the table.
“Sherlock,” he sighed as the lips that be so provocative drifted up to his ear and murmured his name.
playing a game when you call me an idiot?  Whether it’s an endearment or your way of telling me you love me?”
“Yes, I am here.  Just taking a break; I will leave to let you go back to sleep.”
John flinched. This was exactly what he’d hoped to avoid, Sherlock blaming himself. “What? No, Sherlock. Christ, no. It wasn’t anything you did.”
Andi immediately texted back.
John still had not gotten a response.  “Inspector?”
“Stupid,” Sherlock finished for him.  “Thou has so little faith, John.  Will this do?”
“With a passport and citizenship.” Even from several feet away, Nika heard air escape Mr. Holmes’s nostrils; he was losing his patience.
Where is that oxygen?  Perhaps we will need it for him, too.
“Excuse me,” Sherlock said to the young woman as she glared at him, obviously wondering what this man was about as he interrupted their dance.
I change into a linen shirt with coordinating slacks and a pair of espadrilles and come back downstairs.  How anyone can wear such an outfit and not feel as if they are parading around naked, I have little idea; the only thing keeping me from changing back into my suit is the knowledge that it
He checked his gun, a rushed stream of epithets tripping off his tongue as he swore at the
day.  Mycroft laughed.  50 years later and I am still on the Gallery’s ‘watch’ list.  Hmphh.)
“Not good enough.” Sherlock leaned down, closing the gap between their faces. “I can go room to room, disrupting the entire—”
For the most part, the week had been an interesting diversion; it was always mildly amusing to bend someone against their will. It had started off promising—John getting hit by the cab, the puzzles, one suicide and one attempt. But beyond that, what a disappointment it’d all been. How he had been hoping that he’d finally met his match in Sherlock—those with phenomenal intellect (
“Do not interrupt me!  I went to the kitchen and struggling to put it over my head… you have a small head, John!  Something dropped to the floor and realising I had knocked over a small beaker of acid that was sat on the table, I panicked.  I did not want to anger you by burning a hole in the floor so I used what I had in my hand.”  I swallow preparing to tell him the worst of it.  “Your jumper then had a hole, a second hole, big enough for my head.”
Andi’s mouth bobbed, but no sound came out.
She is clearly stunned.  I cannot blame her; I vividly recall my own reaction, ‘O.O’, when
“We’re not staying. We have business to which we need to attend.  I will notify you when I am ready to release myself into custody and I would consider it a great favor if you will handle the transfer, keep the newspapers at a distance.”
When he reached the landing, Sherlock dabbed his finger in a trace of the oil he had spotted on his way up, sniffing the substance as he rubbed it between finger and thumb. It had been tracked up by average-sized footwear (male, size 9, somewhat above average body density given the pressure on the treads—the intruder at the Belgravia home?)
Swifter than John had ever before seen Sherlock move, and that be swift, Sherlock snaked his arm around John’s middle and pinned him to the bed.
I tilt my head to kiss his chin, then reaching up further I put my mouth on his.   I love you John, I love you I love you I Iove you.
When Sherlock and I step into the flat, Dr. Watson eyes me warily, his lips a thin line—their default setting, it seems— and I paste a practiced smile onto my face, resisting the almost unresistable urge to snatch Sherlock’s hand and whisk him away to an exotic hideaway. Save him from this surly little man and show him what
Taking out his pocket knife, he scraped a small amount of gummy material off the sill, careful to keep his coat from touching the offending substance.  “Duct tape residue, where she taped the tube to the window.  I presume somewhere in the house is a piece of fabric or cardboard with this residue on it.  She would have had to cover the rest of the open window with some kind of barrier to keep the fresh air from blowing in, which would have defeated her purpose.”
Sherlock opened the palm of his hand.  “Mobile.”
“Stay, Sir John.  You can talk to whomever, or whatever, this be.”  Sherlock glowered at Cedric as he walked past him.  “See what it is he be doing here.”
“But we’ll be practically next door, Sherlock; it’s not like we have to make a special trip.  You’ll have your roses winterised and I know for a fact that you’ll not be in the middle of any experiments.”
When his mouth meets my back, this time I am ready, open to wherever it takes me.  His hands still secure on my hips, his thumbs stroke me.  His lips and tongue move on me, circling, laving, pressing.  My nerve endings teem with pleasure; I feel each one trying to burst forth from me, their ecstasy too great to willingly be constrained by my flesh.
Almost absent-mindedly, he answers me, lifting a hand to ruffle it through his hair.  “Katie?  Yeh, Katie’s fine.”
“If I may sound like a doctor here, forgetting little things is absolutely natural as you age.  I forget things all the time…and before you say anything, I know, I’m ordinary to start with, but it’s never anything important and it doesn’t disrupt my life.  I know you’ll find this hard to believe, but you
“No, John, nothing else comes to mind.”
Taking a couple of deep breaths to re-oxygenate himself, John shakes his head as if trying to release himself from a daze.
, to rest his hand on John’s leg.  He needed to comfort himself with a physical connection.  Needed to reassure his friend he wasn’t alone.  But he couldn’t bring himself to do it; it was not his right.  Instead, he placed his hand on the console between them, settling with being a little bit closer to the man he could not imagine living without ever again.
And was not.  And he would swear upon the grave of his child that Sherlock was not a murderer.  No, twas no possibility.  None.
As if being barred from kissing him will make me want him more.  What a ridiculous notion.  I have strength of self-control he has never encountered the likes of.  I will show
Waiting to make sure Mary’s room was emptied of staff, Sherlock walked in, finding the courtesy of a greeting unnecessary.
His name called as the next to compete, John leapt into action; twas time to hobble his horse.  They could not risk Sherlock being obligated to joust.  Thrusting his hand into the pocket deep in the folds of his cloak, John withdrew a slim blade, and giving Jocelyn’s rump an apologetic stroke, he whispered to her, “Forgive me, Jocelyn.”  As he crouched down at her hoof, she stretched her neck to look back at him with mild curiosity, and before she had time to draw her leg away, he dug the knife into the hide above her coronet, scoring a long gash. She squealed in protest, jerking her leg up, but she did not kick him.  Not giving himself time to regret his betrayal of the loyal and hard-working horse, he unwound the cloth he had hidden in his other pocket and wrapped it around her wound.
those words, let alone possessed the ability to articulate them.  And not only did Sherlock say the words, but they were said in a tone that John had never thought Sherlock could even imitate.  They actually sounded…

Sir John and Cedric lifted Sherlock to unsteady feet, wrestling him upward while Aldus pulled Sherlock up from where he sat on his horse. As they lifted him, Sir John grimaced at the sight of Sherlock's back, long streaks of blood stained the robe.
“Come now,” Sherlock said. “Video chat. We can talk on the way.”
“Hi, love… Fine, fine, of
“I be happy.”
“No, John,” I say softly.  “It had to be someone dressed up to look like him. A burglar.”
“Sherlock, I–”
felt normal. “All yours, John.”
“Tis no more than a flesh wound, Cedric.  Aldus, take these and dress Cedric’s wound, if that be what the scratch be called,” Sherlock said with disdain.  “And then the both of you
With no hesitation the mugger ran down the steps to the promenade beneath the bridge.  Seeing Sherlock gaining ground on him and knowing it was mere moments before the detective reached him, he panicked and jumped the rail, landing in the water with a loud splash.
“Sherlock, tis too dangerous!”
’ face; it really is so very endearing.
My smile fades fast; I almost feel as if I am on trial.  Don’t be silly Watson, you’ve done nothing wrong.
Twenty minutes later Sherlock’s mattress lay on the floor in the living room.  A mound of blankets and duvets covered them as they lay on opposite sides of the bed, hugging the edges in their care not to touch each other, the fire crackling soothingly in their ears as they fell asleep.
John's voice is soothing; he sounds like he does when he shushes a crying  baby.  My Little Soldier.  He can shoot people
In the flat, voices barked commands that Sherlock willed into a jumble of unintelligible sounds. He had no desire to understand what was being said. No desire to have a distinct memory of those last moments of John’s being. John was dead, and that wasn’t how Sherlock wanted to remember him.
Turning to Sherlock, Sir John said, “You may go, but it be best you remain with us, at least through the night.  We will protect you lest those heathens return to finish their plan.  And you need medicine for your wounds.  But it is your choice to go or stay; you are a free man.”
didn’t think I should be told I became a father?! You bloody wanker.  I am
Leaving me standing here.  Alone.
agreeing with what he said…” he stops to plant a kiss on my lips.  And another.  And another.  Each successive kiss growing longer, more tender, more loving.
“He what, Sherlock?”  John asked, unheedful of Cedric’s interruption.
How can I regret something I never desired?  How can I miss something I never had?  Heaviness fills my heart as I regret that all these years I could have loved, and been loved by, John, yet these things did not happen.  I could have known the feel of his skin against mine, the warmth of his lips, the beat of his heart, the sweet sounds of ‘love’ and ‘honey’ and ‘sweetheart’ resonating through me.  I could have been with the person who accepts and loves me as no other has, who sees all the things in me that repels others, and yet still loves me.
I roll over and clump the covers into my arms.  If Sherlock isn’t here to hug, this will have to do for now.
“The relevance goes to your motive, Sherlock. You clearly care a great deal about Dr. Watson and want to see him happy; you wouldn’t be here, otherwise. But the question is, do you want what’s best for him or what’s best for you?”
Nicer yet, the hand caught between their two bodies stroked his crotch.  Getting hard, the pressure against his jeans eased as the zipper moved down; a finger slipped into the breach, his pants the only barrier to his cock.  Nice.  Very nice.  A small moan of pleasure escaped as he pushed his hips into the finger, encouraging more fingers to join it.
And as Sherlock pondered this most puzzling of enigmas, Stamford said, “Don’t you want to know?”
“If I told you ‘nothing’, would you believe me?”   I do not want to tell him I am sad.  I do not want to tell him I long for things that never were.  That I grieve for the 25 years we could have had together but did not.  I do not want to tell him I have become… ‘sentimental’.
From the bed, Katie’s eyes immediately search me out as we enter the room, “Come Pére, come see little John.”  John groans under his breath, keeping it low so Katie will not hear him.  “Little John”…so many unsavory memories of bloodied noses in the schoolyard.  Some his, but more for those who taunted him.  My husband’s hand clutched in mine, I give it a light squeeze -
“Truly?  Thou chooses
John.
“You’re more than capable of taking over from here," he said, "but I would check Mrs. Higgins’ hands for tape residue or oil; it’s not easy to remove gum residue without using oil, most likely olive or canola.  That will help give you evidence you need to help prove she is her husband’s murderer.”
your bloody housekeeper, you know!  I don’t know what you did before I came along.  And you could help once in a while, you…”
“John?”
?  I don’t think the registrar’s office is open.”
“Oh! Hello, Dr. Watson! I’m so sorry. I thought you’d be sleeping.” She started backing away. “I’ll leave you—"
.  Are you sure it you want to take this on?”  It is not a question I want to ask; I do not know what I will do if he says ‘no’.  But more and more lately I find that I have unexpected spurts of…consideration.  Increasingly, John’s happiness is becoming important to me.
“You’ve got this. I trust you.” And Sherlock nodded, one sharp tip of his head.
going to sell my ‘services’.  Even if I were young and attractive…”
“But it is not all about me,” I protest.
John’.
He was getting bored.
“John.”
With as much certainty as he now knew he loved and was in love with John, Sherlock also knew it was not a recent development.  It sat on his heart from the beginning, waiting to be revealed.
.  Suddenly you were right there in front of me, and I knew.  I knew it was you all along.
“Laila, why be you here?”  Astonished to see her, Sherlock brushed Colin aside.
As the black cab whisked them through the ether, Sherlock braced himself for what he might see at their next destination. The likelihood that his presence had improved John’s life in any meaningful way was slim, but it would be prudent to prepare himself for the worst.
I look at the pain etched on his face, saddened he has had to carry this weight so long.  Alone.  Saddened to know he has so little faith in me to think that I would judge him harshly.
“Mother?”  His voice became urgent, her unwillingness to answer concerning him.  He clasped her hand, careful not squeeze it hard enough to hurt her.
Now breathe.  If need be I can kiss you to calm you down.”  Even if I could not see him I would hear him smiling.
I bask in my brilliance, my smile hidden by the tilt of my head.  I wait… I wait…
“Sir John gives his apologies.  His voice has left him; too much celebration last night, if you know what I mean,” John added with a forced laugh.  “Sir John understands the implications and is fully prepared to relinquish his position.”
Hi ho, hi ho, off to California and Vegas I go!
“Sherlock, I be serious.” John groaned at the onslaught, against his will his head lolling back.
“Aldus, we be leaving.”  Colin’s words clipped, he hurried over to Aldus.  Pulling out a clean blouse for Aldus, he started dressing him.  “Here, put on something fresh.  I think you be well enough now to go to the blacksmith with me.  You can sit and watch whilst I work.”
“The pirate,” I hiccup, “has been murdered and…”
“Do not leave me.” I hear a funny sound in my voice and wonder what it is.
John’s lips twitched, trying to hide his smile.  “Aldus, when Sherlock be done dressing Eduard, apply the salve to Sherlock’s wounds; tis in the mazer on the table.”
Alternately googling on his mobile and staring sightless at the wall while he processed in his head the data he had found, Sherlock suddenly became aware that it had gotten quiet.  That there were now 17 pairs of eyes looking his way.  16 pairs of eyes that ranged from curious to apathetic to impatient.  And one pair of amiable eyes that looked at him with no expectation, no sense of urgency, just kind invitation. John Watson’s.
But this night he felt a measure of comfort, due almost entirely to the man who shared his cell.  It had been almost three years since they had shared the flat at 221b.  When they had, they had never shared the same room, yet somehow it seemed perfectly natural to hear that melodically deep voice just a few feet away from him.
Unable to speak, I nod for him to continue.
“Bollocks!  You really want to know?”  He huffed, turning so he could look at Sherlock, glaring at him accusatorially for forcing him to say what he had had no intention of saying.
Sherlock and Colin pried the lid off of the crate.  One by one Colin withdrew pieces of the suit, placing them on Sherlock, measuring, taking notes.  Staring at a cuirass or cuisse, and puzzling over how to adjust it to protect Sherlock.  Intent on his task, Colin spoke little save for the occasional question: “How does this feel, Sherlock?” - “Does this pinch you?” - “Can you breathe?”
He nodded, appearing relieved with my answer.  “Well…I don’t want to hurt your feelings or make you feel as if I’m not totally appreciative of everything you do…
No, Sherlock could take no part in that.  He could not bear to see John suffer any more than he already had.
"My predi..." Aldus started to spit out, but stopped himself as Sir John approached. He had no desire to explain their conversation. The last time he had been in trouble with the Knight his "correction" had been to chop two tall trees into kindling. The act left blisters on his hands, and arms too sore to lift for a many days. Most upsetting, his arms and hands had been useless to pleasure himself. No, he did not want to suffer such agony again.
“But Sir John says we be safe in his presence.” Aldus craned his neck around to look at Sherlock, refreshing his memory.  “He does not
Staring at Sherlock’s sharp profile, the mass of black hair, the upturned coat collar, Mycroft’s words to Sherlock echoed in his head, ‘the man you are in love with’.   So concerned had he been with protecting Sherlock’s pride in the face of the apparently unwelcome admission, John had pushed aside all other reactions but his surprise.  Little could be more surprising than the notoriously anti-social detective having emotional attachment to
“Thou
That’s what Sherlock did, used people against themselves. John didn’t want to see the beautiful face, that had so recently been etched with what looked like real emotion, revert to the façade of someone who took painstaking care to pretend nothing mattered.
Like John with Sherlock, my beta Burning_Up_A_Sun is kind and nurturing and patient, far more so than I deserve.  Not to mention an amazing writer!  (MUCH better than John!)  Thank you, Sweetie.
“Where is this coming from, Sherlock?  Huh?   Why are you so
Eventually he extends the cover to include me.  He is still awake, keeping his promise to save me in the event I start to expire.
“Of course, John; Take all the time you need. I—I’ll be home within the half-hour.” He waited to see what John would say next, a stark solitude enveloping him when John unexpectedly ended the chat.
She felt trapped.
“And I didn’t just marry you for your brain,” I smirk as my hand takes claim of his cock.
Relieved, Andi punched in a response.
I stumble over to the pirate, swiping clumsy fingers through the small stream of dark red fluid flowing down his neck.  I touch a finger to my tongue.  Blood.
“I signed up for two years,” he replied, for the first time feeling the heavy weight of remaining abroad for another year.  It might as well have been a lifetime.
have you killed.”
When he came back.
“I give,” John had murmured against his skin.
“It feels like our home.  The castle would be fine, but we both think tis an austerity to it that does not suit us.  I mean no offence.”
“But, John—”
Glowering, Merek leaned in toward Sherlock, his shoulders hunched in threat.  “She tripped and fell, arse.”
“Have you gone daft?!”  John wants to be stern, but unable to help himself, he joins me in my laughter and before we know it, we are both giggling until we cannot breathe.
Sherlock listened to Colin, watching him think it through.  “You say ‘I believe I can,’ ‘I think I can.’  Can you or can you not? ‘ If’ and ‘maybe’ be insufficient.”
I mouth.
“I won’t forget, love.”  John reaches in for a kiss, our mouths touching lightly.
John’s mind raced.  Sherlock said he was certain Moriarty died that night.  Had he been wrong?  And when did Sherlock borrow his mobile? John reached into his other pocket and a chill ran through him.  Pulling out an identical mobile, it came back to him that he had picked it up off the bed, thinking it was his own.  Dear Christ.  Now he remembered.  Sherlock received a text but when John asked who it came from, Sherlock said ‘no one’.  John had thought Sherlock preoccupied when he replied, but attributed it to the tumultuousness of the day.
And my last conscious thought before I go to sleep?
As closely as he could from where he stood, Sherlock looked at the face on the gurney.
“So then, what is it Sherlock?  Why do you have trouble settling in with me?  With us?”  There is no judgment in his tone.  He truly wants to know and is willing to let me explain myself in the fashion I need to do it.
“Where is John?” Mary asked.
Perhaps Sherlock be wrong, and Cedric had left London. Twas not groundless to consider that, to save his skin, Cedric had left behind everything and everyone he knew.  But John could not help but think Sherlock be right.  That as distasteful the thought of Cedric being in love with him be, be it true, Cedric would want to see John.  And where better to hide than in plain sight?
Nothing and no one other than Sherlock.
The camera, sat on a tripod, captures us walking to the makeshift altar, releasing Katie from where she hooked our arms in hers to go sit down.
I see dust rise up over the slope of the hill before I see the car.  Relief.  John is home.
.  He knew there would be times the mere knowledge of John’s existence would be the only thing to keep him alive.
“Do you fantasize?”  John’s curiosity is piqued, as if sat at the local pub waiting to hear recent gossip.
“You need to leave, John.  Now.  That’s
She is not going to allow herself to be distracted.
“Yes, I
Was John mocking him?  It was so hard to tell in an email.
“Then why did thee not tell the sheriff with whom thou had sexual relations?”
“Don’t be boring.  Out with it.”
Sherlock suppressed an anticipatory smile; he wouldn’t want to be too obvious.
Yes, twas hard, so hard.
“Godspeed,” Sir John said, unsure if he imagined the flicker he saw in Sherlock’s eyes.
“Yes, John.”
“Do you think it’s a good idea for me to do this to Mark?”  Two fingers touch me mid-thigh; I shiver as they press against me, making contact with my skin through the light fabric of my trousers. Trailing up my crotch, as he outlines my scrotum.  My awakening penis. Until he reaches my zipper tab.
Sherlock unfolded his legs and set his laptop aside, rising.
Sherlock flicked his now stubbled cigarette to the ground. “Would you get to the point? I haven’t time for the complete history of MOD in the modern world. Not to mention, it’s boring.” For perhaps the fifth time in the few minutes they’d been outside, Sherlock checked his mobile. Andi had promised (“pinkie swear!”) to text him when John awakened.
Taking the precaution of pulling his gun out, he took the safety off before he opened the door, a creek emanating from it as if it thought it was a movie extra.  Walking into the foyer, he quickly scanned the area, his gun drawn, finger on the trigger. The place appeared to be empty and as hard as he listened, he didn’t hear any telltale signs of even one occupant.
“Sherlock’s with Simon.”
“Sherlock?  Who.  The HELL.  Is
John searches the suite for some other “lost” item.  I imagine it is his dress shirt.  Or his slacks.  Neither of which he has yet put on, and we are set to leave in minutes. He

“I love you,” I tell him, lowering my mouth to that which is eager for mine, the one telling me that I too am loved beyond measure.   And as we kiss, our lips, our tongues, our sighs, reaffirming the deep love we have for each other, I know that whether or not there is a Santa, this,
John, his hands clasped behind his back, rocked on his heels. Sherlock noted a twinkle in his eyes; twas as if John be about to burst with a happy secret.
“Tis not the first time this week, is it.”  John thought back to the other times he had seen Aldus shaky and pale, putting it down to the blow he had suffered at Eduard’s death.
In between pecks just above my waistband, my lover asks, “You’re…”, kiss, “thinking about…,” nip, “our wedding?”  Suck.
“He?”
“What
“I wouldn’t mind if we do that again sometime.  But you can’t stop breathing,” he says, pointing at me sternly.  “My CPR is rusty.”
The other one was her.
? It wouldn’t be unreasonable for the murderer to have taken his weapon with him.
“I am trying to remember what thee said.  That I be hit on the head, and stabbed?  You say you be unharmed, but Cedric and Aldus?”
But he does not.
“So pleased to meet you, Mr. Watson.”
Again I utter the one phrase I will not say to anyone but John.  “I do not know.”
In an attempt to distract Sherlock, John asked, “What do you think we’ll find at Mary’s flat?  What are you looking for?”
The address John gave me, while not in a posh neighborhood, is clean and well-maintained.  I climb three flights of stairs, find the number of the flat, and knock on the door.  Katie opens it, and barely taking time to open it all the way, throws her arms around me.
As happy as I have been, I do not know why I expected our marriage to be significantly smoother than our friendship, at least in the early years.  After all, our 25 years of friendship before we married were frequently punctuated with raised voices (Mostly from John.  No, always from John.), bickering, and bouts of silence (Mostly by me.  Mmmm, no.  Always by me.).  In fact, there have been moments where I feared we might not make it.  Even now my heart clenches at the mere idea; the thought of losing John is beyond all comprehension.
Laila washed herself with fresh water Colin had brought her that evening, humming as she went through her weekly ablutions.  Twas a tune she had loved for many a year, one that had been played to her and her family by fine musicians in a fine home.  The home she did not miss; the family she did.  Most of all she missed her elder son with an ache that was always with her.  Twas not natural for a mother to be separated from her own flesh and blood.  Twas not natural that a son would not know who is mother be.  But at that moment she almost felt restored.  As if everything in the world were perfect.  She pushed to the back of her mind that her peace would end soon; she knew well enough from experience it would.  But for now she would pretend that everything was as it should be.
Draping his coat over the back of the chair, Sherlock sank into the seat, his laptop balanced on his knees. Opening his email, he reviewed what he had sent himself from Mycroft’s account, trying to pinpoint what paths he still needed to go down in his pursuit of Simon. In the last few hours, he had searched MOD and Scotland Yard databases for anyone with Simon in any part of their name—staff, soldiers, perpetrators, contractors. The list was surprisingly long, and as 7 a.m. neared, Sherlock had set the search aside, thinking he needed to approach it from a different angle.
Cpt. John H. Watson.
He folds the covers over him when he lies down; the smile disappears.
“Yes, I know this, John.”
“Something I said, then. I know my filter—"
“Top secret,” Sherlock said, weary beyond what he thought he could bear. Hoping that being evasive would buy him back his solitude. “Don’t tell…” Rhoedes was his name. “Don’t tell, Rhoedes.”
He clears his throat and checks for his wallet, still avoiding my eyes.
“What?” Sherlock turned at hearing John's voice.
“Sherlock!!”
“We’ve not yet determined the identity of the subject,” Andi said, pulling herself back to Dr. Juma. Whatever was causing the ruckus could wait. “Dr. Strummer went to unusual lengths to conceal the identity of Operation Eclipse’s Person #1. I did, after extensive efforts, recover this photo. We’ve run it through every database to find a match, from Scotland Yard to local constabularies to the three military organizations and the DVLA, but we’ve come up empty handed. It’s almost as if he never existed.”
I think again.  This seems important to John.  I think hard.  No, nothing.
“No, twas too dark.  But I think he dropped something.”  Cedric glanced around for the unknown object.  “Ha!  Here it is!”  Bending down, he picked up a knife, taking it to the light to better see it.  “Tis Eduard’s, Sherlock; tis Eduard’s knife!”
John pulled Sherlock’s face closer to him, certain he could never be close enough.  The tip of his tongue teased Sherlock’s lips open further until he could reach inside, inside to the sanctity of the man that he knew in one way or another would someday be the death of him.
I go back to mixing the pesticide concentrate.
As it turns out, surprisingly so.
Picking up her mobile, it rang before she started making her call.
Nothing about paracetamol, nothing about being ill.
Though John’s back has nearly returned to normal, I have just finished giving him another backrub (a ritual I hope we practice for many years to come) and we are sitting at the breakfast table.  I with my laptop, and John with the morning paper.
“Yeah,” John said reflexively. But even to his own ears, he sounded tentative.
Sherlock be not deterred by the blacksmith’s reserve.  “What alehouse does he frequent when he be here in the city?  Tailor?  Bootsmith? Chur-”
The camera followed the intruder as he walked from the gate, across the walled‑in courtyard, to the sliding door. It was difficult to tell exactly what he was doing, but it appeared he had pulled a piece of metal from his pocket and jimmied the door open.
“Please.  I will not hurt you,” Sir John said softly.
“Might,” Aldus declared proudly, squeezing his curled bicep. “It be called
After Colin had eaten, they spent the afternoon visiting merchants, selecting materials.  Sherlock, haggling for lower prices, calling the inflexible sellers ‘thief,’ ‘dolt,’ and ‘the soft underbelly of a sow.’  (“Sherlock, you be not helping.”)  Neither speaking of anything but preparations for the joust.  When they returned to the inn, Sherlock bolted into their room.  A quick glance around gave no indication John had been there.
“In a moment? There be something that has been nagging at me, and I respect your privacy, I do, but…”
Phillip Anderson was heavily disguised as he arrived at the Visitor’s Centre in preparation for his ‘visit’ with Sherlock.  Thank god the staff had not been overly zealous in their pat down; he wasn’t entirely sure how well his fake belly would adhere to him if there were wandering fingers around.  The authentic identification he pulled from his wallet bore the name Fredric Von Heinburg.
Leaving the house, Sherlock had modulated his voice, of course. His disguise had been meticulous.
With an exasperated sigh, John ascended the stairs.  The massive dick always got his way.
Though they did not have the same fathers, Colin be so very much like his half-brother Sherlock, observant and quick-witted.
Leaning down into John’s face, “Your word?  Your
to Mycroft’s!  I don’t care if that’s not what you want; he’ll keep your sorry arse from freezing to death!”
Sir John gripped the handle with one hand, the fingers of the other inching along the thong.  Blood and minute chunks of flesh collected on his fingertips, and seeming to have found what he looked for, with a crisp flick of his wrist he snapped the weapon at Merek, hitting his bare foot.
Eyeing him warily, my gaze shifts, surveying our bedroom.  Nothing appears different from the night before, but something distinctly odd has occurred.  John has arisen… before me.
His mouth leaves mine and he scorches a trail down my neck, pausing to suckle at its crook.  My hips push into him, but he takes no notice.  The mouth that lights a fire in me travels further down, burning a new path down my chest.  Kissing one nipple and moving down, his lips press hard against me, as if he did not, he would not be able to feel me, to taste me.  One hand is on my chest to brace himself, the other glides down my back in tandem with his mouth on the front of me.  He has nudged my knee out of the way to give himself room to move, room to keep moving down my body.
“I said—”
(See the end of the chapter for
I hold him a little tighter.  “If you put it that way, then I have.  And," I pause.  It is the kind of promise I have never made to anyone.  "...I will continue to do so.”
"That was a brilliant idea!”
on lying to him to spare him even more unpleasantness.  But for once, Sherlock wearied of his deceptions.  He knew John’s threshold for lies tipped with Mary’s deceit, and he didn’t want to lose John because he, too, had a habit of shielding John from the truth.
With blinding clarity, he knew what he must do. He would have to push aside his selfish desires and do what was best for Sherlock.  He must end their union.  Now. The decision to tear himself from Sherlock cut as sharp as if a knife be rending John’s insides.  But do so he must, for better it be to part from him and know Sherlock be alive than to see a cold, stiff body lying on the ground or hung from a tree.
“Why, John?”
“I will think on it.”
John turns his head toward me and opens his eyes; they look so unbearably weary.  It hurts me to see him this way.
everything good.  I have you, don’t I?”
John’s leg and arms are gone now.  I feel cold.
I throw my coat on the table, and pick up the bag I dropped, setting it up on the table, too.
He should not allow Sherlock (
“And what? Just what are you going to do, Sherlock?”  John’s voice rose, his face ruddy with frustration.  “Are you going to kill him?  Eh?  Are you a killer, now; is that how it be?  No.  Leave him to me and my squires; we will dispense with him.  I want no blood on your hands.”
Looking at Sherlock, Lestrade’s anger dissolved into pity.  He had expected the worst, but his imagination had not gone far enough.  In just the few weeks since he’d seen him, the detective’s skin had gone sallow, his hair, dull.  Christ, he even looked like he had lost about 15 kilos.  15 kilos more than he could afford to lose.
A look that would have quickly disappeared had he known it would be two long years until he once again saw John Watson.
“No-o-o!” he cried at the screen. “It’s me, you idiot. I sent Rose!” Springing to his feet, Sherlock ran toward Whitehall; he needed to stop her from leaving. “They’re on the run!” he called to John, knowing John would immediately follow as he had always done. But hearing no feet pounding behind him, reality hit. And grinding to a stop, he pivoted to see John sitting where he’d left him.
Oh, my
“John?”  I pause as I loosen his belt.

My mouth flops open.  When no sound comes out, I slam it shut.
“I love you, too,” he says, as he reaches up to meet my lips that are just starting to tilt toward him.
I miss him already, but I will be strong.  Besides, I cannot now ask him to stay; I was the one who told him he should move out.  I will look like an idiot if I tell him I was wrong.  And soon,
“Sherlock!”  he bellowed, sure his cry would be lost before it reached him.
“Let me dry thee and get thee to bed.”  Helping Sherlock out of the tub, John patted him down, wicking away moisture with a towel warmed by the fire.  And after John finished, Sherlock followed him to the bed, melting onto it.
“Yes, of course.  Why didn’t I think of that!”
“I forgave you because I believed in you.”
John looked at him, waiting patiently as he, seemingly for a second time, offered Sherlock the opportunity to speak.  “Is there anything you wanted to offer tonight?  You don’t have to, you know, but if you do, you’re welcome to.”
Looking behind me, instead of John was a man whom I had never before seen; he was looking around to where the shouting came from, so I could not clearly see his face.  And standing 2 metres away was John, a coffee cup in each hand, fury written in in his eyes and on his face.  Repulsion coursed through me at the thought of a stranger’s hand groping me, but I also thrilled at the menace in John’s voice.  The man immediately scurried off, but John did not pursue him, instead turning his rage on me as he approached where I stood.
“Mary!  Is she alright?!  The baby?  She hasn’t been to see me and I’ve been here 4 days now.”  None of the reasons why she had failed to visit could possibly bode well for him.
“John?”  Sherlock pulled the blankets up over them to keep them warm; he could see the goose bumps forming on John’s arms.
to know.  A note that shattered his world.
Lying there he had nothing to do but think.
“Yes,
He would be wrong, so wrong.
“Another sniper?”
“And Aldus, how be your stomach?  Did the pomegranate help settle it?”  A small smile lifted Sir John’s mouth and creased the sides of his eyes.  Though not many years older than Aldus, he acted a father trying to lift his son’s spirits.
“You are a cruel man, John Watson!”
prick!”
“Did you hear that?”  Reigning in his horse, Cedric stopped.  Twisting in his saddle, his eyes darted into the woods, onto the road in front and in back of them.  “Twas the sound of another set of hooves, maybe two or three.  And a dog.  I heard a dog.”
“What’s wrong?” John asked. “Did they toss her out?” He looked toward the entrance, as if expecting to see Rose at any moment. Feeling that they’d been in the washroom for far too long and not wanting to arouse suspicion, they had left the building, waiting near one of the monuments close by.
That was close.  Too close.  I must not reveal my intentions.  And I must not,
me.  I’d best start now, not a great way to start our married life if I don’t.
Pat, pat.
I yawn again.  “I woke up as you came back into the room.”  Yawn.
On second thought…
kill him; it was worth the risk to put his world back in order.
“I was just wondering, because you said ‘my’ bed and I do not want to go back to sleeping alone...”
I smile.  Instead of the usual “SH” he uses for everyone else, he signs his texts to her with a “P”, Pére.
I lie wide awake, listening to him breath, waiting for him to fully go under.
“I would have thought…”
Awake, then.
He ticked off the time in his head,
“Thou knows how servants gossip.  I remove her head and announce twas her punishment for speaking out of turn.”
Pushing myself up to sit facing him, he leans in to give me a peck on the lips (a peck!), and draws away.
I reflect on my new husband’s inner strength.  His ability to conceal his deepest emotions, his greatest difficulties. He raised a child alone.  He withstood a friendship with
“Jesus Christ, the poor child.”  John’s anger faded into wonder as he envisioned his new daughter.  “Christ, I’m a father.”
“Oleg?” Putting the phone on speaker and balancing it on her knee, Nika cut a generous swath of bubble wrap from an industrial-sized roll.
At heads facing downward. At the young woman who shielded the eyes of the child beside her while she herself couldn’t stop staring at what everyone else gawked at. At the man who seemed near hysterics, gesticulating wildly and then covering his mouth with his hand.
“Thou seems to be proving my point, John. I did not tell, and so thou lived.  Alive be better than dead.”
On the other side of the doors they entered an enormous room, easily the same expanse of the house.   It was a room filled with odd artifacts…and rows and rows of large gunmetal gray filing cabinets; there must have been at least a hundred of them.  Cabinets filled with thick files, all meticulously labeled with the names of, presumably, victims Magnussen had blackmailed over the years.  The files held pages of data ranging from financial histories to known associates, to the names of the pets they had had as children.  There were thousands of files, including one labeled ‘Mary Morstan’.
“Obviously.”
When I lean my ear down, he puts his mouth close to it; his warm breath overpowers my senses.  But not more than his words.
had called him “beautiful”…
“My goal, John, is not to have your wife arrested, but to see that whoever has it out for me will never use you a pawn.  Ever again.”
“Sweetheart, wake up.”
I’m relieved.
Already punching in a number on his mobile, he asked over his shoulder, “You can monitor both replays at once?” He didn’t wait for an answer; she would simply have to make do on her own.
“Sherlock, for once just do as I say.  Jesus.”
“Cedric,” John said, pulling himself to his full height.  Despite his weariness, his voice had regained its strength, making him sound every bit the Knight and Commander he be.  “Select the weapons with which Sherlock will arm himself.  He must carry at least two replacement weapons in case he be disarmed.  Hone them until they gleam; I want them so sharp that should he need to use one, they will slice through stone with but a whisper.  Aldus, come with me and Sherlock; you will practice with him his defence moves one more time.  And…”  He paused, contemplating Sherlock.  “Show him the quickest, surest ways to kill a man.  If any blood be spilled, if any life be lost, they will not be his.
are ridiculous, Mr. Holmes.  Ridiculously smart, and gorgeous, and…”
“Say whatever ya’s need t’say, I be leavin’. Ain’t no more work for me here, not that there were. Good thing I make ‘em pay aforehand.” Finished arranging her clothing, the prostitute scoffed at John as she left the stable.
“What about Alderman? What did you find?”
“Yes...?”  Sherlock is tentative, as if he doesn’t understand what I’m trying to tell him.
“It was all about me.  For me.”
“You may not have the patience, but you will do it anyway.  If there are police anywhere in that building, you will not be safe.  Even if you have to wait to talk to her, it is better than being arrested; then you will have no choice in the matter.  Stay here, I’ll be back soon.”
“How do you know?” Illogically, I whisper, as if someone down the block could hear me. I turn to look, but Sherlock’s hand whips out to stop me. “Does he always follow you like this?” Why am I still whispering?!
Two, three.  Four steps.  Each successive ascent, cautious.  Planned.  Why?
Sherlock laughed. “You’ve always said that. But wait, you don’t…” Could he hope?
Only half-aware that Colin had joined them, John’s left hand clenched and stretched.  And clenched again.  Why had they arrested Sherlock?  Whatever it be, it could not be as grim as murder.  He breathed easier at the thought; everything would be fine, just fine.  Twas all a misunderstanding.  John could think of nothing else for which Sherlock could have been charged.
His evening stubble is rough on my hand as I stroke his cheek. “I love you, you know.  The thought of hurting you is…unthinkable; it is the last thing I want to do.”
“Go on, he will not bite you.”  Sir John chuckled as if amused at the thought.
. Nika collapsed onto the edge of the sofa.
“She’s working.”
Sherlock talked from behind his hands steepling at his mouth. “Perhaps he owes something to my father?  Or wants something from my father which cannot be purchased?”
serious.  Now shhh.”  Sherlock covered John’s mouth with his own, any further words muffled, then silenced.
“What’s Sherlock done this—”
(See the end of the chapter for
This time, Nika knew exactly who was calling her; she’d put his name in her contacts.
On the flight from London, she had researched the use of computer chips in the human brain; there was no admission of research being so advanced that it was at the clinical trial stage in human beings, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t out there. Was this all part of an experiment gone wrong?
Feet away from John’s bed, Sherlock straightened himself and threw on an invisible cloak of confidence; he would need all the help he would get. But the moment he stepped past the room divider and saw his friend, the cloak fell off, all thought of artifice gone. The only thing that mattered was John.
“I’ve never known you to do one speck of housework, even after all the times I’ve asked you to help.  As I recall, you said ‘housework is for old ladies and others who have nothing better to occupy their minds and time’.  So something else must be up.  What is it, Sherlock?”
“Of course, you were.”
“Yeah?” There! He grabbed the crutch, both he and it still upright. Miracle of miracles.
Mary.  But still…he thought with the baby on the way Mary decided to once and for all put her past behind her.  It appeared he was wrong.  Very wrong.
The pulse of my existence is gone.
I sit still and quiet long enough that John reaches out touches my hand.  “Sherlock?  Did I answer all your questions?”
Colin stood staring at Sherlock.
John looked at the lips that until now he had never realized called out to him like a Siren.  Yes.  Yes, he very, very much wanted to kiss Sherlock.
was he doing?
Colin laughed, a deep “ha!” that told her that he indeed be happy at the thought of having a sibling.  Laila knew he had always been disappointed that he had no brothers or sisters.  As a boy, he had had no one to play games with when she would not let him go outside.  As a fatherless young man, no one to share the burden of an ailing mother.
I also came to Katie’s aid when, at age 15, she became drunk at a party.   She was scared to tell her father, and even though all she wanted to do was go home and lie in her own bed, she felt she would rather ‘die’ than tell John. (Teenagers can be so dramatic!).  Katie called me for advice, and I fetched her in a cab.  She told her father she was staying the night at a friend’s house, but I tucked her safely up in John’s old room until she was sufficiently sober to go home the next afternoon, promising she would never, ever, drink again.   John’s and my friendship suffered a near fatal blow when he found out about the incident.  He said it was not only his right to know about something so serious, but it was my responsibility to tell him.  “How could you be so daft?” He yelled at me.  It took a weeks for him to calm down.  Weeks he glared at me in the hallway whenever we ran into each other (“I am sorry, John!).  Weeks he forbid Katie to see me.  But John finally forgave me, telling me he was glad his daughter had me to turn to… and then he hugged me, one of only three times he did so in the many years before moving in with me in Wales.
