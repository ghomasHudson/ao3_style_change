Sebastian Moran had been spotted in London. Mycroft was rarely one step behind (despite what his brother claimed) however, this time proved to be different. Mycroft sat in John’s plaid chair, as his brother answered his phone. “John, since you are getting milk why don't you also pick up-” His face paled. “John?” Sherlock looked over at his brother, the room flooding with fear and something else.
“You smell like fresh honeysuckle. Sweet but a tinge bitter, I thought you were a dream.” John mouthed into the highly sensitive flesh of Sherlock’s offered neck. “You don’t have much to say. Was it something I said then? Or is it something I’m doing.” The Alpha straddled his prey bringing both hands up to cradle the young man’s face, running the pad of his calloused thumbs over the slightly parted lips. “You’re just a soft pretty thing. Your scent is intoxicating.” The Alpha tilted Sherlock’s head back having full access to the slender neck. A brownish blond stubble scratched at the delicate skin, the Alpha’s nose wanted to be closer to the gasping young Omega.
Sherlock can't explain the warmth that is spreading through his soaked clothes, John removes his own jacket to cover them both. "Come on don't be shy, we can huddle under this poor excuse of a roof while you form a plan. Too bad our phones have zero service out here."
“ You should have let me in. Too much is on the line now. You made your decision and I must make mine. I loved you. I really believed that because you treated me like your equal, I might actually have a place in your heart. Stupid me. You couldn’t even trust me to know you were alive. Instead you went off on your own. You should have let me in. Well you were right Sherlock Holmes.”
An unexpected dinner guest.
“Training?” John kneeled down with his head on Caleb’s knees. “Tell me this wasn't done to you by Mycroft’s people.”
“Is there something you’re looking for my little busy bee?”
“John. I love you! Please look at me.” The Alpha’s plea would have any omega whimpering in response but john had to be strong. three long years with a broken bond had taught him to be strong. Instead he growled and hissed.
Mycroft wasn't one to believe in children's stories, even as a child he doubted the existence of non tangible beings. Santa Claus and the tooth fairy were pathetic representations of evolving primitive thought and urban legend. He simply asked his mother to give him money upfront instead of insisting on partaking in such hedonistic rituals.
“Naked or clothed either way you will sleep next to me. It’s your choice John.”
The Omega smiled and took Caleb’s hand placing it over his belly button. The Alpha perked up feeling the tiny kicks and flutters.
John knows it hurts the stranger when he forgets that name.
Always after Sebastian would lick the shell of John’s ear, panting heavily “ Until Jim can fix me, you will smell like me and you will accept this or, I promise you, pup or no pup, you’ll be on your knees sucking off my men and drinking their cum. while I have a wank. “ The bruises left behind were the only physical signs of their time together, that and the reek of Sebastian. It wasn't as strong as Sherlock’s but it was starting to become all John knew.
John couldn’t hold back a sob, he stood up sitting next to the neutered Alpha.
“Awe, I thought I was your Fafa.” Greg chose that moment to return home.
John felt ill. He took deep breaths. He was close to hyperventilating when he felt a hand reach out from under the table and squeeze his own gently. John stiffened and focused on his plate of food now set in front of him. Moran watched him closely from across the lavishly set table.
I've been asked to continue this story. lol i guess everyone doesn't want this to be left without knowing what will happen.
Mycroft arched an eyebrow and patted his sons back. Yes, this was his son. Liam belonged to him as did Gregory.
John shivered, lowering himself even deeper into the bubbles, his hands nervously rubbing his belly. He needed to get out of this place. He had less than a month before the pup would be born. He wanted to be back in Sherlock’s toned arms, needed to fill his lungs with the scent of his love.
“Sssh, none of that talk John. Your Alpha is a lucky man. He's out there forming a plan. It's all being taken care of. We will get you out of here.”
John sighed and left his food untouched, he really needed that shower, a cold unforgiving one.
“Alright it’s safe to talk.” Caleb sighed, he eyed John carefully. “How are you? Have they hurt you?”
Now in frustration Sherlock was taking it out on Mycroft’s expensive office furniture.
The room was spartan, what had he expected? There was a bed neatly made, everything about this room was sterile, free of clutter and momentos. There was a picture on the nightstand of a young soldier with his parents.
Competent hands brought their hard cocks together, Sherlock was well aware of the gap in comparison, he was naturally smaller he didn’t have time to feel inadequate, not when hard flesh met hard flesh.  The Alpha pulled his mouth back, Sherlock whimpered trying to follow.
here we go! Another update for my dear M. I hope it's to your liking everyone! find me on tumblr! Things will get a little interesting in the next chapter.
He wanted to finish quickly so he could perhaps test his newly formed theories about John's actions.
“Yes. So I’ve been told. How’s the little one.” Caleb asked looking to John’s belly.
The salt from the sea is mixing with the wind and hatefully cold rain, John despite all this has a grin on his face. He pulls Sherlock to him, without a word, he presses the tall detective hard against the rough brick of the building.
“Yes.” Caleb went and sat on the large bed stiffly. “We had no idea he was planning on kidnapping you. I was meant to infiltrate his web and report anything useful on his movements. But then you were taken so I had to act fast. The whole time I was in training.”
John hated how his voice wavered saying his ex bond mates name. Hated how his free hand clinched into a tight fist at his side.  “Alone does protect us. Goodbye.”
“ He is nobody Sigerson. Just someone that used to know your dead papa. But we are going home you and I. He will not be visiting or stopping by.” John took his son’s small hand and pushed his taller blond sister towards the door. Harry shot several glares over her shoulder but ultimately followed her brother’s lead.
thanks for the patience friends. Life is a little crazy. I lost a friend to suicide and my heart has been so broken. Depression is a mother FUCKER. I've been angry and sad in a big awful mixed up circle of emotions. Then I received a promotion at work, yup I am the overlord aka department manager...however the ever watchful H.R. says I can't have the commoners call me Lord Leach or her majesty. So not fun...also calling them peasants or commoners is also a no no. Geeeeze whats the use of a new tittle if I dont get to run with it lol. Anyway, that aside Husband Leach and I have purchased a house wooohooo! super excited we are waiting for escrow to hurry the f up and be done with it...so 35 days and counting Team Leach will have a place our minions can call home! So this month started out sad and moved into something to celebrate. My old laptop died so my boss bought me a new one!!!! I'll hurry and add more.  Mycroft and his team don't know that John's not dead yet. They've been too busy cleaning house.
“Forgive my tardiness John. I had business. The case we were on-”
He grew up as did most his age hearing stories of soul mates, the theory was disgustingly sentimental. Logic was god to the elder Holmes, therefore love, or the existence of one's destined mate was laughable.
It was Sebastian that made it a nightmare. The Alpha had made it clear that he and John would share a bed. As a security measure of course, he hadn't taken John’s bonding bracelets from him. Moriarty wanted them to stay put, John was grateful and suspicious of the reasoning.
as always sooo patient! love u guys! I've been reading a lot of manga lately so i've been soooo lazy.

“Da, lav.” The young Omega wrapped his arms around the British Government's neck and squeezed tightly. “Da. Fafa.”
This man with the sharp cheekbones, and unruly curls, all so familiar to me. Whoever said men aren't beautiful obviously never met this man.
“I suppose you can fill me in on the way home” Sherlock heard the blond Alpha grumble leaving him in a state of shock.
John in labor.
So caught up in the chase Sherlock missed the trip wire, however John was quick to push him out of the deafening blast, the rain stopped, but Sherlock still was shivering due to his damp clothes.
"You were saying you knew where the smugglers are meeting?"
“Damn.” John hadn't felt such a stirring since his waking up in the hospital. He needed release, but damn his new status. He would normally find a willing partner have a mutual one night stand, a night of thrusting deep into a wanting partner spending until there was nothing left then showering a quick peck to the cheek and taking leave.
“John, I’m sorry I’m so late. However I did bring you some tea from home.”
“Come here, let’s get you cleaned off, I have a shirt you can borrow yeah?”
heart on the line anymore. The run in with a knife wielding assassin was just a reminder of the dangers that followed the man. John couldn't be apart of that world. Sherlock Holmes wasn't his anymore, and John couldn't allow the erratic unpredictable bastard into his life.
John shook his head, “No. It doesnt matter. Caleb what happened? I thought you were away on assignment.”
"It wasn't my fault Mummy, he pushed me first. It was self-defense. He was the one being ar-ard-arduous." Sherlock looks down sheepishly. He wishes he was with Redbeard.
John was speechless. That boy's voice was so deep yet he was so skinny, it didn't match him.  Nothing matched him, his hair was too curly for his head; when he turned around to face John he noticed that his eyes were a striking blue but couldn't place exactly what color. His skin was so pale, it looked sickly as if he weren't taking care of himself properly.
Without thinking a smile stretched onto his face as he greeted Mike. "Mike! What are you doing here? Come here you git!" John pulled him into a hug, both patting each other on the back.
John rubbed the spot in his shoulder that was suddenly giving him pain.
He pushed all of this out of his mind, only focusing on the condensation rolling down the window and into the pane of glass.
It was quite prestigious and he had been surprised that they considered him at all to walk among the grounds. A vase in a hallway probably costed more than the family car.
"Don't you worry about that Johnny, just worry about your grades," was all his mum said on the matter. But he did worry, often. She never mentioned money problems to him but she didn't have to.
John gave a small chuckle back and smiled tightly. "Never been to the country but it sounds nice." He took out his camera and began to fiddle with it, hoping the cabbie saw it as some sort of signal of an end to the conversation. Thankfully he didn't speak another word much to John's relief.
One of the boys looked up at John, which caused the rest to look too. "Can I help you mate?"
His mother bend down to hug her son. "I know darling but you need to be more careful." She tenderly runs a hand down Sherlock's face. "They don't see it as self-defense, listen. I know you're trying your best, okay? I know."
"Sherlock? Are you there?" Mike strolled in, setting down the luggage as he did so.
"Oh yes, hi," he replied. "I'm new here, my name's John. John Watson."
Sherlock wasn't really sure that trucks would be a good game but he agreed anyway because maybe John could make it interesting for him.
John took all of this in stride as they became closer to his room. The way the room was set up didn't seem to bother him much by the way Mike had explained it. He was thankful for his own private bathroom, well him and his roommate's bathroom. From the sound of it, John had a feeling that he would do just fine here, a small glimmer of hope.
He didn't know what to do next so he resolved to sitting on his bed going through his camera that he pulled out of his bag.
John had thought because he is now farther away from home that his sessions with Ella would decrease but that hasn't been the case. Instead of twice a week it has been moved up to three times a week; Sunday, Wednesday, and Saturday. It's not that he doesn't think he needs it because John knows very well that he needs therapy. But this will be his third year and while he and Ella have come a long way he has danced with progress for quite some time.
He can hear Ella's voice say to him "This will be good for you, a change of scenery is what you need."
Sherlock meets John while he is in trouble.
"We've got newbies in the past before but never in our year so I'm happy to see you," Mike spoke as he climbed up the stairs. John took note of his friend's husky build and muscles that had appeared from the years of rugby.
After gathering directions from two fourteen year olds, that helped him in no way, shape, or form, John finally came about the boarding house he was assigned to.
He heard the commotion of rowdy boys coming from that direction and decides to head there. He opened the door to reveal a small group of boys circled around each other, laughing with one another. It looked to be a comfortable room. A sofa sat in corner across from a fire place with two boys lounging comfortably on top. All around were things to make this place feel like home, a small piano in the back, dart board, table tennis, a flat screen in the corner with the sofa.
Sherlock loves having John as a friend, or just a friend in general. He needed somebody to play pirates with him. One day, Valentine's Day to be exact, it was tradition to make valentine baskets so you could put Valentine cards and candy in. Everyone was in a hurry to find out who left cards for who. Sherlock found all of this very dull.
This chapter isn't as long as I wanted it to be, but posting anyway and I'll see what I can do with it later. Hope you enjoyed! I'll try to post another page or chapter asap!!
He tried not think of recent events that have affected him greatly but it pushed its way into his conscience. The divorce, his dad leaving and never really looking back. The sudden but not really new happening of his mum's drinking. Guilt grew in John's stomach, making him almost physically sick. How could he leave his mum? In a time like this? What kind of son was he? He felt himself already spiraling down a path that was hard to walk out of.
"Hm, what a weird name. I like it!" John says happily.
John said hi quietly, dumped a handful of paper on Sherlock's desk, and ran off without saying another word. This left Sherlock speechless. Why did John run off like that, and what are the pieces of paper? As he opened them one by one, Sherlock had come to find that John had apparently noticed Sherlock not having any cards and decided to write him some. They all contained something different. One had drawings of bees all over the card, another had a drawing of him and John standing on top of the world. Sherlock had never felt so gleeful in his life. This certainly matched with the day Sherlock got Redbeard.
"Sherlock, I just ended a phone call with Ms. Singer," Sherlock rolled his eyes lightly. "Did you actually hit another child?" Mummy asked him. It had been merely five seconds of Sherlock getting through the door and standing in the foyer that Mummy had come from the living room and started to possibly reprimand him.
7 years old
(See the end of the chapter for
Curiosity finally got the best of him as to who his roommate was. He decided to ask Mike, he might know. "Say, do you know who I'm rooming with?"
Just as he was promised there were indeed bunk beds occupying one half of the room and desks in the other half. There were also two wardrobes on either side with a full length mirror in between and a bathroom down the middle splitting the room. It's a good size, definitely cozy and not stuffy. It had muted sea green walls with different frames of art covering it. On the ceiling was a mini chandelier brightly lighting up the room when Mike had flicked the light switch.
Why does he need to go to a school so far in the country anyway? What's the point of that, he'll get the same education as he did at his old school, so what does it matter?
"Sherlock."
Thankfully a few students noticed his struggle and opened the door for him. He muttered a quick thank you and dragged his luggage in behind him. He would have to make a point to get a passkey.
"I'm John, what's your name?" he asks as he munches on animal biscuits.
Sherlock blinks repeatedly as if to process that sentence. "S-sure." The boy sits in the chair next to him and he pulls out a ham sandwich with animal biscuits and two juice boxes.
That makes Sherlock smile as everyone called his name weird, and it made him smile even more when John him his second juice box. It was apple.
John claimed the bottom bunk, he needed to be on the bottom in case his nightmares forced him to fall off. The school required to bring a pillow and a single blanket so John fetched his and made his bed.
"Oh, a boarding school, seems nice." The cabbie said, looking into the rearview mirror. "Ever been into the countryside, or are you a city lover?" He asked then, giving a small chuckle.
Walking down the hall, he grew more and more anxious. Sounds of objects moving around and feet shuffling became louder as they came through the doorway.
Mike picked up John's bags then resumed walking down the hall to John's room. Just like he said, it didn't take much longer to reach it. The door had the number twenty one engraved into its wood that was the color of mahogany. It appeared quite rustic, fitting in perfectly with the ambience of the building.
John's eyes bugged. "You're serious? What else is he like?"
Silence answered back. No one seemed to be here. For reasons unknown he found that to be a bit strange.
It didn't take long, it was a small town and John was one of few people on the streets. The cabbie helped him with his bags and didn't comment on the limp in his leg as everybody else usually does. He makes light conversation on the weather, the horrible traffic Makanshire's having, even asks where John is headed.
Over the weeks' John has played over at Sherlock's house more times than he can count. They played many things, pirates, chefs, detectives, and John loved them all. He likes being over at Sherlock's better because mummy and daddy fight a lot and he likes quietness.
Fifteen minutes later the cab pulled into a graveled driveway, passing two marvelous iron gates that were towering over them. As soon as the car stopped outside of the crumbling walls that led into the estate itself, John eagerly toppled out, nearly tripping over himself. The cabbie opened the rear and helped him gather his luggage up, kindly offering to help John all the way to where he needed to go.
"Yeah, see you later," John waved off. Mike disappeared leaving John alone. He glanced around the room in a daze deciding what to do next. Unpacking, that's what's next.
After placing his toiletries inside of the bathroom, John was finally done. It did take him some time to do so, he chose to bring most of home with him so he wouldn't feel lonely during his stay.
At first John was not happy with the decision of transferring to Finchdale.  It didn't matter to him that it had been his dad's "home away from home". His family needs him and going to some school thirty miles away won't help. Not to mention the money they didn't have to pay for the school.
Traffic started up again, and they slowly wind their way through the roads to their destination. John watched again as the city life slowly trickled away letting trees grow more and more together, and buildings became less prominent.
The bell rings, signaling the end of recess and the beginning of snack time. Ms. Singer said Sherlock could stop being in time out after the bell rings so just like all the other students, he walks to the cabinets that hold their lunch boxes.
There were six boarding houses, three for girls and three for boys. They were all categorized by names who influenced greatly within history. His boarding house was named accordingly - Doyle.
John could see Mike visibly wince. Was he that bad? He stopped walking and turned around to face him. He set down the bags he was carrying and took a deep breath in. He seemed hesitant to talk but decided to anyway.
John was walking up the stairs when Mike approached him.
John stiffened at the mention of his old school but only for a fraction of a second. His smile suddenly felt too thin and began to droop down. "Mum wanted me to go to my dad's old school, felt like it was better than Darnier." That wasn't a lie but not the whole story either.
He sits down and opens his box to strawberries and bananas. Sherlock was the only one who ate alone, or so he thought. "Can I eat with you?" a voice asked. It made Sherlock look up because he was sure this boy was not talking to him. No one ever talks to him. He had blond hair, clear blue eyes, and a friendly open smile. "Can I?" he asks again.
He was starting to think that maybe this was a bad idea until a familiar voice made itself known from th back of the room.
Ella would have a field day with this. She would tell him that he shouldn't blame himself on something that was bound to happen. If he is having certain thoughts about certain things that don't exactly need to be mentioned he needs to tell her.
"Sherlock," Mike greeted. "Got someone here for you–"
Sherlock looked to find John around the room and found him already staring at him from his desk. He mouthed 'thank you' and got a beaming grin in response. Sherlock stuck the cards in his basket and continued with maths. He already had ideas, later John would find cards in his jacket pocket with no idea how they got there.
“You will be fine John, you and the baby. No one will hurt you. I swear it.”
"John!" Sherlock pushed his friend his love from him gently. Coughing as the smoke cleared. There was no response, "John, I've got you." John was hurt, the back of his head bleeding, something had struck John in the explosion. Sherlock cradled Johns head in his lap fumbling for his nearly dead mobile. John had shielded Sherlock and now, now John was bleeding.
“I was.” The Alpha smiled ruefully. “We knew that Moriarty was planning something so I agreed to a plan that Mycroft came up with.”
The Alpha put a finger to his lips, and he held his watch up, it made a beeping noise and then a little light at the side of the cheap black digital watch turned green.
Mycroft blamed himself even if no one else was. He should have destroyed Moriarty when he had the chance, put him and his bad dog down. God only knew what horrid traumas John Watson was being put through or had been forced to endure.
Once his hand circled the thick cock, the towel somehow forgotten and discarded, he moaned wanting  to suddenly feel more of his skin against the Alpha who was scenting him.
My name is John.
John sank down into the warmth of the rather large tub filled with bubbles. He wished the bubbles were scented so he could at least wash and cover up the stink of Moran. John pulled at the tight leather collar around his neck. It was locked in place, a reminder that John wasn’t a free man.  During the day he was allowed free rein of the spartan decorated flat. It was modern and comfortable, every window was made of bulletproof glass. Something John had tested out on his first day after knocking out one of his armed handlers. The door was locked and so John tried to shoot the lock when that didn’t work he tried throwing a chair at the window, it only bounced off. So did the bullets in the gun he had stolen.
The Omega moaned arching up again, forgetting all reason. “I was thinking of you too, look what you do to me.” John took the Omega’s smaller fisted hand, detangling the duvet from the Omega’s slender fingers. So soft, smooth and warm, John brought the younger man’s hand down to where the towel covered the now very stiff and very pronounced Alpha cock.
The thoughtless breaking of a bond. It had been easily done and without second thought to John’s well being. His fucking breaking heart. He is wearing his blue stripped shirt, his arm in a sling. The omega takes a breath, unsteadily he turns fully towards the large picture window. Up until now he had only been partially facing.
John frowns, his head aches and the memory was almost there almost tangible.  Then he looks at the hand that gave him the thermos. Bruised knuckles, he instinctively knows the younger man has been in a fight. Eyes scan that beautifully sharp face, there is more evidence there nothing broken just a few bruises and scrapes.
Mycroft stood back as his brother proceeded to destroy the office. His staff had become accustomed to such outbursts these last few weeks. No one blinked or dared to interfere. When his brother had first received the distressing video message, Mycroft had been visiting 221B. He had distressing news concerning his brother and mate.
He reassures me when I become distressed, the monitors betray me.
My mouth is dry, he presses a straw there and on reflex I can drink. I think of the desert when the lights shine too brightly in my eyes. He turns them down and growls at the nurse.
Moriarty sighed dramatically, leaning back in his chair at the end of the rectangular table. “Sebby, dear. Not at the dinner table. We are all on the same side. Caleb wants retribution just as you do and he is in no physical condition to um, well to put it delicately, take what’s yours. He’ll just guard John for now. Now, “ Moriarty clapped his hands. “Let’s eat. I’m starved! Talking vengeance always puts me in the mood for food!”
The slick warmth pared with the friction of his own phallus was too much for the novice Omega. He felt his toes curl and knees squeeze the hips above his own. A coil of heat tightened in his stomach, he felt the anticipation of something he had never known. No one had touched him like this.
The scent of this Omega made him nauseous, like Baileys, mint and copper. The baby kicked in response to his father’s panic. “Oh. There there, wee one. Uncle Jim isn’t going to hurt you. In fact, I should have a little cousin for you to play with soon. Growing so big, you are.” James crouched down talking to John’s belly. The mad man smiled up at John. “And you, doctor Watson, how are you feeling? Any thoughts of suicide and hatred for this load you carry?” John didn't answer. “Of course not. You are practically glowing! I wish pregnancy was easy on all of us, however, it's not always the case. “
The belief in Soul Mates was a very popular and ancient religion.
“Yes, before the accident we were on a case. It doesn’t matter. The ones who-” Sherlock felt his voice break with emotion. He coughed in an attempt to cover it up, “It’s over John. The culprits have been taken into custody.”
“I have a plan John. Do you trust me?”
Sherlock is glad for the dim lighting his cheeks grow warm and he attempts to think of anything else other than how John's hard thigh feels against his own. "For warmth." John reassures as he wraps his strong arms around the younger man's narrow waist. Sherlock tries to focus, on the case and not the blond.
John had then slipped into the main entrance following the beautiful scent of Honeysuckle, one he easily matched with the youngest Holmes. And the young Omega was not disappointing, with his open challenge those eyes were fierce, and cheekbones one could cut glass with them. He imagined holding that angular face in his calloused hands, rubbing the pads of his thumbs over those cupid’s bow lips.
“The case?” John hesitates holding the thermos in his hands like one would a fragile object, his blue eyes stare down at the object.
It's not a dream.
He entered the small one bedroom flat, things were still in boxes, dusty boxes so the Alpha had lived here, or rather stored his things here. Then again he was a career soldier, not anymore but it was obvious the man was rarely home. There were no signs of a lover, and Sherlock wondered why that made him feel relief.
John expected to eat alone but such hopes were dashed as he waddled into the small dining room set for four. John glanced at the three faces, two Alphas and one gleaming Omega. He kept his face neutral and took the empty seat next to a now standing Moran.
A small smile seemed to play on Mycroft’s lips. “You can only imagine the Christmas dinners.”
Tedious.” Sherlock shook his head, as if the very memory bothered him. “Besides, I was sure that my brother would ask to talk to you by the time supper was over, and I do avoid talking to him if I could at all help it.”
“It’s been a week, John. A
Sherlock’s grin faded. “A clinic? Please. You haven’t even practiced your learned profession since you came back. Besides which you are already employed by the British Security Forces --”
John went with her agreeably, casting a surreptitious glance up as he passed the flight of stairs, catching sight of a landing but nothing else. “Uh, so … you said 221C is a basement, right?”
Sherlock frowned; he had never seen this girl before, and while she seemed to have recognized him, her general expression remained unchanged – indeed, her eyes had a flat, inward-looking gaze, almost as if she was listening to – something – or
“—bedsit, yes. But Sherlock’s flat is much bigger, and he can use someone to share the rent, which I can provide. Likewise, I can find you locum work in a nearby clinic, so that you can maintain a semblance of separation, as he is very keen –”
John frowned at his phone as he typed his response. How did Mycroft get his number? He didn’t recall giving it.
“Who are you?”
Turning to the young man, Lestrade’s upper body briefly flared silver as he frowned at him. “What’ve you done to the girl, Nathan?”

“Then perhaps you would feel better if you called me Mycroft rather than the lugubrious
“Three houses burned down in Chelsea –”
“Sherlock …”
“Photo and file came from Holmes himself, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this guy had tripped off some Secret Service wires or something. But if he did, they’re not telling us. Yet.” Greg shook his head. “At least there hadn’t been any more parties since you went down, Cap, so even if our perp here was part of some greater conspiracy I’m not yet too worried that someone else is going to make a move. Of course, when you get out of here …”
“Well, it might be news to you, but I can imagine how some people might not like hearing their secrets being spilled in public.”
,” Sherlock grinned suddenly, and the expression made his features somehow younger. “You invaded Afghanistan.”
“Mate, the whole bloody business makes me wish I was back in Afghanistan, and that’s saying something.” John shook his head as he fixed a critical eye towards the back of the crowd, watching the bushes and the assorted frippery that seemed to always accompany this level of ostentation, searching for anything that seemed out of place – after all, he may not be perfectly happy with his current assignment, but it went against the grain for him to let his guard down. Seeing nothing that aroused his suspicion at that point, John then looked towards the well-lit house, quickly but methodically doing a visual scan of every floor. Almost all the windows were empty, except for one set on the second floor where three figures were sharply silhouetted, all of them standing rather still, likely in conversation.
It was a small apartment, though still bigger than John’s current bedsit. There was a very old-looking fireplace in one corner, a single window that let the sunlight in, and not much else, unless one counted the black mould that ran around the lower part of the walls and the peeling wallpaper, and his heart frankly dropped into his stomach. “Well. This all looks … lovely, Mrs. Hudson,” John forced out. “But you’re right. It does need fixing.”
Sherlock inclined his head, a gesture that reminded John forcefully of Mycroft. “Indeed, Doctor Watson. Or should I say …
– defied logic as well. It was just that … something convinced him to keep John near, somewhere where Sherlock could observe him, study him, get to know him. His mother, with her Gift for intuition, would most likely have called it
“And you’re Sherlock, unless I misheard Mrs. Hudson.” John gave him a small smile. “You never
“It’s getting late,” Sherlock said, gesturing towards the sky with one cocked eyebrow. “Dinner, then?”
to be part of a case. It had been almost a week since he had hatched his new plan of action, and the waiting was pure torture. “And what use are these criminals if they can’t even come up with something interesting?”
“Well,” Greg said, “The last time you suited up, you ended up with an assassin and half of Britain’s finest in your debt. Maybe second time’s the charm.”
A brief smile appeared on Sherlock’s face before he turned away and started walking. “Then follow me, Doctor Watson. Chinese awaits.”
He pulled his Belstaff in tightly around his body as he slid into the dark, cool interior of the car, catching only a winking silver glimpse of the driver’s Gift as it was recalled. “I hope there’s a good reason behind your using the taxpayers’ money to set your driver after me, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, pulling the door shut with ill grace and turning to face the vehicle’s other occupant.
“Mind Palace?”
“Huh. Looks like it’s time for dinner,” John said, taking one last look at the gathering crowd before turning back around to face the other person, fully intending to tell him that he wouldn’t have minded going out to the gardens anyway – but that was as far as he got, because the moment he brought his full attention back to the space beside him, John found it as empty as it was when he had first sat there.
enough. Why couldn’t there be a serial decapitation there somewhere?”
John heard the pride in his voice and could not help but smile. “Oh? Near-perfect? What happened to the other cases?”
A last message came in.
The man raised an eyebrow but said nothing else; instead, he sat back, deeper into the seat, half-hiding his face in shadow. John felt the loss keenly; he hadn’t realised how much he had been enjoying watching the man’s face until he couldn’t see it any more. Wanting to draw the strange man back out into conversation, John shifted slightly on the seat, purposefully angling his body so that some of the light coming from the ballroom would spill into their alcove. “So … you obviously know why I’m here, but why are
“No, it isn’t,” the man said with a shrug, “But things have never really been fair, as far as I’m concerned.”
“Oh, come on, John, I already know
of yours managed to disappear without a trace, despite your best trackers?”
“As I said. Boring.”
Sherlock forced himself to tear his eyes away from John –
“And give you leave to bug every surface of my flat, watch every move I make, decide who I can consort with, jump to conclusions about whether I’m clean or not, send me off to rehab without giving me any choice in the matter?” Sherlock spat. “I will
“Needs must.” Mycroft replied mildly. “All I was asking was for you to look at the folder. If, after doing so, you really feel that you do not wish to take my offer, then I will respect your wishes.”
asking is for you to be in my personal employ. I need a protector like you: loyal, honest, and ready to do what it takes to get the job done.”
A conundrum, that. While John claimed that he had had enough of the frequent danger he found himself in while working for the high and mighty, Sherlock also knew that his position at the local clinic – a safe and predictable place of employment, unless one counted the odd case of strep amongst the ones of gout and rheumatism – bored him to death. John had never said so outright, but Sherlock reads it nonetheless in the weariness of his face and in the line of his shoulders when he comes home from the surgery; he reads it in the shift in his stance and the sudden twinkle in his eyes whenever Sherlock pulls him away from the humdrum to go on wild goose-chases across London’s streets and into interminable stakeouts. No – if there is anything that Sherlock is certain about when it came to John Watson, it was that he lived, just like Sherlock himself, for the thrill of the chase, for the blood it pumped into their veins, for the siren call of the Work, for the uncertainty that perpetually had them walking on the fine edge of excitement and danger. It was a drug, and it was drug of choice for the two of them, binding them together in a way that no one else had bound themselves to Sherlock.
"It's a bit hard to explain but we're almost there so you'll just meet him for yourself and then you assess what he's like then."
He held out his hand for John to take it. "Sherlock Holmes. Apologies for the inconvenience of roommate choice."
“And I am sure you’ve noticed the … lack?”
“I have it on good authority that the initial interest in your – ah, shall we call it
Sherlock was nowhere to be found, strangely enough, when John finally made it up the seventeen steps to his apartment.
John grinned at Sherlock, a silent thanks. “Or he could have gotten lucky and blown your skull open. Ever thought of that?”
to prove a point to anyone,” Sherlock said with enough disdain that convinced John that he was, actually, proving a point despite anything he said to the contrary. “Of course I was serious. I only ever am.” So saying he swept out of the door without so much as a look back to make sure that John was following, as if he were certain that he would.
“I said, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Yes, yes, rugby and mud and sweat. Dull,” Sherlock interrupted, waving an impatient hand. “Detective Inspector, I hope you’re not here to discuss
“Well then, I wish you luck,” John said, and from the rustling Sherlock gathered that John was putting his jacket on. “I’m off.”
“And they aren’t even

John considered. “Fair point.”
His approach went unnoticed on John’s part, given that John’s back was turned, but his companion – this Lestrade – immediately perked up as soon as he saw Sherlock and reached over to nudge John’s shoulder with a closed fist.
The case that had baffled Dimmock and his team took the rest of the day to close. Sherlock had taken a single look at the victim and immediately deduced that she had been forced to take the poisoned pills – information that he had gathered, apparently, from observations regarding her clothing, her jewellery, and a missing mobile phone – and led them unerringly to the suspect. Unfortunately, the said suspect – a murderous cabbie who fancied himself genius enough to elude most of Scotland Yard’s attentions by disguising his kills as suicides – had taken exception to being brought to prison and decided that it was a good day for a rather spectacular chase across London’s rooftops and through some very surprised households. So it was that even with Sherlock's uncanny mastery of London’s pathways and practically half of Dimmock’s force, it took them a while to corner him, and when they did, their quarry had decided to use the gun he held in his hands to shoot the nearest target, who happened to be Sherlock.
Gift ends up working for the government and dedicating their lives to the insinuation of their abominably large noses into other people’s business.” He glared at John. “No. My Gift is in observing. I observe everything, and that is how I
Mycroft looked at him for a second, his expression carefully schooled; with a delicate sniff, he reached over the chair he had been sitting on to pull out a thick file folder from seemingly nowhere. “Here is a more complete file on Mr. Hughes, as well as whatever intel we have gathered on the group to which he belongs. The network is rather vast, as you will see, stretching as far as Russia and Japan. There are reports that place sleeper agents in China, Africa, and Israel within that web.”
Slow and sure wins the race, Watson,
John wrenched his eyes away from Sherlock’s fingers, willing the train of thoughts away.
“On good authority. Hmm.” Sherlock sat back as he narrowed his eyes at Mycroft. He noted the carefully cultivated body posture and facial expression that screamed nothing but aggrieved annoyance, and the slight sheen of sweat on Mycroft’s upper lip that said the absolute opposite. “And since when has this
“Consulting detective?” John asked distractedly as he watched the medical team lift the heavy stretcher into the waiting ambulance and feeling the tingling in his fingers finally ebb slowly away. “What’s that, exactly?”
.” Sherlock shook his head, suddenly weary. “Let me out, Mycroft. I have had enough of this conversation.”
“Yes. Everything I need to remember is stored in my Mind Palace; that way I do not forget anything.” Sherlock put the torch down and began to sniff the block as he spoke. “As I was saying, I had come out of my Mind Palace and you were asleep, so we could not continue our discourse even if I had already come to a mutually pleasing decision. What else was I supposed to do?”
“No, not mine, John.” Mycroft gestured towards the envelope, and John pulled out a single sheet of paper, the heading of which simply said
Posting a bit earlier than usual -- I hope you guys continue to enjoy! Your comments and kudos (kudoses?) seriously give me life. Cheers!
“I’m sorry?”
The girl looked down at Sherlock’s hand, then back up to meet his eyes. “Wrong answer, Sherlock,” she whispered, slightly sing-song, but for a split-second Sherlock thought he saw a look of sad resignation in the depth of her flat irises before a sharp, unbearable brightness began to spill from her hands, spreading down and outwards onto the ground beneath her.
The girl’s jaw twitched; Sherlock could see her now trying actively to keep herself from speaking, but clearly whoever it was that was making her do what she was doing was much more powerful in his or her Gift than she could resist
“Asleep? You expect me to be asleep while you … blew things up?” John exhaled loudly. “Jesus. What were you doing anyway? Couldn’t you have waited until I was actually awake?”
Mycroft shook his head in exasperation. “Why are you so determined not to accept what protection I can provide you as well, Sherlock?”
So if Sherlock’s suspicions proved true – and he was quite certain of his own conclusions – what then should he make of John Watson? Why would an adrenaline junkie with a suicidal streak decide to do the precise inverse of what he longed to do? It wasn’t for lack of power; Sherlock had seen John call on his Gift a handful of times now, and every single time it took his breath away – watching John transform from benign-jumper-wearing-tea-making John into I’m-in-charge-and-I-won’t-take-your-shite-sitting-down John, with no sign of his Gift waning in any way, as so often happened to individuals whose Gifts pull so much from their life force. Neither was it for lack of opportunity; in an attempt to suss out the truth Sherlock had hacked into the MI5 files as soon as John had fallen asleep that first day he presented himself at Baker Street, and found that not only had John
Assassin. Vest.
“You.” John cut in, loud enough to be heard over Mrs. Hudson’s squawks, and she immediately fell silent, her eyes wide. “The other night. That was you.”
Huffing with surprise and exertion, John looked up to meet Sherlock’s eyes over the girl’s shoulder. “Sherlock,” he managed between panting breaths, “Could you – maybe hold – I can’t –”
John shifted impatiently, annoyance flaring bright in his chest.
“Still looking into that. We’ve got Donovan and Anderson on the case.”
At that, John stepped forward, nearer to the girl, his hands out in a placating gesture. “Sweetheart, I need you to try and calm down for me,” he said, his voice even and confident. “I am a doctor; are you having a medical emergency?”
“Yes, of course.” John answered, and in his mind’s eye he saw a cloud of ash, billowing in the strong desert wind. “Far … too much.”
“How about nudging me gently and waking me up?”
“A pint. Chips. Whatever. You haven’t eaten more than a bite of my toast this morning, don’t think I haven’t noticed.” Sherlock snorted. John’s preoccupation with his eating and drinking habits bordered on the ridiculous. “You’re like a bloody gazelle, all legs and arms.”
Sherlock had tried to ignore the black vehicle with heavily tinted windows that had been tailing him ever since he had left Baker Street for as long as he possibly could, but once he paused to cross the road, the car somehow managed to sidle in front of him, door silently and immediately opened, effectively blocking his way. He sighed in irritation but knew that trying to avoid it any further would be pointless; the driver was clearly an insinuator and would keep blocking his path until he acquiesced.
“Hang on,” John said, catching the implication in Greg’s tone and frowning. “What about for when I get out of here?”
a fair point. “That wasn’t just me.”
He lifted his hand to use the brass knocker, but even before he could grasp the metal handle the door flew open, revealing an elderly woman in a flowered apron and a wide smile. “Oh, Doctor Watson! You’re here!”
– just so I can keep a weather eye on your brother?” He gripped the tumbler tightly in one hand even as he fought the urge to crumple the paper he held in the other. “And it hasn’t occurred to you that perhaps he has his own reasons for doing this? That maybe he can protect himself? Or – God forbid – that he would find out?”
? – has significantly increased over the past three months, brother mine.” Mycroft sniffed, looking briefly out of the window. “I’ve told you this before, but I’ll say it again, and with greater urgency: you
John thought he heard a wistful note in the man’s voice, and felt a sudden, overwhelming need to do what he could to somehow make it up to him. The party was, after all, being held in John’s honour; in some roundabout way, he was just as responsible for keeping this person in this situation as much as whoever it was who dangled the consequences above his head to make him stay. “Well, you might have been forced to be here, but certainly you’re not required to stay here,
Hooking the umbrella on his right arm to free his hands, Mycroft Holmes poured a generous measure into two tumblers, included two ice cubes in one glass, and left the other untouched. He handed the glass with ice to John, then raised his own in salute. “To your health, Captain Watson.”
invite me to come with.”
With no time or thought to spare, John called on his Gift for one last, desperate move – and for a shivering moment everything went still, time suspending, slowing down to seconds …
John pushed his fists into his own jacket for warmth and nodded gratefully. “Starving,” he admitted.
“No, no,” Dimmock said, flushing. “There’s … ah. A stiff at Lauriston Gardens. Brixton. Can’t make heads or tails of it. Will you come?”
Mrs. Hudson finally managed to open all the locks and, giving the door a hard tug, swept her hands towards the space in a magnanimous gesture. “Here you go, Doctor. 221C.”
what you use to solve the cases, isn’t it? Your Gift?”
“Well, I don’t really know what else to do, and it’s where my Gift had always been best used,” Lestrade said defensively. “Not all of us have medical degrees under our belts, Cap. I mean, what would you have me do instead? Find runaway cats or something?”
” Sherlock sat back into his chair with a curious mix of triumph and disgust on his face. “That
“The problem?” John shook his head; it may have been his intention to get Sherlock to trust him enough to allow John to live nearby, but he certainly did not expect to be asked to live
“I need that tracking, Lestrade, stat,” John half-panted, half-growled as he leapt over the last low barricade that separated him and the hallway entrance. “ETA one minute.”

a case, he needed for
John smiled, helplessly charmed. “Then what do you say we get out for some air, then? Maybe go around the paths a little, stretch our legs? I thought I saw a lovely garden –”
“My brother,” Mycroft said with quiet disdain, “
John hesitated – as he had just demonstrated, Mycroft Holmes was perfectly capable of manipulating good will into something that served his purposes – but right now the eyes that steadily met his contained to guile, no falsehood; at least, none that he could see. He sighed. “Alright. Fine.”
“But if that’s the case, why hire me? He’d just reject me. I might be one person, but he would still see me as part of your retinue. I don’t think that will make him agree to it any more than a whole army would.”
John looked up to see Sherlock looming over him; for a split-second his figure was overlaid on a field of bodies and a bloody Afghan sun, but then John blinked and the image was gone. John shook his head quickly to clear it, automatically seeking refuge in deflection. “You’re the one whose brains could have been decorating that third-floor flat right now. And you’re asking
John blinked, his mind latching on to the only words that made sense to him in the whole monologue. “Boring? I was being … boring?”
“Yes, well I’m
John gave his fingers a squeeze, conceding to the point, "Very true. And those decorations on Oxford Street are
any longer?”
“Two different things,” Sherlock told him with a scoff. “And I’m not avoiding anything. Nothing you’ve said deserves an answer. Mostly because you already
John raised a shaky hand to cradle the nape of Sherlock’s neck and whispered softly, “Me too.”
"Well, I thought we could either start slow," John replied, running his fingers over the back of Sherlock's hand, "learning how to sleep together, kissing in bed, perhaps some...
,” Sherlock grumbled and abruptly took a long, crowded step to press up against Greg’s front, cup the back of his neck, and press their lips together.
“He's going to get louder,” he warned, sharing a sharp, wanton smile with Greg as he rolled up into Sherlock, starting slow, teasing, soft, before taking both men by surprise and snapping his hips forward. It sent Sherlock jerking up the bed with a high pitched whine, one he repeated when John began a rhythm of quick, rough jerks of his hips.
Sherlock lifted his eyebrows and then blinked, leaning back in surprise, unsure if he liked how easily John had tricked him, had shocked him, had gone behind his back for so long without his knowledge, “Oh. She was in on it, was she? I should have known.”
“Like that, do you?” John chuckled huskily, his other hand still cupping the back of Sherlock’s neck. He stroked the short, soft curls there idly, twirling and twisting them around his fingers with an eager but gentle tug; something he had often ached to do whenever Sherlock was hunched over an experiment or his laptop, but had always denied the want in the next second.
Humming, Sherlock brought those long, nimble, coarse-padded fingers of his down along the centre of John’s torso, pausing on the way for a skimming touch of his navel, and then spreading to press and caress along the clinging waistband, “
- Who’s the deviant now?”
. His name is Toby. Good dog. Friendly. Smart. Fantastic tracker. Half spaniel and half lurcher. A bit clumsy, but endearingly so.”
John just continued to smile that smile and sipped his tea again, “Hold your hand out, and I’ll give it to you.”
. - He's a genu–geen–
“I don’t think he would have been making those same eyes at you if he didn’t,” Mrs Hudson said as John came back into the room.
"You hang onto the most hole-ridden, loose, frayed, and
naked too,” Sherlock told him, moving to continue massaging John’s back, finding and working on another knot. “And if we’re naked, I want to do
end up putting my foot in it?”
... yes...” he rambled, turning his face into the pillow to breathe into and murmur against, too quiet for John to fully understand. He left him to it, hushing and kissing him, his mouth and nose snugly resting at Sherlock’s nape, tasting the sweat speckling his skin.
Hailing down a cab for John, Santa helped him inside and handed the driver a ten pound note, more than enough to get John home, “Goodnight my drunken friend,” he said through the half open window with a wave. “I hope you and Homer find forever happiness.”
? - Surely you don’t need any help from me to--”
but... yeah, I sort of – I love it. - You know, I was unsure about how you'd react, but if you like it then, I can like it too... I guess...”
Sherlock glanced at her as she snapped not one, not two, but three, then four photos, “Do you really need
With a laughing scoff, Sherlock ran a hand through his hair, tugged at the collar of his coat, and then stepped back inside, “No,” he said blankly, shutting the door, leaning against it and smiling a twisted, tensed, hurt, and somewhat condescending smile. It slipped off his face slowly, leaving the man seeming impassive. Greg knew better.
Returning his focus to the present, phantoms images of his desires ebbing away in the back of his mind, John bobbed his head, humming around the head of Sherlock's stiffening cock and resting his tongue against the frenulum. He circled it then with the point of his tongue, before flattening it out and brushing across the sensitive band of tissue in repetitive, teasing waves. Sherlock's length give a warning throb in reaction and John let it fall from his mouth, careful not to let their evening end too soon without the proper relief that Sherlock craved.
“Good man!” John smiled, slapping Greg on the shoulder and then shepherding him into the hallway so he could close the door behind him, keeping the horrid biting wind out.
“Shut up whinging,” John said, rolling his eyes. “Okay er – when did you have your first cigarette? How old were you, I mean?”
," John said with a smirk of his own.
“Any time,” John replied. “
“How is the duck?” Sherlock added, glancing up at her from under his fringe to stealthily regard her joyful and expectant sweeping gaze drop to where they were now pressed from hip to knee. He could feel what was coming and tried not to rise to the bait and meet her eyes proudly.
Sherlock inched back slightly and watched in wonder as John hooked his fingers under the waistband of his underwear and pushed them hurriedly up and over his erection, before taking himself in hand. His penis was darkly flushed and glistening wet, the head red and swollen and leaking profusely.
Greg looked Sherlock over and licked his lips, plainly interested in what was happening though not enough to fully engage, not enough to join in as much as John wanted him to, not yet, “Are you
John felt a pang of sympathy towards him. Greg deserved much better than the cards he’d been dealt, so much better. It was, obviously, one of the main reasons he had asked Mike if Greg could come to the renewal. John had thought that he’d just needed some time with his friends to remind him that he still had them, still had people who cared for him – even if his ex-wife didn't – and to, of course, show him how relationships were meant to be, to open his eyes to the difference of what love really was.
. I hate to admit it, really do, but, yeah. - Did you... want to see? Or...?”
of that,” Sherlock protested, wiping water from his face and pushing his hair back. “And I don’t sound like that—is that how you think I sound?”
“Good, isn't it?” John surged up to messily kiss him, overwhelmed with the sensations. They weren't going to last, neither of them, and it was painfully obvious, yet John continued to push and shove Sherlock, to arch up himself, to get the two of them through the pleasurable clasp of Sherlock's hand. It sent shivery pulses of passionate longing through every nerve, every neuron firing up with a frenzy of desire. “You're
‘Pictures are not enough though. I’ve grown to love you from the stories John tells me, and I can’t wait to meet you. You’ll be the best Christmas present ever!’
“Can I?” Sherlock’s words were soft, his touch hesitant until John’s groan cleared the worried furrow from his forehead.

Sherlock narrowed his eyes but turned and went back to the front door, opening it to leave, “You should invest in a better lock,” he uttered as he left, shooting Lestrade a grin. “On the door
... well, he's... he's..." John flushed from head to toe, cheeks blazing at the connotations of the words and cleared his throat, dragging his index finger through the gathering condensation. He drew a smiley face and watched it cry, watched its upward facing smile drip down. “He's... he's a... he's a bit of
"Do you want to read through everything, or do you want to just sign the papers?" John asked, indicating the forms that had been filled out save for the signature box at the bottom.
He saw John turn to him from the corner of his eye, and for a moment he thought he saw pity, but then John’s arms were pulling him close, his fingers holding his head, his mouth at his ear, “I shouldn’t have said anything.”
John rolled his eyes and picket up another present, “I’m glad you like it, Mrs Hudson—A coat?” John asked, drawing Sherlock’s attention to the dog coat in his hands.
"--I’m
'im,” he continued to whisper, eyes looking up fleetingly to meet Santa's before dropping down to the bar, to the puddle he'd made. “An- not just love, but
. - So you don't want to come with me then? Well, if you're sure?” John asked a final time and stepped towards Sherlock when he made a low snarling grumble of annoyance, brushing their hands together before pushing up onto his toes and giving him an odd embrace, their cheeks sliding warmly together. He hesitated, looking at Sherlock's ear, looking at the glossy curls that half obscured them, and then turned his head to leave a fleeting kiss at his cheek, “How about I bring you back some of that fudge you like? Will that get rid of this sour mood?”
“I told you.”
. He’s not psychic you know.”
He sank into the affection easily and with eager need, arms coming up to encircle about him, plucking at John’s jumper, “Let me see you,” he gasped, sounding close to tears and breathless with emotion. John didn’t fuss or focus on it, knew that Sherlock would react unkindly to such pestering. “John, let me… let me
“I’ll do it,” Sherlock told her, patting her slender shoulder. “Rest those elbows of yours.” She smiled at him and gave his forearm a squeeze.
"So you bought it

“Oh you can keep the slip lead, he
"Alright then," John said, scooping out three healthy sized curls and placing them atop the steaming pudding in the bowl Sherlock held out to him. "Mrs Hudson?"
“John can always get you something. He’s our personal doctor, don’t forget. He can write a prescription for
Mrs Hudson blushed happily and moved to sit at one of the places set with Christmas crackers and champagne flutes, “There’s some bucks fizz in the fridge. Sherlock, would you mind fetching it?”
!” he whined through sharp intakes of breath and choking, overcome sounds of high pleasure. Sherlock wiggled only once, rocking instinctively back on John for more, then became, more or less, malleable and docile. He wanted John to take over, to be in control, to protect him and have him and comfort him and please him. Drive away his ripping thoughts and suffocating feelings with motion, sensation, and love. "Please."
Sherlock wrinkled his nose and turned his head, flitting his eyes away, “Jaded...” he murmured, before he sighed sharply and got up, putting his mug down and heading for the door.
“I should just…say it really,” John muttered when he tucked himself clumsily away. “
“What do you mean, you “can’t”?” John repeated with a frown. “Of course you can. Come here.”
resent it, I don't think badly of you.” Sherlock looked as though he was about to argue a retort, brow crumpled and mouth parting, but John quickly quietened him by pressing his fingers over Sherlock's lips. They were badly chapped from hours of silent sobbing and gnawing, skin pinched in order to muffle. “And I'm sometimes stunned that someone like
As soon as John’s bum touched his seat, Sherlock leant forward, steepling his fingers under his chin, looking at John as if he were some sort of puzzle to be solved. “So. Doctor Watson. Or Captain Watson, whichever you prefer.”
Mycroft shook his head. “Not if you do so under the guise of being his flat mate.”
as comfortable as he thought it would be, especially for someone who hadn’t had much sleep for months …
An unfamiliar twinge took up residence in Sherlock’s gut at the thought that John had called
Blue-green eyes narrowed at John, as if in contemplation. “But
Sherlock’s brow raised in disbelief. “Impossible. That nosy git always tries to insinuate himself into my life. That you are a protector would make him even more determined to try and recruit you.”
John frowned, completely unsettled as he stared at the document. He had just been played, he knew, but the worst part was that he didn’t know exactly
John allowed himself an answering grin before catching up with Sherlock, and together they moved off into the night.
That made John laugh. “To be fair, I’d understand why they would.”
? Whatever for?”
“John, please,” John said, taking a quick, fortifying sip of his whiskey even as he tried to settle for something like patience. “I prefer first names if it could be helped.”
“Then follow me, sir.”
“Showtime,” Greg muttered as they all watched events unfold from their various posts; John could imagine everyone leaning forward to keep a closer eye on their respective assignments, be it government official or any one of the rich and famous that dotted the current landscape. This was, after all, the reason why they were even all here in there first place.
Mrs. Hudson threw up her hands. “Oh, Sherlock, the rent –”
The other man continued speaking as though he had not heard John’s comment, staring at his drink intently. “Although obviously, these things come with the territory. This is not the first time an attempt has been made on my life, but even I have to admit that this was the first time it came so close to being actually successful.” Mycroft Holmes frowned, then looked up to meet John’s eyes. “You’ve seen the files I’ve shared with your team, I hope?”
, but it’s, well, it’s good. You’re
“Well, that would have been a breach of trust,” Mrs Hudson said, heading back to her chair again.
“Meditation,” Sherlock corrected him with a peeved pout.
– bite me?”
“You’re an idiot.”
that. - Please, Sherlock, just... just try and... try and understand it from my point of view. Try to get how difficult this is. How much is on the line and how it would--” John sighed sharply and curled his fingers into Sherlock's shirt, wanting to take it off and press their torsos together, to be naked with him. "I don't want to lose this.
Sitting back in his chair, John considered the question as he took a long swig of beer himself, “I wouldn't say
Sarah’s eyebrow twitched up, unconvinced, “
must you do this? Why must it be a
"You're an idiot," John huffed and, grasping the lapels of Sherlock's dressing gown, pulled him down and pressed his lips to Sherlock's. His entire mind, entire world, stuttered and then exploded with sensation. It was blinding, deafening, and numbing. Everything swirled in a hurricane of information, spreading out, all-encompassing, and then rushing back, all focus on John, his scent, his presence, his breath, and the feeling of his mouth pushing in, engaging, instead of staying dormant, remaining stagnant.
… no it's – fine. It's fine. I, um, I might as well. Because you'll just... sneak up on me when I least expect it,” John told him, knowing his anxious movements said otherwise. He'd chosen then. Perhaps he'd already decided before he'd left the shower? Even so, he couldn't help but worry that this was a truly terrible idea, that all of it was terrible. He was terrible. What was this? What were they? When would his ridiculous feelings for Sherlock subside and break him, break them, make it all explode into jagged, agonising pieces? Why would he quit this? Shoving all thoughts to one side, John took a deep breath, knowing he was going to regret it all when things went sour, when he was left with nothing, and opened his robe, standing there in the traditional flasher pose, showing Sherlock his pants. His stupid elf pants.
After a moment the puppy whined and yipped, and his paws moved in exhilaration,
At that, he reached to open the door further, pushing it just enough to peer inside and huffing a laugh at the view. Sherlock was spread out naked on his bed, head turned towards them, eyes narrowed, mouth pinched and fingers drumming impatiently against his bare torso. He was almost completely erect, the long, flushed, shiny length of his cock resting up against his lower pelvis, delicate foreskin pulled back over the moist head. John took a moment to take in the sight. He was always such a lovely sight, even pouting with a crumpled brow as he was.
!” John hissed, jumping up, tucking himself away, and pulling his robe closed, already feeling the hot shame, the boiling crawl of embarrassment. Like being caught by your mother with your trousers at your ankles. Sherlock, however, didn't seem bothered and didn't move an inch, just threw his arms up above his head and smirked, watching as John collected the recently discarded clothing and rushed through to the kitchen for his own pile. He then dumped it all into the washing hamper and tried to seem nonchalant, tried to look as if he hadn't just had his dick sucked and sprinted around to destroy any evidence.
“She caught your good side too,” John said, bringing his hand up to stroke at Sherlock’s cheek. “Look. You look so… warm.”
,” Sherlock chastised with a quickly formed frown and reached down to take the bird in his hands quickly with an efficiency that came from experience, picking it up and tucking it under his arm like it was nothing more than a fashionable clutch bag. “It is - as I’m sure you are well aware because you aren’t
There were a few more clicks, but they soon ceased and the clank of wood made him aware that the camera being placed on the table, “I think I might make a start on those vegetables,” Mrs Hudson said. “You two stay here.”
Pushing against John's face for a deep enthusiastic kiss, Sherlock snarled at him, “I’ve
Deciding that he couldn't just walk out in the pants and nothing else, John reached for his robe and wrapped it around himself, trying to figure out how he would leave, how he would make his return to Sherlock's side. If he was returning to him. Should he even return? Show him? Wasn't that weird? Wasn't this entire situation weird, his whole life? If he came out, robe on, trying to play coy and get back to his room, it would only cause interest, only bring Sherlock to him, make him stalk after, and he wanted to show him, wanted to get it out of the way quickly, going out coyly would be extra strange. He was a thirty year old GP, not a burlesque performer. If he acted confident, if he just walked through to get to his room or, if he went through with showing Sherlock, letting him win and drop his robe, standing proud, that wouldn't work either, that would be equally as strange. Rubbing his face, John choose to just go. Just go for it, whatever it was, whatever he wanted once he stepped out. He had no idea what he was in for in terms of Sherlock's reaction to either decision, but he needed to bite the bullet. He couldn't really stay and hide in the bathroom forever.
"You like vanilla though," John said, giving him a friendly nudge.
“I played a lot in the army, I'm not the complete
the time…”
“Says the man clinging onto false hope that his cheating wife has any ounce of respect left for him,” Sherlock muttered with an edge to his tone and a sideways glare as he turned his head away.
clear whenever you send me across the room for something you could get yourself.”
“Not at first anyway,” John agreed.
“Yeah. It’s good, right? New and shockingly human for such a brilliant, otherworldly man,” John said breathlessly, watching Sherlock squirm happily at the compliment. Every thrust of his fingers stimulated Sherlock now, pushing him ever closer to orgasm, as John’s other hand teased out an abrupt and copious amount of pre-come. It dribbled across Sherlock's lower abdomen, curving over his waist and down to the covers below. John momentarily berated himself for not making sure there was something other than the bedspread to catch the mess. “If I still wanked as regularly as I used to, I would use this sound time and time again.”
He felt John shift a little under him again, but this time John’s nose brushed against his scalp and Sherlock rose and fell with John’s deep, inhaling breath. It was incredibly soothing and shockingly intimate. John was taking in his scent, was breathing him in, was indulging in their closeness, in the permission to do as he pleased, as he wanted, as he needed. He didn’t say anything, he just breathed and held him and let Sherlock settle into him. Of course, Mrs Hudson soon made her reappearance, breaking the atmosphere and popping their personal, tender bubble of devotion.
“Tell me what he knows. What training has he had?” Sherlock questioned.
, alright? The case is over, we can just... go home and do what we always do."
“I’d like three scoops,” Sherlock told him as he cut into the pudding, making sure each slice was the same, or as close as he could manage giving his concentration being split, being taken, by a hovering, lovely smelling, fondly smiling John.
“Everyone does,” Sherlock sighed as he took John’s weight and heaved him further, holding him in a brief, warm, glorious hug before he reached down to push at his loosened trousers. More kisses were laid on John's skin, enough to make him quiver, and Sherlock hummed, sucking at the hinge of his jaw. “Do something useful and step out of them, would you?”
Grumbling unhappily under his breath, John walked through the kitchen door and looked for Sherlock, surprised he hadn’t heard the man yelling the first moment he’d come home. There was no sign of him however, nothing but more of the mistletoe, which hung above the glass door leading into the corridor, on the border between kitchen and living room, and in the centre of the living room, hanging from one of the light fixtures. It was slightly ridiculous. It was overkill. It was frankly, quite mortifying, especially as John thought he knew what Mrs Hudson was trying to do. Something he should have known would happen, sooner or later.
Slumping against the wall, Sherlock took a few shaky, inhales and glanced down at himself, drawing John’s eyes to the very obvious damp, dark patch at the front of his creased dress trousers, visible even in the low light, “These are quite expensive…” he said in a low complaining tone, the only sentence he’d been able to structure so far without stuttering. Sherlock reached down, seconds away from touching, but then must have thought better of it, as he rubbed at his thighs instead with a cough, fingers curling self-consciously. "I only just bought them last weekend--"
A deep voice to his left startled John out of his reverie; belatedly he realised that he had been staring at the same spot since he had found a quiet, shadowed space in a recessed window seat, just off the main ballroom floor. He turned to see a tall man who was now sitting beside him, blue-green eyes intense. “I’m – what? Sorry?”
John paused in front of 221 Baker Street, checking the small slip of paper that he held in his hand to make sure he had got the correct address. It wasn’t a hard place to find; the Jubilee Line was quite handy, and the door was very clearly marked with brass numbers, gleaming dully against the dark paint.
John smiled in surprise. “Of course it is. Bloody brilliant.”
John came to a stop in front of his target room, looking around to see if the reinforcements that Lestrade had sent in were anywhere to be found. Finding no one else in the corridor, John tentatively put an ear to the door’s surface to try and discern the conversation within; he heard a few terse unintelligible mumblings, and then a female voice, high and hoarse with fear, said clearly: “Please, for the love of God, I’m telling you – we are not who you think we are!”
“Yes. That’s how flat shares work, don’t they? We split the rent, and it would, in turn, allow me to use the other half of what I usually pay Mrs. Hudson to cover 221C.”
“Roger on that,” John replied, putting on a burst of speed that he knew he would pay for later in terms of leg pain, but Greg’s inability to track one of the occupants of the room he had specified told him enough.
Sherlock shrugged again. “In which case, it wouldn’t have been a problem, at least not for me.”
