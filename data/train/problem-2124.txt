John frowned warmly his way and cocked his head an inch to the side in question, and, gaining a bit of unyielding courage, he lifted an arm to wrap it gently around the boy’s waist, pulling him even closer and noting how pink instantly turned to red.
Please do not fret because this story has an ending planned out already and it is going to be finished.
Silence hung between the two of them, besides the ever-present chirping of nearby birds, the chatter of people resounding from the district's center square, and the sniffles emanating from their mother sauntering patiently behind them.
. He swallowed a bit nervously and turned to the boy in the driver’s seat, of whom looked back, expression wistful and a bit shy. The two had gotten quite a bit done on their annoyingly exhausting Literature paper, and Sherlock had even managed to say a goodbye and a thorough thank you to both Harry and John’s mother, as Harry arrived home and John’s mother left for work.
Sherlock spun, and spun and spun and spun, his body whirling, and his mind following suit, emotions clattering against the forefront of his brain with every spin, flailing, shattering loose, as though the very dance was breaking the mask, breaking the walls, letting it all tumble outward.
He spent the rest of his night pondering, and worrying; thinking about Sherlock, about his mostly horrid friends, about new video ideas, about his channel in general - he brainstormed and considered new things and did every bit of it with theballetbee’s compositions on shuffle.
“Christ,” John snorted, rolling his eyes and shaking his head at Sebastian Wilkes and his utter success at managing to be the biggest dickhead the world had ever seen.
to say sorry. It was grating on him, nagging at his brain, sending him into a nervous frenzy. His guilt tolerance was at its utmost — if he hadn’t told Sherlock to wait for him would he be in pain right now? Would Sebastian have still found him? Would things have happened
To those who subscribed to his channel – to them? To them, he was the mysterious, graceful, musically talented stranger – he was an enigma, a puzzle never to be solved, a mask never to be removed. And he liked it that way – so that’s the way it would stay.
“Body parts,” The genius spat back at him, placing the cigarette between his pink lips, even more rosy from the rain, and lifting his lighter, tucked in his opposite hand, to the end, flicking the switch somewhat desperately, the flame flickering and stuttering uselessly.
Sometimes Sherlock wished he was a dog, then, at least, he wouldn't have to worry about the stupid games or other hateful people. He could just…be.
Sherlock struggled to keep his own cheeks from reddening and turned away, chewing on his bottom lip to keep from beaming brightly back at the boy sitting in front of him, because regardless of how nervous he was to attend some party, his first in years, he would be with John, and any minute of any day spent with John was time well spent.
He blinked, frowned and then moved to open his mouth, turning back to her, curious as to why she was pushing the subject, as to why she was even throwing the idea out there, but his eyes caught sight of John and Greg approaching and suddenly his heart was thumping loudly in his ears and his breath had caught tightly in his throat.
“Enjoying the party so far?” Molly yelled over the music, her grin contagious, her hands resting in front of her with all the aura of an overly excited toddler.
At that, he turned back around and unlocked his dormitory, kicking the door open with his foot and glancing over his shoulder at the new boy.
John let out a frustrated huff, before realizing just where he was; Ms. Montgomery’s eyes dropped to his slouched form, and within mere moments he was fixed with her god-awful glare, eyes wide open, brows lifted in challenge, lips puckered in annoyance. He quickly shot her an attentive smile, lifted his hand in a gesture for her to continue, and flipped haphazardly through his playbook. She scowled, shot him a nod in warning, and went back to her arduous lecture.
John let out a long yawn and plummeted down onto his bed’s navy duvet, holding the planet pillow to his chest and staring up at his ceiling, pondering quietly to himself, picturing Sherlock in his clothes, imagining the boy halfway out of his sopping wet clothes, cold and ruffled, imperfect for once, when he normally looked immaculate. He let out a deep sigh and shook his head at his thoughts, at himself, at his need and desire for a boy so very untouchable.
“Holy shit!” John laughed brightly, positively beaming now, as he glanced up to meet Sherlock’s eyes.
At the mention of those two idiotic lovers, Sherlock felt his face heat up once again with shame, the thoughts of that morning’s dream rising to his attention, and he carefully avoided John’s eyes as he scoffed softly to himself, “Really?”
John stormed across the field; irritation and anger from earlier events still making his ears ring, still running his temperature high, still making his palms sweat with rage. He had no right. No
Siger was right. He was late. But that's what happens when you're eager to film a new video in the school's ballet studio and the walk home takes thirty minutes.
Sherlock scoffed, shrugging the hand off and hoisting his satchel back to its proper position on his arm, whilst the boy simply ignored his offensive attitude and knelt down to begin re-stacking his records in their crowded box-home.
“You could come get it, you know!” Harry spat out, and then, softly, more quietly, mumbled, "Lazy arse.”
Rosie flopped down on her father, and tried to make herself as big as possible. Her small 5’2’’ frame barely covered any of her Papa’s looming 6’ frame. “You said you’d do this with me,” Rosie whined a bit. “Don’t make me tell Nanny Hudders that you-”
John nodded his head, and left the kitchen to stand in the doorway between the kitchen and living room. John quietly watched his husband sway and play around the room. His bow moving in precise movements, and the cord from his large headsets to his instrument swinging in his wake. John slightly cleared his voice, and Sherlock turned to make eye contact with him.
“Our client is e-mailing us information. Rosie, if you want to check the laptop and left us know when the e-mail comes.”
John heard Rosie’s excited footfall before he saw either of them. Rosie ran right into the office and hugged John’s legs. “Hi Daddy!”
Ella shifted in her seat, and pulled out John’s note file. “When you started, you stated you were single, straight, and lonely. How would you describe yourself now?”
“Myc,” Greg groaned. “Stop trying to run your brother’s life. He’s going to resent you if- No this is ‘Lock.
“She had just delivered again when I left the base last time. She ended up married to one of the guys.”
“They brought my ex up. They asked why I left him.” Sherlock said, not turning to look at his brother.
“I don’t have to stay,” the man was saying, as he walked into the room. “I’d love to make you breakfast. I make killer pancakes-”
“So you’re not fucking yet. Got it. You always had a type, Watson. Tall, dark, handsome.” Moran laughed, as he set the intact uterus aside for proper disposal. “You prefer the loud blokes. You know the ones - so flamboyant it hurts. Of course they all worship Dr. Watson and his giant cock—
“I’ve got eyes, brother mine. I can see how handsome he is.” Greg smiled. “You better marry him before someone else does--”
Sherlock dug through his mind palace to place the reference and laughed out loud as his mind replayed the scene in question.   “No, I don’t think I’ll be that detached.”
“You’re not ready to have actual intercourse, and that’s ok. When I need to get filled, I have toys…”
The growl started deep within ‘Lock, and rumbled out across the room. John chuckled, placing a little kiss on ‘Lock’s throat. “I haven’t thought about it.”
Moran shook his head, and led the way out of the room. John bumped into Sherlock’s hip gently, and grinned up at him. “That was incredible. How do you do it?”
“You horrid, ruinous child!” Sherlock jabbed her. “You know that weed slows me down worse than food!”
John laughed, and grabbed the biscuits and his coffee before he walked over to the table. He slid into the seat and opened the laptop. John took a sip of coffee, then logged onto the laptop. John grinned to himself as he ran his fingers over the biscuits. John quickly lost himself in his e-mail, but continued to protect the sleeve of biscuits.
“I’m sorry, baby,” John said, pulling her into his arms. She groaned, and returned the hug. John clung to her, and gently kissed the top of her head.
John nodded, beaming, as the door to the room was flung open. Mycroft entered dragging Sherlock by his ear. “I told you, this is a high security facility. Any and all attempts to break in are ended before they can truly begin.” Tossing his gangly brother into a nearby chair, Mycroft walked over to his husband. “Hello, husband mine.”
Rosie let John go, and went over to Sherlock’s face. She pressed her two hands on either side of Sherlock’s cheeks.  “What about Syph!?” she asked, urgently.
“I thought you handled this,” Sherlock demanded of his brother as he bounced the little girl on his hip.
Sherlock entered the room, and settled into the chair next to Greg. Reflexively, Greg reached out and took his hand. He used his other hand to pat it reassuringly. “Glad you’re here, ‘Lock.” he murmured, and nodded at Dr. Watson’s murmured words. “I’m ready whenever you are, doc.” Greg smiled was strained. He looked to John, who nodded.
“John, are you going to be anxious until you know what the answer is?” ‘Lock asked, as he steepled his fingers and rested his chin.
Sherlock turned John’s words over in his mind, before he said softly. “It sounds like a compliment.”
“Papa!” Rosie Watson shouted, as she stomped down from her bedroom. “It’s time to make some bread!” The alarm on her phone beeped loudly, and she waved it at him.
Greg laughed softly as he lay on the hospital bed. “What a great adventure! Homeless with triplets.”
Rosie nodded her head, and grabbed Sherlock’s hand. “Come on, Papa. It’s time to go wait for Aunt Molly.”
John stared at the phone in disbelief and tucked it into his pocket with a note of finality before he went back to the funeral parlor. He cleared his throat, and said loudly, “Sorry, folks. It’s time to go…” John’s family looked at him in shock, but his expression remained emotionless. “Rosie and I need-”
John placed the tray down and sat down in his favorite armchair. “Rosie, you are being a silly girl right now.”
“So no more of this ‘I’m broken’ nonsense. You’re healing. You’re fighting for your future. You’re working to make a future with me,” John shook his head, then added, “And before you start on the ‘my Omega is going to leave me because I won’t fuck him.’  Stop. I know you’re mine. You’re my Alpha, and if that means we don’t have sex for the first ten years of us, I’m ok with that. I don’t expect you to fuck me because you think it’s time.” John brushed curls off ‘Lock’s forehead, before he leaned in and rested his own against his Alpha’s. “I expect you to fuck me when it feels good for you. When you’re ready.”
John’s eyes swept around the room, systematically ignoring the majority of the aged photos until he saw one of two young boys with their arms slung around each other. John moved over to it, and picked it up.
John sighed, and mentally counted his fingers. “You are not so good at your job, and I am amazing at mine.”
“Of course you did. You’ve been over there pressing all the buttons and- John. Are you going to focus on this application forever?”
John pulled away, and held his chest in jest. “This is it! The myocardial infarction that’ll end me-”
“Greg Holmes, nice to meet you.” Greg struggled to hold out his hand to shake the nurse’s. Moran walked over to Greg, and stood off to the side. He had a firm, confident handshake.
He could see Greg standing behind the flight attendant. He looked him over, then smiled in glee at his husband. “Gregory Holmes, what kind of hour do you call this?”
It wasn’t hours later, or even days later, that John and Sherlock were reunited. It was three weeks, five days, seven hours later, but John was there. He fought to free Sherlock, and as soon as they were to safety, John reacted the way you think he would. He tended to Sherlock’s wounds, then gave him a proper chewing out that ended with the two of them making out while professing their affections and apologizing at the same time.
“I just didn’t want to rush anything.” John said into the Sherlock’s mouth. “We spent so long getting here, I didn’t want to mess it up by-“
“Well,” he coughed, facing the wall. “I’m going to have a kip. Don’t want to pass out during my next shift, that wouldn’t bode well for me or my patients.” He turned to Mycroft. “You have me beeper number –so um, beep me if anything happens.” He looked at Sherlock, who hadn’t moved. “Eat.” John pointed at the untouched chocolate bar.
“Oh,” John said, huffing a laugh. “My sister-in-law is setting me up and I think Irene thought Clara was asking her out, not me—or for me, really. It’s confusing.”
John took the insult with a grain of salt, loving that Sherlock was so vocal with his declarations of love.
John knocked on the door but when there was no reply he pushed the door open slightly, only to be almost hit by an empty IV bag.
“Haircut, mostly, and the way you hold yourself but you know what truly gave it away?” The man lifted his non-vomit-smeared hand and pulled out John’s dog tags from beneath his shirt. “You’re jingling.”
“There you are,” said a well-dressed man, wielding an umbrella like a weapon. “Do I have to lock you up or are you going to stop escaping?”
“Sarcasm doesn’t become you, gorgeous.” He kissed Sherlock’s cheek and pulled the microscope back to its place.
“So,” John said, taking a sip of tea. “I heard that Greg brought you over some cases. Still wanna’ be a detective, huh?”
He watched Will have a heated conversation with one of the chefs in what sounded like fluent Mandarin and came back with a plate of garlic fried vegetables and a plastic bag of prawn crackers.
John sat in Mycroft’s fairly large kitchen, the man himself sitting across from John and a heavyset woman pouring them tea and serving them bite-size choc-chip muffins.
So, John had to thank his sister-in-law Clara for this apparent stand up, as she was the one who both thought that all his “relationships” (ie, his quick hook-ups) weren’t healthy and that he and her friend Sarah would be perfect for each other.
“Distancing myself. With murders, they are already dead and all I can do for them is solve it.” He took a shuddering breath. “But when they’re alive…I have a chance to help them, save them.” He took another wet breath, sounding on the verge of sobbing. “And when they’re children, who have done nothing wrong, their only crimes their parentage and their innocence. What’s the point? I don’t get the rush, the giddiness of a case, all I feel is empty.”
It occurred to John then that he was flirting with a stranger in a darken alley and he could feel that familiar rush of adrenaline flood his veins.
“So, John,” Irene said, forcing John’s gaze upwards. She leant forward on her elbows, resting her chin in the cradle of her hands. She raised a perfectly arched brow. “How do you know Clara?”
He took Sherlock’s, frankly ridiculous, cheekbones between his hands and placed several quick pecks to Sherlock’s lips before settling down with a long, deep kiss, feeling the other man’s lips smile and puck up in an innocent attempt to reciprocate.
John sighed, and stood up, pulling his jumper and undershirt over his head and kicking his trousers off.
John stopped, pleased with his work, a relaxed and happy Sherlock between his legs and dropped the towel over the side of the bed.
The man took a shaky breath and didn’t look at John, instead thumping the side of the vending machine with a closed fist.
John was quite shocked. The man said it with such indifference. As bad and stereotyping as it was, John could normally pin point any drug addict but this man didn’t seem the type.
Mycroft, Greg, the nameless woman, and the big, suited man were all there, surrounding Sherlock who, for the first time that John’s known him, was dressed in something other than his ratty sweatpants.
She sat down slowly and John pushed her chair in. He sat down in his seat fast enough to watch Irene rearrange her cleavage, giving a show to everyone watching.
John was sitting in the canteen trying to choke down what was apparently lasagne and lukewarm tea when Stamford came barrelling towards him.
“It’s easier with murders,” Sherlock said, interrupting John from peeling his underwear away from his crotch to make himself more comfortable.
It was the server from inside and he looked just as hypnotic in the light of the many neon signs around them then he did inside.
It didn’t take the men long to get back into their groove, both men able to move and live around each other like it was a second nature, but both felt a different vibe than before.
“As much as I enjoy hearing about your impending departure to the Middle East,” Sherlock said, pulling John back to the bedroom. “I have something else in mind.”
When Detective Inspector Lestrade came over to 221B to get both men’s statements and give them his congratulations of a case well solved, he was rudely told to bugger off by one Sherlock Holmes and a well-thrown leather brogue.
“Thank you, John. I feel like you’re the only one who sees Sherlock and not just Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective.”
John nodded and sat back, subtly looking around for Will. There was something in Irene’s body language and tone that he didn’t like.
John gave in, sliding down next to him, checking his pulse and his temperature once again before letting go and studying the man’s face.
John checked his watch. It had gone past ten, which probably meant Sherlock’s doctor had long gone home. He wasn’t about to follow Sherlock’s psychiatrist home just to yell at him.
Only this time, the copycat abductor was slow and Sherlock was on his a-game, finding the missing children and the kidnapper in three hours, all children alive and well.
John sighed and peaked his eyes open to find Sherlock with his knees up against his chest, his wet head resting on his knees, his body one complete slump.
“So,” John said, trying to steer the conversation to one less…chest-achingly awkward. “How you know Clara?”
“Tell me,” Will said, sauntering up to John, tucking a cigarette behind his ear. “Do your family not know you at all? Or are they hoping that your taste in women has changed?”
There was a loud thump from upstairs, followed by the unmistakable sound of bedsprings and the detective hightailed it out there while the landlady smiled up at the ceiling and left to have lunch at the café next door.
John left the Psych Ward and made his way back up to paediatrics, stopping for a cold and stale sandwich from the forth floor vending machine, Sherlock a permanent worry in the back on his mind.
Of course, all of this came to a head when a small child, the only viable witness to a pretty gruesome homicide, sneezed on Sherlock and left him sick with the stomach flu.
Huffing a breath, John gave both him and his date five more minutes until he conceded and went home, out of the cold November air to binge watch old
John removed both of his hands and stood up, fixing the sheet around his friend and turned off the light, and turn to check on Sherlock once more.
“Well, I should head out. My break ends soon and I’m starving. It’s good to see you’re better and… real.”
The kitchen door flung open so hard that it chipped at the paint on the wall, revealing a washed, dressed Sherlock.
When Sherlock entered the living room, looking pale and dishevelled but very much better, John stood up and walked over to his best friend.
“Excuse me?” John said, walking towards the man who, as John got closer, was shaking quite servery and sweating feverishly. “Are you okay?”
John followed him into the kitchen, where Will sat him down at a small table crammed in between a pantry and a stainless steel bench.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and made his way towards the lifts. He leant heavily against the wall as he scoffed.
John watched the houses pass, each one seemingly bigger than the last, feeling more out of place each time the letter box numbers rose.
John watched him go, mesmerised by the length of the man’s legs and the way the curve of his arse fit into the black material of his trousers.
After five hours sleep and a quick coffee, John was delivering the good news to the McKinley’s that Josephine’s lung cyst was treatable and after a good cry session or two and multiple hugs from both parents and patient, John decided to spend his break in the Psych Unit, looking for Sherlock.
The server looked John up and down before flitting his gaze towards Sarah. He looked back at John and gripped tightly at the notepad in his hands.
It was one of his rare days off and he was going to murder, then bring back to life (he was a doctor, he couldn’t help it) and then murder again the person knocking at his door.
He gave both of them another quick look before walking over to the window that looked into the kitchen.
Mycroft just sat there; reading today’s paper, completely oblivious with John’s internal debate with the pros and cons of slamming his head against the table.
John wasn’t going to leave him alone but he knew he had to be strategic when it came to helping this man.
“Despite what many think, including yourself, mind,” John said, nudging him slightly. “You are more than your brilliant, beautiful mind and you are not a emotionless machine. You care and that was makes you such a great detective.”
John learned that Sarah’s specialty was in paediatrics and worked at a practice quite close to John’s flat. She enjoyed reading British classics, painting, gardening and was a Capricorn.
The man lifted one thin, frail wrist and John watched the plastic hospital band slide down his pale forearm.
“No,” John chuckled. He didn’t really want to talk about his womanizing ways in front of the man he really, really wanted to shag.
John checked Sherlock admittance time. He had only been checked in about an hour before John found him.
The man took a slow drag of his cigarette and slowly blew the smoke out away from John, his eyes never straying.
The chef struggled in John’s hands and he tightened his grip, alerting the Inspector of his presence.
“Mycroft went to go get me something, or he just wanted an excuse not to be around Lestrade. One night stands do tend to make things a bit awkward.”
Will and the chef spat at each other in harsh Mandarin and after something Will said tartly, the man lunged swinging the knife towards Will.
He followed Mycroft into a large foyer, seeing more silk and mahogany wood in that single room than he ever thought he would ever see in his life.
“You’re on the lowest dose of buprenorphine possible and you’re not showing anymore withdrawal symptoms, unless you count irritability, but I’m coming to think that you’re just irritable by nature.” He gave Sherlock a grin, letting him know he was kidding. “They’ll probably want to keep you in here for a few more days, just to make sure you’re not dependant on anything new or likely to relapse which means you’re probably going to have to stay with a reliable friend or family member for a while.” He gave Sherlock a sympathetic smile, as he knew how much Sherlock detested his brother. “But nevertheless, you’re free.”
“What kind of name is that?” Sebastian Moran snapped, arching a brow in curiosity and staring down at the YouTube channel displayed on John’s mobile screen.
Victor grabbed his shoulders and slammed him harder against the shelves with a snarl, the thick, pointy edges of wood digging into Sherlock's shoulder blades, "Shut the fuck up, Sher. You know the rules."
Sherlock was shaken out of his thoughts by the vibration of his phone, the soft buzz pulling him from a memory he both longed to remember simply to hear John’s voice, and yet despised to think of; the way he’d reacted, the way he’d been so very out of his depth to judge and yet he had anyway.
Saturday afternoon had him sprawled out on his bed, and groaning up at the ceiling in utter frustration, his heart thrumming wildly in his chest as his mind thought over the events of the night, body fidgeting, eager and on edge.
Molly smiled timidly and nodded, slipping away and back into the dressing room to remove the dress, sliding the curtain across behind her.
might be. It was all a lot to handle and, truly, he just needed a day to sort himself, and everything else, out.
Sherlock inhaled deeply, eyes fluttering just slightly, shoulders tightening expectantly and body shivering at the warmth of John’s skin pressing against the cold surface of his cheek. But instead of pressing his lips to Sherlock’s, John lifted his chin and let his mouth brush against the surface of his forehead, and Sherlock swears he’s never been treated with as much love as this in all his lifetime.
John was aware Sherlock probably didn't trust him, but he’d prove to him his intentions were purely innocent.
"No one," Victor spat and glared at the boy in his arms with bright green eyes, the emerald hue on fire, burning with warning, "Absolutely no one can know. Got it?"
“You’re an idiot,” Sherlock smiled, rolling his eyes and turning to look out the window at London rushing. A part of Sherlock knew he was right; he’s not sure he could’ve kept it a secret from him in the long run, not when his heart felt like it would rip from his chest at the idea of lying to John Watson. But of course, he couldn’t simply
With a rather dark grin, he pointed at the camera lens and arched a brow, “You know what they call our rugby coach behind his back?”
Realizing he needed to thank someone, Sherlock glanced over at Harry and beamed shyly, expression soft and polite as he bobbled his head gratefully — to which she returned the gesture with a warm smile of her own.
John swallowed then, gazing thoroughly into those kaleidoscopes, admiring every flicker of color, the shade close to the cyan waves of the Mediterranean, exotic and surreal and utterly breathtaking. He lifted one of his hands to slide his fingers along Sherlock’s jawbone, feeling the way the boy gasped slightly at the touch, the way his pulse picked up pace, and how his throat moved as he quickly swallowed. John smiled warmly, the same smile he knew Sherlock found calming, settling, reassuring, and watched as the brunette closed his eyes and exhaled long and slow, leaning into the palm of John’s hand until he was properly cupping the sharp edge of Sherlock’s pale cheek.
John smiled to himself and reached for the hem of his shirt, lifting the material up off his head and frowning thoughtfully; the two boys continued to undress and redress for their practice without interruption — at least until Sebastian Wilkes, Sebastian Moran and James Sholto came striding into the locker room, heads held high and permanent sneers across their hardened faces. John instantly ducked his head and rolled his eyes, patience already wearing thin, reminding himself not to let some plonker like Wilkes ruin his perfect day. He glanced over at Greg, noting how frustrated his friend looked as he shoved his school clothes aside, lips drawn significantly downwards.
“So, get this,” he continued, “Coffee can actually prevent cirrhosis of the liver. You know cirrhosis, yeah? Bad stuff, nasty stuff. Basically chronic liver damage, which, in turn, leads to liver failure.”
“We’re just friends,” He murmured, lifting his chin slightly, the very words leaving his tongue feeling false and toxic.
And now his sanity was buried six feet deep beneath sand, and dirt and bits of grass, all tangled up in roots, wiry wooden ropes holding his coffin to the Earth, suffocating the entirety of who he was and who he would never be again.
Wilkes leaned back in mock hurt and glanced over at Sholto and Moran, pouting teasingly and placing his hand atop his heart, looking as though he’d just been slapped by his mother.
John nodded blankly, and swallowed the knot forming in his throat, his brow creasing and his hands somehow reaching upward to pause YouTube’s ‘autoplay’ feature, eager to sit in silence and contemplate what had just fluttered across his eyes.
And he was, in fact, correct. Because when he turned back around, glancing at the toilet seat where John had been sitting, the army doctor was gone.
“If you haven’t already,” Sherlock muttered under his breath, and tired not to focus on how very enchanting a sassy, sarcastically confident John Watson just happened to be.
“Nonsense,” Irene slurred, slithering over to her and resting her elbow atop one of Molly’s small shoulders, “You can’t
had told him off for an experiment gone wrong, or simply his experiments in general — eyeballs in the sugar, toes lying in baggies behind cans of tomato soup, fingernails atop the counter.
He flew to his feet, his phone tumbling out of his pocket at the force of the movement, and, in one stupid, frazzled decision, he reached for it, only to feel hands colliding with his shoulders so forcefully he was on the ground once more, this time on his side — winded, out of breath, and feeling entirely, painfully bruised. He glanced up at the four boys towering brutally over him, their sneers unnerving, their eyes sparkling with so much adrenaline Sherlock felt his fingers beginning to tremble, and his legs beginning to shake.
at you,” John informed him, and Sherlock burst into a melody of ridiculously high-pitched giggles, trying desperately to muffle them with his hand, shaking his curls so much so that they bounced atop his forehead.
Sherlock beamed back and nodded, swallowing thickly and turning back to John, his mouth opening as though he were about to say something else, something more, when a petite, mousy voice called out their names over the booming beat of a song John recognized to be by The Clash, the crowd of dancers on the floor moving their hips wildly to the tune and a few singing along reverently.
“Is this what you do in your free time?” James interrogated in amusement, expression frighteningly teasing, “Watch some queer tiptoe around a studio, and play sad violin songs?”
“Sure about that?” Coach the Roach interrogated, arching a thick brow and leaning down further into John’s personal space, “You’re team captain, Watson. Get your shit together, yeah?”
"Sorry," John chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck a little awkwardly, "Didn't mean to scare you."
Turning away from the boy, Sherlock pressed his back against the counter and hummed to himself, biting his lip and toying with an idea in his head. He obviously knew already — hell, he’d met Harry’s girlfriend. But, clearly, John was ashamed of how his father saw things, and Sherlock took it as a sign to be honest, to be open, to slowly admit something small but important, something he wasn’t sure John knew yet or not, what with how many people spread it about the school as though it were their secret to tell.
Instead of a proper answer, of something John could work with, help with, Sherlock merely gazed down, grabbed his jumper sleeve and yanked it completely and utterly over the entirety of his pale limb, only his fingertips peaking out of the black fabric, before he turned away and out the window, throat bobbing while he swallowed.
? He was so tired of simple-minded youths, their eyes judging and perceptive, every move of someone different posing as some sort of threat to their very reputation. Was it so very bad to be original these days? Unique?
Molly snorted and shook her head, linking her arm with his and strolling beside him, a small, friendly but eager smile across her warm, lightly powdered features, “I’m only curious.”
“You won’t get anywhere by lying to yourself, you tit,” Irene sighed, rolling her eyes and taking another large sip of her colorful drink, red nails blending in with the bright red shade of the plastic cup, now half empty as she lifted it away from her lips. “Look,” She began, turning her body to stand directly in front of Sherlock, her hip jutting out, all curves and sharp edges, intimidatingly feminine, so much so that Sherlock nearly took a fleeting step backward. “Don’t wait around for John
“I don’t get an answer then?” John smiled, itching the back of his neck and then leaning forward to take a rather small bite of his school lunch.
“We can stop by yours first,” John said warmly, before glancing at the boy to shoot him a quick smile, only to notice the panicked expression suddenly melting his look of disdain, fear in his multi-colored eyes and the corners of his mouth downturned.
Sherlock swallowed, stopped walking and stared down at his heavy clothes, taking in the state of his drenched shoes, his wet duffle bag, noting the feeling of each and every hair sticking to the sides of his cheekbones and forehead, the burning of his eyes, and after a few seconds, he sighed and ducked his head. “
“You need anything?” John beamed politely, expression open and curious, waiting as Sherlock stared back, still somewhat incredulous, a part of his brain desperately trying to keep up with the fact that John was here, real, being kind, and talking to him like he was worth something.
Deep down, however, as much as he hated to admit it, it was John Watson’s opinion he held above all the rest.
John beamed at the sound and let out a soft sigh, dropping his palms down from Sherlock’s cheeks to clutch his hands, intertwining their fingers, John so careful and gentle that Sherlock continued to feel as though he were made of porcelain.
“Mind the mess,” John chuckled and extended a hand kindly, inviting Sherlock inside as he slowly closed the door behind them.
Molly made a skeptical, throaty noise and went back to her painting, though she still remained slightly tilted toward him, as though she weren’t completely finished with her good-natured accusations.
“Right, what’s eating you then?” She asked, looking at him with a rather concerned yet amused gaze, her features light and open aside from her furrowed brow.
John shook his head at himself and huffed, turning up the volume of the video and sighing, grabbing his backpack and pulling out his math homework, scribbling nonsense the best he could into the answer blanks of questions, all the while swaying to the soft melody of a carefully practiced violin and spotting the blur of black and pink in his peripheral vision, dancing with grace across his computer screen.
“John really enjoys it,” Molly went on, sighing contently to herself and letting out a soft chuckle, “he secretly likes the competitiveness of it all, I think.” She leaned back against the tree, mirroring Sherlock’s own seating arrangement and glancing at him, a smile broad on her face.
Sherlock leaned downward, reaching for the flannel that would complete his horrid outfit for today's mandatory occasion, dragging the itchy fabric over his lean torso. He wasn't anything nice to look at, or, at least, that's how he saw himself.
“Wait here after the game?” He asked, hope tilting his tone upwards, his gut sweeping slightly, eager to see more of the boy, to spend more time with the boy, to thank the boy properly for even bothering to come out on such a chilly, ordinary day.
John snorted and glanced up, spotting the curly-haired mop of hair just over the top of the old, roughed-up vehicle and rounding its scratched and slightly dented frame to reveal the tall figure of Sherlock Holmes, leaning back against the car’s window in his Converse, skinny jeans and tight-fitting, white button-down.
He collapsed to the ground, landing on his knees with bruising force and hugging his arms around his chest, placing his forehead to the floor of the ballet studio, and breathing shakily inward. He felt his teeth grinding, his eyes fluttering shut, his heart thumping unsteadily, his legs trembling with exhaustion, his ribs protesting in their already fragile state, and his mind — his
“John, John.” Sherlock said, pulling him from his tirade. “It’s okay.” He pressed another small kiss to John’s lips and moved his hands to interlace behind John’s neck. “While I am not ready to go all the way-“
His cigarette hung out of his mouth so nonchalantly, as if he didn’t just completely astound and stump John.
“No, you don’t,” Sherlock said, pulling at John’s pants. “I set the alarm to go off an hour earlier.”
John gave him a look and the man heaved himself up, away from John and towards the double glass doors that accessed the balcony.
John helped Sherlock to bed, laying him on his side facing the door, a bucket beside him, just in case.
This was one of the best hospitals in London, so John was used to dealing with posh and ill prats but he had never come across one quite like this.
The detective hesitated in the hallway, expecting foul play but understood his need to leave when a high-pitched whimper came from behind the (now) closed door.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and cocked his head, looking too innocent and cute for John to handle this early.
He and Sherlock just stared at each other for a bit until John had to look away, an unwanted confession about to spill out of his mouth if he kept staring into Sherlock’s green eyes.
Somehow, John would have felt more comfortable if Mycroft turned out to be a mafia king or something less likely to ruin John’s medical or military career in an instance if something bad happened between him and Sherlock.
“Not really. Your family are worried that you are in your thirties, unattached and you find it hard to date due to your job, so they decided to force you into what is basically an interview for these women’s future husband, or in Irene’s case: wife, to see if one will stick.”
They were nearing closer to the end of the hallway, a large window waiting for at the end. John tried not to imagine himself jumping out of it.
The poor waitress who gave them their menus and refilled their water looked traumatized and John tried not to laugh when Molly attempted to apologise.
They stood outside a large wooden door, a tray of sandwiches and iced tea waiting outside, untouched.
“Ever since he was released, he’s been miserable. Locking himself away, not eating, scaring away my staff and hoarding my entire collection of tea cups,” Mycroft said, breaking the silence. “I thought it was the absence of drugs or stimulation, so I asked Gregory to dig up some cold cases for him but even that didn’t work.”
“But I haven’t even touched you,” Sherlock said incredulously, taking John hands and heaving himself up.
“I won’t do anything you don’t want.” John said, keeping his voice soft and his hands where Sherlock could see them. “I want to dress you, okay?”
‘Well,” Sarah said, drawing John’s attention back to his date and the possible chance of getting laid and away from the not-Chinese server.  “I’m thinking chicken. You?”
Greg smiled when he saw John but Mycroft looked at him the same way he did the night before, like he could read everything about John just from his face.
Mary was flirting with him and John smiled and replied politely back, his concentration on the red door that separated the kitchen from the dining room.
John shook his head; his eyes still squeezed shut, although not for Sherlock’s modesty and more to hide his shame.
He was looking for cupboard or even an empty row of chairs for him to rest his eyes, when movement from the adjoined waiting room drew his attention.
But they weren’t together. It wasn’t from a lack of interest or even a lack of love; both men loved each other dearly, each in their own strange and unorthodox way.
John stood up and quickly changed, peeling off his wet briefs and into a new pair and pyjama bottoms.
“John,” Sherlock started, his voice hoarse and John had the sinking feeling he was going to be rejected. “I have thought of this moment for years.”
John went through the drawers and pulled out a pair of pyjamas for both of them and walked back over to Sherlock.
John watched him go, chuckling to himself. Knowing he was (successfully) manipulated into making the first move, John just smiled, not minding one bit.
“Ah, and heroin is an opioid agonist. Ha! Mycroft is not going to be happy!” Sherlock looked way too thrilled at the idea that the hospital staff knowingly put him into unnecessary danger, but John was more concerned with Sherlock knowledge about drugs.
Sherlock and John didn’t progress into actual sex until another case involving children, which sounds very wrong in John’s head.
“I wanted to see you.” John’s chest felt light after saying that. He never said it out loud before, never allowing himself to, in case it caused him to act rashly and act on the feelings.
“Sick, vomiting child.” John nodded. “Plastered a broken bone.” John nodded again. “Someone bled on you—broken nose?” John smiled. “And…you delivered bad news.” John nodded and pulled a
“Doctor Watson, do not think me oblivious.” Mycroft stepped forward, swinging his umbrella. “You like my brother.”
“I’ll find out and deal with that later. My break ends soon,” he looked Sherlock up and down, remembering last night vending machine and vomiting festivity. “Have you eaten?”
The most they had done was share a bed, completely innocent and John was content for this to be it. He was older than he once was and while he still enjoyed sex and physical intimacy, he didn’t experience the drumming need for it anymore.
“Oh, my silly little doctor,” he said. Sherlock had often used this phrase when John was being particular slow, his tone condescending but now he sounded fond and affectionate and John’s cheeks heated. “I love you, but you really are an idiot.”
as there had been several murders linked to them and Scotland Yard were completely out of their depths.”
“Then take a bloody diazepam! They gave you an opioid antagonist drug, knowing full well that you still had heroin in your bloodstream. Un-bloody-believable!”
“I should probably stop bringing them here,” John chuckled, trying to change the subject. “I’ve eaten here so much, I’d probably OD on MSG.”
“That’s really for the psych to decide, but I don’t see why. We normally only put recovering addicts on anti-depressants if they are showing signs of depression or something, but Sherlock seems right, but then again I haven’t been monitoring his mood.” His tone turned serious. “If he is showing signs of possible relapse, maybe don’t let them administer him drugs that would worsen his conditions.”
He went gently and slowly, stopping every so often to play and twist a forming curl between his fingers, Sherlock humming at the attention.
“Yeah, I’ll-uh, go.” He almost ran out the room, running into the poor unnamed woman keeping watch outside Sherlock’s door. “Sorry,” he murmured.
In an hour, both of them would rouse. John would make tea and Sherlock would order dinner and both of them would settle into the sofa, slouched into one other and trace patterns into each other’s skin, and tell unheard stories from their pasts.
“I didn’t want the first time I said it to be this depressing, nor did I actually want to say it first, mind you.” Sherlock said, sounding like his old condescending self.
After ten minutes, John gave in, needing to make sure Sherlock was okay and needing assurance himself, as he was the one who found and tried resuscitate the kids.
“Is there anything I can do?” John asked, running his fingers across the sweaty back of Sherlock’s neck in a soothing gesture.
John always preferred sitting near the kitchen. Not because he cared about the state of it but he always liked the commotion and fast pace that went through the doors. John liked adrenalin anywhere he could find it. Plus, the added bonus of all the extra smells wasn’t too bad.
After the whole ‘lesbiangate” thing with Irene, Clara had taken the week off from matchmaking, or more likely, Harry finally took pity on her older brother and reigned in her wife.
While his next shift started at nine, little Josephine McKinley’s test results would be back from the lab soon and John really didn’t want to keep Mr and Mrs McKinley waiting, especially since they drove all the way from Dartmouth to be here tonight.
She glared at him and scoffed when he tried to initiate conversation but she hadn’t walked out yet, which only worried John more.
John found him, loitering near the kitchen doors and when they made eye contact, Will smirked and raised his eyebrow at Molly.
A dark skinned woman came behind John and took the struggling chef away from him, handcuffing him and reciting his rights.
“You don’t need to praise me like a child.” John took Sherlock’s tone in stride, used to his mood swings. John was beginning to think that it was just Sherlock’s personality and not a side-affect of withdrawal.
He walked out with them to patient pickup, where a black Benz with heavily tinted windows pulled up.
He straddled Sherlock, Sherlock’s hands resting on his hipbones, and slipped Sherlock’s head through the t-shirt, kissing his forehead as soon as the shirt settled to hang around his neck, waiting.
“So they gave you naltrexone while you still had heroin in your system? Well, that explains your state last night!” John was angry.
John smiled to himself and watched Will walk away, Molly’s eyes following him all the way to the kitchen.
“Well, I gotta’ get back but I’ll check on him soon. Pleased to meet you,” John nodded towards Greg. He looked at Mycroft but didn’t think the glaring man would appreciate nor welcome a farewell.
He thought about John’s body; thick, muscular, tanned by what little sun London had to offer, rippling with the weight of an action, with the rise and fall of his hardened chest — the figure of a rugby player, thighs all-consuming, terribly distracting, and Sherlock imagined them framing his curly mop of hair. He shut his eyes and gasped softly, soaring as he leapt outwards and inwards, sideways and back, mind whirling, filtering every single thought away except those of John Watson.
the idiotic woman who had broken the news to him through the phone, the hands on his shoulders, the voices shrieking at him to snap out of it, the impatient, tinged with worry, tone of — was that
was merely an extension of himself, a piece of the puzzle that formed him; how strange it was to think about, to think that perhaps, just
Sherlock had hated it. He’d never done anything to deserve a celebration, other than being born. But even his birthday hardly called for much mirth or joy; his mother and father invited over distant relatives, his obnoxious younger cousins included, and mostly spent the night sipping cocktails with Uncle Siger and his fling for the weekend. It was practically laughable — and it, not once, felt as though it were something in Sherlock’s honor.
“Dirt under his nails, at the bottom of his boots, and the book hanging out of his bag. It clearly reads,
“Remember,” he heard Victor call from beside his bed, before he appeared at the door of his bathroom, staring predatorily at Sherlock’s shaky movements, “Wait at least twenty minutes before you leave, okay lovebird?”
“Not instantly,” Greg rolled his eyes and pushed his tray away, turning in his seat to better face John, “He deduces things.”
” She groaned, and John could hear shuffling on the other end as he added a gulp or two of milk to his mug, “
He imagined John’s warm grin, his lips curving up in mirth as he stared down at his phone. At least, he hoped he was smiling. John deserved to smile - everyday, every second, every waking moment. Sherlock narrowed his eyes, blinking repeatedly -
, as he created what he did best — as he connected with the world, as he showed the lens of a video camera just who he was; the very heart and soul of John Watson about to be laid out before him — the part of John that made him
It was so hard to believe, when the sun was shining over its poor homes and people, just how dangerous District 12 became in the wintertime. He remembered tugging his jacket tighter around himself as he hiked back home after a discretely unsuccessful trip to the woods, a dreadfully cold wind caressing his cheeks and hugging tightly to his weak bones. He remembered thinking he wouldn't be strong enough to make it back, back to his mother, back to Mycroft, no matter how much he hated him, or back to Redbeard. But somehow he did, and his mother yelled at him for ten minutes straight, threw an orange blanket at him, and made him some soup with the few herbs and vegetables they had left.
The YouTuber barked a laugh and glared at the wall behind where his tripod and camera sat, “What I’m trying to say is that the man creeps up on you. You’re alone one minute, and then bam; you're getting yelled at by a short man with a caterpillar below his nose and bad breath.”
John waited, slowing with the approaching red light, before he glanced back over at Sherlock, the brunette seemingly unmoving, far too focused on his current situation to answer John’s question.
John’s eyes dropped to Sherlock for a moment, softening, before flying back over to Harry, “Shooting a new video.”
Replacing his irritated expression with a blank mask, he lifted his nose a bit and shrugged a single shoulder, swallowing thickly to himself as he watched John’s expression change from curiosity to concern.
John smiled, bright and comforting and reassuring, removing a hand from beneath Sherlock’s shirt and letting his fingers slide along his pale cheek, moving to tuck a stray curl behind his ear, “Good thing I’m absolutely
parties ever since that day with Mycroft, but still: he’d never been invited to one outside of when he’d actually
He inhaled sharply and shut his eyes, shaking his head at his own faulty discretion and turned around, taking the corner cautiously and swallowing thickly as his uncle came into view, sprawled out on the grey couch in a half buttoned dress shirt and unzipped black trousers.
And with a wink, she disappeared behind the large, navy door of her first class, hair twirling and dress flying.
. John was sat at his computer chair, elbows resting on his knees, head up and eyes wide, jaw just slightly open as though merely looking at Sherlock were causing him a sensation of great awe, bewildering the very core of his mind. Though he wouldn’t admit the simple fact, Sherlock was, frankly, terrified — full on scared off his head, worried and plagued with dread because what did this mean now? What was going to happen?
And the vlogger couldn’t help but stare now, at the clear porcelain of Sherlock’s complexion, bare from his costume’s desired makeup, pale and merely blemished by the healing of his bruised features, and want; he wanted to taste every inch of that snow-white skin, his cheekbones and just above his dark brows and beside his eyes and the corners of his mouth, the tip of his nose, the soft surface of his forehead and his lips once more, now free of lipstick, simply bare and pink and plush and slightly swollen from where John had nibbled at them earlier. And
John scoffed inwardly, leaning back at his desk and casually tapping at his screen, shaking his head and officially drowning out the lecture his literature teacher was still subjecting the class to — something about Romeo being “
And with a wink, he vanished behind the shelves, Sherlock left alone, standing still amongst the many novels surrounding him, posture rigid and stiff, heart clenching, ego bruised — and yet still, he knew, he’d let Victor into his dormitory later with open arms.
, they were, as his own, cold and dry, pressed forwards. He felt John’s breath mingling with his own for a moment as plush skin met plush skin. It was the briefest of touches and Sherlock could only hear the quickening of the rain around them as it fell harder and the throbbing of his pulse at his temple, pounding unforgivably as his mind came to and yelled at his heart to
, this surreal being that I thought I’d never be able to meet, let alone lay next to on my bed — bloody hell.” He took a breath and let out a chuckle, “
“You have to make a move eventually,” Irene sighed, shaking her head and glancing at John briefly before she turned to stare into the crowd of mingling bodies, dancing and sweating and laughing and singing. “You can’t dance around each other forever. Surely,
Sherlock let out a soft chuckle and arched a brow, biting the inside of his cheek for a moment before gesturing John onwards with a flick of his chin, “Go on then.”
John swallowed and looked down, thinking his words over in his head. Christ, he was entirely right and it made John completely and utterly sick to his stomach. He hated it — he hated that there were so many things in this bloody life that could so easily break the cleverest, and most amazing, of people. Sherlock had somehow drawn the short straw on who gets chosen for life’s mental lashings. But fuck it — John would just have to make sure nothing else cracked that mosaic any further, that nothing stopped the artist from finishing his masterpiece.
“I feel pretty daft, you know,” John’s words seeped through Sherlock’s busy mind, and he surfaced, his thoughts vanishing to the ‘
It was silent for a good while, Sherlock simply staring blankly, taking in all that he could, John Watson, still in that same outfit, there and not there, existent and non-existent, visible and so very invisible it shook Sherlock to his very core. He swallowed the knot in his throat and gathered his words, those sweet, sweet chemicals sinking further into his veins.
“Maybe,” Sherlock added and timidly glanced down at his hands, chewing on his bottom lip to hold back an even wider grin.
"Gay and straight aren't the only two sexualities, John Hamish Watson," She smirked, winking at him and glancing at his phone as if to further exaggerate her point.
In three minutes, he could decipher just whom the thief was that kept stealing the bread from the bakery tucked away near the district’s center.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched in an attempt to form a mostly hidden smirk before he fiddled with his lighter once more, the cigarette in his mouth drooping pitifully in its wet state. “Dirty laundry,” He mumbled.
But Sherlock was devastatingly and horribly wrong, his heart sinking as those ocean eyes met his own once again, full of an overwhelming amount of both disbelief and thorough discernment. Because Sherlock had been too late, and John had seen. John had seen and now his entire world was going to fall apart on top of him.
John blinked in confusion, and lifted his gaze to the back of Sherlock’s head, curly locks swooping in waves of brown, “Odd name.”
“You clearly cheated,” Sherlock announced as he and John walked next to one another down one of the school’s many corridors, his head held high, his heart practically leaping out of his chest at the mere fact that John hadn’t left his side all day, apart from their separate classes. God, he
“Right, because he gives himself the hickey’s,” Bill chuckled sarcastically, rolling his eyes and smiling lazily alongside Lestrade.
“Alright boys,” John announced, gaining the attention of each of his teammates, their eyes flicking to him loyally, smiles in place and bodies practically trembling with eager excitement. “We’re going to go out there and kick rugby arse, yeah?”
Sherlock felt himself blush and he quickly ducked his head to stare down at his feet, marveling over the words and remembering John’s text from what felt like ages ago —
was someone screaming? — his hands were flying, his mind was throbbing, and Mycroft was suddenly gone.
John rolled his eyes and followed as she turned back towards the dressing room, guiding the both of them once more into the little hallway where she yet again disappeared into the fitting area.
“Fine,” Sherlock bobbed his head once, swallowing the knot in his throat and cursing the bitterness behind his eyes.
He sighed happily as a check mark turned green and he added yet another daily video to his channel, grinning as he stared at the small, red rectangle that portrayed, in a large, white font: 10,033. Never did he think so many people would find him,
The rugby captain snorted, glanced once more at his friends for a single boost of mental support, and took off in the direction of the stairs.
221B. Phone smashed to bits next to him on the wooden panels of the flat’s floor. But why was he here, why hadn’t he been with
Upon his eyelids fluttering open, he hadn’t expected to see plates, a teapot, Ms. Hudson’s china tray, all shattered to pieces along the living room floor of 221B. Shards all thrown about, like a devastatingly, unfixable mosaic. He also hadn’t expected the roughness in his throat, the hoarseness in his tone, or the soreness of his vocal chords.
He growled beneath his breath, unashamed of whoever heard it, and pushed forwards, kicking an empty brown box out of his path whilst lifting a hand to run his fingers through curly, unruly sweat soaked hair. Class had been
“Christ, Molly!” He laughed out, his arms stuck where they were, her embrace far too secure for him to even attempt a hug back.
’s content is so good im actually sobbing? I’m rewatching his older videos and look at how far my baby has come wow.
“Do shut up,” Sherlock snapped, clearly with the desire to sound angry, off-put, but unable to carry the tone through, his voice shaking slightly and his eyes sad, “We all have tragedy in our lives. No sense dwelling on it.”
“The bag. Your bag. The one you almost always lug around with you,” John scoffed, his smile warm and inviting, hoping to persuade Sherlock into spilling his utmost secrets. “What’s in it?”
"He's a bit mysterious," She added, approaching a rack of clothing and flipping through the hangers.
“Tell you what,” Molly smiled comfortingly at him whilst he fixed his gaze on the floor, at her heeled shoes, at his own bare feet, “I’ll make you something fresh, yeah?”
He let his hand roam up from Victor's hip until he felt bare skin, moving under the hem of his white button up and palming his flat, toned stomach. With a groan, Victor bit into his neck, pulling at his skin, tongue dancing, lips caressing, eyes shut and body warm with arousal. Sherlock threw his head back, bumping several books, knocking a few to the floor as he groaned loudly, unable to keep quiet while the boy before him nipped at his creamy white collarbones.
— sitting up straight and eating his food politely, a meal far better than any he’d had in what felt like years, melting on the ridges of his tongue.
With a shake of his head, John cleared his throat and shrugged a shoulder, “We ran into each other the other day. Literally. I knocked him flat on his arse.”
Sherlock arched a brow, attempting to tug his arm from Mycroft's grip, but failing, "A reminder of what exactly?"
“Shut up, Lestrade,” James spat out, tossing his fork at the boy in utter irritation, shaking his head at the nerve, and glancing away, crossing his arms over his chest sulkily.
“You’ve outdone yourself, mate!” John informed him, raising his voice over the pounding music, his smile genuine and his stance open and comfortable. Sherlock watched as Stamford threw his head back in a jolly fit of laughter before he turned back and placed a gentle hand on John’s opposite shoulder.
!” Molly yelled out, appearing from behind a few onlookers swaying slowly, her eyes wide with mirth and mouth open and grinning, Greg’s strolling beside her, their hands interlocked. She was dressed in her favorite yellow dress, but her usual chestnut brown hair was replaced with a ridiculously vibrant lavender wig, another splash of yellow added to the curly purple hue in the form of a clip-on flower. Her skin was a shade of pink, pastel and rosy — she’d clearly forced Greg into helping her with it going by the pink shade staining his fingers. Her lips were painted a dark lilac, and her eyeliner was long and pointed, entirely abnormal and yet surprisingly beautiful atop her soft features. Greg appeared entirely different in contrast — he wore shades of brown, brown jeans and a white shirt, a brown leather jacket atop it. He was clad in big beige boots and had goggles atop his head, makeup smearing his face, giving the illusion of a sort of dirt or mud, his silver hair remaining its ever intriguing shade.
Molly turned to him just slightly and shrugged a small, bony shoulder, "Well, apparently he looks at you and picks up on little details no one would really think to notice, ya know?"
“Hey,” John breathed softly, inching a bit closer to him and nodding his head carefully, comfortingly, “Relax. It’s okay, I promise.”
,” Sherlock snapped and John’s heart sunk, until the brunette shook his head and ruffled his curls once more, “no, no. I couldn’t possibly.”
John scoffed and glanced up at his friend, sighing and lifting a hand to squeeze the bridge of his nose, irritation and frustration swelling to the forefront of his mind, and, much to his disdain, clouding the earlier moments of his day he’d been so very pleased about.
He huffed and threw his duffle bag down, yanking out his ballet shoes and falling to the ground with little grace, before setting his camcorder up and stomping over towards the small stereo in the room’s corner, connecting his phone, choosing his song, and standing in the middle of the wooded floor.
Hello everyone. An enormous apology for how late this update is. I had the chapter half finished for the longest time but struggled to find time to complete it. A lot of things happened along the way but I won't stand here and make excuses. So here it is! Some big things happening in this one. I just hope you're happy with the ending of this chapter.
The room falls slightly quieter for a instant — aside from the loud chattering of groups and tipsy partiers, all gathered around in the center of the room — as one song ended and another begun, and within moments a symphony of instruments began to emanate from the speakers surrounding the room, a few dancers occupying the floor cheering with excitement, bodies and hips already swaying to the catchy fresh tune.
“Moronic,” Sherlock had stated, plain and simply, slapping the book closed with both hands and lifting himself up from his small, leather chair, leaving the novel behind and strolling over to where he’d left his violin, tucked away in its case, beside the window sill.
A loud thump against John’s bedroom door startled Sherlock out of his reverie, so much so that he jolted upwards, whirling to face John’s sister, of whom looked exhausted and slightly perturbed as she carried in two cups, simple in color and design, and placed them down on John’s dresser with a huff.
John blinked, narrowed his eyes, thought for a moment, and then gazed back at Sherlock amusedly, “Yes, Sherlock, that’s called strategizing.”
, Sherlock recited quietly, sighing to himself, as the images flickering before him made the Capitol out to be some sacred paradise, all announced through the voice of President Snow, the devil himself.
The small, mousy girl stood, brushed a hand down the front of her white blouse, of which was checkered with tiny, red miniature horses, and shot the three boys a small smile, grabbing for her yellow backpack and stating, “Till next time, lads. Maybe I’ll sit here more often, yeah?” With that, she ruffled John’s hair and spun on her heel, heading through and into the crowd of students disappearing out of the large exit doors.
Before John could open his mouth to respond, Coach the Roach’s whistle rang out, jolting him awake and knocking him back to reality. With a soft chuckle, he glanced at his team mates preparing to line up and then back at Sherlock.
Honestly, you needn't forgive me because even I don't forgive me. I've started classes again at University and unfortunately I'm located in Florida so I was hit quite terribly by hurricane Irma.
Sherlock felt his mouth go dry as he stared at John in all his glory, that dirty blonde hair, the blue of those eyes, the slope of his nose and the sincerity behind his lifted lips and amused chuckle.
And with that, he was walking as quickly as he could out of the cafeteria, bursting through the doors and reaching into his sweatshirt pocket, shoving his headphones back into his ears and trying desperately to forget about his interaction with one
Sherlock blinked and glanced at Lestrade and Molly, Greg grinning unashamedly, teeth and all, and Molly hiding a knowing smile behind the palm of her hand, brought up to cover her pink lips — what the bloody hell did they know that he didn’t?
And then John let out a soft sigh, not of irritation or exhaustion, but of mild concern, his brows creasing the skin between them, his eyes narrowing, and his tongue darting out to lick over the expanse of his bottom lip as he slowly, carefully reached forward, his hand, much to Sherlock’s internally incredulity and the rapid racing of his heart, grazing the soft surface of where his jumper covered his wrist. Those fingers stayed there, just resting, directly over those sore bruises, black and blue hidden beneath a layer of fabric, out of sight but obviously not out of mind, a touch so very close and yet so very far all the same.
She loved them endlessly and would continuously express just how talented he was, admiring his footwork and movements in the most admirable of technical manners possible. If there was ever one person Sherlock would admit to loving, it would certainly be Ms. Hudson.
“Definitely not the latter,” Sherlock gasped out, voice hoarse with nervousness want and desire, their heads tilting, their lips drawing closer, their bodies meeting, warmth pressed against him, strong and grounding and exhilarating and —
“Why?” Sherlock asked, tone hoarse from lack of use, and he cleared his throat quickly, glancing down at the floor and away from his uncle as he awaited the answer to his question, only to instantly regret the decision as a hand slapped him upside the head, causing his ears to ring and his figure to turn uncomfortably.
Sherlock let out a sigh, insults rising to the forefront of his mind, though he begrudgingly begged them to clear off — he didn’t
Sherlock looked away shyly before beginning to exit the vehicle, his heart pounding against his chest as John snickered to himself in both awe and surprise. Closing the door behind him with a faint smile, he followed John towards the building, walking alongside him whilst he clicked the car key, only turning to Sherlock once it had honked in affirmation.
“Why are you here?” Sherlock snapped suddenly, and then winced — he hadn’t meant to sound so very harsh, his tone sharp and cold, a mask of ice laced beneath his words. However, from Molly’s unchanged expression, she clearly saw straight through him, the way he’d grimaced in regret, his brows furrowing, his mouth twitching downwards, his eyes darting carefully over her features.
John quirked a sad smile at that and swallowed, moving to sit atop the closed toilet seat, turning to face Sherlock and frowning, worry in his features, a question in his eyes.
John clicked it and watched as the screen remained black but for a few white words that fluttered across the screen:
"What is the deduction thing anyway?" John asked, narrowed his eyes as he frowned. Mike and his friends had mentioned it before, always saying how he knew things he shouldn't, and that he saw things no one should be able to see. Hell, the whole school was practically terrified of it.
“Ready mate?” He heard Greg ask from his right, and he turned, a warm smile in place and butterflies calming just a bit at his friends soft expression.
“Guess so,” She chirped back and Sherlock looked away, holding back the roll of his eyes and turning instead to meet John’s content look, his eyes still fixed on Sherlock, the rugby captain looking eternally merry across from him, cheeks lifted, mouth curved upward, body leaning forward and utterly gratified.
Somehow, he found Mycroft's eyes in the back of the crowd, glaring at him blankly, not a single emotion betraying his ever-present mask.
Sherlock gazed over at him with wide eyes, as though John’s confidence in his singing abilities was astounding, before his shocked expression turned into one of utter hilarity, his mask breaking and a heavy laugh emanating from those perfectly sculpted lips, bright and deep in tone, melodious and everything John wanted to hear for the rest of his life.
“There’s no charge for this one-” John started. Sherlock’s jaw fell and he glared at John. “Yes, your time is valuable, but you are so-”
“Sherlock?” John asked, awaiting another crash. When nothing came, he peered through the small crack.
Another shitty thing about blind dates; you were always stuck, waiting for your date to arrive (if they were going to) and then playing
“Just…” he looked away from the window, not wanting to seem anymore pathetic than he already felt. “Make sure he stays sober.”
The man had the most amazing and sharp cheekbones John had ever seen and with the combination of those with his dark curls, light eyes, pale, clear skin, and tall and slender body, John wondered why the man was waiting tables in a shabby, hole-in-the-wall restaurant and not modelling for Vogue or something.
Even after solving the case, solving the puzzle and finding the children and the assailant, Sherlock was a few hours too late. One was dead and the other in critical condition, the abductor unconscious from John’s fist and Sherlock miserable.
John still thought that his idea for a seat in the lift was a good one, when he made his way up to the Psych Unit, leaning heavily on the lift’s metal interior walls.
There was a man in grey, low hanging tracksuit pants and a thin black shirt kneeling in front of the vending machine, seemingly bargaining with the electronic device.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, confused but nodded and John turned back to undo Sherlock’s towel once again.
Anytime John came to visit Sherlock, there was always someone waiting outside, whether is be Greg or Mycroft or this well-dressed woman who would never give John her name.
