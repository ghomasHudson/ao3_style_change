” She laughed nervously, perhaps as an attempt to ease the unrelenting tension on the room, yet it did nothing to wipe away the disturbed look over their frames. Her half-smile was erased and instead replaced by an expression of deep sadness, tears gathering inside her eyes in sympathy. “I’m sorry.” She said, letting one teardrop roll down her cheek, only to be startled when Sherlock reached out and wiped it away with his hand. Discretely dropping it into the large mixing bowl while Janine stood there, puzzled as to what had happened.
I had a lot of fun writing this and I really hope you liked it and would like to know what you thought of it. I'm planning the third (and final) part of the series and should come out in the future so be on the look out!
“An opportunity to do what, exactly? Destroy us?” She snarled, her perfect, white teeth bared in a surprisingly savage manner. “You all remember, don’t you?” She turned around, addressing the adults present, specially the King and Queen, who had already gathered close to find out more about the commotion. “The poisoned apples, the curses?” That last word had more weight for John’s father than Sherlock had anticipated, he had been ignorant on how affected the prince’s family still was at his father’s previous beastly condition. “My daughter was raised by fairies because of your mother.” Margaret said, while Sally was smirking at his left, her smile growing with every sentence uttered. “Her first words, her firsts steps, I missed them all.” She turned around and placed a hand over her eyes when recalling the sadness she felt for that.
. The blue-eyed boy ignored him and kept smiling amusedly. The second note of the whistle brought them out of their laughing and into running to the field with helmets and lances, ready to be in joust position.
Thursday.” He said, only to be met with a blank stare and confused grimace. Both of which were quite rare to see on his boyfriend’s face separately, let alone at the same time.
“But where are Sherlock and John?” He asked, his big nose scrunching as he frowned in confusion. “You’re committing treason, aren’t you?” His eyes widened and his mouth hung open as he figured it out —at leas, he thought he did. “I’ll have to tell John’s parents, or Lady Hudson-” He said, already retreating to the door to make a run for it and ruin all their plans.
wasn’t John Watson.
The machiavellian dynasty was gruesomely executed and the vagabonds and never-do-wells were left in the perpetual state of betrayal and crime against each other until their old ways seemed blurred. Constantly switching back and forth between keeping The Isle going and actually living and thriving on chaos. No magic. No wifi. No way out.

question, my dear,” He continued. “Is if you mean in comparison or likeness.”
What was your favourite moment of the chapter? And why do you believe Sherlock will do to solve his conflict?
“I’m afraid I can’t do that.” He said, turning his gaze away from the other’s face and grabbing the front of the stupid jumper the king was wearing underneath the jacket. Presenting the wand with the remaining hand.

“No, no no.” Molly shook her head as an answer to his unvoiced question. “I’ve seen it.” She explained, suddenly ready to defend him; all he had done is fix her poor attempts at hiding rose-coloured hair, for evil’s sake! And that had been completely in his selfish interests. “He’s good at people problems.”
“She’s an angry girl with a bad plan.” The other replied, the yellow dust over the left side of his face accentuating the frown over his brow. “That’s not so different from when you first came to Auradon.”
Irene and Greg were being summoned by one of the helpers and Sherlock took a deep breath in relief, maybe not being the only new one would give him a sense of stability. “How about a game of Melee before dessert is served?” His dad offered, and the blonde boy grinned at his boyfriend’s surprised face, as if he were not anticipating being invited to participate in any activity with someone who, by all means, did hold a level of animosity towards him, if only indirectly. “Of course,” He had assented, but then his expression became a tad panicked.

“Like it?” John asked, his expression open and completely blissed out. “I-” He started, his words slow and smooth as he approached to reach past Sherlock and grab another small dumpling; his face coming close to the other’s as he popped the food inside his mouth with a big grin. “…

“Yes, I play on a team.” Greg answered, his voice taking on a challenging edge, and his hands balling into fists. The muscles on his arms were straining said shirt, Sherlock looked on in half-amusement at watching his friend so flustered. Who knew he could become so attached to a sports team this quickly?
little brother.” He said, and Sherlock turned an icy gaze towards his direction. The familiarity of the banter leaving him feeling oddly reassured, and when he saw the other’s expression, he deduced perhaps that was the intention.
After a few hours of catching up with the week’s obligations, Mike and John retired to their designated chambers, but just after parting, the advisor turned to the prince and said one last time. “John,” The blonde turned around to look at his friend. “I look forward to meeting him.” He said, a calm and thoughtful expression on his face.
John snatched it back and grimaced. “I’m trying my best-” He said, but Lestrade shook his head as if he weren’t impressed with his efforts. The royal turned hopeful blue eyes to Irene as he followed her into another alley and tried to copy her exact movements.
The man with the ginger beard laughed in derision; making John apprehensive about what he could have possibly missed. The pirate stood back and grinned with perfectly white teeth. “He already accepted.” He commented, and John didn’t need a mirror to know that his face had fallen. “So
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock knew what their faces must tell at the moment, how not one of them had experienced something even remotely akin to what she just described in all their life. Irene and Greg’s single parents were hardly attentive, and cared for their offspring more as an asset to obtain their desires than actual children, and Sherlock didn’t even have a family to speak of; just a maniac with a power-complex for a guardian and a lost brother that nobody had seen for more than thirteen cycles. —not that his mother had been even the least affectionate when she was alive. He doubted anyone on the island got to live as they did on Auradon. Everything there was business transactions and violent reluctant deals. No time, nor use, for anything else.
“Greg?” Irene said, tugging on the black, sheer sleeves of he dress to hide from the cold wind. The blonde turned around to stare at the crates of junk next to the door as the other two talked. “It’s really weird being back here.” She commented, looking around her as if she expected the place to swallow her whole and never spit her back out.
of them got distracted. Mostly by each other. That aspect of their relationship still sometimes threw John, despite its frequent occurrence. He’d wander into the living room, or perhaps the kitchen, and Sherlock wouldn’t be doing anything out of the ordinary. He’d still yell at the television, still sulk on the couch if there was no case to be had or Lestrade was being particularly difficult. Yet John would look at him, and a wave of affection would well up unbidden.
John felt an aching in his chest, he couldn’t breathe. Like he had been running a marathon, his chest heaved with unspoken grief. The last bit of tension between the two of them seemed to melt, blossoming finally in the way that both of them curled towards each other.
It had been three nights later that Sherlock had found himself all but crawling out of his skin and his mind, as much from withdrawal as something else.
Her nose wrinkled slightly at the unfairness of it all, huffing slightly at the thought of always being pushed around just because she wasn't big or strong like Conrad or annoyingly bossy like Daniel. It did a number on her nerves whenever she was sent to the battlefield, and she didn't like being told what to do to begin with. Not unless she got something in return. Which she
“He had iron gauntlets for his claws, his specialty was weapon-manifestation. The rumours were at one point he could level a mountain with one strike, but I think father just tells that story to scare Sherlock into going to bed.”

Taking a deep, steadying breath, he stepped into full view of the doorway, holding a plastic bottle of shampoo and some more strips of bacon on a plate. He was determined not to tremble as he clicked his jaw, standing soldier-straight, but not imposingly so. Still Sherlock reared backwards, nearly slipping before righting himself properly.
of nature. John might have laughed at the irony of it all, his own genetic code now far more “freakish” than even Sherlock’s. He settled instead for defending the detective, even if the man was currently elbows-deep in human remains, yelling at Lestrade testily.
In all seriousness though, Merry Christmas. Though this chap is a little short, by the end of it I think you'll agree that it needed to end there. You won't be disappointed, I think.
He didn't have dreams or goals.
Greg flushed a little.
Sherlock would have liked to have stayed, would have liked to have fought it out. He would have loved nothing more than to tear that composure apart, dig his fingers into it until it came apart red in his hands. He wished for nothing more than to rip open the beating heart of a clockwork design, John Watson, to see inside. Find what made him refuse to give up. Get angry.
...Did Dragons sleep?
Except Sneak's hands were suddenly at the buttons of his shirt, and like sunlight shattering an illusion, the detective pushed him gently away. Sherlock's eyes were pained, and he was panting softly, cheeks flushed scarlet. His gaze was unwavering, but it held in it only sorrow. Struggling to explain, scattered as his Mind-Palace struggled to come back online. To phrase things properly.
The Colonel's broad shoulders were squared with pride and he spoke in a thunderous voice that was as brassy and bold as it was shimmering. It was the kind of tone that made even the most exhausted soldier (and there were quite a few, what with the parties that had gone on last night and the amount of drink that had been passed around) bolster with confidence. Despite himself John found the stirring of camaraderie quiver inside of him, further encouraged by Mike's friendly nudge in the shoulder and Bill's sunny grin as he fell into line.
, and how they twitched slightly with restless energy. She wondered at it until
The tone was a danger sign, disbelieving and deadly. Something in those blue eyes flashing. There was a crackling energy about Sherlock, and some of his mask became sharper, less like a flat pond and more like sharp ice just waiting for John to impale himself upon. “You’re accusing me of being childish? Humans are children, running over the Earth, laying waste to it wherever they go. Your kind are nothing but lying, fickle creatures. You wouldn’t understand my actions even if I explained them, with your dull mind.” The words were hateful, and with them came the ominous rumble of thunder out beyond the temple. John didn’t care, the sound exhilarated him, made his blood boil under his skin.
. Rather, it irked him because he
Pale skin, humanoid figure whose modesty was covered only by a tied fur cloak about his waist. Pale blue eyes burned in a face impassive in a cold and calculated rage.
Both man and Dragon made sure that Murray slept each night, as he was prone to sitting outside in the cold desert air, gazing up at the stars with a lit cigarette in his hand, shoulders trembling. John couldn't even say for sure if it was the flight training that was bothering his friend, or if it was the memory of something else. Some deeper running scar.
“John, before you do anything, just listen to me. You're in a state of panic-”
John watched as Sherlock looked at Lestrade not with confidence, but something skittish and close to fear. The last remnants of Shyla’s makeup from the night before still lingered on the detective’s face, making blue eyes seem bluer and their trembling lips darker and smudged to hell. Lestrade’s question still hung in the air, tense now that John had appeared and likely due to become more so as Sherlock still hadn’t found their voice, the words to communicate.
Vodka and something that tasted vaguely like lemonade lined his lips as he licked them, a warm tingling bubbling in his blood that made him feel as if he were made of fireworks. It had been awhile since he had felt so utterly sloshed, and he embraced it even as more and more people turned in for the night, smiling and laughing and finally opening up to the rest of the town. Most of the people had, if not known him as a child, at least known his grandmother, and as a result they were quick and jovial in opening up their tightly-knit little circles.
“Shut up, dad!” The sentence was out, and angry, and clearly not intended, as he wilted right after finishing; but it was enough to draw a gasp out of the crowd. Eurus grinned when her gaze met silver eyes. Sherlock had seen John like this before; one of his most vivid moments in Auradon was on a sports field under the summer sun all those moon cycles ago. Perhaps the boy had never been more honest with John than when he was lying to him to steal the wand; but the royal was another matter altogether. The racing brain quickly unraveled it from there and found the reason to be exactly the same as to why his coat felt lighter than it should.
“His girlfriend.” Mary finished. Her face was amiable, but her smile was not entirely sincere. John knew the princess was not exactly pleased with the situation; not because she had anything against the kids in particular, but she believed he was deluding himself into thinking they would ever be able to function in their society. The prince was set on proving her wrong.
The voice said, as they showed the footage of John feeding him chocolate strawberries. Sherlock could remember it had been one of the times they —or at least he— had actually enjoyed the afternoon during the excruciating, long journey.
“What? Why?” The lady said, turning her frail figure to gaze more closely at Sherlock. The boy stood straighter, not ready to be deemed unworthy of anyone’s time; if nothing else, they would know against whom they were planning on going. “You! I’d recognise those venomous eyes anywhere.” Margaret exclaimed in recognition as she took a frightened step back, the fear inside her expression obvious even from far-away lands. “Where is your mother?” She asked, apparently not completely aware there was no way his mother would be able to be there.
But before he can wonder at what might have distracted or distressed the Doctor so as to make him change his treatment of his most expensive item on his person he disappears to his room, the door closing softly above. The low click in the flat is an alien sound to Sherlock's ears, as he is used to living alone. With John's presence comes a wealth of little noises, things that are distracting in their newness and tempting to pull him from his thoughts. The most interesting thing is that the man didn't even seem to realize that he did it. He coaxed Sherlock to eat when he normally would have ignored his stomach's steady stream of complaints, and made him tea with sweet honey even though they barely knew one another.
The sun was well on its way to setting by the time John was driving home. It painted the sky firey red and mellow gold, and made the road hard to look at directly with its brightness. His mind was preoccupied as he drove, filled with the events of the past few hours.

had all but
Something flickered on the Water-Spirit’s face, but John was far too caught up in his miniature rant to notice. He continued bravely, rather from confidence or desperation.
A veritable hospital on wings.
Sherlock found with a disturbing amount of glee that having someone to bounce ideas on had benefits that he couldn’t have foreseen. That he found himself shining brighter than he had thought possible, and that his brain was no longer quite so aloof from the rest of the world. John, plain and simple John, acted as a conductor of light, bridging the gap between the droves and him. He was a hand to follow, to lead him] into understanding of the little things that had always eluded him. What’s more he wasn’t irritating as he did so. In fact, John made the entire process as painless as running. As freeing as soaring towards the sky. He didn’t act like a chain, as Mycroft had. Even when he was correcting him or challenging him, John didn’t beat Sherlock down from his place high in the sky. Rather, he gently guided him, pointing out the benefits of occasionally touching the Earth and learning how to jog in the land of the dull and grey. Because hidden under the layers of rubble, were minute gems that shimmered with brilliance. John attracted them like a magnet, bringing them to Sherlock like prizes at his feet. Little things, like the rich smell that a morning cuppa could bring, or the special taste of sweat that accumulated on a person’s upper lip when they chased after a murderer in the cold London air. He wasn’t a man of sky, and yet he flew with the detective when called. He did it effortlessly, and then returned to his place back on the ground, prepared for the next time when Sherlock called him.
“I… I thought I heard you. When I got shot.” Staring as he was at the ceiling, he frowned to himself. “In my head. You shouted for me, but it. It wasn’t like usual. It was like… Like-“
Little did the creature realise until it was too late, that John had a piece of driftwood in his hands, creeping soundlessly behind Sherlock until he raised it high in the air, and firmly brought it down with cold brutality over the Selkie's skull.
It was strange, how small someone could appear to be when they leaned against another.
“We could play a game of sorts, if you'd like.”
The detective might
“Would've had to come here in a few days anyway, being a medic and all. I'm in charge this shift, if you need something, don't be afraid to ask.” He turned to Sherlock then, silently sizing up the Dragon's form for a moment before he got to his diagnosis.
Not when everything was wrong.
Dodge’s brown eyes glittered in the darkness. Her voice was cool.
John paused as he wondered at the question to himself. He and Mike had both been given pamphlets from the

Sherlock hadn’t been asleep, curled as he was up on the other side of the bed. He hadn’t slept in a while, truthfully. He didn’t turn around as he replied, but he felt the warmth of John’s body, pressed against his spine.
To John, Sherlock's life was

“I may be forced to wed, but I will
“Do you treat my creations as if they are
with an armful of files and the expectation of seeing the detective crashed out on the couch, or John making breakfast.
There had been nothing, and as the evening came upon them with a blood red sunset, John had felt his abdomen tighten with unease. As night fell and even Molly’s chattering drew to an awkward close, John felt himself beginning to sweat as the percolations of his fears took over the forefront of his mind.
“For a society that considers it outdated, you seem to rely heavily on magic.” Commented Sherlock once they entered the main hall of the bright castle and they noticed the moving paintings on the ceiling. John couldn’t really remember having told them that magical abilities had been monitored, restricted and essentially ignored for cycles, but he supposed it could have been obvious for an outsider in some way. “What happened with all the spells and cauldrons?” He asked. “The wands?” He sounded like a curious child in search for information, his coat whirling behind him giving him a strange amalgamated appearance between dramatic and innocent.
Sherlock opened his mouth to answer, but Lady Hudson was quicker wrapping her thoughts into a coherent sentence. “He used the reversal incantation to lock Moriarty inside his own mind.” She explained, and there was a pregnant silence in the room for a few moments. All of them astonished at the news of what he had unwittingly accomplished. The first to recover was, surprisingly, the new king who quickly approached the violet-haired boy once more, and, in a fit of spontaneous affection, wrapped his sturdy arms around his waist and hoisted him up in the air in celebration. “John!” The rebel complained in disgust, patting the blonde’s shoulder to get him to put him back on the ground once more, where he belonged. John laughed that honest laugh as Irene and Lestrade chuckled in amusement behind them. Sherlock shot them both a nasty, murderous look; but once his sight reached the royal, his eyes turned slightly more charmed and the glare lost some of its heated intensity.
The eyebrows on his forehead scrunched up, as Lestrade stood there awkwardly. “I haven’t actually.” He admitted, even if it should not come as any surprise that a person who had spent most of his life banished from the kingdom had never attended any royal event, save for the fateful coronation that brought them there in the first place.
and was quite floored at the resemblance. She made no move to get up, happy to lay on the wood, indifferent of the blade resting on her collarbone and grinning through the blood running down her nose. John decided not to think about that sight.
She said, and Sherlock let go of the railing, slowly taking a step back from the edge as her words sunk in. “Thank you, it was
odd figure among a sea of devotion, with eyes fixed on the other’s back and a broken expression over his face.
John set down his cup, rubbed the palms of his hands on his jeans.
his lips almost brushing his cheek. Those eyes were wide and so very intense. When John could finally gather an answer, it was only to nod once, weakly. With the minute movement of his head, he felt the vice-grip on his wrists loosen, release. A voice was was a deep as the heart of a cave murmured its approval of the young man’s silent understanding.
But even as it cried out its claim, familiar hands were scooping John into their arms. His dad's voice was warm and wet, begging for him to open his eyes even as he screamed for his mum to call an ambulance. John wanted to wake, but he felt as if his body was made of lead. Heavy and lethargic, he barely managed to utter a small groan. He could feel his father's warmth, seeming to suck whatever cold had leached into John's bones out even as he rocked him gently and murmured reassurances. Hazily, John registered that his dad's voice didn't sound angry like he had expected. Rather, he sounded afraid.
The detective's voice was disbelieving as he spoke.
Mrs. Hudson watched it all with fond amusement, eyes crinkling at the corners even as her mouth fought to keep back a smile. She didn't appear overly worried for John's safety, and he soon found out why when she explained.
Its collar sat about its neck, a tag glinting softly in the light, the faint silver etching of a name not visible from where John crouched.He doesn't plan on getting any closer. He might have had a penchant for danger, but he was not stupid. As it was, he was still vitally aware of his mortality in the bruises he was sure were forming around his throat.
This chapter's mostly from Mycroft's point of view, and offers some more insight into their somewhat damaged dynamic. Warnings for a lot of misgendering in this chapter.
at him, dressed as he was. Poor clothes, dilapidated hand-me downs. Patched up.

When the soldier asked his partner what had happened, Sherlock refused to respond. His tense posture however spoke of something feral, unguarded. It was clear to John that whatever had just happened was not normal Dragon etiquette. Moreover, it appeared to have shaken Sherlock to the core so that no amount of soothing would calm him. The Dragon remained tense, snapping at John's teammates, who were only vaguely aware of anything happening at all. Yet as John listened, he could hear the thoughts of the other Dragons in the truck, uneasy and afraid. He felt himself frown, trying in vain to ascertain what was causing them such distress.
recognised him and called out his name. The army doctor's smile was about as forced as if it was being birthed, and his eyes were pained as with false politeness he responded to his childhood friend's greeting.
However the Dragon may have remained calm, if it weren't for the other Dragon's nerve. His gall to reach out and
Greg silently replied. He chased after Mycroft, the two of them drifting up towards the top of the northern mountain together.
She had been sitting in the ambulance that brought John along, the decision made since she was the smallest of John's family and surprisingly the one in the least hysterics. Her eyes narrowed in thought, and she looked at the doctor questioningly.
long, and they were a mass of disjointed angles as he crouched in the tub like a gargoyle. His toes twitched restlessly under the cold water, and those pale blue eyes moved with the pent-up energy of a man half-wild and uncertain. They crackled with the kind of intensity that could strip the bark from even the staunchest oak, and the scapulae of his back rolled slightly with tension under the soldier's steady gaze. John could now see with the absence of all the grime deep scars lacing all down the Dragon's arms and spine, crossing each other like lace ribbons spiralling down a canvas. The infection still bled sluggishly, but now that it had been cleaned it seemed a lot less severe that it had first appeared at a glance. That was relieving, as John dreaded to think what might have happened if it had been too serious. All Dragons in the military needed their wings, flying was an essential part of training. If Sherlock had been handicapped, then no amount of patience would have changed his fate. In fact compared to the brutally honest bruises and scars, it looked almost tame in terms of damage. He was surprised when an impossibly pale arm reached out to stop his hands as they hovered over the marks of abuse in a kind of morbid fascination, Sherlock's grip icy and wet and as solid as steel. Though the Dragon's eyes were downcast towards his knees, the message was clear.
And he knew this. Had accepted it long ago.

them by accident. The children of the market appeared to hold little fear, even of soldiers, and many paused to look at Sherlock, babbling in foreign languages and pointing out his collar or the shifting nature of his scales that dotted his skin here and there to their parents.
“Sherlock,” he murmured in kind, head tilting in question. There was less fear, now. Somehow, he had seen vulnerability during the Selkie’s illness. Though he didn’t quite see Sherlock as human (and really perhaps never would) he could acknowledge the fact that the Selkie wasn’t a monster from a fairy tale. Rather, both brothers seemed intelligent, and what’s more capable of compassion. That in the end, was what kept John still, kept him from running. Sherlock wasn’t looking at him like food, no. He was looking like he was in pain, suffering from some unseen pull that John just simply couldn’t see.
Faint as a breeze, his nose caught the scent of perfume on John’s clothes. He would later learn the scent had a name, as so many strange things did in this Human world of metal and order disguising violence:
In fact, as much as he had initially chafed at the idea of staying upstairs, he had seen

diversity, a 'melting pot' of ethnicity. People of every race, age and gender crowded the already very busy market, creating a noise so loud that part of John was certain people back home in London might hear it. Despite the bustling activity however, he found that people quickly made way for him when they caught sight of his uniform, glancing at him with as much respect as suspicion as they carried on their way, gathering produce to put on display tables. Much of the market was a bargaining sort of place, and John soon discovered that every coin was bartered for almost ruthlessly, every last shred of fabric or food sold for its worth, nothing more and nothing less. The shopkeepers were as good at bartering as the buyers, and they knew the exact value of their product and could predict how hard to push a customer based on the person before them. It was a complicated, rather fascinating game to watch, and as John wandered through the stalls (waiting for Murray to finish his business with a fruit-seller) he found himself smiling and even chuckling at the liveliness of the people around him. He especially enjoyed watching the small children, clinging to their parents’ robes or skirts, ducking between legs and cheekily begging the shopkeepers out of their goods with big eyes and grabby hands. Despiteof their rather ragged appearances they all seemed joyful and carefree, and John found himself somewhat relieved. To see a bright side to the depressing scenery redeemed an ache that had been truthfully nagging at him for some time now. And although he knew little to no Pashto or Dari, he cheerfully tried to learn, listening to the voices around him.
Which normally, wouldn't have set John off as much as it did. It was just the prior events that caused the doctor's already thinned patience to snap in half, crackling in impatience as he whirled on the detective and demanded in a voice that was dangerously close to a snarl
For another time then.
“Y-you want your cloak back, but you also want m-me.” Saying it made it more real somehow. Still John pressed onwards. “Give me two months, about sixty nights to decide whether or n-not I want you. Get to know me. Let
John was pinned to the ground by Sherlock, shielded from the blast of heat that radiated like molten lava, causing the air to shiver with fire. He felt the side of his face heating up with it, not-quite burning. When he blinked, there was a blast of air that blew back his short-cropped hair from his face. When the soldier opened his eyes, there was a ragged hole in the roof of the medic bay.
“Intense,” he murmured at last. “It’s intense. You can feel everyone in the castle beside you,

He did not shower (neither did John, for that matter).
He watched as John's dark blue eyes widened in awe and amazement. An expression Sherlock knew actually quite well.

and pressed his tongue against the detective’s frenulum and Sherlock’s eyes rolled back.
It was created as a realm for the moon goddesses’ children, the many stars that litter the night,” It was a familiar bedtime story, one John had heard many times in his own village. It changed from his memories of the tale as the woman went on. “But the darkness became difficult to control, gained awareness, and with it, came the wolves.” The music box played, and an image in John’s mind began to flicker to life.

Sherlock had done his best to explain their situation.
And John, finally stumbling into the moonlight with a yelp as his legs all but gave way underneath him, found himself crawling uncontrollably towards his nightmare.
Some more information about Sherlock's past is to come~ For now enjoy John trying to work out the detective's feelings, as well as his own :P
The Human finally crested the rock, and Sherlock soon found himself looking at the silhouette of a man. It was too dark for even the Selkie to make out his features, but upon the crest of the rock he could see that he was short for a male, and that his aura of energy was unusually bright. Golden, like Sherlock imagined the sun might feel like, if he had ever been able to taste its kiss. The shadow swayed as if he was having trouble staying on his feet, and his leg trembled minutely.
The phase did not cease with their mother’s rejection.
Sherlock knew it was likely from the fact that he hadn't eaten in about three days. He also knew that Victor would not take kindly to this admittance. He also was aware that the reasons for
Before John could ask how she knew, there was the quietest of knocks at the door. Conversation was momentarily forgotten as a man with a shaved head and a narrow faced entered, white robes not hiding the circles under his eyes and the jut of his bones. His voice was querulous and reed-thin.
“I’m… afraid of a lot of things, lately. Afraid of you, afraid of sleeping… just… afraid," he admitted.

him, and he didn’t seem to shy away from the strange prince who liked looking human. There was only the fact that Mycroft found himself strangely tongue-tied when he looked at Greg, and the fact that he realised a moment after that they weren’t as alone as he’d thought.
“Truly, you don’t.”
John's mind whispered tauntingly
“What?”
As it turned out, John was already awake, immersing himself in what could only be described as the hell that was editing his blog. Shyla stepped lightly into the living room to find the ex-army doctor seated in his chair, tongue stuck out in concentration as John did his chicken-tap tying, one key painfully at a time. The sight of it momentarily cut the detective’s uneasy mood short, a small smile coming to her face unbidden. John at times was so unassuming, so small and, well, adorable in his own dependable way. It was easy to forget sometimes that the man was in many ways just as much of a shut-in as Sherlock, not to mention the fact that the good doctor had extensive military training. Languidly, Shyla flounced forward, falling onto the sofa in the characteristically lazy manner to which she was accustomed. John noticed her out of the corner of his eye, humming a greeting.
so it made sense. He felt as if he might start crying, if he wasn’t half sure it would make Sherlock look at him as if he were rather pathetic. Looking at all the water his villagers were drinking, dancing in, and collecting, John for the first time wondered if this marriage, this entire ordeal, might be worth it.
himself with unconsciously for John's sake had slipped, and now the man saw the true
The pamphlet would have nothing to say on what to do about
Then, ignoring the detective's feeble protests, John worked his belt free from his hips and tugged down, expecting to see blood. Expecting to see a lot of things, really.
To the Detective's utter surprise, a growling and yet familiar voice responds. Its' laced with a Welsh accent, and its' far angrier than Sherlock's ever heard it before, but there's no mistaking the lilt to it. The base tone.
But of course, almost nothing ever works the way one would like.
“So… Sherlock’s a defective Gem, then. I still don’t understand why that makes him so embarrassed though. It’s not like I’m going to judge him for it, most people think
“Who’s? I am no one’s.” John answered in confusion once he regained his composure, swallowing aside his own fear to make way for indignation. He drew himself to his full height, noticing with some annoyance that even so he still found himself looking up. The man’s pale blue robes were luminescent as he moved, and glittering trails of snow lined the long sleeves as he twirled the handle of his parasol thoughtfully. The man’s head tilted to the side in a flat, reptilian way.
This was after of course he'd shouted at John, demanded he'd leave. Screamed at him every insult to which the good doctor had merely snorted at, seating himself by the man's bedside with the firmness of a stone.
“That one. He is the one I choose to wed.”
But he wasn't stupid.
“What is going on?”
his side and facing towards the wall. Although John hadn't understood where the black mood had come from at the time, he could still tell that something was eating at his
“So sleep.” The unsaid didn’t need to be uttered, that Sherlock would do his best from now onwards to do the protecting when needed. That John would do the same for him.
It wasn't his fault the people in white coats couldn't leave them alone. In the end, they paid the price.
“What are you-”
Then Sherlock woke, jerking awake with a snarl already on his lips before he took in the rapidly-becoming recognizable peeling wallpaper of 221 C. Slowly, he took in the fact that he had slept for nearly a full day and a half, the morning sun probably just beginning to rise if his internal clock was correct. Much too long; he could usually manage to go without sleep for nearly a week before he collapsed. The bath had made him stupidly complacent. Unsure of how long John expected him to rest for, he came to wonder as always if he would finally be beaten for one of his transgressions. Nervously, he licked his lips and listened half-fearfully for the crack of a whip or an angry voice. Instead, he was surprised to hear a sound that was at once recognizable and yet alien to him, drifting softly down from the floor above him with a gentle caress. It had probably been the thing that had woken him up in the first place.
“There is nothing you
“Please don’t leave. It was not my intention....”
John looked at him with a mixture of exasperation and pleading. The soldier's gaze turned to Dodge, and Sherlock realised with some annoyance that
Beautiful music. The prettiest John had ever heard. It pulled at him, tugging in his gut and yanking his own heart out from his ribs. He had to follow. Had to chase after it. He didn't want it to fade. His own limbs felt all too thick and yet paper-thin, like he could break into pieces if he so much as breathed.
The army doctor looked small, coiled into a protective sphere with his head somehow contorting to rest upon the arm of the furniture, eyes closed but flicking with the beginnings of sleep smoothing out the lines of his forehead. Sherlock felt a small but crippling wave of relief fill him at just the sight of it, the utter innocence of the posture that John held. Defensive but not completely shut off. His flatemate's hair appeared more grey under the flat's lights, but instead of ashen like it had seemed in Mycroft's office, it now looked like plated silver. Sherlock felt most of his rage stifle itself, replaced instead with a weary kind of resignation.
Sherlock's only reply was to snort, tightening his embrace. His voice was arrogant, but his grip was possessive.

“Mycroft.” The detective breathed, and John couldn’t help but tilt his head in confusion, a faintly exasperated note creeping into his voice was he responded
No stories were whispered.
time you wish.”
A little leverage, if nothing else. Though the army doctor didn't believe in magic, he had trusted his grandmother. Since the world was going insane anyway, it wouldn't hurt to be safe rather than sorry.
for something like that? No. I think it's something else.” She leaned forward then, eyes flicking to John. Beside her, Parylanne chittered in quiet amusement. It seemed her Master's antics were endlessly entertaining to the Dragon.
For a moment, both men were locked in their own private bubbles. Frozen inches away from each other as the soldier positioned himself just in the corner of Sherlock's peripheral vision and waited patiently for some kind of invitation. Polite, this Human was. Oddly so.
John heard all of this of course not until weeks after it had happened, his medically-induced coma carrying him through surgery, fever and sickness so that he would not be in unspeakable pain. He woke to a new age of sorts, and the soldier didn’t admit even to his therapist that to him it felt like a piece of him was left behind in the battle. He was an outlier, not just mentally he would find out, but physically.
The Dragon’s pacing slowed but did not stop, Sherlock’s wings twitching from agitated dull orange to vivid red. His eyes were slitted with frustration, voice lashing out through his thoughts like wickedly sharp knives.
John froze from where he had been in the process of making tea, his hands clenching on the counter in a white-knuckled grip. The thought that he should have
Mycroft couldn’t see it either. When it came down to it, his father was a fair creature by nature. He wouldn’t forbid contact with an entire other species, not if even one required his help. It was an unfortunate weakness of his, one that his mother often managed to curb. Even so, he didn’t think she could do much in this situation. Not with the other tribes also arguing for or against the decision.
He lifted his arms up mockingly, grinning like a teenager, roguish and carefree like it was some sort of amusing carnival he was witnessing. Sherlock felt himself strangely reluctant to voice his observations, feeling as though for once he was the experiment instead of the scientist. Still he could never exactly refuse John, much to his chagrin, even when the person sitting before him was so clearly not the army doctor he knew. They looked at each other, two mirror images and yet so different and at once the same.
A trick he had learned back at home.
the reward must equal or surpass the sacrifice.
what our John needs.” She declared, even if Sherlock was not exactly sure about the validation of said statement. Reciprocity had never been a rule of the universe.
“Like Anderson?” Sherlock couldn’t really help the disgusted note out of his tone as he voiced his question; for him, gaining wealth wasn’t worth spending one more second around Philip Anderson than necessary, his secret paramour was no better either.
“My brother is a category of his own, I’m afraid.” The ginger responded, a lighter tone weaved through the words, amused by the undeniable truth he was verbalising.
He pushed the wooden, rotten swinging doors, and placed one foot in the establishment, the inside equally as disappointing as the outside was. The several tables were crammed with idiots and low-rate criminals, and the bar hosted the most insufferable characters —the ones likely to find themselves the world’s lost wonder. Sherlock pursed his lips in disgust and placed his pale hands inside his pockets to avoid unwanted contact.
However, the other was not exactly in amused spirits, desperately talking and walking towards the middle of the room with determination in her expression. “Have you suddenly gone mad?” Janine queried, “Don’t tell me you’ll stop all this and just turn all feelings and nature on me-” Her hands were now on her hips, framing the pink skirt she was wearing. Her expression was wild, enough to make the other want to gape at it.
“Oh, nothing.” His brother responded, a casual expression over his features while he
“Don’t you ever get bored?” The silver gazed asked, once he had snatched back his
“You can go ahead and keep waiting for that too.” Sherlock responded. His back straight and his slender form towering over the others despite being shorter than one of them.
Sherlock remained perched over the railing, away from the crowd, for quite some time. Somehow entranced by the view of the tranquil waves lapping at the side of the ship. The rebel had always found water a very great source of discomfort, specially in such an endless form as this. Avoiding it as much as he could even when he knew it was absurd. He now found knowing the reason for his aversion didn’t really ease the feeling as he had once thought it would; appearing to enhance it actually. The undeniable reality was that deep waters, specially vast oceans, hid too many unsolvable mysteries in which he would forever be snared by the very same doubts he was trying to escape.
I can't believe we're so close to the end already. Come back next Tuesday/Wednesday to read the final chapter!
,” He said. “You don’t know Sherlock as well as you think.” That couldn’t be true. It didn’t sit well in his stomach. Sherlock had saved them all from Moriarty, even going as far as casting a spell over his own self —that from which he didn’t know he would manage to get out— in order to prevent someone else, someone
James turned around again, eyeing Sherlock in expectation. Focusing his gaze at the other’s expression to recognise what was going on inside his head. The boy’s hand retreated, just a little, but for the older man it was all the proof he required.
“Got it?” Irene asked, handing him the last make-shift sack of colourful liquid to place on the bag. The others sporting varying shades and sizes, ready to launch and attack. Sherlock had thrown in a few of ill-smelling chemicals on some of them —mainly the green ones— and some that produced a bright explosion for emergencies. All in all, they were as prepared as they would ever be to face E. and her crew of idiot pirates.

He wanted to wake up.
For now, it looked like something called
In fact he had become totally unresponsive.
Upon walking in, he was still only half sure that Sherlock actually didn't know him. A part of him wondered if maybe the Detective was merely biding his time, that he would suddenly surprise him with a story about how they had met in a bar on a stormy night, like the beginning of some crappy romance novel. Then the landlady, Mrs. Hudson (
“Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military. But your conversation as you entered the room said trained at Barts - so Army doctor,
“Ah Yes… The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don’t you think? Tell me, what is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?”
Sherlock folded his hands under his chin, the gesture mimicked by the soldier unconsciously later on as Daniel tucked his legs up into the chair and against his chest. It was an oddly childish posture, and part of it was due to the fact that Claude was still chattering away in his ear. Sherlock noted how the man's eyes seemed to drift occasionally from their sharp focus, and his own eyes narrowed in thought. To an average observer, it would look like John was just daydreaming. However the Detective could see the preoccupied air of a person listening to something, or someone. It is an expression his flatmate doesn't usually wear.
John would murmur it to him in greeting, placing down food or drink, subtly reminding the detective to eat. The army doctor was never sure which pronouns to use on these days, but his friend didn't seem to much mind one way or another. Rather, he'd take whichever with a small smile, as if both suited him equally at that particular point in time.
Whatever the reason, he found himself inexorably tempted to catalogue this strange doctor who just walked into the lab looking for a flatmate. His interest had been sparked, and so he begun the task of unravelling the particular puzzle that he found before him.
Daniel sighed in annoyance, letting up and sitting back into his chair, rolling his eyes in irritation.
Sherlock hadn't even been in the living-room to begin with, but he suddenly appeared in a flash, wings flared out defensively even as he climbed over the back of the chair, curling about the rock protectively and all but
The army doctor was frozen, unsure what had set Sherlock off, and afraid to move lest he do something to provoke the Dragon further. He could feel the press of Sherlock’s claws, positioned not all that far from his throat, could feel his friend’s breath, steaming over his skin and creating frost on the edges of his uniform. Underneath, his heart pounded even louder, whirling desperately in his chest and singing with terror. For the first time in a long while, John felt… afraid of the expression on Sherlock’s face. There was… something…
“I’m a bit busy right now, if you haven’t noticed.”
and that's because when you do so, you're hurting everyone around you, quite literally.” John then cupped Sherlock's face in his hands, and was surprised to see the detective's mouth open in shock. With his curls mussed and his eyes wide, Sherlock looked years younger, blown into silence be the vehemence in which John spoke, emotions laid on on the table in a rush that was uncharacteristic of their usual dynamic. The army doctor's voice cracked slightly as he looked down at his flatmate, thumbs tracing the sharp plane of his cheekbones, wanting but not reaching out and closing the distance between them.
Horrid stuff, fruit tea.
Like an
“You might as well just kill me. I won’t listen to anything you want.” John’s voice came out harsh in the darkness, tight and stressed. His strength, no more powerful than a kitten to Sherlock made the Demon feel as if he were holding something infinitely fragile beneath him.
Sherlock for his part was unusually good about being quiet during the day time, allowing John to catch up on some much-needed rest. The Selkie busied himself flipping through some of the books John got him while he had been out, reading up on bees and honey and the effect a queen had on her hive. He was the eye of a small tornado, sitting cross-legged amidst half a dozen scattered books and paraphernalia in beach shorts and a comfortable white shirt.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but after a moment, his long limbs curled around John in defeat. His voice was a low murmur.
Daniel briefly consulted with the rest of the Alters in his head, eyes drifting into the middle distance for a moment before a question emerged victorious in his mind. When he came back, he shot his enquiry at the Detective without hesitation.
John poked him in the shoulder, apologising quickly.
It was a Human, but it didn't sound Human.
Not when Sherlock seemed so fragile and small, not unlike a monster but more like a very young child, alone and afraid.
Not yet.

They all felt it. The shift in atmosphere. Like a drop in pressure when weather was changing, Quick as a flip being switched, the air went from muggy and too humid to cold, arid and stale. Sherlock could
“Well, keep it safe for me. You know why I... what it means to me.”
The fact was, Sherlock's stomach was almost pulling itself into knots just staring at the promising plate. He had the ghost of the flavour still on his lips, and like a particularly potent poison, one taste wasn't enough. He wanted more, and the Dragon realized that perhaps he has been played into a rather genius catch twenty-two. Sherlock peered more closely at the unassuming Human before him, wondering if perhaps he was staring at some kind of strange genius underneath the rather ugly oatmeal jumper in which the soldier was clad.
When the Human broke apart from the Selkie, he found his wrist was aglow. Runemarks hummed under his skin, pulsing bright blue in their radiance.
“Selkies are not the only things that kill in this world. Humans kill too, and yet you do not seem to fear them in the same way. To kill for food, or to protect what is mine, that is my instinct. Other Selkies protect their herds from outcasts, and their children from threats... Yet Humans… Humans kill for pleasure. Humans kill for the sake of killing. It is a concept I do not understand, and an ideal I have no wish to learn.”
“Back in my home country, I watched two siblings fight, once.” Victor's voice was very soft, and he crossed his arms over his chest, armour against some invisible force. “I watched as the older one beat the younger one in public on the street, called him a fag because he had caught him wearing earrings. I was only six, didn't really get it honestly.” His smile was rather embittered, darker. More serious than Sherlock had ever seen before. It faded as Victor finished. “I don't plan on sitting by and watching it happen again. Not now that I'm older. And most certainly not in my own dorm.”

Then, like a licking tendril of heat, sun spread beneath his palm. Fire, humming just beneath the shell. John let out a shaky cry of surprise, the next moment taking Sherlock's fisted hands and pulling them away from their mauling of the sheets. He pressed the Dragon's palm to the shell, crying out a jubilant shout.
John sucked a slow breath through his teeth. Rubbing at his temples and closing his eyes, he tried to dissolve the feelings of murder that coursed through him. Though much of him chafed at the thought that Sherlock perceived Dodge's treatment as “normal”, a larger part conceded, albeit reluctantly, that the Dragon had a point. There would be no outlet for this anger, it would only be left to simmer and seethe, and by extension hurt people around him. Logically, John could understand it. Emotionally however, he would very much like to revert to a grade-school child's mentality, putting tacks in the woman's shoes.
John hadn’t asked any more questions after that, his jaw tight and his gaze turned towards the window and the uncertainty of evening. The nurse had tentatively asked if he had made arrangements with a relative or friend, but his silence was perhaps telling enough. After a while, sensing his need for solitude,  the nurse had gathered herself and left.
Both boys had learned when to notice a rat was curled up and baring its' teeth on their path.

Conversing with someone he wasn't sure if he actually knew, and beginning to sweat because he had no idea what the relationship might be between them if he did know him.

Elena informed John gravely as he plopped the baby-blue woollen hat on her head, concealing the freshly-growing horns just beginning to peek out from her riot of curls. The soldier nodded with all the gravity of a man about to go to war at his daughter, struggling to contain his amusement.
The Dragon listened in confusion to the peals of almost hysterical giggles coming from the kitchen as he dipped his head under the cool crest of water, wondering at the insanity of Humans even as his fever was washed away by the sweet kiss of frozen ice.
on you sometimes! And it's only when people are trying to help you, stubborn...” She continued to mutter in varying levels of annoyance even as she stalked forward, setting herself between John and Sherlock like a buffering device. Her gentle hands crossed themselves over her chest, and she faced the detective as a silently burning flame, quickly dissolving into something gentler when she took in how hard the curly-haired man was trembling. Sherlock stared at the ground, blue eyes flicking at anywhere and everywhere but the two faces before him. His shoulders were hunched inward, as if he wished not to be seen. Like a schoolboy, bracing himself for punishment. In a croaking rasp, the detective muttered something unintelligible under his breath. It sounded vaguely defensive.
thought. Something that was growing increasingly apparent as he realised that his flatmate hadn't yet returned. Fidgeting in place, the detective bit his lower lip as he briefly debated just phoning John. However, he soon realised that the action was bordering on shy and cowardly, and Sherlock Holmes was not one to blush and stutter like some moronic schoolgirl. He didn't care about social norms, being normal was
John licked his lips nervously, taking in the information and feeling in the pit of his stomach a surge of indecisiveness. The weight of responsibility was swiftly becoming a recognisable sensation, yet what was new was the feeling of torn alliances. Sherlock had made it clear, even nonverbally, that there was something wrong with the queen and her Dragon. If his companion were here, he’d already be spitting and fixed for a fight. Yet Sherlock wasn’t here, and he hadn’t come back since last night. The twisting feeling of jealousy, petty and primal coursed through John, and despite himself he felt his jaw tightening. He looked to Mary, and whatever she saw in his expression made a smile quirk on her lips in satisfaction. Her voice was firm.
“What path?” John frowned. The woman fixed him with a mild look, her mouth twisting into a flat grimace.
“In particular, a certain aristocrat’s Pearl was asking after your, shall we say,
John worked to get his cheeks to stop burning, even as he noticed how Sherlock was studiously silent over the course of the exchange. The Dragon's thoughts were low, and it took the soldier a moment to realised it was laced with barely-suppressed rage.
It was well into nightfall when John was finally allowed to find his bedroll and cot. The soldier’s legs carried him, but his feet felt like lead dragging him along. The only thing he felt vaguely aware of was the Northern Dragon walking silently behind him, Sherlock like a wraith or a shade in silence. Under the stars, the two of them found themselves without words to describe how they felt, and without a conscious consent, John found himself wishing he could curl against Sherlock’s chest, hide in his skin and bones and for just one night
remember. That no sane man can have access to.”
“Can't you guess?” Sneak shot back, lips twitching as one knee
“That’s cruel.” John muttered, to which the elder Holmes merely snorted in derision.
Maybe the situation wasn't so hopeless after all.
A sharp spike of something piercing and hot stabbed Sherlock's chest, and he was up on his feet and grabbing his coat before he knew what he was doing, flipping up his collar to make room for his scarf even as his elder brother tried to reason with him. He didn't know why, but he couldn't allow John to be hurt. The thought sent panic washing over him, and Sherlock didn not handle panic well at all. He grit his teeth and tried to dispel it, but Mycroft seemed determined to test him today.
He murmured, and it was not accusatory, merely defeatist. It was clear to John that Sherlock was just as, if not more unhappy with the whole marriage situation as he was. In fact, the Water-Spirit seemed to view John as something like an unwanted pet, and the fact made the young man’s ears burn in sudden shame.
For a moment, the shell remained cold.
When he spoke, his voice was solid, as unbreakable as steel. Sherlock felt as if it was shielding him, stronger than any wings could and any scaled armor.
At that moment, Sherlock’s sensitive ears could make out footsteps down the hallway. Several pairs of feet were making their way towards the room. The Dragon stiffened, nostrils flaring as he took in familiar scents a moment before the feet halted at the door. Sherlock was standing before he had even consciously realised he had done so, drifting towards the door but gaining drive the closer he came. He turned the knob to the door, revealing faces he knew on the other side.

“No matter what you happens, you mustn't let go of my hand.” John opened his mouth to ask why, but the words felt heavy and slow in his throat. It seemed like between one blinking second and the next, the world he knew was pitched forward, tilted so he had no choice but to slide. Slide John did, down into blackness thick and impenetrable. Only the sturdy warmth of the hand looped in his own kept John from screaming in surprise. Together, he and Sherlock tumbled, deep into a dream world, and deeper still into John’s mind.
Claude's jaw tightened minutely, and she stood a
Perfect.
But then again, he supposed that the government didn't exactly care what happened to the war fodder, as long as they took down a few enemies when they finally blew. There was a time when John trusted the higher powers in charge, but those days had ended for him when he was fairly young. Growing up in a slum district tended to make you see fairly quickly just how honest the government was when they were forced to do their dirty laundry.
ticked off in the box, even if it was technically incorrect in his mind. Mycroft had been far less vicious about his disapproval than mummy had been, and part of that was perhaps due to the fact that he had seen his sister when she was alone, when she had thought no one was watching out for her in the vast emptiness of the Holmes house. He had seen the mask of pretend slip from her features, and the vulnerability that both Shyla and Sherlock still worked so hard to hide. Glass walls that at first glance seemed opaque but on closer inspection were as thin as candy floss. As a result, it had been no large deal to have his old name removed,
For one- he looked distinctly more feminine, his figure shaped into that of a woman’s, chest hidden by bandages that also crawled up along his arms and legs- protecting his knuckles as if he were preparing for a fight. The rest of his torso and stomach was bare, but military bottoms hugged his hips, sandy and yellow in patterned shades. His boots were also sand-coloured, fitting his feet and unrecognisable to John. He had never bought them. Never.
Sherlock was still holding onto his hand, and he used it now to bodily tug John back towards the palace. The god’s jaw was set like stone. There was something simmering just under the surface of his expression, and John nervously thought that it had something to do with the storm clouds rolling in on the horizon. They were slate-black. John had the sinking feeling that whatever modicum of freedom he’d managed to earn; he was about to lose.

them. Just in case.” There was something else in those words, hidden under layers of meaning. John saw Rin stiffen minutely and her dark blue eyes seemed to narrow into slits. Slowly, Bill and his Dragon moved forward until they stood on Wilkes' other side. Kate and Irene looked as though they were sizing up the competition before them, standing tall and straight and at attention. In contrast, John noted how his friend seemed relaxed. Too relaxed. His hands at his sides looked as though they were longing to hold a gun.
“You need to eat, and I need answers. I figured killing two birds with one stone would cost me nothing. Now,
John promised himself then that he'd make Sherlock aware of it, if only by pulling the Dragon's lanky form so that his head rested on the soldier's shoulder. Sherlock's eyes were cat-like and wide as they peered up at John questioningly, but he didn't give justification for his action of comfort. Soon, Sherlock stopped searching for one. The Dragon felt his eyes slide closed as those capable, strong hands delicately ran through his curls, scratching just at the base of his horns in such a way that was positively sinful and wonderful at the same time. Finally satisfied that he wasn't in trouble, Sherlock allowed himself to relax into the touch, melting bonelessly towards the comfort like a moth pulled to a flame. Little sparks flashed behind his eyes, electrical pinpoints as John's hands worked his dark hair into some semblance of order, and if the soldier noticed how Sherlock's tail automatically curled possessively about his waist, he chose not to say anything.
One such child, a little girl who was particularly brave, even dared to step forward, chubby hands reaching out in wonder, looking to touch. Her large brown eyes glanced up to John pleadingly, and though the soldier didn't understand the language she spoke, he knew well enough to know she was asking for permission. The thought sent a pang of
The spark of curiosity is there, well hidden under the mask of ice but Daniel sees it nonetheless. For the moment he allows himself a tight smile, the upturning of lips more bared teeth than friendliness.
In the kitchen, his grandmother stood barefoot on the creaking floor, chopping up pieces of onion to put in the massive skillet on the stove. The sharp silver of the knife flashed as she cut, a delicate dance on the cutting board as she looked up and smiled at her grandson with a wide, sweet grin.
this and-”
The man's eyes then flicked to John, and something grimly amused flickered in his irises. His voice called out to him even as he reached, pulling from the pile that was already being depleted by other soldiers a dark green pack. He tossed it at Sherlock's clawed feet with accuracy, shrugging on his own only a moment later. Then he pulled a sand-coloured harness from an overhanging sets of hooks, throwing the first strap onto Soo Lin.
Her voice held in it the promise of a prophet as she whispered to the reflection of her dear, dear son, so often misunderstood. As unreadable as a typhoon.

“Who would want me for a flatmate?”

John didn't comment on how most of the time, Sherlock refused to use the word
with the parcel still gripped in his fingers.
John is just about to think that he may have to come for a second visit, or close his eyes and choose at random. That is until he heard the soft chinking of the Gateway being opened and two men entering the room silhouetted in light. His eyes having become used to the darkness by this point, John squinted and used his hand to shield his vision as he saw the twin navy uniforms of Handlers. They each carried a lead, and on their belts were whips and tazers for good measure. Though they don't seem to be particularly pleasant gentlemen, they did tip their hats to the Lieutenant before completely ignoring John and Mike. Out of the corner of his eye, John noticed a distinct shift in all of the Dragon's mannerisms. Loud noises became cut into silence, slitted eyes widened to take in any small movement of the men as forked and non-forked tongues alike licked upper lips in nervous anticipation. Several of the creatures dove immediately for whatever small shelter they could find in their cages, some of them using their own wings as a sort of shield from whatever pain they expected to come. The two Handlers ignored most of them, and their gait spoke of having a purpose as they unerringly went towards the back of the Kennel, where most of the more dangerous Dragons abode. Neither John nor Mike had dared step foot across the line of Red tape, both of them silently agreeing that they would not find what they were looking for there.
John found himself elbow-deep in blood in the medical tent, his own head injury left untreated as he tried to stem the bleeding from an abdominal wound that had managed to puncture upwards towards the soldier’s lung. Much like the battle before in the aftermath, John felt as if time were slipping and sliding, blurring into a mess of blood and injuries and bandages soaked through with fluids, broken up only by the breaking of bones. The soldier witnessed three deaths that night, and Soo Lin watched with quiet eyes as John at the end of his shift curled inwards on himself, breathing deeply through his nose and clutching at his hair.
Somehow, that thought made everything worse.
His jaw tightens, and Sherlock has left him even after telling him the address of the flat he wants to check out.
Then the two of them looked at each other, blinking in a surprised, blank way until John's features smoothed over, and a rough laugh came from his chest.
John! Multiple personality disorders very
He held his friend like that for a long while, rocking slightly as he tucked the top of John's head underneath his chin, lost in his own thoughts. Some part of him knew he should call someone. His brother. A professional that could better deal with this.
