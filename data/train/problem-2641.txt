Cas had barely been around since then.  He had called them several times to let him in, only to drop things off in ‘his room’ before leaving again.  Dean had snooped only to find piles and piles of parenting books.  There were like a thousand in there.  It made him both want to cry and want to punch a wall.  Cas was reading books on how to take care of their child.  What even?
“When not talking caused me to assume that you didn’t want me to stay.  I assumed that you would ask me to leave.  You did it before. Don’t Dean, I don’t blame you.”
Now that Dean knew, Cas smelled pregnant too.  It was a smell that made him want to get Cas in his bed so that Dean could really mark him…  Be marked by him…  He wished he had smelled it before.
What had those little girls said?  Destiel?  That was dumb.  Sam was probably going to start making Deastiel jokes now.  They didn’t need a couple names.  They could have some kind of happiness together.  Cas and Sam were his family.  He had them both, so everything was going to be fine.
Cas took Dean’s hands and Dean followed his lead.  Cas let go, but Dean whined and latched onto his back.  He buried his nose in the back of Cas’s neck, scenting him.  It was grounding.  He honed in on Cas’s voice.
Cas professed with such sincerity, that Dean felt a flutter in his stomach. Dean inhaled Castiel’s scent feeling home and family and love wash over him.
Dean stared nakedly at him.   Dean and Sam flat out refused.  Dean knelt beside him and kissed his forehead, even as he growled in pain.
“I told you that we are family and that I love you.  I felt their love.  They are family too.  How is it fair then, that I keep them from you?”
Castiel moaned.  It was hard to say when Dean was hitting just the right spot like that.  Dean’s breath hitched and his knot popped inside. Castiel was so full of Dean.  He was so stretched.  Dean came in long hot spurts.  Castiel could finally feel it.  He could feel their bodies responding to one another.  Dean came again and again, whimpering, but refusing to look away.  Castiel guided Dean’s head down to his own neck. Dean sniffed desperately at the scent glands.
His grace began to leak from his mouth, so he shut it.  Dean gave his hand a squeeze and took off.  Sam gave him a quick, one armed hug and an unconvincing smile before he ran after Dean.  Castiel had exploded before.  He had exploded more than once.  Giving birth was apparently a similar sensation.  The nephilim was like fire and grace bulging and ripping from his insides.  It was as if he had to destroy a part of himself in order for he and Dean to create this being.  It was beautiful and sweet and sad and father almighty it hurt.  He was both mournful that the Winchesters were not here and glad that they were not here in case he accidentally used his true voice during labor.  The nauseating pain came in rolling waves, reducing him to a mess.  He screamed in his true voice repeatedly, unable to control himself.  This was truly awful, but he wanted Jack to be free.  He wanted Jack to meet Dean and Sam.  Castiel knew that he would be dead if he were a human. There was too much blood.  He wasn’t human, but he was unnerved by the amount on the floor.  It was as if he had hemorrhaged from the womb.  The stuff was still trickling down his legs.  Jack was clean when they freed themselves.  Their power allowed them to be clean with a thought.  Castiel’s thoughts turned to the threat to Jack just outside the bunker.
He soothed, pulling Dean down by the buttocks, encouraging Dean forward.  The feeling of their cocks together was nice.  Castiel could just lie here with Dean rutting against him all night. It couldn’t last that long, but the ending was sweet.  Dean moaned softly and came against Cas’s belly and crotch.
That eased some of Dean’s discomfort.  He had raised Sam.  He sort of knew what to do when it came to little boys.  He even knew how to change a diaper, feed, and burp.  He’d rocked Sammy to sleep plenty of nights too. He’d never really been a child.  He’d always just been Sammy’s brother-father.  Maybe having a kid of his own was the natural next step.  He’d have to be better to him than Ben.  He’d have to make sure Sam wouldn’t have to kill this one like with Emma.  Fourth time is the charm. He’d done okay with Sam. This kid would be okay too.  Cas would make sure the kid was safe anyway.  Nobody would hurt him with Cas around.  Dean smiled and inhaled one last time before his knot slipped out.  He groaned and flopped onto his back. Cas stared down at him from where he sat.  He had no business being that cute.
Castiel gazed upon Dean’s shoulder.  He had almost forgotten about the fresh brand on Dean’s shoulder.  It was identical to the one he had given Dean when he had initiated the ritual all of those years ago.  Both he and Dean inspected it for a moment before Dean met his gaze.  Dean’s eyes were wet.  Castiel reached out a hand and grazed the brand with a feather light touch.  Dean’s breath faltered for a moment.  His eyes threatened to roll back.
Dean breathed into his ear. He let Cas sniff around for as long as he wanted, all the while insisting that his space was being invaded.  Sam joked that they should get a room and Dean called him names.  Castiel tuned all of this out.  Something was happening to him.  A startling muscle cramp rolled through his abdomen.  His knees were weak. Castiel continued to scent Dean, only twitching when it hurt.  He blinked hard.  He wanted more Dean smell.
“It is a very angelic way of expressing deep devotion. I have to paraphrase.  The enochian used is ancient and does not translate to english well. It goes something like this;
Castiel was not completely delusional.  In order to help Sam and Dean, he had betrayed them deeply by letting Lucifer use him as a puppet.  He had used his mind bunker as a safe place.  A place that held the memory of their scent and kindness.  He knew that Dean would be angry with him.  He knew that, even with all of the bonding and mating, Dean would resent him.  Sam would never trust him again.  Of this, Castiel was sure.  It broke his heart.  Sam was a dear friend to him.  He was the most precious person in the world to Dean.  Dean was everything to Castiel.  It was a vicious circle.  Castiel held Dean tighter to his chest, kissing the top of his head.  He loved Dean so much that it hurt.  He had a feeling that, when it came time to leave this room, Dean would want to go back to normal.  Castiel would go, but he would go with an aching chasm where Dean used to be.
“That's what I’m getting at Dean.  Maybe, when Cas figured out that the nefilim, you guys gotta name it soon so we can stop calling it that- That it wasn’t malicious by nature.  That's when he told you it was yours.  He told you right when we got here right?”
“Cas, I’d prefer to, you know, take my time.  Do it right.  But I think magic and rituals don’t really care.  This is your life. With what I know now…  Cas, I’m more than ‘not opposed’ to it, okay?  In fact, if anyone but you said that, I’d think you didn’t want to.”
Dean had been overjoyed to find Cas in purgatory, giving him a giant hug.  Cas had confided that he had never meant to abandon Dean.  He sincerely thought that the souls of purgatory would want him more than Dean.  He had fled, taking the target off of Dean.  Dean was, however, insistent that Cas accompany him out of purgatory.  He would not leave Cas behind.
Dean went as quickly as he could, while still taking the time to apply extra lube when needed. Being inside of Cas was awesome.  He was so hot inside. Hot and silky smooth like…  there really isn't anything else like it.  Cas made the best little breathy sounds with his deep base of a voice.  He kept saying; Dean… and caressing him in that way that reminded Dean of pure angel grace.  Cas hadn’t done this before, but he seemed to know the mechanics.  His body opened in a way that made Dean oddly proud of him.  Dean knew, from cases involving witches and sex magic, that the spells don’t work if you use a rubber.  He never went without one, but with Cas, it didn’t bother him that he wasn’t wearing one.  They’d given each other a soul/grace bandage. It was the least he could do.  Cas gazed up at him with those big doe eyes, looking like there was nowhere else he would rather be.  Dean took ahold of his dick so as to guide it in. He watched Cas’s face for pain, but all he saw was swimming blue.  Being inside of Cas like this was almost too much.  He had to just stop and hold Cas for dear life.  Cas was covered in a film of sweat.  Cas looped his arms around Dean’s shoulders.  Dean focused in on the feeling of Cas.  Cas was alive.  He was warm, sweating, breathing, and bleeding.
Castiel’s brain wasn’t right.  It was slow and foggy.  All of his clothing lay forgotten on the floor of Dean’s bedroom.  His feet had carried him toward the place where Dean’s scent was thickest.  He wanted to spread himself out on Dean’s memory foam mattress and mix his scent in with Dean’s.  Castiel was unable to stop himself. The drive was too physically strong.  He felt so empty.  He wondered if anything could possibly fill him.  He pressed his front down against Dean’s sheets and wined in distress.  The sheets were only cool for a second.  Cas thought he may literally combust.  It was possible.  It had happened before. Where was Dean? Sam? Castiel wanted a knot. He wondered if he smelled nice enough.  Maybe Sam and Dean didn’t like the way he smelled and he would never be full.  Castiel sighed.  He noticed himself rubbing his swollen penis against the sheets.  The satisfaction it brought was minimal at best, but he liked the thought of his fluids marking Dean’s bedding.  His scent would be in them for months.  Something slippery was slowly leaking from his opening as well.  Cas supposed it was meant as a lubricant.  He had not quite come around to the fact that he may be in heat yet.  He was sterile.  He did not have heats.
Castiel supposed he should feel something like hurt, but he just felt self loathing.  He had wanted to kill Dean’s child because of the way he was programmed.  Then, he let fear keep Sam and Dean from their new family member.  Tonight, tonight he could have killed the little one.  He could have died and their baby could have died with him.  He felt so selfish that it was hateful.
Cas stopped moving, but he was still tense. Dean stroked him at a relaxed pace.  Cas made a frustrated sound in his throat.
Dean and Sam raided the medical supply closet and the cupboards for aspirin, water, and snacks. They weren't even sure if Cas would need them.  Being around his brother was nice.  It kept him busy.  He couldn’t get too excited with Sam smell up his nose.
“The only specific details I know are that it needs to be an ‘act of love.’ I feel that penetration might actually be necessary.  If it weren’t, kissing would have done the trick.”
Dean interrupted.  Castiel’s lips made a thin line.  The look on his face clearly communicated that Dean was lucky he was pregnant because Castiel was done with his nonsense.  Sam didn’t much like Cas’s plan either.
He smoothed his free hand up Cas’s chest, brushing his hard nipples, before caressing his neck.  He applied just enough pressure to get his point across.
Cas maintained eye contact as Dean backed out of his own room.  The corner of Cas’s mouth was wrinkled up.  The corners of his baby blues crinkled and he was all doh eyed.  His body was lax and he looked comfortable in Dean’s bed.  Dean’s knot throbed.
“You see yourself how our enemies see you.  You’re destructive and you’re angry you’re broken. You’re daddy’s blunt little instrument.  You think that hate and anger;  that’s what defines you.  That’s who you are.”
“I mean, that is how team Winchester does things isn’t it?  Hide the facts we find inconvenient and hope they go away?  Cas is part of the family.  The behaviour makes sense.”
“Want to bend me over and fuck my hole don’t you Cas?  Want to get me on my knees sucking your cock?  Maybe you'll let me eat you out first?  What d’ya think Cas? Want you to…  Please say you’ll let me…”
Sam stumbled out and the door slammed on its own.  Dean could hear Cas’s choked cries of what sounded like his name.  Sam shot him another disgusted look and made his way to his room.
Castiel could smell holy oil on Dean’s hands.  He supposed he must have been further gone than he had initially thought.  He simply locked eyes with Dean.  Knowing that Dean would need verbal reassurance, he said.
Sam coughed and aggressively rubbed his face.  Dean couldn’t think about numbers and dates.  It was really hard to focus.
“If there is a nephilim here, which there isn’t, I should be minimally affected.  The nephilim grow their own vessel.  That humanity should, in theory, trick angel wards.  I suppose it may sting, but that is all.”
Castiel filtered through the languages in his head.  They had become jumbled together.  He could no longer tell any Latin based language apart. What was the point?  They all sounded the same anyway.  Dean’s knot went down in record time, but Dean was fidgety the whole time he was inside of Cas. Cas was stuck in a semi conscious state.  He knew that Dean was there.  Dean smelled like he was in trouble.  He reeked of fear, guilt, and there was something deep like a bonding hormone.  Castiel rolled onto his back, begging in whatever language rose to his lips.  He wasn’t even sure that they were all Latin based any more.  He didn’t care.  He just wanted more Dean.  He loved Dean. He loved Dean and wanted Dean to want him.  Castiel begged to be mated completely.  He needed to smell them together.  He needed the chemistry and the endorphins.  He was in physical pain with wanting.  Dean soothed his hands over Castiel’s body.  He was whispering sweet endearments as helplessness oozed into his scent.  Finally, Castiel leaned forward and kissed him quiet.  Dean’s scent changed then.  It became sweet with surrender.  Castiel was able to focus on what Dean said next.
Sam decided to edit that part out of the notes he would share with Dean later.  Sam also decided to keep to himself that he did not believe that Cas would want to kill a baby.  He had his doubts about pre-Winchesters Castiel.  That guy may hurt a child.  This Cas, the one that Sam knew, would literally kill himself before letting an infant be butchered. At least if it were Dean’s infant.
Dean asked.  He was hopeful it was that.  Sam kept looking from Dean to Cas and began rubbing his face aggressively.
Dean murmured.  Cas was not interested in those specific word sounds.  Dean’s hands felt good though.  Dean ran a hand over Cas’s back.  It slid through sweat.  Cas’s skin was extremely hot. He was unable to concentrate on that when he was inside Cas.  It was hot and slick and Dean’s eyes rolled back at how good it felt.  The muscles opened and clenched around his fingers in the most beautiful way.  Dean took hold of Cas’s shoulder for leverage.  Cas clutched it.  He gripped so hard that Dean winced.
Sam could see something dangerous and self destructive in Dean’s face as they prepared for Cas’s funeral.  It was a look Dean sometimes got when he was about ready to do something reckless.  It was the look he got when all hope was gone and he wasn’t sure he wanted to stick around and see what happened next.  Sam would probably have to force him to talk about his feelings later.  Right now, he was stepping up and explaining what you do at a funeral to Jack.  It was so unfair.  Jack wasn’t even a Day old and they were attending one of their parents’ funerals. Dean should be doing this, but Dean hadn’t so much as touched Jack.  He had barely even looked at the kid.  Cas would not put up with this garbage.  He’d let Dean step all over him, but Cas had loved Jack.  Cas’s love had been fierce and unconditional.  Sam’s eyes burned.  He could really use Cas’s help right now.  Sam cried a few silent tears with his arm around Jack.  Dean stood a couple of paces away.  He said nothing.  He didn’t move.  Dean just let one tear leak out.
“That means that we might be a growing family.  You know, I've thought about the idea of getting someone pregnant.  I figured it would be up to them.  Guess I don’t feel that way about us?  Cuz were mated, yaknow?... Guess I’d just about anything for my kid…”
“This injury is to my grace, not my vessel.  Moreover, it was inflicted in the midst of a ritual that was not finished.  Finishing the ritual would, in effect, staunch the bleeding.”
Cas purred.  Dean couldn’t really think he had quite this much come left.  He stopped thinking of caring as Cas’s insides massaged his sensitive knot. It was too much. If his brain hadn’t turned to total mush, he would have been embarrassed at how fast Cas had gotten him to cum.  He whimpered.  Cas laid himself back against Dean’s torso, shushing him.  Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’s chest and rode out the last of his orgasm. His nose firmly planted in Cas’s hair.  Cas smelled like smugly satisfied Omega, needy arousal, and something deeply affectionate.  Dean realized, as he snuffled in Cas’s hair, that Cas hadn’t come yet. That would not do.  He thumbed a nipple thoughtfully, trying to tamp down on the guilt.  Cas let out a little gasp.  His nipples hardened and pebbled.  Dean took the other nipple and rolled them both a little. Cas sighed.  Dean liked that sound a lot. He pulled his face out from behind Cas’s ear and cought sight of his cock.  It was so hard that it curved up toward Cas’s belly and the tip glisstened.  Dean reached down awkwardly and massaged Cas’s entrance.  It was wild to feel it stretched wide around him like that.  Slick coated his fingers.  Dean took Cas’s neglected cock in his hand.
Dean’s soul burned brighter than any sun.  It seemed to recognise him, unfurling and expanding  in a roaring joyous flame.  There were no words for it.  Dean knew him in his soul and his soul welcomed Castiel with profound love.  It opened itself to him the way Dean usually couldn’t.  It was the most pure a declaration could get.  Castiel’s grace, injured though it was, practically snuggled up to Dean’s soul.  Castiel posed the question, not in words, but in intent; may I?
Cas’s brain was clogged by pheromones.  Dean…  Satisfied, safe, post orgasm Dean.  Castiel purred continuously and pressed his lips to Dean’s eyelids, his cheek bones, his nose, and his brow.  Cas held his head in his hands.  He smoothed them over the crown of his head as if he were brushing back hair.  The eye contact was as intense as always, yet the gentleness was almost too much to handle.  His gaze was adoring and tender.  Without breaking eye contact, Cas leaned down a little and pressed his lips to Dean’s.  Dean didn’t move for a moment, which caused Castiel to break away, anxious that Dean had not wanted to be kissed.  When Castiel searched his face, there was desperation, panic, and want.
“I think sex is going to have to be off the table after all.  Don’t come into my room and don’t do anything creepy while I’m sleeping.  Got it?”
Castiel glanced at it.  It was now seeping his vessel’s blood  and grace.  His blood trickled down from the place there he clutched Dean’s forearm and soaked the sheets.   Dean leaned over and yanked his pillow case free of his pillow.  He ignored Castiel’s feeble protests that a turnacuit would not help him.  Dean was a caregiver.  His need to help, care for, and give overrode all protest.  Castiel’s weak grace swelled with love for him.  Castiel pulled him down for a chaste kiss on his lips. They were as soft as they looked.
Sam supplied.  Dean was covering the table with a white length of fabric.  There was something under the sheet.  Sam gulped, knowing who it was.
It seemed Sam had to look after Jack for the time being. He’d already developed a bond with Jack in the womb.  Castiel had allowed Sam to ask as many questions as he wanted. Jack had even supplied some answers through Castiel.  They had asked Sam some of their own questions. They seemed hungry to know the world; eager to live.  They had sent Sam a burst of emotion that they felt for their family.  He’d felt Jack kick, listened to their human heart beat.  It hurt to see Dean withdraw from the child like this.  Cas had once confided in Sam that Dean was having some trouble forming a bond with Jack. Cas had been sure that, once Dean met Jack, Dean would bond with and love them. Sam understood why connecting was hard in this case. The Cas never got an ultrasound.  Dean never got to see Jack grow inside Cas other that Cas’s bump.  Cas insisted that Dean was empathetic.  He felt the full extent of human emotion.  Once Jack was born, Dean would love them.  Sam was not seeing evidence of that.  He’d need to talk to Dean. Sam would probably have to give Jack whatever love Dean couldn’t while Dean grieved.  Then it hit Sam that Cas was dead.  The wing prints outside weren’t from some other angel.  Those were Cas’s wings.  They would have to burn Cas.  Tears pricked at the corners of Sam’s eyes as he rummaged through their cereal stash.  Jack waited dutifully, too close to his elbow.  When he came up with Crunch Cookie Crunch and Cheerios, he resolved to mix them. Jack’s face upon trying the cereal was like a light turning on.
When Dean returned to the basement, he found Cas leaning where he’d left him.  The wound in his arm hadn’t quite closed.
“A long time ago, a ritual caused my grace to bleed profusely.  The old injury seems to have opened up. The attack dog spell may be the cause. It tore at my grace until I obeyed.”
Dean’s mouth was very dry.  He practically flung his clothes to the side and scrambled in bed with Cas.  He barely managed to get a condom on before Cas was sinking down his cock.  His back was to Dean this time.  Dean watched the tan skin of his back ripple over his muscles.  Cas leaned forward, sighing contentedly as he rocked back and forth.   Cas leaned forward and coaxed Dean’s knees so that they were bent in front of him.  Dean felt a little thrill in his gut as the way Cas was handling his body.  He was using it in order to get what he needed.  Cas grazed the soft under sides of Dean’s knees, making Dean twitch.  Dean could practically feel Cas smirking.  He decided that he would have to do away with that smirk.  Before he could, Cas began to ride him in slow, methodical movements.  Dean’s toes curled and his eyes rolled back.  Cas felt awesome.   Dean gripped Cas by one hip and snaked his arm around to stroke his cock in time.  Dean didn’t do much.  Cas all but houled and thrust forward as well as down.  Dean could feel Cas gripping his knees for leverage.  He watched his Cock disappear inside of Cas over and over again.  It was the best sight.  He would not tire of it.
Dean kept having to check that Cas was still there.  Somewhere inside, he was still worried that Cas would disappear.  That perhaps he would fly away or tell Dean that he had to leave and abandon him.  Cas did not leave him.  He sat where Dean set his plate and silverware.  He even wound his foot around Dean’s bear ankle.  Dean honed in on that feeling.  He didn’t want to take it for granted, in case Cas had to go.
A tear fell from Cas’s face onto Dean’s cheek.  Dean wanted to run away, but Cas was on top of him, physically pinning him down.  He also rooted him there with words that Dean wanted to believe, but couldn’t.  Cas stroked his cheek, looking happier than he had any right to look for someone who was crying.
“Maybe you don’t realise this, but you're speaking a language that isn’t english.  Cummon.  Cas…  Why isn’t this working?”
Castiel sat at the edge of Dean’s bed, watching him change for sleep.  Dean’s neck and ears blushed prettily as he shucked his jeans.
“Jack showed us visions of a tear in reality of some kind.  Perhaps a portal, or black hole.  They have many gifts.  I don’t think they know what it means.  I guessed, based on context clues, that it is a portal to another reality.  I told Dean before you got here, that there was a ritual somewhere on how to close such a thing. I do not know it.”
He squeezed Cas a little closer.  He had almost forgotten how nice being tied to Cas was.  It gave Dean a non-girly excuse to kiss him a bunch and pet his belly and draw patterns on his skin.  The truth of the matter was that Dean was a giant girl who liked to cuddle.  Cas loved holding Dean, but it made Dean feel all weird if he didn’t have a good excuse. Cas seemed to be enjoying the attention.  He kept kissing Dean’s forehead and cheeks, because Cas was a big sap. Dean didn’t want to let go once his knot went down.  He held so tightly onto Cas, that he would have been concerned that he’d hurt him.  Dean squeezed him above the bump, so as not to hurt the conscious person who was growing in there.  Cas broke his hold, only to turn over and press his back against Dean’s front.  Dean pressed his face into Cas’s wild hair.  A tear had leaked out when Cas had broken his hold and Dean was ashamed.  The smell of Cas centered him.
Dean stood up and noticed that the bites had not healed.  His eyes stayed on them as he reached over to shut the water off.
Dean’s dick ached in his jean’s, but he refused to unzip them.  He had almost forgoten how intence heat sex was.  He tried to forget that it was Cas, but that was not a possibility.  If anything, that was making it better for him.  Add that to the list of things not to think about or talk about ever.
“Always wanted a family of my own…  Not just Sam, but like…  Mated with kids…  If it's ours Cas, its family…”
“I would, but they’d be unhappy.  No newborn should know that they’re parent died in order for them to live.  They would know, too.  They are extremely intelligent.  We have already learned the english alphabet and I taught them all of our names.”
Cas turned to look at Dean.  It was Warrior Angel Cas now.  He was all sharp edges and hard, glaring, eyes.
Dean could have swore he had just thought it. It just slipped out.  Like, watching Cas in this setting did something to him.  Cas with literal egg on his face all soft eyed and domestic, playing footsie with Dean across the table from Sam.  It was so perfect, that it had made him forget who he was for a moment.  Everyone was quiet for a moment.  Cas just looked at him.  Cas looked and saw and... Jesus, why wasn’t he saying anything?  Then his eyes grew all weepy.  Cas didn’t really do that.  It was shocking.  He didn’t cry exactly, but his eyes were swimming.  Cas gave him a small, gentle smile.
“He’s my friend too.  Also, let's be real, you two have been making googly eyes at each other for years.”
“I need some fresh sheets too. Your arm is gonna stick to those if you let it dry like that.  Cas went without question, allowing Dean to wipe help him sit on the floor and wrap a grey blanket around him.  After changing the sheets, Dean insisted on wiping Cas down.
“You can do it Cas…  You're doing so good…  Fuck yourself with that knot until it feels like it isnt enough, then squeeze the bump three times.  That knot will pop and when it is inside of you, you will be so full…  It’ll feel good to be full won’t it?”
Cas hummed around the balls that were comfortably seated inside of his mouth.  Dean gestured to his bedside cabinet.  Cas knew what that meant. Condoms? Cas pulled his face out from between Dean’s legs with a soft pop.
Dean’s voice broke and cleared his throat. Then he just wrapped his arms around Cas’s waist.  He just kissed him nice and gentle for a while.
Sam was saying something.  Dean didn’t quite catch it.  He kept getting lost in Cas’s eyes.  They were really pretty.
Sam made his way around the table and hugged Cas.  Cas seemed happy to be held.  Sam would ask Dean if he was still cool with this stuff later.
Castiel was surprised to hear himself sob.  He didn’t think it was really that bad.  He tried to care about the scent of Dean’s low grade hurt.
Cas snarked. Dean barked with laughter, even as Sam went silent and Cas pressed his perfect self against Dean’s skin.
Dean practically sat on Castiel, who rolled his eyes.  Dean opened his beer and opened Castiel’s without being asked.  Sam raised his eyebrows as he sat down.  His eyes twinkled.  Dean took a big gulp of his beer.   His ears turned a lovely shade of pink.  Cas took the bottle from Dean.  His blue eyes were fond and smiling.  The angelic voices came out of nowhere.  Cas groaned and leaned against the kitchen table.  His hand went to his temple.  His eyes shut tight.
Cas was looking him in the eye.  He was looking right back.  Cas had a way of making him feel naked, even though Cas was the one who was currently naked.   He was very aware of his dry mouth.  He felt wrapped in Cas’s scent.  He cleared his throat.
Cas sighed, smiling into his skin.  Dean's heart ached.  He knew Cas loved him, felt it in his grace.  It felt different hearing it, like a flood gate was open and Cas was free.  Cas was kissing him all over the face.
Dean was kind of bluffing.  He’d only done this on himself before.  Still, he knew that not right felt like.  Dean’s heart pounded in his chest.  He was breathless.  Cas was stunning.  He had awesome abs and a tattoo that Dean just wanted to lick.  He put that on the list of things he’d do to pleasure Cas. Cas’s cock wasn’t full, but it looked cheerfully interested against his thigh.  Dean squeezed his eyes shut, took a deep breath, and pushed through his anxiety.  He tumbled forward onto the memory foam mattress.
Cas is gone.   Dean deals with it by not dealing with it, forsing Sam into the role of Uncle-father to Jack.
Dean could feel his face heat up.  A massage of the omega’s channel, along with some alpha pheromones and an orgasm usually did the trick.  That meant talking about sex with Cas.
Castiel could smell Dean’s concern and low grade alarm.  He felt an odd bubbling sensation coming from his hole.
Castiel knew that Dean would be hard pressed to say anything like that out loud.  Castiel himself had been pressing gentle sentiments of love and devotion.  Dean helped him back into bed.  Castiel was speechless.  Dean was so good.  Castiel felt raw and a little sore, but it was right.  He pulled Dean down until Dean let himself be kissed, coming away breathless.  Dean was smiling down at him, in disbelief.
Dean’s jaw is set in a dangerous way.  Castiel has seen it that way before.  Castiel remembers seeing Dean’s face like that before he beat Castiel to a pulp in the library.
Dean’s mind was a little foggy from the aroused Cas smell and the mouth that was currently having its way with him.
“There are words read in Enochian.  Then you would take part of your soul and place it over my wound.  The ritual needs two more things.”
Cas shot him a haughty look.  Cas’s chest was pressed to the mattress and his little ass was up in the air.  He had his knees planted wide.  He glowered at Dean from that provocative position.  It was almost comical.
Castiel felt better.  There was some relief.  He still felt dazed and a little desperate.  Castiel was too hot.  Castiel pushed his hips back, seeking the thing that his body needed.  Dean shushed him, running his palms over Castiel's sides.
Dean chuckled, flushing and ducking his head.  Cas had this look on his face.  It was this ‘so happy, I could die’ expression that both made Dean want to run and never leave all at once.
“I think I shouldn’t go into battle for some time.  My grace will need time to replenish.  Systaining my body may require the occasional meal, glass of water, and nap while I am depleted.  Dean, stay close.  It may help if you are near.  My grace is more at ease with you because of the bond.  It may heal more quickly while I’m in your company.”
Something that Jack had said in the Impala made much more sense now.  They’d made this very cryptic comment about how the car was full of memories.  They’d then settled in the seat where Cas liked to sit and just sort of gazed around wistfully.  Sam and Dean had had a very hard time losing their father, but they had been adults.  Jack was a walking, talking infant.  It must be so much harder for them.  Cas had told Jack that he would be right back, that he would protect Jack.  Cas hadn’t come back. Sam tried to explain to Dean that Jack probably needed his father right now, but Dean had shouted him down.
Sam and Dean both prayed for Cas, but Cas only showed up when Dean asked. “Dean and I do share a very profound bond.
Jack exclaimed.  Jack was just so sweet, that Sam didn’t tell them off for talking with their mouth full.
Dean scowled at him.  He also realised that he was so close to Cas that he could feel his heat.  Cas smelled like home and safety and sex.
Dean placed a hand to Castiel’s forehead.  It was a balm to the heat that was slowly cooking him.  Then Dean was gone.  Cas was not fully aware of the unhappy noise he had made until Dean laughed and told him not to worry in a gentle voice.
Cas’s scent was helping clear his head and ease his anxiety.  He all but had Cas pinned to the mattress so that he couldn’t leave.  Dean shifted his weight a little and helped Cas plant his knees.  He didn’t want to squish the baby.  Dean drove in in long, slow strokes, determined to make it so good, that Cas wouldn’t want to leave him again.   Cas kept telling him that he had him, that it was alright.  Then he’d sigh and his back would arch.  Dean bit him over and over again to reassure himself that Cas was mated to him.  When his knot finally popped, he purred into Cas’s ear and gave him a luxurious hand job.  He really took his time, kissing his neck and whispering sweet nothings into his ear.  Dean must have been really out of it.  He wasn’t sure what he said.  Cas seemed to get off on the dirty talk, because he hissed and leaked a small amount of cum into Dean’s hand.  Dean nibbled behind his ear, enjoying the bonding hormones.  The two of them lie there panting for a moment before Cas started to talk.  Cas was always talking.
Castiel felt his face split into a grin.  He was in a lot of pain, but it was always good to hear Dean’s voice.
“Rest up, okay Cas?  Sam n’me will take care of you.  I’ll get the nerd to do a deep dive into the library.”
Cas was looking at him with those baby blues. Dean felt vulnerable, even though Cas was the one opening up.
Dean’s soul in true Dean fashion, tore itself asunder without question in order to mend his wounds.  The strand of Castiel’s grace, still left from when the ritual started, fit itself over the wound in Dean’s soul.  It was as if Castiel’s need to protect Dean even extended to that torn part of himself. Castiel brushed Dean’s soul one last time before leaving.  As his grace pulled back, Dean’s soul reached for it.  It didn’t latch on, but extended itself, as if it longed for more contact.  Castiel knew that that would be dangerous, but all he wanted to do was turn around and envelop himself in warm light.
Dean pushed him away, causing him to grunt a little.  Dean held him out at arm’s length, looking into his face.
“Yes Dean…  You are so good to me.  I have always loved how you smell...  Now rest…  Rest and let me watch over you…”
“You raised your little brother for love.   You fought for this whole world, for love.  That's who you are.”
Dean knew he was wearing a stupid smile on his face, but the snort Cas gave him was worth it.  Cas stilled and Dean slowly applied pressure.  He could feel Cas shaking in an effort not to just shove himself back.  Dean appreciated that he didn’t.  Cas was so strong that he may break Dean’s arm.  It was heaven, having his whole hand inside of Cas.  It was so hot inside of him.  Cas let out a legitimate moan.   As soon as Dean moved his hand a little Cas gasped and his muscles clamped down on Dean’s hand.  Jesus it hurt, but in a satisfying way. Dean kept moving as much as he could.  He spread his fingers out as much as he could to simulate a knotting.  Cas finally, finally came.  His cock twitched as he came all over the sheets.  Dean could swear he heard Cas sob.  Cas’s orgasm lasted for a long time, but once it was over. Dean let his hand sit snugly inside of Cas’s omega channel.  A knot would stay in for a long time.  His hand was pretending to be a knot.  The inner walls spasmed deliciously.  Didn’t remember having this type of sex feel so good to him.  His own dick was crying out for attention.  It was trapped painfully in his pants. His dick would have to wait.  Dean was sure that there was a line.  He wasn’t ready to cross it.  He wasn’t convinced that he would ever be ready to cross that line.  Dean guessed that the average knot would go down in about twenty minutes and checked the clock before pulling out.  A pathetic little ‘guh’ slipped out of Cas.  Dean sighed and stretched his hand and wrist.  His joints popped.  Dean had an almost overwhelming urge to lick his hand clean of Cas’s slick and then he wanted to lick up Cas’s come from the sheets.  Dean’s sheets.  Dean clenched his jaw and resisted.  His knot was swollen in his pants.  Cas fell bonelessly to the side.  There was a little bit of cum still shining on his cockhead.  He still held Dean’s other hand.  He rubbed it with his scruffy cheek and kissed the tips of each finger with extremely dry lips.
Dean’s gasped and his hips rolled, creating friction that made Castiel moan out loud.  Dean sent him a wicked grin.
Dean pressed his eyes into Cas’s neck  so that he didn’t have to show Cas he was ready to cry.  Cas had seen the worst of him, and yet, he still made Dean feel naked.  He scented Cas, allowing himself to be centered.  Cas purred continuously, first gently, then instantly in Dean’s ear.  The kiss was chaste, sincere, and sweet.  Cas held his gaze.
“I’m just saying Dean, it makes sense.  Mates help each other with heats and ruts all the time.  Why is that so hard for you? I don’t know how long he can wait.  I’ll drive out and pick up a couple of fake ones…  But why can’t you just?-”
Cas presented Dean with his shining hand.  Dean shifted where he sat.  His hands went to his crotch.  He inadvertently began to massage it. Dean licked his lips and swallowed thickly.  Cas raised one eyebrow.  Dean nearly tripped over himself to get up so that he could get naked.  He wanted to feel Cas’s skin, his weight, his fingers pressing up inside…  He already had his pants down around his ankles before he remembered.
Dean’s eyes flickered to Cas’s hand and arm.  An ugly roping pink scar had replaced  the gaping wound.  Cas still looked tired and pale, but he’d get better now.
Castiel felt Dean’s penis begin to fill with blood. Dean shifted in his sleep so that their hips pressed just so.  Dean let out a contented sigh and rocked his hips a little.  He pressed his sleeping nose to Cas’s scent gland and inhaled without restraint. Castiel could feel him smiling.
“The omegas who died did so of a combo of dehydration, exertion, and fever.  Apparently, the fevers just kept rising until they just died.  The medical experts have differing theories on it.  Some liken it to the mates of members of the armed forces. The experts hint at it being a strain on the bond.  Some of them say the bond has failed to sever itself. There's a theory that a bond that fails to sever itself becomes inwardly destructive.  Apparently, the heat trigger is…  I don’t know…  normal? But they seem to think that it's the Omega’s body’s way of figuring out if they still have a mate or not.  The lead researcher claims that several omegas who reestablished scent bonds with their mate were healthy during and after their heat.  He observed a sample size who couldn’t reestablish a scent connection for some reason.  Most of them had higher than average fevers and became distressed, but their mating bonds broke and they were healthy afterward.”
Then, Dean, blessed Dean, held his cock in one hand and laid back. He allowed Cas to push back at his own pace, maintaining eye contact the all the while.  Dean’s other hand gripped his hip for support.  Cas slowly slid down, down, down.  Dean was so deep inside him.  He couldn’t believe anything could go quite that deep.  He was so full.  It was glorious.  Cas leaned back for a moment, bathing in the feeling of fullness.  He felt physically complete.  This was the puzzle piece that had been missing.  Cas could feel Dean watching him.  He could hear Dean’s labored breathing.  He rotated his hips experimentally.  Oh…
“So get this, I pulled some old texts, and according to the lore, Angels started out with alpha omega dynamics.”
Cas had sad eyes again.  It was Dean’s fault again.  He didn’t know how a single self deprecating joke had spiraled into sad eyed Cas making untrue statements like this.  Cas seemed to think they were true.
“That doesn’t explain the sudden heat.  I can’t find anything on that.  But this is what I can find. Studies show that Omegas can survive heats alone.  In fact, some omegas do just as well without a partner than they do with one. But, I have read several articles about mated omegas whose partner had died.  In their cases, they either succumbed to the fever, or had to go to the hospital for emergency heat suppressants.”
Dean was glad that the water was hot.  Cas wouldn't feel his tears.  It would mix right in.  Dean didn’t speak.  He was worried that his voice would give him away.
Heat pooled low in Dean’s gut.  It shouldn’t sound as hot as it did, but Cas’s low voice made the words sound sound downright sinful.
Castiel wanted to tell Dean about the child, their child.  He wanted Dean to know how good and bright and righteous they were.  He wanted Dean to know.
Dean couldn’t quite shake the image of Cas begging for one.  What would it sound like if Cas said that word?  Noooope…  Sam gave him a withering look
“Feels so hot and wet and tight inside… Want you to know what this feels like…  Bet you'd like that…”
Castiel searched Dean’s eyes, staring into gold flecked green as if nothing else mattered.  Dean couldn’t mean what Cas thought he meant.  Could he?  Castiel swallowed the lump of sandwich.
Dean went to the bathroom to hit the head and clean off a little. By the time he came back to check on Cas, Cas was boiling in his skin and whimpering. It hadn’t even been ten minutes.  Dean watched him for a moment.  Cas had his cock in his hand and he tugged at it restlessly.
Castiel pulled Dean close so that he could gaze into his eyes and placed his palms against his cheeks.
Dean was still dripping wet and as naked as the day he was born. He made his way around Cas and kissed the bites one at a time.  It was weirdly intimate, having Cas just bare the back of his neck to him like that.  Cas sighed.  Cas abruptly walked away, leaving Dean naked, dripping, and blinking.  He reappeared with Dean’s robe and draped it over him.  Then it was Cas’s turn to kiss him.  There was nothing insistent or urgant about it, but it felt right.  It felt like coming home.  Dean thought that maybe bonded pairs kissed this way after they had been together for a long time.  He and Cas had kinda been this way for a while hadn’t they?
Dean awoke to find Cas holding him close.  Dean squeezed his tighter.  He never wanted to leave this bed that smelled like the two of them.  His knot had, thankfully, gone down.  Dean took Cas’s temperature, which made Cas roll his eyes.  He then looked Cas over, as if doing a health check.  Cas was still sporting multiple bite marks from their intense matings, but he felt and looked healthy.  Dean pointed at Cas once he got to the door.
“That's how nephilim are typically depicted in classic art.  This is just the human side. We don’t know what kind of brainwashing Cas has had to deal with on his end.  They could be telling him that Nephilim will destroy everything if they are allowed to exist. “
Dean has been on super heavy Rut suppressants that John gave him since he was about 21. Now that he's mated to Cas, his body changes its mind. It could have asked him first. Good thing Dean has Cas to help him. Hopefully Dean doesn't say or do anything embarrassing and girly. You know, Hormones.
“I don’t know much about human cycles, but I know enough to know that that isn’t healthy.  We’re probably going to be in here for a while if it has been that long since you had a proper rut.”
Cas pressed a kiss to his shoulder, causing him to shudder.  God it felt intimate.  What made him feel even more naked was the way Cas washed him.  It also made him feel cared for.
“So, this is all just in case right?  Just knock if you need to come in and we’ll open the ward for you.”
Cas made an even more insistand whining and arched his back.  Dean picked up speed, happy to see that Cas was enjoying himself.
“Sure they don’t.  I’ll take that as a sign that you haven’t had one before.  Go lay down.  Sam and I will go get you some things that should help.”
Dean hadn’t had a real rut since he had gotten on the really heavy suppressants at maybe twenty.  He’d have a day or two in the winter time when he just needed to have as much sex as possible, or he felt like he was going to go insane.  Dad had learned from his mistake with Dean and gotten Sam on the same Alpha suppressants just as soon as Sam popped his first knot. It wouldn’t do to have his Alpha boys going into a rut in the middle of a hunt.  They would be unable to think.  John Winchester needed clear headed warriors.  Dean straight up forgot his rut always happened right around this time every year.  He’d just been talking to Sam and Cas about some case, but all he could think about was how he wasn’t touching Cas and how screwed up that was.  Cas was right there; with his stupid deep voise and bed head and thick pregnant scent.  Dean ended up standing right in his space, kind of just, bumping shoulders with him.  Sam was explaining some of the crime scene details and handing Cas the photos.  Dean pretended to lean over and look at them, but all he was doing was scenting Cas.  He couldn’t seem to get enough.  His instincts were yelping for more, please more!”
“Castiel taught me english and Inochian when I still couldn’t live independent of him.  We were working on Latin, but then…  I had to come out…  Do you have anything to eat?  I’m very hungry.”
Dean had explained when the tattoo artist looked unsure.  Jack opened their mouth to protest.  They weren’t a boy.  Sam spoke first.
Dean thrust upward with his hips.  A little choking was fine here and there, but gagging made him feel gross.
Cas let out a long suffering sigh and rolled onto his side.  He took the pills from Dean and drained the rest of his first water bottle in one gulp.  His adam’s apple glistened as it bobbed up and down.  Dean gulped again.
Dean squeezed Cas’s hand.  The guilt welled up inside.  Cas was bleeding out now because he saved Dean.  That was sick.
Castiel was listening, but only by half.  He was much more interested in alleviating his heat by riding Dean like a pony.  Dean loved the animal intensity of it mixed with Cas’s tenderness.  Cas’s hands and lips would latch on and kneed but also caress and nibble sweetly.  One of Cas’s hands had grabbed hold of Dean’s shoulder for leverage while the other hand swiped up and down his chest like he was petting Dean’s beating heart or something sappy like that.  When Cas began to feel the swelling of Dean’s knot, he picked up the pace.  Dean wasn’t sure he had ever been ridden so hard.  Cas was thorough in the way he claimed his pleasure from Dean.  He had a hand around Dean’s neck, just to have something to hold onto.  Dean knew that Cas could snap it in less than a second if he wanted to.  He also found that he didn’t care that much.  Cas wouldn’t hurt him.  The trust was so freeing.  On the next downward thrust, his knot popped and Cas came.  Cas collapsed on top of him, shaking in relief and pleasure. The hard muscle spasms were too much, and Dean came.  He was surprised that he had lasted that long to be honest. Cas’s chest vibrated as he purred, his face pressed up to Dean’s scent gland.  Dean could feel him smiling against his neck. Dean was feeling drowsy from his recent orgasm.  He knew that falling asleep in the nest together would be a mistake.  He had not actually meant to knot Cas.  He had merely meant to fuck him and hold his knot outside of Cas’s body, but then Cas had gone and been spectacularly hot and dominant.  Dean had gone all pliable for him like a damn ragdoll.  His knot couldn’t wait to be inside Cas, who was Dean kidding.  Now they had to wait until it went down.  Damn, it felt nice and snug and safe inside of Cas.
Dean found himself focussed as he instructed Cas.  There was a pleasant heat low in his gut.  He could hear Cas making little hitching sounds and realized, without much surprise. That Cas was penetrating himself now, while on the phone with Dean.
“Sam wanted to check on you.  I wanted to make sure that he made you a kit like you made me for my heat.”
“I was fully prepared for you to pretend that nothing happened.  I was ready to leave…  And then you told me to stay…  To join you in here…”
When Dean woke up, Cas wasn’t in the nest.  Dean’s whole being throbbed with the need to mate.  He needed Cas in his nest now.  Cas had promised.  Where was he? Dean smelled him nearby.  Then he smelled the other alpha.  Cas was talking to Sam on the other side of the door.  Cas shouldn’t be talking to any other alphas.  Dean didn’t care who it was.  Cas needed to get back in the nest right now.  Dean wrenched the door open and growled at Sam.  Sam held up his hands.  Dean didn’t care. He took Cas by the arm and yanked him inside.  Cas kept saying something.
“Humans cannot survive the birth of a nephilim.  The sheer power entering the world is too much.  I should be fine.  I may be weakened, but it will not kill me.  Even if I became human tomorrow and their birth was no longer something that I could survive, I would still go through with it.”
Was all he wanted to say.  Cas rose up again and then pushed back down.  He allowed himself to cry out.  The cry this time was of pleasure. Dean watched him with both hands braced on his hips.  He had a musing, wonderous expression on his face and his eyes were shiny.  When Castiel ground down for a second time, Dean moaned low in his throat.  Castiel fell forward nipping at his stubbled chin, licking at his nipples, scent marking Dean wherever he could.  Dean was entirely receptiv and pliant to Castiel’s whims.  He sucked in air through his teeth when Cas  attached himself to his nipples and tilted his head when Cas wanted at his neck and chin.  Castiel worked him thoroughly.
Cas sighed and shifted so that Dean could see his hands.  One of them showed a thin line of glowing white light, like angel grace was peeking out of it.  The cut was deep and it extended below the sleeve.  It was long, thin, and extended down, from Cas’s palm, disappearing under his sleeve.
Why did he keep saying his name like that?  It was really sexy, but Dean was already attached to him and physical intimacy was the last barrier between them.
“You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of hell…  Knowing you has changed me…  Because you care, I care. I care about you, I care about Sam, I care about the whole world because of you.  You changed me Dean.”
By the time Dean got back, Cas’s eyes were flickering with bright white light and he had burned through his sweat.  It burned to touch him, but Dean did it anyway.  He ran to Cas, calling his name.  Cas turned his head, but made no other reply.  Dean frantically undressed and pressed himself down against Cas, grimacing at the burns.  He parted Cas’s legs, in order to get closer.
“My grace is bleeding out slowly.  If I had a medic in heaven, they could help.  I can’t exactly do that now.”
Dean could see why Cas, who could really be a big girl sometimes, had gotten all choked up about that.  It did seem pretty angelic.  The whole ‘I consent’ thing with shining beacons.  Still, it was nice.
Dean rotated his hips experimentally.  He had to get this show on the road.  Cas gasped.  Once Dean found the angle that made Cas clutch and moan, he took hold of Cas’s dick.  He wanted this to go as quickly as it could go.  This was pretty good sex and all, but it wouldn’t be worth it if Cas died before they finished.  It didn’t take much for Cas to cum, maybe ninety seconds of pressure from both ends. He reached up and grasped Dean’s branded shoulder.  His grace rejoiced at the miraculous reunion with Dean’s soul.  At the touch of Cas’s grace, Dean came embarrassingly quickly. It took him by complete surprise.  The pure love and joy was too much.  Grace and soul curled and swirled around each other as they pressed love, safety, and family into each other.  Dean laid there in a sweaty, sticky heap on top of Cas for too long. He clutched Cas’s shoulders the way he had earlier, during the ritual.  Cas’s grace had diminished, but it was still all Cas.  The damn thing felt like it was trying to wrap around him.  Dean embraced it, embraced Cas.  He held it close and hoped Cas got the message.  He didn’t want to have to say it.  Not out loud, anyway.  He was having a hard time feeling physical things, but then Cas said his name.
Castiel came once on the toy by burying his nose in Dean’s pillow and scenting it.  Touching himself had been nice, but he had been unable to come without a scent he was connected to.  The alpha pheromone in the toy package smelled fake.  He hated that smell.  He was sure that the heat was to blame, but he hated Sam’s scent as well. Normally, he found Sam’s scent pleasant, friendly, and comforting. The only scent he wanted near him right nor was Dean’s.  He wanted Dean’s scent all over him. When the next wave of heat came, Castiel was unable to achieve orgasm, no matter how carefully he followed Dean’s previous instructions.  It was frustrating and painful. He needed his alpha.
Castiel’s big hands krept under his shirt and instantly began to push it up. Cas never broke eye contact.  Not until he reached Dean’s arms and Dean had to break eye contact himself in order to get naked.  Cas impatiently yanked the tie from his neck as Dean began to fumble with the buttons of his shirt.  He could see Cas’s smooth omega cock peeking out under his shirttails.  Dean pushed the shirt down Cas’s arms.  Cas made that awesome growling noise and practically threw Dean onto the bed.  Dean yelped, then chuckled.  Cas was clearly done with being patient. He rolled Dean’s body around and arranged it just the way he wanted.  Dean felt a little thrill at the way Cas was using his body.  Like it belonged to Cas and Dean needed to get with the program.  Dean found himself with his ass up in the air and his chest on the mattress. Cas smelled fantastic and horny.  Cas rubbed his wet cock over the cleft of Dean’s ass, humming to himself.  Dean twitched.  It felt nice.  His body wanted him to chase the feeling. Then Cas pulled away.  It actually made Dean kind of sad. But then, there was a hot wet roughness swiping over his hole. He gasped.  Cas, you sneaky bastard.  Cas licked Dean’s hole, making that pleased ‘hmm’ing sound.  The vibrations were driving Dean a little crazy.  Cas wasn’t even In him yet.  His hole unfurled and allowed Cas to plunge in.  Dean was beginning to pant hard as he pressed his face down against the matrice.  How did Cas even know how much he liked rimming?  Getting eaten out was such a treat for him.
Castiel ran the tip of his finger over the bridge of Dean’s nose.  Dean made one of the faces that he made when Castiel did things he didn’t understand.
“Dean, there has been enough death and sadness.  If we were to make something together, I would not want it to wield the destructive power of the nephilim.  You weren’t there.  You didn’t see what it was like.”
“So get this part.  The third group of omegas who failed to reestablish a bonding connection couldn’t get their fever down.  They overexerted themselves and had to be sedated.  This group had to be put on fluids due to dehydration.  Their fevers spike so high that two of them almost died and one of them did, despite the constant medical attention.  Apparently their fever just kept going up until their body couldn’t live at that temperature any more…”
Castiel had not consciously noticed that he was gripping Dean’s hand until Dean tried to walk away.  Dean looked back, deadly serious.
“Cas’s case is really unusual because humans have never actually come in contact with an angel in heat. None that we know of anyway.  I did some digging because I thought it was weird that you didn’t want to mate him, but you smelled mated.  Scent bonds are a myth.  They come up in classic lit all the time.  People who scent bond are supposed to be meant to be.  In stories with bonds like that, there is usually an alpha and an omega who spend time together and then everyone else thinks that they are mated.  Cinderella and Prince Charming scent bonded.  So did Romeo and Juliette.  You and Cas may actually be scent bonded and don’t know it.”
That was not what happened.  Dean ended up all needy, licking Cas’s torso clean of cum like they were mated and Dean was grooming him.  Then he’d kissed Cas full on the lips with a mouth full of cum.  Cas, the kinky bastard, seemed happy to swap cum with him. Dean then crawled right on down to Cas’s wet, pink hole and greedily licked it open before fucking Cas with his tonge.  Dean stroked Cas’s cock and thrust his tongue up inside of him until Cas came.  The thing about that whole exchange was that Cas had not been sick or begging.  Dean had simply thought that Cas smelled real good and wanted him.  Cas had looked all doe eyed and inviting. Cas was all warm and pliant.  Dean had wanted to touch him, so he did.  Cas was in heat and a little omega channel massage with the tongue never hurt. It didn’t really matter that it did nothing for a really bad heat like this. Dean didn’t think anything of it until much later.  Once he had cleaned Cas of cum (he may or may not have licked it up) and gotten him to drink more water, Dean left for a moment in order to call Sam.  Dean needed something quick to eat, but did not want to take the time to go find Sam. The closeness in Cas’s bouts of heat concerned him.  He knew that Cas would use the fake knot if he had to, but didn’t imagine that Cas would want it after he had had a real knot. Still, Dean needed to let Sam know about Cas’s theory and see if Sam had been doing any of his own research.
Castiel watched as Dean’s ears and neck turned pink and he made grumbling sounds.  Then Dean looked up with a gaze that was almost pleading.
“They don’t have a gender presentation.  They expressed to me that they would prefer They/them pronouns unless they choose a different pronoun at a later time.”
Dean was seeing Cas everywhere.  They weren’t in purgatory any more and Cas was missing, but Dean could see him.  He drank too much and slept lightly, waiting for the purgatory monsters to come for him again.  Then, Cas had shown up for real.  Then he was finished getting cleaned up, Cas had asked, how do I look?  Dean remembered that his dick had told him that Cas looked awesome.  He smelled nice too.
Dean was embarrassed by the whining sound he made.  His tongue pushed through Dean’s clenching channel easily.  Cas’s mouth was so strong.  Dean reached down blindly and wound his fingers into Cas’s thick hair.  He tugged gently, leading Cas away from his hole.  Cas followed his lead, but continued to suckle and lick the skin around the entrance.  Dean whined and tugged again.
“Dean, I may simply hold you.  Please do not go to bed every night thinking that you might have to deal with sexual touching in the middle of the night.  If you do not want that, tell me, or pray if you can't.”
He grumbled.  Cas made a face that made it clear that his love for humanity did not exceed his tolerance for bullshit.
Cas lapped happily at his open, sore hole. Dean blushed furiously.  He’d never planned to do any face sitting, especially not during grooming.  It felt weirdly good and he both wanted to push away and grind down.  He did love getting eaten out.  This was just a new position for him.  Cas fucked up into his open hole with his tongue.  His breath was cool against the fluids that had leaked out, but his tongue was hot and strong.  He hmmed continuously.  Dean was finally relaxing, when he began to suck as well as thrust his tongue in.  Dean was a little sleepy and this felt really dirty, but in a good way. He ground back, sighing.  Only when Cas was satisfied, did Cas lie him down.
Cas rubbed at his neck.  Dean recognised that mannerism.  It was something Cas did when the two of them talked about sex alone.  He hadn’t really figured out that Cas was embarrassed because he had a crush.  That was it though.  It was more than a crush.  Dean had felt his grace.  If Cas was made of anything, it was pure love with all the heartache that went with it.  Cas had been glorious, and joyful, and sweet, and so sad. Above all, Cas had been in a lot of pain, and Cas loved him.  Dean felt the tug to be near his grace, to wrap it up in himself and stop the hurt.  Cas was right, it hurt like a son of a bitch, but he didn’t care.  Cas loved him too…  The caress of Cas’s grace had been so achingly tender, that he’d never wanted it to go.  Cas always had to leave him though, so he’d just let him leave.
Dean insisted that Cas remove his clothes, except for a pair of white boxers.  Dean tentatively wrapped an arm around Cas’s shoulders.  He ran just the tips over Cas’s collar bone and back down to his shoulder.  He wasn’t entirely sure what to do.  Lisa had never really been that into cuddling other than after sex.  That's what Dean was good at; post coital snuggling until his partner had had enough.  Cas was just lying there, allowing Dean to touch him without sex in the imediate future.  It felt really weird.  Cas’s skin was nice and soft and warm.  He held his hands palm up and spread his arm.  An invitation.  Dean had not been held like that in years.  He found that he truely, desperately wanted to be held.  Dean shuffled under the blankets, pretending that it was just another night of rest. Once Cas wrapped his strong arms around him, something broke inside of Dean.  He wined nakedly and pressed himself against all of that skin, so that he was snuffling helplessly at Cas’s neck.  Castiel held Dean tightly.  Precious, beloved, Dean.  He stroked Dean’s back until the whimpering stopped.  Dean quivered and his eyes were wet.
I didn't give this much time in the first bit, so i'm adding a very short chapter.  I wanted something light and fluffy before all hell breaks lose in the next part.
“The Nephilim.  It seems that you were right.  We were responsible for its creation.  I died, but the child healed me.”
Dean knew how it worked.  He had invested in a toy of his own once he and Sam had moved into the bunker.  He played with it sometimes, using the synthetic slick that he always kept around.  It was an omega model. He liked that kind the best.  They were petit and streamline without bulging knots.
His first night in the Men of Letters bunker, Jack discovered that they only needed one nap at night.  They knew that humans slept more than two hours because Castiel used to watch over Dean at night sometimes.  Dean slept anywhere from four to six hours.  The memories that Jack had of those nights were tinted rosie with Castiel’s unconditional love for the human.
Castiel may not last that long.  Just this morning, they had all sat together in a nondescript diner.  Dean had favored him with the fondest of gazes and called him handsome. Now, Castiel was baring his teeth and grimacing as his veins blackened.  Castiel locked eyes with Dean.
“I love you.  I love you both.  You are my family.  You need to keep fighting.  I’ll hold Ramiel off for a while.”
Jack squinted in that way that made Sam’s chest constrict.  They must have picked that one up from Cas.
Dean swallowed back a groan.  Cas had the best voice for sexy moaning.  His name sounded perfect coming out of Cas’s mouth like that.  He was breathing hard and the wet sounds his fingers made as he pumped them were making him all hot.  He was sure that Cas could smell how aroused he was.
“Yeah…  I actually kinda enjoyed it…  You of all people know that I don’t like being woken up…  But I don’t know…  waking up like that wasn’t so bad?”
“Cas…  Between you and me…  When dad was hunting and I was on my own, I spent the four years Sam was in college helping omegas who were in heat. It was honest work.  It paid well.  I got to help people.  They didn’t have an alpha or couldn’t take suppressants. Those who called an Alpha service needed help to get through their heats.  The only help they had was an Alpha for hire. I’m pretty sure I’m an expert on heats.  You're in heat.”
Castiel’s breath caught in his chest.  His ribs were painfully tight, like a cage.  A wretched sob welled up in his throat.  He and Sam clung together, holding each other in their grief.  His sadness was all encompassing.  Now that his father was gone, his brother was gone, and Dean was gone...  It threatened to overwhelm him.  He didn’t see what was left to live for.  Sam was his friend.  He could mourn with Sam…  The hurt was deeper than that, however.  It was as if something had been scooped out of him.  It was as if someone had cut him open and gracelessly dislodged something inside before tearing it out.  Not just Lucifer but something more.  He felt a gaping hole where Dean had been.  Cas’s face felt too hot.  He ached with pure sadness. He pulled away from Sam with some effort.  Sam’s hold was grounding.  Castiel went to Dean’s room.  He laid down in Dean’s freshly made Bed.  Dean had not slept here for some time. Castiel could still smell him.  He baptised the sheets with his fresh tears.  Castiel had wept as a human, but never like this.  As a human, it was messy and wet.  He did not care much for it.  These tears were a blessing.  If they did not come out, he may simply explode with feeling.  There wasn’t enough Dean smell, but Dean would not be back to bring more.  He felt as if he was anointing himself in Dean's smell.   Cas wondered if this grief caused everyone to think so irrationally.
Dean’s voice was thick with saliva and precum.  He liked that it was Cas’s precum.  He liked that he got to do this for Cas.  Dean sucked Cas’s cock back into his mouth and moaned.  He allowed it to go a little further into his mouth this time.  His tongue ran over and over it restlessly.  Then, Cas finally tilted his hips in response.  Cas ran his hands over Dean’s face in a caress that made Dean’s heart hurt.  Cas’s thumb swiped over the corners of his eyes.  His palms rested at Dean’s jaw.  One hand ran its nails over Dean’s scalp. The pad of his index finger traced the shell of Dean’s ear. One of Cas’s soft palms pressed under Dean’s chin.  It made Dean want to take him deeper.  He opened his throat, focussing on nothing but the weight of the cock in his throat and the warmth of Cas’s body and pressed forward.  Cas whispered broken encouragements.  He told Dean that he was amazing and beautiful, that Dean’s body was skilled and that this was the most wonderful feeling. and -
Dean sat down next to him, taking the hand without thinking. The wound reminded him of the times they cut themselves to perform rituals.  Cas let out a little sigh.
“Cas, you know I want you around? Like… If you're powered down and not feeling so hot, I still want you around…  You're more than a vessel Cas.  I-”
This was not a question either.  Sam wrinkled his nose in disgust, shook his head, and continued toward Dean’s room. When Sam opened the door and set the bag down there was a super charged yell.
Dean soothed as he pushed one finger into the first knuckle.  He paused.  Cas’s hipps canted impatiently.  Dean slid in to the second knuckle.  Dean seemed content to stand there and fuck him with one finger.  He added a second one before Cas had a chance to beg.
Jack’s tone was sulky.  There was something distinctly Cas-like about it. Sam held out a hand and helped them up, then wrapped them in his coat.  The kid must be cold.  Sam’s coat covered Jack’s torso easily.
Castiel only remembered this after Naomi’s death.  He did not remember any of his near death experience or the ritual until his memories came back as they were triggered. Castiel had thought that he had gone to that gas station upon receiving orders from Heaven.  He thought that the pain had been from old battle wounds. Naomi had taken so much from him.  So many of his memories were lies. His real memories played out over and over as he struggled with the attack dog curse.   Castiel thought of how his strand of grace must not hold Dean together anymore.  He simply held that part of Cas inside himself.  After all they had been through now, Castiel knew how much he loved Dean.  He selfishly coveted the knowledge that they were partially bonded.  As he sat in the bunker, watching “Netflix.” He felt that old wound open and began to seep again.  He couldn’t go to heaven for medicine now.  Many of the angels would let him die if they know.  At least it was a slow bleed this time. He had time to think of what to say to the Winchesters.  He had time to plan how he was going to say what he needed to say.  He thought of returning Sam’s calls, but picking up the phone was simply too much effort.  When Dean buzzed him, he mustered up the energy to pick it up.
“I’m not sure how it works…  I do know that your body doesn't open the way mine does. I must say, I am surprised…”
Then he was kissing Cas, really letting himself relax.  He really wanted to just feel Cas.  Cas had been so close to death.  Dean wanted his weight.  He wanted to feel that vibrating purr Cas let out when he was pleased. Dean wanted to feel Cas so deep, that Dean would be reminded that he was alive for days.  Dean had never done this, but he had thought about it.  He hadn’t been able to trust someone enough to allow himself to be that vulnerable.  He allowed Cas to use his weight to push them into a lying down position.  Cas could easily just hold him down like this.  It wouldn’t be any effort.  Dean imagined that lean, muscled body between his thighs and whined.  Cas drew back.
Dean found himself scratching the back of his head.  The tips of his ears down to his chest burned pink.  For once, Cas wasn’t giving him sad eyes.  Cas was smiling.  Cas had really nice gummy awkward smiles that made Dean’s chest feel weird.
“Sam is getting you the rest of what you need.  It isn’t ideal, but you’ll feel a whole lot better.  How you feeling?”
“Dean…  you don’t have to let me do this…  Souls are very volatile.  Yours is especially powerful.  It will be painful and invasive.”
After grousing that he was not a ‘little spoon.’ Dean allowed Castiel to spoon him.  Castiel just wanted to put a hand over Dean’s heart and Dean had needed to feel like he was putting up a fight.
When his knot finally went down enough, he slipped out.  Cas gasped deliciously.  He was drooling all over himself.  Why did Dean like that so much?  He was about to lean over and grab a tissue for Cas, when Cas pulled him even further up the bed.
When Dean heard him, he came inside quickly and closed the door.  He made Castiel take more useless aspirin and drink more pointless water.
The Cas shaped nothing stood like a statue for a moment before dropping the angel blade.  Cas cupped Dean’s face in his hands.  Dean instinctively flinched away.  He needn’t have worried.  He had been healed.  Cas’s blue eyes were wide and frightened.
As soon as Dean closed the door he ravenously sucked the Slick from his fingers.  It had chilled but his fingers had kept it warm enough to where it still tasted fresh and alive. He whimpered around his fingers.  He knew it would be a mistake to taste Cas.  He was right.  Now he knew how good it could be.  Cas tasted like a fresh garden, a light floral sweetness, honey, and ground coffee. Dean knew that he had to get out of the hallway before Sam smelled him.  Dean snuck his horny alpha ass to the laundry room and locked himself in. Once inside, he slid his jeans and boxer briefs down and took hold of his knot with his slickened hand.  Again, he knew he shouldn’t be doing it.  He knew that once he felt it and smelled what they were like together, he would be spoiled.  Again, he was correct.  His scent, worn out leather, engine oil, and hot eggs and bacon mixed with Cas’s freshly-brewed-coffee-on-a-deck-out-in-the-woods-after-a-storm scent.  It was perfect.  It was like having morning sex and then making breakfast and coffee together.  It was like having that coffee outside on the porch while they held hands.  Like trading kisses with someone with thick stubble and coffee breath.  These pictures were sweet and domestic.  Cas arching his eyebrow over a mug and playing with the rings on Dean’s hand.  Cas had really nice hands.  Dean came without much warning.  His come mixed with the slick in his palm.  He had been close for a while.  He supposed this shouldn’t be surprising.
Sam was right.  Castiel still had a gaping wound from his palm, to past his elbow.  It was leaking less grace, but the bleeding would resume soon, if they didn’t wrap this up.  A part of him resented Sam.  He had been enjoying this closeness with Dean.  He knew, for sure, that Dean’s soul loved him.  While Castiel was busy thinking, Dean let out a huffing sigh, grabbed Castiel’s face, and kissed his mouth.  It was a rough, hungry kiss.  Castiel froze in shock before melting into it.  He felt starved for Dean’s effection.  Dean deepened the kiss.  Cas allowed himself to taste each molecule.  He loved each one.  Sam infuriated him again by coughing.
“Dean, I wanted to talk to you while I am of sound mind.  Please do not come in while we are talking.  I am not sure what I may do.”
Dean yelled goodbye into the phone before he hung up, hot in the face.  Cas was silent for a moment.  He wasn’t relaxed any more.  His muscles were hard and rigid.  Dean found himself running a hand over them to see what they felt like.  Cas had soft skin, but he was firm.  It was nice.  Dean wanted to stay in bed with him forever.
“You don’t understand.  It cannot be ours.  Nephilim are forbidden.  They have been forbidden since the great flood.  Fallen angels took a liking to the daughters of man and created Nephilim.  Nephilim were giant monsters who terrorized earth.  Between us, they were maybe only as tall as Sam, but humans were much shorter in those times.”
Castiel wrote down the enochian that Dean needed to say and the sigils that they needed to paint on each other before they got started. The three of them gathered in the basement. Sam brought the holy oil and Dean told him to shut up for some reason.  Castiel wasn’t sure it was warranted.  Sam hadn’t been saying anything.  Sam insisted upon staying.  Castiel told him he wasn’t sure that that was for the best.  Souls were highly combustible, after all.  Sam told Dean, with a twinkle in his eye, that Cas would be gentle.  Dean proceeded to call Sam a bitch.
Dean took a steadying breath, which he shouldn’t have done.  The scent went straight to his cock.  Still, he picked up a water and made his way over to his bed.  Cas looked real pretty in his bed…
Sam was right.  It was taking too long.  Cas had been whimpering and his distress had leaked out into the hall.  Dean had almost gone to him and offered to ease the pain.  Cas had hurt him a lot, but he had done it to help.  Dean didn’t forgive him.  Not by a long shot, but there was a bond there.  He hated to hear the broken sounds of pain and frustration.  He wanted to hold Cas.  He wanted to taste his skin to get that slick in his mouth.  He wanted to push into Cas’s hole and watch his eyes go soft and wide.  He wanted to turn those sounds into pleasure sounds.  Dean locked himself in the shower room and tried to scrub Cas’s dizzying scent off of his skin.  Dean couldn’t help but remember the sight of Cas’s pretty omega cock, wet with precome.  The sweat and slick glistened off of his tanned skin.  His dick, which was half hard from the smell of Cas in heat, perked up at the thought.  He groaned.  Sure, he’d found Cas attractive before.  Jacking off to him felt wrong.  He had done it before while in rut.  Dean had some very well flushed out fantasies of Cas left over from his ruts.
Dean was startled by the earnestness in his little brother’s voice.  Sam  was giving him puppy eyes.
“When have you ever indicated that you may be interested in me romantically Dean?  I bound myself to you through my actions, but…”
When they got to the shower room, Cas made to go to a different shower.  Dean pulled Cas in with him.  Cas went without protest.  He reached up to touch Dean’s chest, but hesitated.  His eyes were all big and hopeful and sad.  Dean pulled him in under the hot water.  He wanted to kiss that look off his face.  There was a beat where Cas was limp, then he pulled Dean forward and hugged his around the shoulders.  The water made it hard to breath. Dean broke away gasping.
Dean did not like the way he smelled, Castiel’s heat addled mind supplied unhelpfully. If he couldn’t have Dean, he didn’t want a knot at all.  His whole lower body throbbed painfully at the thought of taking any other knot.  He balked at the thought.  He curled up in a ball of naked angel flesh. He felt weak and shaky.  The muscles in his channel were clenching on nothing.  His dick hurt from how hard he was and how long he had been hard.  Someone was making a pathetic muling sound.  A pained whine that made his headache.  He was so wet.  When he moved his legs, they slid through a slippery substance.  The whining, and the wetness were both coming from him.  If he was in heat, this would track. His mind slipped to what Dean’s knot looked like. He knew what Dean looked like naked.  He had put Dean’s body back together after Hell.  He had not seen Dean’s knot, engorged with blood, swollen and pink.  Full…  He wanted to be full…  Castiel couldn’t stop himself from crying out, from the emptiness. The emptiness was painful.  He was so hot.  He was burning.
Dean placed his hands on either side of Cas's face and forced eye contact.  It wasn’t hard. Cas let himself be guided.  They just stood there, breathing each other's damp air.  Cas didn’t move.  His eyes were so big and blue and soft.  Dean had seen them sharp and hard, but not when they were directed at him.  Not now that Cas was himself.  Dean heard himself make a whimpering sound but couldn’t bring himself to be embarrassed.  He surged forward and kissed Cas on the mouth.  Cas’s lips were both wet and chapped. Dean tried to tell Cas that he needed to stay because I love you damnit. He kissed Cas again and again, nipping his lips, tasting them with his tongue.  Cas was really quite a good kisser, but it was Dean’s turn.   Cas was grinning. He was trying to say something, but Dean was determined to silence him.
Cas and Dean said nothing.  Castiel simply took Dean’s hand and held it.  He sipped his coffee and played with the rings on Dean’s fingers.  Maybe this was what Dean’s life had needed most. Maybe the three of them with their weird little family could find some kind of happiness.
Dean insisted.  Cas gave him sad eyes.  He Cas gave him sad eyes.  When Cas gave him sad eyes, it was usually his fault.
Sam cried out, causing Castiel to spring to action.  He had promised Dean that he would protect Sam.  How could he be so stupid?  His blade was in his hand in no time and he was at the stairs before he registered that Sam was fine.  He was alright and he had his arms wrapped around…  Dean?  Castiel smelled him before he saw him.  It made him dizzy and he had to grip the banister hard to steady himself.  He smelled like engine oil, a home cooked breakfast, patent leather, and something deeply human all rolled into one perfect scent.  Dean glanced down at him and smiled.  Castiel was too shocked to smile back immediately.  Dean broke from Sam and sprinted down the stairs.
Dean scented him steadily until his breath evened out and his form relaxed.  Castiel stared at the ceiling.  He would have found this boring except for the fact that this was Dean.  Dean was never boring.  He savored Dean’s warm humanity, his scent.  He really was quite beautiful.  Unconscious Dean was one of his favorite states of Dean’s being.  It made him so, so very happy that Dean could rest and that Castiel could help him have good dreams.  There was something else as well.  It was decidedly less innocent.  It was the way Dean’s muscles rippled as he turned over.  It was the softness of his breathing and the pliability of his limbs.  It was the way that his knot would engorge in the early hours.  The scent of Dean, arousal, and sleep mixing together were incredibly tempting.  Dean had seemed perfectly happy to have Castiel lick him awake the other day, but would he be alright with something like that now?  Dean had given his consent, so maybe… Speaking of-
Finally, Cas met his gaze.  Cas’s eyes were so soft and content, that Dean just didn’t say anything.  It was taking a long time for his knot to go down.  Cas’s throat muscles kept flexing and his tongue didn’t seem to want to stop moving.   Cas would stay still for a long moment, then he would swallow and Dean’s knot would stay where it was.  Dean kept panting and running his hands through Cas’s hair.  Cas blinked slowly up at him.  His baby blues were so pretty.
“You are the most caring man on earth.  You are the most selfless, loving, human being I will ever know.”
Dean’s voice cracked and wavered.  Cas locked eyes with him before rolling his hips sinfully.  Dean made a noise he didn’t know he could make.  The friction… The heat and smoothness of Cas inside him…  The slick…  Cas set a slow sensuous pace, watching Dean’s face the whole time.  He told Dean that it was the most wonderful feeling.  He praised Dean for opening up so well.  He told Dean that his body was perfect.  Cas then proceeded to grab Dean’s hips and ‘please Dean please may I go faster?  May I use your precious body harder?’  That seriously did it for Dean, who just nodded really fast.  Cas applied more slick and slammed in.  Cas was petting his chest and his hair, but fucking him hard and fast.  As it turned out, that's how Dean liked to be fucked.  He clamped his arms and legs around Cas and howled eloquent encouragements such as: fuck yes, and oh yeah.  Cas couldn’t last, even with his angel dick.  He snarled and came, deep inside of Dean.  His hips stuttered a couple of times until he slipped out, trading sloppy kisses with Dean.  Cas rolled off of him but beckoned to him.
Cas took the water and drank most of it in one go.  He came away panting.  Dean tried and failed not to watch him.  His throat was exposed and water dripped down his chin.
Castiel’s grace pulse pulsed with love and longing for Dean.  it stretched out, reaching for him.  The sensation of Dean’s rough hand on his penis was a pleasurable edge.  Castiel was lost in a warm feeling of Dean’s soul, just out of reach, the teasing of his hand, and Dean’s eye’s. The cold, wet finger against his hole startled him out of his trance.  Castiel felt his body jump involuntarily.  His muscles clenched. Dean’s eyes went wide and he pulled away.  Both of his slick hands went to Castiel’s thighs and he stroked them.
Castiel chose to simply let Dean clean him up again.  There was no point in reminding him that he didn’t have to.  Grooming was an important mental part of human mating.  Damn if it didn’t feel nice to Cas as well.
“Right now we’re walking to my room.  I got the stuff we need in there.  You can sniff me all you want in there Romeo.”
Castiel felt cored.  His body’s resources had been depleted. He was unsure if he could stand.  Castiel stood slowly on wobbling legs. He had to help Sam and Dean.  He had to keep Lucifer away from his child.  He felt that his insides and grace had been torn asunder in Jack’s wake.  It hurt in a new and different way.  No wonder human mothers of the Nephilim couldn’t survive delivery. He hobbled up the stairs and forced his body out through the portal.  There was still a little time. Dean and Sam whirled around.
Cas was giving him one of those smiles.  The smiles where he wrinkled his nose and squinted his eyes that made Dean’s stomach jump around.
Dean stopped outside of his room and stilled, breathing deeply to center himself.  He had done this before.  He could do it, but he had not been quite so invested.  Once he smelled Cas’s heat, his dick would probably be able to perk back up and then they’d be in business.
Dean’s instinct in this situation was to get out of it…  He was tied to Cas and hadn’t asked if Cas could heal if he pulled his knot out.   Even if he could, Dean didn’t want to hurt his hole, especially not while he was pregnant like this.
“You felt it right?  I felt yours.  When I touched your grace?  You know I uh…  That I love you too Cas.  You know that right?”
Castiel blinked.  Dean’s face was very close.  He had stopped reciting the enochian incantations.  One of Dean’s rough hands cupped Castiel’s cheek.  The other rested just behind his ear.
Sam and Dean arrived at the bunker late that night to find it silent. Dean didn’t like it.  Cas had sounded off on the phone.  Of course, he and Sam had been worried about Cas since he’d had to start recovering from Rowena’s spell.  It had only been a couple days, but Cas had sounded downright sick when he’d called.  They found him in his room, wrapped up like an angel burrito in blankets that Sam and Dean had given him.  He clutched an empty mug and squinted at Sam’s laptop like it contained some great cosmic puzzle.  It sent a weird feeling through Dean’s chest, which scared him, so he shoved it away.
“When I said “yes,”  I thought that it would be the only way that I could help you.  I thought that you didn’t need me.  I had decided that  I was of no use.  My body could be used for something that could save you and Sam.”
Cas nodded, so Dean ran to the bathroom in his bathrobe and bare feet.  Sam could shut his mouth.  Dean really really had to pee.
Dean picked up the cooler where they had placed Cas’s supplies and made a lot of ‘I’m picking up heavy things’ noises. It had the desired effect of shutting Sam up.  Sam made a face that could curdle milk.
Cas stood and unbuttoned his pants.  He toed off his shoes and let his slacks and boxers fall to the floor.  Cas locked eyes with Dean’s and held his gaze.  His hand wandered back as he collected the slick dripping from his hole.  He couldn’t resist slipping the tip of his finger inside.  Cas let out a contented sigh.  He watched Dean’s eyes go wide.  The scent of his arousal was mouth watering.
Dean supplied uselessly.  He turned his head so as to get a good view.  Cas was watching him intently.  Of course he was.  His blue eyes were sharp and dark.  Dean smelled his pleasure.  He smelled like a low grade heat.  Cas mostly smelled of arousal, happy omega, satisfaction, and that Cas smell that Dean knew very well.
He came crashing back to his human body.  Cas’s cum was cooling between them.  It was gross and sticky.  Cas smelled good though, like sweat and sex, and Cas.  His scent mixed with the coppery tang of his blood.  It wasn’t exactly unpleasant.  Dean pulled back, wincing as his dick slipped free of Cas.  Dean leaned over, reluctantly letting go of Cas to grab some tissues.  Cas was watching him with the smallest of smiles and half lidded eyes.
The muscles of Castiel’s thighs loosened.  He was so tired.  His grace was beginning to slip away again.  They were wasting time.  Dean was taking such care.  He longed to touch Dean’s soul again, to curl around it, to burrow into it and snuggle in. Guilt lodged in his throat.
Dean didn’t even understand the words coming out of Sam’s mouth.  He stared at Sam,  over the cooler of heat supplies.
“If it's painful, Cas.  It's not really supposed to hurt your asshole, okay?  It's only supposed to burn in the beginning when I stretch your muscles out.”
He felt cold and was getting a bit dizzy.  He had to blink to see clearly.   That wasn’t good.  Castiel could feel their grace, the Nephilim’s.  They were confused and alarmed.  An infection flooded his veins.
Castiel felt his face heat up even more.  He had not been sure that that had been a possibility.  So that is what Sam and Dean had meant.  Castiel still wanted Dean’s dick very much.  He wasted no time in climbing over Dean’s vulnerable body and scenting him.  He honestly needed the scent.  His body was already beginning to relax.  Cas buried his face in Dean’s neck and nibbled at it.  Dean made lovely noises.  Little gasps that made Cas grin and grind their cocks together. It wasn’t enough for his body though.  Cas found himself curled around Dean’s torso, whimpering. It disturbed him that a physical pain could affect him like this.
It was Dean’s turn to hide in the library.  Cas had given him a lot to think about.  Sam and Cas sat together in the war room while Cas tried to get him up to speed.
Dean pushed the door open wide enough to set down the cooler.  He wanted to hold his nose.  Cas’s scent was incredible and intense and wow.
Dean asked him in his infuriatingly lovable way, what they could do.  Once you get back. I’ll explain.
Castiel had been able to sense Dean outside of the door for a few minutes now.  He could smell Dean too.  Dean had had an orgasm without him.  That was irritating for some reason.  What irritated him more was that Dean just stood there.  Castiel could feel cramps rolling through his abdomen.  The muscles in his channel clenched unhappily around his fingers and his penis wept bitterly.  Dean was right there.  Dean was infuriating.
When he returned from his mission, he had to go to Heaven’s medics immediately.  What he’d had to do in order to hold the Dean’s soul, patch it up, and return it to its body had hurt him deeply.  He still felt the ache sometimes, deep in his grace, when he was with Dean Winchester.  The thing that Castiel had had to do was trigger magic from an ancient Enochian mating ritual.  Dean’s soul had been horribly damaged.  To return it to his body now would break him.  The ritual was quite simple, Castiel would amputate a part of his grace and leave it in Dean’s care.  This would act as stitches for Dean’s soul.  Dean would then leave a shard of his fractured soul with Castiel.  Castiel never thought to take any of it for himself.  Dean’s soul must be whole.  He knew this instinctively as soon as he wrapped himself around the thrashing thing.  It was too good, too righteous, for him to keep a piece of it without Dean’s express consent.  The magic surrounding the ritual dictates that the ritual must be completed.  If not, the incomplete partner shall suffer. Castiel didn’t know the specifics on what that meant, but upon his return to heaven, medics had been dispatched in order to repair his wounded grace and hopefully perform some sort of meracle. His grace contorted and bled on the floor of heaven’s medical offices. He had come close to death more than once since his arrival.   The medical officers hadn’t thought that he would have the strength to fly away, to contact Dean.  His whole being needed to be near him.  It needed to be near his soul. He didn’t want to complete the ritual.  There Dean was too fragile and precious for that.  Not to mention, heaven did not want him forming emotional bonds. He just wanted Dean to know that he was Castiel.  They had met in hell.  Castiel had pulled him from perdition.  Castiel literally held his soul together now as it healed.  He had hoped that maybe Dean, as a vessel, would be able to hear him, see him… When Dean had screamed and covered his ears, Castiel had let himself drift back to heaven.  His grace hemorrhaging out on the floor once again.
“Dean, Cas thought you were dead.  I saw him.  He was really upset. Up until a few minutes ago, I thought it might be pining.”
Cas’s scent was stale here.  He had not been here today.  He had not been here in a while actually.  Cas’s scent led him to a partially open door.  Dean’s door.  The scent coming out of his room made him want to find the source and lick it all over.  In his heated mind, Cas had chosen his room as a nest.  Dean bit his lip.  In ancient times, an omega in heat would choose an alpha mate by waiting in their den.  The scent would draw the alpha in.  If they smelled good to each other, it meant that the two were chemically compatible and they would mate.  There were cases where alphas had sent omega’s away and the omegas had to wander from den to den to find an alpha to take them.  This system was dangerous.  Sometimes, Omegas would be left outside overnight because nobody found their scent appealing.  These Omegas were often hospitalized for injuries inflicted during a public and unwanted claiming.  Sometimes they would be found in the morgue after being raped and left to die.  Times for Omegas were much better now.  They didn’t need to be claimed if they didn’t want to.  Heat suppressant and birth control prescriptions were available as well as gland clogging deodorants and lots of different kinds of condoms. There was pressure by society to be claimed and have children, but modern omegas did not have to.
Again, Cas patted his chest.  Dean didn’t so much sit as kneel.  He had some idea of what Cas was planning.  He was correct.  Once he was settled, Cas took his hips and pulled him down toward his face.  Dean gasped and braised himself against the wall.  The warm, soft slickness of Cas’s mouth slowly enveloped Dean’s alpha cock.  Cas pulled him forward by the ass cheeks, forcing Dean to impale Cas’s face with his dick.  Dean trembled steadily. He shut his eyes tight and just let the feeling of Cas’s mouth wash over him. Cas pulled forward until he was fully sheathed.  His throat fluttered gently around the head.  Then Cas’s throat worked and he swallowed hard. God, he had no gag reflex. Dean’s hips moved in minut, restless thrusts inside of Cas’s mouth and throat.  It was so good.  He wasn’t going to last.  Dean tried to pull back, but Cas made a humming sound and locked Dean’s legs in place with his biceps.  One of his hands wandered from Dean’s cheek and his finger slid into Dean’s ass easily.  Dean made a wounded sound.  Cas’s thick finger slid inside easily, using his own slick and cum as lube.  The smell was something else.  It smelled like Cas’s orgasm, his slick, his cum, his contentment, and Dean’s arousal.  Cas smelled like he could just lie there and let Dean fuck his throat all night.  He seemed pleased.
Dean sounded reasonable, but Castiel could smell him through the smell of blood and infection.  He was frightened and worried.  Sam smelled concerned and upset.
Sam then took the phone from Dean and proceeded to recommend some “less trashy” things to watch on netflix.
“That’s it Cas.  Take what you want.  Shit…  You are so wet for me…  Do you know how fantastic you smell?  You have no idea what you do to me…  Damnit you’re so pretty around my hand like that…  You like that don’t you?  Bet you love being all full…  Seriously you are gorgeous right now…  How do you even smell this good?  I’m so hard right now…  I bet you can smell how hot I am.  That’s for you Cas…  Gonna pop a knot in my jeans because of how good you are…”
“So what you're saying is that you went into heat and it kept getting worse quickly.  The only thing that made it better was a mating bite?”
Castiel was chugging yet another water when the door cracked open and he smelled Dean.  He swallowed the water in his mouth and whined loudly. His hole was aching from his frustrated atentions and his whole body hurt.  He was thirsty, which was different for him. All he wanted was Dean.  He wanted to smell Dean and hold Dean and touch Dean.  He wanted to let Dean do things to him.  He wanted to know what Dean tasted like.  Dean slid sideways into the room and shut the room.  He sat down next to Cas, offering him a sandwich.  Castiel took it and wolfed it down, ignoring the awkward shape of the molecules.  His body appeared to want food.  He heard Dean chuckle, a sound that made him happy.
Dean found himself whispering into Cas’s ear. He dragged his fist over Cas’s cock, enjoying the warmth and weight of it.
“When I thought you died... my body began to show biological symptoms that I now believe to be related to pining.”
“The child.  They’re grace just whollupped mine. They kicked me at the same time.  Would you like to feel?”
