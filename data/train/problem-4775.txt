“Uh,” Dean blinked a few times as though to rid the fog from his brain and return to reality, his eyes never leaving Castiel’s. He scratched the back of his head and huffed. “Yeah, a long time ago.”
“No Dean.” He was laughing again. “I’m not sure where you learned your deduction skills, but you should probably consult Sam for some help.”
“Go get him tiger!”
Love you guys and keep on sending me that wonderful feedback! :D
“…Dean.” It was all he could get out, his breath hitching.
“Castiel?”
“And he’s a nerd too, I figured you two would get along.” He took another swig of his beer before continuing. “At any rate, we’re not friends.”
If this were the first time Castiel has ever been here, he would have been completely turned off and asked Sam to either go somewhere else or take him back home altogether. But he’s been here before, a couple times, so he wasn’t at all put off by the rowdy biker group across the way. The friendly wait-staff and delicious burgers more than made of for any disconcerting riff-raff, it’s just been an incredibly long time since he’s been. Besides, Sam did allow Castiel to pick the place.
Dean pulled up the quote on the computer there and typed in a few things. “Your total is going to be $197.85.”
Though I would be lying if the comments didnt make me nervous XD
Gabriel recoiled, a look of regret on his face. He nodded in understanding. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it…He’ll be here though. Just…He hasn’t seen you in a while, maybe he’s changed. If he says anything you don’t like you can always tell him to leave.”
THE ROAD SO FAR:
When did things get so complicated?
A muscle in Sam’s jaw twitched imperceptibly, but Dean caught it regardless. “I thought you were done with that?”
“Awe, Benny, you’re a lifesaver.” He quickly popped the Advil and downed over half the water in one go.
“Oh! Definitely not.”
Castiel clung to her, completely drained of all energy. Today hadn’t turned out as he had hoped. Everything had been so great the last few days, him and Dean were finally getting close and God help him, he fell for the Winchester boy. There was no denying it. If only things hadn’t turned so sour so quickly. Whatever was inside him, it’ll roar to life again should he ever come near Dean. He could feel it. Dean didn’t deserve to be subjected to that, to him.
Castiel nodded. “Yeah. Any time after four will work just fine for me.”
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Castiel nodded because yeah, that’s exactly how he felt. “How did you manage to get the okay to fly out?” He asked his sister.
As he nursed his drink and the songs changed, each one bleeding into the next, Cas found himself slowly swaying to the music. The energy of it and the house overflowed and moved through him. Becky giggled and took one of his hands, dragging him out onto the floor, dancing close to him. Grinning, Castiel spun her before pulling her back to him. She giggled louder, her eyes bright.
It had been a couple of days since Ash had shown Charlie everything she needed to know about his “Master Plan” as he called it. To be fair, every plan of his was considered a “Master Plan”.
God, being face to face with Dean though, the object of his frustration and anguish from four and a half years ago, it was painful. Seeing Dean with Anna brought back all the emotions he felt when Dean removed his mask. The confusion, the shock and disbelief when it sank in, and oh God, the anger. This time he felt near blind with it and it unsettled him terribly. Castiel didn’t like the reminder that it was. It was dark and unforgiving.
CasaNova36[6:21PM]: I kinda…sorta…Really miss your voice.
That’s when it happened. In the midst of Castiel’s racing thoughts and confusion, he was completely distracted and hadn’t realized the cars ahead of him had come to a dead stop at a red light until it was too late. “Shit!” He slammed on his breaks as hard as he could but it was no use. His tires squealed against the pavement in a poor attempt to stop and he slammed right into the back of the older car in front of him.
Posse_Magnet67[11:18PM]: Ohh, feeling a little adventurous, are we? Well, you asked for it.
“What, have you never had a Jell-O shot before?” Charlie asked him.
“I uh, I think I should get going.”
“I know you are…But you don’t understand the gravity of the situation. When we kissed, I was overcome by something other than myself. Physical touch with another person in the romantic sense was out of the question. And for how long it is to remain that way, I don’t know. This is why I need to leave and be free of all distractions.”
“Yeahh, think I’m drunker than I thought.” He paused then, noticing the arm wrapped around him. He grinned at Castiel. “You’re warm.”
CasaNova36[11:20AM]: Now you’re making me think? Lol I don’t know. I’d travel, get out of the country. I’d tell my uncle he can go fuck himself and I’d be half tempted to burn down our Pastor’s church on mere principal. I’d have one year, so what are they gonna do? Imprison me for life? Good luck lol
“Oh of course not.”
“Oh nothing much. Same bullshit.”
Dean took his winning shot at their second round of pool, the couple balls he aimed for sliding directly into the corner pocket. Their waitress had just arrived them, delivering their order of wings, fries, and a couple more shots of whiskey to accompany their beers.
Its been 5 years since Castiel left Dean but they have since reunited. Both are struggling with the attraction they still feel for each other despite what they put each other through in college. And of course, both are terrified to discuss any of it in any serious capacity, cuz well, theyre idiots lol
Sam chuckled and followed Dean. “Wow, I totally called it.” He made the teasing comment as he grabbed his own beer from the fridge.
“Well hey, tell you what, if you need my help at all just give me a shout. I can do some research if you’d like, see if I can’t find you someone.”
They pulled out onto the road with ease. Dean glanced over at Castiel, observing him seated comfortably behind the wheel. His heart swelled with such admiration at the sight, it almost hurt. He looked so damn good driving his baby, what with the way his hands seemed to glide over the steering wheel.
Dean simply smiled at Cas, silent. He shrugged his shoulders, half tempted to tell him about it but at the last moment he chose not to. “How about we order a couple shots, yeah? And some good ol bar food!”
“You know,” Sam began with a huff of laughter. “If I didn’t know any better, I would think you were interested in Castiel.”
“Well, I got jumped.”
Posse_Magnet67[9:09PM]: Marco ;)
Okay, he was definitely flirting, had to be right? This conversation wasn’t all that innocent. Even through the haze of liquor, Dean could see the call backs to a time where they were completely okay with each other and the even smaller hints that if you squinted hard enough, you could see he was calling back to times when they weren’t that okay with each other.
CasaNova36[11:14PM]: Lol Okay, here you go.
“Nothing, nothing. Don’t worry about it, listen.” Gabe placed a firm hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “I know things aren’t really going how you wished they would.”
Posse_Magnet67[1:47PM]: Well the first one was from a few days ago, telling me they had a fat crush on me? Makes no sense though cause’ no one knows who I am on here. At least they shouldn’t…And the second one was just a few minutes ago. Apologizing for bothering me with their first text. Idk, what should I do?
Castiel couldn’t help but smile at their many praises and squeals of excitement. He was so glad he went over there at the behest of his friends. Though if it weren’t for the liquid courage flowing through his veins, he wasn’t sure he would have done it. Perhaps Dean would have come over instead.
“And you did, but now we’re inviting you to stay Cas.”
“Yes! Sweet, okay, let’s find you a set of wings then shall we?” Gabriel darted off without another word, searching high and low for the perfect set of wings.
“Well, aside from Sam and the occasional time my dad did, no.” He shook his head. “I’ve always done the cooking. I don’t know, it’s nice for a change, so thank you.”
Not yet.
Castiel could feel that itch at the back of his skull, the presence of Alistair desperately wanting to make himself known. He could feel it. So Castiel reluctantly grabbed the bottle of Jack and finished off what remained.
Regardless, John’s nitpicking and offhanded comments were a small price to pay compared to what an apartment would have cost by himself. But man, thank God for Bobby though. After a particularly heated argument one Christmas evening between Dean and his father - over a year after the accident – Bobby jumped in the middle of it.
“He seems like a really sweet guy.” Jo’s comment sounded genuine, though he could tell she was wary, concerned for him.
Fuck Sam for ruining his fairly good mood. He may have seen what Dean saw in Castiel, but the man had changed his mind. He’s got shit to take care of and Dean wasn’t going to sit and wait on his ass for something that may or may not happen. Dean may be out a tutor, but it was whatever, he could find another one. Or he could just bite the bullet and ask Sam for the help, assuming he was finished with all his pestering questions.
No matter how many times he told himself he can’t get close, he can’t rebel and feel things for another man, for Dean, it never really stuck. Each time he looked over at Dean or spent any sort of significant time in his presence, he could feel his resolve slipping, his guard dashed away by a smile and a pair of green eyes.
That piqued Castiel’s interest, the haze of being tipsy having cleared just a bit so he could focus properly on the conversation. He had almost forgotten the mention of an ex when they last spoke on his patio. But damn, how could someone not want to be with him? Just look at him, there’s that hint of stubble, the freckles, his ridiculously green eyes…Strong, capable looking hands…
Posse_Magnet67[10:21PM]: Just spotted a really hot brunette.
Becky frowned.
“What? Trying to get rid of me already? I can fly back out, its fine. So, this friend of yours,” He began as he grabbed his bag, getting down to business. “He talking to some weirdo online?” He pulled out his laptop and some other strange gadgets he deemed necessary to bring.
“Yeah yeah, why don’t you two just go get a room already.” The joke was made lightheartedly of course. It wasn’t just Bobby that teased Dean relentlessly about his love for the near fifty-four year old car. God, fifty-four years old and she was still running stronger than ever.
Hello everyone!! Sorry for the fat delay in posting this chapter, things have been a little crazy lately. Been extremely emotional and stressed for almost no reason. That end I was preparing for an amazing Halloween feast and me and my roommate wanted to make it perfect! So I've been a little pre-occupied for a bit. lol That and this chapter needed some tweaking and I consulted a few friends on what should or shouldnt happen just yet hehe
Castiel’s voice jolted him out of his thoughts. “Oh, uhm, so I just wanted to let you know if you need any routine maintenance on  your car, just bring it here, we’ll take care of it for you. We’re a hell of a lot cheaper than anywhere else in the city.”
“Oh, you know I’m game.” Came Dean’s quick response, a cheeky grin spreading across his face. “I always look forward to whooping your ass.”
They took their seats, Dean ordered two beers to start with. “So, who’s bright idea was it to name you Castiel?” He asked after taking a swig.
Posse_Magnet67[9:23AM]: Ha ha! Well, if I happen to then I apologize in advance.
“Then let me take you home.” Dean insisted.
“I mean, I wasn’t really going to say anything…” Castiel teased, smiling to himself. “It’s okay. I was just, I don’t know.” He let out a long sigh. He better come out with it, get it over with. Otherwise these questions were going to eat away at him. “You uh, you don’t regret what we did last we spoke over the phone, do you?”
“What’s up guys?” Gabriel greeted in return. He gave Ash a confused look. “Uhm, dude, where’s your costume?”
Sam nodded, shrugging his shoulders. “I don’t know about you, but I think he likes you Cas. You’re good to him, from what I’ve seen.”
The house eventually came into view and Cas could see the Impala parked out front beside the house, shining beneath the morning sun. His stomach was in knots again, an all too familiar giddiness urging him forward. Okay, find, he was excited to see Dean, so what?
He chuckled nervously.
“Yes, Castiel, you are a disappointment. I’m beginning to think all we taught you was for naught.” Zachariah spat. He stood to his feet and buttoned his suit jacket. “We’re not done with this conversation.” He added before finally taking his leave.
Castiel liked Becky, he had found a sort of kinship with her. She was a nerd, quirky. She was always writing and almost always had at least two notebooks on her. She was picked on now and again just as Cas had been in the past, but no matter what, Becky always came out on top. Castiel was grateful to call her a friend.
Dean ushered him inside, taking his coat and hanging it on the rack. Castiel took his time observing his surroundings before turning back to Dean, a suspicious glint in his eye.
Without further hesitation, Castiel wrapped his fingers around himself and gave an experimental tug, the pleasure of it shooting through his body. His back arched on a gasp, pleasurable warmth washing over him. “Feels good…Ah…Been too long.”
Dean appeared disappointed, but only for a brief second because he grinned and continued to flirt some more. “Well, you’re hot.”
But! I could let you all down. Writing this fic keeps my mind busy, keeps me going. Its an escape and i have wayy too much fun.
There was something there, and he wanted to figure it out. Although, being as sober as he was now, that just wasn’t going to happen.
Sam chuckled.
Raincheck
“Well, Sammy will be flying out eventually. Guess he got a new girlfriend, so maybe she’d tag along too. Uhm, Benny is already here for some time, probably Jo, Anna – if that’s alright with you – Uhm.”
“Of course.” Naomi nodded. “We can always do a sort of Skype therapy session if you ever need it. We can figure out payment for that later on down the road if that’s something you’re interested in.”
When Casanova didn’t reply immediately, Dean sent another message.
CasaNova36[9:17AM]: Okay, let me know when you decide to head over?
Hello again!! I hope you all enjoy the next installment of this fic. I apologize for it being much shorter than the last lol Also, fair warning, I suck at chapter titles. So bear with me!
Finally, a reply came and as soon as he settled himself down at a small table next to an oversized potted plant, he opened the message and read each word carefully.
“So, am I everything you thought I would be?”
And the energy of it, oh, Castiel loved this. He wasn’t sure if it was the energy or the alcohol or perhaps it was both, but he followed his friend’s right into the thick of the crowd and fell into the music, his body moving with it. He didn’t care if people saw, everyone else was dancing in their own way. His friends were beyond delighted to see him join in with zero hesitation, smiles lighting up their faces. They danced with him and Ash, oh dear Lord, at one point he cleared the way for enough space to break dance. It was ridiculous and glorious all at the same time, Castiel laughed and everyone else cheered.
“Is that wise?”
“You seem to be recovering okay.”
“Hello Dean.”
“Yeah.” Dean scoffed. “So everyone has been telling me. I just thought, I don’t know, maybe you could tell me something different.”
Jesus, keeping this call professional was way too awkward. It wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable, it was just…They had history. So the need to keep things professional was just weird.
“So what have you been up to Dean?” She asked as she popped a bottle and slid it across the bar to him.
Posse_Magnet67[9:50AM]: Hey man, how’s it going? So, I have a curious question to ask you.
Dean was floored. His eyes scanned over the messages, rereading them and even when he was finished, he was still very much in disbelief. There was no way, did people really do that still? It can’t be legal. He sat back in his seat; his food shoved away on account of losing his appetite which didn’t happen very often.
“A Halloween party!? Sounds like a rager, I’m in!”
CasaNova36[11:56PM]: Yeah, I should probably clean this up lol
CasaNova36[11:26AM]: If we’re gonna cheat at this game then I suppose I’ll answer: Yes, I’m a virgin. Now my turn, if you have a year left to live, what would you do?
“You gotta let loose every once in a while, baby bro. I worry about ya.” Gabriel told him earlier that afternoon. Castiel supposed it was true, he had been feeling a bit stretched thin the past month. Working two jobs, tutoring and being a full-time student was starting to take its toll on him. But even though he knew a few drinks might do him some good, Castiel instantly regretted his decision as soon as he reached the front gate. Even more so as he ascended the steps to the desk. There were so many people in attendance, one already puking their guts out into the bushes and it was only 9:30PM. It was going to be a long night.
CasaNova36[11:27AM]: That sounds exciting and very tempting lol Parties just aren’t my thing though.
Castiel looked just as surprised to see him as Dean was; his hands were visibly shaky as he readied himself to take Dean’s order. If there wasn’t any bad blood between them, Dean would have thought the flustered look was adorable. Hell, who was he kidding? It was adorable. He mentally added another checked box to the growing list of why he was an asshole.
“So, how are you enjoying Sioux Falls? You likin’ it here?” Dean suddenly asked.
“Yeah. Thanks for your help Dean, I appreciate it.”
Dean [8:28PM]: Yeah, so hey! Whatcha been up to?
The question almost sounded suggestive, though it could just be the liquor clouding Castiel’s judgment.
“Dude, what took you so long?” Sam asked from his spot at the table, his laptop open and his school work laid out in front of him. Dean handed him his coffee and sighed, plopping down in the chair opposite him.
“Oh right on!”
CasaNova36[4:05PM]: Does this help in any way?
Hope everyone enjoys this chapter! There is some sexual content down below, soooo....I'd say beware, but I'm sure you guys have been waiting for some steamy stuff, so I hope you enjoy it! lol
Becky giggled. “What can I say? It’s a writer thing.”
To Charlie’s frustration, she hadn’t yet received a reply from Ash, which, honestly, it was to be expected. The dude was a strange one, always busy with some sort of project and leaving very little room for a social life.
Gabriel gave him a pointed look, even more impatient than he had been moment before. Damnit, okay, there wasn’t any way Castiel could avoid the conversation. It was pointless considering the subject matter. He sighed in defeat, ducking his head to gather his thoughts. “He told me it was about time I put a stop to my suppressants, consider going through a full heat or two to avoid potential damage from prolonged use.”
“But I don’t really know how to play.” There was that dear in the headlights look again. “And my friends, I should really get back to them.”
Because of all that, Castiel had contemplated the idea of just remaining on the suppressants, medical advice be damned, but even he knew that that wasn’t an option. Anyone who wished to take the medication, regardless of reason, can be on them for a number of years before risking any lasting damage. In Castiel’s case, that meant going through a full heat cycle everything three years. And truth be told, despite what he had gone through three years ago, Castiel still wanted a chance at having a family one day, should he ever find himself lucky enough.
He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to let bygones be bygones. There was still a lot of shit that needed to be said, to be resolved.
fun and cool I’ll be over there.” Dean grinned and pointed his thumb in the direction of the pool tables, one table occupied by a big burly sort of man and a short redheaded woman.
“Says you.” Benny chuckled.
Sam was there in an instant, as though he had been waiting outside the door the whole time. When he spotted Dean’s blank gaze, starring past him and to the door, he stopped short. He knew exactly what had happened. “I’m so sorry Dean.”
“Of course you do.” Castiel took the list and folded it up in wallet. “Okay, fine. I’ll do it.”
Whoever this guy happened to be, he sounded just like Castiel. His voice was deep, gravelly, the sound of it resonated through him, sending chills down his spine. It brought Dean back to better days where him and Cas studied together and they laughed about something horrendously stupid Dean may have said. It brought him visions of a smiling Castiel, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners and how they seemed to sparkle in a weird way he couldn’t quite describe.
Dean bit his lip and gave her a nod. “I like the sound of that.”
CasaNova36[1:53PM]: Could be a good idea lol Don’t go overboard though. Keep me updated?
It wasn’t long before Castiel received a photo, the chime on his phone exciting him further. He opened the message, cursing under his breath, his eyes taking in every detail. Posse Magnet was very much in the same position as he was, except he was lying solely in his boxer briefs. And sure enough, there was a prominent bulge tenting the fabric.
Dean let out a breath, a fond smile tugging at his lips as he closed up the hood. “She is aint she?”
CasaNova36[8:10AM]: Sounds like you had a lot of fun. I imagine you’ll be pretty hungover this morning.
Castiel shrugged. “It was, but I don’t know, things are marginally better now. Well, aside from needing a heat partner, not that you’re not pleasant to be around, Sam, not at all.”
Dean licked his lips, inching slightly closer. It frightened Castiel, his heart pounding so loudly he was surprised Dean couldn’t hear it. Despite wanting all that he couldn’t have, Castiel turned away to collect himself. “It’s getting late. I should get back. I have work tomorrow morning.”
Dean thought about that for a moment. He actually almost forgot about Lisa and what transpired that night at the party. How could he forget that fine piece of ass? A frustrated sigh escaped him. “Okay, then I must be Bi or something. I don’t know man; I don’t really have a full grasp on this myself.”
A few minutes later Castiel pulled into the entrance to the Singer Salvage Yard and followed Dean’s directions to continue on straight down the gravel path instead of right which lead to the auto shop. So, he pressed onwards, passed the stacks of old beat up vehicles that no longer served a purpose and others that looked generally okay. They probably used some of those for spare parts.
“Sure, but does it matter? Once I’m in the midst of it I don’t think any of the smaller details will matter very much. All I’m going to want is, well, you know.” Castiel received yet another eye roll.
Bobby tossed the keys to Dean and before he could climb behind the wheel and ride off into the sunset, Bobby stopped him with a question. “You still gonna join us Saturday night for Poker?”
Charlie shrugged. “Was just a guess. I could tell by the smile on your face.”
“Hey,” Dean let his hand drop down to his side. “How do you know I can trust you to drive my baby? You, you drank almost as much as I did.”
None of it mattered anyway. Dean was straight, a lady’s man. Hell, he made out with Lisa at the party he went to over a week ago, and she was a gorgeous, well sought-after woman. Things would be much simpler if Dean just went after her.
So, she went back to her dorm room and pulled open her lap top. A sigh escaped her as she checked her email.
CasaNova36[1:21PM]: You’re a… Ohh, I see. Well, don’t you have another nickname I can call you by?
Thank God for Bobby’s connections though. It if weren’t for those connections Dean likely wouldn’t have gotten the car back and in pristine condition when he did. Everything else he would have eventually fixed, but a new engine without Bobby’s help? Likely near impossible and downright expensive.
Until it wasn’t.
“You’ve been avoiding me.”
Dean mulled over the question throughout his morning routine before class, Casanova’s voice replaying in his head. It was uncanny how similar the two were, how when they both spoke it sounded like they gargled a bunch of rocks. It was very deep, gravelly. He’d recognize it anywhere, which alone had to say something.
“Yes, but regardless of all that, I still believe in love.”
CasaNova36[12:00PM]: I’m so glad I met you :)
Castiel’s brows knit together, concern written on his face. “I said there’s a few chairs near the back we can sit in. Are you okay?” He tilted his head to the side a bit as though it would help him read the other man better and okay, if that wasn’t the most adorable fucking thing ever.
CasaNova36[1:30PM]: I think I found the perfect costume. I couldn’t really find anything angel specific that wasn’t marketed as sexy and I can promise you, you won’t want to see me in a skin tight dress. Lol
“Oh! Morning Cas!” Anna beamed, the spatula she was using to flip the pancakes held in one hand.
He remembered talking about his mom and how Castiel hugged him as he cried. Fuck, he cried? Well that’s fucking embarrassing. He also vaguely remembered nuzzling into Castiel’s neck, breathing him in before kissing the skin there.
He thought about how they had come so close to making out on his couch, how close they were. Castiel wanted him to kiss him, had nodded his head when Dean asked if it were okay. God, how Dean wanted nothing more than for things to be different.
CasaNova36[3:26PM]: Hello to you too, lol Uhm, well, to answer your question: Yes, all the time.
Posse_Magnet67[9:45AM]: Oh, don’t you start playing dumb with me now lol Mr. Aloof.
“You sly dog!” Dean laughed; his beer poised at his lips. “Hey, its okay, I’m not jealous or anything.”
Castiel shook his head, a look of fright in his eyes at just the thought of being in the same room as any of those people. “No, I can’t. I can’t face him again. I won’t, it’s too much.” Charlie understood his fear. Though she was sure he would want nothing more than to se justice served, she could only imagine how frightening it would be to face your abusers again.
Becky nodded in agreement, sipping her drink. “Yup, totally.”
Gabriel immediately picked up on his brother’s fears and he did his best to reassure him. “Don’t worry Cas, I didn’t tell him anything he didn’t need to know. Just that you were in an accident.”
Casanova slurred, laughing.
“Yeah, it’s uh, Dean, at the Salvage Yard. I’m calling about your car.”
Sam nodded. “By marriage, but yes. My uncle and Ellen became a mated pair ages ago, been together ever since.”
Dean shook his head in denial. “No she isn’t. You call up whoever is holding her and you get it towed to Bobby’s.”
The group followed where the loud music was coming from which happened to be down in the large fully finished basement. There was a DJ station off in one corner with some serious looking speakers, strobe lights and disco lights lit up the dance floor and everyone on it. People were dressed in all kinds of costumes, dancing with drinks in their hands. Even the DJ was dressed up in a pretty well put together zombie costume.
Posse_Magnet67[3:16PM]: God I don’t know, it’s a pretty big campus. Probably a few times at least!
!” He shivered uncomfortably with made Benny laugh.
“I didn’t think what he told me was true.” Castiel began as he pulled back. “He’s still there, inside, just as he said he would be. I can’t be rid of him Charlie, not for good. Not ever.” He glanced at the bottle of jack, tempted to take another swig of it for good measure. It had worked in keeping the monster away, it held him back, drowned it.
Posse Magnet hummed pleasantly on the other end.
Dean shrugged and scratched his chin. “My dad’s health insurance was shit and I couldn’t continue to rack up student loans while I had huge medical bills to pay too. I was in the hospital for another five days before they finally released me. I went through a shit ton of physical therapy so I knew not to overexert myself due to my lung. I still have to be careful.
Holy shit…
CasaNova36[2:45PM]: I really like you too :)
The music was bumpin, the sound carrying over the where they were currently across the street. There were quite a few cars too, parking along the sidewalk. Apparently everyone here were idiots to think they’d make it out of the biggest party of the season sober enough to drive.
Shit, that made a ton of sense. While he was upset with the fact that Dean and Anna had slept together, and while it was valid, arguing with them both brought everything rushing back. The anger and the temptation to rip Dean limb from limb being a defense mechanism made sense.
Posse Magnet hummed, a sound of intrigue and music to Castiel’s ears.
“He’s really worried about you, you know. I’m sure you feel like keeping your distance is a good thing, and hey, maybe it is. But, you made him happy Cas. He’d talk about you sometimes and he’s just light, you know?”
Castiel grinned, one hand sliding down Dean’s side and back around to grasp a firm hold on his ass. The act surprised him, causing him to jump, his face heating up at the sudden contact. “Well, where’s the fun in that?” Shit, was this a true side of Castiel Dean was viewing? He never thought in a million years Castiel, the socially awkward nerd in the back of the class would ever get up the nerve to openly grope another person, let alone him. But fuck…It was hot. And it was very hard not to give in.
Dean didn’t receive a response for a few minutes so he sent another curious message.
Posse_Magnet67[7:38PM]: Send me pictures when you go out shopping?
Castiel loved his sister dearly, but…Ugh, he was so not ready to hear Anna and some stranger get it on in their house. It was awkward and he only hoped that whoever they were they would be gone by morning.
It kind of sucked really.
Oh yes, she was perfect. Smooth legs, plump breast – a good handful too – and a firm ass beneath a tight little skirt he could grab onto. They had made it back to the Impala and she was on him in an instant. Lips pressed firmly against his, her hands tugging his hips towards her own. She was just as desperate and needy as he was, her fingers itching to touch bare skin just as his were.
Sam had left without another word, nor a word from Castiel himself. If the look on his face had been any indication, Sam managed to get the point across.
Charlie[8:05PM]: Oh no…Is it Dean?
It wasn’t until he relaxed and took a few deep breaths to calm himself that he felt the shame. Castiel dreamt of Dean, for the first time in years; and he got off on it.
Pamela shrugged, a grin playing at her lips. “I just know the look. I think you’d be a lot happier.”
“You mean to tell me that the alpha you rear-ended is your heat partner’s older brother?” Gabriel questioned, absolutely dumbfounded as Castiel retold the tale the next morning at breakfast. His brows rose in surprise when his brother nodded in affirmation, but a salacious grin quickly stretched across his face. “Oh man, well if this Dean guy happens to look anything like your partner does then…Whew! I’d loooove to be in the middle of that sandwich. Cassie, you lucky duck you.”
Posse_Magnet67[11:34AM]: Where would you go first if you could leave now?
Charlie paused for a moment; an idea having come to mind. She wrote down “67 Chevy Impala” under Dean’s column, circled the number 67 at the beginning and the other 67 at the end of Posse Magnet’s handle. She linked them both with a straight, connecting line. It seemed like a bit of a long shot, but more often than not, most people tended to use phrases and/or numbers that they have a connection to when creating online, social media accounts. If it was Dean that Castiel was talking to, it was a shame he hadn’t used anything else Impala related. It would have made her job that much easier if he had.
Who the ever loving…
Castiel – err – Casanova nipped at Dean’s bottom lip and all but growled. “….I want you.” His voice was hungry, needy and damn it if it didn’t turn Dean on something awful. The way his voice deepened with need…Fuck…
Yeah, he was definitely drunk now.
She smiled and stepped aside for Gabriel to come close. “How are you feeling little brother?”
Castiel rolled his eyes and yet, he too, deep down, couldn’t help but find the appeal.
Tentatively Castiel reached for Posse Magnet’s hood and began to push it down. He was stopped however, a look of alarm on the man’s face. He pulled it back up, just enough and leaned in close to whisper in Castiel’s ear. “Not yet Sunshine.” Instead of pulling back, he angled his head and without a moment’s hesitation he pressed his lips against Castiel’s.
“God, you too with the death glare? Sheesh.” He glanced away, muttering under his breath. “You two
“I appreciate that, but you don’t have to. Anna can make her own decisions and if this is something she wants, then I can’t say much of anything.”
“You sure you two aint tryna get back together?” Benny raised a curious brow.
“If this conversation is your way of hitting on me then I’m afraid you may need to change tactics.”
“What are you grinning about now?” Sam teased.
“He better be.” Dean turned away when he noticed another patron flagging him down and before leaving Castiel’s side, he added, “Be back soon.”
Charlie took his hand and gave it a squeeze. God how she felt for him. She wished nothing more than to be able to take away his pain no matter what was needed of her. “Why would…Why would Alistair choose now to come to you?”
The corner of Castiel’s mouth twitched upwards into a small smile. Dean, heartbroken? Well, he couldn’t allow that. “Uhm, okay. Give me a moment.” He left the table and wandered back over to Charlie and Becky, who were nine kinds of excited to see his return.
Dean chuckled at that while he formulated a text to Castiel. “Why do you think that?”
Dean turned to Sam, a look of pure annoyance on his face. “Why do you care so much huh? Me and Cas, we were just friends, that’s it. I thought, maybe we could…I don’t know. It doesn’t really matter anymore.”
“I’m okay. I just, it’s not really about you, I just…The past few days, after our last conversation, I felt…I don’t know. I was ashamed at myself, embarrassed for acting the way I did. And then, I don’t know, I saw him, my friend. I served him his coffee yesterday morning and everything just flooded back…I needed someone to talk to and you were – “
“I’m just stating facts.”
Dean bit his lips at the message, his face flushing something awful that most definitely had nothing to do with the alcohol in his system. They were flirting. They reached the flirting stage and an internal panic ensued at the thought. There wasn’t anything serious behind it, was there? It was all innocent flirtatious banter, right? Had to be, there was no way that they could both feel okay about flirting when there was this huge fucking problem sitting between them.
“I was wrong though. It was horrible…The things they did to me, the things they taught me. It wasn’t just Father Alistair…There were others. They called themselves Messengers of God and that they were called upon to do his work, to help heal todays ‘tormented youth.’
“What did I do?”
Charlie shrugged, a sly grin on her face. She was up to something, Castiel knew it. “You know, I could snoop around if you want, ask questions. I can have it all figured out for you by the end of the week.”
“Well, I don’t know, you guys were so good together. Could have sworn you two would have gotten married eventually. She’s a sweet girl.”
Unless you counted the many ways in which Castiel reacted to him. The dear-in-headlights look he gave him the first couple meetings they had, the endearing head tilt and intense gazing as though he was trying desperately to figure Dean out. Sometimes Cas acted nervous around him, fumbling over his words at times.
If he just focused his attention on his mystery man he could relax. He could also flirt – albeit horribly – without any real repercussions. Maybe that way he could keep quiet the thoughts that told him wanting Dean was wrong.
Sam laughed again. “Boy, the look on your face. Priceless! Look, all I’m saying is, Castiel likes you, clearly. If it was hard for him to end things with you then maybe his feelings for you ran pretty deep. Once you tell him maybe he’ll see the irony and, I don’t know, accept you?”
“Hey, I uh…I think it’s time. Will you meet me out in the backyard in say…Five minutes?”
When Sam finally returned home, Dean was right there, waiting a little impatiently for an update. And by impatient, that meant following his brother around the apartment but playing it off like it wasn’t a big deal. But it was. He had to know how Castiel was doing and as much as he had wanted to be the one who delivered the hangover food, Dean was sure Cas would have closed the door in his face.
Castiel hadn’t been in control of that from what ‘Casanova’ had said…It hadn’t really been the Castiel he grew to know and care for.
So he took his shot, the burn down his throat so much harsher than that of his whiskey. Cas nearly blanched, the warmth of it settling uncomfortably in his stomach. Well, he still hated vodka, but when Charlie announced for more shots he couldn’t possibly turn her down.
It wasn’t until after he was finally dropped off at home that the guilt of potentially being inattentive to Sam began to well up within him. Sam was a wonderful guy, intelligent and funny, and here Castiel was, ogling his older brother from across the bar.
But things were just…They changed. Everything was so fucked up and here Dean was, kissing Castiel again as someone else, pretending everything was as it should be when he knew it was all going to shatter in a matter of hours.
“I need to talk to Dean, right now.” Charlie pushed out of her chair and went to grab her things. She was angry and she was damned if she wasn’t going to do something about it.
Becky’s voice held a teasing lilt to it, her eyebrows wagging suggestively.
Charlie suddenly laughed, the whole idea having sounded preposterous. “Yeah, okay, like I’ll believe that.”
“Now, for the time being.” Castiel began, scribbling down a few equations on a new page in Dean’s notebook. “I want you to figure out these equations; they’re from a few lessons back.”
Dean looked a bit taken aback. “Why not?”
80% Match
“I’m sure it was all horrible things.”
CasaNova36[8:17PM]: Well thanks :)
“Nine Fifteen.” Benny laughed on the other line. “Ah, you’ll make it Dean. Professor Shurley isn’t even here yet either.”
Alone: Halsey
That stopped him, got him thinking. What sort of person would Castiel be if he allowed such a thing to happen? He wondered how young his brother was, how dire of a situation it might be. Damnit, it was impossible for him to deny Dean his help now. “Okay, fine. As much as I don’t particularly wasn’t to, I can’t allow you or your brother to go homeless.”
CasaNova36[11:57AM]: He did. Like I said, it’s a very long story.
“You know, he told me he wishes he can be with you more than anything, but he can’t be responsible for your happiness if he is not well.” Dean allowed the words to sink in and boy was it unpleasant. He understood, truly he did, but it didn’t make it any less painful. Sam’s next words, however, were like a knife to the gut. “I think you should leave the heavy lifting to his closest friends. Step back, perhaps move on.”
“Shit, uh, Gabe, you don’t have to.”
“Nonsense Cas. Just stay a little bit longer, help yourself to a few more beers.” It took some convincing but Castiel decided to stay just a little bit longer. Pizza arrived a half hour after Dean made the order and it was delicious, Cas having forgotten how hungry he actually was. He got to know Sam a little bit more and they appeared to get along well with each other, which was quite the relief on Dean’s part. Though he wasn’t entirely sure why he cared so much.
“You made all the wrong choices Dean…And I still, like the idiot I am…I still fell for you.” He quickly wiped at his eyes, his laughter dying down, his voice returning to that serious tone of his. “But I…I can’t trust you.”
Sam laughed and waved over a waitress. “Would you like a beer?”
CasaNova36[11:31AM]: Sounds like a solid plan to me.
CasaNova36[11:24AM]: Probably not, why?
Castiel grabbed his phone and pulled up the very first photo he received. He slid the phone across the table so Charlie could view it. “He assured me he wasn’t some overweight creep living in his mom’s basement.”
“I uh…Wait, weren’t you supposed to be at the bakery all day today?”
He waited with baited breath for Castiel to reply, his eyes trained on the screen. As if that would help him reply faster.
It was real, however, too real. And now here he was, awake after a week being in the hospital, comatose.
He did too, Charlie having been nothing short of an amazing to him over the past few years. “Well, I’m not sure, perhaps I’m over-analyzing, but that night, I think he tried asking me out. He wanted to ask me a question but what he said was in no way a question. It was rushed.”
“You’re not listening to me.” If looks could kill, Dean would most certainly be dead on the spot. Castiel’s glowering only intensified.  “I’ve got work to do Dean. After yesterday, after how I reacted, I realized I’ve got serious work to do before I can even entertain the idea of being in a relationship with someone. There are things you don’t know about me, things you don’t want to know. You don’t deserve to be subjected to any of that.”
CasaNova36[5:06PM]: I hope you haven’t gone to any such lengths that Joe had to find information about me…Cause’ that would be creepy.
Inspired songs:
There he was, standing before a full-length mirror on the back of a door, the room full of steam, and a towel resting dangerously low on his hips. The message “Good morning handsome” in heavily edited text covered his face.
Posse_Magnet67[9:33AM]: Hot damn Casanova! What happened to warning a guy? Lol
Castiel glared at Dean, his cheeks red with the embarrassment. “Are you making fun of me?” God, he hoped not. It hadn’t been fair. Dean had known who he was, had figured it out with that first phone call and Cas continued to make a drunken fool of himself throughout the entirety of the call. While to anyone else, the situation might have seemed comical, but to Cas, it was very real.
“Uhm, tell you what, cut up this bell pepper and onion into strips.” Dean began, laying everything out on the table. He went back to the stove and tossed the meat into the pan. “Do you like mushrooms?”
Castiel[5:04PM]: Its fine. It’s a nice change of pace from the seriousness that is my job. So thanks lol
Posse_Magnet67[11:38AM]: Okay, yes. The day I actually get on one I’m pretty sure it’s gonna crash. It’s gonna be the worst crash in all of aviation history too.
Castiel watched while Dean pulled up the correct classroom file just before the phone was shoved in his face. “Tell me what you think.” Dean said, a grin plastered on his face.
Charlie[9:39PM]: Just take a breather Cas. I mean…He has a right to be mad..But to remind you of it in such subtle ways? Idk, that’s gotta hurt. Just take a step back after tonight okay? For your own sake.
CasaNova36[2:05PM]: I’m no angel.
Watching Posse Magnet leave him there on the dance floor was challenging, albeit with the promise of finally taking off their masks. Cas didn’t want this to end, but he also couldn’t wait to see who lied beneath the mask, to see who this wonderful man was that Cas felt such a deep connection to. It was insane. Posse Magnet was a mere stranger, and to feel something so strong as this was near impossible.
Castiel nodded, a grin tugging at his lips. Oh Dean, ever the tactless one. “It is unusual. My mother had this interest in angels. She wholeheartedly believed them to be real beings, set out to watch over us on Earth. She named me after the angel of Thursday and Gabriel after the archangel.
Sam was heard laughing too, however.
Okay, so who the fuck was this woman? Was she a psychic or something, because it was starting to freak him out a little here. If it weren’t for the buzz he still felt he would have told her to stay the fuck out of his business.
Dean[8:14AM]: Okay, yeah, I’ll get ready now.
“Eh it’s no problem. So uh, what do you do for work?
“So Dean,” Jo began as she handed him his beer. “You didn’t tell me your friend that lives here was Castiel.” A few hours had passed and Dean found himself waiting for Benny to arrive at The Roadhouse. He busied himself with a couple quick rounds of pool, conversing with Jo whenever he had the chance.
His brother scoffed at the comment. “You don’t look like a zombie, just an extremely beat up angel. If anyone asks, just tell them they should see the other guy.” He laughed as though it were the funniest thing ever.
Posse_Magnet67[9:44PM]: ;) No Reason.
“Of course not! That’s not why I’m here. I know things have been shitty, but I think what you need is a night of letting loose. There’s a Halloween party coming up. A huge party. And you should go. You can dress up, pretend to be someone else for the night and have fun. I think it would do you some good.”
“Oh my God, I’m so nervous!” Becky squealed, waiting on the edge of her seat.
Posse_Magnet67[1:44PM]: Sweet! Sounds like a plan to me. Kinda excited, to be honest, should be a fun night. So, you know what you’re gonna dress up as?
“Well, sort of.” He said after swallowing. “It’s the student made chatroom you told me I should join a while back.”
Welcome back :) How's everyone faring during this fine apocalypse? lol
Castiel awoke with a start, those last words startling him something awful. They replayed over and over in his mind as he lied there in bed, his breathing slightly labored. The words unsettled him, made him hot all over; hell, the whole dream did.
CasaNova36[4:14PM]: Surprisingly no, like I said, there’s something about you that makes me feel at ease.
Becky was excited by the offer and grabbed four of them. The girl scampered off as Becky passed out the shots. “Oh these look awesome!” She slurped hers down in one go, Charlie and Ash following suit.
Posse_Magnet67[9:01AM]: Good morning Sunshine :) You excited to have fun tonight?
“Ah, what the hell.” He took a step forward, sliding a hand to the back of Castiel’s neck and he gazed into the brilliant blue eyes for the briefest of moments before closing the gap, his lips pressed firmly against Castiel’s. Oh, God, the sensation alone, the electric shock that shot straight through to his core nearly robbed him of all breath.
Castiel nodded, a grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. “That’s because I don’t frequent this place.” He shrugged. “It’s been a few years since I’ve been.”
The following chapter was a freakin beast to write. I was struggling so hard, but I finally finished it. It was also super freakin long, so I had to take a chunk from the beginning of that chapter and tack it onto the end of this one lol Theyre about the same length in words so that makes me happy.
Posse_Magnet67[2:05PM]: I think I’m a little dirty lol Might need help cleaning up ;)
“Dean, you don’t have to buy me anything. It’s fine.”
Charlie would be obligated to tell Cas the truth about everything. What would happen then? Castiel would certainly lose it! She’d have to watch him fall apart all over again and she really didn’t want to do that. She, unfortunately, might have to though. And she had to come to terms with it. Charlie was going this for Cas, for his betterment whether he realized it or not.
Okay so!
“Yeah you too. Thanks again.”
Dean waited until Cas was good and seated off to his left a few seats but a row behind them before he answered with a sigh. “It aint good, I can tell you that much.” God he was so screwed. In the midst of all his overthinking he had tried to convince himself that he was just drunk. Being under the influence made a person do crazy things, right? Surely that was the case. But seeing Castiel simply walk through the classroom door seemed to throw all that logic out the window.
“A Sales Auditor? Sure sounds fancy to me.” Dean chuckled with a slight shake of his head and took a long pull from his beer. Castiel took this moment to find solace in the texting conversation he started with Charlie.
CasaNova36[11:28AM]: I’m 24.
Staying over at Charlie’s dorm had been a welcomed reprieve. Becky had been ecstatic when Charlie mentioned having an old-fashioned sleepover fit with popcorn, candy and an endless array of Netflix movies and shows. Becky had insisted they start watching The Vampire Diaries and there was a newer one she was adamant about, something along the lines of “Daybreak”.
“I uh…”
Dean popped a few of the remaining fries in his mouth. “Well, I gotta hit the head.” He made to stand but completely misjudged just how drunk he was and stumbled.
“I’m uh, well I’m good. Gotta say though, I’m missing my study partner.” It was spoken like a joke, but when he looked up at Cas his expression was serious. He really missed the dork and he hoped he conveyed it well enough.
“Okay, I think I heard enough.” Castiel waved his hands in protest. “I don’t want to hear about how you two…Gross.” They all laughed it off as light banter, and it was, but it was still quite bazaar. Once upon a time, Dean used to make eyes at him, but now? Granted, the wink he gave Anna wasn’t at all serious, the fact still remained: Dean had slept with his sister.
“Well, I’m just sad there won’t be a wedding anytime soon. Was really looking forward to it.” Benny grinned from across the table.
Hope you all enjoy this chapter :)
Oh, thank God.
And yet, when Dean glanced over to see Castiel chuckle again, their eyes locked and the look in those blue eyes instantly took him back to the morning they shared a charged moment over homemade eggs and bacon. It was a bit muted now, shaded with uncertainty and a colored, painful history seated in the space between them. A history Dean didn’t want to touch for the fear of breaking.
. You did something, didn’t you?”
Hendrickson was heard laughing beside a tool bench. He shook his head. “Man, what’s going on with you? You don’t ever text on the job, hell, not even when you were dating sweet ol Jo.”
curious. Lol
When the sedation finally wore off, however, he was quiet, eerily so…Even now, it was hard not to think about what ran through his mind during those lonely hours. “They uh, they mentioned something about getting me a psych eval.”
Dean was limp, head lulled over onto his shoulder. He had cuts all over his face from the broken glass and fuck…He was pressed right up against the grill of the truck that hit them…
“Games?” Dean was baffled. “Why would I play games with Cas? I didn’t – “ Then it hit him. There was really only one way Charlie would have figured it out and that meant Charlie was his stalker; of sorts. Her ploy. “You’re Chugglet267, aren’t you?”
“I did.” He shrugged, popping another fry in his mouth. “You should ask her out.”
Posse_Magnet67[5:01PM]: I have! You caught up yet? Season 2 will be out soon.
Anyways I hope you all enjoy this chapter! Its not as dark as the previous one, trust me lol I think you'll enjoy it.
CasaNova36[1:08PM]: LOL! I can assure you that I am not.
I’m currently single, as my life doesn’t really afford me enough time to devote to a relationship, so I volunteer to help other omegas (and the occasional alpha) in their time of need.
“Trust me; a lot of blood, sweat and tears went into rebuilding her. And money too.”
“Something the matter?” Becky asked from her desk on the other side of the room. She hadn’t once stopped typing away at her keyboard, she just instinctually knew something was amiss.
So, she had flipped to a blank page in an old notebook and got to work. If she were going to go off of Becky’s theory then this needed to be done right. She created two informational columns, one for Dean and the other for Posse Magnet. She started with Dean, looking him up on various social media websites; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the like.
Castiel laughed at that as he reached for a slice of the pizza. “I don’t think she has to worry about that Dean.”
“Ash? How the hell did you get my number…? You know, I don’t want to know.” She laughed into the receiver.
Castiel [10:16PM]: Of course I do. What, you’ve never been tempted to look me up before? Lol
A wave of uncertainty flooded him as he stood up and made his way to greet the woman. “Hello.”
“Jo! Hey!” Dean leapt off of his stool and hugged her tightly, lifting her off her feet and effectively making her giggle. “How was your vacation? Where’d you go again?” He asked after releasing his hold on her.
But fuck, what about Dean’s sacrifices? He sacrificed his education, his friends, the life he had known for so long because of the damn medical bills and his inability to walk the halls he once walked together with Cas. He had hated Castiel for quite some time…But he also hated himself for a while too. He had been so depressed, so angry and everything else in between for so long. All because of Castiel. Logically, he knew he should never allow one person to make him feel such a way, but damnit, Cas had been everything he wanted.
Castiel finished up the order and handed him both coffees and the bagged scone to Dean with a smile. “One Grande Americano and one Grande soy no whip mocha for Samsquatch.”
Castiel took a moment to fix his coat and compose himself. “I can’t tutor you Dean; I’ve told you that.”
“Oh, it’s easy! You just move along with the music, and with a huge crowd, no one’s gonna care. I’ll lead if you want.”
“What, are you kidding? This is my costume. No one knows who I am anyway, so they’ll just think I’m some random dude dressed as a classic redneck.” Well, he had a point.
It heated his blood all over again, especially in Dean’s presence. Did Dean think about it too?
“What do you mean?” He asked, still carding through potential outfits. “Ew, God, who would willingly dress up in that God-awful suit?” Gabe balked, holding out a hideous, rainbow pinstriped suit for a better look.
Castiel took a seat on the couch, making himself comfortable. He pulled his binder out of his backpack and set it down on the coffee table. Dean already had his classwork set out and after recognizing the equations he gave him a while ago, Castiel decided to go over them. Dean had ventured into the kitchen to grab a couple beers when Castiel spoke.
There are mentions of religious preaching with some underlying indoctrination in there. Not a whole lot, but I thought id put a trigger warning. There will be more mentions of it in greater detail later on.
So Castiel drove home, a smile on his face and an idea on his mind. As he waited for a response, he tore off his shirt and settled on his bed. The act of undoing the button and drawing down the zipper of his pants ignited a fire low in his belly, excitement filling him, his cock twitching and responding in kind at all the possibilities.
It gave me a lot to think about!
“And you’ve neglected to keep me informed until now?” Benny feigned being offended.
“That’s very true.” Castiel snorted.
ADHD: Joyner Lucas
He just wished his mind would shut the fuck up and quit reminding him of the past. Perhaps trying to be friends with Castiel was a bad idea…Perhaps it was best they just split and go separate ways.
It happened so fast after that. My bags were packed and, in a few days, I left home to attend the classes. I was scared, sure, but I was optimistic. It would all work out in the end and I’d be saved. Life would go on as it normally would.” Castiel grabbed the bottle of jack and took another swig of it. He could feel the warmth of it flow through his veins, could feel his eyes grow heavy in the haze. But he needed t to be able to tell Charlie the rest.
And then the get the photos I edited myself? I had to halfway post em on my deviant art XD (I didnt wanna actually post em, just needed the address.)
Perhaps John had been correct in that assessment, except it still made Dean feel like utter shit.
Dean stopped him, however, with a hand on his shoulder. “Cas please listen! I’m begging you.”
Turns out that Sam was actually pretty amazing as far as first impressions went. His reassurances really did seem to help when faced with the severity of the situation and how transactional it seemed. And it didn’t have to feel that way, he had a month to go which was more than enough time to get to know someone and be comfortable enough with them to share something so intimate.
Castiel chuckled and shook his head, taking his time to sip on the second glass. “It’s fine. Sam’s been great.”
“I have a younger sister and a lot of cousins. I grew up with most of them. To be honest, they have some pretty unusual names too.”
“Like hell you are.” Dean looked angry, frustrated. They stared at each other for one long, intense moment before Dean finally let go and took a step back.
He averted his gaze and stared into the amber liquid in his glass. Castiel’s hindbrain really needed to chill out, relax for at least an evening. Besides, Sam was perfectly adequate for the job, he didn’t need to add any sort of unwanted confusion to the mix.
Castiel nodded his head, offering a kind smile. “Yeah, it’s fine.”
As if that were at all easy. There was just one little problem with that. Dean’s been talking and flirting with Casanova who happened to be Castiel, for a couple months! It was an incredibly fucked up situation and Dean was certain there was a special place in hell for people like him.
He wasn’t going to let Alistair win.
Cas stared at him, wide eyed in shock. He knew as soon as he heard him speak over the phone? So that meant…Oh God…The things they talked about, the things they did! Dean knew this whole time who he was talking to and he didn’t stop to think it was wrong?! Castiel’s eyes welled up with angry tears at the implication, at the sheer impossibility of what was unfolding right now. Hours ago Castiel had been so happy. He was with a man who cared about him, a man who he happily kissed without fear of an episode. They had danced, played games, laughed together, and it was Dean, this whole time.
“I’ll text you tomorrow with the details.” Dean nodded in agreement and with it all decided, Castiel left the alleyway with his heart still pounding in his chest. This could very well be a huge mistake.
“I need to talk to you, now. Can I climb in?”
Dean hadn’t really seen Castiel since the other night at the bar, since he almost made a fool of himself. Shit, he already felt like he made a fool of himself even though he swore Castiel showed signs of being on the same page.
CasaNova36[9:13AM]: I keep looking at your Halloween photos and imagining the moment we finally meet, or when I first get a glimpse of you…You ever get the sensation of butterflies in your stomach so intense you feel like you’re gonna puke?
“Whoa…Hey, it’s going to be okay.” Charlie squeezed his knee reassuringly.
Also, if anyone is curious as to why I used Chugglet267 as Charlie's fake handle, i couldnt think of anything! So, I used my friend Charlottes handle, well, a variation of it. And technically a shortened version of her name is Charlie, so. lol
“Well, is there anyone you’re interested in?” Because there is no way Dean could come up with such a conclusion if he wasn’t.
Castiel nodded, shrugging his shoulders. “Alfie never spoke to me again. We lost touch, haven’t spoken since. After the questionnaire I was made to listen to multiple quotes and passages from the bible about homosexuality, about Hell and what it was like.” He hung his head, a sigh escaping him. He recalled being so terrified after the encounter that he spent most of his time in his room, isolating himself from the rest of the family. Even Gabriel, the only one who seemed to care about him.
Holy shit.
Hope everyone enjoys.
One thing was for sure, Castiel needed some serious advice and after a week of contemplating picking up the phone and calling Naomi, he actually did. He thought perhaps he could calm down and relax from the encounter all on his own, but his mind was riddled with questions and his body hummed with a bit of anxiety where Dean was concerned. So Cas gave his therapist a call.
“Hey man, how’s it going?” Dean’s sudden appearance must have shocked the other guy because Castiel nearly jumped out of his skin.
“Cas, please. You have every right to be angry at me, but please listen to me.”
All the more reason to keep Dean at a distance. Which was why Castiel had sat at the back of their class instead of near Dean as he has been accustomed to doing lately. He wasn’t sure he was ever going to be ready to face him after having experienced something so powerful as last nights conversation.
But…He dropped out.
“I don’t believe this. You’re joking.”
“Benny! Hey, I thought I saw you come in.” She hugged him, an arm wrapped around his waist, her other hand holding an empty tray. “What brings you into town?”
CasaNova36[11:58AM]: That’s incredibly kind of you, thank you.
Becky asked him, bluntly, mind you. Castiel’s cheeks burned as he mulled over the question and fuck, how could he possibly say no to that? Of course he felt that same attraction, but was it just residual from college? Or…
His phone buzzed again ten minutes later.
Dean laughed too. “Yeah, I guess it doesn’t really have the same ring to it as ‘Mr.Casanova’ does. I don’t know man; wish I could give you an actual name; don’t want to reveal too much before the party.”
Castiel took this time to observe Dean, thinking back to when he mentioned briefly about what he saw as a child. His features had been very stiff, the memory still very clearly hard to process by the look of it. That stiffness, that faraway look in Dean’s eyes were still there, hiding beneath the surface, behind the laughter he shared with Castiel. Dean was searching for a distraction and he was more than happy to oblige.
Posse_Magnet67[9:17AM]: Not sure yet. People are probably going to start showing up pretty early. But eh, I won’t be there until maybe 8 or 9.
Posse_Magnet67[10:27PM]: Am I sensing some jealousy? ;)
Posse_Magnet67[11:46PM]: Hello stranger lol Random question: You ever think sometimes that the universe exists just to watch you fail, over and over?
Gabriel was really starting to test his patience. What gave him the right to just butt in like this? But, then again, he did recall his brother having a sort of friendship with Dean. Still, it didn’t give him the right to shove his nose into places where it didn’t belong. “Did Dean say something to you?”
So it was decided then. Charlie was going to find Dean tomorrow and they were going to have a little chat.
Dean chuckled when she reached for the belt buckle on his jeans, his hands stalling her for just a moment. “Easy there sweetheart. We could easily get caught out here.” He glanced around the near empty parking lot outside the bar they just left. There were a few other cars left, so chances are of someone catching them was fairly high.
There’s no way Cas would ever accept him.
It had been a few days since Dean last saw Castiel, having his car towed in no less. To say he had been distracted these last few days was an understatement. He was still in disbelief over the whole ‘Castiel moving into town’ bit. Hell, a part of him almost thought he was either joking or he was actually stalking him. The thought made him scoff in amusement a couple times already.
“Why not? Don’t you remember Cindy? My prom date you stole from me all those years ago? Look, I know you Dean, and I know exactly how you are when you want something, especially if that something is mine.” Not that Castiel was his by any means, but the statement remained true regardless. “You try to warn me away, or you just take it.”
“C-Cas, please, I’m sorry. I…I want to make this up to you.” He wiped his eyes, the tears threatening to spill over. There was no stopping it though as a few stray tears rolled down his cheek.
She giggled.
Hello everyone!
Posse_Magnet67[4:14PM]: That’s a good start :)
Dean paused a moment, thinking about his answer as he swallowed. He shrugged, brows furrowed. “Why shouldn’t I be?”
Posse Magnet nodded. “I am too…You ready?” Without saying another word, they both reached for the fastenings of their own masks. With a deep breath on both their parts, they took them off at the same time.
He couldn’t delay any longer, he needed to get this over with.
It had been a week since Castiel discovered Dean had slept with his sister the previous night, and as it turned out it wasn’t the only time either. The whole thing was ridiculous and though they sort of made up on the front steps – which was honestly kind of nice – going back inside to eat breakfast with the both of them was still a bit awkward, strange. His sister insisted that everything was fine, that she was totally okay with her and Dean stepping back from each other and it was literally only sex between them. Castiel had covered his ears at that point, refusing to listen to anything else that included Dean, an almost ex of his, and his sister fornicating. It just wasn’t right.
Castiel wasn’t able to reply after that because Dean was suddenly being shoved up on stage by Anna and Jo both. The commotion distracted him from his conversation with Charlie. Dean was laughing, refusing to go up on stage though he didn’t seem to be putting up much of a fight since he eventually gave him. He took a moment to pick a song and what happened next nearly killed Castiel inside.
“F-fuck!” Dean growled, fingers digging into her hips as he worked her through her orgasm, his own hitting him with such intensity he nearly lost himself. He groaned as he thrust his way through it before stilling altogether. He collapsed on top of her, exhausted, though he made sure he wasn’t crushing her.
Dean shook his head vehemently. “Nope, nuh uh. Sure, he’s hot.” And smells amazing; like how the air smells before a much needed rainstorm. There was an electric sort of quality to it hidden amongst the man’s natural scent and Dean would be a fat fucking liar if he said that alone hadn’t interested him. It was such a peculiar quality in an omega’s scent when many tended to lean a little more on the sweet side. “He’s totally not my type, too much baggage.”
CasaNova36[9:39AM]: Is it a sign that I’m an alcoholic if I feel like I need a shot just to get through the morning? Even though I know I’m going to lose my stomach if I do?
CasaNova36[11:16AM]: Idk, I’m in class and I’m trying hard not to focus on the guy I’ve mentioned to you.
But Dean couldn’t just relax, he needed answers, the panic and fear that Cas was dead, gone from this world because of him frightened him to the core and threatened to close his throat for good. He cried out once more, his throat burning with the effort. “Where’s Cas?!”
He pulled out his phone and sent a message to Posse Magnet.
Dean scoffed and sipped his whiskey. “Yeah, I’ll bet.”
Dean flushed and shook his head. “Naw, it’s nothing.” He grinned up at Bobby, tapping the palm of his hand lovingly over the roof of the car. “Just glad to have her back. Don’t get me wrong, loved the old Charger, but nothing will ever compare to my Baby.”
Dean side-eyed him curiously as they both plopped down on the couch, Sam reaching for the television remote and flipping through channels. “Uh huh, is that what they’re calling it these days?”
“Like hell I am!” Dean protested.
Jo took that moment to come on by, a bright smile on her face. “Soo, how’s it going guys?”
He looked up from his steering wheel to see the guy he hit had already hopped out of his car and was assessing the damage and oh, boy, he did not look happy. “Son of a bitch!” The man hollered.
The clock was definitely ticking by each passing day. In just over two weeks Castiel will more than likely hit pre-heat and want to nest and suffer through the first stirrings of unbidden desires. Shortly after that - which for Castiel, pre-heat usually lasts for about three days – he’ll be a begging, sweaty, needy mess, desperate to be filled and taken care of.
“We’ll figure this out, one way or another.” She wiped his cheeks dry and planted a kiss on his forehead.
Dean’s mind was pretty blank, spotty. Most of it was nothing but an inky, black darkness that he floated around in the middle of. Alone, scared at some points but then there were moments where he felt okay, almost at peace, as though he knew this was it and he was okay with that.
No, you know what? He was going to do exactly that! At least that’s what the plan was as Dean entered the break room and headed towards the fridge. Sam of course chose that moment to call him instead; horrible fucking timing as always.
Castiel was already in class when Dean finally arrived. He spotted him instantly, slouched in his seat with three water bottles set out in front of him. He looked, well, hung-over if the bags under his eyes were anything to go by and it concerned Dean to see him this way.
“Yeah, well it would be nice to have a little more information than what I’ve been given.” He finished off his whiskey before reaching for his wallet. Gabriel beat him to it, however, and slapped some bills down on the bar top.
Posse_Magnet67[8:45PM]: I’ll be there in ten! I promise Sunshine :)
He finished his third glass and promptly ordered another when someone decided to sit down next to him. Ugh, great. He was definitely not ready for a conquest, although maybe that was exactly what he needed; a meaningless screw to wash away the unpleasant feeling in his gut. At least for the night.
“Dude, why are you so suddenly interested in my love life?”
Chapter One: Cornered
Dean made his way across the courtyard and when Castiel finally took notice of him he shifted on his feet and pushed away from the tree. He looked nervous, apprehensive. However, he didn’t appear angry and for that Dean was exceptionally grateful.
“I was eight when it happened.” Dean’s voice cracked at the end, the memories suddenly hitting him all at once. “I failed her man. I…If I were older, stronger, I…I could.” He gazed up at the ceiling as though it could help him will the tears to stay put, to keep from falling. It was no use though because they fell anyways once he saw Castiel crawl over the other side of him, settling close.
Castiel[4:20PM]: I’m fine with a simple dress shirt and slacks.
So the pair followed Becky outside to the back deck, which was huge, mind you. There was even a hot tub out there, the tub already full of people. They found Ash in all his flannel and ripped jeans glory, held upside down over the keg by a Batman and Robin duo. There were people all around cheering him on. Cas laughed at the sight, shaking his head. Leave it to Ash to find himself hanging upside over a keg once left alone to his own devises.
Castiel chuckled at that, adjusting himself so that they lied a bit more comfortably on the bed. Dean continued. “Her and my dad were really close, they’d have done anything for each other. He changed after it all happened.”
“Are you sure? Cause’ I could just – “
“I was shocked if my heart rate rose abnormally or if my brain scans indicated any sort of interest in the images shown to me. I tried so hard Charlie. I didn’t want to react to the images of men, but I couldn’t help it. After each of those sessions I was punished. I was locked away, isolated with nothing but my own thoughts. I was given one meal a day and if I needed bathing it was a cold wash down. Freezing actually.”
CasaNova36[11:29AM]: It’s not so bad, I keep myself busy. Well, until you came along anyway, it wasn’t so bad.
Castiel smiled reassuringly. “I’m not leaving you two. You and Becky are my best friends, you’ve been there for me in more ways than one…I won’t make myself a stranger to you two, I can promise you that.”
He double and triple checked his surroundings and when he deemed that the coast was indeed clear, Castiel made his way back into the kitchen. He wasn’t entirely sure what he wanted so he settled for a jack and coke which honestly turned out quite perfect.
Charlie sighed and glanced over at him. “I know who you are Dean.”
Castiel’s companion leaned close then and whispered a hushed “Cassie dear, aren’t you going to introduce me to your new friend?”
But naw, Dean was not interested, not in the slightest. That was Sam’s gig, his burden to carry. Dean was a free agent and he’d like to remain that way.
“You think I don’t know that already!? I think about it constantly. I want to tell him and I know I need to but I just can’t, I can’t lose him Charlie…” The thought of losing Castiel forever, of not hearing his voice, seeing him smile that crooked smile, or receiving a message from him was frightening. And it only worsened when he realized just how deep he was in. He didn’t do feelings, ever. Nothing he’s ever felt in the past has felt like this, it was too much. He really did need to tell Castiel the truth, just rip the band aid off.
Posse_Magnet67[1:53PM]: Of course Sunshine :)
But oh…Those blue eyes though…
Castiel [9:53PM]: Looks delicious :P I’m sure you’ll be just fine. Pace yourself Dean.
Charlie shrugged as she typed away at her keyboard. “As serious as a heart attack. Besides, he owes me one.”
Castiel never did receive a reply from Dean for the rest of the night, which had Cas wondering if he had gone too far with his comment about Dean’s eyes being ridiculously green. As he readied himself for bed he thought long and hard about their conversation. It certainly had bordered on flirtatious, but Cas was only being friendly, there was nothing wrong there.
“Holy hell!” He turned to see Charlie standing outside his door, anger written all over her face. Dean rolled down his window. “Charlie? What are you -?”
Anna was pouting now. “Awe, that’s no fun. Well, get your asses in here and eat!”
Posse_Magnet67[12:56PM]: If we both know Gabe; do you think we might know each other in real life? Wouldn’t that be hilarious? Lol
“What…?” Mate? Oh..shit..Jesus. Sometimes he forgot he still harbored the scar from his scrubbed bond mark, the damn thing only stood out like a sore thumb. It was often pink in color whenever the skin decided to act up, most of the time is was a light brown color whenever it decided to cooperate. Either way, it was embarrassing whenever someone noticed it was scrubbed. It was one thing to know you were damaged goods, but seeing it reflected in someone else's eyes was another thing entirely. Castiel flushed with mortification as he went to touch the mark on his neck, the skin raised and a little tender. “Uhm, no that was my brother, he sent me out shopping for him and I was on my way home when I hit you.”
She pointed at him seriously.
Dean thought with Charlie gone he could finally breathe again. But that was the furthest thing from the truth. With her gone, the sense of dread was nearly all consuming. He was hesitant to move forward, to even speak to Casanova for the fear of spilling his guts and baring his soul to the guy. The guilt weighed heavily on him and he knew he shouldn’t continue to drag it out further at this point.
“But, no, I’ve had heats during these three years.” He countered.
“No, I uh, I don’t think so.”
His phone buzzed again, twice.
“No.” Castiel began, his eyes focused on the floor beneath their feet. He was terrified to look Dean in the eyes, afraid of what he’d see in them. “You must go. I – I can’t do this.” His voice shook, it trembled as he screamed at himself to take it all back, to stop rejecting Dean. All he wanted was to bring Dean close, to feel his arms encase him in a tight embrace. He begged and pleaded for the right words to come forth, but he was stuck, frozen.
But…No, it didn’t make any sense.
Posse_Magnet67[11:52PM]: I thought you would enjoy the video ;) I take it it did the trick?
This wasn’t right, Dean wasn’t supposed to feel things for men, let alone Castiel. Not especially after all this time. He was supposed to have let all that go, was supposed to find solace and pleasure with soft flesh and well-manicured fingers, not…Not…
Dean straightened himself from leaning over into the engine bay of a client’s car and turned to where the voice came from. His eyes widened when he saw the familiar face beneath the fisherman’s cap. “Holy shit, Benny!” They both laughed and hugged each other tightly. “You should have told me you were coming up, how’s Louisiana?” Dean asked him and they took a step back, Dean patting him on the shoulder.
“Ah, nothing important really. I uh, I should probably get going though.” Pamela’s face fell after that, but she nodded in understanding. She had known exactly what this was when Dean sought her out, it was just a one night stand, something they both needed. It was best for Dean to leave while he could.
“I know Dean.” Castiel nodded and glanced down at his feet. “I understand. I’d never expect you to wait for me. I just don’t know how long it’ll take or if I’ll ever be okay again.”
Their gazes locked again, the air between them charged once more. There was no question, Dean was really looking at him. “Yeah, I think I might be.” Once more his gaze dipped down to Castiel’s lips and Cas, God help him, Cas wanted Dean to kiss him. Right there in the parking lot on the hood of the Impala.
Posse_Magnet67[2:13PM]: Hey man, if I at all did something wrong the other night, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push you or make you uncomfortable. If you wanna part ways then I understand.
He was brushing his teeth in the upstairs bathroom across the hall from his room when he heard some sort of commotion coming from downstairs. He paused and turned off the water to listen and all he could hear was a bunch of giggling and the sound of footsteps stumbling up the stairs; two sets of footsteps he decided.
Posse_Magnet67[11:16AM]: Sure, lol I can try. How do you want me to do that?
The image seemed to make his orgasm that much more intense, his seed spurting onto his chest and stomach. “Oh God…” He breathed, totally undone by what had just transpired. After taking a moment to come down from his high a bit, he sent a message.
Posse_Magnet67[4:46PM]: LOL That would be a shock.
Dean may have decided to let things go, to move past some things just so him and Cas could be friends again, but he still couldn’t get over how the dude left him. It’ll certainly take him a long time to truly get past all that, he just wasn’t ready to talk about it, if they’d ever talk about it. Castiel may not even care too much. Well, that couldn’t be totally true, right? He did apologize that night he showed him the Impala. He had to care at least a little bit.
Posse_Magnet67[1:22PM]: Nuh uh, people don’t need to know I have an account on this app. Why don’t you call me… Squirrel?
CasaNova36[1:09PM]: Or, maybe you thought it would be easier to explore your sexuality without judgement.
Posse_Magnet67[10:13PM]: Of course I am. I do love a good mystery.
Castiel’s heart felt so full in that moment, the things he felt for this man, for Dean, were bubbling to the surface and threatening to spill over. How could this possibly be wrong? How could feeling something so deep for another person be wrong?
“You don’t have to do that Dean; I should be going soon anyway.”
He glanced over at his alarm clock, reading the time at 10:23AM. He had auto-shop class at 2PM and God how he really wasn’t ready to deal with all the noise that came with it. He rejoiced when he took notice of the glass of water sitting beside the alarm clock and two Advil pills. “Oh, thank God.” His voice was raspy from lack of hydration, an unpleasant aftertaste of alcohol lingering on his tongue.
Posse_Magnet67[9:20AM]: You tryna look good for me? ;)
“Well sure, of course he doesn’t. But, it’s weird now.” She chuckled dryly. “Don’t you think? I mean, come on, Cas was in love with you once upon a time. I personally feel like I’m crossing some lines here.”
CasaNova36[10:43PM]: Okay, good. Good night. :)
Hello again!!
But fuck, when it happened, when he did kiss him, he was absolutely floored at how Castiel responded to him, how he kissed back fervently and with a fiery passion Dean had never known. In that moment, Dean knew it had been right, it felt right. Everything was perfect and nothing else mattered but him and Cas.
She shrugged. “I have my ways. If it weren’t for Becky joking around we wouldn’t be here.”
“He brought Father Alistair over one day to speak with me.” Castiel sighed. “I remember being asked a series of questions while my uncle stood there and listened. He was interviewing me. He asked about my relationship with my parents, specifically my mother. He asked how close I may have been with her.” He thought about her then, the beautiful smile she always wore, how happy she and his father were. She had always encouraged him to be his true self, to do what made him happy. Kelly Novak had been a shining beacon for him up until she died.
“Hey! Buddy, did you hear me?” The stranger’s voice cut through his panicked musings, the look in his green eyes commanding. “I asked you for your insurance information.”
It didn’t matter much no after it was all said and done. Castiel had never asked about Dean because he knew if he did he would never recover and he’d be highly tempted to go back into town just to see him again. So he had avoided any and all talk about how Dean may have been doing just so he could focus on himself.
“Well, maybe to you, but it looks like a mess to me.” Dean came back with the beverages and handed one off to Cas before taking his seat. “Hence why I need a second beer for clarity!”
Welcome back everyone!!
“Yeah, I mean, I still have your photos…And that one night was pretty uh, intense. How can I not think about it?”
Benny looked up from his meal. Dean didn’t say anything, he just shoved his phone in his friends face so he could read the last text sent to him. He snickered. “What? You think he’s hinting at what happened between you two, or?”
“Hey, so uh, your car; you had a huge leak in the reservoir that holds your coolant. You also had a crack in the radiator itself, which, with both problems added together caused the sudden overheating. So! We replaced the coolant container and some of the hoses, but we’re still waiting on the radiator to come in.”
He was, if Dean were being completely honest, a strange and intriguing man. They hadn’t interacted a whole lot in the few times they ran into each other, but Dean was, well, intrigued all the same. It had to be the eyes, he had thought on more than one occasion. Those bright blue eyes were hypnotizing, hauntingly so.
“Okay! Remember how Hilary was talking to that guy online who happened to be dating the rude bitch who bullied her? She had no idea who he was and neither did he. What if – “
Dean wasn’t sure what came over him when he suggested that Castiel stay for the afternoon. He agreed nonetheless, which made him happy. Perhaps Dean was a glutton for punishment, or he was just plain stupid and deliberately ignoring the warning bells going off. Where exactly was the harm though? So what if he wanted to spend the afternoon with the guy and rebuild whatever friendship they once had?
“That’s just…Odd..” He answered a few more questions, his answer to the peculiar masturbation question being average.
“And what, you don’t think you’d ever get married?”
He dialed Posse Magnet a second time.
Castiel nodded in agreement. “Yeah, there sure is nothing quite like family.”
Castiel sighed and set his pen down. He gazed out into the distance, watching all the other students mill about. Their lives were so much more different than his own; some where so clearly happy, content. Others seemed stressed and a few more who didn’t seem to really give a fuck. Oh, what he wouldn’t give to be another person right now. Maybe Gabe was right, it would do him some good. He may not be one to party, but one night couldn’t hurt.
“I’ll call him and I’ll see that he’ll be here as soon as possible.”
He refused to eat that night, preferring his own company above all else. It had angered Zach but he didn’t care. Castiel cried himself to sleep that night, afraid he was going to Hell for what happened, terrified he’d never see his parents again. He was embarrassed by the whole thing and he was positive the whole family knew, they had to. He not only shamed himself but the entire family as well.
CasaNova36[4:54PM]: Should be back to normal functionality by tomorrow.
Castiel[4:19PM]: I’m not exactly required to, but I also don’t wanna come in looking like a bum. I suppose I could wear a full suit if I wanted to, but getting dressed up like that might be a little too ‘fancy’ for Costco. Lol
