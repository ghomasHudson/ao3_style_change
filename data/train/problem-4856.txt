Well Steve is still in denial and stubborn as hell. Honestly at this point he probably won’t realize he’s pregnant until he’s giving birth 😆
Peter sets his attention back on the shield. He lifts it from the display and slides his arm through the leather straps. It’s heavier than he imagined it would be. Or maybe it just feels that way because it’s not his. It’s not meant for him.
“Steve.” Someone is holding him, pinning him down. Steve screams again, struggling to break free. “Steve!”
“Good.” Tony reaches into the bag and takes out the velvet box. He opens it to reveal the gold band inside. A chorus of ‘Ooohs’ fills the room. “What do you think?”
“You’re so tiny. And you remind me of Steve. I’m waiting for you to say ‘I can do this all day,’” she says, her voice deepening as she does her best Steve Rogers impression.
Peter gives the cat another rub before deciding to head to the guest room and start on the bit of homework he did have. But he doesn't gets very far.
Peter reaches the cemetery and runs toward the familiar gravesite. He stares up at the face of his father, no longer able to keep the tears from falling. Peter glares, his hands rolling into tight fists.
Steve is making a lot of progress and I'm so happy for him. I still have some plans for these two and I can't wait for their happy ending :)
“Do I get to be a part of the next mission?” Peter asks, unable to keep the giddiness out of his tone.
The Stark-Rogers household is in chaos. Tony is running late for a meeting and both kids still need to get dressed for their first day of school. It was a big day for everyone; Tony would be signing over his company to Pepper so that he could be at home more and the boy’s were taking the first steps on the road to independence. It was bittersweet.
“So that’s how big you are.” Peter smiles and lays a hand over his belly. “I don’t want to call you blob and since I don’t know if you’re going to be a boy or a girl, I’ll just call you...Blue.”
“You feeling better?” Tony asks into the darkness. He feels Steve nod beside him. “Good. Just stay here from now on. I don’t like leaving you alone.”
He doesn’t leave the compound entirely, but he excuses himself away from the group and down the stairs Peter had come up from earlier. He doesn’t follow the stairs to the bottom level, and instead takes a few down before lowering himself onto one of the steps.
Peter seemed to like his new room. He sleeps peacefully in the crib and rarely fusses through the night anymore. Steve’s not about to get his hopes up; he’s still expecting to be woken up every few hours in the middle of the night.
Steve caressed each inch of his cock, exploring the shaft and the shiny, tender tip. He’d leaked enough precome that it spread easily down his length, and Steve took special care to circle the very tip with his thumb and let Tony’s slick coat them both, it was messy and sticky and Tony had never known how hot seeing Steve’s hand covered in his slick could be.
He looked more at ease now, and he and Tony chatted for a while about Bucky and Rhodey’s respective progress, sharing notes on which meds had best kept the nerve pain at bay, and what the current prosthetics and wheelchair option limitations were.
But that was the crux of it. They were friends. Maybe even best friends. They’d never really defined it, but they were friends. Tony didn’t want to ruin that. Didn’t want to risk what they had. So he kept silent, didn’t let himself feel the emotions he knew ran deep. This was easier, he told himself. Because the alternative was too much.
That’s what he was good at, right? Steve had made that perfectly clear. He was damn good at putting on a show. He’d always had a flare for the dramatic and Steve had never hesitated to complain. Loudly. In front of Tony and everyone on this goddamn team.
He wondered sometimes if the others had noticed. Steve, who was usually quite social had taken to silently curling up in a chair in the living room with his current book. It just so happened to be the chair Tony had been reading in that very first day. But hey, it was an excellent chair for reading late into the night.
Steve’s eyes widened in shock, before rolling back just a touch in a look of pure pleasure. He was so reactive, Tony realized, every touch like electricity to Steve. How long had it been since he’d been with someone, he wondered.
Steve had to sip his juice to hide the smile forming again on his lips. “What kind of project?” He had never been very good at keeping a straight face, and now was no different.
Eventually they broke away, each gasping a little for air. Their cheeks were flushed and neither could help but grin at the other, happy and shy and excited all at once.
I’d rather be writing this on paper, but you’d probably think it old fashioned. So I’m trying. I’m trying to show that I can change. That I can admit when I’m wrong.
Tony’s mind was already racing on how he could build a better arm than what was on the market right now. Hell, he could probably make them a lot cheaper than any other too. He hadn’t even met Steve’s friend yet, but his fingers were itching to start drafting an arm that could fix the issues Bucky had been having with fine motor movements.
He burst through the door, looking around frantically for someone who worked there. His eyes settled on a meek looking waitress who’d been texting on her phone, and he said, perhaps a little too forcefully, “My date and I are ready to order, please!” Her eyes went wide, and Steve felt a little guilty for startling her, but he was still high on the adrenaline of telling Tony off.
Eventually, Steve broke the silence, setting his pens and the sketchbook down on the cold slab of floor with a quiet thud. “You saw it, right?” It was barely more than a whisper, but Tony knew he’d heard it correctly.
They waved goodbye, and Steve jogged back to the waiting room to find his friend Bucky waiting for him, if the soft sounds of, “Oh my god, Stevie, were you flirting with that guy?” were any indication.
Tony started to speak, easily falling back on his argumentative instincts. One pinch on the ass cheek from Steve made him halt, the first word stuttering before he could get it out.
Steve smiled down at him, “Don’t most people sit at a desk or stand at a white board to work through math problems?”
“Who was he?” Steve asks. He doesn’t expect an answer, not when he wasn’t allowed any knowledge about the alphas that are brought in. This alpha had been different and since that night, it was all Steve could think about.
“Just don’t worry about it. You have more than enough people now. You have your buddies Barnes and Wilson on the team. That’s enough, right?”
“Yeah. He mentioned retiring. I wish he would’ve had the chance. He at least deserved that.” Natasha’s eyes are full of tears and she quickly wipes away the ones that escape. “Sorry,” she apologizes when the tears don’t stop.
“I wish you were here to tell me what to do. What do I do? I need...I just need to know that it’s okay.”
Tony senses his struggle and steps in. “Since he was early he’s having some difficulty with breathing on his own, and his weight is on the low side. The doctor’s aren’t too concerned, but he’ll have to hang out here a little longer.”
Tony would be livid if he knew Steve was touching his things, but he’d also been the one to hide it in a planter pot, so Steve decided that balanced it out.
Steve grinned and finally took pity on him, rolling the fabric down his hips, and he could feel cool air as his cock was freed, aching and dripping and so so eager for more.
Steve pulled out his phone, glanced at the message from Bucky wishing him luck, and sighed. He put it back in his pocket and settled into in his stiff wire chair. It was comically too small for him. Little did he know that one of the reasons this location had been chosen because he was such a big guy and their chairs were spindly and uncomfortable.
Steve was glad he’d saved them though. He’d kept meaning to donate them some day, but they were exactly what he needed.
God, you’d probably hate that I just wrote that. You always said I had an ego bigger than my father. Did you know how much that cut me inside? I think you started to see it. You stopped saying it. I always hated when people compared me to him. I think you could see how much I want to be anything other than him.
Steve knelt to the ground, on the same side that Tony’s head was turned, and laid the implement next to him.
“Can I borrow a fine liner, Tones?” His voice was soft and gentle, and it made Tony melt a little inside.
“Uh, gotta go. JARVIS is waiting on me for his systems diagnostics.” And in a beat Tony was gone, halfway down the hallway back to his workshop.
She followed him back to the table, which was now unoccupied. Tony was talking heatedly to one of the numerous production people, and it didn’t look like it was going well. He was clearly agitated and wasn’t liking whatever answer they were giving him. Steve planted himself firmly back into his chair, and could hear the metal legs straining against the weight of his muscles. He crossed his arms, and watched as Tony continued arguing in hushed tones with the glossy haired assissant who kept glancing anxiously at Steve. Tony was probably complaining to the show people about what he’d just said. Fine. Let him bitch and whine about Steve standing up for himself. He was pissed as hell that he’d let this guy treat him the way he had. And he was even more pissed because he’d been genuinely attracted to Tony before his sudden mood shift. He’d been hoping they could go out again, sans cameras and the at-home audience.
Tony immediately zeroed in on the fact that the notebook still lay open, the sketch of him easily viewed from his desk. He paid it no mind though, or at least pretended to.
Steve opened his door, hopeful that he’d be gifted another Tony sighting today, and immediately collided into something firm and fabric covered. A book clattered to the floor, and as he bent to pick it up, his hand brushed against another hand. Tony’s hand, to be exact. Steve’s eyes darted up, and he could easily read the look of embarrassment on his face.
He didn’t think the world would like the man he was under the uniform and muscles. He was terrified to find out.
It had gotten especially bad when Tony, disgusted by the state of the technology at the VA hospital had tried to get Rhodey switched to a state-of-the-art private hospital. He’d refused to talk to Tony for days, speaking only to Pepper or JARVIS, and eventually Tony had relented.
Steve glanced down at Tony again. His mouth was just slightly parted, looking innocent and sinful all at the same time. Steve wondered what it would feel like to kiss him. “Something like that. I thought it would be fun to be someone else for a while. Quite a few someone elses. But it never quite felt right. It was like I was wearing a costume, hoping if I looked the part I could be the person I wanted to be. Doesn’t work that easily I guess.” He couldn’t stop staring at Tony, shame filling his insides,
The blonde man turned to look at him, surprised, but with a kind smile. “Only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, except for holidays. You?” His eyes crinkled in the cutest way, and Tony hadn’t realised how blue they were until now.
“I can’t wait to meet you,” Steve says softly to the bump and he presses a kiss to Tony’s belly. He traces the dark line that’s starting to appear, eyes flickering up when Tony shifts. “You’re beautiful.”
Happy leads Steve toward the front door, then he rushes in the direction of the kitchen to grab the phone that was almost left behind. He returns a minute later and carefully helps the laboring super soldier out the door.
Peter’s curiosity grows and he opens his hand, only to close it again when the rain dampens the paper. He quickly stands and rushes back inside before the rain completely destroys the paper.
“Just the good stuff I hope.” Tony comes closer to be near Pepper. He briefly looks over the document he needs to sign. “I can’t sign this. I need coffee first.”
Steve as usual was in a cheerful mood. It was slightly irritating, but Tony blamed his hormones. And the fact that his son had taken it upon himself to kick him in the ribs.
The figure tied to the bench captures Tony’s attention again and he finds himself moving toward him. From where Tony’s standing, the man resembles that of an alpha. His strong, muscular build is what makes Tony assume the man’s secondary gender. But the sweet smell wafting around the room can only be one thing: an omega in heat.
“I was forced to stay with him. I was forced to mate…” Steve chokes back a sob and that’s when Tony moves closer, wrapping Steve in his arms. “He took everything from me.”
I’m so so sorry it’s taking me so long to update. My job has me working insane hours for the holiday and I haven’t had any time to do anything. I barely finished this chapter last night on my lunch break. 🤦♀️ Anyway it’s kinda long so hope that helps! Thank you guys for being amazing and so patient with me! I swear I’ll find time to write! ❤️❤️❤️
He frowns when he realizes he hadn’t purchased anything for his own place. He assumed Peter would be staying with Steve full time, but during the times he had their son, he was going to need to furnish one of the rooms he wasn’t using. It would be easier if they lived together, but Tony knew that wasn’t an option.
It was hard enough with their busy schedules to find time for themselves, and now training a dog had to fit in there somewhere. It wasn’t going to work and Tony had no problem letting his boyfriend in on his opinions.
Tony pulls away and sits up, his face glistening with the omega’s slick. He can’t help but lick his lips, moaning from the sweetness.
“I don’t know why you’re fighting sleep,” Tony tells her. “It’s pretty much bedtime. Are you waiting for Papa to come home? I bet you are, huh? Me too.”
But it’s not just making coffee that Tony busies himself with. He makes sure all of Steve’s prenatal vitamins are in order and ready for him to take. Steve’s caffeine intake is now limited so Tony makes sure he had a steaming cup of tea waiting for him.
The sound of Alpha’s palm connecting with his cheek echoes in the room. Steve instantly grows silent. He opens his eyes, immediately regretting doing so when they connect with cold blue ones. They’ve gotten darker; the pupils are almost black.
“You need to take it easy,” Sam says and he clasps a hand over Steve’s shoulder. “How are you gonna take care of that kid if you’re over here passing out?”
Tears are streaming down Steve’s face now. Tony hates seeing the pain he’s putting his husband through, but this pain was necessary. They didn’t need to try again. He was trying to save Steve from more heartache. He was trying to save Steve from himself.
“Hey, you okay?” Ned asks and Peter wants to kick himself for ruining his friend's story. He enjoyed listening to Ned talk about his new Lego sets or the weird movies he found on Netflix. He didn’t want to rain on his parade all because he couldn’t keep himself in check.
“I know, I know. I just...I can’t stop thinking about him. I thought if I distracted myself with this then he wouldn’t be on my mind so much. I realize now that was stupid because this project only reminds me of him.”
Peter smiles back, but it falters quickly now that he’s up close and able to see the kind of state his father was in. He’s seen his father come home battered and bruised before, but he’s never seen him like this. His father was broken.
This was perfect. He wanted to dress the part of a nerdy professor, and what better than a tweedy 1940’s inspired look?
He gently caressed Tony’s ass, beginning with one side, then moving to the other cheek. He’d always loved this part of Tony’s body. It was plump and defined, perfect for spanking. And so Steve drew his hand back, and connected with Tony’s ass with a firm slap, perfectly centered on the side closest to him. He grinned at the yelp Tony let out, his eyes springing open to look into Steve’s. There was surprise and a little annoyance, but it was mostly lust that played across Tony’s face.
He’d even offered to build him some badass cyborg legs, which he made sure to remind him of today, but Rhodey had just rolled his eyes and told him to stop hovering as he wheeled himself down the hallway Tony was banned from.
Steve bristled a bit at that, they hadn’t even ordered yet, and this guy had more than made up for the initial bad impression, but that was just downright rude.
The last sentence made Tony’s eyes flutter open. They were clouded and hazy. Tony nuzzled into Steve’s neck, seeking out comfort after taking his punishment patiently. And Steve loved the gentle mewling sound Tony made as he caressed him.
“Hey.” he said softly. “I’m sorry if I upset you. I thought we were having a nice time, but I feel like I did something wrong perhaps?” Steve could feel his face heating up as he spoke the quiet words. He really had been having a great time with Tony, had even forgotten about the cameras and production staff for a while there.
Making breakfast was an intensive process. Most of the team usually forwent eating in the morning. But whenever Steve offered to cook, they came out of the woodwork and everyone wanted seconds. He decided on bacon and eggs like Tony had asked, along with biscuits, toast, and fruit salad.
“Have you now?” Steve mused. “I seem to recall you being quite impertinent this afternoon. What was it that you said to me after the mission?” He paused for effect, as if he was struggling to recall. “Ah, yes, I believe you asked me if there was a stick up my ass that I required assistance in removing.” He ground his still clothed cock into Tony’s ass, and was rewarded with a guttural groan.
Steve ended up hovering outside Tony’s bedroom door, trying to pace as quietly as he could. He felt ridiculous and self conscious, and was debating giving up to go read volume 6, when he heard a crash coming from the opposite hallway, along with a long stream of curses.
Tony tenderly stroked the creamy background, the paper courser than he’d imagined. He was careful not to smudge any of the charcoal, lest he mar something so perfect.
Eventually Tony settled into working on his plan, and Steve moved to a plush chair that he’d dragged into the workshop months ago. He pulled out a sketchbook and charcoal that he’d stashed as well, and began sketching.
He slipped out of his bedroom, padding back to the living room to retrieved the book. Thankfully it was undisturbed. Steve picked it up, fingers drumming on the spine, and he walked to Tony’s workshop, intent on returning it.
Steve’s hands trembled slightly as he reached for the book. He couldn’t believe Tony had forgotten it, but he hadn’t been acting at all like himself at the time. He’d clearly been too preoccupied on getting away from Steve.
They stayed like that for a while, Tony half dozing off in the safety of Steve’s arms, and Steve still in awe at this man, this beautiful man who would submit only to him. Who would willingly and eagerly bite his tongue and let Steve be in charge. It made him breathless, the amount of trust Tony gave him.
He gingerly left the sketch book on the page it had been open to, and turned off the light, a soft giddiness rising in his belly as he made his way back to bed.
So Steve decided to do some research. He left the book where he’d found it, taking care to nestle the dirt-stained corner back into the potted soil, and went up to his room to use the computer, leaving the newspaper half-crumpled on the couch.
Steve slumped into the door frame against his back, hands covering his face in embarrassment. “So much for deciding when to tell the team.”
But a part of me hopes you miss me too. I know that’s selfish. I know you don’t owe me that. But I still hope.
He looked around, disappointed that Tony was seemingly elsewhere, but then at the last minute he spotted a familiar socked foot sticking out from under a workbench.
Once he was satisfied that Tony was well warmed up, Steve reached for the leather paddle. It was a rich chestnut brown, and his favorite. He cracked it against his palm, and the sound alone made Tony’s body jerk in anticipation, hands struggling against their bondage. He smoothed his hand against Tony’s backside once more.
Steve gave him a couple more hits, the last one perhaps a bit too strong from the way Tony’s voice pitched up higher, and then gingerly lifted him up and back. He was kneeling once more, and Steve wrapped gentle arms around Tony from the side, murmuring in his ear that he’d been so good, had taken his punishment so well, and would be rewarded now.
“So what’s with the jar of slime?” Steve finally asked, prodding the glass container with a tentative finger. The ooze shimmered, almost appeared to morph in response to his obstructed touch. “Don’t tell me that thing’s still alive in there?” His face scrunched up in distaste.
Tony looked embarrassed, and then collected himself. “All the more reason to, then! Now get on with it! I haven’t eaten for at least 30 hours and I’m starving. I want that Rogers’ famous All-American Breakfast.”
Tony had disappeared pretty quickly after Steve entered the kitchen, presumably to shower and change like he’d said. And about halfway into the cooking process, Sam and Nat had wandered into the kitchen and offered to help.
Maybe he was lathering himself up with that light, clean scented soap he preferred, letting his hands wander across his taut, creamy skin? Maybe his hands would glide over the curve of his hips or his perfect plump ass? And just maybe they’d find purchase on his growing cock, thick and swollen from lust. Steve would touch himself softly at first, maybe even hesitantly. He’d probably feel guilty for giving in to such base desires. But it would feel so good that he’d have to give in. He’d lean into his own touch, letting his fingers dance across the head of his cock, teasing himself, grasping onto the shaft as he let out a sigh of pleasure.
Granted, ever since he’d gotten serious about Iron Man, Tony didn’t seem to have any interest in that old lifestyle. But Steve assumed that was just him growing up. He knew Tony and Pepper were a couple at some point, but had never asked too many questions about what happened in the end. At the time it all seemed too personal to ask a coworker.
But lately, fuck. Lately the old Stars and Stripes had been on him about everything. He’d chime in over their comm system after missions about things Tony had fucked up. He’d spend hours pouring over footage of their fights, pointing out how Tony’s rashness had nearly gotten Nat injured, or had let the bad guys get away.
He was suddenly very aware of the cameras focusing in on them, eager to catch every second of this hellish date. ‘God, what am I still doing here?’ he thought to himself. ‘Oh yeah, I’m basically letting Bucky whore me out on national television because I need to be able to eat and pay my electric bill this month. I can do this. I can get through this and collect the money and hope to whatever gods may be out there that no one from art school ever sees this episode.’
“Just some research for an idea I’m developing. Really technical, jargon-y stuff. Even I’m having a hard time getting through it.” He frowned and looked away, as if he was embarrassed to admit he couldn’t understand the text.
He was kissing Steve Rogers. Correction, Steve had kissed him first, he was just returning the favor. And it felt so goddamn incredible that he briefly wondered why he’d spent the past few years doing anything besides kissing this gorgeous, perfect man. God, he really was an idiot, he’d been wasting his life before this moment, he thought to himself.
Guilt gave way to something sweeter. Love. Tenderness. A warmth from being truly seen and accepted. He didn’t know exactly what all this meant, but he had an idea.
He tried asking Tony another question, only to be met with silence and an eye roll. Tony wouldn’t meet his eyes, and Steve wondered if he’d said something to offend him.
Steve was so caught up in his thoughts that he didn’t see Tony rounding the corner and crashed into him. There was a clattering on the tile floor, and when Steve looked down, he saw Volume 28: ‘The Lusty Billionaire and the Spectral Professor’.
Tony was a decent liar, and smart enough to think on the spot, but Steve knew his face well enough to immediately pick up on the ruddiness blooming on his skin. Something was up. Tony Stark was not a blusher.
Tony barked out a laugh, “I didn’t used to. But then again I get the impression I was the same way for you.”
I don’t know why I keep trying. I should just stop torturing myself trying to write this goddamn letter that I know I’ll never send.
I hope you’re having a good day. I remembered how you used to make peanut butter and pickle sandwiches, and Clint would mock you endlessly. I don’t think any of them realized that it was nostalgia that made you like them. You remembered eating them as a kid. It reminded you of what your life used to be like.
“Yes, but I’m not most people, and this is not most math problems. So an unusual problem requires an unconventional solution.” Tony’s eyes flickered up to meet Steve’s and he felt his pulse quicken.
Tony shook his head, trying to jar the distracting thoughts from his mind. He settled into his workshop and cleared space to start working. But they lingered in the back of his thoughts, right next to the idle debate about what to have for lunch, and how to approach studying the xenofluid. He was good at compartmentalizing. Probably too good for his own benefit. He could tuck that thrilling set of mental images away for now. They could always be revisited later, he reasoned. Now just wasn’t the time for those kinds of ideas. He had work to do.
You always knew how to draw me back from the edge. You knew how to push me right up to that point, and pull me back. I half hated you for it, but it’s what I needed. I needed to be reminded that I’m capable of mistakes.
And I’ll keep dreaming about you. Wishing I could talk to you. Could apologize for what I said. Maybe one day I’ll stop feeling so goddamn awful. And maybe you’d apologize too.
He felt a wave of relief as his cock was suddenly freed, still straining a bit against his boxer-briefs, but nothing compared to the prison that his pants had been.
Tony found himself humming the song Steve had been whistling, and they passed the hours peacefully once more.
So Tony did what he did every time since Rhodey had insisted on this new rule. He plopped himself down in a hard, drab grey chair and pulled out his phone.
And then Steve was kissing him. It was cautious, almost afraid of what might come next, but to Tony it felt like what he imagined heaven must feel like. Not that he’d be going there after all the things he’d fantasized about doing with Steve.
Bruce glanced again at Steve and said, “His sweater doesn’t have elbow patches,” before returning his focus to his large mug of coffee.
He was surprised, clearly. And then he took in Steve’s outfit and his frown turned to an open mouthed gape. He blinked up at Steve, and it almost looked like a flush was forming on his neck and cheeks.
Steve whirled around, thoughts racing as he tried to make sense of everything, when he heard a loud sniffling noise coming from an alleyway to his right. He found Tony there, just tucked in off the main sidewalk, crouched down low with his head in his hands. He was shaking and crying, and Steve instinctively crouched down next to him, rubbing his back soothingly.
He stared down at the numbers scribbled in tight, sharp writing. It was the most beautiful thing he’d seen in a while. “Thanks. I’ll text you for sure.”
And then Steve was palming him through the fabric, his precome leaking through it and it was the most delicious kind of slick friction. He muffled a groan into Steve’s chest.
I don’t know why I’m writing this. Not even sure I’ll send this. Letters really aren’t my style. But they’re yours. I know you never really got the hang of email. So writing this on paper made sense at the time.
Maybe now he’d have someone new to text when he got lonely. It was a nice thought, and Tony hoped Steve might one day become more for him.
But before Tony could finish his sentence, Steve cut him off. “I know that this is hokey and weird, and that we’re both doing this to pay our bills, but I was having a really nice time with you, and I thought you were too. It seemed like we have a lot in common, despite having totally different career paths. You seemed genuinely nice and smart and funny. But it turns out you’re just an asshole. I should have trusted my first impression of you. I thought you were more than just the rich guy who shows up late and doesn’t deign to apologize for it, but I guess not. Now, I am gonna go find a waiter in this godforsaken restaurant and we are going to order food and finish this atrocious date, because there’s no way I’m letting you be the reason I can’t pay my bills this month.” Before Tony could reply, he stood up and strode towards the kitchen, intent on finding someone to take their order.
Besides, Rhodey didn’t need to know that the sudden grant the VA had received to update their rehabilitation wing came from yours truly.
By the time the food was ready to be plated, everyone else had shown up. Even Tony, fresh from the shower with clean clothes and water droplets in his dark locks. The sight made Steve’s breath stutter. ‘How does he manage to clean up so well?’ Steve thought to himself. He had to shake his head to clear the thought. ‘He’s Tony. He’s not into you like that. He’s not into any guy like that.’
Steve realized he was still holding on to the book, and released his grip, a wave of anxiety washing over him. “I always like the little references and cameos the author puts in. You can tell they care about the continuity of the series. It makes me think that the Goblin King from book 6 will make another appearance. It’d be a wasted opportunity to not bring him back.”
He’d hoped Tony would catch on. The man was a genius after all, but he seemed to have better things to pay attention to than the fact that one week Steve would show up in a sleek suit to exchange his finished book, and the next he’d be in something comfy and casual.
He did a little poking around on the internet and found a blurb about the author, A. Cachette. They were pretty private about their life, but they’d been writing the Lusty Billionaire series for about 7 years, and had a very dedicated fanbase.
He got lost in the work, didn’t hear when Steve finally got out of the shower, didn’t hear the rest of the team coming back from the mission they’d been out on during the Symbiote fight Tony and Steve had responded to. Didn’t even hear when Steve padded barefoot into the workshop with steaming cups of coffee and a grilled cheese sandwich.
Instinctively, he ran towards the commotion, his mind ruling out different possibilities for what could have caused such a loud noise. He found himself in front of Tony’s workshop, and could hear the creative and crude words Tony was spouting. He hesitated, unsure of what to do, but then there was another clattering, and Steve was worried Tony had hurt himself.
Special blackout shades covered the windows though, and he sighed in relief, snuggling back into his warm covers, letting sleep take him again.
Occasionally Tony would emerge out of his workshop to lay on the couch and read. Steve always loved those peaceful afternoons. Even though they were in their own little worlds, he felt connected. He loved being able to turn to Tony and ask him about a plot hole or laugh about a funny line. It reminded him of that day in the bathroom, weeks before. It was quiet. It was just them, just Tony and Steve.
Sometimes I think about calling. It’s always on me. One time I thought I had lost the phone. It had slipped out of my pocket and I didn’t notice for hours. And then suddenly it wasn’t there, and I had fucked up. And it felt like the world was crashing in.
Hour passed, and he was finally making some decent progress when he heard Steve whistling down the hallway, the sound echoing louder and louder as he approached. It sounded suspiciously like the theme from Inception. They’d watched that movie last week, and Steve had been absolutely captivated by the story. He and Tony had spent a lazy afternoon arguing the details about the ending and discussing whether that kind of technology would be useful to develop. It had been a truly excellent afternoon in Tony’s opinion.
That pang of sadness turned into longing. He wished he hadn’t tried something so silly. Tony hardly even seemed to notice these days. The first couple of times Steve had worn something outside of his comfort zone, Tony had clearly looked puzzled, but he’d reserved his usual snarky comments. Now he didn’t blink twice at it, and it made Steve a little sad.
The next morning, he sifted through his closet, past his blue and red uniforms, and the modern jeans and henleys he’d taken to wearing on days off. He knew there were some sweaters stashed in the back, along with the button ups he’d preferred when he’d first awoken from the ice. They had been a source of comfort in this new century, something that felt familiar and safe. But over time he’d started feeling out of place in starched collars and wool. It was easier to blend in, not draw quite so much attention to his unusual circumstances.
When he made it back to the workshop, he could see the green goo glowing ever so slightly in the darkened room. It reminded him of a galaxy almost. It really was gorgeous.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Not like that that Cap, you gotta remember, these are xeno-lifeforms. Their biology is totally different from ours. That’s the best words I have to describe it, but it’s not gross at all, it’s kind of beautiful honestly, like if you or I could manifest liquid mercury and control it with a single thought. And besides, I’m going to synthesize it. I don’t think there’s a lot more of these type of symbiotes out there, but I have some theories about how to replicate it with a little help from this guy,” he tapped his chest, and Steve looked down to see the soft blue glow of his arc reactor. Tony could have sworn Steve’s eyes lingered on his chest, before he swallowed and turned his focus back to Tony’s face. “I need a huge power source to pull this off, and thankfully I just developed a new prototype for Mark VII.”
“Ouch, you hurt my pride, Steve. Besides, you know that my one true love is Rhodey Bear. Too bad he’s off cavorting with Carol and doesn’t have time for me anymore.” He gave a mock pout and batted his eyelashes.
He was pushing Steve towards the door. Literally pushing him into the kitchen. Whatever suspicion Steve had previously had was immediately confirmed. Tony was hiding something.
“I see,” Steve mused, crouching down to be closer to Tony, whose eyes looked dreamy and far off. “Mind if I join you? I don’t have any math to sort out, but I’m feeling a little washed ashore after that last book. The author left it so open-ended.”
Tony’s eyes widened as he shuffled his feet uncomfortably. “I don’t really remember them all that much--,” his voice trailed off.
Steve couldn’t stop thinking about how good Tony looked. He was clearly still tired, but his face lit up when he laughed at something Thor said. And then there was the way his shirt hugged his shoulders. It made his stomach feel warm and tight and nervous. Steve knew this kind of thinking was self-destructive. They were friends and coworkers, and nothing else.
He collected his food and left the kitchen, leaving Steve wishing he’d said something. Steve was tired of these tiny interactions. He wanted Tony all to himself. He knew that was presumptive, but maybe he needed to be a little more like Sawyer. He needed to be proactive, because Tony didn’t seem aware of message Steve was trying to send him.
“Typical,” Steve muttered into the depths of the communal fridge. Tony was barely awake at noon most days. So why was he up so early, and on a Saturday of all things? He was usually in his workshop at all hours of the night, and slept in until the last possible moment.
That research morphed into Steve spending all night curled up in bed, devouring the first three books. They were hot. And funny. And Steve found himself relating quite a bit to the earnest, practical Sawyer. He had never meant to get caught up in a torrid love affair with Tristan, but Sawyer couldn’t help himself.
Tony had apparently been reading while walking and hadn’t seen him either. He paled, and then hurriedly bent to grab his book.
He wanted to tease him so mercilessly that Steve couldn’t take it anymore. Edge him until he was sobbing, desperate to finally come. God that would feel good. To unravel him so deeply that Steve broke his word and acted impulsively.
A you that maybe never really existed. I don’t know who the Steve I knew was. Maybe he’s different from Bucky’s Steve. Maybe none of them are the real you.
Just as he was considering texting Bucky an update, the door burst open and he turned to see a dark haired man stumble in, clearly disheveled. He was shorter and leaner than Steve, with a carefully manicured goatee and mustache, maybe a couple years younger than him. His clothes were rumpled, but clearly much more expensive than anything Steve owned. His flashy sneakers and big sunglasses were probably worth far more than the rent money he was doing this show for.
Sometimes he wondered if Tony wanted to die. He certainly acted like it from the outside. But no, Steve knew him better. Knew how hard Tony had fought his whole life to survive. He’d fought his way back from death in that cave, and he’d dedicated his life to protecting those who couldn’t fight for themselves. It was one of the many things he admired about Tony.
You know what the worst part of this is? Sometimes I’ll wake at night and want to call. Not to talk about anything that matters. No, sometimes I miss just talking. You always knew how to get on my bad side. But I even miss that. I miss you being right sometimes. I miss being friends. Because you were right. You were one of my only friends. And I’m sorry. I’m so so sorry.
He wanted to know what it was like to make Tony submit. To make him shut up for once in his goddamn life. To make that pretty mouth moan his name.
Rubbing the back of his head sheepishly, Tony grinned and shrugged. “This new suit is trying to talk back to me, so to speak. I’m upgrading the repulsors, but the parts aren’t fitting together the way they should. You probably heard one of the engines falling on my face.”
Steve had spent quite a long time in the shower, Tony noticed. Usually he was the one to be in and out in under 5 minutes, probably a holdover from his days of scarcity as a boy, Tony assumed. But he’d been in there for more than an hour, with no sign of being done.
So they joked around and teased each other and Tony pretended not to notice the way his heart raced when Steve gave him small shy smiles, pretended not to love Steve.
Steve grasped onto Tony’s cock, loving the gasp he let out at the sudden touch, and began pumping. Tony was achingly hard, sticky and wet with desire. He stroked up and down, teasing the head just enough to get another whine from him, all the while grinding his own cock against Tony’s thigh. He kept whispering in Tony’s ear as Tony nuzzled him. Steve told him how sexy he was, how proud he was for Tony being so patient and compliant, that he was such a good little cockslut. He knew Tony would get weak in the knees from all the dirty talk, and soon he was supporting Tony’s weight, holding him up in their kneeling position while he rubbed up and down Tony’s length, faster and faster.
Then again, they were in a large empty room with lots of other chairs to choose from, and this guy had chosen the one next to Tony. That had to mean something, right?
Tony didn’t look up when Steve entered, instead he turned the page of his book as his eyes rapidly scanned the text. Steve couldn’t see what he was reading, but he’d never known Tony to be an avid reader. He’d usually teased Steve and Nat for being so excited about whatever fantasy series they were into at the time.
He wanted someone to talk to. Pepper was in an all-day board meeting, and he couldn’t text Rhodey, for obvious reasons.
Despite their many differences, and man, there were a lot, Steve just understood him. Could anticipate what he needed before he could voice it. They clicked in a way Tony didn’t with most people. And he had a feeling Steve felt the same way. He’d had a hard transition into the modern world. He was good at faking it, but Tony knew better. Knew he’d felt stupid and slow when faced with simple things like an ATM or microwave settings. He was one of the smartest people Tony knew, but he was at a huge disadvantage for not having grown up with modern technology.
Steve let out a jutting breath, as if trying to regain control of himself. That gave Tony all sorts of filthy ideas, and he ground against him once more, this time slower, more sultry. He bit his lip just enough to catch Steve’s attention, and the hungry look that flashed across his face made Tony’s cock pulse.
Tony conked out in his chair, mouth open and what appeared to be drool dribbling down his cheek, embarrassingly.
“Uhm, uh, yeah, I guess.” Tony was looking anywhere but at Steve. “They’re silly, but they make the time pass.”
Tony looked up from examining his fingernails but didn’t reply. Steve’s words seemed to have surprised him, and he even looked a little embarrassed. “I’m sorry, I---” he started.
I like to imagine you’re drinking your first cup of coffee right now. It’s mid morning in New York right now. You’re probably just crawling out of bed after a long night in your workshop. I used to make you coffee. Do you miss that? You always made fun of me for drinking more milk and sugar than coffee. But I secretly liked it. I liked that you noticed things like that. I liked that coffee was our thing.
I mean, I know, but fuck. We don’t need to delve too deep into that. It’s already fucked up enough that I’m writing these to you even though you'll never read them.
I thought I could do both. Protect him from the world and protect you from the knowledge of what happened to your parents. From what they made Bucky do. But I guess not even my best intentions can make up for what happened. For the pain I inflicted on you.
It was peculiar to see Tony so still. He was used to the near-manic obsession that usually possessed him.
Steve was right. Dr. Cho and her team were fantastic, and now that they’d gotten some extra support from that anonymous donor, they were able to properly help their patients the way they’d been trying to all along.
“I’m going full Tristan in Number 23, taking you back to my room and having my way with you.” Tony said, leaning in close enough that Steve could feel his warm breath on his skin.
He continued rifling through the contents of the fridge, shoving past the precariously tall stack of yogurt labelled with Sam’s name, and the questionable leftovers that had clearly been there too long to still be edible. Those were probably Clint’s. Steve considered tossing them, but knowing Clint, he’d throw a fit about someone touching his food, even if it was about a week past date.
“So much for getting shawarma after this,” Steve said regretfully. “I feel like I need to shower for the next decade.”
Steve let out a reluctant chuckle, “That’s true, when I first got the book set in the mail I had to lock myself in my room to read them because I knew one of them might burst into my room and catch me reading them.” He leaned down to kiss Tony, savoring how good he tasted. “Could get used to this,” he mumbled.
The paddle was a different sensation than his palm, more stingy and concentrated. Tony yelped with each hit, eyes rolling up from the pleasure and pain of it. He thrusted up against Steve’s hand in between hits, and was clearly seeking out his pleasure, eager for reward. It hurt like hell, but Tony was greedy for more.
“Say, what did you think about the chapter in book 3 where they have to create that time loop?” Steve looked at Tony, eagerly awaiting his reply.
Tony paused, seemed to contemplate Steve’s outstretched hand for a moment, then shook it, smiling in return. “No, it’s my first time too, looking for love on national TV, I mean.” He blushed a little, which only made Steve find him more attractive. “What made you wanna do this show?”
“So…” and Steve looked so shy, so cautious as he spoke that it made Tony want to laugh. How could he not know just how badly Tony wanted this too, especially after that scorching kiss?
He swallowed what he wanted to say and picked up a menu, ignoring the cruel words. Steve pretended to read it, not really able to pay attention to anything printed on the page, and glanced around for a waiter.
I always thought myself a smart man, not the brightest, but I could get by. And then I met you. And you dazzled me. Your greatest weapon always was your mind, Tony. And I’m realizing more and more each day what an idiot I am.
The thought of it made Tony hard all over again, and he could imagine the look on Steve’s face as he finally gave in, finally let himself have the release he’d been chasing. His eyes would close with a slight pained expression, but his mouth would be quirked up into a lewd smile. He’d clench his jaw and let it ride through him like waves, not stopping his frantic hand until he’d milked every last drop from his swollen cock. He’d lean back against the wall of the shower, panting a little, half delirious from the high of coming. And the water would keep rushing over his sculpted body, washing away the remnants of soap as he came down from euphoria.
Tony gave him a wink as he accepted the slip of paper, which looked like it had been ripped from a blank page in Steve’s book. He was feeling a little more back to his cocky self after seeing Steve blush so earnestly
Do you remember the late nights when everyone else was asleep and you’d drag yourself out of your workshop? We’d meet in the hallway, or the kitchen, and you’ve give me that soft, sleepy smile. The one that felt real. No mask of confidence or cockiness. Just you and me, standing in the dim light of the open fridge, as we rooted around looking for something to eat. Your shoulder would bump into me, or your strong, calloused hands would graze mine, and I could feel a thrill run through me each time.
He switched on an overhead light and found his gunmetal grey watch exactly where he’d thought it had been left, and made short work of putting it on. The heavy chill of it felt comforting. He was turning to walk back to his room when something caught his eye.
I don’t know if I’ll ever stop apologizing. Maybe one day I can say it to your face. Maybe one day I won’t need to apologise anymore. But for now, I hope you know I’m sorry.
The pink book lay in the pot, one of its’ corners shoved into the dirt. It clearly hadn’t been disturbed since Tony had thrust it so unceremoniously into the plant.
Sometimes I think about your what your hands would feel like. Reaching out to touch mine. Holding my face. Grasping my hips. I don’t think I was ready to admit that before. To admit how I feel. Felt. No, feel.
Why? Why did you lie? What made you throw everything away for a man you hadn’t seen in 70 some years? I’m not sure I really want to know.
Steve shouldered the rest of the door open, eyes crinkling when he saw Tony, stretched out under the workbench, staring up at the underside of it. He’d assumed Tony was working on something fiddly and mechanical. But no, he was just staring into space, eyes half-glazed.
Tony’s grin was sunshine to Steve, he let it wash over him, basking in how good it felt to be the center of his attention.
“Well it worked. Took me an embarrassing long time to catch on, but it was worth it. Besides, I wouldn’t mind seeing you in that robe again someday.”
This gorgeous guy had the same blank, pained expression that Tony imagined he probably had whenever he was in this waiting room, and he cleared his throat, wanting to speak but uncertain.
Steve grasped onto him, delicate and sweet in the most Steve way possible. But then that naughty glint in his eyes returned and he started stroking, and fuck fuck fuck. Where had he learned that? How could the literal beacon of wholesome American values be so goddamn incredible at stroking him off?
So he stared at his phone, contemplating trying his luck to sneak past the nurse on guard duty. They’d already caught him trying to sneak back once a couple of weeks ago, and made it a habit to have someone on the lookout now. They was annoyingly supportive of Rhodey’s wishes.
“You saw the rest, I’m assuming?” He didn’t sound mad. That was surprising to Tony. Didn’t sound upset at all. More like a statement of fact.
When he had finished cleaning up the mess, Steve straightened up, and looked at Tony properly for the first time in so many minutes. He tried to crack a smile, and told him, “By god, I think he’ll live to see another day.”
But Tony hadn’t denied that he’d read the series. Sure, he’d tried to downplay it, but he hadn’t denied it.
“Good boy,” Steve said happily, patting Tony’s cheek. “You’re already learning to be quiet unless you’ve been asked to speak.” Tony’s eyes closed, pressing his cheek up into the solid warmth of Steve’s hand. “Such a good boy,” Steve reiterated.
Tony made a face as he spread out his fingers, watching as the goop clung to the metal gauntlet. The Symbiote was definitely dead, exploded into a billion fractions by a sonic amplifier, thanks to some quick thinking on his part. They’d never fought a Symbiote before, but he’d been keeping tabs on Eddie Brock and Venom ever since they came onto his radar, and he’d learned enough to know that the creatures hated certain ranges of sound.
I’m still pissed as hell. The fact that you lied for god knows how long. Looked me in the eye and pretended you knew nothing. Fuck. I don’t get it.
She nodded, bending down to clean up the mess she’d made, “I’ve had money on this for at least a year. Honestly we were starting to get bored of it until Steve decided to play dress up. Then Bruce and Thor decided to finally get in on it. I was starting to worry you idiots would never get together. I better go tell the rest so we can sort out who owes who what.” She gave a cheerful wave, and started walking away, then called back to them, “Rhodey will be pissed. He bet it would take at least another 6 months! I can’t wait to see the look on his face.”
“I think our dear friends may have caught on a little earlier than us that we like each other, and were placing wagers on it,” Tony explained, glancing to Nat for confirmation.
Rhodey gave him a sideways glance as they made it to the elevator, “So are we gonna talk about the gorgeous hunk of a man who just gave you his number?”
Which was why it was so damn annoying that Rhodey had started insisting Tony stay in the waiting room. He had kept trying to keep Tony at arm’s length since his accident, and it was frustrating as hell. His friend had never been great about accepting help, but fuck, he didn’t have to outright tell the nursing staff to bar Tony from coming back into the patient area for godssake.
“Yeah.” Tony nods with a smile. His eyes flicker in the direction of their oldest son and he stretches a hand out to softly caress Peter’s face. Peter stirs and his dark eyes flutter open.
“My nephew’s aren’t at that age anymore so unfortunately I can’t help you there. But I do have a new recommendation for you.”
Sam is there beside him, holding his hand and rubbing a thumb over his knuckles to soothe him. Natasha was grateful Bucky had Sam. Bucky would probably crumble completely if not for him.
Of course Steve complained when he caught him serving himself another cup of coffee or when he promised he’d be upstairs for dinner and ended up working for another two hours until Steve had to drag him away. Secretly, Tony liked it when Steve intervened. It reminded him that someone was looking out for him.
I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to update! I got stuck because I wasn't sure what to write but after some help I figured it out. Thank you so much for being patient and I hope you all enjoy this update!
Steve can’t respond and continues to vomit into the bowl beneath him. Tony waits until he’s finished before offering a wad of tissue.
“This is...different. I’m so used to her being closer, pressed against me and now…” Steve’s eyes glisten with fresh tears.
Peter’s face grows hot and he sinks into the leather seat. A part of him is still annoyed with his dad for telling Happy about his pregnancy, but the other half is relieved. He was hiding a huge secret, one only a small handful of people knew about. Even his uncles and aunt didn’t know. If anyone else deserved to know about the baby then it would be Happy. He was loyal and someone Peter could trust.
“I can get by on my own,” Steve says. And it’s true. He had no problem raising the baby by himself. If Tony wanted to be on board, he’d let him. And if he didn’t, then that was okay too.
“Is my dad okay?” Peter tries again to make conversation. This time he gets a response that isn’t sarcastic or dripping with annoyance.
“Probably at Stark’s,” Bucky says with a roll of his eyes. He hasn’t gotten over the fact that a 15 year old tricked him. Sam wasn’t surprised that Peter had been so sneaky. It’s what teenagers do. Sam was pretty sure what upset Bucky was the fact that a teenager went over The Winter Soldier's head.
James finishes his hot chocolate fairly quickly, but Steve’s not surprised. He cleans more whipped cream from his son’s face, then together they look at the stars until James is falling back asleep.
“It’s not...good, Nat.” Steve turns away from her to release the bag from the chain, but then she’s quickly reaching out for him and stopping him from pulling it off.
“Come on.” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand and attempts to pull him up, only to stop when Steve cries out again.
“Hey,” he says soothingly and reaches for Tony’s free hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. “I’m sorry our shopping trip didn’t go so well.”
Tony is snapped from his thoughts when he feels tugging on the sleeve of his jacket. He glances down, for a moment forgetting where he was and who he was with. Peter smiles softly at him and then gestures toward the gravesite. Tony’s eyes follow, his heart clenching painfully and eyes filling with tears.
This pregnancy was going to be different this time around. For one he was aware of the life he and Tony created. He paid closer attention to the signs. He wasn’t going to miss this.
He stutters put a reply, only to be silenced when his dad cuts him off. “And don’t deny it or give me some bullshit story. What is this?”
Peter is up a few hours later, his cries coming through the baby monitor and alerting Steve. At the sound of his son’s cries, Steve is jumping out of bed to comfort him.
“To help. To remind you of all the reasons why you shouldn’t accept defeat. You’ve already abandoned the only family you’ve ever known. Please don’t do it a second time.”
“I guess the baby doesn’t like pancakes,” Steve chuckles softly and reaches over his son to flush away the evidence of Peter’s morning sickness. “It’s okay. I couldn’t really stomach them either. Especially chocolate chip.”
Before he can even think of something to cover up his mistake, Tony is reaching out and cupping his face, forcing him to turn and meet the eyes he can’t get enough of.
“No!” Steve cries out, his outburst startling the baby. The room fills with the sounds of distress the pup makes and Steve tries quickly to get him calm again. His efforts fail and Peter’s piercing cries ring out in the room.
“Stop. He’s going to get more info and send it later. I’m assuming this is for all of us. If you want to stay then-”
Their bedroom is a mess. Pictures of them have been knocked off the walls, broken glass scattering the floor. Steve is huddled on the floor near the edge of the bed, one hand tugging roughly on his hair while he cries and his other hand is resting in his lap, covered in red.
“How do you want to do this?” Tony asks, smiling softly down at his mate and carding his fingers through the omega’s hair.
Bucky blows out a breath, doing everything he can not to cry again. Sam senses this and lays a hand over his shoulder, squeezing it reassuringly. He decides to change the subject.
Peter slips his hand with his father’s, their fingers interlocking. His eyes roam over the wound Bruce is frantically trying to get under control. The blood keeps flowing, and Peter has to turn away.
“Oh relax, boys,” Natasha rolls her eyes and begins pouring everyone a glass of wine. “It’s Peter. He isn’t capable of doing anything wrong. Steve made sure of that.”
Tony would know. He’s been on a few different brands in his lifetime. It took time for him to find one that actually worked and mellowed the symptoms. But with Steve it’s different. He still has his good and bad days, but lately it’s as if he’s had more bad than good. The medication should be doing it’s thing by now.
“You look so pretty, darling.” Tony comments, his eyes roaming over Steve’s exposed body. He was the definition of perfection.
“Yeah.” There’s a hint of a smile on Steve’s lips. He can’t wait to bring his baby home. But at the same time he’s scared. He never thought he’d have to care for a baby before. “You’ll be here, right?”
They were supposed to be taking care of their son together, and though that plan had been working out initially, Tony’s honestly not sure how it was going to work now after their recent argument. Tony was willing to take the blame for the fight. He had been the one to upset Steve.
“Tony, I’m trying. Believe me I am. But you don’t know him like I do. You don’t know how...extreme he can be.”
He doesn’t blame his husband for the lack of enjoyment. Tony as always was beautiful and the famous glow brought on from pregnancy had finally made itself known. His hair was softer too; Steve wanted to run his fingers through it all the time. Tony was perfect.
The room remains silent except for the quiet beeping of the machines his uncle is connected to. Peter lays his head down on the bed, listening to the soft beeping. It reminds him of the last moment he had with his papa, but this time he hopes for a happy ending.
Tony nods and carefully places their youngest in Steve’s arms. The older pups grow curious and crane their necks to get a better look at the stranger. Harley leans closer to sniff the baby.
He’s careful when he positions himself on top, not wanting to apply too much pressure and force Tony deep into the mattress. It takes a moment for him to get used to the new position.
Steve chugs down half the bottle before answering, “Why? They’re not that fun. And you’d have to get up early.”
“Thank you, Nat.” Steve curls up against his friend once they climb into bed. They had boundaries like all friends do, but he was comfortable around her. She had been his first real friend since coming out of the ice.
Tony doesn't want to believe it, but maybe Pepper was right. So far she was the only one making sense.
Peter doesn’t bother trying to defend his dad. Tony Stark was kind of a dick. And maybe Peter only thought so because of the history between his parents. He told himself he’d never hold a grudge, but some days it was hard not to.
Tony grits his teeth and his fingers tighten around the glass. He’s pretty sure if he squeezed any harder the glass will shatter.
“No!” Tony nearly shouts and gets up from his chair, needing to pace. “He shouldn’t have been so careless!”
“Yeah. I know I said we’d move back to New York and stay in the tower but there’s not enough room for all of us. We can stay in New York but I’ll find us a bigger space. The pups will love being outside. We can wrestle until the sun goes down, maybe look up at the stars. It’ll be great.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for. I'm the one who...well, you know what I did. And I can stand here and apologize but you’ll never forgive me, and I’ll never forgive myself.”
James, being the bravest of the three, pokes his head out first and sniffs the air, searching for the person behind the voice. His nose wrinkles and his brows draw together in confusion.
She steps into the hall and takes a deep breath. It would have been easier to hide out in the private bathroom her office had, but everyone would know where she was. She needed to escape and be alone, gather her thoughts. Pepper realizes now how wrong she had been. She couldn’t be alone now.
“‘M okay,” Steve slurs and his eyes flutter. He slowly glances at his mate again. “Get him...first…”
“I gave him the sketch,” Sam says, and everyone glances in his direction. “I...I figured now would’ve been a good time. He needed something positive today.”
Tony curses to himself as he tries to remember what floor his son was on. He wishes he had Jarvis to aid him right about now. He misses his friend and makes a promise to create him a bigger hard drive once he gets home.
When he finally closed the pages on the most current book, he felt a pang of sadness. He’d grown to really love and care about these two idiots in love.
Clint gave him an easy smile, kind and calming. “Take it easy, I was just fucking with you, man. It’s different, but it works for you somehow. I like it.”
Hot pressure curled inside him and he couldn’t take it anymore. A low moan rumbled from somewhere deep inside his chest and then he was coming, spurting thick white fluid all over Steve’s hand, some of it splattering up onto his stomach and dripping down, a slimy mess of pleasure and satisfaction.
“I, I think part of me wanted you to find it. I knew I’d never get the guts to show you myself. Part of me wanted you to know though.” Steve’s voice was gentle as he spoke, and Tony felt a sprig of hope nestle inside him at the words.
Steve had considered how he’d answer if Tony asked that question, and he’d settled on the truth, so he explained how Bucky had signed him up for it because he knew it had been a lean couple of months commission-wise and his savings account was drying up.
He could feel a tight strain in his lungs and finally broke away, panting and gasping as oxygen filled his lungs. He felt a pang of loss at the separation from Steve, and let his hands roam up his hair, playing with the silky golden strands. Steve had been growing it out, just enough that he had something to grip onto, thankfully, and he stood up fully now, peering up into Steve’s searching blue eyes.
“I didn’t think you liked the real me,” Steve could feel something just shy of electricity running through his veins.
Clint rolled his eyes, and sighed exaggeratedly. “You know what I mean. You look like you’re ready to go to a sock hop. Or maybe spank me with a paddle for not paying attention in class.” He laughed at his own joke, and Steve could feel his stomach churning with anxiety.
Steve had spent hours at a time fantasizing about it. About pinning him to the ground and seeing Tony, eyes wide with surprise, following each and every order Steve gave.
So he stormed into his workshop, cranked up his stereo and rummaged through the pile of parts he’d been working on for days.
And really, that’s what Tony was, wasn’t he? A renegade on a team full of soldiers who refused to get in line.
It would have been believable, if not for the red flush rising up from his neck into his cheeks. It was pretty adorable, Steve had to admit.
Steve had perfected every detail of his sculpted facial hair and the furrow in his brow when he was annoyed.
He was  incredibly aware in this moment of just how much of a height difference there was between them. Having to crane his neck a little more than he’d like he’d admit. It made him feel small and safe in way he’d not felt before. Like Steve could do anything to him and he wouldn’t be able to stop it, but Steve would never do anything to him that he didn’t want, and there was a sweet comfort in knowing that. In knowing that despite all his super soldier strength, Steve would never use it against him, would prioritize Tony’s comfort and safety over his own. It had always been that way, really.
“Wait!” Steve’s voice called out, and Tony turned to see him jogging down the hall to meet up with them. “Uhm. Here’s my number, if you ever want to talk more about… everything.” His face was beet red, and Tony guessed it wasn’t from running to catch them.
Eventually, Steve caught up to all the books that had been published so far. He’d been working his way tirelessly through them, eager to find out what happened next in the adventures of Tristan and Sawyer. If he happened to imagine that it was him and Tony traveling the multiverse on a quest to rid themselves of an evil curse, all the while falling more and more in love with each other, then that was his business. No one else needed to know.
Tony gave him a little nod, and that was apparently all Steve needed to know before letting his fingers nimbly undoing the button and zipper on his tight black jeans.
“Me too,” Tony’s soft smile deepened when he finally took in Steve’s outfit. “You’re back to being you.” He sounded mildly surprised. “I always did like that shirt.”
Tony didn’t waste a second, “Hey, didn’t you say you’d help Clint with setting up his outdoor target practice? I think I heard him get up a while ago, you should probably go help him with that, you gotta deliver on your promises, Steve. That’s what Captain America is all about, right? Keeping promises. Gotta get a move on!”
When he finally received the email notification that his package had come, Steve scrambled down to where the incoming mail was collected, and grabbed up the parcel. It took a lot of willpower to not rip into the packaging on his way back to his room, but he remembered that anyone could walk by and see what he’d ordered. It was easier to open it in private than risk Natasha or Sam prying into things.
Only sometimes you’d smile at me in those hours long meetings, when Fury was really going in on us on how much of a disappointment we were to him. You’d smile, and I knew you were thinking the same thing as me. And I fell a little bit in love with that smile. Love. I don’t know if that’s what it was, but it sure felt like that. Still does.
Steve grimaced, and noticed the thin line of blood running down Tony’s temple, “That looks like it hurts.” Without thinking, he crossed the distance between them and crouched down to examine the wound.
He’d always assumed Tony was straight. They all had. The years of being a self-proclaimed playboy had sealed that reputation. Steve had seen numerous tabloid articles about his girls of the week, always thin and gorgeous, with long flowing hair. He seemed particularly fond of redheads.
And if Steve was being totally honest with himself, he’d imagined Tony during all those love scenes. Tristan was fiery and enigmatic. He was a passionate lover and more than a little kinky. Steve had found the dining room scene at the end of book two especially enthralling.
It’s hard to reconcile the people we truly are with the heroes the world sees. I wanted you to see the shiny, glossy exterior. I couldn’t admit that until now. I couldn’t bear to let you know who I am under everything. Just a scared, broke boy from Brooklyn, who thought he had to beat up bigger bullies because it was easier than confronting his own demons.
Not just a person, a Greek statue of a man, all blonde hair and muscles and chiseled jaw. He was staring intently at the pages of a book, but Tony noticed his eyes weren’t moving across the page, he was just staring at the same passage of text, as if willing it to do something, anything.
‘This is just for research,’ he told himself. ‘I just need to find out what kind of guy he’s interested in.’
Occasionally he’d register Steve shifting in his chair, or a quiet cough or muttering, but mostly they worked in silence, lost in their respective work.
Steve’s heart was pounding, “I want to believe so. I want to believe that at least some of us will.”
It he was being entirely honest, his fingers itched to get his hands on it again, but he settled into his work from last night, reviewing where he’d left off and what his focus today would be.
He realized Tony wasn’t going to back down, and even though he could have easily overpowered him, Steve sighed and resigned himself to making breakfast. Better to drop it now and ask Tony about this later. He clearly wasn’t getting anywhere.
Basically, Steve’s mind was a super computer that had just missed a few updates along the way. But it pained Tony to know that Steve was floundering when it came to things like the self checkout at the grocery store, so he’d started offering to help him, to teach him things. At first Steve had politely declined, said he was getting along just fine. But Tony kept offering, and eventually Steve started accepting his help.
He hadn’t seen the cover very well, but it was a deep shade of pink, almost red. It was an odd color choice for a technical manual, and by this point Steve seriously doubted that’s what it actually was. He’d seen glimpses of an illustration on the cover.
The rest of the team had been surprisingly quiet on the matter as well. At first he’d been terrified that they’d catch on to his foolish plan, but short of a couple of jokes about Steve playing dress up, they seemed to shrug it off. They probably assumed he was trying to figure out how to fit in in the modern world.
And then there were the suits, diagrams and blueprints for nearly every Iron Man Mark since Steve had begun hanging around the lab, it seemed. Some were technical and precise. Some were looser, more of a feeling than a replication of the details. Tony loved these most out of all the suit sketches.
Tony had his fair share of practice with kissing. Most of it good, some of it great, a few regrettable experiences too. He could tell Steve was inexperienced. He lacked the finesse and calm that Tony had perfected over the years. But god, he made up for it with intensity. He kissed Tony like his very life depended on showing just how badly he wanted, no, needed him. There was something unrestrained in the way he grasped onto Tony’s hip and shoulder, as if desperate to find a way to show him how badly he needed him. It left Tony breathless, knowing that Steve could become that unraveled because of him. Well, and it didn’t help that Tony had hardly come up for air since Steve had first initiated the kiss.
He pulled out a crisp blue dress shirt, along with a deep grey wool sweater. He dug around a little more and found a wool necktie that he’d always loved.
“Hi, I’m Steve, nice to meet you.” He stuck out his hand, trying to hide his previous annoyance with a kind smile. No use in mentioning Tony’s tardiness, he might as well make the most out of the situation they were in. “This is kinda weird for me, have you done this before?”
He jiggled his hand trying to get the sticky fluid off. It wasn’t particularly effective, and speckled even more across his Iron Man-suited torso. “Well fuck, somehow this stuff leaked into the armor and definitely drenched my suit. Brand new Tom Ford. Just had it custom made and I didn’t have time to get changed when we got the call. Don’t suppose dry cleaning would work, huh?”
He couldn’t imagine telling Tony outright. That was far too intense and frankly embarrassing if Tony shot him down. And no way would he tell him he knew about the book. Tony would never admit that he read raunchy gay romance novels. Let alone 26 of them, if Steve’s assumption that he was an avid fan of the series was correct.
He didn’t know what to do with this new found information, but just knowing was enough for now, he thought, as he drifted off to sleep.
This was probably all going to crash and burn, and everyone else on the team would have a good laugh at him over it. But he had to try. Tony was too important to not try for.
Steve leaned into the touch, his eyes slowly closing as he savored the way Tony’s hand felt on his cheek. His skin was soft and warm and perfect, and Tony was scared to do anything, lest he disturb the utter perfection that was Steve in this moment.
Steve had noticed the book was gone that afternoon, and Tony along with it. It looked like he’d been about halfway through it this morning, and Steve figured he was holed up in his room, eagerly finishing the second half of the novel. It was distracting, knowing what Tony was reading about, but he tried his best to act normal and not let himself get too antsy about when his books would be delivered.
A little French bistro appeared on screen, and the camera zoomed in on a nervous looking blonde man. He was tall and incredibly well built. Classic American looks and perfect muscles that looked impossible for any man to have. He checked his watch again, clearly annoyed with having to wait.
Still, he crouched behind the chair, just in case someone happened to walk by and take an interest in what he was looking at.
This has become a bit of a habit. When I’m stressed I’ve started composing letters in my head. Sometimes it’s just shouting. Sometimes I say things I could never put on paper. And sometimes I write it down. Like now.
“I’ll bring coffee next time. You’re right, Nurse Jessica can’t brew coffee for shit,” Tony replied, before turning back to join Rhodey. “Well, let’s head home. You wanna grab cheeseburgers on the way?”
This one certainly had that approach. He and Steve had tried to reason with it, tried to find out what it wanted. But what it wanted, apparently, was to destroy half of Lower Manhattan and use it’s many hosts up while it basked in the fun it was having. Tony felt a pang of regret that it had to end this way, but this Symbiote, with its oozing sludge and whip-like tentacles didn’t want to be reasoned with, and ultimately they had to do what they’d been attempting to prevent.
Steve kept teasing him through the fabric of his underwear, and it was ridiculously not fair. He wanted more, needed more, but it didn’t seem like Steve was in any rush to get to the main event. What a cock tease.
“Tony’s always weird,” Sam piped in. “The man hardly sleeps and I swear, one night I came in here to get some water and he was just standing there, in front of the fridge. Didn’t say anything to me, didn’t even open the fridge, just stood there for a minute, and then walked away.”
Plus he was damn gorgeous. Even his cocky smile when he knew he was right about something made Steve feel warm heat rise in his cheeks. He’d spent months trying to deny it, but seeing the book Tony had been reading lit a fire within him. Steve had thought he didn’t have a chance, but this proved otherwise.
“I uhm, I was feeling nostalgic. I got these clothes when I first came back, and I miss wearing them sometimes.” Steve felt like he was stuttering, like he couldn’t get the words out right.
Tony eased back into his chair, let his heartbeat calm a bit, and then gratefully accepted the coffee. Steve had slid it across the table to him, knowing he was uncomfortable being handed things. It was yet another way Steve showed he paid attention. The other Avengers forgot half the time, and Tony was pretty sure Clint intentionally found reasons to hand him things just to fuck with him. But Steve was always careful to set things down and slide them to him, every single time. It was one of the numerous reasons he had fallen for Steve, not that he’d ever admit to it.
Before Tony knew it, Rhodey was rolling back through the waiting room door, looking a little sweaty from the last hour of hard work, but pleased.
That made Steve’s blood boil. He was poor, yes, but his mama had raised him with manners and he had come fully prepared to offer to pay for Tony’s meal in addition to his own. He told Tony as much, his hands shaking as he gripped onto the cheap laminated menu.
Steve frowned. Tony had always been a little obsessive when it came to his work. Okay, a lot. But usually it in went in cycles. He’d stay up for a few days on a quest to perfect whatever his current project was, and then they wouldn’t see him for a day or two while he slept off the exhaustion.
He tried on the outfit, choosing some khaki slacks to complete the outfit, and was stunned at the man reflected back at him. Steve hadn’t seen this version of himself in quite some time, and it was a good look. He felt sexy, even.
Steve knew he was being too hard on Tony. He could see it in the way Tony’s jaw would clench, how the tendons in his hands would protrude. He’d spent far too many hours studying the little changes in Tony’s body. They’d be 6 hours into a SHIELD debriefing and Steve would feel himself getting restless, legs aching to be stretched. And his eyes would wander to Tony. He’d studied the man with an artist’s eye. Or, at least that’s what he told himself it was about. Best not to think too hard about the fact that he had little interest in studying the minute movements of any of his other teammates.
They kept still for a few moments, neither daring to move or shift their sight away from the other. Tony licked his lips, and then suddenly he was pushing himself up, palms pressed firmly on the hard cold floor, and he was kissing Steve, and it was incredible.
He’d jacked up the amplification on his suit’s speakers, and with the help of Steve’s shield as a makeshift parabolic concentrator, they’d been able to seperate the alien creature from the host body it had taken over. Without a host to take shelter in, combined with the high decibels, the green Symbiote hadn’t stood a chance. It was worth the ringing in their ears to stop half of Canal Street from being ripped to shreds.
Steve gulped, heart hammering in his chest, “Or, or at least coordinate better for when we do run into each other. It’s probably hell on these hard covers.” He hoped Tony didn’t notice the way his hand shook as he handed the book to him. Or the way his eyes lingered on the cover. Volume 29: The Lusty Billionaire and The Christmas Lumberjack.
Tony keeps up with his usual schedule of getting up early and preparing Steve his tea and vitamins. Steve eventually wakes up and emerges from the bathroom after a grueling round of morning sickness.
Steve sniffs the air, scenting the strangers, then realization hits. They weren’t strangers. They were his pups.
He doesn’t tell anyone. His uncle told him he could talk to him or his aunt about it, but he can’t bring himself to do it. They’d probably question his choice or maybe be disappointed in it.
“Yeah! Good job, buddy. Now look at this.” Tony applies the color his son chose to his secret project. Harley squeals in excitement. “Cool, huh? Hmm, maybe it’s too much red. Let’s add another.”
“Hey, hey, Tony. Shhh, it’s okay. You’re okay.” He tried to speak in a low soft voice, and he could feel Tony leaning into his touch. “I know that wasn’t really you back there, the mean stuff.  I know you were just in over your head and felt like you didn’t have a choice. I understand, I felt the same way. Hey, hey, it’s okay, I promise.” He kept rubbing Tony’s back, and he realized that as bizarre as this whole situation had become, he really liked the feel of Tony’s body pressed against his. Their warmth melding together. Somehow holding Tony, comforting him felt totally natural, he didn’t have to question if he was doing the right thing. He knew without thinking too hard how to calm Tony down.
I'm playing around with the idea of expanding this into another chapter or two. Let me know if you'd like to read that!
So Steve would drag it out, silently gathering supplies for what he planned to do next. He’d cross the room and let his fingers drag across Tony’s spine as he sauntered by, delighting in the visible shudder Tony couldn’t restrain. Or he’d bend down and kiss him, keeping his palms planted firmly on Tony’s shoulders, setting a physical boundary between them, even as he deepened the kiss, driving Tony desperate for more. Just as Tony started to whine against the lack of closeness, Steve would pull away, tutting with a sly smile. The look of hunger and need in Tony’s eyes would be all Steve needed to know how badly he wanted this too.
He climbs up onto the table anyway and wiggles around, wincing from the paper crinkling beneath him. “I want to go home. Papa, can we just go?”
Happy is waiting for her in the office, still in the same spot she had left him a few minutes prior. He hasn’t moved from the chair since the last of the police interviews. It’s his job to protect her and keep her safe, but deep down she knows his presence is for comfort and not protection.
The omega does his best to wash fast, but his body aches and screams for relief. The hot water helps the soreness in his muscles, but it was going to take more than a shower to alleviate the pain.
Tony glances up at the other two people in the room, silently begging them for some privacy. Sam nods and gestures for Bucky to follow. The ex-assassin is hesitant to leave his best friend, but then he’s forced to give in and follow Sam out of the room.
Not getting to say his goodbyes was what haunted Tony for years. The last time they spoke wasn’t exactly the happiest. He would give anything to go back and have things turn out differently.
Tony frowns. “Hmm. You see that’s where I have a problem. I can deal with the no missions and the weight gain...I think. But no coffee is a huge sacrifice for me.”
Steve, being the polite one that he is, smiles and slips the vial back into the bag. “Thank you, Thor. I’ll um...keep it for a rainy day.”
Tony sighs harshly and follows Peter’s gaze. “I gave up on those a long time ago. I’m not Iron Man anymore.”
“Maguna!” He cries and jumps off the couch to greet her. Morgan sighs in annoyance. That was her dad’s nickname for her but Harley loved to steal it from time to time.
“So Sarah will be the flower girl and Peter the ring bearer?” Steve asks, looking at his fiancé for confirmation. Tony is distracted in the kitchen. Sarah had decided cookies were needed for her tea party, and Tony, wanting to be the best daddy that ever lived, went ahead and gathered up the ingredients to make his daughter homemade cookies.
With his son distracted, it’s easy to sneak in an attack. Peter dodges it quickly, no doubt using his spider senses to aid him.
Steve was a clean and organized person; the military was responsible for that, and when it came to putting things away, Steve was on it. He was always working hard to keep the place clean, so it's a surprise when Tony walks in to find the living room littered with Peter’s items.
“A little,” Steve admits. He gets this way before every mission. Leaving his son behind is difficult, and for a moment he contemplates staying back and letting his team handle the job. “I hate leaving him.”
The rest of the appointment passes with ease. The baby’s development is on the right track and Tony’s healthy. Doctor Patterson congratulates them and leaves the room to retrieve the pictures she printed for them.
I'm on a roll with this story! I've had this story idea in my head for a while, so maybe that's it. Anyway, this chapter has some fluffy moments and then some angsty stuff because it's me and this story isn't going to be rainbows and butterflies...unfortunately.
“Buck, just listen,” Sam tries to calm his husband before Bucky storms off and punches a wall. “I know what you’re thinking, but this doesn’t concern us. Not anymore. This is about Peter.”
Ned bites down on his lip as he continues to guess. Then his eyes widened. “No!” He gasps in surprise. “When!”
Just thinking about him brings more tears to Peter’s eyes. He thought he was doing pretty good when it came to the death of his father. The pain of losing a loved one was always going to be there, but Peter promised he wouldn’t let it take control of his life. He was trying to move on and be happy, just like he knew his papa would want him to be.
He’s fine with the coffee; Steve makes it specially for him. He’s more than fine with the morning run Steve likes to take; that’s Steve’s time to unwind and clear his head. Tony would honestly prefer if he skipped the pills instead of the run.
The hard gaze Happy gives him is intimidating, but the omega doesn’t back down and cower. Eventually Happy’s eyes soften.
“How many times?” Tony asks and Steve peers up at him with glistening eyes. “It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it.”
He grows curious and peeks into the room, his ears picking up a few shared words. He catches himself eavesdropping and quickly ducks back into the hall.
Peter scrambles to make himself presentable and then, after taking a calming breath, he steps out of the stall and toward the row of sinks, purposely taking the one closest to the stall he just walked out of. The voices die down, but Peter knows better than to acknowledge the small groups of punks that tease him on a daily basis.
Tony doesn’t want to listen. He wanted nothing more than for Steve to still be alive. Maybe things would be different if he were. Maybe Tony would’ve came back sooner and made amends. He wonders if Steve would’ve accepted him back so easily.
Adoption seemed like the best route, but Peter still needed time to think. It was a big decision to make. Maybe a little too big. But he’s reminded of the help he does have, and that helps him worry a little less.
“How are you guys? Good?” Tony asks. When James nods, Tony smiles. “Good! You know what always helps when I can’t sleep?”
Peter frowns and cranes his neck to get a better look. “That?” he asks, pointing at the screen. Bruce nods. “But it’s so...tiny.”
I’m sorry that the chapter was a little on the short side. I just wanted some fluffy stuff now that the angst is over. I’ll have Tony meet the other pups and of course Jarvis, Happy, Bruce, and Pepper will come back. I thought I’d only have a two chapters left but it might be a little more.
“You have to say that.” Steve scoffs and tries to rip his hands free, but Tony won’t let him. Tony brings him even closer, letting one hand go so that he can place it on Steve’s waist. The mere contact shouldn’t affect Steve as much as it does. He sobs.
“I forget you’re not from this time period. It’s a tablet. A little computer,” Tony says when he catches the confused look on Steve’s face. “This is one of mine,” Tony turns the tablet around to show Steve the familiar last name engraved in the back.
“Yeah but isn’t it like your job to make all the choices? And even if I do suggest something you’ll probably do something else!”
“Why didn’t he try harder?” Peter asks, looking up at his uncle. “He-he always came home. Every single time he left he always came back. He promised. Why didn’t he try hard enough? Why did he give up?”
Tony paces around the room, gently rocking his son and lulling him to sleep. The beta that had been caring for his son has stepped out to give Tony space with his baby. She’s probably nearby just in case Peter needed assistance, but at this moment the pup was content in his father’s arms.
The elevator arrives at its destination and the doors open. Tony frowns when he realizes they’re still in the compound and not making their way to his car.
Tony peers up at his mate and winks, then he licks a stripe along Steve’s hole. Steve curses and throws his head back, his fingers tugging harshly at Tony’s hair.
As he got older, his interest in his birthday wasn’t the same. He didn’t have his mother to celebrate it with him anymore. He still had his best friend and then eventually he lost him too. After Hydra there was no point. They couldn’t care less about the day he was born and they sure as hell weren’t going to let him watch the fireworks. He’d be left alone in his room with only the memories from past birthdays on his mind.
Morgan packs quickly and zips the suitcase up, then she opens her door and peeks her head out. She can still hear the tv on but nothing else from her brothers. The muffled sounds of her parents come from their bedroom; they’re arguing again.
There doesn’t appear to be any visible injuries, but it’s obvious the man is shaken up. His shirt and pants are torn in a few places and covered in dried mud. He’s not wearing a coat; his body trembles from what Tony can only assume is from the chilly weather. Or maybe it’s fear. Maybe it’s both.
As soon as he’s back at his penthouse, he’s calling out for Steve and running up the stairs. The omega is curled up in his nest, fast asleep.
And then of course there was Flash...but Peter was hesitant to show him. Their last conversation was far from pleasant and didn’t go in the direction Peter was expecting. Well, to be honest, maybe it did. Flash had already proved time and time again that Peter was just someone he could call names and belittle. There’s no way in hell he would be there for the baby.
“Okay but if this other alpha is looking for him then moving out here isn’t enough. You need help, Tony.”
“Stop.” Tony warns and he points a threatening finger in Steve’s direction. “That baby is not mine. Look I don’t know who the hell you are, but if this is a way to get money out of me then you’re fucked. You have nothing on me. I didn’t mate with you and I sure as hell didn’t knock you up.”
The last thing he expected to see was a bright red sports car parked across from his school. Peter doesn’t even have to guess who’s behind the wheel.
“I wasn’t that much older. I was in college and happened to meet your dad at a party. Your Auntie Nat threw it and-”
Peter is snapped from his thoughts when something lands on the coffee table in front of him. He blinks for a second and stares at the item his dad had just thrown, his heart dropping down into the pit of his stomach.
“Get some rest.” Bruce smiles and places a hand over Tony’s shoulder. He squeezes it gently. “You both are going to need it.”
Happy glances at Peter and one brow raises. “I did a background check on you. What kind of security guard would I be if I didn’t? You’re not a psychotic stalker. I don’t think you’re capable of hurting anyone.”
Pierce inhales sharply and issues another kick to Tony’s side, this time a little harder, and Tony’s sure blue and purple bruises are beginning to decorate his skin. He grits his teeth, not wanting to give Pierce any satisfaction.
“Go back to sleep.” Tony adjusts the blanket around Steve’s form, then he’s leaning down to kiss his head. Steve hums and his eyes fall shut again.
“Why are we talking about this now? We just buried him and you’re already asking about the fucking shield!”
“He can. But he’s eventually going to need his own room. Look at this place.” Tony opens his arms wide. “I have more than enough room. He can have his own bedroom and a playroom. When he gets older maybe he’ll want a treehouse in the backyard.”
“Come on,” he tries again. “It’s freezing and we’re standing in the middle of an intersection with angry New Yorkers.”
There’s a heavy weight lifted off his shoulders now that Steve has broken the news about his pregnancy to the team. Natasha-though she already knew-appeared the most thrilled about the news. A bright smile had formed over her face when he announced it, and she didn’t hesitate to brag about being right about it either.
“What...what is this? Why did you give me handcuffs?” Steve takes them out of the box to inspect them closely. They shine magnificently in the light, almost glittering.
This alpha at least has the sense to fight his urge and let Steve go. The water shuts off and a towel is thrown at the omega.
Here is the part where Tony finds out. I tried to feel sorry for him but I just couldn't....not as bad as I feel for everyone else. I hope you all enjoy this and I will update this weekend!
Steve chuckles and waves the stick in his hand. “Now we know why. I was starting to get worried,” he says and he crosses the room to join Tony on the bed.
Tony rolls his eyes playfully. “Hilarious. Nah, I think I was alright. I was a kid so I wasn’t perfect like you.”
Tony steps back, no longer able to stand the sight. A sob builds in his throat and he doesn’t hold back this time. He cries long and hard, wishing that he could’ve done something to prevent this. He wonders what he did to deserve this kind of pain.
Bruce holds up a hand to silence his nephew. “We don’t know yet. Just don’t move from that spot okay? Let the grownups take care of this.”
“Yeah, well I have a kid now and he just loves keeping me up. Huh, Kiddo? You like keeping Daddy awake all night?” Tony coos, reaching out to tickle Peter’s sock covered foot. Peter squirms from the touch.
FRIDAY announces the arrival of the medics a few minutes later, and Steve and the baby are rushed to the nearest hospital. Tony never leaves their side.
Tony can’t bring himself to watch anymore. “J, please?,” he begs, fully aware of the tears running down his face. “Turn it off.”
The base of Tony’s cock tingles, a clear indication that his knot was close to popping. He chases after his own pleasure, pushing the forming knot in and out, moans escaping him from the intense feeling of having the omega’s walls squeeze around the sensitive knot.
Tony catches himself frowning again as another thought enters his mind. He wonders if Steve’s left their son in someone else’s care. Probably so. Steve would be prepared and smart like that.
His eyes squeeze shut when the muscles tighten underneath his fingertips. He bites back the groan that builds in his throat, not wanting to draw unwanted attention to himself. They wouldn’t check on him. Keeping him isolated was what he deserved.
His baby was gone. The life he and his husband created out of love was gone, stolen from them in an instant. It wasn’t fair.
There was no denying the fact that they clashed over anything and everything. They shared more arguments and fights than they did kisses and hugs. The physical attraction was there, but everything else that came with a relationship was hard to achieve.
“Okay. So I was talking with my uncles right, and they were kind of uncomfortable about it because I haven’t really talked to them after the whole thing with the party, but then-”
Tony nods and scratches behind Dodger’s ear. “Two more weeks and things are gonna be different around here.”
“You have to go,” Steve says and gently pats Peter’s thigh as he sits down on the bed. “And don’t you want to see Ned and Flash?”
At least Tony is trying. Still needs to try harder though. I'll include more scenes of him and Peter. They still have a lot to learn about each other.
He lies in bed, mind racing and playing back that horrible night. No matter how much he tries to think of the happy times, he’s left to relive the time his world changed forever.
Peter kneels down beside the grave to clear away some broken twigs and dried leaves. He takes one of the drawings, smiling at the image of his papa. It reminds him of all the drawings he’s created over the years.
Peter rushes back the way he came, hoping and praying that he wasn’t too late, or that he’d end up killed before he even made it back.
“I’m sorry. I tried to go but I just couldn’t-all I could think about was him and...I’m sorry. I’m sorry for lying and seeing my dad. I just felt so alone and I just wanted to know what he was like. He’s not a bad guy.”
All it takes is another kick to his side to have him back on the floor. He gets up again, this time on his knees and holds out a hand.
Peter rushes into the common room a few minutes later, his hair ruffled and skin shiny with sweat. Sam grimaces and makes a mental note to remind his nephew to shower after their conversation.
Morgan is in a fairly good mood when Tony gets her ready. She didn’t fuss when he gave her a warm bath, or when he dressed her in one of the cute outfits Natasha had given them.
“No, not really. Just something that’s been bothering me lately. I can’t remember anything about that night.”
Tony nods in agreement. Death did suck. It likes to lurk in the shadows, waiting for the right time to strike. Of course there was no such thing as the right time. Death will appear whether you’re ready for it or not. There’s barely any warning and if you’re lucky enough to get one, you beg and pray that you’re granted more time.
But now Steve was picking those pieces up and gluing himself back together. Tony had never seen Steve act the way he had when taking down the two alphas. It was both terrifying and exciting. Steve was finally gaining back the control that was stolen from him.
Steve heaves out a heavy sigh. He opens his mouth to add to the conversation, only to shut it when he hears the distinct sound of the front door opening and shutting. Tony must’ve heard it too because he’s ready to make a beeline for the exit, but Steve is faster and grips his arm tight.
Natasha chuckles softly. “I’d be okay with it but your parents would be upset. And I know your brothers would be too. You don’t think so but they would.”
Tony was glad they had slept. Peter was still struggling to get on a schedule and it was beginning to take a toll on the new parents, especially Steve. Tony could run on barely any sleep or none at all, but Steve required at least six hours if he wanted to function. Tony had no problem taking care of their son when Peter demanded attention at two in the morning.
He places a hand over his belly, wincing when the pain lasts longer than usual. The muscles under his fingertips harden like a rock. His brows draw together in confusion and he glances down at the small bump protruding from his middle. It never did go away. He thought the added weight would have disappeared by now. He ran almost every morning and didn’t indulge too much, but yet the weight remained. It was puzzling.
I swear I didn't forget about this story! I've just been busy with work and other parts of my life. And I've also had more inspiration for my other works lately. But I will find some balance! I hope everyone is doing well!
Tony isn’t in bed when Steve wakes. The omega furrows his brows in confusion when he wakes up to an empty bed and cold sheets. It was unusual to have the alpha absent. Ever since Tony created a bond between them, the alpha was always close by, ready to protect and comfort the omega. Steve enjoyed Tony’s gentle touch and security.
The A.I.’s promise of safety usually eased Steve's worried mind, but tonight was different. Something felt off. Something felt wrong.
“Tony,” Natasha says, continuing with their conversation now that Morgan is calm and drifting off to sleep. “I think it’s time you had someone else intervene. He needs someone to talk to, someone who’s not us or you. He needs help.”
