Anniversary of what, neither of them had to say. In response, Sherlock spoke in clipped, emotionless tones.
“More than believe. I
the texture of his own heartbeat, pounding away even as his arms and chest and legs glowed with bright blue tattoos, invisible to the human eye normally and yet now on display for John to see. They were whorling patterns, circles of overlapping and various size and shape, swirling into spirals that crept up his jutting collar-bones and sharp cheekbones, clinging like ivy across his lips and eyelids. He looked not unlike a painted dancer from some old textbook, and the marks made the creature appear slightly more wild and untamed even as he asked John again his question.
Back then both of them had gotten to see a lot of fire-trucks, mostly on the telly. They put out the fires that burned the cities and saved people, so John supposed they were important. At least important enough to go careening through traffic like they did, heedless of rules or regulations. He'd once seen one in real life, and it had actually caused an accident because someone hadn't gotten their car out of the way fast enough. It had been a scary, shrieking thing that seemed too big and too bright all at once. At the time he had cowered behind his Mother's leg.
John could smell him, his nose pressed against the detective's raven curls. Fresh mint and chemicals and the smoky hint of tobacco. He

Thin excuses for a whole person.
It was nearly an entire week later that Wilkes came to check on the new soldier’s progress with flight, saw that John had yet to shock Sherlock into submission, and instructed Bill and Mike to hold the soldier down so he could “do it himself”.
he was.... Not really..... I'm not even sure if
It was in the end Sherlock’s choice to move away, and he did so just as John felt as though he might lash out. The Selkie rose to his feet smoothly, all angles and grace, his bare backside on unselfconscious display. The creature’s scars were shiny and whip-like, curved over corded muscle and flesh. John’s eyes were drawn to them just as much as they were unwillingly drawn towards the bow of Sherlock’s strong calves or the slender arch of his neck. Standing strong in the dark, the Selkie’s eyes were ghost-like as he sang once more, bare feet already moving towards the ocean.
Except it wasn't by Sherlock shouting.

“Yeah he does. Doesn't even charge to the mess hall like the rest of us, just dives towards the showers and soaks for as long as he can. Not that I blame him.”
Apparently, eating breakfast with other Immortals meant that John was to be well-dressed and clean. This lead to him being brought to the bathing chambers, a wide pool of water that sat in a cavernous and shadowy alcove. Though it looked like it should have been ice cold as it poured from a waterfall overhead, the water steamed like a bath. John could see it, rising in warm waves overhead only to condense slickly on the overhanging ceiling. Molly had followed him up until the water’s edge faithfully, handing him a basket for his clothes. Her chirping voice echoed in the darkness, explaining to him even as he considered whether or not he had enough dignity left to deny stripping in front of her.
He told himself that he wasn't sad it vanished.
Oblivious to his inner turmoil, Dodge nodded thoughtfully. She sipped her tea before folding her hands in her lap. She wore her army uniform, John noticed. Must have just been off on training somewhere then. Her voice was terse.
John nodded enthusiastically, hair sticking up like duck-fluff from sleep even as he pulled up one of the stools around the table. Small hands reaching for the jug of orange juice, he took a deep breath and tasted the flavour of salt. He could barely sit still as he worked through his eggs, the cheesy centre creating messy strings about his lips as his grandmother laughed at his enthusiasm.
“Because we settled here, according to history, due to
“The murder of
to see you I guess.” He laughed, the sound awkward, and made to move away from Sherlock’s hip. The action was intolerable, and altogether mildly mortifying. “I’ll just, um. Go take care of things then come back for a cuddle, yeah? Let me just-”
A small, impossible kernel of hope lodged itself in John's throat like a stone, even as he heard the footfalls of his sister approaching. Her voice was breathless with having run long distance.
such a thing?”
The conversation continued on the same inane threads, something that Mycroft could navigate easily enough. It was what he’d been raised to do, essentially. There was a soothing sort of nature to being in his human form, working on diplomacy, guiding the course of diplomacy so that no one felt left out or offended. He was good at it, modestly speaking. He hardly needed to think when he nudged the princesses towards a sake at the end of one massive banquet table, or suggested to Kareem and Chun li the best people to make small-talk with given their interests and goals. They were nobility themselves, after all, and seemed pleased with finding out more about the Northern Tribe.
“Personality Disorders in general tend to only happen to people with acute intelligence as well as traumatic pasts, and though John is far smarter than most of the common drabble he is not exactly Einstein. So I'm assuming he doesn't have access to the full span of his I.Q. Which means there are other personalities- including yourself- that could have access.”
“No....but.... But
And they both stop, and Sherlock suddenly towering over John, trying to glean a confession from him even as the Doctor stubbornly clenches his jaw and look to the ground. Studying the outline of his shoes. In the dark his ash-blonde hair glints softly, and Sherlock wonders at the mystery of John Watson. How someone could seem so normal, and yet not get the gravity of such a situation. The magnitude of what he's done. Not just some small favour.
“It’s not PTSD.” John exhaled hard, once through his nose.
of meaning no harm. However his hands ticked in constant movement, and his eyes glittered with held-back comments and thought.
Separating him from his dreams that would be left behind like bits of seaweed clinging to a dry shore at low tide.
The Selkie towered over him like a malevolent god, those strange eyes shifting from blank with shock to calculating, the subtle furrowing of the creature’s brow the only indication that the Selkie was reeling with surprise. John struggled to rise, his limbs finally starting to mutiny after the rough treatment and the dip in the sea. His breath was pained and tight. Focused on his own well-being, the ex-army doctor nearly missed the inhalation of air, the breath of realisation quivering in the air.
He did not want to see, and yet he could not look away as John drew back,
There had to be a price for this kindness.
And from the platform a man clad in the dark brown robe of the clergy stepped onto the platform, and his voice carried out into the silent crowd and echoed like the roar of a lion.
The thought was probably a bit not good, but at that moment, Sherlock really couldn't find it in him to entirely care just yet. In his mind right now there was John, and then there were the Others. Black and white until proven otherwise. After all, Alters could be harmful to the host. He had seen studies where some cut their bodies and the Core personality had no idea why they were bleeding out on the bathroom floor.
That no matter what he would like, no matter how hard he believed, Faerie tales and myths did not exist.

In a flash, the orange-jacketed man was on the floor. None of the other homeless saw John move, but he was suddenly on top of the man, twisting his arm viciously. The homeless man let out a cry that
“There was… an
Wilkes was especially good at that. Making people feel alone.
The detective looked at John, trying to communicate something desperate and unspoken in his gaze. Throughout the man's monologue, John had been listening, finding the knot of anger welling in his stomach sour into something else. His throat felt dry as he hoarsely spoke, eyebrows lowering as he quietly stated “You must know... it'd be the same for me. If you had let them... if you had done what you were prepared to do... I wouldn't have been able to ever forgive you. Or myself.”
when I refused to drop my date wherever we were and come running as soon as you crooked your little texting finger!”
The last word cuts off in a strange way, and Sherlock glances down to find that it's because he's put his fingertips over John's mouth.
Sherlock blinks. Frowns in confusion. Opens his mouth.
Their hands untangle and John covers his forehead like he's checking himself for a fever, scrubs at his brow like wants to massage away an incipient headache.
The warm baths and soothing massages afterwards also help to make the physical therapy well worth the exertion.
Surely.
(See the end of the chapter for
John hadn't taken any of it gracefully, and their association had seemed at an end for some time. The businessman's stubbornness had eventually won out over pride, however, and the late nights arguing over takeaway and running up and down alleys avoiding both CCTV cameras and John's security detail had eventually resumed.
John  chuckled and stepped in again, repeating the side hug and shoulder peck  as requested, and this time stayed put to await results.

"Ta very much," John snorts wryly, then settles into a sort of softened down version of his earlier fierce focus. "So, how do you feel?"
“Bees are fine.“
“If you’d get out of the way, I’d be happy to,” Sherlock said from behind him.
In all other aspects, it is very much a proper kiss. Those capable hands are still cradling Sherlock's head gently, thumbs slowly rubbing back and forth along sometimes-scoffed-at cheekbones. John's eyes are closed and he's tipped his head slightly to the left to avoid mashing their noses together. His lips purse softly against Sherlock's fingers, go slack and retreat, then press forward once more. And (oh) now John's mouth is open, just a milimeter or two, enough to leave a sliver of damp against Sherlock's middle finger.
Sherlock drew breath to categorically deny this accusation, but deflated in a great, gusty sigh at John's next murmur.

"Or at least...the hope that you'll eventually find it."
"Sherlock, do NOT hand me your dand-- oh.
Sherlock smooths one thumb over the whorls and slashes of John's writing and then, because he is a genius, has a brilliant idea.
Sherlock leaps through the door in a good mood and lands on his feet in absolute disgust.
John  did the blinky thing that was generally Sherlock’s schtick and then  attempted to clarify, locking eyes on his flatmate’s face with hopeful  anticipation.
"...and now I'm thinking I've offended you terribly," he tentatively adds, despite the evidence - John's hand softly come up to cradle his face - to the contrary.
It really didn’t take much effort.
I am so sorry for shouting at you, and accusing you of not caring. You care so much. Almost too much. I am honored, and unworthy, of being one of the people you care for so wholeheartedly.

"No, no, not like that! It's not any kind of, of
He glances back up at me then leans in by my ear.
"But I-"
Johns voice was a low rumble, one that made Sherlock quake.
Our eyes meet, and it’s like for the first time. I feel the same rush of feelings, the same rush of adrenaline, my stomach performs the same flips, my heart does the same erratic beats.
It’s not that I don’t want this, it’s just that it will be weird and uncomfortable to have johns fingers inside of me.
“I don’t think I’ll be able to stand...” Sherlock mused as he crawled up behind John, wrapping his arms around the blond’s neck and nipping at his ear lobe.
“That’s all of it now. Shit.” John mumbled as he squirted the last of the lube on to his fingers and cock. Sherlock was trembling on all fours, his limbs shaking, his eyes clenched shut.
“Don’t be dead.”
Before Sherlock had a chance to stop him, John had run out the door.
“Hun, Yeah that’s a cocktail stick.”
“Alright, Alright. I’m going.”
John smiled in to the kiss, and blindly steered them towards the bedroom.
The six inebriated teens all laughed, those in heels in danger of falling over. They made their way over to a table, and collapsed down in the seats. They realised that they were only five by this point, having lost Irene in the sea of people.
“Good?”
“I don’t.”
He nods, and agrees to meet me in the break room.
“Doctors say I’ll be lucky to walk again.”
“How long have you been outside?” Sherlock asked cautiously.
“I like your thinking. Ok then, genius, why don’t you astound me with how you want to carry out this plan?” He murmurs, his teeth gently nipping at my earlobe.
He chuckled, and wrapped his arms around the younger boy.
“Agh! Agh! Oh fucking- gaaah!”
“I... I can... I can always see in to peoples’ heads... but hearts... that’s much more private, and I’ve never bothered... it umm... confuses me... but you... I can see in to yours.”
“You’re making me anxious just watching you.”
“Joh- Agh!”

SHERLOCK’S POV
Sherlock obeyed quickly, kneeling down in front of John, horizontal to the pillows.
Just a short filler chapter. If I’m feeling generous, I’ll post a second chapter. ;)
I can just about make out his ‘rabbit in the headlights’ expression through his dark curls as he hangs his head.
“Fancy an ice cream?” John asked when they got off the train.
John’s voice was a deep rumble that Sherlock could feel vibrating from his chest, raising his cock to full mast.
“Come here.”
I look back up again. There’s no point hiding it from him anymore.
“I like him. Such a nice chap.”
Sherlock looked eyes with John, blue orbs wide. John darted his tongue out to lick his lips, then grinned.
“I’ll be expecting my something pretty when we get home.” John whispered in Sherlock’s ear.
“Yes”. All three girls replied.
“I’m amazed one of them didn’t get moved. The amount of times moriarty has sent Sherlock down to medical...” moly repeats.
Sherlock wobbled in her heeled boots as she tried to stay up.
“I don’t know. What’s this one called?”
“Paper.” She said, looking at her mother over her teacup.
Irene took the stick away from him, and tossed it in to a bin as they stumbled along the pavement.
Sherlock sighed in exasperation, but couldn’t help the smile that tugged at his lips.
Their warm and soft, and taste ever so slightly of strawberry, the jelly from tonight’s dessert I assume.
“Ah, Mrs Watson. How lovely to make your acquaintance.” Mycroft said, the corners of her mouth tugging into her signature, smug grin.
The brunette kept his head down.
**********
She smiled at both daughters, then went back inside.
“Yes.”
Anne and Kate were off to a charity ball with Mr Holmes and Mr Watson respectively, and all four children had been left with Mrs Hudson. Mycroft actually tolerated Harriet, because she had some interesting views on politics which the brunette was more than happy to discuss. John as it turns out was jolly good at chess, and gave Sherlock a run for her money, even though each game ended with a stalemate.
“I know.” He says softly as he buries his head in to my neck.
The curly haired girl had no answer for that. Instead, she threw a custard cream at mycroft’s head, and went to find their mother.
“Oh shit.”
He does as he’s told, quite the phenomenon when it comes to Sherlock.
“Oh... oh... ah! Oh gah- mmm!” He howled from the other room.
For someone with, from what I’ve gathered, no experience, he’s not too bad in the kissing department.
“Thanks.”
“Yes. Let’s hope.”
“What...?”
“Well they are.” Sherlock smirked over his tea cup.
Mike Stamford, my bunkmate, possibly the only person here whom I don’t hate. He’s regarding me with what appears to be concern as he gets up from his bed.
*******************
“John, are you alright on an air mattress?”
“Give him to my mother.”
“I want all of you tonight.”
The lunch bell rang, and Sherlock trailed off to his next class. He sat through English, pretending to be listening, and ended up writing pi to 400 places from his elbow to his thumb. On his way to chemistry, he heard someone call him. He turned around to see Mike, and another boy. Said boy was a few inches shorter than mike, with ashy blonde hair, and navy eyes. Sherlock scanned him from his shoes up to his hair, and from his left hand to his right.
but his words flowed from his mouth in a spill of verbal diarrhoea even as he turned off the kettle that started to
It was a little weird, John conceded, that Iolite spoke in plurals. Still he felt the inevitable question hover on his lips, looking to the Gem and ignoring the gaping hole of Not-Sherlock she was taking up.
Mrs. Hudson, having wanted to check in on her “kind soldier” was instead left to face a sight that would make most men cower in sheer terror.
“Good. You can keep it.” Irene felt a ball at the back of her throat. She wanted to say that she didn’t want it, didn’t want to pretend that this could very well be the last time they’d see one another. She wanted to throw the music box in Kate’s face, tell her that if it was a going away present, then she could shove it.
someone, the faith that came in the steady rhythm of your own hands working to fix things. Some nights it was the only thing that kept John from going absolutely insane as he heard the fighting going on downstairs, or watched his Father drink himself into oblivion.
I hope you enjoy! :D
Mycroft hopped on a train still believing that his sister only needed time to work herself out, that she would eventually straighten things herself. After all, she seemed to have no desire for his aid since that morning at the beginning of the holidays. Rather, Shyla seemed stubbornly determined to survive without the help of either her sibling or her parents at all.
“You’ll want breakfast I expect, I can have something be prepared for you at any time you wish m’Lord. Your quarters- Sherlock’s tower- is the west half of the palace, but the east half holds a garden and some outdoor land. You have full access to both, but the North half of the castle is forbidden. No one but our Master goes there.”
And it was at that thought that something in John screamed at him insistently. Something tugged at the centre of his chest, demanding to be noticed. A voice that cried to him that the eyes which were now only inches from his face were
” Mycroft spoke, and his voice was an east wind rolling from a mountain. “I wish to show. This, is my specialty, an ability I alone have made. I call it a Memory Well. It contains my experiences, what I’ve lost. It will tell you why you’re here. If you trust me, John, touch the light. Sherlock won’t see what you see, not with my Magic.”
Sherlock tried the word out, letting it roll over his tongue. The sensation of heat from the stone was brief, but the temperature that rose off of John’s skin beneath his lumpy-looking human clothes suggested the same fleeting sensation of comfort. The Selkie, trying to fully understand the meaning behind the term pressed one hand to John’s sternum, invading the last of his personal space with one obscenely spindly hand.
Her voice was melodious, playful and amused, and her tail, John realised, fanned out to curl around him, gently making waves. His eyes were drawn to her scales without his express consent, dazzling like river stones shimmering under moonlight.
He fussed with the idea, rolling it over and over again in his mind like a loose tooth, niggling at it until his fear of the wolf and the darkness bled away.
She leaned forward, white hair glinting in the kitchen lights like soft silver.
her birth that her brother enjoyed to watch things bleed.
“That was amazing.”
He stated the fact plainly, but something in Mycroft’s expression was shadowed. John could feel a twisting sensation in the pit of his stomach. Sherlock was many things, but he was far from a
And most of all, he tried to forget the children, chained and wandering in the snow, and the childlike voice that had muttered behind him in that line, whispering words Sherlock didn't know the meaning of.
“We upset everyone.”

Sherlock reached out to grip the man's sleep-shirt, elegant fingers feeling far less strong than they should, given
He needed a distraction.
The Selkie bared their teeth, and a halo of red hair made their eyes glint like icy fire as they parted their lips, emitting a hiss that made the hair on the back of John’s neck stand on end. The razor-points of its teeth flashed sharp and menacing, shark-like. Head burning with a craving for air, John landed a kick to the creature’s sternum, striking out as hard as he could. He found himself curiously without fear despite the desperation of the situation. Instead, rage was bubbling through his veins, liquid lava that burned and warmed him despite the water’s ice. He was not going to drown – Watsons didn’t drown! The sea was part of them, he would not be changing that fact just because he was losing his mind and beginning to believe in Selkies!
“Tea.”
John started, wordlessly surprised that the young woman before him even considered the Dragon in her greetings. It was uncommon for anyone to regard slaves, let alone address them directly, and a part of him wondered if perhaps the close bond that Rania so obviously shared with her own Dragon influenced her. He chanced a darting look through his lashes, regarding the creature coiled about her neck quietly.
, John Watson. Do tell me, do you plan on just letting him? Of giving up your life here, the people you’ve grown with?”
But that wasn't what made John flinch. No. What made the very hair stand up on the back of his neck was the high, keening wail that shook the compound, an alarm shrieking out moments before Andy tensed visibly. His ordered bark of “Air-raid!
Beta is still in need of a break because of school work (plus she's editing a crap-tonne of other things at the moment) so please don't hesitate to point anything major out to me! ^_^ I will also be shifting the tags slightly, as I feel like I should probably add some tags to come...
Still, he had to hustle if he wanted to be prepared before the Dragon woke up. Apparently, the creatures tended to be primarily nocturnal, but because his had fallen asleep because it was ill it would most likely wake irritable.
Xavi chuckled “I can relate. Having an infant around doesn’t improve matters much.”
that had upset John, but then the little boy abruptly turned to paddle towards shore, dripping water onto the dry sand as he sat down on the sand and began to sob.
“I wonder if London missed me?”
Fortunately, Anthea was always one to break the ice that Mycroft tended to cultivate about himself. She stepped forward, delivering a crisp report.
Sherlock, apparently uncaring or unaware of his own ethereal nature, lead John unerringly towards the water. John watched how the waves seem to jump in excitement with the Selkie’s approach, swelling and reaching outwards as if to brush Sherlock’s bare toes. John watched as a small coil of tension that had gone unnoticed previously loosened itself from the Selkie’s shoulders with its greeting, a rumbling noise leaving Sherlock’s mouth that was a mix of filthiest praise and contentment. John watched further up the shore in a mixture of amusement and embarrassment as Sherlock dove like a fish, submerging himself into the water only to sinuously reappear a moment later. Jewels of water turned silver in his curls, slicked back and shimmering as he twisted to look at John, cheeks flushed happily and a hum resonating through the water that made the soldier’s toes curl. Expecting a long night and content to watch, John saw himself down on the shore, stretching out his bad leg with a mild grimace before settling in to look at the stars.
It was not the first time this complaint had been raised, and Sherlock sympathised. He exhaled from his chest silently, considering. The silence that stretched between them was companionable, but it was heavy with words left unsaid. Neither of them wanted to touch it, lest it burst at the seams. Yet there was a heaviness to it, filled with possibility. Sherlock was acutely aware of his wings, shifting colours with his thoughts. They were the softest grey, nearly a pink that could only be seen at the edge of a sunset.
Sebastian breathed a smoke ring in the air, embers of his light flicking out into the darkness, only to die as they fell. His dark eyes pondered the question for a moment, mulling it over before he stated decisively “Now. My room, tonight. Dorm mate's gone and I've paid off the prefects. We can have some fun and take our time.”
His Welsh accent brings little doubt by way of answer as the man gruffly replies.
He bit into it to allow the shards of ice to melt more quickly so it would cool him faster. It was like a dying man in the desert finally finding an oasis to drink from, and the Dragon's eyes fluttered closed in ecstasy before they snapped open again to see the other ice-cube sitting for him just a little farther away. His pupils widened in cat-like interest.
Finally, Sneak sighed.
Until then, just shut up.”
, a sad river of hot water and tea leaves spreading around the scene of the crime like blood. John's chair
John’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he took in the words, steadying himself. Right then. Children of water. It would explain the storm outside, still raging on as if it intended to throw John to the depths of a watery grave.
John’s head was swimming, and it wasn’t just because he found as of late that he was occupying more than just his own thoughts. Though Sherlock’s presence in his mind was distracting, he was finding that in time the noise was getting easier to control. Like a radio channel, when he concentrated he could usually tune himself in and out, and it made the headache he’d been suffering from for some while now ease.
to shed around John.
Yet even with her mental indignation she halted a breath away from the back of the cough, hesitantly rising to John's full height to stare down at the new person who had entered the life of John Watson. What Claude saw she did not expect for someone so lithely built.
Sneak ran his tongue over the front of his teeth, his gaze faraway in almost child-like consideration. His voice was low as he mused to himself “Never quite got that, honestly. Aren't parents supposed to accept their kids? Even if they don't like aspects of them?”
He told himself that was why he forced himself to stare at his injuries, access them even as it made his heart sink. There was no use shying away from his analysis, even as it grew grimmer the longer he looked. Nerve damage, was the initial assessment. Likely, there would also be a serious amount of physio to look forward to. The thought entered his brain that he’d likely never be able to shoot to the same level of steadiness. He bit back the hot, metallic flavour that rose up in the back of his throat. John breathed deliberately through his nose, staring back up at the ceiling.
Day 8—Tuesday, 9:01 a.m.
I laughed. He was clearly intent on being stubborn, and it was most certainly not the first time we had had quite different views on this particular subject. “Does there have to be a reason other than I wished to try something new?” I reasoned.
“I don’t know,” Mycroft admitted hesitantly.
Yes, I believe that you should stay away; to return would just allow me the opportunity to hurt you again. You will please let Mrs. Hudson know where to send on your things. I wish you well.
Oddly, there is one unlike the others; one who seems to have compassion for Sherlock. Instead of resignation or ire, his face reflects concern, and sorrow, and a calm that I greatly appreciate. His approach is quite different, as well. He asks after our well-being every day as if a friendly acquaintance rather than a keeper. He takes time to listen to my descriptions of my friend’s behaviour since he saw him last. He listens to Sherlock, even when he is spouting nonsense. As I do, he occasionally lays a calming hand on his arm or his back. When Sherlock is being particularly trying, he always attempts speaking to him first; before any physical restraint. It impresses me to no end, so a few days ago, I asked him, as politely as I could manage, why he differed so from the others.
“Is he back or is he dead?”
“I don’t wish to speak about it any longer. If you don’t need me anymore—you should be able to identify the estate agent who’s been doing those valuations fairly easily with everything I’ve given you—I…” He paused. “There are places I can stay…” He scowled. “There are some people I need to contact.”
“I did write you a letter,” he explained in a small voice.
I believe that the answer simply is that they are Sherlock’s words—and as he always did, from that very first meeting—they compliment me and confound me and insult me and embrace me; they envelop me as he did. From the very beginning I was his to do with as he wished—
“Except for my brother,” he interrupted.

“That seems to satisfy the job requirements at the moment,” she admitted drily. “The schedule for his medications is on the clipboard in his room. The next nurse is due in four hours.”
Your dear wife confided in me, more than once, about your lack of attendance in your own home—about your club. She told me of your indifference to the lovely home she established— Your cruel and callous remarks and actions which at times prevented her from bringing into that home the latest and most desirable of improvements— Your dismissal of her concerns regarding the tradesmen and servants.
He handed him one of the books he had found; the man who was there earlier—Solomon—had come with him in search of the library and helped him bring several books upstairs. He had even stacked them the way he preferred—on the floor next to the sofa.
“What?!”
He refused to go to a tailor; all that measuring was just a bit creepy. No, he convinced his always-elegant mate that off-the-rack would be fine for him, and they had had a bit of fun deciding what would look best. They hadn’t bothered looking at the prices.
Solomon burst out, “I know what he’s talking about! From the… Watson’s blog. Right at the very beginning—he sent a text to the doctor. How did it go? Uh… ‘Come if inconvenient. Could be dangerous.’ Something like that.”
“It is because—we are intimate, my love, and your activities sometimes bring to mind our private times together.”

to go,” I groaned.
I was at a loss. Back then, the great developers of our modern perspective and understanding of psychiatry were just beginning their outstanding work on recognising insanity in all its forms as a disease of the mind, just as others were discovering the true nature of the diseases of the body. I admit that that early in my career I did not view my friend’s behaviour as an illness in the way cholera or tuberculosis was, but then neither did the vast majority of those in the medical field. There was an exceptional group of men who thought otherwise, but their beliefs were not as well-known back then—I am making a great number of excuses for my ignorance.
“And?” The doctor couldn’t help grinning.
I told her how concerned I am that Sherlock might injure himself during his fits. I explained how disheartening it is to watch him as he paces and shakes the handles of the locked doors and pounds his fists against the windows. I shared my despair at his lack of sleep and lack of appetite and the torrent of words that issue from him day and night. And finally I admitted to her how hurtful some of those words are.
As I am writing this in retrospect, I understand now that that was the moment when I realised that the elder man was addressing his brother, seven years his minor but certainly an adult, much as a father would address a very small, misbehaving child—because that was, to be honest, what he was doing. I can reflect now on how very odd and very sad for the government man—to have to become not just a father but a stern one to his own brother.
So where did that leave him?
I do not wish to recall that particular event in my medical career—even if the result had been positive. I had amputated men’s limbs when I was in Afghanistan. I had seen horrors and brutalities there that I have, to this day, been unable to put into words. I have seen the disgusting decay of flesh and bone brought on by syphilis and by “phossy jaw.” I have nursed my own sweetheart through several illnesses that had him, quite literally, at Death’s door.
“What... whatever do you mean?” the shrewish woman stammered, blinking rapidly.
The long, white fingers made quick work of the paper, and then the bored expression changed. “Oh!” he exclaimed, looking interested despite himself. “That’s rather… neat.”
Of course, I am the idiot who followed his instructions and went to the country and ended up crouching in some gorse on a damp heath, waiting for our client to arrive.
“What—no ‘Big Brother’?” he sniped.
“Just a little something I’ve been wanting to try. You game?”
“Do you know how many times a day Mrs Hudson responds to the bell? Deliveries, post, your clients—”
“Oh?” Why was he not surprised? “Let me guess.”
The nurse who came for the evening shift was full-figured, with lovely coffee-coloured skin and dark brown hair in meticulous rows of braids. Her brown eyes sparkled as she strode confidently into the bedroom.

“Yes, sir,” the footballer replied contritely. He apparently felt like an idiot, letting the scrape on his leg go for so long. He flinched as Dr Watson doused some gauze with antiseptic and carefully began to clean the wound.

Sherlock, who had just speared a Brussel sprout, froze, his fork halfway to his lips. As one might do when not desiring to frighten a wild animal, he remained still, his eyes wide.
I regret to this day that my reflexes were not the slightest bit faster, for although I realised what was coming, I could not reach them quickly enough to prevent it.
And then the most horrific of all—Sherlock attacked his brother. It was so unexpected that neither of us were able to prepare ourselves. He lunged forward, knocking the older man to the floor, his hands around his throat. I of course immediately leapt forward and attempted to separate them whilst shouting for assistance from the men I knew were posted in the corridor.
Waiting for John to awake, Sherlock marvelled at how fragile Human beings seemed to be. Although even he had been struck by the magic's power , his new Mate appeared to be out stone cold. The pup might have been worried, if it weren't for the steady rise and fall of John's chest. Although Sherlock had little doubt that his kind were stronger physically, it still amazed him. His fingers tentatively reached out to stroke the side of John's cheek in curiosity, marvelling at its chubby-like softness. Already, Sherlock was losing his baby-fat, becoming leaner and more angular. John, however seemed to still have a ways to go before any muscle would be likely to form. Still, that did not bother the pup. He had no doubt that John would make a good Mate. Once he became like Sherlock, of course, and joined him in the waves. The thought sent a flutter of contentment through him.
“Who, Blue?
Yet John stayed rooted to the spot, feeling a clawing horror crawling along his spine. For where there had once stood a weapons barack, proud and tall, now stood a smoking shell of a building. Thick, acrid smoke rose from it in the distance, far enough away that the pair had not been grievously injured. Closely enough however, that John could see the bodies, strewn along the sand like dolls tossed in every direction. Dragons, Humans, lying side by side, still as death.

And yet in order to forget, he knows a part of him needs to remember.
Making sure he was still facing the creature, the soldier walked backwards until he entered the kitchen, searching for the jade-green tome sitting peacefully on the marble counter. Scooping it into his hands, he was just about to leaf through it quickly to the chapter that was nagging at him when a sharp sound pierced the air. The cry of a telephone ringing throughout the flat was answered by a shrieking roar from Sherlock, and John dove for the phone in the corner of the kitchen before the Dragon could work himself into more of a frenzy than he already had. Ears still ringing from the echoing vibrations of the creature's howl, the soldier winced as he cradled the receiver by his ear.
John's arm in
“As punishment for his crimes, his Mate and children were executed, excused as war crimes by another platoon. By the time we arrived, it was too late, and the Dragon had been driven mad by the death of his loved ones. He was completely feral, had nearly torn apart an entire compound on his own from sheer, brute grief and outrage.”
About what, John would never know.
Those clear eyes sharpened minutely.
The little boy shifted, wringing his hands before carrying on at a slightly less animated pace than he had before. He had sensed the change in the atmosphere, however brief it had occurred.
The young man cut off, biting his lip. He looked at John, eyes wide and pleading. John could see the betrayal in that gaze, the shock that anyone could

It had been nearly a year before Victor had discovered his habit. It had been the skipping meals he'd figured out first, though not exactly due to anything life-threatening. Rather, what had given Sherlock away was of all things his brother, or how the young man acted around him.
John did not stir.
“You make sex sound
Can't even try.
“The last time I saw you two bond, it was for that copycat killer.” He scratched his grey hair in memory, brown eyes seeming to smile as he joked "You're always both easier and harder to work with than Sherlock. At least
And with those words Sherlock's eyes flick to the file again, hands twitching just slightly as he considered the information laid out before him. On the one hand, he was almost desperately curious about why his brother was so interested in John. After all, even though he was his flatmte Mycroft rarely showed so much distress over Sherlock's choices. Instead he often chose to Mother-Hen from afar, John being the first person Sherlock had ever seen actively become warned about.
Edit~ Also, more fantastic fanart done
They were officially in enemy territory.
He felt his back come into contact with the sand, and then the Dragon was upon him, teeth bared, going in for his jugular. For a moment, John felt as though the only thing he was aware of was his own heart, thudding dully in his ears. He felt those sharp canines, already bared brace against his skin, threatening to puncture like his throat was made of nothing but butter.
Like he wished he could make Sherlock understand why it bothered him.

The ex-army doctor found his irritated amusement fading into true worry as Sherlock looked at him, for a moment more animal than man. Sherlock did not often looked this... rattled. It was an expression that normally only came in times of great danger, desperation or need.
His elder brother snorted, as if having to 'convince' someone to push Sherlock out of their lives wasn't exactly difficult to do. Then he reclined back into his chair defensively, cooling his gaze as he let it drop in feigned disinterest to the knuckles of his hand. His voice was low.

However Sherlock stopped as a warm, cooking scent wafted past, causing him to pause in disbelief. It smelled like… well it smelled like
John finishes, folding his hands in his lap. Already stumped. It's funny, how quickly the Doctor gives up. Sherlock has to suppress a small smile as he fills in the gaps, shifting so he can get a better look outside his window. Not too far now.
Sherlock watched as those pale eyelashes fluttered, unconsciousness swiftly returning to John once more. He longed to reach out, to touch those fingers that twitched in distress. The detective instead made do by opening Henry’s file, hungrily absorbing all the knowledge he could about the assimilation of personalities, and how it would affect John’s future.
Claude's eyes widened when she took in how hastily the detective spun, picking up the skull from its innocuous place by the mantel and flinging it without hesitation towards the floor. The hollow sound of its thud reverberated through the floorboards and caused the little girl to shudder. Mr Holmes was scary when he was mad.
Sherlock had been quite proud of himself for scaring away the intruder, until John had scolded it for him later.
By the time blackness claimed John like a capsizing wave, the singing voice had transformed into that of his grandmother’s. The memory of her sweeping voice, rich and unrestrained called to him as if through time.
John Watson smiled on default, but upon meeting her eyes, a spark of vague recognition passed his features. His smile faded away slowly, and his hands came to fold themselves in his lap. His voice was light, awkward.

the flat, the cold loneliness that had lingered in it before. It was strange, but ever since Sherlock had entered his life, John hadn't been bored. Suddenly, life had a purpose and an interest, and its name was Sherlock the Dragon. He no longer felt an oppressive need for routine, no longer felt as if the days dragged on. The idea of someone coming and taking the Dragon away, just when John felt Sherlock was beginning to trust him was painful. He could picture the betrayed look on the creature's face, picture how wide those blue-green eyes would get before narrowing into slits of hatred. It couldn't happen, John wouldn't let it. He glared at Mike, willing him to see that he wasn't going to budge until his friend agreed.
Mary wouldn't look
The silence on the death of Barnes remained between the two of them, unspoken. By way of answer, the Dragon merely pulled on the Human's sleeve. Leading him towards their tent firmly. His tone however trembled as much as John did as they moved, not quite an apology, not quite an insult.
This time, John expected the strike that came to him, causing him to grunt and grit his teeth. His knees were sticky with tar and oil, seeping through his jeans. Sherlock's deductions and insults cut off abruptly, and a moment later Henry grunted then moaned in pain as Sherlock twisted his arm savagely. The detective was ice as he murmured “I'd do well not to hit my flatmate again, Albert. A bullet is quick, but once you fire, I'll make sure that the last thing I do is break your brother's neck.”
John was
Truthfully, John had no idea what Gems did in terms of relationships. The only Gem he could hope to ask would read far too much into his question, and the ex-army doctor wasn’t yet prepared for a conversation on the Birds and the Bees with his flatmate.
She and Mike did not speak of it, but she knew he felt it too, sometimes. The first month was turning out to be a hard one, and neither of them quite knew what to do. For Mike, there was counselling, and there were treatment centres. Yet Dragons did not have much by the way of mental health professionals, and the ones that were available were not affordable on army pensions.
The thought sent an uneasy coil tightening through the Dragon's gut, twisting and menacing.
“Jesus, Sherlock I'm so,
It was this that compelled Mycroft to swim towards the shoreland, sleek seal body cutting through the waves like they were nothing more than a minor inconvenience. The ocean was dark that night, roiling with the knowledge that one of its children was missing, so close to sunrise. The elder Holmes travelled for most of the evening, coming to the cove where his brother had last contacted him by the first tendrils of dawning. The ocean by that point had erupted with the sunrise, blue water glittering gold and teal blue like the end of a peacock’s tail. Rising to the surface, Mycroft’s seal form was a dark buoy floating with the waves, rapidly approaching shore.
“Reckon we could catch one?” Mike mumbled absently, to which John laughed and shook his head.
The priest, holding up his hands in a mimicry of the painted portrait behind him, silenced the crowd's thunderous reply with a smile of triumphant glory. His voice held in it warmth and camaraderie. It grew when a few hoots from the audience signalled the clergyman's old friends were dispersed amongst the crowd. His voice was remarkably steady even as he addressed the entire village alone.
Some nice ice.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
His mind was still on Sally, and on his family back home. Both pieces of the puzzle that was his life swam before him, the largest piece appearing as they rounded a corner and John found himself faced with two heavy, open doors. The brassiness of the knockers reflected the colour of blue fire, goblets burning in a macabre sort of atmosphere that made John balk despite himself.
“I see him perfectly fine, Doctor Watson.” And the man’s voice was crackling suddenly, cold and merciless. The oppressive weight grew heavier, pressing onto John’s shoulders as the hidden wrath of the British  Government revealed itself for a moment, terrifying and unmerciful. Mycroft’s voice did not rise, but it turned as icy and frigid as a lake in winter. “I will admit to have making mistakes in the past, unintentionally aggravating situations in which I would have been better suited towards keeping my hand out of. But do not,for one second, accuse me of not knowing my little brother.”
Something flickered in those dark orbs, and Sally’s face dipped lower into the water even as she glanced at the large, starburst pattern on John’s shoulder. There was something understanding in that look. She drew away, long tail swishing in the water as mysteriously she murmured “Yes, well… To fear water in this place is to fear Sherlock, and I for one do not blame the man who fears the sea, as well as those who live within it. He is, after all, a monster more frightening even than Nymphs.”
on his feet before he realised that his
They stood in a silent face-off in front of the troops then, glaring hotly at one another with ill-concealed malice that John hadn't seen the likes of quite before. True Wilkes was obviously an arse (and a cruel one at that) but it was strange to see Bill's features twisted into such an expression of
It felt.... Wrong, to just do something without John's consent.
There was a padding of bare feet, and hesitantly Sherlock approached behind him. Taller by a good head, the Selkie was able to peer over and around John’s shoulder, gaze calculating.
“One chai tea, please.”
His voice was disapproving, hinting just on the other side of jealous. John felt his mouth drop open in surprise. However he didn't have time to reflect on it, as he suddenly found his attention drawn by what Morstan was saying.
“The boy is
To John’s surprise, it was Sherlock who knelt in the sand, answering for him. The Northern Dragon’s pale blue eyes looked into the stranger’s with an approximation of kindness, the kind that John had yet to see on his companion’s face.

The Detective is surprised as very abruptly the entire manner of John's body changed. Daniel's entire expression slackened into a wide-eyed innocence, and his tightly coiled muscles loosened as John very suddenly relaxed into a cross-legged sitting position, a high, childlike voice passing his lips in utter excitement. It rings out in timid adoration.
The Alter did not seem particularly convinced by that. Rather, their voice was low and
As an official army medic, John was armed but not expected to engage in much battle. His job was mainly to pull victims of attack to safety, though it chafed him to see others in the crowd fighting and he unable to do so.

Hajera’s head lifted, desperately searching the darkening horizon for a small glimmer of hope. Pressed to the rapidly-growing stain of the makeshift bandage, her hands clutched the small umbrella charm. It too, was becoming soaked with red. She wondered if it would damage the tracking. She wondered if when John fell, he damaged it. She wondered and wondered until all she could hear was the keening sound of John’s breath, an animal filled with fear and confusion. Hajera could taste her own terror, and she spared a thought for her queen and for the country that she loved, despite all of its flaws. She felt her resolve hardening. The trembling in her hands stilled.
a man in a frayed orange jacket. His rasping voice carried to Claude's inquisitive ears.
Sherlock stood staring at his own reflection upon the water's surface, unblinking eyes regarding himself coolly, mirrors twin in length and scorn gazing at one another. The fountain was the only thing that dispelled the illusion of his double, cold water trickling from the stone statue's cupped hands and sending rippling pools across high cheekbones and darkly curling hair. Sherlock did not look up at the sculpture seeming to kneel above him with a guarded protectiveness, did not look at the marble woman's eyes, nor at how they wept water into outstretched palms that seemed to be reaching imploringly, begging. Instead he kept his gaze trained in the wider basin, his voice a soft breath as he murmured
“You have questions as well I suppose?”
Yet Sherlock would not let him look away, even when John tried to do so. His hand turned firm in its grip, holding his chin there as slowly, the detective exhaled in a sigh. The sweetness of his breath tickled John's cheeks, and that's when he realised how close he was
John learned to hate
“You’ve been getting headaches.”
Five months in, John was up in his room typing.
They rode in silence, the two Crates just small enough to fit in the large boot of the car and allowing the people who sat in the back seat access to the two Caged and quite frankly, irritable dragons. Mike whispered soothing words to his obviously stressed Dragon occasionally, her mouth spitting a blackish sort of smoke as she slowly tried to re-light the flame in her gut after being drowned at the Kennels. It would be a few hours still though before she would succeed.
Sherlock’s discharge from hospital was a celebratory affair on all sides. John had refused to leave his side upon waking and being explained the situation, and so the two hadn’t been free of hospitals and nurses and check-ups for several weeks now. They both chafed to be back at
John shifted unconsciously in his sleep as the first pattering drum-roll began outside. His mind did not recognise the sound, and so it made sense that he’d shift, sleepily opening his eyes and blearily watching as the window that he faced became blurred, streaked with water. He couldn’t make sense of the image, tired as he was. Yet somehow, he could make sense of the shadowy figure that stood silhouetted in the evening clouds, silently commanding the monsoon that occurred outside. Sherlock’s head was tilted upwards, and his lips were slightly parted in the dark, as if he were caught in the midst of deepest pleasure. His hands spread out beside him, and with the strike of lightning outside he appeared positively luminescent, a ghost.
He had chosen to
Walking over, John brushed a hand absently over the detective’s curls, a smile twitching on his lips at the way Sherlock instinctively leaned into the motion like a pleasured cat. John headed towards his room, his parting words somehow an olive branch to the detective’s waspish mood.
The ex-army doctor came down the stairs yawning, stretching his arms one by one by pinning them across his chest even as he came to see Sherlock packing up his instrument. His smile was sleepy, but it was warm. It was such a welcome sight that for a moment the detective allowed a small smile to pass of his own, until he saw that John was surprised at his immediate response. Sherlock turned away and feigned interest in the horsehairs of his bow, casting a critical eye across its length as he held it up to his face. John rubbed at his face, shaking his head clear of whatever thought had caused him to pause. His cheeks were slightly pinker than normal as he greeted the detective.
The second event is of a more personal nature, as my grandmother has very recently passed away. I will admit I am doing my best to update with chapters I have already written out, but for the next few weeks things are going to be rough. Thank you for your understanding, and I hope you enjoy the read.
What was left of the strawberries were left, rather forgotten in the waking glow and the sound of John’s voice murmuring softly in Sherlock’s ear.
How he in the end was the one to long for the weight of a gun in his hands.
“Fear, Mr. Holmes. I am John's Fear....”
“John,”
…” John wheezed, struggling to keep his voice calm. He couldn’t reach for a weapon this time, and there was no discernable way to escape. His only hope for salvation at this point was to try and reason with the creature, despite the fact that the man before him seemed about as reasonable as a king lording over his land. “Didn’t kidnap him… he’s hurt… trying… trying to help.”
Sherlock wondered to himself briefly if Victor would consider his meetings with Sebastian a relationship. Not that there had been any sex really,  none that counted, but out of everyone at the school, Sherlock had walked away the most satisfied with his encounters with the man. It wouldn't come as a surprise to him, really, if Victor thought him just the slightest bit infatuated. Sherlock was after all, a very good liar.
John’s jaw clenched and he prepared himself for backlash. “You’re just going to have to trust me. And if you try, I’ll burn your coat. You’ll be stuck here, on land forever.”
There was a song they sang in the air, and as if sensing he didn’t recognise it, John spoke in breathless wonder and surprise.
Lying there on the tiled floor, already scooting himself out the door and away before the police came looking for him, the Doctor hadn't been sure whether to laugh or to perhaps begin to sob.
Though it was summer the evenings were still a little chilly, and John shivered slightly before turning away to look at his grandma with large, greedy eyes. The blue in them appeared bluer, filled with barely-suppressed excitement.
It was then the detective thought it was safe enough to move forward, and he was lucky he did. In the next moment John was falling forward, trembling in the aftermath of what could only be shock. Sherlock’s strong arms caught the soldier before he could fall face-first, holding John’s head against his chest so that the man could smell the soap Sherlock used, feel the texture of the worn sleepshirt he wore.
She begged, but knew it would not come
It was hard to see in the dark, but he could see a dresser in one corner of the room. Cobwebs clung to wood and glass figurines, dancers caught mid-pose and left to dust. He approached, recognising a small, rectangular shape. The music box was made of dark wood, John guess walnut. Unlike the rest of the items, it was oddly free of dust. He was reluctant to touch it, but it kept drawing his eye. Somehow, John felt that this was what he had been meant to find. His hand reached towards the box, fingers curling around its smooth, plain sides. The wood was warm, as if it had just been held in living hands.
He’d call go to the flat tomorrow, he resolved, if Sherlock didn’t answer by this evening. Mrs Hudson would let him in if John wasn’t around. His resolve hardened, the D.I turned to the last of his papers for the night.
where it was distributed. He did not like how despite his hormones and despite the years, he still had a curve to his thighs and hips if he ate too much. If he went too long without a case. He did not
And the power of that voice, the unyielding force behind that song, caused the soldier's legs to buckle, his thoughts freezing against his will as his body fell lax against the creature's hard ribs. John Watson was alive, panicking silently inside of himself, but outside he could not move. Could not speak. He was as limp as a rag doll as he felt a controlling domination pinning his body in place, a magic that he had spent the greater part of his life trying to convince himself didn't exist.
“Of course not. No one truly can… Aamon will be here for you in a moment.”
Surprisingly, Sherlock seemed to consider the idea. A contemplative look spread on his face as he stopped his restless plucking of his violin, setting it down on the table beside him.
“I'll talk to my mum and dad. I- I'm sure I can convince them. Once they see....” He trailed off then, and his cheeks turned ruddy in the dark. “Once they see how beautiful you are.”
Right away he knew she was a Dragon.
“Should I… instruct the servants not to disturb you? During the night, I mean…” Molly tucked a piece of her hair nervously over her right ear, gaze darting to the floor. Her hands were tightened together in knots, white-knuckled on the edges. It took a moment for Sherlock to realise what Molly was implying, and when he did he stiffened ever so slightly.
“You’ll take us to Irene, won’t you? Her Help’s feeling a little under the weather.”
John couldn’t help but smile at the Selkie’s enthusiasm, coming to sit at the shoreline to take his shoes off and relax. The groceries in the car could wait for now, he thought.
“....No?”
The silence permeated between the two of them like a thick cloak, until finally John could stand it no longer. Cracking a vaguely nervous smile, he tried to make his tone light, friendly.
Mike!” John grinned as he saw his friend, broad in the middle and also in muscle, cleave a demon clean in two as it tried to crawl over the wall. The flash of the man’s blade gave the secret of its make - another deal with the Fae that was turning out to come in handy.
He was above begging like some dog for treats
Despite his obvious distress, it was apparent the Colonel seemed determined to appear as unfazed as possible. His posture was ramrod straight, but still he didn't seem to be able to touch the nearly poignant presence the woman brought with her as she walked, head held high to the centre of the 'V' formation to rather symbolically, stand in Sebastian's place. John despite his fear, felt a small smile grace his features. There was something about the woman, something guilelessly powerful and solid as she took charge of the situation and brought soothing water to a burn. Like a calm after a storm she immediately drained the tension from the situation, walking over to help Sebastian's Dragon to his feet even while shooting Wilkes a barely-noticeable glare.
“Show me.” He implored at the fountain, crouching towards the basin. The stone woman stood above him, her outstretched arms now seeming to act like claws reaching for him. The water rippled, shuddered. Sherlock stared at it hard, momentarily thrown. He watched as slowly, painfully, revealed the image of blonde hair, blue eyes that look habitually tired and worried. The crooked smile that flashed up at him made Sherlock’s lip curl into a snarl.
That was until Seb.
In real life, things were shades of monochrome black and white. Sometimes, pale blue.
“Please John. I don't know what to do. At this rate, I'm about ready to do something I really don't want to do. She's going to eat me, or worse if I don't figure out what set her off! ”
. Sarah's soft curves surrounded him, pulled him under like a heavy aphrodisiac, her heat leaving him craving more. To touch more, to taste, to find. Alone in the darkness of her flat they were two shadows, tracing each other's outline, mapping out each other's skin.
And a mess it
He just needed to get laid. Really, John was convinced that it would fix everything. He wasn’t getting regular sex, and his brain was crossing wires, making intimacy appear where there was none. He had seen it happen loads of time, in the army. Soldiers, not in love but desperate and needy would share each other’s beds, their hands fumbling and their minds shut off so that they could merely feel instead of think. It was flame as opposed to fire.  He was merely sexually frustrated,

to describe a man before, but in his somewhat dazed state of mind that was the only adjective that could fit the image before him. In the silhouette of the bathroom light, those pale eyes were nearly clear, staring at a spot in the wall with a lost, wandering kind of gaze. There was a quiet loneliness, and a terrible fear hidden in the ice of that look. It was a brokenness that made the soldier think that Sherlock never intended for the likes of him to see.
Mycroft smiled smugly at him, grey eyes appearing nearly colourless against a backdrop of London-grim clouds. His hands were folded over the handle of his ever-present umbrella, and when John turned towards him reluctantly one moved to gesture to the empty space beside him. John didn’t move, glaring at the spot as if it had personally offended him.
He smiled, immensely pleased with himself, before standing and running off back towards the water.
The detective's face was impassive, but uncertainty flickered in those irises as John became aware that Sherlock was holding him, curled about him like he was afraid to let go. John's heart began to beat faster, and he scrambled to find some excuse. Some lie. Some vague faerie tale to keep up the charade he had kept for so long.
“He’s new to the class and I had an empty seat beside me, so I let him sit. His name’s James Junior, but he doesn’t like the junior bit much. He can do maths in his head really well, I watched him! He has this trick where he can just remember what multiplies with what nicely. He liked my colouring books, but he can’t draw very well. He likes Doctor Who and The Avengers like me!”
The offer was given casually, and John for a moment was taken aback by the simplicity of it. The option for things to go back to normal, to be as they were, was not a gift that could be considered lightly. The idea that he could treat all of this as a particularly lively nightmare appealed to the soldier deeply, if only for a barest moment. Then Sherlock shifted, groaning something unintelligible. His song was filled with only one question:
Though the memory hadn't been all bad.
He was at times, deathly quiet. He slunk about John with a skittish sort of grace, just at the corner of the soldier's eyes. Incredibly agile and flexible, John sometimes found the Dragon went ridiculous lengths to avoid being in his direct line of sight, a common sulking place being atop the refrigerator, where the Dragon's impossibly long tail would curl and uncurl about the cool handle.
good, and illogically Sherlock's brain tried to tell him that anyone with this kind of cooking ability couldn't be evil.

Shyla looked at themselves in their reflection, taking in the short cropped curls and pale grey eyes that seemed nearly colourless in the bathroom light. The sharp ridge of their cheekbones were prominent, more so than they would have been if she hadn’t been suffering lately under the weight of her own private moments of self-doubt. Though the results could have been much worse, truthfully, if John hadn’t been involved. The thought sent a lingering pang of annoyance through the detective, her lips turning downwards in a small frown. Her reflection stared back at her, for once angles and lines that did not seem too feminine. The detective turned and drew her robe closer about herself, searching instinctively for her companion.
Without preamble, Sherlock raised his hand to point towards the roof.
No one was hunting for John Watson. He would be fine. To be sure, Sherlock traced the Bond Bite one last time. It was already taking, starting to heal over and scab. When the Selkie drew his hand away, it was stained crimson pink with his new Mate's blood. He licked it clean, purring in content.

“Unconfirmed,” the woman denied, jerking her chin in negativity. “We received intel about twenty minutes ago, but are as of yet unsure that it was sent by the queen herself. We’re awaiting confirmation now and working with your government to reach a more immediately stable political situation.”
The elder Holmes was worried.
Sherlock's uninvited guest
singing in his blood. He hovered only a moment, asking Sherlock the one inquiry that would decide whether or not the soldier would lean forward, or try to escape one last time. “Different how?”
Behind that word, John felt the thrill of the creature’s song fill him. It was heavy – much heavier than Sherlock’s, commanding and more demanding. The army doctor felt his entire body tremble with it, the order of a king lancing through his mind and spearing it. Though John was stubborn, he found that even he could not disobey. A puppet pulled to his feet by invisible strings, the Selkie paused just long enough at the edge of the cove to glare at the risen sun in disdain.
time and trouble.”
The detective noted how John clutched at his shoulder, as if trying to stem the bleeding from a wound that was long ago healed. He also noted how John’s eyes tracked him with his movement, aware but not entirely lucid. Hyper-vigilance had always been an issue, but now as Sherlock moved towards him he saw it come into full fruition. Instantly John’s back was to a wall, covering vulnerability even as he assessed Sherlock as a threat. Yet there was a glimmer of something in John’s eyes, a sort of hazy recognition that something in this scenario was not quite right.
Sherlock appears to be more than just a little shocked at the rough and acerbic tone in which he is being addressed, and Conrad notes that even though he hides it well his blue-green eyes dart over his face, trying to see an echo of the kind Army Doctor underneath this hardened and bitter man. Conrad stared back at him without fear, right hand still holding out for a smoke impatiently as he tried to ignore the pulsating ache in his head. It was starting to fade now, but it still hurt like hell. When the Detective did speak, it was slow and cautious, as if he was facing a wild animal. Which he might very well
Mycroft couldn’t help but think. Compared to his own natural chilled disposition, it was like leaning into a min-sun. He liked it more than he wanted to admit.
her! The woman from my dream!”
John Watson was
hurt you for it.”
Sharp teeth grazed John’s collarbone, and he whined despite himself.  His head felt fuzzy - a mix of adrenaline and lust shooting through him in surprisingly equal waves. He was terrified, but a part of him was also feeling very much alive in a way he never seemed to replicate when he wasn’t in immediate danger. Sherlock’s lips pressed to the skin of his neck, sucking in a way that made the soldier’s toes curl and his heart drum in a frenzy. In the darkness of the hidden post, no one would come looking for John for a good hour at least. Not while they themselves were being attacked by Demons.
The woman's answering smile is cool.
His thoughts break off again as this time Mycroft's phone rings, humming in his pocket. His elder brother rolls his eyes and reaches into his pants, pulling out the phone and looking at faint surprise at the number. When he picked up, his voice was even.
The word was not a typical nickname for Hatchlings, nor was it true Dragon-Tongue. It was an old language, the language of royalty. It was not entirely a nickname, but a title. It was one Mycroft knew and loved, something he shared with his family:
Would she be punished? If so, she should let them in. Better
, in the waiting room of a hospital.
Sherlock felt this way even as the boy stirred beneath his hand, and sleepily his friend murmured, “M-mum?”
“Sentiment is a chemical defect of the losing side.” John murmured quietly through lips that felt stiff. His mind was reeling. Much of Sherlock’s seemingly inexplicable behaviours, the shutting people out, the nasty habit of his of deducing potential companions to shreds, it was all beginning to come together. Yet the more John saw, the less he
It was quiet, a comfortable calm settling over the two as they patiently waited for night to fall. Those clever blue eyes didn't flick towards her, but Sarah could tell somehow that he knew she was looking at him. She still jumped though, when his low voice murmured against the filter of his cigarette, answering her unspoken question.
John didn't count himself to be particularly faithful in his beliefs of the supernatural, but in that moment there was no denying that the man that had appeared in the centre of the village hadn't been Human. The weight of the chains that clinked heavily on his wrists and about his throat attested to that much. As did the burning feeling John felt tingling all over him, like he had tried to kiss a lightning bolt and only just survived. He wouldn't be surprised it his hair was singed, although from the feel of it he wasn't actually physically harmed. Just nauseous, as if his insides had been rearranged. For a moment he had to lean forward, tucking his head between his knees. The feeling that he was going to lose the rich food he had scarfed down during the festival grumbled through him, passing only when he forced himself to breathe deeply.
Plain.
The Dragon turned and regarded the young man speculatively for a long time with narrowed, cool eyes. John nearly jumped when he heard the rumbling murmur inside of his head, rolling like a storm coming off from the sea.
Physical hurt was easier, than this. Yet chancing a glance up at his partner, John knew without a shadow of a doubt that it was no longer an option.
John could recall one of the countless notes Ella had made, back before she had realised he could read her writing upside down.
, as his friend had slowly turned into little more than a vegetable, floating in the lull between cases and anything of interest. It was different from his usual sulking, this heavy, oppressive atmosphere that clung to his skinny form like a grey cloud. Somehow; it felt sharper, more dangerous and volatile. Like John might get struck with lightning if he let himself get too close.
As he rose, he read the words he had been staring at for most of the evening, the paragraph written in wide, looping handwriting, ornamented with swirling lines and curving “E”s.
In the early silence of the flat, Sherlock groaned, unwilling to open his eyes even as he lay in bed. He could feel the pressure, crawling under his skin like a thousand fire ants preparing to bite. If he dared to look, they'd sink their teeth into his flesh.
her in that way, a cold hatred made her chest feel frozen. She wanted to tell Kate this, beg her to run away with her to some city, where neither of them were known. She wanted to tell her that she could never marry someone she didn’t love, but that would be throwing Kate’s own bravery away. Most of all, Irene never wanted to leave this tree, return back to the village that expected her to carry out her duty.
The pieces then came together for John, and he breathed sharply through his nose, blue eyes widening.
Hamish grinned, and the look was so happy that Sherlock’s chest tightened with love. Drawing his son into a warm hug, the detective rested his chin on the boy’s wild curls. Affection was not something that Sherlock often openly displayed, but the soft spot he had for the two people in his life could be seen if one only peered into a quiet moment in the relative safety that was
His teeth sank into his wrist before he even realized what he was doing, dispelling that thought as a wave of pain came over him and he tasted blood on his lips. Growling slightly, he licked the coppery liquid that coated his teeth. For a moment, it felt like it might steady him. The crimson liquid was so familiar, so vivid, that he felt his head clear in an instant. He almost debated biting himself again, mesmerized by the tingling pain that shot up and down his arm.
John rolled his eyes, but put the coat on regardless. It was a short walk to Sherlock’s house, one in which he still had time to panic over all the things that could go wrong. By the time he’d got to number 59 on his list, he had arrived at the address. He hesitated for a moment before gingerly knocking on the door. A woman answered. This time, it was defiantly Sherlock’s mother. The resemblance was uncanny, except she was blonde, with softer features, unlike Sherlock with his raven locks, and sharp cheekbones.
“Was she any trouble?”
“We’re sooooorrry.” Rosie slurred, then burst in to a fit of giggles.
“Nope.”
“Starving.”
“Dinner will just be a second- ooo.”
"So has she been eating?"
Sherlock’s desperate begs caught Johns attention, and the blond went back to furiously jerking his wrist up and down the other boy’s length. He moved his hips faster, hitting Sherlock’s prostate with every move.
She doesn’t hit me with her bag, so maybe not.
“Here.”
Sherlock gritted her teeth as she nodded, and allowed the nurse and Mycroft to help her up.
“Oh Jesus- mmmngh!” John groaned.
Sherlock grinned, and turned himself round so he was resting against johns chest.
He could feel himself spiralling, his head spinning as he felt himself tumbling through the abyss-
John’s sinful words of filth combined with his finger sliding just between his cheeks had Sherlock howling a loud cry as he came in Johns hand and in his pants...
“Love you too.”
Sherlock allowed his head to drop back in bliss as John massaged his scalp.
Sherlock clenched around Johns stiff shaft, milking him of his release as he finished himself, semen spilling down his thighs. John dropped his head to rest between Sherlock’s shoulder blades as he came down from his high.
He went to pull back, but John held him close, gripping him by the hips and pulling him up so the brunette was straddling him, his head adorned with ‘freshly got fucked hair’, strands of it dangling over his eyes.
No time to take off his shoes.
“Ok, ok. I’m going to pull out, we’re gonna get cleaned up, and then we’re gonna wait and see if it gets better.”
“Come back to bed...?” Sherlock questioned, moving his hands up to where John’s towel was tied.
“Yes, Alright. Thank you.”
I turn to look at him, my eyebrows quirked.
“No, sorry... you’re not.” John rambled as he cleared his thoughts.
John pulled his mouth off at that moment, and sat back on his haunches.
“I... I... oh god... ah!”
John places the ring on to her finger, and pulled her in to his arms.
John looked up from his over night bag at Sherlock who was eying him flirtatiously over his book.
“And what happened?” John asked quietly, his face right next to Sherlock’s.
“What?”
“Oh quit your whining.” John chuckled, lightly bumping Sherlock with his head.
“I tested to see by how much a turtles’ reaction time would increase if it was dosed on caffeine, and by how much it would decrease when dosed on alcohol.”
“I can do it.”
2. Daddy kink
“Lestrade? As in my former boss Lestrade?”
“That window in the shed is broken.”
She knew he wouldn’t leave her of his own volition.
John quirked an eyebrow.
“Coffee?”
He waited for Sherlock to stop quivering before pulling him up so he was perched on his lap.
Sherlock nodded, and ran out into the hallway where he spotted the phone on top of a cabinet. He called for an ambulance, then went back into Harry’s room.
“Alive.”
“Yes, he is always like this.”
John furrowed his brows, but he didn’t question it further. Besides, he was a little distracted by Sherlock’s attire. Tight fitting white t-shirt, cute little shorts, sexy long legs, white sneakers... John felt his cock stirring in his boxers. He snapped his eyes back up to Sherlock’s face.
“My god, earlier...” His lips move down to nip at my neck. “When I was making love to you... you’ve never looked more stunning.”
“Steady on.” He chuckled, holding Sherlock’s shoulders.
At the time, John had been horrified at her words, but now he felt he understood what she meant. Whether he cared or not, his friends would still be dead, and all the soldiers in the trenches would be their mourners.
“Oh god...”
“Well.” She replied cautiously. “You?”
John poked his tongue between his lips, and swiped it across the surface.
John followed mike over to grab a drink when he caught a glimpse of something dark out of the corner of his eye.
Sherlock had completely forgotten about his brother, and all but fell through the bathroom door in a fit of giggles.
It was more comfortable in the parlour, but the big bay windows in the dining hall lit up the entire room, making it easier on her eyes as she darned Lucy’s socks.
“I have to go.”
“Who is he?”
I do as he says, and my eyes fall on something I wasn’t quite expecting.
“Five months now, isn’t it babe?”
“You alright?”
Throughout the day, Sherlock and John snuck cheeky grins, winks, flirty glances, and heated stares. Throughout maths, Sherlock could feel Johns intense gaze on the back of his head. He could hardly keep his focus. When they got back to Sherlock’s house, they all but fell through the door. It was new and exciting, adrenaline coursing through their veins. Keeping their hands off each other was becoming a mundane task. All their pent up desire and attraction for one another had finally been released, and it was exploding like a volcano. As they made their way through the house, John kissed Sherlock’s full lips hungrily, nipping at his lips, thrusting his tongue in and out of his mouth, running his hands all over his lean body.
“I could stab you in your pretty little throat...”
“Well, if you want to. I mean, I’ve never actually taken you out on a date... but if you don’t want to, I-“
“Ah!” He groaned when Sherlock immediately pushed their bodies flushed together. The brunette moved his lips down to johns neck, biting and sucking. John moaned loudly as Sherlock continued his decent down his body, slowly sinking to his knees as he went.
“Oh fuck.” He moaned as John pushed further into his passage.
“Yep.”
Our eyes meet in a lust filled stare as he presses one final kiss to my hand.
“I... wanted to see you.”
“I don’t think vanilla pod over here can handle the answer.” She said, winking at the girl behind her.
“Ok.”
His giggles quickly turns in to a sharp cry when I run my tongue over his rim.
Oh fuck.
Sherlock pulled his lips into a line.
“If you want to dress one of my friends up to go instead of you, I suggest you use a male one-“
It was so intense with the blindfold, everything John did a complete surprise to him.
“I do indeed.”
“Fair enough.”
“No, dad, I’m not.”
“Didn’t dodge getting jammed in there, did he?” Rosie gawks with a grin.
“What?” Asked the other boy as he tentatively perched at the edge of the bed.
Indeed, it was she who needed the comfort.
“Mmm... Two days in a row now...”
“Here you are! Sorry it took so long; your mother phoned, Sherlock dear.”
“I got you a coffee.”
“Do you want some of mine?”
He missed her so much. He hadn’t seen her in over three years, and it was killing him. He lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling as he waited for sleep to come. He was on duty tonight, and he needed rest. He was just drifting off when Thompson came back in.
“Fine, I’ll play ball. Yes, for rescuing me.”
“Well,” He starts, moving across the room towards me till there’s only a few inches between us. “I was ‘intending’ on doing... this.”
“Bloody hell, Sherl, you sure do know how to welcome a chap home.”
“Want you to sit with me.”
“Oh...” Sherlock hummed, her hips bucking.
“Yes, Thank you.”
“Hey, you ok?”
Dr Hooper runs over to him, and hands him a bag. She walks back over, hand to her head.
In addition to the teams marching in and out of the ground floor, Mycroft has apparently authorized John to be in contact with a new therapist. What's even more surprising to Sherlock is the use John's made of this resource.

"I didn't say any of that out loud, did I." His conlang will include many, many expletives.
"I'll have them get you a bright pink case," John murmurs from one side of a crooked smile, and then they're laughing again.

Protecting the newly healed flesh from friction and moisture.
He straightens up a bit and looks up into those cherished blue eyes, reddened now with regret. His own are stinging, and he'd be hard pressed to determine whether it's from remorse for what he's done, or gratitude that they've survived it.
It's ridiculous and painful and stilted and the most beautiful thing Sherlock's ever experienced. John keeps his eyes fixed on his cards for the most part, only glancing up now and then as if to confirm that his audience is still attentive. As if anything could distract Sherlock away from John's words. The voice that's so often and easily switched between charming and commanding now wavers between choked-up emotion and an awkward monotone. The speech is speckled with fierce emphasis on this word and that phrase, and his heart thuds painfully at each instance. Sherlock barely blinks, forgets to breath, drinks in every syllable and sigh like a parched man at an oasis.
His first few sessions are not auspicious. The book jacket hook would be that John stomps in, demands that the psychologist "fix him," and then refuses to cooperate further.
"Did you just call me a child?!"

“You  didn’t deserve a single one of those ugly, untrue things I said. Please  believe me. You’re human in all the best ways and none of the bad.

You’re the most  kind and caring person I know, even though you won’t admit to even  having feelings some days. You have the biggest heart, the greatest  capacity to feel.”
John’s name, but only a faint rasp is produced. It’s enough to catch the other man’s attention, however, and Sherlock steels himself as dark blue eyes flicker upwards.

- and the conclusion he'd come to before of John being a free man is still solid and stable. Stronger now than when it first came to mind, even, shored up by all the kisses and caresses and murmured praises even when Sherlock hasn't said anything clever. Not once has there been a look of guilt or regret, or hesitation born from a pang of conscience.

He confronts Sherlock. Sherlock is defensive. It goes from well-meaning to just plain mean in about ten seconds.
This answer satisfies Mycroft, though it hadn't done so with John. Sherlock had rebuffed all the eager executive's overtures, and had soon needed to issue an outright rejection, stating that he enjoyed John's company but that he declined the dubious honor of being John's first foray into romance sans ulterior motives. It would be doomed to fail, and what was more, he had absolutely refused to begin a relationship in which
"Whenever you're ready is fine," John reassures him, as soon as their eyes meet. "Now, later, or even never if you change your mind. I needed to say the things I did because...well, I needed to, and I'd hoped it would help more than it'd harm for you to hear me say them. I don't need a note back if you don't want to give one, all right?"
Sherlock’s still too stiff for his jaw to drop, but he does manage to throw his eyebrows ceiling-ward. He wonders if there's any footage that Mycroft hasn't had destroyed.
= = = = =
“And you went from threatening to wining and dining…how?”
Happily, he realizes that he can still run his mind through its paces even if his body is confined to bed. All of John's strictures have been regarding physical overexertion, not mental, after all. Sherlock examines this loophole from all angles. Concluding with a satisfied nod that it's got quite a comfortable margin of safety, he then gathers up observations that he hadn't been consciously collecting but knows he's made all the same, and begins doing some maintenance on his Mind Palace.

Two  more big fat tears were shaken loose, and John gently knuckled them  away. It made Sherlock shiver and sigh and close his eyes.

Apologies in advance; it may take me a bit to get the next chapter posted. I'm writing three chapters at once, in a way, and if I scrap a bit in chapter 11, I end up having to re-write a good bit of chapter 9, interconnected as they're turning out to be. To avoid post-posting edits, I'm going to wait until chapter 11 is at least fleshed out in a satisfactory manner before posting chapter 9.
He holds tighter, grasps harder, and contented hums give way to predatory rumbles. If Sherlock manages to keep his eyes open, he gets to see John's pupils blow wide and his face flush rosy red.
John gave up on dignity and did the hand-wave of the vocabularily challenged.
The front door opens on a fixed schedule in the morning and at night, with a pattern of comings and going throughout the day meant to seem random. Based on footfalls, there are three, possibly four rotating teams of four agents each occupying 221A and C. Mycroft must have sent Mrs. Hudson away on some pretense; if she was aware of my return, no force on earth or pain of hip could have kept her from marching up here to scold me and make a fuss. In fact, other than you and Mycroft, the only people who know of my return are some Landmark staff and NHS workers who've no doubt been forced to sign draconian non-disclosure agreements. Well, and the agents installed downstairs.
“Not attraction?”
31.	Sit on my lap while I sit in my chair and nuzzle my hair
"'S not like I'm handing you a great big basket of fish and chips. Calm down." John's tone is amused more than chiding, so Sherlock makes grabby hands at the plate coming his way and is rewarded with another huff of laughter.
"I'm not bored," Sherlock protests, skipping ahead a bit in the conversation.

Swabs, nitrile gloves, finger cots, and one lighted magnifier buried under all the other packets and boxes.
John barks a laugh and his whole demeanor relaxes into amusement, diffusing the tension of a moment before. He straightens up and away, unclenches his hands so he can drag them down his thighs. His shoulders drop, and the wrinkles marring his forehead scatter into laugh lines instead.
The blonde thought for a moment, then giggled at her answer.
Sherlock was eventually swayed, and after dressing in pyjama shorts, followed John out in to the living room.
“I also forget that it’s an invasion of privacy. It’s like looking inside your head...
Sherlock lay on johns heaving chest, his legs sprawled either side of the athletes thighs.
“Because I like you.”
“Not at all, darling.” She smiled softly at him. “You will be grateful for the time together, I’m sure.”
Sherlock blushed, and hid his head in his curls.
Sherlock looked up from his book. He looked at John, searching his eyes for a moment.
John nods once before leaning in to kiss me again, not like before, but soft and gentle.
“Gave up mathematics to have children. That was totally worth it.” Mrs Holmes grumbled to herself as she disappeared down the hall.
“Where’s your mother?”
“That was fun.”
John and Sherlock had only had unprotected sex a handful of times, including their first time, and when neither of them could be bothered to go to shop for more condoms. John had to admit that he preferred it without, although there was very little difference. They had only ever had sex with each other, and kept on top of routine checks regardless.
I continue to work him on my fingers for a little bit longer, drawing low moans and whines from his beautiful parted lips.
I find him in his bunk, blabbering away about solar panels, or something to that extent.
He just gets me all worked up.
Johns words sent shivers down Sherlock’s spine, and blood to his groin. He looked up at John and batted his dark lashes at him as he swallowed around his cock.
“You don’t enrage me. I just... worry about you.”
“Who knows. But, you know what this means?”
“Alright.” She choked out.
“I still can after it stops raining. It’s only drizzling anyway.” Sherlock said as she tried to pull Lucy’s arms off her neck.
Sherlock wrapped his legs around John’s hips and locked his ankles together.
I unbuckle my belt with shaky fingers, and take my throbbing dick in hand.
Sherlock gasped at this, a bolt of arousal rushing straight to his already rock hard cock.
Yep. I’m gonna die here.
“Fuck...” Sherlock gasped, arching his back.
I’m a little astounded, but by no means displeased with how eager he is.
1. Are there any kinks you’d like them to experiment with?
“Stay?”
“Oh, you want to play it like that? Ok then.”
“Oh, that is a shame.” Mrs Holmes said, placing a hand between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, and tracing little circles on her skin, a method she’d used for years to sooth the eccentric child.
“I’m so sorry about all this. I’m sure you and John had a lovely day planned of playing video games, watching YouTube, and whatever else it is that you boys do.”
“She is.” She nodded to Mrs Hudson.
“Shall I tell you? Yes...”
...but it’s not his.
“You really don’t have boundaries.”
“How can you tell something’s wrong?”
“Ok, ok... this is probably gonna hurt.”
“Alright.” John said after a moment, thrilled at least that he would have his weekends back.
“Boy.”
"Hello, Sherlock."
“I was invited to this impromptu party, and I couldn’t get time off. Lestrade said I could go if I got someone to cover for me. Could you cover my shift tomorrow night?”
“Sunflowers?”
Oh, he is so going to get me fired.
John reached down beside Sherlock, and splashed a handful of water at the younger man.
“Yeah, sure.”
I clench my legs around his head and dig my heels in to his back... fuck.
“Of course.”
Merry Christmas. I shan’t say happy new year, as I believe it shall be anything but. I will however, wish you a better new year.
This was a common request of johns, but it was the exact opposite for John to apply lube to his own fingers, and start stretching himself too.
Sherlock age: 12
“If you ever want to be let out of these...” John drawled, a hand coming up to stroke Sherlock’s cheek. “I suggest you do as I say.”
“Boys! What a nice surprise.”
Sherlock drew his lip between his teeth, grinning. He settled down next to John, a few inches away, then pressed play. Throughout the film, he shuffled closer to John until they were shoulder to shoulder. John looked over to Sherlock, who was completely immersed in the film, gaze transfixed on the fight scene before him. He reached over, and took Sherlock’s pale hand in his. He tensed, then looked down at their joined hands, and smiled. By the end of the film, Sherlock had fallen asleep on johns shoulder. The older boy looked down at his dozing form, and tentatively pushed a dark curl away from his face. At the contact, his eyes fluttered open.
His lips part in a grin before he kisses me again.
“Hello.”
“There’s enough lube left.” John mused as he tapped the end of the bottle. “On your back then.”
She was rolling her hips against his again, causing maddening friction.
“Hello, Mrs Hudson. Is Sherlock here?” John asked anxiously, his fingers tugging at the hem on his shirt.
As I watch him, I begin to wonder what he’s like on the outside, at his full potential.
“Ugh, never mind. Hey john, Irene just-“
His heart started pounding when he heard keys in the door.
She found one that would fit him, and tossed it on top of the armful of clothes he was already holding.
“There’s no way he did this. I know him well, remember. He’s always in medical.” She reinstates, eyebrows raised.
“John...”
“Oh john!” Sherlock moaned when he felt Johns hand in between their legs.
Sad... no, hurt. He looks hurt.
Knight... Henry... yeah...
“Now.”
“That’s not what people normally say.”
“What I find it difficult to get my head wrapped around is the fact that you, a... genius... got caught.”
He does as I say, and leans his weight on my shoulder as I push my finger inside him.
She took one more puff before handing it back to John.
John was hungry for more. The way Sherlock’s pelvis was pressing in to his, rubbing against his erection, the friction driving him absolutely mad.
“Yes, babe?”
God, I would kill for a cigarette.
“No problem dear.”
"At least you're swapping your slippers for actual shoes."
Sherlock’s heart rate returned to normal.
John looked at the shoes Sherlock was indicating to. He was right.
“Yes. She’s alright though. She’s in a lot of pain, but she refuses to  let me call the doctor.”
“Yes, mother.”
John turned his head to look at the boy in question. Sherlock nodded.
“It’s not just me who’s getting turned on by theses panties, is it?”
John swallowed, then experimentally rolled his hips forwards.
“I’d tie you up now, but I didn’t bring a belt. I guess that’ll just be something nice for you to think about.”
“That’s England for you.” She sighed as she closed the door behind her.
“Can you make sure dad isn’t in our house when we get back?” He asked as they walked down to the bus stop.
The blond pressed an open mouth kiss to the other boy’s lips, emitting a low moan from him.
“Probably not, but you can give it a shot.”
I find my body yielding to him, my legs moving to cage his, my arms sneaking around him, my tongue thrusting in to his mouth.
“Sorry. I was just in the bathroom.” He mumbled as he crawled back under the covers.
“Marry me.”
Sherlock let out a little whimper, bitting his lip in a futile attempt to silence himself. He loved the idea of having John watch him. He knew he could put on a good show. He smirked at John as he grabbed the lube from him, and poured a generous amount on to his fingers. He moved to the top of the bed, and leant up against the headboard, his legs spread wide. John shuffled down to sit at the end of the bed to get a better view. Sherlock felt a rush of both arousal and confidence as he saw John watching him with a predatory glint in his eyes, practically drooling. He moved his hand in between his legs, and closed his eyes as he began circling his inner thighs. He grinned when he heard John let out a quiet groan. He moved his fingers closer to his hole, causing his legs to jerk involuntarily. John was sure he was sure he was going to draw blood as he bit down on his lip, barely able to control himself.
“I suppose.”
make that threat, for it certainly was the key to dismissing any possibility that they would pursue the issue further. But this also means that we must be even more vigilant in hiding our own depravity. If you were able to discover all from a few conversations with shopkeepers and one brief look, someone with lesser powers could, with time and enough information, infer the same of us.”
, he muttered to himself. Probably tracking down the source of some bauble or other all the crime scenes had in common. That was the only reason he could think of that would get the younger man anywhere near the immense and wildly popular store at this time of year.
“So, your accusation is that Watson and I are deviants. What illicit behaviour, precisely, do you intend to report to the police?” he drawled, leaning back in his chair and removing a cigarette from his case.
I was not the least bit surprised, but I did sigh in some exasperation. He can be so very stubborn sometimes. “Very well. Then I will tell you what they said.”
“You mean the opinion of a junkie,” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly.
John rose and stretched. “This place is a skip,” he commented mildly. He bent and picked up the cardboard box in which his new backgammon set had been. He turned it over in his hands idly. Something caught his eye. He examined it, then looked suspiciously at his mate. “Sherlock, what’s this?”

I see now first-hand how you obscure details of name and date and location, and of other identifiable information, and for that I am grateful. My aunt and my husband know the truth, of course, and if anyone in the village reads your tale I am certain they will immediately discern the truth, but it would benefit not one of them to reveal my true identity. I live with my husband in a pleasant house within walking distance of my aunt’s home, and as you have in your story changed our names entirely (I do wonder how you came up with Helen Stoner, and Julia, and Stoke Moran—I find myself admiring the name Julia so much that the first girl we have will be named Julia—her second name will be my dear sister’s true Christian name), no one with whom we associate currently has any idea of the truth of it.
“Sherlock, I do not need to remind you of our mother’s fate.”
“No,” I had to tell our dear friend. “This is not one of our usual arguments. It was nothing that he did. I am not angry with him. It was something that I did that has upset him, and quite deservedly he is angry with me. He has withdrawn from me and does not wish to have anything to do with me at present. I did not mean to upset him—truly, I did not, but I am, to be honest, quite ashamed of myself.”
you not to write all that.”
proof.
“I… did not… I did not understand what they meant until you taught me.”
Yorkshire puddings. Sherlock accepted gravy, which was a bit of a surprise, but only because it was piping hot and in a small cruet of its own, so he could rip off strips of the light, golden treat and dip them into it one at a time before popping them into his mouth. He even unbent enough to give a short lecture on the science behind the dish, and Mrs Hudson took him up on his challenge to perform a few experiments with her recipe and technique.
“I am in dead earnest, John,” he declared a bit sulkily.
“Brilliant observation—you haven’t lost a thing,” John teased, eliciting a bemused scowl.
“Uh… mmm. You are… oh… correct.”
“Meaning that if I re-married I would probably not be renting out rooms any longer. You would have to find new lodgings—and how would you expect to do that? Surely you do not think you could find anyone else willing to tolerate—the queer visitors. The chemicals. The erratic hours. The
“So, when you said that your weakness was caused by the heat, I knew that to be somewhat of an untruth.”
I was alarmed that he had put himself in such jeopardy, and Miss Stoner also voiced her distress at his foolhardy action, but he waved his pale white hand languidly, insisting that, as he was anticipating the attack, he had not been in any danger.
“His knee?” I managed, despite feeling as if I could not breathe.
“He has his ways. We communicate quite well, he and I.” Winifred’s usually warm, kind eyes were glittering and cold, and she was glad that her patient was too out of it to take any notice. It would have frightened him, she suspected. “Time to go,” she stated flatly, jerking her head towards the door.
“You got it wrong. We’re the ones threatening you,” Mark commented.
He sighed and ducked his head. “I… yeah,” he agreed.
“No, perhaps
“Oh, well…” she demurred.
that you are willing to try new styles; that you can find a yellow-backed novel harmless and entertaining. There are many times when I am envious of your ability to enjoy such things.”
Mrs Parker was not easily shocked, but there was really no other way that she could have reacted to the sight of the prodigal son.
His eyes opening wide, he dropped his book and reached out.
They were interrupted by their boss suddenly—and completely uncharacteristically—throwing his mobile angrily to his desk. They glanced at each other before both bolting into the inner office.
John grinned. “It’s got a shop label on it,” he pointed out.
Sherlock paused in his efforts and looked from one to the other of them, frowning as well and now apparently trying to follow the conversation.
“Story?”
“He’s obsessed with pirates,” Mum explained, smiling.
“Doctor Watson and I share diggings. We have done so for some years now. In fact, that is how we met—we were both seeking someone with whom to share lodgings. Hardly an unusual arrangement, particularly considering the costs of rent in London.”
After just those few days, I felt at ease with him—my life as well as Sherlock’s was essentially in his hands and by necessity privacy was a thing currently unknown. So, as we listened for anything alarming (and watched for a wet and bare Sherlock making an escape attempt; I certainly wouldn’t have been the slightest bit surprised), I asked him a bit about himself.
“Yes.”
Yes, Mycroft could see it—a wicked, bruised and oozing area marring the thin layer of flesh. It was red and looked hot and inflamed. “He’s taking antibiotics, is he not?” he inquired. “Won’t they take care of that?”
wearing.
His second year—the year with the equally intelligent and musically gifted William—had been a glimmer of light, but that had unfortunately been snuffed out as William finished his schooling there and Sherlock, instead of returning for his third year, truly disappeared for the first time.
“You mean knock him out and strap him down on that table?” the government man hissed. “No. Absolutely not. Can you just give him something to help calm him?”
“Hiding?” I echoed sharply. “Absolutely not. That would be tantamount to admitting our guilt.”
He tried shouting for help
The remainder of the evening consisted of a great deal of bare Sherlock under me and sheets that would need to be changed.
“I believe that you will find some things a bit more
Sherlock hovered about rather uselessly, whilst I carefully began to attend to our landlady’s injury. At that point, she rather firmly instructed him to wipe up all the spilled (and now rather firmed up) broth from the floor, and we both breathed a sigh of relief as this task distracted him for several minutes.
“She did. Brave girl—she looked me in the eye then, and her voice quivered only the slightest bit as she explained that, other than a few words, she cannot read nor write. She has been managing the orders for the greengrocer and the butcher—but even that, she admitted, she rather cheated at. She has an excellent memory, and I realise now that whenever I made a list, I would read it out to her before giving it to her. She would simply hand the list over to the boy, and when the deliveries came, she recalled precisely what I had requested and was able to check that everything was correct in that way. Really rather clever of her,” she mused.
Sherlock huffed in frustration. “Fine. If I accept—which I am not certain I do—that certain of my actions evoked memories of our intimate times together, even whilst investigating a crime, I still do not understand why you could not… erm…
Mycroft fidgeted with the handle of his umbrella. “I don’t exactly have him under surveillance,” he offered sulkily.
We have breakfasted. Well, I have; Sherlock toyed with some toast and had some coffee, then pushed himself away from the table with an impatience that has become so familiar as to be commonplace these days. He is now involved in reading the newspapers Mycroft has had delivered to us. Well, he is attempting to read them. As so often happens now, he cannot concentrate on any piece for more than a few seconds. His eyes flit over and across; up and down—sometimes alighting on a headline and sometimes on an inconsequential detail such as the comparative quality of the paper on which each is printed. He rustles the pages and turns from one to another edition constantly.
“Take that back!” Mark shouted at John. “Piece of shit—you been reading those medical books again. Big mouth in class. Think you’re smarter than us.”
“Sherlock, nightshirts have become rather old-fashioned. Do you not see the advertisements?”
Sherlock did not reply. He did not acknowledge in any way that he was even listening; he had wandered over to where I had stacked the bits of his composition and was looking down at them with an expression on his face that I cannot quite describe.
Sherlock gave him a small smile and tore them open. “What… oh. These are rather intriguing,” he admitted. “Look.” He held up two colourful boxes so Greg could see.
“Could we not simply advertise for a servant? Even if it is a temporary position, there are always many people desirous of employment. Sherlock, give me my bag.” I held my hands out and he obediently placed it in them. I looked up into his face. Yes, he was clearly distressed.
“Mycroft,” he greeted his brother. He had looked up, examining him intently when he arrived, but now he dropped his eyes to his bandaged hands as they rested on his legs. He was sitting—not pacing or thrashing about. Such a simple, commonplace thing—and I did not realise until I write about it now—something which means so much.
The frenzied man, his dark curls covering his eyes, was throwing whatever was at hand as hard as he could. The nurse on duty—Winifred—was rather fearlessly braving the bombardment of hardcover books as she tried to edge closer. The entrance of the two men distracted him—just for a second—and she had lunged at him. She hated using force, but her patient was at risk of injuring himself.
“Driver! New Scotland Yard! Now!”
“For about a quarter of an hour,” she retorted, quickly, then took a good—generous—sip of her drink.
“Yes, except for your brother,” I agreed, “but I do not think that even you could detect such minute signs in someone you just met, and in a public place, where he would certainly be cautious about his behaviour.”
this? How can you conclude that it is a man from so little information?” I was spluttering, the questions crowding upon one another.
I nodded. He does not have to shave more than every third day or so to maintain his meticulous toilette.
“Ah. Well. For one, I understand where all the ‘confirmed bachelor’ rumours came from now.”
I was not disappointed.
“What on earth is going on, Doctor?” Mrs. Hudson demanded. She was standing before me in the hall, her arms crossed and her face severe. She was wearing her nightdress. She glared down at my case. “Did you two have an argument?”
“She came up and I explained my idea. She was… polite, of course, but it seemed as if something in her… oh, my dear Doctor Watson, she just seemed suddenly so very downcast.”
“That was quite good,” Sherlock commented, wiping his lips delicately. “Thank you, John.”
“Enough.”
Or finding out that his patient was a scar-riddled, starving, self-harming drug addict and victim of unfathomable violence who could not speak and at times acted like a small, frightened child—when he wasn’t acting like a paranoid mess?
“I’m a real pirate!” he declared, brandishing the pistol in one hand and the telescope in the other, and both older men laughed when he attempted to look through the glass with the eye covered by the patch. “Oops,” he commented, laughing at himself.
“You were being overly emotional!”
“Oh, my love, I am sorry, but I do understand precisely why she reacted the way she did. That was probably one of the most unseemly displays she is
I groaned. “I am so sorry, my dear friend. I was overindulging a great deal at that time.”
“No! No, I do not mean to disturb your investigation. I am sufficiently in control of my wits to obtain a cab.”
“Don’t be absurd, John. It’s merely a matter of selecting high-quality paper and attending to the folds.” He looked disdainfully at the colourful bags in which many of their gifts had arrived (and which John had insisted they save for re-use).
“Just a few.” If the point of the umbrella had been an inch lower, he and his young mum would be in A & E and he would be facing something rather worse than a few stitches.
Day 8—Tuesday, 10:27 a.m.
“Only if I can see the body,” was the obnoxious and somehow eager response. “I’ll be positive, then.”
He didn’t object—didn’t actually react at all—when Victor wrapped one large hand around his thin wrist and pulled it down by his side. Then there was something tickling him—it brushed against his bare stomach and he squirmed a bit.
“Look at this one!” He held up his creation.
“What did he say?” he demanded sharply.
“Mixed up some records and some patient got the wrong medication. Sugar?”
pull yourself together
he reflected.
I have no idea what set him off—whether it was this comment or the setting sun or—it could have been anything—but the effect was horrifying.
“John, thank God you have returned! Your professional services are required immediately.” Sherlock’s voice rolled up the stairs and into the hall, where I had just dropped my walking stick into the stand.
“That makes no sense whatsoever,” he remarked, rising from the table.
“No, sir, it’s fine. We’re not going into the City today,” the sandy-haired man—Thomas—mumbled.
“What’s the matter, John? Can’t reach the top shelf?”
It took several minutes, with the black-suited man on one side and the gardener on the other, for them to walk slowly back to the house. Anthea followed close behind, texting the nursing agency. Mycroft had stridden ahead of them and, punching his entry code in angrily, stormed into the house. Clearly someone was going to be dismissed.
“Not one word,” Mr. Bloom echoed.
you could testify to the details of those sordid acts.”
The thin man glanced down at himself. “Charcoal grey and aubergine,” he replied haughtily.
My head aches and my chest is tight. It is painful to breathe. I sob—I do. I am not ashamed, here at least, to admit it. The only person who knows the depth of my sorrow is our dear Mrs. Hudson, and she has been strength and kindness and calm and sympathy personified these past three years. I am reminded, when I am at my darkest and she is gently rubbing my arm (proprieties be damned—yes she does come into our bedrooms), that she knows all. She lost not only her child but her husband to cholera. She knows the depth of my despair. She does not tell me these things directly, any more than she tells me that, having both a husband and a son, she is hardly alarmed by anything she might glimpse whilst tending to me (as she did with Sherlock, who was so very unconcerned with modesty in our homely rooms). But she sits on the side of my bed and rubs my arm and murmurs soft, meaningless words of comfort and sorrow. The words do not and cannot repair the rending of my heart, but their utterance ensures me that I should not be ashamed nor reticent. In her presence I can be and am honest.
“Not all homeless people are addicts, John.”
“Emily!”
“No, I could not. You are very important to me. You helped me over the lingering effects of my injuries from the war. You have reminded me that I am a doctor—and a good one—even if it is because you abuse yourself so terribly that I am forced to treat you. You and your rather ridiculous activities have launched me on a new path. You are so very important to me—I truly could not bear losing you.”
“Your plans…?” I encouraged.
“He must be moved into the other room and the window mended,” he stated, working to keep his voice steady. “Samuel, go!” The footman scurried out of the room, presumably to summon someone to attend to the broken glass.
There was someone else… damn. She cleaned and she made biscuits and she complained about his experiments. No. She liked it when he was “dashing about” and there was something about…
Well, the website was.
“It doesn’t really matter what it’s called when I’m the one doing the laundry. I’ve been feeding and caring for this man for years. I know what he likes and what he doesn’t like. I know what foods make him ill and which make him happy. I have already planned his next few meals, and I can assure you that not one of them will include rosemary chicken, mixed carrots and peas, and mashed potatoes with sautéed mushrooms. Tonight, he will be having Welsh rarebit and some apple slices. And a glass of milk. For afters I’ve made one of his favourites—chocolate mousse.
He headed towards a different part of town now.
of us? Are you mad?”
“No?” I was genuinely intrigued by his comment. “You do seem rather dedicated to maintaining the ‘status quo’ for your costume…”
Yes, tea would be nice, he thought. Nice, hot, sweet tea, and perhaps more of those biscuits… he belatedly realised that he had left the third tin open on the table. Guiltily, he brushed some of the crumbs he had left into a tidy pile before nodding once and dropping his head again. The sound of the kettle being filled and switched on made him feel, oddly, calm and sad at the same time.
Finally, the police arrived and Sherlock explained the situation (well, our agreed-to version of it) to them, and I was relieved beyond words when, as the sun rose, we were able to make our escape from the nightmarish house. We took Miss Stoner, who had been admirably steady as she was interviewed, to the morning train and escorted her to her aunt’s. Miss Stoner and Sherlock and I sat and discussed gypsies and cheetahs and wills and weddings until we reached the station.
He checked the bath water. “Your bath is almost ready. You’ll feel much better when you’re clean and warm and dry,” he told him. “Time to get all that muck off.”
“Yes, all of them.”
But it was all
“But I still eventually give in.” Silence. I continued. “It is the same with my desire for you, my sweet. Sometimes I am able to push those feelings aside, and sometimes they subside of their own volition, and sometimes they will not be refused.”
Greg had grown tired of delving into the seamier parts of London—they always smelt awful—to track down the maniac. Would he have felt differently if it was only for The Work, as Sherlock expressed it (you could actually

are not, but urges in general are. They are as natural as feeling hungry or sleepy. All right, perhaps that was not a good example for you… or perhaps it was. It is not that you do not feel hungry or tired. Your body does feel those things. Your body requires nourishment and rest. You just choose to ignore those feelings—or more precisely to suppress them for a time. It is the same for your more… base needs. You have just admitted that you felt those things, before we ever even knew each other—but you seemed to have ignored them or pushed them away somehow exactly as you do with feelings of hunger or exhaustion.”
Christopher had taken a short break from reading—heading to the kitchen for a glass of water—and Mycroft took a good look at his brother. He was still stretched out on the carpet and, at that moment, he appeared not just completely relaxed but so very much himself. If it weren’t for the healing gash, still-swollen, reddened eye, and scraped knuckles, he could be lying on the floor of the sitting room in Baker Street—
“And what did you intend to do about your responsibilities here at home?”
I was filled with gratitude. “Yes,” I agreed eagerly. “I sacrificed a great deal for Her Majesty.”
“She’s butch enough,” Mark, the marginally shorter and younger of the two, was also the quicker-witted. “Or so I hear.”
“Good.”
“I will not waste any time with niceties,” the elder brother announced, seating himself on one of the side chairs. As if in response to this, Sherlock thrust himself up from the settee and began his too-familiar pacing. I believe that I tried to hide my dismay at this. I doubt that I succeeded.
Did he? He wasn’t sure. He tried to remember… when was the last time he had gone? Where? Where had he been when his brother picked him up and dragged him here?
The nurse bustled into the room, carrying a dressing gown. “Dere you are! Slippery t’ing.” She shook her head, obviously more amused than concerned. “Put dis on.”
But who would do such a thing? Burglary was clearly not the purpose—as far as I knew. At least the client had not revealed that anything had gone missing from the house whilst I was in his presence.
“I cannot believe I am doing this,” Mrs Parker admitted, “but I’m ordering takeaway for everyone”
I must turn my attention away from him and focus on something else or he will drive me mad, and then won’t Mycroft have a handful?
“I think it would be worthwhile asking,” she suggested. “Go on.” She made a shooing motion.
“All right. Let’s get your books and get you out of here.”
Mycroft wandered into the library. He wanted to replay their dinner over and over in his mind, but he sensed that that would be a mistake. No sense in getting his hopes up about his brother’s state of mind. Yes, he had quite clearly recalled John Watson. Yes, it had been completely on his own; he had not led him on.
There were certainly witnesses to my uncouth behaviour in my club. Whilst the members of my former club might somewhat soften their descriptions of my behaviour during those months, there was no reason for them to deny it. I was boorish and sulky—nothing for me to be proud of, but hardly nefarious actions.
, or he
She was not completely illiterate, we had discovered. Well, Mrs Hudson had discovered. She knew her letters and could read some basic words; she could sign her name—something she apparently had learned by rote.
“You know that I enjoy new clothes. In fact, you have remarked more than once that my taste in clothing is faddish.”
Locked in. We have been locked in for four days now. Sherlock is currently attempting, on my request, to have a bit of a lie-down. He has not, as far as I can determine, slept more than sixteen hours total since we arrived—and that does not include his sleepless night before we departed from Baker Street, and despite his protestations that he is not tired, his body clearly knows better. He trembles now as he has all along, but now it is not solely in agitation. It is with exhaustion.
“Oh, John… really?” he sighed.
I wanted to protest on my friend’s behalf, but of course I could not—because it was true. I have not yet recorded the whole of our story, but since the first onset of this seizure, there have been numerous instances of violence towards Mycroft, towards the attendants and servants, towards myself, and, sadly, towards himself.
“Greg called earlier. He said thank you for the shirt and tie.”
It had been three fairly sleepless nights for both of us. I had risen quite sluggishly and dressed. I looked in on Sherlock then. He was lying on his side, with his back to the door. “Holmes?” I called out softly. I walked across the room and laid my hand on his shoulder, rolling him gently onto his back. His face was wet with tears; his eyes red.
“Poisons, huh? Mrs Parker won’t like hearing you refer to her cooking like that,” Christopher teased lightly, even though he felt anything but light-hearted. “Good job, Sherlock. Good talking,” he managed to add, keeping his voice calm.
I will be with him as much as possible, but as the older man pointed out, I do have to occasionally sleep, and I also might find it oppressive and disheartening to have to be constantly vigilant. Also, as the elder brother expressed it, despite our devoted companionship, I am not responsible for Sherlock, and although he truly appreciates my role as his brother’s doctor and friend (which nearly made me blush), he cannot expect me to bear the entire burden of his family’s affliction.
“I’s not that,” came the mumbled reply. “Just… tired, I suppose.”
, he moaned to anyone who would listen (and many more who wouldn’t)—a series of dreadful, noisy, crowded, tedious, loud, irritating, unnecessary days filled with ridiculous customs, unwanted sentimentality, horrid music, obscene amounts of food...
“No, I would not. I cannot. You know that. I am a proud subject of our queen, and far too fond of home and hearth to ever leave England again for any length of time.”
“Shut up, John,” he grumbled.
“I had to rather overextend myself,” he added, stretching his arm out. I ran my eyes down his lithe body. I took a deep breath in as I observed how very much tighter the front of his trousers was now; and he grinned wickedly as he observed that my own body was in a similar condition.
It took a while, and sometimes I wanted to laugh and sometimes I wanted to shout and sometimes I wanted to comfort him—he felt so dreadfully guilty and was clearly contrite. What he finally came out with was this: Helen (he could not remember her name, for which I did reproach him) had apparently come into our sitting room with the coal scuttle and various implements to rake out and re-lay our fire. She had not knocked—that was not his fault. It was also not his fault that at that very moment, he was reaching over the back of the settee to retrieve a cushion he had dislodged.
I have managed to sleep a bit and had some lunch. I called out to my friend and, although he did not open the door, his voice politely declining to join me for a meal was reassuring. I know that the door is not locked, but I respect that it is closed and do not wish to disturb him further.
He found what he was seeking, exited the building as unobtrusively as possible, then began the once-familiar circuitous route that would eventually lead him to what he sought.
But now, in the calm after the storm, I can state with honesty that I understand Mary’s actions when accosted by that odious woman in the theatre lobby. As soon as she realised that she could not deny her identity, what bravery she demonstrated by being so forthright!  I am also certain that her honesty with Mrs. Bloom would not ever have been offered had she the slightest hint of what the woman would do with the information.
He sighed, the burden of Atlas on his shoulders. “Ah… no. My sister somehow got a hold of some… they think it was what they used to control the rats… she took her own life, sir.”
Damn…

“What in heaven’s name did you
aspects of the behaviour he was presenting. She had noted the comments on the clipboard and found them fascinating. That was all it was, really.
“That is hardly a healthy diet,” the nurse retorted, pursing her lips.
I did not receive a response of any sort. Manners be damned—I opened the door unbidden. Sherlock was sitting at his dressing table (being in his bedroom was still a bit of a novelty at that point—I am not certain what fascinated me more—the portraits of criminals that lined the walls or the theatrical make-up and paraphernalia that covered his dressing table), his elbows on the table and his face in his hands. He did not flinch or indicate in any way that he was aware of my entrance. That was enough to propel me across the room (his dressing table was, as it is still now, tucked behind his bed) and next to him.
We had had a long morning.
“Thank you,” she murmured quietly, arranging her skirt around her. “Now,” she instructed, “go fetch pencil and paper from my sitting room. We must compose an advertisement.”
“It’s always surprised me—that tatty thing. I would have expected you to already have some fabulous set.”
Now that we are to one another—what we are—I look back at this period with some astonishment. It was so very early in our friendship—we were really barely acquainted in some ways—but tending to Sherlock when these horrible moods struck him was something that I never once considered a burden or an imposition. As with his headaches, I understood that he was not able to control them, and although I could not truly treat them as I did his poor head, I do believe that I was a comfort.
“I t’ink a lovely hot bath would be a good idea,” she commented. He looked down at himself and nodded sombrely, thoughtfully licking a few fingers. “Come on, then. Mr Holmes, you all right?” The government man had been completely silent since the younger man had (not terribly gently) pushed his plate back in front of him. He had eaten, mechanically, somehow clearing the plate without taking his eyes off his brother for even a second.
