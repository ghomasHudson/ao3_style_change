Dean shook his head, moving another step towards Castiel, his eyes flickering down to his mouth just once, then back up like someone had thrown the lighter in with the whole bucket of fuel.
‘I know,’ Cas looked at him with heavy eyes. ‘Besides, nothing went to plan and I couldn’t even find Kelly.’ The breath in his lungs felt sticky, the weight of his opening up visible in the way Dean held himself as he listened. ‘I’ve never experienced love until I met you,' he continued, 'and I'm not very good at it.’
He looked over, a slight stinging at how quickly the Nephilim had pierced through the moment, then turned to Dean. The energy between them raw as Dean lingered his gaze. This was too important, Cas wanted to ask Jack to give them a few minutes; craving more, extra enlightenment. Before he could find a response, the hunter already gave one.
‘Oh, obviously. I mean, you’re not even angry, then you go and high-tail it outta here after-’ He gritted his teeth, his head shaking. ‘What the hell is wrong with you? That's 20 miles out from okay.’ Exasperated at the situation, Dean could feel his arms and legs getting shaky.
‘Damnit, Cas.’ Dean said quietly. ‘Sit down, I’ll show you what I mean.’ He stood up, a quick tug on the hem of his shirt and ushering Cas to take his seat which he obediently did.
The muscles in Dean’s thighs clenched and Cas stopped to knock his jacket off, pushing the dark green Henley that matched his eyes so beautifully over his head. He kissed the freckles around his shoulders as they grinded, desperately hunting friction, then Cas kissed a few scars scattered along his upper arms and across his chest. Some were recognisable from fighting wars together but others a relic of a time without him. He felt the pain in the race of his heart and looked at him, ‘You deserve so much more than I can give you, Dean.’
As Dean apologised and asked him to forget what had happened, a renewed sense of love filled Cas only to be tarnished by desire. He'd tasted something he didn’t realise he wanted so badly and contemplated asking for an explanation, to remind him that he had feelings too and capacity for upset, but seeing the panic gripping and flooding out of the hunter changed his mind. Whatever had happened, Dean clearly wished it hadn’t.
Cas stood still, the spoon rising out of the bowl like a flag and one of his sleeves falling towards his wrist. His eyes slanting with dejection.
As Dean stepped in behind him, Cas manoeuvred to let his legs stretch out but it was cramped. They had connected in ways Cas had never considered, he'd been rooted inside him to lay claim without regret. But this felt more exposed than pinning the hunter’s hands above his head, making the bed writhe and cry with their frantic need for each other.
The angel reached over to hug him. Dean kept some space before allowing his arms to lay fully against Cas’s body, pulling him tight as Cas’s chin rested softly on his shoulder. He let himself breathe the angel in.
‘Dean,’ Cas said straightforwardly as he opened the bottle. ‘Whatever you do in the privacy of your own car is none of my business.’ He took a large pump, stroking some over his cock then moving between Dean’s legs to slick the ring of muscle, understanding this is what Dean was asking for.
, what the hell was that? Dean couldn’t unpack it. Getting Cas back should’ve made things clearer, not pushed him more out of whack. He groaned, moving his head into his hands as he sank into a chair, feeling his eyes sting with tears. Did he really say
‘Sometimes, yeah, but…’ Sam took a shallow breath and moved collective strands of hair behind his ear. ‘…But Cas, avoiding it? That's not living, that's not even helpful! It's just pretending not to care.’
Dean sat up with a wince, exhaling it away and looking at each other as if they were suddenly in full colour. He rolled his lip then rubbed a free hand across his face. ‘Yeah, man.’ He glanced at their hands clinging together and paused for a beat. ‘...Cas, I-’
Dean forced a smile, letting his eyes wander to Cas who raised his blue gaze once before looking away. ‘Yeah, I get it.’ Dean replied, making every effort to take out the bitter taste he was feeling towards the angel.
Dean tried to think of the best way to phrase it, unable to stop himself from looking at Cas’s lips. They were so interesting, the shape, the fill of them. He blinked and drew up to find Cas watching, head angled to the side.
Tiny droplets of rain fell from Dean's hair and into his eyes as he listened with every ounce of intent he had. The ground felt to be spiralling under him, like he'd stepped out of Baby after a 12 hour road trip. 'All these years?'
Dean pushed a gulp down and rolled his lips, squeezing them for a second before releasing and turning to look at the angel. He noticed Cas squirming slightly and without hesitation his hand fell onto his knee to comfort him. ‘Talk to me.’
The angel turned to face him, he looked a little broken but unharmed, his blue eyes wet and his mouth closed. He stood up to greet them, cracking a smile. ‘Sam, Eileen...’
Only the head of Cas' cock was inside Dean but it broke him, wanting to make some remark at Dean’s actions but lost in his tight heat. He had lived for eons but only now did he know why sex had felt so empty before. Dean. Nobody else had been Dean. Cas started making shallow thrusts as Dean opened more, kissing him as he slid in so well, so beautifully, like they were made to do this. Supporting himself with his arms above Dean's shoulders, he broke their lips apart and watched Dean as he moved, each time deepening into him and seeing new expressions on his face. Dean tried to wrap his legs around Cas as much as they could fit in the small space. The rhythm was the opposite of everything they’d experienced together and that took Cas' breath away. It was gentle and slow, not the fiery rage of trying to win an apocalypse with the odds stacked against them. It felt like they were both alive for the first time as his cock became snug inside the person he cared about most.
‘You said it yourself last night, familial love isn’t being in love. I never once thought that you meant anything more.’ Cas stood up and walked over to him. Dean’s temples knotted together as he listened. Nothing was making sense. Cas wrapped his hand around Dean’s shoulder. ‘Here.’
, and he saw Dean looking at him, waiting. He walked towards the bed, pulling a tape out of his trenchcoat with a sigh as he sat down and held it to Dean.
‘I’m sorry, Dean,’ –Cas reappeared at his side, exchanging heartfelt glances between the hunter and the closed laptop- ‘I wanted to help and that website you had open suggested it.’
The words were lighter than he expected them to be and he studied Cas like a tapestry, waiting to see either confusion or understanding. Cas didn’t say anything at first, until a few seconds later a smile spread across and opened his face up.
‘Get those in the oven, Cas. If there ain’t a cookie to have with my beer tonight… you and I got a problem.’
Then the dude in a trenchcoat had to go and drop the L bomb. Leaving Dean staring like a lovesick teenager at the mixtape he'd made in response. He pulled a hand down his jaw before taking a drink, the whiskey tasting sharper than normal as it landed on his nerves.
Dean moved his hand off the angel, suddenly feeling like he was sat on shards of glass. ‘I don’t know, romantically I guess...’ He peeked at Cas, looking away quickly when he met his eyes.
But Cas didn’t, reaching to touch Dean’s patient cock between them, ‘No, actually I thought I might stay here a while.’
Everything made the angel breathe that bit deeper and push further into his sit bones. For once, it felt safe, like nothing could get through the bunker to reach them. He let his back rest against the wall, taking his shoes off because Dean wouldn’t want them on the bed,
Dean turned onto his side to face the angel, his breathing back to normal and muscles relaxing. ‘No, but it wasn’t Heaven, Cas. It was more like some kind of messed up reality.’
Castiel pulled himself back, both hands now holding onto Dean’s neck; his thumb resting in the dimple of his stubbled cheek. Dean braced himself as he caught the heat in his eyes, the fireworks in his belly still exploding with thunder.
Dean gave a small glance towards his brother to get a feel for where his head was at, his face was calm – relaxed even. ‘What do they want from us?’ He asked, eyebrows pressing down as he turned back to Cas.
‘But before that, what with The Mark and Crowley; it ain’t been all peaches and cream’ -he dragged a long breath into his chest, puffing himself up-  ‘I can’t make all that go away... What I can do is remind you that this is your home too, y'know, if you want it to be.’
‘Dean…you still need sleep,’ He mumbled. Squeezing his hand on Dean's thigh and enjoying the tingles as the hunter held his jaw and kissed down his neck.
Dean re-opened his eyes, hoping Cas hadn’t noticed they’d been shut. The angel refocused to the other side, deliberately making patterns with his hands. Dean tensed under the touch, parting his lips to let a whisper of air escape. Breathing slow as nerves tingled in agreement.
And he was enjoying spending time with Dean like this, naked and their heat sticking to him like a film he couldn't peel off. He knew that the respective burdens they carried were dropped onto the ground as soon as skin met skin.
‘Exactly.' Paper thin creases grew from the corners of his eyes as he clapped Cas on the shoulder, tip of the bottle pressed against his lips as he spoke, ‘Home sweet bunker.’
Dean looked at his stomach covered in sticky, hardening come then tipped his mouth upside down, ‘Sure, you can help with that one as well.’ He smirked, Sam’s voice calling his name through the phone.
The first time a song reminded Dean of Castiel, he'd ignored it. They were facing an apocalypse and Cas was a soldier with eyes full of fire and the power of Heaven therein, sending shivers down the hunter's spine. A celestial being that had
‘Okay, well, how’s it feel if it’s not feeling weird?’ He smoothed his palms softly onto Cas’s shoulder blades and made his way lower. Copying more movements that the angel had given. He trailed all the way down and stroked out to the sides. Dean raised his eyebrows at how firm the muscle above the hips were before his fingers reached a waistband.
Dean woke up surrounded by darkness, fumbling onto his nightstand for the phone he always kept there and checking the time. 1.23AM. His eyes tried to find some light, searching for Castiel next to him. ‘Cas?’ Aware that he’d allowed himself to fall asleep on the angel’s shoulder, he shook off the
Cas entered the kitchen with the flick of a light switch. The room sprang to life, empty beer bottles cascaded around the sink like torpedoes and there was a faint smell of bacon from the grill. Dean had been in here, probably not too long ago.
‘Of course. We discussed it with her but the memory can be a complicated thing. She might not remember all of Heaven.’ A silence fell on them, Cas studying as Dean processed it.
Taking the opportunity for 5 minutes alone to box up his feelings, Dean bundled his jeans, black t-shirt and denim shirt into his arms and locked himself in the bathroom. Re-emerging to find Cas already out of the tub, dressed, and pulling his black jacket on.
, before he realised Cas hadn’t spoken in a few moments. Sheepishly turning to the angel expecting judgement but Cas’s eyes were blown wide. Pupils pushing the blue almost off the whole map.
Rowena’s face fractured a moment with Sam’s words. It was painted on her as vividly as her lipstick that she thought it was their doing.
‘We’re trying to find a way to rescue Cas.’ Sam had so much hope in his voice, the sweetness made him nauseous and Dean turned away.
Somewhere in the distance, the track switched and encouraged Dean to drag his hand under Cas’s shirt. Touching the hollow of his back, the skin soft and new, Dean flattened his palm between the angel’s shoulder blades. Continuing to kiss hungrily, Dean wanted his neck and took it, Cas blessing him with a noise that was too close to a moan to be anything else.
'It's not your problem right now.' They both held themselves strong, laying on the bed under the blanket and staring into the other's eyes in battle.
‘No. She is in heaven with him though, he’s rebuilding it or some other rubbish, good for him ay? But apparently someone vanished on their watch, Charlie?’
Steam soaked into his skin, the heated vibrations against his body drawing out a small moan of indulgence. It felt good, hell it felt more than good. Just beer, the open night sky, and a freakin’ hot tub.
‘Cas?’ Dean thumbed up the angel’s shirt, his face fixed with concern, searching for newly opened lacerations or black ooze.
‘It just came over me, Cas.’ He tapped the edge of the glass, resting his gaze on the lamp between them. ‘It-it just felt right. I know that sounds bad-’
If Dean had concerns, he discarded them to the floor of Baby along with his jeans and underwear. He held Cas' face and kissed him.
Footsteps echoed into the room, interrupting. Then a loud cough. They both turned to see Sam; hair knotted, pyjama shirt hanging loose over sweats, eyes half open. Dean dropped his hands, moving to the side of Cas. He morphed into a grin of
Resuming movement with a kiss, they entwined their fingers into the bed, trying to keep them locked together as frantic energy swept back into their bodies. The tape played to the end as Castiel’s eyes lit up and Dean watched for the first time as the angel’s knuckles turned white.
‘Alright, Dr Phil. Enough.’ Dean pushed himself to his feet, the taste of last night’s whiskey rattling at the back of his throat.
in the air as Cas walked up to him, wanting to help but understanding his presence would distress him more. Instead, with a touch against the forehead, Cas sent him back inside to do whatever was needed to forget.
‘Time for what?! For Amara to hurt everyone I care about? For her to destroy the whole world? Take me with her as some cosmic partner-in-death?! No, not on my watch.’
‘It bothers me that you’d question what I said to you when I summoned the Empty. Yes, I wanted to save you and I wanted you to go and save the world, but I said all that to you because it was the truth.’
The tension in Cas’ body snapped back into place like elastic, ‘Dean, I can’t forget this.’ He slipped out from his grip, arching his back to turn off the faucet with a scratching of metal
‘Lay down.’ Dean said, his voice thick with sleep. He’d moved slightly but Cas wasn’t able to tell how conscious he was. ‘Cas. Lay down.’
‘I want it to be a place where everyone gets what they deserve, anything they want or what they’ve fought for, they can have it.’ He told them.
‘Dean?’ Cas's voice was broken, stopping their lips from meeting. Dean opened his eyes to see the blue of the angel’s iris filling near enough his entire vision.
‘I just mean that you should relax.’ He moved a small radio cassette player onto the bedside table and pressed play, the quiet rock of Led Zeppelin cocooning them.
Surprised to hear the response from his brother, Dean viewed him with knowing reluctance; they'd been down this road before. The pressure in his temples eased as he returned to Cas. ‘Nothing?’
‘Exactly! He’s back and he hasn’t even-’ Dean broke off to catch himself, he wasn’t going to unravel about this here. He softly shook his brother’s hand away. ‘I’ve spent weeks thinking he died because of me, that I didn’t feel what he did, and now I find out he’s actually alive. If he’d meant it, if he felt that, why isn’t he here?’
Dean looked at his brother, feeling as though his face had broken in two. ‘Cas…what happened with him.’ His voice was low and discreet. ‘His deal. The Empty would only take him when he was happy-’ Dean took a moment. He didn’t fear Sam’s judgement but putting Castiel's vulnerability out there, along with his own, didn’t sit right with him.
He noticed Castiel sat by the table in the library, two warm lamps lighting up his profile and gulped. Making a choice to deal with the angel, Dean walked to the drinks cart and poured a whiskey. ‘Cas.’ He acknowledged. ‘Where’s Jack?’
When Dean stirred awake, an ache throughout his arm greeted him. Falling asleep on his stomach had its consequences. He groaned, opening his eyes to see a figure placing a glass of water next to him and sitting in the chair.
The whiskey that Dean had poured cascaded down his throat with a burn, and he stared at the now vacant glass. Footsteps scraped along the kitchen floor and he looked up to see Sam walking towards him and sitting down, opening his chest up as if readying himself for something.
The guilt and responsibility throbbed thick in the hunter’s veins, Cas wished Dean could understand that the only forgiveness he didn’t have was his own. ‘None of what happened was your fault, Dean,’ he said, a gentle slope on his brow.
He had no plan for his feet as they carried him along the bunker’s hard corridors but he stopped at the kitchen. Darkness licked the room and Cas tilted his head, catching a radio sat on the counter with a collection of tapes nestled to it.
‘Look, we’ll get out of here, throw a movie on or something… Beers, blanket… We can forget this whole thing ever happened.’ He piled the hope high into his voice.
Cas squinted, focusing on the lips which had just been pressed against his own before looking back into the hunter's eyes. ‘I put it on the bed when you were in the kitchen talking to Sam…’
was quickly forgotten as Dean rolled his eyes, a mishap that he’d never expected to happen from sharing a laptop with an angelic being.
The grimace from Cas’ mouth knocked Dean to his haunches and he lifted the ratty shirt up. His touch made the angel grunt and Dean arched his eyebrows, ‘It’s fine, huh?’
‘This felt so real, Cas. Me and Sam were fighting these vampires, one of them freaking threw me onto… I don’t know, a rusty nail or something. I felt it go right through me-’ Dean touched around his back, his face crinkling at the same time; Cas moved his own fingers on top, helping him feel how perfectly whole he was.
The floor felt light as he moved slow towards the library, his body heavy and fatigued; he thought about snuggling up to Eileen. He was really starting to get used to the scent of her on their pillows, enticing but comforting, he smiled to himself as he approached the entrance.
‘Probably wise.’ Dean nodded, raising his eyebrows at Cas with a flush on his cheeks. ‘So, when you said the one thing you wanted but couldn’t have, you honest-to-God meant me? Being
In Dean's bedroom, Castiel moved from between his legs and rested against the pillows propped along the wall. Despite taking their relationship to a new experience in the impala, Cas hadn't expected more. They'd expressed what they needed to that night. What more was left to say? After the apocalypse was averted, they'd carried on watching movies, arguing over how ridiculous the plots were, and Dean made jokes that Cas wasn't appreciating like he was meant to. Things were normal.
He frowned into his coffee, torturing himself with thoughts buried underneath the bottles of whiskey he’d been drinking up like water. What if Cas had gone out thinking that he hadn't wanted to hear any of it?
A run-of-the-mill case had been a nice change of pace for he and Sam. It’d been a rough couple of weeks; their Mom alive and wanting to spend time alone; Cas almost dying; Lucifer back and creating a Nephilim, which Dean just knew was going to bite them on the ass. So, when half-eaten bodies started popping up at a hospital 90 miles from the bunker, Dean had jumped on it. Firing down the highway until they reached the only place to stay in the small, unsettling town: a beaten-up motel that obviously harboured dreams of being more. It had one redeeming feature, a small patio with a hot tub.
‘No, that's not...’ Cas moved with a loud footing, his jaw giving it away that he’d started clenching his teeth together. ‘
‘That a massage isn’t something you just give anyone,’ Dean replied. Not stopping to think first, focusing entirely on rotating his hands across Cas’s back. So far, a success, he was managing to do this without any spasms from the injured arm. He applied more pressure to get through the material of Cas’s coat.
‘I don’t know,’ Dean interrupted. ‘…Felt right? You almost died? You’re still hurt? Pick a poison.’ He pushed his head against the wall and hoped it might envelop him.
He finished his coffee and looked at the bottle of whiskey, wondering if he should pour one. He unscrewed the top when his phone rang, the name Donna flashing up.
‘Yeah, if you want to... The duffel on the table,' -Dean pointed into the room- 'There should be an extra pair of shorts in there.’ He offered Cas a smile and the angel widened his eyes.
Everything felt thick and sticky as he took a shallow breath and maintained their shared expression, his mouth parted. He was hot but goosebumps ran down his arms.
‘What are you doing up? You look like hell.' Sam saw his brother in the same room he’d left him in 6 hours earlier, glass in hand and feet up on the table. The energy was loud, something had happened.
The angel felt every syllable, locking his face tight as he tried to swallow the lump that had bounced up from his chest. He wanted to look at him but Dean finished the pattern of kisses down to his shoulder, then rested his head against Cas’. The quietness suffocating them both.
‘And I’m happy just watching movies with you, man. Scooby Doo marathons, drinking beer, eating burgers, driving along with some good music and you riding shotgun. Wind in our hair, you know?’
Cas examined the mixture across his body then regarded Dean with a quietness. The heat radiating from his eyes was enough to compete with the oven, Dean could feel the embers as Cas offered him a smile.
Castiel had told Sam and Dean the truth: he’d received word from someone in Heaven regarding information on The Darkness. He had and they needed to know what they were up against, so the decision to take off was easily made. What he hadn't expected was finding himself face to face with black eyes. Whether it was an intentional set up or by chance, she revelled in the fight with him.
Hearing the orgasm rip out of Dean was the most beautiful sound he could imagine, enough to trigger his own and he shot upright as his hips bucked. His cock shooting inside him as he pumped another wave of come out of Dean; landing below his freckled collarbone. 'Oh God, Dean...' Drunk on the sensations, the image of it all below him, his body was attacked by shudders.
Cas was ready to let any words tumble out, no thought needed, just something to break the heat growing inside him when he heard footsteps.
‘We’re going to give you guys some privacy. Please, talk and listen to each other,’ Sam said. He held out his hand for Eileen and they headed back towards the kitchen. Sam turning around one last time. ‘It’s really good to have you back, Cas.’
He closed the door and turned around to find the angel waiting for direction, and damn, if seeing him like that didn’t send Dean into an immediate flashback. Crappy motels, asking Cas if he wanted to stay and watch something with him and Sam. It was so long ago but not much felt to have changed, not really. ‘Grab a beer,’ He suggested.
Rowena looked over, her eyebrows as high as her hair and her mouth wide. ‘Moi? No, I’ve more pressing matters in Hell to deal with than that. I came to see if you’d been up to your usual mischief and mayhem?’
‘Cas, don’t.' He felt the angel shiver as he laid a hand around his shoulder. 'No Kelly, no Mom, no…
. Go back to thinking angels don't get it, and bury the whole freakin' night with every other moment that ended with Sam asking,
‘Hey, I’m not going anywhere. You’re in my room, pal...’ He offered a smile to accompany his attempt at a joke, but Cas closed his eyes in discomfort. ‘Okay, come here…’ Dean rested his back against the wall and snaked his arm around Cas without doubt.
A blush flew across the angel’s face and Dean followed Cas’s gaze into the night sky with arched eyebrows.
Cas noticed, his jaw flexing but refusing to meet him. ‘I’m sorry Dean, I didn’t think I needed to.’
His concern dissipated when Cas gave him a warm smile, his face opening up and his azure eyes alive. ‘Whilst you were asleep, I heard from Jack.’
‘What kind of deal was it? Maybe we can figure something out.’ The way his brother looked at him so sad and confused was almost as painful as when Billie had squeezed his heart with her fingers, Cas holding him and carrying him away. Protecting him.
'Stay? You mean here? All night?' He looked at Dean, blinking slow to hide the fact that the idea was very appealing. They'd been intimate enough for Cas to know which buttons he liked being pressed but he still always left. Eventually.
Watching Castiel get into the hot tub was something else. Ripples of confusion tightened the angel’s eyes into a crease as he dipped his feet into the water. He looked at Dean as he immersed himself up to the waist. Small bubbles trailing and kissing those hipbones, eating him up until he was nothing but neck and shoulders above a fizzy splash.
Dean swallowed with the sensation, probably loud enough for the whole neighbourhood to hear but he didn’t care. What was Cas doing? Dean only knew why he would do it.
‘What do you want from me, man? For me to ask you not to leave? Okay, I’m asking you, Cas, not to leave. Just freakin’
Dean answered the question with a rumble from his throat, fluttering his eyes closed as Cas turned his head and stroked up his wrist. ‘Son of a-’
Cas sighed, touching a finger to Dean’s forehead and disappearing all traces of their sex resting above his belly button, ‘That's beside the point. You don’t think it’s wise to make sure Sam doesn’t hear?’
.’ Dean swallowed hard. Failing himself, he felt the familiar sensation of a tear rolling down his cheek.
The angel looks at him, he’s wearing this dumbass trenchcoat and his hair... dude looks like he just got nailed.’
Castiel looked at Dean asleep next to him, after two back-to-back movies he'd fallen further into the bed. His head pressing against the angel’s arm felt mildly uncomfortable but Cas wouldn’t move. Regarding him in his entirety, this man who had saved the world more times than any other human, losing so much of his own life to prioritise others, Cas shook his head in sorrow. Sometimes it'd been hard for him to understand why Dean fought for the world or how he’d kept grinding, supporting his brother wholly and completely no matter what problem lay ahead. Then he’d realised, that was exactly why he loved him. The screen of the laptop was black and Cas caught the faint reflection of them both together. For a brief moment, he closed his eyes and wanted to rest his head against Dean’s, but he wasn’t going to be so invasive. He leant against the headboard instead when he heard Dean grunting.
‘Cas,’ Dean searched for additional words, too lost in the blue of the eyes approaching him. Looking at Cas's lips and thinking how bad he wanted to kiss him, he was on fire as the angel stopped in front of him. Personal space gone, just as it always had. He cleared his throat. ‘If you thought you couldn’t have me, you could not have been more wrong. Grace or no grace, angel crap or no angel crap; I want to do this.’
‘Yeah, of course. No, I’m fine. I’ll be ready.’ He told Sam, squeezing the phone in frustration as his brother hung up.
Eyes resting shut again, Dean felt his sit bones push into the chair as he relaxed into what Cas was doing. Enjoying the pleasant and faint taste of comfort. ‘Gee thanks, Cas.’ He replied in a wispy voice. Stifling a groan of pleasure as Cas started long drives down. The last thing he wanted was to start making noises at the same freakin’ time as everything else going on right now, that would be all kinds of inappropriate.
The music began, and Dean watched Cas place the radio on the bedside table. He turned his lips upside down in curiosity, ‘You like Zepp, huh?’
‘Well, that is something you’ve experienced, it’s perfectly natural that you’d sometimes dream about it. But with Rowena and Jack working together, I don’t think you’ll be hunting anytime soon.’
Dean spun on the heel of his boot, looking around the kitchen. ‘Cas?’ Their shared moment lost as he grappled with finding himself back in the bunker, the angel nowhere to be seen. ‘Cas?!’ He went into the library but vacant chairs and low lighting confessed that was empty too.
Castiel narrowed his eyes and raised his head, ‘Dean...?’ A jumble of disbelief and uncertainty travelling over his face. ‘Why did you-?’
‘I can’t believe you’re here.' Eileen strolled up and sat next to him, putting her hand on his shoulder gently.
‘Fuck, Cas…’ Dean groaned, his hand moving away to tighten into the back of the passenger seat; the crinkle of leather as he dug his hands into it. ‘Who taught you to talk like that?’
Sam held his breath, willing his brother to reciprocate but instead there was silence. He decided the phone would have to spend the night without him and left to fall into bed with Eileen, the echoes of their conversation rotating inside his head. He never thought he’d hear it from either of them, maybe they really were finally free.
‘…Alright.’ With a look of apprehension, Cas avoided eye contact as he started removing his trenchcoat and disappeared into the room.
‘Exactly. I thought of all the times I sat up worried about you; upset, pissed about some dumbass thing you’d done. But mostly, I thought of all the times we watched movies, went for a drive; when I’d fall asleep and find you still sitting here like it was nothing. All the times you took a bullet for me, for Sam, for Jack. I wanted to go back to that night and tell myself,
It opened but the rage written across Dean’s temple was undeniable. ‘You’re sorry?’ His hand tightened around the handle. ‘You go dark on us for weeks and all that time you were here. Not returning calls,
‘Cas,’ Dean gave him dead eyes. ‘Is that… why is the blanket here? Did we… Did we just bone on the movie watching blanket?’
As Dean left the room, Castiel observed. He always held himself strong but his shirt rested against the curvature of his back, fitting him perfectly. Nerves became tremors, the angel’s body remembering the feel of Dean’s stomach and thighs pressing against him, hot and steady. Did that really happen? He quickly turned to Jack, who had quietly taken the hunter’s seat and sat clutching a pack of cards in his hands. The Nephilim watched him, his hands still.
Excitement, relief; all of it filled Sam’s senses up to the brim. Dean’s win was sitting right here, at last. Maybe now he would stop starting the day with breakfast beers or leaving his socks around the bunker. Sam shook his head, ‘You should’ve told us.’
Dean observed him, scanning for signs that he was confused or a realisation that he’d chosen the wrong words, but Cas just kept his eyes on him. Fixed into place like the walls in his bedroom.
‘It’s just human anatomy, Dean. Targeting the source of the pain, stretching the muscle to help it loosen, increasing blood flow…’
Dean was caught between a noise that Cas was pulling from his dick, or a grumble at being denied what he wanted. ‘Alright,’ he finally said in a heavy breath. ‘If that’s how you wanna play it.’
‘Okay, Cas, that’s enough.’ Dean gently rocked himself forwards, causing Cas to lose touch whilst he covered himself with an arm. ‘I appreciate what you’re doing… but-’
Dean looked at Sam to see his face deadly serious. He relaxed his own and nodded in agreement with himself.
Cas's lips were fluffed up and pink as he spoke and a small breath escaped from Dean, followed by a lump in his throat. Hesitantly, he raised a thumb to Cas’s stubbled cheekbone and wiped off a sprinkling of flour and dough, feeling Cas tighten under his touch.
Dean walked towards him, deepening the lines between his eyes and wiggling a pointed finger at Cas’ stomach, ‘How’s the, uh…?’
Dean went long and slow with his tongue, stopping to rest Cas’ cock against his mouth with no mercy for the pre-come trailing to meet his lips. He moved to take another suck before Cas held onto his shoulder and pulled him up.
‘Why didn’t he tell us?’ Sam shivered with frustration, his face metamorphosing into a puppy dog as he struggled to comprehend. ‘Well, deals can be broken Dean, we’ve both broken our fair share.’
Steering Cas into his bedroom, Dean let his bag fall to the floor and closed the door. His face softened as he poured fingers over the angel’s trenchcoat. ‘That lance really did a number on you,’ he said, examining blood stains embedded into Cas’s shirt with a grimace.
Thanks to Misha for top!Cas truthing at the exact moment I was in the middle of writing this. What an experience.
His breath wrapping itself into his chest like a kite, Dean unscrambled it quickly. Breathing his response, barely audible but loud enough for them both to hear.
‘Alright, you can drop it. I just needed some air-’ He took a drink. ‘What are even doing here, man?’
He frowned as his vision focused, confused as to why Sam was his wake-up call. ‘What’s wrong? Something happen?’
Dean's initial anger dispersed as Cas moved his soft eyes into his and lingered heavily. He had wanted to see Cas for weeks and now here he was, this was his moment. His hand palmed over his face and he glanced into the room. Sat in his jacket was everything he’d been wanting to say since that night, since the first time he heard Cas say
‘Cas, don’t. Don’t try and give me some reason because there isn’t one.’ He moved closer to the angel, causing Cas to catch his breath for a moment. The man was just as beautiful as the day he pulled him out of Hell, age and wars had barely left their trace on him.
‘I don’t know, this is pretty awesome.’ Dean looked at him, lighting the car on fire with his moan that followed.
asked me to do, because that's how much I love you! But you've been on some self-deprecating mission to prove yourself right ever since I got back from the Empty-'
Castiel watched Dean as he sat down on the bed, sensing the confusion ratting inside but he didn’t know how to make it better. He moved carefully to the desk chair and sat across from him.
Dean felt his heart sinking as he said it. Uncertainty over their friendship turned from a hum into a scream inside his head. He raked his gaze away, refusing to look at the angel as he shook his head, wetness in his eyes trying to run out onto his face. He didn't let it, moving out of the room with the echo of his boots loud.
He blinked in succession at Castiel, sleeves rolled up and forearms lost in a cream, ceramic mixing bowl.
‘Yeah, of course.’ He replied instead, shrugging his shoulders to shake the contemplations away and sipping from his coffee. ‘How’s Eileen doing?’
It's been a tough week as a destiel shipper, I've been in a bit of a sad mood with it all but finally managed to finish this chapter and the epilogue. I hope you like it and I'm happy to hear any feedback.
Dean tipped the bottle of beer into his mouth, emptying his head of thoughts as hot bubbles of water nibbled his body.
Dean held his hand over his mouth for a second, checking Cas then shaking his head. ‘Well, that wasn’t awkward.’
Breathing in with frustration and then out with acceptance, Dean shook his head. ‘Yeah, and so do you. It’s not one or the other.’
‘Dean, no…’ He looked at Dean in plea, his blue eyes dimmed and drooped with lethargy as the shuddering became a slow wave through his body. 'I don't want t-to be alone.'
‘I wasn’t sure you’d want to see me, Dean, all those things I said to you… I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable.’
'Besides, you love the noises,' Dean reached for the bed cover, pulling a face at the come he'd forgotten about.
Dean tightened his jaw, pressing his lips together and hesitating. He dragged a hand down his face, then softly touched Cas’ back. ‘If I make anything feel worse...’
Halfway into that first beer, after they've toasted to a job well done, Dean was going to give him the tape to say thanks. To say,
They exchanged a knowing look, an exhilarating aftertaste of sugar, butter, and cinnamon. Dean swallowed his nerves; the worry that Cas was too celestial to understand.
‘It’s now years later from that first night...’ Dean looks at him. ‘Eight years later. They both know exactly what’s going on. The hunter is happy, for once in his life he has everything he needs, and the angel says-’
Dean bit onto his lip before finishing the whiskey in his glass. 'I think you know what I'm saying.'
Sam accepted his apology immediately; he knew that this went deeper than Cas flying off and not thinking twice about the repercussions of his actions. ‘Have you spoken to Dean?’
Their gaze met, Dean watching him with ferocity. Unable to believe that he’d shared a kiss with this person, this being, who had pulled the fastest 180 he'd ever witnessed. ‘Yeah, you know what, Cas? Maybe you should go.’ He bit back, dividing the anger up equally.
A warm feeling of relief washed over Cas and he involuntarily smiled. ‘So did I. When I was in the Empty I was living through these dreams. Well, they were more like nightmares.’
‘I told you that night, I know that what I want isn’t something I can have. I know that. I didn’t want you to think I expected anything from you, I don’t. That’s not why I told you those things. I knew you could save the world and I wanted you to see yourself fully in order to do just that.’
They got stuck in each other’s eyes and if there was a joke in Dean’s comment then Cas couldn’t find it, ‘You are often tense, maybe that would help.’
‘Dean, Cas, I’m only gonna say this once: don't mess this up.’ Sam's voice was sharp before the steady drag of classic rock started.
‘He’s trying to create a world where you and your brother, Eileen, hunters everywhere, can finally be at peace. Jack isn’t going to drag you into this.’
Through his flannel, Dean felt the build-up of heat from Cas’s fingers as they drew into the muscles. Cas sprawled his hands, stroking outwards until he was around the hunter's hips. Cracking his eyes open low, Dean watched the angel skim across his abdomen. Dangerously close to feeling more of Dean than he probably expected.
They sat in silence, Dean spitting out each word his brother said. There had to be another explanation.
Cas tried, softening and allowing Dean to support some of his weight as he relaxed the muscles in his back. Sitting in what he thought could only be called a cocoon, he replayed it. The
‘Cas, where did you learn to do this?’ Dean cursed his shattered voice, divulging how effected he was becoming.
He felt the weight of Dean’s head lift and noticed that, still with his eyes closed, Dean was waiting. Cas slid himself down the bed and let his head find the pillow. As he shuffled himself gently to get comfier, the weight of Dean returned as he placed himself on his shoulder. Castiel tried to breathe as silently as possible but his chest was pounding. Feeling Dean's body so close to him, more intimate than they’d ever been before. His arms were pencils straight down his side and he looked for a distraction; focusing on the lamp next to the bed, illuminating corners that Cas had never really given a second glance to. He noticed photos but couldn’t make out what they were of, a red plaid shirt carefully draped across a chair, and a couple of empty beer bottles sat together on the table. He tried to take another glance at Dean but they were too close to each other. His mind wandering, he recollected Jack telling him how Dean didn’t kill Chuck. That he could’ve done but he chose not to, claiming that being a killer wasn’t who he was. He smiled to himself, that was exactly the message that he’d wanted to give Dean. Castiel had known since the day he met him, this man was driven by love and nothing else, even when he couldn’t see it for himself.
They stood in silence as he beat the egg into the cookie mixture via Cas. The angel not responding and Dean aware of them moving together pendulum-style. The closeness triggered goosebumps in Dean. Feeling the tickle of Cas's hair brushing his face was newly intimate and the warmth of him was comforting. He moved to take a closer look into the bowl, knocking his stomach briefly into the angel's back. He'd touched Cas before, but this was starting to burn.
Rowena raised her eyebrow at them. ‘Are you? I had a visit from one of your old acquaintances today. Someone you know pretty well indeed.’ She pointed towards Dean.
'I am,' he didn’t mean to touch his shoulder again but it happened. They looked at each other as he gripped the same spot he'd used to rescue him when they first met. Both aware that in sex they had a routine, a role that they stuck with, but he'd already been taken apart once, at least this would be at the hands of someone who...
When Cas messed up, swallowing Leviathans and lying to his face, songs crept up that much louder. With the angel gone, lyrics about love and
Cas didn’t understand why Dean had let him flip the switch on who was running this show, but his clothing joined the flannel on the floor as he undressed. Wanting to reciprocate, he took a pointed tongue quickly up his dick. Dean shook, his breath breaking into a thousand pieces as Cas tasted every inch of his cock; it was new and intoxicating.
Sam studied him, the frown growing deeper. Wondering if the reason Cas had gone was connected to the conversation he’d overheard, but he didn't want to be intrusive. ‘Okay, if you don’t want to talk, fine. How about I get us some breakfast?’
.’ He rubbed a sweaty palm over his knee, pleading with him to understand. ‘Cas, there’s nobody else.' Dean felt smothered by his own voice, but the angel blinking slow into his eyes heated him up, blood rushing around his body. ‘This, whatever
Cas knew for the first time that night exactly what to do next. He kissed his nipples, causing a flutter from Dean’s cock, then tapped his hip, ‘Lay down.’
Memories of other first kisses were blasted far out of Heaven as Cas’s hands wavered over his body, uncertain where he was allowed to put them. The hunter moved below Cas’s ear and, like clockwork, the touch of his mouth was met with Cas clamping onto Dean’s back and a low gasp drawing out.
Dropping his body to add tension, Cas worked his hands into the lower back. 'Nevermind,' He said, mouth close to Dean's ear.
‘No. No, that’s the opposite of what I want, Cas.’ Dean moved his observations to the floor before sighing. ‘I’ve missed you, man.’
Dean moved around the room, grabbing towels and still wearing the same jacket he’d had on all night. The smell of black ooze and dirt from the barn floor following them both, nothing but death and decay in their DNA, or at least that's how it felt.
Despite the fact that Cas was stronger, he let Dean haul him onto his lap; waves of water splashing up the side as the angel's feet hit the back of the tub.
His wandering eye fell on a stack of photos next to the bed, and the photographed Dean staring at him sent him breathless into their first meeting. Where the rhythm of Dean’s heartbeat had been as violent as a supernova. Tilting his head to observe him, Cas had seen every dark cloud flicker across those green eyes which had seen far too much. They were like black holes, and Cas had thought no matter how hard anyone tried this human would never be stitched whole.
Dean couldn’t quash a half smile, though he tried, but he was feeling sorta awesome. It’s not often he'd do something that anyone would describe as
‘Are you injured?’ Cas asked, ignoring the question and turning to look at Dean with a tilted head, blue escaping his narrowed eyes.
The drive had been one of fatigue and the sight of home was welcome relief as Baby rolled to a stop. Dean viewed Cas as he parked, meeting eyes in the mirror, and deciding he couldn’t let the angel leave until he’d recovered.
The rain cast a chill over Dean and he felt his body tremble, he continued watching Cas talk, his gaze drifting to his full lips as they spoke. ‘Cas, you’re losing me-’
Dean undressed, putting everything into the pile with Cas’ clothes and kicking them all to the side.
Dean shut his bedroom door quietly, despite the fury flowing inside him he didn’t want to alert Sam to trouble. He moved over to the bottle of whiskey on his desk, popping the top and splashing some straight down his gullet.
Dean had often been difficult to understand but sucking on his hard cock seemed to ease years of smoky, opaque tension. It fell apart as the impala filled with their sex, and Cas knew that Dean wanted this as much as he did; he wanted to come undone with him. Cas reached for his own cock.
With one foot in the kitchen he heard Eileen’s shout and raced through, running into the library to find her stood, paralysed. ‘What’s wrong?!’ He grabbed onto her shoulders before spotting Castiel sat by the map table. The wind rushed out of his chest and Sam smiled, holding Eileen’s hand tightly in his as he approached him. ‘Cas?’
Water stirred as Cas brought his shoulders out into the air, sitting up and placing a hand against his back, ‘Dean?’
‘What’s wrong with Dean?’ Jack asked, innocence dripping out of his large eyes as the hunter left the room.
Dean chuckled, his head lifting to look at the angel. It made the nerves running down Castiel’s spine tingle and he smiled in return.
The angel tilted his head at him, a soft reminder of how different he’d become in these last 12 years. Dean enjoyed the familiarity of those quirks; he’d humanised in so many ways but he was still Castiel.
‘That’s uh, that’s for you too.’ Dean’s voice carried a vulnerability that caught the angel off guard, he lifted his head to look at him as Dean continued. ‘You need more music in your life.’
When he entered the bunker an hour later their eyes found each other across the stairs, Dean stopping in his tracks next to the map table.
'Dean, it's not... I don't want to involve you unless I have to, you have enough with your Mother being here.' Cas tensed his jaw, absorbing the snapping of tension between them. He watched Dean's face as he morphed into a frown and fixed his eyes into the ceiling.
‘You need to tell me when you’re ready,’ Cas added another finger, mesmerised by everything happening as Dean unravelled underneath.
‘Something strange has happened, I don't know how... Look, I know it’s been a rough few weeks for ya, but it’s just, well, I think you’ll have to see it for yourself.’
‘Dean-’ His voice broke, seeing Dean so torn apart ripped his heart open. The confession had meant to help him realise who he was, how he wasn’t the angry and destructive person he’d believed himself to be. But here he was, as jagged and rocky as mountains, pieces of himself tumbling down and splintering onto the floor. His green eyes red and puffy, wide but empty.
The angel viewed the laptop screen. Dean side-eyed him, wondering what was going on in Heaven now to make him crash in during the middle of the night. Whatever it was, he seemed calm. There was no urgency in his steps, no ruffles in his feathers.
He heard Dean calling out for him in prayer and it hurt to ignore him, especially given recent events with the Empty and Dean’s upset over his decision to stay away. He sounded shaken and Cas knew he would be but there was something else in his voice, fear. No, Castiel couldn’t go and see him right now, he needed to reset. He would do exactly what Dean wanted and let go of his selfishness, forget it happened and stop asking himself what it could mean. Before leaving he took one last inhale of the memory; the feel of Dean’s touch, the smell of him close, and the softness of his mouth.
Sam nodded, inhaling deeply and accepting that he wasn’t going to get any clarity from the angel. ‘Me too,’ He replied.
They whimpered into each other. Cas' own cock pleaded for contact and he extended his hand to fit both, holding them together and making lazy jerks. It felt like nothing Cas could compare it to, his hand slick from their cocks leaking into the other, making the stroke deliciously easy. He moved quicker.
The spoon interrupted any response, clattering over the bowl to eject dough like a catapult. Dean walked over to pick it up and threw it haphazardly into the sink.
Every cell in Cas’ body screamed, wanting to celebrate it, confess it back as if it hadn’t been burning at his sides for longer than he could comprehend. But nothing else came except fear, anxiety; his reel of mistakes playing over and intercepted with each heartbreak at losing Dean. Of failing him.
Dean took the keys out of the ignition, his mouth tensing up. ‘Well, why would he?! Why bring her back? Why now? I don’t buy it. Whatever has brought Charlie back, it’s not Jack.’
‘I don’t know.’ The heel of his boot pressed down one after another until he came face to face with the angel. Cas looked up, his eyebrows knotted together as though he didn’t recognise the hunter in front of him. Dean brought his hand up and felt Cas tremble as he moved him closer. The racing of his heart was able to find Cas’s, beating in unison as he lowered himself and closed the gap between them.
Sam scanned the room for clues, knotting his brow at Dean. ‘Where’s Cas? Did you two have some kind of fight?’
The lump in Cas' throat grew painful and he tried to swallow it down, wanting to go back a few hours where the only issue between them was Cas saying he couldn't taste the difference between the apple pie Dean made himself and the one he bought from the store.
‘He’s in his room.’ Cas stood up. Looking at Dean with narrow eyes, he blinked at him with frustration. ‘What were you thinking? Have you forgotten everything we’ve been through for the sake of saving this world, what Jack is doing…?’
Dean rolled his eyes. ‘So, all night? You’ve been in here all night and you didn’t think to come and find me?’
‘What? Don’t give me that crap.’ Dean lifted his head and looked at Sam, moving slowly out of bed to face him.
‘I get what you’re saying Dean, I do. But who else has the kind of juice needed to bring someone back from the dead?’
Dean moaned softly, his breath growing deeper as Cas continued running his hand along the hunter’s warm skin. Locating all the knots around his shoulders and the aches that he kept quiet about. But the hunter's heart quickened rather than slowed down and Cas narrowed his eyes in question.
He had no idea what she was doing instead of checking in and he scowled into the room, tossing the cell onto the bedside table.
There was no answer, a sigh passing out of his lips as he threw some of the gold liquid down his throat.
‘No, you’re not fine.’ Cas sighed and walked in front of him, scrunching his face in an epiphany. ‘What if I came with you?’
‘What you got there? Love songs?’ She trapped him to her chest with a small but solid arm, traipsing a hand inside his coat. Her mouth too close to his ear as she whispered, ‘An angel carrying a cassette, you really into retro or you just got it bad?’
‘Shh... So, the hunter gulps, I’m talking a cartoon gulp,’ he continues. ‘They help each other and end up pretty close…maybe too close, but it’s complicated and the hunter doesn’t do complicated, then-’ he pauses to take a drink. ‘Years pass, the angel is suddenly human and the hunter thinks maybe this is his chance.’
The door closed with a creak as Dean watched him depart and sat on the bed, rolling his hands through his hair as he heard Castiel’s truck roar away and his Baby replace it.
‘But turns out it’s not. Life, always with the worst timing, huh? The hunter has to ask his newly-human pal to leave, but he doesn’t want to. Not even close to what he actually wants. Anyway, angel works some gas n’ sip, bangs chicks, and the hunter thinks,
Cas tried to steady himself as Dean angled towards him, feeling the surge breaking out and flooding every feather and fibre.
Their fingers had almost brushed as Dean gave it back. Despite the hurt, he’d believed all the good intentions even when Cas stole the colt from under his pillow as soon as he had the chance. He took another drink, bringing himself into the present. Why had things always ended up like that with him? Dean had tried to understand the angel, given him the benefit of the doubt more times than he wanted to remember but there was always some misunderstanding, hurtful words, followed by trying to make amends.
‘This is weird right?! Is she your world Charlie?’ The alt-world Charlie asked, pointing to the Charlie sat on the sofa next to her.
But the only noise leaving the angel were low groans with ripples of water between them; letting Dean take all the memories of the night away with the pre-come slowly leaking around his fingers.
‘I’m fine, Dean. This is only clothing.’ His unbothered tone unable to hide a dark shadow forming under his eyes.
He headed back to Lebanon in the pickup, assuming he’d been played and nobody else was meeting him. Wings had their benefit but driving made him feel closer to humans and the open road was an experience. It was Dean playing music for hours on end and the smell of burgers and fill-up joints. It had become kind of comforting even when the hunter wasn't with him.
that had fallen out and both proceeded to ignore. Too wrapped up in the case or chasing Lucifer; in trying to save the world. Now here they were in a bathtub with nothing but naked, weighty disturbances. Cas sighed as he gave in, accepting what he wanted and resting into Dean’s head with a tilt.
‘What the hell is wrong with you?’ Sam snapped. Eileen reached to put her hand on his shoulder, probably to try and steer him away from the cliff. She hadn’t been around them long but Dean knew she’d figured out their dynamics already.
‘Okay…' -Dean made slow strokes up Cas’s arm with his palm- ‘okay, look, you’ll be fine. I'll grab some books, see if we can work out what's going on.’
‘Hey, so a hunter and an angel walk into a bar…’ Dean waited with a grin, pulling a reply from Cas with his big eyes.
Running a hand over his rough stubble, the hunter parted his mouth. ‘Look, I know you think you’re okay, but humour me, man.’
The familiar tone of Castiel’s voice made him jump and Dean choked on his rush of oxygen, splashing puddles over the side of the tub.
So simple, so beautiful. Dean’s head had rolled from the declaration, there was no time to ask him what he'd meant; no time to figure anything out. It was adios.
'I think he'd probably say the same about you.' The angel looked at him as if he'd been talking Enochian, and Sam realised that Cas was just as clueless as his brother. Before he could even think how to deal with them both, his brother’s impatient voice bellowed from the hallway.
‘It’s fine, Cas.’ He waved his hand at him as if to okay the whole situation, but he couldn’t drag his eyes to meet the blue ones staring towards him. ‘You’re an angel, I get it.’
‘I missed you too Samuel. Och, as good as it feels to be stepping on these tiles again, do you mind if we take this out of the kitchen? Smells like beer, bacon, and regrets in here.’ She crumpled her nose and headed towards the library, Sam and Dean following her with confusion.
'Lights out?' Dean grinned. 'Freakin' angels.' His hand slipped around Cas's neck, kissing him with warm, slow movements.
‘Okay. Look, don’t think I’m not thankful, because I am. But Cas, didn’t you think that maybe the win was just-just you coming home?’
Dean wanted to be happy with his family under one roof. Team Free Will 2.0 reunited and Chuck nowhere to be seen, but damn, he felt played.
He couldn’t say anything else, turning away and being hauled in all directions. They sat in silence for a few minutes, Dean knew what he wanted to ask him, it’d been at the back of his mind for weeks. He took a breath to prepare. ‘Cas? I don’t want to ask you this, but I think I have to.’ He swallowed hard, wondering if Cas knew how frayed and shattered he was feeling. ‘When we were in purgatory, the second time when Michael sent us and I prayed to you…’
As though he’d grown dog ears and licked the angel’s face. Dean huffed, pulling out his phone to find zero messages or calls.
‘I get that, but all I’m saying is there’s a stack of empty bottles in your bedroom that he hasn’t seen. Look, I can’t push you. Nobody can. But if there’s a chance you love him too, doesn’t he deserve to know? After everything?’
It sounded pretty nice but no matter how Jack spun it, Dean wasn’t eager to get there. His mind wandered off, sneaking a sidelong glance to Cas laughing softly at something Sam had said. The four of them, Sam, Eileen, Cas, and Jack sitting together around the table was the image of peace, but Dean stood a few feet away, unwilling to slip into the vacant spot. The angel hadn't said another word to him and denied all eye contact.
‘So, this is it?’ Dean arched his eyebrows. ‘One $20 blanket and a thrown-together, ass backwards mixtape later and you’re throwing your hands up and saying
Castiel remained silent with Dean on his shoulder, the warmth of his mouth almost touching and the quiet vibrations of his sleep telling him what he already knew. He loved their movie nights, their time together; he loved Dean Winchester in all his facets.
The reply knocked Dean backwards and he watched the angel leave his side and walk towards Jack. A slow anger bubbled in his stomach like fizz in a beer can. He’d been unable to think about anything else, one torturous thought after another, meanwhile Castiel was as angelic as ever. Unknowing, not understanding, or had he understood completely?
Dean felt himself shift backwards but didn't know why he'd done it, maybe the adrenaline or wanting the space for everything he needed to say. He edged himself towards the counter, gripping it for support as Cas watched.
‘Every single one was of you dying over and over again, I could never save you. I’d try but my powers would fail or I’d get there too late, sometimes you’d kill me first. I lost count of how many times I watched you die.’ He stopped to breathe; his sentiment was starting to drive the train now. ‘I was helpless, and you were dead.’
With a small exhale of pleasure, Dean shyly looked down and released his balled-up hand. It was fine, Cas didn’t know the depth of human touch.
‘Cas, I know you meant it. That’s not what I-’ He paused, his chest tightening. ‘I couldn’t get my head around you saying all that, then not coming back when Jack pulled you out. I don’t know, I guess I just thought that maybe you didn’t mean it in the same way that I heard it.’
Cas surveyed him, his eyes narrowing for a moment before recognition replaced the bewilderment. ‘Okay. If that’s what you want.’
‘This doesn’t have to be a one-time-deal, Cas.' His chest rising as he struggled to talk, 'I’m in this if you’re in this, y’know?’
The shivering steadied as Cas wrapped his hand around the hunter’s arm, opening his eyes softly to look at him. ‘Dean, stop. I’m fine.’
He paused, the encouragement was good to hear but Cas wanted something else. Giving Dean a moment to miss the heat from his lips, he sat back and curved his hand over his balls, listening to Dean's shallow clutches for air. The longing for the hunter was almost unbearable as Cas saw pre-come pearl onto his stomach and Dean lifted his head to look at him with glassy, lustblown eyes.
‘Could you guys stop whatever you’re doing, Eileen and me just got woken up by 3 lightbulbs blowing out…’
They shifted further into one another, Dean didn’t know if it was an angel thing or a Cas thing, but the touch elicited shocks and he threw his head back, ‘This is some jacked up crap, Cas…’
Protecting the Winchesters had been his driving force for almost as long as he’d known them, rebelling from Heaven because Dean had taught him what was right and worth saving. And he’d watched them sacrifice themselves over and over; the fear of losing them, of losing Dean, always at the back of his mind. Cas hadn't thought what would be left if something happened to him, bleeding out on a makeshift seat whilst everyone he cared about wrote
Dean felt his body drifting but he was sure he wasn't moving. He smiled in return, a warmness escaped him and he allowed his hand to comb through the angel's hair. Castiel’s eyes doubled in size and Dean could almost feel the shivers he’d just sent down his spine. Taking each other in, their breathing seemed to synchronise, chests rising and falling as one.
Dean shivered and looked at the whiskey on the table, the blunt strike of the angel’s words was venomous. He was paralysed, only able to look at Cas and meet the ache in the air between them.
A thought creeped into his head that this was nothing but a waste of time, if Cas hadn’t bothered to come before, why would he now? He pursed his lips together, chasing it to the back of his brain as he planted his eyes closed, determined to see the prayer through to the end as best he could.
‘We LARP’ed together, right?’ Charlie asked, burying her eyes into them whilst pushing her hair out of her face.
Sam nodded as Eileen spoke and signed, looking as she gave Jack an open-hearted smile. He knew there was at least 3 more packs in the fridge but then again, that didn’t always mean anything. He travelled back to the angel across from him, feeling no other option. ‘Cas, can I talk to you?’
‘Did you even ask her what she wanted? Because she seemed pretty damn surprised to me.’ Dean shot a look towards him, drawing his brow down.
Attempting to steady his heartbeat was difficult with Cas’s fingers touching him like hot stones. He let their eyes meet, ‘Nothing, I’m good. Relaxed, that’s all…’
Heaven had always said that Cas lost his way when he met Dean, but he knew that Dean had shown him what made life worth having. Maybe they were both a bit cracked, but together they were stronger; he had learnt that love was unbreakable, even through death.
Dean’s eyes focused to see the radio in his hands, ‘You need to rewind it.’ Cas squinted in puzzlement and the hunter angled a finger to the buttons, ‘The one with the arrow pointing left.’
Kissing down his hipbone, Cas looks up to see the hunter throw his head into the pillow with a small gasp. Cas had heard that make up sex was on another level, and as his lips land on the tip of Dean's cock they look at each other in sync. The heat between blue and green eyes sending Cas to light up with grace. Pulling the blanket fully over his head, dimming the glow, Cas hears his name fall out of Dean's mouth in a deep moan.
Cas moved to lay down, bringing the blanket up from the floor with him as he got under the duvet. Another new habit they had fallen into, Cas didn’t sleep but he liked to see Dean carry the release of tension as he drifted off.
Smiling, Cas ran his hand up and over Dean’s shoulder, feeling him soften under his touch and dissolve into the bed under them. Rescuing this man from hell had been the objective of a soldier, but loving him? That was his earnt free will.
Castiel followed him out of the kitchen and into the library, stopping in his tracks when Sam spun around and towered above him. ‘Dean is freaking out and he won’t tell me anything. Cas, I don’t know what to do anymore, you’ve got to tell me what happened the other night? I thought things were- I thought you were talking things out.' He knew that he was pleading for information that Dean didn’t want to share, but the desperation and spiralling that his brother was doing had to stop. Hopeful that Cas might advise him, there was nobody else he could talk to about it.
‘You got a messed up way of exchanging gifts, Cas. This is dying, not watching a movie under a freakin’ blanket,’ he ran his hand down his face, leaving his eyes pleading.
‘Dean, you’re drinking like a fish and you’re upset. You know you can talk to me, right? What’s going on with you?’
Dean had been sat on the floor for several minutes before deciding to speak out. Putting down the bottle of beer he’d involuntarily brought with him. ‘You’re not even in the freaking Empty? You’ve been out this whole time?’ He spoke quietly, trying to take some deep breaths whilst his lungs struggled. ‘What the hell, man? Why wouldn’t you-’ He stopped, letting his eyes fill up. He didn’t need to ask why Cas hadn’t come back to him. He already knew the answer.
‘I don’t know, Cas. I mean you’re here, you’re there. You disappear, you come back; you say we’re family then I don’t hear from you. What do you expect me to think?’
‘Well, I don't think there will be a next time but if there is, I will make sure to ask first. Please could you pass me an egg?’
He moved into the hunter’s space, closing the gap and feeling the distant beat of his heart as it quickened. The green in Dean’s eyes became eclipsed by darkness pooling out and he wondered if Dean saw the same in him, if his pupils inked secrets. Maybe they made it obvious that being away from Dean had taught Cas how much he wanted to be with him; that their bond could take any shape the hunter wanted because there was no doubt in Cas' mind that he, an angel of the Lord, belonged entirely to a human who wore hot dogs on his pyjamas. He breathed deep, ‘Dean, I don’t care what happens to me, but you will not go through this alone.’
Cas touched his arm and moved a step closer. ‘I don’t want to pretend that didn’t happen, but I’ll respect your decision.’
‘Yes, the quicker we find him, the better. The last thing we need is him out in the world with no idea where or what he's doing.'
He thought about it all the way home, how Cas had been a soldier of Heaven before they met, setting the idea of halos and fluffy wings ablaze. Eons of existence and now, here he was, eight years after their first meeting:
Seconds later and Dean saw stars, surging into the cosmos as he let Cas know where he was going. He didn’t say his name, not outloud, but he shattered the sky with his release.
‘That night you dropped all these things on me… There was Billie… And maybe I should’ve said more but you know what? Maybe you should’ve told me about the deal. You can be pissed at me, that’s fine, but don’t do this. Don’t pretend like nothing means anything anymore. You should’ve told me… about all of it. I deserved to know. I deserved to know every single deal you made, what you mean… Why wouldn’t you tell me any of this? Get down here now you son of a bitch.’ His face softened. ‘I need to see you, man. I need to see you.’
‘Is this okay?’ Cas walked outside, stopping halfway between the room and the tub to look himself over.
Cas remained quiet, gathering himself up as the angel blade fell from his sleeve and perfectly into his hand.
and lip bites guide him. He thrusted harder, Dean squeezing his thighs around Cas until he almost felt a crush of pain.
‘No.’ Dean’s voice cracked through the room. ‘Sam, I know you’ve been praying to Jack, just stop. He didn’t bring back Charlie.’
'No...' He breathed the reply, then made the movement swift as his hand tucked around the angel’s neck. Dean found his lips immediately, tasting the steam from the water. They slipped neatly against his and despite keeping his mouth closed, he arched into it then ended the kiss quietly.
Cas glared at him, frustrated. ‘So, tomorrow you think you’ll be ready for anything on a couple of hours sleep with a crooked neck?’
‘Sit properly, man!’ Dean stretched his legs out along the bed, inviting Cas to copy. He took a drink of his beer, his stomach spasmed and accepted the alcohol, leaving a tiny buzz vibrating into his bloodstream. He looked at Cas through the corner of his eye, the angel was kicking his legs out and propping a cushion behind his back. Leaning against the headboard, they held each other in soft regard.
‘Cas,’ Dean put the tape on the bedside table. ‘You know that I've made poor choices for dumbass reasons too. But our lives are never gonna be safe; this isn't a movie, there's no right time, there's right now and deal with whatever crap comes along.’
Sam left the library with Eileen, Castiel had already been over the details he had with them and it was late, he was feeling beat. They'd reached Sam's bedroom when he felt in his pockets, realising that his phone was left on the table. He touched Eileen's shoulder, telling her vocally and with sign language, 'I’ve left my phone. I’ll be there in a minute.’
is weird?’ His younger brother watched him, as though he’d discovered a new piece of a puzzle and was trying to slot it into place.
‘...No, that’s not…' He sighed, halfway between weary and bliss. 'I want to forget,’ breathing was hard as Dean moved again, alternating strokes with wet,
for the first time. Soldier of Heaven or not, he’d taken Dean out of this world in 20 minutes. To a place where every touch was born of care and laced with love. For the first time, Dean could believe that good things do happen and he threw a lopsided grin. ‘Y’know? My shirt looked pretty good on you.’
After purgatory and getting Cas home, Dean started sharing music with him. He knew the tunes to play in Baby when it was the two of them, and which aroused a reaction. Tapping his hand along the steering wheel, the air thick with reverberation between them and a warm inviting shimmer across the angel’s face which Dean was happy to hold.
Slipping it into his pocket, he reviewed his plan. Whatever happened afterwards, he'd deal with it. Tonight, he was gonna help Cas clean up the destruction he’d made in the kitchen; eat a cookie, or maybe four; then have a beer together. Cas will say
Dean swallowed the consent. Moving slow and jagged, their eyes closing in sync as he skimmed over Cas’s lips. Coaxing until he held the angel’s bottom lip in his. Once he had him, he savoured it before resuming the kiss. He’d thought about kissing him more often that he’d ever admit, always behind closed doors where he hoped Cas would never sense the longing or interest.
and Cas had enough knowledge from Metatron to know that giving someone a tape was thoughtful, but he gave it no more consideration. Too aware of what Dean needed to hear and too naïve to think of anything
They couldn’t reach each other's eyes, but Dean’s breath hitched. He picked up the soap and rubbed it into his hands; creating a filthy noise that normally would’ve borne a bad joke, but instead he glided over Cas’ shoulders in silence. Vapour clung to them, wrapping both in clean sweat as Dean’s face grew flushed and Cas’ hair twisted with humidity.
With the tip of his cock pressed to Dean's entrance, Cas bent over and kissed him. Dean stroking down his back and around the curve of his ass to encourage him, but Cas didn’t push. No, not yet. He wanted Dean to go to pieces before he started fucking him. He waited, applying just enough pressure to receive dirty moans from the hunter.
They got home, and Dean announced he had one goal: get cleaned up. So, here they were. Cas had no use for baths or showers, but he yearned to try and reclaim the night from rotting angel flesh.
He bit his lip briefly, sinking further down into Cas’s eyes as he tried to stay afloat a little longer.
Cas looked at him, dipping his eyes into what must’ve been the saddest expression Dean had seen and he'd seen a lot! A pang of guilt nipped him and he tried to hide the remorse by holding his gaze with the table.
The hunter nodded, tearing himself away as he smoothed his face. A new quiet entered the room, one of peace, but the electricity was bouncing off the walls as Cas felt the warmth of Dean's touch. He followed the man's gaze to their hands and where Dean’s palm was resting on top of his. They sat in static but he could feel the pulsing of Dean’s body through his fingers. He watched as Dean slowly moved himself like honey from Castiel's wrists and down to his fingertips. It was a sensation he hadn’t experienced before. He’d felt human contact but this was lightning bolts travelling at cosmic speeds deep within, stirring his body in ways he’d never imagined. His chest moving rapidly, he tried to steady it. None of this felt real to him, wanting to hold someone else’s hand wasn’t a natural instinct he had, but right now? It felt perfect.
Dean followed the bottle of whiskey back to the table but Cas pushed him gently back from it. The hunter rose above him, his heart beating heavily against his chest; he was used to fighting out there but conflicts at home tasted much more unpleasant. ‘Then why say all that and then not even bother to come and see me when you’re miraculously saved from hell?’ The muscles in his neck tightened and he heard himself swallow.
Their bodies clicked into place like a jigsaw and the angel pulsed into Dean until he found stillness. Wanting the night to be over and Cas in full angelic health, he secured him with both arms. His lips fixed together, pouting, and his jaw tightened; he could ignore feelings forever if he had Cas alive.
Dean rolled his eyes, stubborn son of a bitch. He increased pressure and tracked up the length of Cas’s back causing the angel to tip forward. Heading towards the neck, he remembered how electric the touch there had been and carefully massaged into the angel’s soft, tanned skin. How was he so tanned anyway? As he pushed aside an image of Castiel, Angel of the Lord, sunbathing, he saw Cas had dropped his head. With more of his neck exposed for Dean to have access to, Cas braced against the table with each motion until he was resting on his elbows. The hunter smirked, widening his hand to find more of him and using his thumb to make shapes. Maybe he was good at this after all.
‘It doesn’t matter because Dad isn’t here. Maybe he’d be supportive or maybe he’d be Dad about it but what difference does it make? Trust me, if you’ve got a shot at love with someone who gets us, knows what we’ve been through and not only accepts that but is a part of it…? Take it.’ Sam pressed his hands into his legs before standing up, his eyes sharp but pleading with Dean. ‘It’s Cas, and you’re the only person who doesn’t seem to get that you love him just as much as he loves you.’
‘I don’t need a-’ Cas cracked with frustration as the hunter pushed a black t-shirt into his chest, ‘Dean!’
‘The angel says,’ Cas interrupts, turning his hand to entwine their fingers together, locked into his gaze whilst hidden in the sanctuary of their blanket. ‘That falling in love was worth the fall from heaven.’
It became obvious that Dean wasn't a stranger to what they were doing as he reached for Cas’ cock, lining it up against himself as Cas slipped his hands away. ‘Go slow.’
Dean started stroking over the head, hot and easy with the water in his hand, ‘I can’t lose you, man.’
They paused, reaching the map table as Dean dropped his bag onto it and looked at him with intent. Cas too weak to hold his own and Dean, refusing to accept any stubborn quirks from him.
Dean suddenly shot up, turning his head slightly to Cas as his hand moved with his words. 'That's it, you better catch me up or so help me I will cuff you to this bed.'
Dean wet his lips instinctively, he’d expected the shorts to be on the large side but Cas filled them in all the right places. The angel’s hipbones embezzling the spotlight, he cleared his throat. ‘Yeah, that works.’
Dean reminded himself. This shaping of lips, the touch on the inside of his thigh, the nose brushing against his. It was all Cas.
Dean wasn’t a stranger to firsts; his whole life had been on the road with first days of school, first kisses, first nights in this motel or that motel, he’d died enough to have a first for that. They were a part of his life, kinda routine, nothing to really write home about. Castiel must’ve had enough firsts to render them ordinary as well, and as Dean replayed the haunting
Castiel viewed him with inquisitiveness and uncertainty before looking away and descending into silence, Dean knew he wasn’t saying everything he wanted to.
Tightening his fingers around the angel's hand, Dean was sure he could feel the drum of Cas's heart but maybe that was his own. He became acutely aware of how close he’d shifted, his legs consuming Cas between them. Forgetting he could move his feet to get out of his own trap, he kept beating and hoping Cas couldn't feel the shiver climbing out of his body.
Cas seemed to enjoy spending time with him this way, going for drives and beer runs; Dean had decided that angels didn't feel human love, but he knew Cas cared.
The beer bottle that Dean had been picking apart for an hour now was leaving his fingers slightly sticky, but the only thing he cared about was trying to find the right words without stumbling or sounding like a douchebag. He cast a side-eye into the room and inhaled, one last try.
The angel looked at him with a puzzle across his brow as Dean felt himself smirk. For a second, he panicked. He’d been assuming Cas meant the full definition of the phrase
‘It’s not Dean,’ Cas interjected with a side of aggression. ‘It’s not… This is my fault, Sam. I’m the one ignoring his messages, not the other way around.’
‘The hell?’ Dean asked. Realising the noise was coming from under the seats as he grappled onto the floor for his jeans.
‘I just wish I could do more to protect you and Sam.’ Cas looked at him, his brow sad against his eyes.
‘Awesome, get the pie too.’ Dean tapped his hand on Cas’ shoulder and left the angel troubling over his lip.
‘The same kind we always make.’ Dean drank some beer, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. ‘Remember back when Jack was dying? Cas told me that he offered his own life in exchange for Jack’s, that’s why we got the kid back.’
‘Freakin’ angels, man.’ Dean shook his head, avoiding his gaze as he dragged his thumb around the glass. ‘Cas left. Like he always does, and no, I don’t know where he went.’
The murmur of his brother’s voice travelled with fragmented syllables, but Sam broke into a smile. He didn’t want to eavesdrop, especially when it was clear that things between them were tenuous. He turned around ready to leave, until the unmistakeable sound hit him hard.
‘I don’t know, maybe.’ He wanted to probe the idea, if Cas had said all this several years ago, how would their lives have changed? Fear gripped onto him and he swallowed the lump in his throat. He had to say it, it was now or simply forget it. ‘Okay,’ he said under his breath.
Dean’s smile faded fast as he watched Cas fall into silence. He pursed his lips together, sharp lines appearing between his eyes.
Stroking goosebumps along Dean’s arm, Cas’s eyes told of desperate words but neither could speak. Instead, Dean darted his tongue and made another move for the angel, quickening the pace from deliberate to torturous.
‘Cas-.’ He began, too many things trying to come out at once. ‘Why aren’t you here, man?’ He stared around the room, almost feeling the air move as it would when he'd walk in with his trenchcoat flying behind. ‘Why wouldn’t you come and tell me that you’re safe? We’re family.’
Dean wasn’t ignoring him, not on purpose. Entirely lost in the sensation of touch along his upper body, he couldn’t remember the last time someone had really felt him, put their entire palm onto his body without a desire to hurt. Someone handling his mess of bones, organs, and broken flesh with fondness. Someone he trusted. He suddenly remembered Cas saying
, Dean had said on the way home as his knuckles turned white along the steering wheel. Sam nodded with thin lips into the road ahead. Cas had stared weakly out of the window, his hand binded by bloody and torn fabric.
‘Oh, sure. But not actually talk to us? Well, that’s great. Thanks, but no thanks.’ He moved to shut the door as Cas slammed his hand into it, fear driving him. Dean huffed, turning into the room and biting along his lip as Cas followed and closed the door behind him.
Dean walked back in and closed the door, clutching the blanket and two beers in his hands. ‘Okay, no being a dick if I fall asleep because it’s gonna happen.’
‘No, none of that,’ Dean interrupted, panting heavily as he put his hand around Cas to slow him down.
Waiting to see if Cas was going to resume, Dean wet his lips. The heat of the angel's hand returned and this time, Dean tried to keep cool but shivered as a thumb inadvertently slipped under the collar of his shirt. A moment later, Cas was back trailing down his shoulder blade, back on top of his plaid.
He sat down and pulled a tape out of his pocket, framing it between his fingers and looking with sad eyes.
‘Dean, I can assure you’ –he looked at him with the blue burning out of his eyes- ‘that I want this.’
The pair exchanged a smile; Dean had missed this. It was what he’d fought Chuck for in the first place, his life belonging to nobody else. No hamster wheel, no pre-destined crap. Free to watch movies and eat pie with whoever he wanted, and despite knowing he was about to spend the next two hours explaining to Cas
‘Everything. Then when you said what you did, and the Empty came and just like that you were gone. I wanted to go back, you have no idea, Cas. I was ready to go way back to when you walked through that barn and-’
Cas frowned at him. They’d been debating this for two weeks, the angel unwavering that Dean had drunkenly left open explicit content. It made more sense than thinking Cas, who expressed as much interest in sex as a gnat, would be watching porn whilst Dean slept. Yet, the hunter knew his collection meticulously. Men of letters were librarians after all, and this was one area he excelled in organising, cataloguing, and alphabetising.
were unrestrained. Castiel wondered how they had gone from arguing about killing Amara on a suicide mission to
Dean viewed himself, body suddenly awake and tingling all over. Cas moved to the lower back, rubbing close to the band of his jeans. Dean found himself holding his breath. A familiar and needy burn became too intense and he flexed his wrist, squeezing his hand together.
Dean nodded. ‘Well least you're back, got us Tombstone to watch,’ he raised his eyebrows suggestively. ‘You’re gonna love it…I’ll get set up.’
‘Yes. Dean, I only stopped because I didn’t want you to wake up tomorrow, horrified at anything you might’ve done. You know that?’
Pulling himself off the bed, he headed out of the room and into the library to find the angel sat with Sam and Eileen, a quiet conversation happening and cards in front of them. ‘What’s going on?’
Cas worried over his lip for a moment, maybe sharing this hadn’t been the best idea. Perhaps leaving feelings locked in mixtapes, blankets, and hijacked touches was better, safer. His eyes wandered to stare at the steering wheel until Dean’s hand on his thigh brought him back.
They fixed a look to each other, if it hadn’t been for the cock in his hand and the ass he was centimetres from entering then Cas would think this was any other day between them. Dean had that straight jaw and stubborn expression. Cas opened his mouth to ask him what he meant by that but was cut off by finding out.
The angel met the distressed hair and reddened eyes of the hunter, his expression blank. Cas didn't know what to say and choked on his nerves. Hadn't he been waiting for Dean to wake up? To fix the gnawing emptiness from being apart?
The angel moved into the empty spot, settling a hand on his stomach as he laid down and closed his eyes.
The hunter’s heart sprinted, damnit, he didn’t want to stop. His face twisted, pained by the idea. ‘What? No. I need you to go with me on this, man.’ Returning to Cas, he was allowed to steal another kiss. Thoughts had started to catch up to his actions, wanting to melt and surrender. Knowing he’d feel a sense of peace in his head, his nerves, and his bones, but only if they kept going and didn’t let the anxiety sat in the pit of his stomach take over.
Dean slowed down, blinking at him with an open face. Vulnerability cutting through the haze, 'You sure?'
‘I’m sorry, Sam. I can’t tell you anything. Whatever your brother is going through, it’s not for me to talk about.’
Dean nudged himself along the seat to create more space, catching sight of Castiel moving shirtless behind the glass door.
‘I guess not,’ Dean replied quietly. He swung his black denim jacket over his shoulder, knowing it was now or never. ‘… Here, take this.’
‘Hello Dean!’ Jack said, stopping next to the map table with his hand raised into a little wave. He held himself tall, but he was still their kid, his face open and bright.
Dean looked over his shoulder to see Cas had left them hanging over the chair and dripping water into the carpet.
‘I’m not expecting you to return my feelings, Dean, and I’m not going anywhere either. I just wanted to tell you without the conditions of the last time I said those words.’
Cas sank into him, noticing for the first time as his cock disappeared. Gone. Nothing but Dean clamped around him like he was never going to let go. They spluttered each other's name, a few curses, and a collection of noises into the impala; making desperate and needy moves. He could feel Dean's muscles tensing under his own as he chased the heat, screaming for release.
Whilst she dragged a finger over the label, he charged and forcibly removed life from her. The angel blade cutting through her stolen bones as she screamed into oblivion. Twisting it further with one eyebrow raised high, Cas pulled out and watched her body drop next to the tape on the ground. He secured it back into his pocket, where it lived, as her words dawned confusion across his face.
‘Song?’ Dean could hear the music, but the longing for absent kisses was louder and he cupped the angel’s face, taking him into a hot, open-mouthed kiss before he could stop himself. A faint worry about moving too fast squared his hips away. He readied to pause, to stop, to think this through before all bonds were simultaneously broken and sealed.
‘And what, Sam? The situation between me and him isn’t something you can chalk up easy. If it was, don’t you think I would’ve done by now? He’s an angel, what don’t you understand about that? You think we’re just gonna hold hands, kiss, and then what…?’
‘Cas, wait.’ He cleared his throat. ‘Could we watch a movie or something, you know, just hang out with some drinks. I'll get us some pie?’
It felt right to do this with Dean. To feel his erection, his own cock heavy between them as Dean feathered strokes like it belonged to him. Each touch detangling years of shoulder taps, lingering hugs, and soft caresses that only came with sacrifices and despair. Which might be exactly what was happening now, Cas thought, but the frequency turned up high enough to leave shockwaves. All he knew was how much he wanted to make Dean feel alive.
Dean’s words were soft in Castiel ears and he drank up the man in front of him. In all the years Castiel had known Dean Winchester, there had been many times when his actions and words left the angel questioning, appreciative, or touched. This was definitely all three. He maintained eye contact as the words sank in, the green in Dean’s eyes peppered with tiredness but strong and unmoving.
Dean smiled into the carpet, his hand still resting on the angel as he spoke, ‘Me too.’ He stood up and walked towards the desk, collecting a radio cassette player and bringing it back towards the bed.
Cas altered the direction of movement, spreading warmth as he applied pressure, then travelled upwards. He massaged his neck, fingertips sliding into Dean’s hair like sparks. The hunter pressed his forearm into the table, fist tightly wrapped up and trying to encourage stillness in his body. The buzz of skin-to-skin contact ricocheted through him, like a lightning bolt shooting out. He forced himself to breathe, to steady his heartbeat.
‘Probably wanting to know where we are.’ Cas looked around the steam filled windows, unable to see anything except finger markings where one of them must have reached for the cool glass. ‘We have been gone a while.’
‘That’s not what it’s for.’ Dean replied, carefully nudging the beer label with his thumb. ‘Look, things have been rough lately and I'm not talking about whatever killer-angel mojo Rowena used on you...’
‘Cas, you never told me what happened that night. How did you summon the Empty? I thought you said it would only come when you were truly happy?’
‘You’re still up, good.’ Jack strolled in, unaware but glowing with content. ‘Do you want to play some cards?’
They didn't know where to look, darting into each other's eyes then casting it away, afraid it was a declaration too close to the truth. As Cas started to drive quicker into him, he caught sight of Dean’s cock laying thick on his stomach and started to stroke it.
‘Dean, Lucifer is still out there, his offspring growing...’ Cas snapped the laptop lid shut and stood up, moving it onto the desk as Dean watched with his eyebrows high. ‘We have no idea where Kelly is, what this child is even going to be; you need to look after yourself-’
'Yes. No, that’s not-' He couldn't stop to imagine what that would have looked like, but he watched Cas root himself to the ground with enough confidence to gank him.
are the one who keeps telling me that I’m wrong, that I feel a love of family and friendship, which I don’t agree with by the way.  Now you’re angry when all I’m doing is what
Cas looked at him with squinted eyes, mourning the loss of pleasure and torn between kissing him or questioning him as Dean moved away. He leant over the front seats to open the glove compartment and Cas wondered what he could possibly have in there to benefit their current circumstance.
Dean paused with the top of the beer bottle resting against his mouth. Too many thoughts circling in his head as he locked the phone. ‘I don’t know.’
The angel recognised the high-pitched wail of Dean’s favourite slasher, blood splatters covering the camera as he took a laborious breath. ‘Shouldn’t we wait for Sam?’
Saying yes to Lucifer days later didn't even register as a bad idea. Cas couldn't open this Pandora's box until they were all safe, and letting the devil drive for a while gave them a way to win whilst he had time to think. But what did he know about love? He knew that he cared about Dean, that things always felt different with him. So, he sat in a version of the bunker's kitchen, locked inside his own head, with no way of talking to Dean about any of it.
‘What- What’s wrong?’ Many years of needing to be vigilant caused Dean's head to jump upright, his face full of slumber but his muscles ready.
. He slowly ran fingertips up and down Cas’s spine a few times. Stopping every few moments to press all four fingers and thumbs into random areas on his back. Pinching harder each time. He heard Cas’s breathing get deeper, deliberate, and he leaned into it. Letting Cas guide, hands moving in tandem with him as the angel filled himself quietly with oxygen then released. It was kinda mesmerising, an angel wilting under his touch.
Sam, on a journey of expression, drew his eyebrows together before noticing the back of the room. His frown sinking harder. ‘Dean, are those my shorts?’
Castiel turned to sit back down. ‘I didn’t want to disturb you both, I wanted you to enjoy a bit of peace.’
Cas put his hand on Dean's shoulder, the hunter lowering his gaze to where sparks of their first touch still burnt like embers. Cas felt it, sharing a look with him as they breathed in sync; tied through bonds that just would not break.
‘There’s no need, Cas.’ He squeezed the angel’s leg. ‘I’m glad you’re okay, and you would’ve done the same for me…for Sam…’
The angel turned to him, wanting to believe but failing. Love was the biggest risk they carried but before he could try to argue, Sam cut him off.
Before he could ask anything else, Dean heard his phone ringing from inside the room. He took one last glance at Cas before pushing himself up and out of the tub. Collecting a towel en-route and rubbing excess water off himself, he grabbed the cell to see
‘It matters because if you do feel the same but he thinks you don’t, then maybe that’s one reason he hasn’t come back yet.’
As Dean pressed play on the radio, Cas took his share of the blanket and smoothed it across his lap in time to be handed a beer.
‘Dean, it’s fine.’ Cas said it without checking first. It wasn’t fine, he wanted to discuss this further.
They stood in stillness, Dean's breath stuck in his chest as his jaw travelled slowly up and down, feeling choked.
‘Your brother, he’s a complex person. I’m never quite sure what he means even when I can hear his prayers.’
'Geez, what a line,' Dean replied, putting his beer onto the table before sliding his hand behind Cas' neck and kissing him.
. He sat back down on the bed, glancing up at his brother. ‘If Dad heard this… what the hell would he think?’ He forced out a chuckle, letting his hand trail over his face.
‘I know.’ He replied, blinking slow as Dean felt that familiar yearn in his chest. ‘Do you want to try it before I bake it? In case it's not edible?’
Dean nudged closer. The bath squeaking under the drag of his body and he popped over Cas’ shoulder. His cheek rough against the side of Cas’ face, but his soft, sleepy cock touching him like an apparition of how close they'd grown. He made more bubbles, dropping the soap into the water, then curving fingers against his collarbone. Gently stroking down his chest and into the hollow of his legs, collecting water in his palm, and washing the bubbles down his stomach. Both hands moving to squeeze along his arms.
‘That’s not-’ Cas caught sight of the bed and stopped for a beat, the memories breaking him. ‘I was looking for Kelly so you didn’t have to. I wanted a win, to find a way to be happy.’
‘Well, it’s been so long, thought I best check how my favourite wee brothers were doing in a post-Chuck world?’ She sat down on a chair and watched them with intrigue.
Cas watched. Even with a face fractured by panic, splintering with realisation that it was the end of Cas, the end of them, Dean was still the most beautiful thing he had ever known. If dying was his fate then he wanted Dean to be the last thing he'd see, but he didn’t want Dean having to live with the image reflected.
The spoon clattered onto the counter from Dean’s fingers and he reached for the coffee he’d been stirring on autopilot. Sure, he was relieved about beating Chuck and that Jack was now happily fixing things in Heaven, but nothing stopped that icy ache from losing his best friend. Castiel’s face was a ghost, following him around and engulfed by the blackness that had consumed him. The angel had kept his eyes ahead when it happened, turning only once to look where he’d thrown Dean to the floor before he was dragged to nothing. A smile across his lips that never faded, he’d been so happy just to tell him how he’d felt. Dean on the other hand could barely live with himself for standing in silence, struggling through the words only to be able to find,
They kept a small gap between their bodies, the tension still too thick to move through. ‘Mostly songs we’ve shared, or ones that made me think of you…’ He paused, letting the rush of vulnerability leave his body. ‘...Some I know you like despite the fact you say otherwise.’
It took Dean 5 minutes to change into the pair of shorts he’d rummaged out of his bottom drawer before they’d left, then an extra 3 minutes to eagerly wade each foot into the faux-wooden, plastic tub. With his breathing calm, Dean could only hear the hum of the electric heater and a slight wind rustling the trees that gave it privacy. The moon brightened the space around him, joining the glow of a flickering lamp next to the sliding, glass door.
‘Everything's fine,' Jack smiled. 'I just wanted to say hi...I missed you both. I know that I didn’t come back when you wanted me to, Cas, he-’
‘Yeah, of course,’ Dean couldn't stop the red flush from inside his collar and immediately stepped back. Rebooting himself to factory settings, he walked to the table and perched on it. A discreet tug on his shirt before sending a side-eye to Cas.
He pressed his body against a cupboard, the metal of the handle knocked into his lower back but Dean didn’t move. His hand rubbed over his rough cheek as he got lost in purgatory. The panic of losing Cas, of being denied the chance to make things right; he’d felt a surge of emotions like a tidal wave and hadn’t stopped to think about any of them. Taking to his knee, apologising, wanting to find him and get the hell back to the bunker; that was all he’d cared about and a million things had tumbled out of his brain. He looked over at the angel who was observing him quietly and all he could do was ask himself how he got into this mess?
Castiel let the corner of his mouth lift up into a half-smile before settling back on Dean, his eyes might've been the colour of emeralds but they appeared like snowballs frozen wide.
Cas grabbed his hips to draw him over his lap, their cocks tapping together and if that didn't make Cas' skin jump then nothing ever would.
‘No, you don’t. Come on.’ Dean knocked his head in the direction of the hallway and collected his bag. ‘Let’s get you cleaned up.’
‘The rain is unfortunate; I’ll give you that, but no. Look, when Jack first came into being, the child of an angel and a human, remember the chaos? Heaven and Hell both wanted him; we thought he was dangerous, feared what might happen… But what’s he doing? He’s rebuilding Heaven, he helped defeat Chuck; he’s a miracle, Dean. Could we explain to anyone why? No. Could we define who he is? He’s God but-’
‘What are you doing, man? You know we could’ve just walked outside? I've told you about zapping me places.’ He slipped the additional layer over himself then shoved his hands into his pockets. The change in location had raised his guard.
‘Cas, Dean’s right,’ Sam added, boots beating the floor to join them. ‘You should stay, even if you don’t need to. You had a rough go tonight, get some rest.’
The hand was still resting on him and Dean held his body out fear of knocking him away. Cas didn't look to be accepting of what he'd said and deepened his gaze. Dean searched for a clue, trying to work out what was happening, but it was reminiscent of leafing through a book of symbols, all beautifully presented but without a codex.
‘Yeah… Come here, man.’ Wrapping his left arm around Cas, he drew him close to his chest and used his right hand to hold him at the base of his neck. The angel’s chin rested on his shoulder for a few seconds, hair pressing against Dean’s ear. A soft stirring occurred inside Dean, a reaction to their bodies touching softly and a small gasp escaped him. Feeling Castiel peel himself away, the hunter pulled back and they met, a gradual smile cracking the angel’s eyes. Dean meant to move away completely, that’s what he was telling himself to do but instead he was immovable, his hand still cupping Castiel's neck. The air was loose in his chest, fluidic and moving into his skin leaving goosebumps. It only took one swift movement to feel his lips against Cas's, Dean stopped the kiss as rapidly as he’d started it.
Dean swallowed, his jaw tight as leather. He blinked additional times before he could ask what he wanted to.
‘Don’t worry about Dean, you've got enough that you're doing.’ Cas placed his hand on Jack's shoulder.
Dean surveyed the kitchen; oven heating, cooking trays greased, 1950s bunker-utensils that came out when Dean felt in a nesting mood. He landed back on Cas, the two images didn’t fit together, 'Why?'
Cas touched the edge of the blanket. The feel of fabric had never been of import, he wore the clothes that Jimmy had and as a human he'd found comfort in the basics. He continued moving it under his hands until a tape fell out, hitting the bed cover silently. The warmth of Dean’s discreet gaze feathered his skin as he picked it up.
He looked back at Cas who regarded him soothingly but didn’t reply, his lowering gaze satisfied Dean’s question.
But Cas broke the kiss against his own will, ‘Dean, stop.' He tried to find anywhere to look that wasn't the green eyes in front of him. 'Perhaps we never should have started...whatever this is.’
