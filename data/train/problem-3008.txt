Letting Dean’s lack of concern settle his own stomach, Sam just sighed and nodded. Dean eased immediately which Sam thought was weird. Why would Dean needed to be put to ease about this?
“Well let’s start with the basics. Instead of Build-A-Bear we’re gonna do Build-A-Childhood. Jimmy was a few years older than me so we could stick to that if you like.”
"Yes dude! We were walking on the sidewalk and then out of nowhere he hurls himself at a trash can and knocked it over. Like a full body slam. I pick it up and put it back just thinking that was weird and a one time thing but he did it three more times before I dragged him back home."
Their lives turned into a routine since he started helping care for Jack. Cas would spend most of his time caring for Jack or hanging out with Dean and the other adults. When Dean wasn’t helping Cas with Jack, he was put to work by Sam and Mary: consulting with other hunters, answering phones, helping read up on the lore.
The angel next to her was Duma who had died in his arms. Dean almost couldn’t believe he was seeing her. He remembers her name being called when they pulled the angels. She looked happier than she had both times they had met previously. A shy smile formed on her lips and her eyes held a little warmth as she returned Dean’s gaze.
“And who did you find on the way?” the woman joked. She was a pretty brunette in green dress that looked to be around Sam’s age. Her eyes were friendly and she smiled at them openly.
Dean had been given a horse-sized pain anesthetic injection to numb his entire leg while they sawed off the extra thick cast. Apparently, the night Dean had undergone surgery to repair his leg and place pins, the hospital had run out of normal cast material and had to use some experimental cast material dropped off by a new pharmaceutical company earlier in the week on Dean’s leg .
Neither Cas nor Dean spoke for a while. Both worked on processing that conversation. One of the things that Dean liked that also put him on edge was Cas was more open with his emotions and saying things that always sent Dean’s mind spinning in his new human form. He was still quiet and reserved but these kinds of talks only ever used to happen when they were at a breaking point. Now, Cas will talk about his feelings more easily and Dean enjoyed hearing them.
Sam groaned a little before he moved to a sitting position and extended his arms to pick up Jack. As Sam pulled him up, he turned them slightly so Jack would be put into between Sam and Eileen on the bed. He started bouncing up and down again which caused his blonde hair to bounce too. Jack was beaming with excitement and Sam laughed before saying, “Hey bud, what’s up?”
He didn’t open the app until the following Saturday afternoon when the loneliness was particularly strong. The first five guys he swiped right on and matched with ended up pushing too much or sending unsolicited dick pics that Cas never asked for. He swiped for another hour before he came across the profile of Impala67 also known as Dean. His bio was straight forward. He was openly bisexual and looking for a fun time with either a guy or gal. He liked fast cars, bars, and hanging out with friends and family. Firmly no commitments/no strings attached but be a perfect gentleman during any casual hook-ups his bio claimed.
Cas’s eyes rolled to the back of his head as Cas went completely lifeless in his arms. They were really going to lose this fight after everything they had done and overcome. They were going to die blood stained and muddy in this field. Despair coursed through Dean in that moment when he realized he won’t be able to give Cas the hunter’s funeral he deserves.
Sam looked at the room again. The occupied dresser nearby had a succulent resting on the top and a radio/clock combination. Only one bedside table had a lamp on it. Sam walked over and opened the drawer to the bedside table on his side and found the drawer mostly empty. It only had a pad of paper, a pen, an unopened packet of Kleenex, and a flashlight. Dean said it would be empty for them to use but this was barren.
Two weeks and two days ago, Jack scared them half to death. His breathing became labored suddenly. His little face turned beat red from crying in fright as he struggled to breathe in Cas’s arms right in front of Dean. The escalation had happened in a matter of minutes although Dean recognized the now mostly human kid seemed more tuckered out than normal that day but they hadn’t expected this. All day Jack had been whinier, his colic reared its ugly head, and he struggled to get comfortable. It finally accumulated into a final show leaving Jack gasping for breaths. Desperate, they prayed to Hannah and the other angels when Jack’s breathing took a turn for the worse.
“Want some of my famous hot chocolate?” Cas shot out when he opened the door. Snow flakes stuck to Dean’s long eye lashes from the December snowfall and Cas had never seen a man so beautiful.
Dean thought maybe he should rest a little too. Just a little bit longer. The back of his eyelids sure were interesting. His thoughts slowed-
Cas picked a path after neither of them could find the words to ease the uncomfortable situation. The windmill came into view and as they approached the garden nearby. Cas paused in the garden and appeared to catalog things for a moment. Dean watched closely as he touched a sunflower before moving to squint at the windmill in the setting sun. He watched for a few minutes before coming to stand by Dean and they silently proceeded to the road.
Knowing how much Cas detested it, Dean never brought it up with him. Sam and Dean had talked about it extensively on the other hand. It was clearly Cas’s own wing that had burned his arm, Lucifer never experienced the fall of the angels and his wings, while weakened and imperfect, were not nearly in as rough shape as Cas’s. Plus, the position from where the two angels had fallen left that as the only option.
The largest and least damaged feather of the four nestled from the back of Cas’s bicep and curled around to the elbow. Even though Dean knew that it was an imprint, he almost felt that if he looked at this feather close enough he could see it come to life. He also knew deep in his soul that if that feather was real that it would be stunning. One the rare occasion Cas was wearing just a t-shirt, the tip of the feather would peek out.
Or that had been the plan until Dean got called in for an emergency meeting with his team and a big name client. Dean insisted on dropping Cas off at his apartment despite it being completely out of the way of his firm. Dean gave Cas another kiss outside his apartment door.
The nod came slowly from Claire before Dean forced himself away from her and Dean felt himself for the second time in six months being pushed forward. His knee creaked and complained immediately. Dean ignored the pain as his leg adjusted to him trying to run when he took off after Cas, slower but still in pursuit.
“Really Cas? You still think it’s a good idea for you to move out on your own,” Dean asked without bothering to disguise his disgust for the plan. Charlie may have been right about Jack growing up in the bunker but there had to be a better plan than what was happening.
“Kline was all Jack had left of Kelly and you took that away from him. I know you didn’t like Kelly that much but frankly the disrespect-”
Jack was his normal happy baby self. The only time he was in his crib or play pen was when he was sleeping which made Cas and Dean’s lives easier. His colic had been no joke and one night was spent with Jack sleeping in Dean’s arms to keep the baby happy. Every other second of the day he was being held by someone. Jody, Donna, and Claire started it. Over the days Alex, Charlie, and Kaia even once held Jack. Jack was getting so much attention that he was having more grace-fueled accidents as well. Lights flickered and blew when Jack laughed too hard. Books were thrown more frequently. Wind gusts were a new thing that began happening when Donna blew raspberries against Jack’s stomach.
Cas still hadn’t put Jack down. Jack had swung back and forth between fitfully resting in Cas’s arms fussily hanging out, clearly not over whatever had distressed him the first time.  Cas couldn’t seem to soothe him no matter how much he tried. Dean offered to take him at one point but Cas shook his head and told him to keep taking care of Charlie.
Matt gave Dean a fist bump and waved at Cas who was working with a customer who had just arrived. It shocked Sam to see Dean being so openly affectionate with someone Sam didn’t know but knowing how soft Dean had gotten the last few years made sense.
Cas asked the occasional question about pressure and pain every time Dean moved or shifted. Overall, the feeling was nice and he could feel his muscles relaxing. Cas slowly moved the circles up his leg and by the time it hit his mid-thigh the only thing Dean could think of was Cas’s hand being on him and how nice it felt.
He was ready to get back into the fray with this shrill woman when a soft hand grabbed his elbow preventing him from stepping forward into her space. Dean looked back and Cas was looking at him with a soft and concerned expression. The fight and anger drained away from his body and bone-tired weariness swept over his entire body instantly. When Cas met Dean’s eyes, a soothing calmness washed over him and the pain went from a thunderous roar to a dull ache.
"I guess I didn't. That's a story in itself. Maybe after we eat dinner we can talk about that one. Its even longer."
Dean had always hated crowds and their new friends had only been there week. He liked everybody so far and they all seemed relatively nice. He even connected with a few people. Perla and her friend Helen were experts in the kitchen and were just sweet older ladies who Dean loved. He copied every recipe Perla made taking special care to copy those that Cas, Eileen, and Sam enjoyed. The first recipe was the pancake recipe. Perla was going to remain at the bunker as all three of her adult children and their partners decided to be hunters. She was hesitant at first to share family secrets but opened up quickly sensing Dean’s eagerness and taught Dean tips of the trade that had been passed down generations in her family.  Perla introduced her son David and his fiancé Carl who everyone got along great with Dean due to their shared love of Classic Rock and old movies.
Dean’s bad days caused him to lie in bed or on the lumpy couch Cas had picked up from the local thrift store withering in pain. Most days, the pain in his leg ranged from a barely noticeable hum to teeth-gritting tolerable. Every great once and while though, a day would come that would completely rock him to his core. He would feel like he was being broken from the inside or that he was back on the rack in Hell. A literal waking nightmare.
“So Sam please tell me, how are we going to get Jack’s grace? Knick his neck to get what we need? Every time we need more to keep the portal open we just reopen that wound to get a little more until the garrison comes and takes Jack away from all of us? Great plan, Sam really,” Cas said sarcastically.
One of the last moves had Dean lying on his back with his feet hanging off the side of the bed. Dean was supposed to bend his knee and draw it closer to his chest. Theoretically, he would be able to do this in the future but most likely needed a partner right now to get even a quarter of the way there.
So now they were bickering about who would go where. There simply wasn’t enough bodies for where they were needed to be according to Sam. Rowena had gotten annoyed with their talk and hung up after getting a list of ingredients.
“Honestly, I don’t remember but I don’t think so. This looks nothing like the place we grabbed the angels.”
The anger inside of Dean was very much alive because being angry was better than allowing the fear he felt to manifest. Dean brushed off jeans and straightened his brace. His knee hurt from kneeling so much. Dean desperately wanted to ask if Cas was planning on going with angels at the end of the week. When he looked back up, Cas was still looking at him. Dean met his eyes and swallowed slowly.  He nodded his head accepting the apology and started to walk away.
For the first time, Cas seemed to lack answers. Dean patiently waited for Cas to respond but Cas instead focused on Jack with concentration. Sensing that Cas didn’t know were to begin, Dean spoke slowly.
Dean then wandered to check the infirmary expecting to find a sleeping Charlie. When he had entered the room, he was shocked to find the bed empty. He was more shocked when a metal bed pan cracked him on the back and sent him stumbling forward. Dean turned quickly and dodged a punch. He let years of hunter’s instincts and a rush of adrenaline wash over him. He had not expected to find an enraged red-head intent on kicking ass.
Once the pain began to recede and he became more comfortable, Dean would sit there being washed in waves of shame and embarrassment. Dean felt shame from being so weak he was unable to handle simple leg pain. If his dad could see him breaking so easily in the comfort of his own home, he would have been sure to give Dean a lecture while calling him every name in the book in an effort to toughen him up. Dean had lasted thirty years being tortured in Hell but couldn’t last five hours on his own couch with a bum leg. John Winchester would ask what kind of man he was with the familiar sneer of disappointment and anger that Dean remembered seeing often.
“You know I wouldn’t lie about that. That’s why there are only ten of us here today. You no longer have grace. Another few are in the wind somewhere on Earth last time we checked. The rest that are in Heaven have to remain so otherwise it would crumble.”
Ever since the bunker was attacked, changes have been happening at an alarming rate. Dean struggles to handle the ups and downs until someone close to him announces an even bigger change. One Dean wasn't prepared for in the slightest.
Dean knew she was right someone would have to take the grace and run. Dean turned around the room and immediately took in the people in front of him.  It had to be him. He wasn’t going to let anyone here risk a demon ambush. It meant almost certain death and losing the grace but it would save the others.
Dean began to make his way from the end of the hallway towards the lower level of the home. The floorboards creaked underneath the ugly carpet as Dean pushed himself further. He pushed himself faster. He needed to be faster.
“Dean, Jack was the one who opened the rift. Now, I’m going to opening it. How am I supposed to get it to the exact same spot to pick them up. Archangels have intent even the little wee munchkin you have gallivanting about. You can’t expect me to open a portal to random spot in the woods in a world I haven’t seen. This isn’t good Dean.”
First, this chapter was designed to feel like a rollercoaster while I smack you in the head with a skillet. The timeline for this is a little sporadic. It is primarily set in February, March and April with flashbacks everywhere in between and slightly before so pay close attention. Don't worry, this is the only chapter like this if the timeline doesn't make sense. The other chapters are a lot more linear.
Jack began to stir in the backseat causing Dean and Cas to finally get out of the car and back into the house. Some incoherent babble from Jack eased anxiety from reentering the house that they had left in a hurry and brought smiles to both Dean and Cas’s faces.  Dean only had to make two trips from the car to get everything inside while Cas worked on feeding Jack and changing his diaper.
“Yeah, well anything would have been than you coming here and offering you two up like that. That was an idiot move. You could have gotten you and Jack killed or kidnapped,” Dean snapped.
“Can we agree not to lie to each other anymore? Not when I can clearly see you’re in pain with my own eyes,” Cas angrily retorted.
Despite Cas seeming to enjoy most things about being human and adjusting to the normalcy of his new life, sometimes Dean was forced to watch Cas mourn his fall. About once a week, Cas grew quiet. Dean recognized the shift his demeanor. Cas would ask Dean to watch Jack for “a while” without meeting Dean’s eyes. Dean would nod and then it would be hours of silence as Cas disappeared into the shadows of the bunker. Cas never brought up what brought it on and Dean didn’t ask. Soon enough, Cas would be back to sitting on the couch next to him laughing at Schitt’s Creek along with Dean.
A feeling of relief swept over Dean. He relaxed and rolled his shoulders to smooth out the tension. The heater of the Impala hummed as the conflict eased.
Well no, what Bobby had actually said was, “Don’t get your panties in a twist. I’ve been helping hunters longer than you’ve been alive, boy. I think I can manage them for a week.”
Dean looked down unable to meet Cas’s eyes. He felt a small burn of shame. For some reason, Dean felt bad for upsetting Cas. For a split second, he thought about telling Cas the reason why he stopped taking the pain meds came from all that time to think on the night he went for a drive. Then, he remembered he was the one who was supposed to be pissed and Cas had exactly zero rights to feel any anger about the situation he put them in. Dean looked up sharply and meet Cas’s eyes with an equally pissed gaze.
At the hospital, a paramedic explained that Cas had been hit by foul ball when he hadn’t been paying attention. They were worried Cas would have a concussion or worse so they brought him to the emergency room when he got knocked out. Ketch had been grossed out by whole ordeal and left an unconscious Cas to the paramedics.
The resulting injuries were a few broken ribs, a femur broken in three places, and a shattered knee Dean would learn much later. In the moment, it felt like his leg was being cut open and someone was pouring burning lava into him while tasing him relentlessly. The only thing that existed in that moment was unimaginable pain until Dean heard sudden loud gasp for breath which drew him back.
Mackenzie spoke slowly, “Dean, I completely forgot. You’ll need a pen. There should be one in the drawer.”
Eileen gasped next to him and Mary brought her hand up to cover her mouth. Hannah cast her eyes downward and Balthazar’s bravado faltered. The angels all took another step back. Dean looked at Sam who was shifting his jaw and staring at the floor. Donna rubbed a tear away and Jody rubbed Donna’s shoulder with her own eyes watering.
“I’ll have to talk to Cas and we have family in town but I don’t think we have much going on this week.”
Another punch aimed at the other side of his face and Dean grabbed the arm this time and twisted so Charlie’s back was to him. Dean wrapped his arm around her midsection and tugged her into his chest so she was locked against him.
One of the nurses called from the local doctor’s office not long after they got done talking with Sam and Eileen to let Dean and Cas know that Dr. Hines had secured an appointment with Dr. Stern the town doctor the following day. That got Dean’s mind spinning in a whole different direction.
“I’ll see you later. Probably won’t be until late tonight so don’t feel like you have to wait up. I would love to come inside and say hi to Sattler and Malcolm but if I did I would never leave.”
Jack’s breathing improved steadily over the following few hours thanks to the nebulizer. The poor kid was still tired even after the episode. The crowded hallways and active bustle of the bunker were too much so Dean and Cas spent their time in Dean’s quiet room watching movies. Honestly, they mostly watched Jack that day.
When Dean finally made it the kitchen, he was still grouchy. He ached all over and he was bone-tired. Jack had screamed loud enough last night to wake him up despite being a few doors down with Cas. He had gotten up to check on the pair and found Jack wailing.
Still, doubt was planted in his mind. He watched Cas and Dean carefully that morning from where he sat at the dining room table. They acted normally. Rather, they acted like normal Cas and Dean. The conversation was smooth and casual. Dean made biscuits and gravy and Cas set the table with Jack’s help. The smell of the gravy that had been cooking for hours filled the lower level and Sam felt his stomach roll in anticipation.
Relief spread over Sam’s face instantly. Sam probably thought Dean just needed a night away to clear his head. He retreated with a smile. Dean clicked the door shut and locked it a few minutes later. He didn’t go to Story Time. He didn’t tuck Jack into bed like he usually did. When Cas came knocking on the door around 8PM, he let the knocks fade away slowly. Sam took all the energy from him and he no longer felt up to looking Cas in the face.
When Cas didn’t move another muscle, Dean slammed the hood shut in frustration. He leaned against it and gripped the truck with force to keep from getting in Cas’s face. He and Cas were playing chicken again and Dean was not going to swerve this time. He pressed the theoretic gas down.
His leg was stiff and throbbing which Dean added to the Not-Heaven list. Unless Heaven was needlessly cruel in forcing Dean to still have to deal with a bum leg. The brace creaked as he stood and Dean noticed the second band on his thigh appeared to have lost the a loop resulting in that part being loose. Good thing the brace was black because if he squinted at it too much he would definitely notice more blood than he was truly comfortably with. Heaven was seeming less like a possibility every second.
“Jack was born May 18th so he’s about 3 and a half months old. He’s really starting to enjoy shapes and colors. You should see him with the mobile that Dean hung above his crib. I don’t have a video of that but I promise, it was cute.”
The map eventually showed him heading back to the house. Cas came back that night shaken and wanting to be alone. Dean practically lectured him not to leave like that again without at least telling him. He hadn’t known where Cas had gone and spent the day worried. Cas nodded in agreement, not meeting Dean’s eyes before heading for the stairs.
“Oh,” was all Dean could say. He hadn’t even thought of any of that it at the time. Mentally, Dean had already moved in which was a problem. A problem for later. Much later.
Charlie threw her head back and it connected with his chin. Dean grip released just enough for her to squirm from his grasp. She took off to the other side of the room and picked up a broom and began to brandish it like a bat. Dean held up his hands.
Cas and Dean seemed to be well and genuinely happy with this small, ordinary life. It was such a contrast to just three years ago when Jack was born, Cas fell and became human, and Dean’s life alternating injury forced him to retire. Despite all of that and everything they went through, Dean, Cas, and Jack had turned a house as broken as them into a home.
Blood was trickling Cas’s mouth now and a gurgling sound as Cas began to drown in his own blood was added to the shallow breaths. The pain from his leg was unbearable but the sudden fear of losing Cas suffocated him beyond comparison. He began to crawl his way to Cas.
Dean watched Cas turned his head to glare at the wall and bite the inside of his cheek to keep whatever retort from escaping. He looked mad and Dean could sense his mood souring. Energized by this Dean decided to poke at Cas even more.
Dean gasped at the realization he didn’t know where Cas was. He turned his head to the side in preparation to pull himself to his feet on his good side to search when he saw Cas next to him. Panic set in for a moment before the rhythmic rise and fall of his chest assured Dean that he was in fact sleeping soundly next to him. They were together and that could mean only one thing.
Next to Duma and closest to them stood Hannah. She had been the first angel they had plucked from the void and while Dean never met her second vessel he still recognized her. Sam had once told Dean that Hannah’s new vessel was handsome when Dean had asked about how Cas and Hannah had gotten along after everything that had gone down between them. Sam was wrong; the vessel was way handsomer than he had said. He hadn’t noticed it when they grabbed Hannah first but Dean sure noticed it now. Hannah looked at Dean briefly with some interest and no malice. When her eyes moved to Cas, she smiled brightly. There was a lot of affection in her eyes and it instantly chaffed Dean a little.
Mackenzie kept rolling, “I was even more shocked to find out you had died in a hail of bullets. But you didn’t obviously because you’re very much alive and somehow my patient. I thought about going to the police and telling them. But something was off. It didn’t seem like the Dean Winchester I have known for the last three months. So, I kept digging.”
“Nothing’s gonna happen. You and Sam are both down the hall if it becomes to much. Trust me, Jack and I will be fine for the night.
Mentally, Dean split the room into factions. His faction was Sam, Eileen, Cas, Jody, Donna, and Mary. Rowena had left late two nights before without fanfare siting self-preservation. Jack was the cute little mascot in the onesie Claire had bought him a while back. It said, “Wrap me like a burrito”. He liked their side. Every person on his side he would trust with his life.
Dean nodded in understanding. The metaphor wasn’t deep and Mackenzie didn’t seem like the type of girl who needed two people for a conversation.
She hated Ishim. Anytime his then-boyfriend had been over Cas had been forced to lock her in the laundry room when they stayed at his place. He should have known what kind of person Ishim was sooner. He thought he caught him trying to kick her once, but he said he was just shooing her away. She peed on his briefcase a few days later and that was the last time Ishim stayed over. She was the reason Cas and Ishim never moved in together.
“The house we looked at today. It was perfect for Cas and Jack but they can’t move there without me to help and fix the house. I can’t go with him though. I have duties here. To Sam and the organization. I need to be here just as much as I need to be there.”
“Nah, Sam we’re good. It will be quicker if we do it ourselves. This is your vacation, enjoy it before someone calls to say that they found a vampire wendigo combo or some other weird shit. We’ll see you at 2, if you don’t make your way back here before.”
It hadn’t crossed Sam’s mind. He was flying blind here for the first time. He was a man who liked plans and schedules but didn’t have a single one for the upcoming week besides be at the farmhouse with family. Cas and Dean had invited them out so they could enjoy the festivities as the town locals celebrated their Home Town week that had fun activities for everyone to do. He knew very little about the town his brother and Cas had settled into. Most of it he had heard from Dean or Cas and trusted them to show Eileen and him around as they saw fit.
Cas was directed to follow the nurses on duty to the back who had stopped everything to help them. That was where Jack would be immediately seen. A small hand stopped Dean in his tracks. The nurse running the check-in asked him to fill out an intake form. It wouldn’t take long she promised when Dean cast a worried glance after Cas. He watched Cas disappear through the doors and nodded in acceptance. Dean swallowed down the feeling of fear and tried to clear his mind.
A look of suspicion and concern crossed Sam's face when Dean didn't respond. "Why? Are you feeling okay?"
They proceeded to spend the next hour trying and somewhat succeeding in convincing Jack to walk some more. He never got very far but Dean still took videos and was sending them to Sam, Eileen, and Mary as things unfolded while Cas cheered him on. At the end of the hour, Jack had lost interest with walking and was much more interested in eating his hands. Cas picked Jack up to take him to the kitchen for snack when he turned and met Dean’s eyes. Their silent conversation was of pure happiness at Jack’s first steps. They really could do this whole raising a kid together and it felt damn good.
“Thank you, Dean. For what it’s worth, I’ll always miss being an angel but… I think I’m finally happy being human.”
Cas must have sensed his unease because he cast him a sympathetic glance. Dean met his eyes before returning his attention back to Jack who began to fuss again when Dean got distracted. If colic was a person, Dean would kick their ass.
“This is not up for debate. You would do the same for us. After the brace is on, Sam and I are going to round up any booze we can find in this bunker and we are dumping it down the drain while you sober up. You will start taking your pain pills and tomorrow one of us is going to schedule your physical therapy appointment. Then, tomorrow night you will join Sam for dinner because Eileen is planning on making dinner. Then, you’ll attend story time with Jack and me. If we have to, we will start checking to make sure the brace is fitted properly in the morning and at night whether you want us to or not. Dean, we want you well and if we have to fight you for it, then I have some bad news because you are very outnumbered. Maybe instead of using your stubborn Winchester genes to be difficult, let us help you.”
Every Wednesday, neighbors would move their trash cans and recycle bins to the curb for trash day. Every Wednesday evening Bruiser would tackle every trash can and recycle bin he would come across on his evening walk. Dean would hastily collect anything that fell out (trash and recyclables were collected in the morning thankfully but sometimes one or two were accidentally skipped) and right the trash can. Well, as much he could anyway. Bruiser would tackle it immediately once it was upright again.
“Rowena, please,” Dean pleaded. Rowena looked at Jack for a moment before swallowing and nodding.  She glanced longingly at the rift one more time before moving to the books at the end of the table.
“Hey Dean, Melissa said Dev was coming soon, why don’t we take the kids and go check on them?” Matt suggested uneasily as the tension approached a snapping point. Cas came back to the table then and met Dean’s eyes with a look of concern.
Jack had been getting antsy in the grocery store check-out line and the Karen (a term Claire had taught them) in front of them was harassing some poor teenage clerk about an expired coupon. Sassy Cas came out in defense of the poor kid with a biting retort about manners and a glare that would have smited Karen on the spot if Cas had been powered up.
“Cas, you gonna tell me what you meant?” Dean asked as he tried to pry more answers out of the passenger side.
Dr. Hines made a few more notes before letting the clipboard fall to his side and meeting Dean’s eyes, “It’s still a too early to tell what is going on with Jack. We checked his airway and that was clear so nothing appears to be physically blocking the airflow like piece of a toy for example. His airway is severely swollen and did have some mucus which I suspect was causing the wheezing and shortness of breath that you both observed. If his symptoms were truly as bad as you both describe, then a variety of possibilities exist. Right now, he is resting comfortably in the incubator which is acting as both a nebulizer and oxygen machine. I’m suspecting that Jack has had breathing issues before because of the nebulizer, am I correct?”
“Because it’s not real! We don’t get the chance to embrace our loved ones again. If I were to die right now, I would never get to see my sons again. I wouldn’t get to see Cas or Jack or Eileen again. I wouldn’t get to know more about any of their lives after I pass. I would be trapped for all eternity in memories angels deem happy but you don’t seem to have a grasp on what being happy actually means. Those memories were devastating.”
“I can walk asshole. No need to push,” Eileen said with a sneer as the three angels and two women were escorted out of the room. Charlie was thrown over one of the angel’s shoulder and Dean knew immediately that her stitches had likely ripped open.
Eileen shrugged at Sam when he raised his eyebrows in an unspoken “Are you doing this?” She put the hat on her head and started to slide the flannel on. Next to Sam, Dean was already dressed with the netting rolled down and everything and he had gone back to looking at Cas who was still helping the bees into the hive while he gathered the extra supplies. Seeing his one and only chance, Sam set his pile of stuff down on the tailgate, whipped out his phone, and began taking pictures of Dean who looked ridiculous in his getup. Sam snickered and was already mentally planning the extensive list of who he would send the picture to which was everyone and everybody.
Four months after adopting him, Bruiser found his sworn enemy at a newly purchased house just four doors down from Dean. The flimsy, yellow recycle bin with yellow bees and the quote "Bee Friendly!" painted on the side deserved the wrath of God Bruiser had decided. Bruiser didn't just want to tackle this bin. He sought to destroy it.
It didn’t take long to deduce over a lunch of sandwiches that they were looking for Jack too. Jack’s more frequent outbursts of grace acted like a homing signal for angels so it only made sense that demons may be drawn to it if they had orders to find it. They renewed the demon wards after lunch before gathering in the library to let the final hours tick by until 5pm.
The third week, Dean walked on the other side of the street but Bruiser still growled as they passed.
Cas disrupted his thoughts by speaking, “Dean, I’ll make you a deal. Let me keep Jack tonight because I’m feeling lonely and to say thanks I’ll help you with your physical therapy.”
The thought didn’t necessarily make him sad. After all, he had died more times than they could truly count but this was different somehow. What made him sad was realizing that he didn’t get to say goodbye to Sam, Eileen, Mary, or Jack. Or any of the friends he had abandoned in the library.
Cas didn’t fall for the bait and rolled his eyes at Dean’s antics, “You were never the last resort. I’ll wait and walk with you, Dean.”
“You don’t have to make a decision right now. Just promise me you’ll think about it. Really think about coming with Jack and me,” Cas’s eyes bore into him. He looked timid but hopeful too. It was like Cas was worried about rejection.
Cas squinted in disbelief, “Is that a 'Nah, I’m good' because you ate the muffin or a 'Nah, I’m good' because you’re going to eat half of mine like you did last time?”
Cas shrugged noncommittally so Dean pressed, “Cas, I need input here. Yes, no, maybe. I’m not building this fake life alone. You get a fresh start.”
Dean spit a mouthful of blood onto the floor before he responded, “Nah, don’t really feel up to it at the moment. Think I’d like to lie down and take a nap if you’re offering.”
“Nah, think I’ll stretch my legs before I have to sit in this chair for an hour. Jaq, do you care if Cat comes with me?”
Dean thought. He could admit that maybe good wasn’t the word for it but it was better than the past few days. Yet, Dean and his stupid leg had ruined it.
Dean wasn’t prepared for how different the exercises felt at home versus the office earlier. Dean was supposed to do the bulk of the work. Cas’s job was to support and guide Dean through the movement according to the bubbly physical therapist. When Mackenzie had been showing Cas where to place his hands and how to do the movements, Dean had barely noticed. Now he noticed every touch. It was much more intimate alone in Dean’s quiet room together and Dean didn’t quite know what to make of it. His online searches pinged in his head.
Sparing another glance up and down the makeshift aisle, Dean responded with a smile as he turned on the charm, “Just looking for someone. First time here and already getting turned around.”
Dr. Ellie Sattler was the exact opposite of Ian Malcolm. Cas had adopted her from the same shelter three years after Ian Malcolm. He met her while dropping off a donation of gently used toys and perusing the cats available for adoption. He felt bad leaving Ian Malcolm alone all day at work and when he was spending nights away with his boyfriend.
When the video finished, Mackenzie placed her hand on Dean’s shoulder and said, “Jack is so precious. You’re both very lucky.”
“Dating. You don’t date. Maybe that’s what I should do. It didn’t work out with Ishim and I dated him for four years. Caught feelings for you even though you don’t want date me. Tried to go on a date with another guy and got hit in the head. Baseball is right too. Three strikes and you’re out.”
Dean felt himself fading quickly too but he raised his head to see Billie approach them through the storm. She clearly had been waiting for the sphere to disappear. The silhouettes that Dean could see through the dark sky and storm remained in their fallen positions. He couldn’t make out any of their faces and most of his sight in any direction more than ten feet away was distorted by the steady rain. Dark shadows danced nearby and Dean wondered how long it would be before the demons were upon them.
“I don’t know, Dean. Probably the ER. He’s human now so I think they would be best suited to help him. Angels can’t fix this. Nobody at the bunker can fix this. He needs a real doctor.”
Cas accompanies Dean and Bruiser for the rest of their walk after disposing of the remains of the murdered recycle bin. Bruiser carries his stolen piece of the yellow bee recycle bin with great pride and only knocks the occasional trash can over as they make their way back to Dean’s house. Conversation flows easier the more they talk and they seem to hit it off. Cas laughs as Dean works to straighten up the bulldog’s path of destruction and Dean laughs when Cas recounts Sam’s first loud conservation in his garden.
There were two hardware stores in town: the big box store and the local one called Jefferson’s and Sons’ Hardware. Dean preferred the local one despite its use of apostrophes. Sure, the big box store offered anonymity but the local hardware store felt cozy and made Dean feel calmer. More adjusted to normal life. They were trying to assimilate after all and they needed to do the best they can. If the local store didn’t have what they needed, then they would need to swing by the other but Dean was trying to make as few as stops as possible because he wanted to be outside and take a long drive if time permitted.
The receptionist came in to check on Mackenzie, Dean, and Cas and ask if they needed to set up another appointment when the end of the appointment came. Mackenzie seemed to remember then why Dean and Cas were in her office in the first place.
Suddenly, the rift began to shimmer. Dean rose quickly and leveled his gun at the rift. He saw two guns on his right raise out the corner of his eye take aim as well. Mary stepped forward into his left periphery and took a stance beside him. Cas was still behind him holding Jack so Dean shifted a little more to cover him more completely.
Sam nodded immediately, “We still have people to find beds for tonight plus make sure everyone got their medications and treated for any injuries. You guys are probably tired. Let’s talk tomorrow. “
Chancing another look, Dean glanced back and focused on it. It was a bright and glowing orb glowing iridescent black, various blues, rich purples, and a few greens. It spun fast and steady. Cas drew his attention back to the task asking Dean to help him hold the angels with their shared grace.
Dean started talking before Sam could, “We need to sit down and debrief about everything that happened and how everyone did their piece of the pie but can we just enjoy the win tonight and do everything tomorrow?
Just over thirty remained in the bunker to train with Sam. The others had enough experience they were free to set up shop wherever they wanted and would be dispatched as needed as cases started to flow. He had decided to make sure that the hunters that remained were well-trained enough they wouldn’t get hurt or worse. They would know exactly how to react to each monster and the best methods to take it down. Charlie was even working on rigging a camera system that hunters would wear for training and safety purposes.
Turns out, Jack really enjoyed the sound of his voice almost as much as he liked Cas’s. Dean started talking to Jack about anything he could think of during his progressively longer hours of babysitting duty. All the rooms he would take him to when the cast finally came off and they could move about freely, the best cartoons (Scooby-Doo was the best and Jack agreed), car care, and even the misadventures of the former Team Free Will (PG of course, little ears were listening).
His one job his entire life had been to protect Sam and for the very first time Dean was truly unable to. That was an adjustment that caused more than one yelling match between the two brothers that Cas and Eileen would have to come in the middle of. Cas would drag Dean to another room and Eileen would force Sam to focus on her. The fallen angel would listen to Dean if he wanted to rant or distract Dean when he wanted to stew in his own self-pity. Dean would almost always start it but Sam was always the first to apologize even when it wasn’t his fault. Good to know somethings never changed.
Cas had said back then. Memories that were not his but from Cas’s call let even more pieces click into place. Dean had thought he had been talking about rebelling and free will at the time. Turns out, it wasn’t. Cas did everything he could to try to save Dean and even Sam from harm. A little misguided but it came from a place of love and self-sacrifice.
He was more than just crushing on Dean now. Cas was falling in love with the man. The man who he had started having affection for simply because he was nice to his cat. Dean was so much more than that though. He was thoughtful and generous. He cared about his younger brother’s education enough not to drag his hook-ups back to his apartment. Dean would open doors for Cas, share his food, and try to act like the gentleman he claimed to be. He always answered Cas’s calls or messages. Cas would have to fight to pay for their dinners or even his share of the food because Dean would insist on paying every time. Once when Cas forgot a jacket on one of their excursions, Dean gave him his so he wouldn’t be cold. He asked Cas’s opinion on movies so he would only bring over ones he thought Cas would like.
“Yeah," Dean lied knowing he was the one that finished the jar, "so feel free to go and get some. Everything will be fine.”
It didn’t sound like the now version of Cas. The now version who laughed with Sam and Eileen at comic strips or created characters voices during story time or whispered words of encouragement during physical therapy. He sounded like he had when they had first met back when he was brainwashed and following Heaven’s orders to try to convince Dean to say yes to Michael. Cas shifted Jack across his body to the opposite side so Dean couldn’t see him anymore and Cas dropped his hand down to his side.
Sam continued talking when they didn’t respond, “Listen, you’ll have four days to come up with a better plan if you don’t like this one. I would rather not use Jack either. I would never do anything to hurt him or put him in danger. You know how much I love him but I think this is the best chance we have for saving all the people from dying in the other world and protecting Jack from being a pawn. Promise me you’ll think about it.”
Naomi studied Dean’s face moment longer before she turned to address the angels, “Go lock them one of the rooms. We need to make sure we aren’t interrupted.”
Only once did Dean not take Bruiser on his evening walk on trash day and it was then that he discovered another one of Bruiser’s “quirks”. When the bulldog had figured out he wasn’t getting a walk that evening, he started screaming bloody murder and did not stop until Dean picked up the leash.
All these quirks were manageable and, frankly, a little cute if Dean were being honest. Sam and Dean had discussed them each at length and they couldn't believe Bruiser was as much trouble as the shelter seemed to think he was. Dean didn't understand how two families had returned Bruiser after less than two weeks in each home.
SAM HAD BEEN THE ONE TO SUGGEST DEAN GO WITH CAS IN THE ORIGINIAL “TAKE JACK AND RUN PLAN” BEFORE IT ALL WENT TO SHIT.
Light explode when Jack laughed too loud? The faulty wiring was to blame. Books falling of the shelves when Jack started crying? Another example of weird bunker shit. Thankfully, exploded light bulbs and flying books seemed to be the extent of the damage. Nothing too big had happened since Jack’s birth.
They pulled them through the black tar this time from the sky downwards, barely breaching the surface. This time it felt like Dean was suffocating as they crawled upside down to the surface and pulled the sleeping angels with them. His lungs burned as they crawled through the thickening tar. The grace diminished again Dean was able to note as his vision switched back to their bodies.
“What did you just say?” Sam asked out loud. His hands refused to work and he could barely speak English let alone sign.
“No, you’re not.” Cas paused. Cas shook his head and Dean looked down shamefully. When Dean finally met his eyes again, the messy room around him faded and the only thing he saw was blue eyes full of concern. The room around him stopped spinning when he focused on meeting Cas’s eyes and Cas began speaking again.
Naomi eyes flashed in irritation, and she looked at Charlie on the table before he waved her hands for the angels to take Eileen and Charlie away. One of the angels holding Eileen pushed her forward in a gesture for her to lead while the other gripped her arm tightly.
Cas smiles even wider, “Good to know you weren’t going to skip out our date tonight. Sam warned me that you were unsure if you wanted to go at all but now that you owe me dinner, I’m almost positive that you’ll show up.”
Matt opened his mouth to answer before his brow furrowed together and his mouth was hanging open because he didn’t know their names. Wanting to save the poor guy, Sam quickly spoke up, “My name is Sam and this is my partner, Eileen. We ran into Matt a few minutes ago.”
The look Cas gave him reeked of sadness and guilt. Dean wanted to tell him it wasn’t because of him but because Dean’s brain decided to flash through every time he saw Cas die and he hurt his own feelings as Claire and Alex would say. A car honked at Dean for plodding along in the left lane so Dean switched lanes and focused on Cas again.
Cas began approaching Dean with his shoulders slumped forward from across the kitchen when Dean remembers hearing Jack cry out several times last night while Dean tossed and turned. Little guy had a powerful set of lungs that echoed in the bunker. Last night and most of the nights before that likely resulted in Cas having to wake up every few hours since they got to the bunker. Cas usually brushed off Mary and Sam’s offers to watch Jack overnight. If Dean was remembering correctly, it had been almost five days since Cas got a break. Poor dude was getting little to no sleep.
Naomi turned and walked out gesturing for all the angels to follow her. The angel holding Dean released his grip and followed Naomi out. Dean’s scalp prickled from where the angel had dug his nails in and the bleeding on his throat had stopped. He rubbed his neck just to make sure.
Naomi looked at Dean as she finished her spiel. Dean understood the threat. Any wards of protection or killing angels to defend Jack means that all the people they lost would be the first to suffer. His dad, Bobby, their Charlie, Ellen, Jo, Pamela… the list went on and on. Dean nodded once before Naomi turned back towards Cas.
Fear and embarrassment ripped through Dean like a bolt of lightning. He was so freaking stupid. Of course, Cas would be angry and he had every right to be. Pretending to be married on the Jack’s forms when Cas obviously didn’t want to be was a big step over the line of their friendship. They should have spent more time planning like Cas had wanted.
Cas had come to the door as the hunters filed out and caught Dean. People bumped into them as they pushed to get out of the narrow door and Dean was just happy that Cas seemed to be taking less of the brunt of the diminishing crowd. Dean turned a little more so Cas would get bumped less.
Dean had tried to talk to Cas every time he emerged to use the bathroom or get some food but he was met with stony silence or passive aggressive comments. It had been two months since Cas’s last emotional episode and this one felt rougher than normal. When Claire called to ask them to cover a weird case she found while she worked a vampire nest with Jody, Dean ended up literally dragging the new human out of his room because Sam was benched for the foreseeable future. Cas protested going until Dean said that he needed backup. It was clear Cas didn’t want to be anywhere near Dean which only soured his mood further.
Cas spoke next, “So the two problems we have are keeping Jack and his grace from the angels and getting the rebel camp to the portal in time to save everyone.”
“Duck eggs?” Sam asked curiously. He had heard the duck eggs were the new "it" egg. They had lots of health benefits and most were raised cage free and in better conditions than chickens which Sam thought was a step in the right direction. He had been considering switching.
“No, I will not let you deal with it. Your way of dealing with it is shove it down further until you lash out and I am not there to act as a buffer for when you get in a shitty mood. You need to apologize to Cas. To his face.”
Having finished his dinner while Cas ate, Dean was in the laundry room off the kitchen separating the load out when he heard Cas speak. Dean was still running at least four loads a week between Jack’s four outfits a day and Cas’s long sleeves and t-shirts. Neither of them drew attention to how Cas would sometimes have to change in the middle of the day now that the weather was warming up because Cas got sweaty faster.  Cas called out from the table that he would meet Dean in the living room when he was done.
The blonde angel stepped forward. She was beautiful in her white dress. Her skin was white like ivory. Her eyes shown bright and she looked intelligent. She reminded Dean of a predator. A wolf in sheepskin. She reeked of power.
Three weeks and five days ago is when everything started falling apart again. Dean should have known. He only gets little moments of joy before things come crashing down in a new problem he had to wrestle into submission. They should have stayed in that damn meadow.
After they loaded the fifteen plants Cas had deemed worthy, they stopped in a local dinner for a late lunch before taking a long drive away from the town with the windows rolled down.  The wind whipped through the Impala as Dean drove on and on before making the eventual turn home.
“Well, if we aren’t getting out of the car soon, what exactly would you like to do to pass the time?”
The air was thick as Sam, Dean, and Kathy waited there. He could feel Eileen, Natalie, and Matt watching from the side cautiously. Dean would look away before returning glares from the man.
“The doctor wants to speak with us together,” Cas said simply. His voice was rough like he had been screaming for hours even though he had barely said anything since they started the frantic drive here.
Anytime Sam mentioned his guilt from not visiting the farmhouse when they had first moved out, Dean would plan a visit for the bunker instead. Dean was always saying it was much easier for the retired hunter and former angel to visit them than it was for Sam to hand-over his responsibilities at the bunker. He drone on and on saying both of them missed their friends and they enjoyed catching up with everybody in person. Plus, Dean always mentioned how much he loved road trips, even ones as brief as the two-hour drive to the bunker. Dean, Cas, and Jack came for at least a few days almost monthly after moving out.
Eileen must have read his mind because she told them what happened. The stitches had partially ripped when Charlie had been roughly moved after the initial fight. Eileen had stitched Charlie back up while Dean and Cas had their standoff. When the standoff was over, one of the angels guarding Charlie and Eileen came in and healed her internal wounds, including her massive concussion, only in order to save her life not that long before Cas and Dean had arrived. The angel left the stitches and let the rest of the wound to heal naturally to conserve grace for their return to Heaven.
Turned out, there was a reason that they were wearing the semi-protective gear. When Cas and Dean moved the hive up the hill, a few of the bees not in the hive grew agitated at the sudden movement of the hive and the queen. None of them tried to sting but Cas said that this hive of bees was a calm one unlike their last pickup.
While Sam had been waking Eileen up, Dean had gone back to where they had stashed overnight bags by the door. He hadn’t said anything while waiting but Dean gave Sam the look he always gave him when he thought Sam and Eileen were being grossly cute: happy, a little proud, and very smug.
Brandon sighed loudly likely from having to watch his brother flirt with two married men. Dean grabbed the bags off the counter and started crowding Cas to get him to move towards the exit and out the door. Cas willingly went though he appeared slightly flustered at both Chad’s comment and Dean’s flurry of activity.
An hour later when Cas was able to get on his phone, Ketch had not called or texted to check on him. Cas was right about him being a pompous ass.
If he left, he would get to be with Jack and Cas. He would get watch Jack grow up. He would get to know more about this new version of Cas that Dean had become so secretly fond of. They would watch movies, hangout, and raise Jack.  They could be normal humans. Dean imagined a practical kitchen that was comfortable, unlike the bunker, where he would cook dinner. And God did he miss windows. The image of huge windows open to let in a breeze hit him. The thought of him, Cas, and Jack on the couch with the sunlight-
Billie stopped talking and her focus seemed to shift to something behind Dean, “Castiel, don’t you dare!”
Dean continued slowly as the heater in the Impala whined, “It’s not that I don’t want to honor Kelly. I know she meant a lot to you and she obviously loved Jack but we can’t keep him safe if they manage to trace back who his mother is because we slipped up and gave them the wrong last name. I picked Smith because it is simple, easy, and super common. It covers everything from Bel Air to Pocahontas.”
Sam didn’t have long to think about it before Jack trotted over to the sideline clutching a handful dandelions in his little fist.
Cas paused to consider for a moment before releasing the bottle to Dean with a great sigh. He slipped the burp rag off his shoulder and gently placed it on Dean’s left shoulder (gross). Cas rested his hand on the shoulder where the handprint all but faded away in a way to say thanks. This sent a buzz through Dean’s skin directly into his brain. Cas slowly retracted his hand and offered a small smile to Dean.
Jack began fussing even more.  Dean tried to soothe him and listen to Sam’s conversation at the same time. The lights flickered briefly.
“Fine, I said some things I shouldn’t have said when I was in pain alright. This is mine and Cas’s problem so let me deal with it without you interfering. “
As it turned out, Eileen had gone deep underground when the Men of Letters had been hunting her and the other American hunters. She had been one of their top priority kills after the unfortunate incident where she accidentally shot and killed that condescending British Man of Letters. They had gotten close a few times but the last time they had caught up to her she had come so close to losing her life. So Eileen disappeared entirely by faking her own death.
On Sam’s left, the dining room contained a sturdy, solid oak table with 6 matching chairs. Jack’s booster seat was strapped one. A simple chandelier lit up the room and the China cabinet sat in one corner not far away.  He knew the kitchen was connected to the dining room in the far-left corner of the house and the washer dry were tucked into a tiny laundry room under the backside of the stairs directly off the kitchen.
Dean’s eyes shot open and he looked up to meet Cas’s. Cas was alive and looking at him like he saw directly into his soul. The familiarity of the stare was comforting. Still as blue as he remembered too. His voice was rough and lower than normal from lack of use but it was still Cas’s.
Two figures emerged and stepped into their line of sight. Dressed in faded military fatigues and camouflage, Dean could see a man holding up a limp woman whose long read hair shielded her face. He was clearly struggling to keep her upright.
She looked around the room before landing on the grace vial on the table. Her eyes calculated something quickly. Billie turned her head back towards Dean and let her body language relax. She was trying to pass off the air of someone who didn’t truly care but her eyes were as hungry as a starving wolf. She spoke slowly and without much emotion, “How about this: Jack’s feeble life in this moment for that archangel grace-“
“Hey Rowena, tired of being the center of attention? I expected you to be out soaking up the spotlight for as long as possible,” Dean replied. It was the game they played, relentless teasing  to exasperation.
Jack would laugh and cackle at Dean’s funny voice and calm down when Dean used his soothing voice. Sometimes Jack would listen intently has Dean told a story or drift off to sleep when Dean used a quieter voice. Cas assured him that Jack didn’t understand what he was saying even with off the charts intelligence but the tones were what he picked up on. Dean didn’t care if Jack understood, he just cared that Jack was happy.
“Let’s put this in perspective. Nobody wants to live in memories; good or bad. You all saw some of Cas’s memories. You saw how much he cared for his friends and family. Do you want to stop him from making more memories even after he dies because it’s the easy way or would you want him be able to create more happy memories by spending time with the people he cares about?” Dean asked softly.
“Bobby, what if a few of us come back to assess the camp and see what we can do. Then, you bring the car back to bring Charlie back into your camp. I’m sure we can make a plan along the way on how to evacuate everyone. That should put us ten to eleven hours out from when the rift started giving us plenty of time try to do something.”
Cas called out among the empty space. Dean thought of the angels being cut down in the hallway and Cas gathered them too. Dean felt something and nothing nip at their heels as they gathered 46 more angels and entered the black tar again. Dean channeled some of the grace on him in desperation to get away from the shadow as the black tar swallowed them whole. They came through gasping for breath after nearly not making it back. Dean briefly lost the connection between them before Cas gathered the little grace that remained.
What Dean hadn’t been prepared for came at the end of the package. Dean froze and shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He couldn’t describe the emotion that swept over him, but it made the temperature of the room rise. Glancing at Cas to see if he noticed the shift in his demeanor, Dean angled the two papers away so he could stare at them as long as it took him to fully comprehend what he was reading. He looked over the first page again and reread Charlie’s note at the top that read “This one’s on me. Merry Late Christmas ;)”.
Once Dr. Stern and Bianca had finished collecting the sample and looking over Jack, Bianca turned to hand Jack to Cas. Jack reached out his tiny arms the second Cas was in sight, babbling nonsensically the second he saw his dads. His chubby cheeks were freshly stained with tears. It was only then that Cas let go of Dean’s hand so he could grab Jack. Cas gently tucked Jack against his chest and Jack rested his head on Cas’s shoulder calming almost instantly. Jack sniffed sadly as he settled down. Dean felt calmer too just looking at the two of them.
“Our goal next year is to clear space out behind the barn and create an herb garden. We are already planning the layout and fencing. That way we don’t have to buy the herbs or spices we use for flavors in the honey. Won’t be able to do all of them but it’s a good start. Most fruits we’ll still have to buy elsewhere but Natalie may be able to get us a deal from her supplier,” Dean continued on.
Sam smiled at his small win for a minute before Dean retorted, “Wipe that smile off your face, we’re still pissed at you.”
“Yeah, a plan for the house. I would stay with you two. Get the house fixed up and help with Jack. Sam’s gonna be busy training and building the ALH so he doesn’t really need me right now.”
It wasn’t long until Dean was telling Cas to pop the hood of the two-tone, rusty disaster of a truck. The hood squeaked in protest as Dean tried to pry it open to get a good look at the “clunking noise”. The first issue was the hood didn’t want to open to full height so Dean was left propping the stupid thing half open with a wrench. OHSA standards not being met as it was, Dean would have to wedge himself underneath the hood to look at the engine.
“I think I can speak for both of us when I say we’re down for anything. What would you normally do?”
“Tell me everything about how I got here and about ‘your’ Charlie and maybe I’ll let you out of this room with only a busted chin.”
Cas was also the only one who didn’t tip toe around Dean like he was going to shatter into pieces every second. Cas wasn’t afraid to ask Dean for help whereas Sam still didn’t want him to lift anything heavier than a phone book. Cas fully expected Dean to help with Jack and chores. Dean was growing stronger and now only needed one crutch for support as he made his way around the bunker which made everyone else happy. Smaller distances Dean didn’t need his crutch at all. Cas treated Dean like he wasn’t broken.
It dawned on Dean then that he was doomed to one if he was lucky and Cas was… Cas could go to the Empty or Heaven. The fear of Cas ending up in the Empty sunk Dean’s heart. His true form may have been dimmer than the others but he was still partially an angel at his core. Cas deserved more than the Empty. He deserved more than Heaven. Everybody in the room deserved to go to a better ending.
“Yeah,” Dean sighed, “I figured on the days I’m with them then I would take Jack more to give Cas a break and make up for it.”
The expression “keeping something at arm’s length” rang in his head as Dean tried to keep the baby physically as far away from him as possible while still technically holding Jack. Cas thought Dean would be best helping by having Dean hold Jack while Cas finished preparing the bottle. It would have been fine except for one thing.
Cas stared at the flannel in Dean’s hand for a moment before tentatively reaching out and taking it from Dean. Granted it was gross from you know, the everything, but Cas gingerly put it on and buttoned the shirt up despite the warm evening. Dean already missed the feathers but watching Cas relax into the shirt spread a warm feeling in his chest.
She came back to her home state after graduation to be closer to her tight-knit family her webpage read. Her research links, including the paper she had mentioned, were available to read for free. Dean read the abstract, introduction, and the conclusion while skipping the lengthy pages of data and graphs. He didn’t have the attention span for all that especially when the conclusion would just tell him what he needed to know. Needless to say, Dean was more than impressed with the young Dr. Mackenzie who’s intelligence was likely carefully shielded behind a to-getter attitude. She reminded him more and more of Charlie which explained a lot.
And Cas? Cas would always need his… Dean. His best friend. The person who made him look at things differently and rebel. The guy who made him think, dream, and love others. He would always need Dean. And Dean would always need Cas. That much was clear.
The last of Dean’s strength finally snapped at the thought and he collapsed, accidently releasing Cas as they tumbled to the ground. He had never felt this much hopelessness.
But all of that faded to the background for a moment. Dean was about to make his way over when he felt something in the back of his mind that said to check on Jack. Cas was crouched over the car seat and appeared to be trying to wake Jack up. His breathing had slowed even more, far slower than a normal babies should have. Cas was repeating Jack’s name more and more frantically. He looked up at Dean with a scared and frantic look.
Dean offered his hand to Cas who let him pull him to his feet. On his feet, Cas started straightening his shirt. Dean noticed him tug at the remains of pitiful sleeve that no longer was attached to the shirt in an attempt to hide his burn. Dean immediately shrugged off his dirty flannel and offered it to Cas.
Dean studied Kaia the dreamwalker. She would be crucial in helping the plan run its course. They needed her to make sure the portal opened exactly where it needed to. She was a nervous and flighty thing. He didn’t want to force her to be here but he really didn’t see another option if other dreamwalkers had turned them down. He needed to see where her head was at before figuring out the path to take. Dean didn’t want it to come down to force her help but he also wasn’t ruling that option out. He couldn’t leave Sam, Mary, or Eileen stranded in a world set on exterminating them.
Story Time continued each and every night just like Dean’s physical therapy. The attendance varied but there was always three people there.
The next few chapters are heavy Dean chapters so be prepared. Things go down at the bunker that changes everything for Dean, Sam, Cas, Eileen, and little Jack too.
Instead of answering, Dean busied himself by pulling himself to his feet. He didn’t want to explain to Cas why they were in this place or why it was the last place he thought of before they ended up wherever they were.
Jack pulling himself up and standing on wobbly legs while holding onto something wasn’t something new but something else caught Dean’s eye. Dean looked up just as Jack let go and was standing there without anything to hold on to. Dean eyes went wide and he immediately started yelling.
Cas let out a deep sigh and turned to face Dean. His voice was low and he spoke slowly, “Dean, there is no easy way to say this…”
The next chapter is an easy Sam chapter set at the farmhouse and the following two chapters after that are plot-heavy Dean chapters that are very intense and super, super long. Be prepared, it gets heavy as the occupants of the bunker have to fight for the lives of their family and so much more than that.
As the gray fog worked to settle over his mind, Dean came down the stairs which forced Sam back awake. He was surprised to find Cas didn’t follow behind Dean. His brother looked at tired as Sam felt but he smiled sight of Eileen and Sam still sitting on the couch.
They walked to the end of the aisle, ducking behind stands at Natalie’s discretion. The other baby was introduced as Lily who was only slightly younger than Jack. Dean didn't even try to talk because he was keeping an eye out for Cas.
Naomi looked over at Dean and Dean gave her a proper sneer. Whether Cas was actually going with the angels back to Heaven or not, Dean didn’t know but he was going to make it clear that if Jack and Cas left right now he would absolutely raise hell. He needed those two weeks dammit.
“Wait, two or three days here means Cas is alone in the house. Won’t Cas need you on the days you’re here?”
“We’ve been talking about all the events after we pulled angels out of the empty nothing space. But we haven’t talked about the actual angels and we’ve been walking for what, about an hour now?”
His mind kept replaying it all. If his cat had been an asshole to Dean, Cas wouldn't have developed a crush on Dean. If he hadn't developed a crush on Dean, then he wouldn't have fallen in love with him. If he wasn't in love with Dean, he would have never had gone on a date with a guy he barely knew trying to get over Dean. By Cas’s concussed logic, some of his problems were Stephen Spielberg's fault. Screw Jurassic Park and Jurassic World too. He was going to punch that animatronic T-rex in it's stupid face.
Dean couldn’t tell you why he didn’t want to talk about it and Cas never brought it up so it remained in uncharted territories. Probably because like many things when it came to Cas and Dean, dancing around the topic until the topic is forced to the front was their style. Until tonight apparently, when they are making it up on the spot because they couldn’t talk to each other about this before. Every time Dean had thought about it, he got distracted by something else. It kept getting pushed to the back burner. Being holed up in the house because of the snow and ice hadn’t created a sense of urgency. That and the fact they were actively avoiding the town.
Dean had sent out a few texts when things had settled down to let their family know what had happened. Mary had not responded but Dean knew she would whenever she had a chance. She might be up in Heaven or catching some sleep earth side for all Dean knew.  Sam had called hours ago when he finally woken up to Dean’s text letting him know what had happened. There were offers from both Sam and Eileen separately to make the drive but Dean said he would call they after they got settled at home.
“Tell you what, we’ll take care of that here and get you connected to a doctor in town who can take good care of Jack. I think I may even know the town doctor and if he’s who I’m thinking of then you couldn’t be in better hands. Good guy, great with kids and families of all backgrounds, and an old friend of mine. Jack should probably be put on a vaccination schedule too if he isn’t already when he is feeling better. I think I have everything I need to get a treatment plan created. One of you will need to complete the intake paperwork and you can you sit at that table over there. The nurse is setting everything up now.”
“Calm down Conan, I’ll get it reheated. Bring your dirty stuff down here when you’re done since I’m gonna be starting a load.
How had Sam not visited once in over two years? The thought kicked him again and Sam tried to swallow the unchewed large piece of cake he had just shoved into his moth
Dean wanted to talk about Jack too and was tired of being left out of the conversation. Mackenzie kept accidentally sending Dean into a tail spin and Cas had pulled the wool over his eyes with the "partner" thing. Jack was easy to talk about. He knew Jack and Jack didn’t confuse him.
The man continues to smile as Dean fumbles through his apology. He steps onto the front steps and closes his door behind him with a soft click. He is only a few inches away from Dean as he bends down to say hello to Bruiser.
Dean looked over to Billie who raised her eyebrows questioningly in response. Sensing that Billie was trying to tell him something, Dean turned back to the demon. It wasn’t acting like a demon though. It was acting like a starving monster that needed a fix.
“We’re going to talk and you are going to give me answers,” Mackenzie said. There was a slight fear in her voice made it tremble but it still strong. She still sounded like herself.
Dean struggles with his promise to do better with Jack and Cas before his life gets turned upside down permanently.
Cas and Dean didn’t say much when the nurses left. Cas pulled out his keys and handed it to Dean. Dean played with the shark keychain Dean had bought him when they went to the aquarium for a brief moment before saying goodbye. Two hours later, Dean sent him a picture of a happy Dr. Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm sitting on the couch with a text saying Dean would pick him up at 8AM like the doctors had wanted.
“I know but I also don’t like taking their will away from them all the time. The sugar water is a gentler approach.”
With a scream, Kaia looked into Claire’s eyes and the rift formed completely. Rowena’s incantation stopped and she slumped forward with exhaustion. She looked up and smiled at the rift before resting her head against the table.
As Dean descended the stairs, he was filled with a sense of dread. He hadn’t grabbed his gun from under his pillow. He was stumbling into this fight broken and unarmed. But he couldn’t turn back now, he had to save Cas and Jack from whatever monster had made it past the wards and into their home. He needed to be prepared to fight with nothing but his fists. When he crossed the threshold into the dining room, it wasn’t a monster he could fight with any weapon. No, this monster was much worse. The sight stole the breath from Dean’s chest.
“Hey now, it’s not like we aren’t at the bunker all the time. Plus, everyone has something long overdue. Let’s just focus on having a good time this week.”
“You deserve to have a life outside the house too. But only do it if that’s something you’re interested in and want to do with your spare time. If you’d rather do something like knit, I’ll support you in that too.”
Sam didn’t have anything to say to that so Eileen continued signing at him, “Why would Cas move all his clothes out of the room except his winter clothes when we are only staying a week. We live out of bags while hunting so it’s not like we need an entire dresser. The room has no spark. No personality. Nothing to make it look like a room someone sleeps in every night.”
“So what do we have to do get you set up to start making honey? Obviously, you are gonna doing most of the actual beekeeping by yourself but I can help with everything else. Do we need to build the hive ourselves? Is it called a hive without bees? Shit, Cas how do we get bees?”
Before he could finish his thought, he was gently pulled by something into what can only be described as bright sunshine. Then, he felt nothing.
Dean stands there staring at the man in front of him. The man had obviously just gotten home from work because he is wearing a tan trenchcoat and suit. His tie is backwards and pulled down away from his neck. The man glances down at Bruiser and seems to notice what the dog was carrying in his mouth. He then smiles at Dean and Dean feels his brain short circuit.
Sam had barely gotten out of the car when he heard the front door open and out came Dean and Cas with Jack in tow. The smell of burgers wafted through the air as Sam and Eileen ascended the front steps onto the large front porch. Sam felt his stomach growl in anticipation. Yep, he was definitely glad they came tonight.
“Are we going to spend the entire night arguing about this? Or can we skip to the part where you sit back so we can get this done and try to get some sleep before Jack wakes up? I have no issues with massaging you, Dean. If you’re worried about people finding out, I promise to keep this part between you and me. Nobody else knows that this is even part of your program. But can we please figure this standoff out faster,” Cas asked full of sass.
It was then Sam learned that Dean and Cas weren’t just taking a few hives here and there like he had thought but they were seeking hives because their booth was so popular at the farmer’s market. It wasn’t the small business Sam thought it was. Sam felt guilty all those time Cas and Dean brought honey to the bunker and he never offered to pay.
Shaking his head to clear the distraction Jack had caused, Dean replied, “I don’t not like our ‘story’ or whatever but we are in a town full of regular people. We need to make sure we aren’t getting outcasted from the get-go because we say weird shit. We need to pretend to be somewhat boring.”
Sam told him that Mary and Sam were alternating between caring for Jack in the cabin and coming to the hospital. The hospital person would rotate between Cas’s and Dean’s room. Dean had completely forgotten about the newborn Nephilim and felt an immediate surge of resentment fill his chest.
Cas was seated at the dining room table with Jack in his lap and the nebulizer pressed over the Jack’s face. Jack was screaming bloody murder as Cas struggled to keep the mask in place without hurting him. The whirl of the machine could have been heard from the stairs but Dean hadn’t noticed in his rush to find Cas.
Dean liked this Charlie. In her own way, she was a completely different person. She was grittier and less bubbly than their version because of the war and loss. But at the core she was still Charlie and Dean loved her already.
The last part of gardening was Dean’s favorite. Taking the secondhand watering can, Cas would water each plant individually. Sometimes whispers of encouragement would come for the smaller or struggling plant but no plant big or small was missed or ignored. Each was just as important as the last though the little jalapeno plant that Dean had picked out always received extra attention. Dean found the shriveled up little thing a few days before Jack’s birthday. They had brought it home and, after several days of celebrating Jack’s birthday at the bunker, were surprised to find it alive. It kept on going and there was a single little bud forming.
The hallway still had people wandering around but Dean walked past them with his eyes focused ahead. Nobody tried to stop him. He heard footsteps following behind him but pushed those back and just focused on moving forward. His brain was surprising numb and he let that feeling spread throughout his body to smother any other feelings who thought they were worthwhile enough to make an appearance. Frank’s words about faking it rang in his head clear as a bell.
Charlie let out a long moan as Dean brought the towel back from where he had been pressing on her stomach to assess how badly it was bleeding. The blood rose to the surface and Dean repressed the already partially drenched towel. The cut was deeper than Dean initially thought but he didn’t see any organs. The bruise on her forehead hadn’t changed which Dean took as a good sign even though it’s size was concerning.
