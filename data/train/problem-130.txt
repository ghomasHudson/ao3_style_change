Lestrade caught the frantic look in the younger man’s eyes, before said man tried to storm past him, to follow his partner into the night. Lestrade caught his sleeve and pulled him back forcefully. This would be a long evening. Sherlock gave the detective a wild look, as if he was responsible for this mess. Greg was unfazed.
Roughly two hours later, John was pleasantly tipsy and laughed heartily at some story Greg told him about his ridiculous ex-wife. Just as he was about to order another round, his phone buzzed for the 20
John. To
“For the record, your attitude is getting on my nerves. And actually, I was texting your brother” Sherlock stared at him blankly.
The man claps him on the back approvingly. “It’s because you
They fell into silence again. Greg considered following Sherlock’s advice, but found that now was not the time, nor the situation to act on his romantic fantasies. Not with a brooding detective sitting on the sleazy old leather sofa in his office, presumably one straw away from throwing a massive fit. Greg would be glad, if it was just a fit, actually. A fit he could handle. But he knew how Sherlock could be: Self-destructive to the point of a mental breakdown.
“Do whatever you want, as long as you’re back in one piece at dinner time.”
“Still I don’t- I don’t understand. Everything is so confusing” he groaned low, annoyed with his own inadequateness of dealing with emotions. “Every time I think that I figured it out, a variable changes, throws everything into chaos again”
The second was long enough that he lost sight of Sherlock, who seated himself against the bar to wait (for he
Maybe his heart broke.
John wasn’t paying attention to any of that; he was much more concerned with inwardly FREAKING OUT, because surely Sherlock must have noticed, why did Sherlock not DO anything about it? The realization that he wanted Sherlock to care for him right now- in front of all these people, in public-  was almost as devastating as the shattering proposition that maybe Sherlock did not WANT to care for him anymore.
John realizes that now, he thinks more about his own feelings than he had in actual years. And talks more about them, too. He had always lived by the mantra that it was no use to bother others with his own insecurity and vulnerability. That he had to be the strong one, always, because somebody had to be.
into the touch.
“Oh, don’t be so melodramatic, I was fine” “How can you be so fucking oblivious about the whole thing?!” Now he was screaming again. He didn’t want to scream. But Sherlock as pushing his buttons, he was pushing them so damn well. “All I’m asking you for is to be careful. For me. For us. Isn’t that enough?!”
“Good news?”
John had only made it complicated before.
to me? I’m not heart-less, John, thank you very much, why would you-“
“I know,” Sherlock answered, pressing his whole body against John’s back, draping a light blanket over both of them.  “Lestrade told me as much.”
Instead of saying anything, John pulled his insecure best friend into a tight hug. It was slightly awkward, with John’s come damp hand trailing over Sherlock’s back, the heavy smell of ejaculate hanging between them, and John’s straining erection poking Sherlock in the stomach. Whatever end Sherlock had for this sentence died in his throat, when he allowed himself to let himself fall in the security of his blogger’s embrace.
They were both so broken. Yet, the fit, like a puzzle piece.
Sherlock took the invitation, and studied him intensely, though without his usual heat, for some minutes. At last, his eyebrows shot up, and his mouth quirked, as if he tried to conceal a sneer and was doing a dreadful job at it.
The first time Sherlock woke up, he almost wished he hadn’t. Everything was bleary, his thoughts were shattered about; and above all, there was the drum of a massive headache resonating in his skull. He turned, groaning with the effort of
attractive.
'Explain. Now.- GL'
to ask John.
Sherlock’s face fell. “I-“
,” because he just can’t stop himself.
John clears his throat. “Well, it’s Rosie’s second birthday. And since her first one kind of… fell under the radar (of murder and grief and so much bullshit. He doesn’t say that, but he has the sinking suspicion that these guys already know anyway. Still. Doesn’t mean he has to
It would do him some good to get out of his head for a while, the constant pondering and emotional turmoil back and forth- always between confessing his undying love for the genius or bolting the flat- was exhausting him. He felt like he missed something, something
“Did you know that Mycroft sleeps-“
He hadn’t heard them enter the flat and spends thirty seconds to panic over the fact that Sherlock might have heard the whole thing (which was, all things considered, really not that big of a deal, but
John’s heart gave a nervous flutter at the proposition, but he knew Sherlock well enough to know, that he would most likely buzz on about the case and his own brilliancy in it, make some notes about the interesting soil he found under the victim’s fingernails (yes, John actually listened to Sherlock’s never-ending litany.) and then crash, to sleep at least ten hours.
The kiss was growing from sweetly to hotly in no time; before he knew how it happened, John found his tongue in his Sherlock’s mouth, while the younger man fisted his t-shirt like his life depended on it. He was shaking in earnest now, making little low moans as best as he was able when being snogged so thoroughly.
He finds it easy to answer questions about Rosie’s nursery, things like what colors and flowers she likes. When the topic switches to the more lived-in areas, John gets hung up on memories. Practically ever corner in 221B is riddled with them- some good, some even fantastic, some devastating, some down-right anguishing. It’s like his whole life after the war has played out in this flat.
“Do you think he’ll leave me?” The detective stared at the hunched-over form of the so-called ‘sociopath of Scotland Yard’ and asked himself once again how he somehow managed to gain the trust of this peculiar human being. Sherlock loathed talking about emotions. Yet here they were, sitting their butts flat on the hard floor and pouring their hearts out. The situation was paradox at least, if not simply ridiculous.
, Sherlock, love. There’s nothing to be fixed. You’re not broken”
Gently, but confidently, he was leaning in, closing the distance between their lips again. Sherlock made a small strangled noise of approval, which was drowned out, when the doctor started kissing him in earnest.
~ In the early hours of the morning ~
Thank you guys eversomuch for your patience and for sticking with this fic and for reading, and kudo-ing (?) and commenting and and and! <3
“So, you tricked him.”
“Sherlock, no” It was the first time he spoke since they left the crime scene. His voice resonated hoarsely with the lack of use. “You shouldn’t have to adjust every single one of your actions to me. That shouldn’t be necessary.”
“No” The detective pleaded, and it almost sounded as if he was in pain. “I will find a way to mess this up- I’ve always messed sentiment up- and the cost is just too high this time”
The detective crawled into their tent, careful to be as quietly as possible to not wake Rosie, wo was cuddled securely against her father’s chest.
it? How could he be smiling at him, that soft crinkly smile that reached his eyes solely reserved for private moments between them, how could he smile like that? Didn’t he realize just how much was at stake? Sherlock knew, he just did, that somehow his inadequateness, his sheer oddity would drive John Watson away, and with him all that had been good in his life.
Bugger.
Although he came to the conclusion, that he was horribly inept as to interpret what the practical implications of the theoretical term ‘love’ actually meant, even someone as socially unequipped as himself understood that it had proven itself to be the best possible fundament for a relationship. He hadn’t been loved in a relationship, before.
wasn’t in the mood for Graham’s drunken chatter) and was now staring daggers in John’s direction.
Clearly, he underestimated Rosie’s stubbornness. She fixated him with the stormy blue eyes of her mother and stuck her bottom lip out. “No” she mumbled behind the full-blown pout; crossed arms and everything.

Sherlock squeezed his friend’s shoulders a little tighter. He didn’t know what else to do. John drew in a shaky breath that sounded a little too close to a sob.

about Sherlock’s life! That in itself wasn’t a quite noteworthy revelation, John had proven this point during their years as flatmates and working partners countless of times. The new factor laid in Sherlock’s own exclamation. He had merely pointed out the fact that he technically never asked anyone to save him. He was perfectly capable of saving himself (most of the time).
John wished he could just crawl in there and get him the fuck out, but he couldn't. All he could do was hold the shaking figure close to his chest and pray. He had never seen anyone cry so gut-wrenching.
“Greg told you…. Right?” he asked with a calmness that he didn’t feel. The was the tiniest nod against his collar.

Truly, and utterly terrifying.
“Hold your trap,
“I’m fine” another nervous throat clearance. “Well, it’s getting rather late, I’ll just be getting Rosie and head home-“ The doctor turned and was already cursing his cowardice, his insecurities and his general behaviour, when strong hands on his shoulders held him back. Surprised, the doctor looked up and met a concerned pair of eyes.
“Suppose you still don’t want to hear it?” the detective asked breathlessly, parting just enough to speak against his doctor’s lips.
, but he couldn’t put his finger on it.
Life decided to be kind to John's scarred heart as Mary started her first day at the clinic on the very same day. They fell in love fast. It was a lighter feeling, nothing heavy, nothing lifechanging- but it was nice, John decided. It was nice not waking up alone. It was nice to have someone listen. It was nice to have someone to talk to, who responded outside of his head. Day by day, he fought himself back to normality. Until that very evening. The bloody evening where he wanted to make his new life official and Sherlock crashed back into it.
about him within a single glance. He often felt bare, oh so vulnerable. Naked, because of a gaze.
“I need a cigarette” Aaaand there it was.
John’s flush returns with a vengeance when he remembers Antoni’s words. It’s true, the attention those eyes can command so easily is dazzling. He feels light-headed. For the very first time, he allows himself to be pulled in from these eyes, no longer caring what the sudden eruption of nervous tingles in his stomach might imply. No longer caring what Sherlock might see. What he might show him.
“Fine” he mumbled. “Have it your way. Then only I have to thank him for that”
Maybe Sherlock hasn’t changed as much as he thought; maybe Sherlock just doesn’t
He took a deep breath. Soldier up, Watson. Time to be brave. No turning back now, cards on the table.
doesn’t.
Shite. He had been so fucking confident about this one. And yet most likely so fucking wrong. But a soldier never backed down in the face of danger. Even if danger was the two most irritating people he knew stuffed together with him in a living room.
Sherlock lend against the table and just … watched him for some minutes. The army doctor hummed happily to himself, scrubbing some glue from the sink. There were blotches of glue and food colouring littered all across one of his older shirts (one he rarely wore, mainly because it was a flannel that made him look like lumberjack who had been shrinked (John’s opinion) or like the ultimate Dad (Sherlock’s opinion)), there was more food colouring in his hair, and even some golden glitter scattered across his cheeks and brows. Sherlock watched him idly cleaning up the mess he had voluntarily made to make their little girl happy and felt something warm seep into his chest. Everything about him had been thrown into chaos, and Sherlock thought his John had never looked more beautiful.
After all, what is the harm in people assuming that he was gay? Bi? In any way sexually attracted to men?
Sherlock shook his head forcefully. “It’s never…been like this” He exhaled shakily.
John sighed. “Mistakes were made, yeah. That doesn’t make you an ass, though. You’re a good person, when are you ever going to believe me? You just make wrong choices sometimes. You’ll do better, next time. And so will I”
John chuckled at the genuine question in Sherlock’s voice. “It’s a nice way of saying ‘shut up or I’ll throw you out.”
The world stopped turning for a second.

All because of this
The two tents were set up with military precision, both big enough to hold all four of them easily.
them.
“We’ll take it easy, yeah? I’ve got you” he added as an afterthought, realizing that he had been pretty demanding, and possibly overwhelming. He wanted Sherlock to feel safe with him. To enjoy himself. Not cling to sensation after sensation, helplessly overwhelmed with the intensity of it all.
“You’re an idiot” Precisely. Yet, the words send a cold rush down his back. Sure, they hadn’t talked about this but… somehow, he just assumed that John wanted to be… with him. To be… his… as much as he wanted to be John’s, he realized in this very moment with a growing sense of panic. John touched his shoulder- out of sympathy, no doubt, but he found himself almost unable to move away from the warm center of the doctor’s palm. It was calming, a grounding force while his whole life was going to shreds.
Oh bugger…
“Don’t give me that look, you always use up all the warm water” Relived that John didn’t actually get it (although he came pretty damn close), Sherlock forced a tight smile on his lips.
Greg clasped John’s shoulder in a friendly manner while he sat down next to him. “This is going to be great, I’m sure!”
Mycroft visits. The brothers share a moment that was well overdue. John Watson saves the day once again.
‘Not exactly subtle there’ John thought to himself, smiling slightly about this crazy situation they were in. Everything about them was sort of a beautiful mess; nothing had been easy, nothing had been planned; they were broken, broken for different reasons- but this thing between them was
They hold a silent conversations solely through their actions. It’s nothing unusual, yet somehow, with all the little things John has noticed today thanks to the Fab 5, it feels much more intimate.
Maybe, he loved Sherlock. Not that he would ever do anything about it.
The colors bring out his eyes and the tone of his skin, the cuts compliment his body, the styles take at least ten years off of him.
“I’m sleepy” John had to smile; the simple choice of words a dead give-away that Sherlock was almost asleep already.
“What a fantastic deduction, you clever genius!” Sherlock flinched, feeling an unexpected pang of hurt, hearing the usually well-meant words of praise in such a sharp tone.
“Hm?”
with someone like him. The problem was, that he let himself become attached to their new intimacy; found himself more often than not pulled to bed, not because he was tired, but because John was there; he found himself noticing small intimate things about the doctor, like the small snores he made when sleeping on his stomach, or the roughness of his voice right after waking up; he found himself wishing that they would also share this closeness in the day light, because every morning felt like a reset to the way they used to behave around each other.
He feels his throat close up a bit.
’. He didn’t say. It was too soon. It was too big. It would be too much. Instead, he doubled his efforts, hands roaming freely all over Sherlock’s back, and hips, and tights; kissing him breathlessly, massaging the detective’s tongue with his own- he was drunk on this moment, highly intoxicated with endorphins, his head was swimming with the force of his own arousal. He was far gone- he was really not as much in control as he’d like.
Irritated with his overly sentimental mood, John pushed the half empty mug around on the table's surface. There was no use in predicting Sherlock's future behavior. If he knew one thing about the Holmes all together, it was that they never behaved as predicted.
“A home is the most treasured space of memory we have. I’m not here to change this. All your precious possessions will remain right where they are, I’m just here to upgrade the living-conditions to hopefully improve the living-quality of your little household.”
“I’m not giving you cigarettes, Sherlock” The young man gave him what supposedly was his ‘intimidating’ glare, but his otherwise rather pitiful posture destroyed the effect he hoped to create. He just looked a little lost, not at all like ‘I am smarter than anyone in this building’ Sherlock Holmes. He had more resemblance of the ‘I really cannot cope with the world right now, please just give me my damn drugs; please just let me escape’ version. Greg pushed these thoughts back in the dark corner of his mind where they belonged and stood up with a heavy sigh.
of, eventually. The thought hurt John enough to stop considering telling him.
This isn’t a sexual crisis, John sternly tells himself. It is a ridiculous thing to have a crisis over
The doctor somehow felt in the pit of his stomach (and he believed his gut feelings to be accurate, despite of Sherlock's dismissive comments about bowl movements and superstition) that he had to call Mycroft to invite him over. To thank him, maybe. John wanted to laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of the notion. Not in a million years he had thought himself to ever be in the position to not only actively call Mycroft Holmes, but more over to thank him for his thoughtful services. He must have gone completely bonkers. But....it felt right, right? John shook his head at himself. Even
John momentarily looked caught in the headlight, before he coughed to overplay it.
“I made t-“ he started, and stopped when he saw the way John was looking at him. Something was different than the last time. Something was different than every other last time he saw John after a nightmare. This… something was sparkling in the doctor’s eyes: Small, and lost and…. Vulnerable. Something in those eyes caused a surge of protectiveness to wash over him.
“I’m happy with Sherlock,” he hears himself say. “Being with him is like… being alive. When I lost him, it was like loosing myself. I didn’t know how to… go on. I’m just… it’s the best thing that has happened to me, having him back. Aside from Rosie, naturally. It’s awful to say I’m happy because my wife is dead but… but I am.”
He planned on telling Sherlock that there was still some hot water left. That he would wait here, while the detective got ready himself. That Sherlock did good today, that he was proud. That he didn’t mean to startle him with the peck.
doing?’
child.
Sherlock peaked up from his safe spot against John’s pulse point to shyly gauge his partner’s reaction.
He hadn’t played rugby since medical school and something about it, and something about hanging around with people his age who share experiences with him is very refreshing and rewarding. It’s surprisingly easy talking to the other dads once they got over the first awkwardness (Karamo’s easy-going nature helped a lot with that, too) and John finds himself being more open and honest about his worries as a single-father than he can ever imagine being with any of his close friends. It’s healing to hear the stories of the other guys, to see that there is so much that they share, and that he is not alone in his fears. He’s not the only single father, he’s not the only doctor- hell- he’s not even the only veteran. Something about connecting with these guys he barely knows through common ground makes him feel so much less alone. He hadn’t realized how alone he had felt before.
“What are you talking about? It’s extraordinary” Another adjective for the list Sherlock never would have dreamed to be called. “
“I hear you, mate. From what we’ve heard your life has been kind of a shit show, pardon my choice of words.”
Sherlock asked for his help and here he was, in no condition to be of
John opened his mouth, but Sherlock paid him no mind, instead working himself up again.
‘You wouldn’t’
Sherlock was…. intrigued?
The detective was currently still frantically trying to wrap up the turmoil of emotions and thoughts that whirled through his mind.
John Watson- a glass of water and painkillers. He swallowed them hurriedly, wincing at the velvety texture of his own mouth, and fell back into the deep, dreamless slumber of the intoxicated.
Instead, he just says, very softly, “Now don’t you be daft.”
"Sherlock!", Mycroft's 14-year-old voice resonated heavy in his ears, drumming through his skull. "It will be better. Stop struggling, Sherlock. She's gone now" Sherlock held his head and tugged at his curls, using physical stimuli to make the memory disappear (he really needed to sit down). Distressed, he noted that he couldn't breathe properly, as if Mycroft's arms were still wrapped tightly around his torso. "She's gone" The voice whispered again. "She won't hurt you anymore" "Shut up" Sherlock hissed (Why was the room spinning?).
Taken aback by the open display of gratitude, Greg stumbled a little over his own tongue. “You’re welcome, Sherlock”.
Which, wow.
“That was so damn sexy. Your face, God Sherlock…. You’re gorgeous”
. Always the savior, always the doctor, always caring, never judging (never calling names, instead compliments and encouragement), the soldier in times of need,
John gave him a look. “I almost broke your jaw” he pointed out.
The detective only gave him an overly sweet, buttery smile; before he gracefully threw himself in his chair, to stare at his brother with an unreadable expression. Immediately, the playful air changed in the room, to something more tense. Mycroft nodded soberly, acknowledging his brother’s presence.
just a few metres away was a completely different matter.
- not even John. John, who had seen it all pretty much on that night carefully buried in the darkest corners of his mind-palace. A corner he never visited voluntarily; but where his mind sometimes took him in the deceiving safety of sleep (But he was fine, thank you very much. Nightmares? Sherlock Holmes doesn’t do nightmares, don't be ridiculous, John).
“What about him?” he asks airy, hoping that the squeak in his voice is just a trick of his own imagination.
“I’m getting us a coffee” he informed Sherlock. All he got was an exasperated sigh.
When the Holmes brothers returned to their campground, they were greeted with a peaceful scene. John was dozing in their hammock, while Greg sat against one of the tree trunks, nose buried deep in what looked suspiciously like a sappy romance novel.
And thus, John laid there, in the early hours of the morning, neatly tucked in the soft bedsheets of his best friend and was overcome by a heavy emotion, so heavy that he was unable to move for some seconds. He would never be able to get away from Sherlock Holmes. Hell, not even death could stop his gravitation towards this fucking bastard.
, between them, but he was constantly running
“I’m sorry” They spoke at the same time. Surprised by the statement of the other, they looked at each other. “That was probably…. Not what you had in mind. I’m… I’m terribly inexperienced and-“
. Mycroft, of all people. Just the thought about it made him sulk.
But first, it’s time to up this poor soul’s wardrobe game.
, that he didn’t want to loose it. Loose John…
“I love you. So much.”
In the deepest darkest corner of his heart, John realizes he might have a point.
“You’re not, you’re always wonderful, John”
Contrary to Sherlockian believe, Lestrade was quite good at picking up clues: “This damn series of robberies has been driving us all nuts the past week. Sorry for keeping him so busy.”
Fine, then, if John decided to treat him like a child, then he would respond to the situation like a child. So, Sherlock did was he could do best. Snap icily. “There was nothing to worry about, I was doing just fine” John fixated him with an unbelieving expression and for the split of a second Sherlock actually believed the doctor would come over and slap him across the face.
“Why don’t you go over to the other tent and tell them all about it, hm?”
Sherlock woke with a jolt. It took his pupils 0.2 seconds to adjust to the dim light of his bedroom. It took his brain 0.3 seconds to come online (curtains still drawn, small patch of sunlight, angle suggests it's between 10 and 11:30 in the morning). It took his memory 0.4 seconds to replay images of the evening before (trauma-induced anxiety attack, crying due to emotional overload (skin around cheeks drier than usual), bodily exhaustion, dry throat, higher body temperature due close approximately to another human being).
Maybe there is nothing to be ready for; maybe he and the Fab 5 are just imagining things.
John’s determination to make some small talk shrunk profoundly when he approached Mycroft, who had seated himself on the couch with a little uneasy smile on his face.                                 “Here we are” he mumbled, plopping down in his chair with a muffled sound. He gave Mycroft a nervous smile, feeling the awkwardness stretching around this ridiculous scene. The politician took a sip of tea, seemingly recovered from his initial surprise, silently deduction John with an unreadable expression.
The silence was only short-lived.
“Told you we would figure it out” he murmured into the darkness, before he let himself be pulled to sleep; safe and sound and happy.
Finally, finally everything was fine. No scratch that, better than fine, everything was brilliant! He would be able to be with Sherlock and to show him every single day for the rest of his life (as far as John was concerned) how thankful he was, how happy their little family made him, and how much he loved this unbelievable man.
He watched his daughter run towards the detective with a gaze filled with relief and doubt. Had it been a bad choice to lay their little family out in the open, for everyone to see? For everyone to judge the mistakes they might made, the mistakes that normally stayed hidden in the security of 221B Baker Street. A different feeling than anxiety sunk in John’s gut, although he couldn’t quite place what it was. All he knew was that he suddenly wished they had stayed on the stupid pavement. Passer-by’s were one thing. Colleagues were a complete different. He didn’t want anyone who he had to face every day to know how much of a flop as a father he was. Would there be sneers? Concern? Hell, pity?
That they didn’t talk complicated matters. Sherlock wasn’t sure where they stood anymore. John remained the greatest mystery he’s never going to solve. John and all his complex emotions, emotions he never shared, emotions that kept the detective guessing, and worrying, and
Sherlock swayed dangerously, a mixture of alcohol and the exhaustion from the past case crashing down on him like a wave. He could barely hold himself upright. John dragged him to the exit, carefully refraining from snapping at his detective rudely. He didn’t get why Sherlock had acted this way, and it had done a spectacularly good job at hurting him.
“And presuming she makes some friends we can start going to those playdates. And-“ here he hesitates for the first time in well over an hour, breathing still fast and labored from talking so much for so long. He flushes a little bit. He can’t remember the last time he talked so much with Sherlock while being sober. He’s usually the quiet type.
It takes another ten minutes until Antoni re-gains his composure (and until somebody calms Jonathan down about the disappointment of not having been able to “touch those curls, honey!!!” and instead having to witness the “grossest thing ever”). When he does, he has enough gusto to criticize the barren state of the actual fridge (in total: milk, one carrot, Indian take-out leftovers, pickles). John’s not proud of it, so much so that he can’t disagree. It
But it was
” a small part of John was giddy with the prospect that Sherlock seemed to need him, if only a little bit, after all. “That’s what I’m here
Before Sherlock could make a snarky remark or really any comment to save the situation, John was off in the kitchen, probably preparing himself some tea to calm down. The detective let out an irritated breath. All these…these social norms, and silly sentimental gestures... he couldn’t make a reason out of it. All he knew was that he somehow managed to upset John, which probably lead to less hair petting in the near future, which the detective very much pitied. He’d have to apologize eventually. But this action was so despite him when he didn’t know what he should feel sorry for.
“I meant sharing a bed.”
“Don’t be” Sherlock mumbled, breaking the kiss after some seconds but keeping his lips only millimetres away from John’s.
The moment the phone dialed it dawned on him. He was phoning fucking Mycroft Holmes. He was about to invite Mycroft fucking Holmes over for tea to talk about feelings. Despite all the heroic devotion, it was still
At this, Sherlock looked up. Uncertainty was painted all over his features (so it was embarrassment, ha, call me the Sherlock Holmes of sentiment deduction!), which made him appear so much younger than the thirty something he was.  John gave him his most encouraging smile and squeezed the cold hand holding him back. Sherlock looked at him, huffed, looked at him again and then to the side.
“I’m alright, stop worrying, John, why wouldn’t I be alright? I’m fine, right as rain” the detective rambled- too quickly, too high pitched, too hurried to be convincing. John gave him a funny look but didn’t push the matter.
“But John-“
Involuntarily, images of Donovan and Anderson calling Sherlock a "freak" appeared in front of his inner eye, but he pushed it back down. Not the right time. Not the right place. Instead of answering the challenging tone of the father (the poor man was wrecked, no need to push him even further), he made his final notes.
When he smelled the faint honey aroma of Sherlock's posh 30-quid shampoo, he finally remembered the events from the day before. Instantly, he turned, expecting the bed to be empty since Sherlock probably fled in shame because of yesterday’s vulnerability, but was surprised to find the other side of the bed still occupied.
John stands in front of a well-lit mirror and gapes at himself.
a) Sherlock and Mycroft might be a bit out of character in this one; but bear with me. I just realized that I didn't want to write another heavy, kind of sad chapter, and proceeded to create something light and heart-warming instead.
Now Sherlock was
John abandoned his previous crouching position to sit down on the pavement beside her. Passerbys gave them side-eyed stares and John made his polite ‘fuck off’ face.  His anxiety had lessened to a tiny tingle in his limps, but the emptiness in his chest stayed. Everything in his body sighed from exhaustion. He felt old. Battled, broken, and oh so very old.
Rosie Watson was an incredible happy toddler. Smiling and laughing all day long, almost never causing a fuss (and God forbid if she was… that girl had temperament!), enjoying the world with her bright eyes filled with childish delight.  Her father, John Watson, was deeply thankful for every minute he got to spend with his little treasure. Sure, there were long days of surgery and cases, and endless nights where Rosie had to stay with her make-shift Nana Mrs. Hudson.
“He’s quite the handful, eh?”
“You lied to me!”
And just like that, a certain sense of anxiety crept up on him again- not the crushing, but the lingering kind- that caused his stomach to do flips, and a tremor crept into his fingers.
The days following after that night rushed by in a blurr. Lestrade had called with another case early in the morning after the first time they had been intimate, a case which took up almost all of their time and attention. Yet, Sherlock seemed to be more considerate, seemed to take his time every once in a while- to stop and look at John, to give him a smile. Every time it happened, John’s heart made a leap towards his throat.
“I made a mistake. I hurt you, and that wasn’t an all right thing for me to do. I’m supposed to protect you, after all” He nudged Sherlock’s shoulder in a friendly way, that made the detective’s insides all fluttery.
The next day, John comes prepared.
'Is he alright?- GL' John smiled a little at the genuine concern. Although Sherlock never bothered to even learn his name, Greg had always been good to him. John considered thanking him for everything he's done for Sherlock, but decided against it eventually. It would seem pretty weird, no matter how close he and Sherlock were. The last thing he needed was people making up ridiculous rumors about their relationship status again!
The detective’s lips curved into a playful smirk. “Don’t call me that” he replied, before he jumped from the counter, and poked his partner in the rips.
Just as he sat down on the bed to nurse his own cuppa, a freshly showered and sheepish John entered the room. He scratched his neck, standing in the room a bit undecided. Sherlock patted the free space beside him, giving his best friend a reassuring smile. John complied clumsily, sat down, sighed.
Greg tuned Sherlock’s protests right out, smiling to himself about their strange domesticity he came to appreciate so much.
“Really, Sherlock?” John let out an exasperated sigh. “You’re seriously trying to tell me about relationship conventions? You, of all people?” Sherlock, to his own horror, found himself helplessly overwhelmed with the amount of negative emotions directed his way. He hadn’t done anything wrong, after all! He caught the killer! He apologized! What did it matter if he meant it or not?! “John-“ he started cautiously, not desiring to anger the man more than he apparently had; but at the same time he was getting slowly fed up with the way the doctor was treating him.
“Aw, that is so sweet. You’re such a good father!”
“Leave him be”
After Rosie is fast asleep and Sherlock excuses himself to take a shower, John is left alone once more with his thoughts about the day. Even though the shopping trip happened hours ago, he still feels the exhilarating rush of confidence deep within him.
“You’re sleeping tonight” John informed him, conversely, while he started to rub small circles over the detective’s tense shoulder blades. The touch sent tingly waves all through Sherlock’s body.
“Sherlock-Why would you say that?”
John spend the whole cab ride home huddled against Sherlock’s side, not looking up once. Sherlock let him. The smaller man’s body was still taut like a string, buzzing with nervous energy. Sherlock gently massaged the soft patch between thumb and forefinger, until John’s hand wasn’t jerking anymore. He hummed a sound of appreciation which resonated deep within John.
The production team has waited three whole days. It’s almost a miracle at this point. A sunny day in London.
It’s not working.
strong, stubborn, trusty doctor and army captain- scrunching up his face in an expression of pure anguish and despair. His eyes behind his closed eyelids were moving rapidly. Sherlock watched helplessly how his best friend clutched the blanked so hard that his knuckles created a hard contrast to the softness of the sheets, shivering by the intensity of the nightmare he must be experiencing.                    Sherlock might have stood in the doorway until the waves subsided, unable to do anything but stare and feel his heart sink in his chest, when John wouldn’t have started to whine- actually
, but he had known right from the beginning that The Work was and would always be Sherlock’s top priority. It hurt him, maybe a little bit, but he promised Sherlock (on that one day where the lanky detective had kissed him for the first time) that he wouldn’t need to change for their relationship. So, he didn’t.
“Figured you’d be out longer, you really can’t hold your liquor”
The triumph on Mycroft’s face lasted only a second, before it made way to a concerned frown. “Is my brother… alright?” John sucked in a deep breath. Well, here goes nothing.
That at last, stirred the doctor to action. More forcefully than necessary, he pushed the detective’s hands away from his jumper, and made a move to entangle himself from the blanket-cocoon. Hot shame burned deep within him- here he was being open and considerate about his feelings, and Sherlock did nothing but
smell and listened to the steady heartbeat right underneath the skin. He inhaled and concentrated very hard to stop time. It would be fucking fantastic to call in sick to spend the whole day with Sherlock. But… he was a doctor and a father. A man of principles, a man of morals, a shining example for the younger generation. And a man who was about to get in serious trouble with his boss / ex-girlfriend for being late
“You’re cold,” his voice is scratchy with the lack of use.
He shouldn’t care, he was Sherlock Holmes! But when it came to John Watson, he cared very much so. He didn’t want John to be disappointed in him. He wanted John to like him, which was absurd in itself. Nobody ever liked him. He was an insufferable egocentric bastard, the kind of person you’d avoid. But not John Hamish Watson, no sir, who limped proudly into his life and refused to leave.
. John sighed. They needed to talk about it.
The moment the doctor realized Sherlock had taken off alone once again always evoked the same emotions in his system. First came the shock. Then came the helplessness. Followed by anger. Finally: cold, terrifying, crippling panic. It was always like that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nights, where John Watson suddenly grew very quiet and doubt himself. Nobody noticed, of course, for the good doctor tried to keep his private life as private as possible. Nobody noticed, except for the man who always noticed, no one less than the world’s only consulting detective, John Watson’s best friend, Sherlock Holmes. Who choose, so very un-Sherlock-like, not to comment on the matter, wheatear out of friendliness or pity John wasn’t so sure. On these nights, the great captain, the great doctor, the proud Afghanistan survivor crumbled in the early hours of the morning in the solitude of his bedroom over the prospect of being a single-parent. He wouldn’t admit it, but he was clueless most of the time, just trying to make the very best out of the twisted situation they found themselves caught in. And he was scared. So fucking scared most of the time.
Apparently, it was all it took to get Sherlock going: “Really, I though you were smarter than that. Do you seriously believe that I’m doing this just for you, because I feel
Now, John Watson never considered himself a man of labels. Straight, gay, bisexual, what did it matter? Love whoever you like, as long as you’re happy. He had chosen his partners likewise, male or female, for all of his life. Then Sherlock happened an everything became complicated. For Sherlock was the embodiment of what one would call “complicated” and John strangely found himself attracted to Sherlock’s quirkiness. Others deemed him insane, but the sneers, the experiments, even the body parts didn’t bother him. Instead he found it endearing. Sherlock was just… Sherlock. Possibly the most authentic person John had ever met, and if John Watson fell for one thing, it was a, authentic personality. And a rush of adrenalin. And dashing looks. All three were provided by the lanky detective, who just as well happened to throw himself very forceful out of his league (“Married to my work”), forceful enough for John to never try to start… something. Forceful enough that John felt bad for even considering these feelings and politely locked them away in the darkest corner of his mind, to never be thought again. Still, all of his other dates had since blushed in comparison with the genius who waited for him at home. Oh, and then he got married to a fucking assassin who had shot the man he was so madly gone for in the chest. John Watson really had his way with the ladies. When the years rushed by, many things changed. They changed, but somehow managed to stay close, become closer even, despite all the fucking odds. They were together at Baker Street at last, after all. The only home John had ever known in London. And it was all thanks to the insufferable bastard who had the nerve to kiss him in the doorway on a Wednesday morning.
Sherlock meanwhile, a little confused by the lack of response, already built an emergency plan in case John didn’t want to hear about his silly little emotions. Just as he was about to backtrack, two warm palms encircled his cheeks and a pair of dry, but soft lips covered his own. The detective melted in the contact, gently putting more pressure in the kiss.
Almost two decades later, he found himself constantly saving one ridiculous madman. Then again, it was kind of the same thing, wasn't it? After all, John was pretty positive about the fact that Sherlock Holmes somehow managed to become his world. He couldn't quite put his finger on the exact point in time where his addiction began, all he knew that Sherlock suddenly fully occupied his heart. Sneaked inside quietly, almost unnoticed and remained, against all the odds.
He watched the slender chest rise and fall in a clam rhythm and the usually tense features of Sherlock's face softened. The man looked younger this way, almost innocent. What a strange thought, to describe Sherlock Holmes, of all people, with the attribute "innocent". But then again, in his own way he was, wasn't he?
When he looked back at his friend’s face, said friend had put all his defenses up. John instantly felt bad for getting hot-tempered.
Rosie, who was apparently very amused by her grown-up’s antics, giggled quietly.
Another hour of sweet words and gentle touches later, they laid in bed, closely cuddled together; Sherlock’s body partially splayed over John’s and John’s arms encircling his waist in a secure embrace. Just as the doctor was dozing off, Sherlock began to draw small circles on John’s t-shirt clad chest.
“Don’t push your luck”
He’s not gay, but-
“We’re off to some more fun. Did you know that there are at least four kinds of wild bees living in these woods? We saw-“
John blinked a few times and waited patiently for Sherlock to work out what he wanted to say. The genius was kind of at a loss for words, because he huffed and bit his lower lip.
The sound of the breaks interrupted John's stream of thoughts. After paying the cabbie, he unlocked the door, and tugged Sherlock to their flat; all the while with a detective sheepishly trailing behind him (and
Sherlock, who had his nose buried in some cold case files he presumably nicked from Greg’s office at some point during the day, looks up briefly and gives him one of his rare genuine smiles; the one that John likes best because his eyes crinkle around the edges good-naturedly when he does it.
Lestrade sighed, knowing then and there he had lost the battle, and did the least he could do: Pushing the very noisy and very interested Donovan and Anderson out of the room, before closing the door quietly behind himself. The voices behind the wood became louder and could still be heard clearly in the hallway. “I tried” Lestrade mumbled to himself, feeling like a right idiot for having himself thrown out of his very own office.
“I’m getting it, don’t bother, Sherlock!”
“Rosie’s quite the charmer,” John says, his voice still holding a certain panicked edge to it. So, this make-over thing is happening
The detective sighed heavily and let himself slump down next to Sherlock. “Sorry, mate. It’s not my decision”
at him? Why wasn’t he angry? Why wasn’t he… gone?
John saw it before it was coming and stopped it at the very last second. With perhaps a bit more force than necessary, he held the detective at an arm’s length.
Later, he would shake his head about the old sob he could become when he grew eager for some alone time with his partner. But in this very moment, John was so immensely grateful that Sherlock understood him and accepted him the way he was; unconditionally, easily, loving; without doubting his abilities as a father and doctor, never questioning his strength even though in his moments of vulnerability; looking past the broken façade to see the person inside.
“Greg?”
a sad sight.
wonderful human being, his John Watson.
They never officially outed their relationship, but made no efforts to hide it, either. There was a sense of silent acceptance of the new shift in their dynamics, although some voices (always the same old voices) obviously thought it had been more of a joke when John once told Lestrade that Sherlock was helping a great deal with Rosie’s upbringing. On a good day John didn’t give two fucks about their opinion about his private life. Unfortunately, today wasn’t a good day.
. To stand up. To leave the flat. To face the world. There were days when he felt a deep anxiety creep up in his chest from the moment on he opened his eyes. Those were the days, usually, when he beat himself to get to the surgery and returned as an emotionally exhausted mess. Sometimes, when the panic crushed his lungs to the point where he couldn’t breathe anymore, he made up some excuse and stayed home. He felt a deep sense of shame, on those days. He was a grown-up man. He had fought in a war. He caught criminals.  He shouldn’t be nauseated by the thought of leaving the safety of his bedroom.
The touch was feather-light and only lasted a second; but this second was enough for John to realize three fundamental things at the exact same time:
‘Thanks, I guess? -GL’
Probably sensing the doctor’s sudden uneasiness (it was an uncanny trait of all the Holmes, after all), the government official took the conversation in his own hands.
Instead of answering, Sherlock turned the phone for the DI to read. ‘Come home. -JW’
Sherlock’s face fell, just a little. He tried to cover it up quickly, with his usual mask of indifference, but John did catch a glimpse of disappointment in his eyes.
He didn’t know and couldn’t find the nerve to ask. It was typical for the detective to stay silent about emotional attachments, and although it didn’t bother John most of the time, it left him feeling antsy and on edge now. At some hours during the days, he would be sure about Sherlock’s mutual interest, at others he was lead to believe that this was nothing more than an interesting experiment for his mad genius. Something he would grow
When Sherlock had been
“Yeah” he breathed out. “Same goes for you”
John frowns, trying to remember the last time somebody had called him attractive. What an absurd concept.
Instead, he said the only things which didn’t seem hollow to him, didn’t seem fake and pretentious; the only promise he could keep: “I’m here. And I’ll stay. And I…. I’ll try, with everything I have, to not leave you alone anymore”
They stayed like this for a small eternity. They were really doing this.
Yet…so vulnerable. John had to remind himself of the significance of this moments between them- they were about to change
His own words still ring in his ears when he meets British Guy- Tan, he’s really getting good at their names- at their car
Careful not to startle the tense man, the doctor placed a warm hand on his friend’s back, gently tracing his t-shirt clad spine. The movement drew a low, but muffled purr from Sherlock. He was possibly glowing, John could feel the heat radiating from his skin through the thin cotton.
After another minute of emotional cuddling, John pulled away, wiped around at his eyes and let out a shaky sigh.
safety. You saved my life, and yet I-” he hid his face in his hands, voice coming out muffled and strained from behind his palms.
Blonde Guy… Bobby (ha!) talks to him about interior design. John’s not an expert and he tries his best to follow, but as the implications of what they’re about to do dawn on him, he finds it harder and harder to pay attention.
God, that baritone voice – now nearly three octaves lower with arousal- send a spark of warmth right to John’s cock. He concentrated on not moaning just from the sound of it, tried to get some composure here, some sort of control.
Music. One of his many escapes- clearly less destructive than some of his other habits. This, however. This wasn’t about running away. Not anymore. After Mycroft had helped him (a sentence so foreign, even in his mind), a weight slowly had been lifted his chest. Like a coil, slowly loosening its deadly grip around his mind. He understood. Himself. His past. His… urges, and needs, and...
It was the first time on a long while- since the asylum – that Sherlock picked up his violin again, shortly after Mycroft had left. The doctor put down the novel he had picked up, to watch the extraordinary genius get lost in his own melody. The younger man kept his eyes closed, as he gently let the music float through him.
“I know” his partner murmured, placing a soft kiss against the crown of John’s head.
him. Like that. Or like anything, really.
"No...as I was saying...could you stop interrupting me for a second, there?" John's voice was raised a little towards the end of his sentence, indicating a mild annoyance with the interlocuter. The detective smiled a little before he could stop himself.
“I should join into… saying things we usually leave unsaid” Sherlock raised his eyebrow in an attempt to appear indifferent and bored, but there was a vulnerable glimmer in his eyes. It was the same kind of vulnerability he had worn all evening of the day before.
“But he’s coming with us?”
‘If you’re amendable, I’d very much like to repay you for your troubles. Dinner sounds suitable? -MH’.
now? The thought sent him in such an irrational frenzy, that he buried his face against the pillow and had to make some breathing exercises before he calmed down. Just transport? Sociopath? Hell, he couldn’t even fool himself with this crap these days.
3.) Sherlock is raising his child with him, not even once complaining about it.
He didn’t think (a rare occurrence for a genius), he rushed up those stairs before his brain even had the chance to check in on him. Something about John caused him to short-circuit like that. When his consciousness went online again, he was two steps inside of the doctor’s bedroom. A small line of blue moonlight illuminated the tossing and turning figure on the bed. Sherlock’s heart gave a painful squeeze.
Sherlock, lost in kind gestures or not, was still more observant than the average human being. So, naturally, he didn’t miss the implication of John’s last statement. And he didn’t hesitate to voice his disapproval.
He closed his mouth with a snap, blushing hotly. John laughed lightly, cradling his partner’s head securely, to press a light kiss against the pointy tip of his nose.
“Caring is a disadvantage that comes with a lot of risks. I’m not afraid of taking them”
flustered.
In all of his thirty odd years of existing, nobody had ever doubted that there was something wrong with him. The doctors, his parents, the other kids, his fellow students, the Yarders… everybody knew that Sherlock Holmes was odd. That there was something… unusual, something strange about him. How could John tell him that it was alright to be this way? How could John not
The hate subsided, but the sinking feeling of being nothing but a necessity for his friend stayed, always lurking in the back of his mind when he found himself unable to fall asleep. Because Sherlock didn't do feelings. And John, after having enough time to let his heart out of the closet when the object of its desire was gone, had to admit to himself that he did feelings. In fact, did quite a lot of them when it came to a certain consulting detective. Not that it mattered. Or at least John thought so at that time. He came to this conclusion in one of the heated discussions he had with Sherlock's image in his head (even in John's mind he hadn't have the decency to not be an insufferable bastard). After staring at the untouched cup of tea (he always made one for Sherlock as well for an embarrassing long time) for a small eternity, John decided to live again. He threw Sherlock out of his head (not without a bit of struggle, the man was a stubborn one, after all) and carefully coaxed the image of the world's only consulting detective out of his heart.
Suddenly, they’re swarming out
Greg couldn’t stop the grin forming on his face. “You could say that.”
Gently, he pushed the door open and stood in front of Sherlock. The younger man cast his eyes down to communicate his confusion about John's emotional state, before he fixated John's blue eyes with a gaze that asked the silent questions he had been asking countless times in the course of their friendship: 'Did I do wrong? Are you mad at me?'
He almost had forgotten how it felt to be desirable.
John sighed, He could try to lie to Scotland Yard’s best detective inspector / one of his closest friends, sure, but John Watson wasn’t much a man of indulging in effortless trials. Instead of thinking of some white lie, he met Greg’s eyes very briefly and gave a sheepish shrug. “I guess so” After a pause, considering he could trust Lestrade, himself a father of two: “She’s been in a mood all morning. Hard to believe if you see her now” He sighed again, a little deeper this time.
"Better?" John asked after the spend almost an hour just savoring the presence of the other. He felt Sherlock nod slightly against neck. The silence felt strange to John, tho. Although he didn't really notice, Sherlock talked almost constantly when he was out of his mind palace. About his deductions, about cases, about the stupidity of the rest of mankind; to John, to himself, to the skull. A silent Sherlock was a Sherlock he wasn't used to anymore. A silent Sherlock was just like a Sherlock that wasn’t comfortable around him, a Sherlock that wasn’t his friend. A Sherlock from all these years ago.
(for he was out of his depth here). But he didn’t. He feared John wouldn’t appreciate it. Lestrade dropped it eventually.
“Sherlock. You
“So, you lied to him,” John chuckled at the sheer ridiculousness of it. The lengths they would go to with the Holmes brothers…
John stopped dead in his tracks, heart jumping in his throat. They had been tiptoeing around the ’L’-word for a while, neither of them mustering the courage to actually say it. John had been careful, he had been afraid, he didn’t really trust himself or Sherlock to manage the implications of this simple phrase. There were the secrets and the Work as the most important priority in Sherlock’s life, and the right moment was never there, so they blatantly ignored it. Until now. Now Sherlock -mad, insufferable, wonderful Sherlock - bravely says it, in the least expected of unexpected moments.
When they were off, John and Sherlock appeared to be alone in the room (save Donovan and Anderson lingering on the kitchen door nearby, probably waiting to get a glimpse of something they could gossip about).
‘No, do you mind stopping being so damn… you for a minute?!’
about it.
A man made up from contraries, a personality of dichotomy: Calculating, yet reckless; arrogant, yet insecure; brilliant, yet oblivious; all-seeing and yet so fucking
, pardon me. Right. John Watson had lost his mind. Or Sherlock Holmes had lost his mind. Maybe they both did lose their minds. Which made a three-year-old the only sane person in the flat. Lovely… just… lovely. Was he certain he had woken up this morning? Maybe all of this was a really weird dream, it had to be, not in a million years would Sherlock… would he?  “Technically, I just did” If the grin would grow any bigger, John would have to punch it off his face. Or kiss it off his face. Preferable the second of the two options (Woah, where the fuck did that come from?!).
Rosie Watson was also an incredibly smart toddler, much to the delight of her best friend, Sherlock Holmes. Her vocabulary was way above average for her age group, she found delight in solving little puzzles, and learned new skills twice as fast as any child John Watson had ever witnessed. He blamed on the proximity to his genius flatmate for most of her time awake. Rosie adored Sherlock, it was blatantly obvious. She loved the new words he taught her, or the fun chemical experiments they conducted (“Nothing poisonous, John, I assure you!”), or when he played the violin for her, or when he praised for being so smart. She was giddy and happy as soon as Sherlock was in sight, and wouldn’t stop bouncing until he picked her up and let her play with his curls. He had had his doubts, John had to admit it. Sherlock and a toddler was an equation he would have never dreamed of in his lifetime. It was simply absurd- the great sociopath, the stone-cold detective, the genius scientist- reading a children’s book about bees while patting one Rosie Watson’s hair. However, wonders never ceased to occur when it came to Sherlock Holmes, for John found that he underestimated his flatmate’s skill when it came to children (and apparently, Rosie’s charm in winning the “sociopath” over).  Sherlock adored Rosie about as much as she adored him. Most of the time, when not out on a case, Sherlock babysat Rosie while John was out for the surgery. The first year had been rough; his daughter hadn’t been an easy baby, but Sherlock had proven himself as a gentle presence, a caring friend, and simply all the things John wouldn’t have never thought he could be. Now, two years later, the three of them were a fantastic team. John was endlessly grateful for Sherlock just being… Sherlock with a touch more gentleness, affection, caring. Something about watching his best friend idly coloring with his little princess at the living-room table while “Frozen” (Still Rosie’s favorite) blasted in the background and Nana Hudson’s biscuit crumbles were still stuck on their hands made John’s heart swell. It was a love he had never known, a love he never found himself deserving of, a love that radiated from the idle display of affection between the treasure of his life, and the wonderful mad-genius-bastard he called his best friend. It was the part of the day he looked most forward to: Coming home to his favorite people in the whole wide world. Life, so it seemed, was finally kind to John Watson.
For the first time, the realization of being in love with his best friend didn’t evoke melancholy longing of a past left behind, but felt… empowering. This-
... oh God, where was John?! (was that John's hand on his neck? Or was she choking him?) Why couldn't he find John's room? The room flooded with light, smelling of tea and gunpowder and woolly jumpers? Where was it? Why was everything black, thrown in utter chaos?!
“Excellent, because there is nothing to debate about. This visit is not happening”
The day where he witnessed Sherlock Holmes, self-declared sociopath and general git, pulling his brother Mycroft Holmes, condescending politician with a dislike for people, into a hug.
He gave a shaky smile back, letting himself be dragged towards the crime scene, passing some Yarders whose presence normally delighted him but today caused an overwhelming sensation of distress in his chest. He wasn’t ready to be among people, he realized suddenly, and yet here he was. Exposed.
They’re happily perched up at the front door, cameras and everything, ringing the door-bell like there’s no tomorrow. The door buzzes open a second later and cluttering can be heard by the time the Fab 5 plus entourage are climbing the seventeen stairs (Antoni up first, because he is like super-sporty) up to 221 B.
in any way (although he felt like, really weak, in like, every way). Just when he thought how ridiculous it was and mustered the courage to cross the damn room to sink into Sherlock’s arms (aka the thing he wanted to for all fucking day) Watson pride be dammed; Sherlock moved, elegant as always, crossing the room in three long strides and halting right in front of John. The smile on his lips was only betrayed by the hint of worry shining in his eyes.
John almost chuckled. Really, for someone who dreadfully hated anyone stating the obvious, the statement was so sweetly un-Sherlock-like that John felt the urge to kiss him, just for the sweetness of it.
The Holmes brothers, as it turned out, had never been camping in their posh life and it showed. They were spectacularly useless when it came to putting up tents, so much so that even gentle-soul-John-Watson
Sherlock wasn't an easy person, and extraordinary (in every sense of the word); and John sometimes just couldn't belief that he somehow managed to gain the trust of this particular man. The fall had proven that Sherlock's care could hurt like a knife to the chest, but the wound healed with the notion of the very concept of said care. Sherlock normally didn't care, but John picked up the little clues that he, old, dull, throughout ordinary John Watson, managed to break the genius’s barriers. In moments like these, the feelings that John very much did and acknowledged since the fall pushed themselves forcefully to the surface.
“No more women, no more dates” The doctor stated firmly. “Just you and me. If that’s alright with you”
It wasn't the intensity of the emotion itself- the doctor had dealt with enough young men watching all of their comrades die and barely surviving themselves back in the army to know how much agony the human psyche had to endure. It was the sheer fact that Sherlock, of all people the one who denied the most human part of himself, was falling apart in front of him. John wanted to punch a wall and cursed the whole universe, and everyone in it who had ever hurt Sherlock. He wasn't fair, he mused. Sherlock was- well not sweet or caring, but Sherlock was a human after all; a human with a heart (although he'd deny it). He shouldn't feel this amount of pain. He should feel loved, because that's what he was (at least as far as John was concerned). He shouldn't hide and be afraid of his own sentiment, he should embrace it. Feelings shouldn't be this destroying. He vowed to himself, while drawing soothing circles on his best friend's shivering back, that he would show Sherlock. He would show Sherlock that it was wonderful to feel.
“Can we cut this short, Graham? I apologize if it puts you all at ease, and if you excuse us now, we’ll be off to-“
"I can't make tea onehanded" the doctor explained, an amused smile playing on his lips. Who would have known that someone as arrogant and obnoxious as Sherlock could be this adorable?! Sherlock gave a curt nod (so tea it is) and clumsily shrugged off his Belfast. "Get changed in something more comfy, will you?" John requested from the kitchen, because Sherlock still stood in the doorway, looking a bit at his wits end.
They had never talked about this. And now they were well on their way and horribly unprepared. Sherlock swallowed a lump down in his throat. This was the moment he should show courage, he should start protecting John, start to make use of his promise. If only, it wouldn’t be so damn hard. Suddenly, John wasn’t the only vulnerable one on the bed. “John I-“
look, and his friend stared back, equally stubborn. His eyes flickered to Greg, who no doubt found the situation beyond
Mycroft chuckled humorlessly. “Who would blame him? You invited
On any other occasion, the doctor would have sighed and rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s straight-forwardness, but now it was strangely comforting, having the detective treat him like he always treated him; like John wasn’t a changed man because of this. Determined to answer, John realized that he still didn’t really know what to say. He was ashamed of being broken, ashamed of needing the comfort so dearly, ashamed of clinging to Sherlock like some child. Ashamed of being treated like a partner when he was anything but.
“Well, that’s our call!” he announces cheerily and busying himself with some oven-gloves, while the camera team rushes back over. Rosie is delighted at the attention Antoni directs her way as soon as the cake is out of the oven; cooing at her and showing her all the different yummy fruits that will go on her very special birthday cake.
Now, he’s nervous.
Damn John Watson, with his kind heart! Actually, hang on, more like: Damn Sherlock Holmes with his analytical brain!
Sherlock still talked when they got out of the cap, still talked while John freshened himself up, changed, and put his jacket on again. Just as he was about to leave the flat, Sherlock paused.
Sherlock let out an unmanly sound of relief and huddled next to his best friend.
Said duo of mischief-makers wandered off to scout the grounds, off to the lake that was located at one of the edges of the small wood. Mycroft wandered around for good fifteen minutes, lamenting the sad fate of his designer shoes which wouldn’t survive this trip unharmed.
Directed at Mycroft, he added, “Camping isn’t so bad after all, huh princess?”
“That women yesterday” his hands were trembling lightly. “The nurse, with the teeth gap and the strong Irish accent, she had given you a paper- her number, no doubt. And I assumed, falsely as I now realize, that the whole sharing a bed, and kissing and….sexual thing would somehow create an exclusive bond between us, so the prospect of you flirting with her was… it did….” He groaned again, for he was unable to find words that did not make him sound like the inexperienced idiot that he
“John-”
Lestrade let out a long-drawn sigh. “Don’t be. We are just wrapping up. T’was a rough one, but Sherlock was brilliant, as usual” John gave a curt nod, not really up for chats about the case or Sherlock’s brilliance. Lestrade, oblivious to John’s mood hummed quietly when he watched Sherlock talking to the giggling toddler. “He’s doing fantastic with this, would have never guessed it. The little lady is absolutely gone on him”
“I thought we would spend the evening together”
is why parents should get their children tested. John liked the Holmes, he did, but he couldn't disagree more with their way of handling problems. He wasn't sure if Sherlock would be different, genius wise, if it played out differently years ago; but he was almost completely certain that life would be a little easier for his friend. But that was no use now, the damage was already done (although he would call Mycroft to have one hell of a talk with the British Government).
“What are the orders, captain? Shall we go hunt for treasures in the sand, or tackle the wild fish some more?”
John watched silently as Sherlock entangled himself from his brother; his face open and almost…. Shy? Mycroft’s icy mask had melted once more, and the smile he gave his brother was the most genuine John had ever seen. It was the closest to a ‘You’re forgiven’ they would ever get.
‘No’, he told himself. ‘Not today’.
Song: Impossible Year (Death of a Bachelor)
He was aware they had forced him to delete her. They knew he could delete things; he had been extraordinary right from the beginning on. Psychology was an extraordinary force, with powers most people don’t even begin to grasp. Sherlock grasped it. He understood. But for the first time in all of his life, he had no desire to find out how the process had taken place whatsoever. All he knew (and felt safe knowing) he hadn’t wanted to forget, but they made him and the child inside of him didn’t know how and felt utterly betrayed, especially by his brother. Although they never were best friends, Sherlock guessed they must have been closer (according to the few fragmented memories of a time before the void and the way Mycroft kept saving his life.) Mycroft had always strangely valued his life (out of guilt, pure egoistic reasons. He couldn’t care for him. He was the one who taught him NOT to care), even in times when Sherlock didn’t care about it, times where the prospect of dying was a welcome relief to the prospect of living another day. Times where he desperately tried to fill the black voids in his mind with
