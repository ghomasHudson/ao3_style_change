Holmes was a strange creature, a primal,
I was in the foyer, returning from a brief errand at the chemist's, when I heard him swear black and blue at—of all things—the newspaper. I ran up the stairs accordingly, divesting myself of coat, hat, and cane, and found him half crumpled upon the settee, having caught himself upon the arm-rest in a futile attempt to rescue the
"I've sent a telegram to Lestrade, Holmes. I hope he is not partly responsible for the state you are in, for I am quite certain I shall never forgive him—and I would dearly hate to lose my temper with the man. No: I would be quite content if I only had to be angry at
Horror flooded me. In a moment I was by Mrs Hudson's side, and with trembling fingers sought Holmes' pulse at his neck. I found it, uneasily, but it was sluggish and slow, and Holmes did not react; his eyes did not open, and his mouth did not moan. Blood pooled underneath him.
It had broken. I could not believe it.
When at last I surrendered him to sleep, it was almost midnight. I knew that, whatever had happened that I could not know, I could do nothing more. He might heal, and live; he might not; nothing I could do would change the matter in any way, apart from keeping his bandage clean and trying to get his fever to come down. Mrs Hudson relayed me at his side, while I ate, numbly, some bread and ham, and poured myself a glassful of brandy, which I badly needed. Then I thought of Lestrade—surely
"Do you," I said, stung.
His clothing had to be cut away from his torso. He was wearing a coarse, plain coat, and underneath a shirt of rough linen, and only once we had removed both could we at last see the wound itself: it was thin, and remarkably small, and a trickle of blood poured incessantly from it. I sent Carlson to fetch bandages, rubbing alcohol, and my sewing kit, which I kept in my room; Mrs Hudson, to fetch very hot water, and a cloth, to clean it. Once they had gone, I found that to remain alone with Holmes insensate beside me was a painful predicament. He had not awoken. It was a very strange thing indeed, for Holmes always had a brightness to him, a vitality, even when he was powerfully still; now he was silent as a statue, pale as marble.
"Wat—son."
I ascertained quite quickly that he had suffered a stabbing injury in the lower abdomen, and lost a deal of blood. Mrs Hudson was dispatched to fetch the constabulary, while I attempted to see whether he was harmed in any other way. I had seen many such injuries while in the war, and knew—all too well!—how devastating they may prove to be. Holmes was unresponsive, and impossibly pale.
I sat.
knew what Holmes had been up to; I certainly remembered seeing him in our drawing-room the day before Holmes had disappeared. I resolved on sending him a telegram. He might apprise me of the facts.
I did not sleep. I am quite certain that I did not. But when I looked up again Holmes' hand was resting on my head, his fingers sifting through my hair. In my shock, I did not object; nor did I, in fact, find it in any way extraordinary.
There is not much to tell of the following hours. I cleaned, stitched, and bandaged the wound, as efficiently as I could—which was, in fact, quite efficiently, for I found in myself the same calm, the same certainty I had felt during my military years. Another physician was called, to be wholly certain that I forgot nothing, and confirmed my diagnosis: the wound had not become infected, but very possibly a vital organ had been grazed or nicked, for it was quite deep. There was simply no way to know. Only time would tell: time, and healing.
It was with a great deal of trepidation, therefore, that I heard a banging upon the front door—and then, as I stood from my writing-desk, heard the door open, and Mrs Hudson's shout of terror.
I blinked, and could find nothing to say. Indeed, I did not think I had anything worthwhile to say at all. Seeing me stupefied, he laughed a short, disbelieving laugh, and would have pulled his hand away from mine, had I not held on to it like a lifeline.
Mrs Hudson found me. I do not know how long I had been there. "Doctor Watson—"
I stared at him. "Certainly, but—"
He looked at me, unspeaking, for a long, long moment. "Very—well," he said softly. He was, by that point, more or less upright, resting entirely against the pillows, though his hand was still clenched in mine. "Shall I tell you … something I have never told anyone before, Watson?"
When I returned to the bedroom, Holmes was scrunched away on his side, his cheek flat against the pillow. I had bathed him earlier, and carefully moved him into one of his clean nightgowns; but it had ridden up, and I could now see the small of his back where the bedcovers had been pushed down. He was breathing in soft, soft gasps.
It was a long, strange night. Holmes was by turns brightly conscious of his surroundings and queasily unaware; at times I thought he did not see me, but something, or someone else instead, and the fury and fear I saw in his gaze in such moments shook me very badly. I was not unaccustomed to my friend's anger, for it manifested itself towards any sort of injustice in his path, any misdealing of justice. But the fear … the fear I did not understand. Did he see his attacker? Who was he looking at, in such a terrible, powerful moment?
"Watson—"
Holmes had been in a mordant humour since he had awoken. Sulky and disagreeable by turns, he seemed on the fast track to slipping into a dark mood. He resented his lack of mobility, and had to take a certain amount of morphine to dull the pain in his midsection; what was more, he appeared to resent
My laughter withered away. We were both holding the newspaper; in fact, we were inches apart. I had been careful to keep a certain distance between us, for I did not want to overwhelm him. Now it seemed he was intent on breaching that gap.
John had thought about going down to Barts several times already. The chemistry was more than beyond his abilities, but that was usually the case during the many long hours they’d spent holed up in the lab, and still he’d been able to keep himself busy with menial tasks, just content to radiate companionship if nothing else.
People often assumed Sherlock liked silence just because he told them to shut up all the time. But, as usual, they were wrong. Although he despised people's insipid blathering, he didn’t like silence. More often than not he needed sound to think. Sherlock did his best thinking while playing the violin, or talking to John. He liked to talk. After all, people who have remarkable things to say should talk more often than other people. (It’s just as that rabbit from that children’s film had said, “If you can't say anything interesting, don’t say anything at all.” Sherlock firmly believed the world would be a better place if more people followed this advice, even if it had been said by a talking rabbit.)
“At this point he has no one to blame but himself,” Sherlock said, leading the way. “For a DI it’s embarrassingly easy to steal from him.”
Sherlock blinked down at the cookie in amazement. It wasn't just any cookie either. It was exactly the same kind as the one Sherlock had stolen from John more than half a year ago. They had been reviewing case notes at a café. John had bought a cookie with his coffee and when he stepped out to take a call from Mary Sherlock had decided he’d try a piece. It tasted good. Really good. By the time John returned to the table the cookie had vanished completely. Sherlock had shrugged as though the mystery were beyond his abilities.
The strength and energy in the detective’s sinewy muscles was provocatively different from the soft curves John was used to. Sherlock’s body was firm, powerful, challenging, directly opposed to the supple and pliant form that John had found attractive in women. And yet John discovered that the more he felt the more he wanted the challenge.
“Camera,” Sherlock said, throwing on his suit jacket and buttoning it. “Let’s go.” He walked toward the door and swung his coat on.
Silence.
Sherlock looked back at him.
Sherlock realised his error as soon as he said it. It wasn't 'our' flat; John didn't live there anymore. Neither John nor Mrs. Hudson seemed to notice.
But wait, Sherlock had a brother, didn’t he? An older brother. She had met him once. He’d looked… important. He must be able to help.
“Precisely.”
“Eager to continue,” Sherlock sneered.
John shot Sherlock a warning look. As usual it went unheeded.
Sherlock continued to look at him.
There was nothing to do but wait.
They sat in the two wooden, cushioned chairs she indicated.
With some resignation John took the detective’s (for once ungloved) hand, feeling the warmth of his skin tingle up his arm. When he got to his feet he felt incredibly light. His skin was humming, nerves seeming to respond in double to any contact. As a doctor, John did not condone the use of recreational drugs; however, he had to admit that the current sensation was not unpleasant. His hand felt cold when Sherlock let it go.
Sherlock’s words to Mary echoed in his mind:
Sherlock was the first friend he’d ever had that he not only cared about keeping, but had found himself utterly destroyed at his loss. It had taken him two years to not even remotely get over losing Sherlock.
“It doesn’t matter!” Sherlock suddenly turned and grabbed the lapels of John’s jacket and his eyes turned grey. “It went out the window with the glasses and the flowers.” John looked around and it was true. Shards and stems of shattered champagne glasses gleamed on the pavement around them. And flower petals, purple and yellow, were falling around them, settling lightly over the pieces of broken glass.
“Oh, no thank you dear, I’m just on my way out. I only wanted to pop in to drop off some biscuits,” she said, walking to the kitchen and placing them on the worktop. “Homemade; I thought you might like them.”
His phone lit up just a minute later.
It had crossed his mind some time ago that he might starve to death if Mrs. Hudson didn't regularly bring up tea and biscuits. This point seemed to have occurred to Mrs. Hudson as well, since tea and biscuits had gradually morphed into tea and roast beef sandwiches, or tea and soup, or tea and pasta. Tea and pasta. That was Mrs. Hudson for you. He rarely ate much of it, but at least he appreciated the option when he wasn’t too busy being annoyed by the landlady’s interruptions.
John’s expression softened. “I suppose I don’t mind reminding you why you keep me around every once in a while.” He started to walk. Someone would have heard the shots; he’d be surprised if the police weren’t already on their way. As good as Mycroft was at cover-up he’d still rather not be standing over the dead body when the public arrived.
Or perhaps it was just further evidence that John was indeed mad. Sherlock leapt to his feet and held out his hand. John took it, allowing Sherlock to help him to his feet.
Interesting. Besides the few weeks following the pool there had been no nightmares when John lived at Baker Street. Why had he lied?
Sherlock’s face was blank. “Who owns the club?”
"I don't want to, but I'm not like you"—he lifted his arm and ran his hand through Sherlock's hair, pushing it back from his face—"I can't control these things like you can."
John cleared his throat, nudging his friend.
John lifted his eyebrows. The unsolicited opinions of Sherlock Holmes on the women in his life would make for colourful reading.
Dej mi další podložní sklíčko -- Get me another slide.
Mycroft resolved one evening after some friends of the family walked out angrily following their crying child. If Sherlock wasn’t going to play the game—the society game where people interacted in pre-set ways according to strict rules—then he would have to protect him from it.
Sherlock exhaled in a longsuffering way. “We have no reason to believe our three victims are the only people with these scars. They’re only the ones who’ve died.”
By the time John got out of the shower it was still only six thirty. He looked at the receipt-less tux on his bed. Sherlock Holmes was nothing if not manipulative.
So John set about calling his colleagues, asking them to cover his appointments while he was away. They were more than happy to oblige, considering John had spent the past year picking up as many of their unwanted shifts as he could in favour of spending the time at home.
“Mycroft’s flat. He rarely uses it.”
Lestrade sighed. No luck. But to be fair, Sherlock had already given him more in a few minutes than his entire forensic team had all day.
Sherlock glared at him.
John raised his eyebrows at her increasing vehemence and she checked the rise in her voice, taking a breath. Clearly she had strong opinions on the subject. She’d been living the controversy herself since she was fifteen.
“You don’t cry,” Sherlock muttered.
John shrugged. “I didn’t think it was important. How was Switzerland, by the way?”
“Bit of a mess in here,” John commented, looking around with an amused expression.
“That’s very random of you, John,” Sherlock said, turning around. “You need to keep your head in the game.” He shoved the bag into John’s arms.
, Sherlock thought wryly as he lifted his hands, walking toward Moran and the others. There was a loud hum of an industrial sized air conditioner: climate control for optimal drug storage.
She grinned sheepishly. “Ah, you’re speaking English again; that’s good.”
“Such confidence.” Alexa stood up and moved over to give Sherlock his share of the lap dance. “What makes you so sure?”
“With appropriate pomp and circumstance.”
John shook his head in disbelief before tossing the phone back on the desk. What to do when your deluded flatmate thinks he can have a row with you in the morning and order you around in the afternoon. Sherlock could do an interview by himself today. Sherlock could bugger off today.
“It’s nice,” he said.
Redbeard had originally been a birthday gift for Mycroft the year before Sherlock was born. His name was Charlie then. But Mycroft, six years old at the time, hadn’t been interested. The puppy was messy and chaotic and dumb and he didn’t really understand how to play with it, or why doing so would be desirable. The puppy, probably sensing his disinterest, had never taken to him either. But Charlie fell in love with Sherlock right away, sniffing and licking the baby, and wagging his tail when Sherlock laughed. Mycroft remembered the dog used to sit by, watching like a concerned nanny while Sherlock crawled around the living room. In Mycroft’s memory he had always been Sherlock’s dog.
Sherlock had no idea what time it was, what day it was.
“Please.”
“That’s not what I meant.”
“Oh my, aren’t you handsome!” she said to Sherlock upon opening her door.
chair. Sherlock had moved it away after the wedding, and then moved it back after Mary shot him. Sherlock had convinced John to forgive Mary, but the chair had stayed. Was it an invitation for him to come back? A sign that Sherlock knew he
The skeleton face turned toward him. “These people are professionals, John. By all accounts they’ve been operating for years undetected. Such an amateur mistake is not likely.”
He couldn’t hear. He couldn’t see. His eyes had fallen shut and were not interested in opening again. John was pushing back against him, walking him backward, and Sherlock let him, trusting in a way he could never trust anyone else.
But often the appeal of evenings at 221B was just sharing the space. Out of all the hair-raising, life-threatening, bizarre and incredible events they had been though, interestingly the clearest memories—in his years away from Baker Street, the memories that came back to him with the strongest sensory power—were an array of seemingly banal moments from the 221B living room: Watching Sherlock’s intense concentration on a microscope from over the top of a medical journal; Sherlock leaning over his shoulder to look at something he’d found on his laptop; Sherlock proudly announcing a pleasing experiment result or flinging a disappointing one out the window; Sherlock berating the telly; Sherlock laughing out loud at his comments about certain members of the media or Scotland Yard; finding new places to hide Sherlock’s cigarettes; Sherlock’s stunned expression when, after whinging on for an hour, John threw a packet of biscuits at his head.
good. Sherlock could feel the quality of it, nerves singing out in pleasure as the drug swept waves of numbing bliss throughout his body. Actually, if he had to die, he supposed dying high would be significantly preferable to dying sober. Perhaps he should thank them.
John closed his eyes. His legs were warm where they were folded with Sherlock's. Body heat was radiating in the gap between their chests. Sherlock's breath was warm on his skin. Well, John didn't mind. If Sherlock was finally sleeping John was not going to wake him. He didn't seem uncomfortable.
Moran laughed. “We’re hoping you’ll live to get our surprise. But don’t worry if you don’t. It’s a win-win situation for us. Good luck, Mr. Holmes.”
The detective seemed built for formal dress—a point which clearly hadn’t escaped him, due to the extreme ‘pyjamas or suits’ dichotomy of his wardrobe. His long legs and lean figure were precisely what suits were designed for, and it showed. But this tuxedo was something else entirely.
John tried to walk toward the voice, but the sound was illusory. As soon as he was certain he heard it in one direction he was just as sure he’d heard it in another.
Then he was in the living room again, in front of John. John was talking.
“I’ll hold you to that, Sherlock,” she said, severe eyes unblinking. “Because if he gets hurt, and you’re not dead first, know that I’ll kill you fast after.”
The answer presented itself immediately: Carl Reeves. Carl Reeves was the connection. He had been hired by Moran. The bullet that grazed John’s arm, the bullet that had been meant for Sherlock, it had been soaked in the poison.
"I feel like a right idiot," John muttered, still moving through the steps.
“Sherlock,” he said with his eyes closed, pulling himself up to a sitting position.  He blinked, attempting to focus through the haze of sleep. He looked dazed—the kind of confusion that results from being jerked directly out of REM. “Are you leaving?”
Christmas gift.
come back? John dismissed that train of thought. There was no understanding Sherlock’s motives until he explained them. No use guessing.
But John supposed something like ‘Our First Night Back as Flatmates’ would fall under the ‘sentimental’ category, and therefore wasn’t something Sherlock was likely to acknowledge. So he set about typing up the rest of the notes from their newest case, ordering a takeaway, and then hooking his laptop up to the telly to watch some old Flying Circus episodes. The absurdity and general silliness of the Monty Python series was a welcome familiarity and pleasant contrast to the relentless drama of his real life.
“No,” Sherlock said, already turning away.
"I don't have to."
“Oh, but we just—” Hannah started.
, Sherlock?”
“Yeah, but, I mean, you played it…” John trailed off, apparently looking for the words. “
and he was sure he was losing his grip on sobriety, because the cold fear of an overdose is a short-term memory, and in the maddening silence of his flat Sherlock was forgetting the point of being sober at all.
Sherlock looked down at John’s hand, startled.
He was shocked when she wouldn’t agree to give him the information unless he met her for coffee. She had something to say to him. John was on the verge of telling her he’d have no trouble finding a divorce lawyer elsewhere when she said, “John, please. I think it’s important.”
"Very original."
John looked at him. “You aren’t serious.”
How many times since then had he encountered John in his mind palace, in a dream, only to witness John place his gun in his mouth, sinking to his knees in front of Sherlock, resting its length on his tongue?
Sherlock had responded laconically.
“There are exactly twelve different types of perfume with the same ash quality,” Sherlock was saying. “That’s why I can always tell.”
“How do you know we’re cops?” John asked a bit defiantly.
The two of them presented quite a picture, standing alone on a path at the edge of the cliffs, John in his jogging bottoms and Sherlock in his dramatic Belstaff coat, glaring daggers at each other.
“Stop it, just stop it!”
John waited, half expecting the same response he’d gotten the last time.
“You know why we’re here.” Sherlock’s voice drifted lazily from beside John. “You wouldn’t have let us through the doorway if you weren’t going to tell us what we need to know. So let’s be quick.”
“And how do you suppose I’m going to distract a prostitute? Hm? I don’t suppose they have Scrabble there, do you?”
“We’ve got to talk to her brother before she does,” Sherlock said, swinging open the door.
Sherlock furrowed his eyebrows in disdain. “What kind of message is that? I don’t need permission from Mycroft for anything, let alone—
John cleared his throat. He knew it must have been as unpleasant for her to come here as it had been for him. “Fine.”
His mind palace was many things, but it was not subtle. The Moriarty in his mind had been quite explicit about embodying his flaws: the crack in the lens, the virus in the hard drive. The confrontation, then, in the living room of 221B, had been a confrontation not with the man who was Jim Moriarty, but with one of his own fears. When the Feelings Closet was secured shut he was able to write it off as his fear of ignorance (
“Why not? In case the dead man comes back to finish me off?” Sherlock sneered.
Sherlock reappeared in the living room fully dressed. John gaped at him, still sitting on the floor. Was Sherlock Superman? Could he have lived with him this long and not known?
The couples took their places on the floor, and John desperately ran through everything Sherlock had taught him when he'd been preparing for his wedding. The song would be a waltz, Mrs. Avery kindly informed him. He knew he could manage all right if he could just remember the steps.
“You’re going to get him killed and you know it. If you really cared about him you wouldn’t allow him to stay with you.”
Sherlock held himself defiantly still as the syringe was pushed into the vein just below his collar bone.
) person you need. A person you would spend whatever wretched remaining years you had suffocating without.
“So, fish and chips? Or cake”—Sherlock put on his most benevolent air—“you can choose.”
“We live in a revolutionary time for sexuality.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said, and he truly was. “I should have told you I was alive.” He really should have.
It was hard to see through the fog. Though there wasn’t really fog, was there?
John watched in resignation as the mad detective rushed around the room, banging drawers open and shut, and then in dismay as he realised the things Sherlock was haphazardly tossing from the wardrobe were his.
Sherlock must have read the anger in his face because he said softly, “It’s not bad. You have one too.”
John sighed in defeat. ‘Persistence’ was one of Sherlock’s many fine attributes, and John seemed to have learned early on that his quality of life was much improved when he allowed Sherlock to have his way.
John looked down uncomfortably.
“John!” Sherlock barked. “Get her out of this flat at once!”
“Oh this poison!” Sherlock couldn’t help saying out loud for the second time. “Absolutely delightful.” He reached for another blood film and readjusted his microscope.
“An interested party?” John asked, looking up from the photograph.
"A professional can lead with his hips."
“Why don’t you want to see her?”
journals.
“Didn’t,” she repeated, face dropping a bit. “We’d gone from the restaurant to a bar and it was quite late when I got a call from my brother.”
John stopped walking. “What?”
And then Sherlock had come back with Candyland and they'd both lost it entirely, John keeling over onto his side and Sherlock brushing tears from his eyes.
John lowered the phone and Sherlock’s hand slid down his arm, landing partly over the phone and partly over John’s hand. John waited but Sherlock didn’t move it, perhaps to prevent him from trying to call again. Perhaps he had fallen back to sleep.
Automatic actions: Tighten and rosin bow, attach shoulder rest, tune by ear for perfect pitch.
Sherlock’s eyes didn’t leave the screen. “Why didn't you tell me she was dead?”
“Lestrade,” Sherlock said, indicating his phone. “Sent him the completed Rodgers case. All wrapped up nice and pretty with a paper trail even he can follow. He really should be paying me more.”
“Biographers!” Moriarty blew out an exaggerated breath, jerking him out of his revere. “They’re just
John smiled to himself, wondering when he had become such a total nutter. It was probably the day he'd agreed to move in with Sherlock Holmes.
“Never mind. That’s a bit rough though isn’t it? Cutting people during sex?”
John swallowed and looked away. “I thought you called me,” he said, directing his words out over the cliffs, “because you didn’t want to die, and you thought I could give you a good enough reason to live.”
“This way,” Sherlock said, walking toward the kitchen.
When he hadn’t come back that first night John had sent a text to Mycroft.
There was a short silence.
He only had to wait a minute for a response.
When John awoke he immediately sensed something was wrong. He turned his head and bolted upright.
Sherlock lifted his chin to meet John’s eyes. “Good. You’d be wrong if you didn’t.”
Sherlock swung his coat on over his shoulders. “That was
"I really love your blog," she breathed. "You tell the stories so well."
“The bank clerk who’s been divorced twice, has two children, three grandchildren, asthma, and a secret obsession with
“Are you going to write them up for it?” she asked.
"Shut up."
The streets of London slid by under his feet as he unconsciously navigated their twists and turns, breath clouding in the night air, oblivious to all passers-by in a kind of walking meditation. His head was buzzing with the memory of John pressed against him behind the cemetery monument, the memory of that alleyway kiss, John's mouth warm beneath his...
He raked his hand through his hair, sensory memories of John’s hands hot on his skin. The look in his eyes, the low growl of his voice— Sherlock took a long drag, letting the smoke burn the taste of him from his mouth. God, what had he done?
In holding up the victim’s arm Sherlock’s coat sleeve had slipped down and Lestrade was surprised to see some angry bruising around the detective’s own wrist. Sherlock noticed his sightline and glanced involuntarily at John before tugging his sleeve back up. Odd. Maybe John wasn’t as patient with Sherlock as Lestrade thought.
An opposing player was sprinting toward him with the ball. John threw himself forward, smashing into a body moving full speed. He hit the ground hard, but he was up again in a flash. His teammate passed the ball backward and he caught it, tearing up the field to gain valuable ground. He somersaulted forward when he was tackled around his legs and he landed on his back.
“Mycroft Holmes,” Mycroft Holmes said, stepping forward to shake the doctor’s then Lestrade’s hand. Lestrade took one look and estimated that the man’s suit might cost more than his car. “You must be Detective Inspector Lestrade. Please accept my apology for the trouble my little brother has caused you tonight.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock held his gaze until John shifted uncomfortably, crossing his arms and looking away across the street again. He glanced back and met Sherlock’s eyes briefly as he said, “She’s not my type."
Sherlock stopped pacing. His eyes locked with John’s across the living room and John pushed forward recklessly.
Only a year or two into our friendship, I found it was not unusual for Sherlock Holmes to absent himself from Baker Street for several days at a time, while he was on a case. Nor, indeed, was it unusual for me to find him asleep upon our settee the morning after, still half-dressed in one of his spectacular disguises, in such a state of exhaustion that he had not found the strength to return to his room, and had merely crumpled down where he was.
—and though I could imagine the source of his black humour, I did not entirely know how to address it.
"Forgive me," I murmured, against my hands. "I—something came over me."
So I would have, indeed, had not Holmes taken matters into his own hands.
"Tell me something else," I pleaded.
was the one of us with irregular sleeping habits, and he woke me far more often than I him.
He considered me, eyes narrowing. "At least I believed that I ought. Watson—" There he reached for my hand, which I gave him gladly. The narrow stare became a disbelieving look, and then, much more slowly, something entirely different: fondness and relief melding together. He said:
"Am I?" he said, in a vague voice. Already I
I called for Mrs Hudson directly. When she came, I informed her that Holmes was alive, and likely to remain so. I instructed her to make some nourishing porridge, which I didn't doubt he would throw at my head, and then excused myself, for I badly needed a change of clothing.
"Don't blame—Lestrade," he added, with a sigh.
Once, I said, half-laughing with the sort of morbid humour one feels on a deathbed: "Was it for a good cause, Holmes?"
I kissed him then. I do not think I could have done anything else.
Dying! The thought shook me to my core. I staggered out of the room, for a moment blind and deaf to anything that was not the terror of losing Holmes, and sank down upon the settee.
"I'm here, Holmes." On impulse, I reached for his hand. He held it with a surprisingly firm grip, but his eyes fell shut again. "Holmes?"
Some time later, he made a wounded sound as I exerted a little too much pressure upon his side, and then the bandages had to be changed; and then, of course, as evening was falling fast, there was little sense in remaining in the drawing-room, when Holmes' bedroom was only a step away.
On this April afternoon, however, I was growing increasingly worried. Holmes had been missing for four days—that was not particularly unusual, and yet I felt uneasy: he would often send word, by telegram, of his well-being, if he knew he must be absent longer than a day or two. I had received no such missive.
was rather fantastic, and I laughed.
A snort. It seemed Holmes was perfectly capable of understanding me, but less so of replying in kind. When his eyes opened again, they were glassy. His fever had not abated. I kept up a meaningless stream of talk, explaining the circumstances of his arrival on our doorstep, the kindness of constabulary Carlson, Mrs Hudson's worry for his well-being, and for mine. I attempted to deduce his whereabouts these last few days, and must have failed abysmally, for his lips curled in a slight smile. He watched me, however, with a close certainty, as though my voice was keeping him awake. I knew, with a deep certainty born less of my years of experience than of a simple gut instinct, that I must keep him awake at all costs. Sleep was beneficial, to be sure, but I was deathly afraid that he might—that some internal hemorrhage might cause him to—slip away in repose.
Having consented to this, and insisted that she should take some rest, for she could not stay up all night, I found myself at a loss for what to do. I hated to be silent by Holmes' side; together we found often many topics of conversation, many arguments to quarrel on, so that silence was only ever that comfortable quiet that two friends who have no hurry to talk could share. This silence was bitter and disagreeable.
The constabulary was a man named Carlson, and quite strong. He and I gently, gently gathered Holmes between us, and maneuvered him up the stairs into our drawing-rooms, and then, when we felt that we could do so without bringing harm to him, into his own bedroom. There we laid him down upon the bed.
Holmes had not awoken.
"So I made it home after all," he murmured. "I was not certain, you see." His voice was hoarse and painful, as though it had been torn to shreds. "I am very glad to see you, my boy."
like that (possibly wasn’t interested in
He smiled in spite of himself. “Yeah, definitely.”
“Come now, Sherlock, you know you don’t have to tell me to leave. I must be the busiest man in London on a Sunday. I couldn’t possibly stay another minute." He reached the door and turned back. "Don't try to leave. Your doctor says you're still in danger of suffering another collapse. You were lucky to come out of it this time; I wouldn't count on luck again."
They were both sociopathic geniuses but Mycroft had been born with the gift of patience and Sherlock had not. With patience Mycroft had the ability to be diplomatic. He took the time to read people and influence them according to a desired outcome. He refrained from correcting his teachers in order to receive top marks and glowing evaluations. He pretended to like his classmates in order to make connections, always keeping himself in a place of power.
he thought, tracing the circle on the chest in front of him.
“How are we going to question her while pretending we’re only there for sex? I suppose she won’t be interested in an interrogator/witness roleplay.” John chuckled at absurdity of the idea and Sherlock gave him a sideways glance.
Sherlock squinted at him. “Why are you upset? It’s a few bruises; I’ve had worse.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, John, it would be impossible to wire the entire cemetery. It would be too obvious. People would—” John was grinning widely and Sherlock stopped. “That was a joke, wasn’t it.”
There were few situations strong enough to break the lock. For example, if someone were to strap John in Semtex, or put him in a fire. Or if he were to have to say goodbye to John, knowing there was a possibility he would never see him again. In those times the lock snapped open and the Feelings flooded out, drowning every other aspect of his mind palace. It was dangerous; water damage was no trivial matter and it took an annoying amount of effort to dry everything out again and re-bolt the door shut. Feelings were truly a hassle. That door had to stay locked.
He babbled something about a family emergency to whoever was closest as he bolted out the door.
She swayed, moving her hips slowly to the rhythm. John was more than happy to see Scotch again, the disagreements of the morning forgotten entirely.
When Mrs. Bennis answered the door Sherlock went straight to her living room windows, leaving John to deal with the niceties of accepting an offer of tea and thanking her for granting them an interview. She looked to be in her early seventies, primly dressed, with thick prescription glasses which made her eyes look very large.
intolerable if he had to assist another DI. Lestrade would have preferred a card. Because in the following year the conceited amateur seemed to appear at his shoulder to correct him every time he made a mistake.
Sherlock snarled in frustration, “What’s wrong with you? I thought you wanted this!”
“You’re a very nasty hungover person,” Sherlock said, flopping down onto the couch sulkily.
minimum because you can’t be trusted with opioids.” Sherlock threw a glare at him but John ignored it with practiced ease. “And what if your neck had gotten worse today? Real damage could have been done to your throat—”
“John, please—”
John thought about this. “Or it means he’s a person, and people—normal people who don’t have any detail-awareness superpowers—sometimes mistake navy socks for black ones. Especially blokes.” John was thinking about the number of occasions he’d done this himself. He resisted the urge to lift his trouser legs to check if he’d done it today.
,” Sherlock said with an eye roll. “Thigh scars.” He gestured to the pictures he’d finished putting up. “Did you know
you a flatmate. And you can be certain I’ll choose one who won’t allow for your… antics,” Mycroft finished, wrinkling his nose in distaste.
“You loved him,” Mycroft said simply. “This is what happens when you love someone.”
John smelled like warm tea and cold gunmetal: the familiarity of home and the thrill of danger at the same time. The scent of his skin was uniquely John, and Sherlock felt the comfort he dragged from it edged with something sharper, something like electricity. Because while he and John had become closer than words could label over their years together, there had never been anything as simple as easy familiarity between them. As comfortable as they were in each other’s presence, there was always a hint of tension, a faint ripple of static electricity in the air. The volatility of their relationship could have them clutching at each other, gasping in laughter, or lunging at each other’s throats. And Sherlock needed that. It was like a mirror of his work: as familiar as it was unpredictable and as soothing as it was dangerous. John: the embodiment of home and the promise of violence. Everything he needed.
“From what?”
But there was always the flaw. In Sherlock’s kaleidoscopic eyes only the flaw remained constant. In his right iris, just above the pupil, was a single dot of dark brown amid the bright sky colours. Beautiful and flawed. John would say Sherlock's eyes were a perfect reflection of his mind, but that was the sort of writerly romanticism Sherlock so often scoffed at while reading his blog.
Sherlock silently apologised to his flatmate, doctor, soldier. It wasn’t suicide; it was bad timing. He’d been rash about checking the locations. If he’d known the drug deal was happening tonight—
4:40. Perhaps there had never been a reason to believe he'd come.
John hesitated, unsure, almost deciding on the truth, but then Sherlock looked up at him. John fumbled with his words. Sherlock stood and walked around the table, still looking at him like that. He was too close, and then he took a step closer. The smell of that expensive shampoo combined with the unique scent of his skin—something like the cold metal of lab tables and the electricity of adrenaline—it was as heady and overwhelming as it always was whenever Sherlock got too close and John chose the lie.
“Promise you won’t say a word.”
Sherlock laughed. It was one of his real laughs, deep and appreciative. A rewarding sound for those who could get him to do it. John wondered if there was anyone else on that list with him.
Captain Mycroft, however—twelve years old at the time and Shezza’s most formidable enemy—was prepared for this, sometimes engaging in a bit of swordplay (stealing the plastic sword from Redbeard’s collar) if he was feeling indulgent. He was already part of the fencing club at his school and he corrected Sherlock’s posture, teaching him about lunges and parries.
From Semtex to Szechuan in less than an hour. John was fine. Better than fine. He was running with the danger that kept his limp away and his hands steady.
“Well? What does it say?”
John dropped his head. "Bugger." He looked back up and met Sherlock's eyes. He straightened his shoulders. "Ok," he said, "tell me where to put my hands." Sherlock felt a grin tug the corner of his mouth. Soldiers fear no waltz positions.
He looked over at John, who was standing at ease, hands clasped behind his back, head down.
Sherlock found himself standing at the side of John’s bed. He didn’t remember getting to his feet or crossing the small hotel room. Automatic actions. No conscious thought required. In his sleep John turned onto his left side, facing him, and Sherlock tensed. He could see the tightness in John’s jaw, his closed eyes squeezing shut harder as if he could prevent himself from seeing what was not visible.
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s the easiest piece of furniture to fit a body into without having to chop it up first.”
However, since it was here… He supposed it wouldn’t hurt to try it on. Above all else he was curious to see what Sherlock would have chosen for him.
“Look at me,” John repeated, steady.
Upon initial inspection the murder appeared to be a mugging. Victim was male, early thirties, dressed in a smart suit. He’d been stabbed in his left side; blood soaked through his shirt and suit jacket, staining the pavement where he lay sprawled on his side. Wallet and phone not found on the body, evidently stolen.
Sherlock held out his hand to catch the raindrops. “Interesting.”
John shut his eyes and for an instant saw the inverted scattering of sunset light on the inside of his eyelids. Sherlock ‘wasn’t aware of the extent to which he would be affected by his absence?’ Hadn’t Sherlock considered how
Sherlock was not really listening. David Rodgers’ autopsy results had come in and he’d spent the morning at the lab analysing the victim’s blood. He’d found poison, as predicted. (Of course Rodgers hadn’t died from the stab wound, it would take Anderson-level blundering not to have seen that.) But what kind of poison? He was England’s unofficial expert on poisons, and this was not something he’d seen before. It was something new.
“Well, I hope you’re comfortable,” John muttered. It was the ride home from Irene Adler’s house all over again. A drugged Sherlock was apparently one who needed his space, and, like a cat, was content to ignore whatever bodies were already occupying said space.
The amygdala of John's brain submitted a motion to panic, but his prefrontal cortex vetoed it. Sherlock was still asleep. His steady breathing, hot and humid against the skin at the base of John's throat, told him that much. But
Mycroft rubbed his hand over his eyes.
“You’re not.”
"But really we are busy." John almost jumped. He had no idea when Sherlock had appeared at his shoulder. "Crimes to solve, you know murderers don't wait for idle chatter." Sherlock stepped between them to pull open the door.
In contrast to the ultramodern club, the upstairs décor seemed an attempt to mimic the style of an old Parisian brothel. Chandeliers lined the hallway ceiling and ornate doorways led off to, what John assumed, were the bedrooms.
Molly Hooper had just crossed the line from concerned to terrified.
They’d been a couple without benefits and John couldn’t believe the sheer idiocy of the concept. But he had to remind himself that he hadn’t known. Not because it wasn’t obvious—it was—and not because people hadn’t told him—they had, repeatedly. He hadn’t known because he hadn’t been ready to know. And he assumed the same was true for Sherlock. The feeling—that electricity—had always been there, but until now they’d moved around each other as though there was a wall between them, unacknowledged but constant. Now it was gone, and there was a sudden, dizzying freedom in being released from what had been an invisible cage.
Molly backed down. She knew what he meant. She felt powerless. She could refuse to help Sherlock unless he threw away the drugs, but she knew that would only mean Sherlock would tell her to go to hell and continue on his own. From what it looked like, John’s life could be at stake. If Sherlock needed to use cocaine to save him, then Molly knew this was the one circumstance in which they’d all have to let it slide.
The clever part, he supposed, was that the chemicals in the poison rendered the body unresponsive to vasoactive drugs: his blood vessels wouldn’t respond to vasopressors (the medications that would constrict his blood vessels and help raise his blood pressure) and his heart wouldn’t respond to inotropes (the medications that would support the strength of his heartrate). Like triggering a bizarre kind of stasis in his vascular system, the poison had made it resistant to interference via any conventional methods.
He thought of requesting regular reports from Mycroft on John’s progress, but then decided against it. He found the thought of reading that John was getting along effortlessly without him turned his stomach equally as the thought of reading that John was miserable. It would be best if he didn’t know. Because in either case he might not be able to stop himself from turning up in London to shake John by the shoulders. And that would ruin the whole experiment.
prepared. But it’s been ages! What’s taking so long?”
“Good to see you, John.” He nodded. John was smiling, clearly in a good mood. Lestrade was glad to see it. He’d seen less of John since the wedding, but each time they met John had seemed… Depressed? No, that wasn’t it. Tired? More like
“What?”
“Are we going after him tonight?”
He straightened his shoulders. Turned a bit. And faced forward again.
John released Sherlock with a shove. “No. Not until you ran out the fucking door. Three days, Sherlock. Three days and I haven’t seen or heard from you. Not one word. Do you have any idea—” John cut off the words. It was obvious Sherlock didn’t have any idea. He didn’t empathise. It wouldn’t occur to him to consider how it would feel if the situation had been reversed. Wherever he’d been these past few days he probably hadn’t given a thought to what John was feeling—the nausea that had gripped him when Sherlock pushed him away. The crushing, suffocating desperation John had felt at Sherlock letting him kiss him like that and then leaving as though he’d changed his mind—as though he’d re-evaluated and decided it wasn’t good enough or wasn’t worth it. As though he wanted nothing more to do with him. Sherlock wouldn’t have considered any of that. He never would.
Usually entirely eloquent, Sherlock had discovered soon after meeting him that for some reason ‘John’ was one of the only topics for which the words seemed to vanish even as he reached for them.
John frowned. “There wasn’t any evidence of vomit or asphyxiation. Judging just from initial appearance I would have guessed circulatory shock, which the stabbing would have explained nicely.”
“Yep,” Sherlock said.
“Reeves is down,” John said to Mycroft, glaring at his soon-to-be ex-flatmate, who adopted an innocent expression. “Your brother lives to irritate us all another day.”
After the shower John redressed the cut and pulled on pyjama bottoms and one of his more comfortable long-sleeved shirts, resolving not to go anywhere for the rest of the evening. It had been a long twenty-four hours beginning with tackling Sherlock in Ireland and ending with shooting an assassin through the head. But standing in the empty living room he suddenly felt uncertain about what to do. He realised he’d been unconsciously looking forward to a night in with his flatmate. Thanks to both Switzerland and Ireland they hadn’t actually spent any time together at Baker Street since he’d left Mary’s house, and he found he was eager to fall back into the old routine he hadn’t yet acknowledged how much he'd missed.
“I put considerable effort into persuading my client to allow you to work with me in Switzerland, but he wouldn’t have it and in the end the case was too interesting to pass up,” Sherlock insisted.
John laughed. “Really.”
It was the second time John had made a conscious decision to live for him, and he would do it again every time.
The method wasn’t ideal, but there was no time. No time for tourniquets and careful venipuncture. Even if he wanted to do it here, the gauge of his hypodermic needles was better suited for injections than extractions, and John would insist on going to the lab to have it done properly and there
“Enough.”
"You are not relaxed. You're squirming."
"Brick?"
to kill you, of course. We have strict orders about that.”
“Oh, great! Thanks,” he said, clearly relieved to get it back. “She said she wouldn’t be able to get it round till Friday.”
If John had been worried Sherlock might Say Something about the incident that afternoon, he needn’t have been. Sherlock had been silent, working on his laptop until the evening and John was grateful for the quiet. He was editing his notes on their current case, wondering how he was going to fictionalise the method Sherlock had used to confirm the way Amy Elliot had received the poison, when Sherlock announced, “We’re going to a cemetery tonight.”
“She doesn’t, but I want an autopsy anyway. Need to know all the variables we’re dealing with.”
The confusion of John’s sudden appearance was compounded by the haze of the drug still hanging heavily over his mind, and Sherlock found he wasn’t quick enough to stop his more irrational drives from taking over. He pulled John closer and dropped his face to his neck as though his body knew John’s scent was what it needed to calm it. It worked immediately. As he breathed he felt the tension in his muscles finally, blessedly unwinding.
Sherlock was sunk in his chair, arms dangling over the armrests, eyes closed, legs stretched out in front of him. John’s footsteps on the stairs brought him up from his dense network of thoughts.
John grinned, and as he slid into the seat next to Sherlock and looked over at his scientist, whose curls were sticking out in disarray from where John had been running his fingers through, he wondered if he’d ever been happier. He was winded and giddy from the kiss—
“Why did they choose him though?” John asked, looking at the picture of Rodgers.
“I can’t work with an incapacitated blogger.”
“You need a metaphorical hat,” Tweedledee advised.
John was awfully fond of mad detectives who showed up at his door in tuxes offering him the choice between chips or cake). But he felt tied to the door by his responsibilities and it made him resent them doubly.
John huffs out a relieved chuckle. The tension flows from his shoulders, body slumping forward into Sherlock, who instinctively wraps his arms around him.
You don’t care for her all that much, do you?
Could you hurry up with those onions? They don’t need to be exact, just chop them into pieces.
Let go of me.
His back collides with an unanticipated obstacle and he breaks off mid word, . Before he can lose his footing, long slim fingers grasp onto his waist to steady him. John instantly freezes.
Sherlock is still a bit dazed and it shows in his voice, which causes John to giggle-snort into his skin. His face is buried in the crook of Sherlock’s neck and he lingers a second longer before he pulls back to beam up at him.
They stare at each other, neither of them sure how to proceed. Unexpectedly, Sherlock is the first one to move. He inches closer, emboldened by the reassurance, and lets go of John’s hand to raise his arms towards him. John is holding his breath, body motionless, while two hands curl around his shoulders as Sherlock envelopes him in a tentative embrace.
Yeah. I told her to text me when she got home. She just got in. Said she is going to stay at a friend’s place for the day to rest up.
Thank you.
He breaks off, surprised by how raspy his own voice sounds. A small crinkle appears between his brows as he clears his throat.
In three long strides he is across the room and crowding in next to him to take a closer look at the cut. John startles a little when careful fingers push back a few wisps of his hair that have gotten caught in the slowly drying blood, but holds still nonetheless.
Everything seems to slow down and the noises from the cooker and the street outside fade to a low mumble.
Sherlock is refusing to meet his searching gaze. The muscles in his arm have tensed up, yet he doesn’t put up any real resistance against John’s grip, just stands there, stuck.
Who, Sarah? Whatever gave you that impression?
Dead Man.
He closes his eyes and licks his lips, struggling to put his thoughts into words. The fingers holding him in place loosen even further and slide down his arm to grasp his hand. His throat bobs while he hesitates, then he unclenches his fist and allows their fingers to intertwine.
After a few seconds John dares to reciprocate. Making sure to telegraph his every move, he wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist. He is met with no resistance, so he gradually brings them closer together, until there is no space left between them. Sherlock tenses up slightly, but when John’s warmth begins to seep into him, he lets out a long breath and settles further into the hug.
What?
Please. With all your pestering, you had her thinking you were jealous.
John’s forehead is crinkled up, eyes and lips pressed shut tightly. He seems to be fighting with himself, trying to resist, terrified he is reading this wrong yet again. Then, almost against his will, he begins to shift. Inch by painful inch, his head turns until his nose touches Sherlock’s. They seem to be frozen in time, breathing each other’s air, bodies tingling in anticipation and fear, neither of them daring to move.
I did nothing of the sort.
Sarah?
There is a slight tremble to his whispered words and his worst fears seem to come to pass when the room remains ominously silent. He lifts his head in trepidation and glances up at Sherlock, who is staring right through him with an unreadable expression.
John huffs out a staggered breath, face open with hopefulness and fearful disbelieve. He mirrors Sherlock’s earlier gesture by softly tugging on his hand, only this time it’s not to create distance between them, but to pull him closer.
He breaks off with an annoyed grunt. John huffs out a laugh and presses a tiny peck to his shoulder.
Cautions Sherlock’s voice from right behind him, every syllable a tendril of warm air against the shell of John’s ear. As the tiny hairs on the side of his face stand up, his skin there begins to tingle. At first, just a little. He clears his throat in an attempt to mask his reaction, but when Sherlock doesn’t move away, the sensation starts to spread out. It crawls down his neck, turning into a warm shiver and races along his spine, all the way down to his toes. The fingers just below the side of his ribcage falter, but resume their previous position after a second of hesitation.
One word. One tiny word was all it took to shatter his resolve. His eyes are roaming over Sherlock’s now closed off face, trying to pierce through his mask.
Dinner?
John has Sherlock chopping onions and mushrooms, which he is doing with the same level of diligence he applies to everything he does. His slow progress is being watched with a raised eyebrow, as John alternates between stirring the rice and frying the ham.
A small chuckle escapes from John, who holds up his hands in a placating manner before they lapse back into silence. Sherlock doesn’t have to search long to find the package of disinfectant wipes. After cleaning his hands with them, he pulls out a fresh one and steps in front of John. Then he hesitates.
It’s John who breaks first. Between one thundering heartbeat and the next, he closes the distance between them, lip’s finding Sherlock’s, warm and pliant. It’s a chaste kiss, barely more than a drawn out peck. Quiet, with both of them not daring to breathe.
What?
First we need to get this cleaned. Where is your medical kit?
Eventually Sherlock starts to come back to himself. He sucks in a gulp of air, lashes fluttering with every blink until his unfocused gaze clears.
He sighs and drags a hand over his face. When his fingers graze the wound on his forehead he flinches back. He lowers his hand and regards the red stains of blood on his fingers in surprise, as if he had forgotten all about it.
John’s words were infused with good-natured bafflement, but Sherlock freezes nonetheless. His grip goes slack and the bandage slips from his fingers. It is saved from falling to the ground by John’s quick reflexes, who is visibly surprised by the sudden fumble. Before he has time to speak up, though, Sherlock has already snatched it up again and is securing it over the last exposed bit of the cut.
In one last display of defiance, Sherlock gives a half-hearted tug and John, true to his word, doesn’t let go, just softens his hold. He has gotten up from his chair by now, standing there with nowhere to go like a man at the end of his rope.
Careful not to move his head, John fishes it out of his pocket and holds it up to read the new text message. He sighs and types out a quick reply. Sherlock remains quiet during this short exchange, fingers playing with the piece of cotton in his hand, while he waits patiently until John puts the device away.
Sherlock’s throat seems to be clenching up in trepidation, because his voice is gravely and clipped when he answers.
There is a new warmth and fondness in John’s voice, which I’ve never heard him use before. Sherlock blinks at him in surprise, nods and can’t seem to look away.
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe the way you’ve been either ignoring or needling her all evening long?
Careful.
Sherlock is caught off guard and stumbles forward, hand landing on John’s shoulder to keep his balance. He pulls it back, as if burned, apology ready on his lips.
I said let go of me.
It’s moments like these when I can’t help but be reminded how much they actually enjoy being in each other’s company. No case work or chasing bad guys, only calm conversation and quiet everyday life. Spending time together with no ulterior motive. Domestic, open and happy. That’s how they look.
I don’t like seeing her with you.
John is blinking up at him, brow furrowed in question as he waits for an explanation. He is all patched up now, so Sherlock should step back out of his personal space and let go of his forehead, but his hands and legs seem to be refusing to cooperate. Instead, he lingers a beat longer, fingers gliding one more time over the edges of the bandages, as if to make sure they will hold in place. A regretful frown ghosts over his face.
His tongue darts out to lick his lips and he averts his wide eyes to the floor.
It took a playful kick to the leg to get him to move his lazy bum and to help prepare dinner. Judging by the delicious smell and the ingredients, I’d say they are making risotto, which is a favourite of both of them.
He twirls one finger in a circle, indicating for him to turn around in his seat, so he doesn’t have to lean over him to be able to reach the wound.
Sherlock grumbles as he slides the bandage into place. He waggles his fingers at John for one more strip, but refuses to meet his miffed expression. John huffs out an exasperated breath and shoves the plaster into Sherlock’s hand.
How are we doing on those mushr...
Oh, yes, sorry.
Sherlock seems to snap back to the present at that. He focuses on John’s injury with an unreadable expression on his face, lips pressed into a thin line.
Is this okay?
I’m not used to being on this side of things.
London is starting to wake up and the sky is just between night and day when John and Sherlock finally, FINALLY return home. It’s a good thing I am no longer able to bite my nails, because they would have been bitten down to the quick by now. The past hours of waiting have been torture, so seeing them both back here in one piece gives me more joy than I can put into words.
That’s what it says. Dead Man.
...good.
And I said no. Not, unless you answer my question.
It’s said in a teasing tone, causing Sherlock’s lips to twitch at the corners, aware of the irony of the situation.
That was g...
You know what you are doing?
The rise and fall of their chests has synced up, quick and shallow. Every time Sherlock sucks in air, the short wisps of blond hair before him tickle across his lips. Every time he breathes out, they glide back over John’s cheek, making him shiver yet again.
The look John throws him says he is about done as well, so Sherlock relents. He does, however, turn up his nose at the resulting decrease in precision of his handiwork. He is about to complain, when suddenly there is a warm body leaning into his side, one hand braced on his shoulder,. Sherlock remains still, while an arm reaches across his front and snatches the chopping board from his grasp.
I might not be a doctor, John, but I am well-versed in first aid. So yes. I know what I am doing.
With one hand still holding up John’s hair, Sherlock discards the now dirty wipe and pulls out a fresh one. He is about to resume his task, when John’s phone beeps.
They look exhausted and John has got a cut on his forehead, but apart from that they appear to be fine. I hope Sarah is okay, as well. She isn’t with them, not that I can blame her. After facing off against Chinese assassins and being abducted all in one night, I’d want to go home and rest up, too.
I take full responsibility.
Starving.
Sherlock leans in closer to get a better look. Wordlessly, he reaches out with one hand and delicately starts to dab away the crusted blood, while he uses his other hand to keep John’s hair from falling back down over the cut. As soon as he notices the discomfort on John’s scrunched up face, his previously sure fingers falter.
John has yet to move or say anything. The only sound coming from him is his breathing, which is getting faster and more laboured with each second of contact between them. Sherlock seems to be drawn to it like a magnet, because he keeps inching closer until his forehead comes to rest against John’s temple. A tentative hand finds it’s way into his dark curls and his eyes fall shut, lost in the moment.
Like I said, baby steps.
It can wait.
Comes the mumbled reply, quickly followed by another self-deprecating chuckle.
With his eyes still closed, he rest’s his forehead against Sherlock’s, unable to draw back any further than that.
The last word is no louder than the drop of a pin and probably wasn’t even meant to be said out loud, but with Sherlock standing so close, John hears it anyway. Then the deeper meaning of the unexpected compliment begins to sink in. His eyes grow wide, mouth falling open with no sound coming out.
Hey, it’s fine. It’s all fine, okay?
His voice is nonchalant as he secures the first plaster over the damaged skin and takes the second one John is already holding out for him.
