“Me too. I’ve texted him regarding a bunch of cases I need help with, but he doesn’t reply. What’s with him?” Lestrade questioned.
The detective pulled John from the armchair. “Well, today’s the day that you can prove to all those idiots that you are indeed a great doctor. Come on!!” Sherlock dashed down the stairs, while John followed behind him.
The blond groaned as he ran to get his coat and followed the detective down the stairs. Sherlock was running down the street, heading towards the meeting place that was given through the message.
Sherlock was in deep thought that he barely missed Mrs Hudson coming back and leaving the basket of clean clothes on an armchair. The detective shook his head and picked himself up, he walked towards the kitchen and decided to continue his experiments.
Dimmock agreed. “She’ll be under our protection until the killer is caught.” The D.I. extended his arm, offering Soo Lin to enter his office.
Jeff shook his head, to speed the process, John stepped on the man’s chest. The dying man gasped in pain.
Mrs. Hudson brightened up, “Oh honey. You’re mute, aren’t you? That’s alright, a young man upstairs, Sherlock, has a ton of books concerning sign language and every once in a while, I sneak in and study a bit. I know a bit of sign language, so what do you need dearie?”
Sherlock composed himself and stood up straighter and left. He accompanied a distressed Lestrade outside and stayed quiet.
The worker began to walk away. “Well, I’ll leave you to it, then. Just give us a sign when you’re off.”
Anderson faced John. “Who’s this? Is he your boyfriend?” The blond shook his head. Anderson took the opportunity to check out the smaller man. “He’s tasty. I’m surprised you were able to catch him without scaring him off first.”
Sherlock smiled, “No — I think he’s brilliant enough. I love brilliant ones. They’re always so desperate to get caught.”
A person who was born to thrive next to Sherlock’s throne and convert Sherlock into a depraved demon that constantly fantasized the act of copulating with another person. Someone who was willing to defy Sherlock’s brutality and make the boy bleed with such ease. This was the main interchange that made Sherlock believe that love was a barbaric display of destructiveness, greed, possessiveness, and cruelty.
“Exactly! They weren’t there. I made a fuss. I tried to get the police interested but nobody seemed to think it was important. He’d left all the rest of his clothes in his locker. But there was no sign of his shoes.”
Sherlock and John went up the stairs to the second floor, pushing aside piles of junk that cluttered the path up the stairs.
“Yes, I actually I have an Aston Martin parked in the back. Why do you need a car?” The older lady wondered.
Everyone fled to their dormitories, Sally was the only one who helped Anderson to his feet and removed him from Sherlock’s sight. Sherlock watched until everyone disappeared into the night. When he was satisfied to learn that he was completely alone, Sherlock pulled down the zipper of his trousers and pressed the palm of his hand against his cock.
Jim snorted while dragging his thumb across his lip. “But those are lies. Putting away our kind is not to help us realize that we can become better. Oh no no no. It’s because society is afraid of us… they fear us. If you let a headless chicken terrorize the world you get destruction, fear, instability but most beautifully, we get chaos. Democracy is afraid to let us rule this world and infest it with our insanity, that’s why we are kept locked up.”
The detective became annoyed at the lack of attention. “Dammit! John! I’m bored! My brain is rotting! Do something about it!”
John was by far, the only Omega who managed to survive the long process of becoming a field agent. It wasn’t easy, for John had to endure cat calls and encounters with way too many Alphas who wanted to take advantage of him. But to his pleasure, no Alpha has dared to go beyond the point of raping John, for John beat the shit out of the toughest Alphas and made them pay for not respecting him and thinking that he was a dim-witted Omega who craved their knot.
Sherlock was praising himself and calculated that in about forty seconds, John Watson was about to crumble. “Need I go on?”
Since year 12 had a lot of students; the director of the school decided to spilt the students into seven major groups. Each group was designated to attend seven different camp sites which meant that 26-27 students would be spending their summer together. The group heading towards Camp Redwood included a variety of students.
Every single student at Kent College were either jealous or terrified of Sherlock’s group. Such nocuous effects brought upon a single emotion that everyone shared when they saw Sherlock Holmes and that was fear. Sherlock never expected to become the person he was today because when he was younger, he grew up in a loving atmosphere that consisted of his father, mother, and older brother.
Then he could feel the growth of his pupils, it seemed inevitable for he couldn’t prevent this action. The desire to wrap John in his arms was itching at the tips of his fingers. And he could feel his eyes dropping down to look at John’s lips… they looked so balmy and supple. How odd.
John entered the kitchen and spotted the disaster of experiments on the table; he ignored the impulse to throw a cup of tea to Sherlock’s face and demand the detective to clean up his messy shit. But John pushed down that urge and went towards the fridge, he was unbelievably hungry and happily opened the fridge.
The lights outside in the hallway were on, illuminating the room where Soo Lin was. Soo Lin’s brother, Liang, took out a gun and pointed it towards Soo Lin when the blond shot the lights outside. The distraction caught Liang off guard, Soo Lin took the opportunity to run towards the tunnel across the room.
Sherlock smoothly retrieved the gun tucked behind his lower back and pointed it at Moriarty. “Both.”
Of course, an idiot would know that the numbers concerning the sexes will always be in a state of overflow. Meaning that half of the population in school were girls and even the existence of the most beautiful female prodigy could never manage to turn Sherlock’s head. The other half of the sexes were boys and not even a specimen that was mischievously attractive could make Sherlock stop in full daylight.
Greg, John, and Sherlock were walking on the shoreline of the Thames, approaching the next case on their list. Lestrade led the way, bringing everyone towards the dead body that washed up on shore and waited for Sherlock to begin with his deductions.
Fuck, the Alpha couldn’t hold back his urge any longer. John needed to have this boy, right this very second before losing his shit and attacking everyone at the party who dared touch
The war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye. Jim Moriarty —an Omega— was the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the werewolf clan, after centuries, he’d finally been killed. The werewolf horde scattered to the wind in a single evening of flame and retribution. Victory, it seemed, was in the grasps of the ones known as bloodsuckers, the very birth right of the vampires.
Sherlock and the blond ran back to the spot where the graffiti was but this time, the wall was completely black.
No matter, John was here to finish this case, which he’s been working on for about seven months. If his life was on the line, then he would risk it to kill the remaining werewolves representing Moriarty’s lineage and to uncover the truth as to why his blood was heavily desired by the werewolf clan. But, unaware to the corporation John worked for, the Omega was slightly disregarding the orders given to him.
Back in the safety of their flat, Sherlock was deciphering the code with the book that Soo Lin advised them to use. John was upstairs taking a nap, not really noticing that the day shifted into the night.
Sherlock feebly placed his scanty body against the nightstand and tried to make himself small. “Please leave.”
Though werewolves were fewer in number, the war itself had become perilous. For the moon no longer held her sway over werewolves. Older, more powerful werewolves were now able to change at will. The weapons had evolved, but their orders remained the same: hunt them down and kill them off, one by one, every werewolf that dared to live in London.
The detective eyed the smiley face on the wall and smiled adorably, mimicking the spray-painted face when an explosion went off.
The Alpha snorted when he realized that Greg had zero cases that were worth his time and rolled his eyes when he read a few messages from Mycroft wondering if he was okay since Sherlock hadn’t left his flat in nine days. Sherlock tossed his phone aside and growled in irritation when he noticed that he ran out of heroin.
Sherlock lazily drifted his gaze to the sea of people entering the tube station when he came across cobalt blue eyes and sandy blond har, wait. Sherlock reverted his vision back to the familiar set of eyes and…
Sherlock shrugged him off. “No. You need Lestrade in your car in order to enjoy a quick shaggging. I don’t want to talk. I’m in shock. Right John.”
Sherlock looked again when he saw the shadow of the man running away. John and Sherlock began to run after him, trying to catch up to the man but Golem entered a car and drove away.
Sherlock and Greg remained quiet, staring daggers at each other while Sherlock muttered insults beneath his breath.
A slow and painful death yet wonderful when used on the enemy. Before Sherlock emerged from behind the pillar; the Alpha sniffed the air and flared his nostrils, he recognized the scent of another vampire nearby. With another sniff, Sherlock rolled his eyes and faced the entrance to the train station and saw Sally Donovan reaching for her gun.
The young man, Andy, shrugged his shoulders. “Three days ago. Here at the museum. This morning they told me she’d resigned. Just like that. Left her work unfinished.”
The scent was heavily musky, the boy could smell the different types of dirt mixed together to become a tar like mud that would stick to one’s skin and made it impossible to remove it, with simply one wash. Sherlock felt his entire body trembling, his vulnerable and delicate flesh was quivering with the anticipation of being manhandled.
The Omega turned to face the Alpha with curiosity and confusion in his eyes. “How did you know I was a doctor? How did you even know I was a captain?”
After years of standing his ground, John was considered the most valuable agent in London and he was privy to being given the biggest criminal cases in the city. So here he was, working the case of eliminating Jim Moriarty’s undying clan. But John was not stupid, he knew from the beginning that he was chosen as a field agent for a specific reason.
Mycroft and Sherlock stared at John in complete shock. Two distinct faces were creeping into their features. Mycroft was alarmed; his eyes widened in disbelief, not wanting to believe that his Gregory slept with John. Sherlock on the other hand, looked defeated and utterly depressed, the detective couldn’t believe that fucking George beat him to getting John.
Betas received the same laws as Omegas and Alphas were proud to dominate their entitlement in society by controlling Omegas and Betas. Betas were subdued to survive the harassments of Alphas, they were treated with physical, verbal, and mental abuse. As predicted, Betas formed marches in the streets and joined the Omegas to regain their appurtenance in society.
John took the unoccupied seat and watched the clock spinning on the website until it displayed a map, showing where the phone is located. “
Greg snorted. “Aha, keep telling yourself that. Just know that one day, John may find someone and your chance of actually being with him will be gone.”
The detective entered the car and couldn’t help but gawk at the interior of the vehicle. “It’s very nice.”
The detective didn’t finish his last words for a chair was flying his direction. Sherlock ducked in time, sparing himself from meeting of the cold touch of the wooden chair. Then John grabbed another chair and threw it to Sherlock, this time the detective couldn’t duck in time and the chair bonked the side of his head. Sherlock was disoriented for a bit but he remained harmless, “Wait. Wait. Please, I’m not here to cause any trouble.”
John was speed walking home, he seriously regretted coming here and irritating the man, of course, how wouldn’t he be angry if he nearly broke Sherlock’s nose. He checked the street before crossing but he missed the tall form running as fast a cheetah past him and placing himself in front of John. John instantaneously ran into the man’s broad chest and fell back, meeting the ground. He hit the concrete floor and sneezed, which made his throat burn like lava as his back began to feel pain.
“Hiya buddy.” Sebastian faced John. “Who’s this? Your boyfriend? No wait, husband. He’s cute. To be truthful, I didn’t think you were the type to settle down.”
“Colleague of mine, Doctor Watson.” He faced John. “Doctor Watson, this is Sergeant Sally Donovan. A
The adrenaline of getting rid of the government was easily dissipated, now with no one to establish rules over the people in London, there was only one question being asked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and studied the bar and tried it, he was surprised that the bar was… delicious. “It’s really good.”
Sherlock was thrown back against the seat of the coach when the prince heard something being broken down. The coachman tried to steer the horses away from an upcoming bridge that had a sturdy railing— built for humans to hold onto while taking a stroll— but the force and strength of four horses were enough to knock the railing down.
. Sherlock held the cigarette in between his fingers and walked to the next pillar, leaning against it and displaying himself to everyone. John was walking down the platform when a tall and handsome pale man dressed in black was taking a drag and looking extremely bored.
John looked up to stare at Sherlock, a sad gaze formed all over John’s features. John realized how much more Sherlock could be but the detective was a fucking cock who only cared about himself and his reputation as the only consulting detective in London.
Sherlock began to walk back towards Mycroft when he caught the scent of the Alpha that would haunt his dreams. The Omega boy stopped in full force and inhaled deeply; his mouth was watering as he drank down the man’s scent. The boy faced the direction of the man and let out a shaky moan, the powerful aromas of this Alpha was leaving Sherlock with an erection.
John didn’t answer as he went down the stairs, quickly running into Mrs Hudson and reaching the door. He slammed the door shut and walked away from 221B.
Sherlock tried to locate the tall man but the fucking images of the projector kept flashing against his eyes. “Who do you work for, Dzunda?”
Sherlock faced John. “John, if we’re going to decipher the code, we’re gonna need to look for more evidence.”
“The time was right, but the date was wrong. Said two days ago. Crossed the date line twice and he didn’t alter it.”
“Ah, I see.” Sebastian winked at Sherlock. “Not the type to deal with labels. I respect that. Now, please let the happy couple sit down.”
Hello lovely readers, here’s the next chapter. I just wanted to remind everyone that John is mute, so his dialogue will be
But there was one person who made Sherlock believe that ruling the world into darkness was meant to be shared by two people instead of one. A person who was clearly meant to be by Sherlock’s side, a person who was on the borderline of violence and turmoil. Someone who challenged Sherlock’s views and made Sherlock question himself.
The D.I. shook his head. “It’s addressed to you, isn’t it? We’ve x-rayed it. Its not booby trapped.”
The boy began to tremble, his lanky body was shivering so badly that he couldn’t bring himself to stand on his two feet. Sherlock cursed at himself for being weak and meager, he needed to find a way out of this situation and if he didn’t, things could get ugly. The Omega boy felt his teeth chattering and the commencements of salty tears were on the brink of spilling down his face.
Jim titled his head and roughly pushed Sherlock back, adjusting his coat with his hands. “Are you really willing to do anything to save him?”
“So, the killer goes to the bank, leaves a threatening cipher at the bank. Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in. Hours later, he dies.”
“What the hell is happening? Are you the one bugging John?” The owner of Speedy’s appeared and pointed at Sherlock.
John rolled his eyes and walked into the rain. Sherlock blocked him, “Please, you can stay in my flat for tonight. Your flat is blocks away and you’ll be completely soaked. I don’t mind if you stay here.” He pointed at the building next to Speedy’s.
Sherlock gathered John’s tired body in his arms and used the parka to place pressure on John’s wounds. “Alright? Are you alright?”
With that, Liz entered her home while John thought over the case and the information he managed to obtain. John unhurriedly crossed the street and hailed a cab, going straight to 221B.
John was smartly dressed as he went to Mycroft’s office, wishing he could have knocked out Sherlock’s teeth when Sherlock basically forced John to work on the missile case for Mycroft. John knocked on Mycroft’s door and stepped inside.
“Yes, but I would like Doctor Watson’s input as well.” Sherlock faced John. “John.” He pointed to the body and urged the blond to approach the dead woman.
Lestrade resisted the urge to slap Sherlock, instead he faced John. “So, John, are you a doctor or something?”
.” Sherlock ran towards the bed, despising the numb sensation crawling all over his body at seeing John like this… vulnerable, defenseless,
“Actually, I’m not the only one enjoying this.” Lestrade pointed to the window. “Look outside the window.”
But the horses were running blindly, the road beneath their hooves was becoming incredibly slippery. One of the four horses pulling the coach slipped against the poorly designed surface of the bridge and like a domino set waiting to be collapsed, everything fell down. The first horse that fell cruelly knocked itself against the railing, the weight of the horse falling was enough to send the other three horses falling as well.
John wanted to punch Sherlock across the face for being a fucking asshole but the computer began to beep in victory, stopping John from losing his temper and battering Sherlock’s face with bruises and blood.
The detective remained passive, not daring to show any emotion or weakness. “No and even if I did, why would you care?”
A feeling Sherlock never understood for he never cared for weddings until now, even now, his own wedding would not be a wonderful memory. Sherlock gazed up at the grey and dark sky when he noticed Mycroft standing at the doorway to their kingdom. Mycroft bid him farewell and, in a few seconds, the coach began to move.
John snuggly wrapped his legs around Sherlock’s neck, purposely tightening the hold of his thighs against the vampire’s face and with a flirtatious shove, the Omega forced his cock into the Alpha’s face. Sherlock made an
Shan grinned evilly. “Oh, but you forget Mr Holmes. He means a lot to you, so killing him.” She pointed the gun to John. “Would make a difference.”
The coach began to rock violently when the horses kept getting scared, it wasn’t long before the trail they took to get to the cathedral was about to be blocked. A flash of lightning crawled down from the sky and made contact with an old oak tree that was covered in dead bark. The irradiation of electricity sparked an enormous fire, the patches of bark were instantly consumed by the flames.
Shan loaded the gun with real bullets. “It tells you they’re not really trying. Now, this time, there are no blank bullets.”
John placed his tea on the small table next to him and stood up, he walked towards Sherlock’s violin and picked it up. He didn’t really know how to play an instrument besides the clarinet. John eyed the beautiful violin when his thoughts went back to the detective deducing Eric and John had the strangest idea that perhaps the reason why Sherlock did what he did was because the detective was… jealous.
Mycroft leaned against his desk, “27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross. MI6. He was involved in the Bruce Partington Program in a minor capacity. Security checks A-OK. No known terrorist affiliations or sympathies. Last seen by his fiancée, 10:30 yesterday evening.”
John was drinking a cup of tea when he heard the door downstairs being slammed shut. Sherlock stomped his way up to the flat, facing the blond with an irritated expression.
The blond thought about the question and realized that he felt happy when he was with Sherlock, and perhaps, he needed a change in his life. “
“What do we do? There’s a killer on the loose and we have no way out. What does this killer want from us?”
Moriarty smirked and walked away, purposely taking slow and steady steps. “You haven’t figured it out yet, have you?”
Greg started to clap his hands. “Well done, Sherlock. Your heart was in the right place but your head wasn’t.”
Lestrade wanted to say something when he felt familiar arms wrapping around his waist and a warm kiss being delivered to the nape of his neck. The D.I. smiled, “Hello My.”
As naïve as Sherlock could be; he did not understand the significance of what a kiss could be, for no one ever presented themselves to Sherlock and admitted some sort of attraction towards him. But he was not stupid enough to comprehend that sharing a kiss was the signature of a contract that stated one’s weakness to be valid.
Greg grabbed Sherlock’s arm. “I’m serious, Sherlock. Listen, I’m cutting you slack here, I’m trusting you, but out there somewhere, some poor bastard is covered in Semtex and he’s waiting for you to solve the puzzle, so just tell me — what are we dealing with?”
If Sherlock successfully eliminated the blood ties correlating to John; then he would have created a situation where John was completely alone and the only person John would have, is Sherlock. There would be no escape from Sherlock, everything revolving around John’s surroundings will only consistent of Sherlock’s presence.
The detective smiled back, “Well, I guess that means, I must be alert at all times.” Sherlock lead the way. “Shall we?”
.” The detective was speaking to Lestrade, telling him to bring cars, helicopters in order to capture the murderer. “
Life at 221B Baker Street was moving along just fine. Sherlock enthusiastically delved into cases provided by Lestrade, happily arriving at the crime scene with his trusted right hand, John Watson. After cases and cases, the blond became confident around the detective and John began to offer his opinions freely whenever it related to a case.
Sherlock was surprised by John’s skills but god, did he see great things for him and his doctor, a whole new life waiting for them, and the detective was absolutely ready for this new change.
The D.I. faced the shorter man. “He’s a good man. I think he’ll be good for Sherlock.” Lestrade stood in front of Mycroft and pulled the taller man closer to him. “Give him a chance. You might grow to like him. I know I do.”
After pacing for about four minutes, Sherlock heard someone knocking on the door and rolled his eyes, he opened the door and saw a tall man with a box in his hands. The Omega boy mentally reminded himself to not snort when he deduced that the man before him was an Alpha with a high addiction of pornography and has been sexually deprived for about two weeks.
“I don’t even smoke.” Sherlock lifted his sleeve to show a nicotine patch on his lower arm to Lestrade.
“Visible above the waistline. Very visible. Very particular brand. Plus, the suggestive fact that he gave John his number. I’d say you’d better break it off now and save yourself the pain.”
John faced Sherlock; keeping a firm gaze on the man and standing his ground, not wanting to fall for Sherlock’s cruel games. Sherlock stared back with the same intensity, wanting John to deduce for him and reveal those secret talents that John constantly hid away. They both stared into each other’s eyes; cobalt blue irises sunk into Sherlock’s lagoon orbs; a lovely combination of a sapphire rock surrounded by aquamarine waves.
John gave a heartwarming smile that made Sherlock’s heart palpitate faster than his normal heart rate.
John sat in his armchair; an Oscar Wilde novel nestled in between his hands. Sherlock, on the other hand, was across from John, lying down on the couch with his body fully spread apart. The detective’s hands were steepled underneath his chin as his eyes remained closed.
To ease the awkward silence he created, Sherlock smiled down at John. “Yes. I kept referring to her husband in the past tense. She joined in. Bit premature. They’ve only just found the car.”
John felt ashamed when those words left Molly’s mouth; John made eye contact with Jim and felt repulsed, knowing that the man would cheat on Molly with another bloke.
The detective began to take down the pictures from the mantle. “We can’t crack this without Soo Lin Yao.”
Sherlock smirked when he figured out that the young maid had no idea that the guard was already married with six children. Quite the surprise she’ll have when she figures out that the guard was with her for sex, nothing more. Sherlock looked back at the couple who was standing before him and greeted King and Queen Watson.
John became infuriated at the notion of using his gun against the Alpha, was pointless. John came to stand ten feet away from the Alpha when the Omega snarled in aggravation and chucked his gun to the side. If he couldn’t kill the vampire with his gun, then he’ll have to improvise with his hands. Sherlock didn’t run out of ammo but when John flung his weapon to the side; the Alpha was certain that John remembered who he was and based on his calculations, they’ll kiss and makeup in a train station (of all places).
The Alpha felt his monstrous cock becoming erect when the aroma of rose water flooded through his nostrils and made him incredibly hungry. And to torture him even further, he detected raspberries being mixed in with delicate specks of tulip petals which were drowned in white wine. This was too much for John, an innocent gift like this needed to be
Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked around the empty café. Lestrade decided to go with the BLT sandwich and approached the counter. He noticed a smaller man who perceived Lestrade’s presence and politely signaled Lestrade that he’ll be right up. Lestrade smiled and patiently waited to be served. “Sherlock.”
Sherlock presented the most lovey dovey smile he could while John mimicked Sherlock’s happiness. It took every ounce of fiber inside John to not face Sherlock and knock some sense into the man’s mind.
Could they not see the symbolic courtship of their union? Was the exchange of their blood too gruesome for others’ eyes when in reality, it was only meant to be viewed by John and Sherlock?
The woman hurriedly searched into her bag and took out a small bottle of makeup that resembled Sherlock’s skin and smiled. “I work at the morgue and sometimes even dead people need a bit of highlight.”
The detective gave Raz his phone, asking the kid if knew about the paint used at the bank. Raz recognized the paint but had no idea what the symbols meant. Sherlock kept exchanging information with Raz, both not noticing John slipping away. John looked down at his watch and noticed that two minutes have passed and John wasn’t keen on being caught by an officer.
“Wrong, its one possible explanation of some of the facts. You’ve got a solution that you like, but you are choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn’t comply with it.” The detective said.
John remained in his spot, making sure that Soo Lin was safe before he took another shot, injuring the man in the leg. John was about to run after the man but the safety of Soo Lin was more important, so he remained by her side until Sherlock came back. They both managed to get Soo Lin out of the museum, taking her to Scotland Yard.
John disappeared up the stairs, heading towards his room and closing the door behind him. The detective watched John walk away as the details of the situation came rushing to his mind. John wanted to kiss him; John actually wanted to kiss him which was a baffling fact. Yet, Sherlock pulled away.
“There are clear signs. I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago and that’s what they spread on the seat.”
The coachman screamed for his life when the horses began to fall, under the bridge there was a rapid river that was growing inch by inch due to the heavy rain. Once the horses fell down towards the river, the coachman followed next. Sherlock managed to see the railing being broken down and like an animal reverting back to its nature of fight or flight reaction, Sherlock went towards the door and opened it.
Sherlock suspiciously eyed John for a moment before returning his attention to the window. Then he replayed the conversation in his head again and he faced John, in pure shock. He came closer to John and spoke awkwardly, “John, um… I think you should know that I consider myself married to my work, and while I’m flattered by your interest, I’m really not looking for any…”
The Omega boy barely heard the words being said to him and absently nodded in his brother’s direction, barely catching a joke that his brother made about him. The boy nonchalantly took a few steps away from Mycroft to get a better look at the stranger and Sherlock whimpered like an affectionate puppy seeking attention.
Sherlock pulled out a small ball of paper from his pocket. “I found this inside his trouser pockets. Sodden by the river, but still recognizable.”
Sherlock sat at the table in the living room, reading an email from a laptop when he heard the door downstairs opening and closing. The detective quickly glanced up at John.
Sherlock was about to get up and play his violin when he heard the downstairs door open and the sound of footsteps rushing upstairs.
John pushed the man back, knocking the man into the wall and breaking the grip around his mouth. John elbowed the man in the ribs as he turned around, grabbing the man’s arm and twisting it behind his back. The man groaned in pain and threw his head back, head butting John in the face. They both fell onto the bed.
Jim nicely slipped away from Molly’s hold and went towards John again, checking out the fine man before him while going around and standing by Sherlock’s side. Sherlock noticed the indecent looks Jim was giving John and snarled lowly in his throat. John couldn’t help feeling like he was the center of attention, who knew that men found him so attractive.
Soo Lin looked at the photographs. “This is a code that every smuggler knows. Its based upon a book…”
He disappeared upstairs into his flat and he removed his coat. He looked at his hands and walked towards his window and replayed the whole forced conversation he had with John. Sherlock placed his hands behind his back and wondered why he felt a heavy guilt rising in his chest. Usually in these situations, he would apologize swiftly and forget about the incident, but this was different.
Sherlock lost his balance when Mycroft immediately grabbed him and pulled him upright. “Sherlock, get yourself together.”
Sherlock was not satisfied with that answer, so, he grabbed John’s shoulders and lightly shook him. “Are you sure you’re alright?”
Sherlock placed both hands under his chin and looked at John. “Will caring about them help save them?”
John. He was actually here in the flesh and bone. Sherlock felt his knees becoming weak. How was the vampire capable of abandoning his dying mate all those centuries ago? How the fuck did he have the courage to leave John when he wasn’t dead? Nothing made sense. But nevertheless, Sherlock knew one thing and that was how his happiness had finally been restored.
John followed the detective out when Sherlock lifted John’s chin, observing the John’s neck. “Are you sure you’re alright?”
Greg seemed bewildered at Sherlock’s lack of knowledge. “You haven’t seen the Hobbit? How? They are epic films.”
It was night already and the blond was calmly reading a book in his bed when he heard the door downstairs being slammed shut.
“Well, it was a tragic accident. Or so, everyone thought. I was only a kid myself. I read about it in the papers.”
Sherlock completely forgot about John’s blood on his fingers and shuttered lustfully at seeing the most beautiful image before him. John’s blood, his little scorpions’ vital element was being smeared all over Sherlock’s cock and imprinting itself into Sherlock’s skin. The mere thought of taking away John’s virginity was too much to bear, the resemblance of the aftermath involving Sherlock penetrating John was such a pretty thought.
Sherlock couldn’t help the brief smile gracing his lips as he watched John jumping in joy. “If you think it was the cat then you’re wrong.”
John and Mycroft visited the bakery together and enjoyed a few cakes while conversing with one another. They chatted comfortably and Mycroft was honestly surprised at actually finding the blond interesting and not tiresome. It surprised John when he emitted a few chuckles from the older man and the friendship between them was slowly building up.
The detective eyed the shoes; kneeling down to study the structure of the shoes before he placed his palms against the floor, replicating the form of a plank as he looked at every detail belonging to the shoes. Sherlock was deep in thought when the pink phone in his coat pocket rang, scaring the shit out of the detective.
“Very. We think West must have taken the memory stick. We can’t possibly risk it falling into the wrong hands.”
“Cause I’d be surprised, Sherlock. Really, I would. And just a teensy bit… disappointed. And of course, you wouldn’t be able to cherish it for very long. Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.”
John hovered his lips over the boy’s bruised ones, a natural smile spreading across the Alpha’s lips like when predator watches their sinless prey entering a trap without them even knowing it. “How radiant and beautiful you are. Pity you wanted to jump. Do you want me to let you go?”
Across the pool, a heavy door located towards the locker rooms was pushed opened and slowly, the door screeched until it was closed shut. Distant footsteps echoed through the empty pool, making Sherlock’s skin crawl in curiosity. Then the door leading towards the pool was being opened, a small sliver of the stranger’s face appeared and it wasn’t enough data to allow Sherlock the excitement of guessing who the man could be.
Sherlock stared at the man again. “Good idea.” The detective pressed the button. “I have a inkling that you’re becoming like me.”
Sherlock jolted into awareness, his eyes shot open and he was greeted by the ceiling fans that were spinning and spinning above him. Sherlock extended his left hand, ridiculously expecting John to be by his side but he was only met by an empty space that consisted of grains and pebbles of asphalt. Sherlock let out a sluggish groan and sat up too quickly for his own good, the world around him began to spin uneasily and Sherlock felt acidic bile rising up in his throat… he vomited.
Sherlock smirked at detecting the tiny hint of irritation embedded in Mycroft’s voice. “Again, what’s it to you?”
John smiled and moved to the side, letting Molly stand next to Sherlock and observing the results Sherlock found when a man entered the lab.
Soo Lin softly parted away from the John’s lips. “Thank you.” She gave John a small kiss at the corner of his mouth before leaving.
The blond twisted in his seat to see a taxi parked ahead. Sherlock noticed a passenger in the taxi. “It stopped. Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out.” The detective continued staring, “Why a taxi? Oh, that’s clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?”
Moriarty slammed John against the ground, carefully avoiding the latex on John’s body and licking his lips while he dug his fingers into John’s wounds. “Ya know what, Johnny boy. For you, I’m willing to get my hands dirty.”
“Okay. Sherlock, listen to me. My name is John Watson and you’re experiencing a seizure due to an overdose. Can you tell me when was your last hit?”
Spalding didn’t care to see what were the boy’s intentions so, he continued driving in silence and missed the entire commotion Sherlock began.
Omega. The Alpha was already making his excuses to Jim and Sebastian when he noticed that the boy ran away from the party and disappeared.
“Yes. I just needed a word to capture your attention. Sherlock, what the hell is happening to you? Ever since that encounter with what’s his name?”
P.s. In this episode, we are introduced to Soo Lin Yao played by Gemma Chan and I have the hugest fucking love for her. She’s my wifey and because of that reason, her fate in this chapter will be different.
The detective pointed at the small blotches of mud coloring the woman’s tights and began to explain how Jennifer had to drag a suitcase behind her, which caused these tiny splashes to land on her tights. Sherlock squatted down by the woman’s body and examined the back of her legs more closely. “Now, where is it? What have you done with it?”
John was wiping down the tables when he heard the loud raindrops outside. He frowned at not listening to the weather anchor this morning while getting dressed. Since he was the only one closing today, he’ll have to walk back to his flat under the cold rain.
Mary Morstan: trained assassin, few in the population to be a woman and a werewolf, an Alpha, and above all, a liar. To those who couldn’t read between the lines, Mary seemed harmless but her looks were deceiving. Mary was part of Moriarty’s lineage and she was nothing more than a loyal follower who despised vampires.
The D.I. smiled, “Thank you.” He barely noticed John sitting down. “Oh, hello John. Nice to see you again. I hope this berk apologized to you properly. By the way, what happened to your nose, Sherlock?”
Sherlock made small circles on John’s lower back, swirling his slender fingers in repetitive motions and silently keeping track of the number of heartbeats that resounded through John’s chest. Sherlock lowered his head and nuzzled his nose against John’s hair, smelling the traces of desert sand and the rays of the blazing sun burning over the Afghanistan territory.
“Cover would have been perfect. Businessman, making frequent trips to Asia. Lukis was the same, a journalist writing about China. Both of them smuggling stuff about. The Lucky Cat was their drop off.”
Sherlock watched the D.I. walk away. “Is it a coincidence that you’re feeling hungry and the only place you want to eat from, is the place where John works at?”
The second hit caused the Alpha to fall to the ground, Victor cowardly curled himself into a ball and whined like an injured animal. The Omega boy took the opportunity to run, Sherlock threw himself from the bed and landed on the floor face first. The boy sobbed unsteadily, he picked up his battered body and with shaky legs, reached for the door and fled from the room.
John remained quiet; he hasn’t really concerned himself with being around Sherlock because the image of him being rejected was so fucking freshly implanted in his mind. He purposely avoided sharing the same air as Sherlock but this was the first time that he’s been in the same room with Sherlock since their last encounter.
John removed the cloth from his throat and placed himself on all fours as he coughed, groaning while taking deep breaths.
All of it was boring. If the boy died, no one would miss him and that gave Sherlock some comfort. The Omega boy was never meant to be happy and didn’t deserve love, in fact, he didn’t deserve anything. The boy only deserved death and darkness; he’s lived long enough to know what the darker side of reality has to offer him.
The blond grew impatient and grabbed a pillow and threw it at the back of Sherlock’s head. The detective faced John. “What?”
John had to stay home and recover, he sent a message to his boss and with such calamity, his boss told him to stay home and get better. The older man assured him that he’ll have Chris take over for him. With a satisfied smile, John placed his phone on the nightstand and slept.
John exhaled loudly and grabbed a napkin and quickly dipped it into a glass of water. Sherlock was so concentrated on the window, nothing could capture his attention, until he felt someone cleaning his chin. The detective didn’t move a muscle but his eyes shifted to see John wiping something off his chin.
Sherlock turned over the envelope, looking at the neatly printed cursive writing that spelled out his name. “She used a fountain pen. Parker Duofold, Meridian nib.”
Before Sherlock and John could proceed; Greg cleared his throat and said, “Um, mates. We’re here at Camp Redwood already.”
John roughly swatted Sherlock’s hand away, shoving the taller boy back with a violent push. “You’re Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock made an irritated sound; expecting John to move or at least scurry past their discussion but as Sherlock looked up to face John, Sherlock realized that he was alone.
The detective released her and headed towards the door. “Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on!”
The horses stopped in place, standing on their hind legs and neighing loudly, the coachman pulled back the reins and tried to control the horses. The center of the tree was entirely rotten, once the spark of fire reached the inside of the tree, there was another huge explosion. Chunks of the dead tree were flying everywhere and due to the heat, the sounds, and the unexpected events, the horses fled without the command of their master.
Sherlock chuckled. “That’s alright. I guess I deserved that. Sometimes a good hit on the nose is much needed and it helps to clear up the sinuses.”
Mrs. Hudson headed into the kitchen and came back with a newspaper in hand. “What about these suicides, then Sherlock? Are you going back to solve this one? I thought that’d be right up your street. Three exactly the same.”
Since Greg was hosting the party, it was only natural for Mycroft to take up the responsibility of being by his mate’s side and supporting him. Though such support towards Greg was accompanied by the nonstop ramblings of his younger brother. Mycroft, being the Alpha between the two, had more power over Sherlock and had the
Mycroft stared at his brother, not believing any word. He got up from his seat, “May I give you a piece of advice?”
Sherlock looked at the clock located across from him, abandoning his post of deducing humans and beginning to scan the streets below for his upcoming candidates. His electric blue eyes kept moving like the needle found on the Richter scale until the two werewolves he was looking for, had finally shown their faces,
Sherlock stared at himself for a long time until the Omega boy couldn’t handle it anymore, the boy felt his chest fluttering with broken sobs. Sherlock placed both hands on the sink to prevent himself from falling to the ground, he wanted to breakdown and feel the exact moment when his body —which was made of glass— would eventually shatter into pieces.
John sensually came an inch closer, almost pressing his lips against Sherlock’s. “I’d like to see you try, Sherlock.”
The detective faced the murderer outside, the man, Jeff, exchanged a few words with Sherlock before entering his taxi, causing the detective to follow behind, joining the man in the taxi.
Sherlock remained quiet, not answering the question but sensing a horrible tension coiling inside his stomach that was enough to pull apart his intestines. The detective did everything he could to not appear panicked.
The phone beeped once and a photograph popped up on the screen, it depicted a living room that seemed abandoned, a flat that hasn’t been occupied by anyone in a long time.
Sherlock began his long explanation about the age of the woman, her ride to Cardiff, her unhappy marriage which resulted in her having a string of lovers, the presumed name that was carved into the wooden floor is Rachael and finishing with the obvious element, a suitcase.
People wore masks for the first few weeks but everyone adapted to the contaminated air which resulted into the disposal of masks. London was considered the most polluted city that was on the brink of extinction. Airports, boats, trains, any type of transportation was closed off, no one could enter London and no one could ever leave London.
Due to the constant nagging from Mycroft, it pushed Sherlock to seek peace and serenity from the additive source of drugs.
“The Watsons have a long history of preying on wealthy families and killing off their in-laws and spouses. Before coming here, the Watsons have been accused of murdering three royal families and taking their wealth. They are like black widows, once they have feasted on their prey, they become hungry for power, title, and wealth. Unfortunately, we’re their next prey.”
Due to perfect timing, the teachers were exposed to seeing Sherlock on top of Victor and the discarded clothes on the leafy grounds. Immediately, Sherlock was yanked off of Victor and roughly restrained while all the students told the same story of how Sherlock took advantage of the Omega. Sherlock was trying his best to tell the teachers that those were all lies and even through his tears, no one believed him.
Sherlock and John arrived at 221B, they both entered the building and leaned against the wall while catching their breath and removing their coats.
Sherlock got up. “Well, dear brother, thank you for appearing but we really must be going. John, come along.”
Mrs Hudson came up the stairs and eyed Sherlock curled into the couch; his back directed towards her. “Woo-hoo. Have you two had a little domestic?”
Before the guards could touch John, the doctor took out his handgun and shot the two guards coming towards him.
Sherlock was a bit confused as to why this ‘John’ didn’t speak a word. “Why didn’t you ask him whether he wanted to eat here or take it to go instead of signaling?”
John was still trying to do his best to make Angelo understand that he wasn’t Sherlock’s date but John failed again, god how he hated that he couldn’t physically speak.
Sherlock directed his attention towards Molly; snorting at her trembling form and bowing down before her, dramatically emphasizing his movements. “Run. Skip. Hop. Jump. Do whatever you like.”
Sherlock leaned closer to the smaller man, “Shall I continue my deductions about you or will you just tell us why you didn’t speak.”
Sherlock quickly answered. “I am. John, didn’t you tell me that you wanted a Mazda RX8 for your birthday.”
The Alpha gained so much power that he was able to access the system belonging to London and he controlled everything. At his command; jobs were nonexistent unless you wanted to be a sniper, businesses were shut down but all the money acquired would go to the mysterious leader, banks were overrun and left without a cent, shops were scavenged but transformed into warehouses for weapons, and schools were burned to the ground but the children were manipulated to becoming thieves with no mercy.
Sherlock saw the flash of desire sparking through John’s features and he knew that this was not a losing battle; somewhere inside his little scorpions’ bleeding heart, John wanted him as much as Sherlock did. But he knew that the process of making John his would take time… a lot of time. And for that, Sherlock was willing to push John’s boundaries to the extreme.
Sherlock and John went back to the shop, they both went inside a Chinese restaurant that was across the Lucky Cat shop. They ordered food and ate, well… John was eating while the detective watched him.
Greg couldn’t hold back his opinions any longer. “When are you ever going to come to terms that you like John. Or at least admit to yourself that you’re starting to feel something for him.”
The Omega boy began to crawl back, trying to put a great distance between himself and the aroused Alpha.
Sherlock heard his phone beeping, quickly grasping it and smiling. “Excellent. A view of the Thames. South Bank, somewhere between Southmark Bridge and Waterloo. You check the papers, I’ll look online.”
The detective smirked. “Because of the soap, Van Coon used a specific soap in his apartment which coincidentally, his PA used the same brand. What can you deduce from that?”
Victor took one last look at Sherlock and snarled, “As if I’d like someone like you, fucking freak.”
Sherlock forced himself to peel his eyes away from John’s wounded form and make eye contact with Jim. “Dear Jim… please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover’s nasty sister? Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?”
Killing the werewolf targets be damned; Sherlock was not going to let any harm fall upon John and because of that, the vampire lifted his gun and aimed at the back of Bainbridge’s head. Without even remotely thinking of the consequences, Sherlock pulled back the trigger and took the shot. Exactly when John was about to reach down for Bainbridge’s legs, the Omega noticed the mysterious Alpha pulling the trigger and a bullet was flying towards the back of Bainbridge’s head.
John has never felt this emotion towards someone before, it was odd. John smacked his palm against his forehead,
Soo Lin smiled in return and leaned forward, capturing John’s lips in a benevolent kiss. She lingered a bit as she pried John’s mouth open, which John gladly reciprocated. John held onto her hips as Soo Lin pressed herself against John.
Minutes later, Sherlock opened the door for John and hours after, the forensic team came and entered the flat.
“A dangerous virus. A sickness that slowly deteriorates the human body. Yet it does not kill their victim, an ever long disease that will never kill the human body.”
Molly continued talking, not noticing the evident attraction between John and Jim. “That’s how we met. Office romance.”
The detective loved seeing John being on the somewhat same level as him even though John was a bit slow. “You’re on sparkling form. What else?”
John became fidgety at the intense stare the detective was giving him, so he grabbed Sherlock’s wallet and started heading towards the door. “
“Thank you.” Sherlock returned his gaze to the window but his eyes always seemed to travel towards John’s direction.
Mycroft chuckled. “Well, you don’t need to know about that, do you? Besides, a case like this, it requires… leg work.”
Mycroft tried to deduce the detective’s feelings but as always, Sherlock was emotionless. “What’s going on, Sherlock?”
Raz eyed John. “You always did have a thing for blond’s. Alright, I’ve got two minutes before a Community Support Officer comes around that corner.”
Before John could stop himself, he pulled back the trigger but Sherlock managed to throw off the Omega’s aim and instead, the bullet carved its way through the platform.
Sherlock groaned when the pain of the beating spread across his face, he angrily spat an incredible amount of blood onto the floor. Sherlock looked up and saw John easily pushing Jim to the side, Sherlock grinned in a feral manner when witnessing Moriarty falling to the ground and whining like he always does. But Sebastian proved to not be an easy target to take down.
Sherlock began to play a rapid beat on the violin, a screeching high-pitched tune that was horrible to hear but it continued until Mycroft left 221B. The detective angrily placed the violin on his lap and fiddled with the bow in his hand.
The Omega boy was losing air, his lungs were hurting and he was on the verge of having a panic attack unless he managed to breathe in the next few seconds. Sherlock powerlessly tried to move his head to the side to breathe, till finally the boy caught a glimpse of the lamp on the nightstand. The Omega boy tried to take in as much air as he could before Victor cruelly pulled his head up.
Sherlock stopped circling Eric and stood before the man. “And your opportunity of achieving more sex came when your uncle told you about John. You desperately wanted to meet the man who your uncle so often talks about and you came here with one purpose in mind, making John fall for you and convincing him to come back to your flat.”
“A name.” Sherlock asked in irritation. John put more pressure on the wound which caused the man to yelp in horrible pain. “The name!” The detective asked furiously.
“Using scraps of information — credit and bills, receipts. He flew back from China, then he came here.”
With slow hands, John scanned each item, becoming annoyed at the loud voice that emitted from the machine whenever he did something wrong. Once John managed to scan everything, he entered his card, waiting for the machine to proceed his payment when the bloody machine began to boldly state that an
Sherlock would never stoop down to become a target to his enemies but when the boy realized that John Watson was the syringe to his veins, how on earth could Sherlock let go of the only instrument that allowed him to enjoy heroin. A beautiful addiction couldn’t be abandoned so easily and John Watson was an addiction that Sherlock couldn’t get enough of.
Jim giggled, reaching into his pocket and exposing a vial filled with a liquid that even Sherlock couldn’t identify. “This. Is. What. Is. Inside. Your. Little. Boy. Toy.”
John was wiping down the counters in Speedy’s. Today had been an unbearably slow day but luckily, today John had a short shift. Already, he’s done four hours of work, now he needed to complete the remaining three. John wasn’t really paying attention to the conversation taking place behind him when the owner of Speedy’s called his name.
Soo Lin looked at the pots. “I had to finish. To finish this work. It’s only a matter of time. I knew he would find me.”
In fact, Sherlock did find the Omega very pretty and timidly blushed as he admitted that Victor was nice and sweet. Victor offered his hand to Sherlock and prompted the Alpha to follow him past a few hidden bushes that were located behind the school playground. Victor checked to see if anyone could see them and to his satisfaction, Sherlock and him were well hidden behind the thick bushes.
The detective moved a bit to study the deep slashes across the victim’s belly. “Professional curiosity.”
Due to Sherlock’s cold demeanor, this brought upon an awakening of other bullies that were waiting for someone like Sherlock to be their leader. In exactly two days, Sherlock managed to create his own posse with fucked up people who never failed to let Sherlock down. His group included backstabbing characters like Jim Moriarty, Sally Donovan, Irene Adler, Sebastian Moran, Phillip Anderson, and Janine Hawkins.
The door flung open and Mycroft stepped inside. “Ah, my favorite little brother still exists. That’s lovely to know.”
The Alpha straightened himself up and sniffed the air like he was a trained bloodhound, trying to decipher any signs that John was being held in this poorly lit room when he caught sight of a person in the far corner.
John was tossed towards the kitchen; crystal glasses were exploding due to the force of the bomb and broken pieces of glass violently penetrated the Omega’s skin. John was slammed against the fridge, he fell on his side and landed on the cracked pieces of glass and wood.
The detective was busy eyeing everything, he noticed the different schedules illuminated by a projector, passes that were required to enter particular places, and elevator numbers that changed by the second. They walked to the front desk, Sherlock gave his name and they were shown to an empty office.
“Can’t be as simple as it seems, otherwise the bomber wouldn’t be directing us towards it. Something’s wrong.”
Sherlock chuckled, grinning widely and dragging his thumb across John’s lower lip. “Why don’t you just admit that we’re perfect together? Think about it, just you and me against the rest of the world.”
“Yeah, I know who you are.” The Detective Inspector didn’t shake Sherlock’s hand. “And I would prefer it if you didn’t tamper with any of the evidence.”
But this was for John’s sake, perhaps he can find John before the wedding and they can elope together. Or he can tell John about the abominations his parents have done and save John. Or… damn, he needed to save John Watson, no matter the cost. Sherlock will not be a slave to his brother’s threats, so, Sherlock decided to tell the coachman to ride faster and arrive at the cathedral earlier than expected, so he can tell John everything.
This was the first time where Sherlock encountered a person who fought back, it was oddly refreshing to finally have a strong opponent. Sherlock had finally met his match and he swore that John Watson would be the only one who would ever have the privilege to fight him back. Sherlock could feel the sputters of blood oozing from his nose and mouth when something horrendously occurred which pissed off the taller boy.
“Sorry boys! I’m so changeable!” Moriarty returned to the pool, throwing his hands in the air and eyeing the couple on the floor.
All the other groups were relieved to learn that the famous Sherlock Holmes was chosen to attend Camp Redwood. Sherlock Holmes was the popular/feared boy at school; Sherlock was a nineteen-year-old boy who smoked cigarettes and created mischief. The highly functioning sociopath was famous due to his nonstop deductions that gave him a victimizing ambient that created the most heartless bully in school.
After they finished eating their cakes and drinking their teas, they both exited the bakery and somehow ended up in a mall shopping for clothes. Mycroft mentioned that he loved to shower Gregory with gifts and he was particularly stuck in finding clothes for the D.I. The blond helped Mycroft pick out the clothes that Lestrade liked and after two hours, they managed to put together a new wardrobe for the D.I.
The boy was panting heavily, he felt his throat closing up on him so he took out his inhaler and gave himself two puffs of air. Sherlock closed his eyes and felt the medication in his inhaler reviving his bruised flesh. The Omega boy stuffed the inhaler in his pocket and decided to go to the bathroom. The boy entered the bathroom belonging to Omegas and eyed his bleeding face.
Yet it was a delightful sensation to see the moment when John sensed Sherlock’s presence, Sherlock could see John’s posture becoming stiff and the deliciously slight twitch running through John’s hands. Sherlock couldn’t help the shiver running down his spine; this is the effect he had on John, he had the power to make John revert back into a primitive instinct that screamed of hostility.
Sherlock sighed in relief, “I have no game. I came here to apologize for everything I said. I-I couldn’t function properly without coming here and making things right.” The detective felt so open and vulnerable, he’s never been so honest to anyone before but for some reason, he didn’t despise it, rather he welcomed it. Sherlock slowly approached John and was happy to see that he didn’t back away.
Mrs Hudson was in the kitchen, setting the groceries on the kitchen table. “Oh, dearie. John will come back. He always does.”
Sherlock was not used to someone appraising his special gift that everyone found annoying. His natural talent to deduce everything was usually despised by everyone except for John. He was genuinely shocked, “Really?”
John growled and took Sherlock’s tongue in between his teeth and brutally bit down with such a force that Sherlock let out a tortured yell. Sherlock dug his nails into John’s wrists, inflicting pain upon John until John released his tongue. Splashes of blood were covering John’s teeth and to return the favor, John hateful spat blood into Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock lunged towards the syringe like a starving beast who hadn’t had a meal in ages and lightly slapped his arm, prompting his green veins to pop up. The Alpha skipped the whole nonsense of wrapping something around his arm before injecting the heroin in his veins, Sherlock plunged the golden liquid into his system and sighed in relief when his stability came back for a bit.
After two days of being in bed, drinking tea, taking medicine, and repeating the whole process again, John’s mind kept drifting to that night. He went over how Sherlock genuinely wanted him to accept his apology. John was used to people not caring about his feelings and beating his confidence to ashes. He’s never felt any compassion before and seeing Sherlock begging for forgiveness, well, quite frankly it frightened John.
Sherlock remained silent as he eyed John, beaming with pride at seeing how smart John was. The detective always forgot how John wasn’t terribly slow, instead John was witty and Sherlock liked that about John. Sherlock thought back to John’s comment and wondered if in this situation, a kiss is required to show how appreciated he was with John.
Sherlock stumbled onto the ground, feeling his mind going into a frenzy as he processed what just happened.
“Do you reckon this is connected, then, the bomber?” Greg asked as he pointed towards the dead body with his chin.
The Omega snorted in laughter and turned to face Sherlock, for the first time in a short period of time, John believed that the Alpha before him was actually… sweet. Sherlock, to his greatest disbelief, considered the man who was about to save his life… interesting. The Alpha never considered anyone to be worth his time but Sherlock really did regret being a cock to this Omega.
Sherlock sensually dragged his tongue across the nape of John’s neck and moaned when the taste of John’s skin imprinted onto his tongue. “The things you do to me, John Watson. You drive me insane with the urge to have you beneath me, to have you at my mercy and letting me inside you.
John’s blood was valuable on the market, for what reason, the Omega had no idea. But John was certain that his blood was desired for an obscure purpose. And it was no surprise that his current case, which involved ending the bloodline of Jim Moriarty, was connected to the hunt for his own life.
Sherlock smirked as he looked out at the Thames. “Inference, the dead man knew something about it, something that would stop the owner getting paid 30 million pounds. The picture’s a fake.”
Since that day, Sherlock hated Omegas and through the bruises, cuts, wounds, and scars that were placed onto Sherlock’s body and the wrongful label of Sherlock being a monster, he managed to survive. Sadly, his survival only encouraged the torments of others to bully him to no end but a situation where an Omega hatefully accused him of something he didn’t do, never
Not a healthier option but cigarettes were more manageable. Since the incident with… Sherlock shook his head and abandoned those painful memories of his past. Sherlock returned to enjoying his cigarette and after taking a few drags, the Alpha sneered in disgust and hid his fangs from the public with his hand.
“Obviously, but why were they painted? Want to communicate, why not use email?” The detective said as he looked through the dead man’s pockets, while eying the blond.
When John returned to his prior spot —his cock against Sherlock’s face— the Omega was already seated on top of the Alpha. Sherlock fell down against the ground with a painful shove, he was being crushed. John was seated on top of him, his thighs were still caging around Sherlock’s head when the Omega delivered a bitter punch across the vampire’s face.
Sherlock ignored the D.I.’s correction of his own name. “How did you know that Mycroft was the one for you?”
” Sherlock said shakily, his voice was on the verge of trembling when he swallowed down his saliva and tried calling out John’s name again.
“No, no, no. The buttons are stiff, hardly touched. He set his alarm like that a long time ago. But there’s something else. The killer must have been interrupted, otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely. There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting the dead man works somewhere recognizable, some kind of institution.”
The detective quickly got to his feet while John downed the last bits of his food, catching up to Sherlock.
Sherlock placed his hands behind his back and bit back the urge to punch his brother square in the face for saying those words.
Gears were screeching to a halt, data running through his brain made no sense, the very basis of breathing was incomprehensible, and the unawakened feelings from the past were drowning Sherlock. Darkness was absorbing his body, walls were closing in around him, his throat was thickening and the painful cutting edge of guilt was eating him alive. Sherlock’s past had finally caught up to him.
John was humiliated and shocked. Who does this man think he is? Telling John’s life story without skipping a beat. Yet, what stung John the most, was to listen to this man mentioning his failures and how pathetic he was for working at a café.
John was showering in his room, once he was clean, he dried himself off and slipped on a pair of sweats along with fluffy black socks. The blond was shirtless, he was trying to find his comfy T-shirt but the stupid piece of clothing wasn’t showing up. He went downstairs while burying his hands in his pockets belonging to his sweats. The slight creak of the floor captured the detective’s attention and Sherlock ripped his gaze from the microscope and his eyes landed on John’s sculpted back.
Mycroft patted Sherlock’s shoulder. “None of the sort. I have uncovered a piece of information that might help relieve yourself from getting married.”
The woman reached behind her back and pulled out a gun, pointing the weapon at John’s forehead. “I was willing to do you no harm but after recent events, I change my mind. You see, we’re not after you, we’re after Sherlock Holmes. The man who is your partner and lover.”
Sherlock eyed the wreckage on the ground and noticed John in the kitchen; plates, cups, cabinets, microscopes, and broken chairs were surrounding the Omega’s unconscious body. Sherlock felt his chest tightening when he madly pushed through the destruction and rushed to John’s side, turbulently moving the debris from the Omega’s body.
Sherlock and John headed to New Scotland Yard, trying to convince D.I. Dimmock that the recent murder of the journalist was similar to Van Coon’s murder and somehow their deaths were connected. Through a tedious procedure of persuading the D.I., it resulted in the detective winning the argument and managing to enter the crime scene for five minutes.
As soon as the detective began reciting the periodic table, John ran towards Sherlock and stepped on the detective’s hands, giving John a boost to reach the leader.
Anderson scoffed, taking a step forward and hovering over Sherlock. “What the fuck are you talking about Sherlock?! You’re gonna let that little shit walk all over you!”
Mycroft tapped the handle of his umbrella. “Sherlock, even you are a terrible liar. I must admit, in the beginning I didn’t understand the interest you took upon John Watson. I thought he was too simple for you. But then, when I briefly met him, I realized that he’s not excessively terrible. And judging by Gregory’s positive comments on the man, I approve of the idea of you and him becoming more than just flatmates and friends.”
John looked at the detective and looked at the building ahead, if he calculated this correctly, they should come upon the taxi by taking this route. The blond smiled excitedly and pulled the detective from his thoughts.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Mycroft never texts if he can talk. Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried to sell them, got his head smashed in for his pains, end of story… the only mystery is this — why’s my brother so determined to bore me when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting?”
Due to the panic, people began to lose their minds and evolved to tearing London apart. Buildings were being raided and brought down, churches were being ransacked and destroyed, famous monuments were being collapsed to the ground, and the beauty of London was becoming a nightmare. Neighborhoods belonging to the elite were broken into and robbed, the very streets where people walked were no longer deemed to be safe.
John snorted, “Does it look like I care about that? I’m past novelties, captain. You just don’t understand how fucked up this is. I don’t know where Sherlock is and you all keep telling me that he’s dead and there’s no more records of him. I don’t believe any of you! But if my Sherlock is dead, then I’ll finish his work and kill Moriarty myself.”
There were so many times where Sherlock was tempted to go back into injecting heroin in his veins and allowing the golden drug to take him to euphoria. The Omega boy was even curious to see how lovely it would be to overdose and escape reality because existing in this cruel world was leaving behind scars and bruises on his body and face.
Sherlock continued crying, “Really strange that he hired a car, why would he do that? It’s a bit suspicious, isn’t it?”
Miss Wenceslas faced Lestrade. “Inspector, my time is being wasted. Would you mind showing yourself and your friends out?”
Sherlock looked back and heard the receding footsteps of Shan disappearing at the end of the tunnel.
John shook his head, watching as Sally walked away and returned to listening to Lestrade. Greg, Sherlock, and John approached the abandoned car, eyeing the splatters of blood everywhere.
The D.I. couldn’t help but think how cute they both looked. John wrapping the blanket around Sherlock’s shoulders and basically hugging the man. The detective couldn’t deny how nice it felt to have John’s warmth around him, he felt the urge to wrap his arm around the blond’s waist but he ignored that irrational thought and tried to look as innocent as possible.
The detective looked back while the blond’s hand was still covering his mouth. Sherlock mumbled against John’s hand. “How could you tell?”
Of course, it seemed silly and absurd but it could be a possible explanation as to why the detective acted the way he did.
So, one day, Sherlock was in the kitchen, looking through his microscope, studying the reactions between bacteria and different types of acid.
Sherlock lowered the gun towards the bomb that stood two feet away from Jim. If anyone was to die, then they would all die at the same time.
With great difficulty of staying seated in one place, due to the coach shaking from side to side and running over bumps that caused Sherlock to jump out of his seat, the prince managed to open the window. Sherlock was on the verge of telling the coachman to stop the horses when he heard the coachman yelling in desperation.
But no, this time the detective clearly rejected him. John felt like such a damn fool, of course, Sherlock wouldn’t see him other than a friend and flatmate. John pulled away from the detective’s grasp, taking the violin with him and resting it on the floor. He faced Sherlock and gave him a forced smile, an expression that felt foreign to him.
What the hell? Sherlock was a brilliant human being, ever since he was young. Surpassing everyone in his classes and making a name for himself. Any problem in front of him, he could solve it in three seconds. There were better things in this world than having
“Not about. Exactly a pint.” Sherlock haughtily walked around the car. “That was their first mistake. The blood’s definitely Ian Monkford’s but it’s been frozen.”
Sherlock’s left arm came over John’s, placing his fingers over John’s as he helped his flatmate hold the violin correctly. “That’s how you hold the violin.”
Mycroft snickered and headed towards the door. “Do my ears deceive me? If I didn’t know better, I’d say that you’re acting like enamored child who’s in love. But what would you know about love, Sherlock? You met him exactly once. And this is your fifth time seeing him at the wedding.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he went back to the office where the graffiti was, taking pictures of the symbols. He ran the symbols through his head, searching his mind palace to see what the signs meant. Then the detective looked out the window, a thought crossing his mind as he opened the window to the office.
John shook his head at the ludicrous thought and decided to not visit the ‘maybe I like Sherlock Holmes’ lane and move on. He returned his attention to the violin and awkwardly studied the instrument.
Sherlock couldn’t help but stop and let himself be amazed by John’s intelligence and how quickly the blond seemed to grasp things. “I haven’t the faintest idea. Hungry?”
Sherlock got up from his seat and walked towards the window. “Four.” He noticed something was wrong. “There’s been a fourth. And there’s something different this time.”
Sherlock was ready to entertain his Alpha brother for a bit before Sherlock skillfully removed the tracker from his phone and hid away from the CCTV cameras so he could peacefully enter the den that distributed heroin and score enough heroin to last him for about a week. Before the Alpha left his flat, Sherlock noticed an untouched syringe filled with heroin.
The entire flat was dark and musty, the curtains were closed and the lack of fresh air gave the flat a familiar stench that belonged in a crack den filled with junkies that haven’t showered in a week. The Alpha didn’t realize that his phone was ringing off the hook and constant text messages were being sent. Sherlock clumsily reached for his phone and scrolled past the 17 missed calls and 58 unread messages.
John turned around to face his familiar boss and a smile was on its way to his lips when John unconsciously took a step back. He looked up at the tall young man standing before him.
“Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight. That’s the frailty of genius, John: it needs an audience.”
John looked at the dessert in front of him and couldn’t help but take a bar and savor its taste. While the blond was enjoying the sweets, Sherlock was still looking out at the window as he quietly drummed his fingers on the table.
Sherlock and John returned to the flat, Sherlock quickly opened his laptop and entered his findings onto the website that the bomber eagerly revisited in order to see if Sherlock cracked the case. Once Sherlock posted the solution to the case, he received a phone call.
Sherlock remained emotionless. “If you think I’m lonely, I’m not. And the idea of liking someone is boring. The notion of being with someone is terribly boring. And even if I did like John in that way, it would never work.”
Oh, John wanted a taste of the sweet nectar that coursed through the boy’s veins. He wanted to drag his tongue across the boy’s scent gland and suck on the skin that
The blond came closer and slipped the shirt off the detective’s arms. He looked up at Sherlock and offered a small smile. John looked down at the detective’s exposed torso and carefully ran his hand over the broad smooth chest. Sherlock felt his breath hitching at the touch but before he could do anything, the blond pulled away.
The prince was dressed formally but he had many medals that stated his participation in the army. Sherlock quickly deduced the man and felt himself smiling softly when he figured out that the prince had been a Captain in many battles and was an army doctor. It wasn’t incredibly visible but the prince walked with a slight limp, yet it was obvious that the prince was shot in the shoulder.
Irene mockingly caressed Molly’s face, wrapping her arms around Molly’s waist and molesting the girl. Everyone began to laugh at the sound of Molly’s screams and gradually, every single person began to mimic Molly’s high-pitched shouts. This continued on for about five minutes when Irene silenced everyone and grabbed Molly’s face.
Sherlock lewdly licked his lips and took the opportunity of approaching John while his little scorpions’ back was towards him.
Sherlock looked away from his phone and glared at the woman. “It’s a very good fake, then. You know about this, don’t you? This is you, isn’t it?”
By the age of ten, Sherlock already learned how to shoot heroine into his veins and calculate how much he needed in order to drown out the loud voices of his brother. After his never-ending infatuation with heroine, the boy proceeded to seek out other harmful drugs that fucked up his entire system. Sherlock knew that eventually Mycroft would catch him in the act and true to his word, Mycroft confiscated all the drugs pertaining to his younger brother and forced Sherlock to become clean.
“Is it really possible that every person who commits crimes has vanished? I need a case Lestrade. Find me a case.” Sherlock annoyingly remarked.
Jim accidentally knocked down something from Sherlock’s table, purposely sending the metal bowl towards John’s side. As Jim went to go pick up the fallen item, he sneakily slipped John a piece of paper and walked away.
John took one step forward, almost being chest to chest with Sherlock and balling his hands into fists. “I thought you were the ones who hated hearing people repeating themselves. Can you not hear beyond your own ego? I said leave her alone.”
John remained quiet for a bit until he couldn’t help the loud chuckles escaping his lips. “Is that all you’ve got to go on? Is that the best you can do? Seems pretty basic for the great Sherlock Holmes who deduces everyone’s life in one look.”
John got up from his seat and turned on the television in the restaurant. Sherlock watched John walking away and Sherlock couldn’t help the shine in his eyes become brighter, he really did adore John.
They both raced up a few stairs when John ran to the edge of the building to see a spiral staircase, he looked behind to see if Sherlock was behind him. Once, he saw Sherlock in view, he rushed down the stairs, with the detective right on his tail. John used every strength he had in his legs and gained enough speed to jump from one building to another. Sherlock with no trouble jumped the gap and a quick thought went through his head,
Sherlock chuckled, absolutely worshipping the shrine of darkness before him. “Teach me all the lessons you want. In fact, my pretty golden sparrow, I like seeing you on top. It gives me a salacious preview of how lovely you would look riding my cock.”
Sherlock and John entered a tunnel of some sort, turning on their flashlights and eyeing the dark corners filled with homeless people and discarded garbage that was used to make shelters or shacks. Up ahead, Sherlock saw the shadow of a tall man who stood up and warily looked at the end of the tunnel.
The Alpha shrugged and carelessly stumbled onto the floor before hastily getting up on his feet and smiling like dork before leaving. “When I come back, I’d like a cup of tea.”
The Alpha needed to go buy some more, so, Sherlock decided to shower first before he dressed himself in a blue dress shirt with blue trousers and a matching blue suit jacket. Sherlock ran his fingers through his curls, messing up his dark locks and trying to look presentable because once he steps out of his flat, Mycroft’s minions would pick up on his departure from the flat and follow him.
