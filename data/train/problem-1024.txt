“Bunny can’t sleep,” Sherlock said, shuffling forward when he realized Bunny was resolved to silence.  “Can we sleep in here?”
In any case, Greg was glancing at him with a look that told John wearing a pull-up was non-negotiable.  John may have been able to get his way with Mycroft if he pouted and asked nicely, but Uncle Greg was a different story.  Uncle Greg knew the importance of consistency.  If the rule was that a pull-up was required after an accident, then John would be in a pull-up that afternoon.
“Exactly, sweetheart,” he said.  “If Bunny wants to be a girl sometimes, she’ll be happiest if she listens to how she feels.  Just like you’ll be happiest if you listen when you feel five, or ten, or two.”
“I’d be careful with the juice,” John said, setting plates of ham and cheese sandwiches at the table.  “We had another accident this morning when someone decided building towers for his dinosaurs was more important than using the toilet.”
It was clearly not a coincidence that this memory was returning after the day he'd spent.  His therapist, if he told her the story, would point to the incident as the impetus for his obsession with presenting overly masculine, the underlying cause of the years before Sherlock, when he had staunchly denied his bisexuality.  Mycroft and Sherlock would be sure to categorize the memory as the reason John’s little self was drawn to that which was coded feminine, would explain that his subconscious was using littlespace as a way to re-write a history he’d rather forget.  Greg’s reaction would be far less intellectual; he would fume and rant, detailing the ways in which he’d like to bring the bloke back from the dead in order to kill him himself.
“I don’t doubt that he will,” Mycroft said, voice dripping with the superiority that often accompanied his greatest shows of defensiveness.  “And when that time comes, Sherlock will know the truth.  But that time is not today.  I’ve borne this for him for many years, and I’ll continue to bear it as long as possible.”
“I have to be big,” Sherlock said, worry lines creasing his forehead as he wiped at a tearful eye with the back of his wrist.
As Mycroft helped John out of his pajama shirt and into a plain t-shirt, he found he did feel actual pride at John’s decision.  Caring for John was an entirely different beast than caring for Sherlock.  It had been a long four months of learning how to adjust his caretaking to meet both Sherlock and John’s needs, and Mycroft was pleased John felt comfortable enough in his headspace to venture into public.  He was a bit concerned that John wanted to take such a large step at a time Mycroft would not be able to be with him, but John had been growing more comfortable with Lestrade each time the man visited while the boys were in headspace.  Besides, John was rather reserved, even in headspace.  It would be unlikely he would speak to anyone besides Lestrade and Sherlock (and more likely he would only speak directly to Sherlock), and unlikely anyone would realize the man was in a younger mindset.
John cleared his throat for what he knew was one too many times, glancing down to the floorboards with a quick nod.  He wished he could believe Mycroft’s words, but in years of therapy he hadn't been able to make much progress when it came to self-worth.  At the moment, all he could do was mumble something vaguely assertive, willing the thoughts of his father--his father who had been pleased when John came home with his first black eye after fighting a bigger kid, his father who had drunkenly pulled him out of bed in the middle of one night to force him to climb a ladder in the dark and clean out the gutters, his father who cared more about John not making the football team than he did about John’s nearly perfect GPA--out of his mind.
“Are you okay, bud?” He asked, bending to John’s height.  John looked down to the ground, his cheeks pink and his eyes filling with tears. He suckled hard on his thumb.
“For now, at least,” Greg said.  He took a sip and leaned back into the chair.  “The poor guy’s painfully self-conscious.  Almost always settles down after a few stern words to put him in his place.  Follow that up with a bit of reassurance, and he’ll see reason.”
.  The roles had never been so fully reversed as they were now, and although Sherlock more than enjoyed John's dominant streak when it emerged, he was intrigued by the way in which he'd been able to settle John down into submission, had been content and aroused watching John squirm.
It was because of Sherlock’s snarkiness that Mycroft ignored his better judgement and drove beyond the service station.  If Sherlock wasn’t going to own up to needing a wee, Mycroft was certainly not going to force him.  He wasn’t Sherlock’s caretaker at the moment, as Sherlock was so pointedly making clear.
“Sherlock?” he asked, suddenly dreading what his boyfriend had obviously been building up to saying.  Had he not forgiven John after all? Was he disgusted that John had basically chosen to lie in bed and wet himself?  Was he going to refuse to speak to Mycroft and return to being angry at Bunny?
“No,” he said, then returned to the side of the bed and yanked on his new shark pajamas.  “I’m not a baby.”
They were pulled from their sleepy stupor by a clatter of something falling to the floor and then a mumbling, frantic voice as Sherlock’s bedroom door was pulled open.  Mycroft and Greg were up off of the couch in a moment.  They made their way to the hallway just in time to see John hurry into the bathroom and close the door behind him.
“Ah, alright.  Let’s see if we can’t find it,” John said, standing to gain a better vantage point for searching.
But John shook his head.  He could tell by the look on Sherlock’s face that his eyes had gone dark, that he was the picture of aloof rage.
And then he’d realized he’d wet the diaper he was wearing at some point while he slept, and he felt a stab of disgust that led him to strip the offending item from his hips and finalize his decision to be bigger.  He could feel the usual brattiness settling in, the old familiar tactics he could use even if he wasn’t able to ask for affection in the same way he could when wearing diapers.  He would get attention by acting impudent and unruly, and all would be fine.
He was already beginning to piece together what had happened: a failed dinner party souffle or mismatched table setting that had sent Harry questioning herself and her competency, that had sent Harry to the liquor cabinet, rationalizing that one glass of wine couldn’t hurt.  While he had been jostled on the train and waited in the cold, Harry had fallen deeper into drunkenness.
“Sherlock, Mycroft cares for you very much,” Papa said, and Sherlock already knew that.  He didn’t need a reminder of that fact at the moment, didn’t need Papa emphasizing just how much Sherlock had screwed up.
John knocked Sherlock's shoulder with his own, then leaned over to shut his boyfriend up with a kiss.  After the stress of the day, there was a wonderful familiarity in knowing they had nothing to worry about but allowing their heartrates to get back to normal so they could get some sleep.
“Lock?” Mycroft tried, and Sherlock turned to hide his face again, because this time he wasn't able to keep himself from starting to cry.
The prospect of Mycroft’s arms around him sounded like the most appealing situation in the world at the moment, and John felt surprisingly as if he might cry from the sheer fact that it was available to him just down the hallway.
“It’s not best to come out with it all?” Greg asked, skeptical.  “Be upfront? He’s not actually a child, anymore, Mycroft.”
“Oh, shush,” their mother said, hitting Mycroft softly on the arm with her dishcloth.  “Let your old parents enjoy their nostalgia, won’t you?  At least we're not insisting on reading you
John paused in his discussion with Sherlock's older brother, voice trailing as he heard the trickling and turned to face Sherlock.
He was pleased to see that the boy did not shy away from him now that he was not attempting to take him out of the car, instead burying his face into his chest as he pressed against his side and cried.  But Bunny was wriggling and grabbing himself, and Greg knew they were out of options.
Sherlock wiped his nose on the back of his wrist and sat up taller in Mycroft’s arms.  The street was quiet, lamps lit to cast a hazy glow on the pavement below.
“Please don’t go, Papa!” Bunny cried, and he knew he wasn’t being fair to his Papa, that it wasn’t Papa’s fault there were bad men and he had to go to work, but he couldn’t help it.  He needed him.
“I think so,” he said.  “And, Sherlock, you’ll be doing chores to pay for what you ruined.  It’s never okay to destroy others’ things.  Understand?”
“I’m not doubting John’s motives, Greg,” Mycroft said, attempting to keep the sarcasm from his voice because he knew Greg disliked the tones he often took.  “I’m just wondering if John may have more than just caretaking on his mind.”
“Get inside before you disgrace yourself,” Mycroft said as he pulled into the parking lot of the expressway rest stop.
As he climbed the steps to their flat, he shoved the idea of even that small amount of comfort out of his mind.  He didn’t need age play.  There were Sherlock’s tasks to complete.  God knew John had felt enough incompetence within the past few days to last him years; if he could help to finalize the case now, even in a small way, he would be grateful.  Sure enough, as he reached the landing in front of the door of 221b, his phone chimed with a text from Sherlock.
“You were excited,” Mycroft said, softening around the eyes as he smiled at him.  “It was charming.”
“Like a princess,” he said, and John smiled even wider, unconcerned that his cheeks were beginning to hurt.
Sherlock could sense that Bunny needed comfort in the moment, so he held his stuffed alligator--which had been in his arm along with his dinosaur--towards his brother.  Bunny took it with gratitude, hugging it close, and Mycroft patted Sherlock again on the thigh to signal a job well done.  Sherlock did his best to accept the praise, fighting against the desire to squirm out of Mycroft’s lap.  He needed to focus on what felt nice, not on what the voice in his brain told him was needy behavior.
Greg nodded, and John was relieved he was following the boundaries John was working so hard to set, at least for the moment.  It had been an emotionally charged morning, and an emotionally charged few days in the lead-up to the holidays.  John fumbled his phone out of his pocket to plug it into the car charger, then let his head fall back against the seat as Greg pulled out of the service station.  He just needed to make it until after lunch on Christmas Day, and then he would be more than happy to let Greg baby him to his heart’s content.
John climbed out of bed and stretched.  He could not help but get his hopes up that Mycroft had arrived.  He may no longer be feeling as if he needed his Daddy, but he certainly felt as if he needed Mycroft to help him process his feelings and emotions of the night before, feelings he had been struggling with for a few weeks, now.
John snorted a laugh, then caught Greg’s chuckling, and they laughed until they were breathless as Greg once more took hold of his elbow to lead him inside.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said, in a warning voice.  Apparently there was a limit to his brother’s patience, even in a do-over situation.  Mycroft may have been rewinding to fix the circumstances surrounding Sherlock learning of the new Bunny and Mycroft dynamic, but Sherlock was also expected to re-do his reaction to the telling.
He reached for the pacifier on the table, but Mycroft picked it up first, holding up a finger to let him know they were almost finished.
Greg had entered the living room not far behind Mycroft, and he stepped beside him at that moment, taking Bunny from his arms and shushing the boy in order to give Mycroft freedom to handle Sherlock.  Mycroft turned his head expectantly towards his brother, who was still perched on the couch.  He stared until Sherlock, grumbling that it wasn’t fair and that he always got in trouble and that they liked Bunny more than him, stomped to the corner of the room for timeout.
He wanted to tell the boy that everything would be alright, wanted to tell him that no one could be sad on Christmas and there was nothing he wanted to be doing more than spending time watching Christmas movies with him, Sherlock, and Papa.  He wanted to tell him that Daddy was just fine.
He cried because he wanted Papa and because he’d wet his pants, because he’d let everyone down and because John and Mycroft were going to be so disappointed because he hadn't hurt himself in so long.  But most of all, he cried because the hopeless thoughts had been with him all day, because nothing he’d tried had made them go away and he’d only succeeded in making everything worse.
Greg made quick work of dressing him in warm sweatpants cuffed at the ankle and a soft t-shirt before handing him his stuffed lion and telling him to hang tight.  He was gone for only a moment before returning with one of his own sweaters, which he pulled over John’s head.  It was far too big for John, but that was the point, a trick Mycroft and Greg sometimes used to help the boys age down.  John felt warm and content and very young as Greg reached to roll back the sleeves which had fallen past John’s fingertips.  Greg pulled up the hood, and John felt safe in Uncle Greg’s care.
There was a moment where both Uncle Greg and Sherlock assessed John’s current wardrobe.  He was wearing his second favorite pair of pajamas.  They were not quite as babyish as his bunny pajamas--his favorite--but they were yellow and green and covered in lions like his favorite stuffed animal.  They were certainly not unobtrusive.
He heard Mycroft sigh, which made John worry that he would be angry.  But Mycroft’s voice was soothing when he next spoke.  “That’s okay, bunny.  Everyone has accidents from time to time.  Does Uncle Greg know so he can help you clean up?”
“You don't need to censor yourself, John,” Mycroft said.  “I need to know if I am to properly care for you.”
Sherlock focused on the melody his brother was humming, letting it slowly calm him as he followed its notes.  Eventually, he no longer felt such a heavy weight on his chest, and he could breathe normally once more.  He slipped his thumb into his mouth and rested his ear against Mycroft’s, feeling the vibrations of his chest as he continued to hum.
“All set, kiddos?” Papa asked from the driver’s seat, twisting over his shoulder to glance back at them.
Mycroft had been able to see what had been going through John’s mind all afternoon.  The nerves, the worry, the insecurities.  He had come to learn that, unlike Sherlock, John always needed some solo processing time before he was ready to discuss.  It was why Mycroft hadn't spoken up or suggested that the boy age up.  He knew he just had to wait for John to come to him on his own terms, after he had processed himself.
He gathered his comfort items and hurried across the hallway to peek through the crack in Sherlock’s bedroom door.  The room was darkened by the lowered blinds and the storm, but Bunny could see Sherlock sprawled out beneath the sheet, on his stomach, arm tucked close to his side, hugging Dimitri the dinosaur close.
Mycroft and Greg had planned a low-key afternoon and evening for their boys, knowing Sherlock particularly would still be in an adjustment stage as he continued to slip more resolutely into headspace.  Travelling always made for trying days and there was no telling how difficult it might be to put the boys down in separate rooms; Greg and Mycroft planned dinner, a movie, and then lights out.  Mycroft was particularly glad they had made the arrangements for an afternoon in after helping John to clean up from his accident; it was clear the man needed quiet space to process without over stimulation.  The boys played with their toys in the living room while Mycroft and Greg began preparing for an early dinner.
“Papa?” Sherlock asked, sitting up on his knees so he could lean close and whisper into Papa’s ear.  “Are you sleeping?”
It had been all he could do not to run out of the room the moment Bunny entered it.  He’d managed to sit, still and afraid, until the tears had begun and Mycroft and Papa Greg had been rushing to see what had happened.  Bunny sounded as upset as the time he’d wet his pants at the zoo, maybe even sadder, and suddenly Sherlock couldn’t handle the thought that he’d brought Bunny so much pain.  Bunny had been hurt more by his dolls being torn up than perhaps he ever had been in littlespace, and it was all Sherlock’s fault.  He had been selfish and rude, and Mycroft was going to be so disappointed in him.
He found it far easier to express himself to an aged-down Sherlock than he would have had they been talking man to man.  There was an ease of purpose knowing he needed to help little Sherlock understand right from wrong, an ease that was harder to find when plagued with questions over whether it was his place or his right to instruct adult Sherlock.
“I don’t need that,” John said, a tell-tale anger to the edge of his voice as he twisted his head over a shoulder to glance at the offending object.  “Put it back.”
“Exactly, smart boy,” Mycroft said, choosing to ignore the way Sherlock hid his face as he was praised.  “It was important that I helped Bunny feel safe last night after his scary dreams.  Do you understand?”
Bunny let his head fall back against the back panel of the desk.  It had been a rough day, and he was still feeling the effects of not sleeping well coupled with his cold, which only seemed to be getting worse.  Bunny hadn’t meant to misbehave so much throughout the day, but he didn’t feel like himself, hadn’t felt like himself since slipping down into his most recent headspace.
Mycroft had warned him, when John first admitted to his desire to try ageplaying alongside Sherlock as something other than a caretaker.  He had explained that ageplay could lead to recollections of old memories, that its success as a coping mechanism was not linked solely to the comfort it provided.  John had done a fair amount of reading up on the subject himself, had understood why it was important for Mycroft to mention the potential side effects and emotional consequences.  But he had thought himself somehow immune.
“I’ll finish up here as soon as I can and meet you at yours,” Greg said, for which Mycroft was grateful.  “And, Mycroft, I wouldn’t be surprised if I just happen to find the boys already tucked into their beds when I get home.”
Sherlock knew Mycroft cared for Uncle Greg, that they loved each other the way moms and dads loved each other.  Mycroft wasn’t Sherlock’s dad, but he was Bunny’s, and because Bunny was Sherlock’s brother it was almost like Mycroft was his dad, too, except his brother-dad.  But Uncle Greg wasn’t a mom, and although Sherlock knew he wanted Uncle Greg to be a more special part of the family than just an Uncle, Uncle Greg couldn't be another Dad, because Mycroft was already Bunny's Daddy.  He shrugged.
The boy turned his reddened face towards Greg, who wiped away a few stray tears with his thumbs before leaning to press a kiss to the boy’s forehead.
He squirmed a bit in place and slipped his thumb into his mouth, shifting his eyes towards the door to watch in case anyone came in and he needed to pull it away quickly.  He didn’t want anyone to think he actually needed it.
He hung up after a moment and Bunny’s lower lip wobbled, upset that he hadn’t been allowed to talk to his Daddy, nervous that Sherlock was angry.  His nerves were only heightened when Sherlock left the bedroom without a word, and Bunny huddled further in on himself, crying into his knees.  The man returned quickly, however, carrying Bunny’s stuffed rabbit, his baby blanket, and a pacifier, all of which he passed along to Bunny before sliding down the bedroom wall to sit on the floor, leaning his head against the frame of the closet door.
Bunny was feeling nonverbal, young and vulnerable and desperate to never leave his Daddy’s presence again.  He saw Uncle Greg standing not far off, Sherlock half-hidden behind him yet holding Uncle Greg’s hand; it was clear Sherlock needed his own breed of comfort.
Generally, the work kept his longings at bay, distracted him enough to leave the pull of soft clothing and colorful pacifiers by the wayside as he raced against clocks and allowed himself to be absorbed into minutiae.  But there had been whispers of need as their last case was winding down, and,  in the lead-up to the prospect of Christmas at his parents’--a Christmas at his parents’ without John--Sherlock had no longer been able to ignore his desire to be small.
Mycroft set down the knife on the cutting board and hurried into the living room to find the boys where he had left them on the couch.  They were no longer peacefully watching telly, however.  Bunny was now crying, one hand clapped over his forearm.  Sherlock was sitting with his arms crossed, tucked in the far corner of the couch with his knees bent in front of him, glaring.
“I couldn’t find Redbeard,” Sherlock mumbled, and, for a moment, John was unsure if he was adult or little.   “I looked and looked, but I couldn’t find him.”
Greg had known it would be a challenge for John to remain adult given the stress of unfamiliar circumstances and the memory of his sister’s rejection.  There were only so many hours he could be expected to put on a brave face given the sheer amount of effort required to navigate the over-saturated social gatherings of strangers.  Greg was surprised he’d lasted as long as he had, and knew he had his mum to thank for keeping John mostly adult until they’d left for his brother’s.
It was a bit of a test.  Uncle Greg had said it was okay for Bunny to like mermaids and pinks and purples.  He’d even let him buy paper dolls and a floppy plush bunny and a pretty mermaid nightgown.  But his Daddy seemed hesitant, and Bunny was starting to doubt Uncle Greg’s earlier assurances.  Was Uncle Greg wrong?  Did his Daddy not think it was alright for Bunny to have those things?
Greg found Mycroft sitting in the office at his flat, the room dark and a glass of bourbon in his hand.  Greg had taken a seat in the chair on the other side of the desk, denying Mycroft’s insistence that he be left in solitude.  There were cigarette butts crushed into the ashtray.  It was obvious the man had been unmoored by the telling of the events of the Holmes brothers’ past, preoccupied with concern for his brother.  Greg had no intention of leaving him to his own devices.
Greg bounced Sherlock on his hip as he contemplated Bunny’s pleading look.  It was rare that John wet the bed, but it was not out of the realm of what could be expected from time to time.  They’d gotten into the habit of dressing both boys in pull-ups while they slept, and it had saved them from wet sheets more than enough times to make Greg and Mycroft grateful for them.  Greg certainly didn’t want to deal with any wet beds in the middle of the night tonight, and Bunny had asked for a refill of milk at dinner.  Not to mention, when John did wet the bed, it was generally at the least expected moments, and rarely an intentional act on the man's part.  He opened his mouth to tell Bunny it was best if he put a pull-up on just in case, but Bunny spoke first.
Greg could not help but grin from ear to ear.  His brother’s approval had always meant the world to him, from congratulations on elementary school report cards to cheerful shouting in the stands at high school football games, and it was reassuring to know that even the most unconventional aspect of Greg’s life as it currently stood was sanctioned by his big brother.
“Yeah,” Sherlock said.  “Tell Bunny I didn’t really mean that, okay?  Mycroft says I make unfounded generalizations when faced with change.”
John ignored the text, contemplating calling Harry for a third time before deciding to give it another five minutes. He knew from experience that Harry had never been adept at arriving places on time.
John needed his Daddy.  But he hadn’t remembered to place his phone on the nightstand beside him in the chaos and excitement of the night before, and he worried that if he tried to move too much Sherlock would wake up and see what he had done, would be angry and exasperated.
“Do you want your pacifier, bud?” John asked, smiling as he slipped into caretaker mode with the boy.
Greg sighed but stepped into the bathroom and turned on the faucet in the bathtub.  He would need a few moments to get Sherlock’s sheets changed and to find some clean pajamas for the boy; it wouldn’t be the worst idea to have Sherlock occupied while he got things settled.  Besides, he was a kid once, too, and he remembered how uncomfortable and disconcerting it could be to wake up in a wet bed, not to mention feeling sick.  If Sherlock was allowing himself the outlet of emotion, Greg needed to listen to what the boy most needed.
“That’s right, sweetheart,” Papa said, ruffling his hair.  “Now go and give your brother a kiss and see if you can’t get rid of that sad face.”
“Ready to go downstairs?” he asked when Bunny was calmed.  “You, my little one, have a sticker to put on your chart and a movie to choose.”
John walked far, for hours, and found himself not back at Baker Street, but at the pub around the corner from the flat.  It was late-afternoon and thus the pub was quiet, only two other patrons besides the employees in the restaurant, regulars already deep into their pints.  John ordered an early dinner despite his lack of hunger so as not to group himself in with the local drunks when he ordered a pint himself.
Bunny seemed content with the brief synopsis, and Greg was relieved that both boys soon settled in to watch the movie contentedly, quiet except for a few scattered questions about Victorian England and a growing number of giggles.  But there was an incompleteness to the activity given Mycroft’s absence.  Something had been occupying Mycroft’s mind since they’d returned back to London, something Greg needed to get to the bottom of before Mycroft worried himself into a right moodiness.
“My!” Sherlock yelled, launching himself at his brother for a quick hug before extricating himself from Mycroft’s arms and returning to bouncing around the room.  “Uncle Greg said he’d read three books tonight!”
There was a shift in Sherlock’s body language, and Mycroft could not help but feel a pang of remorse that he was abandoning his brother and his not-so-skillfully masked pain.  But it was the best way to ensure Sherlock accepted the story as-is, and his best chance at keeping him distracted, at keeping him from delving further into memory.
“Bunny’s sad,” Sherlock said, sitting uncharacteristically calm, his eyes wide.  He seemed as surprised as Mycroft at Bunny’s little outburst.
“I’m fine, Mycroft,” he said, voice harsh before he seemed to remember that he had been the one to ask Mycroft to come in the first place.  He took a breath.
By the time he stood from the bench to lift his bag, Greg was out of the car and already jumping the steps to meet him on the platform.  He immediately wrapped his arms around John, who, despite having spent the last hour and a half amping himself up towards being big, collapsed into Greg’s embrace.
“And Sherlock has no recollection of her?” was all he asked when Mycroft had ceased his explanations.
John had not often imagined what Sherlock must have been like at uni, but the amount of challenges such a situation must have posed for Sherlock now seemed nearly insurmountable.
Sherlock nodded and began twisting knobs to adjust the water temperature, still wiping tears from his cheeks and his runny nose on the back of his hand.  Greg had to divert the boy away from the cabinet beneath the sink, where he knew Mycroft had stashed bath toys, and instead began undressing him as the tub filled.
The lines establishing the boundaries of their ageplay world had become, suddenly as squiggly and shadowed as the pictures in the coloring book he’d earlier been drawing in.  He was convinced he had, with one statement of rejection, blurred what they had come to understand and know.  He'd made everything ugly and formless, coloring widely outside of the lines.  This time, however, Bunny and Papa were not be giggling.
“Oops,” Bunny said, pretending it had all been an accident, and his Daddy lifted one eyebrow but turned back to Sherlock, who Bunny could see was getting sleepy.
“No,” Greg told him, pleased to be able to answer a question with such an easy, straightforward answer.  “Mycroft and I care for Sherlock and John.  I enjoy providing for them, being there for them to help them find a childhood neither of them had.  I don’t feel the need to regress in age the way they do.”
The boys had been dozing for what Sherlock felt could have been five minutes or half an hour when they heard footsteps trudging up the wooden staircase and towards the bedroom.  Sherlock could still feel the same tendrils of sadness and nervousness he’d felt since waking up that morning clouding his thoughts, but there was also a lightness to the moment.  With Bunny beside him and the benefit of a good, restful nap, he began to feel as if he may be able to start pulling himself out of the darkness.
He took small bites of his breakfast because he knew Mycroft was watching.  He wasn’t hungry, but it was rare that Mycroft let them watch telly this early in the day, and Sherlock didn’t want to press his luck.  He ate with his fingers so he didn’t have to take his eyes from the screen.  He knew there were small bits of scrambled egg and fruit on his hands and probably on his t-shirt, but he didn’t care enough to brush them away.  He felt younger than he had last night, half-conscious of the way he might look to Bunny and Uncle Greg but too exhausted and apathetic to care too much about what anyone thought.
Mycroft did not speak.  He took a step back and pointed to the floor to signal that he was waiting for Sherlock to remove himself from the closet.  Sherlock scrambled to his feet and clambered, dripping, out of the small space and into the bedroom, where he found Mycroft seated in the desk chair.  He was over his big brother’s knee after little more than a jerk of Mycroft’s arm.
Greg made quick work of getting Bunny sorted, finding John’s suitcase in the guest bedroom and the pull-ups, wipes, Peter Rabbit pacifier, and Gryffindor pajama trousers that the man had packed up into a smaller bag that had been shoved down beneath his toiletry kit.  The boy was clean, dry, and calmly tucked into bed before long, practically beaming from the praise Greg showered on him along the way.  John packing for not only himself but for Bunny--however scarce his Bunny bag may have been--was a large step, and the last thing Greg wanted to do was downplay it to the boy.
Sherlock allowed himself to be led to a kitchen chair, where, after a hesitation, John told him it was okay to sit down despite his soiled trousers, and then guided his arm to lay atop the table.  He told Sherlock to wait there while he went to retrieve the first aid kit from the downstairs loo.
“I guess he’s too naughty to have any of the grape juice I bought for him at the grocery, then,” Mycroft said, voice raised, catching a smirking John’s eye.  “And I guess he doesn’t want to solve the new puzzle I brought or play games this afternoon while I’m looking after him.”
But it was clear John needed a break.  Sherlock knew if he refused, John would refuse as well out of loyalty and protectiveness.  There was also a very slim possibility of Mycroft and Greg leaving Sherlock alone at Baker Street.  It wasn’t as if the men were new to Sherlock’s post-case mood swings.  There was a high probability that they had planned the last minute trip specifically because John had told them Sherlock was in a bad place.  So Sherlock hadn’t fought the trip.  But agreeing to go didn’t mean that he’d agree to be little.  He would soldier through without slipping, and thus he would stay in control, fully in charge of his own faculties.
Sherlock breathed a laugh and hurried out of the room, relief overtaking guilt at the moment.  He’d gotten away with it.  No one had to know he’d wet his pants and the floor, he had on a pull-up so no one would know if it happened again, and they were having his favorite for lunch.  Maybe the day wasn’t quite as bad as he’d thought.
John rutted upwards, desperate for the contact.  It was almost like shifting himself against the edge of his mattress or humping against one of his plush stuffed animals, activities John was suddenly worried Sherlock knew he sometimes partook in after waking up in a wet pull-up.  At the moment, however, he only cared that it was familiar and good, that Sherlock’s thigh rocking back and forth against him as he rutted against it was almost mind-numbing.
Sherlock felt Mycroft’s hands by his waist, and suddenly his wet pajama pants were down around his ankles, saturated diaper placed on display.
“Papa!” Bunny called, rushing out of the bathroom in nothing more than the towel wrapped around his shoulders.
Greg almost regretted having to set some ground rules with Bunny.  A moment ago, the boy had been pure excitement and joy; as soon as Greg mentioned chatting, he’d glanced towards the ground and lost his previous sense of careless anticipation.
Sherlock nodded and clambered into a chair on the other side of the table, his limbs always loose and awkward when he was fully regressed.  John whined when he was no longer being held in Mycroft’s arms, but he settled a bit when Mycroft sat next to him and patted his knee.
Sherlock did not move.  He knew Mycroft was serious and that he would only increase his punishment were he to dawdle.  He also knew a spanking was the best path towards headspace at the moment.  But pride was a hard thing to shake.
Greg was unsure of where the boy’s mind was at the moment, but he’d rather the boy not injure himself by attempting to hold onto his urine any longer than he had to.  If the boy was suddenly feeling an intense aversion to using the loo, what was the real harm?  The kid had had a hard day, and seats could be cleaned.
“His clothing choices are quite dark for a reason,” Mycroft smirked.  “You must have noticed the man can never be bothered to care for himself.  He goes days without food or sleep, and he’s always been loathe to use the loo.  That’s nothing out of character for Sherlock, even outside of headspace.”
“John,” he said.  “We spend a good deal of time talking about your feelings toward my behavior as your caregiver.  Perhaps it's time I told you a bit about how I feel towards you as a little.”
“It was hard for you to transition down, today, wasn’t it, buddy?” Greg asked, guiding Sherlock to look up at him by crooking his finger beneath his chin.
John could not help but feel a quick stab of embarrassment as he remembered the way he had wet his pants while playing with Sherlock that afternoon.  There had been no option for him within the moment to leave the game and listen to his own body’s needs instead of to Sherlock’s demands, something which fascinated the strong-willed and self-admittedly headstrong man.  There was a reason John sunk lower in age than Sherlock did during ageplay.  Given that he had always felt the burden of being the older brother, he enjoyed slipping low and letting others make most of his decisions.  But that afternoon he’d lost himself to the extent that he’d been unable to act of his own accord, which was a bit disconcerting.  The entire situation had been rather overwhelming, and had led to his teary cries for Daddy.
Sherlock was leaning over Bunny’s side of the bed a moment later, reaching a long arm down to pinch Bunny hard on the forearm where the sleeve of his nightgown had ridden up to expose skin.  The sudden jolt of pain had Bunny screaming and then sobbing, and he clamped a hand over the pinched skin and scurried under the bed to protect himself from Sherlock’s reaching fingers.
No warnings in this chapter except for some mentions of hungover John being nauseous if you're feeling squeamish.  We're not back to ageplay just yet--the boys have a bit to work through before they can allow themselves to slip back down into headspace, but hopefully they'll be on the way back to young after the next chapter.
“Bunny needs me to be his Daddy, Lock.  You can understand that because he feels it in the same way you feel the need for me to be your big brother,” he said.  “Would you want me to be Bunny’s big brother instead of his Daddy?”
“Listen to me, Lock,” he said, waiting until Sherlock turned his eyes away from Dimitri’s backplates and up to meet Mycroft’s gaze.  “That was a long time ago, far before I was ready to care for you properly.  We were both figuring it out as we went along, and I’m afraid I wasn’t the most patient teacher back then.”
He and John had been composed and competent for a month, had solved cases faster than even Sherlock himself had estimated, and all without so much as a pause for naptime.  He just wanted John and his plushies and to be told not to suck his thumb and for Mycroft to make decisions for him.
Greg laughed, downing his wine in a few gulps and reaching for the bottle to refill his glass as well as Mycroft’s.  Mycroft had finished drying the fruit and now began slicing it, teasingly threatening Greg with the knife when the man tried to steal a handful of washed grapes.
Lestrade had said he would let John take the lead, had said he just wanted John to be comfortable.  The case and subsequent stress of being little without Mycroft and Sherlock had pushed him lower in headspace than usual, and he was feeling particularly vulnerable.  Also, the last time he had seen Uncle Greg when he was little, they had gone to the zoo and John had wet his pants.  He hadn’t had any accidents since--he was still working out his thoughts about the issue--but he was suddenly frightened that he might.  And what would Uncle Greg think if he wet again?  He’d think he was a useless baby.
The words were not easy for Mycroft to say.  As much as he knew the dangers of Eurus, the idea of replacing her, the strain of having had to obliterate her from his associations with Sherlock, was trying.  He was not a man preoccupied with outwards shows of affection, but, somewhere, he did still care for Eurus.  Somewhere, he mourned the loss of their siblinghood.
The bathroom was a mess, discarded clothing draped on the floor.  Mycroft set John on the edge of the sink.  The kid balanced on his perch as he watched Mycroft stepped over the clothes on the floor to turn on the bath water.  Mycroft tested the temperature, and then begin to pick up the shirts and trousers scattered around the room.
Sherlock giggled and nodded, clearly pleased to have a secret to keep with his brother.  Mycroft helped him out of his t-shirt and into the bath when the water level was high enough, finding a few bath toys that had migrated from the hall loo, where the boys were usually bathed.  Sherlock settled in nicely, playing quietly as Mycroft washed and shampooed.
“He told me, sweetheart, and that wasn’t very nice of him,” Daddy said, guiding the nipple of the baby bottle away from Sherlock’s lips gently.  “Sherlock, can you apologize to your brother for being naughty?”
But he knew his voice was too quiet, throat tight as tears spilled onto his cheeks.  He was afraid of being too loud; it felt as if he were still within his dream, as if moments and figures were lurking.  There was something--or someone--camped out beneath his bed, a carry-over image still threatening.
Bunny stood shifting from foot to foot on the cold tiles of the lino, rubbing sleep from his eyes and waiting for Daddy to get a clean pull-up from beneath the sink cabinet.  But Daddy only took a seat on the closed-lid of the toilet and guided the boy by the wrists to step close until he was standing in front of him between his knees.
“You’ve earned a time-out for locking the door,” Papa said when he released Sherlock at last.  “And no more video games today.”
Sherlock hid it well, but Mycroft could see that drawing attention to his brother’s bladder had put the man on edge.  He hunched farther in his chair and began typing more rapidly on his phone.
Sherlock knew that when he was this little, Mycroft could usually be swayed when he put on what their mother used to call his puppy-dog face, all big eyes and pushed out lip.  Bunny seemed to catch on, and in a moment their faces were identical pictures of their cutest pleading.
Christmas Eve dinner was painless enough.  John was surrounded by so many vivacious, talkative members of Greg’s family that a few well-timed contributions to the conversations happening around him seemed to keep anyone from realizing that he was silent more often than not.  He did nearly cause a scene by choking on his chicken when he shifted attention from a conversation on his left regarding a hotly debated telly program to find Greg chatting with his brother about potty training.  But Greg’s hand found its way onto John’s knee beneath the table, steadying him, and John was able to calm his heart-stopping anxiety long enough to realize that they were just chatting about his brother’s youngest son, not about John and Sherlock.
“That he has,” John said, running a hand across his face.  “And yet, I already can’t wait to come home to the little bugger once my shift is finished.”
John nodded, and was unable to keep a bit of frustration from his voice when he next spoke.  “I gave him the new one,” John said, slicing tomatoes for sandwiches.  “Exactly the same.  But he said it didn’t feel right.  Then he threw it across the room, which is why he’s in time out.”
“Didn’t trust your own ability to weasel yourself out of this one?” Mycroft asked, smirking at the fully packed suitcase which sat beside the bureau in Sherlock’s bedroom.
Bunny took a moment to process Mycroft’s words, pressing his sniffling face into Mycroft’s shoulder.  After a moment, he pulled away, and, as he sniffed and rubbed his face across his forearm, he glanced up at Mycroft.
John shrugged, still unable to look up at Mycroft, cheeks blazing with embarrassment.  “Not the fact that it happened in public where everyone could see or the fact that Greg had to help me clean up when I just wanted you,” John paused, blushing at his admission of affection while not in headspace.
"You're John's daddy?" Sherlock asked, but his throat felt tight, and he already felt he knew was Uncle Greg was going to say.
To his credit, Bunny did not cry or whine.  He only nodded, as if he’d been prepared for the possibility of a spanking all along.
Mycroft reached forward to tickle John at the base of his neck beneath his left ear.  The boy squirmed where he sat, giggling as he involuntarily pressed his ear to his shoulder in an attempt to escape Mycroft’s wandering fingers.
“Can I get glitter stickers, Daddy?” he asked without thinking, not wanting to get his hopes up if there wasn’t the possibility for sparkle.
“I want you to wait right here, kiddo,” Greg said after helping Bunny wash his hands.  “Papa’s going to get some things from the car, okay?”
“I came to find you because dinner’s ready,” he said, breaking from the reverie.  “Think you can make it through?  I promise we can beg off right after.  Head to my brother’s where there’s a bit more peace and quiet.”
The adult part of him in the back of his mind began thinking maybe he should age up, that the only way to keep from being more of a bother would be to get big and take some time for himself to process his emotions.  He tried to pull himself out of the vulnerability and sadness swarming in his mind.  But the thought that he’d disappointed his Daddy in some way, that he’d let both Mycroft and Sherlock down, kept him needy and scared.
“...And then Sherlock realized it must be a female child involved,” John was saying, verbose in his chagrined state, “because you hadn’t been hesitant in the past to have him associate with women while--”
John had almost forgotten about the weather in the midst of the night’s chaos.  The rain had not let up since Sherlock had burst in dripping from rainwater earlier that evening, and indeed, a flash of lightning lit up the sky as John glanced out the windows across the living room.  Sherlock squeaked and hugged Mycroft closely when the thunder struck.  John couldn’t help but notice he also plunged a hand down between his legs, not unlike earlier that day, before he had wet himself.
“Let’s snuggle in the living room a bit, love bug,” Daddy was saying over him, his voice soft and assuring as he helped Bunny up off the floor by a hand because he was still carrying Sherlock.
“And I seem to remember sending a certain someone to the zoo in pull-ups today because of all of his accidents this week.”
This chapter was tricky for me to write, but I think I'm okay with the results! :)  A bit of angst on Sherlock's part, but mostly just cute fluff as Mycroft (and then Greg) show up to care for their boys.
Greg wouldn’t have had it any other way.  After the ordeals of the morning, there was nothing he wanted more than to know that Sherlock and John were safe in his arms, comfortable and cared-for, if only for the moment.
Trying to make himself inconspicuous was a rather unfamiliar goal for Sherlock.  Usually, getting away with mischief made him self-assured and proud.  He loved a good challenge, and sneaking bad behavior past Mycroft and Papa--men who were professionally trained to detect just that--had always been thrilling.  Acting out brought him attention, but, more than that, playing tricks on Bunny and finding loopholes in the rules Papa or Mycroft set allowed him to feel clever and in control.  At the moment, however, his appreciation for any art of deception was dampened by waves of shame.   He couldn’t take pride in being successfully sneaky because he couldn’t feel pride in himself.  Lying to Papa and Mycroft right now wasn’t about bolstering his ego; it was about preserving it.
“Are you okay?  What happened?” Greg asked, and then, when his fear was replaced by a touch of anger when the kid only shrugged and continued to look at the toys on the shelves: “What do we say about wandering off?  I was worried sick.”
Despite his police-officer toughness, Greg had brought a gentleness to Mycroft’s life that he had never felt before.  Here was comfort and understanding, a space within which to show another human being his true self.
The night before he had been constantly woken up by Sherlock’s coughing or his own sore throat--both before and after he’d been shoved from the bed and had taken refuge beneath it.  Each time, it had taken him long minutes to fall back asleep, his waking mind consistently drifting to the questions and doubts he’d been contemplating since he’d mumbled to his Papa--who had come to give him medicine in the middle of the night--that he wasn’t a boy.
Greg crossed to Mycroft once more, and this time the man sighed as he allowed himself to be pulled back against Greg’s chest, allowed Greg’s arms to tighten around him and Greg’s chin to rest on his shoulder as he came up behind him.
The relief of that realization and the thought that Mycroft had been observing him had the unexpected effect of causing him to slip down in headspace for a moment.  He was surprised to feel tears welling in his eyes.  He wished Mycroft could be with him.  He didn’t want Lestrade, especially when Sherlock was away.  He’d never been alone with Uncle Greg while little.  What if Lestrade was only begrudgingly following Sherlock or Mycroft’s orders to watch over him for the night?  He couldn’t bear it if that were the case; he would rather be alone.
“Don’t need them,” Sherlock insisted, pulling out a pair of his cartoon dinosaur briefs and beginning to yank off his boxer briefs.  “I’m a big boy.”
Greg and Mycroft were walking back to the car, clearly having decided on a plan of action.  They opened the door on Sherlock’s side of the car, where both boys were now huddled.
“Hey there, Lock.  Who’s your new friend?” Mycroft asked, pulling Sherlock onto his lap.  “Did you have a good time with Uncle Greg and John at the zoo?”
And then he was alone, collapsed on the bed and willing his heart rate to stop racing.  There was no telling how long he would be trapped with his own thoughts, no telling how long it might be before the room would be lightened by sunrise.  But at least he was behind closed doors; at least his weakness was hidden.
Mycroft set the completed charcuterie board in front of Greg and eased himself back into the second bar stool.  The ordeals of the day behind them, they teased each other through some good-old-fashioned flirting while they ate far more cheese and pepperoni than was good for them, then retreated with the half-empty bottle of wine to the living room, where Greg lounged with his feet in Mycroft’s lap.
Sherlock liked the way the wet diaper hung heavy on his hips.  If he’d been wearing one of the boring bedwetter pull-ups, it would already have leaked onto the sheets.  But the diapers Mycroft made Sherlock wear when he was too young to use the potty could usually handle more than one wetting.  Checking once more that Papa was still asleep, Sherlock sat back on his heels and spread his legs, stifling a giggle at the prospect of purposely wetting himself.
Dinner and its clean-up had run later than usual given the events leading up to it, but Greg had convinced Mycroft that a little more screen time for the day wouldn’t be the worst digression from his established rules, even if it did extend bedtime by a few minutes, citing the stress of the day and the appeal of a quiet, calming movie night for the kiddos before bedtime.  Bunny had cheered when Mycroft agreed, and he immediately complied when asked to get ready for the movie by cleaning his teeth and putting on some pajamas, racing out of the kitchen with a nodding smile.
This chapter is a bit different from previous ones because it does explore the sexual relationship between Sherlock and John, but it felt necessary given some of the issues they're still working through after Weekend.  Hope you like it!
He found himself blinking at Bunny as she explained that they were going to “play house,” his mouth gaping as he attempted to put into words the confusion he was feeling.  This wasn’t the Bunny he knew, the Bunny who let him pick the games and was always less coordinated at coloring than he was.  This wasn’t his shy and easy-going little brother, unlikely to push back against Sherlock’s ideas.
Sherlock, after a moment of what seemed to be still shock, gave in with a sigh and began rutting against the pressure.  John felt his own arousal building, heart beating in his throat and suddenly very conscious of the still-dry padding between his own legs.  He yanked at the waist of Sherlock’s pajama pants to get his hand inside.  There was an intimacy to having his hand directly on his boyfriend’s sodden pull-up, one which Sherlock clearly enjoyed.
“I won’t pretend I fully understand it,” she said, holding up a gentle hand to keep Greg from interrupting.  “But I'd like to learn more.  And if it’s something that makes you both happy, I’m glad you’ve found each other.”
“You come?” John asked after he had stepped into the underwear and then a pair of trousers, peeking up at Mycroft.  There was no doubt that little John was rather attached to Mycroft, that he truly only felt safe in Mycroft’s care.  Poor Lestrade, who the boys had long known was more than an acquaintance to Mycroft despite the appearance the men gave off in public, had been through quite a few difficult nights babysitting when Mycroft was called away for work, nights filled with a teary and frightened John only made better by the excitement Sherlock showed when Lestrade came to watch them; Sherlock was always cheekily on his best behavior when Lestrade cared for them, behavior which far surpassed even Sherlock’s least difficult days with Mycroft or an adult John.
“Movie night?” Sherlock asked, leaping up to kneel on his chair.  “Can we watch Pirates of the Caribbean, Uncle Greg?”
The days following Victor’s disappearance had been some of the darkest of Mycroft’s young life, certainly the darkest of young Sherlock’s.  There were nightmares and tearful breakdowns and, when it became clear Victor was not coming back, a span of weeks where Sherlock did not speak or sleep and had to be forced to eat.  Even if Sherlock had not yet come to realize that Redbeard was no more a dog than Eurus was a neighbor girl, the residual darkness would be hard to escape.
Mycroft was not pleased to hear that Greg had already agreed to bring John to work with him, citing the doctor’s nearly sleepless night and undoubtedly frayed nerves as reasons he found the decision irresponsible and reckless.
His eyes remained on the screen, but, unable to let go of his two-handed grip on the controller when he felt his desperation increase, he was forced to contort his body to bring the controller onto his lap, pressing it down between his crossing legs.  He was desperate, frantic to keep himself from letting go all in his pants.  He heart was pounding.  He didn’t want to wet his pants, but he could feel his control slipping.  He needed to finish the level quickly, then make a run for the loo.
“William Sherlock Scott,” Papa said, voice serious where it had been previously lighthearted.  “We do not hit and we do not kick.”
“Uncle Greg needs a bit of a break,” he said, placing his hands against his lower back as he stretched against the tightness there.  “I’m going to go help Grandma get dessert ready.”
“Say goodbye to the lake house until next time, babies,” Mycroft prompted from the driver’s seat, having promised to do the first shift of driving until they stopped for dinner.
“You know that if I'm being completely honest with myself, I'm more than okay with this,” John said when he knew he and Mycroft were less likely to be disturbed, “I haven't worn one since the morning after Greg babysat, and I have a vague memory of admitting that pull-ups intrigued me to Sherlock last night when we were drunk.  His recollection of it is clearly less hazy than mine.”
“What is it, Mycroft?” he asked, turning with effort, as if it were some great hardship to share his brother’s company.  Which, given that Mycroft’s concerned presence had been reminding Sherlock of what it was like to be small and looked after all day, it was.
He was not surprised that Bunny had wet himself over the course of the morning.  The boy hadn’t wanted to be out of Sherlock’s sight for a moment, sticking so close that Sherlock had begun to shrug him away when he tried to sit immediately next to him, shoulder to shoulder.
“Just in case,” Greg said, glancing back and forth between the two men as he seemed to now be fully aware of the tension between them.
It had been Sherlock himself who had let Greg in on the brothers’ secret, albeit unintentionally, roughly three weeks after John had learned of the arrangement.  Sherlock had called Mycroft’s home phone while in headspace, and Greg had answered.  Luckily, the Detective Inspector had taken it in stride.
Mycroft’s presence and his permission for Sherlock to suck his thumb helped a bit, but Sherlock had slept fitfully, and the vulnerable feeling persisted into the early morning hours, when he was woken by Mycroft far too early, thighs cold and wet.
Bunny clambered over Sherlock’s legs to leave the car, and the boys got tangled in a mess of limbs for a moment before Greg reached and yanked Bunny from the car by his armpits, smiling.  He coaxed the pacifier out from between Bunny's lips and slipped it into his pocket.  Bunny looked distressed for a moment, but Greg took his hand and told him he could have it back as well as his lion right after they used the loo and got some food.
It was nearing half six, and Mycroft knew the boys would be hungry for dinner soon enough, so he set the oven to preheat and began pulling out the ingredients for rosemary chicken.  Greg returned a few moments later with a smiling Bunny, supervised the boy as he very proudly chose a new sticker for his chart, and sent the boy back off to watch cartoons.  He returned to his puzzle, ignoring Mycroft’s chiding that he would never finish before they needed to sit down to eat by waving him off and continuing to search for the correctly matching pieces.
“No, Daddy,” he whined, feeling just as frustrated as he was sad.  He didn't want his Daddy to touch the tender spot on his skin.  He stomped a foot in irritation even as he blinked back tears.
John shook his head as if he could deny it away, but his cheeks were red and the smell of urine which had pulsed into his pants and underwear was sure to have reached Lestrade.
“Choose, ‘Lockie!” Bunny said, spreading the sticker sheets before Sherlock on the table and beginning to list the different types.  “You used the loo so you get to pick your favorite!”
This chapter is a bit shorter than usual, but allowed me to explore the stubbornness of both Sherlock and John during their respective mornings.  The boys are certainly not making Mycroft or Greg's lives easy, lately, but cutesy, comforting fluff is always so much more satisfying after some angst and drama, don't you think?  I've already started the next chapter (Sherlock's portion is written, so now I'll just need to work on John's), so I'm hopeful it won't be another eon before the next chapter is posted!  Feel free to send suggestions--I'm feeling a bit out of my depth as I go about writing John and Greg at a crime scene, so they would be very much welcomed!
“Not a problem,” Greg said, smiling in encouragement.  “Would you like to be Papa and Daddy’s princess tonight?”
“Big boy undies,” John said, and when Mycroft looked skeptical, he begged.  "Please, Daddy," he said.
The praise sunk John into whimpering submission as he let out a cry of distress that was just as much a cry of pleasure, and urine streamed hard and fast against Sherlock’s thigh as John lost control.
As a result, I've unfortunately thrown you all back into angst by the end of this chapter.  I've given you some cute baby Sherlock in the middle to hopefully make you smile, but I'm afraid Bunny's day is going to end with just as much difficultly as it began.  Hopefully all will be resolved soon!
There was a part of John which thought about waking Mycroft and asking him to talk through the doubts and confusion roaming around his mind regarding this desire to lose control, to sink lower.  But he knew already what Mycroft would tell him, could imagine the man’s words from the first night John had called him Daddy, the night Greg had babysat and John had wet himself on the couch: it’s fine.  It’s all fine.  And, for the first time, John could see himself believing that this was true.  If he wanted to wet his pants when he was Bunny, if he had desires only half-formed in his mind about being potty trained and taken by his Daddy to use the loo because it would help him feel less in control and thus less adult, what did it matter?  He wasn’t hurting anyone, and Mycroft and Greg were more than understanding.
“Let me try to explain it another way,” Mycroft said, and he was glad that, at the moment, Sherlock was proving patient.  “How old do you feel right now?”
“I never knew,” John said, unsure which of the many details he was referring to, but Mycroft only nodded.
“We’ll talk about this later,” Mycroft said, in a tone of voice that hinted at caregiver but then quickly shifted back to the task at hand.  “For now, go change.  I need to talk to Sherlock.”
Neither Sherlock nor the Bunny wanted the actual cone from their ice cream, so Bunny passed it up to Mycroft, who handed it off to Greg to eat while he drove.  Sherlock leaned against the window, and, tired now that he had allowed himself to take stock of his mental and physical states, did not refuse when the Bunny passed him the alligator plush.
Sherlock could see that John was typing, but then he seemed to think better of it, and stopped.  Sherlock set the mobile in his lap, trying to ignore the nagging feeling in his chest which signalled that he wanted John at his side, big or small.
“Okay, My,” Sherlock called after a moment, drawing out his vowels like the petulant child he was.  “One more hour.”
“Perfect idea,” Papa said, and then bent down to kiss Sherlock’s forehead before holding out his hand and leading a rather worried Bunny towards the foyer to help him with his shoes.
“What do you think you're doing?” Anderson asked as he pushed John off to step away.  “Get away from me!”
Sherlock found the puzzle piece’s rightful spot and fit it into the partially-completed puzzle with a satisfied hum.  He could feel Mycroft's eyes on him.  His brother had been sitting still in his chair, waiting for Sherlock to focus on the matter at hand.
He ran a hand over his eyes as he fell back against the pillow.  They were just dreams.  Even his childhood nightmares of monsters and goblins had been easier to get over than the dreams spurred on by his PTSD.  Why did they have to make him feel so shaken, so frightened?  Why did they always make him long to be little?
The noise Sherlock was making was enough to cause Bunny to cover his ears and Daddy to flip off the telly entirely.
Nothing had gone right today, and his luck hadn’t changed.  He couldn’t win at video games and he couldn’t ask for Papa or Mycroft to come up to the room to help him figure out what was wrong and he couldn’t keep his mind from wandering to the poster board chart with his name on it, a chart which reminded him far too much of his youngest years.
Bunny’s eyes were round when they shifted to meet Greg’s gaze, questioning but, if Greg was reading his boy correctly, hopeful.
Sherlock whined but allowed himself to be lifted into a sitting position.  Greg coaxed the boy’s thumb from his mouth and held up the dosage cup of cough medicine, which Sherlock sipped in his sleepiness but then spluttered and cried about when he realized what he was taking and Greg made him swallow it down.
Greg couldn’t help but chuckle.  The kid’s body language had changed, already more confident now that she’d been affirmed as the gender she was currently feeling.  They had yet to fully get to know Bunny’s female side, but Greg had a feeling he was going to like this sassier, self-assured side of their littlest very much.
He let the kid cry as long as he needed to, providing assurances that everything was okay, and eventually the boy’s tears had died down to sniffles.  Bunny looked up at Mycroft as he knuckled at red-rimmed eyes, having tuckered himself out.
The attic was little more than a large crawl space--the roof was peaked and the walls very short; Sherlock had to duck when he wasn’t standing directly in the middle of the space.  For this reason, the boys climbed around on their hands and knees, yanking on the handles of the old steamer trunk Uncle Greg had left open, elaborate fabrics spilling over the edges, as they pulled it to the middle of the room.
Mycroft lifted Sherlock from the bed and carried him through the doorway leading to Bunny’s room, where he sat in a rocking chair which had been placed in the corner.  Sherlock whined, arguing against being rocked like a baby, but Mycroft had a tight grip on him, and soon Sherlock was pressed against his brother’s chest as he rocked them back and forth again and again.
A look passed between Sherlock and John that Mycroft could not read.  But it was clear the men were both thinking of something said between the two of them in the past, that Sherlock was silently referencing an understanding between the two.  Had John spoken with Sherlock as candidly about his affinity for wetting as he had with Mycroft? Did Sherlock know that John had actually liked wetting his pants at the zoo or that he'd wet himself while alone with Greg the night after their case in Scotland? That he had been processing his feelings about the accidents since they had happened and admitted to Mycroft that he wanted to wet more often?
“What do you say about keeping your big brother company for the rest of the night?” Greg asked as Bunny dozed on his shoulder.
Sherlock knew that Greg was just as saddened by Sherlock hurting himself as Mycroft and John would be, but somehow Papa never let him feel as if he took it personally when Sherlock hurt himself.  He reacted almost just as if Sherlock had wet his pants or spilled his juice, dealing with the issue logically, step-by-step until the problem was handled.  It was why Sherlock had called him, why he had been so desperate for his help.
“Don’t need one,” Bunny said absently, intent on tracing the events of the film as Scrooge was taken into his past.
“Then you’ll be a boy tomorrow,” Mycroft shrugged, smiling.  “You can be just want you’d like to be, honey bun.”
Mycroft paused.  It was true Sherlock currently had a sister napping upstairs, not a brother, but the prospect of telling that to his younger brother suddenly caused a pit in his stomach.  His body stilled, and the smile was quickly dropped from his face.
“Exactly, love.  We need to make sure we prepare him in the right way for the big announcement, and Daddy needs some time to do that.  Do you understand?”
Bunny had been gathered up in Daddy’s arms and comforted as she cried over the nasty words from Sherlock, Papa stroking her back as Daddy shushed her and told her it would all be okay.  She felt insecure and pained and hesitant to remain a little girl, but it had been a hard few days, and it felt like a lot of work to shift into being a boy at the moment.
“Sherlock!” Uncle Greg said, shock in his voice.  Bunny felt Mycroft shake his head, could picture the look of disappointment on his Daddy’s face even as he kept his eyes pressed into Mycroft’s neck.
“I’m sorry!” Bunny cried, trying to scramble closer into Mycroft’s hold, pressing his face against his neck.  “I didn’t mean to!”
“We’ll talk about this later.  Let’s go,” he said, taking Bunny by the hand and beginning to guide them towards the checkout lanes.
The doctor nodded again and looked down at the floorboards.  John seemed to consciously not be making eye contact with Mycroft.
“Drawing a hurricane there, sport?” he asked with a smirk, and Bunny dissolved into another of her snorting fits of giggling.
Yes, John had quite bashfully discussed with Greg and Mycroft his desire to explore aspects of potty training, interested in the structure and inevitable praise and attention that would come from such a practice as well as the chance to slip a bit deeper into headspace.  But he hadn’t expected the information to be passed along to Sherlock, and he certainly hadn’t expected Sherlock to bring up the prospect while they were both fully adult.
“Sherlock, sit up for a moment, bud,” Mycroft said as he settled Sherlock onto the bed and unwrapped him from his blanket cocoon.  “I have some new jammies for you.”
"I felt as if I’d failed him," Mycroft admitted. "He’d called me before and I’d been frustrated with him, short.  I insisted he continue to stick it out, told him he’d never make it in the world if he dropped out of university. But, when I arrived, it was clear he was in no state to stay, that this was something far more than homesickness.  I arranged for him to be unenrolled, and I brought him home.”
He’d known Eurus was likely to come to light at some point.  The deeper Sherlock fell into the web of criminal activities, the greater the likelihood became that a crime would trigger his memory of their sister’s cruelty or bring him into contact with Sherringford.  And if it were not crime-solving that had the highest likelihood of setting Sherlock’s memory stirring, it was ageplaying.  As his baseline eight or nine years, little Sherlock was free of the memories of Eurus, who had been safely tucked away just before that point in his life.  But as Sherlock began to spend more and more time in his youngest headspaces, opportunities arose for him to recall memories from when he was biologically young enough to remember Eurus’s particular strain of inhumanity.
He was feeling smaller than he had all day, and all he wanted to do was curl up in bed with Dimitri and his pacifier and hide under the blankets.  But he had to get rid of the evidence before Mycroft or Papa came to check up on him or sent Bunny to call him for lunch.  He stood--shuddering when dribbles of liquid pulsed down his legs--peeled off his soaked socks to keep from spreading his mess, and crept to the door, which he opened slowly.  He peered into the hallway, checking that the others were still downstairs.
“He made his own decisions today, love.” Greg turned to look Mycroft in the eye.  “I was angry and took my anger out on you earlier, but that was wasn't right.  You had conflicting obligations and prioritized one over the other.  It was a mistake, but that doesn’t mean you’re responsible for the action Sherlock took.”
“He’s also spilled his breakfast on his shirt and hasn’t let me take it off to put it in the wash, which has added another five minutes to his time out.”
He felt much better now that he was dry, but there was still the issue of the wet clothes and the stain on the carpet in the guest bedroom.  He couldn’t throw them into the hamper; Mycroft or Papa would be sure to find them.  He couldn’t bring them to the washing machine; it was in the downstairs bathroom and he would have to walk past the others.  He had to hide them somewhere no one would be likely to look.  He gathered up his wet things, careful not to press any wet sections against his chest as he moved the chair blocking his door and crept back out into the hallway and down to the guest room.
“Not everyone appreciates the banality of Christmas festivities, Gregory,” Mycroft said.  “It’s an insidious practice that feeds capitalism and perpetuates the myth of the nuclear family.”
What was worse, the noise from the interaction must have woken Mycroft and John, for they were soon beside Greg in the hallway, John--wide-eyed with a nervous energy most likely brought on by an abrupt wake-up and memories of Sherlock’s monster stories--on Mycroft’s hip.
Mycroft had placed himself behind the desk on the far side of the living room, knowing he had correspondence to answer and potential political headaches to keep from coming to fruition.  As much as he would have liked to take off the entire day to care for the boys, he hadn’t properly planned for the boys to be young at the moment, and there were a few loose ends he needed to take care of in order to prepare for the possibility of extended time with them young.
“Instead of asking questions or telling someone you were feeling overwhelmed, you took out your frustration on others, and that’s never okay.”
“‘Lock, we’ve talked about this,” Mycroft began, shifting to look him in the eye.  “Some families don’t follow the rules, and that’s okay.”
“My brother has a habit of professing himself immune to emotional resonance,” Mycroft said, folding his hands on the desk in front of him.  “In reality, his proclamations of sociopathy are nothing more than carefully crafted walls of a facade set in place for self-preservation.”
Sherlock felt as if he had missed something, the prickling of his adult mind berating him for not deducing the shift in Mycroft and John's relationship himself.
There was some sadness and whininess on the part of both boys.  Neither one of them was particularly happy to have been woken from his nap and both were rather distressed when they learned they were leaving the lake house where they had spent the weekend.  Greg found himself helping two tearful boys into clean pull-ups for the car ride.  Luckily, they were boy sleepy and young enough that they were compliant, so he simply gave them both their plush animals, pushed their pacifiers into their mouths, and led each boy by a hand to the car, where he kissed them on the forehead as he buckled them into the back seat.
Hi lovelies! You're all the best, and your comments definitely inspired me to get this chapter finished sooner than planned!  I don't like leaving the boys (and all of you) without resolution!
“I’ll make breakfast,” Greg said.  It sounded rather pathetic, especially given that it was 3:15 in the morning, but Mycroft looked relieved.  Greg had known the man would prefer to have time alone with his brother.  “Yell if you need anything,” Greg said, kissing Mycroft on the cheek.
The kid was wringing the corner of his blanket in his hand, nervously glancing back and forth between the floorboards and Greg.
Sherlock, after a few futile attempts to stop the flow, resolved himself to the fact that he was wetting himself, and simply waited for the worst of it to be over, adding it to the long list of actions he would be punished for that morning.  He was a saturated mess of tears and urine by the time Mycroft opened the closet door to stare down at him, angry and so, so disappointed.
“D.I. Lestrade,” he said, distracted by the fact that he’d burned a fingertip on the pan as he slid the omelet onto the plate.  He grimaced and, holding the mobile to his ear with his raised shoulder, ran his fingers under cold tap water.
“It certainly doesn't appear that way from the state of your trousers,” John could not help but tease.  Mycroft knew John had been dealing with a misbehaving Sherlock all night.  The man had refused to settle down to sleep, had whined and cried when John tried to leave him, and had poked John awake, laughing and taking off running around the flat, whenever John had happened to fall asleep himself.
“That’s a good boy,” Mycroft said, taking the kitchen timer John held out to him and setting it for five minutes.  “Time can start now.”
“Okay, Papa,” Bunny mumbled, his eyes half-lidded as he let himself slump down until his head was resting against the armrest of the door.  “But I’m not a baby.”
They sat in comfortable silence, John feeling himself dozing, content in the shared warmth of Sherlock’s bed as he watched the stars from the rotating night light move slowly along the ceiling.  Eventually, they shifted beneath the sheets and blankets, John pressing himself against Sherlock’s back, spooning him.  His face was pressed against the back of Sherlock’s neck, and the man’s curls smelled like the baby shampoo Greg used on them when they were small.  John let his hands lazily wander, hoping to soothe his insomniac boyfriend into a semblance of relaxation.
Once John was settled into the tub, pushing bath toys down into the water to watch them float back up to the surface, Mycroft turned to help Sherlock undress.  Generally, the boy liked to undress himself, but that afternoon he stubbornly refused to undress without Mycroft’s help, obviously feeling either left out of the attention John had received that day due to his accident or still upset over what he viewed to be the unfairness of his recent time-out.  He stood fiddling with a plastic shark bath toy, making no attempt to undress himself.  When Mycroft guided him by the hips closer to where he kneeled, Sherlock glanced down with a sigh.  Mycroft unbuttoned Sherlock’s trousers and revealed a very wet pull-up.  He said nothing, because Sherlock was very clearly waiting for his reaction and Mycroft did not want to throw the boy into a fit.  Luckily, John was absorbed with the bath toys and did not seem attuned to what was happening next to him.  John would never tease, but if Sherlock even thought John looked at him strangely after an accident, he would strop and complain.
“Wanted you,” Sherlock said at last, nuzzling his face into Mycroft’s thigh.  “Papa said you would be here in the morning, but you were with Bunny still.”
And then Papa was walking down the hallway, and Bunny heard the front door close behind him.  He squeezed his eyes closed, trying not to admit to himself that he felt more alone than ever now that the one person he felt he could confess that morning’s confusing thoughts to had left.  He wished Papa had talked to Daddy, or even that Sherlock was old enough to deduce that there was more on Bunny’s mind than his sore throat.
“Redbeard was a dog, love,” John said, tipping his head towards Sherlock and smiling at him in an attempt to comfort.  “Just a lovely dog.”
“Good thing we decided to check up on them,” Greg said, voice low as he placed his bag on John’s armchair and took in the messy room.  “They know better than to keep themselves isolated when they’re young.”
Mycroft and Greg managed to get Bunny out of the flat without too much fuss, Greg shouldering the bag Mycroft packed with Bunny’s things as Mycroft calmed some slight whining from an overtired Bunny who didn’t like the idea of being without either his Daddy or his Papa and then convinced Sherlock to come give his little brother the goodnight kiss he was asking for.  He closed the door behind them as Bunny was carried down the staircase by Greg, the almost-forgotten baby blanket draped around Greg's neck and the stuffed rabbit tucked between Bunny's chin and Greg's chest.
Sherlock sat rocking back and forth on the creaking mattress of the lake house bedroom.  He knew he should get up to use the loo.  After all, he had woken up in time.  He could hold it long enough to make it to the bathroom without an accident.
It was on what felt like his twentieth try of the same level that he first felt a dribble of pee trickle into his underwear.  But he’d made it through the quicksand and was onto the swinging vines, which he’d never managed to get to in his past attempts, and there was no way he was going to pause now.  He tightened his muscles, squirmed against the carpeted floor, and shifted his hips, ignoring the desperate signals his bladder was sending as he leaned closer to the telly, excited and a bit breathless as he managed to make it past the vines.
Mycroft had rearranged his schedule after receiving a call from John the night before, who was concerned that Sherlock would not be aged up in time to be left alone while John went to his scheduled shift at the surgery.  He had spoken to John for a few moments after Sherlock had been put to bed, and although John mentioned that Sherlock, before sinking down into headspace the previous day, had assured the man he would be back to his adult state by Tuesday afternoon, Mycroft agreed with John’s assessment that, based on the behaviors he had been seeing, Sherlock would need a few more days in headspace before he was ready to tackle adulthood again.  It was more than likely that Sherlock’s misbehavior that day stemmed from his inability to age up on the timeline he had promised.
Early morning light was streaming through the slits in the curtains when John woke.  He blinked a few times as he attempted to come out of sleep and back to consciousness.  He yanked the baby blanket out from under his back, where it had bunched uncomfortably beneath him, and he pulled the pacifier out from where it had lodged beneath his neck when it had fallen out of his mouth.
Let me know if you have any suggestions for future chapters--I have a few from all of you that I'm still planning to add in when I can!
“Idiotic woman,” Sherlock muttered to himself, his phone's touchscreen keyboard clicking.  “Clearly the butcher’s son doesn’t have the resources or wherewithal to be carrying on an operation of that sort!”
It was clear that John was in the final stages of aging down, that he’d at long last lost the ability to put on a brave face of maturity.
“Well, Daddy,” Papa said as he and Bunny approached from down the hallway, “this big boy has earned a sticker for his training chart!”
It was an hour after the boys had gone down for the night, and Mycroft set out two highball glasses and the bottle of bourbon.  He assumed he would be having another late night conversation with John, who Mycroft knew would need help processing the events of the day.
“You’re doing well,” Mycroft said, encouraging the boy, rubbing a hand up and down his back.  “Thank you for being honest.”
Now, awake in the middle of the night, John felt drained, as if the sleep he’d gotten since they’d come to bed had not been very deep or particularly effective.  Scattered images from the dream he’d woken from plagued his mind, blood from gunshot wounds and muddy, disorganized battlefields still presiding in the space before him.
Greg placed the dosage of medication on the bedside table and flipped on the light beside the bed.  Unfortunately, his elbow caught against the medicine cup he had just rested on the corner of the table, and he spilled the liquid pain medication onto the hardwood floor of the bedroom, just missing the rug placed beside Bunny’s bed.
“Just a little accident,” Mycroft said, guiding Bunny to step out of the puddle of urine and then holding Bunny’s head as he laid it against his chest.
The floorboards squeaked as he shifted in place on the top step.  He paused, praying he hadn’t been heard, but Papa’s brother had paused mid-sentence, which silenced Papa’s laughter.
Mycroft raised his eyebrows at Sherlock, who seemed to know the look his brother gave him.  With wide eyes, Sherlcok whispered, “loo, please.”  Mycroft lifted Sherlock onto his hip once more and carried his brother to the bathroom off the kitchen.
“Oh honey, I’m not sorry at all,” Papa said, hugging Bunny close and pressing the pacifier he had caught back into Bunny’s mouth.  “I’m just sorry you felt you had to wait so long to tell us.  I need you to know that I love you no matter what, boy or girl or otherwise.  Understand?”
“Sherlock n-needed me to be b-big,” Bunny was saying.  “But--but I couldn’t s-sleep, and I--then I felt so l-little and--but I wasn’t supposed t-to!”
“Do you want to tell me what’s been going on today, kiddo?” Mycroft asked, pulling the desk chair aside and crouching in front of the boy.
When an hour and a half had passed and the next train let off eager riders who were quickly ushered into another string of waiting cars, John called Harry for the third time, and again received no answer.  He should have let precedent guide him and asked Harry to send along her new address; at least then he could have found a cab instead of waiting, helplessly.
It was with relief that he placed his key into the lock of 221b Baker Street and dragged himself up the staircase to the flat.  He walked carefully, then stumbled on the top step and had to reach out to clasp the bannister in order to steady himself.  He paused, hoping the noise hadn’t drawn the attention of Mrs. Hudson.  He had definitely had one too many.
“Fuck it,” he mumbled to himself, reaching for the comfort of Willa before standing from the bed and crossing to the closed bedroom door.
And when John, snuggled up with Sherlock, happened to relax enough to find himself giving back into his Bunny headspace, he didn’t fight the impulse, scurrying down under the covers when Sherlock suggested they hide out like the bandits in the story and adding on to Sherlock’s made-up stories with plotlines of her own.  The actual text of each storybook was left unread as they turned through page after page embellished by their own imaginations, snorting in laughter until Daddy and Papa found them, made them use the potty and wash their hands, and sat them all down for lunch as a family, the kids insisting that Willa the rabbit and Dimitri the dinosaur get plates of their own and already negotiating with Papa and Daddy over the number of bites of green beans they would have to eat in order for Papa to build them a blanket fort and Daddy to let them watch a movie.
“Sherlock will come around, ladybug,” Daddy said.  “He said some nasty, hurtful words, but he loves you very much.  He may need a bit more time to process this new change, and his actions were wrong in every way.  But he would never intentionally hurt you.”
This is the bedtime chapter, and it's from little John's perspective, but the next is from little Sherlock's.  I know a lot of you have been waiting for some more little 'Lock, so I'll upload that today, too, since it's already written.  This chapter references the chat Mycroft and John have in "Uncle Greg and Little John" when Mycroft comes home after John has wet himself and first called Mycroft "Daddy," but that chat isn't uploaded to that story yet (it should be soon).  Even so, it shouldn't be confusing without that context.  For some reason I was inspired to continue this guy first, and next I'll get back to Uncle Greg and Little John.  Thanks for bearing with me and my random inspirations!
Bunny nodded and hurried into the bathroom while Uncle Greg lay Sherlock on the end of the bed and pulled down his pants.  He reached over Sherlock’s head for the stuffed dinosaur Sherlock had gone to sleep hugging, and placed it into his arms.  Sherlock was so busy asking his dinosaur what he’d missed while he napped and what they should do with the rest of the afternoon that he barely noticed Uncle Greg changing his diaper and wiping him down.  It was only as Uncle Greg was taping him into a new diaper that he got impatient, and Uncle Greg had to hold him down to fasten the tapes at his hips and to keep him from wiggling away.
John nodded, not minding Greg’s pet name despite the fact that he was aged up; Greg had always been rather paternal when it came to John and Sherlock.  They shared an amused grin over Mycroft’s current breed of mother-henning before John left the living room and made his way to Sherlock’s bedroom.
Just three days ago, Sherlock he had wet himself at the kitchen table while attempting to determine the chemical compound in a soil sample.  John had been preparing dinner, and when he heard the sound of liquid pattering against the linoleum he turned to find a red-faced Sherlock mumbling too quickly for John to decipher as he backed away from the kitchen and retreated to his bedroom.
John hadn’t even known he’d had to go until that moment, and he’d already partially wet himself.  When had it happened?  He had gone to the loo only a few hours ago, at the rest stop.  The fact that he had started to wet himself sometime between then and now without realizing it made his chest clench and his head pound with a panicky fear.  This was not like the times he had known he was going to wet himself, like at the zoo, or the times he had chosen to wet himself, like the night with Greg or the morning after with Mycroft.  He had wet himself without realizing it, and that was something he had not experienced since childhood.  He wanted to hold himself, wanted to tell Mycroft he needed the loo or he was going to soak his pants as well as the pull-up, but he couldn’t speak.
He typed furiously, only stopping for short moments while his eyes scanned the forums.  He’d been manic for nearly the entirety of the last hour and a half, insisting every ten minutes that John check the blog and newspapers for potential cases, suggesting some rather nasty words be sent to Lestrade when he replied to John’s texts that there was nothing pressing at Scotland Yard.
John turned off the telly and grabbed his coat, following Sherlock out of the flat and over to their neighborhood pub
Sherlock did not respond, either not having registered John’s question or deliberately choosing to ignore him.  He was draped in the chair, legs thrown over one arm and head tilted back against the other, staring up at his mobile and twitching a foot restlessly.
They’d been so busy getting the kids inside and settled down into headspace that they’d had very little time to acknowledge each other.  Greg had been looking forward to spending the evening with the boys, of course, but he’d been longing for the companionship of Mycroft in a different, more reassuring, way.  It was always a comfort to know he wasn’t alone.
A fitful Sherlock had taken more than half an hour to be put to bed, but the man was finally asleep on the couch beneath an extra blanket and pillows from the bed John had made during the process of tidying Sherlock’s clutter; John had been unable to wait idly while Mycroft bathed Sherlock, and so had taken to cleaning the consulting detective’s disaster of a bedroom.  He bundled clothing into the laundry basket and passed it to Mycroft, who listened for Sherlock babbling to himself in the bathtub while he started a load of laundry which included the trousers and boxer briefs Sherlock had wet in earlier.  The apartment sounded of running water and books thumping back into their place on bookshelves.  John tapped papers into stacks where he rested them on Sherlock’s desk and untacked news clippings and images of the recently solved murder case from the living room walls, knowing the man was in no state to be reminded of the gruesome nature of the serial killer’s plans.
Here's the little Sherlock some of you have been waiting for.  Unfortunately he's struggling with some tough situations in this one, but all will get better for him, soon!
Lestrade did not seem taken aback.  In fact, he smiled and nodded.  Perhaps another scenario Mycroft had pre-empted by explaining to Greg that it might be something John would need?
Mycroft allowed the boy to slide from his knees, but he followed, crouching beside him on the floor to pull him into his arms.
“Breathe, sweetheart,” Greg said, reaching to pull the seat belt across John’s chest and buckling him in.  “I’ll just be a minute.”
Sherlock keened in the back of his throat, unsure whether to be distraught or ashamed but ultimately settling for grateful.  In one fell swoop, Mycroft had settled his anxious mind.  He had left him with nothing but the reality of punishment and the expectation of future comfort.
It took a moment for John to realize that he was in his adult mindset again.  He had woken up a time or two throughout the night and had been exclusively little during those occasions--once getting up to use the loo (he had thought about but then decided against wetting his pull-up), and once to weepily check if Mycroft had arrived yet.  Both times, Greg had patiently helped him with whatever it was he needed and then put him back to bed with a pat on the hand and a kiss on the forehead.
“What’s up, bud?” Papa asked once he’d finished his conversation with Mycroft to find that Sherlock was studying him.  “Do I have food on my face like the little Bunny?”
Bunny turned around and stepped out of the timeout corner but did not look up at the man sitting in a kitchen chair who was waiting for his apology.  He stared down at the ground, angry with Daddy.  Daddy didn’t seem to care at all that he was feeling sick and really, really confused today.
Sherlock tended to glare and even become angry when Mycroft used pet names.  He’d grown to put up with “buddy,” “kiddo,” or “‘Lock,” when they were ageplaying, the terms Mycroft had used even when they were children, but, unlike John, who could not get enough of cutesy names, Sherlock’s desire to be a big kid kept him from accepting anything he deemed too babyish.  When he sunk this little, however, Sherlock was too wrapped up in his desire for comfort to worry about what he was called, and Mycroft could not help but take advantage of the opportunity to coddle and love.  It was generally the only time Sherlock accepted affection.  Mycroft had called Sherlock "string bean" when they were kids as a form of teasing, especially during the boy's most awkward growth-spurts.  But, over the years, it had become an endearment.
Mycroft put down his newspaper and exchanged a look with Greg, who was finishing up the French toast and scrambled eggs in the kitchen, before turning to address his brother.  John was at the kitchen table as well, and he dropped his head into his hands.  It was not only becoming clear that John had most likely had his own Sherlock concerns to deal with the night before, but that he was currently nursing a horrible headache.
They sat breathing together until John was well enough to stand.  Mycroft led him back to the guest bedroom, where he sat on the edge of the bed, told John to lay down, and began rubbing John’s back.  He told him he was safe, told him he was not alone.  The plush rabbit was placed beside John’s pillow, and John jerkily reached to tuck it under his arm, hiding the blush spreading across his cheeks by shifting deeper into the sheets and blankets.
“Okay, Daddy,” he said, leaning over to kiss Mycroft, who, after rolling his eyes, kissed him back with a smirk.
“I did!” Sherlock argued, but they both knew it was a lie, and after a pointed look from Mycroft, Sherlock gave another dramatic sigh, but obeyed.
“If you don’t understand how your behavior impacted others this morning,” Mycroft said, quirking an eyebrow at the kid, “then maybe I need to lengthen that time-out significantly.”
Mycroft straightened the sheets and comforter as he waited for his brother.  He kept himself from glancing at the clock.  He and Greg had cleared their schedule for the folloiwng day, which meant he would not be required to be at the office early, but he still wasn’t keen to keep a timed record of the amount of sleep he was losing.
Mycroft had been able to see that it had all been a bit confusing for the boy, but he was not about to treat John any differently than how they had discussed.  Mycroft needed to assure him that he would treat him exactly as John requested in their chats about boundaries and rules.
“It’s fine, Mycroft,” he said at last, unable to put into words the vast array of emotions he was feeling.
“Is he...Is he okay, then?” John asked, nodding towards the little detective, who chose a new color crayon and giggled as he added jagged, lopsided spikes to the back of a dinosaur.
“Children act out for attention,” Mycroft mused.  “We’ll simply have to give them all the attention they require.”
He’d wanted a bath, clean clothes, and to be allowed to go back to bed, where he could suck his pacifier and forget about the chaos of the morning and the seemingly endless tantrum Sherlock was throwing in the other room.  But Daddy did not run a bath, clearly having another plan for Bunny’s morning.
John tried to accept Lestrade’s words as truth.  It was something he’d been working on with Mycroft, not second guessing the motives behind someone’s statements.  And, in that moment, exhausted and feeling vulnerable, the memory of Mycroft’s assurances in the back of his mind, he allowed himself to let go.
“Mycroft?” Sherlock called tentatively, but his voice was little more than a whisper, and the two men slept on.
“He’ll be just next door, little one,” Mycroft said as he smiled down at him.  “And Uncle Greg and I will be just across from you in our bedroom.”
John smirked and, sitting back down, tucked into the eggs.  He ignored the comfort Greg’s simple directions brought to him and the fear he’d felt at the prospect of Greg leaving, a fear that an adult Sherlock would have diagnosed as separation anxiety.  John was not a child at the moment; he would have been just as capable of staying behind as he was capable of accompanying Greg to a crime scene.
John was standing on the childish stepstool over the sink, brushing with his Little Mermaid toothbrush.  The pirate pacifier rested on the sink beside him.
John closed his eyes and groaned.  Of course Greg had called Mycroft.  Of course John’s shame was passed around from person to person within moments.  John lay back on the mattress and once more pulled the sheets over himself.  He wished he could start the day over again.
He turned to smile at Mycroft, who had not been able to let Sherlock off his lap without the boy whimpering and fussing since he’d gotten him to settle down in his youngest headspace.
They’d participated in some desperation and wetting play in the past, even a few times in bed, but never anything like this.  Sherlock’s hand ducked down to lazily stroke inside his pull-up when John’s hand fell away, and he turned his head to kiss John on the mouth.
Sherlock shrugged and pushed his way past Mycroft out of the bathroom.  Mycroft thought he could feel John almost imperceptibly nod at the suggestion that they would try after dinner, which was a relief.
“I’ll be right out in the kitchen if you need me,” he said before leaving and closing the door so it was only opened by a small sliver.
“Well, that was a very big cry,” Daddy said when Bunny lay quieter at last, collapsed against Mycroft, exhausted.
Bunny woke with a gasp, the swirling remnants of a nightmare casting a haze of fallen men, flashing lights glinting on sharp objects, and muddy, trampled fields into the darkness of his bedroom.  He could hear rain through the half-opened bedroom window, and fumbled beneath the sheets until he found Willa and pulled her into his arms.  The bedroom was dark and claustrophobic—Papa and Daddy has forgotten to turn on the nightlight by the door, and his heart beat fast in his throat as he gasped and willed away the heaviness in his chest.  His breath was ragged with uncertainty as his eyes filled with tears and blurred the still-looming images of a battlefield thick with blood.
The boy was attempting to gain sympathy points.  It may have worked with Greg, who was less used to Sherlock’s ploys, but Mycroft could see straight through the boy's attempts to excuse away his wet pull-up as anything other than an intentional wetting.
By the time they were out of the toy section, Greg could see the boy was tiring.  The boy hadn’t finished his breakfast that morning given his trip to time-out and then the rush to get to the store.  It was likely he was hungry for lunch, and getting ready, as had become routine, for his early afternoon nap.  Greg told the kid that they had just one more thing to pick up, and led them to the pharmacy section.
Bunny lifted his head when he caught a quick glimpse of a cartoon that looked to be following colorful ponies on rainbows.
“No!” Sherlock said, diving back towards his pillow and hiding his face, but his voice was whiny, and Sherlock could feel the pull to let himself give into a younger version of himself.
Sherlock led him by the hand down the hallway.  They paused in front of the master bedroom, where he peeked his head into the cracked doorway.  John leaned down to see through as well, trying to adjust his eyes from the soft light given off by the hallway nightlight to the darkness of the bedroom.
Sherlock still wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about Bunny being a girl.  It had all seemed okay last night, in theory.  Talking abstractly last night with Mycroft about Bunny’s shifting gender had been one thing; actually being asked to interact with little girl Bunny was a different matter.
John shook his head, then stepped into the pull-up Mycroft held out for him.  He was dressed quickly, joggers pulled up over the pull-up--which had calmed him far more than he'd ever imagined--and shirt whisked down over his head.  He was still unable to shake the waves of shame which came over him whenever he thought too hard about what was happening, but he was clean and dry at long last, and there was at least some peace in that.
Sherlock huffed and stomped a foot, but appeared to acquiesce to Mycroft’s terms.  He left the room with a dramatic sigh and flail of his arms, as if being asked to sit with his family for breakfast was the greatest hardship he’d ever face, and Bunny could hear heavy footsteps on the staircase as he stomped downstairs.
Greg handled the clean-up of the car seat by finding a roll of paper towels from the grocery bags he had packed earlier that day as well as a bottle of water that he used to pour over the seat before mopping up the liquid, hoping to dilute the urine and avoid smells and stains.  They lay a towel over the wet seat and shifted the boys over.  Sherlock was buckled into Bunny’s old seat and John was happy enough to finish up his ice cream--Sherlock had refused when Bunny offered him the rest--in the middle seat, leaning against Sherlock’s shoulder.  The detective generally refused any affection, but in this case he seemed content to have the little Bunny snuggled beside him as he yanked the sleeves of his pirate shirt down over his hands.
“Okay, honey bun,” Mycroft said.  “You go climb into bed and Daddy will go get Willa and your blanket from upstairs.”
They had finished a case three days before--triple homicide, hospital janitor--and Sherlock had since not been able to feel anything but aimlessness and a loss of purpose.  John had been doing all he could to distract Sherlock.  The trip to the pubs last night had been the last of his numerous attempts.  Sherlock went along with John’s plans because he knew John was simply trying to help, because he wanted John to feel the usefulness and sense of purpose that was sorely lacking from Sherlock’s own mindset.  But John’s distractions were only momentary bandages, and Sherlock could not help but feel the stab of frustration.   Without his phone to help him scroll through for potential cases, Sherlock could not help but feel the desire for drugs and solitude in some grimy drug den eating away at him.
He rolled his eyes and sat back up in order to kick off the blankets, his cheeks flushed and his movements jerky, signalling his frustration.  Sherlock was far from an accommodating person even when he was feeling healthy; it was clear he would not be softening his approach now that he was sick.
He let his thoughts go fuzzy as he forced himself to focus solely on the pain, on the humiliation, and on the release of tension.  But when Mycroft’s hits began to decrease in power, Sherlock whined in the back of his throat and shook his head, which was pressed into the crook of his brother’s elbow.
Sherlock was not fully young, not yet.  But the thought of Mycroft calling up Greg to relay Sherlock’s poor choices had his heart pounding and his eyes watering.  John and Mycroft were already annoyed with him; he didn’t want Papa to be, too.
“We grew up pretty lucky, you know?” Greg asked as he allowed himself to be shepherded towards the staircase.  “It’s taken all of this for me to start realizing.”
John ran a hand down his face and climbed out of bed, crossing to the doorway.  Sherlock was sitting cross-legged atop the comforter, hunched over a laptop.  The fact that Sherlock was clearly adult settled John’s mind, and he allowed the last vestiges of little space to slip away.
“I didn’t hear you, ‘Lock,” Mycroft said, taking a seat on the edge of the bed.  “I wasn't ignoring you.  I’m here now.”
“Eat your lunch, Sherlock,” Mycroft said from his place at the counter.  “The food on that plate needs to be gone before you can leave the table.”
It was clear the boy was still very young, and Mycroft feared he was potentially too young to comprehend what Mycroft needed to tell him.
When he turned the corner and stepped into the kitchen, he knew immediately that Sherlock--sitting still with his elbows on the table, fingers steepled before him--was deep in thought.  There would be no point in disturbing him before he’d worked out the current chain of contemplation, so Mycroft pulled out a chair and settled down to wait.  John hovered in the doorway, clearly attempting to keep his distance.
John sipped at his pint.  Sherlock was prattling on about the way in which the fermentation processes used in the process of making American beers differed from that of European.
Mycroft, sighing, nodded.  "Just this once.  And don't tell your brother," he said, and John agreed quickly, although he felt a twinge of guilt over all of the secrets he and Mycroft had lately been keeping from Sherlock.
“Why did you leave Mycroft’s yesterday?” he asked, cheek warm against John’s skin.  “Something must have happened which compelled you to self-soothe with more than your usual two and a half pints.”
Once they’d entered their flat, Sherlock turned to do up the deadbolt on their front door.  John raised his eyebrows, and Sherlock actually smirked.
“We’ll see, Bun,” he said.  “Sherlock will need them again, too, soon enough, and he’s used to the blue ones.”
I hope you're all well--thank you so much for sticking with me and continuing to read/comment/leave kudos even though I've had less time to update than I would like.  You're all such lovely creatures, and I look forward to your thoughts about this chapter :)
John scrubbed a hand over his face and squirmed in his chair.  If Sherlock was averse to receiving affection, John was averse to making others go out of their way for him.  Lestrade clearly had better things to do.
“You can slip down as young as you’d like, bud,” he’d said while carrying Sherlock downstairs.  “I’ll be here for you.  I’m not going anywhere and Bunny and Uncle Greg love you no matter what, okay?”
“John, I can sense there’s more you’d like to talk about than whiskey barrels,” Sherlock said when their laughter settled into a tense silence once more.  “Shall we discuss this past weekend?”
“Thanks, kid,” he said.  “I knew you’d be the best boy for the job.  But I also need someone to pick out a special surprise for Sherlock’s brother, Bunny.  Do you know anyone who might be right for that job?”
“I’m sorry,” Bunny wailed, a hand over his wet pajama pants as Sherlock opened the closet door.  “I didn’t mean to!”
Sherlock found himself settling once the front door had closed and he was alone with his big brother.  As comfortable as he had grown ageplaying with Bunny and Papa, there was nothing like the history and comfort found in the quiet moments he shared with Mycroft.  Greg had gotten skilled at understanding Sherlock, at finding ways to allow him to accept care and attention, and John had learned to support him whether small or big, but it was Mycroft who read Sherlock’s needs at his most difficult.
“It was a tough day, huh bud?” Mycroft asked when he had sat at a chair in the kitchen and pulled John away from his shoulder so he could look him in the face.
He was pleased when Mycroft smiled and leaned in to kiss him.  At least they were in this together for their boys.
“I’ll explain when we have a moment,” Mycroft said, turning off the faucet and drying his hands on a dishtowel.  “It’s a rather delicate situation, although arguably one which I should have anticipated, given the direction things have been going with John.  I was ignoring the inevitability, ignorantly assuming we’d have more time."
Papa seemed to understand that he had hurt Sherlock, and stepped close to rub between his shoulder blades as Mycroft quieted Bunny’s laughter.
Greg chuckled and helped the boy get his shirt over his head, then gestured for Bunny--still shy and quiet from the events of the morning yet adorably attached to Sherlock--to come closer so he could begin to undress the younger boy.  Sherlock began prattling on about the myriad swim strokes he knew, already beginning to demonstrate how he would teach Bunny as he rushed around the room.
Greg knew what Mycroft would say: such flagrant disobedience deserved a spanking, no matter the consequences.  But the kid looked so afraid, and Greg was starting to realize that there was even more to John’s sordid childhood past than he or Mycroft had first suspected.  There was no doubt both boys were working to heal their abandoned inner children when they regressed in age, but Greg was starting to realize just how many scars John carried.
“Uncle Greg!” no fewer than three nieces and nephews called, rushing to Greg to be lifted or tickled or to have their hair tousled.
John gathered the toy into his arms, kissing its nose and then tucking it beneath one of his arms.  He stepped towards Mycroft, then leaned against his chest and wrapped the arm not holding the toy around the man.  Mycroft wrapped him in his arms, and leaned down and kissed the top of his head.
“I should’ve held off on the charts,” he said, regretting that, in his eagerness to have the boys back, he may not have been very tactful in introducing the plan for potty training.  “He obviously wasn’t in a place to appreciate them.”
They half expected an aged-up John to appear for one of his late-night chats with Mycroft to process the emotional weight of the day or a whiny little Sherlock complaining that he was bored of sleeping, but as the hours passed it became clear they would be kid-free for the evening.  And while they knew conversations with both Sherlock and John out of headspace would be necessary, that plans needed to be made to address the events of the day, they were happy to give their boys a night to sleep off the stress.  The kids deserved their rest, and Mycroft and Greg were all too happy to take comfort in the steady familiarity of each other.
“The loo is just across the hall,” she told him as she turned on the bedroom light and crossed the small room to the foot of the wooden bunk bed, where she opened an antique chest and took out a woven blanket.  “The bunk beds are old, but comfortable.  Greg’s used to be the bottom bunk, but you can take your pick.”
Sherlock lay across Mycroft’s lap and cried for a moment longer while Mycroft rubbed the reddened skin of the boy’s bum.  Eventually he helped him to stand, so that he could look him in the eye.  Mycroft was pleased to see that Sherlock was calm at long last, that his mind was finally content even as the boy wiped his face with the backs of his hands.  He smiled up at the boy and reached to hold him by the wrists.
Bunny whimpered when a loud clap of thunder and the howling of the wind added to the fearful reverberations of a nightmare even too intense for adults.  What had been only light rain when the boys had fallen asleep had become a thunderstorm, one close-by judging by the sound of the thunder and the short gaps of time between booms and lightning.  Bunny was frightened.
“You don’t need to be a part of this, John,” Mycroft said.  “I can bring him to my place tomorrow morning and keep him with me until he’s well enough to function as an adult again.”
Sherlock nodded, wiping at his eyes with the heels of his hands.  Mycroft caught him gently by the left wrist, and, pulling Sherlock’s pajama sleeve to his elbow, exposed the colorful plasters lined along the underside of his forearm.
“Sherlock, stop!” John gasped, out of breath, feeling himself losing control as Sherlock moved his hands up beneath John’s sweater and t-shirt to tickle his ribs.  His hands were wrapped tight around Sherlock’s forearms, attempting to pry him away, but he was too weak with laughter to be a productive deterrent.  “I’m going to piss myself!”
Mycroft sighed and, wrapping his hands around Sherlock’s upper arm and one of his elbows, hoisted him up until he was seated in his lap.  Sherlock whined, squirming to get away, but Mycroft held him firmly in place, and eventually the boy settled.
The rocking motion was soothing, causing Sherlock to feel sleepy and content, farther away from his doubts and self-inflicted shame.  Maybe he could be smaller; it would certainly be nice to be taken care of while he was feeling so congested and achy.  He felt less on-edge when he thought about slipping down further, less frustrated and liable to lash out.
Papa sighed and Bunny was passed from Daddy’s arms into Papa’s.  Bunny whined a bit, wanting his Daddy, but he was soon snuggled up in his Papa’s grasp and content enough to close his lips around his thumb and rest his head on Papa’s shoulder, simply pleased to have the comfort.  He didn’t want to have to take care of himself today, not while feeling so sick.  Papa rested his hand on Bunny’s forehead, testing his body temeprature just as Daddy had earlier.
Bunny stepped further inside and closed the door behind him; it would make as good a hiding place as any.  The room was scarier with the door closed, heavy curtains hanging from the windows to block out the daylight, so Bunny hurried to take refuge beneath the large desk on the side of the room closest to the bookcases.
“Oh alright,” Sherlock said, nodding towards the front windows.  “The lot of them passed by half an hour ago.  Prattling on and on about their insufferable victory.  Balance of Probability.”
Although his adult self had come to terms with and was on the way to forgiving John for needing Mycroft to be his Daddy, Sherlock’s little self could not help but feel jealous of Bunny and frustrated with his constant presence at his heels, particularly after the babyish way he had behaved all morning.  Sherlock thought he and the Bunny had agreed to be partners in crime, joined together to annoy Mycroft.  Instead, his little brother had been quiet and quite young all day, mainly non-verbal as they traipsed around outside looking for frogs in the lake.  Sherlock was frustrated, not only because they had not found a single frog after looking for nearly half an hour, but also because he was beginning to wonder if the Bunny was intentionally trying to show all of the ways he was a less difficult little than Sherlock.
Sherlock shrugged and wiped at his eyes, pulling absentmindedly at the fur on Dimitri’s tail.  He wasn’t sure where to begin.  He was guilty about peeing his pants and nervous about the training chart and hungry from refusing to eat all of his lunch, not to mention still feeling awkward in headspace, self-conscious and feeling like he was taking up too much space.
The boy sniffled and shook his head violently enough that Mycroft could tell he was refusing just from his body language beneath the blankets.
Greg smiled down at the boys, nodding.  He and Mycroft had been planning to let the boys swim as early as the first day they’d arrived at the beach house.  Chances to swim, canoe, and kayak were few and far between in the hustle of city-life, and they had chosen this particular lake house specifically for the convenience of its private lake access.  But bad weather, moody children, and unexpected situations requiring full attention had kept them from actually acting on their plans until now.  Mycroft hadn’t seemed particularly concerned, but Greg was determined to get the boys in the water before they left the lake house that evening.  With any luck, they could tire the boys out and get them to sleep on the ride back to London.
"It's good for when you're feeling really little," Bunny whispered, and Sherlock felt something draped over his shoulders which he knew must be John's baby blanket.
