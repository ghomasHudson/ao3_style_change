“Too fresh. If she had been separated long, the recent sunny weather over the past two months would have faded the lining, the obvious mark and indents suggest the ring was removed today, this night to be precise, I assume just before your date. If you look over the right side of her neck, you’ll notice the skin there is of a slightly different color, makeup, to hide the love bites left by her husband, or perhaps one of the three other men she’s choosing to sleep with. Knowing your morals, I assume you wouldn’t have brought her here with intentions to engage in intercourse had you known.”
“Are you accepting under the conditions in which I presented?”
Guilt and hopelessness
Not that he wanted her brother to know, god no; he’d rather take his chances in court

“I assume Donovan is already in position as well?” Sherlock continued, completely ignoring Anderson
When he reached Baker ST, he looked up, hesitating yet again before entering, wondering about the whole thing. Of course he knew the pregnancy was accidental, his own damn fault for not practicing the advice he told so many teenagers at the clinic, safe sex and all. But to hear his concern, about how Sherlock viewed him, was disconcerting, and he felt that cloud of doubt loom over his head, the same that formed when Mortiary compared him to a loyal dog
“Obviously, which is the only reason I agreed to such ridiculous customs.”
“You…you know how I am, John…What I am…” she paused, and John could practically hear her debating whether or not to actually use the word sociopath, when whenever she brought it up in the past it ended with a row, she seemed to decide against it, thankfully, and continued with stuttering breathes “Is this…is this really what you want?” She asked, her eyes searching every inch of his face yet not holding their usual air of arrogance and all knowing, but instead held confusion and something that was scarily closed to vulnerability.
“He’ll be fine.” She replied, purposely using her know-it-all tone to give John some comfort, if she was confident in something, he should be too “The constant movement gives it away”
“Unnecessary” she replied, and once again ran her deadly long fingers up his shaft through his pants, causing his legs to buckle
Once she left, he was a bit upset with Sherlock for claiming to be his wife, if she hadn’t, he could have asked for Amy’s (the nurse) number without seeming like he intended to make her a mistress
At some point he must’ve dozed off, because when he opened his eyes the lighting that greeted him was that of a dim evening, his eyes immediately landing on those of the consulting detective that was leaning over the side of the sofa, hands prompted on the edge of the cushion to support her, her curls veiling around her face like a halo of darkness, looking rather black in the low lighting
“Come on, now. You show interest in other women and suddenly she’s pregnant? I wouldn’t be surprised if she was lying about the whole thing.”
John snorted at that, to which Sherlock smirked, the tension in her shoulders dropping a fraction “My thoughts exactly. Though I back then, as embarrassing as it is to admit, admired my brother, and agreed to start in order to please him. As it turned out I had a natural talent, and soon surpassed his level”
It was cold outside, as fall days in London often were; fresh rain ruining most of the crime scene and leaving little evidence in it’s wake; still, she circled, long and proud movements as her eyes took in all the little details otherwise left unnoticed, before crouching down directly in front of the man’s body, rattling off deductions faster than Lestrade seemed capable of writing down, never bothering to slow and let others keep up
“Slow? Why in the world would you want that?”
Was it her deductions speaking, or her own insecurities? Unable to give the answer, the annoyance and fear it was directed at built up, and over time, she felt it chipping away at her perfectly mastered self-control, until finally, it cracked
He reached out the tuck a curl behind her ear, giving her a comforting half smile that Sherlock knew was fake
The knock on the door snapped him out of his thoughts, and immediately, he looked towards Sherlock, whom to his surprise was already awake, running her hands through her tangled hair, cheeks still flushed from birth and skin radiating life and health and John couldn’t help but think she looked more beautiful right then than any other time he’d seen her
He sleep well that night
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dr. Watson is a forgiving man, Sherlock, but it would not be wise to test his limits.” And with that, the smug bastard left, leaving her frustrated and confused. Having to go over her decision once again and factoring in the new variable, exactly has he planned his visit to go, no doubt.
“Come, then, John, Lestrade should have been able to catch the culprit after the incident, but we should had back to the morgue to reevaluate some of his earlier victims for more
Looking back, it probably would’ve been a better idea to tell him somewhere else, somewhere more…romantic. And while the delivery of the news didn’t seem to matter much to her, she wished she would’ve taken into consideration John’s draw towards sentiment. In her defense, though, it wasn’t exactly a planned event, just a statement of facts to not stir commotion at a crime scene and seemingly having the opposite effect (honestly, emotions were NOT her area), either way, she regretted it.
“Hamish.” Sherlock spoke softly, but with purpose, releasing John’s hand to caress the baby’s closed fist with her long index finger
“Greg” John corrected
“Sherlock, where are your clothes?” John finally asked, with a clear of his throat, trying to seem casual
Finally he reached their distention, dropping the genius onto the mattress and following quickly
“I suppose you’re correct” she smiled, moving to remove her tights
“Alright, and Sherlock” John called, as he too rose from his seat, collecting his empty tea mug
“Married to her work.” He repeated,  “Sherlock said that when we first met, still seems like the case”
His mouth was everywhere as his fingers fumbled with the buttons of her shirt, stopping briefly at each one as if asking for permission to undo the next. She didn’t stop him, rather, encouraged him by doing the same, and soon his mouth crashed against hers in another heated kiss once the buttons were all undone and his hands made their way over her bare stomach, over her bra, and finally pushing the plain fabric up to pinch lightly at her nipples
“She’s also the one that gave you that obvious hickey after we talked, then?” she scoffed, shaking her head “I knew she was childish, but it’s going a bit far. Marking her property like she’s telling others not to play with her toys”
John was a caretaker by nature, and Sherlock never truly minded
“Well, of course not. Do you honestly believe someone with my draw towards knowledge would allow myself to go without understanding the fundamentals of human desire?”
“You blew our cover”
“Happy birthday”
“What are you talking about?”
There were many different Sherlock’s she’d play, Victim Sherlock, Timid Sherlock, Angry Sherlock, Ditzy Sherlock, Bitchy Sherlock, Carefree Sherlock, Serious Sherlock, Flirtatious Sherlock, Drunk Sherlock, Crazed Sherlock, Cheating Sherlock, Devoted Wife Sherlock, and Sweet and Innocent Sherlock. He was inclined to prefer the latter two, for obvious reasons, she played the roll so well, slipping it on like a second skin he could almost believe she wasn’t the mad genius she was
“Soiled” She responded with a wave of her hand, dismissive as always
Even after the ridiculous tradition of sealing the contract with a kiss and erupting applause from the crowd and a rather deep blush from John, it still wasn’t over
“Watson!”
She never voiced her appreciation, but it must have been obvious at that point, even John couldn’t be dense enough to assume that she would behave the way she does around him to just anyone.
“O-Oh, right”
This fic only has a handful of chapters left...
“I doubt either I nor my brother will ever be having children, so speculation seems irrelevant”
She didn’t reply, not even a hum, and the blank stare she gave the ceiling gave him chills
“I need them”
“Yes, Papa” He replied
She laid there, with one pale arm draped over her eyes, the other still clutching her weapon hung loosely to the side. What was normally covered by a striped blue dressing gown and too short pajama pants was bare, the pale expands of her long, a bit too thin torso in direct line with John’s all too greedy eyes, practically singing to him to allow his gaze to wonder over her beautifully lean body. The only clothing to hide her modesty was a pair of boxer shorts (His, which seemed to shock him more the sight with the sheer intimacy of it) and a pale pink bra to house her small and humble chest
I also changed the tags on the fic in case y'all wanna stop reading it or not
“I can’t spend an entire night pretending to be something I’m not”
Finally! Next chapter will, in fact, be smut, so look forward to that
Besides, he rather liked the idea of keeping it private, just for them, for him, something to hide from the world and tuck into his pocket, a little bubble of happiness he allowed himself to feel every time they touched, the fantasy that would live in his head, that as they went at it, hard and fast and dirty yet so perfect, it was driven by affection rather than lust, that there were feelings involved, and when she curled against him in the bed they began to share, resting her head to his chest, utterly spent, he’d indulge himself the slight caress, following the line of her body with the tips of his fingers, intimate in a way that had no business outside of lovers and life partners
The human mind was a strange thing, especially someone like Sherlock’s. Even as her eyes glazed over, her body heating to the point of fever, her knees nearly knocking together, her mind still rattled off deductions, still observed every inch of skin her fingertips explored
“I read about you, on his blog I mean. Able to tell right away John was smitten” she smiled
“Well, you can remain at the flat if you’re so inclined”
Dozens of cold showers and bleeding lips later, he still found himself digging his blunt fingers into his good leg to distract himself whenever she decided clothing wasn’t necessary or that personal space, even two different genders, didn’t apply to her
“Despite your compact size, the sofa isn’t big enough to hold you. Should you sleep there your shoulder will be in pain the entire ride back to London”
John couldn’t face her
“Christ, Sherlock!” He groaned when she gave a roll of her hips, planting pale hands on his freckled chest, tracing their patterns absently, already making future plans to map them out and remember each and every one
He really didn’t want anything like that going on his arrest record, and he was almost certain Mycroft wouldn’t be clearing it the way he had with the spray painting issue
“Am I supposed to let a murderer get away? I was in pursuit and I followed”
Then he did, no one
Not for cases, family ties, appearance, or whatever other excuse people seemed to find. It was just affection. Plain and simple from the moment they became flatmates
“I have to admit he’s cute” Donovan said, before pulling a ridiculous face that junior found hilarious as he extending chubby hands towards her
He paid close attention to the task at hand, since each woman was different, he wanted to make sure he got Sherlock just right, knowing what made her breathy sighs turn into deep moans, what made her legs tighten around his face and her hips tremble with pleasure
“We need a…” He cleared his throat, because that squeak in his voice was not flattering his pride, and tried again “condom”
Sally looked away, a blush on her tan cheeks
And there they were, her having the damn nerve to look completely put upon by his emotional state, as if the only thing on her mind was getting off and his distress wasn’t helping her arousal
“John…” she breathed as she buried her face in his neck, kissing the smooth skin with a hint of morning stubble there earnestly
Sherlock was a bloody good mother most of the time, she was attentive, and the fact she treated their child like she would any adult with a tad bit more affection, he clung to her hip and became just like his mother. John had managed to rough out the whole ‘everyone around me is an idiot’ view, and now their child was a relatively normal one. As normal as any son of Sherlock Holmes could possibly be
And though she didn’t care for what others thought of her, the whispers that followed among the officers whenever she entered the Yard made her jaw set tight, and her fingers curl into fists
She felt the slightest bit of heat prickle her cheeks at just how wrong she was
His body was already pumping adrenaline, mind reeling with possibilities of who exactly had managed to sneak into the flat without raising either his or Sherlock’s attention, something no one had managed to do while they were both there
John was a soldier, a doctor, a healer and protector, and there was no way on earth he'd ever let that man touch Sherlock. He swore he’d guard her with his life, watch over her in every way possible, and if that meant pulling her back when she wondered a bit too close, locking her away when she wanted nothing more than to play the man’s sick games, if it meant making her regret and hate the day she met John, then so be it
“It’s different, when it’s with someone you love” he said after a short pause
“You twirl it, constantly, leading me to believe you wish it gone”
She sighed again, leaning back slightly in her chair to rest a single hand over the growing swell of her stomach, cursing slightly how NOTHING of either hers nor John’s worked to cover her skin completely, and it wasn’t as if she was about to something as mundane as shopping for maturity clothing. The peek of pale skin from her pajama bottoms and
“Easier to move in suits, yeah…” He looked away, suddenly not able to look at her
“As many slices as will fit”
“Mycroft plays?”
“I know, Sherlock!” He yelled, before shaking his head and sighing “I know, just…sorry, alright?”
Sally shook her head one more time, like she still couldn’t believe the family of Baker St before getting her radio and speaking into it, “Holmes is here, bringing her in”, having dropped ‘freak’ around the same time as Sally’s deodorant became similar to that of a certain DI
She huffed, sitting up and crossing her arms, her long legs tucking beneath her, thin and lanky on the narrow space
“I’m fine, John”

“People do little else” she replied, and a crazed smile, like many of the ones they shared during inappropriate times, split across her face, and they both burst out in maddening giggles that had no place in the situation they were in
He felt just a little bit closer to the detective after that
It was time he gave up fighting it, the moon was more likely to fall out of the Earth’s orbit than John to fall out of Sherlock’s
“Do you know where she’s headed, by any chance?” He asked after a few minutes of awkward silence, rotating between watching the screen of the computer as it scanned whatever sample Sherlock was testing, and Molly adjusting her hair, or doodling in the corner of her report
(See the end of the chapter for
‘We’re not a couple’
She merely rolled her eyes for what felt like the hundredth time that night. “I was in control of the situation at hand. Waiting for reinforcements was not an option, we were out of time”
“Maybe we could go back to your place…for a cup of coffee?” She asked, with a fake air of hesitance, as if trying to say she didn’t do this often
Immediate flush of cheeks, eyes darting off to the side, arms crossing in a defensive posture. He was embarrassed by being caught, Sherlock noticed, though it wasn’t like she cared. Feeling his eyes on her made it difficult to ignore his presence, as if the doctor was radiating warmth, shining a bright neon sign that screamed 'I’M HERE PAY ATTENTION TO ME'
“My sexual history, you’re curious” she replied, impatient, as always
“Whoo hoo, Sherlock dear, are you decent?”
Her family didn’t ask a single question after that
John opened his eyes and was met with vague early morning light, somewhat darkened and musky by the sharp draw of curtains and air thick with dust.
“Sherlock…should you really be…”
The fact Sherlock hadn’t realized the staff had been replaced with Mycroft’s was just an indication on how much pain she was in, too much to even focus on basic deductions
There would always be times were their roles were reversed, and she was the to protect him, even something as seemingly small as this
She gave a dramatic sigh, before entering the victim’s home, her head held high, and instantly, as always, all eyes fell to her, and it was as if she had never left
Even as easily read as John was, he had a tendency to say something that could mean a thousand things at once when he was nervous, as if being vague will get him any closer to an answer
“You ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool, people might talk” he joked, an attempt to easy her obvious nerves
What could they possibly know? Their brains weren’t a constant rush of restless energy; they didn’t need to be occupied every waking hour just to prevent themselves from slowly rotting away. She couldn’t just drop her life to make a home and breastfeed an infant, and the domesticity John craved was something she could never offer him

“As I expressed once before, John, you’re unique, a rare individual I hold to a higher esteem than the rest of the population, a conductor of light, and I couldn’t continue the Work as well as I do now were it not for you”
for updates on what's up with my life or my
“Clothing like his is hardly practical, John. I would never wear it were it not for the circumstances”
She had deduced the outline of his body, the way it would look without needing him to remove so much as a single layer of clothing, even touching the bare skin once before during an experiment, but the knowledge seemed inadequate now, and she tugged impatiently at the clothes that suddenly became a barrier in between them, desperate to see, feel, taste, every inch of his flesh
“Mycroft” she wrinkled her nose in disgust at the use of her brother’s name at a time like this “Had me tested every week during…” her voice trailed off, and John’s hands shifted from her breasts to her elbows, absentmindedly thumbing the scars there “I’ve hardly had a chance to acquire anything as of late. And you, being a doctor, as well as with the Work and any stranger you take home during a particularly frustrating time, have yourself tested twice a month, your most recent results coming up negative, since your suspicion is directed towards any habits I may have, I can assure you it is unnecessary, we’ll purchase them, along with a cautionary pill tomorrow afternoon” her voice grew breathy as she leaned forward, her fingers leaving his shaft to thumb the waist of his boxers
“There aren’t any signs of infection, and the wounds are shallow, you should be free to leave by this afternoon” She spoke cheerfully, tucking loose red hair behind her ear “I’m sure you already know all the proper ways to treat your wounds but I’m afraid I have to explain anyways”
“So, you thought ‘why not ask my flatmate?’”
“Thanks” he said, gathering the blanket and approaching the bed, though his eyes adjusted he still steadied his hands on the bed railing to keep from toppling onto the mattress too quickly
“Erm, May I?” She asked hesitantly, as if expecting Sherlock to reject her, not as if she didn’t have the right to, anyway
If you're interested in reading my original work, message me on my
Are there any more interesting cases open? –SH
He didn’t continue speaking, instead waving a vague hand towards her arm, where the long day of studying and working with materials, she had rolled up the sleeves to her silk shirt, pushing them up and exposing the expands of her skin
“Excuse me, sir” a soft knock followed by a quick entrance caused John to dart his attention away from his sleeping flatmate, looking up towards the door and bringing one finger to his lips
Only John mattered
She needed puzzles, the chases, the games that played out so well in her head and occupied her time and mind better than anything
“Shut up” he responded harshly, puncturing his words with another bite
“Caption John Watson, Army Doctor, Medically discharged and currently residing with me in our flat in London. 5 years my senior, been acquainted for 18 months, two weeks, and three days. Really, is this going to be the main topic for small talk social conventions dictate must take place during dinner?”
“We agreed no murders until he was 18” John added, just to say something, it always helped to remind people that he was still the other parent, and wasn’t about to let Sherlock do something too crazy like trying to show Junior a picture of a beheading when he was 7
Though it was a rather obvious lie, she still was grateful to the chain of events that lead to the two of them where they were, her in an uncomfortable dress and John practically glowing with happiness

“It’s…a difficult thing to understand, Sherlock” John said hesitantly, as if afraid of the turn the conversation was taking. Perhaps he should’ve seen it coming, broaching a sensitive
“If you're thinking about starting a relationship with her, keep in mind she prefers men who are already married.” Her lips pulled slightly downwards at the corners “Though I suppose she sees you as unavailable due to our current arrangement” vague gesture between them, like the air there spoke for her “Perhaps that works in your favor”
She needed to take him apart before she fell to pieces herself
tw: sexual harassment for this chapter
Something in her tone didn’t sit right with him, and he frowned “Just curious. You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to”
“Your wife is very devoted, Dr. Watson, she hasn’t left your side all night” her tone was hushed as she checked the pulse of his wrist
Gently, he took her hands, lifting them off his skin and pushing lightly on her shoulder
“Yeah, sure. Listen, I need your help” Lestrade said, obviously not believing a word but too busy to follow up on it
He was like his mother in a lot of ways, and around the age of 6 he had started experiencing headaches, telling them both that his mind was too loud and that the world was full of unnecessary noise and vividness. But while Sherlock had dealt with it all the way through schooling before turning to drugs at the young age of 19, she swallowed her pride to ask Mycroft to teach her son whatever technique he had used as a boy to silence his mind. Mycroft taught Junior without so much as a smirk or sign of smugness in his tone, something both John and Sherlock were grateful for. The end result being in their son, who still suffered from the occasional headache and fit of boredom, being able to narrow his focus down and concentrate on only one thing at a time, the centering giving him a way to use his gift without having to endure the burden of it during down periods
“Will you shut up?!” Sherlock barked, turning abruptly in her couched position to give Donovan and Watson her death glare
“Nice to meet you, Sherlock, I’m April” his date cheerfully introduced herself, and Sherlock merely cracked an eye open, flickering it over the woman’s figure before closing it again and muttering “Married”
“Um, hello…I don’t think we’ve met”
“I think Papa has a point, Mother, all the other child in my class have yet to see a corpse”
“We didn’t gather the necessary information”
I normally wouldn’t have left the flat for this case –SH
Again, he didn’t say a word, didn’t breathe, for fear that if he so much as moved, the moment would shatter
For almost a minute, he didn’t move, just stared at her, shocked, blinking a few times, unable to fully believe his eyes.
That hope was quickly squashed, however, when he opened the door, and there she lay, across the sofa she was so fond of, one long leg crossed over the other, sporting a powdered blue tank top and pajama bottoms that were clearly made from women closer to 5’5” and not 6 ft. Her dressing gown sprawled out on the floor by her feet; fingertips pressed together under her chin.
‘Yes you are’
“Into the bottom of the Thymes! I thought you were-” his voice broke, and he blinked his eyes rapidly because he was NOT about to cry in front of her. But the memories of his frantic search, his voice raw from crying out her name to black waters and Lestrade’s barked orders for a dive team were so fresh in his mind, leaving him on the verge of breaking down in wrenching sobs for the second time that day
She was an odd one, that Sherlock, brilliant beyond his understanding, and somehow, in that instant she spoke, he knew, he knew deep down that 221 B Baker street would be his new home
As if by checking, one day he’d notice its absence and leave, free of the tiny shackle tying him to her
Mycroft stared idly her direction; his face completely expressionless, though John picked up on even more tension in his shoulders than regular, his stance too stiff and a look in his eyes that he hadn’t seen before
“He would find out”
Without thinking, he dressed, his usual button up and casual jeans, and shrugged the expensive cloth over his shoulders, buttoning the first four buttons
He moved in in one smooth motion, planting a tender kiss to her cheek before slipping his mug into the sink
I also have gotten REALLY into Elementary (The american one with Lucy Lui) so I kinda forgot about the BBC version since it doesn't have that many episodes
“Sherlock…” He called softly, but she didn’t stir, out cold and catching up on years of neglected sleep, the job and stress exhausting her beyond even her self-control could handle
Those words hadn’t made as much sense to him back then. While worrying for your younger sibling was always something he could relate to, even Sherlock running around and jumping off rooftops didn’t seem to faze him. She could take care of herself, at least physically, able to take down a man twice her size unarmed with her fighting skills alone.
And he leaned back against he wall in hopes of calming his racing heart and evening his breathing
Next chapter will be it! Look forward to it
It wasn’t as if John had never been cross with her, but now he had a new way of expressing his anger, letting out his frustration, and she rather liked it, the underline desperation of his movements like he had an uncontrollable need to claim her, to take her over and over until his anxiety faded
“Sherlock…” he cleared his throat “what are you doing?”
His arms went around her back, holding her up for support as he walked blindly, lead only by Sherlock’s huffed sense of direction ‘left, chair, doorway’, each coming out sounding sexier than they should with her breathy moans whenever John sucked a specific spot on her neck
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know how much of a fan you are of cheaper product but try not to butcher the fabric while washing it, it holds more worth than all your other cardigans combined.”
“I’m sorry, one more time?”
This was about her not giving him the decency of knowing where she was, this was about her running off ahead of him and leaving him to chase after her figure, this was about how he kicked so many doors open in varies buildings until finally finding her, arms tied tightly behind her back, lip popped and swollen, forehead split, bruises shaped like fingers forming around her neck
Lestrade raised one brow at the doctor when she left, and John felt his cheeks flush
She took a few deep breaths, trying to understand the burning in her stomach that ran under her skin and seemed to be everywhere at once, rushing through her veins and tingling her fingertips
“It’s different, Sherlock” He replied, standing up and heading to his room “It’s just different…”
“You’re checking…. And that’s why you broke into my room while I slept?”
Little thing as it was, it worked to reassure her, him, them both, that they were fine, they would be just fine
“He was nice…at first. Though was quick to become cruel when I expressed my disinterest in sex. I deduced his affair quickly but was unable to confront him. I was in love, or so I thought” she gave a small smile, “though now it’s obvious it was nothing more than a childish crush. It wasn’t until Mycroft stepped in that I opened my eyes to the kind of man Victor truly was”
Once back in a comforting tank top and pajama bottoms, she reemerged from her room, tying her hair in a loose ponytail to keep it in place
“So…you’re not one then…a virgin, I mean”
She met him back full force “Hmm, I rather don’t see the point if they’ll just end up on the floor again” she replied evenly, leaning casually against the frame with her arms crossed over her chest
“Shut up!” His tone was strict, a command that was barked out in his captain voice
“You can tell all that, just by looking at me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s eyebrow went up, but she didn’t say anything, and for that, John breathed out a sigh of thanks
“I was wondering when you were gonna settle, Sheryl!” the man laughed heartedly and pat his full stomach, before spreading his arms wide in invitation
“Sherlock…” He half whispered, half moaned, a hint of disbelief in his voice like he couldn’t wrap his mind around what was happening
So, why worry?
“And that did what, soil me?” she asked with a huff, gripping the edge of her tank top to fling it off, before hunching over to unzip the sides of her boots
He shook his head and started again “We still have a lot to pla-”
“Mycroft, maybe you should wait outside” John suggested, using his free left hand to wipe at Sherlock’s brow and neck with a towel
Her focus, her radiant mind, her every bit of what made her, her, made his skin crawl and his blood pump south every time those icy eyes rested on his, a look that spoke of exactly what she had planned that evening
“Christ” John said, staring off into nowhere as he sunk back onto the pillows, his mind reeling
Sadistic arse
She furrowed her brows, surprised by that. The only people who had asked her about her history were Mycroft and Lestrade, both wanting to know what laws she’d broken and who she’d purchased from, but never what drove her there in the first place. Perhaps Mycroft already knew, but it never occurred to her someone would care enough to ask
“Oh, and John?”
Anyways, comment if you like the story thus far, I love reading what you have to say
He flinched as she grabbed her shirt, not bothering to even shoulder it on before stomping down the stairs to his room with a parting remark about him enjoying his ‘freak show’, and slamming the front door hard enough to shake the walls
“All the planning, wasted, because you couldn’t keep a leveled head” she continued, shaking her head “You have to keep your emotions under control, John, or it may cost us more than a case”
“Hmmm” He hummed in response, pressing his face against her neck and lightly biting, sucking on smooth and flawless skin in hopes of leaving a mark on the pretty pale flesh, a little reminder that this night was real, so when he woke up, he’d know it wasn’t just another dream
He began to wonder if Mycroft was being as overly dramatic as his sister
“Out with it, John” Sherlock mumbled, lips barely moving as she narrowed her all seeing gaze into the microscope in front of her
And it hit John then
John chuckled, reaching out to ruffle his son’s curly hair to lighten his mood a bit “Go on then, tell your mother what you see”
“Just…Donovan…”
“Hmm…yes, but when have we ever been usual?”
So I offically gave up on NaNoWriMo, but I plan to start writing fanfic again, if any of y'all watch/like Naruto, Inuyasha, Fruits Basket, or AtLA, I plan to write a few one shots/fics revolving them, tho not sure if I should post them here or just on
“Sorry?”
for fanfics I don't publish on AO3 (Tho it's mostly just anime tbh)
He put on the kettle to boil, removing the new toaster from the shopping bag and putting bread inside
I'm sorry for not updating, I recently had a baby and also I got married and also I got hit by a car (did I mention that before?) so like my life is hectic, but I'm gonna start writing again because my baby is 9 months now, I have more free time since she rather watch Kpop videos than hangout with her momma (my baby is half Korean so it's just her being exposed to one of the 3 languages she's gonna end up speaking since she's also half mexican and also living in america she's got Korean, English, and Spanish lined up for her)
She had mentioned it in passing when introducing herself; but for the first two months he hadn’t actually seen her so much as pick up the instrument, allowing him to completely forget she mentioned it, the flat remaining relatively quiet those days
Again, I may slow down in my updates during NaNoWriMo, but since I'm gonna be writing on my laptop, I figure that I should be able to open another tab and update this story, so hopefully? but no promises
Seems like he wasn’t much for imagination, or that if any place was to house his memories and life for the past few months Baker St was as good as any
Of course Mike had on a smug smile when John had turned back to him, utterly confused.
Mycroft let out a deep breath, his eyes closing for a bit longer than a normal blink
Some of the tension faded from her body
for the Google Doc link
Sherlock Holmes was a bloody good liar, something that always shocked John whenever he saw it, and he always was left wondering how many of the things they’ve spoken of were simply bent truths, or just flat out fibs
But nowhere near what it used to be, what was comfortable before was now awkward and thick, deafening and pulling at her heart in ways she didn’t know were possible
Sally, as predicted, let herself a fraction of a second to let her gaze dart around the room, the corners of her lips pulling downwards when there was no sign of the forensic analysis
She smiled and left the room
I'll try updating in another day or two, but I'm gonna be getting a lil busy the next few days, so.. can't make any promises
“What did you see in him?” he asked, confused. Not that he fancied himself anything special, but Sherlock had always expressed her distaste for anyone even slightly dim, and the idea of her dating someone who was actually sulking about being less intelligent than her…
Jesus
The war had drained him, both mentally and physically. Leaving him the whisper of the man he once was. No more casual smiles, no more running, fooling around, joking, and laughing. Forced happiness and sleepless nights, that’s what he had become, what he was afraid he’d always be
He began to wonder introducing Sherlock to Harry, the only lesbian he knew, would be a good idea.
She giggled in reply, and nodded, launching into her explanations
The rest of the night passed with a blur, and sometime later, they were both back at the flat, Sherlock pulling her hair up and out of her face, running John’s pocket-handkerchief over her mouth and staining it with blood red lipstick
He made himself comfortable in his usual armchair, watching the detective sway back and forth, her eyes closed, the smile having never left her lips and she played and played, adding bits and pieces there, until it became an entirely different piece all together, and she composed a masterpiece right before his eyes
“Well, that’s just bloody perfect” John mumbled under his breath as they approached the doors, and Sherlock seemed unsurprised by the noise flittering through
So he closed his eyes again, and smiled, walking around the Baker St in his head, even preparing himself imaginary tea
She’d deal with all of it if it meant she’d keep that special warmth that always fluttered in her whenever John made her tea or draped a blanket over her still form when she was in her mind palace and didn’t notice the freezing air of the winter hitting her where she sprawled about the couch.
If you asked him outright why he was always so quick to correct any assumptions, John would have responded with the typical ‘because none of it is true’
(See the end of the chapter for
From all that it was obvious a surprise party for her was out of the question, any type of party at all, actually
Anyways pls remember to comment your thoughts on how this story is going thus far
As he undid her makeshift blindfold, she took one look at the location, breathed a soft gasp, and turned back to him abruptly, grabbing his shoulders and spinning them once, twice, before letting go and doing a little hop in place
“Calm down” John sighed, pulling the coffee table a bit closer to sit on the edge, taking Sherlock’s right slender foot into his hand
“John, text me the test results as soon as they appear” Sherlock said, before turning on her heels and heading towards the door without another word
“What? God, no Sherlock, no” he shook his head, his face flushing slightly at his body’s obvious disproval of him turning her offer down
“I said I’m fine” She denied, batting away his hands to place her own to her forehead, a gesture that spoke volumes of her annoyance as she pinched the bridge of her nose between her thumb and index finger.
John stole quick glances from over the top of his paper, before burying his suntanned face in it, trying so damn hard to focus on the tiny printed letters and not his half naked genius of a flatmate
I know it's not Sherlock, but I'm still writing for other fandoms if y'all like my writings, or you can check out my
“What happened?” He asked, the hand over hers tightening while the other moved up to weave into her curls
“My, my, have we interrupted a domestic?” Donovan’s lip curled up slightly in a sneer as she arrived on the scene, followed quickly by Lestrade, who wore a mask of disapproval over obvious concern
”I didn’t know she was taken, mate!”
“Being a doctor, you must help a lot of people,” She said, in her Irish drawl, twirling a strand of curly black hair in one pale finger
for the Google Doc link if you want it, but I won't post it here cause I'm a bit.. nervous, Ig?
He stared at her for what felt like forever, unable to move, or speak, or even breath it seemed, too entranced by the sight of Sherlock holding her baby, THEIR baby
Tunnel vision, as always
“Nothing…” He whispered in return, pulling out her chair so she could sit
She never brought it up, or pointed it out; even when it was so obvious even someone without her skills of deduction could figure out it wasn’t his gun he was sporting in his trousers, and for that, he was grateful.
A case then, his smile grew, and he walked towards the coat rack, pulling on his jumper, and holding out Sherlock’s coat when she reappeared completely dressed, helping her shrug into the fabric before making their way down the steps towards wherever the Work called them
The room grew quiet, and she paused for a second, before lifting the instrument again, tucking it under her chin and closing her eyes
“I’ve already given up the work, John, I can’t just lay around doing nothing”
It wasn’t until later, when he was brushing his teeth, did he see the very noticeable bright red spot forming on his neck, right where Sherlock’s mouth had been hours before, and he realized she’d been more concerned with marking him than getting him off
(See the end of the chapter for
It wasn’t like him, to ask questions about topics he knew she didn’t want to remember, and she wondered vaguely if perhaps marriage made him more comfortable than it should have. She promised him her future; her past was never part of the deal
I'll try to update maybe two or so days from now, but no promises
“What?” John froze, hand stilled over the strap of junior’s diaper
tw for delivery here
But today was different
Wassup y'all, sorry for the wait, here's the next chapter
He returned with crisps, handing her the can of whip cream and wrinkling his nose in disgust as she emptied it into the bag and began to eat
Sherlock, it seemed, was catching up on years of neglected sleep, the process as exhausting as it was seemed to completely drain her of energy, leaving John to rock the newborn in his arms softly and gently, a soft repetitive hum of a song that his mother used to sing was gently lulling the baby to sleep
“Elementary” she replied, her hands returning to her pockets as she handed back the sample to be tested
Sherlock’s eyebrow stayed lifted, and dammit the smug twat was actually smirking, as if it was so fucking hilarious that she single handedly simultaneously both ruined and made his life

An hour of not knowing if she had survived, an hour were every second felt like years and minutes like centuries
_________________________
At a time like this, John knew she just needed a constant, something to anchor her to reality so she didn’t drift into the dark places of her mind, places that may trigger some memories of needles breaking flesh
She sat up, like she hadn’t expected him to agree so quickly, the corners of her mouth pulling down slightly
“Jesus, Sherlock, is this the only reason we came here, then?”John asked, his orgasmic bliss cut through with her words, his fingers fumbling with the button of his jeans
“It’s hardly my fault that your dating life interferes with the Work, and I was under the impression you didn’t want me working cases alone after the jewel thief incident”
John shut his mouth, letting out a deep breath and letting that comment go. Of course Sherlock didn’t believe in love, not with how dysfunctional her home life seemed to be, and the closest resemblance to family affection is Mycroft bugging the flat and worming into her life every way he could manage, love seemed like a far off concept
“Is that true…?” John asked hesitantly
“John, of course” Sherlock sighed heavily, tucking unruly curls behind her ear, before turning back to Lestrade before anyone had a chance to react “I assume you’ll be able to take it from here?” without waiting for a reply, she turned on her heels, strutting off towards the main road to hail a cab “Come, John! I have experiments waiting back home!” She called over her shoulder
The subtle rocking of her hips against his was driving him insane, the friction of fabric on fabric, bodies wrapped in cloth rutting against each other quickly sprung his arousal, but the second he was fully erect, she stepped back, her lips leaving his neck with an audible ‘pop’
“Maybe I can come by to visit…”
The steady beeping monitor of the machine next to him helped him maintain his calm, and taking a deep breath, he took in his surroundings
Her voice was solid, and the air grew still, Lestrade and Ms. Hudson looking around awkwardly, and Mycroft’s face was not surprised, like he expected this issue to come up just as much as his sister.
“Let’s go catch our murderer”
“No one” she replied with a smirk and shut the door
When he made his way up, she was laying down again, sprawled out on the couch, fingertips of both hands together under her nose
“Your middle name is Hamish.” She spoke quietly, her eyes never leaving the baby’s face “Or perhaps you prefer John…I hadn’t prepared a name ahead of time.” She confessed with a slight smile, half expecting John to be annoyed
“Mhm”
“Bollocks!” John yelled, “You could’ve been killed! You’re not supposed to just run off without me!” he ranted on, picking up where he’d left off
“Maybe you should go home for the day” Lestrade suggested, his eyes looking towards the mess Sherlock made so close to the body with a look of poorly veiled disgust “The Flu’s been going around recently”
She sighed, annoyed. “I said, perhaps we should wed”
She sighed, her hands moving to trace his stomach and he instantly regretted every order of takeaway, flexing the muscles under her touch to seem a little less pudgy
“There was one.” She replied after a period of silence, and he looked at her in interest, silently encouraging her to continue
“Depending on its nature. Have you already discovered what happened to Ms. Andrews missing cat?” Sherlock asked, referring to one of the much too easy cases from a client she’d taken on only to pass down to their son, allowing him to develop some key observation and detective skills. The earning went directly into his tiny pocket
But it's a lil nsfw so forgive me?
He may not be able to do a lot of things
Both the Holmes’ siblings already looked done in for the day
“Hit on you, then?”

She rolled her eyes, grabbing his wrist and yanking his hand so it rested on her stomach
“You okay…?” He asked, his voice strained around the edges and he buried himself as deeply as he could inside her, feeling her walls clench around him, and though he was no stranger to the sensation, he could have sworn it felt like his first time all over again
“So what you have a kid and suddenly you’re the expert on relationships?”
She pulled away with a gasp, and his teeth sunk into her neck, cruelly biting were he’d only kissed tenderly before
But, she knew, deep down, John was always the one that brought out the most unexpected reactions from her, her mind, her body, her
“Sherlock-”
The sudden movement didn’t seem to sit well with her, however, and a wave of nausea hit her unexpectedly, causing her body to sway lightly, and she clamped her lips shut at the taste of bile rising up in her throat
Only 3 more chapters to go
The rumor that pregnant women gave out a light of their own was proving to not be as false as she once had thought. It seemed the rush of extra estragon was doing wonders for her complexion; she no longer looked like she was on the verge of fainting, but had her own healthy glow, though John, for all his good traits, was about as observant as a doorknob, and hadn’t seemed to pick up on the subtle changes in her.
Of course there were mutual guests such as Lestrade, Ms Hudson, and Molly (who she hadn’t be expecting at all, given the poor girls blatant feelings for her), it still was obvious who was the more popular of the two of them
“Hmm, yes…but you’re special”
“The Theatre! Brilliant, just brilliant, John!” she cheered, all but leaving him in the dust as she hurried inside, and he couldn’t help the smile that overran his face at the sight of her giddy grin and overall ecstatic behavior.
The evening passed in uncomfortable silence
“That would not be wise”
“I can’t have you deducing what we’re doing tonight, Sherlock, that ruins the point of the present”
“A case?” Sherlock asked, lifting one brow “Interesting, a kidnapping”
“It’s rewarding” He smiled, leaning forward so his jumper clad elbows rested on the table between them
Thx for reading, and kudos/comment to let me know what you think so far
Junior let out a breath, closing his eyes to gather his focus, before opening them and tuning the world out
She moved, propping herself on her elbow to get a better view of his face “Why do you wish to know?”
“This case is solved.” She rolled her shoulders back, as if checking the range of motion she still held, before standing up, straight, using her height to her advantage to seem healthy and confident, even as pain bloomed over her ribs, stomach, thighs, places his foot had made contact with during the physical fight
Sherlock turned her head slightly and gave him a look of warning, but how could John obey when the man couldn’t take a hint, even though Donovan had moved in closer, her lips practically on Sherlock’s in a clear sign that said “she’s taken”
“Move”
“Oh, good, finally. I was contemplating waking you, but the nurse informed me repeatedly it was ill advised”
How was it that this was one of those rare moments that crawled under her skin and dug into her nerves?
Okay so to address a review I got earlier just wanted to say Sherlock's height is NOT unrealistic
“Whoo hoo” Ms. Hudson entered, smiling brightly while holding what could only be loads of food Sherlock probably would have to be forced to eat “Hope we’re not interrupting”
“No!” she almost shouted, before regaining her calm in the blink of an eye “No, of course not, don’t be ridiculous” she said, folding her hands under her chin, quickly running her right ring finger over the stone on her left
“Boring” she replied, “how else was I to collect my data? You surely would lie had I asked, to maintain some form of pride in your appearance, as if the physical aspects of one self are important at all”
He absently rubbed his stomach as he approached the kitchen, ready to set about the task of making his morning tea, when he suddenly felt long arms snake around his back to his neck, attempting a choke hold
“Good. Surely he’d become obese should he spend any time with his uncle” Sherlock commented
Sherlock moved over, sliding to the end of the bed to give him more room than necessary, resuming her previous position and she was gone, off to where her thoughts would wander
He bent down to kiss her neck, his hands slipping further between her legs
He’d gone straight for a pub right then, ignoring his muddied pants and shoes, his caked on hair and stained jumper; he just really, really needed a drink
Sherlock is aware of the tension between them, so thick in the air it runs over their skin and leaves gooseflesh in its wake, a spark of fire in their veins that are so pumped with adrenaline, it leaves their hearts no break in their drumming
“Alright” John replied, slowly rising from the bed and giving Amy, who looked at the two of them with a baffled expression, a final goodbye before making his way out of the
“As your date?”
“Hmm, even in a hypothetical situation where we were to wed, I highly doubt I’d so easily agree to changing my name. Holmes is a trademark”
John snickered, covering his mouth with the back of his hand
Of course Molly’s outburst after Jim had left was proof that he hadn’t, and Sherlock, being Sherlock, cruelly deduced why the man was unfaithful, ending with having been left his number, which Molly turned bright pink to and actually stormed out of the morgue
She cursed her own stupidity on the matter, a complete disregard for the consequences of her actions, though it was hardly outside of her character
Donovan made a sound of disgust, wrinkling her tan nose “What’s wrong with the freak now?”
He could handle body parts in the fridge, violin at 2am, even the occasional gunshot at the wall, but this? This was asking too much of the doctor.
“You were mimicking me…?” She said, not asked, the question in her tone betraying that she couldn’t read his motive for doing such a thing
As she made her way out, sure enough Anderson was there, waiting for Sally to give the ‘all clear’ before heading in
Nausea, headache, and randomly swelling feet had not put her in the best of moods, and the last thing she needed was her brother poking into her most private affairs. Even he had never crossed the line of discussing her sexual choices, a wall between siblings that he was reasonable enough to respect
And she couldn’t wrap her mind around the thought that this man, the man that could have her anyway, anywhere, however he wanted, chose this, soft, slow kissing that was as teasing as it was loving, something no one had ever bothered to do before, expressing emotions and feelings she never thought would be directed at her
“Of course” Sherlock replied, transferring the child over to their landlady before turning her attention towards her brother
They stepped into the home, and John allowed himself a quick glance around before settling back on the man in front of him, who looked nothing like Sherlock but held some resemblance to Mycroft in his facial features
Vague hum of agreement
Danger nights. Mycroft had warned him about them, through a text, usually, or a well timed phone call, letting him know a specific day, hour, or even minute of risk, making sure the doctor kept his little sister from O.D.ing seemed like Mycroft’s main use for John, not that he minded, he’d do anything to keep Sherlock sober. He just never noticed these days, Sherlock was always her usual self, overly confident with a god complex; her mouth laced with silver and misdirected boredom being shot at unsuspecting strangers. She didn’t seem to be any different at all
“John invited you to this wedding out of courtesy, family rules and such, but seeing as you have yet to control your dependency” eyes running over her figure, “having had a few drinks every night for over the past two weeks, the only thing keeping you from alcohol today is the fear of the scent lingering on your person. Clean, neat, and proper, John would invite you in with open arms under the assumption you’ve sobered, as you intended, but would instantly be crushed to learn of your deception, something I would bring to his attention should you so much as think of lying about your sobriety.” She narrowed her eyes dangerously “Of course you’re his family, but that does not grant you the right to reenter his life as a destructive force. You will drag him down should you stay for more than the immediate ceremony.”
He turned his head, denying her the kiss she moved to seek, and pushed her back; harder than he intended in his drunken haze, and she stumbled a bit, surprise on her face for a fraction of a second before she controlled her expression
(See the end of the chapter for
It was Irene Adler who had John questioning Sherlock’s claim of asexuality
“You’re aware of what I’m referring to, emotions may not be my area, but I am capable of reading yours” she said, “I know you well enough for that.”
“Sherlock, calm down…” John pleaded, the fingers clutched within her grasp turning white from lack of blood flow, and he worried vaguely they’d lose half their function by the end of the day
“Sleeping.” John replied
“Is that what it’s like for you, everyday?” he asked curiously
It was simple enough; Sherlock, John, and a few Yarders were to pose as nightclub goers, in position to gather information about the drug-trade taking place among the owners and customers
John reached into his jean pocket and did the same, replacing the silver band on his left hand before running his right hand through his hair, messing up the spikes there as the gel pulled apart
The rest of the night was a blur, and soon, before he realized it, they were in the cab ride home.
He snorted a laugh, though it quickly died when he saw no humor in her expression “You’re…. You’re serious? Of all the bloody…Sherlock, no” he shook his head, as if he couldn’t believe her
He took the rare opportunity to watch her, the subtle movements of her eyelids as she dreamed, the rise and fall of her back with every deep and even breath, her slightly parted lips looking surprisingly pink against the pale sheets of his hospital bed.
It was a quiet day, slow, no new cases and Junior sleeping comfortably in his crib in their room, the silence, while peaceful to John, only allowed her to her own thoughts
“At least now you won’t be pestered by your family, right?” John gave her a weak smile as they followed Mycroft down the hall “That’s got to be worth this whole trip”
“Shh” John held a finger to his lips, a quiet chuckle bubbling out of his chest, and Sherlock smiled, climbing up the steps two at a time
His cheeks lit up, and he looked away, coughing to clear his throat and instantly regretting that choice when junior began to cry after jotting awake
“Have your drones decided when I’ll be discharged?”
The nurse smiled, filling out the information she gathered on his chart
Her only response was a hum, which Ms. Hudson recognized as a yes and opened the door
“Bloody…” the pads of his thumbs flickered over her nipples before moving his hands down to rest on her lean waist “brilliant”
Her mind working over time to find a way to just FIX THIS, fix what they had, what they were before the test showed positive and threw them into parental responsibility she was clearly not ready for, nor ever would be
He already knew the decision Sherlock had come to, it seemed; he probably knew the answer even before she spent hours analyzing every possible scenario and choice she could make on the matter
“I still don’t see how any of this is necessary.”
Junior wrinkled his nose, shaking his head
Instantly waking up, he instinctually reached up, his hands gripping roughly into the fabric of his attackers sleeve, hunching forward and sending the surprisingly light stranger’s body over his good shoulder in a move he’d practiced dozens of times before
Mycroft’s response was the tapping of his umbrella and a half amused smile on his lips
Only one more chapter to go..
John shook his head, a smile on his lips
Rubbing of the neck, defeated slump of shoulders
The oldest of them was not a day over 12
She was in the same position. Things were moving fast, faster than her brain seemed capable of keeping up with, the sensations of his touch overwhelming her, and though she wasn’t the virgin everyone seemed to think she was, she never had an experience quite like what was happening, were a simple brush of skin on skin sent fire racing under her veins, gooseflesh over her body, and a kick in her heart
Certainly not
Adding a child, giving birth to a new life, a new addition to their flat and their lives, didn’t seem to phase her like he realized he’d hoped for since he found out she was pregnant

Anyways, comment if you like the story thus far, I love reading what you have to say
She gave a soft smile, one so rarely seen and never shown to anyone other than him
He loved the music, as long as it wasn’t waking him up on nights where he was having a decent dream, of course, and he enjoyed whenever she played at regular hours
“Aside from my drug abuse, I don’t have much else I am less than comfortable sharing. Should you decide you have a desire to learn more, I’ll answer any questions you may have,” she said, before pausing and pecking a soft kiss to his lips “In exchange you must promise to never bin my experiments while I’m out of the flat”
“No, but your demeanor says it all” she replied, getting up gracefully, like a cat after a stretch, and plucking the case file from his fingers, flipping it open to skim through it
“That doesn’t change anything!”
“Hmm?”
How anyone could cheat, lie, and betray Sherlock like that was beyond him, because they’d have to be a bloody idiot to not see her for the wonderful woman she is
He had her, up against the wall, strong hands on lean thighs, hot lips on plump ones, a growing arousal pressed against her, one she felt and noticed a few times prior, but never this way, where it’s size and need radiated off it in waves, completely unguarded and twitching with promise of where their activities could lead them
Lazily, she pulled on his boxers from their place on the floor, grabbing his horrid plaid button up and only bothering with the center three buttons, leaving the top and bottom ones undone in a way that made her look wonderfully unraveled
When he saw she was alright he felt such overwhelming relief his leg buckled out from under him and sent him crashing down onto the muddy bank on his knees

“No, I didn’t mean it like that. Just, you sure?”
“The Work is very physically demanding, yet I have not seen you attempt to keep your muscle mass. It requires effort that you didn’t seem to have put in, I was simply checking for myself if you were in adequate shape to continue being of use to me, since you have that tedious habit of leaving the shower fully clothed, and there is only so much I can see under those hideous jumpers”
Just as he was stepping out the door, ready to close it behind him, she spoke again
“She’s amazing” Molly said, her voice a bit dreamy
“I need you to teach me more advanced forms of self defense”
“I’m not her toy.” His voice was the same volume but harsher than he intended, and the area around them grew quiet at the sudden change in tension
“I do everything with this hand” he explained, raising it to show her what he meant “so every time I do something, I feel it, and a lot of times the band will move. It’s not conscious anymore but I’m checking to see if it’s still there, because I want to make sure it doesn’t fall off my finger and I lose it”
“It’s one thing for my family to judge me, another matter entirely when it’s directed towards you”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, you were flirting, and I’d prefer if you did it else where. I can’t concentrate with all Donovan’s faked laughter” she responded
As long as she stayed safe, a moth unconsumed by the lure of fire
“I didn’t always have the Work.” She continued after a short pause “before, there was nothing I could do to silence my mind. I never understood how Mycroft managed to handle all the noise” she made a frustrated sound, and his soothing hand continued it’s course, weaving strong fingers through her locks in a way he knew she found relaxing
“What was so different this time? Seems like they always bother you”
“I’m in LABOR, Mycroft!”
“About time he sees his parents at work” Sherlock smiled, proudly, something she would have hid in the past but now didn’t seem to give a toss who saw. She WAS proud of her son, after all, the little genius that was quickly on his way of being a better detective than even her
“We’re hardly usual” Sherlock countered, pulling her hair into a messy and sloppy ponytail so the curls didn’t fall into her face as much, allowing her full attention to be laser pointed onto John’s slightly pink face “besides, it’s not as if I don’t already know most of your history.”
Speedy update cause short chapter
“I assume he convinced them that any stress on my part can result in complications to their grandchild, I doubt they would risk any danger to what will more than likely be their only one”
He had no place in their world, he realized. And Jim was much closer to Sherlock than he would like to admit, able to understand her in the most twisted, and darkest of ways
She startled, like she hadn’t realized she had spoken out loud, her face flushing with embarrassment as she dropped her clipboard
“What, John?” She asked harshly, pulling away with a half assed glare
“Come now, John, surely even you noticed the tan line on her finger”
“You’re pregnant…?” John’s voice broke softly when she didn’t clarify, and it was his time to sway in his step, nearly falling over if Lestrade hadn’t caught him in time with a solid hand between his shoulder blades, his legs suddenly turned to jelly under him
“Still, I know she’s desperate but-”
“A while now; friends with Mike and everything. She always took interest in the Morgue, dead patients tell better stories, she said”
“Shit…” he groaned, moving his lips to her ear, breathing, “you’re beautiful”
“Just…No Sherlock”
“I don’t want him in this hospital! Better yet, send him out of London! Why hasn’t anyone kicked him out yet?!”
“I thought you already knew he killed them when their families couldn’t pay ransom?”
“Anything yet?” she asked, red lips formed the words, and John almost didn’t hear her watching them
“That….” John spoke, breathing heavily and resting his hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath, though his efforts fruitless for the first few huffs “Was… by far…the craziest case…we’ve ever worked…” he finished, standing up straighter and slumping back against the wall, his body unable to keep up the slight tremble of exhaustion that rode through him, craving its way into his tired bones but leaving such a delicious thumping in its wake
“Sherlock!” John hissed under his breath “the other parents will hear you!”
She clenched her teeth so hard she was surprised she didn’t break them when another contraction hit her, causing her to lean forward on the hospital bed, gripping the railing and John’s hand so tight her knuckles lost all color
But Sherlock always broke the contact, and John, as usual, would follow her lead, dropping it and never bring the subject to life, just let it hang there awkwardly. Like an elephant in the room, both could read the situation but neither able to make sense of it.
And he could say that for certain now when he didn’t have the same privilege a few hours prior
Still, this was a serious problem. One that reminded him that his love life was in the toilet and he hadn’t gotten off in…well, he didn’t even remember the last time he had a successful girlfriend, not when Sherlock demanded his attention and he’d rather run around London than spend an evening having dinner
“Why?”
She yanked open the door, and though it was no surprise to Mycroft that Sherlock would come to banish him from the flat, his face still flushed from anger and embarrassment at the sight of her, not bothering to hide his obvious distaste for his sister’s attire, or, rather, lack there of
