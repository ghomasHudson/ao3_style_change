Our men will encounter plenty of challenges. So enjoy the party, the music and the dancing. Enjoy the sweet moments these two share... and invest in some tissues.
“Who gave you the right to take my name off Rosie’s list! What in bloody hell John!” Sherlock had walked straight towards John and was currently screaming in his face.
“Yes Rosie, I will go back to the flat and pack everything. I’ll arrange something with the landlord. You will not have to go back there. You can stay in your room at home.”
John had let Rosie persuade him to let her use his phone and text Sherlock. She had insisted that she wanted him over for Sunday dinner. She wanted pizza and chicken wings. So John had handed over the phone, as they left for the park. Sherlock came as Rosie was busy playing with her neighborhood friends. The consulting detective, as always, looked impeccable, black slacks, a gray shirt and a leather jacket. John greeted him warmly and gossiped about the children Rosie was playing with and their parents. Sherlock seemed to be trying not to laugh. He was also keeping considerable distance. So John looked him in the eyes and asked, “Sherlock, is this OK?”
Once Mrs. Hudson closed the door, Sherlock put his coat and his scarf on, made sure he had cash, and hurried out. He didn’t have the strength to tell her. He let himself out into the darkened streets, 8 years 7 months, 14 days, and  “..I’m coming back...I love you...Please don’t do something stupid Bumble” Did she know? Could she feel, what he was going to do? Were they that connected?
“Of sorts. He is a doctor, a diagnostician. He can find out what ails you and how to treat it when no one else can. I was laughing because he lights up, just like you do, when he gets excited by a case, or talks about his work. He’s really a proper genius, but a holy horror to work with,” smiled Wilson, knowingly.
Also thank you for my dear readers and commentors! I'm so grateful for the reception of my humble monster, and happy that you find something enjoyable in it! Beware in this chapter, there is an Omnipotent Mycroft! This author invoked the spirit of Creative License here to be able to give Sherlock what he so richly deserved!!
Sherlock’s arms acquired a mind of their own, and started wrapping around his ex-lover. His body and the logical part of his brain shut off, and the doctor’s presence, his hands grabbing his neck, arm around his waist, his tongue in his mouth, John’s body pressed to his, possessive, allowed one thought only; John, John, John. After they had been at it for a while, a clearing of a throat and “L.I. Harris approaching, sirs.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and said, “John, though I am willing to go through with the dinner plans tonight, I will be going straight home afterwards. In the future, we should refrain from doing this sort of thing, since I feel it may be confusing for Watson. The reality is she has two distinct homes. It is better that these get togethers, not school or homework related, be kept sparse.”
John went to work, met his fellow doctors and the registrar, Sarah Sawyer, who was precisely his type of lady. Pretty, with a dry sort of humor, smart as a whip. She checked him out appreciatively, flirted openly, touching his shoulder, taking his arm to walk him through the facilities and calling him to have lunch with, supposedly to talk shop, but conversing about everything else as well. John was happy to interact, but was surprised about how reserved he was being. His first thought was of Sherlock. How wonderful he was. How much smarter, how much more interesting and beautiful than anyone else. God, what was his life?
He had moved out of 221B, of course. John could not have withstood these past months living among Sherlock’s things. Plus, if he had stayed, it would have looked too much like he was waiting for Sherlock to return from the dead.
I smiled fleetingly in wonder. He looked down at my hand, and then into my eyes. His pupils widened even as I watched, his jaw clenched. He was definitely turned on, but he was also… scared?
It was like there had been a pressure inside his head that had filled up with anger and nonsense. And with the touch of Sherlock’s lips, the pressure suddenly gave way, dissipated and John felt lightheaded.
John shifted into immediate supplication, hands balling into fists at his side. He was ready for a mission, a purpose, something to do in order to restore Sherlock’s self-assured, razor-sharp focus.
“It’s Lennon,” he announced before quickly reading the text, and then standing and speaking in rapid succession, “She can inspect it tonight. She’s at the lab. And... I can make the train if I go now.”
He was full to bursting with tension. He needed a lay. With that thought, his mind shied away from a vague memory of Sherlock in nothing but a sheet. He felt a blush creep up to his ears, and shook his head.
Sherlock steps up, and I’m surprised at how much restraint he shows over the next hour, going into details and answering even the stupidest questions that might have provoked a scathing remark even from me. In short, he’s being the exact opposite of every time I’ve ever seen him deal with police forces before, and I can’t figure out whether that’s part of his cover identity or a sign of how desperately he wants everything to go right on this case.
really been just an actor, what reason would he have had to shoot himself after everything came out? It was the role of his lifetime, and there probably would have been dozens of roles waiting for him. And it was suicide, even Anderson would have seen that. I saw the corpse. It would have taken you at the height of your game to fake it.”
“You may go, Mr. Poirot. But please, do stay in town, in case anyone comes up with better questions to ask than this idiot.”
He leads Sherlock into a small office that has far too many computers in it for my liking. I remain standing in the doorway just in case, to avoid any further mishaps.
“Dinner, a shower and some good, hot tea. Not necessarily in that order. A change of clothes and possibly a few hours of sleep before going back into the fray. Think those are possible?”
“You do look too proper to be looking for drugs on the street. We’re not exactly the same size enough to be sharing disguises, though. Might have to buy something. Possibly something ratty and garish, to underline the cluelessness.”
He seems to slump down on himself, suddenly appearing much smaller and more vulnerable than I’ve ever seen him before.
In the early hours of morning, after some hours of sleep in a real bed and some more tea, Harry reprograms the portkey I used yesterday to go back to its last location. I’m afraid of Sherlock becoming suspicious of any stumbling noise I might make while I land, but while he does glance over his shoulder for a moment, he obviously believes the sounds to come from the next room when he sees nothing. He turns back to his chart quickly.
We stumble back into our hotel room giggling madly, as we’re so often prone to do when our adrenaline levels crash after something big. More than two hours I had to wait for Sherlock’s return, as one of the guards kept lurking in the hallway in front of the door. The wait drove both of us to the brink, but we’ve struck gold to show for it. From what little Sherlock told me so far, he’s found just about everything he needs to solve this thing, and he’s made sure to note down all of it.
“You’re planning something, JD. Please tell me you’re not using an old woman’s grief for some stupid plot, as you always complained about Sherlock doing. I will not let you pick up his morals just to save him.”
“Weird. Completely, utterly weird, even weirder than the bus ride there, and very exhausting. And I think we might end up travelling through most of Central Europe before we solve even this one case.”
“I’d love to, but… I met someone at the museum this morning. We’re going out for dinner, maybe dancing after.”
“John’s parents raised me for a while. Our mothers were sisters. But… my parents were part of a pretty reclusive sect, and they made sure I’d be drawn into that. Paid for a sect-run school at my birth and everything.”
Sherlock stays still, watching them. It’s a good plan, too, and one that would enable him to brief Alexey on our other plan, especially if he leaves the door-opening to me. Niedermayr seems unconvinced, but more and more of his team argue in favor of it, and finally, he relents, on the condition of Sherlock not being armed so he won’t endanger any of the team if something goes wrong.
Out in the staircase, I set out to repeat my escape plan from earlier today, but this time I miscalculate. I accidentally step onto the first step further upstairs, and Sherlock whips around at the sound it makes. He listens for a moment and glances up and down the stairs frantically. I freeze. When no further sign of life comes, he closes the door behind him as quietly as he can, then heads down the stairs. I wait for a while after he leaves. This time, I know at least one place he’s going – back to the hostel and his things.
“Verdammter Verräter!” [Bloody traitor!], he bellows, and on instinct I step in front of Sherlock and the boy. I draw my own gun while making sure to block his line of aim. I’m not sure which one  of them he’s aiming at, but I’d do this for either one. I did swear to shoot this guard on our previous visit, and I don’t even hesitate. We both fire at the same time, and Alexey screams.
Either way, this time we take the metro to the very last stop instead of going on an exhausting bus trek, and again reach a business park on the outskirts of town. It’s as far away from Lake Geneva and the posh areas around it as you could possibly go without leaving the city. Sokolov probably would have fit right in in those parts of the city, and belatedly, I remember that note on Sherlock’s case-chart: “<50 miles from wealthy city”. Geneva is one of the wealthiest cities in Europe, with an unusually high number of foreigners living there, and so is Lausanne itself, hosting the IOC and other huge international organizations. Sherlock is probably betting on the theory that this role might be exactly the sort of client these houses expect.
“I don’t sound like you. Is this better? Hello, my name is John Watson. No. Hello, Mrs. Hudson, so good to see you.”
I smile, remembering just how much not silent Sherlock was and is always prone to make things, and how much Mrs. Hudson usually reacted to it.
I want to congratulate her on her acting, but I bite back any foolish remark I might make. We really did pick the right person for this, and Sherlock’s been priming her on Russian language and culture all day yesterday and this morning. Mycroft nods briskly.
Another way in which Sherlock is family by now. He has been playing with Remus-under-the-couch for hours this morning, and the young tom loved it. To be honest, I think both of them did.
“My father needs new passport pictures”, Sherlock explains smoothly, and I glare at him. I’m only six years older than him, though it does look more like twenty the way we are currently dressed.
I notice she’s not including Mycroft in that, and I can’t help but agree strongly. Sherlock gives her one of those wicked smiles I love so much.
When she picked me up three days later, she had somehow changed my complete paperwork to the name of John Watson. All the school documents, even my boxing history. Of course, as I had almost expected from her sense of humor, she’d food the loophole in our agreement and saddled me with an utterly ridiculous middle name, but I couldn’t even be mad at that. She’d sold her godfather’s magical townhouse on the outskirts of London and used the proceeds as well as most of her inheritance to afford us a smaller property more centrally in the city, far away from suburbs like the one we grew up in and from anywhere the wizarding world might look for her. Neither of us brought much from our old lives, and we settled in quickly and found a routine. I kept up my boxing to keep in shape, and she started knitting, supplying me with an endless stream of sweaters that I proudly wore and quickly figured out to have more to them than the average store-bought.
“Oh, I don’t know. Maybe the fact that us Watsons are just as loyal as we are stubborn, or the fact that we’d never let anyone close to us go into battle without looking out for their safety any way we can? Maybe the fact that you’re a sentimental fool whop couldn’t help but take a memento, and managed to choose the tracker I placed on you after I was almost too late to save you on our first case together, or that I swore back then to protect you better in the future?”
“I suddenly feel so inadequate”, she says softly. “Both of you have languages you can communicate with him in, and I… I basically dropped out of school at eleven, never got to learn a language, and the few words of Arabic I picked up at work are totally useless.”
Sherlock doesn’t hesitate before ascending, and I time every one of my steps to fall simultaneously with his. A man who looks too young to mastermind anything worthy of Sherlock Holmes’ attention waits in a doorway on the next floor. Then again, James Moriarty was not all that much older than the apparent late twenties of this man, maybe a few years younger than Sherlock’s late thirties, and he’d been heading an international criminal network for years when he died. Anything is possible.
He was standing alone in silence, staring into a small, neglected hallway, somewhere in the bowels of his palace, near memories of food, sleep, adolescence and childhood.
Before John could really appreciate the moment, something made him doubt what he was seeing. Sherlock hadn’t spoken. John hadn’t hallucinated Sherlock since he had found the hidden note, but perhaps this was too good to be true.
“I assumed that you wouldn’t leave his side to take care of… things,” Mycroft wafted a manicured finger as if to encompass all of Sherlock, “So here you are…” – Mycroft stared at Sherlock. Sherlock stared back. – “Take the gift Sherlock, if not for your sake, then for John’s. Because he will wake.”
When John raised his gaze to Sherlock’s face, his friend’s silver-green eyes were bright, and his breathing had increased under John’s scrutiny.
One nurse prepared a sedative and administered it in one swift push through the needleless port on his IV. John’s eyes fluttered open, unseeing, swinging from one side of the room to the other before closing again. He pulled at the ankle and wrist restraints, and then strained less and less until he was boneless and panting.
“Someone! Come here, help him!” Sherlock shouted, restraining John as best he could. The doctor, his best friend, his stubborn self-appointed protector was savagely strong for such a compact man. Particularly in the throes of a nightmare.
Sherlock shook his head once, almost imperceptibly. He squeezed his eyes shut tighter as he tucked his chin down, hiding his face in the fringe of his hair. He was transported into his mind palace, but he hardly recognized the corridor in which he found himself.
John entered the room then, with Mycroft in tow. Sherlock smiled. “Of course, you had to have your hands in this, brother.”
Molly had taken John’s car keys. When he woke up from a kip, he found she had put Rosie to bed, and covered him with a blanket. He got up, went to the kitchen, spying the liquor cabinet.
He continued, “Granted, their road to this altar has been a roller coaster, but they are here today, thanks to the strength and the dedication of their love and devotion for each other. So now, to the mortification of my friend Sherlock, I will proceed with the full and even elongated ceremony. Starting with the rights and privileges of marriage. You have the right to be happy and content, after all the sacrifices you have made for one another. You have the right to continue to fight together against crime and injustice. You have the right to be each other’s home and comfort. You have the privilege of having each other to have and to hold, even after a time out, a recess, a recoup. Now you are stronger and have each proven yourself to the other. It is my pleasure to have introduced you and a true privilege to marry you. At this time the older, shorter groom has asked for a minute to speak, so everyone take one to stretch before he gets started as people his age tend to go on and on”
“Because it’s unlike any other alexandrite I have ever seen or heard of. What’s most remarkable is the moissanite! Trace amounts of moissanite, too. More than I think is normal, a much, much, much higher percentage than it has any right to be. I am not an astrogeologist. But it is odd, to me even, that alexandrite and moissanite should even be formed like this. It’s from another star system entirely! I would dare say that this pendant would shake the scientific world on levels I can’t myself begin to express.”
Still holding the tuning peg in one hand, he cracked open the paper, and read the note. And again. And again. Again until he felt an hour had passed. His heart was thudding hard in his chest, as if he’d been in a race. His eyes could not seem to focus on anything but the note. He looked wildly about, a blur. Then back to the note.
And quite fetching, Sherlock surmised to himself, not suppressing the thought as he usually would. Instead he allowed it to roll around freely within his mind, as casual as you please. Interesting sensation. He continued conversation, surprised at his newfound equilibrium.
I turned and saw the snow just begin to fall outside, saw the police and people begin to dissipate, back into the motion of their lives.
John was suddenly very interested. There had been rumors, and he thought a letter had been declassified some years ago. He never read it, too busy running about London with his maniac flatmate. He did not want to think about Sherlock at all.
John was amazed. He moved his gaze to the bloke two seats down from him. The man’s hat was heavily decorated in army paraphernalia, his face weathered and hanging like battered canvas. His nose and ears were a little overgrown for his pleasant features, the unavoidable effects of gravity on cartilage as everyone ages.
A paramedic chose that moment to approach, holding a blanket and a medical bag, “Excuse me, do you need treatment, ma’am?”
He swept out of the sandwich shop into the curtain of snow that was falling over London. I was a step or so behind, holding tight to my neglected beverage. I waited behind him as he used the key to unlock the door to the flat. The snow settled in his hair and on his shoulders. Our breaths now blossomed white before us.
“Right. He gonna be okay, you think?” Lestrade gestured to Sherlock who had already begun to leave, and now was waiting patiently on the other side of the crime scene tape. “He seemed pretty shook up.”
John gave an unconscious lick of his lips, and submitted Sherlock to a full-body, head-to-toe/toe-to-head look over before answering in similar, soft, meaningful tones, “Whaddya got?”
With the last of her energy, she tried to Step in order to save herself, and regenerate, but she found her body just could not do it. Something was interfering with her ability to move to another Intersection. The arrowhead, she realized too late, was the cause. It was made of localized Star Stone.
There was no doubt about it. Sherlock was the masked dancer: lithe, long and perfect. Bewitching. Shocking. John all but ran out of the theater to the sounds of hundreds of people cheering, in awe of his flatmate’s body… and the spectacle of it. Holy hell.
What would it be like? The Kiss? The sex? Their Life? What was in store for them? Whatever it was, Sherlock thought as he raised John’s hand to his lips, it would be Forever.
“You know, John, I feel I must confess something,” Mrs. Hudson wrung her thin hands together. John swallowed, forcing his eyes not to glance at the box on the desk. Had she seen?
Mycroft managed to look amused as well as bored. How did he do that? John’s frustration gave way to a calm deadliness. Mycroft’s smile was a dark thing that provoked John’s rage like nothing else.
Jack finished off his beer with a satisfied smack of his lips and a thunk of the beer bottle on the counter top. He turned fully to John now, right side of his body leaning against the bar, “So, what’d you do in the army?”
She shook her head and tutted at the mess. She was peppered with snow about her shoulders. It was just starting to melt. I looked around for Sherlock but he had disappeared for the moment. I looked back at the elephant, and stared.
Was Sherlock going to ignore my blunder? The kissing? Was he not going to address it? If so, I wish I could do the same. I wish that could be enough. I wanted it to be enough, to just slip right back into my place at his side. My place? Aw, holy hell. I shook my head to myself as I watched Sherlock order.
It took longer than he’d like for him to recognize the man who stood before him. Then again, how often did an internationally famous rock star visit one’s doorstep? The leather jacket was nothing short of iconic, the long, bleached blonde hair was tied back in a truncated ponytail. Large, black sunglasses shielded most of his unshaven face. They did not, however, hide the “beauty mark” that confirmed his identity.
He had continued to see his therapist every other week. Leaving out, of course, Sherlock’s status as a living human being as opposed to a corpse. At the behest of John, they had been working on his aversion to identifying as anything but straight. Twelve sessions later, and John did not think they had made much progress. He hadn’t experienced a breakthrough, per se`. They had talked about Harry, and her wife. They had talked endlessly about his parents attitude towards homosexuality, his father’s alcoholism, and the shame his catholic school upbringing had programmed into him.
“Well I had a lot of time on my hands, didn’t I? I confess it was Douglas’ idea at first. Stupid Douglas couldn’t write a decent note, and kept making the same spelling errors. He was giving himself away, you know? Truthfully I was quite done with him by that point. However, I tempepd at a computer programming office and the bloke who worked there wanted to impress me by telling me he had collaborated with the government, MI5, I believe, by looking up delicate information. On a lark, I gave him your partner’s name, and Mary Elizabeth Watson popped up. After a bit of eyelash flitting it was easy to get him to unearth her history for me. He was delighted to. I confess I found it fascinating, all that lurid history.
While they were ordering drinks, Molly came in looking very pretty. She didn’t recognize Billy, whose eyes went soft. “Hello, Dr.Hooper” he said.
Also thank you for all the beautiful people that check the story out, read it, look forward to it and leave lovely kudos and the best comments! All of you make this an amazing experience and now I want to go write some more so we can meet again once this Monster is done! Thank you!!
“That will never happen. You will never have Sherlock. You would have to fight me, and you have no idea just how savage I can get to protect him. You don’t know what you are getting yourself into, targeting Sherlock. He is not alone. He has friends and people who love him. There is a whole army of people on our side. You are alone. Paid thugs and assassins need the money. We have the most vicious motivator of all. Stay the fuck away from Sherlock, if you want to stay alive.”
Sherlock muttered something, gave Luther a quick kiss goodbye and left, without being able to thank him, for picking him, for being kind and understanding, for not expecting what Sherlock couldn’t offer. And he had understood. Yes, it was John. He couldn’t carry on with Luther when he had been calling John out loud and in his mind all along. John who now seemed intent on texting him and waiting around at Mrs. Hudson when he dropped Rosie off so Sherlock had to see him. Sherlock would not falter, though. He had no intention to be John’s fallback when he was in between girlfriends.
The man clucked his tongue. “Don’t even remember me, Captain Watson? I’m hurt! But then again, you were always so ‘holier than thou’, weren’t you? Alright. We’re done. The Boss said ‘don’t kill him, I want to make him dance first’, but since
“I’m so glad we finally got to get together mate! It’s been a right while!” Greg slapped John’s good shoulder heartily. “Looks like you were trying to scam me out of my pints!”
In reality, there was little Mycroft Holmes would not do for Rosie Watson. They were fast friends. Rosie had long ago expressed to him an interest in learning how to be The English Government, so they would talk about countries near and far.
A year or so after the incident, Sherlock started to show a budding interest in solving crime, the first opportunity coming in the form of the drowning of one Carl Powers, Sherlock was adamant he had been murdered, as his shoes never appeared. Mycroft had not investigated the occurrence, as at the time he was at Cambridge. Little brother managed to alert the authorities in school and in the town to his suspicions.
“I need you John, I’ve always wanted you, only you.” Their kiss was sweet and gentle; a hello, an ‘are you alright?’, a ‘there you are’. John guided Sherlock back to their room, a gentle hand on the small of his back. He turned the lights low, liking the warmth of them, and took Sherlock’s face in his hands, getting on tiptoes to kiss him. Sherlock smiled and started unbuttoning John’s shirt. John took Sherlock’s off him and opened his belt, his trousers, explored his torso with his hands, and felt a knot in his throat, because this was so familiar, but had not happened in almost a year and a half, this loving, domestic ritual of a happy couple.
“Well look at you.” John said, looking at him admiringly, “thinking of your friend.” John said, looking at him affectionately.
That day Sherlock was back on the case of the poisoned homeless, which was proving to be harder than he originally thought, now that they had found a second body, apparently killed in the same manner.  While the method of delivery was the same as before, the victim was a different demographic, and the drug was different too. He was trying to isolate one elusive component when Molly came in to talk to Allen. When she finished with him, Sherlock approached her;
“Can I ask something that has nothing to do with traveling?” Alison piped up. “Since you and Rosie are here?”
The boy deflected the older one’s punch, and hit him on the kidney instead. Before the big man could take a breath, the boy clapped the man’s face, pulling his ears, punched his jaw, and delivered two hard punches to his solar plexus. As the man wobbled trying to catch his breath, the boy hit his jaw again, dislocating it. Then he took a step back, raised both his arms, almost like a dancer, getting ready to twirl, and brought them down forcefully, while delivering a powerful kick to the man’s lower chest, rendering him unconscious.
John looked confused. “Sherlock? What is going on?” His detective was walking around in front of Lizbeth, wearing his annoying, knowing, smirk.
“Well, you are certainly in love, and in a renewed relationship. However, you have been working hard to overcome those feelings of having to curb your love for a man, for your man. I think you really want to be proud of being in a homosexual, committed relationship. This allows you to let go of the need to punish Sherlock for ‘making you love him’.“
“Well, he did use to call me ‘love’. He did say, sometime close to the beginning. He would usually say ‘You know how I feel’.”
I nod slowly. This is an offer I’d be a fool to refuse, more than I ever expected from her. She’s quite obviously willing to risk a lot, just to ensure I make it back home safely.
“Is it okay if I don’t want to go any further than this for a while? You do owe me a favor, I believe. I’d be willing to use that.”
Harry smiles at her. The old lady is probably trying to cheer me up in her own unique way with this stunt, but the only thing I can think about is how the hell I’m supposed to hitch a ride in that thing while staying invisible. Harry does not seem to share my thoughts.
That night, I dream of Sherlock, of running and giggling and diving for cover. Of shared smiles and quick touches in the middle of firefights.
The dining room is set up in the only room without windows, and has always been our top choice for any discussion that absolutely had to remain a secret from the rest of the world. Originally born from Harry’s post-war paranoia, it has gotten a lot of use ever since I met Mycroft Holmes, who still seems to not have figured out anything wrong with our cover identities. Just like in the hallway, here we can plan however much we want to, no matter who is watching our house.
“Use the cloak. Leave the report on his desk, hide it in a book or something, and watch him freak out at the security breach.”
I sit down in a corner quietly and listen to the heated discussion three of his roommates are having on one of the top bunkbeds. The two girls are probably American college students, judging from their age and accents, the East Asian boy seems to be a few years later. They are grumbling about the new drug laws that prohibit the take-out sale of recreational drugs to foreigners. The legendary coffee shops now only allow the in-store consumption of the Dutch favorite drug through diffusers, and these kids are vastly disappointed. I smile. Some things never change. When Harry and I were here at their age, most of our travel group spent a lot of time with sort of thing, too, though we never felt the draw of it ourselves.
Eventually, I find a place to don the invisibility cloak again, and we got to meet an IT specialist already waiting for Djamil. Again, Sherlock has prepared the memory stick he gives him with a slow-acting, sleep-inducing contact poison, but this time, he does not have to guess how long it might take to work. I stay inside the flat invisibly when Sherlock leaves, and call him back in as soon as the man passes out two hours later. This time, we grab enough information for at least three more large cases, including the illegal arms trading one Sherlock already noticed when we last came here. It will probably become our next case.
“I don’t want fake IDs. I need something that passes a police database check, something that easily makes it through airport security. My former business partner had to leave England rather quickly, and he claims you played a rather large part in helping him get out of Europe with all the appropriate secrecy. Unfortunately, the main venue he suggested I go through was shut down last year, but I would ask you for the same services you provided for them.”
I spend most of the morning reading and occasionally forcing a new cup of tea heavily spiked with cream and sugar on Sherlock. I know from experience that he’ll refuse any other type of sustenance until this rush of case is over, and he refused my offer of help as well. Going back between the case-chart and his mind palace trying to sort all the possibilities, it is after noon when he finally speaks.
“No. Just… no. I want something completely, utterly normal. Like… John. Yeah, John’s goof. And an utterly common family name for both of us, so we stick out even less. Maybe… yeah, maybe even the same family name for both of us, I think I’d like that.”
“Oxana isn’t related to me”, I cut in. “Our mother had an affair right after I was born, so Harry’s really only my half-sister, though we’ve never cared about that.”
Almost exactly twenty-four hours later, Jegor Sokolov and I are leaving a similar hotel in Lausanne. The train ride was uneventful, and I even found a free seat in Sherlock’s compartment and could relax, if not sleep for most of the journey. Sherlock spent most of the day at the hotel brooding over his chart, then contemplating on which role to play this time. It was obvious even to me that the Arab guy from last time was out, as the two guards might have warned the rest of their network about him, but the Russian aristocrat wouldn’t have been my first choice either. Sherlock probably has a reason for choosing such a flashy, easily-recognized role. Maybe he just wants to finally have an excuse to put those ridiculous sideburns into storage and never wear them again?
“Just that cloak.” It’s not even a lie – any other magical item Harry might have, she either bought or made herself, and even if I could think of anything else useful, I wouldn’t want to betray her secrets. “But if we find out where the information we need is hidden, it might help us get it.”
We are led up the stairs, into a long stretch of hallway, and the guard opens one of the doors. Inside the room is a woman, small and dark, and most importantly almost naked. I really don’t want Sherlock near any naked woman ever again – he really doesn’t have the best of luck with those. A naked Irene Adler led to a lot a trouble for both of us, and what happened in Lyon was not the slightest bit better. But I have no choice. I have to let him do this.
It was good to see him again, though I didn’t quite feel comfortable sharing much about my current troubles. He figured out the obvious problem of my living situation regardless. Though he didn’t know the real reason why living outside the city scared me so much, he knew I’d want to stay here if possible in any way, and suggested finding a house-share. In hindsight, that’s where I made the biggest mistake I could have made – and possible the simultaneously best and most dangerous mistake of my life. My half-joke that nobody could survive living with me was supposed to refer to my physical and mental health, and Mike’s counter left me utterly flabbergasted. He had heard the same thing from someone else that day, and only ten minutes later, I met the most interesting man of my life. I met Sherlock Holmes.
“Me, too, Mrs. Hudson. “You were right, you know – you were never our housekeeper, even though Sherlock sometimes treated you that way. You were our friend, and one of the most important people in Sherlock’s life.”
“Do you think he can deal with that in the long run? He always acts like the great big sociopath who can do anything for a case, but… he’s so much more empathic than everyone thinks, and so tetchy about letting people touch him… I don’t want him to break on this.”
I spill most of the vodka over the atrocious cardigan, then light half a dozen cigarettes at once. I have never smoked in my life, and I don’t intend to start now. Instead, I move them around next to my clothes until they are burned up, then repeat the process twice more until the pack is empty. I hope it will be enough. As a last touch, I open the beer, spilling some of it down my front and drinking a large gulp, both for my nerves and to make my breath smell of it. The rest of the can, I will keep in hand for additional effect, to show even from afar that this man has definitely been drinking.
“Danke, dass ihr alle pünktlich wart. Ich gehe davon aus, dass ihr mittlerweile mit dem Vorbericht vertraut seid, worum es in diesem Fall geht.“ Most of the people in the room mutter some form of agreement. “Ich möchte euch unseren französischen Kollegen Jacques Poirot vorstellen. Seinem Team verdanken wir die Informationen in diesem Bericht. Er wird uns auf dieser Razzia begleiten.“
“You still haven’t figured anything out, have you? Harry did get a kick out of those ridiculous notions you had. She’s never touched alcohol in her life. And you’ll be back here by tonight. I promise.”
Two policemen in full gear appear behind the guard as I fall to my knees, and I really hope the cloak is falling right to cover me completely as I try to roll out of the way in my fall.
[This is the bullet the bad man shot at you and Sherlock. It’s to remind you that we’re all a family and will look after you.]
We talk through the rest of the battle plan again, and I modify Sherlock’s ideas by making him take both his scarf and my gun, just in case. Not taking my backpack feels wrong, but I do realize it would not fit the image I’m trying to portray. It’s not all that late yet, but I think both of us are too fraught with nerves to stay at the hotel any longer. It will be a new method of investigation for either of us, and we decide on another bit of practice, this time for both of us.
“Are you sure you want to go through with this?”, I hear Sherlock ask right next to me. “Might be dangerous.”
One week is how long it will be until he needs to be in Amsterdam for that appointment he made, and I’m really hoping he’ll take that time to recuperate. He could need some rest, and I’d like to see how the whole Alexey thing turns out before we head into battle again.
“You’ve already figured out one of the major sources of problems. Flip back that hood and listen to me. Be careful not to uncover any of your extremities, especially when it’s windy. The cloak reacts like any other piece of fabric, it will follow the wind. Don’t run if at all possible, or you will uncover your feet. I was really glad it was already dark and you were distracted when we ran earlier, or I might have gotten into serious trouble. Don’t open doors when someone might see them open on their own and come to investigate. Especially be careful of automatic doors, they might betray you. Don’t let the cloak catch on anything.”
“You are an evil man, John Watson”, Sherlock whispers in my ear softly when she’s gone, and I grin broadly. The contents of my glass keep decreasing without me touching it, so Sherlock has obviously figured out how to use the straw. It was probably why he ordered a mixed drink, too. When the glass is empty, I decide the day has been long enough for both of us. Sherlock seems to agree, as he follows me quietly all the way back to the hotel. If I wouldn’t check on the scarf periodically, I wouldn’t even know he’s there.
“I’ll have to mail it from Germany”, Sherlock scowls. “He’d notice a British post mark, even if I do hate the extra shipping time that will take.”
“Mycroft still thinks that I’m holed up at my sister’s place mourning your loss and betrayal. I’m not even convinced he knows what country you’re currently in. Don’t worry Sherlock, nobody but the two of us knows either of us is here.”
“Bitte! Sagt mir wenigstens, wann ihr wieder was da habt! Oder wo ich sonst was bekommen kann. Bitte…“
“You look like an aging biker whose wife made him shave and get a haircut”, Sherlock says dryly. “I’m not kissing you while you wear that.”
„He might be right. If they hear us breaking down the door, the might try to shoot as many children as possible to eliminate witnesses, or try to get rid of evidence somehow. If Mr. Poirot can open the door for us…”
“English, please. Kriminalhauptkommissar Jakob Niedermayr, Interpol contact for the Bundespolizei in Munich. May I come in?“
As the door closes, he asks for the woman’s name first in French, then in English, but she signals incomprehension either time. This does not bode well for gathering information. From the look of her, I’d guess her to be from Northeastern Africa, somewhere around Somalia, Eritrea, or maybe Ethiopia. She has that sort of look about her rather than further south. Apparently, Sherlock has made his own deductions, for he pulls her into his arms from behind. With his face hidden in her bushy hair, he quietly speaks to her in a soft language I feel I’ve never heard before. Definitely not the Arabic I’d have expected him to try next. I know he speaks quite a few languages, but I would have guessed them to only be languages with probable application in international context, not something so uncommon.
I put some meat into my mouth and start chewing, then another bite. It gives me time to think. Unlike Sherlock, who constantly complains about food slowing down his thought processes, keeping my jaw muscles busy always seems to help me concentrate. Then again, it is probably a good thing Sherlock has never picked up that habit for himself – the only thing annoying police officers at a crime scene more than Sherlock Holmes and his deductions might just be a Sherlock chewing gum while he makes deductions at a crime scene. The mental image alone has made me grin at inappropriate times on a few occasions.
“Goodbye, John”, he says, but I don’t return the greeting. He sighs in defeat and walks to the car waiting for him.
“You haven’t eaten in three days. Now that you know I’m here, I intend to make sure you don’t starve yourself every time you’re on a case. Especially when they go on this long.”
Lost? Alone and no way to communicate. Did he take a bad turn, or did Mike give him the wrong directions? John is walking through the worst part of London, just getting to the avenue. Then there is an incident, he can't stay away from. Many against one, he has to help. He meets the most amazing, fantastic person. He is in awe. Can't resist this gorgeous, genius, mad person. That he is also a man turns out to not be an issue. John will listen to Sherlock's deductions and ideas. He will give him a place to stay. Help him take care of his health issues. It will become clear, that for John, Sherlock is quickly becoming the most important person in his life.
“First of all. Congratulations are due. To you, Rosie, for your solo, and to the three of you for this step you are taking. I would like you to go over the paperwork. It’s necessary to ascertain that the facts are correct. This document here, John allows addressing of the name issue.”
Mrs Hudson knew John well. Though he was trying to appear casual, he was actually jealous enough to have made Shepard pie, and come over to interrogate her about him.
On a night like tonight, Luther almost wanted to throw caution to the wind and tell Sherlock he did want a relationship, that what they had could be so much better if they took one more step. It could be great, but  Iyana’s face kept coming up; both how she had been when she was just a girl and she told him she loved him for the first time, and when she told him he was free to go, to have his midlife crisis looking for men, since she was no longer enough. Luther knew he was not the only one with conflicted feelings towards his ex. That did not stop him from drying Sherlock’s tears, taking him home, in spite of his weak protests that he had to go back to Baker Street. They came together gently, softly, trying to erase the hurt his ex had left behind, like open wounds.
by your posture, your italian suit, your attitude, and your ‘concern’ for Sherlock, that you are his brother Mycroft. Everything you said about me is correct. What happened today was not Sherlock’s fault. We were packing up our things from my bedsit, to take to Baker Street, when Sherlock was taken. The particulars about it are for Sherlock to disclose to you. Now if you would allow me, I would like to find out how he’s doing.”
The River Boys opened the floor with “Better When I’m Dancing”. Watching John’s unbridled happiness, the way his eyes shined and his laughter reached them easily, watching his Watson dancing with Pepsi, laughing as Nyla attacked them with a bubble gun, he could stop telling himself that a wedding was unnecessary or insignificant, or dumb. That John had done this, was everything.
They had parted today with something feeling lighter between them, that they could still work on something together, still laugh. John had been delighted to see Sherlock was not being the cold, aloof machine he had been during the last bit of their relationship, and the first weeks of their separation. Sherlock had made it clear he did not care what John did. Hadn’t demonstrated a bit of discomfort when John had his boxes ready and moved out.
“Well, I don’t have actual cravings anymore. They only came upon due to what I thought I wanted at the time. Now that Watson and I can still have our days together, I don’t really want to...I want to be here for her.”  He said. “I do still think about it, that an end might have been easier for all involved, but I will not do that to my girl. My thought processes are still off. I’m always tired. But how talking about it in a cold office with a pompous stranger can possibly help, eludes me.” Sherlock sighed
“But that is the way you started anyway, right? He’ll come around, John. You two have to end up together. You have been through way too much.”
“He did at the party. Sherlock blushed - he literally blushed, Molly.” Another drink, before Molly even had the chance to see it.
At that, Sherlock got up, put on his robe, and went to the kitchen. John heard a “Yes!” He heard Sherlock moving about and got up and dressed to find him putting the kettle on. “Not just our refrigerator, John. Look!” He pointed at the oven, then went to the fridge and took out the makings of a salad. “Shepherd's Pie!” John found some red wine and they had dinner. Sherlock found her bread and butter pudding, so they also had dessert. Then they each showered,  dressed and went out, to walk around the neighborhood, in the warm evening.
“We have some talking that should have been done a long time ago. Only never, in my wildest dreams, did I ever think it would be me listening to you, and not the other way around.”
John is on a case with Sherlock, and though there are no more international webs of evil, there is excitment, a chase and a just reward. Also a little glimpse of something Sherlock purposefully started.
- Breakfast date? Day after tomorrow, cycling first. Will supply track bike and helmet. Then crepes.
Right across it, there was a guest room that was similar, though a little smaller. There was a space in front of the rooms, that had a long window seat, with plush cushions on it. There was Rosie’s easel, a target with magnetic darts, and various board games.
“Yep, woman, teacher broke her foot in three places. She’ll need surgery and weeks of bed rest and crutches”
The next day, after morning conferences, had John again looking for Sherlock all over the resort. He wasn’t answering his mobile, his messages. John had looked in the buffet, at the pool, now he was looking along the shore. He saw a man raise a hand and walked towards him. It was Wilson. He crouched down, his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders. Something had happened. John started running.  Sherlock was crouching on the sand next to Wilson. He failed to acknowledge John in any way. Wilson put his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder and said. “You can call me if you want that ride, alright Sherlock? Just, you’ll have to give me directions as we go.”  Sherlock hummed in response.
And as for Curt’s impression of John, well, he was pretty sure John was eager for his departure. Jealous? Or just protective? Maybe both. Curt had a gut feeling that John was in the dark regarding the sexual nature of his past relationship with Sherlock. Curt figured that was probably for the best.
I glanced up at him, and he looked absolutely flabbergasted, flustered in such a way that it gave me an odd calming confidence. I shrugged with one shoulder, “Listen, I don’t expect you to do anything, but that’s partly why I came over. I needed you to know.”
The woman was in her late forties, and her olive skin betrayed some Mediterranean descent. She looked as if she belonged in the place, black hair swept in waves around her open face. She was tastefully dressed, but managed to look exotic. John would have turned the charm on, once upon a time, but all he felt was a jittery sort of anxiety.
“You’ve just fixed your hair, and managed a poor job of straightening your suit. Why, brother dear, you are positively rumpled. What have you been up to?”
When John’s eyes met his, Sherlock’s thought process began to blink on and off, as if defaulting to archaic computer code, 1s and 0s.
Mrs. Hudson looked wistful, as if steeped in golden memory, “Curt and Sherlock were two peas in a pod…” she trailed off as if editing something rather unsavory. She looked uncertainly at John, her hands wrung together.
Sherlock finally answered with a barely suppressed urgency, “I can’t downplay this, the danger in which I find myself. The danger that you face now is much less than it once was. I have seen to it. You have to do your very best not to let on… to anyone.”
“She told me what you’ve done for us,” John replied, emotion draining from him, leaving him exhausted, empty. He stepped away from Sherlock’s brother, walked away to the box on the desk and set the note and the piece of violin inside.
He cursed into the fire, and felt guilt for the horrible thought. He did not do well with idle time. Idleness swallowed and corroded him as surely as any disease. He would just have to not be idle, then. He would try… for Sherlock. Sherlock had saved him, after all, hadn’t he? The berk.
He must have dozed off. Something woke him. The ice in the tumbler had melted. He had fallen asleep in the chair, glass sitting on his knee. John set the glass aside, and the electronic tittering sound that had woken him repeated in the stillness. The fire had banked down to a few, orange tongues of flame in a bed of scarlet embers.
John was appreciative of the cover of the awning. He was shivering now, and noticed that Lestrade was shivering, too.
“I would rather skip the obvious, John,” he intoned in that quintessential, curt way of his, and then continued rather simply, “I am here if you… want.”
“Something like that. I’m part of the taskforce going in. My specialty is securing any computers and parts during the raid to make sure no evidence is lost.”
“Alright, let’s try this out around town, get you into some interesting situations to see how you manage. Please try to stay close to me and give me some sort of signal if there is any problem. First time always poses some difficulties. And wear your scarf, please!”
“Why, Molly Hooper, of course. She not only helped me fake my death, that ‘convenient leave of absence”, as you so eloquently put it, was actually used to help me prepare and get me out of the country without even Mycroft’s attention. He would have tried to stop me. But still, well done. Don’t worry, even I sometimes get a thing or two wrong. And I did not realize that they would have Mycroft identify me again after Molly already did.”
this is where the non-con and forced prostitution warnings start to apply. Sherlock's investigation is turning dark, and it will only get worse until the end. Please feel warned and if you are easily triggered, do go and read something else.
When we get back to the hotel, Sherlock immediately returns to his chart, rapidly filling out not only some of the papers he has already placed on the chart, but also numerous new ones he again grabs from the hotel notepad. Many of them go around the edges of the mat, and strings in various colors follow. When he has finally completed his work and stared at it for a while, he heads for the shower, and I use the opportunity to study the chart myself. New pieces of paper with the names o various unstable countries in Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe are lined up below, with some more noteson the one titled Libya.
“Thank God you’re alive… I was afraid I had lost you for a while. I was so scared you were dead, even if there was no blood…”
“I will make sure nobody dares disturb you”, she says resolutely. “Don’t you worry about that. Take all the time you need. All this must have been so dreadful for you.”
I don’t look around for Sherlock, nor listen for him as I stumble out of the alley and down the street. It would be pointless and a risk. I have to trust in him to do the right thing at the right moment. I make a show of looking at each house in the side road very carefully before finally walking up to the one we’re aiming at. Someone might be watching, and notice a change in my behavior. I miss the doorbell on my first attempt on purpose, then ring it. A moment later, one of the guards appears.
“Djamil! You got rid of the beard!”, exclaims the blond one. Sherlock runs a hand through his hair bashfully and gives her an uncertain smile.
He clicks around some more, but nothing else seems to catch his interest. Finally, he restores the screen to the way it was when we came in, then sneaks out of the room to inspect the rest of the flat. I press against the wall next to the front door, planning to sneak out in front of him when he opens it. Sherlock returns quickly. Like me, he seems to not have found anything interesting. Nice to know I’m getting better at this.
Sherlock, with an air of arrogance worthy of his brother, answers the greeting in a rapid gush of French that clashes badly with the heavy Russian accent he’s affecting, and the only word I understand by half is the very last one – some variation of “exotic”. It seems to be enough for the man, as he opens the door wider and beckons him in.
Three days later, Sherlock has found the children, or at least some of them. I don’t know if he made some deduction or other, or if he continued to pick random places off his list as he did the two previous times, but we are now in Augsburg, a small city near Munich, and we have found hell. Maybe Sherlock suspected what I never even dared to consider, for he did not ask for women at the door this time. In the role of a French businessman, speaking English to my surprise, he asked for “entertainment for gentlemen with unusual tastes”, and that might just be the mildest description possible for what we have just uncovered.
“Hello, dear”, she greets, “shall we take my car today? Sherlock’s brother was nice enough to pick me up yesterday, and it’s so exhausting to go out there by tube…”
“Papa Grisha stayed in contact, and he introduced me to Ksyusha when she was a teen learning English. It helped her study to talk to someone more her own age, we’re only about ten years apart. Is Alexey okay?”
“Call me Hettie”, she interrupts him resolutely, then grabs for a tray of rolls Harry has prepared. “I have to go open up, but you kids come up front and grab a tea when the breakfast rush’s over, will you?”
I swallow harshly, desperately thinking about how much to reveal about secrets that aren’t mine to tell.
So yeah, this is it. As I mentioned in a previous note, I'm working on a sequel to this. It will be called "Taking care of idiots" and will be told from Harry's and Mycroft's perspective while they are doing exactly that - trying to keep up appearances and protect their families at the same time. And in Mycroft's case, also while trying to figure out just what exactly is wrong with the Watson family - because we all know he's not one to accept "strange coincidences" like the ones in this story, especially when he hasn't even yet figured out just how Sherlock or one of his co-conspirators managed to breach security at the Diogenes Club.
“And you wouldn’t be the Sherlock Holmes I love if you didn’t. This is a three-way marriage, after all”, I joke.
That is probably the only way I can force Sherlock to east a full meal – make it part of the new skillset he’s practicing. He probably knows that’s why I’m doing this, too, but he agrees anyways. Maybe he already has a wish in mind.
I don’t even rise before Sherlock is out of the room, for fear of doing something stupid like uncover my feet. After a very quick bathroom break – who knows when I will next have the chance – I open the door again and hurry down the steps as quickly as I can. Stairs are always faster than elevators, and I take them three at a time. It is imperative that I catch up with Sherlock, as he is again not wearing the scarf I can track. I catch up with him in the Lobby, where he’s handing over the keycard to a receptionist for safekeeping.
Harry and Alexey are in the living room, the curtains already closed to block outsiders from watching. Harry has been expecting us. Alexey squeals when he sees me, running over to hug me hard.
Things slowly started changing when we turned eleven and were bound for secondary school. Obviously, my parents would never have paid for a “freak” like Harry to go to the same prestigious school they were sending me to, but it turned out that they didn’t have to bother. Ridiculously, the reason for Harry’s “freakishness” turned out to be magic – he was a wizard, and had already been enrolled at the most prestigious school of magic in Britain at birth, all tuition paid.
“Sure, maybe that was part of it. I did work with you for years and learn a few things. But it wasn’t what I was thinking. The first, the most glaring mistake, was Moriarty’s death. It just didn’t make sense, not to anyone with half a brain cell who knew the case. Even if the Yard never seems to have figured that out.”
“They’ll probably start looking for relatives for those whose mothers are dead. Put them into foster care if they don’t find any, either in the countries they’re in or back in their home countries. Easiest way would probably be to invent a relative and brief Alexey about the cover story before the police talks to him. He’s bright enough to go through with it.”
“It’s one of our main informants. Ten-year-old Russian kid, incredibly bright and clever. The human trafficking ring we’re investigating specializes on putting single mothers and their kids in different brothels, blackmailing them to comply by threatening to kill the other. But this boy, Alexey… he’s known his mother’s dead for years, but he stayed on to protect the other kids. Went through some bad shit for it, too. Sherlock’s been obsessed with finding him a good home.”
I was born as the living impersonation of all middle class stereotypes. A single child in the suburbs, born to a vastly overweight salesman and a housewife whose main fear was that anyone might think her or her family to be in any way unusual. They named me Dudley Dursley, no doubt believing the rhyme and alliteration to be cute. Nowadays, I gag at the thought. I was their perfect child, spoiled and overfed till I looked like a perfect round copy of my father, and the arrival of Harry Potter did not change a thing. My mother had always hated her sister and refused to acknowledge her existence, and she immediately transferred that hatred to Harry, who she feared would fit as badly into her perfect world as his parents had.
[Sherlock says Harry is your sister the same way she’s my aunt, so you’re my uncle now. and he’s, too, because he’s your husband. Is that true?]
I stagger down the street maybe fifty yards, then sit on a bench. It’s where we’ve decided to meet after, and I settle in for a long wait. Even if Sherlock finds the storage room and gains access quickly, it might be a while until he has secured the information and can safely wander outside without arousing suspicion. This is the worst part of it, not knowing what’s going on and no chance of helping if anything goes wrong. I am a man of action, and this is driving me mad. I don’t know how Harry can stand it, waiting back in London, and I resolve to bring her up to speed more often from now on. Once Sherlock returns, if he returns. I can only hope he makes it out safely.
“You knew what you were getting into beforehand. But I am sure glad that it’s not me going on a quest like this this time. Once really was enough.”
My throat closes up at the sound of that old nickname she gave me when we first moved here together so many years ago. The one that so subtly pulls together both of my name. The one that says, “I know all of your past, and your present, and I will support your future”. I hug her to me again tightly, then I swing the cloak around me with the ease of long experience. She let me play with it every now and then during my time at university – invisibility can be a lot of fun, but it is even better for dangerous times like these.
