"Okay, it's okay," she said in the same soft, placating tone. John was itching to escape now, and he glanced surreptitiously at the door. Dr Bradstreet cleared her throat.
Sherlock nods. "There's a little coffee shop, hole in the wall almost, just up Old Middle Lane," he begins. John's eyes light up.
John's mouth against his certainly did the trick of cutting off the hiccups mid-flow. Sherlock almost brained himself jerking back in surprise at the sensation of John's lips pressing onto his own. Once the initial shock wore off Sherlock's battle became not holding in hiccups but not collapsing under the heady waves of desire and arousal and
“Said ‘goodnight, love.’” Sherlock finished softly. “You called me ‘love’.”
'Yeah well, you tried that on me already. Didn't work ;)'
'Thanks for the corrections - I passed the mock exam! :) You're still a fastidious know-it-all.'
He mouthed along John's collarbone, not kissing, just skimming his lips over the skin. His fingers trailed through the soft hair on John's stomach, over his hip, down his thigh a little. Then back up, along John's side, making him twitch and snort and complain between giggles that it tickled. Sherlock kept his touch light and his fingers danced, alighting here and landing there. John stopped giggling and his breathing became heavier, his hand in Sherlock's hair firmer. Sherlock continued his explorations, revelling in the sounds and reactions. He circled John's nipple with one fingertip and leaned up to swallow John's gasp in a sultry kiss.
Sherlock flounders. What now? Can he ask John if he wants to get coffee again? Should he ask how his revision is going for the biochem exam? See if John would like to come over and kiss him, properly this time? Can one just ask that? In a text message?
“Vic? Phil? Seb? Which one gave you the black eye?”
"Yeah?"
“I’m John,” he said, flashing his best smile, “Sherlock’s tutoring me in chemistry.” Mycroft didn’t say a word, and his eyes swept over John in much the same way Sherlock’s did. John decided instantly that he did not appreciate it when Mycroft did it; it somehow felt more intrusive and judgemental than Sherlock’s gaze. Sherlock was looking because he was curious, Mycroft was looking for weaknesses to exploit, John thought.
"It kind of is," John whispered, "you sound adorable!" Sherlock snorted, then immediately regretted it as a new wave of contortions racked his diaphragm. "You really need to be quiet now though," John continued, "because I think that's Norwood coming back."
Sherlock pulls the now-rumpled note out of his coat and smoothes it open in his palm. There, John's words look up at him and he feels warmth spread throughout his body, as if John were standing beside him, smiling at him. He gazes adoringly at the note for a moment before snorting and catching himself. This should not be difficult. Simply text John and see if he would like to meet again, he tells himself. There. Easy.
John laughs again, “go on then,” he teases, “show off for me, you brilliant thing.”
“No,” Sherlock replied casually, “but then under tables isn’t the best place for that sort of thing anyway. Is it? Perhaps you ought to be more careful when you’re using the janitor’s cupboard to cheat on your girlfriend, hmm? Polly? Holly?” Sherlock turned to John.
He lifted the now-empty glass and flicked the end of it towards the bartender in a universal gesture for the next drink. The barman silently filled the glass again and stepped away to carry on the discussion he’d been having with a couple of surly-looking patrons at the other end of the bar. Glancing around, Sherlock took in his surroundings. The entire bar was somewhat questionable, but it was at least out of the way and the anonymity offered was most useful as he prepared for the next part of his task.
John seems determined to drive Sherlock completely mad as he employs everything he knows about how to draw out the most pleasure. He licks and sucks and kisses and swallows until Sherlock is a panting, moaning mess, propped up only by John's hands on his arse and his shoulder against the wall. Sherlock long since stopped caring about the sounds he's making, and John's muffled moans around his cock echo in the changing room, mixed with the slurps and groans from Will and Greg across from them.
No. Too dull.
“Please,” John entreated, and Sherlock finally, finally began to push in. He kept his pace slow and John released the sheets from his sweaty grasp to tangle in Sherlock’s curls again. Sherlock obliged him with lovely, light kisses and then he was fully seated.
Sherlock wraps his coat tighter around himself, his cheek tingling from the warmth of John’s lips. He has no idea how he makes it back to his room. Although he had planned to go back to his experiment as soon as he was home, he finds himself in his mind palace, committing every second of his time with John to his permanent memory.
As I fall asleep I kiss him, to tell him how much I am thankful for all the time we will have together.
The flat is quiet and dark when Sherlock unlocks the door and pushes it open to let John in. "This way," he says, steering John towards his bedroom and away from the disaster his flatmates have left in the shared spaces. John smirks and puts his hand in the small of Sherlock's back as he follows. Sherlock can’t help but shiver at this gentlest of touches and he's certain he can feel the heat of John's palm even through his thick wool coat. He opens his bedroom door and they go in. Sherlock shrugs off his coat, hanging it on the back of the door and steps up to John. Feeling brave, he places his hands on John's broad shoulders and tugs lightly at the material of his jacket. John smiles as he takes the hint, and lets Sherlock take the jacket off and hang it beside his coat.
Greg holds nothing back and swallows Will to the root in one go, moaning around a mouthful of cock. John grunts and gently palms Sherlock through his trousers, leaning up to whisper into his ear.
John smirks. "Made an impression, did I?"
I sigh and blow another mist of smoke up, up and away. My hand drops to my side and meets another. I close my eyes. John takes away the half-finished cigarette and extinguishes it on the window ledge. His fingers wind into my hair and stroke gently. He cradles my skull and with his other hand he reaches over me and takes my hand. Cold, I've been sitting here a while.
“You look gorgeous,” John continues, dropping his eyes to the table and fiddling nervously with his fork, as if he’s unsure how this will be received. Sherlock is astounded and gapes stupidly for a moment. When he recovers he tries to return the compliment.
John cut him off with a heavy sigh. “Look, it doesn’t really matter why, they’re just arseholes,” he said. “Well, some of them, at least.”
John had heard enough. He stepped into the room and cleared his throat. The boys all turned to look at him in the doorway. Seb and Phil at least had the decency to look a little sheepish at being caught out, but Vic stared back at John in challenge.
There was a request for an epilogue and this story wouldn't leave me alone so here it is. Hope you like.
John glances down at the considerable bulges they're both sporting and grins. Sherlock decides he absolutely has to free John from his jeans, and he needs to see John's face when he comes, and he will die if he doesn’t do both of these things right now.
Panic grips him. This is exactly why he generally doesn’t do this, it’s frustrating and he is desperate not to get it wrong. Especially with John. This is John Watson, for God’s sake. He absolutely cannot mess this up. He may only get this one chance to make John like him enough to perhaps consider spending more time with him. For all their flirting by post it note, Sherlock knows he must capture John’s attention as best he can before he does something to upset or annoy John and he never speaks to Sherlock again.
That soft, lean body behind her was awfully familiar. She could feel the gentle swell of Sherlock’s breasts pressed against her back, their legs were entwined and at some point in the night John had grabbed Sherlock’s hand, pulled Sherlock’s arm over her and tucked their joined hands underneath her own waist. They were spooning. Sherlock was going to be furious, John embarrassed, and the delicate gossamer thread slowly pulling them closer together to what John actually wanted would be forever torn.
Not that John spent his time noticing Sherlock noticing anyone else, of course. He was busy, too busy, far too busy to be looking out for a tall boy with dark hair every second of every minute of every school day since that first week. That's what he kept telling himself, and Mike and Greg when they brought up how his eyes and mind wandered in class and at lunch and at rugby and...
Human error. That’s what I told John. Just a few minutes ago, in fact. That’s what I tell myself now, as the figure holding the gun turns to face me. Human error. I am fallible after all.
Oh yes, this was definitely a Sherlock room, he thought. The clutter strewn chaotically all over every surface still seemed to have some form of order; there were papers and books, glassware obviously nicked from the school labs, an ant farm, a fencing trophy, a wooden model of a Spitfire - “My cousin’s,” Sherlock said, shrugging.
They made their way up an enormous staircase and Sherlock led him to a door at the end of the landing. He stood there nervously, but as John opened his mouth to ask, Sherlock huffed and swung open the door. Cautiously, John peered inside.
John sat on the edge of the bed and tried to keep his eyes from drifting to Sherlock’s mouth as he talked, but it was a bit of a lost cause. He just had a very expressive way of talking, John told himself. It was natural to watch him as he explained things, hands waving about, lovely lips forming long words… Sherlock suddenly stopped in the middle of his sentence and looked up from his book. “John?” he asked.
“It’s always just one more, until it isn’t,” the pilot said softly.
Sherlock Holmes was going to tutor him in chemistry. If he hadn't been screwed before, he definitely was now.
He drops the book onto the desk and flips to the relevant page. There. His note reads:
"Thank you, sweetheart," John said. He plucked a packet from the drawer and dropped it beside them on the bed. "Now, where was I? Oh yes."
“Oh, and he drives a van but wants to be a pilot,” Sherlock pronounces. John gapes at him incredulously, then laughs again. Sherlock thinks that John’s laughter may be his favourite sound in the world, beating out any violin concerto by a country mile.
I try to ignore the odious man on the floor and concentrate on her. I am sure, and I move to step towards her. Human error.
The man himself was lying on the sofa, eyes closed, one hand resting on his chest, mouth slightly open as he dozed. John couldn’t help the wave of fondness coursing through him at the sight. One of these days, he was going to just reach out, ruffle those curls and kiss that bloody man awake.
I join them on the patio and have to stand by helplessly, lost in a fugue as John bears the brunt of my folly. Yet again. I cannot keep doing this to him, I will not. John’s voice wavers. He is losing his control, it’s slipping and we can all see it. I tell him resignedly that there is no alternative. I loathe and despise everything about this entire fiasco. I am ending this now.
Cautiously, Sherlock lay down, a long way from sleep but unwilling to give up the opportunity to observe John. He settled in and listened to John’s steady breathing. The light from the streetlamps spilled through the gap in the heavy curtains, the only illumination in the dark room. John sighed and shifted beneath the covers. Sherlock fought the urge to wrap himself around John;s sleeping form and rolled over to face away from temptation. Despite himself, he found his eyes drifting closed as the regular breaths behind him soothed in their gentle rhythm. He was soon deeply asleep.
John laughed under her breath, gathered her courage and leaned forward. The kiss was everything John had ever wanted, and when Sherlock sighed in relief she knew she’d made the right choice. She pulled back slowly, trying to capture Sherlock’s face, radiant with delight.
“You were in a fight,” Sherlock said, handing John a packet of frozen peas for his swollen eye.
Dammit.
Just as I open my mouth however Lestrade shoves the man roughly towards the end of the hallway and growls something about incitement charges and abusive language in the presence of police officers. The hallway falls silent as the heavy door bangs behind them.
There was a short silence during which Sherlock’s scowl got even deeper and his pout even more childish.
“Says the overgrown four-year-old trapped in a thirty-something’s body.”
"You want to try again?" John asked. "It's okay if you don't love, honestly." Sherlock shook his head. "I do John, I do... Want to, that is. It's just..."
They finish their drinks in comfortable silence, each shyly watching the other over the edges of their mugs. Sherlock wonders how it is so easy for them to just sit together, neither needing to fill the silence with inane chatter, just enjoying each other’s company. He marvels at how straightforward it seems even as a small part of him begins to worry that this can’t possibly last too long. Unfortunately, that small part of him is right on this occasion.
Sherlock lets his eyes fall closed and ignores the tiny ache in his chest until sleep finds him and drags him under its soothing blanket of nothingness.
Sherlock looked back into the sitting room and assessed the sofa with a critical eye. He could spend many an hour reclined on the leather cushions, but the creaky old frame and lumpy stuffing would wreak havoc on John’s bad shoulder. Unacceptable.
Mycroft watches me silently. Mrs Hudson brings him tea and he thanks her. She leaves. I see all of this and none of it. I continue plucking at the strings, not producing any melody as such, merely taking some measure of comfort in the action alone.
“Hey, you ok?” John asks, his hand reaching out towards Sherlock. Sherlock wants nothing more than to take that so easily offered hand and rub his cheek into the palm, feeling the heat from John’s mug and the caress of John’s skin against his own. He just barely manages to control the urge. That would be beyond mortifying in the middle of Molly’s coffee shop.
Need and urgency were beginning to take over, and Sherlock gasped when John rolled them over and proceeded to press filthy kisses over any part of Sherlock he could see.
It's been six days since Mary died.
'Love'. It is impossible for me not to assign some meaning to his utterance of the word, socially conditioned as even I am to associate significance to its effects in this context. I almost want to stop John doing what he is doing to ask him about it but there is such strong pleasure building within me now that I am unable to focus on the concept for more than a few seconds.
“Fine,” he heard Sherlock reply. Sherlock paused in the doorway and turned slightly, his eyes cast downwards.
“I love you, John,” Sherlock mumbled.
The glass stopped at his lips when the pilot’s heavy, warm hand came to settle on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock had his back to John as he paced, scowling and pouting like a five year old as he listened to the person on the other end of the phone. He had his mobile pressed to his ear and John speculated to himself who it was that Sherlock was getting an earful from this time.
"You certainly made an impression," John murmurs. Sherlock clears his throat and turns away towards Molly to hide the flush of pleasure creeping onto his cheeks.
But the thought of listening to someone, someone interesting, and having them listen to him in return, holds more appeal that he'd care to admit. It isn't that he wants some insipid, vacuous moron to moon over his every word, of course not. It's more the ebb and flow of debate, someone to question his assumptions and ask him how he arrived at that conclusion, someone who I'll want to hear the process of his deductions and how he came to see all of that information. Someone who isn't predictable, who doesn't shy away from the 'freak' who sees more than he ought and isn't afraid to share his observations. Someone who just... Someone who listens. And maybe... Smiles at him. Just a little smile. A tiny grin. Friendly, a-and warm. That would be... That could be... Nice.
“Like that, then?” John murmured. He leaned in a pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock hummed delightedly and reached up to tangle his huge hands in John’s jumper. John deepened the kiss but it somehow never lost its tenderness. Gently, they parted, both smiling besottedly.
I sigh at the self-pitying turn my thoughts are taking, stub out my cigarette and light a fresh one. I'm mostly sheltered from the rain and my coat keeps me warm enough. I don't really need the cigarettes but at the same time I do. Crutch; not the aluminium kind. I can smell the fallen leaves starting to rot beneath my feet, the fresh, clean scent of autumnal rainfall, and him. He's not here of course, he's in the house, but funny thing, olfactory memory. I can also see his silhouette through the window, he really should close the curtains. He's drinking again, I note glumly. Every night since it happened he drinks; not enough, too much. Every night since it happened I stand in the garden and watch the house.
Sherlock paces his room and tugs at his curls in frustration, flinging his phone onto his bed. Why is this so difficult? He has a ridiculously high IQ, first-rate observational skills and a quite frankly astonishing brain. He should be able to work this out! John kissed him, for God’s sake. He slipped his number into Sherlock's pocket and kissed him.
"John?" I ask as I comply. "Just relax, and enjoy," John tells me. I nod and mumble my agreement.
Sherlock sighed and wriggled closer, and John wrapped his arm more tightly around Sherlock’s shoulders, pressing kisses into his hair.
It was the quiet entreaty that broke John’s resolve. She climbed back into bed and was immediately enveloped, lips meeting Sherlock’s as if they’d always been doing this. Kissing each other. Kissing Sherlock. The thought caused a soft moan to escape John’s throat, and Sherlock moved to chase it.
“We decided to go straight to bed, but some useless peon of Mycroft’s had made a mistake and there was only one bed. You crashed onto it, not terribly gracefully and fully dressed I might add, for just under nine minutes at which point you woke, got undressed, mumbled to me about ‘just get in the bloody bed Sherlock,’ and appeared to doze off. I… complied.”
John eventually pulls away and strokes my face again. "All right?" he asks nervously. I am more than all right, John. I brush my hand through his hair and pull him down by the neck for another kiss. Now he has given me one kiss he can never stop bestowing them on me. I will not allow it. I am certain I am doing this all wrong but John doesn't seem to object to my apparent lack of technique. He giggles and kisses me harder. We lose ourselves in each other, and soon become desperate and part, gasping into each other's mouths. There is such hunger in John's eyes.
Greg sighed again and Mike stepped forward. “We’re telling you this because we think some of the lads have been making life difficult for Sherlock. I heard Vic saying that he knew Sherlock from before, that Sherlock thought they were friends and that Sherlock tried to kiss him once. Vic pushed him away and… well he said he punched his faggot face, John.”
John winked at Sherlock. "I know. That's just an added bonus."
"Will Huddleston," he says warmly. Sherlock takes his hand and shakes it briefly. Will is still smiling as he drops Sherlock's hand and sits down beside him. Sherlock surreptitiously sweeps his gaze over Will's tall form, slouched on the bench next to him.
“Yeah, you are,” John murmurs. Sherlock blushes harder even harder than before and shifts in his seat. Change the subject, quick before John sees too much, he thinks.
He manages to open his eyes and look down just as John swallows every last drop of come. His knees give up and John's hands cradle his sides lovingly as he slides down the wall to land solidly on his bum on the floor. He gathers himself just enough to see John reach beneath his towel. "No, me," Sherlock mumbles, batting John's hand away and replacing it with his own. John moans Sherlock's name and comes all over his hand and the towel. Sated, he flops down to sit beside Sherlock. Sherlock closes his eyes as the pleasure finally recedes.
Sherlock’s hand twisted as he gave one particularly powerful thrust against John’s prostate and John was lost. His orgasm burst from him, making him clench around Sherlock and shout his pleasure to the bedroom ceiling. He heard Sherlock cry out as well, a stuttered yell of his name, then there was a hot pulsing sensation within him as Sherlock reached his climax. Exhausted, sweaty and so deeply in love, they collapsed into one another’s arms again.
"John," I say, "I... I mean it too." He relaxes into my odd embrace and strokes my hair, kisses my cheek. He sighs and laughs. I chuckle into his neck where I have buried my face. We part only enough to look at each other, our arms still around one another. John's face is open and bright and I am sure my expression is insufferably soppy. Must get a handle on that.
“The one I attended once, corrected the idiot directing the class, was asked to leave, then passed anyway? Yes?”
'Is this your wordy roundabout way of asking me out for coffee?'
Gradually Sherlock's thighs protested his body's position and he lifted himself up and off, stifling a ludicrous giggle as John's softening cock slipped free of him. John sniggered and rolled onto his side, stripping off the condom, tying a neat knot in it and unceremoniously dropping it to the floor. He wiped Sherlock's come from his chest and neck with a corner of the sheet, looking at Sherlock over his shoulder with a cheeky wink. Sherlock blushed inexplicably and picked at his side of the sheet a little sheepishly. John took pity on him and rolled back over, arm outstretched, beckoning. Sherlock shuffled in close, resting his head on John's chest as John played with his curls. All was quiet and peaceful, utterly blissful.
“John fancies Mary,” Seb announced, a cruel twist of his lips indicating just what kind of chance he thought John had with the most popular girl in school. His announcement was met with huffs and laughter from the rest of the team and John forced himself not to react.
The first touch of his lips on my backside makes me gasp in surprise, but I quickly lose any and all capacity for intelligent thought as his mouth trails kisses and licks and nips down the curve of my left cheek. I cry out and grind uncontrollably into the sheets when he swipes his tongue down my crease, tickling at my entrance as he goes. I feel him smile and chuckle into my flesh. I shudder as his strong fingers knead the curves of my bottom gently. John hums softly.
He started with the cleansing enema recommended by the woman in the shop where he'd bought the lube; simple enough process and he wanted this to be so very good for them both. Then he showered, quietly so as not to wake John too soon. Naked and damp, he watched John sleep for a little while to calm his nerves. Ridiculous, he thought, that he should desire something so strongly and yet be anxious about actually having it. Then again, that summed up almost his entire friendship with John.
The handwriting is awful and there is a ring on the paper from a coffee cup. Sherlock snorts and takes a sip from his own coffee. He takes out his laptop and his notes and settles in. If the note finds its way into one of his books Sherlock refuses to notice it.
“Oh, scuffs on his trainers,” Sherlock said dismissively.
“John,” Greg said urgently, then tugged him over to one side as the other lads called their goodbyes on their way out.
"There," John proclaims. Sherlock looks down. There, stuck to his shirt over his heart, is a post-it note.
Sherlock sighs as he makes his way back to the library. One more complaint to the Head of School, he supposes. He's almost finished though, he just needs to complete his dissertation and his final exams then they'll be rid of him. He'll go to London for his PhD - with his marks (not to mention his age and his background) they'll accept him in a heartbeat. Then he can-
Shit.
“Charter plane, small company,” Sherlock said. The pilot nodded absently.
He wasn’t interrupting enough for it to be Greg. Not a case, then. Could be Mummy. Sherlock never talked back to Mummy, although to be fair, neither would John. Mycroft? The disdain was certainly indicative of a conversation with the elder Holmes. Tuning in to the conversation a bit more, John listened carefully for clues.
He pouted a bit but John just raised an eyebrow and stared back at him. Jerking his head towards the bedside table, Sherlock muttered "Top drawer."
Outside of school, John was happier and more settled than he’d ever felt. But in school, he and Sherlock hardly spoke. A fair bit of John’s time was taken up with classes and rugby practice, and Sherlock seemed to make a point of avoiding John whenever he was with his rugby mates. John tried not to be hurt by this apparent rejection; he wanted Sherlock to feel welcomed as much as possible, and yeah alright, part of him wanted to show off his incredible friend, show the other lads how much fun Sherlock could be, how amazing his endless curiosity and surprisingly silly sense of humour were. A few of the lads had made some odd comments, but John just shrugged them off. He didn’t really know Vic and Seb and Phil all that well, and Tim had been keeping himself to himself a lot. If Mike and Greg had noticed anything, they certainly hadn’t said so. It was all just a bit… odd.
******
When he returns to the desk the following day, a smug grin playing about his lips, he finds the OED still sitting there. Point made, he thinks. Then he notices it. The dictionary is still there, only now, it's open to the word 'fastidious'.
Sherlock gradually becomes aware of a heavy weight on his back, wait, no two heavy weights on his back, weights that feel very much like John's hands. His own hand is trapped between his and John's groins, sticky and cooling and covered in their come. His head is pillowed on John's shoulder and John is... John is pressing kisses into his mussed curls. He feels lightheaded and utterly boneless and, despite the encroaching discomfort of his sweaty shirt sticking to his back and cramp in his hand, he never wants to move. Ever.
'That's not what people normally say. They normally tell me to piss off.'
John’s eyes are wide, his pupils dilated and he’s licking his lips. Sherlock guesses he’s staring at the exposed skin of Sherlock’s throat, and at the buttons of the stupidly tight shirt pulling across his chest as he reaches for his drink. Sherlock congratulates himself internally; this shirt was definitely the right choice. He makes a bit of a show of swallowing his mouthful of coffee, then sets the drink down on the table and cups his hands around it.
“Hi love,” John says, reaching up to brush Sherlock’s hair away from his forehead. The spark of joy in John’s eyes makes Sherlock blush.
“How’s your revision going?” John asks, leaning back in his seat and sipping at his hot chocolate again. As he shifts in his chair his knee presses into Sherlock’s, just a light pressure against his leg, and Sherlock is certain John will be able to see his pulse shooting dangerously high as his heart tries once again to escape his ribcage. Focus, he tells himself.
We lie there silent for a few moments then John gets up. He disappears from the room. I clamp down fiercely on the panic and cold dread that rises up within me and force myself to calm. Just once, then. Just one experience. Even if that is all I shall ever have of him, I will never regret a single second. I will recall his murmurs, the feel of his kisses, the warmth of his touch, in every atom of my being for the remainder of my days, and I will be glad of it. I, for once, will not take that which is not given. The memory of his 'love' will sustain me.
Wriggling a little to dislodge John's hands, he reaches forward and hastily fumbles with John's fly. John groans and his hands fall away, one coming to rest on Sherlock's knee, the other flung up over his face as Sherlock frees him from the confines of his jeans. John, Sherlock is both thrilled and terrified to see, isn’t wearing any pants. Also, John is... equipped. Sherlock's mouth begins to water as he sits there admiring John. If he's honest he's a little bit intimidated. Can't be any different than... doing that to himself, surely?
There was another rumour that Sherlock was shagging Molly Hooper, the pretty girl Mike had had a crush on for ages but was too chicken to do anything about. John didn't think that one was true either, mostly because Sherlock barely seemed to notice Molly's attentions at all.
Sunlight dappled John's skin, casting a glow across his spreadeagled form as he dozed among the rumpled sheets. Sherlock knew the expression on his face was hopelessly soft but for once did not care about showing his true feelings so openly. He simply stood there, in the doorway, gazing at the impossibly beautiful man currently snuffling softly in his slumber.
Sherlock changes three more times, finally dashing out of his flat almost 45 minutes later.
"Yeah, yeah," John said distractedly, "ze girls."
“You can’t bench me!” Vic shouted, “I’m the best player on this fucking team!”
He scoops up his phone and opens a new text. Then promptly freezes again.
"Love," John says, smiling. "Yes, I did," he continues. "And I meant it, if, you know, that's ok. I mean, nothing has to change, I just- oof!"
“Sherlock,” John growled warningly as he sat up. “Not in the mood right now.” Sherlock swallowed and ignored the flare of heat in his belly at John’s gruff voice, pulling harder on the duvet and striding off with it towards his bedroom. He heard John sigh and pull back, making him stumble. Sherlock let go with a huff and placed his hands on his hips, posture impatient. John smirked at him.
“John,” Tim said quietly. John’s patience was running out. He shrugged restlessly as Tim shuffled his feet.
3M make post it notes. Thanks Jam for pointing out the obvious. ;)
"Oh God, Sherlock," John mumbled. Sherlock opened his eyes to see John staring up at him, undisguised adoration on his face. He tried lifting up a little and sinking back down and they groaned in unison.
Sherlock snorts. There are fewer crumbs today but more scrunched up bits of paper. Sherlock unfurls one and tries to read the handwriting. It's the same as the notes he's been getting. The paper has lecture notes from a biochemistry module Sherlock took in his second year. Clearly whoever it is using his desk, they are struggling with the module. Failing, but only just. Some of these notes make sense but others... What must it be like in a normal mind, Sherlock wonders.
“I only have one exam this semester and it’s incredibly dull,” he answers. John laughs. “It is,” Sherlock insists, “I’d not bother turning up but I need the credits for my PhD application.”
Before he realises, the waiter is clearing their plates and offering them dessert menus. John says something polite and the waiter retreats again. It's just as well John steps in when Sherlock is lost in examining the pattern of hairs on John's lovely forearms, because Sherlock is sure if left to him he would've been considerably less than polite.
Sherlock stares at Will's earnest, friendly face and shakes his head as Greg saunters back into the main locker room. "What are you up to, Huddles?" he grins. Will bites his lip and laughs. "Stop bugging John's lovely fella!"
He gets more done than he thought he would without the distraction caused by crumbs everywhere. He manages to navigate another encounter with John Watson in the coffee shop with minimal fuss (if by minimal fuss one means darting out of the shop as fast as possible while avoiding all eye contact). Their paths have hardly crossed in almost three years but now it seems they can hardly miss one another. Sherlock is puzzled by this but resolves to ignore any odd fluttering his stomach may do in John Watson's presence. If he simply never looks at John, he can avoid any peculiar feelings caused by that brilliantly warm smile. Crumbs on his desk are one distraction, he has successfully handled, John Watson's smile is quite another.
“There’s a great research programme at Imperial. I want to carry on studying, but in a more specialised area,” John goes on, his face lighting up as he tells Sherlock about the centre for tropical medicine and the research he's interested in. Sherlock knows a little about tropical medicine – well, the really interesting diseases at least, and they lose themselves in the topic for a while.
John's hand closed around his cock and suddenly Sherlock was right there, on the edge. Then John stroked him firmly, once, twice, three times and Sherlock was coming, spilling on John's chest and stomach and neck, crying out in his ecstasy. He could feel himself clenching around John and warmth flooded his belly as he felt John start to come, filling the condom. He stayed there, watching in awe as John was lost to his orgasm. Finally, breathless, aching and happier than he ever thought he could feel, Sherlock collapsed forward onto John. John's arms came up around his back and they lay there, still joined, for a moment.
“Rugby team?” Sherlock asked quietly. John looked up at him with his one good eye and nodded.
Sherlock can't help it. His mouth drops wide open and he makes a noise that is absolutely not a happy squeak. John chuckles again. "So," he says.
Sherlock was waiting for him in the library. It was quiet, not many students having a free period right before lunch on a Wednesday. John spotted his (gorgeous) curls on the far side of the room and ducked behind the nearest shelf to compose himself for a moment.
John blinks and hurriedly looks away, biting his lip to prevent the smirk threatening to creep across his face from escaping. He clears his throat instead.
"You're totally gone on him, aren't you? You're precious," Will says quietly. "You know he's exactly the same about you, right? It's lovely."
"HIC!"
“Wait, no,” John says. Sherlock’s heart sinks to his feet and he looks away. He’s been revelling in John’s attention but he’s sure he’s come across as too freakish. And now, John will stop smiling at him and telling him he’s brilliant and-
“Sherlock Holmes,” Sherlock intoned. He sounded very bored. “Now, I hope you’re not a complete idiot or this will quickly become incredibly trying.”
“Fine,” John grumbles, “but only because I am so late for rugby practice. I was in such a rush to get here to make sure I didn’t miss you that I forgot to pick up my kit.” He pulls a sheepish face. “I had to run back to my room to grab my stuff, and I’m still going to be late.”
Sherlock is greeted by delicious smells of garlic, wine and meat as he enters the restaurant, and is reminded of spending his summers with his Grandmère as a child. John looks up from the menu when the waiter escorts Sherlock over, smiling as he stands.
“Come for me, John,” he breathed, “come for me now.”
John followed him up to his room, watching as that v-shaped smile stole onto his best friend’s face.
"I'm not your mate," Sherlock snaps. John's smile falters and Sherlock uses the moment to wrench his arm free, escape from the doorway and stride off towards the old library. That was close. For all that he is not remotely interested in the petty squabbles and gossips of his fellow students, even Sherlock couldn't fail to hear about John Watson. He's seen the rugby captain around campus a few times, although he does his best to avoid the sporting crowds. John Watson is even more devastatingly gorgeous when he smiles, and that smile had been directed at Sherlock just then. Sherlock's stomach gives a little flutter and he feels heat flush into his cheeks. Sherlock knows he could easily find himself in a whole lot of trouble if he spends any time near or with John Watson.
They’re making their way to the door now, and the brumal air hits them as they step outside. John crowds close to Sherlock on the threshold.
John clapped a hand over Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock tried not to shudder as John pressed his body weight against him. They were squashed together from chest to knee, the long, gangly lines of Sherlock's frame fitting perfectly around John's gorgeously strong shorter one. His throat was starting to ache from the annoying hiccups but he wanted more than anything for John to stay exactly where he was. The situation was becoming increasingly precarious and utterly intolerable.
"John?" Sherlock asked.
'There. Tidied up for you. Nobody else comes up here anyway and it's a nice quiet place to study so I will not piss off. Kindly or otherwise.'
"Mmm, well you can do that anytime you like, ever you want," John replied, snuggling back down into the sheets and tugging Sherlock closer. Sherlock nestled his face into the curve of John's neck, tucking his hands in to stroke John's collarbone and inhaling deeply. John sighed again and the arm he had wrapped around Sherlock's back tightened further. John's breath ruffled his curls and John lifted his other hand to push into the thick hair at the roots. Sherlock moaned lowly in pleasure; his scalp was very sensitive and he absolutely adored having his hair stroked.
"Gonna have to get up, love," he says. "Gonna be late for my lecture." Sherlock huffs and buries his face in the pillow. He lifts his head and looks at John through narrowed eyes.
One more. One more, then-
"Yeah well, you'd be constantly going on about him if he was your boyfriend," John mumbles even as he looks up at Sherlock with soft affection radiating from his expression. Greg laughs, a couple of the others watching their conversation joining in and smiling.
It was a long 45 minutes but for John it was over too quickly. He felt a bit overwhelmed but as though he now understood concepts he’d been struggling with much better following Sherlock’s somewhat terse explanations than he ever had with Dr Bradstreet.
“Aw, c’mon Cap!” Vic said, elbowing Seb who in turn caught the attention of the rest of the rugby team. Expectant faces turned in John’s direction, and he fought the urge to look for that head of dark curls just one more time.
“I can’t help thinking we did that in sort of the wrong order,” John said quietly. Sherlock hummed.
“So, I had my biochem exam today,” he says casually. Sherlock raises a questioning eyebrow. “I think it went really well,” John goes on, “but then, it would. I had some rather excellent pointers on the bits I was struggling with from a brilliant genius, after all.”
"Wha-?" was all Sherlock managed to reply. John snorted and pushed the cupboard doors open with his good shoulder, stepping out and catching Sherlock around the waist when he followed. Sherlock's legs had lost their rigid form and turned to liquid at some point in the last few minutes. He tottered for a moment before his muscles and bones solidified once more and he was able to stand again.
It's the latter which has brought him here today, on a blustery Saturday evening, with his laptop and notebooks spilling out of his bag. He had to grab them in a hurry to avoid his flatmates, dashing out of the door before they came back from lectures to get ready for a night out drinking. He would dearly love to move out of halls altogether but he can't afford a flat by himself, not with bloody Mycroft holding onto his trust funds until his degree is completed. Bloody Mycroft. Bloody Seb, and Philip, and Victor. Sherlock has shared with them for nearly a year now and every Saturday is the same. They go out, get drunk, try to pull, fail, come home, interrupt whatever Sherlock is doing, make fun of him, get more drunk, eventually pass out in the kitchen/living room/bathroom. Seb and Philip are worse than Victor, who at least looks vaguely apologetic the next day. The most annoying thing is that, for all their stupid bravado and idiotic comments, Sherlock can't help but feel a small stab of hurt at every joke, every jibe at his expense. He's long since given up bothering to deduce them; there's just no challenge in it anymore. So instead he spends his evenings in his favourite spot, reading journals, devising new experiments, or just simply sitting quietly to think.
Confidence building as the burn gave way to pure pleasure, Sherlock leaned forward to rest his hands on John's shoulders and began to move in earnest. The drag of John's cock inside him caused hot shivers to break out all over his skin. Distantly he was aware of the noises he was making and he bit into his lip to stifle them.
"Greg is a competitive bastard, and he's fancied Will for ages. Sounds like they're having a good time, doesn't it?"
HOLY SHIT. It's been like six months since I updated this. Oops. Very sorry. Much fluff in this chap.
I nod and he nods in return. Then he smiles, and it’s the first time I’ve seen him smile in six weeks.
I drop to my knees. My coat swirls behind me with the gusts of the helicopter blades. Dimly I hear Mycroft’s voice but I barely register what he’s saying. I stay there, on my knees, rigid in the spotlights as the men surround us, weapons drawn. I try to school my face but I feel lost, untethered. And then I am pulled to my feet. I am dragged away. I hear John’s voice, or I think I do. I can’t tell anymore. All I can hear is the echo of the gunshot, the report reverberating in my ears. It all seems distant somehow. No matter. I will accept the consequences of my actions. Whatever the cost, I had told myself. Whatever it costs, keep him safe, keep him happy. I cannot fail him again.
'Damn, busted. Yeah you did tell me. And you also told me I clearly didn't know good coffee. You were right. Care to show me where to find the good stuff? ;)'
John snorted and pushed Greg’s hand away from his face. “Nothing, nothing I’d care to tell you morons about, anyway,” he laughed, watching Greg’s mock pout droop even further down his face.
"I love you," Sherlock whispered. He wriggled even closer, John dropping kisses into his hair as he whispered back. "I love you too." Sherlock's breathing gradually slowed and he fell into a deep sleep, wrapped in John's loving embrace and boundless affection.
"I won't keep you any longer, John, I just wanted to check in with you. And to let you know that if your marks keep sliding like this, you're going to have trouble getting into that Bart's course I know you have your heart set on."
“So you like bees?” John said casually.
Sherlock stands nervously beside the closed door as John looks around. He glances at John's jacket hanging on the back of his door, at John looking at his piles of books, the experiments on the desk. There's a softness in John's expression as he takes in the organised chaos of Sherlock's room. If Sherlock were any braver he'd think it was sincere affection.
“You really are brilliant, aren’t you?” John says softly, winking at Sherlock over the rim of his coffee. Sherlock flushes again at the sincerity in John’s voice and bites his lip to hide his answering smile.
He’d taken half a step towards the sofa before he clocked it, and suddenly Sherlock’s eyes snapped open.
“Can’t have been Vic, he doesn’t do physical confrontation well, just snide, hurtful remarks. Could be Phil but he’s unlikely to have swung for the face, he’s pretty cowardly. That leaves Carl, I suppose, but I still don’t understand why!” John looked up at the sharpness in Sherlock’s voice.
"Yes, John," I whisper, writhing on the sticky sheets beneath him. I want to feel his pleasure, I want it on my skin and I want him all over me. He moans low in his throat, voice gone rough and deep, then suddenly he is coming, spurting onto my bare bottom and thighs. I sigh in satisfaction and rub myself onto the bed. My oversensitive skin tickles and John flops down beside me.
Two years. Almost two years. So long. It had been so long since he’d chased the night air down an alleyway, the footsteps behind him speaking of sandy hair, deep blue eyes and a strong, steady, welcome hand. The lingering smells of Chinese takeaway and beer and chemicals and gun oil. The sound of an impossibly light and melodious giggle in an unexpected place, the tingle in his fingertips as soft, gentle notes created warm smiles and fond praise. So much hidden beneath, buried deeply into his core, a longing fierce, a love irrevocable.
He knew he was in for some bother when Dr Bradstreet asked him to stay behind after class one day.
“Hey,” John said, leaning up on one arm. He cupped Sherlock’s jaw and turned his head so that their eyes met. “I’m hoping for many next times,” he admitted softly, “if that’s alright with you?”
A sudden thought occurs like a bucket of cold water to the face. What if the notes are some elaborate prank, played by Seb and his cronies? Anything they can do to humiliate Sherlock, they'll try. Especially after the visit from Victor's father a couple of months ago. Not Sherlock's proudest moment. In the quiet solitude of the library he can admit that he was imprudent to mention Victor's father's financial difficulties so carelessly. Victor had always been the most tolerable of Sherlock's flatmates; he stopped speaking to Sherlock after his father's visit and he's transferring to another institution.
Sherlock struggled to stand perfectly still and silent as their suspect entered the office and sat down at the desk. John shifted minutely and suddenly Sherlock became all too aware of how closely together they were standing. Not that there was much space inside in which the cupboard they'd hastily chosen to hide themselves, but Sherlock could smell John's shampoo from where he was. If he tilted his head just... down a bit... just so. He inhaled gently, letting the warm, soothing fragrance fill his nostrils. The proximity of John's body was both calming and maddening, simultaneously making Sherlock feel grounded and light-headed. He angled his lower body away from John as best he could, to disguise that absolutely nothing was happening down there, and subtly inhaled again-
"Quite," said I, "shouldn't you be going then, Mrs Hudson? Leaving imminently?"
Sherlock walks briskly through the crowds of laughing students, crossing the campus and making for the little restaurant. His stomach was tying itself in such knots that, even though he likely wouldn’t have eaten much anyway, he's not sure he'll manage a single bite. The butterflies are back in full force and he feels like he's swallowed a lepidopterist, collection and all.
The words breathed into his skin made John tremble as he nodded, mouth forming soundless cries of delight, eyes sliding shut as Sherlock slipped first his shirt then his jeans off. He lowered John onto the bed on his back, still kissing every inch of bare skin. Sherlock slid off the bed and langourously removed his own clothes. John hardly had time to appreciate the view when Sherlock was lying across him, a warm, heavy weight pressing him into the covers. Sherlock kept up his gentle assault on John’s skin, his lips just brushing over a nipple, then sucking a light bruise into the crest of his hip.
We sit together in silence after that. It’s only when I hear distant chimes marking the time that I realise it is six hours into my birthday.
"Oof!" he exclaims when John slaps his hand, albeit gently, to Sherlock's chest. Sherlock sits up, confused.
A trilling of the bell startled us and Watson jumped up as if stung. The bitter bite of separation nipped at my chest as I heard the thundering steps of Lestrade mounting the stairs. Of all times to be given a case! I cursed.
John was pondering this very thing as he packed up his kit after practice one Tuesday afternoon. He hadn’t seen Sherlock all day and their next chemistry tutoring session (which had slowly become a little bit of studying then just relaxed hanging out together, talking about all kinds of things - including bees) wasn’t til Thursday. He was leaving the changing rooms, thinking about just turning up at Sherlock’s house, just to check in on him, when Greg caught his arm.
"No, never," I reply softly. I shake my head. No John, no. "You... You called me... You said..."
'That is amazing. You knew all that from my coffee cup and grass on the floor?! See, told you. Genius. ;)'
“I know that look.”
"Is... is this...?"
Sherlock let out a soft cry when John's finger breached him and his hips jerked off the bed as John sucked the very tip of Sherlock's prick into his mouth. Heat pooled in his belly as John lifted his head and kissed down his shaft, slowly moving his finger in and out, circling and stroking. Soon Sherlock was keening, begging for more.
"Yeah?" He felt John's words against his skin.
I studied him closely for a moment. He was dressed in his usual attire, neat and trim. His jacket looked soft to the touch, his waistcoat a grey which complimented his deep blue eyes most pleasantly. His moustache twitched as he tried not to smile at my scrutiny. I remembered the feel of it late last evening, tickling against the nape of my neck, his breath hot as he had kissed the damp skin there, and I fought away a flush of colour to my cheeks at the memory. Watson, damn him, noticed the train of my thoughts and smirked at his paper. I reached to take a newspaper of my own and raised it over my face, shifting in my chair to make myself more comfortable.
He returned momentarily and stood leaning slouched against the door jamb. I could feel his hungry eyes on me and I struggled not to squirm. How he is able to make my skin feel as if it were afire, my veins singing with electricity as they have never done even with the purest cocaine, the hair on my arms standing on end and a flush of heat coursing through my entire body, with merely a certain look in his eyes. How mad he makes me, and in his presence like this I feel as though I have taken leave of my senses. Ne'er am I happier to feel untethered, existing solely for his attentions with no higher functions than the desire to please him.
Sherlock wonders if he can ask Mycroft to invest some of his trust fund in 3M.
"John?"
I'm only out for a couple of minutes but when I open my eyes everything still feels a little fuzzy. I hear grunting up ahead and I manage to rally my faculties sufficiently so that I can raise my head and peer through the dim light to see what's going on.
So far Mike and Greg were the only ones John thought had noticed, and neither of them had said anything outright. John hadn't expected them to, but was grateful that he wasn't being forced to explicitly state it out loud. He could say it to himself in his head though. Yes, he fancied boys too. He wondered what that meant, that he liked both boys and girls in that way. He wondered if there were any other boys at school who felt like that. He wondered if there were any boys at school who were gay. Statistically there must be, but who? He wondered if Sherlock could maybe possibly perhaps be... Like that? He wondered, and somewhere along the line wondering turned to hoping.
John flicks through a couple more photos and Sherlock winces internally at what must surely be on there. He forgets deletes some of the things he's had a fleeting interest in and he can't remember when he last took photos. He hopes there isn't anything too off-putting on there.
He slowly closes his eyes and lowers his mouth to meet mine. I am set aflame instantly by the feeling of his lips. John is kissing me. My John. He smiles against my mouth and I feel it to the tips of my toes.
"O-of course, if you don't want to, that's fine, it's-it's all fine, I just-" he cuts himself off and glances away. He looks a bit crestfallen, and Sherlock immediately decides John's lovely face should never look that way ever again. If he can stop it doing that by going for coffee that's what he'll do.
John squeezes Sherlock's fingers, an attempt at reassurance, as they walk down the dark tunnel and into the bright fluorescent lights if the changing rooms. Sherlock can hear the showers running, wild laughter and the general chaos of the team washing up and getting ready to leave. He's still nervous but if John wants him to meet his team, meet John's team he shall.
John looked for Sherlock at lunchtime but he was nowhere to be seen. He wasn't really paying attention to Mike and Greg and the other lads as they sat down at their usual table, laughing and ribbing each other. He was thinking about his chemistry tutor; the way Sherlock’s eyes had lit up as he wrote down formulas and laid out the key concepts they’d been working on in class for John to absorb. He was terse, blunt and spoke at a ridiculous pace but John felt more confident in his knowledge after just that one 45 minute session. John was looking forward to spending more time with Sherlock, even if it was only to talk about chemistry.
Thankfully John stops his babbling by meeting his eye and smiling that wonderful smile at him. Sherlock shuts his mouth with a click. He reaches out towards the desk to pick up his things and John's smile changes from friendly to something decidedly cheekier. He slides his bum across the edge of the desk, ostensibly to move out of Sherlock's way, but actually bringing their bodies closer together. John tilts his head and openly appraises Sherlock's lean frame as Sherlock hastily gathers his laptop and notebook, shrugging into his coat. He suddenly feels incredibly warm, even though it's still mild outside and reasonably comfortable indoors.
“I’m going for a shower, I smell like hospital,” John grumbled. “You make the fecking tea.”
Finally they parted, flushed and uncomfortably sticky. John glanced down at his hand with a bit of a grimace. He looked back up at Sherlock, who raised an eyebrow and tilted his head in the direction of his stomach. John laughed and got up, bending to scoop up a discarded pair of boxers from the floor. Using them to clean his hand and the mess splattered across his belly, he then wiped tenderly at Sherlock’s body. He dropped the boxers on the floor and lay down beside Sherlock, not touching him. They lapsed into silence.
The new boy flicked his gaze confidently around the room, never seeming to settle on anyone or anything for longer than a few seconds, then tilted his head as he turned back to the teacher.
It should’ve felt weird, but it didn’t, John thought distractedly as Sherlock’s fingertips danced across his chest. His husband’s hushed sigh of pleasure as he dragged his hand gently down to John’s waistband set an affectionate warmth alight between them. John smoothed up Sherlock’s arms and wound his fingers into dark curls.
"Wha-" he mumbles, gesturing vaguely to the desk behind John. Great, he chastises himself. Very smooth Holmes, well done.
The walk to the coffee shop takes only a few minutes but it's long enough that Sherlock's nerves begin to resurface. It's just coffee, there's no reason for his heart to pound, his stomach to flutter, his palms to feel clammy.
I clarify one final time that there are no vaults, that everything exists inside that skull, that brain I intend to obliterate. I remind John one final time that I am not to be loved, I am a sociopath. And I pull the trigger.
Watson smiled at me ruefully and retreated to his chair, nodding at my groin meaningfully as he sat. I gathered my dressing gown around me to conceal my current state. Lestrade is not usually terribly observant but it would not do to be caught so.
“Ok then,” John replied with icy pleasantness, “in that case you’re benched.”
And now I’m standing looking at an empty cupboard. No vaults. No secret files, no evidence to destroy. That’s not entirely accurate though, is it? I mean, there isn’t any evidence but there is still something which must be destroyed.
Mycroft tried to tell me, in his way. Bloody Mycroft. Of course he knew, he’d seen, could see. He was always good at reading these things. I struggled. He made sure I was painfully aware, in my youth. Still does. I have improved but I still slip up every now and then. Before, I had John to keep me right. Now? Things are different. As Mycroft once said, am I really so obvious? Appears that I am.
"Me too," says John, "maybe we can do this again?" Sherlock nods shyly and his eyes widen as John moves closer to him. John leans up, giving Sherlock plenty of time to move away but Sherlock tilts his head closer. Still smiling, John presses a featherlight kiss to Sherlock's cheek.
I tilted my head haughtily, "I am never decent," I replied. He laughed. "Indeed, my dear boy, it is one of my very favourite things about you."
Before they've realised the time the afternoon has passed and John reluctantly stands up to leave. Sherlock pays for their drinks, ignoring John's protests, and gives Molly a large tip. She winks at him in return.
I sit in the open window, idly blowing smoke up into the night sky. John will be angry with me for the cigarettes but I need them, tonight of all nights. He's angry with me anyway so might as well do something, anything to make it stop.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock barked. Ah, the elusive brother then. John stood up and extended his hand.
He told me once that he couldn’t go back. He said it so quietly that I almost missed it, lost in the feel of his hands on my skin as he changed the dressing on my chest. It was the closest we’d come to speaking about anything more than the weather or my health or tea or any number of hideously mundane subjects. I don’t love her anymore, he’d said. I’m not going back. I knew he would, in the end. He is too good a man to not to. He said he didn’t love her anymore, but he could not punish a child.
John looks up and smiles as soon as he enters.
“What?” Vic asked, frowning. Seb just smirked and looked away towards the other side of the canteen, where Molly and her friends were sitting.
Sherlock vows to collect all of the many different colours and shapes of post-it as exist in the world, just for John.
Sherlock glanced up at the sound of the front door slamming. He closed his eyes and counted. 15, 16, 17… John stepped into the flat looking mildly the worse for wear. Four, no five pints with Lestrade; soggy, disappointing chips for tea, walked home in the rain (why doesn’t he ever carry an umbrella?), cold, but seems fairly contented.
"Yeah, love?"
He sets down the wine list and glances up through his lashes, not trying to be coy but doing it anyway. John is watching him, and his eyes flick from Sherlock's open collar, to his mouth, and back up to his eyes again. He smiles approvingly and Sherlock flushes anew.
Sherlock barely has time to process this before the next message comes in.
"I- er," Sherlock fumbles. John laughs and again, Sherlock has the odd feeling that for once, it's not aimed at him. Well, it is at him, he supposes, but not in the usual way. It gives him a strange sensation in his chest.
"Sherlock? I need to check on you," John says quietly through the door. I don't answer. Just go, John. Don't bother.
"Oh honestly, Mr Holmes! I told you and Dr Watson here that I was to be visiting with my sister across town for a day or so for Christmas, and you should have to make your own meal with the provisions in the pantry! Dr Watson assured me you would be able to manage a light dinner between you. I should think with a little thought you might be able to provide a lovely feast for the dear Doctor!"
Sherlock had no desire for this turn of the conversation. Bad enough that his own mind was drowning itself in melancholy thoughts of the one person he missed most dearly. They drank in silence for a few moments. Sherlock could feel the pilot’s eyes studying his face, his over-long hair, his scruffy overcoat, but when he met the pilot’s gaze the man just smiled sadly and looked away. Sherlock longed to be clean-shaven and in his own coat. It was a silly thing to miss. Sentiment, he scolded himself.
It turned out that the rugby team’s bullying didn’t come up the next time John saw Sherlock. He found himself huddled over an enormous book about serial killers in the lunch break, listening to Sherlock’s hushed voice telling him all about H.H. Holmes in Chicago. Sherlock seemed fascinated, and John was happy just to listen. It was a really interesting topic anyway; how he’d gone so long without being caught. John didn’t think anything of it as they leaned over the book together, heads almost touching as Sherlock traced the drawings with his fingertips and explained the limited forensic methods of the time.
John chuckles and heaves him off to the side. Must've said that last out loud then. Cold air rushes in as John gets up and leaves the bed. Icy disappointment and rejection instantly replace the warmth of John's touch and kisses and Sherlock tries not to do anything pathetic like curl into a ball and cry. No matter how much he feels like doing exactly that, he'll preserve a modicum of dignity if he can.
The library is quiet as Sherlock makes his way through the stacks towards his favourite spot. Tucked away on the second floor, beside musty rows of rarely accessed volumes, Sherlock's spot is peaceful; not too warm in summer, not too cold in winter, far enough from the lifts and the loos that nobody walks by , close enough to the stairs that he can hear snatches of his peers' ludicrous conversations in the stairways. In other words, the perfect place for him to think, do some spring cleaning in his mind palace, store away tidbits of gossip, or type up his notes.
John came back into the sitting room carrying a bundle of spare bed linens. He strode over to the sofa and dumped the bundle in a heap.
John crossed his arms and regarded his friends coolly. “And you’re telling me this why?”
John's face is flushed, his pupils blown to eclipse all but a thin circle of blue, his lips are reddened and he is licking them unconsciously as he stares back at Sherlock. Sherlock is elated; he did that.
Not yet, not yet...he tried to tell his body. The intense pleasure sweeping through him was becoming too much and he tried desperately to hang on. He couldn’t come first, not yet…”John!”
I shrug and go back to my violin. His phone trills in his pocket and he retrieves it, not looking at me. I watch him as he reads whatever message he received and then without another word he stands, hooks his umbrella over his arm and turns to leave.
I shudder and move my hips, tilting them to relieve some of the pressure on my now straining erection. I groan and lean up into his gentle kisses in my hair. It's blissful and wonderful and I never want him to stop.
"May I kiss you, Sherlock?" he asks.
Sherlock sat up, nose wrinkling at the tacky, dried sweat and come on his chest and stomach. “I need a shower,” he announced, getting out of bed and stretching. He walked to the bathroom door and stopped, turning to look over his shoulder shyly. He extended his arm to John, who was looking a little lost among the rumpled sheets.
John stops and buries a hand in my hair, stroking through the curls and tugging lightly. I moan again; how can he immediately know all of the buttons to press to reduce me to a quivering wreck?! It is both a welcome development and a terrifying one. John is shushing me as I tremble, stretched out beneath him with my bottom as far in the air as it can go with his weight settled pleasantly on my legs.
Sherlock nods to Molly, who hides a smile as she prepares their drinks. They sit down at one of the three tables squashed into the tiny shop. Sherlock feels John's knee pressed against his and, feeling somewhat daring, he shuffles a little closer. They're not looking at each other but Sherlock can feel John's smile as if it were the sun itself shining on him. Molly brings over their order and a slice of chocolate cake, accompanied by two forks. Sherlock shoots her a look but she just shrugs and goes back to scooping beans out of the giant bag into jars. She pretends not to watch them and Sherlock pretends not to notice.
"I want to try again. Now."
The flat is suspiciously quiet when Sherlock gets back. He glances around, taking in the mess caused by four young men living together in a relatively small space, and remembers - ah, the athletic union ball, that's where his flatmates (if one can call them that) will be. Trying to get off with the girls on the hockey team, no doubt, or trying to keep up with the rugby team's drinking. Sherlock's mouth twists into a gleeful smirk. Seb in particular is going to feel that in the morning, if the rugby team's reputation is anything to go by.
"I-" he starts, then stops. John waits patiently. "I really enjoyed this," Sherlock says in a rush, not meeting John's gaze. When he finally does look up John is smiling again. Always with that damn smile, Sherlock thinks dazedly.
"Morning, sleepyhead," John says softly, tilting Sherlock's face up to bestow a light kiss. Sherlock wiggles and snuffles, throwing his arm over John's legs and hugging them tightly. John laughs and ruffles his curls.
“Your brother’s a bit of a twat, then,” John said matter-of-factly. He turned to look at Sherlock, who was rubbing his arm, his cheeks pinkened again. John raised one eyebrow in mockery and then they were doubled over, giggling.
The soft puff of Sherlock’s breath across her ear was almost too much. John jumped out of the wonderful cocoon of the bed and turned to stare at Sherlock. Her eyes seemed to be glowing in the low light of the room, sable curls fanned out across the crisp white linen, full lips drawn into an increasingly uncertain smile.
Mike shrugged. "And ze boys, if zat is what you like," he murmured quietly. John blinked at him for a moment, feeling the beginnings of a blush creep onto his face. He stuttered a noncommittal reply and followed Mike to French, forcing himself not to watch out for a tall boy with luscious dark curls.
“What?” John snapped. Sherlock just sat there, frowning. Watching. Always bloody watching. Fine. John would just ignore him. Clearly he was thinking about something, deducing how crap John’s day had been. Well, fine. John had tried to explain to Sherlock before why this particular thing pissed him off so much, but it seemed Sherlock had deleted it.
He stops when he feels something stuck in his pocket. He pulls it out and unfurls it in his hand. It's another post it.
Sherlock broke the kiss to lean up on one elbow, his other hand snaking down between them to wrap around John’s aching erection.
He’s ruined this. Somehow, he’s ruined this and now John will leave. John will leave and this will be all Sherlock ever has. "Hold that thought," John mutters, getting up off the bed again.
“Mmm, Sh’lock,” John mumbled through a mouthful of hair.
He strokes my cheek with such tenderness and I hear him chuckle softly, wetly. I don’t dare open my eyes for fear that this is all an illusion. He shifts and I feel him come closer. The first brush of his lips to mine is tentative and fleeting.
"No, no Sherlock," he soothes, lifting away my pillow and forcing me to bring my arms up to support my neck and head. "I want to hear you, I want to hear every gorgeous noise you can make, love," he says. Then he lowers his head and begins lapping at my hole, kissing and sucking and licking and...
John tried not to flush and bit his lip. Yes, he was having a hard time concentrating but the reason wasn't anything he wanted his teacher to know about.
', the note announces. Sherlock looks at John, who is grinning widely back at him, leaning back on his hands and pushing his own chest forward, eyes shining with such happiness as Sherlock thinks he is glowing with it.
He so badly wants this to go perfectly. He wants to be funny and charming and to hear John laugh and to see John smile at him. He wants to hold John's hand across the table and brush their legs against each other under the table. He wants John to kiss him when they leave, to kiss him properly, on the mouth. He wants John to come back to his crappy flat with him, to sit on his bed and kiss him some more. He wants to feel John's hands on him, unbuttoning his shirt and stroking his chest while John kisses his throat and-
"Get this crazy bastard off me!" the thief yells with a fresh bout of wriggling. "I didn't do anything!"
“Y-you… you think we’re… friends?”
His thighs are quivering under the strain of leaning over John, propped up on one hand. John stops licking his hand and Sherlock wraps around both of their cocks, stroking them in time with the rocking of their hips against each other. Sherlock tries to kiss John but his orgasm is curling low in his belly and waves of pleasure wash powerfully through his whole body with every movement. The result is uncoordinated and clumsy but John doesn't seem to mind. If anything he seems almost as incoherent as Sherlock.
But no, I know I am all the better for allowing myself to love. And I do. So wholly that I often fear I will consume everything and leave nothing behind but an empty shell. It drives me both into John's arms and to reject them coldly, as I did tonight.
"Y-you-?" Sherlock squeaks, internally screaming at his own brain to get a bloody grip! John laughs again, but strangely it doesn't feel like he's laughing at Sherlock, despite his apparent lack of comprehension.
'Stop drinking the cafeteria coffee and you might be better able to retain what little knowledge your lecturers impart.'
The lunch bell interrupted Sherlock mid-flow and he stood abruptly, gathering his textbook into his leather satchel.
I felt its familiar pull when I took the call. Mycroft’s smooth tones informing me that the plan had been put into motion. The plan he had devised to prevent me from returning to an assignment I would be unable to complete. I do so hate to leave things unfinished. But we didn’t know then what we know now. And now it’s too late.
John clenched his fists and suddenly became aware of a shift in the room. He was definitely outnumbered; Seb was backing off but Phil and Carl were itching to start a fight alongside Vic.
"Here," John whispers, reaching up and deftly flicking Sherlock's trousers open as he reaches in to pull him free. Sherlock sighs with relief, then figures out what John has in mind. He leans down and lets go of John's cock to bring his hand up to John's face. John takes the hint with a smirk and licks Sherlock's palm wetly, lavishing it with his tongue. Sherlock has to close his eyes again. If sex with John is like this every- He cuts that thought off. There's no guarantee of a next time, he warns himself.
Sherlock snorts. He isn't especially interested in who's getting off with whom among the student body. He isn't lonely, he tells himself. He has his work, his research, his plans for postgrad studies and maybe his doctorate. He isn't lonely.
His hiccups however were threatening to derail the entire endeavour. John quickly snapped the incriminating photos as Norwood paused in his typing, head cocked to one side. He was listening intently for the tiny squawking sounds for which Sherlock had been responsible. Desperately trying to stay still and silent, Sherlock held his breath. John watched through the gap in the doors and they both breathed small sighs of relief (Sherlock internally for fear of squawking again) when Norwood resumed typing at an even more hurried pace than before.
She tutted at my rudeness and shook her head affectionately. Watson set aside his newspaper and rose from his chair. "I shall see you out, Mrs Hudson," he announced, his hand at her back as he escorted her downstairs. As he departed he looked pointedly over his shoulder at me and winked. I coughed on my tobacco smoke and recrossed my legs once more.
“Come back to bed, John. Please?”
'Removing your illegible and inaccurate notes does not constitute tidying.'  He leaves it sticking out of the OED, open to the page on which the definition of 'tidy' is displayed.
“If I can get Mycroft to fire Theresa May, will you give me a blow job?”
“Yes, it is,” Vic said defiantly.
That afternoon, as John trotted off to rugby practice, he was still thinking about that tiny smile of Sherlock’s. It was almost like a ‘v’, that smile, curving his full mouth into an odd but lovely shape. He was looking forward to seeing it again at their tutoring session after rugby.
It is a perfectly normal Sunday evening and we are watching something I have already deleted the title of on telly. John is mildly absorbed in the so-called action on screen and is chuckling at my ongoing, disgruntled commentary. The film is wildly historically inaccurate and the plot is simply ludicrous. John laughs as I yell. I gesture expansively in my indignation and he merely laughs harder. He shoots me a pointed look before doubling over in a fit of giggles at my expression. I refuse to admit I am, as they say, hamming it up a little for his benefit. I stand by my original assessment -  the premise is utterly ridiculous.
"Please."
"S'nice," he mumbled, "love your touch." Sherlock's nerves melted away completely with that simple statement, and he cupped John's face with his palm, tilting John's head up for a languid kiss.
Sherlock closed his eyes. He was tired, sore and not especially eager to move on. Part of him was itching to complete this, to finish it and get home. Another part of him was quietly terrified of what lay ahead and what awaited him when he finally returned. The last place on the list was perhaps the biggest challenge and more dangerous than anywhere else he’d been. The all too brief respite offered in a dive bar bottle of cheap, shitty whisky was rapidly turning sour in his gullet.
He crossed the room and dropped to his knees at my feet, his hands resting on my thighs. The heat of his palms seared through my thin dressing gown, his touch a welcome brand upon my skin. I tried to contain the warmth pooling in my middle at his proximity.
I decide to ignore it and I look up at John, attempting to project my usual aloofness.
It isn’t my fault, I know that intellectually. This is not my fault. And yet my mind cannot seem to help but trace everything back to my most fatal error. My grossest miscalculation. John always pays for my mistakes.
I was trying to smile at John, be reassuring and confident, but apparently my face is showing far too much. I hastily get my expression under control. I let cold distance cross my features and throw my sharpest glare at Lestrade and the thief.
“Brilliant,” John said, grinning.
"Alright love?" John asked again. Sherlock's mind stuttered to a halt for a moment at the endearment. He pulled back, opening his eyes. John's smile was soft and joyful. "Alright?" asked John again, and he took one of Sherlock's hands in his, twining their fingers together. Sherlock nodded and stared in amazement at their joined hands, revelling in the feel of John's palms against his own.
From that Monday morning, John kept catching himself not paying the slightest bit of attention in chemistry. He'd gone from being nearly top of the class to barely scraping through. All because of the boy in front of him.
“You can stop hovering in the hallway, John.”
“Sherlock?”
This statement pulled John up short and he looked questioningly at Mike. Mike shrugged. “I like him,” he said simply. Greg nodded in agreement.
John's gaze doesn't falter as he springs up off the desk and gestures to the door. "Shall we?"
Foolish, Sherlock scolds himself, such thoughts are pointless and foolish. He only has two more semesters to get through then he can move straight into his postgrad. By then he'll be of age to access his trust fund; Mycroft can't hold onto the purse strings once he turns 21, it's in his parents' will.  Then he can get a flat to himself, focus on his research and maybe, once he has his PhD, maybe then he can start his consulting business, like he'd dreamed of when he was little. Independent, self-sufficient, admired for his talents and his mind. Alone.
John’s vision went red and he turned on his heel to storm off. Greg and Mike hurried to catch up as he marched across the pitch. Greg grabbed John’s arm and halted him in his tracks.
“So, that biochem module,” John starts. Sherlock snorts.
The room was dim but cozy, and John looked around before stepping in behind Sherlock. Sherlock tugged off his long coat and tossed it carelessly over a chair, then stood in the centre of the soft carpet, hands on his hips and his eyes on John. John turned in a circle, a slow smile creeping over his face.
Alright? He asks. I nod. He kisses me again. I hope he never stops. Six months is a long time to wait, and yet no time at all.
Sherlock sits down and takes off his coat, reaching for the hot coffee. John was right; it’s bloody baltic outside. He’s just raising the cup to his lips when he notices John has gone very quiet. He glances at him over the rim of the cup and almost pours the steaming liquid into his lap at what he sees.
Sherlock kicks aside a pile of dirty laundry in the hallway as he makes for his room. He hardly spends any time here, only dropping by when he has to sleep. Most of his time he splits between the old library and the labs, researching and conducting experiments into the wee hours. The janitorial staff in the labs have gotten used to seeing him there, hunched over a microscope or scribbling in his notebooks. A few kind words in the ear of the head janitor from Mrs Hudson and they mostly leave him alone. He doesn't conduct anything dangerous in there; after several small and one or two... More significant explosions at school prior to be accepted at university, he learned to keep his more destructive experiments to his makeshift lab at home. Besides, it's more fun to destroy expensive ugly furnishings of Mycroft's choosing, however accidentally, than to potentially lose another of his favourite spots on campus.
Leaning against a wall away from the main street, Sherlock regains control of his ability to perambulate. He pushes off the wall, shaking dust from his coat, and strides purposefully towards the restaurant. He is going to be a perfect date for John Watson.
I stand unsteadily, shrug off the stupid blanket from my shoulders and wave away Lestrade’s proffered arm. I am a bit not good at this, I know. I walk over to John and sit beside him.
"William Holmes, he's going to tutor you," she said easily, as if John's stomach hadn't just fallen out of his arse.
Their tutoring sessions continued in the library until, one afternoon, Sherlock unexpectedly announced that though his brother was home, they could study at his house that afternoon.
Sherlock’s unhurried pace was winding it tighter and tighter, and John fought not to just flip them over and suck Sherlock down to the root, tugging himself furiously as Sherlock screamed and came down John’s throat.
“Wait, wait!” John sat up and pushed Sherlock’s mouth away from the sensitive spot on her neck. Sherlock dutifully fell back a few inches, still lying as close as physically possible in their current positions, and began to pout.
Sherlock tumbled over the edge, crying out in ecstasy and spurting hotly over John’s hand and their bellies.
"Pity you didn't go join him," muses a soft voice to Sherlock's right. He startles out of his John-arse daydream to see one of the other players smiling down at him. The locker room is clearing now, most of the team heading home, leaving just Sherlock and this player. Also clad in only a towel, he sticks out his hand in greeting.
Tearing himself away from the distraction of John in his bed, Sherlock went back to his slides in the kitchen. Focus, he told himself, as a restful quiet settled over the flat once more. But focus was elusive and when it did come it was turned only on the man currently dozing in Sherlock's’ bed. He found himself wondering how John looked in sleep; was he stretched out on his back, or curled on his side? Was he warm enough, or cool enough? What did that marvelously expressive face look like as he slumbered?
"Should you what, John?" I snap. I don't mean to snap, I just cannot stand these moments where emotion dictates, rather than logic. Everything is so messy and so imprecise! But I cannot stop thinking about his calling me 'love', it repeats and repeats in my mind, endless echoes in my ears.
"It'll be easier for you, this way," John said encouragingly. Biting his lip, Sherlock gently grasped John's cock and gave it a couple of long pulls. Beneath him, John groaned and closed his eyes, pleasure written across his face. Smiling in satisfaction to himself, Sherlock guided the tip of John's cock to his hole and slowly began to lower his weight, taking his time and bearing down until John was fully inside him.
Sherlock looked at John curiously for a moment, then sat down at the desk and pulled out his own textbook. John watched him, admiring the graceful length of his neck, and didn’t miss the slight wince on his face as he reached down. It was gone as quickly as it appeared, and Sherlock began talking at his usual rapid pace, so John soon forgot it as he listened to Sherlock’s pleasant voice.
John is still frozen in place, his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides. He's staring at the floor but when I wobble on my feet he reaches out to steady me without thinking. His hand closes around my elbow and I manage to right myself. The fuzziness in my mind is clearing but I'm still lightheaded. We stand there a moment, deliberately not looking at each other. John snaps back to reality first, yanking his hand away from me as if burnt. My heart gives a lurch at the loss of his touch but I cover it quickly.
We argued earlier tonight. I remember every word, spoken and unspoken, that passed between us. It's my fault, probably. Usually is. He was trying to help, I think, but I was upset and I lashed out. I haven't done that in a while. Not sure why I did it this time, not even sure why I was really upset. He understands these things so much better than me. These tangled thoughts. Sometimes I wonder.
John nodded and lapsed into silence again. He neither needed nor wanted his chemistry teacher's help. They sat for a moment and John avoided his teacher's eyes. She sighed and leaned forward, her voice going soft as she spoke.
The moment is broken when the waiter comes back and rudely clears his throat. Sherlock jerks in surprise but John doesn't let go.
Breathless, euphoric, they lay in the soiled sheets, still exchanging lazy, chaste kisses. It struck Sherlock how silly it should feel, covered in each other’s come, yet kissing shyly. He felt an urge to laugh, barely suppressed.
"Yeah, love?"
"Hmm, yes," Sherlock replies, "I remember seeing you here."
Grunting in frustration, Sherlock pushed back from his microscope and placed his hands on either side of it, flat to the table. The smooth wood beneath his palms was cool to the touch, and he closed his eyes.
It was to be the first of many visits to that stupidly big house. They stopped visiting the library altogether, preferring to study in Sherlock’s bedroom instead. John learned that Sherlock played the violin beautifully, taking great satisfaction in the smile and flush on his face when John praised his music. Sherlock was also planning to go to uni in London; he had a distant relative with an empty flat right in the city centre, which she’d agreed to rent to him. John expressed his excitement about uni in London too, secretly thrilled that they’d be studying in the same city.
Tentatively he caresses John's cock with his fingertips. The reaction is instant, as John twitches and moans loudly, swearing under his breath as Sherlock takes this as positive feedback and takes up firmer strokes. He squirms as his own trousers get even more uncomfortable.
The phone is silent. Sherlock paces. The phone stays silent. Sherlock fiddles with his books and re-sorts his sock index. The phone is still silent. He picks up his violin and screeches a few arpeggios.
Awareness crept back in slowly. Sherlock squeezed his eyes closed and tried for a moment to claim back the restful peace a couple hours’ sleep had brought. Twisting his mouth in annoyance, he resigned himself to waking fully and began to take stock of where he was.
“You remind me of someone,” he said simply. “And I’m indulging my inner emotional masochist tonight, apparently.”
“Fine! I don’t want to be on a team that’s friends with faggots anyway!”
I am trembling a little now. His hand is also still on my ankle and I can’t tear my eyes away from his. He blinks once, twice, and seems to come to a decision. He lifts his hand from my leg and reaches out towards me. I unconsciously lean forward to meet his touch and when his palm reaches my face I breathe out shakily and close my eyes.
Sherlock got up from his chair, experiment forgotten. John was wriggling around with his duvet, trying to find the optimum position in which to sleep. Sherlock snorted as he grabbed the corner of the duvet and yanked. The optimum position for John to sleep was clearly in Sherlock’s bed. Obvious.
“You’re thinking too loudly.”
"John," I mumble in response, my body already reacting to his weight and proximity. This is going to be very embarrassing very quickly, I think desperately.
“Mmm,” John sighed, tightening his arm around Sherlock’s waist and pulling him back even closer to John’s body. A groan escaped Sherlock’s lips before he could stop it. John began slowly, maddeningly, grinding his hips into Sherlock’s arse. The heat of John’s erection pushing and sliding between his cheeks through his pajama bottoms was intoxicating and Sherlock struggled not to reach down under the waistband to touch himself. He could feel the pleasure building in his belly and groin as John huffed and rutted into his arse, humming low in his throat. It was impossible to resist, and biting his lip to muffle any sounds he might make, Sherlock snaked a hand down into his pajamas. He shuddered in John’s arms as he began to stroke, whimpering when John started to press sleepy kisses into his curls.
The restaurant should have been my first clue. Should have been. At the time I was too focused on getting back to
Twenty minutes later, John stepped out of the blisteringly hot shower and onto chilly tiles, feeling much more like his usual self. He dried off and tugged his jeans and a clean shirt on, rolling up the sleeves to his elbows and leaving the top few buttons undone. What? It was still muggy and hot in the flat, and if John wanted to leave his buttons undone he’d bloody well leave his buttons undone.
Oh, the feeling of his kiss made my heart soar. Light, delicate, a thing of promise, the heat between us no less with each passing minute, simply building towards an unstoppable conflagration, completion in every brush of our lips. It is a flame I will ere be happy by which to be most thoroughly consumed.
“The sofa will not do you any good and without proper sleep you will be grumpy and irritable tomorrow. I have no plans to rest tonight, therefore you will take my bed.”
"Crikey, what's wrong with him?" Lestrade asks, gesturing with his head to me.
I realise I am staring at his hand on my ankle. The telly switches off. I look up in surprise. John is watching me. His eyes are intense with something I can’t place and I bite my lip nervously. His gaze flicks to my mouth, then back to my eyes, then away. Then back again.
“You’re late.”
Those shirts are unspeakably tight, so Sherlock can see every taut line and breathtaking ripple of John’s powerful physique beneath it. John’s skin is shining with sweat, his hair tousled and his eyes bright with exertion as he breathes into the cool evening air after practice. He claps each player on the shoulder as they pass, heading for the ice baths and shower rooms. Many of the team are considerably taller, broader and stronger than John but Sherlock’s gaze is fixed, mesmerised by the captain as he jokes with his teammates. John glances around as the last of the team heads inside and a broad grin breaks across his face when he spots Sherlock, watching shyly from the sidelines. He trots over and Sherlock’s mouth begins to water at the casual strength in his stride. He licks his lips at the bulge of John’s thighs in his slightly too small shorts.
Tearing himself away from the vision John presented in his bed, Sherlock went into the bathroom to focus on the tasks that would enable him to feel all of those things, to experience that completion with John.
He thinks of his flatmates and his peers at the ball; loud music, sticky alcohol, bright lights. Yelling over each other, laughing, getting a bit pissed, stumbling home. Friends with their arms around each others' shoulders, giggling, listening to stories of a smile and a wink in the library, flirtations in group tutorials, meeting for coffee before lectures and invites to so-and-so's flat before the ball.
He sighs. The bed creaks as he shifts his weight and goes to stand up. Good. Leave. Go, I think.
"Now, if you'll excuse me," Greg says cheekily, whipping off his towel as he saunters away. Shouts of "cover it up Lestrade!" and "these bloody Frenchmen!" join John's giggles in the air as he shakes his head at his friend's bare, retreating arse. Sherlock takes a very brief moment to reflect that, purely aesthetically speaking, it's a rather plush, attractive arse.
He rounds the corner at the top of the stairs and makes for the desk he (and Mrs Hudson) think of as his. What he sees there pulls him up short and he gapes for a moment. His confusion quickly turns to annoyance.
“So,” he says.
Grumpily, he storms out of the library and towards his tutorial, nose buried in his phone. If he'd be concentrating properly he might've seen someone standing chatting to Mrs Hudson, a brilliantly warm smile on their face.
"You must be Sherlock," says a tall, silver-haired player, walking over with his hand outstretched. His smile is broad and his eyes sincere, confident and calm despite the fact that he's only wearing a towel. Sherlock gives a small smile as his hand is grasped in a warm grip. The man pumps their joined hands a couple of times as he speaks.
Oh God. John. That was….That was John’s-
Sherlock walks quickly over, coming up behind his mystery note leaver, mouth open to bark at them. He's startled into silence when the person giggles, then turns and says: "Finally caught me out, then?"
“Very clever,”the stranger mused, “I chose my drinking companion well, though I wasn’t exactly spoilt for options in a hellhole like this.”
He felt warm, and inexplicably, safe. He was cocooned in a wonderful embrace, soft puffs of breath ruffling the curls at the nape of his neck, a broad chest pressed against his back, and arm slung about his waist. He sighed deeply, contented to stay put, his mind hushed, and wriggled back a little into the comforting presence behind and surrounding him. There was a happy sigh from behind him and he gradually became aware of a hot, heavy feeling pressing into his bottom. Curious, he pressed back against it, causing another contented hum to emit from John. The feeling was pleasant so Sherlock wiggled again, and felt his own cock stir, rapidly hardening ad he realised what he was doing.
Sherlock smiles his agreement, secretly thinking John must be mad if he truly thought there was any way Sherlock wouldn’t turn up tonight.
"John?" My voice is muffled but I'm certain he hears my confusion. My heart beats wildly in my chest and a dangerous shard of hope lodges itself firmly in my throat.
"Yeah mate, nothing at all, except nick a priceless bloody book," Lestrade counters. "Let him up John, I'll take it from here."
All Sherlock can do is breathe a
Sherlock smiles, then catches himself. He thinks for a moment, biting his lip. Then he gets out his post it notes and scribbles something down before he can second-guess himself.
"You're so beautiful, let me show them, love, please?" John murmurs. "I want to show them how gorgeous you are when you come, I want to make you come in my mouth, love. Say I can, say I can suck you Sherlock, please love?"
John is sitting across the thief, one knee pressed to the man's back. The idiot is still squirming under John's weight but he's getting nowhere with John holding his wrists pinned. Distantly I hear Lestrade's voice and John shouts in reply, before turning back to me and grinning. The thief under him protests, loudly.
"Bloody hell, John," Lestrade says from behind John, his tone one of amused resignation.
“Roof’s leaked upstairs,” John said wearily. “All over my bed. Mattress is sodden, so I’m sleeping down here tonight. I’ll call a roofer in the morning.”
John shot him a glance that was equal parts fond amusement and cold steel. Sherlock shrugged helplessly as the shudders continued. John wrapped the arm with the hand not plastered to Sherlock's face around his back and gripped tightly, bringing their bodies even closer. Sherlock did his best to suppress the traitorous trembling his transport insisted on. He fidgeted and shuffled, but John just squeezed him tighter.
"He got a knock to his head, that's all," John says, stopping in his tracks, his back to Lestrade. He's frowning at me.
"John?"
My brain is slowly going completely offline. All I am aware of is John's mouth on me and his last word. 'Love'. John called me 'love'. I hear him saying it again and again, echoing in the corridors and hallways and rooms and gardens and all of the spaces in my mind.
"Please Sherlock, let me touch you, let me please you," John begs, hands pulling gently at his arms to encourage Sherlock up into his lap. Sherlock barely needs any invitation and gets up unsteadily so he can move to straddle John. John lets go of his arms and leans back on his elbows to gaze up at Sherlock hovering over his groin. Sherlock immediately commits the picture of John beneath him to memory.
"Greg, Greg Lestrade," he says. "We've heard a lot about you," he continues, "John hardly shuts up about his gorgeous genius!"
John looks a bit stunned, a bit bashful and a whole lot delighted. His smile is warm and genuine and Sherlock can't keep staring at John like that, it scares people. So he's been told. He looks away, the brilliance of John's acceptance too bright to his eyes. John reaches out and twines their fingers together across the table. Sherlock's sharp intake of breath makes him hesitate, and Sherlock instantly curses himself as he tightens his grip and refuses to let John take his hand back. He looks up and they hold each other's gaze as John rubs gentle circles into the back of Sherlock's hand with his thumb. Sherlock thinks he could die here, right now, and know nothing but happiness.
Over the next few days Sherlock is absolutely not looking out for a reply from the desk messer. Nor he is disappointed when no reply appears. He is however glad that his chosen desk is no longer subject to the whims of a sloppy-eating sporty medical student failing a simple chemistry module.
Sherlock slams the bedroom door shut and drops his bag beside the scruffy bed. His room is the cleanest in the flat but that's not really saying much. There are journals and research papers strewn over every flat surface, books piled high in the corners, filched glassware and pipettes in a box below the window. The skull, given to him as a gift by Mrs Hudson in his first year, sits proudly on the tiny, crappy IKEA desk he bought to replace the one which mysteriously caught fire that first week. Odds and ends, scattered throughout the room, make this impersonal space feel more like his own, giving personality to the cookie cutter rooms which make up the shared student hall flats. Were it not for his obnoxious flatmates Sherlock might spend more time here.
John leaned down to capture Sherlock's mouth once more in a searing kiss. Sherlock's breath hitched as John's slick finger circled his entrance, and he pushed up into John's mouth on his. John smiled against him and began pressing kisses down his neck, across his shoulders, before moving down his chest again. His hands dropped to brush through John's hair, loving the feeling of the short strands between his fingers.
"Oh god, yes."
"No!" Sherlock gasped, "John, please.."
He stretches, extending his arms high above his head and pulling his back straight, rolling his shoulders before settling back down again. A tiny sound echoes from the other end of the room, behind the carrels of dusty old books. Sherlock frowns and peers around his computer, looking for any sign of movement. There is none. He starts to get up, intending to investigate, then pauses. No, stick to the script and catch the person in the act. If it's Seb, he'll be disappointed but unsurprised. All the more reason to find a flat of his own as soon as humanly possible.
John's laugh is self-deprecating but utterly charming. "Well I was going to leave one more note about that coffee," John tells him, "but seeing as you're here..."
“Fine,” he mumbled. “Do this for me and I’ll take Mummy and Daddy to Cats.”
He knows better than to hope. But he can't help it if his heart flutters just a tiny bit, the wish more tempting than all the lemon cakes in Mrs Hudson's fridge.
“You’re just too clever for your own good,” John says warmly. Sherlock looks away, remembering the last time someone told him that. Their tone was considerably more Arctic than John’s, and there followed a rather painful connection between the boy’s fist and Sherlock’s face. The memory of Mycroft’s expression when he’d arrived home from school with tears in his eyes and yet another note from the headmaster swims before him.
', says the post-it over John's heart.
Gradually, Sherlock began to open up about himself. Understanding that this represented an enormous amount of trust from a boy who, as far as John could tell, had no other friends, John treasured every morsel he learned and every nugget Sherlock shared. He was not-so-secretly delighted that he got to see a side of Sherlock that no-one else had, thus far, even glimpsed.
He could barely believe this was real. Only a few days since he had finally given up holding back and allowed just a fraction of the desire he felt for John to show on his face, for the briefest of moments. It was all that John had been waiting for, closing the distance between them to press their mouths together in a perfect kiss. Sherlock's lips tingled at the memory of that first, almost painfully tender embrace, and he flushed a little at the thought of the kisses that had followed. John had backed away slowly and reluctantly, insisting that they go slowly. Sherlock was equal parts annoyed and grateful for John's strength in this. He had found himself unexpectedly tentative and shy, relying on John's gently guiding hand and whispered admiration in these early days. As a small boy he had struggled to interpret his emotions and would often find himself overwhelmed to the point of lashing out in frustration. John was patient and he was kind, never patronising, and never hurtful. Somehow it seemed John instinctively knew exactly what Sherlock wanted and needed, and he merely acted on this knowledge.
Sex had never been like this. John had always held back part of himself, unwilling to be utterly exposed. But he had no choice with Sherlock, and he didn’t want one. He meant it when he said it; only Sherlock could draw him fully into anything and everything - in bed, on cases, just lounging around the flat. The bone-deep love John felt for Sherlock terrified and delighted him. He could no more refuse to give all of himself to Sherlock than he could refuse to breathe.
"Sherlock!"
John trudged home, the heat of the July day soaking into him and making him even more irritable. To say it hadn’t been the best of days was severely understating matters. He’d gotten a locum shift in the A&E and spent most of his non-patient time watching the news with the other doctors.
John breaks the kiss and trails his fingers down Sherlock's chest, playing with the buttons of his shirt as he presses feather-light kisses to Sherlock's neck. His kisses leave a trail up to the inexplicably sensitive spot behind Sherlock's ear that Sherlock is sure will be visible for weeks. John is murmuring something against his neck and Sherlock struggles to make his brain focus enough to hear what John is saying.
