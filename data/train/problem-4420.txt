“What the hell? Why is Ivy's door locked?’ Dean said walking into Cas’s office the door was open.
Sam and Harper shook their heads at him and laughed a bit.
“We were in separate group homes for a while and she wasn't the same after that. I don't know what happened she refuses to tell me anything from those years. I was hoping it would have happened by now, ” Dean said shaking his head, he stood up and paced the room.
Castiel made his way over to Harper, taking her by the hand guiding her to stand; he hummed and smiled before looking her in the eye.
When the Alpha got home, he opened his laptop, hoping to find something good to watch to get some relief. Putting things away while the thing booted up, Cas settled on his bed with his laptop set up off to the side and everything else he needed. Cas undressed and laid down.
“Why are you covered in dirt?” Dean asked, pointing at her. She had dirt smeared across her face, shirt, and pants. The wince on her face as she attempted to cross the room.
TRIGGER WARNING; ABUSE
"Stella will be back tomorrow, we found out she has a hearing loss, and Jimmy got her a hearing dog in training so she will be coming tomorrow too," Cas told Becky when he dropped off Dean.
The boy let his head hang low and shook it, signifying he knew it he was just a normal human who got dumped at the wrong Orphanage. The older witch smiled and said all good things come in time, no sense rushing them.
It was nice to see Blue's mood had improved, but Cas figured she could be more herself when her parents weren't around.
Harper helped Dean up, and they headed out and down to the manager's office to tell them the mirror broke, almost killing Dean. They looked around for Sam as he was gone along with the Impala. Harper helped Karen load all the books and stuff into the truck before they took off. Dean called Sam to see where he was; he said he was hungry and grabbed a burger. Dean scoffed as he wiped the blood from his ears.
Willow jumped and hurried back into the house with her head down, tail and wings dropping as well. Cas watched as John snatched at her by the arm, leaning in to whisper something in her ear. He couldn't make anything out, and he was sure he heard the girl whimper. He pretended he didn’t see anything when John looked his way, but in the back of his mind, Cas wanted to say something as he watched the two walk away, but the sound of honking pulled him from his thoughts. Glancing one last time at the closed door, he made a mental note to bring this up to his brother; he believed that John, more than likely, hits his kids. He growled in the back of his throat at the thought of John placing a hand on the twins, he wasn't excited about marrying Dean, but he didn't like the idea of him being hurt.
“Sammy is coming?” Blue said, spinning around looking at her Grandmother.
“I wanna know what she doesn't want us to know. I want her to be comfortable with me first,” Cas said, making his way back around the desk to sit down and make a few notes in Ivy’s chart. Meg went back down the patients' check and saw that she noticed a message for Ivy. Marv was bothering Ivy, trying to tell him a story. Meg separated them tell Marv he needed to respect that Ivy doesn't talk.
“This? This is my vessel,” Castiel replied like it was all supposed to make sense to them.
Jimmy asked if everyone was ready before he started the car and headed off to the office. It was a quiet ride no one says anything Stella would point and Dean would tell her the name if he knew what it was, Cas or Jimmy would fill in the blanks that Dean didn't know.
Dean leaned forward, “We have the biggest room?” he asked, looking at Cas.
"Stella needs help, ” Dean said, frowning his brow.
“I know we aren't that close anymore, but you can still talk to me,” Gabriel replied.
Carrying her to the nursery, he laid her down on the table, Cas had set up all her medicines and cream within reach for Jimmy. He grabbed a diaper had Stella lift her butt so he could lay it under her gently spreading the cream on all over, making Stella whimper a bit.
Cas sighed, wiping his eyes, getting up. He opened the door and walked away, figuring Gabriel wasn't going to take no for an answer; he headed into his kitchen, grabbing water from the fridge.
“Look, Stella, your Daddy is here,” Becky said with a smile, hoping that would help.
"You are right, James, it is between the two of you," Mitch said, going back to his food.
“Ok, she does need a punishment if you will, you can't stay for breakfast but do come for lunch” Cas said hoping that compromise was good for Dean. He wanted to stay on Dean's good side and make sure Ivy was getting what she needed.
“What's going on? You are going to wake up Ivy,” Meg scolded, waving them away in front of the girl's door.
Gabriel turned down a dirt road, or Dean thought it was a dirt road. It turned out to be the driveway leading up to the house. It was smaller than Dean thought it would be, seeing four Novak children and their parents. The closer they got to the house, the more of the vast property Dean could see the snow clouds rolling in over the property line, commenting they had made it just in time. There was another car parked in front of the house. Gabriel looked at Cas, saying they weren't expecting anyone other than Cas and Dean until the following day.
“I'll be back for dinner; she seems sad today,” Dean said, thumbing over his shoulder at his sister.
”Are you going to send her back?” Dean asked his voice thick with tears.
“I'm sorry I'm a little grumpy today,” Cas said softly.
Her best friend, the only friend she had ever known.
Jimmy fixed his coffee, taking a seat at the table next to Stella, who was looking down at her tray, not paying any attention to Jimmy, who was doing his best not to be upset that she was still mad.
Dean woke up the next morning to the sound of his alarm and a pounding headache; the last thing he remembered was Cas calling, punching the wall, and the bottle of whiskey. The damn bottle was half empty. He knocked it over getting up off the couch. Dean had to get to the garage this morning. He was working on restoration they paid more than his normal oil changes. Still, they took up a lot of his time; it cut into the amount of time he got to spend with Ivy. He showered quickly, grabbing something quick to eat and head off to work; hopefully, Bobby would notice he was hung over.
“Bullshit, I saw you die,” Harper screamed; this was just cruel whoever this imposter was, they were toying with her; she cocked the gun again, this time taking a steadying breath.
Castiel didn't say anything for a while, and Dean was starting to worry that he may have offended the bot in some way, or it was malfunctioning. He was going to have to send it back? He was caught off guard when the bot leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on his lips.
Dean covered himself up with one of the couch pillows. Once he realized what the bot was doing, “Don't do that,” he snapped, getting up and taking his cup into the kitchen once he felt himself calm down, Castiel right on his heels.
“Stop being a baby,” he snapped and turned his attention to Dean.
“Where’s Clove?” Sam questioned, coming back down the stairs after dropping his bag off in his room.
“It's him, it's Dean,” Karen yelled, grabbing Harper pulling her off of him.
“Is it because everyone else talks?” Cas asked, hoping he was wrong.
“What did I do?” Blue asked, looking around; the hurt and confusion in her voice made Cas’s heart hurt.
“What?’ Jimmy snapped.
“You got nothing to be sorry about. This is not your fault,” Dean said moving the paper before pulling Ivy into a tight hug.
“How old?” Cas asked with a bit more force this time.
“I know you don't talk, but can you write maybe?” Cas asked, hoping they could communicate to get her on the road to talking again.
He wanted to want more with Ivy he did, but he knew he couldn’t. She wouldn't let him get too close. Ivy's head on his shoulder and a little cuddling here and there was all she gave him, but it was enough. Jimmy wasn't going to push. He would wait until she told him to fuck off or welcomed him with open arms.
“Castiel, I'm assuming you forgot what today is,” Jimmy replied with amusement in his voice.
Dean moaned his response, making Cas chuckled, “I'll take that as a yes,” he said, admiring the red handprints.
Stella whimpered when the metal made a loud clunk when it hit the top of the cage Dean wrapped his arm around her telling her it was going to be ok they would have a new home soon, and she should sleep, she nodded and laid down curling close to Dean.
“Sammy, I love, but you know how I feel about my scar,” she mumbled under her breath, keeping her head down. Sam sighed in defeat and handed her the phone while telling her to stay put. He was going to get an ace bandage from the bathroom. Clover nodded as she unlocked her phone, checking all the missed messages from her internet friends.
“It's ok Ivy you don't have to tell us,” Cas said, “Can you go back to your room?”
“Salem took down a buck the other day, loves hunting,” Benny said before taking a giant bite of food.
“If you follow me, I'll show you around,” Meg said, making a waving motion as she turned on her heel and headed down the hall towards the day room.
“Where is what?” Dean asked, confused looking at Karen and Harper, before turning his attention back to the brunette
“No. I mean, if you didn't want to and I wanted you to, would you say no?” Dean asked, trying to get the bot to understand what he was trying to say.
The Omega turned towards the computer, and he could see the tiny thing between the boy’s legs. He loved to see that there was no hair there, just how he liked his male Omegas. He wondered how the boy knew when he got a message. He assumed it was a notification.
“Just for a night?’ Ivy wrote down pleading in her eyes.
“Tell me where we are going. Tell me about your parents. You never talk about your family,” Dean replied.
“Dean,” Jack whispered softly, reaching for him the moment Dean appeared in the doorway.
“I thought you were new? How do you know that?” Dean rebutted, turning his whole body to face Cas.
Cas followed her down the hall past the dayroom. He peeked in, spotting a woman sitting by the window, her dark blonde hair tucked behind her ear as she sat staring out the window. He wondered what she was thinking about. Meg caught his attention, telling him that the woman sitting in the window seat was Ivy Winchester. This day was no different than any other she was waiting for her brother; he nodded, telling Meg that he would see her last today and work out a schedule for all the patients. Meg continued down the hall, pointing to each of the patients' rooms telling Cas who was where their names were on the doors. She stopped at the second to last entry at the end of the hall. It was his office. They had scraped off the name of the previous doctor placing Cas’s name over it. Meg opened the door for him and handed over the spear key. He thanked her and stepped inside. The office was empty, a massive cherrywood desk, with a high back rolling chair by the window, an open bookshelf which was fine Cas would bring his own to fill it. There was a plant sitting by the window; the walls were a light blue.
The bakery was busy when Cas and Dean walked in; Mary started barking out orders to the boy to help. Complaining about how the castle was taking. It's time to send relief staff.
Stella glared at him and started signing faster than Jimmy thought was possible. Stella was grunting, trying to speak as she was signing, pointing forcefully at Jimmy.
She whimpered and shrank, making herself even smaller; ” I'm not going to hurt you; I am your new daddy. Can you say, daddy?”
“Don't you sass me! I said, get your ass down here,” Karen yelled.
“That's fucking weird,” Dean said out loud as he turned to the numbers on the lock.
“I love you, always kicking me out lately. What's up with that?” Dean chuckled.
“Brotha, you alright?” Benny asked, looking over at his best friend.
Benny knelt down next to the chair brushed the hair out gently out of her face placing the flowers he brought for her behind his back.
Jimmy carried Stella off to the other room she didn't put up a fight, Stella figured she would wait until he set her down.
“Yeah, and he likes her,” Cas said, sighing, “I am a little worried about this weekend,” he added, watching Ivy talk to Jimmy.
The smell was divine when Cas entered the house, the sweet scent of steaks cooked to suit his new palette. He wondered if Dean had told her he like his meat rare now or it was just the way they all like it. The food was spread out along the island in the middle of the massive kitchen. He was in awe, looking around; his apartment could fit in there, no problem.
Jimmy grabbed a blanket, handing it to Stella in case she wanted it, and sat down to read to her. Not more than three pages in, she curled up under the blankets and stuffed animals all around her.
Belle has become more than a hearing dog for Stella. She has learned all sorts of stuff.
“Sister?” Dean asked she looked up gave him a half smile, Still sad?” Ivy nodded as she wiped her eyes puling the sleeves of her sweater over her hands. “Benny wants to come see you tonight” he said she perked up and smiled a bit more as Dean pulled her in for a hug, “Dr. Novak around?” She pointed down the hall towards his office, “Someone in there?” She shook her head, she opened her mouth to say something but nothing came out she grunted frustrated she wanted to talk to Dean but it had been so long she wasn't she sure she could do it.
“And what visage is this? Demonic tax accountant?” Dean replied with an edge to his voice.
Charlie was behind the counter when Cas walked into the record store; she glared at him as he made his way through the aisle of records. “Still mad?” Cas asked after walking up to the counter.
“Eighteen,” Jimmy replied, trying to grab Cas before he stormed inside.
He stumbled into the bathroom, catching himself on the counter, his body weight too much to bear on his leg. Looking in the mirror, he blanched back at his appearance. Dirt, sweat, and dried blood smeared all over, his eyes a strange shade of blue until he blinked and they went back to normal. He splashed his face with cold water, hoping it would help this uneasy feeling that was setting in. He lowered himself carefully down on the edge of the tub, taking a deep breath unbuttoning his shirt slowly with shaky fingers. Stopping as his stomach decided to empty its contents onto the floor before reaching the toilet.
Gabriel talked the whole two-hour drive to Cas’s family home; he asked a ton of questions about Dean and his family, friends, pretty much anything he could think of, he asked Dean about it. They had a few things in common. Gabriel was a switch. He didn't have anyone at the moment. He went to a different school, preferring the one on the East coast, saying he didn't want the family name's stigma following him around at school.
”What happened to it?” Cas asked out of curiosity.
Jimmy asked if she understood, she nodded her head yes, and looked over at Dean he smiled at her.
“Dad makes a huge donation every year, and you don't get special treatment?’ Gabriel asked, looking at his little brother.
Stella was happily babbling to the animals when Bela came and grabbed the bear; Stella huffed, got up, and snatched the bear out of Bela's hand from behind, pointing to the bear and then herself.
“Are you Dean Winchester?’ the delivery guy asked, his tone bored.
“Cas is still sleeping. Please, it's been a long time since we have seen your face in a picture?” Dean requested, glancing down at his watch and smiling. All of the Winchesters were up with the sun, like usual. Dean stood and turned when he heard footsteps behind him. He saw his brother, who was now holding his hand out for the ace bandage. Sam handed it to him and sat down next to Clover.
"Ok, you wanna stop at the gift shop before we go?" Cas asked, holding out his hand.
“It's ok,” Cas said, looking up at Sam, “I guess I could stay,” the words were out of his mouth before he even knew what he was saying, his heart and his head waring at the moment but so see the look of excitement on Dean's face was worth the internal torment.
"Daddy, what's wrong?" Dean asked in a sleepy voice.
"Like Dean said no one cared, I guess they thought we wouldn't either," Cas said.
Dean was worried about going to daycare. He didn't want anyone being mean or making fun of his sister for not being able to do all the stuff, other people, their age could do.
Stella wasn't paying any attention to what they were saying. She Was looking around at the stuff, spotting some toys in the corner, and tugged on Dean's hand and pointed.
Cas walked over and took a look; Stella was inflamed, and red Cas was surprised she wasn't crying. He walked back to Dean, who was sitting up.
Dean laughed, and it was music to his ears. He explained that Cas wasn't as careful as he thought, one of the videos at the end showed his face. Cas shook his head and asked why he never said anything.
She gave a small wave in hello and then looked down.
“Yeah, man. I think Ivy be happy to see you,” Dean said. digging into his breakfast. Benny excused himself to got check on the other people who were in the cafe while Dean ate.
”Thank you. We got the twins today, ” Jimmy said, smiling.
Jimmy didn't reply. He didn't know-how; instead, he decided to sort of change the subject; “I'm going to ask you a question, and you don't have to answer, and please don't get upset, but you were talking in your sleep,” he said.
“Nothing, Ivy is fine,” Dean said, walking into the garage hoping the older man would drop it.
The heat and wetness were terrific, it had been so long since Cas had felt a real person He almost came right then as the Omega licked and sucked like his life depended on it.
Dean looked over at the Dom and smiled, “it's ok, Sir. Seeing family can be stressful,” he replied.
“I think she was sexually abused,” Cas finally relied after a few more moments of silence.
Cas nodded and explained that he did a web search for reasons why Dean wouldn't want him. So he assumed, after not finding anything, that if he took his clothing off, it would make him more desirable and have sex. Dean scoffed and shook his head at the comment. There may be more to this bot than he thought, but he was still going to wait. The bot did eventually get up to go find his pants after they were done talking.
”No, her brother said she couldn't talk, she makes sounds, but I don't know if they didn't care or what happened, ” Cas said rubbing the back of his neck Jimmy motioned for him to hand over the phone.
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.
“That's really weird, I know she's been here a long tim. Maybe when her file was moved from the kids ward they lost some of it. I don't know I can call down to records and see what they have there should be copies of everything,” she said looking through the file “It looks like someone removed a bunch of stuff.”
“You didn't see it the way her face lit up when he came swooping in,” Gabe complained, getting up to toss the bread back into the bowl to rise again.
Wren was in the break room at their table eating chips when Dean walked in. Taking a dollar from his wallet at the same time before he stopped in front of the vending machine, trying to decide what he wanted to snack on.
Harper got up and paced the room, slamming the book close, annoyed by the fact that they still didn't know what pulled them out of Heaven and then left them in their coffins. She said she was going to see what Karen had come up with.
“Um, Castiel?” Willow’s voice asked from behind him, startling him slightly before glancing over his shoulder to acknowledge the girl
It was a rough morning getting the babies ready for the day. Stellas medicine made her feel sick, which she indicated by rubbing her tummy; Jimmy said she needed it but would wait till they got home checking her temperature the fever was gone. Jimmy packed the diaper bags making sure there were bottles, wipes, and Stella cream before helping Stella down first, going back up and getting Dean.
Dean sighed, “What about your mom?” he asked.
Cas cover his smile trying not to laugh at Dean, he was adorable. He stayed in his office for a little longer before making his way down to the nurses station. He was smiling thinking about the time he was going to spend with Dean he didn't hear Meg come up behind him.
Dean sighed and looked at the other man, “I know I'm sorry, it was my sister.” he replied walking around the bar to start setting up.
“Yes,” Ivy answered, looking at the man.
This is the last time I'm writing in this stupid fucking journal. Why do I even keep this? I'm torturing myself by writing to you like it's keeping you alive. You are dead, and I can't handle it!
“It's me,” he said, holding up his hands when he spotted the gun, “Woah, Brat, I promise it's me, it's Dean,” he tried his best to convince her.
They got into the Impala, driving back to the motel; Harper took off, saying she would be back in a few hours and she had something she needed to do before heading up to the room. Dean questioned her, but Sam told him to let her go to what she needed to do. He finally gave in, letting Harper go but telling her to be careful.
“Patience,” the Dom growled, pushing himself into the waiting hole.
Ivy opens up a bit
“It's beautiful,” Cas said, looking down at the picture.
Ivy nodded very enthusiastically. She still had the paper and pen Cas had given her, writing furiously before holding it up.
Dean stopped eating and was watching making sure he wasn't hurting his sister, Cas told him they could play for a little bit and then a nap.
“Sis, Sam is right. We need a new picture,” Dean explained, moving closer so that he was now kneeling down to look at her ankle.
“No, you won't,” Dean said, looking at his siblings and back at the Angel.
“I'm Castiel,” he replied, flipping the pages of one of the books they brought into the barn with them.
Dean walked around a few feet in front of Cas, pointing to the cars he knew and asked Cas to read about the ones he didn't; they been walking around for two hours when Dean took off running Cas tailing behind him trying to see where he was going when Dean stopped.
Dean looked up at the jumbo jet and shuddered; the fear was starting to creep in being stuck in the air thousands of feet above the ground. No escape if anything should happen. His heart rate picking up the closer they got to their gate.
He flopped back onto the bed, covering his eyes with his arm as Dean sat next to him. Leaning over the other boy’s body while reaching for his hand and lacing their fingers together. He laid his head on Cas’ chest, listening to his heartbeat.
“Now he won't leave her alone. We all know she talks in her sleep we don't push she shuts down more.” Meg sighed and scratched her eyebrow. “The nurses and most of the orderly’s we love her ya know. She's been here a long time keeps to herself," she added.
See the endnotes for more details.
The ride was quiet all the way back to the house, an uneasy settling in their stomach, but neither one wanted to say anything. Because if they did, it would make it
“I'll be there in the morning. I didn't get a chance to tell Ivy before Anna took her, but I always come for breakfast when I don't have to work,” Dean said, getting to the point, so he didn't make a bigger fool out of himself.
"Because she is silver?" Dean asked.
“Hey, Dean,” she greeted with a soft smile.
“Today, we are taking a new picture. No hair covering your face,” Sam added, holding the phone to his chest. Dean folded his arms across his chest and gave Clover a nod when she looked up at him, eyes begging for her twin to say something. To change their younger brother’s mind. She scowled when Dean just shook his head, a sign that he was not getting involved.
“Happy to see they made up,” Cas noted, looking around at all the flowers that filled the halls, “Are there always flowers?”
“Can you hear me?” a light voice came over the speakers of his computer.
“She hides her wrists and Ivy has other marks on her but she wouldn’t talk about it, she started to wear long sleeves when we were like twelve,” Dean said before he turned and headed out the door.
Cas never thought that the video he took would come in handy. He emailed it to himself, downloaded it to the computer, and sent it to the Omega.
“She knows how to fight but Marv bothers her all the time she never…. Please don't restrain her it does something to her,” Dean rubbed his face thinking of all the times he had seen his sister restrained. “It's like all the life in her leaves I know it's policy for a patient who get violent. Still, she's my sister,” he pleaded.
Dean nodded and said he needed to get back to work thanked Cas for the use of his office so he could bring his sister a present.
”Oh, Dean!?” Jimmy asked nodding. Happy, she knew the D sound for Dean he most likely taught her.
Cas stepped out in the hall to get Dean, he told him to follow him inside shutting the door behind them before moving over to his desk to show Dean the package that Ivy had received.
Castiel smiled, “May I sit with you while you watch television?” he asked, the tone in his voice changing to sound happier.
”Stella, come on. Let's go get changed, ” Becky said, holding out her hand.
“We should go,” Wren whispered, moving away but held onto his arm to pull Dean with her.
Stella sighed and held her arms up; Jimmy smiled, picking her up, carrying her back to the dining room. His scent did calm her, but it wasn't enough to make up for the hurt he caused.
“I don't know. What I do know is he's just as pissed as I am. The sister seems sweet,” Cas replied as he grabbed the rag and glass cleaner to clean the countertops.
Stella looked at Jimmy and opened her mouth, ”you can do it, ” he said, taking a bite of his food.
“Fuck you,” Jimmy yelled. He promised Ivy that he would be there this weekend to work on his relationship with Cas.
“No, dammit Cas, I wouldn't. I promised Ivy that this weekend I would be on my best behavior. I wouldn't ruin it, and where would I get it from? I don't know anyone; no one visits me,” Jimmy said, standing up pacing the office.
“Oh, fuck. That's it,” Cas moaned, bucking his hips a bit.
He headed down the hall and into the kitchen, inhaling the sweet smell he adored. Dean's heart skipped a beat after entering the room, seeing the exposed back of Castiel. His muscles bent and flexed as he moved around the kitchen, it was hard to believe he was a robot.
Dean and Harper shook their heads; Harper sat back only to lean forward and grab the iPod out of the deck when some crappy song came on; Dean started laughing when Sam turned and watched his sister toss the iPod out the window.
“Blue, why do I have to wear this?” Cas heard his brother's voice complaining, pulling him from his thoughts.
Dean nodded, slightly dazed as he took hold of his sister’s hand. They headed towards the door, no one stopped them. When they were hired, the staff knew that Death didn't keep business hours, and the twins were drawn to whomever’s time had come to an end.
“Chuck tells me you work at the record store,” John stated, his voice sounded like it did not approve.
“I think we have the wrong room,” Dean said, tugging on Harper's sleeve to get her to follow him.
Harper sighed, "DO you even care?" she snapped, "you were gone, Sammy is fuck knows,” she rubbed her face, “So yeah,” she nodded again, turning away.
"They share better than we did," Cas said, watching as Dean told Stella about the car museum and about the new car he got.
Cas scoffed and left the room, heading up to his bedroom to think about what the hell was going on. There was no way this was legal. They were barely old enough to vote, and they couldn't drink. Part of Cas wondered if John was just trying to get rid of his children. He flopped back on the bed once inside the room, throwing his arm over his face trying to figure out what the hell he was going to do. A light knock on the door pulled him from his thoughts; he yelled to come in, assuming it would be Willow checking on him. He was surprised to see Dean.
“Ok, but did you bring my phone?” Clover inquired, not really caring that she had to stay off of her ankle or the fact that she was hurt.
Cas couldn't help but stare when he walked in; tall, muscular guy with dark blonde hair and green eyes, black jeans, a Zeppelin t-shirt under a plaid button-up, work boots made a light thudding noise on the tile floor. The ward was quiet. Cas was sure everyone could hear him breathing heavily. He was taken back by this man as he stopped looking at Cas before turning his attention to Meg.
I am attempting to edit all the chapters I am aware of all the mistakes in this story. Thank you for all the feedback.
“The King and Queen of the Unseelie court must becoming, they aren't super formal anymore either, but Gramma does love dressing up from time to time,” Dean answered, “After dinner, we can change.”
Harper pursed her lips and closed the book she was flipping through. Turning to look at Karen before she spoke, “Sam seems different, I don't know what it is, but…” she trailed off, shaking her head like she didn't want to believe what she was thinking. They were deep in research or trying to research when Harper heard the start of the high pitched whine, the faint scent of rotten Jasmine and burning vanilla. The whole feeling felt off and yet vaguely familiar, she rushed out of the room to check on Dean, Karen hot on her tail. Harper yelled Dean's name; he didn't answer, she rushed to his side, noticing the blood coming out of his ears.
Dean and Wren Winchester had been dropped off not too long after they were born with a note pinned to the blanket explaining that their mother had passed during the birth, and their father was nowhere to be found.
“Can I come in? I have a shift, and I need to get ready,” Wren’s voice questioned, a welcoming disruption on Cas’ part as she cracked open the door.
“I'm gonna go eat with Ivy,” Dean said backing up and pointing over his shoulder feeling like a fool when he bumped into the door frame as he walked out.
“The only friend,” Ivy said, making a point of it.
Cas laughed, saying good points, but tonight they were working out the details of his arranged marriage, so he had to go. Charlie nodded, saying how she thought it was weird that they were being married off like the seventeen-hundreds. Cas shook his head. He agreed with Charlie, but his dad needed the money John’s company could bring in if they merged, so here he was being sold off like a prized cow.
Ivy looked up when Jo called her name she had a box in her hand and a smile on her face. Ivy never got mail to this was exciting.
Dean looked at Cas. He shook his head, rushing up the stairs, his father and bother calling after him, “Cain, by the way,” Cas’s father said, holding out his hand.
“Better today than yesterday,” Ruby answered before making her way down the hall to her room.
It didn't take too long for both men to cum; Deann sighed with contentment when he felt the warmth of Cas’ cum slipping out of him.
“Ok, coz we friend only,” Ivy said, making sure Dean knew.
Cas spotted his brother sitting at a small table in the corner kneaded bread a bit too hard; he made his way over, asking what was wrong.
“Ok,” Ivy said, slowly looking at him with furrowed brows.
”And this is Stella, ” Jimmy said, setting her down in her chair.
Not all the caretakers there were cruel, the one next to them would show his boy all kinds of stuff, and Dean would listen, hoping he was doing it right and then show Stella, but she never got the hang of talking.
He worked the pant leg up, wincing as the rough fabric scraped against his skin. He let out a gasp looking down at the gaping wound in his calf; he was sure if he tried, he could fit his finger in one of the holes. He racked his brain; what the hell could leave a bite mark that deep. There were no known predators in the country, and all of the dogs were of average size. He carefully stood, attempting not to put any weight on his leg as it throbbed. Searing hot pain deep down in the wound that made his stomach churn, he moved slowly, not wanting to make the limb annoyed anymore than it already was. Eventually, he made it to the doorframe holding on catching his breath. Now he was sweating. The chills were gone, his body too hot, his skin felt wrong, too constricting. He wanted it off; it was a strange feeling not to want to be in your skin.
Ivy looked at him with tears welling in her eyes, she was embarrassed and angry. She didn't want him to see her like that, then he would know he would be the same as the other doctors. Cas made his way into the room sitting down on the bed next to her as she curled up into a ball.
“I know you're not stupid,” Dean sighed. He couldn't help but feel bad for her.
Becky agreed as Cas grabbed Dean's things and took his hand. Benny waved bye to them and then glared at Bela and Cole for being mean to Stella and ripping her bear.
Ivy made a face and nodded, those days were the worst she always worried about Dean.
Jimmy nodded and told Dean he could go back to Cas. They would be back soon. Dean nodded, hugging his sister, telling her to be nice before running back to the dining room.
"Oh, Stelly and I do everything together," Dean replied, looking out the window.
“Where go?” Ivy asked, sleepy.
“Stella, Daddy’s not mad, come out please, ” Jimmy said, smiling softly.
”That's right, I'm Daddy, ” Jimmy said, running the washcloth over her body.
“See ya” Dean said with a wave looking over at the game cabinet to see what was keeping Ivy and Benny. They both looked away like they were spying on Dean and Cas.
“I like cuddling with you too,” Jimmy smiled. It was nice not to expect anything, just enjoying each other's company.
“No,” Cas mumbled, pulling the blanket tighter, keeping Dean from letting the sunlight in; it was blinding how bright it was.
Harper started laughing when Dean told Sam he was not invited. She helped Pamela set up getting the chairs for her. Anything to keep busy. They sat around the table, the curtains drawn, making the only light in the room coming from the candles.
When he looked at his phone, he smirked, deleting the number his “date” had stuck in his phone. He saw a missed call from Charlie, his best friend in the whole world, the one person besides his twin who understood him. He tapped her name, putting the phone to his ear, listening to its ring. He smiled when she answered.
“What are you boys up to?” Rowena asked, glancing up at Dean and Cas for a moment before tending to the bird.
"We make do, and Elle has figured it out," Jimmy replied, strapping Stella in.
Ivy got her tray of food and found a table Ash came over to her she glared at him. She was pissed he broke her picture of her mom.
Dean and Sam both came up the signing they use to help Stella communicate, Sams person was a lot kinder and took good care of him and helped with Dean and Stella when she could, allowing them to play and hang out.
TRIGGER WARNING: Pain, transformation.
“Thanks, Meg,” Cas said not looking up from his computer.
Ash showed him a little baggy of his particular drug of choice and raised an eyebrow.
Reading the instructions, he looked up, “Castee-el,” Dean pronounced, looking up and waiting for the robot to open his eyes. He sighed and looked around, giving it a little more time before trying again. Maybe he was saying it wrong? Dean tried a few more times before giving up, deciding to get a coffee, swearing at himself for not going with a common name. Muttering the name over and over as he got everything ready to make his drink.
Stella unfolded her arms and sighed as Jimmy carried her back down the stairs.
“Yes, she does. I hear her,” Marv pleaded. He liked Ivy. She was always kind to him, especially when he first got there and didn't know that the window seat was where she waited for her brother, it had the best view of the parking lot.
They headed down to the kitchen to eat their food, Cas had reheated it for them when he heard them coming down the stairs.
"Is between Stella and I," Jimmy said, setting his glass down on the table.
“I'm sorry, I thought it was my car,” Sam scoffed, shaking his head.
“Something feels different,” she bit her lip, her gaze shifting to look outside. “I don't know how to explain it.” Wren added, her attention moving to look down at her lap before turning to her brother, “Do you feel it?”
”Stella, if you take it off again, you'll get a spanking, ” Jimmy warned, picking up the towel.
“Nice to meet you, Jo, I'm Cas,” he replied, shaking her hand, “How is everyone this morning?”
Cas rolled his eyes before turning around, “Father,” he replied with a smirk, opening his arms in a mock greeting towards his irritated-looking father.
Stella was trying to get a piece of sandwich in her mouth and kept dropping it. Her fine motor skills weren't that great. She gave up and looked at Jimmy and then down at her dress jelly was on the front of it she tried to cover it with her hand.
Mitch smiled at Stella, who looked up and smiled back, he seemed like a kind Alpha.
Dean frowned, lifting his sleeve revealing a large handprint branded into his arm.
“It perfectly fine, I happy you came to see me. My door is always open, ” Cas said, he wondered if the other doctors weren't so open with letting the patients drop in as they pleased if no one else was in the office. He watched as Ivy scribbled on the paper before holding it up for him to read.
Dean didn't know what to say, from what he had heard, sexbots didn't have feelings. They performed according to their programming. What was up with this one then? Why was it questioning him on what he wanted?
Ivy shook her head and looked away.
**********************
“So what? We are off the hook, and you’re on? We didn't wanna be saved like this,” Dean yelled, grabbing Sam.
It didn't take too long for the tailor to get them fitted, saying the clothes would be in their room when they needed them. If they could find Blue and have her come back to fix her dress, they would greatly appreciate it. Dean told them they would do the best they could to get Blue back and fitted before dinner. He grabbed Cas by the hand, telling him he wanted to show him the garden his Gramma loved out there.
“Um well she wasn't at breakfast, she wasn't sitting in the window seat either. She's always there waiting for her brother,” Ash answered sounding more worried the more he talked.
A loud banging on his door made him jump as he was lost in his thoughts of what could be the reason why he healed so fast. He grabbed the throw blanket off the floor, wrapping it around him before heading to the door.
Benny smiled wide at her, “That's right, I'm sorry it's been a while since I came to visit,” he said handing her flowers. Ivy smiled taking them looking at all the pretty colors, she reached for the pad and paper scribbling down a note,“You are forgiven.”
”We will have to take them to the doctors, ” Cas said.
“I think that's a good idea, it may give her a space to open up and start healing,” Cas said staring at Dean. he had a perfect jaw and those green eyes. “I'm sorry I need to get back to work make a few rounds check in and stuff,” Casadded feeling very nervous, why was he so scared? What if Dean didn't like guys? Cas knew Dean and Anna had a thing he could find out this weekend. “See you tomorrow?”
“That's basic shit; everyone knows that,” Harper replied, raising her gun.
Dean nodded, “I don't like you, but I will go through with this to keep my sister safe,” he said, leaving the room.
Cas paced the hall before he headed to the door. In two weeks, they decided to meet up, and it was the longest two weeks of his life. They talked, sent photos, but this was different. All kinds of scenarios were running through his head, like what if this guy brought a fierce Alpha friend and they robbed and murdered him?
“No one care,” Cas pipped up saying.
“Charlie,” Cas purred into the phone.
“I'm gonna go see my sister. Nice to meet ya, Cas,” Dean said, walking away with a cocky smile on his face.
Cas wasn't going to believe him. This was bullshit because Ash couldn't accept the fact that Ivy chose to be friends with Jimmy, and Ash couldn't handle it. This was bullshit. He felt like a kid again when his parents found his stash. Only this time, it was his twin brother staring at him. Jimmy had tuned him out the second he started talking.
“Breathe,” Cas said, holding Dean's face in his hands.
”Now, we will come back for lunch, ” Cas said as they entered the building heading towards the daycare.
“L...Love,” she said in her hoarse voice.
She frowned and wiggled out of his grasp, taking Dean's hand and following him. Jimmy sighed and followed, he should have known she wasn't going to want him to carry her, but it was worth a shot.
“It's ok,” Cas said in an attempted to reassure her that she could talk to him.
”Well, Son, I'll have the doctor come over in a few hours to check out that rash and see what he says, ” he replied.
Stella giggles when she twirled around make the dress fluffy out. Cas said it was time to eat picking Dean up. Stella held her arms up and looked at Jimmy; he smiled and picked her up.
Dean nodded and patted the cushion next to him while he grabbed the remote. He quickly found the Dr. Sexy marathon on TV and settled in for a while. He did not want to do anything for the next few hours. But he was aware of Castiel sitting next to him...still naked.
“You like that? You like being used?’ Cas questioned; he had no idea where this was coming from, but he was going with it.
Stella didn't back up this time. Jimmy cupped her cheek, staring into her hurt green eyes he knew he messed up, big time Jimmy would have to figure out how to get back on her good side.
“I asked you a question. Is it yours?” Cas repeated.
Ivy smiled and nodded in agreement. Dean was an amazing brother to her; she loved him a lot.
“Do you think he might be, like, half-fairy?” Wren finally asked after a few minutes. The thought of what Cas was and why he never showed signs of any gift was often thought about.
“That's cool,” Cas responded, not knowing what else to say.
Dean looked at Cas before opening the box and pulling out the rope, “Who the fuck sent this to her?” Dean asked his frustration and anger clear.
“Roy didn't know she could have the pen you gave her, she told him look,” Anna said handing him the papers.
Sam and Cas greeted each other. Cas inquired as to who or what Sam was looking at on his phone. Sammy shook his head, saying it was nothing and that Clover should mind her business. Dean laughed, saying he should show them his latest obsession. Sam pulled his phone back out with reluctance in his demeanor, opening the camera roll and handing it over to Dean and Cas.
Elle looked at Stella and then Jimmy, ”I'll tell you later, ” he said, getting a bottle from the cabinet and pouring the milk into it; Stella made grabby hands when she saw it, Jimmy handed it so her she sighed intently drink down her milk.
“No, because judging from the amount of flop sweat, you don't know who pulled us out, and you are just as scared,” Dean said. He then leaned over and slapped the waitress.
“What the hell?” he whispered, lightly touching the shredded part of the pants. He shivered as a chill ran down his spine; he grabbed the throw blanket off the end of the bed, wrapping it around himself, hoping that it would help ward off the cold feeling that was settling into his bones.
She nodded and curled up in the chair and closed her eyes it wasn't too long before Cas heard soft snores coming from the chair he smiled, she wanted to take a nap. Meg walked-in she was going to ask where Ivy was but she spotted her asleep in the chair.
“I promise,” Cas said, smiling at her.
The warm water felt amazing against his skin. The chills that had set deep down to the bone seemed to be melting away. He gasped in pain when the water hit the open wound. He looked down at his calf, watching the water wash out the dried blood and dirt. It was nasty looking; the flesh was torn clean down to the muscle; he hated the thought of having to go to the hospital to get it checked out. The fever subsided for the remainder of the shower. He was happy, thinking that the hot water helped. He was wrong; his stomach turned as he accidentally swallowed a bit of water, giving up due to his leg pain.
Jimmy turned on the monitor before leaving the room with Cas. They headed back down to the kitchen to talk to Elle.
“You know she only eats when you are here,” Meg said, a bit of sadness in her voice,
“Dean, there's a reason I wanna know” Cas sadid kneeling in front of Ivy, “I'm not mad I just need to know why?” he said placing his hands lightly on her knees.
Dean looked at Cas and then back up at his sister. Getting up quickly, Salem squealed and took off running into the house, Dean hot on her heels. Cas looked around as everyone started laughing.
Cas swallowed; not trusting his voice, he nodded; he felt Dean place a hand on his shoulder, getting him to turn around. Dean was such close inches away, looking at him staring at Cas as if he could read his thoughts. The sound of blood rushing, his heart pounding knowing that he was about to have the most amazing kiss of his life. Cas moved forward, watching Dean's tongue poke out a bit to moisten his lips; he was going for it, this time there was no backing out now.
”That's Stellas bear, give it back!” Dean said, holding out his hand for the bear.
"What's wrong?" Stella signed.
Dean swallowed as his mouth went dry. That was not what he was expecting, but in truth, he found it hot. The bot taking control like that, maybe that's what was missing from Dean's life, someone to take over when he had had enough.
”Sh, sh, I got you, I'm not going to hurt you. A nice warm bath will make you feel better, and when that rash is gone, we can add bubbles, ” Jimmy said with a smile.
*********
Alfie didn't agree as he left, reminding Cas that he would hurry back to help him if he needed anything. Cas nodded in agreement while shutting the door in the boys' face. Castiel lowered himself onto the couch, closing his eyes clearing his mind trying to remember what happened a few days earlier.
Castiel opened a sizeable white door; the room was huge, the carpet a soft blue, the walls were painted with different animals on the ceiling clouds and sun.
Benny nodded and said he would be happy too, that Dean did need to worry about him. Dean nodded, and still watching went to get Becky.
Wren didn't say anything as she headed to the dresser to grab her scrubs to get ready for work. She already knew what Cas was upset about, and Dean didn't want her two cents.
“Dean,” Sam and Harper said in unison.
Cas came up to help Dean down the stairs; Jimmy helped Stella, who yawned and snuggled close to her Alpha. Stella placed her nose close to Jimmy's scent gland breathing in deep it was making her feel better. Jimmy smiled when he felt her breath hot on his neck.
“What the hell, dude?” Dean asked, looking at the bot in question.
Dean sighed and got up. He took his plate and cup to the sink to set them down in. He leaned on the counter for a second before turning back to Castiel to answer the question, “Do you wanna have sex with me?” he asked, looking the bot in the eye.
“I don't know, and I keep telling him I don't care if he was only a human,” Dean replied as he pulled his t-shirt off and replaced it with his scrubs top.
“That's ok; we will teach you,” Dean chuckled, taking the deck of cards from in front of Cas and shuffling them.
Jimmy grabbed a towel wrapping it around Stella, she smiled and ran her hand over it, pulling it off.
“You're possessing him?” Harper asked the question was almost a statement. The disbelief in her voice was clear.
”Mmm,” Stella whined; she didn't like being a far away from Dean.
*********************************
Dean sighed and nodded, he wanted to be close to his sister, but he knew things were going to change.
Cas nodded most siblings had and underline scent he and Jimmy smell like honey while Gabriel had honey with hints of chocolate.
“Alright, my boy, all I need to know is if you know what type of fairy you are and if you plan to stay?” Henry said, walking around the large table with a few scrolls, an inkwell, and a quill. He unrolled the scroll before dipping his quill into the ink.

“You should have told me,” Cas whispered as he pinned the Omegas hands above his head with one hand, “we could have done this sooner.”
”Hold still, baby, ” Jimmy said as Stella squirmed as he put the cream on her.
”Oh my, aren't they adorable, ” a little white-haired lady said, smiling at the twins.
”This bath is just for you, Cas will bathe Dean later, come on, time to get out, ” Jimmy said letting the water out.
“Yeah, you are right about that; I'll see you when you get home.”
“Found your journal,” Dean yelled, "Is that why you were up there? Were you going to jump?" He asked as Harper turned, “Were you?”
“Do you require snacks?” Castiel asked after a few moments.
“I'm a demon of the lord,” Castiel said, looking through a book on the table. He turned and looked at Dean, then down at Harper.
“I didn't want to scare you off,” Dean answered honestly as he moved his hands to unbutton Cas’s shirt slowly.
“I don't know who you get your music taste from but it sure as hell wasn't us,” Harper replied, sitting back in the seat, getting comfortable for the ride.
Dean nodded and took a sip of his own beer. “Look, if you wanna know about me, that's cool, but I can't have Clover go to an asylum, or whatever, it would kill her,” he explained, looking over at Cas.
Ivy looked at Cas and started to write but Cas stopped her before she finished, “You only have to share if you want to,” he said she smiled
“Are you sure?” Cas asked he didn't want to take advantage.
There are a lot of bullet points, so it is easier to follow along with what Meg and Charlie are teaching.
Harper huffed, turning on her heel and storming off Dean following but still keeping a bit of distance.
“Shall we go to the bedroom now?” Castiel asked out of nowhere, looking at Dean with those eyes that made his heart stutter.
“Now, Doc I was telling Miss. Ivy here that this is not food” Benny said picking at the mash potatoes and meatloaf on his plate and making face.
this chapter has a few POV changes between Dean and Cas but I promise it will go back to one POV in the next chapter.
“Eat, and them the king wants to see you,” the fairy said, giving Cas a pointed look, “And you, no more pouting in my kitchen, go find Blue. She's probably terrorizing the chickens or teasing the hours.”
"Sorry," Dean said, signing to his sister.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I'll take the soul if you want,” Wren offered while wiping her eyes as she moved further into the room, stopping at the bed's foot.
Dean nodded, saying since a lot of the fairies who worked in the castle had some garden fairy in them, they just grow; they never stop even when it snowed. Cas nodded in awe of the beautiful smiling as the bees and other insects buzzed around. It was everything he had ever dreamed in his garden if his parents let him plant all the flowers he wanted. Cas was so excited he started naming off all the flowers he saw running around trying to see everything. Dean laughed, telling him he could see everything they had time.
She nodded and yawned, holding her arms up. Jimmy unbuckled her, lifting her out, pulling her into his lap. She cuddled close, putting her thumb in her mouth, nodding off to sleep comfy in her Alphas arms.
Cas turned and looked at Dean, his cheek rosy from the whiskey, “Are you a little drunk?” he asked.
The men looked at each other and shook their heads, ”never, I wanted her, and I am going to keep her, ” he said.
Dean was thinking about the blue eyed man while lying on the couch what was it about him that made Ivy so comfortable? Dean couldn’t stop thinking about how hot he was, that messy hair, scruffy chin and perfect ass Dean knew was hiding under that lab coat he liked to wear. Dean thought about how much he would love to bury his cock in that mans mouth and have him fuck Dean into the mattress, he was palming the bulge in his pants might as well hop in the shower since he had sometime before heading back to the facility.
Stella looked at him; she wasn't sure what that meant, but she didn't like the towel. She thought about what he was saying and nodded.
“How much longer do you think until I can take my car home?” Crowley asked, sliding a finger across the counter and checking it before leaning on it, opting not to when he noticed how dirty it was.
yes, she swears more often than most people know their care person swore a lot and Dean taught Stella.
Clover turned her attention away from her brother to glare at Cas, eyes looking down a moment later. “I'm sorry I tried to kill you,” she mumbled out as she turned to walk away, halted by Dean grabbing her by the arm and pulling her back.
They were good babies, hardly ever cried. The staff learned quickly not to touch them with their bare hands, at least the skeletal part that seemed to show up when they threw tantrums as toddlers. As the twins grew, the staff became more and more concerned that they weren’t adoptable. No one had even seen children with their “gifts” before. It didn't stop Dean and Wren from teaching themselves, as they got older, that with a simple touch, they could end the suffering of a bird that had crashed into a window. This gift made the other children frightened of them, steering clear whenever they were near. They did not want to die if they were accidentally touched, no matter how many times the staff explained that it doesn't work like that, they needed to be close to Death for the twins to use their gifts.
"Really? You wanna share her with me?" Dean asked.
"How did you find me last night?" Jimmy asked.
“What happened? Is she ok? Do I need to come back? I can come back,” Dean questioned,, tuning back towards the door.
“Yes?” Cas replied as he turned to see who was talking to him
Rowena smiled and said she would do her best, but it would be Wren’s job to nurse the bird, like all the other feathered friends before that. The redhead teased her about taking life but always wanting to nurture things back to health.
“I don't know that's weird, I could tell you what I do know after lunch. I normally stay until dinner but I gotta get Benny. Still, suppose it's ok and not against policy or anything we could hang out and talk about Ivy,” Dean offerend. In that case, part was wanting to make sure Ivy got the proper help she needed. The other are was a reason to hang out with Cas.
“Look, I know you aren't happy about what's going on, neither am I. Willow is only happy because she gets to stay with me, but I'm not a pitten,” Dean said, standing his ground.
“No, Daddy hit us,” Ivy said, looking away, feeling ashamed of what happened after that, “You know about other stuff,” she added in a whisper.
She made a face and pointed to the door; Jimmy tilted his head, trying to figure out what she wanted. Stella made the D noise again and looked.
Cas and Jimmy came walking down the hall. It was funny how different they were; Cas always had messy hair even though he did brush it, Jimmy's was always combed. Cas walked with confidence; Jimmy walked like he was on edge. It was little things that made it easy to tell them apart; Ivy smiles when she saw Jimmy; Dean knew that smile she like him like he liked Cas.
“What's her name? How did you meet?” Clover asked excitedly, swiping through the pictures after Dean handed her the phone.
“Come on. We can work him over after what he did,” Dean said like it was just an everyday thing.
The doctor said she had an infection; he would prescribe antibiotics and cream for her rash and for Jimmy to change her often. He also told them that he would be reporting where they got them from this was severe abuse and neglect, and if she were there any longer, she would have died. The doctor left after writing the prescription.
Dean Dean,
“Hello, Dean,” Cas replied a bit startled when Dean said his name. He was deep in writing notes in a patient file.
Stella sat down on the floor and waited until her brother finished, only to get in trouble for playing with the soap and having to be rinsed off again.
https://www.ultimatecampresource.com/campfire-stories/scary-campfire-stories/creak/
“That's ok, Benny wants to come by tonight,” Dean said a smile spreading across his face.
”Ok, sweetheart, let's get washed up, then we will go eat, ” Jimmy said, grabbing the scent-free soap.
Sam looked at his siblings. Harper was on edge, waiting for Dean's signal to run or fight; they watched as all the other people in the diner their eyes turned blue, and one guy locked the diner door.
Stella sighed as she waited with Jimmy and Belle in the waiting room of the audiologist. Jimmy was filling out the paperwork. At the same time, Stella taught Belle to sit. It was the one they were working on the most; Jimmy told Stella the trainer was coming to work with them every day when they got home from work so the puppy could learn how Stella signed.
