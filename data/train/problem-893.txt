Once the repairs to Baker Street have got past their initial phase, during which the air is full of particulate matter, John makes the experiment of bringing Rosie along; he and Sherlock work around her in the sitting room, while she stacks blocks and sweeps them down again, laughing. “Watson,” Sherlock tells her, “your studies of structural engineering have clearly been deficient to this point.” He had tended Rosie before, at Mary’s urging — her urging of John, that is, for Sherlock, though he had been tentative at first, had never seemed reluctant. The windows are wide open to spring and to the sounds of quotidian London; that morning, Mrs. Hudson moved back in from the serviced flat where Mycroft had been putting her up. Sherlock and John are drinking coffee from Speedy’s (new furnishings and kitchen equipment also paid for by the British Government, Personified) into which they’re trying not to spill any wallpaper paste. Sherlock turns away from Rosie’s construction project, then turns back again, frowning, to cup the back of her head; his fingers reach ear to ear. Not so much as two seconds has elapsed before he returns to the wallpapering. He doesn’t say anything about the moment, and John doesn’t either.
“Ah, John! In Piccadilly he would be a needle in a haystack; better for him to continue here, for I mean to have Wiggins look for him tomorrow. If Wiggins thinks him quick enough, and forms a good opinion of his character, we might make a place for him among the Irregulars.”
Then, while the parents showered and changed, Harry had given him a large, flat parcel. Shaped like a portfolio folder.
At Baker street, Rosie enjoys her after-school milk and a scone with Mrs Hudson, and shows off Ursa Minor, while her dads go upstairs.
John could continue to pursue his interests in medicine, which was technically of no use or interest to his family, with their money and position. Doctoring was very much a lower class kind of thing, getting near the hoi polloi and their bodily fluids, and his family didn’t understand at all why he was dedicated to becoming a doctor. Perhaps, with the terms of the marriage contract being what they were, his new husband wouldn’t raise a fuss when John was finally able to start practising. Certainly he’d never stand in the way of Sherlock being a consultant, whatever that meant.
. We loved you, Mycroft, as hard as we could. When you were born, Sherlock, we found joy in our little baby boy.
“Phas!” half-shouted the brunette with a dazzling smile. The redhead only nodded at her, but his eyes widened as he noted Ben.
John lived with Sherlock, worked with him, loved him, and aged as mortal men do – and did not believe in soulmates.
John mouthed rude words in Sherlock’s general direction, but concentrated on hauling him back into the daylight. Finally, Sherlock’s hands scrabbled at the edge of the well, then got a better grip. John seized him by the wrists, pulled him further out. As soon as Sherlock was standing on firm ground again, John groaned and limped over to Rosie, clutching his aching back.
After Giles and Leandra went in to promise their imminent return, Sherlock and John visited Mycroft. Mycroft affected grumpiness. Sherlock didn’t care. He took Mycroft’s hand and pulled it out straight so he could inspect the scratches John had told him about.
Mycroft swallowed. He met her gaze. “No. It’s fine. I’m simply… not used to having company at the circus.”
For it is only after he's off to work that Sherlock dresses Rosie in goggles and enormous latex gloves. Sometimes he stuffs fluorescent foam plugs into Watson's ears. It's then he does horrific things to Rosie's Farley's, terrible things to her rusks, and the less said about what happens to the Cow & Gate the better.
So the point is, is that John has slept no more than forty-eight minutes in one go for four days because his angel baby has knives of gas in her tiny tummy and right before this all started John insisted Sherlock take that case in…in…fuck, John's forgot what city Sherlock's in right now but anyway, just before all this happened John said, "Go, love, go," and so love
Mrs Hudson sent up flowers from the back garden. Later, the three of them sat in the back garden, drinking tea.
John put the coffee pot on its shelf and looked for something else to clean, mostly so he wouldn’t have to turn around and face the man’s outrage at being spied upon.
Greg felt a bit teary himself. For all he was a close friend, and knew about John’s art and his studio, this week was the first time he’d actually seen the
“The client is a dating agency. One of the users is dating men, getting to know them, drugging them on the third date, stealing their British Library Reading Room cards and then leaving them, otherwise unharmed, on the Piccadilly line and then vanishing. Four men have been victims so far.”
The level of smugness in the honeymoon suite rose about 200 percent and John pressed sleepy, lazy kisses all over Sherlock’s face, his sticky hand on Sherlock’s peachy arse. Sherlock lay in his arms, relaxed as a wet noodle, smugness vying with a beatific smile.
and thrust into the circle of his palm, “That’s it, fuck yes, come for me, come on me, that’s it, right on me, I’m yours, you’re mine, fuck, yeah…” as Sherlock cried out John’s name and came all over both their bellies and John’s hand.
John's response to Rosie being sick is partly based on that of a friend of mine, a doctor who had trouble switching off from all the things she knew could go wrong when her baby boy got sick. (He did not get pneumonia. He's a robust boy of 10 now.)
Rosie stirred on her little mat. She started to cry. Harry left tea to steep and swooped in to pick up her niece.
Together, Sherlock and John discovered that mortality offered pleasures and joys as well as pain and loss. They were friends, and then they were lovers. But destined? Soulmates? Never.
‘There. You have very pretty eyes, my friend.’ Porthos removed Aramis’s hat too, hanging it on the bedhead. ‘Are you ready, my sweet?’
“Yeah. I think. Sort of. Mycroft told him about something weird happening at the hospital. But seriously, John. I think he’s only half pretending to be having a breakdown. I know you think you can’t cope with how he’s not coping either, but maybe you can look after each other. Or maybe you can just go and not cope together.  Hang on to each other and scream at the universe. Like we did on Hampstead Heath that night. Two kids not coping, but
“Blayne’s a wonderful artist,” leaps in Kara, refusing to give another child a win, “His figures are very sophisticated, his teacher says.”
OD glares at him and curses him with ugly names as he mops at his lap. Mycroft glares at him too, but Greg sees the moment of recognition, but Mycroft’s eyes only widen a fraction.
“I thought I’d lost you,” gasped John, kissing Sherlock’s face and stroking his arms and hands to prove that he was still here.
“Not Nathan or Howard,” said Mycroft, throwing the paper down in disgust. “Another one. John Garrideb.”
"Things are what they are. But we’ll endure. Live through it. Survive and thrive. We just have to love each other as hard as we can.”
“On a rooftop, just over there.” He nodded across to the city somewhere. “It was very romantic.” He sounded both defiant and defensive.
Good thing this was all for a case, John thought, moving in again, only this time cupping Sherlock’s’ cheek with one hand. “You can go for the face holding, or not,” he said. “I like it.”
“Mrs H. made a brilliant pav for the occasion,” Greg added. He didn’t know precisely why both men flushed and laughed and pashed again, but he had good instincts. They looked just like Mycroft did whenever red ribbons were mentioned. Or worn.
John Garrideb had started to cry. “I’m not James Winter. That’s not me anymore. My name is John Garrideb.”
When the water cooled, Sherlock lifted her up while John wrapped her in the soft towel again. Sherlock took Mary’s picture with them back into the nursery so John could finish drying Rosie and dress her again.
“Since I got trapped in a remote house by an AI and nearly starved to death before I got found and they blew up the door to get me out. So. So I. I don’t like the indoors that much. Or. Um. Women who get a bit. Keen. Before I’m. Um.” Caleb cleared his throat. “It was only meant to be a favour. Pretend. She didn’t want to come alone. But she’s. Hmm. Keen.”
“I thought I’d seen the world, but you open up new ways of seeing. New worlds. Every day, you make the world fresh again. You make me excited to share it with you, to learn about it, about you, and about myself. I’m so glad I finally found the courage to talk to you that day at the café. I’m so glad you’re here with me today. I’m so happy we’ll discover the world and each other again and again every day for the rest of our lives. I love you anew every single morning, and will for all our lives.”
It was never ‘just a minute’ getting Rosie ready for an outing, but Sherlock put together the travel bag and made sure it had a baby blanket, change of clothes and nappies for emergencies, formula, toys, baby wipes and whatnot while John dressed Rosie in a red and white polka dot bloomers and a red spotty shirt with a toucan on the front. He put a soft cotton hat on her head and told her she was a little wonder.
“Oh, sugar! I’m sorry!” he says in the lightest version of his usual voice, not exaggerated and falsetto but his feminine side revealed. “I’m such a clumsy girl.”
“Very much the theme song of the happy couple,” said Mycroft, holding his glass out. Greg refilled it and then sipped straight from the bottle while Mycroft downed that glass too.
Sitting so closely, of course John could tell when Sherlock’s body language changed. Not tense, precisely, but not quite as relaxed as before. He tilted his head back to look at the bemused frown on Sherlock’s face.
“You left a trail of wheel tracks on the drive, you know,” she said good-naturedly in the face of his scowl, “Even I couldn’t miss it.”
“You’ve managed to put your households together superbly otherwise,” she praised them. “John has his study upstairs and you have your workspace downstairs. Your families will be delighted to see that you’ve established a single bedroom to share, and I’m sure once we’ve sorted this little problem of your book collections out, you won’t want to change that.”
From Montague Street, clients — marks — would enter a waiting room with four upholstered chairs in green-and-gray hound’s-tooth. The front window, discreetly curtained, announced “W. S. S. Holmes, Practical and Spiritual Counseling,” in crisp black Garamond. On the walls, framed quotations, or, properly speaking, pseudo-quotations, to wit:
“Did you know her?” John asks. How much pain is it possible to experience, simply as a result of hearing thoughtful words quietly spoken? He’s long past the
On the way, he thought over his options. It was a short walk, but that was all right, as there weren’t many options to think over. Jim, or his flash-suited muscle, had broken Wiggins’s fingers, but Niall hadn’t been given even that much warning; Jim had escalated fast. Unexpectedly fast. Quite likely, Sherlock could find someone else to supply him without very much trouble — could find someone, and then another someone, and then, perhaps, a third someone, before word got out to every last dealer in London that selling to Shezza would get you killed. Soon enough, the police would be looking for a serial killer, and Jim would have laid a trail of breadcrumbs, of blood and hair and shoeprints, to one Will Holmes.
— Sherlock is visibly gritting his teeth now — “while the magic here isn’t much to speak of, the quality of that sculpture is. It’s the sculptor you want. Look.” He holds his phone up to Lestrade and John; the display shows a daguerreotype of a human face, but — no, it isn’t a human face, it’s the face of an animate, and John feels himself shrink away from it. Lestrade, too, flinches minutely.
Then the shakes again, the toilet again. After his bowels had emptied themselves, not that there was much to get rid of at this point, he got hold of the duvet on the floor—he had the forethought to brace one hand against the doorframe, so though bending down made him dizzy, he kept his feet—and dragged it to the bed. His sweat had soaked the sheets days ago and more than once. They stank. His pillow stank. He buried his face in it and pulled the duvet over him. He wanted some heroin. There was no point in wanting his father or mother or brother, so he didn’t. He slept.
He drifted toward Rockham, casting smiles about him; no one here knew him, of course, but that didn’t matter if you were good-looking and rich enough. Sherlock was the one and his suit declared, a little loudly, that he was en route to becoming the other, so a high percentage of those present had already given him the eye, and not all of them were subtle about it, either. Rockham, observant like all predators — and like all prey — saw Will Holmes’s clothes, his walk, the gracious acknowledgment of the crowd’s interest, all the beacons signaling
As the moon outside his window shrank toward darkness, John thought of the road he had visited in his own fever dreams.
“Sherlock, why are we standing behind an array of potted palms and watching an aviary?” Sherlock doesn’t often do things that make John sad but today is an exception. The lovebirds calling out, flying, playing with their toys, and grooming one another all remind him of Beakley, of course. Maybe Sherlock thought the sight of so many happy birds would somehow outweigh John’s memory of one who was sad. However, this still doesn’t explain why Sherlock has concealed himself and John behind the potted palms.
“Off,” Sherlock says in a few minutes, rolling halfway over to emphasize the point. John flails about for the discarded pants and manages to find them and wipe both himself and Sherlock off before he is even as much as half asleep. This would be reason to congratulate himself, which he is vaguely doing as he drifts downward, only of course he is interrupted by Sherlock, sounding perfectly awake and alert, and saying,
he had thought though not in words, because those by then had deserted him. Then the boot landed and he, Sherlock, had not cried out but he had made a noise, not much of a noise, a noise probably inaudible to the shouting, laughing West Ham fans.
said John Watson in his dream, and he leaped into the hounds’ path. He could smell their close breath as he dove for the roadside with the wounded raven cradled to his breast;
Sherlock wanted to say he didn’t know, but suddenly he felt certain that Jim would see through that lie even if he had missed all the others. “You note it with smugness, you mean,” John had said, something curling warm in his tone. Abruptly it became clear where Jim was headed. “Yes,” Sherlock admitted. Another cramp, this one well blended with dread.
“No,” Sherlock agreed, “it’s not, but why don’t you look into her finances? Check my work that far and you might develop some confidence in the rest.”
Although I cannot regret my marriage — Mary was a glorious girl, spirited and clever, whom any man would be fortunate to call his wife — it is true that my heart was already not my own when she and I met. I strove to be a good husband in every way, but perhaps her short life would have been happier had she passed it with one who could love her not only truly but wholeheartedly. For Holmes and I had loved each other, had longed for each other, almost from our first meeting, though it was only after his return from the terrible years spent eradicating Professor Moriarty’s organization from this earth that our feelings prevailed over the constraints usual among men of our sort.
first thing, even before he came after her, and he got trolleyed and then passed out under some shrubberies on Hampstead Heath, but it was a cold night and he died of hypothermia, which would have been fine only ever since he had been trying to come home, you see, and so he had been haunting her.
There was a passage he had never noticed before, narrow, making a dogleg just where the shadows of buildings grew deep.
He set the feather knife in its sheath and buckled it on; then he went to assist the physician, as usual. Only when his employer said, “Where’s your cane?” did John realize that it, along with his limp, was gone.
Set up a proper lab. Conduct experiments without relying on Wiggins’s unreliable — and now entirely unavailable — good graces.
“However” — Mycroft nodded to Macdermid — “it appears that any planning is being conducted offline. Our electronic eavesdropping has picked up only the barest hints, nothing concrete. Without agents in place, we are deaf and blind. We do not even know where we ought to direct our chief efforts to cultivate informants.”
John had not thought words would come easily, but he had thought they would come. Instead he finds himself just looking — at the flat, to begin with, because seeing it again brings him smack into the realization of how hard he’s been working, all this time, not to remember it — not to yearn for the comfortable press of the chair that had been his, for the exact angle of afternoon light from the street-side windows, for something as small and daily as the way the handle on the refrigerator door dug into his palm because the gasket magnet was strong and it took some effort to open the door.
The spell he was working on, John could see, was in the last stages of development but had not quite cohered, so that its components were still individually discernible: Elucidare, in the form appropriate for nonverbal information, and Amplificare, in the emphatic form used for faint signals, again nonverbal. These were overlaid on the character that meant “past,” while over them in turn a double helix hovered, shimmering.
The period of my connection with certain Holywell Street booksellers was not entirely a happy one, but it had in its way been adventurous, and I was sorry to think of the area, with all the memories it held for me, vanished from London’s map. And of course those memories were also memories of my youth, impecunious and sometimes desperate though it had been. I sighed, perhaps, or tutted — Holmes looked up from his own perusal of the
It was a gamble, but people must constantly have been trying to climb Rockham’s ladder, and Sherlock’s bet was that every last one pretended they were only interested in the view.
On Tuesday evening, Sherlock managed to stand up long enough to take a shower, though afterward the shakes and cold sweats came back. At least he was lying in the bed now instead of on the floor outside the loo. Everything hurt. Eating remained out of the question.
“It’s not either of the nightmares that you used to have.” Sherlock pitches this somewhere between statement and question; there were the Afghanistan nightmares, and the nightmares about Sherlock falling and falling forever, which Sherlock somehow knows about even though he was in Tibet or Libya or someplace during the period when John was having them.
Wiggins held up his right hand and turned it side to side, showing the splints from all angles. “You see that, yeah? That was a warning, and I did not like the receiving of it. I sell to you, they come back and take these off altogether. Not meaning the splints. So, what I said: Fuck off out of here.”
’ Once they’ve been telling themselves that for a while, it’s practically their reason for being. And then what you’re selling isn’t any particular thing you do, anymore. Nope!” Popping the terminal consonant, just the way Sherlock sometimes did. “Now you’re selling time in your
“Oh! No, sir, you mistake me.” She clasped her hands together in her lap, evidently trying to find some better form of words. The minute easing of tension on Holmes’s face informed me that he and I had arrived at similar hypotheses concerning what she meant to say, and in the next moment we were proved right:
What was this, why were his palms wet. He had got used to Jim — all right, not used to Jim, exactly, but used to this life, used to its shape, its limits, its conveniences and the small liberties he had been permitted since the blackout. It was hard to remember, now that several weeks had passed, what the point of attempting to quit heroin had been. A delusional exercise.
There was no reason to conclude, in the absence of further data, that there had been a murder; especially there was no reason to conclude that, had there been a murder, the victim was anyone known to Sherlock. He kept going up Chalk Farm Road to the next entry. It was open; Sherlock went in and then circled along the horse stalls and toward Camden Lock Place till he hit the backside of the crime scene. From here he could see the screen that had been put up in front of the Tibetan handicrafts stall. There was a gray-haired man in mufti, looking tired and in charge, talking with a couple of women in Tyvek suits; after some time, a body bag on a wheeled stretcher emerged.
Sherlock slid into the fraction of airspace between Rockham’s right side and the nearest courtier. “Will Holmes,” he said. “We share an interest in Ms. Rosenzweig’s work, I gather.”
Regular users of heroin may become more sensitive to pain. In the past couple of years, Sherlock had had more than one chance to experience the phenomenon, so he wasn’t surprised when Dr. John Watson’s lidocaine didn’t quite stop him feeling the antiseptic, the cleaning-out of the laceration, or the stitches going in. He distracted himself by studying Watson more closely. The doctor’s limp was, or perhaps had been if this morning’s preoccupations succeeded in curing it, psychosomatic. But from the vantage of the examination table it was easy to see that — Oh, yes. “You’re naturally left-handed,” Sherlock said.
, fellatio, and sodomy. Commonplace! and, to most of my fellow Englishmen, beyond the pale. As for my own inclinations . . .
Always, Sherlock had been oblivious of John — of anyone — when busy with an experiment or drawn deep into a case, but now, if John manages to catch his attention at all, Sherlock will look up and watch him blankly for a while, then, just as blankly, turn away again, as if no one were there. Really, as if neither of them were there, it seems to John.
Her talents and skills proved indispensable on many occasions — most notably in the case I have related under the rubric of “The Shrunken Wedding Gown,” where she gathered valuable intelligence while en travesti as Jocko the telegraph boy. And as I have recorded in “The Affair of the Drunken Valet,” it was she who found the vials that enabled us to prove the complicity of the barrister’s envious brother.
Holmes had, I feared, begun to suspect that something was amiss, though as yet he had not voiced any anxieties, and I did not know what I dreaded more: that he would come to the right conclusion; or that he would come to any of several plausible wrong conclusions. That I wearied of him. That I wished to indulge myself with others. That I had come to feel distaste for our shared pleasures — for I didn’t! But one may find a dish delicious and yet feel that it would be enhanced by a sprinkling from the salt cellar.
The flat was monitored by CCTV and audio. Jim had explained to Sherlock the consequences of any attempt to disable the surveillance or to bolt; had emphasized them with a video clip of a previous defector from his realm. “You’d best never lose that phone,” Sherlock had said, dry-throated, after the last tiny scream cut off.
“Five. Russia perceives NATO not as a defensive organization but as a positive threat: indeed, it is largely on account of NATO’s expansion eastward that Putin and his Foreign Ministry wish so urgently to reinstate Russia’s buffer zone.
Hareton looked gratified — of course, Mycroft reflected, the Home Secretary was out of his line of sight, so he couldn’t see her close her eyes and blow a silent breath out of her pursed lips. “This nation,” Hareton continued, “has granted you an enormous amount of covert authority — this, on the basis of your” — here he assumed an ironic mien — “unique intellect, wide-ranging knowledge, and unparalleled ability to extract accurate information from limited and ambiguous evidence.”
John Watson sat in the chair Sherlock had vacated and urged Sherlock around to stand in front of him. He began pinning up the rip, working with the same effortful care with which he had stitched Sherlock’s thigh.
When the morning alarm went off, he got up, he ate, he drank coffee, he took delivery of that day’s supply. He went downstairs and opened the shop. He waited for more clients, who didn’t appear. He also used the unoccupied time to click, lip curled, through a great many websites detailing procedures for exorcism, to consider some likely trajectories for Delia Smithson’s next few appointments, and to think painfully of all the heroin he could buy with Delia Smithson’s money, if only he were free to buy his own heroin again.
When the soldier had gone out, Sherlock closed up the shop and went upstairs to the flat. He ate the required supper, his last dose and his works laid out before him, trying to convince himself that it didn’t matter whether he fixed now or five minutes from now, as either way the next week at least would be horrible. Then he did fix, greedy for it the way one can be greedy to press against, to hold, the body of a departing lover.
John got up and opened his rucksack to find the envelope he had brought with him from the hospital tent. The whisker and the scale remained.
loudly but now, looking around at the crowd, he reevaluated. Academic types, yes, lots; arty types, ditto; and also plenty of money here to declare its ownership of the expensive investments hanging on the walls. Jim chose social markers well; Sherlock wasn’t as good as Andrew Rockham and Jim Moriarty were at appearing congenial, but the slick hair and the suit would, he thought, make up for any shortfall. He looked like money that was ready to make more money. He looked like money that relished the association with art. Art appreciated, and Will Holmes appreciated it right back.
On Friday morning his phone woke him: an unfamiliar number. Sherlock frowned at it through two rings, three, four. If Jim felt like taunting him, he would show up in person, or Skype at least: what was the fun in making someone squirm if you couldn’t watch them do it?
voice, offering indecencies that I don’t care to set down even here, though I have set down so much else. I believe both Holmes and I blushed scarlet; but on Miss Winter’s face I could see, until her impersonation was done, only salaciousness — salaciousness, and the despair of one who knows not when he will next be warm, and dry, and fed.
He was going to have to quit using, eventually. Every junkie knows he has to quit eventually; it’s only that as fast as the date approaches, so quickly it recedes again.
“Well. I won’t pretend I’m not disappointed, but so it goes. Here’s a little something for your time.”
Not that it takes long to get the cards replaced, but John climbs the stairs to their room in the resigned awareness that, one way or another, he’s heading straight for an ambush. Is it properly an ambush, he wonders, if you know when and where it’s coming and the only thing you don’t know is what form it will take?
We were, then, contentedly browsing over our papers and journals, anticipating a day of doing nothing much — Holmes had proposed a visit to the Natural History Museum — when Mrs. Hudson appeared to announce the arrival of a lady. Well! I have said we did not
There is no limit to the human capacity for self-delusion! I shake my head at myself: at that time I had already known Sherlock Holmes for eighteen years, during nearly thirteen of which I had lived with him. The preceding year’s even closer intimacy had no bearing on my knowledge of his intellectual skills, strictly speaking; but surely it should have been predictable to me that no interruption in his line of questioning would prevent him from picking up its thread again as soon as opportunity arose. And yet I persuaded myself that the two days spent in working out Lestrade’s case would put paid to the matter of my connection with the Holywell Street trade.
“Since you cannot tell us,” Hareton said, “exactly how the Russians mean to carry out this alleged existential threat against us, then can you tell us what, precisely, we keep you in your exalted position
It was rather like living in any other serviced flat, apart from the surveillance, and of course apart from Jim.
A hesitation. “Not exactly, no. How can I put this? It seemed necessary, so I did it, and I would do it again; but if I could both have done it, and be someone who had not done it. . . . Useless imaginings. There are any number of things I would rather not have done. But I did them, and here I am.”
Sherlock takes the food out of Beakley’s bowl and scatters it around his cage and then covers most of it with some pieces of plain paper he unearths from among the Legos and stuffed toys and whatnot. Beakley watches dully.

As far as Delia Smithson was concerned, Sherlock had already demonstrated his supernatural perceptiveness, but even if she’d only been halfway sure of him, he would have found it easy to guide her toward perfect faith.
A good opinion of a margery-boy’s character! Perhaps my readers will scoff at the notion. But that was Holmes — he understood all too well what expedients men, and boys and women too, may seek when overwhelmed by troubles, and how little we ought to judge them. Too, I had been watching Sherlock Holmes for many years by then, and while my powers of observation would never equal his, I had advanced enough to admire the dexterity with which he had slipped half-a-crown into the pocket of Roger’s jacket. Roger would feel the coin’s weight, later, and perhaps wonder at his good luck.
” — Sherlock rolled his eyes, which made him retch again, three cheers for heroin and the withdrawal from same — “and fancied himself not quite domesticated. I told him I didn’t want a record made, and he never generated one.” A cramp struck, but Sherlock tried not to show it, in case Jim thought he was overdramatizing to hide a lie. There was so much sweat at the base of his spine now that it was soaking through the duvet.
Delia Smithson made an appointment for the following evening at eight, when Sherlock promised to have some preliminary results for her. The front door had barely shut behind her when a whole-body tremor took hold. When it was done with him, he was covered in sweat. The time was 11:15. Late, late, late. He took the stairs to his flat two at a time, stumbling. It occurred to him as he dropped into a chair and tied off his left arm that in making his mental picture of the flat he had omitted all his gear.
It was Miss Winter, of course, who forced Holmes to revise his opinion of her sex. He inclined at first to think of her as a sport more or less in the Irene Adler mold, but she would have none of it, pointing out over and over what women were enabled to achieve whenever some small constraint was lifted from them. I believe that, equally with the force of her argument, it was her courage in maintaining her position although her opponent had the power to deprive her of her living that swayed him.
Even if you withheld that word, who could withhold the pity that inheres in “victim”? Her clothes have been nearly torn off. Dried blood has drenched much of a twenty-foot stretch of the walkway; no doubt there are defensive wounds on the palms and the forearms. . . . No, the
said the voice in his head which had been using that word for some time now, though Sherlock preferred to ignore it — wouldn’t rate two officers in civilian dress, this was a private location for holding prisoners, and the men at the door were guards.
“Well, we talked for a bit — you made all those deductions about me, and yes, I  did take note on the spot of how clever you are — and then we walked here — Oh. Right. I helped you get up.”
One day, John catches Sherlock’s expression as he, Sherlock, tucks Rosie into her yellow raincoat: it’s the careful concentrated look he might wear as he dropped reagent from a pipette, and the sight makes John laugh while, also, it squeezes his heart. Sherlock’s forty, and his unearthly beauty has worn away at the edges, but, as if in recompense, he seems at home in the world now, as John can never remember being.
John has to concede that it isn’t, because Sherlock is tracing a forefinger around the edge of his foreskin where the head of his cock is just coming up, and John has quite strong sense memories of that cock filling inside his mouth, of Sherlock holding John’s head still and sliding himself back and forth while John opens his mouth wider and closes his eyes, coughing maybe on the first flush of salt at the back of his throat . . . And this. The

of that Sherlock was certain, something in someone’s hearing, maybe something to someone directly, and anyway there followed white blank day after white blank day after white blank day, and no one came to visit him, which would, even to the meanest mind, have been a
Jim nodded toward the guard on his left, who went out and came back a moment later with a bag, which he slid across the floor toward Sherlock.
He had begun to sweat all over his face, and to feel dizzy; the trouble was not the décor, then. He needed the other half of that
angle against angle, corner against center, with triangles of vista between them. Their weights, the lines of force, just so: could you collapse them with a fingertip, or might they balance still, stone in air, a century from now?
Holmes and I both like to think that his letter had something to do with that outcome; but if we are to be honest about it, then we must admit that Miss Kitty Winter’s hand it was that guided his pen.
“Oh, but that’s just the word: invested. Right now” — Jim came closer — “right now, you’re teetering on the edge of something great.” He was a few inches shorter than Sherlock; it was like having a shiny fast animal looking at his throat, to have Jim so near. “I think you’re going to like it. You’re clever. Cleverer than most people. Cleverer than almost everybody. Don’t you agree?”
How much time had passed between the moment when Sherlock was loaded into Jim’s car, and the moment when he came to in the windowless room, with black leather slippers set ready for his bare feet? Blood, hair, a cast of his shoeprints: more than enough to elaborate a persuasive case against a man with no alibi and no friends. “The CCTV,” Sherlock said, unable to stop himself although he knew it was futile; and of course Jim would have to rub it in: he raised his eyebrows, tilted his head, pursed his lips, tsk-tsk-tsk. The woeful state of the Camden Market infrastructure. A terrible thing.
Miss Winter smiled a little. “What a fine lady Miss de Merville was, and proud and educated too. But he got his hooks in her just as he did in so many low-born girls. I wonder, sometimes, whether her life might have been, in just one way, something like a lady’s maid’s.”
But how could he be expected to think about laundry when there was always some business to take care of first?
But John did not shrink back. He made himself stand straight though he shuddered under the riders’ empty gaze. The horses thundered on.
Of course it is useless to prevaricate with the man. “My dear,” he said lightly, “you forget, I think, that I saw this morning’s
Irony having been exercised, the Foreign Secretary now enacted gravitas. Interesting how some people were equally incompetent in every respect.
Maybe Jim had played one of his videos for the webmaster, too, for Sherlock discovered that the counseling service’s site now appeared very early indeed in search results. One Saturday, and then again the following Friday and Saturday, and then on four separate days the week after that, Jim's morning minion arrived bearing not only Sherlock's ration of heroin but also a piece of paper with a client's name, an appointment time, and “Subject of Appointment.” By midsummer, Sherlock was seeing almost no walk-ins at all; a new sign on the front door advised prospective clients to visit the website should they wish to see the counselor. The sign went up on a Monday, and on the Thursday Sherlock learned that he was now booked two weeks ahead. Scarcity creates demand: this was not news.
John thinks Lestrade was wrong, all those years ago, when he thought Sherlock great but not good. Sherlock treated Jim Moriarty’s crimes as puzzles, but he competed with Jim by solving them, not by committing murders even more clever. The difference now is not that Sherlock’s become good but that, having survived Sherrinford and with it the failure of all his attempts to shield himself from feeling, he seems to have concluded that there’s no point in having any shields at all; he is, though sharp-tongued as ever, extravagantly tender. “Watson,” he says one morning when she launches herself at the pen as he makes notes, “Watson, it is time we began nurturing your artistic sensibilities,” and goes out, returning half an hour later with a package of crayons and a sheaf of blank newsprint that he sets before her with a flourish.
“Mm,” Sherlock says, “now you’re biting your lips; I think”—and he wraps a hand around his cock, just holding it, which always drives John crazy, the thought of Sherlock feeling himself harden in his own hand—“it’s time you got your clothes off, isn’t it.”
Sherlock was made of flesh like any man: he bit his lips and breathed hard through his nose as John took stitch on stitch. Afterward John tidied up, fearing to look away in case Sherlock should vanish again, but Sherlock remained. John said, hesitantly, “Fresh bedding”; Sherlock shifted over to show him the ticking and blanket, clean.
I'm participating in the Fandom Trumps Hate auction, for which bidding starts this Thursday, January 12.
Holmes, having read this over, reminds me that I have omitted a surprising pendant to Miss Winter’s tale. A day or two after her visit it occurred to me to wonder aloud how, given that she had only just left Newgate and had no money, she had managed to acquire the plain but well-made clothing in which she had called on us.
Sherlock, who didn't know, till John told him it was so, that the earth orbits the sun; Sherlock, who couldn't name the prime minister of the UK; Sherlock, who had never recognized a single pop song in the soundtrack of any program on the telly. Sherlock, who claimed no subject was of interest to him unless it had directly to do with solving crimes.
She wore a crystal of amethyst on a chain around her neck, so he inquired about the state of her aura. In reply, she told him all about her dead ex-boyfriend. He had used to drink, you see, and then he’d get rough with her; she didn’t like to call the police, at first, but then she did, and they arrested him, which she felt a bit bad about, really, though it was a relief as well, but then he got out of gaol and the first thing he did was to start in drinking again — meaning, the
I interrupted his fumbling about at the valve. “Never mind that, Wiggins. There’s a slip of paper inside bearing the words ‘my third,’ is there not?”
. Perhaps that would be enough to persuade him to remain with me; a man cannot help his nature, perhaps, but he may choose not to act on its urgings — and Holmes deserved to know to what sort of man he had bound his life —
Sherlock is not able to act casual well enough to fool John, who side-eyes him and protests: “You can’t go
He had, as usual, aggrandized the paper to himself, so I had not yet seen it, and naturally I feared that there was some news, even more dreadful than usual, of the War; but his look was one of annoyance rather than of distress. “Have a care not to look at your bees with that expression,” I therefore told him; “they’ll flee their hives, never to return.”  Holmes had unbent a great deal since the happy change in our relations a decade and a half before, and I delighted thus to rally him. His own amusement at my teasing seemed sometimes to surprise him; he would shake his head, smiling downward, almost abashed. The effect enchanted me.
It doesn’t. There’s an aftertaste something like cardamom; the cold water washes it away. John can’t remember another time when he was this frightened, unless it was the moment in Afghanistan, as he lay in the sand having given up, when he came to for a moment hearing medics’ voices: so he had something to lose again, after all.
!” wails the second-youngest of the five children. The youngest is too young to follow the discussion and is only crying because of the second-youngest’s distress. The three older children have tight sad faces and are just waiting for the upshot.
Wiggins’s broken fingers niggled at him, but he had two bags left, and plenty of Jim’s money. Tomorrow was another day.
He situates his bed so that the morning sun will strike his face and thus irritate him enough to get him up and moving, because otherwise he would probably pass days lying on his back with his arms wrapped tight around himself, as if waiting to be embalmed.
.” Something dropped onto Sherlock’s chest — his wallet; he flailed after it, slowly, got his fingers around it.
At A&E John gets an MRI, blood tests, tests of his ability to do simple magic. A child of three should be able to make a foam ball two centimeters in diameter hover in the air for seven seconds; a child of eight should be able to make the ball ricochet for at least two minutes between the walls of a testing chamber five meters by five meters. John can do neither of these things. The portions of the neocortex that should be lighting up on MRI when he performs a spell remain stubbornly dark. There is no detectable TKDT in his blood.
At some point new guards came in and the first two guards went away. The room being windowless, and himself preoccupied, Sherlock could not know what time of day or night it was or how many hours had passed. He had availed himself, with no objection from the guards, of the loo attached to the room where he was being held, and had run cold water over his arms to take the edge off the sense that mites were scurrying in their myriads along his skin. Why did he think of mites, when the name of the feeling was formication, and formication was to do, etymologically, with ants, whereas mites were not even insects, they were — they were . . .
But Miss Winter had not finished her demonstration. For now there appeared the margery-boy who had accosted us just the past evening:
“Now consider, if you please, the present condition of the United States, and that of Hungary, and that of Poland, and tell me again that I overstate the threat to the rest of Europe and to the UK.” Mycroft smiled and leaned back, soft as silk, hands folded over his waistcoat.
For Sherlock's withdrawal, I drew on a number of first-person accounts I found online. I learned about the three kinds of twilight from the Yearly Sun Graph for London, which you can find
Sherlock was exceedingly well informed about the history of animates, although as far as anyone knew until the day Galatea was found, there had been no animate in England in nearly a hundred and fifty years.
“The CPS are trying to work that out. For my money — ” The DI shrugs. “Looks like she suffered enough, didn’t she? For it to count for something.”
Sherlock’s attention on John was, like Sherlock’s attention on spellwork, or an autopsy, or mundane or magical crime, absolute; John, anyway, was already enthralled. Sherlock seemed as inevitable as rain or hunger. They had become lovers that night, and only a week later John had moved in with Sherlock, to the flat in Baker Street. Was this too precipitate? Perhaps it was: for, a year later, John has found himself invaded by unease.
In years to come, John wakes from the dream, as he always wakes from it, at Baker Street, with Sherlock lost in stillness beside him. The baby monitor goes the way of the crib, and the crib goes the way of the white pressboard chest; Rosie sleeps in John’s old bed now, the one he bought on his return to Baker Street and hardly ever used.
Jim stretched out the corners of his mouth, waggled his fingers, and was gone. Forty-five minutes remained before Sherlock was scheduled to close the shop; it was enough time for the sweat to dry from the small of his back, but his hands didn’t stop shaking till he was upstairs and tying off his arm.
, and John brings up as much spit as he can and licks wet all over Sherlock’s balls, the underside of his cock; he pushes Sherlock’s thighs flat apart and bites at the pungent crease where inner leg meets pelvis, making Sherlock yelp and leak.
A wad of notes bound with an elastic round flew into Sherlock’s hands. Twenties, ten of them. “My clothing and shoes.”
If it mattered whether the potion or the water came first, Sherlock would have said so in his note. John opts for potion first, in case it tastes bad.
“Even if I don’t wish to return?” John repeats, incredulous. “Sherlock, why would you have me back?”
John can’t think of what he himself might hope, for Rosie. When Sherlock rescued him from the well, and Rosie was brought to him, it seemed impossible to take any action other than to hold her close to him; he let her go only to Sherlock, and then only because Sherlock pointed out that he would develop hypothermia despite the shock blanket unless he put on the fresh dry clothing that had also been brought. John could see the logic of that. He had a child; he ought to protect himself from hypothermia. He would not have believed how difficult it could be for a grown man to tell himself this, to force his arms away from that small body, to raise his head from where he had pressed it against her shoulder, to dam the stream of “Oh, God,
Even so I might have put him off, only that I had seen pass across his face a shadow of hurt. Holmes may pretend to court a housemaid, in the service of a greater good; he may, again in the service of good, resort to any number of trifling stratagems; but I have never known him to attempt to manipulate my feelings, for any reason. If I saw him look hurt, and saw him swiftly conceal the hurt, that is because he was hurt, and sought to conceal it. Of course I surrendered — though with the greatest trepidation, and not without mounting a rearguard action.
You had to admire Jim, really. He knew how to suspend a person exactly between the terrified urge toward self-preservation, on one side, and the crawling, nagging, self-loathing hunger to escape by whatever means were available, on the other. On Sunday Sherlock’s heroin ration appeared as usual and he reminded himself that if he wasn’t getting junk sick every time he went six hours without a fix that would make one less hold Jim had over him. One less puppet wire.
“Where else can the facts lead us?” Mycroft replied, letting his exasperation show, because Hareton’s confusion about their relative ranks must be dispelled. “Once again: Consider the American election. Consider the evidence surrounding the Brexit vote. Consider the attempts to influence the vote in both Germany and France. Consider, in particular, the attempted coup in Montenegro.”
Sherlock’s heroin dreams were always prosaic: There was someone talking in the hall, for example — only, no, there wasn’t, he would realize a moment later, somehow he had transposed a sound that came from his left, hearing it as though it came from his right, and when he moved the sound he also attached a shadow to it. There was no one in the hall, and the fact that he’d hallucinated someone was only a fact, neither troubling nor amusing though sometimes, if he had nothing better to do, he might ruminate on what neurological processes created these particular illusions and not others.
But Sherlock is the quietest sleeper John has ever known; he doesn’t snore, or speak half-articulated words, or thrash or scream—though, John thinks, surely Serbia at least gave him cause enough for the latter. When he turns, he scarcely disturbs the covers. He is a water spirit. His sleep is as deep as Rosamund’s. A sanctuary. Only, if Rosamund frets, or if John says his name, he rises out of sleep as quick as a seal breaking water.
The Home Secretary, whose grandfather had been born in Lahore and who unlike the majority of her compeers owed none of her professional success to her ancestry, momentarily became even more expressionless than usual. Walter Hareton, who besides being dull-witted had far too many tells for a career diplomat, picked up his pen and tapped his lip with it, thereby conveying that Mycroft had succeeded in cowing him. The others in attendance — the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Organisation, the Minister of Defence, and the Prime Minister’s Principal Private Secretary — simply looked unhappy and waited for the Assistant Undersecretary for Operational Effectiveness to continue speaking.
Sherlock watched the currents of the room for a while, seeing how they flowed around Rockham, noting where Rockham’s attention lingered, to whom and what it returned. The people in the room who weren’t rich investors mainly gave him a wide berth, but Masters of the Universe always thought they were sexy even if they weren’t, and those in their vicinity usually picked up on the vibe even if they didn’t like it. There was a certain amount of appreciativeness aimed Rockham’s way. Not all of it was unwilling, not all of it came from women, and most of those feeling it would probably have denied it.
The soldier nodded again, and stood. “Well,” he said, “thanks for your time.” He took up the little shabby book and replaced it in its envelope. “I probably wouldn’t have believed you if you’d said he was alive, anyway.”
The fox was hot and stinking and the blood from his wounds slick on John’s hands. The hounds, too, wheeled now, panting. Silent. He should have heard their panting, but there was only his own heart and the fox’s harsh breath. John braced — the hounds would tear him apart with the fox now — why didn’t he let go? why didn’t he let go? he held the fox to his bosom, blood soaking into his shirt, and looked steady back at the hounds’ red eyes; they were so close to where he stood at the road’s edge with the fox in his arms, he should have felt their wet breath on his skin but there was nothing — silence; silence, and then the hunters’ horn, and the hounds turned again and were gone down the empty road, the riders after them.
“It totally is! Just remember” — Jim pivoted and stepped in front of Sherlock, stopping him in his tracks — “you can run away from a lot of things, but you can’t run away from yourself
“Mm,” says the consultant, in a tone of rue, and generously doesn’t say what John is thinking; perhaps she’s not even thinking it. “There are some studies going on, looking for ways to make exogenous TKDT cross the blood-brain barrier. We could enroll you . . . ”
Macdermid sighed. “Well, I’ll do what I can to rebuild the lost networks. You know, though: the quicker an agent is introduced, the likelier it is he’ll be rumbled.”
“We can increase our scrutiny of goods shipments,” Mycroft said when he considered they had had sufficient time to meditate upon the drawbacks of totalitarianism. “Subject, of course, to the same resource constraints as universal surveillance would entail. But as we have no inkling of what we’re looking for, or whether, indeed, it will arrive in material form . . .”
I sent in reply, the implement in question being poorly suited to unaccompanied use, and added the new pieces to the puzzle I was assembling. There would be, of course, eight in all, one for each of the eight days of Watson’s absence. So far I had:
He leaves the tired mother’s finger and travels, waveringly, upward, in the air, not exactly free, but freer, in the air, at last, to where he will have a friend, up in the open space.
Sherlock touched John’s mouth. He laid the palm of his hand against John’s cheek. John felt an unbearable sadness enter his small room and crouch there, waiting. Sherlock closed his eyes and said, so softly John could just hear: “I can stay for a while.”
He had written his letter to Lord Curzon before breakfast was done, and so great a hurry was he in that when Meg the housemaid came in to clear our dishes away, he sent her off to the post office instead. It was with the greatest difficulty that I prevailed upon him to let me make a copy of the letter first, and grateful I was that he had written briefly and to the point, for while I wrote he sighed and drummed his fingers on the table and then sighed again, until I was tempted to finish by sending him to stand on a stool in the corner like an errant schoolboy. It would have been no use to point out to him that the mail to London would not go for another two hours yet.
Sherlock had never been able to hold a job, never really tried, but this wasn’t quite a job; it was more in the nature of a consultancy, surely, and one well matched to Sherlock’s talents, at that.
“Perhaps not. Remember, I was there when you were deducing me. Also, if you want me to believe you’re brain-injured, you should dial down the intellectual obnoxiousness.”
“I didn’t say there was nothing we could do!” Dr. Wiesner turns to her laptop and pulls up the web page she wants. “Here. And I’m owed a few favors myself, you see, so I think we can persuade them to take in a bird on short notice.”
Once upon a time, John might have been the generous medical director, buying the staff lunch a couple of times a year. Now he’s the recipient of their generosity, and he’s grateful for it, and also embarrassed and ashamed at how he sometimes forgets himself — forgets that he’s not a doctor anymore, not the man in authority; that, in fact, the aides are good at what they do and more able than he will ever be.
You need never have doubted the outcome of that night: you are, and have always been, the delight of my heart. And, for which much gratitude is due, a far better lover than you were a pornographer.]
I reflected that it would be impossible to deflect his train of thought from its destination; but, despite the anxieties I felt on that score, I could not help but smile at him.
Mycroft once told John that Ella was an idiot, but the events at Sherrinford had made many things clear, among them the fact that the genius of Sherlock’s older brother didn’t extend as fully as he thought it did to the workings of actual human persons. John did miss the war: Mycroft was right about that. But Ella had been right about the trust issues, she had been right about the PTSD, and she had not exactly been wrong about the blog, either, had she, though John’s efforts in that department hadn’t worked as she might have hoped. John could write about Sherlock, he could write about their cases, he could respond lightly or sternly to comments; what the blog couldn’t teach him to do was to look at a feeling and name it.
Now the days were filled with talk. Day after day: My dog/cat/bird/husband/wife/boyfriend/girlfriend/daughter/son/demented grandparent is ill/missing/dead; can you help me find them/cure them/speak with them? What shall I do about my job? Is my husband cheating on me?
He buys a couch at Oxfam and it is the thing he likes best in the flat, because it’s squashy and has a small stain on one arm that brought down the price and that also reminds him of people sitting on a couch eating and perhaps waving their arms about, communicatively, while watching telly. Not any particular people; just, people.
Terror must have made Willis's throat tighten up, and that was what produced the whistling effect. Terror had any number of interesting effects. The whistle made Jim want to laugh, because it sounded kind of funny, with Willis on speaker, the words tiny, vanishing into the concrete-floored spaces of Jim's office. “Don't worry,” Jim said, “everything's going to work out exactly the way we planned.” That was the royal we, of course; Willis was an idiot and Jim would never have let him try to plan anything. Plus which, Willis wouldn't have planned for what was going to happen any day now.
Jim smiled and patted his pocket. “Oh, come on, Will. You must have noticed what good care I take of everything I own.”
I could have allowed that to happen; and, oh, how the prospect of that safety, so cheaply acquired, tempted me. Yet, as the trace of hurt on his face before had urged me toward honesty, so now there crowded in upon me the knowledge of what would follow if I did not respond. Holmes — Sherlock — must have perceived that my reticence concerning the works I sold on Holywell Street had to do with their particular — perhaps
The stuff of John’s days took on a translucency — he felt he could, if he looked hard enough, see through to a doubled world behind every stone, every gateway, every wall. A wooden door, painted green, with a transom of green glass overhead: did it not have an air of mystery, somehow?
Two weeks and a couple of days later, on a Saturday night in mid-September, Will Holmes, aficionado of art and assistant-to-be of the powerful and shady — although they didn’t know that yet — stepped out of the lift, let the double glass door of the Hove Gallery be opened before him, and made his debut.
but he bit his tongue, and Jim smiled wider than ever and said, “What, did you think I don’t know that’s a bastardization of the findings? Give me some credit, Will. —Actually, give me a lot of credit.”
Tuesday afternoon Willis phoned on the burner Jim had supplied him with for the job. “Mr. Jenkins, the stuff's gone and I don't know where. I don't know what — ” His voice was thin, getting down near the whistle end of things.
“The animate and I had quarreled. She ran away. I took a kitchen knife and pursued her until I caught her at the Ladies’ Bathing Pond, where I used the knife to slash her throat. I made no attempt to get help of any kind but only watched as she bled to death. Her name was Galatea.”
These came to another six hundred and thirty pounds, and in view of the understandably unexpected additional expense he would drop his fee for the actual exorcism from nine hundred pounds to seven fifty — well below the standard rate for these things, no, no, there was no need to thank him; he was glad to be able to do it; this was, after all, a helping profession.
Macdermid and Zardari were assets: competent, and capable of independent thought. Skeffings, the Defence Secretary, was useful when well managed. About Cyril de la Pole there was nothing to be done but to ignore him and wait for the Prime Minister to see fit to attend briefings himself. Hareton, now — Hareton was neither here nor there unless he took it into his head that he understood a situation, but that was exactly what he had done.
He could shower now. Good idea, should have occurred to him earlier. Hot water, comforting. But bits of puke still in the tub. Sit on a stool. Hot water to wash the puke away, wash over him, wash him away.
— which he could presumably have slipped in again to remove, once whatever was in the vial had taken effect.
“Well, Will — doesn’t that sound funny? Well, Will, well will wellwill. Something like a birdcall. I think? I don’t know that much about birds.
Sherlock unlocked the door at Montague Street to find Jim seated at the kitchen table with a china cup steaming in front of him. He peeled the transmitter off his collarbone; the residue of adhesive itched. “Tea for two?”
“He’s perfectly safe. For the moment...” Eurus spoke up again, leaning forward and picking up her remote. She pressed a button and the tv screen flickered before splitting into four. One section was black with a glowing white timer frozen at 3 minutes printed into the darkness, while the other three sections were all different angles of John’s living room. John was sitting on the sofa, feet resting on the coffee table and leaned back into the soft cushions. He had Rosie cradled in his arms and she snoozed on his shoulder while he gently stroked her golden curls.
"What do you know?" She asked, clasping her mug a little tighter despite the uncomfortable heat of it pressed into her palms.
Sherlock was sitting on the living room floor (now with his jacket on, but unbuttoned) with Rosie in front of him when John walked in. Between them was a colourful plastic box with different shaped holes in the top and Sherlock was directing Rosie in putting the right shape in the right hole, pointing at whichever one correlated with the shape she had in her hand. He seemed to be having little success as Rosie was more interested in trying to eat the shapes rather than slot them into their proper place, giggling whenever he hurriedly pulled the shape from her mouth only for her to carry on her persistent chewing and for the cycle to continue.
"Perhaps it would be easier to discuss in the morning" He said after a moment of deliberation, glancing at the clock which read 3:38am. Molly bit her bottom lip, the niggling feeling of curiosity and frustration pressing at the back of her mind the only thing keeping her exhaustion at bay. Even so, she nodded slowly.
Molly blanched, blinking a couple of times before her brow furrowed, "Okay…did she call you or something?"
Sherlock exhaled slowly and closed his eyes to collect his scattered thoughts, concentrating on the unsteady breathing coming from John on the other end of the phone. “Please, John” He said gently, opening his eyes again in time to see John’s face soften ever so slightly with the phone pressed against his ear again. “Just say it”
"I’m so sorry, Sherlock" he breathed, adjusting Rosie and reaching across the table to pry Sherlock’s hand from his cup and lace it with his own. He squeezed gently and felt a small ounce of relief when there was a tiny squeeze in response.
"You can take my room, Sherlock, I’ll sleep down here" John said, rising from the sofa and, with the help of Molly, pulling Sherlock up with him. Molly was sleeping in the only the guest bedroom and John didn’t want to subject his still slightly delirious friend to the lumpy sofa that had been there when he and Mary had first moved in. He really should get around to changing it before a spring popped through one of the cushions.
After he’d burped Rosie, Molly came back into the kitchen to say goodbye, her overnight bag hanging from her shoulder. Rosie reached out to her when she came close and she gladly took the little girl into her arms. "You promise you will call if something goes wrong," She said as she bounced Rosie lightly, much to her endless amusement.
"We should probably settle her down somewhere," John said after a while, glancing up at Sherlock to gauge his reaction. His face was decidedly blank as it usually was when confronted with facts he was not quite ready to digest, but he nodded if a bit reluctantly.
"Very" Sherlock replied, handing Rosie off to John so that he could mix the formula with the water. The little girl squealed happily when her father kissed her forehead and clutched at his shirt with tiny fists. John hugged her tight and refused to wonder if Sherlock’s we’ll rest was because of his presence in the bed.
The phone went to voicemail, the robotic female voice getting cut off as Eurus ended the call, "Alright, alright, I suppose we can call one more time" she said, speaking as one might to a group of disappointed children.
"Not exactly. From what I know from Greg, his sister trapped Sherlock and Mycroft in the prison she’s been kept at since she was little and put them through…tasks" he spat out the last word like it tasted foul, "Really horrible stuff and…she tricked Sherlock into thinking she’d set up my house with bombs and that they’d go off unless he got me to tell him I love him"
Sherlock, who had been making faces at his squealing goddaughter, looked up and smiled, "Of course" he replied before his attention was recaptured by Rosie’s flailing arms and he grabbed his jacket before leaving the room. Rosie and Sherlock’s combined giggles faded down the hall and John couldn’t stop the smile from spreading on his face even if he tried.
Sherlock looked a lot younger in his sleep; like the young teenager he often acted like with his face relaxed and dark curls falling in a messy cloud around his head, ringed by golden light in a kind of halo. John thought back to find out if he had ever seen Sherlock asleep before and could only vaguely recall a time before the fall when he’d come home from shopping to find his roommate passed out on the sofa. Watching Sherlock’s face a little longer, John debated waiting for him to wake up before leaving the warm comfort of the bed, but the pressure in his bladder urged otherwise and he careful slipped out of the bed. He replaced the duvet around Sherlock, who shifted and grumbled softly in his sleep before settling again, and John left for the bathroom, wondering what it would be like to wake up like that everyday.
It’s not a proposal. John doesn’t want to chalk this up to anything as ordinary, as stereotypical, as
had only existed in his own head at the time, why should it be a problem that Jim had done the same? Sherlock had
“He’ll never stop needing you is what I mean. He’s your best friend and you need him too, I understand that, but his dependence on you is not exactly healthy.”
“Alright then,” he agrees. They both return their attention to the food and the telly, no more words to say. The silence rises between them again. The cloying-yet-comfortable, suffocating-yet-soothing silence of a thousand damning words remaining unspoken.
Sherlock feels his stomach drop. He has a habit of starting conversations without thinking it through and then never finishing once he realises what he was going to say. A habit that’s only been accentuated by his distressingly slow state of mind and the unprecedented emotional upheavals of the last weeks. But John usually lets him get away with it. Respects that Sherlock oftentimes ends up starting to say things he’d rather leave unsaid. Not so today, apparently.
“Please, Sherlock. Do you really think ignoring it will make it go away? I’ve given you a glimpse of what you could be if you let yourself go. Just a teensy glimpse. You're the one who has to make the decision."
Now all John needs is a warm cuppa and a good book while he sits back and allows his feet to return to their proper size. Christ, he’s tired. He checks his phone, no incoming calls or texts, but it’s four o’clock and dark outside, so surely Sherlock and Rosie must be right on the stairs. Perhaps he’s taken her to Hyde Park again. They somehow always manage to lose all sense of time when they're there. John would find it immensely endearing if he currently had the energy. Instead he just sinks further down in his chair and closes his eyes, listening for the familiar slam of the front door signalling Sherlock and Rosie’s return.
Sherlock’s words fail him, and he falls silent, anticipating John’s response with trepidation. He should never have said it like that, should never have emphasised his desperation so much, it’s not fair, what is John supposed to say to that other than to agree, and then Sherlock will be no better than Mary, what has he done, he never should have…
Since the Fall, since their two years spent apart and especially since John met Mary, the positive responses from John have gotten fewer and farther between. Sherlock’s response so far has been to up his focus, to try even harder, to do everything in his power for a shrinking amount of recognition. That stops now.
“John…” he hears himself begin, but he doesn’t know how to continue. He’s afraid of what he might end up saying. The
What John wouldn’t give to have Sherlock sit up right now. Sit up, smirk at him in that infuriating manner that is his custom whenever he’s done something terribly clever yet utterly scandalous and proclaim it all a big joke. John wouldn’t even get mad, not really. Whatever anger there’d be would drown in his relief.

, he brings out the worst as well. Why is it that Sherlock, the highest defender of reason, logic and intellect, must always behave like a kindergartener being robbed of his favourite toy whenever someone actually tries to reason
Jim Moriarty pulls back, removing his finger from Sherlock’s mouth and making himself comfortable in the chair that he has apparently dragged over.
John huffed a small disbelieving laugh before he opened his mouth the speak again, “Just, tell me that-”
“It’s true, Sherlock” John repeated, voice muffled from where it was hidden behind his hand and quieter than before, defeated and somehow even more tired. “It’s true and it always has been. From the very first time I saw you”
All the anguish and pain Sherlock had kept at bay burst forth in a choked sob, salty tears finally falling freely and rapidly down his cheeks as he pressed his face into John's shoulder, his body shaking with the strength of each violent sob.
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirked up in that genuine half-smile John adored and the detective rose from the sofa. "Yes, I think a walk will do all three of us some good," he said, walking over to the two Watsons and reaching up to gently pull a bit of fuzz from Rosie’s hair.
John was entering a pleasant doze when his phone rang out and Rosie squealed in delight. He jolted awake, though his limbs didn’t seem to get the memo and were still heavy as lead when he tried to reach for his phone.
"Careful, Sherlock" Eurus warned, pressing a button that momentarily filled both screens with the large timer, "Don't want to break the rules and kill poor, ickle Johnny and his precious daughter now, do we?"
"For what it’s worth, John" Sherlock started, pausing to catch John’s eyes, "I’ve never doubted you since…"
"I know! I know just-....please" Sherlock was getting desperate now and it was showing, the screens briefly switched to Moriarty's face as he made the ticking sounds of a clock before flipping back to Eurus and John. Sherlock heard Mycroft shuffling behind him and tried to keep his focus on the task at hand, "Please. Just. Say it"
They spoke quietly about mundane things over their food as Rosie drifted back off; previous cases, plans for Rosie’s future, her first proper Christmas and birthday. They skirted around the edges of what they should be talking about, ducking out anytime they felt that they got to close or that a subject was still too raw and painful to breach. It wasn’t until there was a lull in their conversation that Sherlock spoke up;
"Why would I be so clumsy? No. You didn't save him, you hurt him, just like you always do. Emotional context, Sherlock, you didn't see logic" Eurus seemed to be getting annoyed now, her voice terse and unforgiving.
“Sherlock…” Mycroft whispered and Sherlock realized he’d come to stand closer to him. His voice was comforting in a way Sherlock hadn’t heard it in years and he felt suddenly calmer than before. Not at all relaxed, far from it, but his mind had cleared enough for the words to come out smoothly enough.
John’s sigh crackled over the receiver and he paused before replying, the only sound being soft rustle of bedsheets as he gently lay Rosie in her cot. He was quiet for so long that Sherlock almost started to speak again.
"Don’t worry about me, just get yourself ready for bed" John said softly, trying to avoid Rosie’s lazily kicking legs as he changed her.
Sherlock nodded and allowed John to steer him towards a police car, leaning into the shorter man and smiling weakly as he closed his eyes.
Molly waved a hand dismissively, "It’s nothing, you know I love looking after her" she said with a reassuring smile that John could only half return. Even with Molly’s assurance that it wasn’t a bother, he couldn’t help the guilt that settled in the pit of his stomach.
"Oh Christ, John, is everything alright?" She asked, brown eyes wide as she reached out a hand to place on John’s shoulder.
They both knew they needed to talk, to iron things out before they moved forward with this new aspect of their relationship, but they were both exhausted and desperately needed a moment of quiet.
Sherlock shrugged, unable to put what he felt into words, if he was even feeling anything at all. He took a second to take stock of himself and could only find the retreating thrums of his headache confined to the back of his skull. Perhaps he should be worried about that, but he couldn’t muster up the energy to be anything more than what he was now.
"That’s good to hear. Has Rosie been behaving?" Molly asked in his ear and he snorted, glancing at Rosie who’s eyes were finally beginning to droop.
Sherlock made no comment on that. He settled in, an arm draped across John’s thigh, face snugged against John’s hip. He felt the weight of the absence of Mary on his other side, but when he closed his eyes he could feel John’s warmth, hear Rosie breathing, inhale the scent of Mary on the pillow and it was almost as if she’d just stepped out for a minute.
John did not put the kettle on. He kissed Rosie’s fingers and twirled a plastic flower for her while Harry cleaned and changed her. Then he scooped his little girl into his arms while Harry washed her hands in the bathroom.
Rosie kicked her little feet. She pushed the bottle away from her mouth. Her blue eyes wide, she hiccupped. She waved her hands. Hiccupped again. John lifted her to his shoulder and rubbed her back.
Warm. Too warm? He’d have to put her down to get the thermometer. Maybe he should just take her to the clinic. They’d have an aspirator there in any case, and she might be able to breathe properly for a while.
"What?" John can't believe his ears for a moment, which might be what gives him pause in his otherwise rapidly mounting anger. Sherlock is looking down again now, hiding his face, but John thinks he sees a glimpse of regret there. Guilt. If he does, it reflects his own. Sherlock chose not to call him when he needed help to stay clean because he didn’t want to spoil John’s mood? Because he didn’t want to interrupt John’s honeymoon? John wants to be angry at this too. He wants to bring up he and Mary's conversations over the previous months. How she would constantly remind him to make sure that Sherlock knew the wedding wouldn't change anything. How she would encourage him to take Sherlock out on a case, even going so far as to downright force him to find Sherlock a case if nothing obviously presented itself. How she would repeat to him over and over again the importance of reassuring Sherlock that it was still the good old days. And John had tried, he really had. He’d thought that Sherlock had understood. John wants to be angry that he hasn't, angry that he once again seems to underestimate and undermine the strength of their friendship.
Sherlock tries not to mind it too much. He tries to tell himself that Jim is not here to make him feel loved or appreciated. Jim is here to understand him and to help him understand himself. Help him become a better version of himself. Sherlock shuts down his desire as best he can and shrugs as much as he’s able to, bend backwards as he is. “They probably didn’t see it coming. Never do, ordinary people.”
“Shh…” Jim almost coos against Sherlock’s lips, hand still caressing his jaw. “Stop thinking so much. It’s distracting.”
Mary steps away as he speaks and John braces himself for her response. She doesn’t look particularly upset, but then sometimes that’s just the first warning that it’s worse than initially predicted.
. He was never a calculating machine, he was never a high-functioning sociopath, he was never incapable of human emotions. He was only shying away from all of it because... because there isn't room for someone like him in the world. There's no place for him amoung
And if Sherlock never wakes again… well, then, what was it all for? Sitting here and waiting for the third day in a row. Sleeping in a hospital chair whenever he can’t keep his eyes open any longer. Letting his temper flare up in the face of doctors and nurses who're only doing their best to help because his nerves are in tatters. Alienating his worried wife, who’s doing everything in her power to support him as best she can. What was all that for if Sherlock isn’t going to wake up?
Mycroft seems to be characteristically indifferent to John’s presence, which seems almost absurd in the face of such an uncharacteristic action. Perhaps he’s experiencing the same as John: focusing every inch of his attention on Sherlock to the point where everything else fades into insignificance. John wants to ask, but he doesn’t. He wants to offer some form of comfort as one normally would to a man holding the limp hand of his unconscious little brother, but John doesn’t do that either. There is no normal where the Holmes boys are unconcerned, this John knows, and Mycroft might not take too kindly to being called out on what is obviously a very rare moment of sentiment on his part.
The observant reader will have noticed that I have changed some events and dialogue from the show already. This is because, while I have been sticking pretty closely to the show so far, I haven't spent six chapters on stuff we've all already seen just because I wanted to see it again, but because I've used additional dialogue, additional scenes and a look into the characters' heads to set up events further on the story. As such, I've also felt compelled to drop some storylines from the show just for simplicity, such as Mary's pregnancy and, as you'll see in this chapter, the entire Magnussen story arc. I hope you'll like it!
“You were gone,” Sherlock repeats, his voice rising slightly in what sounds like desperation. “I didn’t intend to, I know I can’t do it, not now, but I just needed to know…”
“Listen… I know it’s not just about Christmas. I know it’s about… it’s about all of it. I mean… you never wanted to be a parent. You just sort of started to help me out and suddenly it was just… the way it was. And I can’t tell you how grateful I am for that, Sherlock, and I couldn’t do this without you, I really couldn’t, so don’t get me wrong, but… it was never really your dream, was it? Hell, when I met you… and for quite some time after that, actually… well, it didn’t even seem as though friends was something you were really… interested in. Never mind having a partner and a child.”
Sherlock is sitting in his chair. John can see him from his position at the kitchen counter. He’s looking into the fire, seemingly deep in thought. The orange glow reflects on his face.
It’s strange, that. Sherlock can’t recall any other person he’s met in his life that he’s had a desire to
Had his brain been working properly, John might have spent his few remaining seconds reminiscing on things unsaid. As it is, all his brain can manage to come up with is a panicked
Sherlock scoffs again, now moving somewhere between amused and exasperated. “Forgive me for not paying attention to the specific bank of a debit card being used twenty metres away. I shall never cease my penance walk.”
Mary moves further into the flat, towards Sherlock. Places a hand on his shoulder, looks into his eyes and asks how he’s feeling. And Sherlock replies readily. His words are a bit clipped, it’s true, and his sentences are short, but that’s nothing unusual for him and John notes with relief that he seems to have decided to make this as easy as possible rather than cause obstruction and difficulty at every turn.
Besides, with the way things are between him and Mary, it’s not as though there’s any rush. They have time now.
with it. No one has ever been as important. Girlfriends were people John visited in between his life with Sherlock, whenever Sherlock was busy or in a bad mood. Sherlock’s work has always taken centre stage. John can’t count the number of times he’s had to sleep-walk through a day at the clinic after being out and about with Sherlock well into the early hours of the morning. Even now, even with Mary, even though John has fought his emotions with much more vigour than he has ever spent on acknowledging them… even now, he’s still the most happy and sad and angry and jealous and
John puts the shopping away before joining him on the sofa. He raises an eyebrow briefly at the black screen in front of him, obviously contemplating what Sherlock has spent all this time on if he hasn’t even turned the telly on. Sherlock thinks it best to leave him to his deductions.
Mycroft returns to the living room, looking pointedly down at his brother. He fondles the handle of his umbrella, one of his specific habits. It looks every bit the superior gesture, though John suspects that it’s actually a cleverly masked agitated mannerism. Not a whole lot of compassion to be found there. But then again, John is still 95% angry and 10% sympathetic himself, so he doesn't feel as though he has room to judge.
That night, John is too angry for words. He even snaps at Mary, even though this is absolutely no fault of hers, causing her to give him the most unimpressed of looks before turning the lights off and abandoning him to his own thoughts while she sleeps. He doesn’t understand how she manages it. How can anyone sleep, how can anyone keep on living their lives as if nothing has happened, when Sherlock bloody Holmes can come crashing through the doors of The Landmark after being dead for two years with not a word of apology other than a drawn-on moustache and a cartoonish French accent?
SPOILERS AHEAD: Do not read this if you have any plans of reading this chapter and haven't done so already. However, for those of you who decided based on the trigger warning at the top to not read this chapter, here's a short summary of what happened: John, who's staying at the hospital, is frustrated and angry that Sherlock isn't getting any better and that the doctors are unable to figure out what's actually wrong with him, seeing as his brain is functioning normally and there doesn't appear to be any reason for his prolonged unconsciousness, which is now moving onto day three. John is conflicted about his feelings for Sherlock and his feelings for Mary, but with Sherlock unconscious, there's just too much else on John's mind for him to properly deal with that confusion, so he instead chooses to redirect it into anger, an emotion he is much more comfortable with and doesn't need to dissect too much.
Sherlock opens his eyes to the sound of a text alert. His muscles are relaxed. His breathing is easy. At least that’s as expected.
It’s hateful, all of it. The way he’s lying here, curled up in the foetal position like a complete moron, just because he’s alone again. The way he wishes – yes, wishes – for Moriarty to keep his promise and come back. Why must he be so horribly unforgivably
“Because… look, even if he wouldn’t do the same for me, I know it’s not because he doesn’t care. It’s because he doesn’t think like that. He doesn’t know or care to know what the generally accepted way of showing something is. He wouldn’t spend three days sleeping on a plastic chair in a hospital just to watch over me if I was unconscious. He would spend three days researching and assessing every little scrap of information he could find about what may induce a prolonged state of unconsciousness to better understand what was happening to me while my other friends and family would sit with me in hospital and exchange head shakes about his unforgivable lack of compassion.”
“You don’t have to do it alone. I can help you fix it, Sherlock. That’s what I do for a living, remember? I’m a consulting criminal. I help people fix their problems when laws can’t help them. And isn’t that just the situation you’re in, sweetheart?”
Still, John can’t quite find it in him to agree with Sherlock on this one. How exactly Sherlock’s parents ever managed to produce Sherlock and Mycroft are one of nature’s unsolved mysteries to be sure, and Sherlock’s mother might have some of those aforementioned Holmes family traits, but it doesn’t mean that they don’t love him and John can’t help but smile at the sight of Sherlock’s father ruffing Sherlock’s pillow while his mother tries to get him to agree to a phone call later in the evening. John’s own parents are nothing like this and Sherlock doesn’t seem to have the first idea how lucky he actually is.
“What was it then?” He smiles. “And don’t pretend like you can’t remember, because it was quite clearly important.”
Mary’s kisses are nearly always clinical. Brief, but insistent. Quite a bit of pressure between their mouths. No hesitance, limited delicacy, but quite reassuring all the same. Firm. The kisses of a nurse. It’s only on very rare occasions, usually in the throes of passion, that she kisses him in a different way. More demanding, more passionate, more risky. Less of a statement that we belong together and more of an affirmation that we’re here and we’re willing and to hell with it all. John likes when she does that. Though he’s loath to admit it, her usual kisses can sometimes feel a bit…
“You’ll always be shunned for your uniqueness, my dear. Ordinary people, they don’t understand you and they never will.” His voice sounds plaintive. Saddened almost, or about as close as Jim Moriarty can manage. “They will give you names. You’ve already heard some of them. Freak, psychopath. They will brand you. They will look for deviance, and they will strike when they find it. They will lock you up all on your own. They will fear you. They will hate you. All because they cannot understand you.” Jim’s eyes veritably glisten with intensity as they bore into Sherlock’s. He can hardly breathe. “But I do, Sherlock. You know that, don’t you? I will not give you names. I will not brand you. I will not lock you up. I don’t fear you. I don’t hate you. I will look for your deviance. And I will love every second of it.”
It’s true that they have often theorised what he could do with an unlimited brain power. Time and time again, they’ve sat up late at night and fantasised about it, imagined what it would be like to be able to deduce things before they happened. Thought about how people might react. Discussed the kinds of experiments he could carry out and the kinds of theories he could develop if he could only dedicate his entire self to his brain. Abandon all else and be just that superior mind.
“I understand why you’re listening to him. A drowning man will clutch at a straw, isn’t that the expression? But we both know you shouldn’t do this. What is it you’re trying to achieve? Do you want to be better, smarter? You are clever, Sherlock. We are clever. But the kind of clever you aim for, the incandescent… it’s just a dream. Nobody could be that clever.”
He used to be so clever, didn’t he? Back then when he and John had just met each other and everything was new and exciting because Sherlock for the first time in his life had someone who didn’t make him feel as though he was alone in a crowd. Someone who would listen to his deductions, smile and say
“No, I mean it. He sits alone up in that flat, completely secluded from the world around him unless you’re there to drag him out into it. And I know you somehow feel responsible for that, but you really shouldn’t. You don’t owe him anything, John. Perhaps it was different some years ago. Perhaps things worked differently between you back then. Perhaps it wasn’t an issue. But it is now. He was the one who decided to leave you, John, and then he decided to come back. And now he expects things to be the way they were, and you’ve just decided to indulge him.”
Mary drives on. He doesn’t wave. He just locks himself in, heads for the kitchen and makes himself a cup of tea that he decides upon the first sip is too light for him right now. Instead he finds a bottle of wine, leftover from an evening with friends of course, and pours himself a glass of that.
Now that Mary is sitting beside him, throwing the intensity of his grief over a friend into stark relief against the intensity of his feelings for his wife, it no longer feels just right. It’s as though the fiction they’ve all been struggling to maintain over the past months – the insistent narrative that “we’re a couple and he is our friend” – just does not hold up under the closer scrutiny it's now being placed under in the harsh light of recent events. Perhaps it’s the final straw in a revelation that’s been a long time coming. Perhaps it’s just that John is back, back on the pavement outside Bart’s, and now it’s the second time he’s said too little too late and allowed Sherlock to slip through his fingers. Who’s to say if he’ll be given a third chance?
Now that he’s thinking about it, a quick shot would be most welcome right about now. It doesn’t matter what. Cocaine, heroine, morphine, Sherlock isn’t picky.
Sherlock’s voice momentarily falters. There’s a wetness around the edges of his eyes that looks horrifyingly like tears.
Disorientated and slightly numb, Sherlock performs his closing duties as best man. A short speech, a cue for the music to start and he’s finally off-duty. John and Mary are still looking at him as people start to move onto the dance floor and Sherlock makes his way towards them.
And so it’s Mary’s hand on his that keeps him grounded and mostly well-behaved, though Sherlock’s doctor couldn’t possibly fail to notice how tight John’s responding smile is. It’s Mary’s hand on his that keeps him from falling apart right here where everyone can see him, holding the pieces of him together if only through sheer force of will.
“No!” John takes a moment to locate his words. “No, I don’t want that, Mary! I don’t want… You’re my wife! My Mary! Alright? I love you! I don’t want to leave you, I don’t want anything of the sort! I married you and I don’t regret that, not for a second! I just… I’m not… not good right now! I’m confused, Mary, and I need time!”
ordinary. But John still doesn’t like it. The silence unnerves him. It’s a bit too reminiscent of recent events.
John takes a deep breath. Tries to steady his voice. “Listen, if you want to pretend that you can handle this on your own because you’re the great Sherlock Holmes who doesn’t need help from the intellectually less gifted, that’s fine by me. Pretend, for all I care. But I’m not walking out that door until I’m absolutely certain, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I won’t come back to find you lying on the floor. Do you understand me?!”
But that’s where the difficulty arises. Mary isn’t a passive participant, a presence unfelt. She makes herself very known and, though Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind and John doesn’t feel that he should either, it isn’t the same as before. They’re doing exactly the same things as they used to do two years ago, but Mary’s presence has altered their dynamic in a pretty drastic way, one that John is having a very hard time ignoring. John isn’t able to give Sherlock his undivided attention for hours as he used to. Sherlock no longer directs all his inquiries towards John. (Does Sherlock talk to Mary too when she isn’t there? That thought leaves John with a bad taste in his mouth.)
“Fine then. But I’ll be back first thing in the morning. And you’ll call me immediately if there is a problem, do you understand?”
