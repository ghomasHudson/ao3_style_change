"Oh, shopping for the little brother then? How sweet." She leant over and talked to Felix in his pram by the desk. "Are your big brothers taking you out then? Isn't that nice of them!"
"Crap day at work!" She said, putting a mouthful of food in her mouth and sighing.
"Yes." Sherlock said, surly and glaring back at John. "Halloween is supposed to be frightening!" He exclaimed adamantly.
Thank you to everyone who commented on the first chapter, it completely made my day/week!! Please keep commenting if you like it because it gives me the motivation to write! Hope you enjoy the chapter!! :)
“Beating you!” He grinned.
“Sherlock? Oh come on Sherlock, just cause I beat you!”
"No. I will not ask for his help."
After purchasing a pair of trunks from the front desk for each of them, as neither of the pair seemed to have owned any, and of course Felix didn’t. The group wandered into the hot changing rooms, which were clammy and foggy with hot steam.
“Papi?” Felix asked, trying out each syllable carefully as he looked towards John.
“Happy Birthday to youuuuuu”
"And you? What do you do?"
"Oh, well I kind of thought it might convince them more if I looked tanned. But I didn't think It through...anyway, goodbye Harry. Thank you." He beamed, putting his jacket on and going to open the door.
"Yeah, just a little bit..." John trailed off, glad that she understood how he felt so well.
"What?" I asked raising an eyebrow.
"Oh right, yeah can I talk to about something?" John asked tentatively.
What kind of experiments?? ;)
Until he saw it. He froze where he was, his mind blank and empty. He felt like all the life had been sucked out of him. There was John, his John.... Kissing a girl. A girl, (that with all probability) John had just met. Sherlock was rooted to the spot and his eyes were locked on the couple. Unable to move, he had no option but to watch them for the couple of seconds it took before John looked up and pulled away. Almost as if he could sense Sherlock's presence.
"Oh. Well. John you don't have to go yet do you?" She asked looking sad.
"Nah."
"Sherlock. I know you feel this sudden need to try and bring up your new child prodigy, and also for you to not have to admit to Mycroft that you can’t do something, god forbid! But I just don't think that this is possible!"
"Then I cannot see a problem!"
Yesss..... Why???? :)
John suddenly had the first genuine smile on his face that evening as he leapt to his feet. He wanted to see Harry the most out of all of his family. He loved his sister to bits and she had always been there for him, and never failed to relieve the awkwardness between him and his parents, and to serve as a bridge between them. As soon as Harry saw John, her smile reached into a big grin.
"Yeah, they are designed for babies." He looked at Sherlock's raised eyebrows and sighed, knowing full well that none of these little farmyard sets or Noah's arks were going to be gracing their flat any time soon. He huffed, and took one last glance at the aisle, as Sherlock threw his elephant into the corner of a shelf, where it made a loud clattering noise, over the gentle shop music.
John's heart broke even more at this, the sight of his friend who was always strong, always sarcastic and defiant, always the one who never showed emotion, suddenly becoming someone who needed him. John tightened his lip so he could appear stronger than he felt, and moved over and sat next to his friend.
In particular his father had forever complained of any expense spent around his birthday or anyone else's. Complained that the money could be spent better elsewhere. A result of this childhood filled with no birthdays, was that John never wanted anyone to make a fuss. And even the mere thought of his Birthday happening filled him with dread. Therefore, he took great pains to ensure that none of his friends or anyone knew that it was approaching the next day. This way, he figured nobody could make a fuss or spend ‘pointless’ money on him for a ‘ridiculous’ celebration of his birth.
"Roata's!"
"Okay fine. We shall get a nanny."
"Its for the 7 month old birthday, which apparently the number 7 and an anniversary is associated with copper, so that's why the box has-"
Sooo, what you up to now???? :)
"Oh don't worr-" she started, but then gave in and let John carry the biggest suitcase for her. "Thanks."
Before John had even agreed. Sherlock's face grew into a smug smile, feeling the glory of winning the competition against Mycroft, and he held the baby out at arms length to talk to him.
He opened the door quickly and knocked it shut behind him, moving on along the corridor until he heard a noise behind him. It was Ollie from next door. He was looking at Sherlock, clearly having spotted perhaps something move underneath the coat and shouted after Sherlock who paid him no heed but kept moving swiftly on towards the girls dorm.
John got up and grabbed his jacket and his phone which he'd put on the side earlier, and without a glance back, walked through the door, slamming it behind him.
"Yeah, see you in a bit."
“These things are worth knowing, for example do you know his neck measurements?”
“Arms?-”
It was the afternoon on their second day back at the school, of which the morning had been spent enduring an excessively long and boring assembly and the equally as 'tedious, mundane activity' as Sherlock had put it, of the handing out of timetables. They both had lessons in a few minutes, and were currently taking Felix over to Molly's dorm room, because she had frees that afternoon, and needed to unpack her stuff in her room, so had requested that they bring him over to hers rather than the pair's own dorm. This John thought may prove to be problematic due to the simple fact that Felix was pretty much illegally living at the school and therefore couldn't be seen by anyone, but since Molly was doing such a favour to them, John hadn't wanted to refuse.
“Why not?’
"Sherlock. Look I've printed out the pictures." He sat down at the table, where Sherlock joined him to look at them.
John was thankful that Sherlock had actually done something, he looked over at the cot, and then back at Sherlock then he frowned, his mind thinking.
“It’s interesting! Here get this..." he said reading off from the page. "Apparently a baby isn’t supposed to be crawling until they are 6 or 7 months old! Feli-"
“Oh come on! I’ve been waiting ages you know?” John joked, pretending to look down at a non-existent watch and tutting. He grinned at Sherlock as his friend gritted his teeth and waded to the edge.
"Alright but are you ok-?"
“Erm-”
"Fine, something more unusual... Samuel?"
About fifteen minutes later, there was knock on their door, Sherlock upon hearing the knock, swiftly moved onto John's bed with Felix, (as it was completely hidden from the sight of the doorway) whilst John opened the door. This being their standard procedure to keep Felix hidden, which had become a habit of theirs.
27th January
John sighed and pulled a jumper over his head and padded over to the sofa. Harry began to hum the tune to Happy Birthday as she pulled the mugs out, clattering as she did so and giving sidelong glances over to John.
“Hello” The man said,
This jarred something in John's chest and he wanted overwhelmingly to apologise to Sherlock although he didn't know what for... surely it was just to apologise about their argument they had had earlier... or maybe... John and Sherlock's eyes locked for a moment more and John could see some sort of feeling he had never seen before in his friend's eyes... perhaps it was pain? Suddenly, their moment was snapped by John's friends pushing their way rowdily out of the fire escape, laughing and drunkenly shoving each other.
“That is a preposterous statement. I am not scared of a child’s slide.”
He stood just staring at his hand, his independent hand, which had wanted to be placed where it now sat.
They had been at it all morning, Sherlock said he was- 'founding the child's scientific knowledge to enable him to achieve his academic potential,' but at this age, John guessed that he was probably just making things react in different colours for the child's amusement. At least it kept them occupied even if it did make a lot of noise he thought.
Oh nothing nothing :) How old are you??
Nope ;) anyway what you up to??
"Oh, don't be a dick! Of course I like you!"
He shook his head adamantly and paused what he was doing. "It wouldn't."
I do not understand.
No.... I can't possibly be thinking...? No. Certainly not. No.
There was a small girl, wearing a cat costume sitting on a front wall of a house they went up to. She waved at the three of them and leapt down.
"Hey, i'll come with you."
"Hurry up."
John felt rather apprehensive to the night out once they started the steady twenty minute walk to the town. He glanced across at what he could see of Greg in the dim partially moonlit night, Greg grinned back at him before yelling across the noise the others were making ahead of them.
"Okay, right..." She winked at him and then shook her head and laughed. "You've totally surprised me there Johnny boy! Did not expect that!"
"Well, we um, have sort of obtained a child." He blurted, speaking very quickly.
John hurriedly sat down and dropped his bag beside him and his mother sat down next to him on the sofa.
"No but this is insane! Am I actually agreeing to this? Why am I agreeing to this?"
"He won't."
"What? Stulti? Huh? Anyway, it's just a kids book! It's meant to be lik-"
"I am fully aware of the basic laws of Physics, thank you Molly." He curtly replied, glaring at her.
"He's good, yeah. It's going to be difficult not to let anyone into our dorm room, what with school friends and all of that, bu-"
“Felix! This is your Daddy” John said to the boy and picked him up and put him on Sherlock’s lap.
No :)
"you want to keep running after that?"
Sherlock beamed and spun Felix around, red paint spraying all around them. John couldn't help but grin, and he suddenly relaxed into it. Pushing aside his own ideas for a costume, he went over to join the pair, and began to add his own smears of red paint onto Felix, a smile dawning on his face as he did so.
"You are staying with us now! Whether Uncle Mycroft likes it or not."
They shifted the cot over to one side of the room and, moved across the sofa slightly to fit it in. Then John picked up the baby, still gripping his union jack cushion, and put him in it. The baby sat and stared up at John. John looked down, he had been half expecting the baby just to fall asleep just because he had been put into a cot, but obviously that was not going to be the case.
He texted Sherlock on the tube to tell him he was coming back and was amused at the reply.
"Hello Molly, this is Felix. Felix this is Molly." He introduced, Making gestures from each person to the other. Molly's face broke into a smile.
He evaluated the facts, he was trapped in the room because of Felix, so he knew he couldn't go out and look for John until he had someone to take care of him. No matter what John thought, he wasn't entirely irresponsible, and cared more than he would admit for the little boy. With his phone completely out of use, he realised as he tentatively picked it up, shards of glass falling out as he did so, his only choice was to go and find Molly himself.
All the group surrounded them in a circle, the music loud and heavy enough that there was no point in even attempting conversation. John looked around to the raucous bar area, craving the taste of another cold beer, as with each one he had he was slowly getting further from the stresses of Sherlock, and he was starting to even find he was enjoying himself, in spite of the earlier fight they had had. Although something still lingered, a sense of something, he didn't know what it was. His fuzzy mind couldn't understand it, a sort of want for something? He brushed it aside, blaming it on his cravings for another beer, not thinking it could be anything else.
“Labels Johnny, labels, they’re just things. I have a label maker at home now you know.”
It appears to be so.
"Ohmygoodness he's adorable!" She exclaimed jumping up and down and making baby noises at Felix and tickling him. "What's his name?"
“They are still stupid books.” Sherlock said over his shoulder whilst walking back into the kitchen.
She moved him back so she could look at him, keeping her hands on his shoulders.
"Yeah, sometimes the same. mainly a bit longer, 300 or 400."
"Oh, well she's um, just a girl who was on the same course as me."
"Sher-" he began, not quite knowing what to say or what Sherlock's reaction would be to the names he'd just said. He soon found out. Sherlock, running his hand through his hair, stood up and walked towards his case and started to violently unpack it. All hilarity cut out of the air around them, changing it instead to an awkward atmosphere.
“Yes.”
"Sherlock, it's this way."
I have been informed of the so called "weird" nature of my personality.
He was smart, he understood it was only the start of term and he couldn't have been expected to be in this year's A team immediately, but it was always the same people, they just managed to be that little bit better than John at the game, and therefore he never seemed to get a chance.
“He's four months.” Said Sherlock crouching down to eye level with the child and peering into the boy’s eyes, who stared back.
As John's mates stood with him at the bar, they had caught the attention of a tall and blonde girl standing next to them, in the same position, waiting to get a drink. She was wearing a tight fitting skirt and a low cut top, and had a bag slung over one shoulder. Her heels gave the impression of height, elongating the look of her legs.
“I don’t know? Any ideas? I just thought we should. Now we have the pram.” He said excitedly. “Actually, can we go to the shopping centre? I think we need some more baby clothes.”
"We will have frees at different times we can take care of him then, leave him in our dorm room the other times."
"Good."
“Fine.” Where are we going to put him then?”
“It could be, what’s wrong with it as a first name?”
"Okay. So... Wow, right so you actually have a child?"
Sherlock wore goggles as well which were steamed up so much John couldn't see his eyes. He was handling a small piece of metal with silver tweezers which he was holding over a beaker full of boiling dark liquid.
"You didn't answer my question." He replied.
"Ah okay."
Sentiment, emotions, they weren't supposed to affect him... but he suddenly needed John, he knew he needed him. He wanted to bring him back, to apologise. He jumped up suddenly, off of the sofa, startling Felix who looked up at him bemused. He then grabbed his phone and found Molly's contact with in a couple of seconds. He debated texting her but then realised it needed to be quicker than a text so pressed the dial button. It rang out several times before he flung it down on the floor in frustration. Sherlock looked down at his phone which was now lying shattered on the floor. A myriad of criss-crossing zigzag breaks had erupted over the entire screen as if it was lightning. Sherlock moaned lightly as he picked it up, looking over it in dismay.
“He seemed perfectly happy with the tea I gave him this morning.” He said without looking up from his paper.
His eyes followed my every move, as I walked over towards our kettle- we had 'borrowed' it from the kitchen downstairs, Sherlock insisting we would give it back after just using it for just the one cup of tea... Something which (unsurprising to me) hadn't happened yet. Not that I was really complaining. I flicked it on, and pulled out a tea bag and cleanish looking mug. Turning around, I tried to match Sherlock's quizzical gaze with one of my own.

“There you go.”
Yeah! Oh course there is! :)
"Well. What's she like? Are you two dating yet?"
"I don't need sleep." He muttered, returning to his tapping.
One of the star players already this term, who had not only attracted the coach's attention, but apparently the attention of all the girls in their year, was a new boy called Greg Lestrade. John couldn't help but like Greg, he just had that likeability factor. You would think because of his popularity he wouldn't be a nice person, that it would have tainted him somehow, gone to his head. However underneath it all, he was a genuinely friendly person too, despite the unsavoury characters he hung out with.
"Okay, you will?"
I write with correct punctuation.
"That's okay! I saw you come in and thought the least I could do- considering- what you're doing...was to come and help you with your bags!"
"Hello. Just thought we would. Come around, say hello. We're next door! And, new here. Um... Yeah, we wanted to come-"
“Yeah if he has arms too big for his body it means something, can’t remember what though exactly.”
"What?"
“The mere fact it is called a ‘Slide of Death’ is quite enough to discourage.” Sherlock replied his eyebrows moving into a frown.
"It's fine." Sherlock abruptly cut in.
He saw a strange sight. Sherlock, who should have been holding the baby, instead was looking down in fascination at the child-who was on the floor.
"Really? I just wasn't-"
"I didn't me-" Sherlock started, suddenly horrified at what he had begun.
"Sherlock... Is that an appropriate costume for a baby to be wearing?" John asked, coming over closer to look at his son.
"She's not going near Felix! She would ruin his potential IQ!"
“What about Tobias? I like Tobias.” John said, turning the name over in his mind.
"So you've not even got it once?"
“I’m checking the man. Stay here”
"No! Leave me alone" he shouted, wildly raising his arms before turning around and throwing himself onto the sofa face first.
"Yeah, it is. Although I have to bring a girl back to meet my father next time I go."
"There you go, you feeling slightly better?" John asked, sitting down next to him, with his own cup of tea. Sherlock just nodded and sipped his tea languorously.
"That's okay." Molly muttered, slightly taken aback at being thanked by Sherlock, although the whole afternoon had been surprising! Although Sherlock's new found politeness didn't last for long, a few seconds later he was back to his old self again.
The dorm rooms were in sets of ten beds to a dorm for all of the lower school, but now that the pair were in lower sixth, they could have the privilege of getting a dorm to share with one other sixth former (provided they were of the same gender.) John, as was said previously, had sent in his room allocation request to be with Sherlock. Now, they had a small room to themselves, which felt to John like a miniature flat. The walls had dark wooden panelling and so did the floor, but the floor was also covered by a giant rug which was made of threads of dark blue, black and red's woven together into a old fashioned pattern of triangles and squares. The furniture in the room was, as you entered, to the left- two wooden beds which matched the darkness of the wood which surrounded the rest of the room. Each headboard had a patten carved into the wood, made up of swirls, and each bed was made with a thick, woollen blanket laid on top.
"It's bloody well raining"
“Fine.”
Please please comment if you enjoy it or if you dont! I want to hear what everybody thinks! Thankyou!!! :) xxx
"Sherlock. It's, it's just beautiful. It's perfect." She replied, watching his face light up with an slightly bashful smile.
"No really, there's no need!-"
John pushed the door open to his dorm and went inside, Sherlock was sitting with Felix on the sofa, where he was reading him a large book which looked suspiciously like a medical school textbook, with detailed anatomy drawings and labelled pictures of injuries and wounds. Obviously the perfect bedtime story for a baby.
Upon saying this, Mycroft left.
"I would." He mused, grinning whilst he traced round the edge of his mug with one long finger, before looking up at John who he could see was desperately trying to find a way around his threat.
“Yeah but he’s not-”
"Yes you do! I didn't mean for you to stay up all night trying to find a nanny! We have still got a week to sort it."
"Yes." Sherlock said, trying to move away from the boy and pulling in the bundle closer to his chest, which Oliver noticed and thought it was rather strange.
"The problem is. I... I want to wrap it, but I have no paper, and I don-"
Righht well that was cool! :) what else can you do??
Your weird you know that?
"Right, so I have some tissue paper here..." She said holding up some pale blue delicate paper. "And here is some... well it isn't wrapping paper, it's more old wallpaper... but it's okay i'm sure you can wrap it in that." She handed them across to Sherlock, who hid from Felix behind the sofa with all the items, whilst Molly played with Felix to keep him distracted.
John closed his eyes and sighed, knowing it was to come to an end, and as his fingertips left Sherlock’s skin, and he drew his hand away, feeling the sensation falling out of his grasp once again, he felt warm lips on his own.
Sherlock was convinced by Harry’s Insistence that John needed him there with Felix because it promoted healthy childhood logic and would remove the fear of abandonment in the child. Sherlock was not in fact convinced in the slightest by this argument, but was somewhat curious as to what this WaterLand would entail as he had never been swimming in a place more than a small 2 metre deep pool where he had laboriously swam lengths. Also he felt deep down a sadness that he had not known about his friend’s birthday. A feeling he was trying to bat away, but which kept returning. He thought that at least he could be there with him and Felix as it seemed to make John happy when they acted like a family. Perhaps, Sherlock thought, he would use that and try to spend the day proving to John how good a family they were together.
Haha no I don't! :) nobody seems to want me too badly as their boyfriend! :(
"What?"
Please leave a comment if you like it! :D
"John!" He shouted gleefully, holding out Felix for him to see. "Look!"
The pair stood on the bank of the Thames watching the colourful array of fireworks burst overhead. Someone had set fire to a Guy in a bin nearby, John felt as though this could have been done as a homage to the great bonfires which traditionally happen on Bonfire Night, however the more probable answer was a group of 12 year olds simply thought it’d be funny to burn it.  The air was bitterly cold and biting at his face, so he could only imagine what it would be like for Felix with his tiny little body. So he tucked his son’s little scarf into his coat so it fell over his face so he would be warm. Felix pointed at the sky his little face lit up with colours, and even under the scarf John could hear and see that he was laughing and gurgling at the display going on in front of him.
No. I don't have '"Friends". They are unnecessary.
"Of course you would have to live here in the holidays and we would have to have the same dorm room this year, but you barely leave here anyway, it's just a matter of getting you ke- oh- yeah, you already have keys."
"No, she won't. She would never do something like that. She understands."
An hour later, Molly climbed up the steps to the flat and was met at the top by John, whose mouth was straining into an awkward smile.
“I’m not.” He replied flatly. “Birthdays are ridiculous celebrations. Why celebrate the fact you exist, with trivialities such as cake and… laughter.”
He looked down in horror, his mind searching for a reasonable explanation.
"Sherlock!" John shouted through from the other room. "Come here for a second."
You have no self control.
John was slightly amazed and bemused at actually getting an apology out of Sherlock, usually this was only used if he really wanted something! Maybe he'd panicked him. 'Good.' He thought.
“Why don’t you want me to read the book?” John asked suspiciously, his eyes narrowing at his friend whilst looking up at Sherlock’s indignant face.
“Mycroft. We have a....situation.”
I never get caught.
I mean what kind of person!!! :(
Sherlock exclaimed and pushed himself into the slide as soon as he’d seen his friend disappear and he too was plunged into darkness. The slide twisted and turned and the rushing water underneath them pulled them along.
Sherlock in this situation would have usually gone running after the shooter, regardless of the danger. But this was different.
To think that John had felt jealous of Molly taking up all of Sherlock's time, no not jealous. Just... Confused. John put the idea out of his mind, the whole matter of his jealously making him feel odd, like he could... Maybe he- he. No. Him and Sherlock were friends, not even friends, Sherlock had managed to ruin that one, John wasn't even sure he could be such good friends with Sherlock acting so difficult all the time.
Heyyjhds shetrlcokd!!hj
To say it was a mess in there would be an severe understatement. John didn't think he'd ever seen it look so eclectic, and considering Sherlock had been in the flat for years, that was saying something!
“How am I meant to know?”
Wow! :) what are the chances!
"Absurdly easy to convince."
John was dreading going back home that afternoon. Although he was only going back really to get his school things, and had managed to convince his parents that he needed to stay around a friend's house that night, because they were going to giving him a lift back to school, he still had to go and make small talk all afternoon and tell them about his summer, all which he would have to elaborately make up. He sighed and hoped the day would go by quickly.
After a very short time Sherlock had sobered up entirely, all the alcohol now being out of his body. John had cleaned up his sick from the floor, despite Sherlock's protestations, who had been ordered to remain huddled in the blanket on the sofa. Once John was done and sat back down he heard Sherlock murmur under his breath.
“Here you go Birthday boy” Harry sang, whilst handing John a cup of tea.
John jogged onto the field, trying to keep his mind focused on the game he was about to partake in. It was his first chance since being put of the A team for hockey that he had had for showing the team and the coaches what he could do, and he was determined not to mess it up. He looked up at the greying sky, hoping it didn't rain and put the match off.
"Asleep."
He sat on the tube, which was reasonably empty on this line, although would get less so once he changed onto the Victoria Line in a couple of moments. Getting slightly hot, he took off his jacket where he was wearing a short sleeved shirt underneath, he looked down at his arms in horror. He had forgotten he had put the fake tan on his arms as well, and it was streaked in a patchy mess across his forearms. John hurriedly put his jacket back on and cursed himself for being so stupid to think he could just stick fake tan on and look like he had a real tan. Why had he listened to Sherlock? He suddenly realised that he would not be able to take his jacket off for the rest of the afternoon, which made him groan and regret the fake tan even more. He only thanked his luck that he had got on a dark shirt and jacket and so if it rubbed off, it at least wouldn't be visible on his clothes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's useful."
“Okay.” He said in a small voice and gave a quick smile up to Sherlock, who moved himself away from in front of the pram.
Wow so you're like proper on crime scenes, and solving crimes and everything!! :0
Sherlock looked up, suddenly panicked at the reality of the thought of John leaving him alone with the child, believing fully that John would have just helped him willingly.
“No you wouldn’t. Anyway you are up half the night usually, why can’t he go into your room?”
You can tell a lot about a man by the size of his arms you know”
"I'm sorry, but we are here to introduce ourselves. Are we going to do so?"
"John. Think of this instead, as a chance to record a life of another individual, from as early as four months old!"
“Don’t like that name.”
Yeah!!
Although to be fair to them, Sherlock did look rather peculiar, he is tall for his age anyway, and currently wearing a dramatic long black coat with his dark curls falling around his head like a wild disheveled birds nest. What made it worse was he was on the floor on his front looking at a patch of grass by the edge of the swings through his magnifying glass, and John was sure that in the mothers minds this was Sherlock ‘ready to pounce’ on their unsuspecting children.
"He- hey! I was reading that to Felix!" He said indignantly
"No, go on. You can't time yourself like that."
"No. I'm done with this. I'm going out. Leave me alone"
John was one of the players in the game, and he gripped his hockey stick tighter in his hand as he waited for the ball to come up to his end. Expectantly poised, he flinched and then prepared himself as he thought the ball may come near him. However, it got to just past the centre before it was turned around and went back up to the other end again. He bit down on his gum shield firmly, attempting to take away the full force of his irritation towards the game.
My brother says that i need to talk to people.
"Sherl-" Mycroft began
"Oh, yeah that would be great! Sounds fun." John said smiling and grabbing his keys from the stand by the door, following Greg out, and closing the door firmly behind him, without even a glance behind him.
"Oh- real-? oh right..." The woman stuttered, confused, and becoming awkward and flustered. Bowing her head, she quickly finished scanning the items.
"A girl?"
Hello again! Hope that the people still reading this story enjoy the update :) As always, comment to tell me what you think! It really brings me joy to hear what you guys think! Love you all! xxxx
"With your... "Friend"..." She mimed the quotation marks in the air, and raised one eyebrow at him.
“Well how else am I meant to find out about how we should be bringing up Felix?!”
It is necessary to acquire as much data as possible when in my field of work.
well night Sherlock :) Been nice talking to you :P
There they found two teddy bears, which John fell in love with and became determined to buy, despite Sherlock declaring loudly that children should not be given ‘such caricatures of life’, and that bears ‘look nothing like these toys and by giving them to children it will make them all the more willing to approach a dangerous animal’, this speech of his, made a woman further down the row give them a strange look, which of course, still didn’t hush Sherlock up. But John insisted on buying them, and so they went to the counter where they joined the back of the queue.
"Well what about if they don't? I don't know any nurseries near our school do you? Sherlock it's in the middle of nowhere!" John was getting himself into a state and so took in a deep breath to calm himself before continuing. "What other options are there?" He slowly asked, holding his head in his hands.
"Mendelssohn, Felix Mendelssohn" John whispered, in awe at the beauty and thoughtfulness of Sherlock's gift.
"Molly."
“What is his speciality? What’s he good at then?”
"Okay, here is your 'John cup of tea' then!" I said as I handed him a mug, before bringing Felix over, and my own mug, we all sat down on the sofa together.
A week later John and Sherlock were  the most exhausted that they had ever been. For the last week they had spent every single night being woken up at 1 hour, 2 hour intervals throughout. It was apparent to Sherlock that Felix was teething, as he wailed and grasped his mouth and just wanted to bite everything he could find, which meant Sherlock was forbidden by John to put Felix in the kitchen and to keep him away from all toxic materials for the time being, orders which he grumpily was forced to comply with. John's book hadn't been a lot of help, and after attempting many times to put to use the advice from it, only to be put down by Sherlock, he had given up.
"Wow." John murmured, his eyes scouring every inch of it.
"So what?"
The couple restrained their laughter and collapsed onto the sofa with Felix sitting in-between them. The child looked up between the pair, from one to the other with a confused look on his face.
"Not happening! Billy?"
Omg, so youve called the police then??
John gave him a smile back and looked over his shoulder where Sherlock would have been but wasn't.
Half an hour later, Sherlock came back though their door and shut it behind him.
Merry Christmas for Thursday! :D and please comment if you liked it! Or want to see anything in the story and i shall do my best :) i love to hear what you think! :) thankyou!!
"Mm don't let anyone see him....I will wait in the orchard whilst you get the key."
"Okay."
"No he's not, I'm sorry." John affirmed grinning and looking back up to Sherlock and catching his eye for a moment, before he continued with the experiment.
'Gay. Teenage. Too young to be parents. Got a girl knocked up. A disgrace. Shouldn't be allowed.The youth today!'
Suddenly thinking of what Sherlock might be doing, as it was very quiet, he hurried into the living room with the bottle.
"Well why do I have to listen to you! I didn't cancel on my friends to sit here and listen to you saying this sort of-"
"Felix. Lovely. How long have you had him for?"
He took in a breath and continued.
"Well that's all, goodbye Molly. See you at school." He insisted. ushering her out of the door and firmly shutting it behind her.
“No. He’s- he’s dead.”
John just smiled at his friend. "No trouble at all, it was my pleasure."
There were no more texts from Sherlock after that, and when John walked into the flat everything was surprisingly quiet. He went through into their living room, where Sherlock was sitting waiting for him on his chair reading a newspaper, and he looked up as John came in.
Oh okay :) I want to be a doctor in the army maybe :)
“Or swimming.”
Sherlock was holding Felix in his arms, the little boy dressed in a long dark coat and black top hat which was clearly too big for him, and completely covered in red paint. The paint had somehow managed to also find its way to be all over the kitchen counter, floor, splatterings on the walls, all over Sherlock and also every appliance in the kitchen.
Thankyou to anyone who is still reading this!!! I'm sorry i've had so many exams at school so I haven't been updating much! :( But I promise I will try to be better with it! Here's another chapter for you :) Please please comment if you enjoy it as your comments mean the world to me!! Thankyou!! Xxxx
"What! What?" John asked moving to see the watch. As he saw the little numbers on the screen his eyes widened.
"It's fine" She said smiling. "I really don't mind at all."
"It's fine." He repeated, throwing a shirt onto his bed from his case, and then picking up the entire case and tipping it onto the floor by the end of his bed.
"Yeah. Wow, thanks." He exclaimed, sitting down on his chair.
"Barry for short."
I'm on the tube which is taking an irritatingly long time to arrive.
"What on earth are you doing?" He asked laughing.
“John, he’s crawling.”
to get across emotions when you can’t see someones face i guess!... :)
“You didn’t beat me. It was the velocity of the slide. Mine just happened to be slower. You did not, beat me.”
"No, Sherlock, I'm getting on the Victoria line now."
"I will not have you read him that sort of unstructured literary stultiloquence!"
"Really? Okay then!" John said looking surprised and vaguely relieved. Sherlock pulled his phone from his pocket and started tapping away, and went through to the kitchen disappearing from John's view.
“Fine.”
“No.”
John took a long look at his friend in curiosity. He had seen Sherlock notice the sign, the one which said ‘family.’ This made John very happy but he didn’t understand Sherlock sometimes. He just couldn’t.
"Here we are then."
"We look like..."
“We can take him to school.”
Isn’t that a rather personal question. We only met two days ago. if you can call that ‘meeting.’
"Oh... Well so are you just going to keep him in your dorm room? I'm amazed you managed to get the school to give you permission t-"
John and Sherlock had gone to the nearest forest just outside of London for the morning, to take some pictures of John, supposedly at his 'camp.' John posed in front of a tree with some rope tied around his middle and his hand on the tree, perhaps just come down from climbing it. He stood with a grin next to a fire he had built, proudly holding up a match. Him and Sherlock found a small stream, and John waded into it, his trousers rolled up past his knees, and Sherlock snapped a series of shots of him 'looking for water creatures.' The pair managed to commandeer a bow and arrow from a hut they found and took some pictures of John on his 'archery training,' as well as some by the 'weapons centre.'
"No!"
Haha well for starters I don't know many and then they all seem to find me nice, but as a friend. :(
“Well- No. I guess n-”
"Yes Sherlock. Felix will love it and so will John. When are you giving it?"
“Since it’s a Saturday, we have all day to do something awesome. John it’s your day, what do you want to do?”
“There is a slot for a mother and one for a father... what do we do with that?”
“Hang on wait- How-?” but the man was gone already. John looked at the pile of boxes now at his feet.
“Sherlock!”
“Oh come on Johnny, you know i’m just winding you up, it’s what sisters do!” She exclaimed, lolling back onto the sofa so she was lying fully on it, “We simply have to be annoying, that’s our job.” She winked at John as he handed her a cup of tea.
“Oh, but I thought that if even idiots like me can take care of children so, of course the great Sherlock Holmes can!”
"Is it... is it okay?" He asked hesitantly.
"Ooh Sherlock... Is that your 'friend'?"
“See you guys in a minute then, I’ll meet you by the door. Both of you. Get changed.”
Just to say: The piece of music mentioned at the end I absolutely love! this is the version I listened to whilst writing this chapter (Just ignore the piano ;) ) and the violin is how I imagined it being played in the story :)
“Mycroft. I’m keeping him.” he said indignantly without looking up at his brother.
John smiled into the camera, whilst Sherlock took a very wonky looking picture. The pair were out taking mock pictures for John's 'DofE adventure camp' that he supposedly had been at for the entire summer. He was going to visit his parents later on that day, and he had to give them convincing tales of his 'summer away' so they wouldn't suspect anything, which unfortunately included pictures of him.
"John do you like the baby?"
"Fine."
She picked up the present and turned it upside-down, and then covered it with the tissue paper, putting a quick piece of tape here and there to hold it together, then she opened up the sheet of wallpaper, and keeping the present upside-down, she quickly folded in each of the flaps, neatly into the sides and stuck down each folded triangle with a small piece of tape, before flipping the present the right way around and holding it up to Sherlock. His eyes were wide in amazement, as he took it from her, looking over the neatly folded paper and then back at Molly, then at the present again, not understanding the process which had just happened in front of him.
"So...?" Harry asked, once John was seated, turning and giving him her full attention.
Obviously.
"Well we have been um, looking after, um." He looked at Harry and then knew he didn't want to lie at all to her, so he just said it how it was.
"Sherlock. Why this month? Like why are you giving a gift now to Felix?"
"Pardon?" He asked incredulously.
what?
Do you know someone named Gregory Lestrade?
I never did this as a child.
Hello John.
A Consulting Detective.
“Well-”
“That was lovely. What was that?” He smiled softly.
"No. He's our son." Sherlock declared, looking her straight in the eye.
He also felt sure now, upon deciding, that this was the right name. Sherlock was happy too, John thought, glancing at him standing next to him. He somehow had got his own way, with the child being named after two composers. John thought that the matter of the surname was strange, he felt that it was bizarre them putting down a double barrelled name, which is usually a mix of the two parents... but somehow it felt and sounded right despite their odd situation.
“Sherlock. You better help me with the baby.”
"So?"
"Mum, I said before. I have to go to my friend's so I can get a lift back to school tomorrow. I dropped most of my stuff back at his house on the way here. I have to go there. It's all arranged."
After the match Sherlock walked back to his dorm room with a sombre and moody attitude. He relieved Molly from looking after Felix and let her go back to her dorm without him saying a huge amount about what had occurred on the hockey pitch, just a couple of indistinguishable moody grunts.
"No, he might. What would we do then?"
“Mmm?”
“John, I didn’t mean yo- that- John!” Sherlock jumped up and grabbed his arm as he walked away.
"Yeah, the thing you've been doing this summer."
“Sher- Oh for-” John stammered as Sherlock bolted towards the trees.
"You're being modest, I can see it. You're a fast runner."
1st February
Sherlock looked at it and an odd expression came over his face, similar to the one he was wearing in the photo. He looked what John thought to be a mixture between happy and taken aback.
Mycroft continued speaking to John, only acknowledging Sherlock's comment with a slight smirk in the corner of his mouth.
The house was extremely neat, and everything seemed to have its place somewhere, despite there not being a large excess of stuff, and the things not of excellent quality or high cost, and everything having a misshapen feel to it. He came through into the lounge where his father was sitting on his armchair, looking like he hadn't moved in a week. He didn't turn his head when John entered, but kept flicking through the TV channels with the remote in his hand.
"Not an experiment!"
“What colour hair does he have?”
"Okay." He breathed out, not knowing why he was so nervous. "This is going to seem pretty strange. But... Well, Sherlock and I.... Sherlock and I... have... Um-"
“Is it dark, I pictured him with dark hair”
"Well I am at a loss! I have no idea how we can manage to take our A-levels, with us also taking care of a child! I mean what are we going to do? We can't actually take him to school and just leave him in our dorm room Sherlock!"
“So back to the first name.”
"How would you feel about this sudden.... How shall we put it....'fatherhood' John?"
"Yes. Okay Dad. I will."
"Well um, I am, have..-"
"Three, I believe."
The next day John had sent Sherlock out to the shops to buy anything that they needed for the baby, who still had no name. He felt unsure about sending Sherlock out alone, but they couldn’t have taken the baby into a busy shopping centre, and actually managed to get some shopping done without a pram, and they desperately needed some essential items for the baby.
"No."
Wow!! What for?? :O
"Never mind you 'might'. You will."
“Yeah that-”
"Well, yeah he does, but um, no relation unbelievably!" John quipped, grinning at Molly's reaction to Felix.
“No. But he likes it anyway... Peek-a-boo!”
“Well, they think that- that... well... we are together." He said, looking cautiously up at Sherlock.
“What? Tell me.”
So Sherlock sat and waited for John to return, mulling over in his brain what had happened. He was going to confront John, that was for certain. Although as Sherlock thought about it, he didn't quite know what he would confront him about... Of course he realised he felt jealous towards the other players and that the hockey players now took up all of John's time, but Sherlock couldn't understand why he had felt so jealous. After much deliberating and questioning himself, the genius concluded there was no need to confront John as from as far as he could see, there was nothing to say to him on the matter. Instead Sherlock would just repress whatever he had been feeling earlier on that day.
“Oh dear. I should have arrived earlier.”
"You heard me. I'm not saying it again." Sherlock replied, trying to refrain from smiling.
"In my room. He, fell asleep on my bed so I just left him."
"Fine. How about Albert?"
"Sorry, I just, him as a father... Sorry. So um How long have you had him for? The um, child I mean."
"I'm Cecilia Ophelia Rosalind Brown" She announced, "My parents were sorta into Shakespeare"  She said smiling at Felix and tickling him some more. "Can I come with Felix to the next house?" She suddenly interjected, bouncing up and down with excitement.
"You're not allowed to play hockey anymore."
Sherlock made a sound of annoyance. “But I quite liked Nick.”
"So what do we know about the child Mycroft?" John asked, a little windswept by the rapid decision that had just been made.
"A John cup of tea??"
"You have an obligation to me and to Felix. You're not allowed."
Sherlock looked down in amazement at the hand, and then at John’s face staring at his own hand, as if he was shocked that he himself had indeed just placed it there.
“Um, Sherlock?”
This year there were even more good players, meaning that John was even further down in the pool of people for the coach to choose from.
Mycroft walked up the stairs, his shoes making sharp tapping sounds. His dark suit was impeccable as usual, and his hair was styled into his customary precise and faultless look. As he entered the room, he spotted Sherlock lying on the floor with the baby, and he looked down in distain.
His face was a mixture of annoyance and curiosity, with his eyebrows lifted slightly and one corner of his mouth turned down.
He was cut off in surprise by John pulling him into a strong hug. His arms firmly and lovingly clasped around this wonderful and amazing boy. Sherlock felt his heart flutter as his face relaxed and he felt his friend's warm arms around him. He touched the soft downy fabric of the back of John's jumper, running his fingertips across it as he breathed in the smell of John.
"Where's Felix-"
"Don't we know anyone who could do it?" John continued. "Hang on... What about a friend? Someone at school who takes different subjects to us? Couldn't they look after him?"
He took a step back away from her, his eyes fixed on Sherlock, his eyebrows creased into a worried frown as he took a step towards his friend. Sherlock flinched at this and reacting by taking a step away from John as if he didn't want him to come any closer to him.
"No problem, see you then." She replied as she went out of the door.
“Well yes. I can believe it. He is clearly an advanced child for his age and it was inevitable that he would be able to identify the two most important people in his life before long.”
Huh, well I still think it's pretty cool :)
"Sherlock!" John called sharply into the other room. A few seconds later, Sherlock walked in carrying Felix proudly.
There was a moment of pause.
“It’s alright Sherlock, it is quite a scary slide.” John joined in, understanding the game his sister was playing.
Sherlock opened his eyes and clocked two or maybe three Johns standing in front of him, he lurched to his feet, the room spinning around him.
"Yeah, aren't they cute!" He cooed smiling, and eyeing up the little pastel animal figures.
John’s face dropped as he stared in shock at this little boy. Sherlock too had been stopped in his tracks by the first word his son had ever said. The corner of John’s mouth was the first part of his face to change from shock into absolute glee. His eyebrows then followed and twitched into a lifted position. His eyes then filled with tears, he was that happy. He didn't think he'd ever cried from happiness before, but John had a feeling that this would not be the last time he did so in this journey they were going on with this dear little boy who was theirs and all theirs.
"I'm...just going to...work somewhere quieter." I mumbled, looking everywhere but at Sherlock, before hurriedly escaping out of the door.
"Who is which?"
"I do."
“Well that’s just-”
Sherlock looked practically wounded, "of course it is John! The Whitechapel murders were a prominent series of murders and I thin-"
Real Life? Is this pretend life then?
Everything seemed very still, as if nothing was moving except for the gentle lapping of the water around their waists. The sounds of the children playing, the splashing of water, the rides, it all seemed so far away. So distant.
They wandered around the shop for a bit, and John found some story books, in which the baby could touch different fabrics as the story went on. John tried to read a little to Felix, but no more than two sentences into it, Sherlock had whisked it out of his hands.
Sherlock started to pace up and down beside one of the lab benches, his hands pressed to his head and his face screwed up in frustration and uncertainty as to what to do. Molly noted his behaviour, and putting Felix down, she got up and went over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder, he too wrapped up in his own thoughts to notice her.
"A child, yes." He looked her straight in the eyes.
Nope I guess not ;) what did you do to entertain the six year old you then?? :)
Haha well enjoy your macabre interpretation of the holiday then!! :)
"Hang on, what time does the match start?"
Sherlock nodded, and the pair headed over to the door, standing behind a group of small children all dressed up and pointing out to Felix the pumpkin and all the decorations, to which he made small delighted gurglings at.
“Hello” John said smiling, wary of whether or not it had been appropriate to smile at someone else’s child. “I’m sorry, your baby is very cute!” He said.
I could pass you in the street and not know it's you...
As they walked over a small hill, John could see the school building just encroaching into their sight, and once they had crossed over the small stream, via the precarious wooden bridge which lay over it, they ended up on the far side of the school grounds.
As the train travelled cross-country John looked out of the window at the already turning brown with the Autumn English countryside which was whizzing past them. Felix sitting on John's lap had his little hand on the window and was staring out with his eyes round and darting about at all the interesting things which were going by. Looking over at Sherlock, John smiled because his friend had fallen asleep and had his head lolled back onto John's shoulder, with his mouth pursed shut and his knees pulled up to his chest, and John thought that he looked just like a little animal curled up next to him. John relaxed and looked over his friend's familiar face and how much like a child he looked when he was asleep, his hair around his face in an unruly mass, curls falling over his peaceful face. One in particular was over his eye and although they were all messy, seemed to be out of place to all of the others, John instinctively leaned over and gently picked it up and moved it out of his eyes, holding the curl that second too long before letting it bounce back into place.
Suddenly, both of them realised how close they were between the plastic ferns. They had had to move closer so they could see each other through the leaves, and were now in a pocket of space between them, each plastic decoration on either side forcing them to stand close. But they were very close now.
"Sherloc-" I began, but was interrupted by his further engagement in this childish behaviour.
They walked behind the small girl who was now carrying Felix and talking at a rate of knots to him as she walked excitedly to house after house, helping him collect his sweets.
“I’m sure it’s an absolute blast, I love kids, wouldn’t want one myself yet, not responsible enough”
Who?? :)
"Are you home yet?"
“You don’t. We don’t need to do what everyone else does!”
"Yes of course I will but where-"
John's group had been in there for the last forty minutes, and during this time, Sherlock had been standing nearby, gearing up the courage to enter. He felt scared, not for fear of rejection due to his age, as even putting the lax rules aside, he was tall and looked far older than he was. No, he was more scared of John... What he was going to say to him. This type of rejection sent a fierce chill down his spine. What if John didn't want to be his friend any more? How would he cope? What would happen to Felix? Sherlock paced, his head reeling in these thoughts, his mind uneasy with sentiment.
"Okay, if you're sure?"
“Nobody plans on it until BOOM, there’s a brilliant shirt for your boyfriend and you can’t get it cause you don’t know what size he is. Quelle dommage!”
"Tea?" Sherlock asked, holding up a steaming mug for John, which he hadn't noticed had been sitting on the table.
The more that he thought about it the more he realised he wanted to go out. He needed to. Sending a text to Greg he discovered the boys hadn't left yet, feeling relieved he paced over towards the front school gate, before standing in the shadows waiting.
“Why- Why are you walking so slowly?” He called back to him.
“Like diving, skinny boys are good at that.”
“Well-”
Doctor John. Interesting I would have thought because you excel in sports you would have chosen that line of work.
"Ah yes, I do. She's the one-"
"Yes." Sherlock replied, his eyes creased in worry at his friend's reaction. As soon as John opened his eyes he saw this and went to reassure him that they were happy tears, but his friend cut in first.
“It is not a first name.”
"This is mine."
Statistically.
"You looking forward to this?" Greg asked.
John started to relax, they were on their way back to their own dorm with Felix, and they were coming closer to their own room. John felt relived that at least they hadn't been caught this time with Felix. But as they turned into their corridor to their horror, Oliver from next door was just coming out of his room. John's eyes widened slightly and his heart started thudding, afraid of being caught, Sherlock also hastened his pace, but Oliver noticed them and with a beaming grin, turned to face them.
"What?"
“No. I’m sure the child won’t bother me. ‘Parenting.’ It can’t be that hard, most of you idiots in this world do it.”
Sherlock just grinned knowing he could quite easily overrule John if he wanted to, and moved to the next aisle, whisking the pram from John's hands and pushing it in front of him, John followed hurriedly behind.
“What?” John exclaimed disbelieving “Sherlock, what do you mean? We are 16! What do you mean we are keeping him?!”
“Felix Tobias Holmes”
"Sherlock, come on... You know we couldn't really!" He said, breaking slightly under Sherlock's emotional blackmail, He turned to Mycroft. "We couldn’t, could we?"
"No, Ion."
"For what?"
“No.”
“Ah well John, if Sherlock is too scared to try it…” Harry piped up.
John picked up his book and hauled himself up before walking through to the kitchen.
After an hour of lazily drinking tea, whilst Felix slept, John set off for his parents house, armed with his pile of photographs, a mournful attitude, and a slightly tanned looking face... from the fake tan which Sherlock had just managed to persuade John was a 'good idea' to use on his face and arms.
"Yes. Of course I can. I'm not an idiot!" Sherlock retorted, continuing to glare at Mycroft, who half closed his eyes, let out a big sigh, and then turned to John.
The girl looked at Sherlock with an angry expression, her arms crossed and tapping one foot, as he whirled around wildly, looking for Molly.
“What?”
"I shall go ring Molly then."
“HARRY FUC-”
When John came in a few minutes later, he caught one glimpse of this loving scene, before Sherlock snapped out of it, and got up. John smiled, knowing that despite Sherlock's recent efforts for him not to see, Sherlock really thought highly of the child, and was terribly and uncharacteristically fond of the little boy.
"Th- Thankyou Molly." He stuttered, his eyebrows furrowing in confusion.
“Oh, okay. Good.” John said. The whole thing still feeling to him, like a very... unique situation.
"Well what do you suggest then? This is what babies wear!"
"Well.... Why not?" John replied utterly confused.
"Sherlock. I thought you were getting socks! What are they?" He asked pointing to the basket.
"Well okay I guess we could... What about matron?"
“Sherlock, we came all this way. You have to have a go on the Slide of Death.” John cried, jiggling Felix about in his arms who looked adorable in his little baby trunks and when he was in the water he had been in this kind of floating seat, so he could splash about to his little heart’s desire.
It doesn’t feel right without them though!! :)
"I'm O-"
"A family. We look like a family." Sherlock whispered, raising his head to look at John, who could see that his bright blue eyes were shining with happiness.
"We are not giving him back though. No matter how tough it gets... right?" John quavered, his voice lingering in suspense for the answer.
"Mmhm, of course you don't..."
"Joh-"
"Lots of jumpers you've got there! ...Sherlock I'm guessing?" He questioned, pointing towards them and going too close to them for Sherlock's liking.
"I just didn't. I have much more suitable clothes for him to wear." He assured, plucking out of his basket with his long, elegant fingers; a small, dark, well made suit and little shirt on a tiny hanger.
"No."
Sherlock??? :?
“A… race?”
Yes, probably.
"I can't decide, do we take the winter uniform or not? I can't remember and Felix isn't being very helpful."
"As in Bunsen Burner? Not a chance. What about Jack?"
"Yeah, I guess I mig-"
"Yes." Sherlock said decisively.
He turned to John who sucked in a breath, his eyes glazed in shock. He looked down at the child in John’s arms, who was looking up at the two with wide eyes and a small mouth curved into small ‘o’ shape. John gritted his teeth, feeling dizzy and overwhelmed.
Aha! So is that what you want to do when you're older?? ;)
John signed on the line.
"You, you really think that?" He asked, remaining hesitant.
Whyyy?
Simply Deduction.
so no winky faces then?? ;)
omg did you just send a smiley face!! :O
“Also a husband, want one of those too, big fella with strong arms y’know.”
“Be crawling?”
"I don't know. You can't leave it all to me you know!"
So you have a boyfriend? :)
"Well we were given him, and now we have gotten attached and um, well he's so lovely and the most beautiful baby ever, and um we just couldn't give him to the authorities and he, he-his name is Felix." John blurted, letting it all out.
John looking panicked, was handed the child from the man, and took a step backwards to stand next to Sherlock who had risen from the floor on hearing what the man had said. Together they watched him run towards the cluster of trees.
"Yes, back to the point. I don't know. John's been- away a lot recently, I thought, it'd be... nice"
'I-I thought it would be nice... I missed the 6 months, which according to the internet, is the bigger month, which is absurd as its just because it is half of a year."
"She could look after him for us just as a favour for the start of term, that will give us some more time to think of something permanent."
What you doing now??? ;)
John sighed and put his hand back to his head. "Sherlock, are you really going to approve of any of the nannies we ask with that attitude? I mean do they really have to be, I don't know, 'Marie Curie' before they are fit to take care of him?"
"No! We are not calling him after the gas which comes from the Greek word for lazy! Or any other scientific appliance or element for that matter!"
“This is jus-”
"I should probably go now" She said sadly, scuffing her shoe against a curb. "Bye Felix! Bye bye Felix's Daddies!" She gave a wave and then skipped around the corner getting lost in the dark within seconds.
The leaves were starting to turn orange and fall off the trees, and soon they would completely litter the hockey pitch. For now though, the odd leaf drifted across over the edge of the railings and onto the players on the court, and got swept into their fast moving game, crunched underfoot as the teenagers charged towards the goals at either end of the pitch.
No not really my area.
Sherlock's mouth began to twitch into a smile as they abandoned the pram and carried Felix down the street with them, watching all the other children go from house to house.
He breathed in the lovely smell of morning dew with an icy edge to it, along with the smell of the trees and the wood which surrounded them.
"No. We are not naming him Barium." He said exasperated, throwing up his hands.
"How?"
"You have to bring home an imaginary girl?" Sherlock said, the corner of his mouth now toying with a smile.
"What! But we need permission to-"
"Good! Right I shall call her and ask her... Wait, how about I invite her around? We could introduce her to Felix? And then ask her then?"
“Yes, Johann Sebastian Bach. Or his student, Johann Tobias Krebs.”
Ewww!! Frog brains!!! Why??!!
“I’m sure people do- Fine. A middle name then?”
Sherlock’s facial expression flickered from confusion to back to neutral so fast but John thought he could see a glimpse of hurt on his friend’s face. This was like a pang in his heart, he suddenly felt terrible, he hadn’t have thought that Sherlock might have wanted to know his birthday, he had assumed he wouldn’t be interested in something so trivial.
No girlfriend then?? ;)
"It doesn't- I don't- I shall work that part out later."
Sherlock looked at her in distain and then at John's embarrassed, and crestfallen face.
"They will have to." Sherlock declared, pursing his lips together in a tight line.
“Okay,”
"You do exactly what you want to Sherlock."
John looked at Sherlock.
However this plan of John’s, which had worked so well throughout his school life so far, was about to be scuppered. Completely scuppered by the knock on the door.
“No we can’t!”
"I... I am unsure." Sherlock mused, slowly putting Felix onto the floor, where he crawled over to the small xylophone he had in the corner, and started to bang it with the tiny sticks provided.
John looked to Sherlock in mock distain, knowing full well that he was, despite everything, loving having Felix around. Well, most of the time...And as if talking about him had woken him up, that moment a loud wail arose from the other room, and the pair sighed and wearily lifted themselves off of the sofa.
"Sherlock!" John exclaimed incredulous.
"Your Daddy is going to have to get his own cup of tea if he wants one." I said in the most sickly sweet voice I could manage, before looking up at Sherlock's face. "Because I am not going to make him one."
Oh, right :).....well what about me?? :P
"Well, I though you were more of a Dad. Or... Daddy or whatever...?"
“Well we can’t give him back.”
That makes no sense, the english language has survived without these sideways faces for many many years up until the invention of the computer and text.
“I am NOT scared!”
Sherlock started striding towards the park’s exit and towards his flat, John followed behind holding the baby. Sherlock dialed in a number as they walked.
"I don't! Fine I shall find a nanny myself." He defiantly declared.
"How d- he's a baby!"
They wandered over to the Mothercare shop, John marveling at the many uses for the pram as he started hanging all of their shopping bags onto the handles. As they entered they gazed around them at the quiet shop, which had soft music playing in the background, and heavily pregnant ladies wandering around everywhere on the soft carpeted floor. Feeling slightly out of place with all of the hormonal although currently serene women, John pulled Sherlock over to the toy section. Sherlock looked around the shelves and recoiled in horror.
"Yes I can."
"No. Ion?"
Technically. Although now I have proven, and prevented a number of their crimes, they tend to let me off without questioning me.
"Oh for god's sake! I am going to call up Mycroft!"
"So, what's your running?"
"In girls? Aha!" He started a hearty, derisive laugh. "Of course you are. Just need to go for it John. She's not going to wait forever. Girls need to be asked out."
Sherlock went to sit in his chair and picked up his phone and started texting. John looked at him narrowing his eyes.
Okayyys I wilel goo hommee!!
"You mean everything?"
In front of of them was a heavily pregnant lady, with a toddler on one hip, who looked at the pair strangely as they joined the queue, and kept turning her head back to glance at them, Felix especially. This, John tried to ignore. When the woman was about to leave, John gave a smile to the toddler who had turned around to look at him, John's smile the woman noticed and obviously took as some sort of unspoken attack on her child, and she briskly moved the child's head to face away from him, and walked off protectively cradling her child to her body. John felt hurt by her unjust judgement but he tried to brush it off. Once they got to the front desk, the lady behind the counter started to make conversation as she scanned their items.
"Hello."
“John? But Joh- You can’t actually leave him!”
"No. It doesn't matter."
Experimented.
"Why not?"
"Fine. We won't ask the school. For now!" responded John, annoyed with his friend an drawing his mouth into a thin line.
"Look after him when we can't during lessons?" John finished off.
"Oh so now I'm doing everything you want then? ...Actually that's not too different to normal."
“Of course i’ve noticed John. I’m not an idiot.”
They sent a different DI. He wasn't familiar with my work, and so they just threw me off the crime scene.
“They are all giving us weird looks, like we are freaks!”
"I know."
“We can! I want to keep it because it has genius potential and how often does a child show that! I know what will happen! Mycroft will take it away, and give it to some mundane, stupid family who will just fill its head with all sorts of nonsense, and it will turn out like every other idiot on this planet!”
"I was making a joke. Stupid attempt. Come home please. I can't decide what we are taking."
“I do help.”
"So, one of us needs to go collect the dorm key from matron." John stated, knowing they would be in the same dorm from sending the school their pairs request email during the holidays, confirming the shared dorm.
Really.... Have you been looking me up? :) Are you stalking me??? ;)
Why then did he feel so strange when John had called the pair of them that? Of course they were Felix's parents and therefore his father. So... fathers. Felix's fathers. His dads? They must be. It made sense in all of the logical ways he was pondering in his mind, but what didn't make sense to him was that strange new emotion he had felt. Something new which he couldn't put his finger on. He looked across again at John's face and suddenly didn't want this heavy atmosphere that now he could feel surrounded them to continue. So he went back to the sofa and sat back down, John's eyes following him as he did so. He took in a sharp breath and met John's anxious gaze. He then said what he had worked out to be the easiest way to relieve the tense look on John's face, which was making him scrunch up his features, in a way which made Sherlock wish to stop John's upset.
well i guess its kinda like the smileys then ;)
“Tea?-”
John opened it and there stood Harry. His sister.
Doctor Watson does have a nice ring to it :P and I have given up being surprised at how you know stuff :) I am captain of my rugby team so I am good at it but I guess I have just always preferred medicine to sports gotta know how to heal the injuries you make!! ;)
“Mendelssohn.”
"I cannot speed up the tube Sherlock!"
"This way." Said Sherlock, his eyes on the group he was following. The proceeded to follow them down a series of streets and routes, on roads John didn't even know existed, until they arrived on the most amazing looking street John had seen that evening.
“This is a real problem then Johnny, how you ever gonna buy him a shirt if you don’t know his neck measurements?”
"You could If you wanted to."
Sherlock felt overwhelming pride towards his son and felt the hint of tears beginning to prick the corners of his eyes, but he fought them away.
John positioned himself on the starting line. He always loved this, the feeling of just about to start something, the suspense building in his chest as he waited to go. He breathed in and ran, feeling the drizzly rain brush over his face as he did so, refreshing and spurring him on. The next time he ran he tried to time himself on his watch, but it was difficult to get it accurate as he was trying to stop it just as he went over the line, but his running prevented it from being exactly the time he crossed it, so he gave up trying to time himself after several attempts. He hadn't run since the end of last term, and it was a good feeling, to just feel the cold air around him seemingly turning warmer, as his body temperature rose the more he ran. As well as that rush of adrenaline as he built up speed.
“Wakey wakey birthday boy!” She yelled, loud enough to awaken the whole floor.
"Seeing who has the dorms assigned to around us. Useful information."
“Okay.” John looked up at Sherlock who had got up, and gone over to the baby’s cot. He stood up to join him, and they both looked down on the baby, Sherlock even showing faint hints of fondness on his face.
I knew that I had to speak to him as if he was actually a child and just to ride his temperament out, and so I said what I would if I had been talking to a five year old.
Can't talk now. My brother is glaring at me for texting, and I need his help accessing police files for a murder inquiry.
Maybe you should go home John.
"Here i'll take that" He said, going to take the bucket from John's hand. His fingers brushed John's and sent a thrill up his spine, like electricity as they touched, John clearly felt it too and looked up at Sherlock, his eye's wide and questioning. Uncertain as to everything.
I merely corrected the teacher.
“Well I would say that Nicholas is the more common elongation.” John laughed, bemused.
"What?"
"No! I don't rely on Mycroft!" Sherlock replied, backtracking rapidly.
"Just over a month now." He answered, smiling at just simply the thought of Felix.
"Okay, I will be back in a minute then." He said handing over the baby to Sherlock, who held him close to his chest and quickly walked to the little orchard which was beside the school.
“Wait, what-”
“Harry-”
Good joke ;)
"I taught him that."
"John! What on earth has happened to your arms?"
He handed the small pair over, and John set about putting them on Felix.
"But, what? How? I mean, we couldn’t, could we? We have school! We're 16 for Christ's sake!"
"You wanna try?" John asked, indicating an inviting looking house which a group of children was about to go to.
“I really would rather not. Anyway, Sherlock just doesn’t do swimming and Felix can’t swim either and we might be seen from school by someone an-“
Wow, but wont the police wonder why you were there in the first place??? ;)
"Yeah, we do." John replied, smiling softly back at him, and then looking again down at the photograph.
Thankyou to all you amazing people who are commenting and reading this story! Love you guys! Here's another chapter for you! :) Enjoy!
"What did she say?"
"Oh yeah I'm kind of living here now... It's all, I shall explain." John stuttered, his smile faltering slightly.
I was looking for her.
"Good, well tr-"
"Yes Sherlock, bu-"
John handed over his watch and went to the starting line and got into position. He felt an overwhelming need to impress Greg, and this meant he felt all of a sudden shaky. He took in a few deep breaths to calm himself, and waited until Greg yelled 'Go!', before releasing his nerves and sprinting. After he had passed over the finish line, Greg started jumping around looking down at the watch.
“Oh, he can be a rascal though!” The man smiled back, reassuring John.
He looked over at her with narrowed eyes, and then down at the paper again, before moodily crossing his arms and staring at the still unwrapped present.
"Thanks" He said smiling at the lady.
Yeah...but I mean a good weird :)
Sherlock's face dropped. I realised I'd been slightly too harsh on him. I didn't want to fall out over something so trivial.
"Oh! I just thought...with the moving in together... And the...um sorry, okay go on." Molly went very red and bowed her head, embarrassed by her assumptions.
“It’s awesome, I started labelling all the things in the kitchen cupboards, but then Mama dearest told me it was ‘horrible’ and that ‘we are capable of working out what a spoon is without a label.’”
“Really? You do?”
“Well it- It sh-...” Sherlock trailed off, realising that he didn't know the answer. When John stayed over at the flat, he always stayed in what had now become his room. Sherlock of course had his own bedroom, and there was the lounge the kitchen and the bathroom. But that was it.
"John?" I heard him say. His voice shocked me still, rooting me to the ground, like I didn't expect to hear it. I turned around and met his eyes, but I couldn't hold the gaze.
You... :P get you to maybe relax a bit when talking to people!
“Harry-”
"My thoughts exactly." Sherlock murmured distractedly, looking out of their window down to the pathway outside. He then pulled out his phone and started texting. John looked briefly towards the window before turning back to Felix.
“Shush you, I know you're happy underneath all of that, I saw your face when he said it.”
Sherlock stuck out his bottom lip in defiance.
They ending up exiting the shop, with all of Sherlock's suits, and only some of the things which John wanted to buy, (and what the baby actually needed,) all of which subsequently were plain, with not an animal picture in sight.
Coolio? I assume it is a "john way" of saying the word cool?
“We ring Mycroft. Come on.”
"There is more to it than that!"
"Yepp. We do."
"Yes of course."
Sherlock’s mouth closed around his and they kissed with such passion, Sherlock cupping John’s face in his hands, and John’s arms twined around his neck, both of them feeling at last that this was exactly what they had been waiting for. It almost felt, as though they were coming home.
What?
Later on, once it was dark, the three of them wrapped up as warm as they could and plonked Felix into his pushchair and went out onto the street. London was funny about trick or treating, most people (especially in central London) were very against the idea, and nearly every window contained an angry sign telling trick or treaters to go away. Sherlock glanced over at John as they walked down street after street of dark, uninviting looking houses, his friend looked downtrodden, Sherlock couldn't bear it. He looked around him, observing the street, observing the other people and his eye caught the very corner of what looked to be a child's costume walking the other way on the opposite side of the street. His ears picked up the sound of laughter, the giggling of children and the commanding tone of a parent. He whirled the pram around and grabbed hold of John.
"Well. I did come."
Harry just stood looking at the pair of them incredulous, holding a cup of tea for her and one for Sherlock.
"Do you have any ideas?"
"Anyway, look I printed out another as well, I really like this photo." He praised, handing it over.
there you go! I don’t even know you and we’re abusing punctuation together already! ;)
Greg nodded back and they started out towards the field together.
“-And that chair”
"So what Dad?"
Isn't that just making you a suspect???
“Well I guess-”
“Short for Nickel?”
30th January
“Any chance of some more Tea Johnny?”
“Johann.”
yeah i did! why are you there??? How did you find her!!
“Harry? What on earth are you doing here?” John exclaimed his voice wavered as he knew the answer.
Liiiike??...
Do you actually have any friends??? :?
John wafted the air around his head to try clear some of the steam, giving a slight cough as he did so.
"I am not acting like a child." He said stonily, continuing with their staring game.
"Okay thanks, we will do that." John said, trying to be friendly and smiling, refusing to partake in the sibling rivalry.
"Nursery."
Harry swung her bag over her shoulder.
Hey all! I really would love for more people to be reading my story! The numbers seem to have decreased a tad :( so If you can recommend it to friends though it would be brilliant :) Thankyou for those reading this now! i would so so love to hear from you! please leave a comment if you liked it or didnt!
Just then, the doorbell rang. John looked toward the door and then back to Sherlock who was unmoving. He grunted and then went to answer it, mumbling about how Sherlock doesn’t even answer the door in his own flat. At the door was a delivery man with several large cardboard boxes and a form and pen.
"Oh yeah, um fine," John mumbled, feeling bad about lying to her.
"Sherlock?" John tentatively approached, looking over his obviously drunk friend through his newly sober eyes.
"He will grow quickly, this is a suit for each growth up to the age of 3."
"No it is good, I like having time to myself! And she's got a provisional art scholarship too, so she needs to work hard now." Molly finished, trying to convince herself, just as they arrived at the bottom of the staircase up to John's dorm.
"Bu- Oh. -Do you like me?"
Sherlock stuck his head comically around the kitchen door with Felix in his arms. John gestured for them to come over to where he was sitting at the table.
They looked up at each other.
“Because we are 16 and we have a baby!”
"How did you?-"
"We've adopted a child."
"Four." Mycroft and Sherlock said simultaneously without breaking their gaze with one another.
"No."
"Clearly I'm not! :) "
The second Sherlock lifted the lid, the beautiful notes of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor rang out in dainty tones across the room. It brought a tear to John's eyes as he heard the docile tones and he rapidly shut his eyes as an attempt to stop a flood as the music washed over him.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment before nodding slightly. There was a brief moment of pause before Sherlock turned and retrieved the package from where John had placed it earlier.
John put the baby down on the floor and started to head out of the door, talking over his shoulder.
I am uncertain about how to answer that request.
“That would mean Mycroft would win.”
“I wouldn’t-”
"Then what is the problem?"
After a while, the baby became bored with the game and started to cry. Sherlock made a look of horror.
Well I guess we must live pretty close then... :)
And invention of my own ;) not like you're not guilty of that :P anyway I thought you couldn't talk?
He has sent me out of the room.
Can we be friends then??? :)
They carried on walking, and it's not that the people stopped staring, on the contrary, but at every disapproving face John just looked at Sherlock and at Felix, and as they made their way through the people, he started to slowly not care whether anyone else didn’t like it. Or what they might be thinking. He didn't want to make them happy. It was none of their business. He was was happy. That was all that mattered.
"Yes. I believe I could allow Felix to call me that... Yes."
The day of Halloween fell within the half term for the school, so the students were allowed to return home for the week if they wished. John had wanted therefore, to do something memorable with Sherlock and Felix, and he was sure that Felix would love this holiday especially the part where he got to dress up. John already had so many ideas for a costume for him, and the thought of creating it was making him very excited.
“Harry, you know it’s just any other day like the rest of the-”
"Hang on? What are you going to do with him once we go back to school?"
Hey here is another chapter hope you like it it please comment if you do!!! :)
"TRICK OR TREAT!" The children yelled, joined in by John too at the back of the crowd, as the door opened to the house. A kind looking woman with greying hair opened the door holding a big bowl of sweets in her hands.
After three trips, John had got the boxes up the stairs. Sherlock- only moving to flick his page, did nothing to help. Once finished, John found a knife and then slit open the top box. Inside, it was full of nappies. The second and third contained various other baby things, such as bottles and toys and then the fourth box, which was long and thin, contained a flat pack baby cot. John sighed a sigh of relief. At least Mycroft was much more sensible than his brother. He turned to the useless one in the corner.
“Yes. Felix.” Sherlock said, trying out the name.
“Johnny boy! How you doing my bro!” She yelled out, dropping her duffle bag and pulling him into a big bear hug.
"You've taken the train to school before though Sherlock? I mean- haven't you?"
“That is a completely illogical game. Even the baby isn’t so stupid to not realise that you haven’t disappeared.”
"Where are you going?" John asked, turning his head around to the door.
What challenge?
Well yeah but i can’t help it ;) feels like i’m being rude if i don't put one! :P
John realised once he had looked in the mirror at the appalling looking 'tan' on his face, that it had been an appalling idea in the first place, that Sherlock knew nothing of what he was talking about, and so John had tried to wash his face to get it off, but a considerable amount wouldn't come off, and had tinged his skin a sort of dirty brown, which John hoped to look convincing enough to be a real tan, but wasn't really sure if he could rely on Sherlock's hurried affirmations and nodding that it did as he walked out the door.
“He looks in that picture, I can sorta see, he looks handsome”
Process of elimination. Poison in the chocolates.
“Bet hubby gave you that lamp”
"Oh, is she here yet?"
I am almost certain one will. It is valentines day.
“We can manage.”
"Where is he now?"
John I would strongly advise you to go home.
"What? What do you mean you have 'obtained' a child? ...You kidnapped a child!" Her eyes widened in horror.
Found the missing diamond. It was the sister who took it.
He smiled at this thought, the idea was pleasing to him and he felt as though it could work.
"No. I do my part. I do more than my part, you've no right to tell me what to do."
Sherlock sat and thought about what to do about wrapping the present, the idea stressing him out more than any schoolwork had that year. He suddenly picked up his phone, deciding he needed advice on the matter and called up Molly.
“Mmm?”
"Harriet. Language." Her mother interjected curtly.
"Okay, I did. I was right about what?"
"Sherlock!" I said raising my voice. "Shhh, I can hear Felix from out there!" I hissed, gesturing towards the door, merely paranoid of being caught out with a baby in school.
“Stop making excuses John. You three are all coming with me, in my car and we are going to WaterLand whether you like it or not. And you will have a different attitude by the time we get back.”
"Change what?"
"Okay, but you mustn't let anyone see him Sherlock... Sherlock?"
"No. He's not our brother." He replied forcefully with a stony expression, turning back to the lady. John's face with wide eyes, lifted to look at Sherlock.
As it came to an end Felix began to cry, his little face screwed up in anger at there being no more fireworks. John bobbed him up and down to try to calm him but he couldn’t do anything. Sherlock reached over and took him from John and immediately Felix ceased his crying, staring into Sherlock’s eyes with his own wide open, the tears already beginning to dry on his face.
Hello lovely people!

(Needs polishing anyway.) Thank-you for those who are reading this! It means such a lot to hear you comment on it :) Please if you like it share it and pass it on to your friends, and comment and tell me what you enjoyed or didn't :) LOVE YOU ALL! xxxxxx
“You bought it!”
At half time the score was 7:5, with their school winning on account of John and Greg's playing boosting up their score massively. Sherlock looked over to John, who was standing by himself, fiddling with his gum-shield on the edge of the pitch, he got up to go talk to him before he spotted Greg and a couple of other players going over to talk to him instead. Sherlock thought better of interrupting that, and sat down, feeling a weird jealousy wash over him. He tried to shake it off as he watched them laughing and joking about and clapping John on the shoulder. He felt such an urge to rush over there and rip their hands off his shoulders and move them all away from John. He felt angry about the fact they were even standing near to him. His John. He was his friend, they shouldn't be allowed to make him laugh like that.
"Mmm, could have been better... Could have been worse."
“I’m enjoying the stroll. Stop walking so fast, you aren't even walking with us. Fee is liking too! Aren’t you?” He looked down and smiled at the baby, who smiled back, mimicking his face. Sherlock scowled, then reluctantly waited for John and walked at the same pace, feeling that every step was taking forever.
"Joh-"
"A man died and kind of left him in our care..."
Enjoy!
"I won't!"
Yes. Thrilling.
"Gray's Anatomy would be a good start, because the founding for medicine could be-"
He was now concluding that this was possibly the drunkest he'd ever been, as his brain started to have the strangest thoughts... About, Sherlock? He thought of his friend and the way his hair looked ruffled up first thing in the morning, the way his skin looked like porcelain, white and beautiful... beautiful? John didn't understand his mind's wandering thoughts right now, so he tried to focus on what this girl next to him was saying. She was speaking to him and he hadn't been listening. He managed to focus on her, just as she looked over at him, her eyes darting across his face. He nodded briefly as a way of a reply to whatever it was she had been saying to him, which he hadn't heard.
By the time John had looked over to the group and then back to where Sherlock had been standing, he was gone, leaving nothing but the orange glow of the streetlamps radiating out onto the pavement.
Did you not get the text?
"Matron as his nanny! No." Sherlock interjected appalled.
The three of them were sitting back in the dorm at school. Sherlock looked down at his son and whisked him up off the floor and sat him on his lap on the sofa next to John. John tickled Felix who giggled happily, before Sherlock put the child back onto the floor. But before Felix moved off he just sat and looked between both of his parents and then scrunched up his little face in confusion.
whats with the full stop?? :P
“All that hair, hiding all that big knowledgy head”
“Um, okay. yes, um? Food! Maybe he wants food!”
“His first words Sherlock! Can you believe it!”
Sherlock looked up, and made a face of disgust at the boxes and then turned back to his paper. John sighed and rubbed his head.
He attempted to draw out a small diagram of the parts of a knee in his biology book, but had entirely forgotten the names of each of the parts. He should really get Sherlock to help him he thought to himself, shutting his book in defeat. Sherlock no doubt understands all the topics up to and beyond degree level, and thinking about it, he should probably check on the pair.
"Ian?"
“Cosmo said a hubby who gives you gifts, is a keeper.”
"Sherlock! She was one of the great scientific discoverers! You can't just sa-"
Sherlock gave a half smile at John, and then sat back in his chair, John put the baby down on the floor, between the two chairs and sat in his own. They both looked down on the child, who looked up with blue eyes back at them. John turned his face up to Sherlock, and spoke.
"For speeding up the tube."
He disappeared for a minute, and then was back and sat down by Molly.
Yeska I dreank tooo muchhh!! Toooo much and nows imd nOotr feelllinbg too goooodddd!!!
"Oh. Just... just wait there. I shall explain."
In the days which followed the night out, Sherlock had reverted much back to his old self, not even mentioning the state he had been in, and brushing entirely past the moment they had shared together. This confused John even more because he started to even doubt himself that the moment had happened, and that this side to Sherlock, the vulnerable and dependent side, was merely a figment of his overactive imagination and not there inside his friend at all.
“You gotta stop sayin-”
“What?!-”
After he had seen Sherlock, all John had wanted to do was to go after him, to find him again, but his friends had surrounded him and not allowed him to leave. John had thought about simply leaving by himself, however he had no idea how he would have navigated the long, dark treacherous road home without the group. Finally though, he had persuaded the others that it was late enough, and he was now home.
"Sherlock... I don't know what to- I am really sorry." He blurted, a wave of emotion rushing over him. "If I had- If I had known you felt like this, I could've- been better to you." He cursed under his breath, and his eyes clocked the object Sherlock had thrown across the room, the paper slightly uncovered in the fall, showing the edge of something delicate and beautiful inside.
Oh so you are alive then after your nights events?
“Oh.” Sherlock said looking slightly taken aback, but then defiant. “Well what is wrong with that?”
"I don't see why not" John said laughing and looking to Sherlock for confirmation.
John still grinned and linked his arm into Sherlock's, "come on, you can't be grumpy, we found this amazing street! Well no, you found it. Let's go trick or treating!"
John moved a loose curl out of Felix's eyes and then absentmindedly played with a strand of The baby's hair, wrapping the little curl round and round his finger. Sherlock stood in front of them, tapping his foot in impatience of the what he deemed to be slow speed of the train. At Euston they jumped off and climbed up the numerous stairs and escalators to the top, coming out at the bustling, crowded station. Felix looked around him with wide eyes, taking in all the lights and people everywhere, who were all crammed into the gigantic station, the majority of which, were standing by the huge lit up departure board, looking up and holding their positions. Until all of a sudden an influx of people rushed towards the same direction as their gate was announced, all running with a direct force that practically knocked over anyone who happened to be in their path at the time. When the surge had moved on, and the crowd sufficiently thinned out, Sherlock walked forward, keeping one hand on John's arm to not lose him amongst the people. He looked up at the board and amongst the orange-lit writing he found their train and then with one movement gripped John's arm and pulled him through the people towards a gate, before John had even had a chance to note the time.
Sherlock was sitting on his still made bed, with his phone in one hand and the other tapping on the keyboard of his computer hurriedly. John cleared his throat, and Sherlock looked up from the screen his eyes straining and visible tiredness drawn all over his face.
Everything.
"No!.... How about Phillip?"
It was the 17th November. The day before John’s birthday, a celebration he never particularly enjoyed. It made him feel angry for some reason. He assumed it could have something to do with the fact his parents had never particularly cared about it, they never saw it as special. Not just his own but just the concept of Birthday celebrations in general.
"No, he's a real live human child. Not an animal or a pet either. Remember that! Anyway, Sherlock what about school? Have you thought of that?"
Ooh exciting!! :)
"No! It's not like that, we have just done it as friends. Nothing like- we're not... Not like that."
“Where is the cot actually going to go?”
As the pair left for the doorway, Greg gave John a nod of recognition, and with it, a conformation of his name. A common way of leaving a conversation between two guys, one which was more familiar to John than the outdated mannerisms of his partner. Although nevertheless, after shutting the door, John thought that he could see them all getting along. Well... Except for Sherlock, but then he never really gets on with anyone! John thought to himself with a slight grin.
