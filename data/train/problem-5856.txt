Jarvis didn’t let strangers in, he had the best face recognition system installed. Pepper and Tony looked at each other warily.
"I'll escort her out." Tony said and they headed toward the elevator where Mr. Tudor and the others just went down.
“Wow, dude, you okay?” Sam brought him back to his senses and immediately felt the tears rolling down his cheeks. Steve slowly looked up at the teen next to him. His brown eyes were filled with worry while he assessed Steve.
The next day Steve and Clint walked through corridors to the exit, Clint like it was an everyday stroll while Steve a little on edge, looking around continuously.
“One, trust me you’d understand hieroglyphs better and two about what?” he asked looking back up at her.
“You just stole my food, we aren’t friends anymore. We are at war.” Tony stated faking seriousness and a threatening expression.
“You only come when something’s up.” He explained and took a sip from the cup or at least tried, but the coffee was still too hot. Pepper wanted to comment on it, but decided against it.
“We should go I need to pick up a dead bird from the sidewalk.” She turned to Steve and he nodded. He looked back at Sam, who was looking back and forth between them.
“Are you okay?” Sam furrowed his forehead. Steve was surely looking uptight, he tried nodding convincingly and actually looking at him.
She peaked at her target and saw that they decided to move through the crowd, slowly making their way to the entrance.
“Aren’t you?” Sam challenged him and sat down on the couch, turning on the TV. Steve stood awkwardly, looking around while he played with his shirt. “Come on, sit down. Mom’s gonna be a while.” Sam suggested, tapping the space beside him.
He stopped in front of the door, but he had no idea how to proceed with how these doors worked, if he knocked it might not be heard. He looked at the terminal on the wall, then to the lock. There was no keyhole of course, but a fingerprint scanner which meant Steve couldn’t just barge in. He looked around if anybody was watching, but the corridor was empty, so he knocked.
“Why did it need cleaning?” Pepper frowned, too many ideas running through her head and most of them were not safe for work. They stared at each other for a while, Tony’s mug frozen inches from his lips.
“That’s why you didn’t argue my idea.” Steve voiced his thoughts. A few seconds passed and the elevator dinged.
Tony waited for Jarvis to find the fourth, unregistered agent, but the results weren’t exactly what he expected. The glass was half way to his lips when the shocking profile came up. The glass shattered on the floor while the liquid spilled everywhere.
“This is what I could find.” Tony ran his eyes over the information about his new friend. “Natasha Romanoff, age 17, Russian spy. Special level authorization.” Jarvis cited the first few data.
"Take a seat, son." he ordered and Clint didn't have to be told twice. "I am assigning a mission to you." he said in his iconic slow way. He turned around and Clint got a good look at his eye patch.  He wondered what the story was behind it, how could such a tough looking guy like Fury get it.
He arrived at the hangar shortly, panicking as he looked around to catch a glimpse of  Natasha's redhead. He calmed his body as he scanned the area and spotted her easily. She was walking towards an aircraft with a big sports bag. He jogged up beside her.
That struck a nerve in Natasha and like natural defense her cold mask ascended back onto her face. "I asked you to write me a letter, not tell me a sap story. You don't have to know about my past." she stated, her eyes glaring holes into Clint.
“Come on! You’re worse than my mom… and I’ve never met her.” Clint complained climbing onto the bed with his piece of paper.
She let it go and spent time with Steve in the training room. He had a lot to learn and Clint made fun of him continuously, it was funny, but Natasha didn’t show her amusement.
Natasha pulled on the skin of her face while burying it in her hands. She looked up at the boys while keeping her hands in the inner corners of her eyes. “Not to be the party pooper, but Sam you are far from capable of going on a real mission. We should be training, we don’t even know why we are a team.”
They entered and were met with a security guard because Tony didn't bother with the registration lady, they hadn't any tickets anyway.
It kicked in immediately and Natasha leaned into the booth to make the agent look like he was just sleeping on the job. The building was heavily equipped with surveillance cameras, but when they notice the agent is sleeping from special reasons, they’ll be long gone.
"Only the 32, 33, 34 at the right side." he answered. "They are labs and working places. Nobody was there tonight." he added.
“So I took the liberty of recruiting our newest member.” Natasha stepped aside, so Fury could look at Sam, he didn’t. “Sam Wilson is someone with determination and the kind of people I’d want to work with.” Steve reasoned.
"It's not hero time, Captain! Look!" the explosion happened halfway it wasn't that big, only the sound scared the guests. Drones flew out from the upper floors and started to extinguish the fire. Sirens could be heard in the distance which meant the firefighters were on the way as well.
"Rule number three." she groaned as she took off her gloves and looked at her hands with a slight burn, it was uncomfortable, but she'd survived worse.
Natasha straightened and cleared her throat. “Dear Nat,” she began reading and Clint buried his face in his hands. “I am writing this letter, because you’re stupid and scary.”
“Mr. Fury?” He asked upon picking up the call. Natasha stood up immediately and Steve upped the volume so all of them could hear.
Clint waited until the agent was out of sight and walked to the files. “So these are like super-secret never-seen-before secrets.” He established their situation.
She tried to cover up her action by massaging her ear. "Hi." she smiled. She reminded herself to apologize to the guys for having to listen to a nerd talk.
Steve looked around the room as they sat in comfortable silence, only the television made some background noise. He was a bit on edge, his leg probably giving that away as well, but Mrs. Wilson’s son was the least of his worries, he knew.
“Can you get a clear picture of the two at the corner?” Tony watched as Jarvis run the footage until he got a clear view. The guy named Clint Barton came up in normal records as well not just Shield ones real fast.
“You kids are the future, no matter what.” They all looked a bit offended at the title, but he continued carelessly. “I just thought you could be something more.” He nodded meaningfully at them. “I’ve been waiting for a sign to show me I’m not delusional about this initiative.”
“I just missed my best friend so fucking much.” Rhodey leaned closer to Tony, but ended up stealing yet another slice of vital nutrition from Tony’s grasp.
Clint flicked the pen and it hit Steve's intertwined hands. Steve looked up at him with a raised eyebrow. Clint smiled, then groaned while leaning back in his chair.
"I'm not good for anything else." she answered truthfully, she sipped from her coffee while maintaining eye contact, Clint was watching her like he could read her. His first mistake was when he tried, nobody could and that was just one of the reasons why she was still here. She placed her cup back onto the table.
“None of them. Show me the main entrance and the street, please.” He placed the glass and the bottle of whiskey on the cover with a faint flower pattern. He bit his lower lip and put a hand over his mouth, staring at the screen attentively.
She glanced at her bed, she wasn't going to sleep well tonight. She started making plans what else she could do instead, like hit the gym or something, but the paper left on the bed caught her eye. She looked up at the door, Clint left his letter here, well technically, it was her letter.
She knew the layout of Stark Tower and based on it Stark and his friends should be heading to the 86th floor. When she put the number in the voice said she needed a high level pass to gain access for the floors above 80.
Steve asked Natasha to go to that lovely, little park close to the Wilsons. He always wanted to look around there.
“Training’s tough, but not the worst, I guess.” He shrugged getting up from the couch and forcing Tony’s legs off to the ground. He walked toward the little bar close to the kitchen, after Tony gave up on the topic of the conversation.
One of the guys tried punching him again, brave but a dumb move, because Steve easily just pushed the fist away and tripped the guy who scrambled to the ground. The rest started running with the backpack, but Steve caught up with them easily, snatching the backpack and slowing down as he watched the bullies ran.
The playground was empty and this part the of city was still sleeping. One or two people jogging or walking their dogs. A few cars passing by as they parked at the end of the park.
"I hope you didn't dream on becoming a spelling bee champion." She continued teasing him and Clint grabbed the letter from her grasp.
He reached the group of teenagers, with the little girl hiding behind one of them, easily with superhuman speed.
“Just a little… But I want to sober up, help me!” He grabbed her hand dragging her to the kitchen. “I need some painkillers.” He looked at her expectantly, she just shook her head.
He was done with four rounds passing by Natasha and a very exhausted Clint once or twice when he noticed a familiar face at the sidewalk.
They had a fancy bar in the middle which was probably rigged with a security system that gave the bartender everybody's age as they walked up to it. Tony probably had to use his authority to get anything. The room had smaller tables scattered all around with every type of food. There were also some science projects displayed at the side of the room, but that was nowhere near as exciting as the bar.
“Just chill, we’ll be caught in no time, if you don’t.” Clint whispered, his voice drowned in a yawn.
After three boxes and too many files, Natasha found herself sitting on the floor as well. She looked up at Clint across from her while the sorted paper piles separated them. He was really focused to do his job right. He was at his second box and looked at the papers for a long time before deciding where they go, she wondered if he had trouble reading them.
The elevator ride up to the pent house wasn’t just long, but Tony felt more uncomfortable with every second. It wasn’t about Happy, no, he had met the head of security more times he likes to admit. They had history, the man had probably dragged his drunk ass to his room almost as many times as Rhodey and that said something.
“Good work, Sam. There are people who’d be jealous of your endurance.” She stated and Sam looked flustered by the compliment.
Fury was waiting for them in the landing zone at the back of the building, it was small because most of the planes took off and landed in the hangar. He stood there with his hands behind his back as he waited for them to approach.
Uncomfortable silence settled over them, while he was riding up in a steel box, without any escape, to face his inevitable doom, now that made Tony on edge. He wasn’t scared of his dad, he was way beyond that and most of the time his nerve system obeyed his brain. Unfortunately, today the whole thing wasn’t syncing up.
I can't write mission explanations for the life of me, so I gave up a few times... but then weeks went by and now we're here ._.
She felt the frustration radiate from Clint every time she heard a little sigh or a bigger groan, but he hadn’t given up so that was something.
“When was the last time you’ve slept?” she asked while studying the dark bags under his eyes. Tony looked at his wrist like he was wearing a watch.
He worked on remembering the past as cherishable memories and not as heart wringing anxiety fuel. Today he spoke about his mother with Mrs. Wilson and he felt his heart squeeze, but at the same time he felt warm inside recalling the memories he shared with her. Mrs. Wilson offered him apple juice and fruits, making sure to spoil him with something new every time.
He played with a packet of cookies, throwing from hand to hand. “And what does dear daddy want from me?” he asked, taking the cup when it was done and raised it to his lips to blow on it.
Natasha would have expected Steve to give him a pep talk or something, but he wasn't in the mood, probably questioning his decision, but who would had thought Fury would throw a normal, teen boy into the deep end. He had no training, what if something bad happened? She understood this was just information gathering, but it was still a harsh move.
Howard took a big breath, slightly shaking his head and taking a swing from his glass. "There are multiple rooms upstairs, I'm sure you can find one." His father calmed down, his eyes glinting in a different way.
Until a distant spark grazed the boundaries of the Earth. Did something just enter the atmosphere? The ball of light raced down from the sky leaving a sparkly trace behind it. Just in a few seconds the light came soaring down towards them and the closer it got the human form was more apparent.
"Huh." she placed her hand on his and stepped closer. He put his other hand gently on her waist, he didn't hug her close, but their foreheads almost touched as they moved along to the music. Tony was humming softly with the music.
She was done with her dinner that day, she didn't eat much, it stuck with her from her training. She picked up the piece of chocolate cake they occasionally included as dessert.
“I’m sorry, but did the super soldier just say he can’t do whatever he wants?” Natasha commented, finally saying something and both the boys looked at her.
She nodded and exited the lift as the doors opened, holding her high heels in her hand. She jogged up to Sam who was waiting on the ground floor and watching as the security guided everyone outside.
She had to get a few floors down but needed the young Stark's fingerprint or find a pass lying around somewhere. She looked around, this floor was private where Howard lived, the probability of finding a pass was close to zero.
Clint made a sad face, pouting heavily then he groaned looking at the boxes. He wiped off his hand on his pants while keeping eye contact with Natasha.
She also questioned why she thought applying to Stark Industries for an internship was a good idea, she guessed it would be educational or good work experience. Well, she did not know she’d be babysitting the boss’ 18 year old son who already had more diplomas than her.
"Natasha? Are you new? You're not good at this." Tony pointed at him questioning with a raised eyebrow.
The girl floated few feet from the ground in front of them, she was covered in the sparkly light. Fury started walking closer and the girl slowly proceeded towards the landing pad until her feet touched solid ground.
“Mr. Fury.” Steve put his arms behind his back and stood as tall as he could. Fury didn’t take his eyes of off him and his expression was entirely unreadable.
"I understand." Natasha nodded with her hands behind her back. The captain started to stir in his sleep which was Natasha's queue to step inside. She took a big breath, setting her smile in place before opening the door to the time capsule of a room and the oldest thing in there was the guy waking from a century of slumber.
“My accommodation is great thank you.” Steve answered from his heart, he didn’t know what he would have done if Shield just leaves him to figure everything out for himself.
“I don’t think having her on the team right now would be beneficial.” She turned back to Maria. Natasha didn’t know this girl, she had only exchanged words with her once and she didn’t know her skills and a few papers won’t convince Natasha for sure. Considering all that the four of them came to in these couple of weeks, considering Steve, this girl just didn’t fit into the picture.
So if he was right and now there was nothing stopping him, he should find exactly what he wanted. So he jumped form his bed and rushed to the elevator and traveled to the floor where his father’s office was located.
“Straight to the point, Captain, I see.” Fury unlocked the door and motioned for Steve to enter. Fury walked behind his desk, placing the cup on his desk and shimmying out of his coat. “Sleep well?” he asked to fill the silence.
Sam walked out the door a few seconds later, trying to act casual. He swayed a little bit then grabbed at his stomach. "I don't feel so good." he dropped to the floor. "I don't think my stomach can handle that... eugh.." he made a gagging noise.
"Of course, I'm not throwing you in to the sharks right away. You won't be going alone." He paced around his desk, getting closer to Clint and then leaning against his desk. Clint wanted to protest at first, that he'd be fine, but did not have time nor the balls to do it. "You're going to accompany Ms. Romanoff."
He also found a video of the captain frozen like popsicle in the thick ice, maintaining his young features. He saw the monitoring of the events while Agent Romanoff talked to him, trying to keep him from the truth.
"Well then. Shall we head back?" Fury asked and the captain nodded, still trying to get his head around the situation. To be honest, even they didn't understand how such thing happened, must had been worse for the guy it was happening to.
“You guys can’t do that right?” Sam murmured somewhere behind Natasha, but still within hearing distance. The four of them followed Fury towards the girl.
“She can’t be on the team.” Natasha stared at the back of the head of the girl in question through the oneway glass.
The door slid open and Tony was nowhere to be seen. DUM-E sat near the door with a note taped to him. Surprisingly low-tech for Stark, but alright. The note read "go to the left". Steve followed obediently. He found five other notes that led him into a seperate room a little ways away. The little maze had at least distracted him from his nerves some.
he thought drolly as he easily opened his throat to take Tony all the way down. Tony let out a strangled moan above him. "Fuck, Steve," he panted, "so close, fuck, Steve, gonna come." He was babbling now, almost incoherent. "So good oh fuck, so pretty  for me."
"Fuck, Steve," Tony breathed, "so hot. Can't even believe how hot you are. You did this for me, didn't you?"
Stef growled, "for God's sake why does everyone think I'm a child," annoyance rolling off of her in waves, "just because I'm small doesn't mean I'm some kind of nun."
Toni decided to take a chance. She grabbed Stef's wrist gently and - quietly, trembling - she whispered, "stay." Her eyes were downcast, lip ring worrying between her teeth. She was expecting Stef to rip her wrist away and leave. Maybe she was pranking her, or picking on her. It seemed so out of character but that was the only way it made any sense. She was terrified. She felt the tension in Stef's arm and waited.
Steve was completely flabbergasted. Stark had put a lot of time and energy into this. Maybe he hadn't been avoiding him - rather, maybe he'd been occupied. Steve turned back to him and was surprised that he was only a few inches away, now.
Tony smiled. It was dazzling. "That's not selfish. You have to come out on your own terms. As far as anyone knows, America's icon is straight as an arrow." He chuckled a bit. "Somehow, I don't think we'll be able to keep it from the team for very long."
Steve was desperate at this point. He'd try to hold on and he'd bed but Tony would always spirit himself back away to his workshop.
Stef shuddered and her eyes closed for a second. Toni jerked back, looking terrified and moving to stand. "Oh fuck, oh fuck, I'm so fucking sorry, holy shit, I'm sorry, I'll go now, oh my god -"
Stef didn't move away or shrug off Toni's hand. She seemed to relax and lean into her. "It's 2019," she said, fire in her eyes, "how is this still happening?" She paused. Then, softer, "does this happen to you?"
Steve took one more steadying breath before he knocked at the door. JARVIS greeted him jovially. "Mr. Stark has been waiting for you. Please, come in."
Toni chuckled. "That's a real stupid question for a smart kid, Rogers." Stef's face took on a horrified expression. Toni softened her tone. "Yeah, it's not fun. It...it can be rough."
When the call came in, he certainly didn't think to clean his face. He scrambled off to get his suit, completely forgetting the cosmetics, both on his face and on the counter.
Toni cleared her throat. "Hey...it's okay," she started. She stopped. What the hell could she even say?
He jumped as a hand joined his at his cheek. His eyes flew open and he jerked his head to the side. Tony didn't flinch. His hand remained beside Steve's, gently tracing his cheekbone. His expression was one of wonder. Steve found himself staring back - even with cuts on his cheek and a bruise blooming on his brow, Tony was stunning.
This one is where we get into the heavier stuff, finally. This is going from fluff to smut really fast, y'all, get ready.
"I don't like being laughed at! I'm trying to be serious here!" Tony was...pouting. It was adorable. He looked like a sad puppy, lip jutting out and hair all tousled. Steve just smiled and wiped the tears from his eyes from how hard he had been laughing.
Toni wrinkled her nose. "Contrary to popular belief, I don't smoke. Thank you very much. Shouldn't you be out fighting people way too big for you?"
"Just promise," Tony breathed, "that you'll put it on for me, some time?" Tony grabbed Steve's head and crushed their lips together again, a low growl rumbling in his throat. Steve really hadn't been expecting...well...any of this. It was all a surprise to him. After the initial shock, he felt himself kissing back, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist and pulling him close. He felt a tongue gently probing his lips and, after a second, opened them slightly. He hadn't really had this very much in his life. He hoped he wasn't terrible.
The ding of the elevator made him jump as he was ripped out of his thoughts. All he had to do now was walk down the hallway to Stark's lab. He found putting one foot in front of the other was difficult. He didn't know why he was feeling so much dread. Was it the thought that maybe he had been taunting him? Or was it the fear that maybe that night on the couch meant nothing, and that Tony had called him here to reject him?
It was already past midnight by the time they'd finished kicking the ass of this week's villain, debriefing to Fury, and finally making it back to Avengers' tower. Everybody was tired; Clint and Natasha were nursing minor wounds, Bruce was looking pale and drawn in his borrowed clothing - which he was having trouble keeping on as it pooled around him - Thor looked weary, and even Tony looked like he might collapse. Steve watched the others head off to their quarters to rest and plopped himself down on the couch. He pulled his cowl off and leaned his head back, eyes closed, as he gently prodded his hairline to find the nasty bump he'd gotten earlier. He hissed as he found it. He'd have to check for a concussion before he went to bed.
Steve retreated to his quarters around 6. He had been in the common area with the team, attempting to distract himself again. He'd been daydreaming about Tony's eyes when a small paper ball hit him square in the forehead. Clint, joker as he always was, called out to him.
And YET. The sunlight shone into the dark closet, blinding her temporarily. Someone backed into the closet hurriedly and slammed the door. Toni heard quiet, hiccuping sobs coming from the intruder that matched the ones she herself had been making before she'd been so rudely interrupted. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness again and she could make out blonde hair, a thin frame with shaking shoulders. She couldn't stop herself from squeaking out a confused "...Stef?"
"So," Stef said, startling Toni out of her relaxation, "are we going to talk about why we were both crying, or…?"
Stef grabbed her hand. "Not messing with you. Toni...I….I like you. I never talk to you because I never thought...why would you even look at someone like me?" She let out a self-deprecating laugh and looked away. "I figured
Stef turned to her, eyes wide and jaw tight. "Have they hit you? Are they here? Who was it? What are their names?" There was a look to her at that moment - a deep, intense determination that shook Toni to her core.
"...No," she sighed, looking timid. "It's because of why they were bullying him. They kept yelling 'faggot'. I don't understand." She had begun to cry again. "Why does that matter? Why did they jump him for that? There's nothing," she choked a bit, "nothing wrong with that."
His worries ceased once he caught sight of Tony. He felt his jaw begin to drop. Tony was resplendent. He'd worn nice, black jeans with a fiery red shirt and a metallic gold tie. He'd seen Steve eyeing the suit and caught him more than once working on colorful renditions of it. He knew that the colors would work well on him. Tony, of course, was smirking.
Tony came up to him later. He wrapped an arm around his waist from behind and whispered into his ear. "I can't wait to mess up your makeup, pretty boy." Steve's libido ramped up immediately and he tried to turn around, to crush Tony against him and feel his body on his. He was too late - Tony was already spinning away and racing back down to his workshop. He'd already begged JARVIS.
At first, he was terrified. Who had found out? Who knew? His panic settled after a few moments and he decided to go through his very unexpected present. In the bag was a collection of makeup - mascara, blush, a few different colors of eyeliner, and a bright red lipstick. Bold, he thought, but he might just try it.
Stef moved to stand. Her heart was racing. She was absolutely terrified. The last thing she needed was knowing that her crush hated her. Her thoughts were loud and clashing, drowning out the buzz of the world around her. She stumbled a bit and leaned against the wall.
Steve swallowed, throat dry, and averted his eyes. He gathered himself and attempted to string together a sentence. He stammered a bit but eventually managed to spit out a quiet "what?"
Once he had, he ran his finger under Steve's eyes. Steve knew that his eyes had watered and the mascara must have run. He couldn't imagine the messy picture he was now, makeup scattered across his face, panting and wide eyed as his erection rubbed against his pants. "Fuck, what a pretty picture," Tony's smirk was back, "wish I could see this all the time. So pretty."
He hadn't really meant to get back into it. He'd gone to the large, warehouse-sized mega store for shampoo and ended up strolling through makeup aisles. His sense of direction was impeccable on missions yet he always seemed to get himself lost in stores. The future was confusing. Stark had offered numerous times to simply order the things Steve needed. but the preferred to go out and buy them himself.
"Yes, Tony. I like you." It felt good to verbalise it. He'd been nursing a fondness for Tony from the beginning. Even though they butted heads, Steve couldn't help but be attracted to the bratty, gorgeous man in front of him. "I have for a while."
Steve found himself being shoved against a wall. Tony's mouth was on his before he knew it. As he pulled back for a second, Steve saw the red lipstick across his lips as well and moaned. This shouldn't be so hot, he thought, but here the fuck they were. Tony had a grip on his shoulder and his waist, fingers digging in as he pressed their lips together again.
"Thank you, JARVIS," he choked out, "I'll be ready." By 7:50, he'd chosen a nice shade of blue-toned red. He thought it would be too much at first but he wanted to give that contrast for Tony.  He imagined the red smearing across his face, intentionally avoiding setting spray and powder in favor of letting the makeup sit without it.
Toni knew three things in her life. One: she couldn't wait to get out of this town and go to college. Two: she was inexplicably, incredibly, hella gay. And three: she'd fallen hard as hell for Stef Rogers and she didn't know how. Straight girls, of course, were supposed to be off limits.
"Hey," Tony spoke softly now. He gently tugged Steve's chin back up. "Look at me. This is okay. You're okay. This is...this is more than okay. Don't be ashamed." After a breath, he smirked again. "I cannot wait to fuck this up."
Steve Rogers had gotten used to makeup. It had been a necessary part of his life back when he was doing shows for the USO; costume, hair, makeup, punch Hitler in the face - the usual. He'd stopped, of course, when he actually went to war. Makeup tended to run in the trenches.
Stef still looked uncomfortable but shook her head, grinning. "You're something else, Toni. You know that?" She looked at her. Toni couldn't help but notice just how blue those eyes were. "And you're not fucked up. You're...you're perfect."
"Steve?" came a worried voice. "Steve? Steve? Shit, I think I broke Captain America. I broke a national icon. A national fucking treasure. Shit. Steve?!"
"Come in," he said, absolutely trying not to squeak as he had in the past. He worried as the door opened that this was too much and that Tony wouldn't like it - maybe he preferred simple looks and not the dramatic, extravagant look he had gone for.
Tony pressed his thumb to Steve's mouth and slid it across his cheek. He pressed his thumb to Steve's lips and he found himself opening as if on instinct. His tongue lathed its way around Tony's finger as he watched his pupils become blown. "Fuck, you're so good," he mumbled, sliding his thumb down across Steve's chin.
His heart raced. He hadn't worn his makeup in a while. They'd been busy and he'd been self-conscious, worried that they'd get called out again. He'd discovered the magic of makeup wipes but still felt awkward buying them in store. He'd have to ask Tony how to get around that.
At 8, a knock came on his door. He had fidgeted over deciding on whether to sit or stand with his little remaining time. He decided, finally, on standing near the door. He'd dressed up in a blue shirt and red-patterned tie, with the grey slacks that he knew were a little too small and accentuated his ass just right. He hoped that he'd chosen correctly.
Their eyes connected for a moment. Both of their minds were now fractured, schemas completely broken, but slowly coming back together. Toni interlaced their fingers and looked back up at Stef.
"If she hasn't already. She may have known before we did. That woman is terrifying." Steve nodded in agreement. "Either way," Tony smiled, "I'm just happy we want the same thing."
Toni frowned. "Yeah, I am. I like chicks. If they can call me that, so can I. Fuck them. I'll take that word back. Yeah, I'm a dyke."
They stood in silence for a while. Steve felt awkward as he stared at the man in front of him. "So," he said, breaking the uncomfortable silence, "what now?"
Toni never thought she'd even be on Stef's radar. Stef had this good girl, studious vibe right up until someone pissed her off. Then she was fire and righteous anger. She had this sense of justice and morality bordering on vigilantism that made Toni go weak at the knees. Toni, though, with a shaved and dyed faux-hawk, piercings, tattoos, and studded collars, felt she was just background noise in Stef's life.
"Earth to Cap!" His voice was filled with glee at having caught the soldier off guard. "Whatcha thinking about, buddy? Find yourself a special lady?"
Tony tugged him further forward and then exploded down his throat. "Fuck, Steve, oh my god," he continues babbling, "so fucking pretty for me." He pulled back and knelt down, fighting to catch his breath.
Stef cut her off. "No it's not. It's wrong. It's bullshit. What gives them the right? Why do they think they can hurt people for something they can't change?" She was still huffing out little breaths, clearly upset.
His expression crooked into a grin and he muttered "beautiful," before pressing his lips to Steve's. He began to pull back after he realised Steve wasn't kissing him back. He steeled himself to smile, apologize, blame it on the adrenaline that had worn off hours ago. He only got an inch away before a hand on the back of his neck was pulling him back, crushing their lips together again. Tony let out a muffled noise of surprise and dropped a hand to rest over Steve's heart, kissing him for all that he was worth.
They went to the little office. Lena took the chessboard from her desk. This time they'd actually have to play.
A primal part of Tony enjoyed the fact that the man had suffered. But he hated that he wasn’t the one who had caused it. Mainly he detested that they hadn’t gotten one piece of the information they so desperately needed.
“Just because there’s a faster option is available doesn’t always mean its best. My way may be old fashioned, but there’s something to be said for its results. Some things don’t need improvements,” said Peggy.
"I don't know. It could go either way with Piper. If she acts out, Rune will follow her lead. Collecting a DNA sample should be simple enough,” said Tony. It would easy enough to grab some of Piper's hair from her brush. "I'll get her brush."
They made their grand entrance the guests went into a cheer. Tony and Steve went to the dance floor. At Last, started playing. The two started swaying together. Everything one else faded away as they danced. At the moment no one else mattered. Only slowly pulling away from each other once the song ended. Tony and Steve took their seats at the head table. Lunch was served. Rhodes stood up clinking his glasses. Tony sent him a warning glare.
Finally, they were able to leave. They hated how they were forced to stay there longer than necessary.
"There are two. Dr. Caroline Bloom and Dr. George Wong. I believe they'd be the best equipped to handle whatever trauma Piper endured. I can call them if you like," said Turner.
“I apologize I did not mean to insult your independence it's a feature I find attractive in omegas. It's a tradition in Asgard for an alpha of any standing to ask for the honor of dancing with the alpha’s mate. Anyone who wishes to dance with the omega's alpha must ask. Why wouldn’t you want to share such wondrous news?” said Thor.
He flinched when he accidentally spun the mug off the counter. He hurried to pick up the pieces. Steve sighed.
Tony quietly walked into the bathroom. Steve was groggy but awake. The omega stared up at him from the floor, shirtless. There was an empty glass next to him. Tony took it from the floor, refilling it for him.
Steve pulled away, his breathing harsh. Everything was so much more in tune. The lust, need, and love surged through their bond. He was lost in the sensation. His arms wrapped around Tony's neck. The alpha arm moved around his waist, keeping Steve pressed against him.
“Steve, I’ll be in my lab,” said Tony. He didn’t want to leave. The sheer desperation in Steve's voice made him listen.
Steve frustration with the alpha faded completely. Tony put thought into their future. And he loved the sound of ‘our future’. How far in the future had the alpha planned for? Did it include a pup or even pups? Steve shook his head. As much as he wanted to speak of their future now wasn’t the time. That conversation had to be in person.
The pup happily squealed at the new attention. Steve and Tony stared dumbfounded. Neither of them thought Nat had a maternal side. Tony wandered his workshop, sensing he wouldn’t be needed for a few hours.
He wrapped his arm around her. She screamed, ready to battle him with the same fury, but swiftly relaxed when she recognized his scent, letting the knife dropped from her hand.
“Go, I’m right behind you,” said Tony. The floor cracked between them. “Get her I’ll find another way around.”
Lena looked around the glass-covered floor observation room. The two-way window had shattered. She rushed over to Piper. The cerulean glow was just fading from her skin. She forced open one of Piper's eyes, shining a light in it. Her pupils constricted in response, so Piper wasn’t brain dead. Lena quickly took several blood samples before the surge left Piper’s system. Her body seemed to be fully functioning. The only oddity was her skin. It was cool to the touch. Lena lifted the girl and carried her to a medical room, laying her down on a bed and strapping the restraints in place.
“That was just a preview. This is opening night and Loki he’s a full tale diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants monuments to skies with his name plaster on it-
Natasha silently left. Steve opened Lena's file. A photo of the beta was paper-clipped to the inside pocket. She had golden-brown eyes and her brunet hair was styled in a pixie cut. A sprinkle of freckles crossed her nose and cheeks.
“The sooner Tony and you claim each other as mates, the better. It’s been proven that a healthy mate bond leads to healthier newborn pups,” continued Edith.
Piper talked of her parents for hours. There were tears but they seemed happy, born out of pure emotion. But there was no doubt in his mind that she was truly wanted by her family.
Steve gave a nod of thanks. He changed, taking a moment to regain his composure. It was only two weeks, less than that since being in such close proximity would speed up his heat. The alpha's presence alone was enough to make him slick. It was embarrassing. Yet his inner omega preened happily at the attention that caused such a reaction. After splashing some water on his face, he came out of the bathroom.
Piper sighed. Rune wasn’t what Winter told her he'd be, at least not yet. He wasn't bad. Would he be as limited in what he could tell her as Winter? It was easy enough to get him talking. He could be a way out of here. For helping her, she'd be sure to bring him with her if they ever got out of here. Piper yawned. She should probably sleep too she'd heal faster if she did.
It had been two days since their encounter with Winter, yet facial recognition picked up no one even similar to his appearance. Steve and Tony were packing up to return to New York. Winter had likely already found some method of escape. But S.H.I.E.L.D. was monitoring every airport and port. Yet, there was nothing. They took one step forward, two steps backward. It was mentally draining. S.H.I.E.L.D. fed the press some bullshit excuse for why they were in Glasgow. Some false lead that led them on a wild goose chase.
George followed Steve out the mansion's back door and down a winding stone path that cut through the woods behind the mansion. A massive garage came into view. One of the doors was open, and classic rock playing. A broken-down vintage car was on the car lift. They were dressed in match navy jumpsuits. Piper was sitting on her dad’s shoulders.
What the hell was she? He was aware of her strength. It was strange, but not nearly enough to gain their attention. But what he saw was something entirely different from that. The person he saw today didn't resemble the pup he'd come to know. Had they done it to her? It couldn't be natural. Why had he survived the massacre?
The next morning Bruce had news for them.  Steve sat nervously in the examination room with Tony next to him. Piper was tucked safely in his arms. He was scared.
He walked in. Steve allowed him to get a better look at the painting. The background wasn’t finished, but it held the same dark and cool tones that followed most of Steve’s paintings. Unlike so many of the other paintings, this one had two human figures. They weren't fully detailed but one had a red face.
“Him being too overprotective. He wouldn’t let me fend for myself. I can’t blame him for acting that way. At that time I was small and scrawny that didn’t stop me from trying to fight back. How about you?” asked Steve.
“He’s all you expect from Captain America. I remember your dad telling us stories about him. Never thought I'd meet the man. The photos don’t do him justice,” said Rhodes.
"Was I right?" No response. "Can you at least give me a nod or shake of your head? Something." Nothing.
“Got them for Steve,” said Rhodes. There was no claim mark on Tony's neck. He would have known as he entered the apartment if Steve was in heat.
The alpha rolled his eyes but Piper just stared back. She couldn’t prove her intelligence to him unless he opened up a little. The alpha shook his head moving to his corner. She wanted to help. When she entered his space he bared his teeth and growled. She backed away whimpering.
"I would be happy to host Captain America a few more days." After heat, it took a few days for an omega’s hormones to calm. It was easier for them to work through it with the alpha they shared their heat with.
“I’d prefer someone, not in the military. They all know me and see me in a certain way. I don’t want that,” said Steve.
Steve was forced to as feet as the armor flew from him, jetting into the mansion. He so wanted to go in after his mate, but a powerful alpha command to stay flood through their bond. There was nothing he could but watch.
Tony smirked, offering Bruce bag of blueberries. It angered Steve’s omega, the fact his alpha wasn’t offering him food.
Winter let go of her and the fight began. The harshness of their battle made it impossible for her to be distracted by Sir.
There was an explosion. The team was sent in different directions. Large parts of the ship fell away. Tony was looming over him shielding him, holding him close.
Tony didn’t question it. He needed this contacted. He needed Steve. His arm wrapped around the omega bringing him closer. Tony tightened his hold on Steve, afraid to let go.
“I can tell. Do you know how I can tell? Cause we’re connected,” said Tony pulling out onto the road.
“Say it again, please,” he said gently nosing against the alpha’s neck. The words were difficult for the alpha, but that made him want to hear them all the more to make sure it was real.
"I know it looks intimidating, but it the only way we can know that she's healthy. I swear this won't harm her," she said.
“You’re blushing, aren’t you?” said Tony. He wished he could see the pink blush across that flawless pale skin. The omega didn’t even argue against his statement.
She was faster. Every time he got close, she'd shoot ahead. He was forced into this game of tag. Rune smiled, actually finding it fun. He slowed, fun wasn't the purpose of this fight. If he didn't beat her, he'd be punished. He had to catch her! No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't.
Piper quickly took a seat at Bruce's table. He gave her a yellow legal notepad and pen. He only meant to discuss a few general concepts for an hour, at most, but it ended up taking hours. Piper put forward good questions. That deserved good answers. It made him realize how much he missed teaching, but there was also the sad realization that no parent would trust him teaching their children. He noticed he was losing Piper’s attention.
He wouldn’t mind being held by those. Steve couldn’t pick out the word to describe him. Everything about him screamed alpha.
Steve blushed when he felt Clint's eyes wandering over him. It felt wrong to have another alpha looking at him.
“I thought by now you’d learned that tone doesn't make me wet and obedient like so many fawning idiots,” said Loki.
Low growling broke his train of thought. His first instinct was to run thinking he'd angered the alpha. But Tony pulled him closer, shielding him, protecting, him. The alpha’s eyes were fully dilated. His scent took on a musky wild tone, making him slick. Even with the alpha in his current state, he unafraid. Steve was flattered. The only other alpha to get this upset over what happened to him was Bucky. He’d only told half the story. Steve cupped Tony's face, kissing him.
Steve put his head in his hands. "What kind of parent wants to leave their pup? Is this the postpartum depression coming back?"
Once the pups fell asleep again, Steve left to find Tony. Checking the workshop first, he found the alpha toying with a new gadget. Steve settled into the empty seat next to him.
He wasn’t fit to have a pup, yet he'd been blessed with one. Steve’s hand went to his stomach. Even in his chaotic frightened mindset, he was driven to protect the new life growing within him. He barely registered someone entering his room. That was the least of his concerns.
Tony tensed. This mixture of scent distressed and happy could be. No, he would have smelled pregnancy on Steve. The omega was on birth control, but with his body chemistry, it may not have worked. He wasn’t ready to be a dad! Steve laughed.
"I don't know what you're talking about Piper. You do have a choice. To either accept gratefully, like a good girl would, or to be rude," said Lena.
“Yeah, takes us a while to get traction I’ll give you that one. But let’s do a headcount here. Your brother a demigod. A super-soldier, a living legend who kinda lives up to legend. A man with breathtaking anger management issues and a couple of master assassins. And you big fella managed to piss off every single one of them,” said Tony, slipping on his bracelets.
"You aren't really teaching me how to protect myself," Piper began. Winter shook his head, relieved, at least, to not have that untruth between them. "You're teaching me how to kill," Piper finished.
Lena scoffed. “My skills far surpass those of stage hypnotists, making someone bark like a dog. What I do is much more complex. I go past the preset morals of the mind and tap into something more primal. When it comes down to it, all of us are capable of great violence, even death. It only requires changing the subject's perception."
“There are a lot of people who will want to see you, Piper. We thought that would be a bit overwhelming, so Daddy got things here ready for when you came back,” said Papa.
“Winter?” She stared. His face was clean-shaven and his hair had been cut. Under all that scruff was a nice face.
Steve’s heart was crushed when he saw Piper’s devastated expression. When he stepped towards her, she ran through the child-sized entrance, leading the playground.
"Yeah, you really killed the glass. How can you be such a shitty shot? Your husband's Captain America?"
If they got out it wouldn't take long to freeze to death in the subzero weather. Winter and her were like Papa. Rune seemed just as durable. Papa lasted seventy years. If they lasted trapped in the ice that long her parents would likely be dead. Maybe that was better than she wouldn’t have to face their rejection. They’d probably have several pups better than her by then. Piper shook away the bad thoughts. She shouldn’t be wasting brainpower on them.
He pushed down gently on her shoulder, making her sit. Winter grabbed some ice packs and plastic wrap from the first aid kit. He wrapped the girl with ice packs. She winced as he did.
“We need to go over the plans for the arc reactor,” said Pepper, as they went back to the living room.
“It was all in the contract. And I thought the great Tony Stark could handle it. Was I wrong?” said Fury.
A sleek bright orange car was parked at the front. It was low to the ground. The car was clearly meant for speed, not functionality. Its door opened on their own. He got in. Steve disliked it. It was cramped and lacked legroom. There was no room or trunk for him to put his bag. There was a loud vroom as the engine started. It was at least an hour's drive to the city. He watched the surroundings pass by.
“Your EKG has shown arrhythmia recently. I want to keep you overnight for observation. Hospital procedure says that you stay at least three days”
It was unheard of an alpha letting omega mount them. Some alphas weren't even comfortable letting an omega ride them. It gave up to much power.  A sign of submission most wouldn't even joke about. And Tony was willing to give it to him. “Thank you.”
Piper and Rune ran their fingers carefully over the raised tissue. The scars were real. He wasn’t lying about that much.
Steve slowly came out of the haze. His head rested on Tony’s lap and his arms were wrapped his waist. He was mentally and physically exhausted. The alpha’s fingers were still running through his hair. He was concentrating on a project. Steve loosened his grip.
He bared his teeth snarling. Yet alpha did not back off. His posture changed to make himself appear larger. When the alpha still stalked closer, he lunged. Pinning the alpha to the ground. There was no struggle. Instead, the alpha purred, not attempting to throw him off. His muscles relaxed, his shoulders dropped. He let his guard down, but he didn't budge.
“We have all we need hereto take care of her and you." The omega relaxed. “Let’s get you something to eat.”
“Mark 42. Well, I'll be damned the prodigal son returns." It crash-landed next to him and fell to pieces. “Whatever.”
He wanted this tonight. They’d waited long enough for this. He wanted to be with his boyfriend but didn’t know how to start it. Steve bit his lip. Tony took something from under the tree.
Slowly, Piper woke up from her nap, rising from the colored floor. The colors from the floor stained her clothing and transferred onto her skin. Piper hadn’t bathed yet in the cell. She was still wearing the same clothes she worn the morning she’d been kidnapped. Part of her was afraid if she took them off they'd be stolen. It was all she had from home. Even though the only scents it held were her own and smoke. Still, it was home. She wiped sleep drool from her chin.
“I guess this guy named Chad Davis used to live around here won a bunch of medals in the army. Then one-day folks said he went crazy and made a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here," said Harley.
“You need a basic understanding, but you’re right. You require a more difficult material. We’ll try eighth grade.”
“Aww, checking up on your crush? I hate to break this to you, Phil, but he's taken,” teased Natasha.
Steve watched as Piper strode out of the room without even sparing a glance at him. There was that confidence he thought she’d lost. It came so naturally when she was protecting her friend. It made him so proud.
He went up the penthouse. It was a mess. Tony went to the bedroom and joined Steve. The omega's breathing was steady.
"You say that as if it were something simple," sighed Steve, leaning against the boxing ring. "Look at us, Tony. We're what she'll grow into. And we aren't the golden standard for mental health."
Tony looked at the pup on his chest. It seemed almost impossible that she was capable of destruction, but they’d witnessed her kill at only three years old. And she had crafted a bomb that killed several scientists.
"Stay the night. I'll call you a cab in the morning. You can even have my room there's a lock on the door if that makes you feel more comfortable," said Matt.
“I don’t want to fight you, Rune. I don’t think you want to fight either. I won’t fight, you not like this.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said. Then he smiled. His alpha needed some encouragement, so Steve leaned closer to him and whispered in his ear. “When you’re done, I’ll wear one of those lacy numbers you bought me. And let you rip my clothes off to see which one I chose.”
“It doesn’t matter. I mean it does, but not in this sense. You’re still the man for the job,” he said.
"Piper?" Tony kneeled beside her, touching her shoulder. She grabbed a shard glass and pointed it at his neck. The motion lacked hesitation and occurred in a fraction of a second. She was unaware of how the sharp glass carved into her own hand.
“You’re taking this awfully well, doctor. I thought you’d be more hesitant to take on Piper and Rune as your patients given how she reacted to Dr. Bloom,” said Steve.
Rune was in the kitchen with Pepper and Maria. They jolted when they heard Piper wailing. Rune knew that sound and knew there was nothing he could do to get through to her now. She had to work through it on her own.
The smell of ash and smoke clung to Steve's skin. The alpha did his best to cover Steve in his scent, removing the smokey smell. Tony held him closer, instinct and love mixing urging him to protect. Steve purred all the louder.
Winter went to the locker room. It was empty. He was thankful for the quietness. The showers turned on upon his entrance, and the hot water hit him perfectly. He moaned, enjoying one of the only pleasures in his life.
“It won’t be it just 948cc Austin A-series inline four-cylinder engine.” The twin Su carburetors only 43 horsepower and 52 lb-ft of torque powering the rear wheels. Not nearly enough power. All the additions would add some extra weight that they were still working on, cutting down more weight where they could.
"Heard muffled yelling upstairs but couldn't make out what it was about. But I'm guessing it was about me."
“Tony.” If it went any further it would lead to sex. Sex outside of heat was different it was clear, lacking the intense animalistic need. In time he would want it. But not now. He wasn't ready.
Piper reached out to touch it. Her fingers just went through the holographic image; it wasn't real. Winter was still there.
"That goes against everything we know about him, him saying that," said Steve. He noticed the sketchpad. "What's this?"
He wasn't going to allow just anyone near his daughter. Steve skimmed through Dr. Bloom's file. She was currently the head of psychiatry at John Hopkins and specialized in treating children. The woman had graduated from Harvard medical school. She seemed so young.
Her failure to comply earned another strike. That’s what she was a failure. Her hands fisted angered tear slipping down her cheek onto the floor. How had she sunken to a level of acceptance? An acceptance that was all she could have in her life.
"Bottling it up isn't the same thing as pulling it together. She'll explode again, and we may not be there when it happens," said Steve.
It would be faster to destroy the child's mind completely, but it would take years for Piper to recover. Edith’s record for turning an adult into a quivering puddle was twelve hours. A tough one could last eighteen hours with her.
“They will always be intense, but I don’t believe they will be at the same level as the previous one. This time around, you shouldn’t be feral for the majority of your heat,” said Edith.
Steve changed into his desert uniform. He paused before putting on his shirt. S.T.R.I.K.E team, especially if Rumlow a member of the assignment, would never let him live it down if he started lactating on assignment. He wrapped his chest before putting on his shirt.
Tony moved beside him, kissing him. Steve pulled away resting his head on the alpha's shoulder. Tony's arm wrapped around his shoulder.
“You're a person who knows something on everyone,” said Steve. She nodded. “Could you help me go through the list of alphas Hill compiled? I don't want to risk making the wrong choice."
Steve released the shield and took the inventor in his arms. He nuzzled against Tony’s neck, scenting him. Steve purred.
Clint kept to the back of the room, not wanting to risk challenging Tony. If Laura just recovered for such injury he wouldn't want anyone near his omega. “You know the nurses were fighting over who would give you a sponge bath," he said.
“What? Alright.” She lifted with him. Together they managed to lift it a few feet. It caused the rubble to dislodge further. A pipe cut into Steve's side. He dropped the weight.
“It's extremely important. You pull some kind of stupid stunt like this. It puts our stock at risk. What if this guy goes public?” said Pepper.
“Two beta nurses. Don’t know what happened to them. Don’t care either. One of them was a giant butt hole, hit me when I couldn’t fight back. And there was a peppery smelling alpha guard. He wasn’t there much, but he always wore a mask. So he had something to hide.”
She was moved onto a gurney and was wheeled away. They were taking her away from him. NO! Piper didn't want to be alone! From whatever room they took her to, she could distantly hear Theodore's heartbeat. Later, she was moved again. Finally, she was able to open her eyes. She was trapped in a giant white tube. There was an odd turning sound as part of the machine activated. It was too loud! She screamed.
"Please, don't ask if you're a good parent. You and Stark are amazing parents." Something she'd never thought she'd say about Stark three years ago.
In a little less than two weeks, Steve had lost twenty-five pounds. He’s terrified that 6’4, 240 pound super soldier would wear down to nothing.
Artie Shaw – He was an American clarinetist, composer, bandleader, and actor. Born on May 23, 1910. He was widely regarded as one of the finest jazz clarinetists. Shaw led one of the United State popular big bands in the 1930s to early 1940s. He had many hit records.
Hand in hand, Tony and Steve forced their way through the crowd of cameras. Steve blocked out the questions the best he could, instead, focusing on the shuttering sound of the cameras. When they finally got into the car, he burrowed his face into Tony's neck, pulling away when he could no longer hear the clicks of the camera.
They settled at the kitchen island. Steve was quick to snag an everything bagel and smother it in cream cheese.
“Don’t cry, sweetheart." This only caused a new flood of tears. He couldn’t smell the distress but Steve was nearing it. Steve's gaze was glassy. Tony tensed he’d seen this before.
Tony took out whatever was left. It was a pair of crochet baby shoes. They were white with little red roses on top with a matching hat. The shoes were so small they fit in the palm of his hand.
She opened up to him less than an hour ago, but now she was shutting him out. He’d have to wait for that chance to appear again. Maybe the next doctor would help her deal with what she was trying to hide. Until then, he'd have to be patient. Today was a breakthrough, though; so he had to be grateful for that. Now, he was probably going to watch Frozen for the hundredth time.
Tony waited for his mate to fall asleep before leaving the comforts of the nest. He couldn’t let the sensor problem go unresolved; he had to fix it now and left for the sanctuary of his lab.
Piper was drenched in sweat and panting. Darkening, lash shaped bruises patterned her skin. Bruises always appeared so quickly on her skin. Winter tossed her a towel.
He pressed his nose against the alpha’s neck, deeply breathing in his scent. The smell of their combined lust was so thick he could almost taste it. He yanked the alpha into the bathroom, quietly shutting and locking the door behind them.
“Where to start? He’s arrogant, egocentric, selfish, and a massive pain in the ass. But he’s improving,” said Natasha.
His view locked the Iron Patriot suit, soaring upward. He tried taking the air, but his thrusters failed him.
She instantly came to him. It was odd having someone take orders from him. Winter charged at the glass, snarling. The beta fell backward, chest rising and falling rapidly. The pup giggled. Winter liked the sound. It was something he didn't hear often.
“One of my favorite comfort foods. My mom made them for me and Bucky all the time,” said Steve. No matter how many of them Steve ate he never grew sick of them, which his mother was grateful for. It was a cheap and easy meal for her to make.
"Careful old-timer, you may pull something." Winter punched the glass, leaving a small scratch on the glass. "Someone is cranky."
"A TV personality got arrested for conspiracy, obstruction, and lying to a federal agency," said Tony.
The wires weaving through the fabric linked to several white clay-like blocks, which she assumed were C4. She'd never seen the substance in person. But she'd been taught how to make it. There wasn't a timer. Something clicked behind her and Piper whipped around.
Steve emptied his glass. It did nothing to take off the edge. They went through several more slides before stopping at one that read:
Steve playfully nuzzled against his alpha’s neck, purring. There was a shift in the alpha’s scent. It had taken on a more musky tone. Steve got to his feet and stretched. Steve smiled when he caught the alpha staring.
They got into the back of one of the cars. Chile’s S.H.I.E.L.D base was small, but it could accommodate them. The scientists were more than eager to watch over him. Every hour they took some kind of sample from him. Natasha wandered off with the promise of returning. They’d let him keep his phone. He flipped it nervously in his hand. If he called the alpha Tony would likely overreact. Being shot anywhere even somewhere nonfatal would cause exactly that reaction. Steve bit his lip. He could just say his mission ran over. It wasn't exactly lying, but he didn’t settle right with him. He called.
An orange glow traveled down Steve's neck. He cringed forcing down a groan. His hand clamped around the bed's railings. They creaked under the immense pressure.
Piper yanked the blanketing through the bars of the crib, wrapping them around herself. She sat by the glass wall waiting for Rune to get up. Rune woke up a few minutes later. She laughed at Rune's terrible bed head.
"If anything else happens in my absence, I'll make sure both of you spend the rest of your careers with this organization as experimental material. Understood?"
Steve leaned into his touch. The fear melting from his expression. Those blue eyes slowly fluttered open. He smiled sleepily.
Her eyes opened. She was pressed against Theodore’s chest. He was staring blankly at the wall. How long had he been up? Their breakfast tray was untouched. He hadn’t removed her, even once he’d woken up.
Considering it was Tony, this was mild. He was lucky the alpha didn’t put him in a pair of Ironman theme underwear. Steve laughed.
He grabbed the alpha by the arm, dragging him to the kitchen. Tony seemed more than happy being dragged around. The alpha took a seat at the kitchen island, while he searched for the fridge. Steve glared at the empty fridge. He hated having one, he enjoyed the simple comfort of having a full fridge.
He sent his sent the suit to the sky. It locked onto Air Force One's location. Taking out the single Extremis soldier. A large hole had been ripped in the plane people were being flung out.
Piper opened the iPad. She looked through the apps. There many weird programs, among them a lip-reading app. She paused on the sign language icon. It could be interesting, she shrugged to herself.
Steve sighed looking back at the man standing next. There were heavy bags under his eyes. Even in his exhaustion, Tony was only thinking about him. "First you should get some rest."
Bruce glanced at his hand. When? He hadn’t even realized. An alert went off on the monitor. He put down scepter, backing away from it. “Sorry kids looks like you won’t see my party trick after,” he said, walking to the monitor as if nothing happened.
"Children are easy. Adults are difficult. I used to babysit all the time for my neighbors when I was young. It wasn't always easy, Tony. You need practice. It isn't something anyone is instantly good at," said Steve.
It was a simple lock keeping the muzzle in place. Why didn’t he rip it off? He had the strength. She took a bobby pin for her hair. After several tries, the muzzle fell off. Piper kicked it away.
The phone almost slipped from his hand. His heart ached with hope. He bit the inside of his cheek, trying not to give in to the desire to trust that this was real.
She glared at her opponent. A nagging pained twitch at the back of her mind, making her wince as something truer to her tried to come forth. He struck. She barely managed to duck out of the way. He yanked his fist from the wall, causing chunks of cement to fall away. Fast and strong. The little alpha growled at her. She snarled right back, and chucked a large hunk of rubble at him, before taking to her feet. He chased after her, only a few strides out of reach.
"You can be angry, sweetie, but you can't let it take over." The blue glow fade from her eyes. She took a breath, closing her eyes. "Better?"
Tony went to the kitchen, grabbing bowls, spoons, Captain Crunch, and milk, then hurried back downstairs. Piper smiled brightly when he filled her bowl to the brim with the sugary cereal. It nearly overflowed when he poured in the milk. She happily ate a few spoonfuls, but she knew there was something behind this treat. Papa never allowed her to have sugar in the morning except for a sprinkle of sugar on grapefruit or on her Corn Flakes.
Steve nodded. They walked down the aisle military members stood attention saluting him. There were six, two from each branch. All the eyes were focused on him. When he saw his mate at the other end aisle.
“You saved my grandfather's ass countless times. The least I could do is try to help you in your time of need,” said Antoine.
Steve took a breath as he stretched after finishing his workout. He headed to the shower, giving Piper a few more minutes of precious sleep. Steve got dressed and crept into her room, only to find the floor littered with Legos and Hot Wheels. It was Piper’s attempt at stopping them from waking her. Steve hated stepping on those damn plastic blocks, so he carefully tiptoed toward her. Stacks of books were piled by her racecar bed and all he could see was messy tufts of hair peeking from under the covers. Her dark brown hair changed color in the past three years, becoming honey brown with golden highlights. It would probably darken, as she got older, as Tony's did.
“You shouldn’t have to do that. You shouldn’t even see me like that. No one should! Especially an omega!” yelled Tony.
A mist of cool water hit their faces. Large propellers emerged from the water. They chopped and turned it, before elevating that massive ship. Steve backed away as the powerful winds hit them. This was amazing. How could such a massive machine possibly fly?
He pulled away from his alpha. Steve took his shield from Natasha. She followed him to the bedroom. She took a seat on the closet bench.
Steve went to the bathroom. He swished the taste of vomit out. As they walked to the car, people were cheering for them on either side. He was grateful for the silence of the vehicle. When they pulled away from the sight of the cameras, he rested his head on Tony’s shoulder. Happy closed the window, separating, giving them privacy. Steve's face hurt from smiling.
"Even if you did these things have a way of coming back. They aren't meant to be suppressed," said Barny.
"Like I said there's no one for me to call. I lost parents when I was young," said Steve. He was alone.
Piper brought her limbs close trying to warm herself up. Her eyes widened when a blue glow traveled under her skin. Was she hallucinating? As the blue glow spread through her the cold vanished. She kept curled in a small ball, not wanting to reveal to her captors the change that occurred.
He about to retire when his phone rang at this hour it could be nothing good. Bracing himself before answering, groaning when he saw Fury’s number.
"I don't mind doing nothing." Actually, he rather liked it. He could people watch quietly or let his mind go blank, but blank in a pleasant way that he could control.
This was dangerous. A super-powered omega in a feral state. Steve's scent was overpowering, filling the room in seconds. Whatever he was expecting, it wasn't being caught in a bear hug. He pinned to Steve's muscular chest. Thankfully, Steve maintained control over his massive strength. Tony regretted putting on a shirt. He wanted to feel the omega's smooth skin against his. Steve rubbed his cheek against him, transferring his scent. Tony purred, hoping it would help. He ran his fingers down Steve’s back. They stayed like that for about five minutes.
It was an understatement. His inner omega was verging on haywire. He had to get out of here. An agent came running through the doors.
“In their final battle against the elephant seals, Theodore became separated from the group. He'd been tossed into a powerful current by a powerful hit from an elephant seal's fin. Days later he washed up on shore, missing a wing and his memory. And his friends believed he was lost for good."
“Well, I love being handed things,” said Steve, taking it from Phil and switching it out with Tony’s glass. Tony rolled his eyes and sighed.
"Tony, what are you doing here? I didn't know you'll show up." Howard waltzed to the mini bar, choosing a bottle of whiskey and pouring a glass after inspecting the label.
They all had a starry title in a big font which read ‘Captain America’. Steve smiled recognizing the hideous suit and the oh-so-familiar shield. He could still feel the weight of it on his arm, the smooth touch of metal under his fingers. He had been so excited to hold it for the first time when Howard Stark handed it to him.
"Anthony, I don't want you getting into any trouble and embarrassing me, so I'd like you to communicate with me." Tony bit down on his tongue, he didn't want to listen to this tonight especially. "I just don't want a repetition of--"
Natasha offered a hand to help Clint up who happily took it with sparkling eyes and smiled at her, their eyes locking while she pulled him up. “Maybe practise a little more with Sam and you’ll get the hang of it.” She couldn’t let the opportunity to tease him to go to waste.
Captain America was sitting in one of the two armchairs facing Fury’s desk with his hands clasped together and leaning on his thighs. He looked deep in thought, Natasha didn’t know what to say so she just sat down in the other armchair and Clint leaned on the back of it.
Fury walked with the captain and Natasha hung back and followed them behind, sneakily looking for her shoes on the way, but no luck she had no idea where she tossed them. Clint jogged up beside her.
"Your main target is Mr. Serafin Tudor." Fury got to the point and the old man's picture appeared on the screen. "He's an upcoming influential business man."
They were still looking up at him with hope and undying interest though, he couldn’t leave them hanging without an answer. Mrs. Wilson looked ready to intervene anytime and shoo her kids away.
Steve felt a kind of freedom running like no other. Thinking about nothing in particular, he could let go of the past, the future.
“Agent Wilson, you stay. The rest of you are excused, ya’ll stink like my mother’s summer shoes.” Fury ordered and they walked out, Agent Hill and Coulson leaving the other way.
“Not yet, now go!” she pointed at the stairs, but it was too late, the little girl noticed Steve. She had unruly hair and looked up at him with wide brown eyes.
Fury looked Clint in the eye and Clint did not like the shit eating grin on his face, it was subtle in a Nick Fury way, but it was unmistakeable. "Good luck, agent. Ms. Romanoff will fill you on the way." Fury started walking back to the window, entirely ignoring Clint's incoherent noises of distress. "Of course only if you catch your flight." he looked back at Clint over his shoulder.
His therapy was with a confidential woman called Beth Wilson. He had met her at Shield HQ already, but the woman deemed the atmosphere not ideal for the sessions. So she offered her home with her office out of question due to her colleagues.
"I just wanted to speak about your magnificent breakthrough with clean energy. It's quite the difference from the company's..." she looked for the right word. "Orientation." She smiled endearingly so it didn't sound offensive.
“Of course. You’re well respected, Steve. And the Wilson family has been related to Shield activities for a while now.” Natasha answered.
“Some would say…” Steve murmured loud enough to satisfy the twins who got even more enthusiastic about Steve being in their home.
Tony just swayed from side to side on the rest of the ride, staring at the ceiling, while his stomach filled with warmth when they hit the remaining stops, the lift managed to hit, before annoying Happy till a snapping point. Happy little victories.
Steve sped by him and turned towards the park, he didn’t look back, he could feel Sam being competitive and trying his best, running after him the best he could.
“Steve is one of my patients, you see, so I’d like if you didn’t disturb us.” Mrs. Wilson explained to her kids and put a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
“Don’t worry, if I picked up some juice, he’d wanted that.” Rhodey told Pepper the secret that Tony is just simply lazy.
“Nice to meet ya’ll.” She let out another huff of breath. “Is there any chance to find me something more comfortable, it’s been a long way and I want to get rid of this.” Carol swiped down her arms.
Natasha hadn’t any tasks for too long. With the whole super-soldier babysitting, the term stuck with her after Clint used it so much, she couldn’t leave the HQ. Nor was she given any missions, she didn’t blame Steve, but she felt kind of useless just sitting around.
Sweat was covering every inch of his body and Steve felt his muscles aching. He wasn’t paying attention to the exercises he was doing, he just thought about the Wilson family. He got angrier by the minute and there was no Mrs. Wilson to listen to him next week.
The next day Steve headed for Nick Fury’s office, he was going to be called in anyway, he wanted to get it over with. As he walked the corridors agents always nodded at him or some even let a small smile slip as a greeting, he returned the polite gesture every time. Right now though there weren’t as many people roaming this part of the headquarters.
She plopped back onto the bed and stared at the piece of paper for who knows how long, then she decided to take a shower. She scrubbed her skin, feeling dirty with too much blood on her hands.
Toni chuckled. "You are the biggest nerd I have ever seen, Rogers." This time the following silence was comfortable despite the cloying heat in the closet.
The day was torture. He took three runs that day, exhausting him temporarily. Even on his runs, though, he found himself thinking back to the note. He could see the smirk on Tony's face and the sparkle in his eyes as he wrote it in his messy engineer's script. He wanted the hands that so carefully wrote that note on his skin. He wanted the heat of those hands, travelling down his body, exploring every inch of him.
It had been exactly one week when Steve found a present waiting on the table for him as he made his way out for his morning run. It had no note besides his name taped to the outside of the white paper bag. Steve opened it and immediately snapped the bag shut again, face turning red in an instant. He flew back to his room, heart hammering in his ears.
Toni snorted. "Now I KNOW you're fucking with me." She had put her wall back up, emotions shuttering behind a false smile. She tried pulling her arm back.
Steve sighed. "I think I'd like that." He frowned in thought. "I don't know if I want anyone to know, just yet. Is that okay? Or is that selfish?"
Steve caught his breath. "You," he said, still giggling, "you, Tony Stark, are the dumbest genius I have ever met." Tony looked offended. "Shh. Listen. Do you think I would have kissed you back if I weren't at least a little bit gay? You're an idiot, Tony. Of course I like you."
Toni's brow furrowed and she began to approach. Stef waved a hand and brought out her inhaler, taking a moment to recover.
Steve blushed and rolled his eyes. He hated that, of all the things the serum would leave behind, he still blushed like a school girl. "No, Clint, just thinking of new battle strategies." With a roll of his eyes, Clint went back to his video game, yelling that Natasha was cheating somehow.
Stef's head whipped around. "What? You're not a...a….that." Her face showed shock mixed with...sadness? And that fiery anger was back, simmering behind it all.
Tony startled, clearly having been lost in thought. "Uh. I mean. That's really up to you, Spangles." Steve's face screwed into a glare. He hated that particular nickname. "I would like to date you. I don't know if you want that. I don't know if you want anyone to know that. I don't know what you want."
Toni laughed again. "Calm down, killer. That's a long list of people bigger than you are. Your lip is already bleeding." Before she could think about it, she reached out and rubbed her thumb across the cut on Stef's lip.
Toni leaned forward, hand cupping Stef's cheek. She searched her eyes for permission. Finding it, she leaned in for a quick, chaste kiss.
She didn't want Stef Rogers because she didn't want to sully her. She felt her very presence would ruin her - her damaged soul would chew Stef up and spit her back out.
He barely noticed Tony dropping to the couch beside him as he ran his hands over his face - finding bumps, bruises, and a trail of blood leading down from his split lip.
Tony's cock was perfect. Surprisingly large for a man as short as he was, red and beading with precome already. Steve felt his mouth grow wet at the thought of the cock laying on his tongue. He craved the taste of Tony, wanted him inside him in every way.
"So...so you're not kidding?" Toni whispered, breathless. Stef shook her head, blushing and grinning.
The next day, another present was waiting for him. An eyeshadow palette in a fancy box was inside the latest bag. This went on for another week, with Steve's collection growing by the minute. He found himself looking forward to his gifts instead of dreading them. At the end of the week, he had almost too much makeup to fit in the designated makeup drawer in his bathroom.
Stef slid down the door and back into her spot, not removing Toni's hand. She was silent, flushed red as she nervously moved her hand in a rhythmic pattern to calm herself.
That broke the tension. Toni gasped and broke into a high-pitched giggle which set Stef off as well. They both doubled over, laughing earnestly. "Fu-fuck you, Rogers," Toni gasped, "you look like a wet fucking cat."
He definitely didn't mean to stop and peruse the shelves. He certainly hadn't intended to leave with a bag full of makeup - and no shampoo. Such, he supposed regretfully, were the ways of stores. The stuff had called to him, after all.
The night hadn't really gone far beyond that. He and Tony had kissed for a while and Steve had gotten overwhelmed and scuttled off to his room. Things stayed the same for about a week - from the outside looking in, anyway. Tony had been spending an increasing amount of time in his shop and Steve hadn't been his usual self. He'd been avoidant and staying in his room more, worrying and overthinking.
He did and he felt his jaw dropping. Where there had been nothing before, there was now a beautiful table. It seemed to be all wood and reminded him strongly of the furniture he'd seen in the nicer areas back in the 40's. It had a collection of drawers underneath it. As he watched, a screen slid up from it. He saw himself in it and startled again as bright lights came on, showing him his reflection.
Toni sniffed in indignation. "YOUR closet? I'll have you know I've been crying here since Freshman year, honey. I claimed this Cry Closet, why are YOU here?"
Steve didn't release him. Instead, he began to laugh. Tony stared at him in shock and confusion. "What are you laughing at?" Tony asked incredulously.
So Steve did. He loved the weight of Tony's cock on his tongue, the taste of him. He had never been so hard in his life. He felt himself moan around Tony as he thrust a little bit.
Toni, for her part, was in complete shock. Stef was straight. Stef Rogers, the most moral person in the entire world, was straight. She didn't like girls. She definitely didn't like Toni-type girls. This didn't compute. Tony was reeling.
Such as it was that Steve found himself standing in front of the mirror. There was some bizarre comfort in the visage reflected back at him. His face seemed complete, somehow - lashes lengthened, eyes rimmed in kohl, cheeks barely rouged. He turned this way and that, allowing himself vanity for a brief moment. He smiled his dazzling show boy grin and then frowned. He added the slightest touch of color to his lips with a product he had found called a "gloss". It certainly leant less color to his lips than the lipstick the forties had had to offer. He looked less like a painted whore and more like a natural beauty.
Steve felt the pressure on his shoulder increase and he dropped to the floor fast. "Oh, Steve," Tony once again breathed, "fuck, you listen so well. I could tell you to do anything, couldn't I?"
Toni was shocked. "Pure Stef Rogers, cursing? Golly gee gosh, I never! Since when does the paragon of purity curse?"
Toni swallowed and looked away. "Whatever. You first. Why were you, the avenger of all injustices, crying?"
Stef reached out and grabbed her hand. She brought it back to her face and kissed it. "You don't know that." Her lopsided smile was back, her voice shy and timid. After a moment she released Toni's hand and dropped hers to her lap, looking completely mortified. She shrank into herself. "...I'm sorry, shit, I'm so sorry. Of course you don't like me," she stuttered, "I'm nowhere near your type."
He ran his tongue along the vein of his cock and listened to Tony's moan. He couldn't stand how hot that was, seeing Tony looking down at him flustered and in ecstasy. He felt the hand on his shoulder move to his hair, gripping tight and tugging until it was mildly painful. The hand pulled him forward, forcing him to take Tony down his throat.
Toni paused for a moment, imagining Stef in a slutty nun outfit and reminding herself to save the image for later. The silence turned awkward fast as the two girls stared at each other through puffy, red eyes. They surveyed the tear streaks down each others' cheeks. Toni's thick liner and mascara had smeared down her face, leaving tracks of black all the way down to her jaw.
Steve found himself averting his eyes and blushing. He was glad that it likely wouldn't show through the makeup. The compliment had lifted him up but he still felt the slight shame. He felt, deep down, that he shouldn't be wearing this sort of thing as a man. The conventions of the 40s, he supposed, never left him.
At 6:20, he finally managed to find a look he wanted to try. It was a smokey eye, done with browns along the edges and filled in the center with a vibrant, metallic blue. It was outside what he normally attempted, the dramatic winged black eyeliner concerning to him. He knew that things came easily to him as an artist, but he found his face as a canvas far more difficult than he'd thought.
Toni sat. You don't disobey Stef Rogers when she gives a command. "But...you're not gay. You're not gay. I shouldn't touch you. That's not okay. You don't even like me."
Steve nodded, seeing the heat in Tony's eyes as he did so. He did makeup for himself, of course, but tonight he'd done it for Tony. Every choice had been made with him in mind, right down to the blue shadow that complimented his eyes and the black mascara that might run later.
The reaction was immediate. Stef gasped and backed herself against the wall, eyes darting around the closet to find the interloper in what she thought was her space.
Toni preferred sex. She preferred a hard, fast relationship that left feelings out of the equation. She loved those relationships that left her feeling used and broken but left her emotions intact. Toni didn't believe in love - only pleasure and a strange form of self-flagellation. She was broken inside and she knew it. She was damaged goods and she treated herself as such. She knew she didn't deserve love; that she wasn't good enough.
“Anyone ever tell you you’re a darling?” Tony muttered, trying to breathe steadily and not move. Covering up his wound with nanoparticles was a wonderful idea (if only because otherwise he’d be long dead from blood loss), but they weren’t made for treating injuries, and it’s been more than five days. So right now Tony felt about as good as he did in the wonderful days of palladium poisoning.
“Since they showed… well, you know what on the news,” Sam answered, just as tiredly. “To be honest, I’m already past the stage of just worrying about his mental health.”
The UFO had a suspiciously familiar shape and was preceded by a rainbow trail. And either it was in such way expressing its opinions in regards to sexual minorities, or it had a direct relation to Asgard and its bridge.
But right now, when half the planet was gone in a single snap and the other half was trying to figure out for the third day in a row how to live on without it, he didn’t have much to do besides thinking. At least the streets were busy. The “decimation,” as the remaining journalists have christened it, lead to so many accidents and catastrophes that there was more than enough work for them all. And being around other people made it a little better.
Rhodey walked up closer and practically shoved her into Steve’s arms. The girl grasped the fabric of his shirt tightly, hid her wet face in the crook of his neck, and broke down into loud sobs.
Last time he was here was two years ago, but barely anything has changed. Apart from the fact that Rhodey held in his outstretched arms a desperately squirming dark-haired child.
“Not for long if we keep standing around.” Nebula pushed Steve away with dark detachment, dragging Tony along. “You got a doctor here?”
Steve gritted his teeth to stop himself from swearing. Of course it was Fury! Wouldn’t be the bastard’s first time. Besides, his phrase about not trusting Steve with the truth suddenly had a different meaning altogether. Back then he figured Tony was murdered by some government official, and Fury was afraid Steve would barge into the White House with a rifle.
“You never tried calling and asking for an invitation?” Tony wondered out loud and waved his hand, collapsing a repulsor glove back into a wristwatch.
“As if I could forget. I had a lot of news waiting for me when I came back from a mission. I had to ride three thousand miles on a bike, practically without stopping, just so I could yell at him about it.”
Tony thought for a moment, running through the possibilities in his mind, and then scrunched up his face.
That the old lady next to mournful Vision could easily be recognized as Wanda, and that the kid with tear-stained cheeks who stood a little to the side couldn’t be anyone else but the Spider from Queens.
“Quality work,” Tony agreed. “When I was hired as a consultant, I just had to start talking to dumbass generals again.”
“What can I do,” Tony shrugged. “Tell them that my restless spirit possesses you every night and forces you to tinker in the workshop. Everyone who remembers me will believe you.”
“He won’t answer to me.” There was a quiet rustle of fabric, as if Sam shrugged his shoulders. “He hadn’t moved for the past three days. He doesn’t eat, he doesn’t sleep, he’s just watching the news, or staring into the void when they show something else.”
“No way,” Tony said, eyes wide. “Don’t tell me that was Pete, that kid was knee-high, it’s been barely… Oh, shit.”
“We… listen, you weren’t here, but everything is really… complicated,” he admitted, looking over to where Morgan was stubbornly trying to walk with the help of Strange’s Cloak.
“He’s got a plan B. If he can’t frame you, Ross is planning to straight up murder you closer to the date, and hope the kid can still be… extracted. No matter what, you’ll be walking around with a massive target on your back in the nearest few months, putting all your efforts into staying alive. I’m not happy about it.”
And then got out the flip phone and pressed the call button of the only saved contact. There was no point in doing this, he knew. It would make far more sense to call Tony’s usual number, hear the recording of the familiar voice on the answering machine for the hundredth time in the past months, but…
“That was stupid. I assumed, for some reason, that you’ll follow the orders they give you, even though that was never your forte.”
“Stop clowning around. Both of us know that you have better things to do than playing catch with Ross.”
“That didn’t happen!” Tony exclaimed indignantly. And then remembered that said “year ago” was around the time when three-months-old Morgan stopped quite grasping the concept of sleep.
“Oh, quit the charade,” Peter snorted, making an impressive backflip to avoid getting hit by a falling tree. “I figured out you were alive, like, a year ago.”
“FRIDAY,” Tony smiled, dashing towards a fallen woman to help her up. “Tell Rhodey to watch his goddaughter. And also to tell the United Nations that an intergalactic war is coming.”
T/N: If you ever think translating stuff will easy because you're fluent in both languages, you're apparently wrong. It is a good exercise to see how languages differ from each other though... Anyways, this was fun! Thanks for reading!
“Well, there was a kid in an Iron Man mask. He raised his arm at the bot, and you shot from behind and told him he did well.”
“We’ll murder you,” Fury repeated, “and send you to one of SHIELD’s bases, complete with a lab and all the toys you might need.”
They looked at each other, their gazes brimming with love, but didn’t have the time to say much else: the door got thrown open, almost ripped off its hinges, and a happy, loud, restless and maybe just a tad unruly crowd flooded the room.
“I have instructions,” he said, finally. “But for now we have to kick Thanos’s ass. And get to the quinjet before Pepper shows up. She... isn’t thrilled.”
Just like that they made their way to the gangway and down. By the time their feet touched the ground, Tony had suspicious bright blobs floating in front of his eyes, which were most definitely not just the lights of the Avengers Compound, but he clenched his teeth further and tried to ignore them. The medical bay was within reach, just about... one hundred and twenty-seven meters ahead. He just had to focus on this wonderful pavement, and...
“I know, Tony. But I didn’t have the rights to ask, you know that.” Steve looked down. “We’re still not talking about it?”
“Tony gave it to me,” Bruce said simply, and Steve clenched his fists around the phone so tightly that the cheap material squeaked in indignation, “but that doesn’t matter right now, because you need to find Vision, or the world’s going to end.”
“A flip phone, seriously, it’s a goddamn nightmare,” Tony muttered under his breath, and then suddenly realized that there is strange clamor coming from the streets, panic and screaming. “Uh... Say, Doc, you wouldn’t happen to be moving your hair, would you?”
“What are you doing here?” Tony bellowed. Call him old fashioned, but he was convinced that aliens and kids should be kept as far apart as possible.
“Ah. You read a Wikipedia page on how omegas get all sad and sickly and depressed without their alphas?”
“Me.” Bruce Banner stepped out from behind the wizard and froze in place, his eyes wide. And then asked in a squeaky voice of a man who is on the verge of freaking out: “You’re officially dead? You have a KID? God, Tony, I’d ask in more detail, but the end of the world is coming, and we need to stop it.”
It felt as if someone poured boiling water on him. The hope which reared its head up a little got shot down again.
But the pause drew longer, and Tony was almost prepared to fake another fainting fit if he couldn’t think of anything to say in the nearest second, when Steve finally got up, approached the bed and carefully laid Morgan down next to him, resting her head with a mop of messy hair by Tony’s elbow.
“Nah. I’m not the one for optimism. They haven’t been in contact, so they must’ve...” Rocket snapped his fingers. “All I have left to do is to find Thanos and claw his throat out.”
Tony wasn’t home, Tony wasn’t on this planet, he was somewhere out there, among the endless space straight out of his nightmares, so far that Steve couldn’t help him.
Tony chose this moment to finally pass out. Get that, Doctor Strange – chances are, your one-in-fourteen-million-six-hundred-and-five reality probably didn’t involve Tony Stark’s inglorious death via internal bleeding!
“And inform all emergency services. Tell them to cordon off the street and evacuate the people. Quiet!”
“But you can help him, right?” Steve asked. Bruce didn’t answer, instead rushing towards the drawers packed with medicine and tools, getting out everything he deemed remotely useful.
The screen blinked and informed him of a voice message. “Play it back?”, the phone suggested with clear mockery despite the lack of an intellect driving it.
Inside, there was a shield. And on the shield, a sticker shaped like the Iron Man helmet, one of the assortment of stationery which Steve found himself buying around half a year ago, and which Tony began to use with exaggerated seriousness in any situation, appropriate or not. There were two words on the sticker, two words written in a handwriting familiar to the last stroke and curl.
“That’s exactly what’s happening, buddy,” Tony nodded, pointing him in the correct direction. “Run along now.”
This time the one dozing off on an armchair at his bedside was a clean-shaven Steve, whose chest served as a pillow to Morgan in a pink bunny rabbit onesie, and Tony’s heart swelled with amazed excitement at the sight. Which was, for all its wonders, utterly terrible, because the heart monitor blinked awake and proceeded to break out into piercing shrills, alerting everybody in the nearest vicinity that the patient is a few beats per minute away from a heart attack
Get Vision to Shuri. Destroy the Stone. Stop Thanos from bringing about the end of the world. Simple and concrete tasks, that much he could do.
“Later. Let’s just...” Tony shifted his hand a little, enough for their fingers to almost touch, but not quite. Steve nodded, not moving. “I feel great. Which is kind of weird, by the way. Why am I alive anyways? I’m not complaining, but I’m curious.”
“I lost it,” Steve answered just as hoarsely, tears prickling in his eyes. “I mean, I broke it first, then lost it.”
“Don’t try to scare me, Nicholas,” Tony rolled his eyes. “I would love to watch Ross try to frame me.”
“I already told you,” Natasha said, rolling her eyes ever so slightly, “I only pretend to know everything. But judging by the methods, Fury must have helped.”
“Again?” Tony rolled his eyes and then winked at Morgan, patting the space on the bed next to him with his good hand. She dashed to him, immediately climbing into his lap and hiding her face on his neck.
In thirty-seven seconds (exactly as an infuriated Pepper Potts appeared at the door) the quinjet shot up, successfully evaded a dozen fighter jets sent after it by Ross, and set its course to Wakanda.
“I...” Tony hesitated. He had a dozen answers at the ready. No matter what anyone says, everybody loves imagining how their ex... someone will crawl to them on their knees and beg to take them back, but when it comes to reality... Here’s Steve. On his knees. Not begging, of course, but asking, with that look in his eyes which turned Tony’s entire soul inside out, made him want to comfort, or... “What we never had a point? What if ‘we’ never had a future?”
“You don’t have a great track record when it comes to personal affairs, but globally it’s not that bad,” Fury shrugged, almost cruel. “You want some advice? Don’t think about Stark, don’t think about Barnes, and do your job.”
“Hi,” Steve said hoarsely, barely above a whisper. His hand was resting on Morgan’s back, keeping her from falling.
“Two it is,” Happy sighed, figuring it wasn’t worth it to start a fight with a kid. “Cap, how many do you want?”
He turned around so it would be easier for the girl to see him, and Steve found himself pinned down by the gaze of wide tearful eyes.
Call him back? No, he wasn’t ready for that. He wasn’t… he just couldn’t talk to Steve about what happened. Couldn’t talk about what was happening right now.
Which meant that he had a chance to get them all back, because they were never dead. Nebula told him that the Soul Stone, despite its name, ironically did not possess the power to actually destroy souls. So all those turned to ash by Thanos were currently residing in the bounds of said Stone and were, most likely, exchanging stories about their lives before “death”. Or not. They’ll tell what they did once they’re out of it.
“Dad’ll have two as well,” Morgan said. “Tony says he needs to eat a lot because he has a fast metabolism.”
“We’ll get some for everyone,” Happy told her instead of him, turning in the driver’s seat to face her. “Tony always loved them.”
Steve didn’t even look at her, although he probably should have. She was his teammate, after all, she returned from a dangerous mission, she…
“I do hope he’ll agree with you on that,” Bruce snorted. “Nebula’s in there with him, but you can swap places with her if you want.”
“Not really,” Lola responded, pulling up Instagram stories of the fearless New York citizens on the screen.
“Tony’s... alive?” Steve gulped. If Tony was alive and just gave the phone to Bruce so that he wouldn’t have to speak to Steve himself, it would be fine. But he still decided to try. “Could I talk to him?”
“Rogers,” the man said in return, making himself comfortable in the armchair opposite. “Heard you’re looking for the sniper?”
“Oh.” Tony grimaced, and then nodded to himself. “Plan B then. A desert island surrounded by force fields, counter-air defense in all directions. Eventually Pepper will get tired of both of them and become the supreme ruler of the galaxy, and then they’ll finally learn to behave.”
He took the flip phone out of his pocket with trembling hands and opened it with a familiar click, pressing it to his ear. His mouth felt suddenly dry, but he did manage to squeeze out one word.
“Yes,” Tony agreed. “Your dad shouldn’t have turned his right side to the enemy like that. But he’s a supersoldier, so it’s not like anything will happen to him, yeah?”
“I don’t give a shit, Captain Rogers. Use it as a dinner plate for all I care,” he answered, and disappeared behind the door.
The wall in front of them lit up with amber sparks. It was as if the air compressed and then parted, clearing the way for a man in a red cloak, a blue tunic, and with a heavy metallic pendant around his neck.
Bruce’s voice was suddenly really strange, not unlike that of Sam almost two years ago when he, evading Steve’s eyes, muttered “I watched the news, Steve, and... I’m really sorry, but Stark was shot at, and I think he’s de–“.
“And that’s news to you? She counted the floors with him, but he’s not the kind of guy who holds grudges, so…”
“And I can’t trust you with the truth,” Fury shrugged, and looked down at him sternly. “At least not while you look like a dirty hobo. Go take a shower, get some food, and stop scaring your people. They went after you, and you’re responsible for them.”
One wouldn’t think so if one knew anything about his lifestyle, but waking up in hospitals wasn’t a common occurrence for him. If he did, he’d usually be alone, sometimes – with an unimpressed Pepper for company.
“I am breathing!” Peter went quiet for a moment. “Mr Stark, you wouldn’t mind if I talk to you sometimes, would you?”
“You’ll have to re-make the shield. I want to watch Sam and Bucky play hot potato with it because neither wants to be the next Cap.”
“Peter,” Tony scoffed. “I’m not the one to police people’s language, but at least finish high school first, and then swear as much as you want.”
And then, likely, punch Strange in the face to teach him the ever important life lesson of “When your plans are this fucked up, you gotta tell others beforehand.”
“Sure you will,” Rocket rolled his eyes with a scoff. And then flinched suddenly, dug his paws through the multiple pockets of his jacket before getting out something not unlike a transmitter. “Holy crap!”
“The world needs Captain America, not Steve Rogers,” Steve nodded, and almost laughed. For the first time in the past days. More than that – for the first time in the past three months.
“Sorry, Mr Stark,” Peter muttered. “You’re just very… well, real. Do you really know everything that happened? Colonel Rhodes said you do.”
“Oh, crap.” Steve dashes to a sofa buried almost in full under a mountain of toys, which he and Bruce used to try to distract Morgan from scrutinizing her breakfast. He pushed aside a toy crocodile, then a shark, then a penguin, then a bunny, another bunny, a lion, a monkey, and...
“Yeah, yeah. By the way,” Helen grinned lightly, “please try not to knock anyone over when you run upstairs. We need doctors, not patients.”
“Did you ever wonder why Tony would fake his own death?” Rhodey asked. “That’s your daughter. Congrats.”
“Your what, Captain?” Fury sighed heavily and waved his hand, waiting for him to continue. Steve didn’t. “Past colleague?” he suggested politely. “Past friend? Past omega to your alpha?”
Steve wasn’t quite sure why she phrased her question like that. Still, judging by Rhodey’s face, it did have something to do with that.
“It doesn’t seem like it.” Fury rolled his eye up to the ceiling. “Hill will contact you in a couple of hours, there’s a mission which might need your involvement. Potentially deadly, you’ll like it.”
Peter Parker and Harley Keener, to Steve’s utter horror, became friends and officially announced themselves to be his daughter’s older brothers. Steve really hoped that Tony had a plan of action prepared for this, a risk assessment and a special fund at the ready to cover the costs of the consequences. For now he had to rely on Bucky and Sam, but those two were at times so distracted by their own squabbles that they could easily miss the second coming of the apocalypse.
Steve got up, leaned against Sam. They needed to go back. But Steve no longer had a home to return tp.
He and Nebula took four days fixing up the Guardians’ ship after a meteor shower. At that, most of the time was spent looking for the required tools among the piles of rubbish and rocks. And throughout it all Tony couldn’t help but think about how Strange saw fourteen million six hundred and five possible outcomes of their future, and still thought it wise to trade the stone for his – Tony’s – life. Which meant that the one successful outcome was relying on his active participation.
“Yes, that’s your dad. Look at how… dumb he is, Jesus Christ.” Tony grimaced, watching the screen. Steve, Sam and Natasha (a dream team, for god’s sake) were helping to disarm some terrorists in London. The prime minister wasn’t exactly thrilled, but at least they weren’t getting shot at by the police. Yet.
“Yes, Steve, Bruce Banner. We’ve got a problem, and we need you to find Vision. He’s in danger because of the Mind Stone, there’s Thanos, he’s a... Listen, you’ll have to trust me, because this will take forever to explain.”
“I figured that out through a lot of trial and error,” Rhodey shrugged, leaning against the doorframe. “If I were you, I’d hurry, because she’s starting to go red.”
“I reckon it would be easier to discuss at my place,” the wizard suggested. “I’m Doctor Strange, for the record.”
“Ross dreamt of getting a mini version of you for serum experimentation,” Rhodey explained. “And since you... well, you weren’t available, he’d have to make do.”
“And then he turned out to be all fluffy and innocent, and you couldn’t find a minute or two to catch me up to speed in the airport,” Tony scoffed.
“They grow up so fast. You look away for a moment, they’re already wearing superhero spandex,” Rhodey agreed. “So anyway, I don’t know how to cheer him up.”
“What I need are the sniper and the names.” Steve got up sharply, and felt dizzy for the first time since the serum.
Tony was gone, and that hurt the worst. Bucky, Sam, Wanda, Vision and T’Challa were dead, but at least Steve knew about it. Tony had been on an alien spaceship, and then – in Thanos’s hands. He could have been murdered in the battle for the Time Stone, he could have been turned to ash by the damned snap... he could have been alive and captured. Bruce and Rocket told him enough about Thanos’s “children”, those he picked up on different planets and twisted until they broke in accordance with his ruthless plans. Steve didn’t know which alternative scared him more.
“Safe and sound, currently where the New Asgard is going to be. I left the Valkyrie there, she’ll take care of them.”
“I figured. The last upgrade to my wings six months ago all but had his signature on it. But I wasn’t sure. And... well, he didn’t just do it all on a whim, and you...”
Peter’s voice sounded really unsure. Tony sat up on his bed, suppressed the urge to throw up, and activated the speaker.
“Cap, don’t freak out on me now, I’m not sure how much sedative to use on supersoldiers,” she said. “I wasn’t waiting for you, I just wanted to get some fresh air.”
“Alive,” he exhaled. He lifted his hand up without daring to touch Tony’s cheek, and then laughed in relief. “Tony, you’re... alive.”
“It said for the shield to be returned to you. I returned the shield to you,” Fury said, irritated, and walked towards the exit, his trench coat fluttering behind him cinematically.
Steve waited for Morgan to unfasten her seatbelts, offered her his hand, helping her down to the ground, and froze in place when he noticed Helen waiting for them outside the hospital door.
“Where did you get this phone?” Steve asked, trying to figure it out – Bruce was gone all this time, after all, and...
Steve flinched and glanced over his shoulder. There was no one behind him, but the girl kept reaching out towards the door.
“How would I know?” Rocket snarled. “You all look the same to us. They’re landing in four minutes, so see for yourself.”
“If he was the one who blew up the UN headquarters,” Steve said, frowning as if his jaw has suddenly started aching, “I’d be the only one who could stop him. He’s my responsibility, Tony. I had to.”
“Did you really know, or are you just pretending? Although, whatever… Spidey’s feeling down, Tony. Your death really shook him.”
He entered the Compound in uneasy anticipation twenty minutes later and furrowed his brows even deeper when he noticed Natasha waiting for him at the door.
“Okay, Tony,” Phil said, giving him a shadow of a grin. “Would you like to have direct access to missions of the Captain and his team?”
“Tony showed her some videos,” Rhodey shrugged. “And never shut up about him. Steve, you holding up there?”
“Yeah, I’ll refrain too. Thanks for your offer, but I’ll manage myself, as per usual. I’ve has years to practice being alone.”
“Does this SHIELD 2.0 of yours have a good sniper?” he asked after a minute’s silence. “They’ll have to try real hard to make it convincing without me actually kicking the bucket.”
“Yeah, no,” he shook his head, stubbornly attempting to get up to his feet. His stomach resonated with sharp pain, his organs shifting around as if in a lazy attempt at a dance, and he felt bile rising up in his throat. “I’m not gonna wait.”
“Yeah, well, after all that went down, Tony and I modified the Extremis formula a bit,” Bruce said. “We were just messing about, I promised him I’ll never use it. Lia-a-ar.”
“One chance in fourteen million six hundred and five,” Tony reminded him. “Did you punch Strange in the face yet?”
Steve threw his head back, felt the comfortable cool of the concrete wall against it, and took a long breath.
“Really? Well, you’d know better,” Rhodey nodded. “I gotta go. Mr Secretary of State wants a full report on this man who is no doubt very happy with his life.”
“Tony, I hadn’t told you that I love you in four months. And now it’s useless, I guess, but I can’t do anything about it. I love you, and I wasn’t ready to lose you… Well, you know I’ve always had problems with my past. And you… Tony, you were meant to be my future, why… I’m sorry. Nat and Sam are here, will probably chew me out for the metal bar stuck in my leg. I’ll call again.”
“There are a few other wonderful paragraphs about threats to civilian lives and taking the enemy’s side. In other words, they’ll frame you, sentence you, and send you to prison. Which I’m not sure you’d even survive, by the way.”
“Shouldn’t.” Bruce bit down on his lip. “But we haven’t tested the formula, so... Steve, if there was any other way, I’d take it. Given my... situation, I’m hardly a fan of thoughtless risks.”
“Hello, friend Steven,” Thor nodded regally. “Lady Natasha told us of little Morgan. Congratulations! A daughter is the greatest gift.”
“Fine. But if I call him from this number, he might get a supersoldier analogy of a heart attack,” he warned, taking the flip phone out of his pocket. The phone had twenty voicemails on it – one for each month after the first faithful call. Steve told him all about what had happened in their lives and consistently ended every message with “I love you”, which crushed Tony’s heart into more pieces each time. But Steve was on the run, and Tony couldn’t let the world know about Morgan. Not now, not when the Avengers weren’t together.
He wanted to call, but Steve wrote to call him only if he needs help, and right now he couldn’t help, not really. Tony hid the phone in his pocket and laced his fingers.
“Steve,” she sighed. “You were an enemy of the state on the run, and Tony was a dead man. Each one of you could have harmed the other. And besides, if he wanted you to know... he had your number, didn’t he?”
Despite the warmth of their first meeting, Morgan turned out to not be a very well-behaved girl. Yes, she called Steve dad, and she clearly knew what that meant, but she as was stubborn as a mule, never letting herself get distracted or convinced.
“No,” Fury scoffed, not letting him finish. “He’s a complete moron, but he’s a predictable moron whose plans I know in full. Which is why I’m planning to make a plot to murder you instead.”
“We have those, and they work in secret, as was always intended. The current director will help you.” Fury nodded, more to himself, as if he was simultaneously leading a difficult conversation in his mind. “He isn’t new to handling you. And you would be there for as long as you’ll have to be.”
But for now Tony had the final round ahead of him: find the way to get everyone back, to locate Thanos, to kick his ass and to take back the Stone, and then perform said way in practice.
Just in time, too – a bunch of not exactly friendly looking folks suddenly teleported on Manhattan’s 43rd out of a flying doughnut. And Tony’s hands itched to kick their asses.
“I tried,” Steve nodded. “And I’m down for retirement. Someone else can deal with the next big bad... Crap.”
Morgan looked so much like him. She had his dark hair, his attentive brown eyes, his curiosity and penchant for experimentation. She got her somewhat impressive stubbornness from Steve, but everything else... God.
Rocket ran his fingers over the electric blue projection of a keyboard, glowering at the stream of symbols Steve didn’t understand.
“Last time I tried to talk to him about ‘well, I know what’, he ran off to a different country in a minute and thirty-six seconds. Not exactly effective… and anyways, you’re the part-time therapist here.”
“Yes,” Fury agreed. “Is that fair to you? No. Will it make your life easier? I doubt it. Will anyone thank you? Hardly.”
“I’m furious at him. No, I’m even more furious than before, because he is a complete moron, who… I’m not talking to you about it.”
“I’m never trusting my fellow scientists ever again,” Tony sighed heavily. “Although I’d do the same thing. We need to prepare for the battle against Thanos.”
Tony hunched his shoulders, looking down, his fighting spirit gone in an instant. A sunray refracted through the table, illuminating chaotically and infinitely moving specks of dust. The reality of Brownian motion, a contribution to physics made by a botanist and a surgeon’s assistant, which suggested, aside from the obvious, that people should pay more attention to details and specifics.
“This was a man with a sniper rifle in an office building in the middle of the day,” Steve said. “Not a ghost, not a wraith, not even the Winter Soldier. Find him.”
“I’m stressed!” Rhodey complained. “You ever try being stuck in a closed environment with a member of the Stark family who’s very unhappy about the fact you can’t give her what she wants for three days straight? And what she wants is Tony. Well... Steve works, apparently.”
Steve shut his eyes for a moment. The familiar name pricked at his heart with an icy needle, a week-old scene replaying in front of his eyes like a broken record: a half-molten iron gauntlet encrusted with Infinity Stones, and Tony, who no longer looked alive. And then… he still didn’t look alive, but his body lit up from the inside with Extremis, its abilities stretched as far as they could go.
Maybe that was his and Tony’s greatest difference. Tony wouldn’t be surprised right now – after all, he kept telling them all these years that they weren’t ready, that they need to be better, that they need to be together. Would they have won if they were together? Maybe. Maybe not.
“I doubt he faked his death for the entertainment factor of it.” Natasha lifted her chin up to face him. “Tony can think whatever he wants about me, but I didn’t do anything that could harm him.”
Dear god. Tony was bleeding out on the pavement between 106th Street and Madison Avenue, and people kept filming. Tony was dying, and Steve was asleep on the other end of the world, and his heart didn’t stop beating.
“No,” Tony purses his lips. “To sum it up, we’re both idiots. So knowing about the precious bean which is Morgan wouldn’t have changed anything.”
“Hilarious,” Tony rolled his eyes, then deciding that they’ve both had enough of this for today. “But it happened the way it happened, and I... want to fix everything too. I think.”
“Unsanctioned entrance, boss, my safety protocols are being overridden,” FRIDAY informed him before shutting down. Doors slid open with an almost silent rustle, and a man in black stepped inside the room.
Because a few feet ahead of them was Steve. Steve, alive, not crumbled into ash, Steve, whose fate Tony tried not to think about for his own mental stability’s sake, although he kept waking up from an old nightmare with a dead man’s words ringing in his ears. “We lost, Tony. It’s all your fault. Why didn’t you do more?”
“Yup. Really convenient. Thanks to nanotechnology I can fold it up and keep it in my pocket, which... would be very useful if I had a physical body.”
“Tony,” Steve shook his head, “you can’t think that. Our future is sleeping right next to you. She’s here because we were together. And she... I never thought I could love anyone that much.”
“You know most of it anyway, and if you don’t, you can probably guess,” Fury shrugged. “The guy’s crazy over supersoldier serum, but he wouldn’t dare prick the Captain with a needle. And now he has an opportunity like that.”
“Really?” Tony gasped, pulling her closer and kissing her on the forehead. “I always knew I can rely on you.”
“So what do you suggest? A secret mason plot to murder the Secretary of State? Can’t say I’ve never thought about it, but–“
“A strange question. I’m sure agent Simmons runs to you with reports the moment I’m out of her door,” Tony snorted.
“Never,” he shook his head stubbornly. “I’d tell you if I knew earlier. I think. I don’t know. To be honest, the first few weeks I... couldn’t believe it. But even if we knew, would it change anything? You’d still make your choice between Barnes and... the rest of the world.”
“Is everyone on your planet an utter moron?” she asked, as Tony finally managed to take an almost upright position.
Steve stopped listening. He scooped Morgan up in his arms and bolted down the hospital corridor, which he managed to do without causing any injuries, but that was mainly because everyone else was wise enough to jump out of their way. Including a ninety-year-old man.
