He'd not spoken to Sherlock since that day in his office, curt and to the point. He'd expected Sherlock to make full use of the open channel, but the secure phone remained silent. No more coded letters came his way. In fact, John could almost believe that Sherlock had listened to his plea and kept his distance.
Addict: still written in the story of his skin. Scars he couldn’t see from fights he couldn’t win left silver smears in his mind’s eye. Capillary in left eye fractionally enlarged – the only outward sign of trauma from an overdose. Skin a touch too pallid, cheekbones too prominent. Too many missed meals over the years. They left their mark as clearly as any needle diving into his skin. The body clung to its accusations for years, and there were days when all he could see was his own, personal crime scene.
'I somehow doubt it was your moral code that stood in the way of providing it to them,' he murmured, his mind racing. Was she aware that they had retrieved the copy of the file from the AGRA USB stick? Did she realise they had decoded it, or did she linger in ignorance? Either way, he would not be the one to tell her, and a warning look in John's direction urged him to hold his silence. Best not to push her into drastic action. Mary was both competent and volatile. If she felt she had been backed into the corner and lost every last bargaining chip, there was no knowing what she might do.
John laughed at that, shaking his head. There was no argument he could offer. Him and Sherlock had faffed about for far too long, dancing around each other and never communicating how they felt. It had all seemed too much - the risk of ruining their friendship an insurmountable threat, back then. Now, John could look back and see they didn't really have a choice in the matter. Him and Sherlock had been falling together since day one.
He lunged for a pencil, grabbing the blank envelope as he surveyed John's missive in a new light. Yes, there. Some spaces were bigger than others, denoting where the code for one letter ended and the next began. Hastily, he decrypted their missive, laying bare what John had really wanted to say.
'Where's Rosie?'
‘God, you look awful.’
'What about you?'
Mrs Hudson's voice reached his ears, her bright peal of laughter making Sherlock smile despite the nagging ache in his leg. She had been home within hours of his and John's return, glad to be back in the sanctuary of Baker Street and delighted to see them both.
Mirrors had their function: a quick way to check his hair was behaving and that he had nothing stuck in his teeth. However, as a rule, Sherlock tried to avoid looking too closely at his reflection. He saw too much. Always had. How others could stare into a looking glass and see only skin-deep, he had no idea. Frankly, the last thing he needed was to allow his analytical mind free reign to dissect the facts of his life from his appearance: especially when knowledge of the truth added its own, bitter confirmation.
After all, he had Sherlock in his life and in his bed. Who could ask for anything more?
Sherlock raised one eyebrow, thinking over the brief video call. It had given him a wealth of information into Norbury's physical and mental state, but he could not quite put his finger on the moment that he had realised the most likely identity of the go-between. Instead, it felt like the culmination of a hundred small observations falling into place. There were still pieces missing; he did not yet have the whole picture, but every single facet pointed to "O Dio" being Mary Morstan.
'Yes please,' he murmured at last, rubbing at the ache that sparked beneath his temples. 'How long have you been up?'
'Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, Mr Holmes. Being champion comes with its own difficulties, as I'm sure you know.'
'Hush, you. Want more beer?'
'Okay. I'm sorry I couldn't do more.'
He pretended not to notice Sherlock stiffen as he marched into the kitchen, viciously shutting down everything in his mind but thoughts of Rosie. It wasn’t healthy, but right now it was all he could do. Falling apart would not help his daughter, nor would his anger find a deserving target in the room. Sherlock would take none of its burden: of that he would make sure. He'd already suffered John's temper enough to last a lifetime.
He kept an ear out for any sounds of distress from downstairs as he worked. He half-expected John's cry, and with every moment that peace reigned, he found himself growing increasingly tense. By the time he had finished in John's room, he sat on tenterhooks, almost shivering with the need to check that John still slept soundly.
Something was off about him. A black flat cap rested on brown hair, and a woollen coat fell to rest at his hips. The clothes beneath were smart; he dressed well, though not as well as Sherlock. The sunglasses covering his eyes were the biggest giveaway. On an overcast day, they stuck out like a sore thumb, and John let his gaze drift over him before he began his walk back to the surgery, lunch in hand and butterflies in his stomach.
' Sherlock's fingers covered his knuckles, and he looked up into that clear gaze, unshadowed by dimming consciousness. 'It's just a scratch. I expected it, but his reach exceeded my estimate.'
'Your concern does you credit. I do not think the danger to Rosie is overt, but the value of what you and Sherlock uncovered puts her at risk. She could become a tool in someone's plot to gain your cooperation.'
Wasn’t he?
He paused on the first step, the wood creaking under his weight as he glanced over his shoulder, back at where his coat hung like a reaper's cowl. Stiffly, moving more like an automaton than a real man, Sherlock reached for it, pulling John's brief missive from the inside pocket. The paper crumpled in his grasp, and he bore it up the stairs and into the flat.
'Mycroft won't let anything happen to her.'
The chase was on.
John's mind raced. His heart thudded, caught between joy and terror. Something had finally happened between them. After all this time, they’d moved beyond the realm of friendship, but would Sherlock change his mind? Would he decide it was all some kind of mistake?
It was a slice of silent, unquestioning companionship, the rare kind that he'd missed so much when Sherlock was away. Now, despite the fever ravaging him, John found himself grateful for another stolen moment. A memory he could preserve in the amber of his mind.
Sherlock dug in his pocket, holding out a USB stick. ‘Take this. The only thing on it is a nasty virus, but it could buy us some time. Go out the front door and grab a cab: don't bother with discretion. We have friends watching us as well as enemies.'
Sherlock grinned, and just like that, the colour of the world rushed back in. Life with Sherlock might be challenging in many ways, but it was never, ever boring.
'They're on their way,' he said as he hung up. 'It won't take long. They're only at Millie's place, which is a couple of streets over. We just need to make sure he doesn't vanish in the meantime.’
'We'll get you sorted,' John promised, secretly glad to see the DI so hopeful. The divorce had been a while ago: a new wound when John himself had first limped into London, as far as he could tell.
'Not for anything?'
'I don't care,' John muttered, his words brutal with chilling indifference. His eyes narrowed, his shoulders rolling back as he relaxed, falling into that soldiering stance Sherlock knew so well: legs spread, feet planted, and his aim rock-steady.
It had become an hourly ritual when John did not lie in sleep's shallow waters. Excessive, perhaps, but John did not call him out on it. No doubt he understood the information gave Sherlock the illusion of control, and besides, the data had its uses. The frequent readings were joined by the output from the oximeter: O2 saturation and pulse rate.
'John?'
'I'd be delighted, John, dear.' Mrs Hudson cast Sherlock a fond, knowing look. 'It will do you both some good.'
'Did you ever love him, or was he simply convenient?'
'But she will.' John glanced at his watch. 'Mycroft should be getting that evidence soon. I doubt it will take long for Mary to figure out her list has been compromised.'
For one brief, impossible moment he considered blurting it out there and then. Letting the truth escape his lips in a rush of "I love you", but reason held sway.  He wasn't strong enough for the conversation and all the possible ways it could go, not yet.
'What did you do to Molly?' He scuffed his shoes over the tarmac, resenting its hard surface. There was no way to leave footprints or any sign of his passing, and he did not even have anything he could drop in his wake as a clue. He should, in retrospect, have been better prepared. It galled him that Mary had been able to get the upper hand.
He could pretend to be married to Sherlock. He wouldn’t have a problem with that, in public at least. It was returning to platonic friendship behind closed doors that would give him grief. But then, when would he get a chance like this again? To live his wildest dream, just for a little while…
'You do that.' John stood back as a sleek black cab pulled up to the curb. The door swung open beneath Greg’s touch, and he watched the DI settle in the seat, giving instructions to his place. ‘Bye, Greg.’
'Wait. Can you sit for a bit?' Sherlock guided him towards the living room, easing him down into the familiar nest of his armchair. A blanket surrounded his shoulders, and he clutched it gratefully. 'I'll get you some water and some paracetamol.'
It was a hurricane of more emotion than Sherlock dared to categorise. He could feel the force of it shaking every inch of John’s frame, ripping itself from him like foulness purged from a wound. Nothing he could say would ease his pain. Nothing he could do would make it easier. He could only stand there, offering gentle touches and silent support as he let John ride it out.
Setting off, he made more than one wrong turn in his effort to find his way. After more than fifteen minutes of wandering through unremarkable corridors, he found a campus map on one of the walls.
'I believe that, if anything, you were no more than an axillary associate to these people. You were not their main point of contact nor their primary focus. There was someone else wasn’t there: a middle-man? After all, obtaining national secrets in your position was easy, but getting in touch with a buyer without putting yourself at risk? That would be vastly more challenging. You stood to lose far too much in such an endeavour.'
'Any cough or difficulty breathing?'
Now it was his turn to stroke his fingertips over the fragile vault of John's wrist. Perhaps in better moments, he would have thought to take his pulse, to seek out data to confirm or refute his assumptions, but such logic was beyond him. It did not even cross his mind. Instead, he could only clear his parched throat, his gaze flickering back and forth over John's features. 'I would be yours, if you would let me.'
'No.' John swallowed. 'I want to see you.'
Despite his lack of appetite, he had emptied his bowl and polished off a mug of coffee before Sherlock emerged, looking tired and bad-tempered. No doubt the wheel-chair did not help his mood, but a faint smile twitched the corners of his lips when John approached. 'Everything all right?'
They were a fool.
The coach, a wiry man in his fifties, offered a raised eyebrow in challenge as Sherlock and John lingered at the back of the room.  However, when he sauntered over, there was a cautious smile upon his face, and Sherlock's explanation soon reassured him.
‘God, yes.’
'As they should. It's a pity they don't have enough for the rest of us.'
She kept thinking back to the year or more that Sherlock had been… gone. Not dead, thank god, even if everyone had thought that was the case. It had been awful. She’d not grieved him. Not really. Not beyond that steady sadness that came from something unfortunate happening to someone she half-knew. Instead she had watched everything slowly fall apart around her.
She learnt from her mistakes.
here was never a second chance to make a first impression. As if he would want one.
John scrubbed a hand over his face, letting out a shivering breath before offering Rosie a weak smile. She was playing with a book made of felt, sucking on it with single-minded purpose. Since there were no choking hazards, he left her to it. At least one of them was happy and secure in their little world. For John's part, he felt as if someone had pulled the rug out from under his feet.
It was a hand-held sound recorder, like the kind city types used to take memos on before smartphones did everything for them. The green LED meant it had power, and the strange static and occasional note played on repeat.
'Molly, I'm glad I caught you.'
'You know Sherlock, John, and so does Mary. You are no doubt both firm in your belief that Sherlock will not surrender whatever he has of the file. The only thing that could pressure him into acquiescence would be if your life were in danger: a course of action she emphatically declined with that little display.'
'What now?'
The question whispered between them like a prayer in church, little more than a hint of words shaping the air. All around them, life continued. The fridge hummed its gurgling harmony and the tap let loose the occasional drip into the kitchen sink, but to Sherlock it felt as if time had stopped.
'Come on,' John clapped him on the shoulder. The contact sent a jolt of shock down Sherlock's spine: unexpected. 'Up you get.'
Sherlock's dense silence lasted for several long moments before he finally replied. 'Yes, and you saved me in the process.' He tightened his grip on John's hand, offering mute support as he continued to speak. 'Mary had painted herself into a corner. There was only one possible way out of it. Mycroft would never have given her the file, and she would not have backed down. Without your intervention, she would have pulled the trigger and seen it through to completion. Not a victory for her, but not one for you and Mycroft, either. A no-win scenario. We could all see that, and you took the only course of action that could alter the outcome.'
Sherlock brushed his knuckles over his right eye before reaching for John's wrist, applying gentle pressure so that he tilted the page towards the light. 'John, you're a genius.'
'He said he'd rather –' Molly swallowed, her eyes agleam, as if she could barely bring herself to be the messenger. 'That he'd rather have anyone but you.' The strength seemed to leave her, her voice trailing off to a whisper. 'Anyone.'
That was why he was on his way to meet Mycroft. It was why he had reached out to his brother for help in the first place. As much as he and Mycroft may chafe against one another at times, his older brother had never yet turned down a request for assistance from Sherlock. Perhaps he knew that the first time he did so would be the last time Sherlock ever asked.
It all meant nothing to John, who could only see what looked like about a dozen people, all of whom had far more skill with a sword than he could ever hope to possess. Even those watching from the stands, sat in their white kit and awaiting their turn, observed with a practiced eye. He wished he could see what they saw – what
John raised an eyebrow at his tactical retreat, turning back to Sherlock and folding his arms. ‘What was it?’
‘Of course. I was just leaving.’ Mycroft shot a sharp glance at Sherlock, but if he had anything further to say, he bit it back. Mycroft was not accustomed to even mild humiliation. No doubt he would be wondering how much John had heard of their conversation for weeks, and Sherlock smirked as his brother practically fled the room.
A faint noise, like the crackle of electricity, tickled his ears. The power around his neck slackened just enough for him to suck in a breath and push away the dark edges that clouded his gaze. His head thudded in time with the furious slam of his heart, but there was something else, something low and deadly that he couldn’t see or hear, but sensed all the same, right down in his bones.
‘I’m sure Greg will be delighted with your thoughtfulness.’ Mycroft’s muddy blue eyes gleamed. He did so love to get the last word, and once again, he’d succeeded. ‘Goodbye, Sherlock.’
‘John!’
John had to make the most of it.
John watched the last of the blood drain from Norbury's face, leaving her as pale as the wall behind her. 'She could not do so without condemning herself.'
How did saving Sherlock serve Mary?
‘What are you?’ He hissed, his finger shifted on the trigger. ‘Calescor? Brumite?’ He wet his lips, struggling to remember the names that had long since faded from all but the edges of human memory.
'An old war memorial. Infrequently tended, but packed with names. None of which appear to pertain to Ms Morstan.'
The pressure of Sherlock's teeth bleached his full bottom lip, pinched and lush. A gloss of sweat stuck tendrils of curls to his brow, and passion painted his pale skin in tones of pink and red. Those all-seeing eyes were screwed up tight, that brilliant mind lost to sensation. It made John feel peacock proud to know that he, of all people, could reduce Sherlock to this – could bring a different kind of furore to the diamond sharp mind and lose himself in ecstasy while doing so.
'I'm working on it, John, I swear, but you know how it is. The government's full of liars and they're prioritising what tests we do have to ICUs.'
Despite all John's expectations to the contrary, Sherlock treated Rosie with upmost respect and something that bordered on honest affection. He spoke to her as he might an adult, but without any of the harshness that so often limned his other conversations. It had not occurred to John before that Sherlock might miss her.
He settled Rosie in the middle of the king-size mattress he had claimed as his own, making sure she couldn't roll off as he set about getting her clean and dressed for the day. It was a fumbling chore of fiddly little clasps and her happy squeals as he tickled her, smiling despite himself. It was a distraction: a way to step back from his breakdown in the kitchen. His therapist would have given him that look: nothing so obvious as blatant disapproval, but he could imagine the hint of sadness in her eyes.
Norbury looked as if she had sucked a lemon, all sharp lines of disgust. Her eyes flashed as she leaned back in her chair. 'In that, I am afraid I can offer you little in the way of enlightenment,' she retorted. 'As far as I was aware, Mary never intended to return to these shores. She was done with Europe entirely. I cannot fathom why her resolve crumbled so swiftly. In my experience, she was never prone to weakness.'
'There is a difference between putting a person – with human faults and foibles – on a pedestal, and this situation. Mary lied to you by omission. She built up an image of herself that was what you needed to see at the time: an image that you fell in love with, and she subsequently failed to live up to. I don't think you can be blamed for that.'
Sherlock grimaced, shaking his head. It felt unfair to cut Mary's motivations down to the bare essentials, but there was no avoiding it. Love may have had a role, but in the end Mary's driving forces for marrying John had been far more prosaic. She had wanted a husband, and John had needed someone in the wake of Sherlock's "death". They had fulfilled the roles each other needed. For the time Mary and John had together, it had been enough. Would their marriage have survived another five years? Another three?
'Thanks, Daphne. I'll call them in.' He pressed the button that would signal for the patient to head for his office, shuffling Sherlock's letter out of sight before turning to his computer. Normally, the relevant file would be queued for him, but the only response to his hopeful key presses was a blank screen. The system hadn't frozen. He could still go back and forward throughout his appointments. It was merely this patient's information that remained stubbornly empty.
'The idea is a stretch,' Sherlock conceded, 'but it's not without merit. It's certainly better than anything else we have to go on at the moment.'
'Now you're just doing it on purpose. Making it sound kinky when it's not.'
'Do you intend to have Rosie with us when we speak to Norbury?'
A sob scraped up John's throat, and Sherlock flinched as Rosie joined her father in his tears. John's were silent: great, shuddering things as he pressed his hands over his face, trying to hide. Sherlock dithered before scooping Rosie from her high chair and cradling her against his chest. She clung to him with banana-smeared fingers, but gradually his warmth and gentle shushing eased her fear: more likely brought on by John's shouts than anything else. She, at least, was easy to comfort.
There were exceptions to the rule, of course. Out there, beyond the large windows offering him a view of the street, he could see two others, motionless like stones amidst the swirling currents of London's chaos.
‘Right, so…’ John rubbed a hand over his forehead. ‘Red’s the north side. “4” is the column.’
Another sob caught in John's throat. He'd longed to hear that time and again, only for death's silence to be his only response. This was not real. It wasn't. He
'Norbury.' Sherlock dropped his hands to his side, grunting as he struggled to his feet before stretching out his palm to help John rise from the floor. 'We talk to Norbury.'
'No, they're more military than that.' Sherlock ran his thumbnail over his own lip, his gaze losing some of its focus as he considered the evidence. 'Or at least combat adjacent. The people watching you have a soldier's bearing, and their base was set up like a military operation. They are a unit, much like AGRA in many respects, though their
John swallowed, weaving as he staggered towards the dark vehicles waiting at the periphery of the industrial estate. 'Sherlock. She's probably trying to get to him.' He blinked, screwing up his eyes and attempting to clear the haze at the edge of his vision even as his thoughts drifted and scattered. 'We have to do something.'
'Shit, your leg.' He ushered Sherlock towards the sofa, ignoring all his protests. 'Lie down,' he ordered, falling back onto practicalities like a drowning man finding a lifeline. This – the simple regimen of care – he could cope with. It was a problem he could solve and offered a blessed distraction from his own troubles. Besides, he felt the need for a little distance and space. Part of him longed to linger at Sherlock's side, but he had never been good at accepting the help of others. Even now he feared that Sherlock's patience with him would soon wane, and he would pull away from John's turmoil.
Sherlock made a noise of disgust, rolling his eyes. 'Odio, not O Dio.' He looked at John. 'It's Latin for hate: a matching pair to go with Amo.'
'And you,' Sherlock added. 'You are as innocent of Mary's actions as Rosie herself. The guilt, such as there is, belongs to Mary. Do not think otherwise. Do you understand?'
John pressed the green button on the listening device, holding it to his ear and hearing Mary's voice, crystal clear. 'That's a shame,' she replied, apparently unconcerned. 'I hope he is not badly hurt.'
They exceeded them.
Sherlock watched John where he sat in his armchair, a cup of tea on the table at his side and a novel open in his hands: some popular fiction. Something trite and requiring little in the way of intelligence to enjoy, which was just as well. There was no denying the fact that John was not at his best. Even now, he stared at the book, but he had not turned the page in quite some time.
'Yeah, well.' John grimaced. 'Maybe she wants them to miss something. Fuck it up somehow?'
The question was, where to start?
The breaking fever was a positive step, indicating a victory won within the bloody bastions of John's body. Though the threat of complications had not yet passed, the possibility diminished with every passing hour, and for the first time Sherlock felt the burden of his anxieties ease.
Weakly, Sherlock did as he was told. He had got it all wrong; he must have done. Why else would John look like that? Angry but not? Sharp and desperate in a way Sherlock could not begin to understand?
'William Sterling.' Phil pointed him out, a boy of below-average height with sandy brown hair. 'Look, I know these kids. I don't think any one of them could do that to Millie, not even Tomas.' He shrugged, scratching the back of his greying head and offering an apologetic shrug. ‘I think you're barking up the wrong tree.'
John knuckled at his right eye. 'They're just things,' he repeated.
'She glossed over some aspects. She did not wish to admit that the information she had in her possession amounted to treason, did you notice? She doesn't want you to think ill of her.'
Still, it was a price Sherlock found himself willing to pay. Once, friends were an alien concept to him. Now?
Together.
'Wine, if you're having it.' John straightened his shoulders, seeming to come back to himself as Sherlock poured a glass of chianti. 'I've been trying not to but...'
All the while he had done his best to persevere, to keep his wedding vows and build a better future. One that, now, he knew, was doomed to failure from the start. Despite everything, it was as if a great weight had dispersed, leaving him free to breathe and feel and live.
John drew in a deep breath. 'Your medic gave me the all clear. I've got no persistent issues with vision; my hearing has cleared and I've no broken bones or openly bleeding wounds. I can handle this.' He angled his head to the west, in the rough direction of the airfield. 'Trust me. Now, what's the plan, Mycroft?'
'The question is,' Sherlock said as he reached for his phone, 'what is it Mary wanted to remember, and is it still there?' He copied out the coordinates, his brow pinched tight as Google Maps spat out its verdict. John leaned in, peering over his shoulder.
'Yes, the basics, but... Well, the documents I did find are forgeries. Things that claim that the body was referred to the coroner, which never happened – that kind of thing.' There was a whispering sound, perhaps Molly running her hand through her hair, and when she spoke again her voice had lost its quick, professional tone. 'John, I'm so sorry. I didn't even think...'
'And perhaps that's how it would have stayed, if not for Mary's sudden reappearance, but she is back. So, the question is, what went wrong?'
A gusty sigh hissed in his ear. 'Very well. Notify John that a car will be there to collect him and Miss Watson at six a.m. sharp. That will give the ruckus on his street a chance to calm, while still giving us the advantage of the early morning tranquillity: such as it is in London. I will deal with his place of work and Miss Watson's day-care. If he wishes to know where he is going, I can only offer "outside of the city" as an answer. It's best he knows no more than that.'
John grimaced. He almost preferred the serial killer angle, but Sherlock had a point. It was too easy to jump to conclusions. At this point, they needed more facts and less assumptions.
'No. Nor do they show any inclination to do so. They have claimed a new base of operations, which I am keeping under what limited surveillance I can spare.'
'Everything all right?'
Now, when every day brought new suspicions and revelations about Mary's past, Sherlock was still here, as stalwart as ever. He remained at John's side, not out of obligation, but because, despite everything, he was still John's best and closest friend. One he had treated abominably.
'No. No, they meant to kill her. If it was an accident – during a fight or something, a fatal blow that made them panic – the others would be hesitant. This was malicious.' Molly looked abashed. 'Not that most murder isn't malicious, but you know what I mean. Someone set out to kill her. I can't see any sign that they doubted their goal. No hesitation.' She moved the sheet, taking a look at the wound to the thigh before examining the throat. 'They wanted her to suffer, though. Wanted her to know she was dying. There's a lot of hate, here.'
'The information is being collated as we speak. It will be up on the secure server within half an hour. You know the one.' The soft chink of a glass being set down suggested his brother was imbibing: a brandy, no doubt. Sherlock tilted his head, wondering what could have encouraged him to indulge. Was it stress over something external and irrelevant, or did his concerns lie closer to home? 'I'm afraid it might not be the clear-cut answer you were hoping for.'
‘That’s where we’ll be when you need our statements,’ Sherlock added, already getting to his feet, his gentle hand under John’s elbow helping him up. ‘Arrest Ms Powers for bodily harm. I believe you’ll find her vehicle holds plenty of evidence to add further charges pertaining to the case.’
‘It’s the grass.’ Sherlock held out his hands for her, and John tried not to feel offended when his daughter all but threw herself at him, clinging to him like a life-raft. ‘She doesn’t like it.’
He should say no. Should turn around and get out of that door as fast as his legs could carry him. Maybe Sherlock would let him go and maybe he wouldn’t, but at least he would have tried to get out of all this madness.
He'd cuff them away, lips twisted, feeling he didn't deserve the relief they could bring. He hadn't been good to Mary when he'd had her. He didn't deserve to mourn her like that. A decent husband would not feel the way he did: sad and aching but – at the same time – somehow free.
'I'm afraid it's not that simple.'
'Yes, I'm fine.' The corner of Sherlock's lips twitched in a brief smile. 'I didn't sleep well.'
'But?'
He looked back at these last several days – at the oaths he and Sherlock had given one another under the guise of friendship – and saw the devotion underscoring each of them. Not just on Sherlock's part, but his own. He had meant every promise as solemnly as a wedding vow, and now he couldn't see Mary as anything but a threat to that.
Sherlock tilted his head, knowing it was not so clear-cut as all that. In the end, his work and Mary's history had become entwined by necessity. She had, in many ways, been both client and culprit. Yet before he could offer any kind of rebuttal, John continued.
‘Paris.’ John looked across at Sherlock. ‘The word is Paris. What next?’
The idea of Mary predicting his behaviour rankled, though it hardly surprised him. She would have known that, if John were in danger, the matter would become his highest priority. She had realised he would throw his all at it. Maybe he was right and she had never intended it to come to light, but it could still have been one of her many back-up plans: her strategy within a strategy: a labyrinthine knot of plotting.
Comfortable.
The words were spoken with a resolve that struck at Sherlock's heart, making it ache in the cradle of his ribs. 'I wouldn't ask you to. Besides, I doubt it's any safer than your current residence. Leave this with me, John.'
It was what normal people did, wasn’t it? Looked for someone to share the rent? In London it was that or sell your kidney for the privilege of a measly little bedsit. Mike’s friend was not normal though, not by a long shot. He was…
Sherlock.
The rueful smile on Mary's lips carried a hint of satisfaction to its curve. 'And if not for that? Would you have ever looked closer at what became of me, or would you have let sleeping dogs lie, Sherlock?'
Mary's jaw shifted as if she were chewing over her words. Her eyes flickered up and to the left, but no more excuses were forthcoming. Inch-by-inch, her body relaxed, her shoulders rounding as she let out a weary breath. For the first time since they had walked into Baker Street, she succumbed to an air of defeat.
Before he knew it, a cup of tea steamed at his side and a piece of toast awaited him, gleaming gold with a suitable layer of butter upon its surface. John picked at the snack and sipped his drink, raising an eyebrow as Sherlock sat down in his armchair with a pen and notebook in his hands. 'What are you doing?'
‘You think we’re looking for a doctor?’ Greg’s eyes pinched in disgust. ‘Wouldn’t someone notice a surgeon losing patients left, right and centre?’
All that mattered to him was getting Sherlock out in one piece. The sound of the gunshot, followed by Sherlock's shout of pain, haunted him, and every moment was a battle not to let his mind travel down gruesome, fretful paths of concern.
John sighed, a pang of sympathy for the watchmaker echoing low in his belly. Maybe for a great deal of the modern world, the time of the pocket-watch was up: a collector’s item and little more. An eccentric accessory or a family heirloom, but to those who laboured over their creation, they were more precious than any gem plucked from the earth. They were a machine they had created, their skill given form…
‘Various. Numerous.’ Sherlock shook his head, padding through to the kitchen to finish making John some tea. ‘Some are good artists; others are excellent. However, a few have fallen for their own con. They believe they are THE Banksy, and profit from it. Which is technically fraud, though it would be very hard to prove.’ He shrugged, an eloquent movement that was far more artful than anything anyone ever sprayed on a wall, at least in John’s eyes. ‘Though the community stamps down on that pretty hard, if they can. An artist is only worth as much as his integrity, and Banksy is one of the biggest brands around.’
He and Rosie were safe.
The wing of one of Sherlock's eyebrows lifted in thought. 'Then we encourage them. The first twenty-four hours back in London will be critical. Whatever occurs will allow us to make a number of assumptions about the situation. If we are confronted by the day's end, then we can conclude that they hope to retrieve the encoded file. It doesn't matter if they are unsure it is in our possession, it indicates that they believe we are the only possible angle of attack.'
'We didn't know whether to chase you off or put you in protective custody. Next thing we knew, the two of you were thick as thieves. We couldn't have pulled you apart with a crowbar, though I think Mycroft gave it some serious consideration.'
John, in contrast, looked the very picture of health. God, how he hated him.
Nervous sweat made his back itch, and he shifted his weight, trying to relieve the thrum that had taken up root in his thighs. Would Mary step out to meet Mycroft, or would she make him come to her? Would she take Sherlock or leave him wherever she had him stashed away?
His efforts met with little success.
Belatedly, he realised that Sherlock was looking for cameras and listening devices. Baker Street had been empty for a while, offering plenty of time for a third party to put the interior under surveillance. It hadn't even crossed John's mind, but Sherlock had ferreted something out and frowned at the tiny camera with a perplexed expression.
'No, you just drove a woman with nothing to lose to her breaking point. Just like you do with everyone else, too wrapped up in your own brilliance to see the harm you cause!' John heaved in a breath, the chair scraping over the floor as he surged upright, all trace of his earlier stiffness and pain gone, eradicated by his anger. 'Your actions have consequences, Sherlock! They always have, and now my wife is dead!'
Sherlock pursed his lips, sighing in that familiar “Everyone’s an idiot” way, but he didn’t explain. ‘You have questions.’
Once, the Thames had thronged with boats. They hauled coal, trade goods and God knew what else all along the disease-ridden length of the water. If Sherlock wanted to, he could have jumped from the deck of one to the other to get across, so tight-packed was the flotilla.
John withdrew, his fingers slipping from Sherlock's grasp and leaving him bereft. The chair scraped its accusation over the floor, a painful rasp to Sherlock's ears as John got to his feet. Shock flickered its wings across Sherlock's vision, but John did not retreat as he feared. Instead, he moved around the table, coming to a halt at Sherlock's side.
'May I?' Sherlock gestured to the vacant half of the bed, and only the ache in John's head stopped his nod from being too enthusiastic. He didn't know if Sherlock had picked up on his continuing unease, or if he was acting in response to his own desire to remain close. Either way, John was not about to argue.
‘The lab will give us more,’ Sherlock murmured, nodding in Anderson’s direction with nothing like his usual antagonism. ‘However, from what I can see we have approximately six victims. These have all passed through rigor mortis, hence the limpness. Removed within an hour of death, by my estimate. Probably all killed within a twenty-four hour window.’
‘Oh, Sherlock.’ The scene wavered in Moriarty’s wake, as if the walls themselves recoiled from him. Dark eyes glowed as he flung his arms wide and spun in a circle, euphoric and half mad. He inhaled, savouring the chlorine-heavy air. ‘I’m not the only monster here, am I, my dear?’ He stopped a handful of paces away, and that grin fell from his face like ash, revealing the predator beneath. ‘Why don’t you show him? Show your boring little friend what you really are.’
‘The name,’ Sherlock promised him, his voice pitched too low for the crowd to hear. ‘Give it to me, and this can all still go your way.’
John offered him a smile of agreement, leading the way indoors and vanishing upstairs. Sherlock watched him go, unease settling low in his gut. He had already warned John that they were running out of time. Now he was sorely reminded that their Greek team were not the only ones that could escalate. John himself could decide to take matters into his own hands. That was the greatest risk.
That voice. God, John wished he could hate it. By all rights he should. Anyone sane would have turned their back on Sherlock long ago. Instead, here he stood, desperate to cling to his bitterness even as some of the tension vanished from his shoulders, soothed away by Sherlock's presence.
The disconnected call buzzed in his ear, and John stared down at his phone, raising his eyebrow when Mycroft held out his hand for the device. 'Since I do not believe Ms Morstan will be able to contact me directly, she will attempt to do so through your mobile. May I?'
'If you are right, then we don't have much time.' Mycroft drew in a breath, his face blank as he thought quickly. 'Split up into teams of three. One should return to the surveillance network centre. It's a prime target and would give them additional eyes throughout the airfield. We should not allow them to claim that advantage. The rest of us will hide elsewhere.
He watched as Sherlock obliged him, hooking it up with practiced ease and leaving the remote at John's side. He also delivered the paracetamol without prompting, his actions so casually thoughtful that John's heart swelled to see it.
Baker Street echoed around him, a hollow shell he did his best to ignore. Sherlock perched in front of the microscope, staring down the barrel at the slide beneath. Work had become a trial, something to which he had to apply himself. Before, it had come so easily, but ever since Norbury – since Mary – he found himself struggling to answer the call of any case that came his way.
It was instinct on his part. He had never been comfortable watching strangers weep, especially when a deep, cynical part of him doubted the honesty of their tears. Still, he went through the motions of what he felt was a socially acceptable reaction, leaving Sherlock to play her uncaring audience.
Again, doubt raised its ugly head, and Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose. He had to be sure. This was not the time for brash confirmations. John had asked for answers, and he would leave no stone unturned. He would get John what he needed, even if he had to stay up all night poring over the relics of Mary's final days.
And yet…
'Forgive me.' Sherlock inclined his head. 'It is a matter of some urgency relating to an ongoing investigation. Please feel free to call my brother, Mycroft Holmes, if you need further verification.'
'What? No!' Greg rolled his eyes, shoving John's arm as he laughed. 'It's not medical, but it is biological. It's, well...' Greg took another bite of his curry. 'Sherlock's Felisian.'
He had just sorted out her bottle and settled her down in the high chair to drink it when he heard the click of the lock on the front door. Shuffling footsteps scuffed over the hall floor, and John frowned. He'd never known Mycroft's stride to be anything but firm and confident. Uncertainty raced down his spine, and he wet his lips, glancing at Rosie before he turned and peered around the half-open kitchen door.
The real one, however, had made a grim reappearance. His cane became a constant companion as his leg ached and bit at him, pain chewing its way through muscle and tendon and bone. There were some days he felt ancient and rooted, barely able to move. The morning of Mary's funeral was the worst: a closed coffin and the crematorium, the way she had wanted it to be. Ashes buried beneath a plaque. The last little bits of Mary's life turned to dust.
In the safe-house, he had briefly considered his options: moving away from London and Sherlock and the madness of their lives. Even then, the thought had brought him no joy. Now it filled him with a keening pain that had nothing to do with the physical, and his next breath strained through his lips as he swallowed hard. As much as he wanted Rosie back in his arms, Mycroft was right. He needed time.
'So, it was never about me and Rosie at all,' John rasped, shifting the Sig in his grasp. 'Not really.'
Trying to take responsibility, even when he suspected not much of it was his to claim.
‘A toxicology screen would have identified the cause of death eventually: monkshood, also known as wolfsbane, can cause cardiac arrest and respiratory paralysis when ingested.’
'Almost certainly.' Mycroft's gaze darted around. 'Be careful. The cameras in this area are fixed, rather than mobile. There are blind spots, but...'
A whisper of something against his cuff plucked at his attention, and he turned his hand without thinking, grasping Sherlock's questing fingers in his own. Again, there was a feeling of being anchored, held in place on a raging ocean as the miles passed beneath the skim of the car's wheels. Rural simplicity faded, replaced with suburban sprawl and the broad sweep of the motorway. Various towns came and went on the horizon, and John stared at them, seeing nothing.
Perhaps it should have been jarring – an erosion of all their faltering boundaries – but as he tucked John under his chin and wrapped his arms around John's back, all he could think of was how right it felt to offer him such comfort. John was a man of great strength, but Sherlock could never begrudge him support on those rare occasions that it failed.
The room was almost empty. No more white-clad fighters dashed through their paces on the mats. They'd all disbanded, wandering off to get changed and head off into the night. Only one figure remained, his Belstaff discarded and his shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbow. Sherlock's posh shoes lay to one side, their laces trailing as his sock-clad feet moved him through the same, solitary drills he and John had witnessed only a short while ago.
Some of it must have been. No lie could be absolute. There always had to be kernels of fact, or the whole edifice of deception came tumbling down. That was what he needed to find. Not Mary's lies, which he suspected were plentiful, but her truths. The little parts of herself that, even after years of secrecy, remained honest.
'I kept an inventory of useful information. Two copies were, I thought, somewhere safe, but they've been destroyed. He did it, I'm certain of it. He's the only one who might have understood their significance. I didn't know they were gone until I had left London. It should have been easy. The splinter group were watching to make sure I fulfilled my end of the bargain. When I couldn't –' She shrugged, bowing her head and pressing her knuckles to her brow. 'I promise it wasn't meant to go this way.'
Mycroft had more sense. He knew the warning signs of Sherlock’s temper better than most.
John sank onto the mattress. All thoughts of Greg and his questions fled his mind, washed away beneath the stroke of Sherlock's warm hands and the hypnotic, lustful press of those lips. There would be time to solve the mystery of Greg another day. Right now, he had a beautiful Felisian demanding his attention.
'This is most irregular, Mister Holmes.'
'Oh,' she breathed, a cruel edge tilting her smile. 'Oh, I see. It's because
If this was how Sherlock would care for him, with diligent concern and quiet fortitude, then maybe this illness wouldn't be so bad after all.
Not anymore. The channel carried nothing but the occasional pleasure cruiser for the tourists and a few vessels moored for use as public attractions, like HMS Belfast.
‘What about her armour?’ Greg jerked his head towards her clothes. ‘I thought she’d be protected?’
'I don't stare.' Sherlock blinked as if to prove his point, but he didn't tear his gaze away from the students who huddled around a couple of the larger tables. There were about twenty or so by John's count, and while some read textbooks or studied notes, most of them talked among themselves, pale-faced and wide-eyed.
A second rush of air, then a third before, suddenly, John responded.
‘Touch me.’ Even if Sherlock hadn’t spoken, his body made the same demands, his legs spreading and his hands reaching for John, urging him closer with mute promises and clinging kisses.
‘Eventually.’
'And a good thing too. Some people were poo-pooing everyone, saying it would fizzle out in a week. Bet they're regretting that now.' The smirk on Mrs Hudson's face was not entirely kind, and something in her eyes turned sharp. 'Do you know landlords have been kicking out tenants working in hospitals? Honestly, if it's not wilful ignorance it's cowardly stupidity. Things like this. They bring out the worst in people.'
John raised an eyebrow, straightening up and approaching Sherlock with a steady stride. Not a prowl, not quite, but a wolfish edge gleamed in his grin.
John straightened where he sat, nodding in understanding. 'Me.'
John straddled Sherlock and bent down for a long, deep kiss, his lips whispering over Sherlock's before returning with greater pressure. His tongue traced between them before slipping inside, tasting his fill. He shifted his grip on Sherlock's wrists into his right hand, leaving his left free to tunnel through Sherlock's hair and explore the fragile vault of his temple, to skim down the column of his throat and find the flicker of his pulse. Life's dance thrummed beneath his fingertips, driven into a frenzy by every panting breath and stifled moan. Sherlock shifted, restless, his hips rolling upwards as his cock delved into the seam of John's groin, seeking friction.
It did not take him long to find a window, the glass broken and the casing hanging on its hinges. Easing it open, he avoided any jagged edges as he slipped inside, crouching as he dropped to the floor to deaden the noise of his landing. All around him, old shelves bowed with the weight of mouldering paper: the perfect fire-hazard. It would not take much to start a blaze.
'John!'
'This is an itinerary of the secrets she has helped Norbury to sell and to whom.' Sherlock looked at John, softening his voice. 'This, I suspect, is what the Greek team hoped you would surrender to them.'
'What if it's someone's body?' John asked 'Seems likely, doesn't it, considering where the coordinates point to?'
For now.
He stood in the front hall, his head cocked as he took in John's coat hanging on the nearby rack. A curse whispered through John's mind, and he rubbed a hand over his face as he thought back. Of course, the driver had not said which "Mister Holmes" would be here soon. John had made an assumption: a bloody stupid one at that.
'Give me an hour, and I'll see what I can do.'
‘Cheer up.’ John put a mug of tea down on the coffee table. He gave Sherlock’s form, sprawled as it was on the sofa, a somewhat critical look before lifting up his feet and parking his toned posterior upon the cushions. ‘You can’t get them all.’
No, he needed Sherlock, and that notion left him feeling like a balloon filled to the brim with air, ready to burst with a heady mixture of want and hope and fear.
Something ghosted against his brow, a fleeting pressure like the softest butterfly of a kiss.
Silver eyes found their focus. Most people tended to be embarrassed. John knew that’s how he felt when his fear got the better of him. He reacted like a wounded animal, snarling and wanting space and solitude.
Greg's grin practically cracked his face in half, only widening at John's flush. If Sherlock were embarrassed, he did not show it, but his scowl made it clear he did not welcome the intrusion. That alone made John grin to himself, and he took half a step back, allowing the Work to flood in once more. There'd be time for him and Sherlock in a little bit. Judging from the look on Sherlock's face, he'd
Mycroft looked between the two of them, his narrow nostrils flaring with annoyance before he rolled his eyes and shook his head. John didn’t think he believed Sherlock’s confession for a minute, but he waved a hand dismissively. ‘Then you had best be off. I shall see you again soon.’
'You're saying you think there were others? Others like Harmattan?'
And painful as it was to see John in such torment, a small, guilty part of Sherlock relished it. John needed him, and all of Sherlock's doubts that what they shared was a matter of convenience melted away. John wanted him in a manner so multifaceted that it denied all analysis.
'How are you doing?' Molly asked, bouncing Rosie in her arms. 'You look tired.'
Sherlock shook his head, his gaze never shifting from the crowd before them. One finger curled over his lips, and the slant of his brow suggested intense concentration. There'd be no tempting him away, so John surrendered to the inevitable, promising he'd be back by Sherlock's side as soon as possible.
'Already disabled,' he said by way of explanation, holding it out for John to see before returning to where Mary had been standing. He ran his fingers over the laptop screen before shutting it down and removing the battery. A moment later he picked up a small device, about the size of a wine bottle cork, but made of sleek plastic. He turned it over in his hands before reaching into his pocket, retrieving his phone and switching it off, gesturing for John to do the same.
He didn't care about Mary. She was not what held his attention. Instead, he focussed on the gun in her rock-steady grip, one manicured nail balanced precipitously on the trigger while the muzzle stamped its brutal threat into the delicate vault of Sherlock's temple. Eyes the colour of sea glass watched him from Sherlock's pale, determined face, agleam with something unspoken. John's heart clenched hard under his ribs, locked in a vice of fear to see Sherlock at Mary's mercy.
‘Suzie has three dogs,’ Rosie pointed out.
‘It’s not even bloody art!’ John grouched, dumping the tv remote and stamping through to the kitchen, leaving the presenter twittering on about it.
'Great,' John muttered, putting the sheathed tip in his ear and pressing the button. A moment later, the device uttered its verdict, the rapid triple beat indicating a measurement outside of normal range. '39.2 centigrade. High, but not too awful.'
‘How many fingers?’ Donovan’s face crumpled in her usual bad-tempered scowl. Was it his imagination, or was there a glimmer of fear under there? ‘Holmes? How many fingers?’
John huffed, bumping his shoulder into Sherlock’s. ‘A bit, maybe, but you’ve got to admit, deducing the lawyer was selling on information by the state of his manicure… Seems a bit of a stretch, even for you.’
John set his mug aside and dragged himself to his feet. 'I can't – I can't do this right now.' He bit his lip and shook his head, moving like a man in his eighties rather than his forties, creaking and hobbled by his sentiment. 'I need some time.'
Every inch of him bathed in love's warmth, and he huffed a laugh as Sherlock collapsed on top of him with a grunt, too exhausted to hold his own weight up any longer. That long nose nuzzled at the pulse thudding in the hollow of John's jaw, and John ran a shaking, lazy hand down the graceful length of Sherlock's back, relishing the heft and feel of him even as he shifted his hips and eased himself free.
‘Then as standard you would get penicillin, but…’  John reached for the book, thumbing through the pages with renewed interest. ‘There was something in here about something new. Cheaper. And with fewer resistance issues. Yeah, all right. If I judged you to be a patient in otherwise good health with no kidney problems, I’d prescribe Tellaflexin and warn you not to take them while you’re on the Pill.’
‘It’s here to stay, then?’
'Mycroft will always do what is best for his country. However, that could be – obstructive – when it comes to us putting this to rest. I've fragmented the file over a number of servers. Even if one is compromised, they won't get the information they need. Only I have the key to recompile the data into its original format. I couldn't risk anyone getting their hands on what we have discovered.'
They were, he suspected, trained operatives, but surveillance was not a task that suited either of them. They were too battle-primed for that. They stood out in their surroundings like broken glass, jagged and incongruous. It was no wonder John had caught on so quickly. Perhaps a normal, busy person might never have realised they were being observed, but John was army trained. Time with Sherlock had honed his instincts. Of course he'd noticed his new shadows: not accustomed to such work, but not amateurs, either.
'Was there another way to save us?' John leaned back against Sherlock's chest, letting that broad expanse support his weary body. 'Another way to get past Moriarty and his shooters?'
‘What’s the difference?’
There was a split-second of silence, and Sherlock could imagine John's blue eyes scanning the battlefield, picking out lines of sight and potential targets before dismissing each one. Another bullet ricocheted off the Hind's thick skin. John sucked in a breath.
It was a learning curve for both of them: a balancing act that needed practice, but slowly they were beginning to adapt. If Sherlock had deigned to go to bed, then the case was clearly done.
There was something tragic about a take-away eaten alone.
Sherlock’s voice was quiet. He didn’t shout it. He didn’t have to. Power lay thick in that single word.
Except now, what had been a bit of a joke threatened to become fraught. He felt like he’d been walking through the park only to find himself on a precipice. A moment ago, the fact Sherlock had a codename for the wedding with Mary had been amusing. Now, it felt sharp and shocking, like all this time John had been holding a knife: one which he’d only just realised had its blade lodged deep in Sherlock’s chest.
No, this was the other aspect of Sherlock of which he had seen little, but come to treasure. He did not shy away from sentiment, repulsed, but rather plunged into the heart of John's storm, happy to hold him against the buffeting winds of emotion and weather it as his side. He asked for nothing in return and did not croon or hush John as if desperate to bring it to an end. Instead, he simply allowed it to pass of its own accord, until John blinked gritty eyes and sagged against Sherlock's chest.
The bottle was already swinging, gathering momentum as Townsend spun around, eyes wide and confused. It hit him across the jaw like a club, sending him staggering. Before he had a chance to recover, John ripped the lid off, sending a geyser of carbonated liquid into Townsend's face. He screamed as it gushed into his eyes, and John ducked beneath the flailing sword to land a second, solid blow on his chin, right where the bottle had whacked him only moments before.
'I am sorry, Mister Holmes, but I've told you all I can. You are welcome to interview the fencing team yourself. You'll find them in the refectory, which we've closed to the rest of the students while the police conduct their investigation.' She rose to her feet, the wheels on her chair clattering over the hardwood floor as it rolled away. 'Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a university to run.'
'Greg?' he answered the call, sharing a quick look with Mycroft.
‘Right…’ John narrowed his eyes as he tried to follow Sherlock’s reasoning. ‘So someone in Acacia Avenue was meant to get these and when they didn’t they… killed him over it?’
'Items for Rosie only. I promise.'
He shrugged, not sure how to continue. There was something so painfully desperate about it. No one could claim that drinking nutmeg tea was cool or edgy. It was just… sad. The most bizarre cry for help John had ever heard.
Four days. God, this had gone on for too long. Four days of one of Sherlock’s attacks of ennui; days when John’s difficult flatmate became almost impossible to deal with. He was rude and acerbic, cutting and cruel. Scathing of everything and everyone.
'Exactly. They must step back a single degree of separation. They cannot get the information they want from Mary or Norbury, so they turn to those who knew them. In this case, there is only one suitable target.'
It wasn’t fair. John had never had a thing for hands. By all accounts, Sherlock’s pale, spidery fingers should not have the power to change his mind. Yet even now, years into their friendship, he found himself enthralled.
‘A ship can carry a boat. A boat cannot carry a ship.’ He got to his feet, jerking his head towards the life-rafts that lined the side. ‘They are boats. This is a ship. Besides,’ he added, ‘the clue is in the name.’
London's busy roar rose up to meet them, and a black cab slowed to a halt in answer to Sherlock's raised hand. The driver had the heating on too high, and John pressed his head to the cool window pane, willing away the faint slick of nausea that rose in his throat.
John grimaced, scratching at his nose. Sherlock wasn’t wrong about that bit. Trev down the road could paint a gorgeous piece on a crap old warehouse and all he’d get for his efforts was an ASBO. Banksy, on the other hand…
‘Horrible,’ John agreed, wheezing a little beneath her enthusiastic embrace. He wrapped his free arm around her in turn, taking a quick moment to revel in Sylvia Holmes’ unapologetic affection. She was a force to be reckoned with at the best of times, but it had not taken John long to realise that she loved openly and fiercely.
‘Always.’
'No!' Sherlock and Mycroft spoke at once, both falling over themselves to reassure him.
‘Yes,’ John admitted, shameless.
A tight bubble of sound caught in John's throat. Not a sob. It sounded angrier than that, but an indicator of emotional turmoil all the same. Sherlock would have expected nothing less from a man like John, who could be pragmatic when needed but still felt things deeply.
‘Doctor Watson.’ Mycroft’s smile looked glassy at best. ‘Forgive my intrusion. I believed you were at work and would not be disturbed by my little… visit.’
Sherlock gave him a doubtful look, and John forced back a sigh. He knew it was wishful thinking, especially when lifting his hands above his head for more than a few seconds left him shattered, but he'd hang onto his illusions, thanks very much. 'Is she doing all right?'
Sherlock narrowed his eyes, examining not the words themselves, but the form of the letters, searching for uniformity and anomaly alike. Nothing jumped out at him as unusual. No hints signposted the way to what he might be missing, and he turned his attention instead to the spaces between.
John shot a quick look in Sherlock's direction, but there was no answering gaze or forthcoming explanation. Sherlock merely watched the Dean, his eyes sharp and his face impassive.
This? Now? It was a unique occurrence. Never before had John shared space with him while he slept. Slumber was not an easy business for John. Sherlock had deduced as much from various girlfriends, who looked like they had spent a sleepless night for reasons other than passion. To be invited – no,
‘Basic anatomy, John. Leave her be.’
'Did she ever love me, do you think?' John rasped, his voice little more than a whisper. It sounded cracked down its centre, spent of all its strength. Sherlock shuffled around, making sure to keep Rosie hemmed in before looking up into John's face. 'Did she even care, or was I just ...' John shrugged, his shoulders moving in an unsteady jerk of indifference. 'Convenient?'
'A route his team will not explore if there is anything else of significance at the location. More likely, I think the item of relevance will be above ground. Every code needs a key. Perhaps whatever is at those coordinates will help us unlock the rest of it.'
The light shifted, carving deep shadows across Mary's face, hinting at the depths that lay beneath. Her smile faded, ebbing from sight as the gun gleamed in her hand. Sherlock's chest ached: a sharp, bitter memory held not in his mind but in his flesh. Back then, he had told John it was surgical – that Mary never meant to kill him. He had not wanted to be the catalyst for the annihilation of John’s marriage.
Mycroft inclined his head, the austere lines of his face softening. At his side, John felt Sherlock shift nearer, his warmth a welcome seam against John's arm as he stood in silent support.
He shouldn't even be comparing them, her and Sherlock. His dead wife and the friend who'd come back. He shouldn't be sitting here, wondering how his life had come to this. Married and widowed in the space of less than eighteen months, and now feeling flat and dead inside, not with grief, but a creeping dread he didn't have the strength to name.
'Of a sort. Everything I saw indicated that these people are not trained for surveillance, or perhaps they are simply unpractised. When they were watching you, they stood out. Anyone who knew what to look for would know them for what they were. You included.'
'I don't think there's much more Miss Russell can tell us. Lestrade says they're struggling with DNA evidence.'
John had yet to rescind his offer of sharing Sherlock's bed, and Sherlock made sure the curtains were drawn before easing himself down to the mattress, taking care not to disturb him. Not that he needed to cling to his concerns. He suspected the number 66 bus could crash through the wall and John would not so much as stir. He was completely oblivious, and Sherlock turned on his side, surveying that face as he allowed his thoughts to wander.
The warden's expression took on a pained edge, and John gave a faint huff of amusement. It seemed the man was no more keen to bother Mycroft than he was to oblige Sherlock, and he watched him dither before he made up his mind.
'Why are you defending her?' John wet his lips, busying himself with mixing Rosie some formula to make up for the porridge, most of which had ended up everywhere but in her mouth. He tried to keep his voice light, but the accusation bled through anyway.
John had only the vaguest idea where they were going, grasping at clues from signs on the motorway. North, though how far he had no clue. He assumed Mycroft did not intend to help him flee the country. He wouldn't put it past the older Holmes to have safe-houses dotted around: something to protect him against the vagaries of the world of espionage, or whatever it was he did all day.
It was only when Mycroft called his name that he blinked himself from his stupor, lifting his head to meet that piercing gaze. 'With regards to Ms Morstan, as far as official channels are concerned, she died some months ago, shot by Norbury at the aquarium. I shall make sure all the paperwork is in order and verified to reflect that fact. Norbury's trial will focus on her treason. She will spend the rest of her life behind bars for that alone. There is no need to bring up Mary's role in it.'
Yes, but not yet. Soon, perhaps, but now there were higher priorities to consider. Maybe when John was better, stronger, and once they were not both trapped within Baker Street's confines he would make his confessions. If he was wrong – if John did not want more than friendship – then being stuck together in the four walls of the flat would be nothing short of miserable.
'We'd hit our own people if we pulled the trigger,' the commander snapped.
Lestrade was the first, looking beyond the guise of drug addiction and indifference to the fire beneath. In his more cynical moments, Sherlock told himself it was only because he was useful. Lestrade needed help solving cases, and Sherlock needed a puzzle or two to keep him sane. It was grudging symbiosis, or at least, that’s how it started.
'I intend to split the force into teams. The smaller unit will monitor the perimeter. There are only two roads going in and out: one on the north, the other on the south. We will curtail any obvious routes of escape for either Mary or the splinter group.
Blue eyes blinked, finding light and life as they settled on Sherlock's features. The Sig lowered an instant later, the baleful eye of the muzzle staring at the floor before John darted forward, grabbing a pen-knife off the nearby desk and slicing through the zip ties that held him in place. Pain ricocheted along his arms as the circulation returned, and Sherlock clenched his teeth as he rolled his shoulders, shaking out stiff joints before pressing a hand over the hole in his thigh.
John glanced at his watch, shaking his head. 'It's past dinner time, they're not going to just...'
‘Thanks,’ he rasped, letting Sherlock support his weight. ‘That was – was good. A good thing.’
'Not “O Dio”, Mister Holmes.' Norbury's eyelashes fluttered closed. 'If you're going to uncover the truth with such brutality, you may as well get it completely right. There was Amo, and Mary was...'
‘I keep trying to get Reggie to take it down,’ she confessed, ‘but he refuses. He found it in a junk shop and says he feels sorry for it.’
More than once he'd considered clearing out some of her things, but it felt too much like accepting she was gone. Which she was, he knew that, but some small part of him felt he should be deeper in his grief; less prepared to move on. He felt like a man without a map, lost in unexpected territory, torn between how he felt and the notion of how he should feel.
A deluge of information rushed through his mind, guiding his hands as he lifted the angle of John’s chin and pinched his nose shut before exhaling into John’s mouth. ‘Come on,’ he whispered, ‘Come on, John.’
It was no hollow platitude. He had not realised how much he needed to be touched until he was in Sherlock's arms, nor noticed how much he craved the sensation of connection. Not with just anyone, but with Sherlock exclusively, as if they were a lock and key made for each other.
Nausea grabbed his guts in its fist. God, he was an idiot. Mostly, the Fae were stories and not much more, but they weren’t all the same. There were good ones and bad ones. Ones who’d grant you wishes with no tricks, and ones like Moriarty, who revelled in causing pain and twisted mischief: to whom the world was a game, and boring, normal humans were nothing but pawns.
Sherlock may have superior skill, but the weapon in the stranger's hand was not a blunt practice foil. They had all seen what that sword could do, and John's blood ran cold as it flashed forward, a decisive stab that ripped through the fabric of Sherlock's sleeve, leaving the cloth gaping. There was no cry of pain or glimmer of blood, but it was a close call all the same.
He had their attention now. The soldiers may be watching the skies, but their ears were open.  'They have introduced an obvious threat in order to distract you from more ground-based occurrences. Did you leave anyone behind with the transport you used to get here?'
John looked at his daughter, who was poking the grass at the edge of Sherlock’s jacket with deep suspicion. She definitely seemed to prefer the silk-lined jacket. Not that he could blame her. He knew which he’d choose.
Loved.
The clothes people wore could speak volumes. They were truths and lies, woven together in an intricate disguise. They made the wearer fit in or stand out: a statement of conformity or defiance. Of course, most people never thought of it in that way. At least, not consciously.
'Better now I've told her you're up and about. I've been keeping her apprised of your well-being by text. She was worried about you.'  Sherlock swallowed. 'As was I.'
And when Sherlock smiled, John wondered if maybe he had it wrong. Maybe he was family, of a sort.
He eschewed the crutches, hobbling towards the kitchen with vague thoughts of making himself another cup of tea. However, before he got there, he noticed John sitting halfway up the stairs to his bedroom, shrouded in shadow. His hands were clasped between his spread knees and his gaze remained fixed, unfaltering, on Sherlock's figure.
'Yeah. Look, was there anything at Molly's place that could give any hints about where Mary was going?'
He would not blame John if he never wanted anything more to do with Sherlock, or the Work, or Baker Street. He would have moved on. That was what people did, didn’t they? They went on with their lives, pulling a veil between themselves and their past?
'Winters. That's her.' He pointed to the young woman in the middle, her hair in a severe bun and her face sharp and confident. 'Looks like it was taken in the late eighties.' He set John’s mobile aside, his own back in his palm as he dove into Google, giving a quick grunt of confirmation. 'Oxford champion 1986 to 1988.'
Rosie’s bedroom door creaked on its hinges. John’s breath fell still in his throat. Panic hummed in his ears, and every muscle locked tight. He felt like prey hiding from some great, unknown beast, cowering in the shadows as he waited for the future to unfurl. The angle of the nightlight meant he couldn't see much through the tiny chink in the wardrobe door, nothing beyond a hint of dark clothing and the shifting shadow of not one, but two invaders.
He reached up, tangling his hand in the thick collar and dragging Sherlock down. He expected a bit of grudging protest, but Sherlock merely offered a little sigh of contentment, his false annoyance melting away as his lips moved over John’s.
Molly pulled a face, her nose wrinkling as she considered the problem. 'I can take molds. The one in her thigh was a stab more than a slash, it might give you a rough profile. It'll take a while, though.'
Relief left him dizzy, and he sat back on his heels, closing his eyes before shaking his head. 'I thought –'
Sherlock suspected the file to be some form of digital trap, designed to destroy the USB stick and all its contents in a single, quick blow. Either that, or it was the key he was looking for. One held irritatingly out of his reach.
Sherlock jabbed his finger into his own palm, emphasising the point. ‘Harmattan is unaffiliated, which means Mary could well have been their only informant. She was as much their golden goose as they were hers. It could have been a mutually beneficial arrangement that they did not want to end.'
Good.
They'd argued over that more than once. John said there were plenty of other places for Sherlock to rest in the flat, ones more comfortable and conducive to slumber, but Sherlock remained unrelenting. He would not sleep on the sofa, or worse, up in John's room. Should he give in to either prospect, he would lie awake, worrying and wondering, only to succumb to the urge to return to John's side within the hour.
He'd lost whole days to some illness when training in the army. He couldn't remember anything but the vague wash of white sanatorium walls and a raging fever. Delirium. This wasn't that, though he wouldn't count his blessings just yet. It could still end up that way... or worse.
'Hmmm.' Sherlock clicked the pen, retracting the nib and putting the book aside. 'Are you all right with me cleaning your room? Normally, I wouldn't intrude...'
Her hands twisted together in her lap, fingers wringing around each other, but Sherlock was not convinced her display of distress was genuine. Not when her gaze did not so much as waver, and no other evidence of anxiety wrote itself upon her frame. It was an affectation: one designed to tug at the heartstrings.
'You won't get it.' Mary sighed, apology lilting her next words. 'It must be frustrating. I know what you were thinking. You thought I'd appeal to John for the file, didn't you? I bet you had it all mapped out in your head, and I must have only confirmed those beliefs when I called John and told him to meet me.'
And just like that, Sherlock could forget it all: the pains of the past and the problems of the present. All for this. All for John, and the future that lay so soundly in their grasp.
The certainty took him by surprise, even as it filled his heart with heat. Despite everything, if he knew Sherlock were in trouble, he would still come running, and damn the consequences to himself.
‘I know what you're like. I know how it is.' He shrugged, his grin turning a little wicked. 'It's no hardship, Sherlock, living with you. And even if it was, then this?' He rubbed a thumb over the line of Sherlock's collar before lifting his hand to press, light but firm, along the blade of Sherlock's jaw. 'What we're starting? That'd be a bloody good consolation.'
Besides, up here, nestled in the skyline, was where London kept her best secrets. A labyrinth of gutters and eaves, cornices and cupolas. Even better, modern safety regulations meant there were plenty of fire-escapes to aid him, and the tight-packed, cheek-to-cheek living meant that there were rarely vast gaps to leap, which was perhaps a blessing for his aging knees.
'Take Rosie into the living room where she will be more comfortable, not to mention safer. Let her be your top priority, but if she gives you a moment, have a look through these.'
'I thought not. Let me ask Mrs Hudson. Finding a good tenant’s not as easy as you'd hope. I bet some of her friends would cut the rent a bit if they knew you’re a copper.'
'No.' John looked down at his daughter, rocking back and forth in the soothing way that seemed to have written itself into his bones the day she was born. 'Not in front of the screen, anyway. I'll try and get her settled out of sight. It's the best compromise I can manage.'
John shuddered, an all over tremor that he couldn't hide. This was not the first time Sherlock had ended up bleeding after a case, and it wouldn't be the last. Still, he kept remembering the look in Townsend's eyes. The sharp, utter hatred. He would have run Sherlock through without a hint of remorse if John hadn't stopped him. He would have left the most remarkable man John ever knew bleeding to death on the floor and walked away, and all for what?
John blinked, his brow twitching in a frown. 'What? I thought we were waiting?'
John tightened his fingers over Sherlock's: a brief, panicked spasm. 'Stay?' The word tore itself out of him, tight and nervous. 'Just for a bit?'
He expected at least a faint sigh of annoyance at his stubborn behaviour, but if anything, Sherlock seemed relieved. A hint of a smile curved the corner of his mouth, and his gaze flickered from the road to John's face for a split second. 'I did not think you would. Besides, your presence, more than mine, will drive our quarry into action.'
Sherlock leant his head back against the chair, peeling his cramped fingers away from the gun controls as he took a deep breath. He thought of Mary, dead from John's shot; the splinter group, fractured to nothing by a few sad remnants; of long days and longer nights caught in an endless web which had now, at last, disintegrated, freeing them all from its clutches.
After that? John’s heart fluttered in his chest at the notion. After that, John intended to find out just what the future might hold for him and Sherlock.
John leant against the doorframe, his arms folded and his lips twisted in a crooked smirk of amusement-cum-annoyance. ‘Hmmm. Well, I won’t offer you tea or anything. I’m sure you’re busy.’
'Here.' Sherlock held out a glass of water and a blister pack of paracetamol. 'The bed's ready if you need it, though if you can stay sat up for half an hour it might help you digest those.' He perched on the edge of the coffee table, bringing himself down to John's level and tilting his head, as if he could see John better from an angle. 'Do you want any food?'
Glassy light greeted him: a vivid illumination that stripped away every veil. There were other beds in the small ward, but John paid their occupants no mind. He couldn’t. Not when Sherlock lay so still and quiet.
'No, no of course not.'
Sherlock relieved him of his Sig with deliberate tact, giving John plenty of time to reclaim the weapon if he chose. It was tempting. It offered him the illusion of control, but that was not the purpose of a gun. It was a last resort, not a comfort object.
'I want whatever you are happy to give,' he admitted at last, his voice soft and deep around his confession. 'I have been your friend for years, and that will not change, no matter what.'
Hours later, the silence broke.
The loneliness hit him once Rosie was in bed. More often than not, he and Mary had been too tired to do much more than collapse in front of the TV, but the companionship had always been there. Even after all they'd been through, all the issues, there'd been something soothing to her presence.
'Here, use mine.' He offered it up with a flick of his fingers. 'Call Lestrade and Molly; let them know you're safe, but not where you are.' He waited until John accepted the device from his grasp before standing back, giving him the privacy to contact those that cared for him and reassure them of his well-being.
Sherlock was examining the staircase with narrow eyes, and he perched the takeaway boxes perilously on top of the radiator in the hall. 'Wait here,' he ordered, turning out the light and plunging them back into darkness. A puzzled noise died in John's throat as Sherlock flicked on the torch on his phone, sending a circle of white illumination drifting up the stairs.
Perhaps it would have been better to leave it tucked away, but something – some deep, uncertain knowledge – wouldn't allow Sherlock to do so. He needed it with him: a constant reminder.
It was just another day – another case. Except that Sherlock’s skin had taken on an unnatural, grey tinge, and the Belstaff hung from his shoulders like a lead weight. He stood, motionless, his astute gaze unfocussed and his lips parted around shallow sips of air.
God, but this was dangerous territory. John knew that. After all they’d been through over the years, all the hope and heartbreak, did he really want to tread this path? What they had now, him, Rosie and Sherlock – it was good. Better than good. A voice in his head screamed at him to retreat, to step back from the risk of losing their friendship, but he’d spent too long being a coward, hiding behind Mary and marriage and misery.
'Allow me to have her conveyed here to Baker Street. Some of the furniture is already on its way and will arrive this evening. I can have you daughter with you by tomorrow lunch-time. That way, you have time to prepare fully for her arrival.'
'Then the odds are with us. If she comes back here –'
Sherlock nodded, regardless of the fact Lestrade could not see him. His concerns that he would have difficulty accessing the reports faded. He had half-expected to need Mycroft’s help to overcome the pointless bureaucracy.
With a sigh, he reached up to rub his hand across his face, only recalling his gloves at the last moment. Before all this started, he had never noticed the tells of his physical self. Normally, he prided himself on his control, but that, like so many other things, was little but a facade of self-comfort. That, or living with John had lowered his walls enough to allow his body the free reign it had not enjoyed since childhood.
Greg sounded ragged: no doubt at the end of his rope with being kept in the dark, and John sketched out the details, silently agreeing as Greg cursed in disbelief. 'And she's got Sherlock?'
'We have work to do.' Sherlock raised an eyebrow as John blinked, emerging from his thoughts for the first time in almost an hour.
'O Dio is spoken of as an individual, but it could be a partnership or conglomerate. One they are eager to find.'
'Or they might have only been interested in us.' John stared at his daughter, his heart cracked through with dread at the thought of losing her too. He drew in a stuttering breath, his voice whispering between his lips: little more than a hint of sound. 'I thought it would be easier.'
John sighed, his eyelids already drooping as he slumped back into his pillow. 'Yeah, well. It's no good if you make yourself ill in the process. There's space here for you too.' He waved one hand towards the unoccupied half of the bed. 'Just get your head down for a bit.'
John tightened his grasp around his empty mug, groping for the TV remote as he tried to stop the whirl of his thoughts. He didn't feel strong enough for this, not yet, but now it seemed there was no stopping the flourish of his hopes.
Norbury's jaw tensed; a muscle jumped beneath the strain as she glared daggers through the screen. Her fingernails beat out a quick tattoo on the surface of the desk before clenching into a fist, but her control was rapidly crumbling. Even John could see that.
He was once more in a three-piece suit: shockingly formal after the shirt-sleeves and tactical gear from Haversham airfield. On the surface, he appeared neatly-groomed and well-rested. However, the white-knuckle grip on his umbrella betrayed his exhaustion, and Sherlock flicked his fingers towards John's armchair. 'I suggest you sit before you fall down. You've been busy, I take it?'
The scuff of a kitchen chair made him turn, scowling at Sherlock, who had hobbled over to the table to take a seat, surprisingly stealthy for a man on crutches. Sherlock raised an eyebrow in challenge, propping the foot of his injured leg up on the opposite chair before folding his arms across his chest.
John's question was a challenge given voice, and Sherlock's mind whirled. Part of him knew that, on the surface, Mycroft had spoken the truth. John was vulnerable and off-balance, emotionally shaken by all that had happened and perhaps not in the best place to make any life-changing decisions. At the same time, he was a grown man, more than capable of understanding his needs and knowing his limitations. He did not need to be coddled and treated like a child, and logic had no place in the arena of bloody, desperate hearts.
‘I was thinking “beaten” actually.’
It was hard not to be captivated by each glossy frame, and John had to force distance between himself and the subjects of the photographs as he remembered Sherlock's instructions. Slowly, he began to sort them into piles, splitting up the images by location until he had a mere handful: pictures captured outside the usual confines of their lives.
‘Not a common bouquet. In fact, you would struggle to find these blooms in any florist. It’s Monkshood.’
Sherlock thought of John's anger and isolation, his tears and distress. He thought of the man he knew better than anyone else ripped apart by Mary's callous actions and still finding the strength to build himself up anew.
Mycroft's grip on his elbow tightened: a brief, almost painful grasp that relaxed again just as quickly, smoothed away by his precise control. 'I am afraid it may already be too late for that. Sherlock's phone disconnected from the cellular network approximately one minute before the explosion. Men near his location hurried to the scene. I doubt they will have good news to share. This–' He gestured to the ruined warehouse.' – was the perfect distraction. Mary has won this round.'
'They would not dare!'
Greg raised his glass in thanks, his smile rich and honest. 'Best thing I've heard all week. Don't worry if I'm asking the impossible. I just – I fancy a change. My lease ends in a couple of months, and I found myself wondering what the fuck I was still doing in that place. It's nothing but a bed to me, really. And a fridge, I suppose.'
'Let me finish.' John's voice was an open wound, pained and raw, but he surged on. 'I'm still angry, sometimes. It's hard not to be, but I'm also grateful. Mary was never your problem, Sherlock. Or your responsibility. I know you vowed to keep us safe, but that was before AGRA. Before everything. It was a promise to protect us from the consequences of your life, not Mary's past.'
'You think she might know who this "O Dio" is?'
John Watson frowned down at his clasped hands, trying, not for the first time, to fit those words into his reality. He'd held her, heard her last words, watched the blood spread as the air faltered between her lips. She'd died in his arms, and he... still couldn't believe it.
‘So, where are we going?’ he asked.
John mumbled a negative, the seam of his eyelashes burning as his eyelids drifted shut. The sheets smelled mostly of detergent, but a trace of the scent he associated with Sherlock lingered: a hint of whatever he used in his hair. It comforted John in ways he did not quite want to define, and he nestled deeper into the quilt, curling his knees up towards his chest as his tortured frame began to relax.
He looked up at Sherlock, not missing the fond look he received, as if Sherlock was not used to anyone feeling outrage on his behalf. Perhaps he wasn’t. Somehow that just made things worse.
‘Oh my God!’ Molly’s exclamation made Sherlock wish they were back at Baker Street. Maybe he should just hide until it healed. Her hands had flown over her mouth; her eyes huge in her face. Lestrade was beside her, his face as grey as his hair.
He could ask Sherlock for help, but his pride offered tremulous snarls at the thought. Besides, he kept wondering if this was where Sherlock's care found its limits. Would he lose interest, now that John couldn't offer more in the way of useful data?
Remorse was pointless. After all, he was not the one who had done the killing, and no crime got solved if everyone was too busy wailing and gnashing their teeth. Besides, grief solved nothing. Compassion had its uses, he supposed, but frankly it was just another tool in his arsenal. A way to get answers.
Understanding and amazing.
John grimaced, looking around until he saw something gleaming in one of the sunbeams. It didn't look much bigger than a cigarette lighter, but where all the other rubbish in the warehouse was decrepit with age, this shone: new and out-of-place.
'Yeah, no.' John shook his head, his next inhale a too-short gasp. Panic simmered just below the surface: Sherlock could see it as clear as day, despite John's best efforts to keep a lid on it. 'We need to bind this for a start. Clean it. Stitch it. All that.' His fingers trembled, knotting in the denim over Sherlock's knee, and Sherlock leaned forward, enfolding him in a clumsy embrace.
She was moving out her stuff as he stood here. He’d offered to help, but his heart wasn’t in it. She’d turned him down with a smile.
'And you were right.'
Then John limped into Sherlock’s life and things changed. Not much, Sherlock was a stubborn bugger, after all, but Greg still noticed. Those cheekbones looked less like razorblades, and the turn of Sherlock’s wrists no longer seemed so fragile.
Sherlock let out a breath, his heart sinking in his chest. 'Knowledge is power, John, and Mary sold it to the highest bidder. The person who possesses this holds all that information in the palm of their hand, and with it, every government and criminal organisation in Europe, if not beyond. It's the sort of thing people kill and die for.'
‘Maple syrup.’ Sherlock jerked his head to the pallet that had been knocked over. Bottles had smashed, releasing the sweet-scented, sticky stuff all over the warehouse floor. ‘Ostensibly, anyway. Although I have my doubts.’
A few more voices rose in greeting, hazy with sleep, and Sherlock held his breath, listening to the chatter: the overtones of camaraderie. This was no hastily assembled team, but a group used to the presence of one another – aware of the strengths and weaknesess of each individual and accustomed to the jagged edges of different personalities.
Worse, any attempt at rescue or invasion would be seen coming. There was no subtle angle of approach, and Sherlock swallowed back his grudging respect. Mary had chosen where to make her stand with strategic skill. He couldn't fault her for it. Their surroundings were little more than open farmland, and a quick glance over his shoulder showed no towns sprawled on the far-off horizon.
Sherlock merely smiled at her. Not the bright, shamming thing he still used from time-to-time, but something slow, secretive and satisfied.
Oh, she adored her dad, loved him to bits, but if she wanted a cuddle – no questions asked – Sherlock was her go-to. He didn’t croon or fuss. Didn’t ask if there was anything wrong. He just held her, quiet and content, until she’d had enough.
The commander was right; the helicopter's impressive payload was aiming not to maim or kill, but to rattle their composure. They sought to startle them from hiding, as if they thought they were dealing with amateurs. It was a small comfort, but Sherlock would take what little he could get. The splinter group had underestimated them, and an unsettled enemy was a vulnerable one.
Sherlock hesitated, considering the logic of John's suggestion. It did, in hindsight, seem a more sensible reason for their actions. Yet he could not begrudge himself the sentiment that clouded his initial judgement. How could he, when John was an emotional minefield, ready to explode at any moment?
‘Nothing as interesting as that.’ Greg stepped closer. ‘How many stitches did it need?’
Except, of course, for the murder weapon hiding in plain sight.
'I liked him.' Mary huffed a quiet laugh. 'I really liked him. He was just the kind of man I was looking for: comfortable, compassionate...' She cleared her throat, her clothes rustling – a shrug, Sherlock assumed – before she continued. 'He was also vulnerable. He needed me too much to look deeply at my past; needed someone to assist in shoring up his broken heart, and I was only too happy to oblige. I wanted to leave my history behind and start a new life. In John, I found someone who could help me do that. And then you came back.'
His so-called admirer, ambling down the other side of the street without a care in the world.
Sherlock tilted his head, those silver eyes raking John's frame in a cursory assessment. 'That's not going to be possible. The flat's too small for that and we only have one bathroom. We had this discussion when the pandemic first hit, if you recall?'
Maybe if John had more energy, he'd argue, but frankly he didn't have the strength left in him to do anything but take it at face value. Yeah, he felt guilty for stealing Sherlock's bed, but the man had offered. Besides, all trace of hesitation fled when he lay down and let the mattress cradle his abused body. 'Oh, God, that's better.'
A groan of misery-cum-relief trembled in the air, and Sherlock swallowed. He had no data to go on, of course, but he couldn't help but wonder how John's cries of passion might sound. Would similar noises escape him as he came apart beneath Sherlock's hands? Would they be deeper, higher, more or less breathless?
Too little, and far, far too late.
'The splinter group.'
His pinched, cunning smile held an edge of desperation, and John wondered what it cost him to put his brother's safety in John's hands. He did not ask questions, merely stood there, poised on parade rest as Mycroft explained.
He sighed in relief, his stomach a twisting knot as he thought of everything that had gone up in smoke. His whole life with Mary had been in that house, their wedding album, Rosie's baby book, passports... 'Jesus.'
– echoing in John's mind.
Now, he stood there, his body locked tight. He couldn’t move if he tried. Couldn’t curse or scream or throw a punch. More to the point, he couldn’t pull the trigger and put a bullet in Moriarty’s head, right where it belonged.
Courtiers to the king of the crime scene.
It wasn't good; he could see that. His emotions came too quick and hard for him to control, these days. Anger boiled below his skin while grief and guilt bled from an invisible black wound. It made him unreliable, unpredictable, and he couldn't afford to be like that anymore. Not with Rosie to look after.
John pursed his lips, restraining his questions as his heart hammered at the base of his throat. The door to the flat stood closed, but the beam of light under Sherlock's command steadily raked from side to side, checking each step. He was searching for booby traps, John realised, shifting his grip on the butt of his pistol: tripwires and the like. The thought had not even crossed his mind. Back in Afghanistan, sure, but here in Baker Street?
His chest ached, throbbing with a pain that had nothing to do with his injuries. His heart clenched and twisted, and he forced himself to swallow and bring his mind to bear. Now was not the time to fall victim to his sentiments. Not if he wanted to make it out of this mess alive and discover what had become of John. He had to think about this logically. There, he would find his comfort.
A glance at his watch told him John would be leaving his home in less than ten minutes. As tempting as it was to linger, to try and glean more from his surroundings, Sherlock knew he had run out of time. John needed that distraction, something that would bring anyone still out in the field running back to base.
It was going to be a long night.
'They were booby-trapped,' Sherlock explained, cutting off the long-winded explanation Mycroft would offer. 'I suspect Mary rigged them deliberately some time ago.'
'Yes. Her and Norbury. The bullet that struck her was a blank. A ruptured blood pack on the front and back of her torso gave the illusion of a wound that went right through her. Then she merely had to sell her demise to the rest of us.'
Take the contents of John’s wardrobe. He had lived with Sherlock for years, but still his choices leaned more towards comfort than style. Serviceable shirts hung in a rank along the rail, while thick jumpers stacked folded on the shelves below. Boots, sturdy and stout, dwelt in the shadows at the bottom, waiting to march the streets of London.
Without thinking, he smoothed one hand down Sherlock's thigh, feeling his soft flesh give way to skin of a different texture, a pitted starburst beneath John's fingers. The bullet wound had healed well: the scar did not cause Sherlock even an ounce of pain, but it was still like a splash of cold water on John's ardour. His next breath hitched on a gasp and he swallowed hard, wishing he could escape the memories that surged from the depths of his mind to ensnare him anew.
John did not care for the thrill of the chase. He did not care for Baker Street, and as for his thoughts on Sherlock…
Yet his need for reassurance could not take precedent over John's requirement for rest. Sleep allowed his body to divert maximum resources to fighting off the invader that had wormed its way past John's defences.
'No. They're too clever for that, and Mycroft is rather bound by the necessity of using official channels. More than anything, coming here has been about giving you and Rosie time to regroup. It gives us the opportunity to formulate a plan, rather than simply reacting to the most immediate threat.' Sherlock sighed, his gaze turning cold. 'Unfortunately, I suspect that whatever we decide to do may very well hinge on what's in that graveyard.'
Noises from outside barely pierced his perception, and it was only when someone cleared their throat that John broke away, blinking as reality interceded.
The person in fencing gear was tall and broad enough that John would guess they were male, but beyond that, all distinguishing features were hidden beneath the shroud of white. Sherlock might be able to get more from the figure, but to John it could be any one of two-dozen people, and the uncertainty set his teeth on edge.
The only disadvantage was the limited arc of their range, which covered the front one-hundred and fifty degrees of the helicopter's field of view. It was John, more than anyone, who was correctly positioned to rain hell down on any targets approaching from the sides, but he was also the most vulnerable to a well-aimed bullet.
It had been too much, all of it: his fear for Sherlock and his loathing of Mary, the pain at all he had lost and the relief of all he had managed to keep safe. For so long he had laboured under a burden – not just these last few weeks since Mary's so-called death, but before that: since he found out what she was and how mottled with shadow her past had been.
‘Not a puppy.’ Rosie nodded, and though Sherlock contributed nothing to her genetics, the way she tilted her head and narrowed her eyes was all him: cunning and more than a little terrifying. ‘But what about a dog? We could adopt one.’
'You prat.' John's muffled voice made him smile, and when John breathed out it felt as if he blew away all the tension in the room, banishing the webs of doubt that ensnared Sherlock's frame. 'Why the fuck would I mind? I've wanted it – you – for bloody years.'
He'd thought one glance would tell him for sure whether it was Sherlock on the ground, but it wasn't that easy. Dark hair lay slick with blood and brain matter, and there was almost nothing left of his face. A close range shot with a high calibre weapon. Someone had not been fucking around. Instead, John had to look at the clothes: jeans and a hoodie, but not the ones he had last seen Sherlock wearing. Whoever this was, they were also too short, their build too thick for Sherlock. If he had to guess, he would say it was Mary's accomplice: his usefulness expired.
'Are they watching Sherlock?' John wet his lips, a frown creasing his brow. Anxiety fluttered in the pit of his stomach, and he shoved it down. He didn't want to care about Sherlock – not after everything – but his damn heart betrayed him at every turn.
Regent’s Park, with all its oaks and other hardwoods, looked like a painter’s palette. The air nibbled his nose and made his fingers sting, but that was a pain he would take. The weak sun, glassy with winter’s promise, dazzled him as he walked, but he revelled in it anyway.
Everyone had a little bit of magic in them. It was the way the world worked. Maybe they never lost stuff, or always baked the perfect cake. Maybe they could see a few seconds into the future, or skim the surface of another’s thoughts, but they were all little gifts and enchantments. Nothing big. That kind of magic didn’t exist anymore, not since the Faeling.
"Anthea" pulled a face. 'Here is adequate. Calls only, and remain connected for no longer than absolutely necessary.'
John wrinkled his nose. He knew that tone of voice. As a doctor, he heard it a lot. The tight, nervous tones of someone who was about to pull down their pants and ask you to look at something odd on their backside.
With an explosive breath of triumph, he snagged free a couple more shots. One was taken the same day, back near the house. He was pushing the pushchair along the pavement, smiling down at Rosie in a crooked way that he knew did not meet his eyes.
'So, what? If Norbury knows who it is there's no way for our Greek team to get to her?'
Molly gently extricated a strand of her hair from Rosie's mouth, indifferent to her drool as she let out a sigh. 'If you're sure, but John? Remember it's not just you that could be in danger any more. It's Rosie too.'
'And if she
He licked his lips again and put the safety back on his gun. It tucked in his waistband snug and familiar. He met Sherlock’s gaze and wrinkled his nose, his lips pulling down in a grimace as he gave his answer. ‘I’ll come home, but if I don’t like what I hear, I’m gone. Understand?’
'Any action they may take would be mere child's play in comparison to what will happen to me should I tell you anything further. Goodbye, Mister Holmes. I have nothing left to say to you.'
'He's sleeping. He wanted me to clean down here. I suspect the notion is that, after I'm done, I don't venture downstairs again until the isolation period has passed.'
Sherlock ran his tongue over the edge of his teeth, dithering for a moment between comfort and honesty. In the end, as always, his decision fell in favour of the latter. 'No, I do not. As long as Mary is part of the equation, you and Rosie will continue to be a pressure point for her: a way to make her fall in line. Your continued safety could very well rely on her ongoing obedience to the splinter group, and you have seen how Mary operates. Eventually, there will come a time when she fights against their restrictions, and you and Rosie may get caught in the crossfire.'
Sherlock swallowed, his mind reeling. He had no extra clothes to offer John for warmth, and no way to dress his wounded head. He had done all he could: so little and yet, to John, it was everything: hope, opportunity, salvation…
A glimmer on the horizon, as if the sun was afraid to show its face. A thin, silver seam that warmed with every passing moment.
herself in harm's way.
'Was she in any bouts last night?' Sherlock leaned back against one of the pillars, surveying the room even as he listened.
A dry palm rested on his brow, making Sherlock shiver, and he huddled deeper in his dressing gown. He’d go back to bed if it didn’t feel like the worst kind of defeat. Instead, he sat miserably in his armchair, hating everything.
He'd caught himself chewing the side of his thumb more than once – Mummy would be appalled – and every drawn breath felt tight and thin. Even the realm of his mind palace – a haven he rarely acknowledged – lay closed to him, inaccessible in this wretched, fretful state.
Even if that Fae was just Sherlock. The same as he had ever been: a mystery, right from the beginning.
'Mary had a lot of help to get this done,' she explained. 'I've dug through what I can and made a list of all the people who might have given her a hand. Some of them are gone – they were probably never what they seemed in the first place, like the paramedics. I expect some were duped by fake paperwork and had no idea what was going on, but I think there were one or two officials who were in on it.'
They would be right.
Eventually, the spin of the taxi's wheels delivered him to the front door of the Diogenes. Normally, he would never be permitted admittance in his current attire, but he'd warned Mycroft to expect him dressed as such. If his brother had any sense, he would have informed the very particular staff that exceptions were to be made.
'Really, Mister Holmes, while I appreciate being kept informed, Mary's return has little to do with me. It changes nothing.'
'So bossy,' he said fondly. He had never expected Sherlock to be any different in bed than he was out of it. He never had any qualms about going after what he wanted. In this case, his aim was clearly getting John naked as quickly as possible.
Supermarket wines were not, precisely, failures in terms of wine, but their palette was too generic for Mycroft’s tastes. So why, precisely, did he have one of Tesco’s average price blends laid out next to his merlot?
'Even I can admit that, in a few limited circumstances, I am wrong. Good day, Sherlock, and do look after yourself, won't you?'
Most of the population failed to live up to Sherlock’s expectations, but a rare few were different.
'Some is financial resources; some is geographical information. AGRA is mentioned frequently.' He pointed to the familiar anglicised acronym, standing out like a sore thumb amidst its Greek contemporaries, 'but that's not the only one. There's something else referred to as...' He ran his finger under the relevant phrase, again written not in the Greek alphabet, but English.
‘I don’t like this Banksy,’ Sherlock corrected him, his voice far off and half-lost in his mind palace. ‘The first one was all right.’
'Wrong.' Sherlock straightened where he sat, his gaze astute and his lips curled in a sneer of disdain. 'Would you like to try again?'
Holding out a hand to stop Greg and Sally in their tracks, he approached carefully, making sure to neither crowd Sherlock’s space or block the way out of the room. If the coin-toss of fight-or-flight came down on Sherlock fleeing the scene, then John would rather not be in his way.
The end result was not some idiotic notion of completion. Some utter fallacy of "He makes me whole." Rather, he and John were each other's catalyst, allowing one another to reach their full potential.
John nodded, relief bubbling through him. He had not even considered those practicalities, and the thought of burying Mary again... No. No, he wouldn't have done it anyway. That day he had sent the fiction of the woman he loved on her final journey, and that's how it would stay. Maybe Mary Watson had never really existed – a figment she had concocted for her own purposes – but either way, his wife had died a while ago. There was nothing more to be gained from death rites and grave-sides.
A jerky nod of John's head was his only response, and he peeled himself away from Sherlock with a gasp, his lashes spiky and his cheeks flushed. Cuffing at his face, he straightened his shoulders, reaching for Rosie on autopilot. 'What do you expect to find?'
'But you tried anyway.' He swallowed, ignoring the way his heart raced at her confident assessment. He had known that his leap from the roof of Bart's would cause John pain; their friendship was unlike any Sherlock had experienced – the bond undeniable. Yet it was one thing to know it in the abstract, and another to hear someone speak as a witness to John's distress.
'Not so. In fact, Ms Norbury’s responses have rather confirmed some of my suspicions.' Sherlock sighed, his expression grim and shadowed. 'I think I know the identity of “O Dio”. The so-called middle-man.'
'Nothing is set in stone,' Sherlock pointed out, keeping his voice gentle but practical. That, as well as fear of making the wrong choice, might be hindering John's clarity. 'Don't think. Just answer. Do you want to stay in Baker Street?'
John pulled the trigger.
Sunlight poured through the window, its beam shifting as the curtains fluttered in the breeze. He’d kicked the quilt off at some point, pitching it to the floor. His t-shirt and pyjama trousers were gone too, leaving him in nothing but his underwear. A delicate shiver, so different from the feverish ones that had wracked him for days, whispered across his skin.
'It seems likely.'
‘A problem we both share,’ she pointed out, one eyebrow lifting.
In the end, it was no choice at all.
John sighed, retrieving the takeaway and grabbing some plates before helping himself. He wasn't particularly hungry, but he knew he needed to eat. Sherlock, on the other hand, flitted about the flat, nimble fingers dancing along the bookshelves and slipping into small spaces, checking picture frames and the molding on the ceiling.
The fridge and kitchen cupboards were well-stocked with food, fresh and tinned. Jars of baby mash for Rosie gleamed, and there was an expensive looking blender so he could puree things up for her, as well as boxes of formula.
'It's Molly.' He connected the call, holding it to his ear. 'Is everything all right?'
Now here he was, lost in a mire of emotion. He could not begin to fathom how he could recapture his usual indifference. There was no option for him to remove his feelings from the equation, and the resulting uncertainty was unpleasant to say the least.
John tucked his hands in his pockets, the keys to the flat nestling in the curve of his fingertips like a promise.
'Benign surveillance?' John scoffed, his eyes flashing dangerously. 'They came after us, me and Rosie. They would have done God knows what, and when we ran for it, they burnt down our fucking house! All because of
‘Let me think about it?’ he asked, holding up his hand when he saw the hope go nova in her eyes. ‘That’s not a yes, love. Now go on, go wash your hands for dinner.’
At first, he’d thought Sherlock viewed it as a job to do: a necessary part of living with John. Sweet, but to Sherlock at least, rather lacking in sentiment.
'Does John know about this?'
Sherlock hesitated before sitting down at John's side, hip-to-hip, the pair of them with their backs to the wall: and wasn't that symbolic of how John felt? Cornered and trapped. Yet Sherlock did not offer him weary little platitudes. He did not even question whether John was certain. He simply began to outline everything he had found, his deep voice a comfort all its own.
John expected there to be some sign of disturbance, a legacy of the strangers' presence, but Rosie's room remained untouched. Even the toys strewn on the floor had not been disturbed. John let out a shuddering breath, his legs trembling as the roar of adrenaline slowly ebbed.
‘God help me,’ Greg agreed with a tilt of his head. ‘I shouldn’t be, he’s that prickly sometimes. Less, though, than he was. He hardly ever bites Anderson’s head off, these days. I wonder why that might be?’
‘Battersea. Come on, John!’
'Then it would be the biggest political incident this nation has ever seen.' Mycroft's thin lips formed a bleached-out line, his murky eyes grim. 'And you say Norbury was involved?'
The power holding John captive vanished, and he locked his knees, wobbling where he stood. He wanted to sit down. Every muscle shook, jarring his bones and rattling his teeth, but he did not dare lower his gun. Moriarty may have buggered off, but – well. It seemed he wasn’t the most dangerous thing in the room after all.
John watched Sherlock pad back out of the door before turning his attention to the screen of his device. More than passive consumption felt like too much effort, and he dicked about on the Internet, glancing at the headlines only to realise Sherlock was right.
'This is it. Synchronise your watches. We all have our parts to play. John, make your move in fifteen minutes.'
Sherlock, or Mary?
It turned up one day, curled up on Sherlock’s bed as if it had been there all along. A monstrosity of a cat. You could only call it ginger because everyone knew cats weren’t red. Except this one was: chaotic, carmine stripes daubed its orange coat. It was missing most of one ear and a number of teeth. It looked like it had taken on a bus and won. It glared at John with gold-green eyes, making him feel like he should apologise for even existing.
John sucked in a breath at Sherlock's easy statement, his head whipping around to stare at him in disbelief. Surely he could see that she was lying?
'I require the crime scene photos from the night Mary was shot.'
'Perhaps.' Sherlock sighed, his expression tense. 'I feel as if she is one step ahead of us: an uncomfortable notion.'
He clenched his teeth, pulling up outside and slamming the driver's door with too much force, making the window rattle in its frame. Taking the steps two at a time, he smiled at the friendly woman on the reception desk and waited for them to bring him his daughter.
John's laugh came out strangled and thin. 'Too late for that. God, I hate her.' He stumbled back to the squashy, comfortable armchair he still thought of as his, sinking into its depths and scrubbing his hand over his face. 'Why. Just – why? I understand she needed to get away from Harmattan. I might not like it, but I can almost accept that faking her death was necessary, but to then turn around and put us at even more risk by making some kind of deal with the splinter group?'
Those who had been fighting stepped away, and John could not help but stare at the one Sherlock had picked out, watching him take off his mask to reveal blonde, curly hair slicked to his forehead and the furious set of his jaw. He threw himself down on the bench like a sulking toddler, aggravated that his fun had been brought to an end.
'Are you sure?
Sherlock wrapped steadying hands around John's biceps, his fingers digging in to the worn acrylic wool. John looked as if he had been punched in the solar-plexus, winded and hollow. His eyes were bottomless, glassy pools in his face, and Sherlock wondered how many more blows John could withstand. Mary may not have lashed out with her fists, but every new revelation was a hammer to John's bleeding, compassionate heart.
He would, one day. When he was no longer under surveillance by God-knew who. He already felt like he was living in a fishbowl, his every moment of weakness on display. That – the admission of needing professional help – seemed a step too far.
John looked around at the decimated breakfast, little more than crumbs and fruit peel, now. He'd been eating without thinking, helping himself to morsels as his brain dithered over what to do about him and Sherlock. 'Um, yeah, just one slice.' John lifted his chin, seizing the sole certainty he felt capable of mustering. 'I'm trying to build up enough strength to take a quick shower.'
Sherlock sighed, perching on the stool at the kitchen island and starting up the laptop before he dove once more into the various AGRA files. He examined them from all possible angles as his mind spun out along sparkling avenues of theory and supposition. Mary was the inception point of this, he was certain. She was the ignition and the nexus all at once. Every thread he could pluck led back to her, and Sherlock narrowed his eyes as his deductions faltered.
He'd been part of Sherlock's life long enough to know that there were those without boundaries. Nothing was sacred, not even an innocent child. They were just collateral in whatever sick game these criminals were playing. He wouldn't have Rosie fall victim to that. Not in a million years.
'And yet all the evidence points to the contrary. I imagine it began, as most things do, with a seed of potential. Harmattan are an old organisation, skilled, but they, like any other, have new recruits. Younger, happier to take risks and more in touch with a rapidly changing world. The old guard was holding them back and applying pressure to you. Perhaps you shared your plan with few trusted individuals. A way forward for you both.'
At last, the cab pulled up to the kerb. The door swung open beneath his grasp, disgorging him onto the pavement as he all but threw money at the driver, desperate to be free. The fresh evening air slapped him in the face, and he sucked it in, wrinkling his nose at London's familiar cocktail of car-exhaust and take-away.
Mycroft thought that Sherlock had left that dream behind but in his more fanciful moments, John could see the truth of it. Sherlock’s mind was his cutlass, and the treasure he sought was the next case, the next challenge, the next mystery…
‘Go.’
‘Yeah, well. Objecting parents is what we’re trying to avoid. We want Rosie to make friends, remember? Not be some kind of outcast because of –’ He waved his hand around vaguely at the flat, aware at this point that he was fretting.
‘Of course.’
There was no going back.
'And what would she want from me?' John inhaled, his nostrils flaring as he fought back a vitriolic torrent of words. Mary could rot in hell for all he cared. She'd get nothing.
He looked like a work of art: perfect and untouchable.
The cockatoo fluffed its feathers, its yellow crest flaring as Sherlock indicated their surroundings. ‘A bird that size usually only sleeps in the cage, and the door is shut and latched, meaning someone – probably our victim – made sure it was secure. One assumes she was still in possession of her eyes at the time, since it’s not something you would prioritise otherwise.’
Denial. It had to be. After the initial shock, his inability to consider the possibility of Mary's passing was the next inevitable step. He was a doctor; he knew about the so-called stages of grief; knew they weren't as linear as everyone liked to make out. There was no real rhyme or reason to it. Yet here he was, being so very textbook.
A smug smile curved Sherlock's lips, and he tilted his head: a mute promise.
Sherlock's voice unfurled in his ear, like dawn breaking over the far horizon. He emerged into the waking day of Baker Street, sweat-drenched and exhausted in the nest of the bed.
John cocked his head to listen for a reply, frowning when he heard neither footsteps nor a response. His heart lunged into his mouth as panic gripped him, a hundred garish imaginings exploding through his mind. He had not noticed any sounds of a struggle, but the people after them weren't amateurs. They could probably neutralise Sherlock without raising the alarm.
Something whispered in the back of John’s head about everything you should not give or take from the Fae. Don’t give them your name, don’t take food or shelter. Don’t give them gratitude, or you’ll owe them forever.
He could pull back, if he so wished. John's grip may be firm, but it was not a cage. He lifted his eyes to Sherlock's gaze as if daring him to comment, and Sherlock's breath whispered between his lips, coming from somewhere far deeper in his chest than normal. Butterflies thrashed beneath his navel, filling him with a bubbling cocktail of fear and excitement, dread and anticipation.
'Your things.' Sherlock hunkered down in front of John, softening his voice as he added, 'Mary's things.'
'For now.' He sat in his armchair, the leather creaking under his weight as he allowed it to support his weary frame. 'It won't last. This is a clear escalation. He needs a safehouse.' Sherlock sighed, bowing his head as he admitted, 'And Baker Street is anything but safe. It's the first place they would look.'
'I would not be a better lover than I am a flatmate.  All my habits and behaviours – they will not magically improve.'
.' Norbury's voice trembled as she jabbed her finger at the ground, indicating her current state of imprisonment.
John had never heard of it, and he raised an eyebrow as they passed several large, gated mansions. Not stately homes, but new builds, modern and understated. There were other houses, more normal ones, and a neat little high street. The car carried on through, fastidiously obeying the speed limit, until they reached a long driveway.
He drummed his fingers on the counter, staring at the sheaf of papers before him without really seeing the dense font. Instead, he was picking apart the threads of the tapestry, cutting free jewels of data from a web of irrelevance.
The cough of the silencer, the glitter of gunshot residue, and Mary throwing herself into harm's way.
‘It’s like Cairo.’ Sherlock wet his lips before shaking his head, just once. If anyone else noticed the tremor in his voice, they were not so cruel as to mention it. ‘Except not. A passing similarity, completely unconnected. It was the brother, Lestrade. If you’ll excuse me...’
Indeed, a valet in immaculate black and white stood waiting for him, a benign smile perched on his lips. He nodded in greeting, his gloved hands gripping the door and holding it open. He waited for Sherlock to pass before sweeping in and ushering him onwards through silent corridors to Mycroft's private room. No doubt it cost his brother a fortune, but it was a matter of necessity. The Diogenes Club was, above all else, discreet.
He ate when he remembered, which wasn't very often, and caught himself reaching for the whiskey more times than he would like. He always stopped before pouring a glass. He had Rosie to think of, and he was many things, but he'd never be as much of a bastard as his own father. Besides, it was a slippery slope, one that would ruin more than his own sorry life. No, better to avoid the metaphorical crutches where possible.
'John, thank fuck. I tried calling Sherlock but he's not answering. I checked out Molly's place like you asked.'
'John.' Sherlock reached out an imperious hand, beckoning him closer before twining their fingers together. 'What you have been through this past month or so is more than most people face in their lifetimes. What you are feeling, all of it, I am sure is normal, but it will take time to come to terms with it.' He wrinkled his nose, as if speaking of the uncertain frontiers of sentiment was too imprecise for his taste, but when he continued, his voice was certain. 'It may not be easy but, if it's any help at all, I'll be here for you.'
He could almost hear the commander grinding her teeth, her eyes flashing with annoyance, but at last she appeared convinced of the wisdom of his suggestion. With quick steps, she darted across the room, stripping their unconscious prisoner of his bulletproof gear, his helmet and his gun. She checked pockets and removed anything of even marginal use. 'Put that on,' she ordered Sherlock, pitching him the body armour. 'You are wounded and slower than myself or Doctor Watson, and you have the least training. It makes you more vulnerable. Do not take unnecessary risks, Mister Holmes.'
‘And?’ John shook his head, not seeing how that made Sherlock bolt from the room like a hound on the scent.
Sherlock paused, his fingers resting against his collar, caught in the act of turning it up to block out the wind that still howled beyond the door. He turned slowly; his eyes moonshine bright as he gave John a quick, quizzical look. 'You think she did it?'
Patience had never been one of Sherlock’s virtues, yet it always seemed necessary. All his life he had been waiting for others to catch up to him. His peers at school lagged behind, and then the officers at the Yard did the same. Infuriating!
How he could look so unflustered boggled the mind. John felt like his heart was about to burst out from his ribs, bloody with alarm, but Sherlock merely sneered. He had struck a nerve with his jibe at the fencer's skill, that much was clear. Now, he intended to push that advantage.
'The Dean's office. I suspect she'll have plenty to tell us that the crime scene could not.' Sherlock pushed his way through the stately double doors at the end of the corridor, never pausing in his stride.
A bitter little smile cleaved her lips as she thought of Ajay. She had lied to him. To all of them. Vivian might have been the voice of Amo, but Mary? She had been the cold, hard heart of it. Until, one day, even that wasn't enough.
‘Old injury,’ Sherlock mused, bending to Tyson’s ear as the crowd bayed and cheered. ‘Never been quite right since it happened more than twenty years ago. Give me the name, or I make it a much bigger problem.’
'Right, so she's some sort of "family friend", then. Good to know. What now? Are we going to talk to the fencing kids?'
‘Your brain retains information better when forced to put the knowledge to practical use. Keep the book, put the rest of it away.’
‘I hoped it would be.’
There was nothing more he could say, no further promises or reassurances he could offer. Such things were not in his power to give. He could not swear to John that their lives would not once again lead them in to the shadows of death or the ravages of grief. All he could do was await John's judgement, for better or worse.
By the time London's sprawl filled the horizon, John could bear it no longer, and he pointed to the services sign. 'Pull over. You must need to stretch your legs, and I want my bloody gun.'
'Did you?' Sherlock shrugged. 'I imagine if anyone had thought to check, they would have found traces of a reversible sedative in Mary's blood. Perhaps something she dosed herself with before walking into the aquarium, or as she lay on the floor. A substance that could stifle her vital signs to almost nothing without doing long-term damage. When she was speaking to you, her last words were slurred. Perfectly expected in conjunction with blood-loss. It could have been the drug taking effect.'
Drawing his knees up to his chest, John curled in on himself, focusing on every rattling breath until, at last, he could taste the air again. Around him, night's gloom lay soft and murky, but he knew he'd find no sleep again. Not after that. Wearily, he got to his feet, shuffling through the empty flat he and Mary shared. She lingered here; a whole life left behind.
Mycroft said something clipped, but judging from Sherlock's smile, it was a reluctant agreement to his request. Sherlock caught the two apples in one hand and disconnected the call with the other, setting down his burdens on the kitchen counter. He stared at the fruit, lost in thought, and John tilted his head, wiping mush from Rosie's chin.
Sherlock forced himself not to grimace as he avoided taking another look at the body. He knew death. He had seen it and inflicted it, but Mary's indifference still chilled him to the bone. She had not shot her accomplice in self-defence. He had become an inconvenience, and she had disposed of him accordingly.
'You think this is a game to me?' Mary lifted her chin, her hands falling to clench at her sides in righteous fury. 'I did this for you and Rosie. I did it to keep you safe!'
He brought Sherlock peace and passion in equal measure. He followed Sherlock through London’s unfurling street, chasing one flash of inspiration after the other, but he could also shift the gears of Sherlock’s half-mad mind, easing its spin until it hummed, rather than sparked itself to pieces.
They remembered him, outline and detail, and they were only too happy to help him fill in the blanks.
'There are some cases I've never been able to solve,' he pointed out, desperate to manage John's expectations.
John leaned back in his chair, stretching his legs out in front of him and folding his arms across his chest. Sherlock raised an eyebrow, a mute query over his thoughts, and John sighed. 'Do you think Ajay really destroyed the other copies of the files like Mary said?'
Sherlock nodded, leaving John to peruse the offerings in peace. In truth, his appetite remained sullenly absent, but he fed himself anyway, bolstering himself with sips of milky tea before attempting some cereal. The first few mouthfuls sat heavy in his belly, but after a while the uncomfortable aches turned to hunger, and he set about assuaging it with morsels of fruit before finishing with a slice of bread and butter.
A noise choked in John’s throat. Not a sob. There was nothing so human about it. Nothing so refined. It was a tight, choked wail: despair given voice despite his best efforts to lock it up tight. A shuddering hand pressed against his lips, forcing it back behind the barricade of his clenched jaw. Swallow it down. Choke on it. Let it snuff the life from him for all he cared.
'Leave that to me.' Sherlock straightened, his muscles galvanising as a plan bloomed in his mind. 'My network have located what they believe to be a base of operations for those who are watching John. I'll dig around, see what I can find, and then do something drastic: something that will keep their attention fixed very close to home.'
Nearby, Rosie whimpered, and Sherlock turned to look at her, his hands reaching out in automatic comfort. She may be oblivious to the cause of the turmoil, but that did not mean she did not feel the change in the mood around her. Many children were sensitive to the emotions of their carer, and with Mary's loss, Rosie had no doubt become supremely attached to her father.
'Be prepared. I cannot tell how this will end. Meet me in the yard outside Mrs Hudson's back door in five minutes.'
The worst part about returning to Baker Street was leaving Rosie. John realised it was necessary – knew he couldn't bring his baby girl into the viper's nest – but it still tore at his heart to watch her go.
John knew all about camouflage. He’d worn it often enough, both on the battlefield and off it. He had always been the kind of kid that blended into the background, and that didn’t change with age. People overlooked him, and that suited him just fine. He always got a little thrill when acquaintances eventually realised he was more than he seemed: a talented doctor and a bloody good shot.
John shrugged, still holding himself rigid like a creature about to either pounce or take flight. 'Yeah, well. You're a bad influence.' He rubbed his hands together, the rasp of his dry skin a soft susurrus in the peace of Baker Street. 'Was Mycroft right? Did you want... more?'
'I suppose you would know,' John rasped, but there was no bite in his words. 'Just – find out the truth, Sherlock. At this point, that's all I fucking care about.' He sniffed, blinking still-damp eyes before lifting his chin. He looked drained and spent, but beneath that fatigue a bedrock of determination remained. Mary's secrets may cause John pain, every revelation may tear at his heart, but he would rather confront the facts and push on through than bury his head in the sand.
'What was there, Mycroft? Spit it out.'
‘Look at the victim. New rolex, new phone… Look in the garage and you’ll probably find a new car, too. This shipment was used to smuggle drugs into the country. Heroin, probably, stuffed inside some of the dice.’
'Tell me how you feel. Any new symptoms?' Sherlock asked. He had no pen and notepad nearby this time, but John suspected he'd remember it and write it down later.
'Really?'
'Consider it done. And Sherlock?'
‘Just through there,’ Greg jerked his thumb over his shoulder. ‘There’s no sign of a struggle.’
Sherlock gave him a faintly fond look. ‘Hardly. You need pancakes. You were about a minute away from licking the floors, poison or not.’
Sherlock’s trust was absolute, and he made no secret of it either in bed or out of it. The realisation never failed to make John's heart skip or set off a swirl of butterflies in his belly. He wanted to laugh with the sheer joy of it, and the next kiss was a graceless clatter of teeth as John bit back a grin.
A smile flashed across Sherlock’s face, and he placed the cast down, almost reverent, before whirling away. A beckoning flick of those slender fingers had John following as Lestrade’s confused questions faded from earshot.
Gone were London's dreary, urban shadows. The trees may be stark and bare, still stripped of their leaves, but the splash of green grass and blue sky brought life into the shot. He remembered the day well, bitterly cold. He'd bundled Rosie up to her eyeballs, turning her into a marshmallow baby while wearing nothing but a thin jacket himself. He'd been frozen stiff by the time he got home, but happy, in some ways. It felt a little bit like living.
There were some days that Sherlock hated with a passion: days when every lead seemed to evaporate and every deduction contained some fatal flaw. He may be observant, but he was no seer. He could not divine answers from thin air and so, inevitably, there were rare cases that slipped through his grasp.
it'No. No.' John held up both his hands in surrender. 'Not at the question itself, I promise, more just the look on your face. Come on, I'm a doctor. You wouldn't believe some of the truly stupid things patients ask me sometimes.'
John didn't have the heart to argue with that. He'd been trying not to think about it: how bad this could get. As far as the scientists knew, the lucky ones felt nothing. They remained symptomless, going to work and whatnot and spreading it around.
He and Sherlock stripped off their protective gear in silence, depositing it in the large bucket that had been set to one side for that purpose before tapping on the door. Sally released them like a jailer opening a cell, her tight-pressed lips twisting in a half-sad, half-sarcastic kind of smile. ‘Find anything?’
'Tell me?'
The memory of John's words struck him like bullets. He recalled the lightning of rage and pain crackling in those eyes; the way he spoke through gritted teeth, as if that bony barricade was all that held back his screams; his fists, clenched as if he longed to lash out, to share his agony with crashing knuckles and thudding bruises.
