John raised an eyebrow and looked at Aaron, crossing his arms. The other man's smile widened even more.
"I know". Of course, he believed his friend. Mycroft not only had the opportunity, but also the motivation to write to him right now. He did not doubt his intentional action. Apparently, he couldn't resist irritating him even a little. Right now, when he and John were heading into the apartment to seal their relationship. Sherlock, however, did not intend to let this little malice of Mycroft affect his good mood. He clenched his fingers tighter, giving John a hint that they should not stop on their way home. "Forget about Mycroft. You are with me now."
The man kept his eyes on them, expressing his dissatisfaction. He was not happy with the sudden awakening and the whole situation he had seen. Sherlock didn't look upset, what's more, he didn't pull away from his friend.
"Yes ... But you don't have to come with me. You can stay in our apartment or go to the city. You can decide. It's our penultimate day, so you don't have to worry about anything anymore."
"Hmm ...", the detective gave a smug grunt in response. He turned his head to the street with a barely visible smile on his face.
"It stopped being fun after our first night together, John," he interrupted immediately, turning his body completely toward him.
Mycroft's secrecy and his foresight made John feel safe knowing that he was in charge of the government.
"I must," he sighed. "To make up for what I have thrown out of my mind, and John considers it important. I noticed that he appreciates your knowledge and insight in many areas."
He stood bent over, his hands resting on the rough wall. He lowered his gaze, but the light of the police lamp lying nearby forced him to look at the lit face of the victim. He focused on her to distract his thoughts from the insistent movements of his attacker. Despite the circumstances, he noticed her open eyes, slightly parted lips and thick curls glued to her forehead and finally... her throat... cut from ear to ear. She lay motionless in her blood. Red liquid soaked into the corners of the shawl, still surrounding her slender shoulders. She stared at the street as if waiting to be rescued.
This tense situation lasted a long time. Mycroft's face had to show a lot of emotion because John started to chuckle. The sound was so different and so appealing, the older man must have felt it in his own lips. He kissed John and absorbed even the slightest sound. When he pulled up to take a deep breath, he brushed his nose with his nose.
"From the day you went with Mycroft to Italy," Sherlock said casually while shrugging his shoulders.
There were more people around the bridge than on St. Mark's Square. At least, that was their impression when they approached the sixteenth-century relic. The pleasant smell of tasty dishes and fresh air replaced the smell of sweat and bland perfumes. Somehow they managed to get to the middle of the bridge and then to the stone railing. It was mainly due to Sherlock, who did not care about other people and led John by the hand to the very end. They found a free place. Only now they managed to breathe and get rid of the terrible smells from their noses.
John shuddered at the sound of his familiar name. He looked at Sherlock with his eyes wide open and gritted his teeth.
"I had to say it first because you would never do it ... At least not using Â words." He looked down. He tried to control his emotions and his raging heart. "I'm sorry I didn't do this sooner." He rubbed his eyes again and took a step towards the window. For a moment he focused on the streaks of rain and dark clouds that engulfed the streets of London. "I was too much of a coward to say it, even though I really wanted to. At first, I had to question who I was and who I wanted to be in the eyes of others. I was afraid of the reaction and rejection of my family, friends ..." he paused and added shaking his head with disapproval "...and people who are strangers to me". He realized how much time he had wasted, fearing something that didn't matter anyway. "From the beginning, I admired you for not pretending to be somebody you are not and for always being yourself no matter what the situation." He turned his head towards Sherlock. He felt a bit calmer. "I love you for the fact that, although you are sometimes awkward in dealing with emotions and feelings, you devote yourself to people who are close to you and I love you for what you are able to do for them."
"Not only you," John agreed with her, nodding slightly. His hand was still itching from impact. He moved his fingers, remembering the previous night. When he looked up from his hand, he saw that his friend was watching him intensely.
He left the bathroom covered in a towel and noticed prepared clothes, lying on the bed. Gray pants, white shirt, and vest. Mycroft didn't even leave him the option of choosing underwear and shoes, though John knew the older man had done it out of habit rather than care. He dressed up and entered the living room. Mycroft ordered breakfast. It was waiting for John on a table and covered with a silver lid. They ate breakfast like that almost every morning because the older man shunned the company of other people and used to eat alone, but John didn't mind. He looked away and ignored the sound his stomach made. He focused his eyes on Mycroft. Genius leaned for John's shoes, thrown on the ground. He paid no attention to him. Without a word, he put his shoes under the wall and pulled out his phone.
"If that satisfies you and makes you stay with me, I don't mind either." Red cheeks adorned Sherlock's porcelain face as he gave him a reassuring smile. "But give up the hope that I will be will be affectionate towards him," he added, looking at Mycroft with a little disgust. "This is a line that I will not cross."
It all began on the spring day when he was introduced to the most representative person in the country for the first time. He was still young and inexperienced, but at the same time convinced that one day both the queen and the other members of the royal family would address him with respect and with requests so that he could solve their problems. When he stood before the queen, he was neither scared nor overwhelmed by the presence of the monarch. He examined her with a careful look but kept his conclusions to himself. For some reason, he immediately gained her trust and later sympathy. One day she took him for a walk in her gardens. She asked why, as one of the few of her subordinates, he has no wife yet. The question surprised him so much that he only managed to make a short answer. He learned that the presence of the ring on his finger allows him to win a greater trust of other people. They have the impression that the owner of the ring is more emotionally and life-stable and thus has a lower propensity to cheat and take risks. She made him realize that the most important thing is the presence and first impression, and whether the illusion in which the others believe is real does not matter. It doesn't matter if power is involved. He believed her. After all, nobody knew more about this type of matter than her. He felt greater respect and admiration for her that day. He followed her instructions and suggestions, and a week later he bought a gold ring and put it on his finger. When he was asked about the reason and when the judgments were made, he did not correct their erroneous conclusions. He let others believe what they wanted. Slowly and reluctantly, he started playing a game of appearances, but he was sure of his skills. He didn't see anything wrong with it, so he kept going into the cobwebs of lies, that he easily controlled.
Molly looked at him in surprise. He had to refrain from laughing when he saw her face. So naive, so silly.
He didn't have to turn to know that Francesca was nodding her head in agreement. Molly was even more confused and he looked down.
"He doesn't let you rest, huh?" John's nagging tone didn't force Mycroft to turn away and look at him.
"Then be kind enough to make me aware ..." the genius interrupted him with a still sarcastic smile, "what do you think I'm going to do?"
Sherlock grabbed John's face in both hands and ran his tongue over his bottom lip, catching greedily at his every sigh. He even began to chew on in to make him react more. Obstinacy and passion were full in Sherlock's kisses. He came even closer to John, crushing his body against his chest.
He could still hear the sound of water and Sherlock's voice. It was relaxing after such a hard day. John listened to these sounds, but some time later something else caught his attention. A car stopped outside their apartment. He heard the front door open and then the steps on the stairs. He turned his head to see Mycroft standing in the doorway.
Time passed slowly and monotonously. The gondola was slowly sliding on the water. John heard the splash of water as the man pulled out and dipped the paddle. The sounds of nightlife mixed in the middle of the canal. They heard happy conversations and music from nearby cafes. John heard the whirring of speedboats and the laughter of people sitting in restaurants along the canal. However, his heart was loudest. It beat with great power. He wondered if Mycroft had heard that too. At one point the gondola turned into a narrow channel. It looked like one of the streets nearby, but instead of stones and concrete, they moved on the water. If John wanted, he could reach out and touch the walls of buildings without any problems, examining their structure. Stone, old and damp walls had to hide more than one secret. They flowed under low bridges. John looked at the gondolier. The man never bowed his head, so he almost brushed the bottom of the bridge with his hair. After the third bridge he passed in this way, John realized the man did not pay attention to what he was doing. It would not be surprising, he had to know all the ways by heart after all, but the main problem was that instead of the road, he was staring at John and was smiling at him. When John realized he had been under his observation almost from the beginning, he blushed and looked away. His only comfort was that it was night, and the tall buildings covered the moonlight that would betray his embarrassment.
"I have to find something," said Mycroft, looking at them. He cleared his throat and straightened his matted hair. "I will be right back".
"Forgive me, brother, but I must enlighten you. You are not the center of the world, it is not only about you. I'm talking to John and it's his decision. You have no right to impose anything on him".
He did not answer. With a raised head, he accepted the invitation to confrontation. He wondered how long Sebastian had watched him, that he had even counted the number of bullets fired. He also had to see the way he was looking at his friend. He turned his face to the glass room at the back of the shooting range. He wasn't surprised by what he saw. Mycroft and Sherlock watched them in suspense and silence. The older brother held a hand on the younger man's chest and tried to stop him from running out of the room. Sherlock looked like he was about to move toward them at any moment. The grip on John's shoulder became even stronger. He thought Sebastian was about to break his bone. He grimaced, looked at him, and grabbed his wrist. He knew he had no chance with him. Whenever Sebastian wanted, he showed how great strength lay in his athletic body. John clenched his fingers as hard as he could and looked him in the eye.
The sudden stop of the cab made his body fall forward. It was only because of his quick reaction that his face did not land on the tail of one of the horses. Both animals snorted and clapped their hooves on the cobblestone street. By the time he had absorbed what Holmes had said, the detective had already got out of the cab and paid the coachman. The cab was unstable. It flexed and tilted with every major movement. Awkwardly, in a slight tilt, he moved to the edge of the cab. He put his foot on the metal footrest. However, he did so carelessly. The sole of his shoe slipped, making him lose his balance. He would have fallen directly at Holmes, but his cane and his quick reaction saved him from falling to the curb. He breathed a small sigh of relief as he straightened up and looked at the detective.
John hesitated with a strange expression that made Mycroft focus his attention on him. "It may surprise you, but I like it when you are near me. For some reason, I enjoy your presence and I really would prefer you not to sit alone in the hotel, but come with us" he fell silent. "With me," he added a little quieter.
Sherlock didn't answer for a moment, but he finally straightened up and looked at them. "Something that is here, but from a logical point of view should not be. Look for single folders, papers, maybe tiles. Everything that lies separately and does not match the rest."
"But the newspapers said that this congress would take place there ..." John did not hide his surprise. He watched Mycroft, who had just finished working on the laptop. He closed it slightly and turned to John.
"Sherlock ... I wasn't going to pull you into it again. It wasn't my idea. I wanted to keep you away from it, but others insisted. They concluded that since you know his organization and know how it works, you will be perfect to manage this operation. Initially, we wanted to include you in the management center, but I knew that John would not let you deal with this problem alone. " He looked at John. "I am also convinced that my brother would not allow being separated from you again, doctor." He turned his head toward his brother again. "So we agreed that you both will participate in this mission. However, the final decision will be yours."
"Mary Sue Collins was the first prostitute he murdered. I knew then she would not be the last victim. I followed the case and initially tried to get the police to take it seriously."
They fell silent. John enjoyed the peace and Sherlock finished smoking a cigarette. John opened his eyes only when he heard the ship passing in the distance or the laughter of people. He wanted this moment to last as long as possible. A moment without worries, stress and with his best friend at his side. He started to miss home and his bed on Baker Street, but somewhere deeply he regretted it was his last moments in this beautiful and mysterious city. It was also hard to admit, he felt some kind of sadness when he thought his moments with Mycroft would end soon ...
"And you are surprised because...?" John asked in a low voice and looked at Aaron. "We have nothing to talk about. But you have the opportunity to try what you've been training so passionately on me over the past week. You should do better with women."
This question got Sherlock out of a weird state. He blinked several times and looked up. He slowly approached him, but what surprised John the most was that he was staring straight into his eyes. As if he saw something unusual in them or as if he was afraid to look elsewhere. Like he was ... ashamed? John shook his head and snorted softly under his breath. He couldn't believe that Sherlock was still not used to seeing his naked chest after so many years. He looked away and again focused on the objects on the bedding.
Holmes very slowly raised his eyes. He looked at him gravely. "Yesterday the police found two bodies."
"I don't understand. You always keep saying, I should experiment and try what I haven't had before."
As he approached the table, he did not take his eyes off the detective who was still staring at him. He took his seat with a pounding heart as he felt the gaze penetrating his neck. His breathing stopped for a second as Holmes bent over him with the magnifying glass in his hand. A shudder of anxiety and excitement ran through his body. He gasped for air, tried to control his trembling lungs. He took the magnifying glass, but Holmes did not release it for a long time, dragging out the moment when their fingers were tangled on its handle. He shuddered as the detective intentionally ran his fingertip over his skin and then along his arm.
"Forgive me, John, that I'm destroying your opinion of me. But I don't feel like playing this game at all. You will have to realize we are all humans, not idealized characters from your stories," the genius snarled and surprised John completely. He had not seen him like this yet. It was as if he were on the verge of aggression.
John heard his humbleness in his voice. He smiled slightly under his breath and stood beside the silent Sherlock. He exchanged amused looks with him. While Josh was trying to help Arian get down the rock safely, Sebastian pulled out a lighter and a pack of cigarettes. He lit one cigarette and observed the others in silence.
"Yes, yes. Besides, you are educated, you have the right qualities and in the opinion of many ordinary people, you are considered a handsome man. The perfect partner for Mycroft, who he can show off to his friends ..." the younger genius murmured and returned to research.
"I'm sorry to hear that," he said immediately. He froze for a moment when quick and steady steps sounded on the stairs. After the first few steps he guessed who was about to appear in the door, he closed his eyes again and leaned back comfortably on the back of the chair.
"Alcohol is not a good idea at this early hour," the bartender added, staring at the glass he was cleaning with a white tissue.
John tilted his head as the first finger sank into him, almost to the end. Mycroft watched his reaction with open mouth and blurred eyes. He tried to catch every grimace on John's face as he pushed his fingers deep into him. He tried to find the prostate and when he succeeded, he immediately added two more fingers. John's moans became louder and uncontrollable. He writhed under the body of an older man who couldn't take his eyes off him. Sweat soaked into the sheets and John felt like more stimulation would drive him crazy. Mycroft took out his fingers and hung over John.
"Mycroft, I'm fed up with indecision for today. Tell me what you want because I'm tired of waiting".
John never thought that his decision would upset Sherlock to this level. Genius had not spoken to him for several days and avoided being alone with him. Even last night, when John was standing by the door with a very small carry-on suitcase, his friend was playing the violin by the window without turning around.
John's surprised voice pulled him out of his thoughts. He turned to him. The first thing that caught his eye was the doctor's silver hair, shimmering in the sunlight, dark blue eyes and tanned skin, which contrasted unusually with the color of his hair. He saw the bags in his hands and a list - most likely a shopping list - sticking out of his trousers pocket. It was only after a while that he saw Mrs. Hudson. She was a little less overjoyed to see him, which was completely understandable. The surprise and then almost panic in her eyes made him focus on her longer.
"Holmes... I ...", he finally managed to make himself look at the window. Hot, pulsating blood filled his cheeks. He heard laughter from across the room.
"Yes, John? What's the matter?" he asked, focusing all his attention on him. He gave him a warm look and a gentle smile to improve his mood a little.
He sighed. He realized how close he was now lying on the morgue table among the other dead people. That his good luck was slowly coming to an end. He had to be careful. He realized that had it not been for Holmes and the increasingly intimate bond between them, he would have thrown himself into the vortex of events and would probably have died in a very pathetic way. He decided to stay close to the detective from now on.
"If you think you can't eat them, we'll order something else. You should be happy to try the exotic flavors, John." Sherlock didn't even hide his satisfaction. He stared at the friend who shook his head in amusement. After several minutes they were holding glasses with the most expensive red wine served by the restaurant.
"Let's say ..." said Holmes after a long silence, "we share a common passion. Or part of it." He continued, seeing the curiosity on his face. "Professor Moriarty is a man who appreciates and takes full advantage of his intellect. However, he puts competition above reason. A competition... with me," he said, trying to avoid the puddles on the ground. "He likes to be active in the same fields as me. He likes to have what I have. He challenges me and expects I'll solve any problem he leaves for me. If it weren't for his exorbitant ambitions and jealousy, he would be a very interesting companion. That's almost all you need to know about him".
"For heaven's sake," he whispered. He lowered his head and let out a soft sigh of relief ... and amusement. Cat. It was a goddamn cat. He shook his head in disbelief. He glanced at the animal that found its way inside one of the houses and disappeared for good. All the tension in his body was gone. He relaxed his shoulders and thought that he would come back safely to his room tonight after all. He continued on his way with a lighter heart. His own reaction amused him. What was the chance he would be the one to stumble upon Jack the Ripper? A murderer would have to be insane to attack less than a day after his last murder. The whole city was looking for him, and Whitechapel was patrolled by dozens of policemen right now. The Ripper must have realized that another attack would be too risky for him.
"This city has something appealing," Sherlock muttered, looking around again as if to emphasize that he actually meant what he had said.
Sherlock nodded understandingly. He followed his friend, who was still looking around. "There," he signed at someone in the crowd.
Sherlock didn't answer, he just muttered something under his breath. John noticed only now, they were walking side by side. It seemed a little out of place because his friend usually walked half a step ahead of him. John always had to make an effort to keep up with Sherlock's long legs. It was strange to talk to him when he was forced to turn his head sideways.
John didn't have time to ask how Sherlock knew such things when Mycroft reappeared in their apartment. He firmly opened the door and stood in the middle of the room.
"Thank you for your concern, John. I really appreciate it, but I have a private doctor. I don't expect any diagnosis or recommendations from you ..." Mycroft looked at his husband, who was still adamant and stared at him with frowns. The older man finally sighed and leaned back in his chair.
He was grateful, she finally understood his signals. He did not intend to answer her attempts to chat, and although it was not right for him to plug his ears, he was relieved when the cabin went quiet. He could focus on the only reason he set out on this journey. He could also analyze all possible scenarios that were to result from his sudden arrival. He smiled at the thought, but on the other hand, he felt an incomprehensible nervousness that did not leave him until the end of the flight.
Sherlock wanted to smile. The girl asked the same questions that John asked Mycroft. But she did it more directly and with a less friendly voice.
"I was looking for you," John said in a warm tone. He felt that Mycroft was having a hard time. When Mrs. Coletti released his elbow, he bowed slightly at her, then approached Mycroft and faced the strange but good-looking man.
"That's enough!" said John. He was fed up with this absurd situation and bizarre discussion. He still couldn't understand what had happened in those few minutes. He looked at Sherlock and Mycroft. His raised tone caught their attention. "Mycroft, I'll pretend I didn't hear your proposition. I don't even want to wonder if you were serious or not. Forgive me, but I have to go to the hospital, I'm on duty". Before John slammed the door, he looked one last time at Sherlock and Mycroft. He had the impression that the brothers were fighting a silent war. He did not support any of them, because no matter who won, he was always their only victim.
His thoughts were interrupted by a low chuckle. He turned his head and almost moaned when he noticed Aaron standing next to him and holding a glass of champagne. Stoner watched John with a smile.
Sherlock shrugged as if it didn't matter to him at all. And of course, it didn't. It was Mycroft's place after all, and if he had the opportunity, he wanted to irritate his pedantic brother a little. "If it bothers him that much, he can sleep on the couch. You should be okay with that," he added with a small smile.
He twitched nervously, turning his head. He breathed a sigh of relief because Holmes's voice was coming from the same place as before. "Namely?".
It was a surprise. Aaron couldn't say a word for a few seconds. Did Miss Hooper have her own opinion and enough morality to resist his request after all? What happened, she showed him the side of her personality she was hiding and perhaps she was not aware of herself? ... Ah. Of course. It was obvious. Why didn't he think about it before? Molly cared about Sherlock, even if it was obvious that her feelings were not mutual. When he met John for the first time, his people and agents found all the facts about the doctor. The most fun for him was that they did it right under Mycroft's nose. He learned about John's preferences, his work, place of residence, family and friends. He found out who Sherlock was to him and how much they had in common. Poor Molly Hooper fell into the trap of unrequited love and although she knew her feelings for Sherlock did not make sense, she was still unable to forget or get rid of them. The sentiment was very debilitating. It was a terrible weakness, but it can also be a power. He had proof in front of him. Molly might have allowed him to manipulate her, but her loyalty was as strong as her other feelings. Oh well. Aaron realized he had to try harder. He wasn't worried about it, because he knew that sooner or later he would get his way. And now at least it won't be so boring for him. In the end, he enjoyed every challenge, even a small and trivial one like Molly Hooper.
The penetrating gaze sent shivers down his spine, and its intensity made it impossible for him to take his eyes off him. The proud posture of the man dominated him even from a distance and made him quite uncomfortable. A long silence, broken by muffled conversation on the other side of the building, penetrated his bones. Eventually, he shook off the strange trance. He grabbed the front of the bowler hat in a gesture of greeting and nodded slightly.
John smiled slightly. So what if the bullet penetrated the very corner of the target, passing absolutely every line of the drawn man? The most important thing was Josh's joy and the fact that after so many days he finally managed to aim and hit the target. That target was a large cardboard shield hanging several dozen feet away. Of course, it was pure luck, but John was not going to take his moment of happiness away. He lowered his hands and turned his head towards him.
John felt Sherlock was tense as if he was afraid of his reaction to this invitation. He wasn't going to refuse him. He shook his head with a smile and looked right at the living room windows where Mycroft was working on the laptop. The scattered light indicated that the older man was still busy, so John looked at his friend again. Sherlock already knew his answer and also knew that John was not going to tell Mycroft where and with whom he was going.
The food disappeared from the plates as quickly as the wine from the glasses. Maybe even faster. This time the conversation focused on wine. Their types, color, and the best plantations. Mycroft was familiar with the subject, as John noted. He was glad that the genius was able to discuss not only important topics related to politics and the world, but he had a conversation in which everyone could understand and join. From time to time, he added his thoughts and comments, just like Francesca did. Not knowing when and how they started talking about his relationship with Mycroft, making the genius ostentatiously rolled his eyes.
Genius tensed his body. He did not expect such words as the beginning of the conversation. For a moment he felt his heart stop beating in his chest, but when he looked into John's eyes he relaxed his muscles. There was a slight concern in his eyes, but there was no sign of pain or fear. So it was not about rejection, but rather about taking action. About a hard task, he had to do. John was mentally preparing to meet with Mycroft.
John's honest questions made Mycroft straighten up and change his expression. His interest was proof that he was considering the possibility of joining the mission to Sherlock's huge dissatisfaction. Mycroft's younger brother did not even pretend to be interested in participating in his plans. He watched him with a displeased face, and his clenched jaw indicated that he could barely control his body. He wanted to grab John by the hand and lead him out of the building. Mycroft was even happy that Sherlock had not yet managed to tell John about his feelings and refrained from acting, otherwise, his jealousy and protection would put them in an uncomfortable situation. "Our people have been dealing with this issue in detail for several years. They have been able to determine more or less where the center of his organization is and where they keep the most important information." He paused for a moment, remembering how many people had given their lives to this mission so far. "They managed to confirm the four most likely hiding places, but the margin of error was exhausted. We can't let them guess our moves. We have to go out on a limb."
The meeting of politicians, advisers and other government figures from around the world lasted for over two hours. They were sitting behind a glass door, in a part of the hotel that John had not known before. The rest of the company - the wives, husbands, and partners of politicians - spent time talking in the restaurant. Some of them visited the hotel or gossiped at the bar. They had a good time, but for John this morning went on forever. He felt it was some form of punishment. Mycroft must have been aware that sitting idle in one place was the worst option for John. This senseless sitting for hours was supposed to show him who ruled in their relationship. Francesca saved John's situation. She was always with him and she looked after him, so it wasn't the worst possible punishment. That's why Mycroft's plan would fail, if not for one detail - John was terribly sleepy and tired. He had not slept in almost thirty hours, and his only desire was to get on the bed, close his eyes and cuddle up in the big, soft pillow. Such a lack of sleep would not impress him a few years earlier, because life in the army taught him that he could carry out his duties without rest. Sometimes two hours of sleep was enough for him, for the whole day. However, this skill faded with time, as did the other talents he acquired in Afghanistan.
Her touch reminded him of his mother's. It was affectionate and loving. He wanted more. He tilted his head and slightly cuddled into her pleasantly cool hand. He watched her with a smile and thought about the phenomenon of saying that opposites attract. Mr. and Mrs. Coletti differed so much and yet they loved each other. She was warm, delicate but dominant, he stood a bit in the shadow of his wife. He was nervous and rarely lost his temper at home, as Sherlock noted. How could two different personalities live together for so many years? Perhaps for similar reasons he was attracted to the Holmes brothers? John was thinking very hard when he felt someone stood next to his chair. Francesca looked up and smiled slightly, not letting go of John's hand. He looked away and noticed Molly. She was a little nervous and embarrassed.
"Answer, Mycroft. I prefer not to risk it. He is probably furious," John tried to control his voice.
The quarrel started for good, but neither Sherlock nor John paid any attention to it. They managed to get through the main window into the hall. They helped Molly and quietly headed for the stairs. When they were out of sight of Stoner's people, John stopped and leaned his back against the wall. He looked at Sherlock. They stared at each other for a moment, then John snorted softly and shook his head smiling. At that moment he understood the absurdity of the whole situation. Sherlock also laughed. He giggled noiselessly and rubbed his fingers at the corners of his eyes. Molly, who straightened the creased folds of the dress, looked at them and smiled under her breath. How could three adults cause so much chaos in such a short time? And how did not they feel the consequences of their actions yet? John couldn't understand how he got into this situation and why he liked it so much. When they managed to control their amusement, they went down the stairs.
"Conversations with Sherlock are never the same, John. I can't decide what to talk about and how it will end. You are aware, he usually takes control over the discussion and all you have to do is adjust to him and hear his complaints. I will have no other choice in this case either. Especially after what happened ... "
"Murder!" he shouted, straightening up on the sofa. The blanket slipped to the floor. The room suddenly felt familiar to him, and he realized that the events of the night before had really happened. Looking around, he saw Holmes staring at him from behind an unfolded newspaper. He was sitting at the table next to the slightly ajar window.
The three of them headed to the large hall that decorated the ground floor of the hotel. The creamy marble staircase with red carpet and the lack of even the smallest dirt continued to impress John. He liked every inch of the building, as did the hall where guests could relax and immerse themselves in their thoughts, with the choice of every existing and of course unimaginably expensive coffee in the world. They took a seat opposite the porter's lodge. Almost immediately, a dark-eyed waitress in a white shirt and black hair found her way to their table. She was young but experienced, Sherlock noted. Her enthusiasm and care, as she wrote orders, said a lot about her character and the work she had dreamed of since she was a child. She was the perfect example that waiters' attitudes toward customers influenced their orders because both John and Molly had asked for things they wouldn't normally eat. All because of the waitress's friendly smile, her nice voice, and gentle character.
They looked at each other again. John's face was red and he cleared his throat nervously as he used to do in stressful situations. He wanted to sink to the ground when he realized what situation he was in. With a flower in his hand, in the company of his best friend who just kissed him in front of hundreds of people on the bridge called 'bridge of lovers'. He rubbed his face with his free hand. "Sometimes I don't know if you do it deliberately or if you have a terrible sense of time and place."
"And we also, as I see." Mycroft did not hide his good mood. Only John reacted with a frown, though he was still smiling.
"The documents should be ready yesterday. If you are unable to arrange them in time, we will have to consider whether our further cooperation makes sense." Mycroft's tone was cold and very official. John thought he must have sounded like that whenever he worked. Mycroft leaned over the laptop keyboard and started writing something with one hand, his other hand still busy with the telephone.
"Do you have any idea who this killer is?" he asked, trying to distract the detective's attention. He was afraid were his thoughts wandered, and it was useless to guess because Holmes's face was composed. He showed no feelings. Only the fiery gleam in his eyes showed that he was alive and he was thinking. "You question people, you investigate crime scenes. So you must have at least one suspect."
"It's just like I thought. You're a double-faced snake, but you don't lack cowardice too," he said and surprised Aaron.
John felt worse because of that. He did not expect big things, but such obvious ignorance and lack of any interest caused him pain. He fidgeted impatiently until the end of the journey, and when the gondola reached the shore, he wanted to jump out of it first, so he did not have to look at this performance any longer.
"Oh, my dear Watson!" the detective continued rubbing his hair with the towel. "Forgive me for making you wait so long. I had to meet someone and deal with an urgent matter."
John forced himself not to frown. He clung even closer to his husband's shoulder and came up with an idea that none of the men probably expected. He wrapped his hand around Mycroft's. It was warm and delicate. Mycroft's body tensed and froze.
Due to a large number of tourists who visited the beautiful Basilica of La Salute, they had to wait in line almost until noon. Sherlock was patient as usual, although he had never been interested in architecture before, so it was strange he waited so long without a whimper just to see something that had no valuable knowledge that he would need in the future. They finished the tour after 1 PM. They were struck by the terrible heat and crowds of tourists when they went outside. They decided to eat something before other people will feel hungry too. They realized they would not have a chance to find a place in any restaurant if they left it for later. John carefully watched his friend's behavior as they walked towards 'Agli Alboretti'. It was a small restaurant they chose earlier. John was still thinking about Sherlock's behavior. There had to be some explanation for his ignorance. He couldn't just change his mind day by day. Did he plan to have a war with him? Did he irritate him on purpose? What was his plan? Where was the obtrusive but charming Sherlock who was seeking his attention? He did not want him to behave like this every day - he would not bear it in London - but he did not understand this sudden change. Sherlock was up to something, but John had no idea what exactly.
They stood in silence with smiles on their faces. John enjoyed such moments. He felt a thrill at the thought of the coming weeks, which was associated with the fact that his best friend would be right at his side. Sherlock also seemed excited. They behaved as if they did not understand or did not allow themselves to think that they might not return from this dangerous mission. The most important thing was what they had now. They left negative thoughts behind them. John remembered the emotions that accompanied him during his mission in Afghanistan. He had to admit that he missed it, although everyday life with Sherlock was also full of unusual and dangerous situations. But now they had to do a much more serious task that they were ready to face. Together. Hand in hand. In Sherlock's mind, such thoughts must prevail too. He stood with a cheerful face, staring at John and looking like he was about to say something more. John has seen such a face more and more recently. He wondered what that meant.
He smiled when he thought Mycroft could be his prince charming. He was not the ideal partner and John somehow could not imagine little girls staring at the TV screen and sigh at such a prince with such character and vices. Of course, he knew, he had many vices, and he wasn't perfect too, but the thought of Mycroft - the prince, amused him so much he didn't even notice the two people who sat at the table next to him.
"Ha! Even before leaving home. There is nothing to pore over the choice. What will you take, you will take. There will be no turning back and we will have to manage somehow".
John nodded and walked slowly down the street with Mycroft. They passed a few streets and finally saw the sign of a modest but charming restaurant 'Bistrot de Venise'. Mycroft stepped inside and waited for John. When the waiter saw Mycroft he bowed slightly and led them both to a separate room that was intended only for them. John enjoyed the surroundings once again that night. The restaurant had a red-yellow room decorated with paintings and sculptures. John looked at Mycroft sitting in front of him, who was taking off his jacket and was looking at him with a small smile on his face. It took a few moments for the waiter to accept the order and leave them alone.
They walked back to Danieli Hotel, holding hands and saying nothing. Every time John gathered his courage to start a conversation, all he needed was one glance at Mycroft watching him, and all his determination and confidence disappeared in the blink of an eye. He could not see it, but every time he did it, an invisible smile appeared on the older man's face. When they arrived, Mycroft nodded in greeting to the hotel manager and still gripping John's hand tightly, he climbed the stairs to the apartment.
The tepid water was very pleasant to his skin. John stood with his eyes closed and let his mind wander. He didn't know what time it was and he wasn't interested in it too much. He wanted to relax. When he opened his eyes he saw a bottle of expensive gel. It belonged to Mycroft. Genius always hid his things, but not this time. John's hand reached for the bottle. He opened it and put the gel under his nose.
They were silent. John could hear the sound of his blood running in his head. He felt a burning sensation on his fingers. He had not used his strength for a long time, and now he was afraid that maybe he was exaggerating a little. At that moment he was so angry, so blinded by the desire to put Stoner in his place that he couldn't control himself and hit him with all the power he had. Strangely enough, the man stayed on his feet. What's more, he smiled and left the room on his own. John was about to shake his head in disbelief, but he didn't. When they were alone, he sat down slowly on the sofa without a word. He wanted to be alone for a while. He wanted to disappear and think about what had happened. He put his elbow on the backrest and covered his eyes with his fingers. The seat next to him buckled under someone's weight. He knew it was Sherlock. After a long, protracted moment that seemed like an eternity, he finally looked up. He immediately looked at Mycroft, who was sitting opposite him. He was finishing smoking his cigarette. His thoughts must have gone far because he sat staring at nothing. He probably felt he was being watched because he finally looked at John.
It was a warm morning. A light breeze reached them from the open window. They heard the conversations of tourists who stood outside the hotel and waited for free gondolas. John sipped his tea on the couch, and Mycroft stood in an open window. One more step would be enough and he would go out onto the small balcony. The bedding and pillow disappeared from the sofa before John woke up. He wondered if Mycroft slept that night at all.
John also felt somehow strange because of this unusual intimacy. "Sebastian ... has always been rough," he said to break the silence. "I doubt if he realizes his strength and the fact that he hurts others." He knew he should bite his tongue. Talking with Sherlock about Moran could end up telling him what he wanted to forget. Sherlock had the gift of getting information out of people, even the most secretive and personal, and John did not want to explain his relationship with Sebastian. Relationships that ended almost ten years earlier. He had to direct his friend's thoughts to other tracks, so he leaned over and reached for one of the pistols. He ran his fingers over its shiny structure. "Colt M1911. The best gun I've ever had in my hand. If I had one in Afghanistan, maybe I wouldn't get a shot."
John only now realized his friend was right. He grabbed the phone from the table and approached the bathroom. He heard the sound of water but knocked anyway. "Answer it" he muttered. He didn't hear the answer, so he slightly opened the door and put his hand with the phone inside. "Answer it," he repeated.
"Jo..." he did not finish. The security guards pulled him into the next room, but before they slammed the door, Sherlock saw something on his face that bothered him for a long time. He saw disbelief, desperation, and concern.
His throat was dry. Due to the detective's plainness or his complete lack of timing and place. He couldn't decide. Without saying a word, he stared at the detective, who was coming closer. His eyes involuntarily wandered to a mouth that he couldn't resist even at that moment. The creak of the door and the familiar voice stopped him from making his next move.
"Franco also helped, with his passion for wine although he did it unknowingly. John and Mycroft left me slightly drunk and in a good mood. It was obvious they were attracted to each other. Either Mycroft will stop to be so tense, or Sherlock will break his insecurity. Either way, I'm sure tonight one of them will win John's heart over, you will get what you want and you will go to sleep knowing that preparations for the upcoming Christmas will take you less time. "
"You can be sure they will be fine. I never change my mind. Your hospital will get a grant, even if our plan fails."
"I am not blaming you for anything like that. But at least tell me why Stoner's presence is changing you so much? You are either annoyed or happy lately. Neither of these emotions suits you."
"Thank you, John. This is really important to me. You will learn everything you will need next week. But now it will probably be better if I leave you two alone ..." with these words he reached out his hand to John. The doctor stood up and returned the handshake. This time Mycroft had a real smile on his face. Second later elder Holmes disappeared on the stairs.
"Whatever you think about, the answer is yes" Sherlock gave his brother an understanding look and nodded almost invisibly. He stood motionless between the armchair and the table, staring at him uncertainly.
"Sherlock ... No matter how cold you treat others and how cold you want to be, you can't exist that way. Each of us must have someone's support."
John didn't like this conversation. He became more and more convinced that it would be better if Stoner did not get any evidence of their deception. Whatever he planned, Mycroft was supposed to be the main victim, but not the only one. It made him worried. Because Mycroft would only have to swallow the bitter pill of losing the game and lose the trust of some people, but the others would feel more strongly the effects of Stoner's determination. John preferred not to risk a real competition with a man as intelligent as Mycroft.
Sherlock stopped listening. The investigation immediately seemed boring and unworthy of attention from Scotland Yard. This could interest and be a challenge for the suburban police station and ordinary policemen, whose only income was interest on parking tickets or fine for drinking alcohol under a 24-hour store. The district's name also influenced his indifference. Lambeth. He never liked it. Especially since John was almost stabbed there and run over by some drunken madman. Of course, Sherlock was proud when his friend easily overpowered both the madman with a knife and the one behind the wheel, catching him up on one of the corners and pulling the key out of the ignition. Nevertheless, he associated the Lambeth district badly. Instead of hearing more facts about the investigation, he preferred to focus on thinking about John. Although the inspector's constant talk disturbed him, he took advantage of his gift of double attention. He was thinking about John while looking at Greg. At one point, he saw him pull a pen out of his jacket pocket. It was definitely the same pen Molly had bought for him. Sherlock smiled slightly under his breath. Lestrade's case was ordinary and uninteresting. Scotland Yard usually solved such matters without problems in a few days, maybe a week. He realized that the reason for the inspector's presence was much simpler. Greg had a date with Molly tonight and wanted to settle the matter as soon as possible to prepare for the meeting. Sherlock did not intend to interfere in this, he had great hopes for tonight too and he had no intention to waste his time chasing after the killer. Since he was not able to be alone and make a plan for the evening with John, the best way out was to leave the apartment. Thanks to this, he could finally be alone and deal with several matters.
"If only you could see it, John. The whole floor was sticking with some purple dust. All because of his experiments."
He frowned at this sudden burst of enthusiasm. "Yes. But I thought you already knew that. We've known each other for almost two decades."
Mycroft stood motionless by the fireplace, staring at Sherlock through half-closed eyes. The white skin of his face contrasted with the thin line of his mouth, curving into a depressing smile. A smile of regret, joy, and relief at the same time. He was breathing shallowly. He stood straight only because he was leaning on his umbrella. Mycroft didn't need to say anything, but John felt numbness, resignation, and pain emanating from him. The sight of a dejected genius who did his best to save his face but was also happy for his brother's happiness was hard for John to bear. He wasn't surprised, when he had to immediately forget his sentiments and move towards the door, because Mycroft nodded slightly and softly, calmly signaled that he was going to leave them alone.
"Sherlock, I'm leaving. I won't be here for two weeks. Please, don't upset Mrs. Hudson..." John fell silent but did not receive a response from his friend. He dressed his jacket and opened the door. "I hope when I come back you will stop sulking ..."
God, another - guess what I mean - person. Why would everyone in Mycroft's surroundings have to be so mysterious and inaccessible? What was the problem in answering the question honestly, even if the answer was not pleasant? John already knew why Anthea and Mycroft got along so well. They both avoided deeper conversations and did not interfere in their private lives. It was a perfect arrangement that had worked for years and John thought it would last for the next years.
"Really?" Sherlock asked when he managed free his hand from Stoner's firm grip. He was surprised and a little amused. "It's weird, I didn't think he might be able to keep his connection longer than he really needs to. Mycroft usually avoids people he doesn't need anymore."
In the distance, he heard Big Ben's echoing chimes, that let him know that another quarter of an hour of his patrol had passed. A light fog was slowly rising over the cobbled streets. The wind whipped the hanging laundry, and the squeals of rats running between the drains assured him that he was not alone even at this late hour. It comforted him because he was afraid of being alone. Many times he had wake up screaming when he dreamed of his dead comrades lying still on the battlefield, and though he pleaded and cried, he could not bring them back to life. Those times when he was left alone were far more terrifying than the whistle of bullets and the screams of charging enemies.
"I fully agree with you" Mycroft stood up and patted his trousers several times to get rid of the dirt. "A lost phone, self-respect," he pulled a flower from behind his ear, "and lost time. We should go back to the hotel."
He sent a message. The moment he did it, he realized he shouldn't do it. He didn't even know who this person was or what it was about ... But on the other hand, if it was that important, one of Mycroft's bodyguards, or Franco Coletti, would inform them. John shrugged and put the phone down. He wanted to take a shower, so he headed back to the bedroom. When he opened the door, he involuntarily walked to the bed. The sight of Mycroft made him unable to resist. He grabbed his phone and quietly approached the sleeping man.
"If you have any other naive questions, leave them until the afternoon when the meeting is over. And now it's enough of this pointless wasting of time. Please, have some breakfast and come with me."
Mycroft accidentally blew hot air into John's wet mouth. He released his face, straightened, and refrained from clearing his throat at the last moment. He looked at his surprised eyes. He finally raised John's hand and kissed gently his fingers.
"Mycroft, it's almost four in the morning ..." he said, stepping up to his husband with crossed arms. He leaned his back against the window and stared at Mycroft's pale face lightened by the laptop screen. The older man sighed theatrically. John immediately thought of his best friend, who also expressed his annoyance in this way.
Before Sherlock realized that something was wrong, test tubes, glass pipes, and other tools began to shake. The glass vessel looked like it was about to burst under the pressure of boiling liquid. Purple smoke began to come out of the tubes and quickly spread through the kitchen. Sherlock didn't wait. He quickly got up from the chair, left the pipette and everything he had in his hands, and quickly closed the kitchen door. He knew he didn't have much time before everything around him was going to be absorbed by the effect of his failed experiment. He ran to the living room window, but he could already see the purple smoke coming out of the doors and crevices. He started coughing. He narrowed his eyes as he wrestled with the window. The only consolation was that the smoke wasn't poisonous. After a few hard jerks, he managed to open the window. He tilted his head out and tried to catch as much fresh air as possible. Purple smoke poured out into the street, drawing the attention of people who were passing under the flat.
Mycroft bypassed him carefully so as not to accidentally touch or push him. John wondered if it was a gesture consequent of his usual gentleman attitude or if he especially avoided to touch him. Mycroft was very reserved when he had to touch someone. Of course, he didn't hesitate when he had to shake hands with someone. It was, however, a line he did not cross. By the time. In situations where he was alone with him, he sometimes lost control of his actions. John was the last to flatter himself, but he liked the awareness that he was the person who caused such reactions in Mycroft.
What the hell was that? What was this conversation about? John began practically running towards Baker Street. He could feel his heart beating furiously. He rushed forward, passed people watching him, and only stopped at pedestrian crossings to avoid encounters with speeding cars.
Stoner left him alone in an empty restaurant room. The two waiters who were preparing tables for the next day did not look like they were paying attention to their mysterious conversation. Even the bartender, who was standing behind the counter several feet away and cleaning his glasses, avoided him with his eyes. John sat alone in an empty restaurant. It took him a few minutes before he decided to return to the apartment, as soon as he dared to get up from the table. He walked up the stairs with his eyes fixed on the red carpet, and although he saw his movements, he felt as if he was floating above the ground. He was afraid if he looked up he would see Stoner, who was walking the same way back to his apartment on the second floor. John walked with his head bowed until he finally reached the familiar door. With great relief, he pressed the door handle and blended into the darkness of the room. When he closed the door, he leaned against it with his body. He breathed deeply and only after some time he noticed the bright light coming from an open laptop on the other side of the room. He saw Mycroft, who, despite the very late hour, was concentrating on some work. He barely noticed John.
By the time John entered the living room, the water in the bathroom had stopped. He suspected that after the previous day there would be a tense atmosphere between them. However, he knew Mycroft and he was almost certain he would spend the day alone. It didn't bother him. He didn't come to Italy to spend every moment with Mycroft, after all.
He managed to catch some movement from under his half-closed eyes. He tilted his head and saw what he thought was the figure of a detective kneeling next to him. He opened his hazy eyes.
Sherlock shrugged. "Nothing would happen to him if he had to bend down a little," he said casually. He allowed himself for long eye contact with his best friend. Much significant because he didn't hide anything anymore. He didn't hide behind indifference or insensitivity. He wanted John to know that he could show affection. He didn't hide it from him since the arrival in Venice, although he was more desperate there to get his attention and quickly show that he should focus his feelings on him. Now he had time to work on his relationship with John in peace at Baker Street.
They were silent. Mycroft wasn't sure where to focus his eyes, and John didn't know what else to say to break the prolonged silence. Fortunately, they heard quick steps in the corridor. The door opened without knocking. Sherlock entered the apartment. Molly also entered, but more timidly. John looked at his sleepy friend with a hint of amusement. Sherlock's curly hair was even more messy than usual. He had a swollen face and red marks on his cheek left by the pillow. In his narrow eyes, John could not see the sharp look and was extremely grateful for that. He was afraid of how his friend would react if he looked closer and saw evidence of what had happened here a moment ago.
Sherlock looked around and walked to the large window between the walls of the two apartments. He opened the old 10-foot high window without any problems. The hotel staff probably never thought that anyone would try to go outside in this way because Sherlock just had to slightly lift the frame, and the window silently opened. Sherlock leaned outside. A metal balcony separated him from falling from a height. He also noticed bits of ragged cloth left by the cleaner. There were less than two feet to the small terrace belonging to the adjoining apartment. Sherlock put his foot over the railing without hesitation and jumped gracefully onto the neighboring balcony. He turned to John and helped him land safely next to him. He almost froze when he saw Molly following their actions.
He realized he lacked oxygen. It was only now that he took a deep breath and tried to relax his tense muscles. He felt it. Salty-sour smell of sex, which despite the open windows remained in the room. It was as if it had penetrated the walls, the mattress and everything around it. He couldn't control the disgust that appeared on his face. He forced himself to stand at the foot of the bed. He regretted, he had nothing to lean on, because he would have done it with pleasure. This whole situation was beyond his strength. He watched his friend and tried to understand how it happened. He sank into his thoughts and lost his sense of time.
He glanced at her stomach. If he could, he would rather not look at it, but he wanted to finish the task. "It's hard to say, but the angle at which the cut was made and the fact that it was taken from vagina to sternum indicate that this time the killer used his left hand."
The touch was soft but firm. The cool gloves kept him from looking away. Holmes's eyes reached out to the innermost recesses as if trying to read even the smallest thought.
"Sherlock, I swear to God, if you do something like that again, I will do something more than push you out of the room. What I do behind closed doors and with whom should not interest you, even if it concerns someone from your family or some dead man from Molly's dissecting room. " John couldn't control his smile when he mentioned it. Sherlock's imagination also had to work because he chuckled in a low voice. "By the way ... Can you tell me what you are doing here? And this poor Molly ... What are you planning?" John turned his head and looked at his amused friend.
"John. This evening we have a special meeting - the official opening of our congress. We must be present. I would like to explain everything to you slowly, but I really don't have time now" Mycroft said, finally turning to the doctor and putting on his wristwatch. "I need to meet someone urgently".
Aaron knew he couldn't take it anymore. He reached his goal and wanted to disappear in the crowd of tourists, leaving Molly behind. However, he had to seal the deal and his success. After a long silence, he looked on her lips, licked his lower lip and kissed Molly in such a way that she did not doubt that she had made the right decision. He didn't care about the people sitting next to him. It was only satisfaction that mattered ... and a moment of the kiss because even if he disliked her, he must have admitted the kiss gave him pleasure. Like sex. He hoped he would have some fun in the coming days. He was so pleased with the effects of his actions that he came to his senses only when he almost pushed his tongue into her throat. The girl was very embarrassed, but she did not try to stop him. He saw this situation as new to her, and no one had ever shown her feelings in such an open manner in the presence of so many unknown people. After a few minutes of a passionate kiss, Aaron pulled away from her hot face and looked into her dreamy eyes.
"Hope your people didn't touch them this time," the detective put the magnifying glass back in his pocket. "And if they did, it was only with gloves."
"You think the vision of you and John in an intimate moment doesn't make me furious or that I wouldn't feel jealous knowing what you two are doing?" Mycroft's voice was unchanged. Calm and confident.
John wrapped his legs around Mycroft's waist and held his neck with his free arm. He tightened the muscles around the genius's penis and encouraged him to push. Mycroft made the first move. And another one. He pulled out and hit the sensitive spot with the next push. John sighed with pleasure, so Mycroft repeated the move.
Of course. It would be strange if the elder Holmes did not know every step of his brother. John was convinced that he was closely monitored by the government and Mycroft himself too.
Mycroft gritted his teeth. He kept his eye on John for a long moment. "We are doing just that," he murmured with such certainty that his words left no doubt as to his sincerity. He watched John in silence. The doctor analyzed his words, breathing faster and faster.
Sherlock felt John tense his body. Nobody said anything for a long time. The numbers shocked them, and the knowledge that they had to make their decisions so quickly was overwhelming. Sherlock was expecting a hard task, but he didn't think the task would be so difficult, and what's more, that Mycroft would be so desperate to let him and John join the group. He liked adrenaline and liked to provide it to John because he knew he was addicted to it. He hoped, however, that the worst and most dangerous cases were either behind them or he had time to prepare for them. He hoped that he would be able to use the following months to get closer to John. He did not want to delay his plan and resolutions, especially since the task they were facing was so dangerous. Sherlock didn't know how he would survive the next few months if John decided to participate in the mission. He heard a slightly hoarse voice of a friend who once again broke the silence in the room.
Stoner finally looked at glass doors in the main hall then at his expensive watch. "I think I should go. We start an important meeting in half an hour. The city is busy so it will be a miracle if I can get to the other end of the city in time. It was nice to meet you, Sherlock. I hope we will have the opportunity to talk longer in the next days ... "he said, bowing slightly towards genius, and then focused all his attention on pale John.
It took a while, but after a long silence, Mycroft changed his attitude. "I'm sorry," he said finally. He relaxed his arms, and the sight made John breathe a sigh of relief. "I am a bit ... lost."
The screen on the phone flashed in a dark room, waking John from a heavy sleep. It was late at night. John was barely awake and still sleepy. He raised his head and reached over to the phone, vibrated on the cabinet next to the bed. It took a long time for his eyes to get used to the bright light. It took him some time to read a message he got from his friend. He smiled and when he was thinking about the answer, he got another message. And another one.
Mycroft looked at him with gentleness and kindness in his eyes for the first time. "No, John. I've always found you a good-hearted man with a slightly too idealized attitude towards life".
"No... there is no way you two..." he said incredulously. As if he could not believe that Mycroft could go so far as to ...
"Ah! Shit!" John closed his eyes but was trembling at hearing Sherlock's moans of pleasure. It took a while before he was able to slip out of him. He sighed as he looked at his friend.
The man finally reached him. He was flushed. His eyes gleamed with the effort, and sweat ran down his forehead. "Watson! What are you doing here?" he asked, wiping his wet face. He put a hand on the rim of the cab, gasping heavily. "You can't even imagine the relief I feel after seeing you."
Sherlock went to the window. "Something that surely has to do with my brother," he said. He nodded gently to let John and Molly join him. "But we have to ask him if we want to know the details." John turned off the lamp, went to the balcony and slowly followed his friend in silence. They were coming back the same way, jumping from balcony to balcony in the dark.
"Of course I know that, John. I wanted to practice what you needed to know right after we arrived, but you saw that there was no time for it... Today is too late already and you are tired. We will leave it for the morning. Tomorrow's banquet does not start until late in the evening".
Sherlock stared at him completely overwhelmed with desire. He could barely keep his eyes open. His hair was in a total mess, and beads of sweat ran down his temples, decorating his red face. He was breathing deeply and gasping, trying to control his body. At one point, he reached into the bedside cabinet with a trembling hand and took a small plastic bottle from a drawer. He handed it to John without hesitation.
"Come on. Decide. Will you choose, the reason ..." he pushed the CD slightly towards him "... or the heart?" did the same with the phone.
"Exactly," John nodded. "He would know right away what happened at night. I know it's ridiculous, in the end, he gave me the keys to your house. He suggested that I do what I have to do as soon as possible and that we end this strange situation. He said that otherwise, we both go crazy, and it makes no sense to delay the inevitable. But I'm afraid that nothing will be the same anyway. "
"But okay. I will do this show for you, but if something goes wrong, blame only yourself ...". With these words, John grasped Mycroft's arm with a rough movement and pinned it on the pillow above his head. Mycroft was too confused to react when John attacked him with his lips. He firmly found the way inside the genius's mouth and began to dominate him with a kiss.
He looked around again. His attention was caught by a book on the ground, hidden under the bed. "I didn't think he reads Hopkins," he muttered under his breath. However, Sherlock, apparently sensitive to his voice, suddenly stopped moving. He rose from the ground and turned to him with relief and pride on his face.
Mycroft watched him and didn't know how to react. John did what he wanted again and there was no way to stop him. Genius saw him approach Mr. Coletti. He bowed low and exchanged a few words with the man. A wide smile appeared on Francesca's face. A second later she went with John to the center of the room. Mycroft didn't know why, but his heart was pounding. He did not want John's behavior to be badly received, and at the same time, he felt calm, looking at his pose and behavior. Everything looked good.
John was so surprised that he parted his lips slightly and then Mycroft decided to act. He grasped John's face with his hand, moved his body in front of him, almost pressing his body against the balustrade, and stuck his tongue inside John's mouth. John shivered and groaned. He did not expect such behavior and did not know what to do. For a bit of control, he grabbed the other man's forearms and clenched his fingers tightly.
"I booked an apartment for this name," he murmured in a deep voice, still glancing toward the stairs. He tried to look at all the doors alongside the hall, but he did not notice any clue that would facilitate his task.
After some time, he couldn't help smiling. Sherlock must have had a hard day or he suffered from boredom because the phone kept vibrating. John finally picked it up to check how many messages he got. Fifteen... He shook his head in amusement and then he suddenly noticed the light from the other room. The light entered the bedroom through a crack in the door.
"And you," John finally gathered the strength to answer, "are still the same son of a bitch. Exactly how I remembered you."
When smiling John turned his head, he saw the silhouette of Mycroft, who was standing in the passage of the other room. He stood calm, which must mean something was wrong. John walked away from the window and approached Mycroft slowly. His husband's face was thoughtful and his eyes narrowed. John tried to figure out what was wrong, but he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Sherlock would surely point out at that moment that he could see but not observe.
He walked on, looking from side to side. He listened to his own steps, the noise of his cane, and the metallic sound of a police whistle tapping rhythmically on the buttons on his coat. He was well prepared to face the danger, but for his own safety, he decided to take something else from his room as well. The weight of the revolver in his pocket was satisfactory. Revolver hit his thigh as if reminding him of its presence with every step. Oh, yes. Walking alone through the dark alleys seemed much safer with his old friend in his pocket.
John raised a corner of his mouth. "I didn't get lost in the Afghan desert or the mountains. Why should it be different this time?"
"Prostitutes know a lot of places where they may take their clients to," Lestrade walked forward with a firm step. "Fortunately for them, people living in those houses rarely lock their doors, which means ..." he fell silent, standing right on the threshold.
"I used too much iodine," Sherlock wanted to justify his action somehow, but it wasn't necessary. John didn't look angry or annoyed, or moreover - interested.
John was very close to the flat now. He heard his own tired breathing. He could feel the sweat trickling down his body. Sweat caused not only by sprinting half the way from the store, but also by what he had heard so far. Right now, there was an extended silence on the other side of the phone. It took a few moments for him to recognize Mycroft's voice.
"Virus? By text? For God's sake, now I'll think twice before reading a message from you or some unknown numbers." He ignored Mycroft's gaze. "And by the way, tell me ..." he said and lowered his voice, leaning slightly toward him. "What decision would you make if Anthea ..."
However, Sherlock wasn't laughing. He knew his brother too well and knew he wasn't kidding. Mycroft didn't have a sense of humor, he adored sarcasm and treated people with superiority, although they did not know it. He stared at his brother, slowly putting down the newspaper. He heard his friend calm down a bit. John smiled and wiped tears from the corners of his eyes. He was sitting with his back to Mycroft, so that's why he probably didn't know that ginger genius never took his eyes off him.
John couldn't help imagining Mycroft like this. He smiled honestly. He couldn't disagree with him, but he would give a lot to see him like that. He walked slowly toward him, and Mycroft reacted with a slight frown. "You're right. I can't imagine. But I bet we would find a solution," he said cheerfully. He was close to Mycroft. When he reached out he felt the soft fabric of the shirt on his forearm under his fingers. Mycroft jerked slightly but did not pull away. He closely watched the movements of the doctor, who ran his hands higher and higher. John's fingers slipped between his shirt and the vest, which he eventually decided to take off quickly. Mycroft was silent and watched what else John decided to do to help him look like ordinary people. He wouldn't admit it, but he liked to look at him, and he was extremely happy to be in the center of John's attention. He shuddered when the vest disappeared from his back. He felt chills now as the doctor undid his cuffs and wrapped his shirt sleeves up to his elbows with slow and careful movements.
"Sherlock!" growled John. He forced his friend to look at him. "Say it's a beautiful pen." His tone was so quiet and imperative that the genius had no choice. He turned to Molly with a forced smile and looked at the open box she was holding.
"I can't hear you talking," Sherlock's voice came from the balcony next to their bedroom. "I'll call mom".
They both fastened their seat belts and after a while plane was a few miles above the city. The view from the window was breathtaking. London looked amazing at night. John glanced at Mycroft, who was organizing his things. He unfolded a small table and took out a laptop. A moment later a young woman came from the back of the plane, and after pouring drinks, she disappeared as soon as she appeared. John and Mycroft were alone again.
He felt that death was coming. He could almost see the grim reaper looking at him from the darkest corner of the alley. His only hope at the moment was the noise of his falling lantern. It didn't shatter. What's more, the light illuminated the face of the lying woman and the blood-splattered wall. Even though it all happened so suddenly that he didn't notice any sounds because of the shock, someone in the area must have heard some noise. He hoped one of the patrolling policemen would be here soon.
"When you learn to hide them properly," he muttered cheerfully with his nose stuck in the menu card.
"It's your doing, right?" John asked, nodding in an unspecified direction. He already managed to steal a kiss from a genius who didn't mind.
"I just told you why," Mycroft said and looked at him. He sighed and returned to his previous position. "It's not easy to admit, but I'm afraid of what he's planning. I don't really know how he wants to get me, but I know he'll do it in a way that hurts me the most."
Sherlock's name caught John's attention. He finally turned to the older man. Mycroft was stretched out on the bed, with eyes covered with his shoulder.
"No, brother. Could you leave us alone?" he asked in a softer voice. "I promise I won't do anything inappropriate anymore," he added as if he were sure that only such assurance would calm his brother.
The inappropriate joy and excitement because of the investigation gave way to the disappointment he felt at the thought that his assistance in the case might end here. He wanted to help solve the case, he wanted to catch the killer. However, his greatest desire was to get to know Holmes better. With each passing hour, his admiration for the eccentric detective grew. He was about to ask if he could be of any use to him and if they could continue the relationship, but Holmes must have known about his wishes, so he spoke first.
"Remember, Mycroft, sometimes this pawn may be the only salvation for the King because it's true it is insignificant, but when it reaches the end of the chessboard, it can turn into a queen. And she has more options than the king and all other figures put together".
Sherlock treated him like his guide. He was waiting for his decision where they would go. John started looking around and then saw someone standing on the balcony where he had been a few minutes earlier. He only saw the figure of the person and the glowing tip of the cigarette, but he knew it was Mycroft. He had to figure out what they were going to do, so he went out onto the terrace. John didn't understand why, but he felt sad when he saw lonely Mycroft who was watching them from above.
"But who is angry, John?" Sherlock asked, as if nothing had happened, and raised his eyebrows questioningly for greater effect.
"You're not going anywhere," John said without moving. He looked at them with their arms crossed as he stood in the center of the living room. With his words and his firmness, he surprised Mycroft, who stopped moving and fixed his eyes on him. John sighed. "Since returning from Venice, you have been letting me know that you are waiting for my decision. I realized it not long ago. But how can you do this?" he asked with anger, and in an instant, he realized he had made a mistake by thinking of it that way. It wasn't their fault. They gave him free will and waited for his decisions. They were aware that they would have to submit to the decision he would make. The thought flashed through his mind that perhaps he was making a mistake. "How could I ever let that happen?" He rubbed his eyes, tired of the whole situation. He heard a small sigh belonging to Mycroft. He heard only him. Sherlock was silent and tried not to draw attention to himself. It was as if he was afraid to remind them that he was there too.
John still felt chills and unpleasant pain in his stomach. When the door closed behind Aaron and Mycroft, he knew he had to do something. He couldn't leave him after what he saw. He was sure that Stoner was up to something and finally decided to take the lead. He had to help Mycroft, although he didn't know how. He looked at Molly, who was still looking at him apologetically.
Mycroft tried to maintain eye contact, he really tried. But the words of his brother were like a knife in the heart. He was even afraid to think about what feelings prevailed in Sherlock's heart. How could he answer his questions? Sherlock was the only person in his life so important to him. He loved him with all his heart. He promised he would be the only person he would care for. And now he hurt him in such a primitive and surprising way for both of them ...
"Take that hand away," he said in a voice full of bitterness and anger. But he spoke quietly and calmly. He looked pointedly at his brother's forearm, possessively wrapped around John's chest.
Mycroft's words made Sherlock open his eyes. He looked at his brother with a raised eyebrow. "Oh?" he said with interest. "And who is it, if I can ask?"
The doctor nodded as a sign that he understood, although he was not entirely convinced that it was indeed their dinner. However, he did not doubt that the price represented by several slices on the plate had to be humongous. He looked at Mycroft. "And this ..." he said and pointed to the white irregular thing with the tip of his knife, "is food too?"
He let Mycroft direct him. Genius gently wandered around John's mouth, teeth. He rubbed his tongue with John's. He sucked his lips and swallowed every sigh. The kiss grew stronger. The older man seemed to want to devour John, drain every bit of him. Blowing the air in the blonde's mouth, he made the shorter man shiver.
"Sherlock was right, am I wrong? Aaron Stoner is the one who you compete with and who doesn't believe in our fairy tale... That's why you didn't want me to leave our apartment. You were afraid that I might meet him by accident and our secret would come out to light ".
"Aaron will come to visit us, John. But this visit will not take him long." Mycroft ignored him and turned to the doctor. He closed the laptop, put it on the table, then returned to the previous position.
John sat down resigned on the spring mattress of the big bed. He watched Sherlock for a moment, who tirelessly searched low furniture on his knees, he also saw Molly rummaging in Stoner's bag. Throughout his stay in the apartment, John managed to notice and deduce a few things about him. Of course, he didn't say it out loud. These were his thoughts. He learned that Aaron's favorite color was green. This was demonstrated by the selection of clothes, handkerchiefs, ties, towels and even a toothbrush. Gucci was a favorite brand. Everything seemed to indicate that he preferred sleeping naked. At last, John also knew the reason why Stoner's skin had always seemed so smooth and flawless to him. On the shelf in the bathroom, on the table in the bedroom and wherever possible, there were bottles with expensive lotions and creams. However, the biggest discovery for him was that Stoner, although perfect on the outside, was a terrible slob.
He noticed how his friend's gaze softened, how his breathing quickened, and he tried with all his might to control the flow of words that were surely popping up in his head.
My dear, guys. I will be out of town for the next few days so the next chapter will not be uploaded until March 17.
"She did. Francesca said I should have my first gondola trip with you. She said it was a unique experience and she would not take this pleasure away from us ..." John added with a smile, looking away. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Mycroft's surprise, replaced immediately by some kind of contentment.
They rode in silence, absorbed in their thoughts. Pleasant chill air carried the smell of damp wood with it as the carriage passed the Thames. Looking bitterly at the bright sky, he noticed that nature did indeed follow its own rules. The sun seemed to mock Londoners' everyday problems. It glowed harshly in the cloudless sky. Birds sang merrily between the colourful leaves of the trees.
"John Watson is really unique. No wonder you paid special attention to him," he said. Mycroft did not want to be provoked. He watched John. He returned to Francesca after speaking with the orchestra. The first sounds of the waltz echoed in the hall.
"... Don't drink alcohol until the last drop, just ask for another glass. Don't talk about yourself unless you are asked to do it. And most importantly..." Mycroft stopped halfway. He looked John in the eyes and lowered his voice. "... avoid Stoner as much as you can and stay close to me."
John remembered the moment when Stoner gently released his hand and almost silently pushed the chair away, then walked around the table and leaned over him. John's body froze at that time, he couldn't move, and the only thing he remembered was Aaron's smile and his lips. He kissed him on the cheek. It was a kiss of triumph. A kiss proving total control of the situation. It was at that moment that John's aversion to Stoner evolved into pure hatred and disgust. It was the second person in John's life, he hated this much.
He had mixed feelings because the room he 'borrowed' the keys to, was right next to his apartment. The two apartments were divided by a wall, solid and soundproofed, but only a wall. How could he endure these few days knowing that the reason for his arrival was so close and at the same time he couldn't personally control what was happening to him? These doubts intensified when he finally stood in front of the double door. He put the key in the lock and silently got inside.
John never took his eyes from him. Even when Mycroft took two steps back and joined Franco. They go deeper into the hall when the older man turned his head. Their eyes met again before Mycroft disappeared behind the marble wall.
Mycroft and John looked at her immediately. The genius sighed, and the doctor visibly tried to hide his embarrassment, once again covering his eyes with his hand.
"Almost". The doctor leaned over the table, pulled a flower from a small glass vase and broke it in half. Later, he wiped the stalk of the rest of the water and put a flower behind Mycroft's ear. His gesture made Sherlock laugh softly. "You are one of us now." He was happy when Mycroft smiled back. Maybe it was a bit of a forced smile, but what mattered was that he wasn't angry or grumpy. They were all in a good mood. The brothers did not argue or annoy each other with unpleasant comments. They teased each other, yes, but their little rivalry made them feel better. The wine was buzzing in their heads, which gave them the impression that they could afford more. The passing motorboats drowned out the playing orchestra and conversations from the neighboring tables, but that did not stop them from enjoying their last night in Venice.
"Of course it will work!" Mrs. Holmes had no doubt. "No matter who does it, I am sure of one thing. I am sure that at the end of the year, on Christmas Eve, I will have to prepare one bed less. It is not important for me with which of my sons John will share it."
"You know ... I'm not convinced of this idea. Sherlock and John are my friends ... I couldn't ... I don't know if ... if I did it, I would betray their trust ..." she said quietly as if she was afraid of his reaction.
Sebastian sat down on the ground. He stared at John and also tried to control his breathing. "You taste exactly as I remember," he said after a long silence. He put his hands on bent and widely spread legs.
Aaron leaned slightly over the table. "Mycroft, you know I don't mean to destroy you. After all, we both want peace and a world without wars, except for the wars we can control. We are on the side of the good ones," he said and made a move with his fingers. "I don't want to fight with you, just have some fun." At this point, he pointed with his finger at the CD in the blue wrapper. "If I publish the data from this CD, the whole environment will find that you make mistakes too. Funny and incomprehensible mistakes they will point out to you for years. You will have to admit to them, and it will hit your pride, and I will be extremely happy."
The fragility with which Sherlock's voice sounded in the room drew all of John's attention. He felt a sudden unpleasant dimple in his stomach, realizing that he had never heard or seen his friend as vulnerable and fragile as he was right now. As if he was preparing for the coming blow. Disgusted? A similar feeling never entered his mind when he thought of Sherlock or Mycroft.
"I hope at least ..." Mycroft continued, closely observing Sherlock, "that you spent this time in a more useful way than causing more fights in nearby pubs and restaurants," he added with his typical smile. He looked like he was in a good mood. He was looking at his brother from above the laptop.
John calmed down after seeing that. "You're giving up?" he asked slyly, trying to hide the rest of his fears in his voice. He bit his lip as Sherlock gritted his teeth against his neck.
His brother sighed nervously but seemed to have reconciled with the situation because he focused only on John. "John ..." he began and hesitated for a second. He cleared his throat again and straightened proudly. " John, I would like you to consider the proposal of becoming my husband".
His eyes widened slightly. This day surprised him more and more. But he felt irritated because, as usual, the others seemed to be better informed than he was. He gritted his teeth as he waited for the stranger's next words. After a long silence, he finally approached the carriage, resting his hand on the carved elements of the door.
"She will use it for hunting," Sebastian said, muttering under his breath. "We can't afford to waste ammo, but we have to eat."
"I'll take care of it, John ..." he said, checking the bill and reaching into his pocket for his wallet. When he pulled it out, he didn't notice the small plastic wrap that got tangled between his fingers and landed on the ground, right next to John's feet.
The afternoon was beautiful. The four of them walked around the city and admired Venice's architecture. They spent several hours between the narrow streets of the city and saw crowded places, besieged by tourists. They ate dinner in one of the inexpensive, but elegant restaurants in the middle of the city.
John nodded in understanding. He didn't know what Mycroft meant, but he didn't want to ask. When he was about to wish him good luck and leave him alone, he felt Mycroft's gaze on him.
Sherlock said nothing. He did not grace his brother with either a look or an answer, which was proof that Mycroft's words reached his curly head.
He was able to say something only after a long moment. "How long has Mycroft used me as his excuse?" he asked and blinked quickly.
The question that formed in his mind did not have time to leave his mouth because they stopped in front of the same door. He watched as Holmes pulled the handle and entered the office first. The breath of air carried the suffocating scent of dust and old wood with it. The sour, metallic flavour dominated the taste buds in the next few seconds. At first, he only saw Holmes' smile, who motioned him inside. Then he noticed rows of glazed showcases and piles of old books lying on tables. The displays were piled up against every wall, in every corner, and at every height, presenting a sizable collection of blades.
John noticed this not for the first time and once again realized how much he had learned about him in just two weeks. "Earlier you pointed out to me that I leave the apartment when I avoid confrontation but now you do exactly the same thing," he continued, squinting at the increasingly distinct change in the genius's face. "Don't think I don't know what's on your mind and what you're going to...".
"I'm going back to the hotel ... And you should join the others. It's your duty after all," he murmured. But the man did not give up. He finally had his chance and did not intend to waste it. He grabbed John by the elbow and pulled him with a smile in the opposite direction.
John replied with a smile. He knew what he looked like. He had been living in a trance for several days. He rarely ate, slept little, and thought a lot. At the same time, he tried to avoid long conversations with Sherlock. Greg's words about catching his happiness and using it as long as he had the chance still rang in his head. He was frustrated by the thought of how much time he had wasted without seeing clear clues. Now he realized Sherlock's feelings and how much he had done for his sake while renouncing his own. And Mycroft? This short, intense romance happened so quickly and unexpectedly that John didn't quite understand how it happened. One day they were almost strangers to each other, and the next they wanted each other's kisses. It was too sudden and weird to just get over it. What was he supposed to do? Pretend that nothing happened? Or that he still didn't understand and didn't see Sherlock's feelings? No. Both brothers obviously expected a decision from him. It was hard, but if he was going to listen to Greg's words to catch his happiness and not regret it for the rest of his life, he had to do it.
John had seen angry Mycroft several times, but this time the atmosphere was overwhelming him. He hesitantly entered the darkroom and closed the elegant and heavy door behind him. He watched the genius. Mycroft emptied the glass in a few sips, then put it back in its place and rested his hands on the chair, leaning forward. The silence was terrifying. John could hear his heart beating and the sound of his footsteps when he decided to approach Mycroft. He crossed his arms and stopped just behind the other man.
"Thanks to you, I don't have as much time as Miss Adler ..." the younger genius murmured in an almost dark tone. He didn't look at his brother. He blew smoke through his nose. "... Anyway, John is naive and easier to manipulate than me."
John wanted to accentuate his anger, so he set the glass loudly on the table without taking his eyes off Aaron. His grin made John feel blood running down his cheeks. The last person he wanted to talk about was Sherlock. John calmed down after a moment, took a deep breath and leaned his back against the chair.
"I know, it's difficult for us to communicate. I also know, it's ... exhausting and it's not easy for you to accept me. I shouldn't say that, now that the trip is coming to an end, but I owe you this. I am sorry, I was so harsh and put so much pressure on you. I should trust you and rely on you more. You have helped me in many situations. "
John could hear the conversations echoing through the trees more clearly with each step. The other members of the group had already set up a camp and even started a fire, which was quite mediocre. The branches in this part of the forest were still too moist to serve as fuel. John approached them with some concern. He could feel the pulsing under the sensitive skin of his mouth. He was convinced that his lips were swollen and red. He was afraid of the reactions of the others, especially the reaction of Sherlock, who focused his eyes on him and did not leave him, even when John sat next to him on the fallen limb.
Holmes did not give up. Smiling, he pressed his body tighter, and he hugged his waist with his free hand.
John was surprised that his conversation with Mycroft went so smoothly. They talked without teasing each other or making harsh comments. He believed everything was going back to normal. Talking with him did not look like he thought it would, but he was glad it wasn't deep and long conversation again and they manage to avoid pointing out their mistakes. He closed his eyes and fell asleep with his head on a soft pillow, surrounded by a gentle touch of bedding and Mycroft's scent. But his sleep was not restful. He turned from side to side. He turned the pillow over to the cold side. He was throwing bedding off the bed but later wrapped himself in it. The night passed very quickly. He felt more tired in the morning than when he went to bed. When he woke up he found an empty bed, but he had already got used to it. He didn't have to waste his time at meetings or banquets, so he decided to spend it lazing around. The last two days have been exhausting for him and he was starting to feel pain in his legs. He didn't care about the time of day, but he looked sideways at the open window and knew it was still early in the morning. He knew he would not sleep again, so he got out of bed and took a quick, refreshing shower. He left the bedroom and saw the breakfast on the table that Mycroft had ordered for him. He smiled. Mycroft behaved like a gentleman as usual and despite all, he did not forget about such trivial needs. John had to admit, Mycroft had many disadvantages - like everyone else - but he couldn't say, the genius didn't care about the people who were under his care.
"Then why Mycroft still pretends and lets Stoner play with him? Why didn't he admit he made up this marriage story?"
He didn't wait for an answer. He slammed the door a little harder than needed and took a deep breath. He stood still for a moment, then went to the open balcony door on the other side of the room. He was used to these calm nights at the main canal in beautiful Venice, but he appreciated the special charm of the dark room and the view of the undisturbed water only now. And although he did not go out on the balcony, he could imagine people walking outside the hotel, musicians who composed sad ballads under the restaurants. He didn't have to open his eyes to bring back all those memories. He was standing in front of the open balcony door. He felt a gentle brushing of light curtains on his shoulders. The curtains waved with the wind. He took a deep breath and felt the familiar smell. He immediately opened his eyes. It was the bland and bitter smell of cigarettes. He knew it too well.
No. He didn't want to go back to those memories. It was too painful. He had been standing still too long and let Sebastian watch his reactions. John wanted to use every moment when they were still separated by the strong hands of security guards and several floors of the secret building in which they lived. He took off his earmuffs. He put down his gun and moved empty magazines that cluttered the ground with his foot. He didn't look up as he walked toward the door, though he felt Moran and Sherlock's gaze on him. He sucked a breath as he approached Sebastian. Each step was getting harder and harder. With every breath, he knew he was approaching his nightmare. He wasn't too surprised when he had to stop, feeling familiar, and a strong grip on his shoulder. Moran grabbed him firmly and tight. Like a vise gripping a bar. There was no point in trying to break free. Sebastian was unaware of the strength and force with which his fingers tightened on the doctor's shoulder. John was fighting with himself. He didn't want to show the pain he felt. He remembered those fingers and their power. There was no point in breaking his grip now. He looked straight into the bright eyes of Sebastian, who towered over him and dangerously brought his face toward him. The guards shuddered but froze, casting questioning and expectant glances in Mycroft's direction. Both Holmes brothers ended their discussion and watched the scene from behind the armored glass.
John had no intention of being alone with him all the more in the middle of the canal, so he took the files from his hand and walked towards the crowded street. "No, thank you. I already know the city and I can handle it myself. Don't worry about me" with these words he started to squeeze through the crowd of tourists. He was sure Mycroft had chosen the water transport to get to the meeting point. His husband sometimes behaved as if he was allergic to people and their stupidity. John almost moaned irritably when Aaron appeared at his side and grabbed his elbow.
Mycroft didn't answer. He saw real relief on John's face and was glad to be able to contribute to his good relationship with Sherlock. He doubted that his brother was willing to treat him the same, but time was the best doctor. They were patient, so he believed that one day he would be able to come to the crime scene and talk to John without the murderous look of his brother. He took the doctor's hand, wanting to feel his warmth for a while. "Ever since we got back to England, I've been getting messages and requests from our mutual friends. They want me to take you to the next congress." He looked into his eyes. "Would you like to accompany me?" he asked.
The size of the collection did not give a chance to see all its content in such a short time. He doubted that a whole day would suffice for the task, but he did as he was ordered. He approached the first exhibition. The knives were lying behind the glass, the corners of which were yellowed with age. Some bent, straight, or chipped. Most of the knives showed signs of use, but there were some whose blades still glistened with reflected sunlight. He could easily imagine that Jack the Ripper kept a similar knife at home and used it daily. For example, to open letters, or scrape dried mud from the soles of his shoes.
He turned his head and looked at the living room. Like the night before Mycroft slept on the couch, and just as before, all the evidence for it had disappeared. John started to seriously consider his husband's habits. Was he sleeping or maybe he was sitting all night working on a laptop? Was he in the room or did he meet with someone? Mycroft was one big secret.
John wanted to ask, but he bit his teeth and didn't do it. He turned and focused on the elegant tableware in front of him. He wasn't going to be the third wheel, and he wasn't going to impose his presence if Sherlock and Molly had plans. It would hurt his pride. Whether it was Sherlock's idea or not, he wasn't going to play his games and he wasn't going to wait until he would act like the Sherlock he knew again.
They were silent. They felt the warmth of their bodies because although they were a little above their feet, they felt that they were burning with fever. It was enough for one of them to reach out to touch each other. They didn't do it. There was no such need. John had made his decision, and Mycroft pretended that there was no other possibility, and the path the doctor chose was the only and most obvious one. They avoided their eyes until the silence became unbearable.
He was smiling every time Sherlock gave a soft deduction about a couple or a group of people. He wondered how it was possible, Sherlock's deductions did not bore him. They finally left the main pedestrian street and entered one of the narrow streets. They were overwhelmed by darkness. The only light came from the shining stars in the sky, which they could see only when they were raising their heads. The high walls of buildings surrounded them. The narrow streets formed claustrophobic mazes and only a resident or someone with perfect orientation had no problem getting to their destination without walking around the same district. It was true, John had walked in this area many times, but the overwhelming darkness made his task much more difficult.
"Yes, Sherlock, because imagine, it is not such a great price, for the health and lives of dozens of people," John said calmly. This made his friend stand up without a word and with a proud and sophisticated attitude went towards his room.
"My only regret is that he is so stubborn and inaccessible in doing this," she rubbed her face, awkwardly hiding her breaking voice. "He only comes here when he needs something," her eyes instantly widened and her face lost its flush. "I mean ... I don't ...".
He saw John was analyzing his words and wondered if he should find an excuse. John was tired and weak, it was difficult for him to think after so many sleepless hours and the effort he put into wandering around the city. Mycroft saw this all, he easily read John's thoughts, intentions, and emotions. He would be able to answer his questions before he asked them. He could say something that would change John's thoughts in such a way that he wouldn't even know it. He would be able to do all this if it wasn't for the damn drop. A small, single drop of water that was so slowly flowing down John's neck and collarbone, drawing all Mycroft's attention. He couldn't take his eyes off it, because John's tanned skin looked so soft and hot, even though he was standing under freezing water a moment ago. A droplet of water flowed down, leaving a wet trail and hid under an unbuttoned shirt. Mycroft came to his senses and looked up, focusing again on John's face.
John was still watching his lips, but Sherlock didn't seem to realize it. He was too busy with deductions. John wondered what had happened and why it was only now that he became interested in this part of his friend's body. Is it because of this 'almost kiss'? It was true he was not disgusted by the idea that Sherlock wanted to kiss him. He was surprised and stunned by his behavior at that time. He fled because he was afraid of consistency and Sherlock's motives. But the idea of a kiss was pleasant and exciting. John shook off his thoughts. Did he really want to kiss Sherlock, or was it just a whim?
John's sleepy voice caught his attention. He smiled under his breath and put the phone on his stomach. "Jealousy doesn't suit you, John," he muttered merrily, leaning over and kissing his forehead. "What suits you is sarcasm. Come on, say something sarcastic, I know you feel like doing it." He said with a smirk and hesitantly returned to talking with his assistant. He felt strange, having to assure her that delaying the morning meetings would not be necessary and that he could easily prepare all necessary documents. He had an excellent mood, which probably could be felt because the answers he received from her were saturated with subdued anxiety and not professional indifference.
If it were possible, the detective would see the back of his head at that moment. He sighed. "Not a word, Watson." With a soft, almost guttural chuckle, he walked down the hall to the back of the flat and disappeared through the door, leaving them ajar.
"Maybe this". He leaned forward. A hot breath surrounded the doctor's face. Their eyes met for a few seconds. Something sparkled in the air, it got stuffy. Sherlock's delicate lips brushed John's hot skin, leaving a kiss on his right cheek.
John didn't see Mycroft for the rest of the day. For a moment he even wondered if the man was acting like that because of their kiss in the morning. Mycroft was a distant man, but pretending to be married had some influence on him. John had proof that even a simple kiss affected him. Blushes, trembling lips, and hazy eyes were proofs of Mycroft's normality.
"Do you know that some people's skin reacts differently to precious metals? Most people wear jewelry and their skin gets used to it almost immediately, but there is a group of people whose skin on the fingers is more sensitive and needs more time to adapt to a new thing. Their skin under the ring gets softer. It peels off or wrinkles, especially when the ring is new and the skin is not accustomed to pressure. "
After passing a dozen people dealing with the smooth operation of the hotel and reception, John stood in front of the glass door. When the door was opened, he almost covered his eyes. He did not expect that he would ever be able to be on this kind of important and elegant event. He was standing by Mycroft's side in the banquet hall. He had to raise his head high up to see the ceiling and strain his eyes to see the pairs on the other side of the room. Tables with food and alcohol stood near the walls. John could hear conversations and quiet music coming from the center of the room.
The deceased's brown curls were still clotted together with blood. There were small scratches and bruises on the pale freckled
"Don't worry about him today," Mrs. Hudson muttered, standing next to John's chair. She handed Greg a cup of tea, although he politely declined it earlier. He took it in surprise. He hoped for Sherlock's help, so he was surprised by this sudden refusal. He knew about the genius's moods, but after what he heard from Molly, he thought Sherlock would be in a better mood. "He's angry because John left him alone in the flat and went to talk to his brother," she added, making Sherlock wincing.
"Sherlock sleeps off last night." Before she finished, she brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. "He is preparing for the evening because he wants to take a walk around the city with you."
On his way to shopping, he stopped many times in front of shop windows. He looked at them attentively, trying to chase away the sad thoughts. He was walking down the main streets, looking for a familiar black car that was nowhere to be found. He felt disappointed and was angry at himself. He fought the urge to run to Baker Street and tell Sherlock that he had too much affection for him and would not be able to go back to being just friends. He wanted to call Mycroft and ask him to send the car while admitting his mistake. His fingers tightened on the phone, forcing himself to persevere in his decision. He broke both brothers' hearts, so he was no right to ask for their forgiveness. What's more, he loved them both, and he knew it was wrong. The only option was to accept the situation and try as hard as possible not to let his relationship with geniuses deteriorate. However, he was aware that he had hurt them and that if the situation did not improve, he would have to make more efforts to save what was left. He wondered if he could bear the thought of moving out, and what he would do if he lost touch with his best friend and with Mycroft.
It was obvious. She was not known for her courage and confidence. John knew she had a weakness for dominant men and was too gullible. A few compliments and sweet gestures were enough, and her sensitive heart was beating faster. Although it really belonged to Sherlock for a long time. John felt sorry for her and sometimes regretted that she was so naive. He leaned to her and lowered his voice.
Sherlock kept his eyes on his friend. "The cat, that Molly will probably choke in any moment, had an owner before, but the woman who looks after him now ..."
"I'm leaving," she continued, seeming not to pay attention to what he was saying. "There's a hat sale going on on Strand Street today," she added with a smile and excitement in her voice.
"to not give you a reason to be ashamed? Our marriage lasts less than ten minutes, and we have already argued ..."
"Let's go home. We will be able to do whatever we want there", seeing the indecision in the detective's eyes, he grabbed his lower lip between his in a few seconds' kiss. "I will do whatever you suggest."
John never once looked at Mycroft but he felt his gaze. He knew he should not talk to him about this or lament about such trivial problems. He must have looked like a rejected girl who complains about her boyfriend in Mycroft's eyes. He did not know why he had such associations. He dared to look up after a few moments.
"But looking at this hotel, I am not sure if you had to relieve your frustration on the internet so much. Now, no one who is sane will came here on ..." Sherlock did not finish. He saw from the corner of his eye as the restaurant owner approaches John and leans back with his fist ready to strike.
"I'm injured, not old," he admonished him, but he didn't feel a bit offended, but amused at his own clumsiness.
When he was halfway down the corridor he looked up. He had bright eyes that gave Sherlock a slight shiver. The man had a piercing, gray look. Dangerous, indifferent, and cold. When he noticed them, he slowed down. At one point he stopped, causing the other two men to fall right into his back. His face changed in a split second. He froze, opened his mouth slightly. He didn't blink. Sherlock could see his breathing getting faster. He did not know how long they stood silently more than twenty feet apart, nor did he know what could cause such a surprise. Sherlock almost jumped when he saw his sudden movement. The man moved forward without a word, but two bodyguards grabbed him by the shoulders. They had to use all their strength to stop him in place. Unlike Sherlock, they didn't look surprised or even interested.
Mycroft walked slowly toward him. He put one hand in his trouser pocket and the other hand rubbed his neck. "Of course not. Although it seemed unavoidable." It was really quiet in the apartment. For some reason, they didn't even hear the noise from outside the hotel. The only thing they heard was the rustling of Mycroft's clothes that entered the bedroom. "I thought you were going to be angry," he added, standing right in front of John. He was visibly tired. John could smell the expensive perfumes, whiskey and cigarette smoke on his clothes.
Molly stood behind Sherlock, wiping the rest of the sweet croissant with her fingers that she ate for breakfast. "He didn't want to look desperate," she said softly.
The genius watched him for a long moment, his mouth slightly open, remembering everything he could see. Every birthmark, hair, and scar. He took a step forward, wrapped his arms around him, and began to leave gentle kisses along his neck, and John's shoulder. He tangled his fingers between his hair and finally looked into his eyes with a blurry gaze.
"I can't complain about Mr. Holmes. Our many years of cooperation have been going very well so far ..." she said, staring at the screen. "... and the reasons for my absence in your hotel are different than you think ... John," she replied, giving him a friendly look and smiled, raising the corners of her mouth.
"And why did you agree to do it, John?" she asked, and as John considered the answer, she quickly answered the first part of his question.
John nodded. Indeed, in his equipment, he could not complain about the lack of guns, knives, and other weapons. He knew he had enough of it. Besides, Sebastian probably packed as many pistols and rifles with him as a small police station has. "Any gun can be useful. I'd rather have something behind my belt instead of fighting with my bare fists if our backpacks and other equipment were lost. Besides ..." John gently took the weapon from her hand. "Look only at this beauty".
"Mycroft! ... I mean Mr. Holmes" she corrected herself immediately. "John," she said with a smile when she saw him.
"Who knows. You Brits have your ways," Aaron said with a smile on his face. He reached for the empty glass, turned it over and placed it on Mycroft's things.
The two bodyguards who stared at Mycroft in confusion, looking for hints and instructions from him, finally decided to react. They grabbed Sebastian by the shoulders. John stared at his determined stare for a moment. Eventually, the grip relaxed and he was able to free his arm. He left the room without looking back.
John held her foot. He grabbed the thin heel with his free hand and broke it with a quick, determined movement. He did the same with the other shoe. He threw both heels to the water. He turned to Sherlock but did not notice the smile on his face because of the darkness. A moment later they went ahead again. Danieli Hotel was really close. All they had to do was cross the narrow channel separating them from one of several extra doors. They climbed on the gondola standing by the shore, not without problems because Molly almost lost her balance, but John's strong hand saved her from falling from a shaky boat into the water. They entered the hotel through the side door and breathed a sigh of relief. Only Sherlock looked around carefully.
"Oh, and if you will find, then buy some cookies for Sherlock as well, because he has been asking for in since yesterday ..." she paused, seeing his distracted expression. She stroked his face lightly to get his attention. "Get out of the house for a moment otherwise you will come up with some ridiculous idea." She tucked a shopping bag into his hand and gave him a kind smile at the same time. "I'll call you if I remember something I didn't put on my list".
"Stop giving me the third degree, Holmes. You know very well that not everyone has the opportunity to meet someone like you," he said, tightening his cloak as he felt the cold air coming from the Thames. He noticed that his harsh, admonishing tone hadn't spoiled the detective's mood. Moreover, Holmes seemed very pleased with what he heard.
To Mycoft's relief, his husband really could dance. He was spinning, holding Francesca in his arms and smiling at the people. More and more people came to the dance floor and watched this extraordinary scene.
Mycroft sighed softly and put the razor blades under running water. He moved it over the sink twice and put it on his face again.
"It's my job, Doctor," she replied with a slight smile. John was a bit confused when he realized that Mycroft couldn't just do everything alone. His question seemed pointless at the moment.
John couldn't understand it, and the thought of it almost droved him crazy. Sherlock wasn't a small child and he didn't need a babysitter. The more he thought about the reason, the more he was convinced that his friend had not done it without a reason. John felt a shiver when he thought, Sherlock had a hidden agenda. He looked at Molly. The girl was completely different from the people he had met here. Her body language, clothes, and behavior were all very different from what he saw in Francesca. Molly was sickly pale - though he had never paid attention to this detail until now - thin and ... ordinary. This thought suddenly hit John. He slowly turned into a man from 'this world', he started to see others through Mycroft's eyes, because he was surrounded by people who, like older Holmes, dealt with high-level events, but also made sure that they stood out in the crowd. He saw the difference between ordinary people - he was one of them - and people from higher society. He wondered if Mycroft was looking at him the same way? And Sherlock?
The gloomy, smelly passage between the buildings gave John the opportunity to listen closely. He heard one of them, presumably Mycroft, change positions in the armchair. He had to lean towards his brother right now and fix his eyes on him.
John could see the cogitation on Mycroft's face. He grabbed his glass and joined him, leaning against the balustrade. They both watched passing motorboats and gondolas. They heard conversations coming from people who enjoyed the nightlife. It was calm. The silence was broken only by John's phone, which vibrated on the table. Both men had already learned to ignore Sherlock's impatience and did not even pay attention to what time he could show them his bad mood.
"Sleeping off?". John did not hide his surprise. He passed Mycroft and stood before her. The genius was silent. He did not look ready for discussion, but rather someone who wants to be alone. "In the morning he was happy and full of energy."
Further efforts to end the conversation in the least conflicting way made no sense. Mycroft saw that Sherlock was already immersed in his own thoughts. He also had to think about some important things, although unlike his brother, he also had other responsibilities. After returning from Venice, he focused almost immediately on work. He might have involved his people, but thinking about John and what happened to them took too much of his time. He started to worry that the emotions that arose when he thought of the doctor would completely overwhelm him, and this had no right to happen. At least at that moment. He wasn't sure about his decision, and anticipating his choices was pointless. John has repeatedly proved to him that, although he seemed simple to decipher outside, he could behave in a completely irrational and surprising way. He had to leave his thoughts about their possible relationship until John finally dispelled his doubts. He walked slowly down the creaking stairs, trying to sort out his thoughts somehow. When he closed the main door and as he approached the black car, he noticed two people walking towards him out of the corner of his eye.
"Molly, don't you really see there is someone who cares about you for many years already?" asked John.
He saw, he hit the nail on the head. Mycroft started to approach him with something that looked like pain and darkness in his eyes. His red cheeks, clenched fists, and slightly shining eyes were proof of his hurt feelings. John felt he should shut up, he wasn't a cruel man. He wasn't like the Holmes brothers who hurt people with their words. However, Mycroft's proud attitude was even more challenging for John. He wanted the older man to be honest with him at least once and to throw off the mask he had cared for and put on his face every morning.
Mycroft, who heard Sherlock's soft murmur, sighed softly. "I know. I'm really sorry, brother mine." His voice rang unnoticed in the corridor, as did their footsteps on a soft carpet. "I would also prefer that this situation was not so serious and so you ... could finally do what you have been thinking of for so long." He smiled sadly. He wanted to comfort him, though it didn't work out too well.
Sherlock nodded this time as a sign that he agreed with Mrs. Hudson. He also noticed the satisfaction on John's face. Apparently warm climate, sunny days and heat was a nice change from the capricious London weather. As for John's appearance ... Well. John has always been John to him. He liked it both at the beginning of their acquaintance and now after so many years together.
"Would you please shut up for a moment and listen to what I want to say?" He exaggerated. He knew it, but emotions were starting to take over him. He was afraid of what he was about to say, and the discussion with Mycroft only irritated him. Especially since he was trying to sound like someone who was not involved in this case at all.
He had no idea what Mycroft was up to and what could make him feel so mad. He knew this has probably something to do with the upcoming meeting of ministers, politicians and other important personalities. He thought maybe one of the secret agents, one of the foreign politicians had sent a warning about a terrorist attack or something like that. Perhaps it was, for this reason, this extraordinary meeting was called. To find a way to prevent it. Perhaps the matter concerned the sudden problems of one of the countries. Only Mycroft, advisors and ministers convened to the meeting knew what had happened. John was glad it had nothing to do with Sherlock.
He shuddered as Holmes approached him. He had been thinking about their next meeting all day. But at that moment, he was almost overwhelmed with the realization, he could not only look at him but could also touch him... if he wanted to. He was breathing heavily and inhaled the pleasant scent wafting around the detective. Holmes' bright eyes studied every inch of his face. His gaze was reassuring... mesmerizing. Nothing mattered at the moment because he was the one that caught the attention of that intense stare. He forgot the last hour and the strange conversation with the stranger. A sudden, cold touch on his cheek made him hold his breath. Holmes's thumb cooled his ardent skin. He looked down at his mouth for a split second, then closed his eyes and hissed softly, feeling an unexpected burning sensation.
He tried to find a solution. He knew he had to deal with this situation by himself. He stood there, eyes closed, thinking what to do to break free from the murderer's grip and at least try to fight for his life. The sudden lack of movement made him focus on his attacker, who now had his hand on his coat pocket. Before he realized what had happened, the murderer quickly pulled out a hidden revolver and tossed it over his head down the alley. The metallic clang of the weapon echoed through the dark and damp aisle.
"Wait, Mycroft ..." John stopped him. "So, you need someone who will pretend to be your partner for two weeks?"
"Where's your Mycroft?" she asked, looking around. She did not do it vigorously but discreetly. She was so stylish and elegant doing that. John was impressed by her from the first meeting, and he still couldn't get over the admiration that she could keep the class by making even such small movements. Thinking about the answer, he looked toward the door to Sherlock's room. He wasn't sure if it would be prudent to say that Mycroft's younger brother had arrived at their hotel the night before, just because he wanted to keep an eye on them. He didn't even know how much Mycroft allowed others to know about himself. He wasn't sure if Francesca was privy to his family relationship. However, he decided to avoid this topic and let Mycroft deal with it alone.
The song didn't end but Lucy quickly got up from the stump. She ran a few steps. She leaned her hand on the tree, leaned, and vomited. Everyone looked at her in shock, but the most surprised of them was Josh.
"To Venice for example," she said, smiling from ear to ear. "John was so happy when he talked about his last trip. He is so happy, tanned, and his eyes glow more than usual. Did you notice that even his hair changed its color?" she asked and sighed. The sigh was full of sentiment. "But it's good to have both of you back," she added.
Lestrade nodded in satisfaction. "Speaking about help ... You will probably meet Mr Holmes," he looked at him as if he expected some reaction. However, he continued after not seeing any change on his face. "You know who I'm talking about, don't you? Mr Holmes. That detective."
"You have been alone for so many years and you rely only on yourself. You have gotten used to being lonely and you have not even noticed how your behavior affects Sherlock." Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his best friend flinch. "You two are so different ... and at the same time you are the same." Now comes the most difficult part of the conversation. The last thing he wanted was to hurt Sherlock. But he started and had to finish it. He took a deep breath, turning to his friend.
