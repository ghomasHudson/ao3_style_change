Without even thinking about it, Dean lets his hands slow, right in the middle of Castiel’s wing. The guilt is churning inside of him now, growing like a cancer, and only the feel and the sight of Castiel’s feathers inches from his face keeps him from vomiting.
John is nowhere to be found in the room, and all of his stuff is gone too. There’s no note or anything, but Dean just feels relief. This is normal. This is how things usually go: Sam gets mad and goes one way, John gets drunk and mad and goes the other, and Dean is the one left behind, quietly trying to keep them both alive. Besides, John did at least take his phone, because it’s off the charger, so he can at least call Bobby or Dean if he needs help.
Then the creature speaks, and all thoughts of Wall Street go straight out of Dean’s mind.
Castiel wraps a hand around Dean’s elbow, warm and strong and grounding, and takes the lead again, because Dean is the luckiest man on Earth. “My name is Castiel. This is Dean. We’re looking for Sam Winchester,” he says.
The door opens and Dean pastes a cocky smile on his face and –
“That will not be an essential piece of information.”
Dean jerks in shock. “He what? How do you know?”
“No one’s ever called me that before.”
Sam’s grin grows to epic proportions. He slings a comfortable arm around Jess and says, “So, hey, I guess it means it’s your turn then. How’d you two meet?”
“So, I guess you might want an update,” Dean says. “Uh, so, important stuff first: we defeated God. The old God, anyways. Chuck’s human now – Jack sucked all of his power out. It was kinda awesome. Chuck did blow up Michael, though. So now I guess we have no more archangels. And Jack brought everyone back that Chuck poofed. Because Jack is God now. Kinda. He likes to drop by for movie night and eat that really terrible sugary cereal. Oh, and Eileen and Sam . . .”
Castiel tilts his head and his wings draw back. He looks like a bird when he does it. “Why would I eat you?” he asks, sounding absolutely mystified. “I do not require sustenance. And I do not imagine you would taste very good.”
Which is when Dean remembers that, oh yeah, just because a monster has a name doesn’t mean it isn’t a monster, and he fires.
kind of response from Castiel. He’s relied on Castiel’s body language for so long that without it, he feels like he’s flailing in the darkness, both literally and figuratively. Even when he reaches up to his shoulder, he feels nothing, not even a twinge from the place where Castiel once seared his claim into Dean’s body.
“So smite me.”
This time, when Sam bursts into howls of laughter, Dean kicks him in the shin on the way to the bathroom.
It turns out that Castiel did not fly back to Heaven or whatever. No, he apparently wandered off when Dean was gaming the vending machine because he disapproved of the food quality and inquired about actual breakfast food. And then, instead of telling Dean what he was doing, he just flew off and got said food and then, upon seeing Dean was no longer at the motel, he looked for Dean’s soul and winged his way into Dean’s car.
“No,” Castiel says, face open and smiling. “When it became clear I had a human soulmate, one of my brothers fashioned a vessel for me, in preparation for the day I would walk alongside you. I did request some genetic material from my bloodline, so that this vessel could properly contain me, but this body is mine and mine alone. I did not take any person from their family, Dean.”
Dean subsides.
“You know how to disappear very well. But I was determined to find you. Although I had hoped for a less . . . eventful reunion.”
Dean rolls his eyes, because why does he always get the monsters who play dumb? “Yeah, I got that much. I mean,
“No, that’s what you are. Come on, man, I’ve been hunting since I was a kid. I know what I’m doing. We’ll cover more ground if we split up.”
Castiel purses his lips. He looks at Dean, eyes narrowed and focused, the same look Dean remembers from their one night stand, like he’s peering into Dean’s very soul, and he says, flatly, “No, thank you.”
“Well . . . no. But like. I saw you fly down from the clouds, and you didn’t go that fast.”
“I’m not done yet.” Dean takes a deep breath. You can’t lie to your soulmate, but that only applies to what comes out of your mouth. He could never say anything else, and Castiel would never know but – but Dean ran from Castiel once, and it’s only sheer dumb luck that brought them together again. He can’t count on that luck again. If anything, usually Dean has worse luck than the average person.
And, well, then Dean is absolutely, completely, one hundred percent awake. He’s not sure why he thought Castiel would refuse, because Castiel rarely tells him no, even when Dean is joking. This has led to some very awkward moments and Dean will never look at bees the same way again, but still, there’s a big difference between Dean requesting fresh honey and Dean requesting a full-time angel guardian to stand over his younger brother.
Somehow, this question offends Castiel more than the two before it. His wings flare wide and high, like a predator trying to scare off a competitor, and now that the sun is fully shining down upon the clearing, Dean can truly make out the finer details of his wings: the feathers, some as long as his arm and some as long as his leg; the colors, shimmering and shifting in a way that escapes description; and the way they so effortlessly hold still or move on a dime, without any effort on Castiel’s part.
“Well, yeah, I punched you and nothing happened, but your wings are different, dude.”
Dean raises his chin. “I’m not asking for a deal. It’s not like you can take my soul anyways.”
Dean opens one eye and glares. “Can we have this conversation when I’m awake?”
, Dean. I am not letting you go now.” He looks away and shuffles in place, as if surprised by the vehemence in his own voice. With a gentler tone, he says, “And besides, the warrant for your arrest was merely a cover. My division wants to recruit you, Dean. You’ve done great work and solved many cases before we even realized there was a case. You are insightful, resourceful, and charismatic. You would be a great asset to my division.”
“That’s not how sex works.”
. I see that you are caring and kind and selfless. I see that you would do anything for those you love. You’d let your brother walk out of your life to chase his dreams. You’d let your father trample all over you in his quest for vengeance. And you would drive me away in a misguided attempt to protect me. You would do all of this for
“Would you like me to procure – ”
“I’ll call you whatever I want,” the Shadow says, and abruptly its face is full of rage, like a switch has been flipped. It leans forward, menace in every line of its being, and its outline blurs at the edges like it can barely keep itself contained in Castiel’s form. “You dared to invade my home, and disturb my slumber, and demand that I break the deal Castiel
“My name is not ‘squeaky clean’,” Castiel objects, and he honest-to-God makes air quotes. “The Novak bloodline has been responsible for some truly horrendous things in our past – ”
Dean has approximately two seconds to think about what might happen if he pisses off the Shadow and wakes something else up before he decides he doesn’t care. He came for Castiel, and he isn’t leaving without him.
There’s no face in the flames, no voice, no taste, no landmark. There’s nothing.
“Soooo,” Dean says slowly, because Castiel gave him a really, really long explanation and Dean honestly stopped listening after the first sentence. “Angels exist.”
“Would you have believed I was an angel if I didn’t?”
,” Castiel says, and he sounds . . . not upset, but intense. Like he’s telling someone the sky is blue and can’t quite tell why they’re not believing them while looking at said blue sky. “Why do you not believe me?”
The first demon is shouting the chant now. “Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferna, me confirma. Potestas inferma, me confirma!” And every time he says it, Castiel glows a little brighter, until his entire face is a featureless mass of that blue-white crackling light Dean knows in his grace.
“I just did,” Castiel says, a tinge of pride in his voice. He frowns slightly when he sees Dean’s eyes tracking his wings in the reflection on the Impala and rolls his shoulders back, almost like he’s trying to make himself smaller – and then his wings are just
It takes Dean clearing his throat twice to get the words out. “What,” he spits out, “was that?”
“I thought you decided it wasn’t a werewolf?”
“Yes,” Dean says, just to see what Castiel will say.
“Mind telling me what that was about?”
“Well, I can’t follow you around forever,” Dean says, and it’s the hardest thing he’s ever said. “We gotta live our lives, right? This is your life, and it’s not the same as mine, but that’s okay. I can still be a part of it, but like. In my own way. So you’ll go to college and get that shiny piece of paper and become a kickass lawyer, and I’ll cruise around with Cas and kill monsters and save the day. Deal?”
Dean had ramped up the temperature in the hotel room last night, because Castiel runs hot and his skin had been startlingly cold when Dean dragged him in. Still, even though neither of them have touched the thermostat, Dean feels shockingly cold without Castiel’s warm wing blanketed on top of him.
“I am not immune to the laws of soulmates just because I am a supernatural being,” Castiel says sharply. “I cannot lie to you, as you cannot lie to me.”
, Cas, I thought you were dead!”
Dean looks at the Shadow. Looks at his hands. Looks at the Shadow again. “ . . . Okay?”
It stings a little, that Castiel would get bored of him within only like two hours, but Dean takes a deep breath and pushes away the hurt. He isn’t surprised, after all. Castiel really should have left the second Dean came back to the hotel. Or hell, even the second he got a good look at Dean’s soul. At least he did the courtesy of saving Dean a long trek back to the hotel.
Then they actually high five, and Dean stares at them trying to make sense of the chaos that is now his life. They are both wearing puppyish grins of excitement, sleeves rolled up and vibrating with the thrill of a case solved, and it’s sickeningly adorable and frighteningly chaotic at the same moment.
“Cas, what are you doing to my – ”
Castiel is nice, after all. He’s weirdly solicitous of Dean, getting him food and stuff. And he answers any question Dean asks, which is a damn strange experience after life with Sam and John.
Castiel shrugs. “If they are already loose, then they’re meant to fall out and new ones will grow in. It’s honestly more irritating to leave loose ones in my wings.”
“Yes.”
Jess is just opening her mouth to answer when the door rattles with the telltale clicking sound of a key turning the lock, and Dean doesn’t need to see the way Jess brightens or the way Castiel cocks his head to know who’s at the door. Sam used to jangle his keys the exact same way when they rented hotel rooms, and by instinct, Dean finds himself on his feet, facing Sam with a grin on his face like the months of silence never happened.
And because it’s just Dean’s luck, the thing dodges and makes another run for him again. He can’t jump out of the way again, it’s too close, so he gets slammed to the ground for an up close and personal face-eating attempt while he leverages his gun to keep it off him. Claws rake down his side, tearing through clothes and into skin, and Dean yells in pain. He works his silver knife free and slams it into the creature’s ribs, but it doesn’t even flinch and just scrabbles harder to get to Dean’s throat.
Dean fingers the soft quills of the feather he grabbed from the trunk. It’s nothing special, just an eagle quill, useful for only very basic rituals, but a soulmate summoning ritual requires something from the air and the land and the water, and a feather was the best thing he could find. Even under the muted overcast light, it gleams and shines as he turns it over in his hands, the promise of a brighter future, one where he could roam the skies and earth and waters with a soulmate at his side.
Castiel squints at him. “I told you. I am Castiel.”
Dean shuffles and kicks at the floor. He can’t deny that a huge part of him wants to stalk Sam around the campus for the next four years, but all around him is evidence of Sam’s new life: the stacks of books, the mismatched dishes, the clothes piled on chairs. Sam is happy here, and Dean can’t begrudge him that.
They stop for the night at a motel. Dean orders a double room by habit and regret swims up in his chest, regret that is half Sam and half John, but then Castiel brushes his elbow and the regret fades away, because hey, at least Castiel can get some sleep.
Dean kisses him. Because he can.
“Oh. I am an angel of the Lord.”
“Why would my will ever be to leave you?”
“I believed that I’d be able to tell you,” Dean whispers, “that I love you too.”
But with a flap of his wings Castiel is there, somehow right in front of the demon, and he halts the demon’s escape attempt with a palm to its face. He keeps pushing when he connects with the demon’s face until the demon falls to his knees, and then Castiel smiles.
“I see you got your wings back,” Dean notes.
. “Oh my god, Sam’s mentioned you!” she says. “Does he know you’re coming? He didn’t say a thing to me!”
“Cas – ”
Dean has thought of a
Dean falters, because that isn’t really where he was expecting Castiel to go. But then he remembers that Sam is probably going to come back because he expects to compare notes, which means he needs to get out and preferably far, far away before Castiel figures out that he can get the Winchester fugitives in a two-for-one package deal. So he says, “And I bet you don’t want a dropout fugitive attached to your squeaky-clean name, so how about you just let me – ”
Dean thinks at him. Castiel had once explained to him that he can find Dean by prayer, but while Dean had thought of rosaries and chants, Castiel had shrugged and said that angels were multidimensional beings and therefore capable of picking up on less formalized versions.
Dean swallows. “Okay,” he says, and both he and Castiel know he’s saying okay to more than just Castiel’s little promise. “Okay.”
“ – yes, I think you’re right,” Castiel is saying to Sam, frowning slightly at his own screen.
“I am not.”
“Yes, he is.”
, Dean?”
But it’s too late; with his concentration on Dean again and with the other demons having trampled all over the angel trap, the psychic hold on Castiel is broken and Castiel takes full advantage. Castiel yanks his arms free and sends both demons flying head over heels; he snaps his wings together and the demon at his back hits the ground. And then, just as the first demon is realizing his mistake, Castiel turns burning eyes on him and starts marching forward, every inch the avenging angel coming to cleanse the earth.
“What?”
Castiel frowns and sways on the spot, like he’s drunk. “I. I think – I think I may have overdone it,” he says faintly, and then collapses.
“The Empty warped it, but you – you were tracking how long. You wanted to know exactly, down to the second, the amount of time that I had been dead.”
Put that way, it sounds – well. “I made some dumb decisions after you died,” Dean mutters. He doesn’t even remember setting the timer, but he does remember each time he looked at it, and how every time seeing a bigger number had been like a gut punch.
“I don’t – ”
Castiel also, apparently, used his mojo to clean up Dean’s clothes, because he doesn’t have a speck of dirt on him. He really hopes it was Castiel’s mojo, anyways, because the alternative is something that Dean’s brain shies away from thinking about.
“Cas,” Dean says, “let me? Please.”
“Cas,” Castiel repeats. He tilts his head. “Why do you call me such?”
“Why the hell – ”
“Why not?”
“I’m glad you answered my call,” Dean tells him.
But Dean can’t stop now, he’s on a roll, sparks are flying in his gut and “Is everything because of orders? Did you fly down here because of orders? Did you follow me everywhere because of orders? Did your superiors want a report on what the funny humans do down here on earth?”
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean says hoarsely, and draws his hands back.
“Oh, shut it,” comes the Shadow’s voice from behind him.
And, well, Dean can’t argue with that. If he was a thousand feet tall, he’d probably feel super uncomfortable in a 6 foot tall body too.
They’re all too spooked to order pizza, but they do have ground beef in the freezer so Dean digs it out and whips up some burgers. Sam makes a prissy face, the health nut, but Jess gobbles it down with a steadiness that Dean admires, given that her entire world just expanded.
Silence greets that remark, so Dean opens his eyes again and looks at Castiel. Castiel looks a bit like someone’s whacked him over the head, and it’s so alarming that Dean sits up.
Since Dean has already eaten and Castiel doesn’t eat unless Dean shoves food at him, they go directly to bed. Castiel still watches him all night like a stalker, but Dean finally coaxed him into sharing a bed because firstly, it was giving Dean a crick in his neck to talk to Castiel when he would sit up or stand and secondly, well, the cuddling’s nice. Nothing – not even memory foam – can compare to being wrapped up in Castiel’s wings, like the warmest, fluffiest, silkiest blanket.
, and Dean has never hated and loved his brother more at the same time than at this moment.
A shadow falls upon the earth, huge and terrible, a shape Dean’s brain fails to recognize or categorize, and it is moving and –
wings. And halos. And harps. You know, to sing hymns and all that?”
“My orders were to protect you,” Castiel replies, starting to sound annoyed. “Whatever the cost.”
“Oh, yeah? And who’s the expert on human sex? You or me?”
“So, if I check out Victim Number Two – bingo!” Sam crows, clicking into a database. “Yep, she used to babysit at that place too – ”
“I uh. I made a list. After we won. Stuff I wanted to say. I didn’t bring it with me because most of it was useless crap, but I think I should probably say item number one now. While you’re here and not flying off to Heaven. Which, you know, you can, afterwards. But. Well. I need to say it. Because you didn’t let me, in purgatory. And you didn’t let me when you died for me, you assbutt.”
“My place is with you,” Castiel interrupts. “Heaven is stable, now. If they need me, they know where to find me.”
Dean waits and watches . . . and falls asleep.
This time, the sound echoes. Dean isn’t sure what changed, but now his yell carries, rumbling through the Empty, and the feeling of a thousand eyes on Dean’s back returns. It’s not Castiel; this is surprise, confusion, malice, anger, hunger. This is other things, probably starting to wake up.
“No, but this will,” Castiel says, and he brings his hand up and closes his fingers together around thin air.
Dean yawns and presses close. Castiel still doesn’t really understand why Dean makes him take off his shirt when they go to bed, but the first time Dean whipped off his own shirt, his eyes went huge and he stopped protesting.
“I’m not. Uh. Good. At this kind of stuff,” Dean says, kind of lamely. “But I’d like to try. For you. With you. You know. If you want me too?”
And of course Dean loses, because that’s the story of his life.
And then Castiel goes for the killing blow. “Dean, I want you to,” he says softly.
“It’s a little messed up. I took it with me into the Empty and I think it’s broken.”
“None of that,” Dean interrupts. “We are finding something you like to celebrate with if we have to order the entire menu.”
“Guess the Empty finally decided to make a portal and spit me out,” Dean says, grinning.  He sets off again, whistling to himself. He can’t see anything yet, but that doesn’t matter; they had walked for weeks, following the trail of the wind, before they’d found the portal out of purgatory. “And don’t get any ideas, Cas. I
. The pipe warps and the demon barely flinches, but it’s certainly enough to make the demon turn on Dean, frothing at the mouth with rage.
“Why are you glaring? Is my tie backwards again?”
“Yes,” Castiel says, completely deadpan. “I would mind.”
“Does it bother you? My wings being out?”
“Thanks.”
Dean swallows, but the guilty feeling doesn’t dissipate. He clears his throat instead. “With your wings. They look a little ragged.”
That’s the theory, anyways. Jack had tried to explain the difference between purgatory and the Empty about five times before they’d given up and just gotten the ingredients for the spell.
Dean swallows hard. In the clearing, the wings had gleamed green and purple under the sun, but things are a little different now that Dean isn’t worried about being killed and is much closer. Now he can see that the light reflects off Castiel’s wings like a sunbeam glittering off a raindrop, scattering brilliant specks of color all over the room. The most prominent, of course, are the purples, running around the edges like the feathers are dipped in them, and the greens, which run down the center like veins, but Dean sees tiny glimpses of other colors as Castiel’s wings shift and twitch lazily, even though there’s no breeze in the room.
, you nearly were incinerated by a – ”
“Deal,” Sam echoes, except when Dean holds out his hand to shake, his brother reels him in and squashes him in a hug instead.
The first ingredient is a bit of dirt, dug from where Dean walked. Earth is the easiest ingredient, really, since humans are of the land. He dumps it into the bottom of the bowl, which is laid at the center of the star now.
“I may have gone dream-walking a few times,” Castiel admits casually. “I was . . . nervous. He has very sweet dreams of you.”
And it’s coming for Dean, angling towards him.
Dean says, “I don’t have a ring.”
One where Dean wouldn’t always be so abandoned, so
Dean says, “Oh my god.”
Dean swallows and keeps his eyes shut. “But you gotta. I won’t – I can’t keep you here. Not against your will.”
“So, Jess,” Dean drawls, leaning back, “tell me how my gigantor brother worked up the nerve to ask you out. I know for a fact you’re way out of his league.
“I would like to meet Sam too, you know,” Castiel tells him, because he always knows exactly what to say. He leans close and nuzzles Dean’s neck like a cat, sweet and adoring, like he didn’t spend their entire lunch making disgusted faces at Dean eating six giant pizza slices in rapid succession and threatening to leave Dean to his fate if he suffered stomach pain afterwards. “I am glad you suggested us coming to California to see Sam.”
Castiel doesn’t even blink at the change in his demeanor. He tilts his head and replies, “I’ve been looking for you for a long time now. It would be nice to know that my method of following suspicious deaths paid off. Although I suppose that luck intervening on our side would be nice as well,” he muses.
, wings whipping up a mini tornado of papers, eyes glowing bright blue, palm grasping the smoke and forcing it mercilessly back into Brady.
If he can kill it.
“So should I start yelling again, or . . . ?”
“Where are you going?” Dean demands.
Dean looks at Castiel, panicking.
permission to flap off the second we get home, you hear me? We have stuff to talk about.”
,” Castiel notes smugly. “Also, she kept saying that she had information for Sam Winchester and was on the run.”
“Cas,” Dean says, because he still has one last thing to say. “I don’t want you to go. Back to Heaven.”
At that point, Dean is itching to get away, so he just nods and stomps in the grass, grateful that Castiel does not follow him. Out of the corner of his eye, he thinks he sees the telltale shimmer of Castiel’s wings sliding into this plane of existence, but then he turns past a tree and loses sight of Castiel altogether. It leaves Dean alone for the first time in two days, and he revels in it.
Dean just about crashes the car.
Looking at them, Dean has to wonder if he would have assumed Castiel was a monster if he wasn’t raised a hunter, because Castiel’s wings are so beautiful that Dean is sure people would worship at Castiel’s feet if they only saw one glimpse of them.
“You guys have blades?”
After three hours of fruitless wandering, Dean decides to split up. Castiel isn’t happy about it, and he refuses to take a flashlight or a gun.
Sam says, very loudly, “I’m beat, I’m gonna go to bed. Night, Castiel. Night, Dean.”
“It was a successful endeavor,” Castiel replies. His formal wording is completely at odds with his soft affectionate tone, but Dean is responsible for most of Castiel’s softening, so he usually just grins and enjoys it. “There were three demons watching the apartment and five more around the town. I exorcised some, killed the ones whose vessels were too far gone. I also captured one to interrogate; she’s bound in a devil’s trap.”
“Cas – ”
The kitchen is nice and homey. There are novelty mugs on the counter, mismatched plates in the sink, a dirty saucepan abandoned on the stove. It’s not quite the apple pie life, but Dean can see that Sam would love it, even if he probably bangs his head on the doorway every time.
“And it has joy and beauty and love. You’ve shown me that.”
smile and holds up his badge as the door swings open. He even gets started on his spiel as the door is opening because he’s learned the hard way that some people wrongly assume he’s housekeeping and slam the door shut in his face. Or, worse, assume he’s soliciting for . . . other things.
Or, so Dean thinks. He’s kind of distracted by the blazing hot and amazingly tasty breakfast burgers and tater tots, which he is cramming into his mouth as fast as possible.
. The whole world fades away, sounds and lights falling to the edges of his perception, until there’s nothing and no one but Castiel, glowing and happy like he’s the only thing that matters, because he is.
“Hello, Dean Winchester,” this creature says, eyes laser focused on Dean, voice deep and rough like a phone sex hotline connected straight to all of Dean’s deepest, darkest, most shameful fantasies. “I am Castiel.”
“I insulted you. And shot you. And walked you right into some demon’s hands – ”
Dean is too busy being horrified at the idea of Castiel’s beautiful wings burnt into ash on the ground to reply, so Castiel just continues, “I was merely . . . recharging, I suppose you would call it.”
And then it’s over – the high-pitched ringing cuts off abruptly, the light dies away, and the only sounds are Dean and Castiel breathing heavily. Dean looks up, tentatively, and finds no sign of the demons. All that’s left are piles of faintly-smoking ash scattered around the barn.
Castiel pokes Dean hard in the back, but Dean is already moving. He dodges the couch and the chair and Jess with the ease of long practice in tiny motel rooms as Sam drops the books he’s holding in his hands, and they collide in the middle of the room, so hard that Dean actually has the breath knocked out of him, and Sam staggers back a step. But then they have their arms wound around each other and it’s great, it’s wonderful, it’s like the world is spinning in perfect alignment again.
“Did you really think I’d smite you?” Castiel asks, sounding amused.
“Forgive me if I don’t trust your word,” Castiel replies dryly, ignoring Sam losing it in the corner again. But his eyes soften and he stands up, walking right into Dean’s personal space as he comes over to the bed, and Dean has nowhere to go, so he has to just lay there, squished against the mattress like a bug waiting to be stomped on, as Castiel leans over the handcuffs. Warm fingers touch his hand and Castiel flicks his wrist, murmuring a word under his breath. The handcuffs click open and Dean breathes a sigh of relief.
“Will you be safe?”
Dean can’t help but melt at that. His all-powerful, teleporting, angel of the Lord soulmate, pouting because he finished off a burger too quickly. It’s adorable.
“Sam misses you,” Dean finally offers up. It’s safer than the alternative. “Jack too. And Claire. And Jody. Even Rowena. And I – ”
“It kills demons.”
Dean thinks this over for a minute. Then he levels a finger at Castiel. “You totally came down with your wings out to impress me, didn’t you?”
Dean thinks wistfully, edging around a fallen tree.
Sam looks up, a sweet smile on his face for Jess, and then stops dead in his tracks like he’s been whacked over the head. Dean would know; he’s seen it in person.
The demon looks at him and grins. “Now, why would I do that? See, I think I have the upper hand here, actually. All I have to do is squeeze,” he says, “and this little wayward seraph will do anything I want. For starters, he’s going to put away that lovely little blade.”
“Oh yeah?” Dean wheezes into the carpet. “And why should I believe you?”
There’s a thump and a grunt, which Dean takes as assent that someone is coming, so he pastes on his best
Dean shrugs. “I mean, I’m the seeing is believing type, and you saw Cas,” Dean points out. “Hard to deny what he is. Also he’s pretty clear about what he is if you ask him.”
Castiel scowls and grabs his shoulder, holding him as effortlessly still as he had held the monster. “Human hands can heal as well as harm,” he says shortly. “So can mine. Now please, hold still, Dean.”
– like it’s a fact of life, easy as breathing, regular as the sun rising and not defying the very laws of mortality. That Castiel, an angel, would resurrect Dean, a human, without hesitating for a second.
Fortunately, this room only has one king-sized bed. Dean had laughed about it when the clerk apologetically told them it was the only room left and Castiel had freaked the clerk out by saying
“You always lose.”
Dean thinks about it for about two seconds, and then has to stop because just – no. He can slap Castiel for that when he has Castiel safely on earth again.
Dean opens his eyes. He doesn’t really want to meet Castiel’s eyes, but he does anyways, because he thinks he knows what Castiel means, but . . . “When we got stuffed in the top secret prison?”
Dean touches his shoulder again. It’s still weird, feeling the pressure of his own hand and the possibly-Castiel-pressure, but it’s better than silence.
“I thought that’s why I had this,” Dean says, raising his wrist to wave the still-very-attached handcuff at him. “So I couldn’t run?”
“Six weeks, four days, fifteen hours, and twelve seconds.”
“Nothing more important than you.”
“Take off your clothes, goddamn it, we’re having sex right now.”
Castiel gives him a sour look. “Did you think my wings were just for decoration?”
“Dean.”
Dean opens his mouth. Shuts it. Opens it again.
Dean shuts his mouth. He can give Castiel this. He can take Castiel’s last words and memorize them. One day, in the far future, they might not even hurt to think about when he’s alone and drunk in a bar.
Castiel actually honest-to-God rolls his eyes. And not a normal people roll your eyes either, no, he literally tilts his whole head upwards like he’s receiving revelation from angels or something. “Fingerprints, Dean,” he repeats, sounding exasperated. “You are excellent at destroying monsters’ remains and destroying evidence of supernatural beings at crime scenes. You are not so excellent at destroying evidence that ties you to said crime scenes.”
“We have them,” Castiel announces, sounding delighted. “Excellent work, Sam. I’ll call my superiors and let them know that this is a standard salt and burn.”
After one hour, he stops getting up every five minutes to check if Castiel is breathing (he’s not, angels don’t need to breathe, and the heart attack Dean gets every time he forgets really gets old after a while).
“My true form is very damaging to the human mind. Only certain, special people can perceive my true visage without harm,” Castiel explains. His wings are softening, dipping downwards to cocoon them again, and with Castiel’s low, dark voice and the warmth of a body pressed all along his front, Dean feels a bit like he’s taking part in something way more intimate than just two dudes talking.
“Good boy,” the Shadow says. It tilts his head and grins, sly and sneaky like a fox. “Firstly, you’ll have to find your own way out of here. Even if I wanted to help you – and I don’t – I can’t, because you need to end up on Earth, and I can only go if I’m summoned. Secondly, you will not wake up anything else you find between now and leaving, because if you split my attention, you might pop out with half a Castiel instead of the full-fledged model. Are we clear?’
Dean snaps his head up. Castiel’s voice is edged with something Dean does not like, something uneasy and wary and entirely not at place with the confident angel who’d flown down from Heaven and declared himself Dean’s soulmate. But he must take too long to respond, because Castiel draws his shoulders up, and his wings slip into that translucent form again, the one Dean has learned is the midway stage before they disappear entirely.
“What happened to
“Dude.”
It’s honestly the worst speech Dean’s ever given, and he’s given quite a few bad ones in his life, but it doesn’t seem to matter. Castiel’s fingers curl within his own, slotting into place between his own like puzzle pieces locking together, and Castiel’s eyes are bright with happiness, so bright they’re almost hard to look at, but Dean does it anyways, because Castiel is truly beautiful like this.
Castiel puts one hand on Dean’s knee, probably half because he likes touching Dean and half in response to his prayer. Jess takes one look at them, tilts her head, and smiles brilliantly.
“What’s the matter?” Castiel asks softly. “Why do you still doubt what I say?”
“I’m not gonna run away! I just need to piss.”
drag you out. You aren’t staying behind. There will be no penance, you hear me?”
“It has nothing to do with your being. It’s tied to a bloodline.”
By the time Castiel has winged his way back with breakfast – burritos and fries, score – Dean has found a new hunt. Or, well, what’s shaping up to be good signs of a hunt. Usually Sam is better at the tech angle, but where there are headlines about bodies dropping from “animal attacks,” there are usually monsters to be found.
He doesn’t wait for Castiel’s reaction, however small it might be. He doesn’t let himself even blink, because he knows if he stops and pauses and blinks he’ll look back, he’ll turn around and open his eyes and do everything the Shadow warned himself not to do.
Needless to say, they get a healthy share of burgers and pie to go.
And Dean wouldn’t believe it, but for the fact that he tried to lie to Castiel five minutes ago and the words literally would not leave his mouth. He tries to reconcile this fact in his mind, that the FBI has a division for handling supernatural cases that employs supernatural beings, and still can’t quite wrap his mind around it. Because yeah, soulmates can’t lie, but there’s a lot of ways to avoid telling the full truth that aren’t lying. Plus, cynicism kind of runs in Dean’s blood.
What better time, too, than when Castiel can’t crush Dean’s hopes and dreams?
“Watch me. Also, he’s not my boyfriend,” Dean says. “He’s Cas. And I want him back.”
When Dean emerges, Castiel is sitting awkwardly on the sofa, too straight and too unmoving to ever pass as human. Jess is bustling around, trying to clean up the stacks of papers and utensils littered about the room, so she doesn’t notice, but Dean still rolls his eyes and nudges Castiel hard when he sits down next to him.
“You just told me,” Castiel reminds him impatiently. “At the door. I assume you’re investigating the suspicious deaths?”
“Why would I need to disrobe to – ”
Dean has absolutely no memory of going from standing awkwardly in the corridor to sitting on the motel bed, but between one blink and the next he finds himself trying to count possible exits as Castiel shuts the door shut behind them and locks it. And slides the chain on, for good measure.
“Why you little maggot – ” he starts to say.
“Yeah,” Sam replies slowly. “I see that. Where’d he go, anyways? I saw he took Brady’s, uh, well. The body.”
Dean . . . Dean gets nothing.
But this kiss – it’s different. It’s Dean affirming his words and Castiel responding in kind, and it’s joyful and beautiful and everything Dean never dared to dream about when he first set out into the woods all those months ago to do a soulmate summoning ritual.
Castiel kisses him back.
Jess laughs. Castiel huffs.
Sam has no words to refute that.
And Castiel knows him better than he knows himself, because his gorgeous wings arch up and curve backward, cocooning Dean in soft, warm feathers. Dean is at once protected and surrounded in the reminder that Castiel is alive, that he’s safe and here and not being torn apart by demons. It’s just enough to loosen the knot in Dean’s throat.
“Then I must confess to being at a loss as to what—”
“Because then I can forgive you for it. For all of it. And then we can get past this.”
slithered over his friend’s brain. Closing his eyes, he pushed back with warmth and love, willing him to remember at least that he was safe, that Castiel was watching over him.
“Really?” The question was full of doubt.
He looked at me some more. I shrugged in genuine acknowledgement that I had no idea what was going on.
Jack looked disappointed. “You’re holding his vessel’s gender against him?”
Wally agreed and looked enthusiastic, pointing to Dean. “They always smell like food.”
Slowly, he made his way over, looking more determined than grieving now, which was at least something.
“Dean,” the angel moaned. “Dean.”
Oh well. That’s why the ritual took several days.
Dean and Sam Winchester, Bobby Singer, Jo and Ellen, Ash and his notoriety in Heaven, and everything else since I took James as a vessel has brought me to a place in my existence that I could never have suspected.
Everyone went to go pack.
“Uh, not quite.”
“The Apocalypse.”
Castiel glared at him, took a breath, and then swiveled on his ass, presenting the back of his trench coat and now what looked like hundreds of large, vaguely outlined, black-to-gray feathers.
I wanted to be there, but I had no vessel yet, still negotiating with Jimmy Novak. But I could have left someone else to be there, such as Uriel.
But right after that, Sam had felt indignant. He had once believed that Dean could be happy, could have an apple pie life. When had that stopped?
“Yes.”
If asked, at that moment I would have given my blade to have Sam or Jack walk in with news of a new hunt. In a romantic comedy, the wacky neighbor would show up right now with some wild sexual discussion of underwear or complaining about not being able to sell their salt-and-pepper shaker collection on eBay.
“You carry around a tiny harp?”
“From where you gripped me tight?” Dean asked, beginning to float on the uplift of Cass’ every touch.
It was probably Sam’s comment that the theory wasn’t kinky enough for Crowley that did it.
“I belong to you as well. In the fight ahead, we will be each other’s.”
He didn’t need Google to tell him to be gentle. Cass looked about two seconds away from jumping to Jupiter. With a low hum for warning, he reached out his right hand to touch the nearest tuft of feathers, surprised-but-not when his fingers touched fluff.
“Sam, shut the hell up!”
“The best strategy against Michael.” This was the first time I had been defensive with Dean. I disliked it intensely. I got hold of myself with some difficulty. “I’m thrown off by his—”
“Sam!” Dean called “Let's roll!”
“Are you serious?”
Dean looked slightly insulted. “Not a chance. Cass has felt nothing, and we’ve seen nothing. It’s just a ship of nerds and wannabes.”
“Cass, please.” Dean was shaking now, uncertain whether to pull his legs back or flip himself over and present.
“By being a romantically involved couple?”
“When we get out of here, we’ll talk,” Cass was saying quietly. “We’ll be able to get through this. It was just a matter of survival. This was nothing compared to the intimacy you’ve shared with many others, which is all a natural aspect of your personal character.”
She wanted them to help her and a hunter named Wally kill a demon.
Sam started to respond, but then closed his mouth. Jack was right. This wasn’t a question of whether he minded that two of his three fathers were romantically involved.
Dean knew he should have just let that one go, but screw it.
“Wow! That’s the best angel blade I’ve ever seen!” she enthused. “Be sure to show it when you’re on stage!”
“No, it’s about us, together, a little slice of hell we went through together.” Dean leaned forward, irritated and a little hurt himself when Cass shrank back a bit. “I’m not leaving all that on you. I want to see it all. I want to know everything!”
And then Dean committed an act of cruelty I would have thought beyond him. And I’ve seen him torturing souls in Hell.
“Cass, are you horny for me, or what?
First, he hasn’t really thought about just how many “fandoms” were going to be there. There were dozens of Kirks and Spocks (and new cast), tons of tall guys with long striped scarves holding dog robot-things, man-woman pairs in dark suits with FBI badges they kept flashing, at least twenty Xenas with Gabrielles (He approved of the Xenas, except for the ones with beards.), and more Luke, Vaders, Han Solos, and Leias in gold bikinis than a frat guy could dream of.
As a centuries-old ruin, the place was impressive, if very dry and a little hot. There wasn’t a ceiling over the main area, but Cass had beamed them into an alcove, so their heads are covered. In fact, Dean feels instinctually they need to stay in the alcove for Cass’ blood sigil to work. No wonder he didn’t want Ruby just wandering around.
In the end, Dean and Castiel won tickets, but Sam and Jack didn’t. The cruise wasn’t for another week, and the team spent most of it checking time throughout the Caribbean islands so Sam and Jack could be there when the cruise ship made a port of call. Jack assured Sam the trips wouldn’t be hard on him, and Sam assured Jack he wasn’t worried about it (liar), and in the end they had the schedule worked out to the minute, along with all the possible delays.
Castiel looked abruptly sad, though only in his eyes. Dean wasn’t sure the others could tell, and his voice was as deep as always.
And then I thought nothing, and waited.
Finally, Dean just took half his toiletries and shoved them into Cass’ bag. Then he and Sam made up some passports and informed their phone service provider they would be roving.
“That’s the point. Some ways of loving just aren’t the same as others. Dean isn’t attracted to Castiel.”
Jack shrugged. “Some of these guys really look like Sam and Dean.”
“All right, so, episode three.”
Cass slumped.
I believe that moment was also when I began to suspect the truth about myself and Dean Winchester. At least, it is my truth. I’m quite aware it’s not his.
Dean closed his eyes.
Sam turned to look at his brother. “Dean, don’t take it out on Jack. He’s right.” Sam clicked over to a photo. “These guys look more like the book version of us than we do.”
Castiel.
“Yes. He has trouble making conversation without dropping a literary reference every few sentences. In his frustration, he used the power the Angel Tablet was giving him at the time to ‘download’ 2,000 years’ worth of books, movies, TV shows, plays, poetry, and whatever else he’d consumed into my head.”
“They’d have made—Sam?”
Something far to his right moved. Whipping his head around, he prepared to drop his angel blade, then stilled.
Dean’s breathing hitched.
“Dean is pinned down,” Cass said. “We need to hurry.”
He laughed. “That your idea of nearby?”
The angel seriously doubted that.
Holding his stomach, Sam burst into laughter, rolling around a bit on his narrow bed. It was juvenile, maybe, but the thought of Castiel standing on a balcony in the moonlight did not allow any other response.
“Why?”
I stopped, looked around, and found a small coffee shop, Demetrius Bakery. Inside were warmth, coffee, and a couple tables with chairs. I sat at one, wondering why the owners had named the place after the King of Macedonia, who was a powerful but thoroughly loathsome person.
“Because I'd like you to come on the mission as well.”
Yeah, no thank you, assbutt. Asswipe. Asshat. Whatever it was. And who cared about things like that anyway?
It’s not small thing when an angel loses himself, yet I knew Dean was strong enough to catch all of me and hold me together.
“I don’t really think it was there at all,” Cass went on. “It was just a warning to me and Sam.”
Dean’s stomach dropped down to his knees—both of them dripping with slick now. His heart was pounding, he was sweating, and he couldn’t breathe right.
Dean scowled at his little brother. First Cass had been acting all twitchy at the restaurant, and now Sam looked shaken up.
“It won't work.” Castiel looked horrified for a second, and then made another non-expression. “He's already infected. The hunger is just going to travel with him.”
“Which means what?”
“Nixe!” Madam Laveau shouted, clearly annoyed. The two men going back to their rooms couldn’t make sparks in a match factory. The coven all nodded in agreement. Total nothings, even though they had done well enough that first night.
Dean nodded. “OK, but what about you? I mean, what does hunger have to do with your wings?”
If he were lucky, he woke up only with the lingering sensations of pain and harsh light. If he weren’t lucky, he was back in hell, having pieces of himself carved away by Alistair, or, even worse, the knife was in his own hand, and another soul was on the rack.
I was also quite aware that the band’s merchandise often uses a logo incorporating a pair of wings.
In a very weird moment, Sam sort of got the
“My departure from Heaven was not without its complications.”
“Son of a bitch!” Dean couldn’t keep his hips from thrusting forward, but Cass just rode it out. Dean would have come then, but strong fingers circled his base and held the impulse back.
Castiel gave him the slightest smile, then thunder boomed, the light got weird, and the shadow of two great wings rose up on the wall behind him.
“And what?”
“Lucifer!”
“Which means?”
“No. What exactly did you say next?”
It’s not an angel action. Angels do not have fantasies. We live to serve.
The silence went on for quite a bit longer and was finally broken by a soft moan.
“Then, when the order came for me to rescue Dean, things began to become uncomfortable. Many avoid me, and though angels are not supposed to feel jealousy, I have noticed some of my fellow soldiers showing me open resentment.”
Thanks for all the kind words! Do you think this needs a sequel? Or is it good?
Hours passed.
“Cass? You in there?”
Sam nodded. “That works.”
“Be careful,” Sam said.
Even when the need started, it wasn’t bad at first. He felt more than a little sexy, and for the first time ever he wasn’t faking it. He felt desirable, warm and daring, and a little bit fearless. Lying there in bed, trying to convince himself he would find his alpha in time, Dean ran his fingertips over his cock and balls and backside and felt good.
Cass frowned, sitting back slightly on the couch, huddled in his trench coat. “They’re not pertinent, Dean. You’ve had sex before. Just, fill in the details.”
“No.” Sam shook his head, glad he could start on familiar ground. “No, nobody’s dying, as far as know.”
“So, why can’t Dean love Castiel like that” Jack asked.
“I think you shouldthinkaboutgettingtogether.”
Dean wanted to tell Sam to go piss up a tree, but looking at the guys on the laptop screen, he had to admit they did really look like “Sam and Dean.”
Cass nodded. “For some time now, I have been aware that some of my bothers and sisters have been furtive. I sense hidden agendas, and I believe, as difficult as it has been for me to accept, that not all angels are working together as we used to.
About ten minutes later, Sam walked into the kitchen. Dean was now eating his burger and talking to Cass about what he thought the angels might have done to Bobby. Cass, an untouched burger on his own plate, was saying he didn’t know.
“I'm not angry with you, Benny. Mind you, I should be, but…” Ray shrugged. “This isn't the first time this has happened.”
Dean stood up. “Get the hell out of here. There’s no such thing.”
They split up again, though this time Sam took Jack. Cass and Dean were still glaring (or whatever that was) at each other.
“Dean!” the angel shouted, then clamped his mouth shut, body tensing.
“Start by showing me the videos.”
Those eyes flashed with grief. “I tried, Dean. I tried everything I could think of to get them to let you go. I begged. Sam begged. We offered everything we could think of that didn’t involve another human life. They were adamant.”
"Spock," Kirk whispered. "Spock, please..."
It was hardly the first time the angel Castiel had lied to a Winchester.
“You know, the Shadow only said I couldn’t look at you. Pretty sure you can talk to me.”
“Only the most important one.” The Shadow pauses dramatically and its grin gets even bigger, if that’s possible. It actually stretches from ear to earth, black teeth making up half of its face. “You can’t look at Castiel until you’re back on Earth.”
The wings vanish as abruptly as though someone had flicked a light switch, and, if Dean didn’t know better, he would say Castiel was actually pouting.
barges in and makes rude demands! First Death, and then Castiel, and now you – what am I, a walking doormat that says
“Don’t. You. Dare. You know better than I do what a demon could do with your meatsuit. I’m not worth that many deaths.”
“Sure looks like it.”
“Sam never said you had found your soulmate!”
before.”
“I missed you,” Dean says, because months of living with Castiel have taught him the need for actually communicating.
The Shadow makes a motion like threading a needle. “He stitched your soul together,” it repeats. “Carved off slices of his own grace to do it. You’re too human for me to lay hands on, Dean Winchester, but the veins of your soul? That’s all Castiel, through and through.”
“Well, I’m not exactly gonna let you eat me, am I?” Dean retorts.
“Oh.” Dean swallows hard. He probably would have panicked if Castiel had flown off to Heaven, and there’s something rolling restlessly in his stomach at the idea of Castiel predicting that and choosing to stay, even though it extended his recovery time. “So uh. What did the demon do to you?”
“I am not a person. I am a celestial – ”
He clears his throat and says, “I invoke, conjure, and command you, appear unto me before this circle.”
Slowly, the hurt starts to fade as Dean cruises down the open road. The sun is shining, his favorite song is playing and hey, he got to meet an angel. That’s something no one else Dean knows can say.
And this, this is exactly why Dean argued that it should be him – not Sam, not Jack, not anyone else. Because Dean knows that when he raises his chin and stares in defiance and says “Yep” it really pisses people off.
“If I wanted the human dead, I could have killed him already,” the demon points out. “All it would take is one flick of my wrist to break his neck.”
Castiel doesn’t come back.
“You don’t think you deserve a soulmate,” Castiel says, voice too loud in their little cocoon. He sounds at once like he’s discovered the secret to the universe and his favorite pet dog just died, triumphant and terribly sad.
After that, Dean crouches down and lays the feather carefully in. The last thing he needs is for it to blow away, so he quickly says, “I invoke, conjure, and command you, appear unto me before this circle.”
Castiel’s face contorts with rage. His eyes go bright with power, his fingers go hot where they’re wrapped into Dean’s collar, and Dean sees the sweeping shadow of great arcing wings in his back. He looks like he’s about two seconds from incinerating Dean himself.
“He what?”
“Dean – ”
Jess blushes, looking down at her feet, and wow, if that’s how Dean acts when people ask him about Castiel, maybe that’s why people assume they’re soulmates. Then he nudges Castiel’s shoulder with his own, eyebrow raised in question, and snorts a quiet laugh at Castiel’s firm nod in reply. Sometimes Castiel’s angelic abilities for reading people’s minds really come in handy.
The idea of Castiel finishing fixing his wings in a hurry does
And now Castiel is sad, shoulders and wings drooping as he half-heartedly combs his fingers through some of his feathers, and Dean can’t stand it.
Seeing as Dean has to blink away the sparks in his vision, he has a good idea of what happened. “Did you just – did you just
“Your soul, you moron,” the Shadow snaps. “Your soul
“I could fly the car. And you, of course.”
The demon sighs. “You have my word I’ll let the human go. Honestly, he’s tainted goods anyways. He smells horrible. Too much angel stink, if you ask me.”
The interconnecting door swings shut with an audible
made. I’m well within my rights to kill you here and now.”
“With what?” Castiel asks. He sounds utterly exhausted, like he needs ten more hours of sleep, and even his hand movements are lethargic, not the precise elegance he usually displays.
“Cas,” Dean hisses.
“Oh?”
“What, you were like a DeLorean without enough plutonium?”
Dean opens his eyes. Just a little. He keeps his head lowered, so that all he sees are Castiel’s knees, touching his. “You’re – you’re staying?”
What comes out of Dean’s mouth is most certainly not rehearsed: “Hi, I’m Dean Winchester, I’m a hunter pretending to be with the FBI so I can ask you if you’ve seen a ghost recently.”
Dean doesn’t recognize the town or the restaurant Castiel gives him, but Castiel helpfully tells him that it is a highly recommended breakfast establishment about one hundred miles north of their current location.
“No, not that.”
“I did,” Castiel says, and nothing else. His right wing lifts back up and then stretches high, towards the ceiling, followed by the left wing. It’s almost like those yoga exercises Lisa kept trying to get Dean to do, but for wings.
); when dinner is served early in the drawing room rather than the dining room - lighter and less elaborate than usual, as the more extravagant fare will be served later in the evening, once they are confident in their position to celebrate - since the dining table has already been moved into the hall. Despite the constant movement around him - campaign staff and highborn friends of the family and domestic help darting back and forth through the hallways - Michael keeps Dean close throughout the afternoon as if he derives some strange sort of comfort from his proximity, occasionally dumping papers into his arms to carry, or making him fetch letters or colleagues or staffers (a challenge, since Dean knows no one’s name).

He drifts ghost-like around the house for the next few hours while Castiel is at evening service; eats an improvised meal of leftovers while standing awkwardly in front of the larder, and goes back to bed almost immediately afterwards.
It must be obvious on his face. Cas moves towards him, slow as anything, his hands slightly raised. This is unheard of, too: any time Dean’s been around alphas while he’s in heat - or even on the cupse of it - they’ve got grabby almost immediately, pushing him around and pawing at him. It’s his own fault - it’s what the scent of heat does to them, that’s well-known - and if it were Cas pinning him or nipping at the back of his neck, he wouldn’t even mind it. Shit, he almost got Cas to do that
‘Fine,’ says Castiel, stubbornly. ‘Lift up and I’ll put one under you.’
‘Thank you, brother,’ says Michael to Castiel, and steps around him to return to the drawing room.

Before he can overthink it, he moves towards them, slow and deliberate.
Dean swallows. ‘I know.’
‘Oh,’ he says. He tries to think of a flirtation he might offer in return. ‘Well. It wouldn’t be hard for me either.’
Dean wants to scream at him. ‘What the fuck kind of-’
‘Didn’t mean it as an insult. Did you put anything on your face, yesterday?’ She hands him a cup of coffee and doesn’t wait for him to answer. ‘There’s vinegar in the larder; I’ll mix some up with water and make a cold compress.’

Michael wins Dodge City by a decent margin.
He jerks his chin up to look at her, and he knows,

’ that he freezes, still holding her down.
He’s supposed to walk through the house half-naked? Smelling like this?
‘I would like to speak on behalf of my husband,’ she proposes, her voice brisk and professional. ‘As always, we are gathered here again this year to honour him and his work, and give our thanks on behalf of the family for our status and achievements. Despite his physical absence, we have much to be grateful for in his guidance to us, and to my eldest sons; we know that the work we do in the private and political spheres is with his blessing, and in accordance with his teachings.’
If anything, Dean looks more suspicious, like he’s about to start arguing the opposite. It’s very odd, and not a little exhausting. Castiel makes the executive decision to turn back to his own letter, and let Dean wrestle with that himself.
It's not late, when he wakes up - the sun is just starting to get low, ducking beneath the frame of his bedroom window and casting long shadows across the far wall - but the house is quiet. Dean twitches where he lies, face pressed deep into the flat pillow, letting himself feel the burn in his ass without trying to move or respond to it. When he finally lifts his head, the first thing he notices is the pitcher of fresh water that has been placed on the dresser by the wash basin, and the little ceramic jar of arnica. He doesn’t remember Cas putting them there, but it’s something.
Sorry for the lack of the usual Friday post - I was at the wedding of one of my oldest friends. Normal service resumes here!
Dean gets a couple of steps ahead up the staircase and snatches another gulp from the bottle, and Cas wraps his hand around the back of Dean’s thigh and
Castiel does not know when it happened, but Dean is kneeling besides his chair now, one hand on Castiel’s knee - the knee is shaking a little, Castiel notes with detachment, jogging compulsively - and one on the edge of the seat. His eyes are wide, his face still flushed from the warmth of the room, his lashes long and dark.
‘We are blessed, as a family, with the superior breeding and intellect that gives us authority over lesser men and women; we are blessed with our true and appropriate roles of alpha and omega, that teach us where we belong in society; as such we have a responsibility to guide those lesser creatures, and to educate them where we must.’ It sounds as though this speech is going to be a long one. Castiel wishes he had more coffee, and glances around for Dean to pour it.
Dean has missed him so fucking much.
‘No…’ says Castiel, cautiously.
He pauses.
It’s just that he doesn’t want Cas to do it. That’s all.
He had said that. He’s not sure why he needs a lawyer for it.
Dean exhales. His voice becomes more confident, just a little. ‘Okay, yeah. Close your eyes. You gonna close your eyes?’
‘What?’ says Castiel.
His brother rolls his eyes, exaggeratedly. ‘I’ve been sent to spy, what do you think?’
Both the woman and Castiel turn to look at him at the same time, mid-conversation, and Dean realises why he’s here, stuffed into Castiel’s nice clothes, his face still bruised. He’s an example, or something; a fallen sinner still bearing the marks of his suffering, to whom Castiel has extended the hand of charity and forgiveness, and now he’s sitting here in a church with his thumb up his ass so that Castiel can show off his good deed. The blonde woman isn’t even pretending not to stare at him, like she’s weighing him up, and in a moment of irritation he winks at her. She looks gratifyingly scandalised, and Dean hopes that’s the end of it, except that then another guy is joining the little group - a big guy, bald head, dark skin that looks slightly pitted with old acne scars - and the look that
‘Then God brings couples together to serve His purpose. Ruth and Boaz, Mary and Joseph. God creates us with his own intentions, he creates omega for alpha, two halves of a whole.’
Castiel has been uncharitable, in the past. The Milton house is more beautiful than he remembers it, rising like a great castle out of the beautifully maintained grounds - the manicured lawns lining the long driveway as the carriage draws up, and the glimpse of stables and kennel buildings further behind, the rose garden, the shadows behind the house that turn into woodland. It still doesn’t feel like home, but he’s never been sure how that’s supposed to feel, anyway.
‘I,’ says Castiel, feeling very far away. ‘Mother was just finishing her speech. You may wish to return to the drawing room.’
Cas groans as he drags himself upright and accepts the clothes Dean tosses towards him, but without any real feeling. All the same, the dawn light is spreading like water over the dusty earth by the time they’re picking their way across the yard and up to Bobby’s house, and when Dean lets himself in the side door there are already sounds of movement in the little kitchen - footsteps on the wooden boards, and the sound of someone messing around with the dented coffee tin. It makes his stomach feel strange: a sort of unfamiliar lightness he never dared believe he would get to feel again.
Balthazar waves a vague hand. ‘Come on, let me have this. A little bit of secret omega trafficking under cover of darkness. That counts.’
‘Cas,’ Dean says again. His voice makes Castiel ache. ‘Castiel. I know you’re in there. Tell me you can hear me, yeah? Just nod.’
Cas ducks away, messing around under the bed frame. ‘I thought you were supposed to - when I read about it, it said omegas liked to nest. There are spare clothes here, is that what you meant?’
He’s expecting an argument, or a snide comment at best; he’s not expecting Dean’s face to light up as he approaches the horses. He’s wearing his usual shirtsleeves and worn pants, but in concession to the late spring warmth he has rolled the sleeves to his elbows and foregone the vest, which Castiel isn’t sure would be appropriate if they had guests - or if he were a stricter master - but they don’t, and he isn’t. Castiel had assumed Dean could ride, based on the stories of his travelling lifestyle as a youth, but it hadn’t occurred to him that Dean might enjoy it, or that Dean might - as he is now - smooth a gentle, blunt-fingered hand across the neck of the black horse and croon, ‘Hello, sweetheart. Hello, gorgeous. What are you doing here?’
Lisa doesn’t back down, and Dean feels a rush of affection for her. ‘You know what I mean. Not paying back a contract someone else holds.’ Like Dean is. ‘I’d get paid money.’
Dean gives him the same long, hard look he wore last night. He wants to say, ‘Yeah, I’m not gonna do that,’ and he wants to make Castiel hit him in the mouth, but maybe some ounce of self-preservation still exists in his body, because he just drops his eyes.
‘You mean cause- I dunno.’ Dean shakes himself into something resembling coherence. ‘I dunno. There’s like - I don’t know if alphas have all the same stuff. I don’t know if I’d wanna do it without slick. It - when it’s hurt, in the past, it’s usually been - I was dry, you know? And there’s - I mean,’ he hesitates, like he’s trying to remember. Castiel’s thoughts catch, unbearably, on the thought that Dean has been hurt in this way, that people have done this to him against his will, and the need to provide comfort becomes overwhelming. ‘Like at first I don’t think it felt like much, just weird. But there’s like a, a spot on the inside? That feels real good. Maybe alphas don’t have that the same, I dunno.’
‘Does he have - any belongings?’ asks Castiel, faintly.
(See the end of the chapter for
The lock clicks. With whatever scraps of coherent thought Dean’s got left, he tries to cover himself with the sheet, shivering. The last thing he needs is Cas taking one look at his exposed body and having another breakdown. He scrabbles back a little bit, back onto the narrow bed, so Cas has space to let himself into the little room. Dean only has one candle lit - there’s no other light source, and although it’s probably a waste to leave it lit, it felt like darkness would just make him feel lonelier. It means he can see the way Cas’ face changes as the full scent hits him - the way his eyes go wider, the birdlike tilt of his head, the way he wets his lower lip with his tongue like he’s not aware he’s doing it - in golden light and deep, carved out shadow, his expression flickering in the candlelight - and that’s fine, that’s fine by Dean, because Cas smells like a fucking forest fire right now and it sends slick pulsing out of him almost immediately.
‘That’s the opposite of what I meant.’
Well, now he has. ‘We haven’t been formally introduced.’
‘The Lord made the first omega for the first alpha. ‘
‘They didn’t make me listen to the
Dean just stands there.
‘I want you to leave,’ says Castiel.
‘Thank you for your work today,’ says Castiel, on the way back to the house, and Dean is so taken aback that he almost stops walking.
Cas’ scent goes smokier at the words. Dean wants to inhale it so fucking bad. He wants to breathe it for hours.
‘I’m trying to atone. I’m trying to get my
He - he’d been ready for it, he thought, but now that logic is gone, far beyond his reach. This man wants to touch him, and it will be the death of them, and he - he’s frozen, allowing himself to be yanked down, allowing it because if he fights it will mean acknowledging that he is here, that this is happening-
‘No, I,’ he swallows. ‘I don’t know why he brought
Jody smacks him on the arm again, although this time it’s less plausibly an accident. ‘I was worried for you.’
Okay, well that’s different. ‘Right this way, Mr. Barnum.’
‘Sorry-’ Cas gasps almost immediately, as Dean bites out, ‘Shit. Shit!’
Another sharp nod. ‘I’ll meet you downstairs in a few minutes.’
‘Sit down, please, Castiel,’ she says.
There’s a too-long beat.
Without being told, the Overseers release their grip on the man on the floor and step back. For a moment the man doesn’t move, but Castiel can hear him panting, see the way his muscles twitch beneath his wet institution uniform. A moment more, and with no small effort the man shifts, pushes himself up to his knees, eyes darting wildly, and when it looks as though he might make another break for it Castiel’s hand snaps out and catches him by the shoulder instinctively, lets his fingers dig in, holding him still.
‘I could not go against God’s will,’ he says, his voice cracking. ‘I could not.’
Nobody is coming after them. Not yet. For a moment, infinity stretches before them, as endless as the night.
’ and not, ‘
Cas frowns. ‘I’m not going to send you back to the Refuge.’
‘I couldn’t see anything.’
‘I’m not going to lie to you, Dean,’ says Castiel, very seriously, ‘I’m probably not going to wash these blankets myself.’
be worth the price of admittance. And you’ve never had an omega to bring, it’ll take some of the heat off me.’ He licks the batter off his finger. Castiel looks aggrieved.
‘I don’t-’

Dean stares back at him, mouth pressed shut.
‘It’s bad?’
‘Six one,’ says Dean.
'My message,’ Cas echoes.
The horse fidgets slightly on the spot, bumping his shoulder with its nose. Dean laughs very softly, reaching out towards the chestnut, which is turning its head to inspect him.
It’s the same man. It’s the same man he-
‘Hello,’ says Castiel to his family, awkwardly.
SEPTEMBER 1st 1890, CASE NOTES: PATIENT 401.
‘Sir?’
‘In case you wanted to know that,’ says Dean.
JULY 28th 1890, CASE NOTES: PATIENT 401.
‘Yes-’ His shoulders are shaking. He’s a coward. He’s a fucking coward. ‘Yeah, yes, okay, fine. The answer’s yes. Cas and I fucked. We - he fucked me-’
. It wasn’t - Cas didn’t-’
She doesn’t really nod, just raises her chin once and lets it fall again. ‘I’m aware. I’m actually here to see you.’
She snorts. ‘Not in his right mind. Although he very rarely is. If you’ll join me downstairs again?’
He almost says, ‘Dean,’ a second time, except that then he realises who the other person is.
Chapter specific content warnings at the bottom of the page.
‘What?’ says Dean.
Now he does turn to meet her eyes.
Somewhere under all the white noise in his brain Dean knows this is probably right, but it’s not anything he’s ever had the luxury of acknowledging. If he were a nice omega gentlewoman, lying there with his legs open for an alpha mate, ready to give him all the heirs and spares he could ever ask for, maybe Dean would get a pretty little nest of cushions and blankets and little monogrammed towels to pat his forehead with. It’s not a world he’s ever lived in. It seems an odd thing for Cas to get caught up on, but Cas is an odd guy; that’s all irrelevant next to the fact that he’s here.
Castiel isn’t supposed to talk about Dean. This might be a trick.
‘Right. Thanks.’ By this point he’s relatively sure the alpha won’t pick up on the sarcasm. ‘You still wanna make me pray?’
to go back, that’s the thing. It’s just that he wants to scrub out that complicated part of his history, the part where he walked out of the chapel and into the open country mid-sermon, the part where faith was not enough to find his own soul worthy. Castiel’s faith has always been precise, unwavering, straightforward. He had thought it the strongest thing in the world, until it wasn’t, until it was like trying to hold water in his cupped hands.
Mrs. Allen flushes a little. ‘I’ll admit that I try to take an active role, as Christ calls us to. I’m sure it must seem very little to you, Mr. Milton.’
‘You wanted to warn me.’
‘Then there won’t be any signs of it, when the doc takes a look at you.’
‘Cas,’ Dean says, pitching his voice low and soothing. ‘Come on. You wanna leave this for the night now?’
He is hardly looking for an argument, anyway. If anything, he is arming himself against an argument.
He expects Cas to argue, or linger, or say something else snide, but he doesn’t. He just leaves.
Michael's real-world equivalent here is I guess Lyman U. Humphrey, 8th governor of Kansas, who ran as a Republican in 1888 and was succesfully elected. He was a strict enforcer of Kansas' prohibition laws and was re-elected in 1890, beating out Democratic, Prohibition, and People's Party candidates (he also ran for the US House of Representatives in 1892, but was defeated by the Populist candidate then). Yes, I fell into a research wormhole, because I was trying to figure out the state of 1890s Kansas politics, but I do in fact live in modern day Wales, and I don't even know what half the words mean in your complicated-ass political system. Very tiring. Why have I done this to myself. Just wanted to make some repressed boys kiss and now I'm out here learning about Lyman U. Humphrey, 1844-1915.
It means he’s busy throughout the afternoon, and getting busier as the evening draws in.
‘He’s sending you away?’ she says, curiously, distracted.
That is, he could say any or all of those things, but he already knows how Dean would react: poorly, or dismissively, or flippantly, or disbelieving. Dean does not like it when Castiel answers questions earnestly, even if he is the person who asked them in the first place.
‘I haven’t led him anywhere.’
‘I said,’ he says, ‘don’t make me repeat myself again.’
‘Not - personally.’

Before Dean realises it’s about to happen, Gabriel snakes out a hand and swats him, mock-playfully, on the ass, and Dean
‘It’s - fine.’ He watches Dean lay slabs of yesterday’s bread in the skillet, and drops his voice again. ‘It’s just - Jess and I spoke about it when you wrote, and - I know this thing with Castiel isn’t exactly traditional, but we don’t want you to think you don’t have alternatives now, alright? If you wanted me to be your legal alpha, and you wanted to come back to California when I leave, that’s - we could do that, Dean. Whatever you wanted.’
He confirms that he has ‘never had occasion’ to undertake a love-affair with a member of the opposite sex, nor has he frequented brothels or otherwise had the opportunity for sexual congress with a woman; he cites his dedication to his religious and moral beliefs as the primary reason for such. He exhibits a deep fear of disappointing or bringing shame to his family and expresses that his shame in his unnatural state is so great that he wishes he were dead, to prevent scandal befalling his family.
Can’t steal what you’re given, that’s what Bobby used to say, although he sure as hell wasn’t thinking of this context. Dean would do it. He’d do it after today, after Cas took him out here, after all the awkward kindnesses. He wouldn’t even mind. He’d let Cas do whatever, and it would be the best fucking trade off Dean’s ever made, in exchange for all of this. He’d make it real good, and then Cas wouldn’t get rid of him. Cas might keep him around.
, makes him want to vomit.
‘I won’t. Unless you really have it coming.’
Jesus.
God, he likes Anna so much.
‘Not for Catholics,’ Balthazar advises. ‘That’s sort of a one-and-done situation. Otherwise,’ he shrugs, ‘more or less. Might have to fake your death and leave town to do it-’
The building swiftly becomes less pleasant as Castiel follows the Matron out of the receiving area. Beyond a set of heavy double doors the wood panelling disappears, to be replaced with starkly painted walls; enough like a hospital for the hairs on the back of his neck to prickle. Doors line one side of the corridor, and when he glances sideways through one he sees something approaching a schoolroom, cluttered with too many desks, and perhaps five or six gaunt omega women hunched over slates and bibles in silence. They must feel the weight of his eyes upon them, glancing briefly up at him before doubling down again. He wonders if they even wish to return to society, to employment, or if the institution is all they know now.
‘He only usually wants toast and marmalade in the morning,’ she says, like maybe that’s the problem. ‘I sometimes bring ‘round biscuits if I’ve been baking. And if he’s visiting people in the town they’ll often keep him for dinner, so you shouldn’t have to prepare a big meal every day.’
‘And you believe you could successfully consummate such a marriage?’
‘Possibly.’
‘No, I know,’ says Sam placatingly. ‘But if your guardianship’s in the family-’
‘Yeah, no,’ he says, trying to remember how to form words. ‘Sorry. Sorry, I know. You said-’
wrong for the season - with the tails of it billowing like wings in the draught from the open door as he turns, it’s like seeing him for the first time again.

‘Cause you think
He doesn’t remember. He won’t remember. ‘He’s no longer my concern,’ Castiel repeats, trying to speak clearly. He’s relatively confident that conversations aren’t supposed to continue once one party has said ‘goodbye’. He tries again, just in case, and adds a genial smile. ‘Goodbye.’
Castiel doesn’t say anything, but Dean squints woozily into the darkness as he presses a kiss to his temple, as soft as he can.
He realises a lot of things at once.
It is cooler out here, a little darker, although there are still gas lamps placed at regular intervals on the sideboards along the wall. Castiel tries not to sniff for Dean - he’s not an animal - but it’s a difficult instinct to resist, and anxiety is spreading cold through his veins; when he sees a servant attending to the lamps a little way up the hallway, he quickens his step.
By the time he’s done, it can only be a couple of hours off dawn. He tips the bucket of water out in the yard, and goes to bed.
He works the day before his heat hits, although he knows he’s on edge. The betas can’t smell it on him like an alpha could, but they pick up on the prickliness of his mood, and the way his uniform itches as he overheats. Edgar’s eased up on him a little recently; he takes Dean’s place for dinner service without being asked, so Dean’s just carrying dishes up and down the back stairs and doesn’t have to see any of the family. By morning the fever hasn’t hit yet but he’s still no use to anyone, so he gets a long morning in bed - which is kind of amazing, at least until the sweating and shivering gets too bad.
to win, and then half of them have to revoke that later in the week when the final counts are finished (he chuckles as he explains this to Dean three or four times, mostly because Dean is the only person of a low enough rank to have to listen to him and cannot physically leave).
Patient engaged in regular electrical stimulation and aversion therapy as usual: for the first time since the photographic plate was provided by the Patient’s mother, images were included of the omega male with whom the Patient imagines himself bonded. The Patient reacted most violently and was further restrained with a harness.
Castiel keeps his expression neutral, but he places the little book on the nightstand and picks up the tray, then moves to let himself out. ‘Goodnight, Dean.’
‘Your scent and your belongings were-’
It is Tuesday evening, and Cas is expecting his rut to hit Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. Dean has gathered this much, although Cas still insists on euphemistically calling it his ‘season’, as if Dean’s omega honour will be sullied if he hears the word ‘rut’: he’s way,
Castiel exhales.
‘Castiel? Not at the moment.’ She props her hands on her hips. ‘He tell you he’s a pastor?’
He squints at her.
Dean snorts. Sighs. ‘Get in the fucking bed, Cas.’ He waits until Castiel is moving then adds, ‘You’re better today.’
‘Yes, I am,’ says Castiel, flat and clear.
Gabriel has been thumbing through a worn bible, distracted; now he starts so obviously that he almost drops it. ‘Wait, he’s - what? You’ve got to be joking.’
They’re just words. They’re just words, of course, and words don’t mean much, words come cheap and don’t hold anyone to anything. But all the same, Cas is right there, and his hands are still on Dean’s shoulders, and the initial shock of fear and adrenaline is wearing off, and before Dean can think he just - he just drops his head forward, so that his forehead is resting against Cas’ shoulder, and lets him take his weight. And Cas does; right there in the middle of the road, beneath the beating sun, the two horses waiting patiently beside them.
‘Well it’s - they bring me food and stuff during the day. But they mostly leave me alone at night.’
He says nothing. Concentrates on being nothing: a cardboard cutout of a person. This isn’t real.
‘Your family has requested you hand over the contract of guardianship for an omega male to your elder brother,’ says Crowley, sounding bored. ‘You’re currently paying off a debt to St. Mary’s Refuge for the Fallen Omega on his behalf in exchange for his servitude for a minimum of three years - your family have paid this bill in lieu of yourself while you’ve been - indisposed - for the last couple of months,’ he gives a toothy sort of smile that suggests he knows where Castiel has been. Castiel frowns. ‘However your mother says you’ve previously expressed verbal agreement to the idea of passing guardianship of the omega over to your brother, and he is happy to move ahead with that today.’
. ‘But not tonight.’
‘If you’re mentally fit.’
‘What?’
‘I’d like to take him,’ says Castiel, clearer. It’s not a question. ‘I believe I can employ him - make use of him - give him some purpose.’ He turns to face the Matron. ‘Miss McKellan, I appreciate your hesitation, but you must understand - God has called me to this work.’
‘It’s just that the house is part of the church estate, isn’t it? You live there as part of your responsibilities, in your role as a pastor. But if you’re not the pastor…’
He snorts.
The first offence on the list is
It was his design.’
The newspaper guy says loudly into Dean’s ear, ‘A few thousand more and they can probably call it.’
‘Alright,’ he says, and leans back to lie against the warm grass.
, he’s still holding onto one of Dean’s hands and he’s- ‘So
‘Or,’ says Anna, ‘if they’d been occupied with something else important. If the phone line had been busy, perhaps, or they had other things going on. If I’d picked the right moment.’
‘Then you understand there is no redemption possible for such creatures.’
It’s not a sexual dream, so it’s okay. When he wakes up, his cock is soft between his thighs - it’s the first thing he’s aware of, straight away, the horrifying fear that his body might have reacted, that they’ll have to take him back to the hospital and begin it all again. He thinks he might die if they begin it all again.
Dean makes a vague, wordless noise that is neither agreement nor disagreement and flops onto his back, forgetting his nakedness.
‘It’s too late for hygiene.’
Thirdly… thirdly, Dean knows he should wake Cas and let him know there’s someone outside. But that would involve going into the bedroom of an alpha whose rut is less than 24 hours away, alone, and trying to wake him. Dean’s not stupid.
It’s useless to try and talk to him; Dean spins on his heel to go back into the hall, dodging around a maid with a tray of canapes and drinks and then changing his mind and going over to relieve her of it, so he can take it to Michael directly. There is an itch under his skin, something tight and trembling - Michael is pacing back and forth now, stalking along the far end of the table like a lion, and even in the hubbub his scent is overpowering; it turns Dean’s mouth dry, makes the old need to submit kick back in, makes him a stupid, cowering slave to instinct. Not for the first time, he thinks about how much he hates being
‘Uh,’ says Dean. ‘I don’t think I take orders from anyone dressed like P.T. Barnum.’
‘My brother,’ says Michael, and this time Dean almost closes his eyes against the accusation. ‘He came up to spend your heat with you, didn’t he? We know what he’s done to you.’
‘I-’ says Cas. ‘I assume that you’re here because - because you’re willing to help.’
‘Mrs. Allen is visiting for-’ his mother starts to say, just as Castiel says, ‘Please, I go by Novak in the community-’ and she cuts herself off, looking slightly disapproving.
‘Well - yes. I thought - you’re coming with me.’

He holds that thought in his head as the carriage sways along the road, then folds it up tightly, and puts it away.
like the words are the most natural thing in the world. Castiel dismounts, hands over his own reins so Dean can lead the chestnut over to a patch of shade, then wipes his dusty palms against the thighs of his pants.
Dean ignores him. He has not tasted whiskey in years. The bottle feels right in his hand. The glasses are still set out on the table; he ignores those too, cracking the lid.
‘Yeah, you did,’ says Dean.
So, by the time the alpha does show up later in the afternoon, Dean and Jody are both standing halfway inside the larder while she talks him through its - meagre - contents, and Dean tries to figure out what the hell he’s supposed to offer Castiel for supper (and whatever the congregation member or whoever gave him dinner provided, it better have been something good, like roast-mutton-and-potatoes and fruit-pie good, because if the alpha comes home hungry Dean doesn’t know what he’s gonna do).
‘You’re putting me off.’
Castiel, at last, drops his hand. ‘I don’t believe that’s true.’
‘Go into the kitchen,’ says Castiel. ‘Go into the kitchen and - bend over the table.’
Cas gets that stubborn, impassive look on his face. ‘I haven’t
Dean doesn’t panic, but it’s a close call. He yanks, too hard, on the reins; the horse stops dead in the middle of the trail and Castiel reacts a couple of seconds slower, wheeling his own chestnut around awkwardly.
It’s so good that it takes him way too long to realise that Cas’ face is pressed into his neck, and it’s damp, like he’s weeping.
‘We can steal one,’ pants Cas, who rebelled like one time and has now apparently committed to it. ‘We can-’
Cas makes a faintly scandalised noise as Dean reaches a hand down and presses his fingers inside himself like he's been knotted, but they’re only his usual scandalised noises. Not the new ones, the scared ones. Maybe it’s hard for even Cas to be scared when there’s an omega huddled - okay, cuddled - into his neck, babbling needy inanities, and Cas can’t even really see what he’s doing. Dean presses deeper into himself, scent drunk and sloppy - even during his heat his dick can’t recover fast enough, but this works, this feels good. He’s already too open from earlier: another finger feels better. God, he’s losing his mind.
He wishes he had something to occupy his hands. He concentrates on holding them very still, instead. ‘What?’
Dean-
Here is Phillips Avenue in Sioux Falls, circa 1890: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/c6/bd/c6c6bd929643ac2e1ae59b45d02f06f5.jpg
Castiel flinches.
A small pause.

‘Lift your hips up.’
He cannot say:
The British guy actually whistles. ‘Talk about selling sins to saints.’
There’s a very slight sound of movement as they head into the kitchen, and the pantry door bounces slightly. From behind the little group, Castiel says, ‘Lisa, you - you can come out.’
‘No,’ Dean says. ‘No, no. You tell him - tell him to fuckin’ eat me.’ His fists are clenched tight at his side; he is still making those unbalanced, abortive movements, as if he is trying to turn away and keeps getting pulled back. ‘It’s made-up, Cas. It’s a made-up thing they tell little kids, it’s not real. I don’t know what he did to me. I don’t know, maybe he drugged me, maybe he drugged me and I didn’t know, but I’m not
“Look, I’m sorry it didn’t work out with you and Eileen, but—”
Perhaps that isn’t fair. All angels have known each other since the creation of angels, which stopped when God left.
“That’s, well, that’s Castiel.”
“I thought you wanted—”
“It’s true,” Sam said, earnest eyes on display. “He went seven times to the coven in supplication, and they made it worse each time.”
The hunter thought about it, truly struggling to come up with something funny, something OK, something that would end this nightmare before he lost his mind. In a sort of daze, he reached over, grabbed Castiel’s left hand, and then brought it to his lips with a bow.
Nothing.
Castiel nodded.
“That we were to obey.”
“Every detail.”
“Why?”
Castiel nodded, looking both eager and uncomfortable. “Exactly. My wing. They’re a clue, actually.”
“No.”
“I believe it’s time that everyone who sleeps goes to bed,” Cass said, putting his hand back on Jack’s shoulder to turn him around and shove him out of the room. “Alone.” The angel then followed Jack. Dean and Sam looked at each other for a moment before Dean seemed to realize he was the one in the wrong room. Without a word, he turned and left, closing the door quietly behind him.
“He didn’t hate you.”
Too old.
He/Cass turned to Sam, who looked devastated.
“Yes, absolutely.” Sam let himself smile. “But Dean and Cass, you’ve noticed, maybe, they’re a little extra close? They share something that’s just them?”
He played a piece for battle and then another for peace. He played a celebration of spring and then another for winter. He played an ode to the sun and then another to the moon.
“Did you lose your soul again?”
“Yes.” Cass nodded.
, he thought with disgust as he sat up. They’d been after some witches.
“Fuck me, Cass,” he whispered. “God, fuck me.”
“What’s a Samulet?”
Idiotic in the extreme. It’s painful now to contemplate it.
“I don’t need claiming.”
“They look like you and Dean,” Cass says, looking through the phone’s horrific stash. “Except these two men are obviously romantically involved.”
“And you’re not actually a guy.”
“Why did you do it?”
“You’re talking about when you’re celestial wavelengths, right? No wings, no feathers.”
,” Sam said, taking a bottle from his brother.
Dean shook his head and shoved the last of his dry burger in his mouth.
The clerk, a female omega herself, had smiled (impersonally, thank God) at him when she saw him tick the box for heat privacy and gave him some prepared spiel about soundproofing and the red button on the phone if he found himself in distress. He had to sign the waver about not letting his family sue if he died in his room, and then he was good to go, a complimentary water bottle in his hand and over his shoulder a duffle bag holding his second pair of jeans, two t-shirts, three pairs of socks, his wallet, a knife, and a gun.
‘I’ll get it dirty,’ he mumbles, without moving. Castiel ignores him. ‘Cas. I will. I’m lying in a wet patch the size of California. Don’t fuck up your blankets.’
The immediate instinct is to make fun of him - some little jab at Sam’s expense - but when Dean looks up, his brother’s face is so earnest and concerned that the barb dies on his tongue. Instead, Dean sets the skillet down and raises his voice. ‘Cas!’
‘No,’ says Castiel, ‘it isn’t. And it’s - it’s about - moral decency. For both of us.’
‘It still isn’t proper,’ his mother says. ‘I’m glad to see you with a hobby, Castiel, but you must know you’re on thin ice.’
‘Yes,’ he says, primly. ‘They eat through inserting their beaks into the ground to make a hole, so they can get at underground insects and bugs. It’s called “gaping”.’
‘You should probably turn away,’ he says.
Cas’ face goes strange at the words. Maybe he doesn’t want to think about that stuff anymore. If he were Cas, he wouldn’t.
He hears it again, later, when he’s closing up the shutters. It’s not at the door this time, not like someone wants to come in; just gentle against the clapboard wall, enough to get his attention. Dean’s carrying nothing but a single candle, a little microcosm of light with him at the centre of it, and the rest of the world presses dark around the edges; if someone is out there, he hasn’t a hope of seeing them.
‘Wait,’ says Dean, struggling to sit up. ‘I’ll-’
means. It’s a term he’s seen in newspapers, only a handful of times, reporting lurid cases in the cities, designed to shock and appall their readership. It’s the term they used at the hospital, when they were trying to pry the truth of what had happened between him and Dean out of him: a
After his heat. There had been the very slightest whisper of heat scent lingering, under the steam and soap. Dean’s shoulders had been freckled; his back marked with old scars in various shapes and sizes - some of them strikingly vicious - and when he had stretched his arms the muscles under the skin had shifted with him.

Dean thinks about Wichita.
Gabe’s face does something interesting. ‘Should I have?’
Cas, come on.’
‘I’m going to,’ Castiel says, fixing his eyes at some point over Dean’s shoulder, ‘to - I’ve prepared a room for you, upstairs. I think it would be better for you to stay there this afternoon. I have work to do, in my office. Perhaps a rest will help, I think. For you to adjust.’ His chest feels tight, like the air is grating against his lungs. ‘I can bring you some food.’
Dean is under Michael’s eye tonight, and will be for the next few hours as further results come in, at least until the lead grows big enough to call the race for the night - and that assuming it does, and this doesn’t get dragged out for days while the final counties finish their counts. Cas hadn’t actually
Dean has sat down on the shore, and is pulling his boots off. Castiel closes his eyes against the water and does another lap.
Someone tugs harder at the blanket, yanking it out of his hands, and then makes a revolted noise. Dean scrambles for the second one, the one Cas laid out underneath him to keep him out of the wet patches, but that gets jerked away too, and okay, okay, he’s awake. He pushes himself upright, aggrieved.
Castiel is not fluent in Dean speak, but he’s pretty sure pointing this out would not be welcome. ‘I’d like you to,’ he decides on, instead. ‘It’s - it can be pleasant to have another person in the room, while one is working.’ It’s not a lie. It’s never been pleasant for Castiel, but he’s heard that it
It’s enough.

‘I live in Missouri, technically,’ Balthazar explains. ‘The other side of Kansas City. Not so far on the railroad, but far enough to make it difficult to track you, if you’re out of state.’
‘Michael,’ he says, and Michael looks up from Dean’s throat and says, ‘Brother.’
Dean presses his nail against the burnt patch, and the whole thing lifts off like a scab, unexpectedly. ‘Maybe he’s better than most people,’ he says, without looking up.
Dean thinks immediately, compulsively, of Cas.
God, the last time he saw Sam he was little more than a kid, not long presented and desperate to take off and make something of himself. For Dean’s money, he’s succeeded: a lawyer now, all mated off to a beautiful alpha girl back in California, and - for the record - about nine foot tall and the size of a fucking house. It had been strange the first time they’d seen each other, Sammy suddenly a grown man instead of the baby-faced memory Dean had been clinging onto for so many years, and Sam being an alpha hadn’t really helped - it made his scent seem more intense, the muddle of joy and grief and flaring possessiveness that in turn had set off Dean’s own weird panic, and then there had been this horrible period in which Sam had been so transparently
‘Do whatever you want.’
‘I think it would be a bad idea,’ he says, carefully.
‘You’re a terrible spy,’ he adds.
Dean freezes, clutching a jug of buttermilk, like an idiot.
‘And then you can serve breakfast,’ says Jody, pleasantly, and Dean does a double take.
‘That’s different,’ says Castiel, although he’s not sure why it’s different.
‘You’ve got an asshole,’ Dean points out, blearily. ‘Give it a go.’
got weird about it and stood there for way too long, just staring, repeating the opening words, ‘Bobby, it’s Dean. Been in Hell,’ quietly to himself.
Castiel frowns. ‘What?’
Stupidly, hysterically, Dean thinks,
Additional development: the Patient is developing a positive relationship with a female (alpha) nurse, an excellent sign of a progressing affinity for women. He appears more willing to speak openly outside of formal consultations, and may yet provide further insight into his extreme mental state when initially admitted.
Male servants were more expensive than female servants in the 19th century, as they were paid higher wages and - eventually - there was indeed a luxury tax on them that made them less common but a sign of greater social prestige. I translated this to secondary gender rather than primary.
Cas isn’t there the next day, either.
‘Not even for saying ‘fuck’?’
Dean stares at him. Castiel waits for him to answer, but he doesn’t.
Castiel stares despondently into the gingerbread pan. ‘I didn’t - I hadn’t planned, specifically.’
She steers him through the door. ‘We’ll sort that out, too. Jody Mills.’
‘I think it could help you. You have been lost, Dean, without guidance - this is God’s word.’ He edges a little closer, offering it cautiously, as if approaching a wild animal. ‘You have suffered, Dean, needlessly, and - and you don’t have to suffer any longer.’
‘Leave it, I’ll fry the bread in the bacon grease.’
A couple of people are here praying, though. He watches Castiel from beneath his eyelashes: sitting on a front pew beside a blonde alpha woman in a well-tailored walking suit, talking quietly. He wonders if they also find him off-putting, or if they can overlook that for the whole pastor thing. Maybe they’re used to him. Maybe everyone else here is also weird and off-putting and way too intense.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘He’s,’ says Cas, looking like it physically pains him to say so, ‘a good man. I’m afraid. Not in - not in the way that - but I think. Still a good man.’ He hesitates.
Castiel hesitates.
‘There’s two of them.’
He lets Dean take care of the horses, though, when they arrive at the lake. There is an upside down triangle of sweat between his shoulder blades, and his hair is ruffled when he removes his hat, but his teeth flash white in his dirty face as he pets the black mare, murmuring compliments and gratitude, calling her
There’s barely any moonlight, but he can make out the darkness of her hair, her eyes. ‘Get off me.’
for Dean, like he was some tragic little omega morality tale. The only mercy there had been that Bobby had already talked Sam through the worst of it, so Dean hadn’t had to retread all that ground over again. Even so, Sam had got tearful as he looked over that first telegram Dean had managed to send to Bobby, and then Cas had gotten up to inspect it for the first time and
‘Oh my God,’ says Gabriel. ‘You’re so annoying now that you’re cracked.’
how keen I am to get him out from under my roof, believe me. Your brother is-’
Second hypnosis treatment for the Patient. First attempt at hypnosis on this occasion met with difficulties despite the best efforts of the physician, although was successful with the utilisation of Braid’s method paired with a little chloroform. Following this, the session proceeded as normal.
‘-Symptoms such as those found in men who have committed unnatural crimes. Through a physical inspection, we can confirm the actions of the younger Mr. Milton, and your own part in that.’
‘Bossy.’ He lifts his hips; Castiel sort of shuffles the second blanket beneath him. Dean’s grumpy expression of protest doesn’t change, but the little sigh that escapes him betrays his satisfaction. He nestles down a little. ‘It’s gonna get fucked up.’
In conversation with the Patient’s mother, she confirms the omega male is still in the employ of the extended family, and that his guardianship is due to be assumed by the Patient’s brother. She agrees strongly that the Patient is not to be exposed to this omega again, and that interaction with other male omegas in the future is to be avoided wherever possible.
There’s a short pause. ‘Are you sure you-’
‘You can teach a dog to pray,’ she adds, ‘but it still won’t go to Heaven.’
Dean doesn’t bother standing up for a while after that, although he’s not sure how long it is. Ordinarily this is when he’d want to sleep, all fucked-out and sated, but Cas has kind of killed that, like kicking dirt over a fire; instead he just stays down there on the ground, trying to decide whether or not he’s going to vomit.
‘Dean,’ he says.
‘What is this?’ Castiel growls.
,’ Dean repeats, half hysterical. ‘Oh my god, Cas, you’re a freak. Do it again.’
‘I should break your goddamn face,’ he says, but not like he’s about to. The line of his jaw is tight, almost painful. ‘That stunt you pulled. That fucking - you - what were you tryna do to me, Cas? What the fuck were you-’ he cuts himself off, breathing with an effort. ‘Why are you holding a chicken?’
Western Union basically monopolised the telegram industry in the second half of the 19th century. Here's a cute visual that I can't find a proper date for: https://ids.si.edu/ids/deliveryService?id=NMAH-AC0205-0000133
and lived to tell the tale, let alone when the alpha was trying to say- might have been saying- might have wanted to-
He feels Dean shift a little, behind him, and although it would not be proper to acknowledge him at this moment, it is slightly reassuring.
Castiel isn’t, but he remembers how much Gabriel likes jokes. He tries to think of one, to improve the atmosphere. ‘Which part of a fish,’ he suggests, ‘is like the end of a book?’
Today is different.
Castiel’s mind flinches around
He glances sideways, but before he can back up further Michael steps into his space, inhaling, and Castiel becomes suddenly, horribly aware of the fact that he has not yet washed this morning; that quite possibly Dean’s heat scent may still linger on him, and that if anyone could pick up on such a thing, it would be Dean’s true mate.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stares at her. ‘I am.’
‘I don’t-’
Cas looks prim. ‘I think it’s nice.’
‘Then answer the question.’ Michael sounds bored. ‘We know Castiel was in your room. We know your history. We simply need you to confirm aloud what happened between you.’
The house will stink, is what he means. The house will stink, same as for Dean’s heat, except this time instead of Cas on the other side of the door, praying to Jesus or whoever and being regularly scandalised by the muffled sounds of however Dean’s getting by, there will be a monster in his place. A stalking, stinking, hungry beast wearing Castiel’s face, and Dean will once again spend every waking moment waiting for the worst to happen.
he’d come with Dean, not in so many words, and although Dean had slipped back inside to resume his duties with a hot spark of hope in his belly, now he starts to second guess himself.
‘Twelve thousand, three hundred and four from Wichita-’
‘Alright,’ says the new guy. ‘Strip him, then.’
‘Okay,’ says Dean. Is he supposed to apologise?
Despite the high neck of her gown, he can almost make out the shadow of an old mating scar beneath the fine lace and net. He has supported several members of his parish through the death of a mate before - there are a handful of elderly widows in the community, and one or two widowers - but rarely if ever so young. He cannot help the pulse of sympathy that goes through him.
Sam is still in his nightshirt, sorting through the shelves in search of the least chipped cups available to him. When he sees his brother, he beams - a big, dumb, familiar grin, like the sun breaking across the sky.
‘Oh, good,’ says Jody. ‘Castiel, can I talk to you?’
The first ~official Kansas State Fair didn't actually take place until 1901 and was in Hutchinson (aka, way too far to go for a day trip before cars were invented), so this... isn't that. However the first fair association was made in 1873 when the Reno County Agricultural Society was created, and there were precursors to the state fair taking place in Topeka and Wichita during the 19th century. This 1904 ad is for Topeka! https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Kansas_State_Fair_Official_Advertising.jpg/1024px-Kansas_State_Fair_Official_Advertising.jpg
‘Would anyone care for a refreshment?’ Anna suggests. ‘I’ll ring the bell.’
The popular story of cornflakes being invented by  Kellogg as an anti-masturbatory device is mostly false - they were never actually advertised as such - but Kellogg, among others, did endorse The World's Blandest Diet to chase away Spicy Thoughts, so you can see where Cas' oatmeal logic has come from here.
’ he snarls, again, fighting the way his instincts beg to submit to Michael, letting them make him angrier.
‘Dean?’ he says softly, outside the bedroom door, and then lets himself in when there is no response.
The shadows are getting long; he can see his own silhouette stretched and distorted on the uneven dirt in front of him. He twists the stick a little more, scratching at the earth, then tries cautiously to pet one of the chickens - Maude, he decides - but she flattens herself to the ground when he stretches out his hand, and he’s not sure whether that’s a good thing or not. He gives it a couple more minutes for the hens to get used to him - strokes the strange, bouncy surface of Bertha’s feathers a few times, which she allows - before he tries to pick her up, holding her wings against her sides.
Patient complained of continuing nausea. Mental state remains deeply melancholic.
He hesitates.
‘No, there isn’t.’
‘I’m heading home,’ Jody interjects. ‘Got mouths to feed.’
‘We will continue with the hypnosis treatment,’ agrees the alienist smoothly, and Castiel exhales with relief.
The carriage turns onto the long driveway, and Castiel stares ahead at the house, illuminated by arching gas lamps even though the sun is not yet fully set. There are already several carriages outside, shining horses shifting restless on the spot as guests make their way up to the house: Castiel can see the a tall, silhouetted figure that must be Michael, with his wife on his arm and - as ever - three exceptionally beautiful omegas following in his wake with their heads bowed. Michael has always been a  collector.
‘Don’t hurt him,’ he says, pointlessly. ‘I’ll do - whatever, I’ll do whatever. Don’t hurt him.’
‘Hit me,’ he gasps out, before he can think. ‘Please hit me.’
‘Shh.’
Castiel feels himself frozen at the perimeter of the room, staring. The brunette omega is screaming now, as the man throws a messy punch, twisting free of the Overseer who was trying to restrain his wrists. He sees the Matron swoop ahead into the hall, but he must miss some crucial intermediary moment, because then she has picked up one of the abandoned buckets and thrown the whole thing directly over the fighting man and he is gasping as if punched in the gut, soaked and feral, teeth bared, and then the Overseer kicks hard at the back of his knees and the man goes down.
the Temperance movement.’
The first time, Dean’s sweeping the hearth in the dining room, and he only just hears it; he’s heading through to the kitchen with a dustpan full of cinders to bank the kitchen fire, and dumps them quickly in order to wipe his hands on his pants and answer it. It’s only once the door is open and he’s staring out at the still, empty night, that he realises how odd it is. Castiel’s guests do not knock at the back door. Jody certainly wouldn’t - she would let herself in, same as always. He stands there for a minute all the same, hearing nothing but the crickets and katydids, before he closes the door again.
“My apologies.”
had gone his heart.
Cass nodded.
The Men of Letters seemed to hate to throw things away, yet managed a truly impressive level of organization. Beyond the library and the annex with its dungeon, there were fifteen other rooms with shelf after shelf of newspapers, microfiche, newsreels, magazines, pamphlets, and Chuck Himself knew what else. Castiel figured he might make it through every last article in the bunker in a hundred years, but thinking about that sort of thing just reminded him that Sam and Dean would be dead long before a hundred years, so he had never made any sort of real plan.
Sam knew, if Castiel’s vessel were female, Dean would have been all over that about a dozen times, if not more. Damn, Sam might have . . . no, OK. He didn’t want to go there. Thinking about Castiel in whatever form really was like thinking about a sibling.
I searched for the “bromance” language I needed. “You said once I was a brother to you and Sam. I feel the same way about you.”
“And that’s why?”
Thertarmiel, wings spread wider than a galaxy, each feather’s point placed on the magnetic pole of a planet, suspended by the rolling swirl of gas giants and held aloft by the warm nurseries of nebulae. He’d held that mating display over the formation of amino acids, desperately proud to be everything his chosen angelic mate would ever want, love and hope etched out in each curl of his iridescent plumes.
And then he waited to think of a second entry to his list.
Dean snorted. And he was affecting Cass? “Great. That's freaking great.”
