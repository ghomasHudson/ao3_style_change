The guards allow him a change of clothes, which is greatly relieving.
All this, planned by Mycroft Holmes, with the help of a certain Inspector Lestrade.
“Right. Well, I am going to get him out of prison.”
They do not bring him back down to the electroshock chamber. They watch him quietly, seeing how he fares by himself. For the first time in his life, he forces himself to remain obedient.
He didn't pry further, or talk to John about “rough patches” or anything like that, instead seemingly entirely understanding. He didn't need John to justify his behavior just because it wasn't normal. He just assumed that whatever it was, John needed to do it.
John tapped his foot on the floor.
“The detective?” the girl says, speaking for the first time.
Mycroft brushes aside his gratitude, but Lestrade seems to be happy about it. Holmes is officially free—receiving time served in his appeal the following week.
“Here, my dear fellow,” a voice calls from behind them. It is Lestrade, and several more policemen. Watson lowers his revolver.
John nodded, and Violet returned to her duties.
“Sherlock, I want you to know—“ Watson leans closer to the bars, out of earshot of any of the other prisoners. “I love you.”
Maybe it was the fact that it was 3AM and he was not all there in the brain, or maybe it was just that he was curious—for whatever reason, John went with his gut and decided on following the man.
It had been a hassle—he had to show the nurses proof he was a medical practitioner to be able to enter, and he was sure they had no details regarding his relationship with Holmes.
That woman Irene, she'd seemed nice. She was attractive (dark hair, sharply dressed, lean and tall and regal) and very smart as well. She'd even said they might have some stuff in common. Maybe he'd ask Sherlock for her number.
At 3AM, John heard a truck start.
“May I ask what the nature of this little visit is?” he asks amiably.
Holmes gives it a drink of his water every day, deciding that nurturing it will be a helpful distraction. The small flower thrives under his careful care.
He is angry that he is so afraid, but he can feel his hands clam up and soon, they are trying to force him into the chair, and he finds himself fighting.
Thank you all for the lovely comments! I'll continue to update consistently!
“I had this guy come to stay at the motel,” John said, fidgeting with his arm. “He. . .well, I don't know. I don't like him. He asked for a specific room, 23A, he paid in cash, and he barely let me see his ID. Now he won't even let the maid come in to clean. Maybe I'm being stupid but. . .I dunno, I don't like it.”
Elijah puts an arm around Miss Carpenter as the guard goes over to Holmes. He backs away quickly.
He looked at stuff anyways. There was almost nothing personal here—no photographs or anything, just miscellaneous items. He was about to leave when he spotted something on a high shelf.
Labor circulates. When it is his turn, he follows a guard out of his cell and outside, where he is usually to move stones about. It is difficult because of the strength he lost to his fever, and he goes slowly. He knows if he were to collapse, they would not save him.
For two days, the man stayed in 23A. He did not come out, and refused room service. John had just hired a maid, and she didn't even have any work to do, for Danvers always turned her away and said it was better she didn't come back at all, really.
Suddenly, a photograph is in front of his face. His heart skips a beat. It's a photograph of John. How did they get it? Why do they have it?
Holmes looks at him with a grin.
The war ended a year later, and the town became more sour than ever. Those who had been planning to move to Southern Union to farm tobacco and cotton with promised free labor, now had no hope for their ideology.
He sat on the bed and tried not to cry.
Holmes wakes on the cot in his cell.
A bit startled, both men comply. Holmes has not seen the Inspector so shaken in a while, and it shocks him a bit. Something very grim indeed has happened. For a fleeting moment, he hopes perhaps it is just some outside tragedy the Yarder wants him to look into, but he can plainly see now from the tightened features of his face it is not so.
At the last line, John's stomach sank.
I wanted to delve more into Holmes's childhood here. The idea of him going to Catholic school as a boy had been in the back of my mind--the idea of the kind priest came to me only as I was writing :)
The night was still young when he left, so he decided a walk around town wouldn't be a bad idea.
He fears he may get sick if he is in here much longer. There is a rat eyeing him suspiciously.
John looked up at her, surprised.
“Thank you,” John said genuinely. “Smells great. Violet, why don't you put a pot of this on?”
Holmes wakes up to the yelling. He has slept for nearly an hour now, but dawn is cracking and Miss Carpenter's voice is shrill.
that has gradually started to peak between a crack in the cement floor. With the help of the scarce patch of sunlight from his window, it starts to grow.
“I survived this, and so will you.”
“Detective, you see, I think my brother has proven to be very useful to you, and I do believe you regret having to investigate him in the first place.”
John ended up on his laptop, deciding to go to the internet for answers. He found no record of an Isebelle Thorne for the date on the photograph, not here at least. He did, however, find two other Thorne's in Fernsby: Jeremiah and Heiod, brothers, both of whom left the same year the photo was taken.
“I'm engaged, Mr Holmes,” she says excitedly. “A lovely young man by the name of Scott O'brien proposed to me. We're to live in a cottage just south of Dover, a place called Swingate.”
Watson carefully treats the wound. It takes him almost half an hour to properly disinfect and wrap it. Then he puts a makeshift cast on the broken wrist. All the while, he thinks of how painful it must have been, and how cold the man seems to be. When Holmes is stabilized, Watson brushes the overgrown hair from his eyes.
“Okay. Records show that there was a Harry Watson here last week. He's been moved to the morgue.”
The final straw that seemed to snap the entire town into their rampage happened in December of 1866, when the Thorne's had the audacity to hold their own small, Evangelical ceremony in their home rather than attend the usual Catholic church.
“It makes you stupid,” he said.
When he returned to the motel, all was eerily quiet as before. The truck belonging to Danvers was still parked in front of 23A, unmoved since it first arrived.
This too, a lie.
He rocks on his feet for a moment and resists a bitter smile.
“I'm sure you've got a reason.”
“How can I help you?”
The torture goes on. He passes out, when he wakes they continue. There is no clock to measure the time in here, but hours seem to pass. He dreads every second, relief comes and goes as quickly as it came. He is praying, he is fervent. He tries to think good thoughts, retreat to his mind, but the shocks come and cannot be ignored. The pain hurts so badly he thinks he must be dying.
“No time in prison?” the Justice says. He considers this some more. “All right,” he says finally. “I, Justice of the Supreme Court of his Majesty Edward VII, accept the plea made by William Sherlock Scott Holmes, to plead guilty with conditions. Sentencing will be held November 5
Jennings comes in on a rainy day the first week of May. Holmes scarcely sees him, but he can see that he is putting up a fight with the guards. They take him to a cell too far for Holmes to see, but he catches glimpses of him during labor hours and such. His performance of insanity is an excellent one, Holmes must admit.
“Doctor Watson! Is something wrong?” Mrs Hudson goes to his side. “Your shoulder again?”
“Hello, you're the new owner, right?”
John, being a doctor, didn't disagree. Cannabis did have medical purposes, but it was illegal to grow and own nonetheless.
“Detective Jennings, lovely to see you,” Mycroft says.
“Sherlock, come in.”
“Will you really be here for two years?”
It was cardboard, thoroughly duct-taped, about the size of a large cat. John watched with his heart thumping as Darius put it on the ground and took out a shovel.
“Of course,” Watson says. “I'm sure Sherlock will thank you when he wakes, I'll send you a telegram when he is feeling more himself, or if any other matter developes. Thank you. For everything.” He means it, more genuinely than he can express.
“Do you think perhaps, if I write them the way they truly are, one day, the world can know?”
flowers here—in rows on tables and under special lights and in little boxes and hanging from the ceiling. All thriving, all in their prime—not a single specimen shriveled or drooping. He'd never seen anything like it.
Digging wise, it only took about twenty minutes. John had certainly done worse, but he was covered in dirt and grime by the time the tip of his shovel hit a solid mass in the ground.
From there, he slowly crept forward until he had a decent view of Darius and the truck, still well concealed himself.
The greatest terror comes that Monday.
Lestrade gulps and prepares to listen.
He has heard many a rumor surrounding Bedlam. Tales of torture and horror. People hung upside down from their feet, or left in isolation for months. He's heard of outbreaks of cholera and inmates strangling each other while the “doctors” watched.
Holmes should be yelling at him, but he knows it is not really the Inspector's fault, and besides that, there are more pressing things.
“That's funny, these are my favorite flowers. My mum used to plant them,” he said quizzically.
“John Watson.” John stuck out his hand, and the woman shook it.
He didn't see the Danvers man again, except the morning after he'd found the box, he thought he saw a black truck creep slowly by the motel, but it could've just been any black truck, really, so he tried not to think too much of it.
If people like it, I'm going to sell it in my shop, if not. . .” he shrugged.
Few others are aware. Mrs Hudson considers herself to be an old woman who has no time to trifle in other peoples' affairs or, in other words, was happy to be quiet about it.
“Oh, and John Watson.” He smiled. “What brings you here?”
“One moment please.”
He decides to make it his mission to find out where they put the bodies.
He attempts, in earnest, to think up little problems in his head for him to solve, but the cell grows more stagnant with each passing day.
Father Wentworth was what Holmes believed to be a truly godly man. He took special attention to Holmes as a boy, sharing bits of wisdom in the large cathedral.
John didn't drink coffee, because the stuff gave him anxiety and headaches worse than any hard liquor, but he did invest in a cup of herbal tea as they sat down in the small bakery.
At noon, a finely dressed man with a short trimmed black beard and handle bar mustache appears in a long coat. He goes to Holmes's cell, out of earshot of the guard, his face pressed closely against the bars.
Holmes is put in what seemed to be a large cage, similar to the ones in the police carriages. As the carriage moves, his stomach turns.
Well, unbeknownst to this, the Thorne family was startled at the treatment they received. They were used to it, of course, at home, but had been told that England would be far more liberal and accepting.
“Yeah, little circle right above his collar.”
“You have something then, Lestrade?” Holmes says impatiently. Lestrade looks down, and Holmes takes a closer look at him. His clothes are ruffled, his hair a bit more unruly than usual. He rushed out of his flat this morning. There is a stain of coffee on his jacket. The matter is urgent, then. It is sensitive and personal, judging by his demeanor. This man was not just carrying news, he was carrying
news.
The first time John had remembered the old Bible was, well, never.
“No,” Sherlock said, surprising both himself and John. “I mean, maybe I can help. You could tell me. . .over coffee? It's my lunch break anyway.” He didn't really have a lunch break.
“Sir, sir stop him this instant!” he cries, but the man just shakes his head. “STOP THIS!” he yells desperately, unable to reach the poor soul. But his pleading goes nowhere. Instead, he is forced to hear every blow as it falls, every cry of the man, until suddenly, it is silent.
he thinks,
They stopped in front of the shop.
“Might I suggest some
He moves stones, his muscles screaming in aching protest. Each is heavier than the last, the largest ones at the bottom of the towering pile. It is raining out, and each droplet stings his face. His clothes are soon soaked.
“How long?” another asks.
“Yeah, these are perfect, thanks,” John said with a smile. Irene waved at him.
“No, Watson could tell you the same.”
Holmes is transferred directly to Newgate Prison. He does not learn what happens to his dandelion in his old cell.
“I found this in the attic.” He showed him the photograph, then Irene. They both peered at it, then looked at each other thoughtfully.
“Oh?”
There is fighting, lots of it. Over food. Over words. Over tiny scraps of wood and metal. Over a bad look in someone's eyes.
He dreams that John comes to him.
“Caution will do one no good here.”
He nearly loses it there, but somehow keeps himself together as he crouches in front of Watson's chair. Watson is emotional, but he is not the type of man to weep. Holmes had only seen him do so thrice in the length of their companionship.
He got up and threw on some trousers, then he grabbed his keys and took his gun from the counter, creeping around to the front. He made it to the door just as the truck pulled out.
“Mr Holmes, are you aware of the charges brought against you?”
He alternates between piling blankets on the man and dosing him in an icy bath. Holmes is like a puppet, sad and lifeless and hardly aware of what Watson is doing.
“You should not have done this, Sherlock,” John says gently. “I would never, had I known—“
Sherlock's face immediately perked up.
However, the idea of Sherlock growing weed illegally in his apartment solely for scientific research was kind of hilarious to John.
“So you are Mr Smith and Miss Carpenter then,” Watson says softly. Elijah removes his hat.
He tries not to gag on the smell as he is led to a cell, and he is surprised to see there are multiple people already occupying it—not only another man, but a young women also.
? How about
John would need to take advantage of that offer sooner than he presently thought.
Sherlock nodded gravely.
Over the next week, John developed a bit of a friendship with his neighbor. They chatted about weather and the news and such. And she made brilliant biscuits.
he thought. He thought of hot summer days and warm blankets and hot fires. He thought of being wrapped in a large wool coat or curled up in bed. From sheer force of will, he felt his temperature rise just slightly.
A soft smile ghosted across his face, but then it was gone. He felt like that moment, where he was right then, could've gone on forever. There is some infinite about spending the hour of 2am with a friend, drunk on each other. It is one of those moments that is so raw and human that John felt like the texture of the maroon carpet and the smell of lilacs and the open window and Sherlock's eyes were the only real things in the world right then.
Sherlock shook his head again.
It was hard to remember exactly where it was he'd followed the Danvers man to, but after maybe thirty minutes, he turned onto a familiar dirt road.
Holmes thinks he has perhaps died.
“Congratulations,” Holmes says, taking another drag. “I'm glad to hear you have both found your lives once more.”
“Throw him in solitary,” one of them says in disgust, and Holmes knows it is the one he hit.
“So what's the problem?” Sherlock asked as he sipped a heavily sugared black coffee.
“Your. . .girlfriend?” Sherlock asked. John chuckled as he gestured for Sherlock to sit on the settee.
“Now!”
“No.”
When they exist the room, Gregson has no choice but to hold him in a cell.
“Violet, has he gone anywhere at all?”
“Oh, Fernsby Motel?” The man called Sherlock cocked an eyebrow. “That's. . . .nice.”
“You always know,” Mrs Hudson said with a smile, looking for the packet. Sherlock turned around.
“No,” John said. “S'not impertinent. I don't have one, no. I used to, back in London. Then she cheated on me while I away in the army.”
John forced himself to his feet, stumbled in, and fell asleep with his clothes on.
She handed him a tray of biscuits.
He has no view of the other side of Bedlam from his workplace on the grounds, but he intends to see where they are disposing of bodies. He does not trust they are reaching respectful graves.
The Justice clears his throat and brings a paper to his eyes.
what this idiot did.”
“I know, that's why you are.”
“I'm home,” he chokes.
A prison guard near bye eyes them, warning that their time is nearly up.
At first it was fine. Heiod and Jeremiah were adults, so they made a career of farming pretty nicely, and Isebelle (named for her mother) and her parents lived where the Watson Motel now sits, Cross Road Lane.
“Hmm, but you're gonna go down there.”
“You feel rejected. You feel alone, afraid. You feel like an anomaly. God will use that. We are all His children, every one of us the same. My child, I promise you are not a mistake, you have not flown away from Him.”
For example, one day, he was doing the dishes from lunch, and he was rinsing off the knife he used to spread the mayonnaise across his sandwich, and he suddenly thought, “Hmmp. I could stab someone with this.” And he briefly imagine what that would look and feel like, then he threw the silverware down and decided maybe he just ought to watch television for a while.
“She is afraid to be molested,” the other man explains, eyes narrowing at Holmes. “It is a cruel place here, with cruel men.” Holmes understands immediately.
“Who is this?” demands the man.
“What do you plead, sir?”
The man put a stack of notes on the counter.
He put it down and cut it open with a pocketknife. Then he threw aside the flaps and found. . .
“Well, thanks. It was good to meet you. For the record, I liked your bees, even though they stung.”
“Thank you. After she died, I fell into a pit of despair. It was perceived as insanity, and I was taken here.”
It smelt amazing, like fresh bread and coffee and something very sweet. The tables were round and worn, the chairs creaky but comfortable. It had a certain undeniable character about it that John found pleasant.
It is over a week since he has bathed.
“Oh dear!” Mrs Hudson cries upon seeing him.
His cellmate is called Hugo Armistead. His teeth are yellow and crooked, his face wrinkled together like a bunched up curtain. To Holmes's relief, the man is old and poses no threat to him. He is imprisoned for robbery.
John stared at him, waiting for him to laugh at the joke.
“Not boring, no,” Sherlock chuckled.
“I know, Sherlock, remember? We agreed, if one of us ever kills someone, the other helps them hide the body, no questions asked. It's our pact.”
Jennings tips his hat and leaves.
All he can do is lie in wait.
At 2 PM, John was sitting down to read the paper (which was excruciatingly dull) when the doorbell rang.
“Yes.”
“Gentlemen,” he says cheerfully.
He followed Darius down North Minster Street, until it turned to a dirt road verging off the beaten path. The terrain became rougher, and it was harder to keep his distance without Danvers seeing him. Still, he pressed on, his headlights off, until Darius stopped his truck and got out.
He lowers his head into his arms, deciding he will sleep. It is the only thing that may help the pain in his wrist subside, at least for a bit.
“Maybe you should drink some whiskey. I don't like being drunk alone, you know.”
(traveled)
“I should get back to the bees,” Sherlock said abruptly.
Groggily, he sat up in bed, looking out the window for the source of the noise. He could see the headlights of the American car cutting through the fog as Darius got in.
His tenant was gone, and 23A was spotlessly clean. John asked Violet if she had gone in and done it, but she shook her head.
He looks away from Miss Carpenter, rolling to face the wall.
Irene giggled.
(There is more than one canary in the cage)
Watson stuffs his revolver in his coat. “Are you sure it is time?” he asks Mycroft urgently.
Violet, now accustomed to her temporary roll as John's housekeeper, answered it for him.
You'll be glad to know we've caught that spy you were worried about, remember Dendruch, the German clergyman you suspected? You were right. He is in our custody now. Well done.
This time, Holmes is the one who cannot meet his eyes.
But it is not the types of criminal he battles, and so, he is grateful for this new surge of fascinating people with fascinating stories. In a couple years, a prostitute named Elizabeth Stride will come to him, telling him tales of her escape of a vicious killer at Whitechapel. He will solve the case quietly, without a soul knowing but him and Watson.
“All right.”
“Doesn't scare me,” he said. “I was a soldier. At least it's not boring here.”
“No.”
Sherlock patiently listened to it all while tinkering with a plant John didn't bother observing until the end of his rant.
“How did this come about?” Gregson huffs, and doesn't meet Holmes's eyes.
“I think I shall take up your cases,” he says. “And get all of us out of here.”
Holmes hums and jumps from his chair.
He is undressed by someone, a nurse, he assumes, and given a cold sponge bath. Then he is put in a bed only slightly more comfortable than the cot in the cell.
revealing he had survived, in truth he was petrified that one of Moriarty's men would learn of the correspondence and target him. He would never forgive himself if he caused harm to his only friend.
“Yes, I have maintained a romantic relationship with my friend Dr Watson.”
Eyebrows furrowed, he peered around the kitchen and parlor.
Inside he found what had fluttered to the floor that day.
Elaine beams.
Daffodils and lilies and lavender and honeysuckle—it smelt like a fresh spring day, just after a good rain. And God, there were
“Good luck with the grass, Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock said on their way out. “And I'll. . .see you around, John.”
His heart is pounding. He has made a grave mistake and he knows it. He has heard whispers of solitary before, of horrors unfit for the human mind.
“Yes, yes,” Holmes says. “I see Mrs Hudson has rubbed off on you yet more.”
He can feel Elijah and Elaine growing restless, as he himself is. Every day he is tired like he has never been tired before, every bone and muscles screaming in relief when he lowers himself upon his cot. Those days in May, his only relief comes at night, when he lays on his mattress and breathes. He tells himself how the suffering will be over soon.
“Holmes, can you hear me?” he says. Holmes only flinches in response.
John Watson pleads guilty (Holmes hears this from his cell one foggy morning). With Holmes's confession, there is no reason for a trial. His sentencing his scheduled for shortly after Holmes's.
The women is really more of a girl, Holmes thinks, as she cannot be older than twenty. Her eyes are large and brown, her skin fair, her hair a ratty nest of auburn. She is taller than average, thin, with bony fingers and an angular face. When she sees Holmes, he thinks for a moment she may weep in fright. She immediately curls behind the African man.
So there were those weeks of strain between them, when they both thought that their relationship may never be repaired to what it was. It was a frightening time.
He was going to
“Please calm down, Elaine,” Elijah says softly. A guard notices, coming over to inspect.
Lestrade is absolutely still, as if afraid. Watson shifts slightly in his chair. Holmes says nothing for several seconds, momentarily stunned.
“Goodbye, Sherlock. Good luck.”
He led him to the back, revealing a surprisingly large greenhouse abuzz with bees and more flowers and herbs.
He eats slowly, but it is futile. It lasts only a minute before he must rush to the chamber pot and hack it up.
“I know, brother mine. But you have always cared for justice over law, is that not so?”
Holmes admires his acting skills, and would try his techniques if he were not intent upon making it clear that he was, in fact, sane.
Miles away, Doctor John Watson's chest suddenly hurts. He clutches it.
“They took Mr Holmes yesterday,” Elijah tells Lestrade. “I think they may have tortured him. We haven't seen him since.”
Gregson writes this down. Holmes has essentially signed a confession. He knows that the Yarder will not suspect him of protecting his friend—after all, in their eyes, homosexuality was purely sexual. They made no connection between it and love.
Violet nodded and took the box with a smile.
“Your brother's been sent to solitary, sir.”
The affair started about a month ago.
“Sherlock Holmes will not die of typhoid, I won't allow it,” Watson says firmly. “Especially not because of me. I'm going to stay with you, Holmes. They'll let me treat you. Just hold on. For me, please.”
“I mean, I didn't know your mother planted them, but I knew—I knew you liked primroses. I always know, it's—kind of a gift.”
“Well, journey's end in lovers' meeting,” John said, unsure why he would pick that quote. It didn't really make sense, but it was the only one he could think of.
Then there is a firm, clenching squeeze in his chest as he realizes, to his horror, Watson is
When the villagers heard of this, they promptly stormed to Cross Road Lane, with pitchforks and torches, so to speak, and found three of the Thornes: Isebelle, James, and Young Isebelle.
“That's all right dear, I have to get finished with my gardening. Just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood. I live in the blue house, stop by anytime.”
“Mrs Hudson is my neighbor,” John explained. “I've just come with her. How. . .how're the bees?”
“No,” she said. “I'm Irene, Irene Adler. You're the new guy in town?”
Breakfast and lunch are the same—a pasty gruel substance, but dinner at least as bits of some unknown meat (Holmes's theory is pork, but he cannot be sure) and a cup of water. Lights are out at ten.
Watson's weekly letter brightens his days. He keeps them in a neat stack beneath his pillow and rereads them frequently. A letter he opens often reads like this:
He is nervous, the day of his sentencing.
“Yes, my Lord.”
“Strip,” he demands. Holmes stares at him, processing that. He squeezes his eyes shut tightly, and does as he says.
It could be something out of one of Watson's silly fictitious novels. The room is dimly lit, and inside is a chair. Beside the chair is a box that has several dials. Attached to that is a helmet-like cap with wires pertruding from it. Holmes does not like it.
“He must do his labor today,” the girl tells him. “It is to raise our morals. They say work is good for the brain.”
He hears a soft voice.
But perhaps even worse than this fear, which still seems to unreal to be a concern, is the pain Holmes is in every second he is awake.
He is getting worried.
Holmes never imagined it would amount to a real investigation.
“Good. I see much of His light in you, child. I think He will use you for wonderful things. God always uses people like you for brilliant things.”
Though he has already predicted what the exact outcome will be, still his mind races that he could be wrong—that it could be longer, worse.
The preliminary hearing is set for next week, and Holmes already has his fate in check.
John stewed over the interaction for some hours, in fact, until the sun went down and the temperature dropped outside.
“My lover!” he cries.
Lestrade is murmuring apologies and putting on his coat.
“Mr Holmes, are you aware of the charges brought against you?”
“Found it!” Mrs Hudson said triumphantly, brandishing her packet of grass seed. “This will show those Mormons across the street, I will
He wakes and can feel his limbs.
“I could poison him.”
“Harry, you twat, don't ignore me. Where are you?” He limped into Harry's bedroom and found it. . .spotlessly clean.
He was tall and thin, all angular and pale, with unruly dark curls and porcelain skin and eyes like rainwater.
“Sherlock, no.”
Again, he is allowed to bathe for much longer than normal and is permitted fresh clothes. For the first time in days, he can tolerate his own odor.
“We need to get to Sherlock,” Watson says anxiously, forgetting even to use his companions last name. “Where in God's name is Lestrade?”
Anyway, here's a new chapter.
He learns of the escape plan four days after his fever breaks.
“This place will be up in no time John, you'll see,” she said encouragingly. John nodded. He was kind of hoping. . .well, what had he been hoping, really? He was hoping someone else would show up.
This, of course, sent them into a state of anxiety. They heard other inverts were fleeing to university towns, but Holmes did not want to leave London.
He knows there is nothing, absolutely nothing, which can repair this moment.
Then he drifts into another round of impossible sleep.
“Likewise. Nice to meet you, Mrs Hudson.”
It is five days after his fever breaks that Watson must leave.
There are very few people in the room.
“Yeah, actually. That's. . .really amazing, how you do that.”
Red dots start to pepper his skin.
They are both dressed in new clothes, with new haircuts. Holmes can see that Miss Carpenter's skin is far fairer than he thought when all the grime is washed from it—and he can see the strong, handsome jawline of Mr Smith without his overgrown beard. They both glow with happiness.
“Yes.”
“Does everyone know about this? What about the police?”
Elijah Smith and Elaine Carpenter are surprised to say the least at the sight of the four men standing in front of them. Their eyes widen as the cell is unlocked.
Sherlock’s laugh comes out his nose. “It’s more than apt. What kind of idiot writes about his crimes in his
you wanted…”
“Did you?” Sherlock, oddly, smiles at him. “So have I. I didn’t want to say anything because I had no proof and I didn’t want to alarm you.”
Sherlock hurries to close the gap between them. “Found something?”
Sherlock clenches his jaw. There had better be a body or some manner of crime John wants him to investigate here, because otherwise this is really too much now. The upstairs is a partial loft, half the size of the ground floor, a log rail looking over into the kitchen. Nearly the entire space is comprised of a bedroom, a huge, very comfortable-looking bed in the centre and a bathroom visible against the far wall. There are lamps on both night tables but no overhead light, leaving the room in a warm, inviting, overtly-romantic glow. There doesn’t appear to be anything amiss. No bodies. No woman. Nothing unusual whatsoever. Sherlock feels his temper rising. He can’t make himself look at John, or at the bed. He can hardly believe that John would make him come up here, see the place where he intends to be with – whoever it is that he plans to spend his holiday with. In
“I’ve been thinking,” Sherlock says. He hesitates. “So… Corey’s asked me for dinner again tomorrow, at someone’s home. Friends of his, I gather.”
John smiles, just a little. “You too,” he says, then turns and walks out of the room, his hands flexing and closing as he goes.
?” Sherlock repeats. “What about yourself are you doubting? What is it, John? What could it possibly be, after everything we’ve worked through already? What haven’t we talked about?”
Sherlock favours him with one of his least genuine smiles. “Just ruling out your men’s footprints. What are they, then?” He nods at the officer’s feet.
she demands. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock hesitates for a moment, then follows him. He’s never certain how he’s expected to behave around Rosie, how much he’s expected to help or tend or any of that. He wants to support John, yet also doesn’t want to presume. Nor, as Mrs Hudson would definitely remind him, are children precisely his area of expertise. He hangs back, hovering in the shadows behind John, and watches as Harry patiently lets Rosie do the stairs herself, taking them one at a time, holding her hand.
Sherlock shrugs. “Perhaps she considered it a trophy, of sorts,” he says. “Perhaps she came back to gloat. Or perhaps she simply thought it would be the last place anyone might think to look for her. I don’t know.” He opens his mouth, possibly to change the subject, but there’s one more thing John needs to know.
Molly’s heart gives a pang for him. She shakes her head. “I’m sorry. I don’t know. Keep trying, though.”
Sherlock reaches up and grips John’s hand, still breathing hard. “That was incredible,” he manages, sounding dazed. After a moment, he collects himself and turns onto his side, facing John. “Now you,” he says firmly, and John nods, not wanting to deny him.
John gives a derisive snort. “UFO sightings, apparently. But it’s in the
I nod quickly. “Yeah. It’s – yeah.”
Sherlock sets his tea down carefully on the night table, then shifts closer to John, leaning in to kiss him again. “You really mean that, don’t you?” he says, unable to keep the wonder from his voice.
“Someone who does stuff like
“Okay,” Sherlock says, and waits.
And nothing has changed on that score. At this point, so much has happened, so much of it bad, that John wouldn’t even know where to start. It just isn’t possible now, if it ever was. There’s just… too much there. Too much bad blood. They’ve cautiously found tentatively solid ground. They’re friends again, more or less. Despite everything, they’re friends again. There’s a lot of shit that John knows he should apologise for, or apologise better for, but far more than he’s ever even said. And Sherlock is Sherlock, with his secrets and lies and the closed doors in his face. Letting him in here or there but never giving him the full picture. If he’d only just come out and said, that whole year after Rosie was born,
“Just curious,” Sherlock says lightly. “Where is he now? Do you know?”
“I did, once,” John offers, willing the heat in his own face to subside. “Can’t say I liked them much, but maybe my palate just wasn’t very sophisticated at the time.”
John looks at David to see if he’s finished, then looks back at Mary, his grey-blue eyes unusually sober. “There are some things I want you to know,” he says. “You thought you were terribly clever, but we’ve all seen through you now. I guess you can laugh at the notion of how long it took us to get here, but we’re all there now. No one here loves you anymore. Despite your best efforts, not even Molly – loyal, loving Molly Hooper – was willing to keep lying for you. Despite your best efforts, you completely failed to destroy mine and Sherlock’s friendship. We’re lovers now, as we always should have been. I made a huge mistake in marrying you, but that damage won’t last. You failed to hurt any of us in any lasting way. We’ll forget you soon enough.”
“We’re fine – no, you know what, round up the other admin staff and let them know, okay?” Lestrade asks. “We’ll deal with the files and the – rest of it,” he says, meaning the search of the ravine.
Sherlock pauses very slightly for dramatic effect. “Chez Pierre,” he says, and John’s eyebrows nearly reach his hairline.
is our new precedent,” he tells John, his eyes so intense that it hurts. “Nothing that came before matters. Do you understand? Only this.”
Later that evening, after the dishes have been finished and everyone has gone home, Sherlock comes back into the kitchen where John is just wiping down the table. He stops in the doorway, watching him for a moment. “John.”
“Me? Oh, heavens, no,” Jodie says. “I’ve got a boyfriend, Dan – we’ve been together forever, four years now, but I just don’t think he’s in a rush to get married. Or possibly ever… sometimes I wonder if it’ll look bad for business, being a wedding planner who isn’t married herself, but what can you do! Sometimes these things just have to wait until they’re ready, right?”
“No. The tattoo should be located on the back of her skull, right side,” Mycroft tells them. “It’s a stylised graphic of a wolverine, should be about an inch in diameter. You’ll need to shave her head to see it. I rather doubt that the Sunderland mortuary was that thorough.”
radio acting up, isn’t it?”
He’s behind Biggs as they get out into the corridor, but the door is slow to close behind them so he needs to drag this out a bit. “Thanks, yeah – I just need a direct invite for this one, and I managed to get a membership list and saw you were on it. I’ve been meaning to ask all week.” Biggs looks back at him over his shoulder, inhaling to respond, but John doesn’t give him the chance. The door is shut now and they’re alone in the corridor. He gets a forearm under Biggs’ chin in a sleeper hold, his other hand clapped over his mouth. “Quiet,” he orders as Biggs struggles hard against his grip, both hands scrabbling at John’s arm. He goes limp a moment or two later as the oxygen deprivation kicks in. “That’s it. Nice and easy,” John breathes, easing him down to the carpet. He looks around and spots a utility closet, creeps quietly over and tries the door. It’s open. He glances up to check for cameras, but miraculously there doesn’t seem to be one facing them – there’s one several feet to his left, but it’s pointing the other way. Perfect. He drags their would-be bomber quickly into the closet, then kneels to fish a zip-tie out of his pocket and quickly secures Biggs’ hands at the wrist. Good: now to put significant distance between himself and their victim. John gets himself out of the closet and back into the lecture hall as stealthily as he can, moving around to the side to choose a row about two-thirds of the way back. He’d best be seen attending, but not too obviously, either. Steven Larson is just coming up to the podium. John takes out his phone, surreptitiously checks that the people on either side of him aren’t paying attention, then types,
Sherlock doesn’t come back to the bedroom that night. John wakes sometime after nine, the sunlight in his eyes, and hears voices in the kitchen. Slightly disoriented, he sits up on the left side of Sherlock’s bed and listens. It’s Mrs Hudson, talking to Sherlock, her voice going up in pitch sometimes: talking to or about Rosie, then. He feels immensely awkward: if she’s been up to his room to get Rosie, she’ll know he wasn’t in there, obviously, and yet Sherlock is up and about while John is asleep in Sherlock’s bedroom. He grimaces. Will Mrs Hudson have asked Sherlock about it? If so, what on earth might he have told her? It doesn’t bear thinking about. He gets up and pads barefoot into the loo to brush his teeth and splash a bit of water onto his face. He’ll shower and shave later; first he wants to get a lay of the land. Grasp the nettle and see exactly how weird things are.
I feel my cheeks heat a little and scowl. “Well… if you want to know, yes. I mean, I was never sure about Mary. For the obvious reason that maybe I never did want
John shudders. He would rather have died. That’s the honest truth of it. He goes to the window and gazes out at his view. He always needed this, needed to be doing something different. Even if Mary hadn’t been what and who she was, that life never would have made him happy. And Sherlock was always the key to that freedom. Obviously there’s a mountain more to it than that, too, but they’ve made him feel so defensive that he doesn’t even want to go there right now.
“Because we never told you it was a peanut allergy,” I tell him grimly. “That’s as good as a confession right there. Come on. Let’s get you over to the Met.”
He goes harder and harder, a steady pace set up now, and I’m gripping the edge of the counter with all my might, my cock fit to burst but my attention more on the golden sensation his cock is procuring within me. I could come from this alone, I know, but Sherlock is ever better than that. He’s thrusting and thrusting, the cupboard in front of us rattling, and he reaches around to take my cock in one hand, his fist jerking over it in time with his thrusts. I’m in fucking heaven. I can’t even talk anymore – my voice is high and breathy, sensation flooding my entire body, and then suddenly it’s too much – everything turns to gold, spiking in sensation so thick I can’t breathe anymore, and then I’m clenching around his cock and shuddering in his arms, my head thrown back, mouth open in pure ecstasy as I come, shouting, my cock spraying the cupboards copiously.
Sherlock looks at him and smiles, a real smile. “Again,” he agrees.
“Not in the slightest,” Sherlock tells him. “Come and sit down.”
“Working on it.” Carl turns and goes back into the Mills’ blood-spattered house.
“Right, okay,” John says quickly. “Well – if he’s already got his hand here, he’s asking. So you can either agree to let him touch you, and indicate it by – I don’t know, getting closer, though you were in a car, so there’s only so close one can get – or by moving his hand directly to where you want it, or else by touching him in a similar way as your own request. Why don’t you try one of those things?”
“A lie of omission is still a lie,” Sherlock informs her, and Molly shuts her mouth, swallowing. “Mary is alive: we know this. What else have you been hiding from us, Molly? Now is the time to come clean.”
He stops again. “What did Donovan say?” Ella prompts.
“Molly,” John says briefly. “But it was Mary who put her up to it, Mary who told her which words to say.”
Roy. John feels his jaw clench. “Not him,” he says, scowling. “Anyone but him!”
“D’you want to take my pants off?” he asks, trying hard to keep his voice calm, which is a challenge.
John ducks his chin in a quick nod. “Right. Yeah. Thanks.” He clears his throat. “Shall we, then?” he says to Sherlock.
“Now,” Sherlock says, his voice shot through with breath. And then, “
Sherlock looks at him. “I think there’s potential for concern,” he says quietly. “I blacked out at some point while I was with Eurus when she was posing as Faith Smith. Granted, I was already high, but the reaction that occurred after certainly could have come from having mixed TD-12 with… the other substances I was on. Bill Wiggins is very reliable and he was confused by my state afterward. Plus, my memories of the week that followed are still distressingly blurred.”
A message comes on; Kyle is not at the desk yet. “Er, good morning,” Sherlock says, keeping his voice down. “This is Sherlock Holmes in room 19. I just wondered if we could possibly have our breakfast served in our room today, around half-past nine, if that’s all right. Thanks.” He disconnects, resets his alarm for ninety minutes later than it was, then eases back into the comfort of John’s arms and wills himself to fall back asleep. Mycroft will call if they need to do anything. For anything less, Sherlock refuses to lose a single minute of this.
She shakes her head a little and taps her pen against her notebook. “There’s a lot that I can’t disclose due to client confidentiality, but I was aware that Sherlock had been shot. I wasn’t aware of who was behind it. It… does help to clarify some things.”
“It’s not half-bad, honestly,” Sherlock says, and gives him the merest ghost of a smile.
Sherlock can barely speak, he’s so turned on. “Are you – are you going to – ” he stutters, and John understands again.
“What did we do with that lube?” he wants to know, and after a bit of patting around for it, they find it. John smears some onto them both, then puts both hands on Sherlock’s arse as Sherlock begins to thrust against him, rocking their bodies together as the pleasure begins to build. He lost most of his self-consciousness overnight; now it’s just fun. John comes first this time, moaning as his release sprays out over both of them. When he finishes, he grabs at Sherlock’s hips, pulling him upward, and Sherlock goes in some confusion until John’s mouth closes around the head of his penis and begins to suck. Sherlock holds onto the headboard and gasps raggedly as John’s mouth moves over his most sensitive flesh, sucking the orgasm up from the depths of his testicles, and when it’s upon him, he thrusts helplessly into John’s throat and pours himself down it, unable to stop, but John just makes sounds to encourage it, and the sounds make Sherlock come even harder.
“You look phenomenal,” Sherlock says, not masking his admiration. “Are you really going to marry me?”
Sherlock looks at him but doesn’t answer. They get up and move hastily to grab at dressing gowns from the hooks on the back of the bedroom door, tying them shut even as they move into the corridor and up the stairs.
Next, John makes for the stairs. “Let’s see what’s up here,” he says, still speaking too quickly.
A lump forms in John’s throat and for the moment, he can’t speak. He leans forward swiftly and kisses Sherlock, hard. Sherlock clutches at him and kisses back with equal force. John hears himself make a desperate sound into Sherlock’s mouth and gets a leg around Sherlock’s hips, and Sherlock reaches between them and takes John’s cock in hand, squeezing and rubbing it gently, but not so much as to make him come. John moans and puts his hand over Sherlock’s, squeezing.
“I don’t want to go back to the clinic.” Now that it’s started, it’s hard to stop. “I don’t want to stay home all the time. I want to work with you again. That’s all I want.”
John goes over to stand by him, examining what they’ve got in, and together they gather their ingredients: onion, garlic, ginger, red pepper, snow peas, mushrooms, bok choy, the chicken breast, soy sauce. Sherlock suggests they do a peanut coconut sauce, so John agrees and gets the peanut butter and a tin of coconut milk from the cupboard, too. “D’you want to put on some water for rice?” he asks.
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asks him, his voice deep and gentle.
Sherlock adjusts his position, then says through what sounds like a tensed jaw, “I thought I was.”
John waits. “What?” he asks. “What were you going to say?”
Sherlock’s left shoulder twitches in what might be a shrug. “I don’t remember.”
Sherlock smiles now. “If you’re willing to put up with me, after everything I’ve put you through – ”
Molly nods, and Sherlock tugs John by the hand. “Come on,” he says. “Let’s go and get her. Again.”
It’s his turn to stop, and John doesn’t know whether he wants to demand that Sherlock finish the sentence, or apologise for last night. His face is flushing, though, so he starts with the second one. “Look, about that – I’m sorry,” he says wretchedly. “I don’t know why I didn’t – I don’t know, make it more like the other coachings.” He shrugs, feeling more idiotic than ever. “I guess it was because it was just – too much for me to keep pretending.”
Sherlock is watching him intently, a look of faint disgust on his features. “And then we found a bomb and caught a bomber,” he points out. “Well. That is rather off-putting. Agreed, then: I won’t sit with him. How very inconsistent for the former CEO of this entire enterprise.”
“Rosie,” Sherlock says, in reminder.
Silence envelops them as thoroughly as the darkness. They lie there, both exquisitely aware that the other person is also still awake. Sherlock can feel, illogical as it sounds, that John is as aware of it as he is. It seems to go on forever before he finally falls asleep.
Sherlock shrugs and doesn’t look at him. “I thought I’d interview the front of house manager. Apparently he’s in today.”
They’re sitting at the table, Scott in Sherlock’s chair while Sherlock paces behind John’s. Scott clears his throat. “I’m sorry, I know you guys are here on vacation and for relationship stuff, but I just thought, being who you are and all. I don’t know who else to ask. If Jeremy’s actually missing, then I don’t know who I can trust.”
“Look, I’m sorry I snapped at her like that,” he says, his voice abrupt. “I didn’t mean to and I’m sorry. I don’t want to have a whole talk about it, though, all right?”
a shot. He closes his right eye, and is thankful that his hands are completely steady. He has no qualms about this, not a single one. He pulls the trigger and shoots Mary in the forehead.
“I feel sick,” John says. His voice comes out sounding thick and heavy. “I… it never even occurred to me. I don’t know, I just thought it was normal marital bickering or whatever. I thought everyone’s marriage was like that.”
“Okay.” Sherlock carves off a large piece and hands it to John. Their fingers touch for a moment, but neither of them remarks upon the fact, though Sherlock is far too aware of it.
Justin and Thom are there already, yawning but sitting very close to each other on their loveseat.
Eventually they pull themselves together, tug each other to their feet, and begin making their way back toward the park entrance and the hotel, their fingers linked tightly together. “So now we just have to go on pretending this isn’t happening,” Sherlock muses as they walk. “We’re very good at denial and pretty good actors, if I may say so. But it’s going to be hard to keep it off my face every time I see you.”
Sherlock kisses him again in response to this, as hungrily as before, and they stand there for a long, long time, in no hurry to do anything but this, arms tight around each other, hands gripping each other’s faces and backs and it’s so perfect that John could just about cry. They’ve waited so bloody long to get to this point. It barely even feels real, like it could possibly be happening at all, but here it is. He feels so fiercely grateful that he doesn’t even know where to leave himself, and it’s incredible.
John blinks. “I don’t know. I don’t know. But now – Sherlock – I just have to know. You can laugh if I’ve got it wrong – I don’t even care any more. Just tell me this: do you love me?”
He feels Sherlock’s hesitation as much as he hears it. “You didn’t mention that, either,” Sherlock says, a bit stiff. He looks down at the card. “
Sherlock ignores this bit of uselessness. “It would seem that the parachuter took refuge in your barn.” He checks the time. It’s now nearly eleven. “At what time did you phone the police?” he asks.
Liz nods. “So could I.”
“Only one way to find out,” John said, so here they are, in one of the rooms attached to the dining room. It’s smaller than the common room, with seating for about eighteen people. The chairs have been arranged into a semi-circle. They’re the first ones there, but Brad and Doug arrive soon after, and then the other seats get filled with people they don’t know.
Mycroft has just descended the stairs again, having duly delivered the latest hourly report. John checks that the door is closed behind him, then looks across the table at Sherlock. “We need to talk,” he says quietly. He’s been waiting all day for the right moment and now he feels – well, not ready for it, but as ready as he’s going to get. Rosie is down for her nap and it’s quiet. He feels trapped inside, already feeling restless with cabin fever, the omnipresence of Mycroft’s host of agents pervading the entire house.
By the time it’s over, it’s nearly supper time, so Sherlock suggests we go out. I’m fucking starving by this point, so I agree. We go for Thai, a nice little place about halfway between the crime scene and Baker Street that we’ve eaten at before. They’ve got delicious spring rolls, as I recall. We order massaman and green curries with basil and share, spooning it over jasmine coconut rice and drinking tangy lemongrass iced tea with it all. The place is only half-full, so we snag a table in the window with candles burning in colourful glass jars. Some sort of plinky music is playing, but quietly, not interrupting our conversation.
John looks down at Rosie. “Let’s not talk about it in front of her,” he says. “Come on.” He takes Sherlock by the hand and leads him out of the room, leaving the door open behind him. They go downstairs and into the loo. It’s only a little after ten, but by wordless agreement they start getting ready for bed. John has the irrational feeling of wanting to cocoon himself in bed with Sherlock and stay there, Rosie only a short flight of stairs away, farthest from the doors, Mrs Hudson just downstairs. He goes into the bedroom and turns up the volume on the baby monitor on their side, too, just to be safe. “It sounds stupid, but I almost want to bring her downstairs with us,” he admits, going back into the loo.
“South,” she says, trying to simultaneously frown and smile. “Where are
John purses his lips and runs his fingers through his hair, a sure sign that he’s thinking. “You’re sure you don’t mind?” he asks. “I really could do with a bit of air…”
“Let me check.” Sherlock pulls out his phone and begins typing rapidly with his thumbs. He looks up and around us, then asks, “Italian?”
“So much for cleaning up,” John says, sounding terribly amused. He shows Sherlock his palmful of come, leaking through his fingers. “I’m just going to wash my hand. Possibly even both of them.”
Sherlock shakes his head. Of course John would think this; he does not trust Sherlock. “I had to find her and get her to tell me how to shut the water off.” He should say more, say that John was his first priority, but somehow he can’t bring himself to say it. He keeps his eyes fixed on John, as though he can draw him physically out of the well by the strength of his gaze alone, and John seems to draw strength from that and doesn’t take his eyes from Sherlock’s even as the officer cuts him free and holds the ladder steady for John to climb out. Sherlock reaches for him when he’s in range and pulls him over the wall of the well, putting a blanket around John’s shivering form and turning to give the officer a deeply-meant thank you over his shoulder. His arms linger a little too long around John under the guise of rubbing over his arms to warm him and fend off hypothermia. “We’ll get you something hot to drink,” he’s saying when Lestrade comes over to check on them.
“We did,” John acknowledges. “Perhaps we’ll have to look into some extra insulation between the floors. Not that either of us are keen to get back into renovations now that they’ve finally finished.”
(It’s pretty nice, all the same.) He closes his eyes and tries to go back to sleep, savouring the feeling of being in Sherlock’s arms at last.
“Then why are you?” Lee asks, folding his fingers together and setting them on the ankle currently balanced on his right knee.
The prosecutor watches Jeremy with compassion, guiding him with questions here or there, but mostly just letting him talk. “Did you forget other things?” she asks.
, working on our relationship. I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. This time it might really be the end for me, and I just can’t even imagine what the future will look like.”
He walks through the door and stops, seeing John there. Their eyes lock and hold for a long moment. John can’t speak and doesn’t try. Everything is right there, all over his face and plain enough to read. Sherlock’s eyes travel over his face and take all of it in. “I’m glad you’re home,” he says, breaking the silence. His voice is quiet but very intense. “We should talk.”
John thinks of Mrs Hudson turning up her nose at any flavour or ingredient that might fit that description and has to agree. “Fair enough. What are you doing now, if the cake’s already baking?”
presented in turn. It was as though he had come into the world determined to destroy himself. Narcotics replaced emotional vulnerability for a time. Mycroft always tried not to allow himself to think that this has had anything to do with him, with his having guided Sherlock so successfully away from experiencing feelings in general. It was difficult to avoid the rather obvious conclusion that this new manner of self-destruction was a direct replacement for the other, however, and so he laboriously took on the responsibility of saving Sherlock from that, too, overseeing his treatment and generally monitoring the situation as well as he and his staff possibly could.
John walks over to the table and opens his laptop to read the email there. Mycroft’s missive is short and to the point:
; it was all for John!”
Sherlock is snickering, too. “I still think it looks like the four horsemen. But have it your way.”
Sherlock nods. “All right.” He goes back to the kitchen to deal with the contractors.
Ella gets it. “But of course it did matter, before,” she states. It isn’t a question, and he doesn’t respond, neither confirming nor denying it. “I see.”
bank account,” John says tersely. “If she had funds somewhere else, she certainly never told me about it. And I’m aware that she must have, because whatever she did to pay for that whole running away business didn’t come from my account.”
John listens to the steps of her high-heeled boots descend the stairs. “Where’s she going to go?” he asks.
As Kyle speaks, John grips Sherlock’s hands and they tune him out. “God, Sherlock,” John says, his voice low. “Thank you for that. I have never loved you so much as I do right now. And – I can’t believe I ever doubted that for even a second.”
One day Sherlock is in the break room, pouring himself yet another cup of the Yard’s terrible coffee when John comes in, never far behind him.
“That wasn’t an option,” he says, still easy, but it’s clear to John that he’s not about to give in. “Come on: I want the whole story, you two. Let’s find ourselves a pub.”
John finishes his shave and washes his face, then turns to Sherlock, who holds out a face towel for him. John takes it and pats his face dry. “How is it?” he asks.
Mrs Hudson nods, looking concerned. “Did they find him? The little boy?”
I laugh. “When we get tired of crime-solving, we can open a restaurant,” I say, and that makes Sherlock smile to himself, occupying himself with unfolding his serviette.
“You haven’t,” John assures him. “I just – maybe it’s silly, but I just wanted to do something nice for you.”
John is startled by the abrupt change in subject, and privately wonders why, if Sherlock particularly likes King’s College, they’re walking in the opposite direction. Perhaps it’s private, or not something Sherlock wants to share with him. He suppresses an inner twist of self-recrimination and slight frustration, and makes himself pay attention to what Sherlock just said: they’ve stopped in front of a pub advertising lunch until three. “Oh – sure,” he says, not much caring. He was already hungry when they left Chilton College and the fresh air has whetted his appetite to a fine point. The notion of a tall pint of very dark beer and something hot and greasy is suddenly quite appealing. “Yeah, this looks good,” he adds. He’s closer to the door, so he leads the way inside, requesting a table for two. “By a window, if you’ve got one,” he adds.
Mycroft waits out the little tirade with patience, then lets a moment or two of silence spin out following Watson’s gripe. “Have you finished?” he asks, then carries on without waiting for a response. “Good. We have business to attend to.”
“But she would like that. Of course she would.” Sherlock takes another bite of his food. “I have no objection whatsoever,” he tells me, stabbing a piece of roast parsnip. “I hope you didn’t think that I would.”
When it’s time, they knock at the door of Margaret’s office in the back building and she calls to come in.
“Go,” Molly says simply, waving him away, and he’s gone within seconds. She looks down at the cadaver in front of her. “I’m sorry, Mr Doe,” she says. “I’ve neglected you awfully. Let’s finish up, shall we?”
John thinks briefly of all the years he’s spent trying to hide from the fact of who he is, truly, of all the time he’s spent trying to not know how he felt about Sherlock, and feels a pang. He thinks his choice to get up and walk out of that circle yesterday morning, though that was almost more of a compulsive reaction, a full-bodied rejection of what was going on. “Yes,” he says firmly. “We do.” He picks up his schedule and pushes back his chair. Betty and Keith are perfectly nice when they’re talking about the weather, the food, or their home state, but he finds the thought of carrying on this conversation a moment longer completely intolerable. “I’m going to get ready for the first session,” he says politely. “I’ll see you in there.”
“Still asleep in your old room.” Sherlock hesitates. “You could leave her here overnight, if you want. I don’t mind. I’ll put the monitor in my room. Be easier for you that way. And she’s already asleep.”
“Just – shift back like – yeah, that’s – ahh – ” John’s voice rises as Sherlock shifts as directed, then finds the right angle and presses forward in one long, smooth motion, burying himself in John’s body like a puzzle piece completing a puzzle at long last.
“He’ll eat half of it the same day you bring it up,” he tells Mrs Hudson, who grins at Sherlock.
He pulls Sherlock back into his arms and they both shiver at the intimacy of being nude together this way for the first time. The kiss starts off gently but rapidly turns hungry again, fingers gripping each other’s skin, cocks bumping and pressing together, their thighs pushing together in an ever-rising, driving need to be closer. John transfers his mouth to Sherlock’s neck, to the pulse pounding there against his tongue, and feels Sherlock’s moan as much as he hears it. John isn’t sure whether he’s pushing or Sherlock’s urging him to the bed, but the next thing he knows, Sherlock is shoving back the blankets and pulling him down on top of him. It’s incredible. John used to tell himself that he could never desire a man the way he did women, but this – he hadn’t imagined it could feel like this, even all those times he was secretly ogling Sherlock’s body and trying to deny it to himself at the same time. (
John looks at him. “Does she know about us?” he asks, very directly. “Did you tell her?”
, John thinks. “I’m easy either way. Really. What would you like?” Sherlock bites his lip, looking unsure, so John attempts to prod him in the direction he wants. “Would you like me to stay down here?”
She spends the train journey with her forehead leaning against the window, watching the countryside go by and feeling blank. It’s just so much to take on. She may be M. L. Holmes (Meredith Lavinia, though whenever anyone dares try out Lavinia on her, she puts a stop to that quickly enough), mathematician and physicist on the one hand, but when it comes to her own children she feels both slow and helpless. She should have done better. She knows that at least half of her anger toward Mycroft is really just misdirected anger at herself. She failed her children – all three of them. Spectacularly, at that. And maybe she failed Des, too. God, how lucky she is that he’s stuck by her side through thick and thin – and there was a lot of thin.
Sherlock’s masseur pats him on the back. “Take all the time you want,” he says. “The hot tub is just in the adjoining room, when you’re ready. There’s also a loo just through the other door, if you need, and the massage oil is just here.”
Molly doesn’t blush or pull away. “I guess it makes sense that they would,” she says, but the words are fuzzing on her tongue. She’s never touched another woman’s breast before. She decides to say this out loud. “I’ve – never touched a breast before,” she says. “Not one that wasn’t mine, at least.”
, his hands even gentler on Sherlock’s shoulders and back as they urge him toward the nearest street to get a cab. Sherlock finds it knee-weakening in the extreme, and replays the transition over and over again in his head later.
“I’ll make you one,” John promises. He scoops loose tea leaves into the teapot, then pours boiling water over them, the oils from the bergamot rising to meet his nose. “So after, I assume you went directly back to his place?”
They don’t separate despite the tapping of heels on the stairs, though they do hastily scramble to zip themselves away again. Nonetheless, they’re still kissing when Mrs Hudson walks in. “Oh, for goodness’ sake,” she says mildly. “Snogging again, is it? Don’t you two have a wedding to plan? Cases to work on?”
Ella smiles very slightly. “And it has nothing whatsoever to do with biology, John,” she says gently. “You were her father. Plain and simple. And now you need to grieve. But it will be cleaner this time. Your grief is for the right reasons this time. Be grateful that she’s safe and secure, and grieve for your loss. Sherlock will help you. Having his love will help, so lean on that. Let yourself need him. I’m not talking about dependency; I’m talking about not doing that thing you do, holing up and rebuilding your walls so that no one can get in. He loves you and you love him and that’s wonderful. He wants desperately to be wanted by you, to be needed by you. To be useful to you in some way. So let him in. Let him grieve with you, and let him comfort you. You don’t have to carry this one all alone.”
John shakes her hand. “Quite,” he says. “Good luck with everything.”
Sherlock smiles. “It’s terribly interesting,” he says, a bit like an admission, but it’s not very specific.
It's so hot that it pushes John all the way to the edge. He clings to Sherlock’s back and thrusts against his spurting cock three, four, five more times and that’s it – he’s there, the orgasm roaring through his frame and thundering in his ears as he comes all over Sherlock’s stomach and chest, not even touched directly.
“I know. At least, I do now.” Sherlock is contrite, his voice still gentle. He touches John’s eyes with infinite amounts of tenderness, catching the tears on his thumbs and wiping them away. “I’m sorry, John. So sorry. I wish I had known. I do see why you couldn’t tell me, though.”
Sherlock takes care to look troubled. “I’m not sure,” he says. “But I was thinking over our last chat, about the missing couple from my group.” He goes over to a guest chair and sits down without being invited to do so, simultaneously wondering precisely how close Lestrade is at the moment. “Are you aware that there are after-hours sexual activities going on in the steam room most nights?”
“Sherlock, we’ve got less than a minute,” John cuts in, his voice terse. “Ellis can’t defuse it. It’s going to go off whether or not it’s detonated and he thinks it’s too unstable to move!”
Sherlock nods quickly. “Okay.”
Sherlock pulls back and tips John’s chin up with one finger. “It’s not a wrench,” he says firmly. “It’s four or five days a month. I’m glad we’ll be having her sometimes, so please stop thinking of it as some sort of imposition. I’ll admit, the thought took me a little to get my head around, but it’s there now. It was no great feat.” He hesitates, then puts his lips to John’s for a brief moment, but as he makes to pull away again, John makes a sound of negation and pulls him back in, so Sherlock goes with it and lets John have his mouth. Their tongues slide together and Sherlock hopes briefly that he hasn’t got morning breath or something, but John doesn’t seem to be objecting. His hands wander down John’s back to the firm curves of his arse, warm through the thin cotton of his pyjama pants, Mrs Hudson’s apron strings hanging playfully over top.
He doesn’t object to this, either. When it comes to John, Sherlock knows quite well that he made a decision long ago to accept however much John is willing to grant him. It’s just a pity that what that is seems to be so very far from what he secretly yearns for. It’s not to be – he’s always known that. He’s trying his best to make meals off the crumbs John is willing to give him and make that be enough. He’s got very good at making do. It could be enough. It all depends on whatever it is that John is hiding from him.
“There’s no need,” he says, his voice coming out low and not entirely steady. He puts his cheek down in John’s hair and lets the hug spin out, silently treasuring every second of it. “I’m glad you didn’t mean it.”
“Yes. I suppose we’ll have to.” Sherlock sighs. “Only this afternoon and tomorrow morning, and then this thing wraps up at lunch. Hopefully we’ll have found the real perpetrator by then.”
Sherlock’s mother was right.
John keeps his eyes on the coffee now dripping into the rather nice clay mug he put under the spout, his hands on his hips. He shakes his head. “Probably,” he says. “I’m just being cynical. Maybe you get too old for magic after a certain point. I certainly didn’t have any with Mary.”
Sherlock swallows hard. “You’re a doctor,” he says to his hands, his voice quiet. “You know how to… do that. Prostate and rectal exams. I assume you do that without causing lasting harm, unlike your average person off the street. I…” He stops and a rather eloquent silence forms in the space between them, Sherlock turning his head slightly toward John, but not looking at him.
She doesn’t ask about his drinking; she’ll save that for the appointment, but she’s marvelling at how forthcoming John is being. It’s a marked difference and she can hear how happy he is, too. “Great,” she says. “Tell Sherlock to come at two, then, and you can come up at half-past.”
John frowns. “The army? Which division?”
“Yes. I know,” Sherlock says, not quite cutting him off. This is delicate territory. John gained just over fifteen pounds during the first lockdown started back in spring. He lost much of it with jogging and going to the gym over the summer, but now that the gym has closed again for the second lockdown and the cold late-November weather has made it unpleasant to jog outside, John has been fretting about the weight coming back. His solution for this has been to attempt to cut back on eating carbs, but he’s also been at a loss as to how to cook around his self-imposed restriction. Hence, Sherlock’s latest project in lieu of cases that they can solve without leaving the flat has been to quietly research low carb cooking strategies that actually taste good, because John is actually quite picky when it comes to food. On top of that, he’s insecure about his appearance, now more than ever, and flares up rather easily over it. “I bought orange peppers,” Sherlock says. “I thought I would cook the minced beef with taco seasoning and onion, then mix in the other usual fillings, top them with cheddar cheese, and roast them. Thoughts?”
John looks over at Rosie. “Well, except that I need to figure out some sort of long-term plan as to what to do with her,” he says. “I mean, I could put her into a daycare if I can find one with an opening, but she’s still rather young for that. Molly says she can’t take any more time off work. So either I stay home with her, or we keep asking Mrs H to take her, but she’s got a life of her own, too. Plus, financially speaking, I’ve just got to work, at least a little. Especially with her to support.”
incredible.”
, uncomfortably aware though he is of its valid application here.)
Sherlock squirms, but not with discomfort. “Good,” he says, a little breathlessly, his erection growing still more. “John – I want – ”
John hesitates. “Sherlock – that’s a big thing to say. With addiction – ”
Kate stiffens, but Molly looks a bit upset. “I’m sorry,” she says to John, looking genuinely distressed. “I didn’t – I guess we were only thinking of Rosie. I… I didn’t know it would have such an effect on you.”
Sherlock nods. “Likewise.”
John, to Sherlock’s scrutinising eye, looks intrigued. “That actually sounds rather good,” he says. “Er, should I help? Chop… something?”
John shifts over so that they’re touching all down Sherlock’s right and his left. “Practical,” he says, justifying it, then unfolds the map and changes the subject before Sherlock can comment. “If he’s lurking around the southern ridge here, Donovan and Daryl should find him pretty quickly. Of course, Daryl’s kind of a big lug – he could scare Rutherford off from miles away.”
I make myself lift my head, concerned. “You want to take it out?” I ask.
John is spared having to respond to this by the arrival of their wine. He shouldn’t drink on an empty stomach, but he wants to taste it. “To another successful case,” he says, holding up his glass.
He nods. “There are no words for this,” he manages. “For what this feels like – having you inside – ”
Sherlock wakes early. From the quality of the light coming in, he knows already that it’s only just after dawn. He reaches surreptitiously for his phone and confirms this; it’s not yet seven. He’s still tired, his eyes gritty from the poor quality and overall brevity of his sleep, yet he feels restless and doesn’t want to go on sleeping. Not with things as they are. He looks over at John, asleep and breathing deeply, still facing away from him. He exhales and slumps back into the pillows. Things were going so well. Was it a mistake to try – any of this? Having a relationship of this nature so soon into John’s recovery? It seemed inevitable, given their conversation at the flat, yet last night was an unmitigated disaster. Sherlock still feels tender and thinks that his unsated erection, their failed attempt at sex, is rather perfectly symbolic. Perhaps this entire venture was doomed to failure from the start. Too much bad history between them. Too many misunderstandings. Too little communication, their efforts at correcting this now proving to be too little, too late.
John is aghast. He looks at Liz. “Is that – is that true?” he asks, wincing internally. His grip on Sherlock’s hand tightens.
“We’d best not,” Sherlock says. “Or else we’ll be too full to run. As it is, this cake is probably a bad idea. I can’t bring myself to regret it, though.”
Sherlock’s lips press together and he looks down at his keyboard. “Just… leave it for now, all right?”
John’s breath heaves and shudders in his back. “You can’t possibly still want me, after all the rest of it. Me getting married. Mary shooting you. Me going back to her, even after – then what you did for me, with Magnussen. Trying to spare me Mary’s past. Having a kid with her, after all that. And then me blaming you, cutting you off. The – morgue that day. I don’t know how you could possibly still want me.”
John clears his throat. “Right, yeah,” he says, agreeing rather lamely. “Only… I’ve been back four weeks already. Rosie and me. Why now?”
Somehow, it was the right thing to say, miraculously. Sherlock relaxes visibly. “I’ve got a spare charger,” he says, turning away to reach into his night table drawer for it. He turns back. “Here.”
Sherlock hasn’t finished, though. “Even more than that… it had already got to the point wherein I couldn’t remember who I was practising for anymore. I kept telling myself that you were only doing it because I was asking – you reminded me of that more than once – and that it was so that I could have Corey, for however long that was to last. That you were doing me a kindness – and you were, but I didn’t even realise how much so. You always managed to keep things so brisk and professional – you were annoyed when I fell asleep in your bed, for instance. It was all very much in keeping with the boundaries of our friendship, even in spite of these rather unusual coachings. But then last night, it was so different.”
Sherlock looks at him, smiling. “Of course,” he says mildly.
“Not sure,” I say. “We could cook something. I feel like staying in.”
John clears his throat. “Indeed,” he seconds, and Justin shrugs.
needs for you to acknowledge it,” Ella tells him gently. “We can talk about the importance of you acknowledging your own needs and desires, but if that aspect of the situation isn’t speaking to you, I think that this one will. If you want to focus on what John needs, then this is it: he needs to be held accountable, and specifically by the person whom he hurt. This stuff can’t just be waved off and magically made to go away. For your forgiveness to mean something to John, it has to be the real thing, and that means acknowledging your own pain in this – in any part of this where there was an experience of pain for you. Otherwise, it isn’t real. It’s a surface patch job at best.” She picks up her notebook again and turns a new page. “So let’s get right to the heart of it, Sherlock. If you want to issue a blanket pardon to John, in order to help him let go of it and forgive himself, I suggest you take this moment right now to name what in John’s behaviour has hurt you the most.”
“Big into the word ‘no’,” John tells him, a bit ruefully. “I couldn’t get her attention for long. She did let me give her some soup, though.”
“Chrissy Jessop,” Sherlock repeats. “She’s a model, apparently. A young one. She’s now twenty-four, but was twenty-three at the time of the wedding.” He gazes expectantly at John, waiting for him to make the connection.
“Seven years,” Kyle tells him. “Can I help with something?”
It’s Sunday evening. They’ve finished dinner (butter chicken and naan from the place around the corner) and are on the sofa now, and John sighs.
The trial being over, they begin to actually plan the wedding. They never specifically said that they were waiting for that particular moment, but the day after the trial, Sherlock brings up photographers whose work he’s been looking through, and John listens to him, then mentions a few venues he’s been thinking about for them to check. They begin planning. On the surface, everything seems normal. Better than normal: good. And yet, Sherlock cannot help but feel that John is holding something back, carefully shielded from him and kept secret, and it frankly scares him. John was so open when this began, and for the first few weeks after they came home from Ravine Valley. Why would he change that now, withdraw something and hide it within himself, deliberately kept from Sherlock’s sight? He can’t even be fully certain that this is the case, but he feels it on an instinctive level.
Sherlock fed John another spoonful of oatmeal.
In a state of shock, John let Sherlock put the spoon in his mouth. Then the second. He was too ashamed of himself to admit it but his hands pretended to be helpless and wanted to rest after those endless days… Having gone back there, in his head, to those halls, stinking of char and death, John shuddered. Sherlock, meanwhile, cut off a piece of the fried egg, stabbed it with the fork and waited for the doctor to swallow the oatmeal. The yolk fell on the table.
“I don’t know what you imagined, but, yeah, I was there. Caught you a couple of times. Made you eat a couple of times. Did everything on the run actually. It was hard to keep up with you in that vortex. It’s a trivial investigation. In terms of complexity. Not consequences.”
John didn’t come home two days later, or even three days later, but a week later. Although one couldn’t even call the thing that appeared in the doorway John.
“‘Our’ wedding,” Karen corrects him.
“Is there any way to know how conclusive this testing will be?” Vee straightens the last fork, then goes back over to the counter and the salad that she’d started. She gives the spinach leaves a fresh toss, then goes to the fridge for an orange.
“Did she?” John frowns. “That seems oddly coincidental… By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask: that wedding you talked about the other day at the workshop, the destination one you said you regretted having done. Whose wedding was it?”
John’s jaw clenches visibly. “If I go,
John smiles at her, his eyes warm, and she finds herself further disarmed. Oh yes, she thinks. He’s charming, indeed. And handsomer than she thought the last time he was here. Granted, that was over a year ago now. “Thanks,” John says. He glances around the kitchen. “Is there anything I can do to help?”
Sherlock lifts his head after a bit, though, blinking down at him, his curls tousled. “I need you,” he says intensely. “Need to feel you. All of you.”
John moves his hand from Sherlock’s face to his chest, touching him through the fine material of the navy blue shirt he’s got on, unable to stop marvelling at the fact that he’s really allowed to do this – touch Sherlock, kiss him, let it all show. He thinks yet again that Ella was right – it’s difficult to believe it, difficult to let go of the need to hide it away. Sherlock responds in kind, his hand squeezing John’s upper arm, then his rib cage, fingers spread as widely as they can reach, as though trying to catalogue as much of John as he possibly can at once. John exhales hard and bends forward to suck at Sherlock’s throat, leaving marks on his jaw, tongue dragging over the heavy breath beneath Sherlock’s skin. He can feel it catch, and then Sherlock takes a sharp, deep breath. “John – ”
John nods, then finally pulls away. His eyes are wet, but he seems to be in control of himself. He searches Sherlock’s face as though trying to read it. “You too,” he says. “Good night.”
He opens his eyes, panting. “John – ”
“It does,” Sherlock concurs, gazing at the menu speculatively. “It seems like it’s kebabs of some sort. Do you want to split one? I’m not all that hungry, but I’d have some, if you wanted.”
“It’s a blank slate,” he says delicately. “Theoretical information only. Problem?”
They cross into the park and John takes pleased note of every single person who looks their way and smiles indulgently. “God, what a lot to think about,” he says as they leave the city noise behind them. “First there was last night, and now all of this… just when we’d agreed to leave the past behind us.”
Sherlock pauses, then smiles at him, warmly enough to make warmth bloom in the pit of John’s stomach. “The calamari is excellent,” he says, pushing the plate closer to John. “Try it.”
“Two blocks, one street over.” Sherlock looks up, then points. “That way.”
had been only half a joke: he had genuinely hoped that John had lingered where they were before, so that they could resume from that point.
“I’ll show you,” John says, and he does.
Ella is unconvinced. “She shot you,” she says candidly. “How does
Sherlock twists around and looks at me, now. “Don’t you?” he asks, his eyes piercing through me.
“Yeah,” John says. “I know.” He pauses, a bite of food still on his fork. “It wasn’t that I wasn’t happy,” he says, though he’s frowning in thought. “It was that I wasn’t happy about the
When we arrive, the crime scene is gory enough to keep my focus. As Lestrade said, the bodies (two of them) were indeed dissolved in acid, but only partway, and the effect is quite gruesome. Enough of both faces is left to show that they died in excruciating pain. The smell is nauseating and several of Lestrade’s team struggle overtly with it, more than one of them vomiting at some point. I hold my breath and examine what’s left of the bodies, while Sherlock listens to me and starts trying to determine what sort of acid it was and deducing what he can about the situation. There are marks on the woman’s skeletal fourth finger on her left hand that he says used to be a ring, but the man’s left hand, only partially stripped of its flesh, did not have a ring. An affair, then: pretty typical, when it comes to local crimes like these.
This stings a little, but John has the wit to glean that he’s pissed Sherlock off by pressing the whole thing. “Sorry,” he mutters. “Look – I just mean that you don’t have to. Eat dinner with me, I mean. Do what you want.”
“John… if you’re here, you know you wouldn’t need to pay for anything,” Sherlock had said quietly, carefully not looking at him, searching instead for a place to put a large, coffee table book on travel in Asia.
His hand is there then, rubbing it onto them both and it feels so good that John moans again. “God, you’re – ahhh – don’t stop – unless you want me to – ”
John shifts closer and kisses him, his nude body warm against Sherlock’s. They kiss again, again, Sherlock getting an arm wrapped firmly around John’s back. John’s erection is touching his and Sherlock arches closer to it, craving its friction. John presses into him, fumbling one-handed at the tube of lubricant at the same time. “Good thing Rosie slept so little yesterday,” he says, breathier already. “She’ll likely sleep a little later this morning.”
work, because you believed me to be a heartless machine who didn’t care about Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock says, quiet but obstinate. He can’t look at John. “For all that you ‘believed in me’ then, you still took that bait. It wasn’t my fault that Moriarty dragged it all out for as long as he did. I ran out of time. I tried, John. I tried to spare you from seeing it. But once you were there, I had to make sure that you believed it.”
I go over and collect it while trying not to look at it, per se. Fact is, I used to have one something like that. Nothing wrong with enjoying a little prostate stimulation, I always said. It’s there for a reason, right? Biology didn’t have to make it feel good. (And yeah, even
John rolled his cramped shoulders, they’d been researching this case for hours now. Leaning against the concrete wall on a twin bed wasn’t the most comfortable position.
Suddenly, his dream of becoming a world-wide known doctor didn’t seem so far or extravagant now.
b) All the choices are correct
c) Studying the bullet's trajectory
Sherlock shook his head. “No, I figured it out.”
First and foremost, the boy was undeniably a genius. He also had a bit of a death wish. Sherlock didn’t care about boundaries, or any of the unwritten rules of society. He had a sharp mouth that made ruthless and cutting deductions at the expense of others. Even to John, he could be cruel and thoughtless. For a fifteen year old, Sherlock was extremely cold in appearance. Sherlock could go 48 hours straight with no sleep and accomplish things that should take months with anyone else.
“Are you a first year?”
Finally, the day arrived. Mr. Verdue and numerous train attendents ushered his class into the car. It was an eight hour journey. John watched as a laughing Sherlock climbed onto the train, with, as expected, Victor trailing. They sat two rows in front of John, and John clenched his jaw when Victor got closer and closer to Sherlock.
Indignation crossed over Sherlock’s face and John laughed harder. “Alright, but it was accident,” Sherlock protested, “I wouldn’t have actually let our dorm explode.”
Everything was.
Just then, Irene slinked over to the seats across from him, dragging Mike with her, and Greg came over to swoop Molly into a hug, kissing her cheek. John chuckled as she blushed red and turned to kiss him properly, and he could hear Irene whistle next to them.
After spending nearly a year of sharing a room with Sherlock and following the boy everywhere, John had concluded several important things.
They got into the hotel, and Mr. Verdue was running frantically from one reception desk to another, trying to get everything settled before people started complaining (too late). The chatter in the lobby rose and John felt sick as he watched Victor pull Sherlock into the far corner, fingers dancing over his collar and the hem of his shirt, and Sherlock, who John could make out laughing and wrapping his arms around Victor. John tore his eyes away and told himself to get a grip. Yes, enjoy Edinburgh! He’d never been before. He looked around the lobby, ah yes, a chandelier. There were also, two, three, four, no, seven leafy plants.
I can’t just stop trying. I can’t let my whole world revolve around you Sherlock. I need someone else to distract me from you. JW
John was in the garden, crouched by a statue. Ironically, one of cupid and his stupid bow and arrow. He was frustrated and sad and…
Mary stepped in their dorm and shut the door. John raised his eyebrows. She came closer and perched on the edge of his bed. “I texted Greg. He won’t be here for another three hours,” Mary said, playing with the hem of her top. “We could find a way to pass the time.” She looked at John from under her lashes.
on Ebay.
Sherlock didn’t say anything to that.
d) The male skull has a more rounded chin
“Do you understand?” Mr. Brooks asked slowly, looking at John as if he were the most devolved, uncivilized person on earth.
John sighed, expecting it. Irene was never one for delicacy. Or subtlety. Or just general social cues.
John grinned. “Are you always right about people?”
John tried not to gape as they walked in.
John groaned, burying his face in his hands. Why was he so afraid? Logically he knew that even if Sherlock rejected him in that way, they would remain friends. Their bond went deeper than a superficial attraction, but he couldn’t bear to imagine the look of disgust on Sherlock’s face if he told him the truth.
“Goddamnit Sherlock,” John cursed under his breath. But Sherlock would not let it go.
“So, wanna be roommates again?” John asked, grinning goofily at Sherlock.
“There’d be people.” Sherlock said, looking dismayed at the mere thought, “Of course I don’t want that.”
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully.
“You know our project is due tomorrow right?” John said flatly in the car
The next four weeks passed by agonizingly slowly as John rehearsed over and over and over again in his head what he’d say to Sherlock. It became a mantra to chant in his head. He envisioned how Sherlock would respond. Would he laugh in his face? Would he tell John it was too late, that he’d already fallen in love with Victor? Or would he look at him with pity, the particular kind Sherlock reserved for a rather sad looking stray cat. It consumed his every thought, but the one fantasy he didn’t dare on linger on was Sherlock smiling and embracing him. The thought twisted his heart in ways that terrified John.
It was Thursday, and John once again found himself abandoning his homework in the middle of the night, and sneaking off to god-knows where with Sherlock Holmes.
So John continued, trying to get it all out. “That’s why I did so much stupid shit, I wanted you so badly that I was scared by it,” John huffed, “I was skipping out on school to be with you, I didn’t care about anything else but you. And... that was terrifying.”
John had been considering something, but he wasn’t sure. He decided to run it past Sherlock first, but he had already guessed what his response would probably be.
If it weren’t for Sherlock Holmes, John would’ve said that his first year at Newberry Academy was rather uneventful.
Mary sighed and got up off the bed. She leaned down and kissed him quickly before grabbing her purse that she’d dumped on the ground earlier. “I’ll talk to you tonight,” she said, resignation in her voice.
“I want to get to know you better. You’ve got every detail of me memorized.”
Because, I fucking love you Sherlock Holmes. JW
A smile played on the corner of John’s lips as he recalled the irony of that conversation with the boy who seemed to know everything.
And worse yet. John thought morbidly, what if he did feel the same way? What if they went out, and it was perfect and John had no doubt that they would be compatible in that way, in every way, but what if then.. it didn’t work.
“Oh are you jealous John?” Sherlock said, with a sarcastic twist of his lips that made John so frustrated.
Feel free to skip this note if you'd like, it's a bit long.
John nodded. In the few short hours since he met Mike, he’s told him about Melinda, his girlfriend and how they were fighting.
John climbed into the bed and was about to drift off into sleep when he realized something was off.
John clenched his teeth. “But I do.”
He got accepted.
Momentarily relieved that there were almost no students in the hallway, he sighed and tried to calm down.
“Didn’t patch things up with Sherlock then?” Greg asked delicately, as if the wrong phrase would send John off sobbing in a corner. To be fair, John wasn’t that far off from it.
He blinked.
His vision blurred as he read the words over and over again. He couldn’t believe it.
3. The time of death can be calculated by various means. One is rigor mortis, Latin for 'the stiffness of death'. Another indication is livor mortis or lividity. What does this term refer to?
“My brother, Mycroft,” Sherlock started to explain once his fits of laughter had calmed enough. “That pompous arsehole started having a love affair with black umbrellas five years ago, and I’ve been making fun of him ever since. He would love this.”
“Sherlock,” John repeated, more firmly this time. “It’s fine.”
“Mmhm?”
“I wasn’t sure if you liked Italian,” John admitted, “I was a bit worried.”
Irene snorted, leaning forward. “Come on, you guys practically spend every waking second together.” She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. “And maybe some non-waking seconds.”
Sherlock grinned. “It’s a lot more fun.”
But it wasn’t the beauty or intellectual standards of the school that kept popping up in his dreams.
Still, it was impossible to not notice.
John chuckled. “Are you at school?”
“Don’t you dare. I knew picking you as a lab partner again was a mistake.”
Luckily, their dorm room came with a coffee maker, and an electric kettle, plus a daily supply of water in the water cooler.
He ignored it.
John didn’t know how to absorb all of this. Sherlock. Sherlock. Sherlock liked him? He felt a wave of guilt crash over him at the expression on Sherlock’s face. Yeah, he was a dumbass.
John raised his hand, staring somewhat nervously at the rich mahogany oak door. He knocked on the door, looking at the shiny golden plaque with dread rolling through his stomach.
Sherlock kept goading him, “why do you care about Victor?”
John smiled, “Yes, but catch me up on your life anyways.”
“No,” Sherlock insisted, almost desperate, and to John it was like a knife through his stomach. Did Sherlock hate him that much? “I can’t go on this trip unless I have a different roommate.”
He stopped his circling of the living room and smiled sheepishly at his mother.
That was strange, John thought. He stared at his phone for a while, thinking about what just happened. After a minute, John shook his head, as if to clear his thoughts, and left the dorm to find Sherlock.
Irene turned to John. “I’m rooming with Kate,” she said with a wink, “I know I’ll be having a lot of fun.”
It’s almost three am. I’m probably not making any sense.
“His brother.”
John blinked and looked up, surprised to see Molly standing by him. She was wringing her hands and clearly concerned.
John watched as Sherlock came alive under the florescent lights and glass exhibits, ironic as it was. Sherlock jumped from one case to the next, making John’s head spin as he tried to process all these crimes.
After some promises from Sherlock that the police wouldn’t be able to trace it back to John’s laptop because he was taking down the firewall and other technicalities that John couldn’t understand, Sherlock was opening up the entire archival collection and police reports of Scotland Yard.
“Yeah,” John said. “Yeah I’m fine.”
He didn’t glance at the clock as he replied, “Five minutes after seven.”
“His brother.”
He momentarily stopped thumbing through the folders to turn and look at John. “I gave you the option of not coming.”
He had a week to get used to the confusing school grounds, but he had been following a student and stupidly not paying attention to the hallways.
“Our little fairy’s all grown up, aww,” Anderson cooed.
John thought he could still feel the lingering warmth from their hug, and suddenly he felt an overwhelming urge to chase after that black car. He wouldn’t be seeing Sherlock for two months and John didn’t want to let go of him for even a second.
Sherlock looked surprised, and John instantly blushed when he realized what he said.
“I should go John, the liver’s going to explode in twenty seconds if I don’t go get it.”
“Because,” John tried to start, not even knowing what to say, how to explain.
“Oh.” That was all John could say.
When John stepped into the classroom, all twenty eyes fixed onto him and Sherlock.
“That’s bullshit,” Molly said, quietly but with enough force that John’s eyes widened, staring at her.
After he got home, John grabbed a book and sat down on his bed.
“But look at the coloring. The bruising was clearly post-mortem.”
When John got back to their dorm, he leaned against the door and groaned. “What the hell just happened?”
They called the first floor “the maze” for a reason.
After orientation week wrapped up, John went home more excited than ever about the school. In his eyes, it was the dream school.
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, tore all those walls down and revealed a boy who now itched at the prospect of breaking boundaries no matter the consequences. A boy who now wanted to never stop running, never stop following the mad man, Sherlock Holmes.
Memories of his dad sitting up with him by his bed in the middle of the night to read aloud medical journals to John floated into his mind, and a small smile made its way onto John’s mouth.
“Yes,” John said finally. “I do.” Before Sherlock could say anything else John continued, “I know that you hate me, and that you’re with Victor, but. I do. I have for a long time.”
John would be able to remember exactly the way a tall boy looked as he delicately dragged his bow across the maroon violin, a brilliant contrast against his marble like skin. The way he rocked ever so slightly to the alluring sounds drifting from his violin.
“I’m not the bad guy here. Mr. Holmes is poisoning you.”
John couldn’t have been more relieved when they finally got back to their dorm. The door shut with a soft click, and John felt all the energy of the night drain out of him. He groggily finished his night routine, and climbed into his bed. Distantly, he was aware that Sherlock was still standing there, looking out the window. John was too tired to care, and he soon drifted off into sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
(Sat 1:06am)
“Sherlock,” John hissed.
Even though he would have far less time to read them once he starts attending Newberry, he made a plan to bring back one book each weekend he goes back home.
Silence followed.
(Sat 12:11am)
“I’m heading to that class as well.”
He’d always felt in those moments that he was as happy as one could be, just talking with Sherlock Holmes.
“Please,” John murmured, “I’ve missed you so much.”
Not to mention dangerous. After he exclaimed to Sherlock that they were fifteen and far too young to chase after criminals in the dead of the night, he was met with an eye roll.
She’s not brain dead, and I do have a life outside of you. Well I try. JW
(Sat 2:56am)
John wasn’t really surprised.
Room 1158? That way, or is it to the left?! John thought frantically.
However, that didn’t stop it from having its social boundaries and shortcomings. It was the way a student chose to act that placed them in social groups.
Sherlock wasn’t short the last time John saw him, far from it. But he also wasn’t impossibly lean and tall either.
Or had been more stunned.
“Also correct. Lastly, what are the characteristic features of peripheral nerves?”
(Sat 12:14am)
John sat on his bed and opened his laptop, scrolling through his emails. Reminders from teachers… An email from his coach, rugby practice tomorrow… Counselor appointment next Wednesday… Dull. It was all so dull.
(Sat 1:49am)
John heard a faint beep from Sherlock’s side.
(Sat 12:06am)
John couldn’t hear what the police officer was saying to Sherlock, but it was making Sherlock impatient.
John knew it was an impossible task, staying away from Sherlock Holmes. Even if they didn’t share a room, Sherlock was a magnet, and John was hopelessly pulled to him. Falling in love with his mad roommate who has the emotional capacity of a two year old with the knowledge of two encyclopedias should’ve been insane. But it doesn’t feel strange. That’s the worst part. It felt so natural, and John was terrified that one day he’d just slip up and lean in to kiss Sherlock, effectively ruining the connection they had. Their friendship wasn’t perfect, far from it, and John knows clearly just what makes it so messed up, but he wouldn’t change it.
“Yes!” Sherlock’s voice brightened. “We can get so much more done if you stay over the weekend!”
Sherlock was practically glowing as he hammered out the last sentence. He slammed the folder shut and put it back in the cabinet.
“For two weeks.”
He smiled. “We find the killer.”
Sherlock slowed his pace and half turned to face John. He cocked his head and something sparkled in his pale eyes. “You played the violin?”
John and a couple of their friends groaned. Good luck to Kate, there were very few people who could resist Irene when she decided she wanted them. John was just glad that she’d never really tried to pull Sherlock; that would’ve been awkward.
John rolled his eyes, fairy, of course, how creative. They called Sherlock every degrading name their feeble minds could come up with.
John felt the blush on his cheek deepen, and the tips of his ears flushing warmly.
Sherlock shook his head and laid down some of the comforters on the carpet, “Oh I’m alright, I’ll just sleep on these.”
The woman got up and shook John’s hand. “Best of luck Mr. Watson.”
John tilted his head up so he could see Sherlock’s face. “But this doesn’t change anything, you know that right? We’ll always be friends,” John said.
“Wait—” Sherlock shook with giggles. “—your history teacher actually made you go do a hundred jumping jacks outside because you answered it correctly?”
His eyes widened. “That’s not healthy Sherlock. ”
Three weeks later, like a wheel spinning again, he grew tired of it.
Less than three percent of those who apply are ever accepted, and they were the most prodigious, talented and all-out flawless teens in Britain.
and settled into an old armchair in the living room. As he read the introduction, John once again found his thoughts drifting to Sherlock Holmes.
“So, when are you leaving?” he asked.
It was a bit silly how flustered John got just by having Sherlock so close to him. He was grateful that the classroom was dark, it hid the dark blush on his cheeks.
And then…
Jesus. Why? JW
Sherlock Holmes, in a mere week, peeled back all those layers of that innocent blue-eyed boy who teachers always adored, the boy who obediently did his work and was polite to everyone, the boy who could’ve never imagined chasing after a violent psychopath at three in the morning.
So the next day John came up with an idea. It was a stupid idea, no doubt. But an idea.
If fifteen years later someone asked John exactly what happened on that day, he wouldn’t be able to tell them a thing about the movie they watched. He wouldn’t be able to remember the classroom, who the teacher was, or any of his other classmates in that room with him. Classmates who he had once called his closest friends.
Then a familiar voice rumbled behind him, “Looks like we’ll be spending a lot of time together, John Watson.”
“John, who are you rooming with?” Irene asked, turning her attention back to him.
Irene squinted at him for a moment, looking thoughtful. She must’ve saw the pleading on his face though, and dropped it.
They finished all their homework and started the initial research on their forensics project together around 2:30 am. John sighed and realized that he’d get about four hours of sleep at most.
“Shut. Up,” John hissed. “Don’t say that, I always care about you.”
She was great, but I can’t imagine anything beyond friendship with her. JW
(Sat 2:50am)
Sherlock shook his head, “No,” he said, a hint of laughter in his voice, “he’s straight as a pole, and I talked his ear off about you all the time.”
“Probably around 6:15, class starts at 7:30 and I need to drop my stuff off and eat breakfast with you.”
John hoped that he’d be able to make Sherlock’s 16
“I haven’t forgiven you,” Sherlock said.
“We should head back.” John said.
The room was quiet for a moment, everyone thinking.
The teacher narrowed his eyes and studied Sherlock for a moment. After some pondering, he nodded slowly. “Alright. The next time you are late to my class, you’ll receive a detention. Since it’s the first day of school, I’ll let it slide.”
He looked up at those remarkable eyes and held Sherlock’s gaze. John felt significantly more bold.
(Sat 12:42am)
“Oh,” John said, “That makes sense. Sherlock’s told me a lot about you.”
John wondered why Sherlock was in this class. He should be at least a second year, since he was in advanced orchestra.
Sherlock stood up slowly and walked in front of John, forcing John to look at him. “And why not?” Sherlock’s voice was challenging, but John could hear the faint tremors hidden under his steady tone.
“What are your intentions with Sherlock Holmes?
“Turn left, walk to the end of the hall, then take a right. It should be the first room you see.”
“Good. Sometimes I play for hours and into the night. I can put the muffler on, but it dilutes the sound and I prefer to play without it. If it bothers you, I suppose you could schedule a meeting with the headmaster and apply for a new room-mate, but…” Sherlock trailed off.
She left John, casually walking away like she hadn’t just thrown a bomb at him.
“Don’t you ever get tired?” John asked.
He stood no chance from his application alone. There was nothing remotely spectacular about his academics, nor his extra-curricular, par from occasional wins the school rugby matches. No, all John had going for him was this interview.
John spent most of the time avoiding relatives and wondering what Sherlock was up to. Sure they texted a lot, but it wasn’t quite like the real thing. He looked forward to the little, inane texts that Sherlock would send him at all times of day.
John could see the smile Sherlock was trying to hide in his cappuccino.
He started going back to his original passion of becoming a doctor, studying the books that he meant to read during the school year. Now, without Sherlock by his side, John begun to find it impossible and ridiculous that he could have ever abandoned his studies completely.
a) DNA fingerprinting
Sherlock shrugged. “I guess.”
“I’m conducting an experiment on the mold found in showers,” Sherlock said brightly, and John grinned.
Later John wouldn’t be able to remember the name of the piece, or how it ended. He wouldn’t be able to remember whether it was gentle, or harsh, or if it was light or dark.
“Well, Greg’s told me a lot about you two.” He turned towards Sherlock. “You’re the genius right?”
“I-“ John didn’t know what to say. He didn’t even see a point in denying it anymore.
“This is, the best present. I. ” Sherlock seemed to be for once, without words. It was worth it, owing Greg a thousand favors to get them into this museum, just to see the astonished look on Sherlock’s face.
John would be able to tell them how it all happened.
His eyes widened. “Are you seriously telling me that you cannot drink coffee unless you add in the two sugars yourself?”
1.	It was his fault that he lost Sherlock Holmes.
Less than five minutes later, John felt Sherlock’s hand nudge against him.
Ergo, fascination with dead things. But that aside, if you really think my type is people with peculiar and potentially dangerous people, why do I, according to you, “keep bringing back brain dead girls.” JW
Sherlock blinked. “Yes?”
Sherlock half the time would sit at this table, and the other half would go to do research or something alike. Sometimes he dragged John along.
“The third one, isn’t that an unsolved case?”
(Sat 1:13am)
Briefly contains homophobic slurs.
When John woke up the next morning, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. That was pretty normal, since it was a Sunday. Sherlock was probably in the lab. John got up and headed for the coffee machine.
John took a deep breath, unclenched his fists, and wondered for the hundredth time how they got into Newberry.
“What is it?”
Irene, who’d been standing next to him and witnessed the whole spectacle, including the idiot and Victor flirting in the corner, nudged John.
“We’ll hang out tonight, okay? John said, rubbing his hands up and down her arms. “But I have a lot of homework I have to catch up on before class starts tomorrow.” A lie, but he just really didn’t want to be next to her right now.
He walked straight into the cupid arrow.
It sucked. It completely sucked. John would find himself waiting for Sherlock after classes, only to tear himself away when he realized he was doing it. He would get two cups of coffee only to remember Sherlock wasn’t there and casually hand it off to Greg.
The school he was at would not help him get into Cambridge and become a doctor. His social studies teacher was also his gym teacher. His math teacher was also his English teacher.
Sherlock stopped in front of an black, inconspicuous looking umbrella that had a lethal blade sticking out from its bottom. Sherlock stared for a moment and then laughed, turning to John and his eyes shining with amusement. John was confused and cocked his head, the
He started pacing again.
John blushed furiously and waved his hand, “it’s was never and it’s not going to be like that,” he muttered. “Can you just drop it.”
“Just wondering if you wanted to room together next year,” John said quickly.
John laughed and turned to him fully, “Oh? Like that time you almost blew up our microwave.”
When John and Sherlock made it to the entrance, a tall uniformed man was waiting.
And from the back of the room came a drawl. “Sherlock Holmes.”
Already, he could feel Sherlock becoming an addictive drug to him.
“Have you taken on any more cases?” John asked, feeling more at ease now as they walked down the hall towards their room.
b) All the choices are correct
“By work you don’t actually mean homework.”
“Catalina Blue.”
He felt a warm blossom of fondness at Sherlock’s words, and he resisted the urge to touch those soft-looking curls.
By the end of eighth period, John could hardly believe that it was a mere nine hours ago when he kissed his mom goodbye, dropped his bags off in the theatre, and proceeded to get lost in the hallways.
“Of course,” Sherlock replied quickly, but John could see the relief spread across his features. Sherlock shifted ever so slightly and looked at John, and then suddenly they were so close. John could see the individual lashes fluttering against Sherlock’s cheek, and he could hear Sherlock’s shallow breathing. Sherlock’s pupils were blown wide, and John felt it, the magnetic pull of Sherlock that John could never resist.
Sherlock knew of practically every murder committed in the last century, yet he didn’t know who the Prime Minister was.
(Sat 12:20am)
(Sat 12:54am)
An hour later, he slammed his laptop shut and groaned.
“Well of course. But you don’t care about us like that. You don’t know what you look like when you see Sherlock.” She laughed, shaking her head. “It’s blindingly obvious how much you like him.
Sherlock laughed, a sharp, mocking sound. “As if you gave me another choice. You pushed me away.”
“You two are roommates, and I have eyes and ears around the school.”
“Then it’s only logical that we be partners. I’ve made it a personal interest to study past criminal cases. Between my vast knowledge of well, everything” John arched a skeptical eyebrow at that, “and your obsession with becoming a doctor, we would easily have the best project in this class.”
She sighed again. “Boys. So oblivious. It’s obvious that you love him. I’ve seen the way you look at him. You light up when he’s around, in a way that you never do when you’re around Greg, Molly, or me. And every time you—“
He panted and tried to catch his breath, whilst watching Sherlock rattle off to the police on the phone. After what seemed like an eternity of explaining what case it was, who the killer is, and the victim, Sherlock finally got to the location.
But, as John grew to understand, he didn’t want to mundane. He didn’t want the life shown in high school movies. He wanted Sherlock, and everything he meant.
John rolled his eyes, “wouldn’t put it past you,” he smiled widely at Sherlock, feeling a bubble of happiness in his chest.
“I did not faint,” John huffed. “I was just surprised. Do you have any sense of privacy?”
John could only nod, his face starting to burn.
It was Tuesday night, and after a mere day and a half of knowing each other, they were huddled together on Sherlock’s bed and breaking god-knows how many laws his laptop.
“How I obtained this knowledge is none of your business. This is an anonymous tip and if you would just use your brain for one second, you’ll know to send officers to this location right away instead of sitting there acting like a complete moron.” Sherlock’s tone was sharp and cutting, and it made John flinch slightly even though he knew it wasn’t directed at him.
Sherlock blinked. “I finished that months ago.”
“What’s your favorite color?”
“I wasn’t about to let you sneak into Scotland Yard alone. We are partners for the damn project.”
So it wasn’t exactly a surprise what happened on John’s first day back.
Molly and Mike looked really confused, but Irene and Greg knew what he was referring to and their eyes lit up. “That’d be perfect for Sherlock,” she said.
“Yes, Mr. Brooke. I’ll try harder from now on.”
Winter break was boring without Sherlock.
Tomorrow, tomorrow we talk face to face about this like adults? JW
John faltered in his frantic calculations for a second before starting up again. “I am,” John said. “I’m really happy.”
“My father is an English teacher at a high school, so he’s busy most of the time.”
“Bored.”
He shrugged. “Not my problem. You asked me for black coffee with two sugars. That’s what I made. If you want another cup, go make it yourself.”
He hated this, this impasse between he and Sherlock where everything felt like it was on the edge of tumbling into something new and terrifying, and the uncertainty of what it would mean for them.
The school year was coming to an end, and John threw himself and all his frustration into rugby once the homework load eased. He couldn’t have any free, empty time. John would only be able to think about Sherlock and dig himself into a hole of self-pity and guilt.
And then. They were holding hands and Sherlock was resting against him and this is in the middle of a renaissance documentary and John would laugh at how silly this all was if it weren’t for the maddening pressure on his chest and the feeling of
Mr. Brooke folded his hands and focused the full intensity of his stare at John. “This is the best boarding school in Britain, Mr. Watson. We have high standards here, and while I cannot legally punish you for your performance this year, I am warning you that if this continues to happen, your future at Newberry will be very bleak.”
John sighed and poked at his food, keeping a humorous smile on his face. Oh what he wouldn’t do for it all to be true.
John was a coward. Plain and simple. He’d always criticized Sherlock for not expressing himself, for bottling up his emotions and coming across as cold. But he’d been blind to the fire in Sherlock’s eyes when they kissed, the way his voice cracked when he asked John why they couldn’t be together. There was passion and anger and brilliance pouring out of him every second, begging to be noticed. John just couldn’t see it past the boy he’d painted over Sherlock.
His heart started pounding. It felt heavy, John thought hopefully as he weighed the envelope in his hand.
Sherlock started pacing and mouthed the word “imbecile” to John while rolling his eyes. John almost smiled at this.
Yelping from both the shock and pain of the stone digging into his chest, he stumbled and fell on his arse.
He nodded and the two boys set off running down the street again, with the sound of police sirens behind them.
(Sat 2:29am)
How’d the experiment go? JW
It was the first day of orientation at Newberry Academy and today they were going to the auditorium to watch a performance by the advanced orchestra.
Sherlock laughed. “Of course not. I’ve found a new burglary case that you might be interested in helping me with. The security footage hasn’t been tampered with, yet there isn’t a single trace of the burglar on the tape.”
“Yes. I’ve always been fascinated by the human anatomy. My father was a doctor, and so was my grandfather.”
Dread and euphoria washed over John as he double checked that he read it correctly.
“Congratulations John on your game. Though of course I still think it’s a foolish game with—“
John glared at him. “We are breaking curfew, sneaking out of campus, and breaking about fifty different laws right now. All for a school project?!”
d) Trying felony cases
“How are things with Mary?” Greg asked. John was busy with his calculus homework, scribbling in his notebook and not really paying attention to Greg, who was sitting on the end of his bed and looking at John with concern. He'd been trying to make small talk with him for the past ten minutes.
Their walk back to Newberry was quiet, and John found himself discreetly peeking at Sherlock every other minute. John was sure that Sherlock noticed this, and half expected Sherlock to snap at him, but neither John or Sherlock broke the heavy curtain of silence between them.
9. If you know what to look for, you can tell a male from a female skull. Which of the following statements is FALSE?
She waited a moment, scrutinizing his overly exuberant smile. “You look sad when you think no one sees you.”
“Uh. The summer in France, changed you.” John said nervously, blushing even more as he struggled to not stammer. Why was he acting so strange around his best friend? So what if Sherlock looked like a teenage male model now, he was still the same Sherlock.
John wished he couldn’t relate.
“We spent three and a half hours in there,” John said, but not finding himself to be tired at all.
“You’re a medical student, you have two, no, one sister. You come from a middle class background. Your father was a medical man as well, and you want to follow his footsteps. Your sister is a drunk, but you continue to support her. Your mother approves of your ambitions but she wishes that you would relax once in a while. You are extremely excited to attend this school and you haven’t been sleeping well in the past few days due to your anticipation."
John was startled. “What are you talking about?” Sherlock couldn’t have possibly deduced the phone call.
“And they’re both dreadfully normal. I can’t stand staying at home for more than a couple days.” Sherlock finished.
“I’m just trying to not invade your space John,” Sherlock snapped.
The worst part wasn’t the relentless gossip about Sherlock, or the glances every time they walked through the hallways. He could stand that. If they wanted to stare, fine.
John couldn’t decide if he wanted to slap him or laugh hysterically.
“You are 15 years old, correct?”
The two boys nodded and walked over to a small booth.
2. In October 1974 part of a male torso was found floating in the River Thames in England. Several parts, including the head and hands, were missing so police could not use the usual methods of fingerprints, facial features and dental records to identify the corpse. How was it eventually identified?
John had an idea. Sherlock had a morbid sense of humor, he would appreciate crime memorabilia that an especially clever serial killer may have owned or used.
“Fun?!”
When they finally pulled away for air, John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s and exhaled slowly.
They stayed up until well-past curfew talking and it seemed that John was constantly stuck between being utterly gobsmacked with Sherlock’s brilliance, or breaking out in bouts of laughter at his dry humor.
John couldn’t help but imagine what it would be like to be in Newberry, to belong to an school that prestigious.
Thank you. JW
“I’m glad you like it, it took me a while to figure out what present to get you,” John admitted.
Sherlock cocked his head, brows furrowing. “I’m fine John. Surely that’s not what you wanted to talk to me about.”
(Sat 12:22am)
John stared at him “Well, if what you’re saying is true—“
John knew it was an impossible task, staying away from Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock was a magnet, and John was hopelessly pulled to him.
John didn’t know how long he sat there for, but he did know that he was panicking. When someone slipped down next to him quietly, John wasn’t surprised.
He nodded and tried handing it to Sherlock again.
Molly nodded. “Everyone in this class is.”
Finally. JW
“You guys have three years to work this out. And I am confident that you will.”
John’s voice lowered teasingly. “Then I plan to be as mysterious as possible. Wouldn’t want you to get too confident.”
John was going to ask Molly when a girl came over and paired up with her instead. John turned and scanned the room for anyone who was still free.
d) Skeletal characteristics demonstrated on x-ray
(Sat 12:36am)
It was bewildering and almost painful, how much he wished Sherlock was here.
“Not to worry John. I’ll flick some of the cat urine we’re working with at you if you start to fall asleep.”
When the last hum from the orchestra drew to a slow stop, John stood up and clapped until his hands were sore.
When they did finally kiss, it wasn’t so much of a kiss as a simple brush of their lips, and when John became aware of what exactly he was going, he jerked away instantly.
John’s breathing stopped for a second, and then forced himself to continue as if nothing was wrong. “Because you’re my friend.”
“It’s my favorite.”
Sherlock shrugged and continued his search through the file cabinet.
I’m so sorry. JW
He sat up and looked over, expecting to see Sherlock in bed as well. Instead he appeared to be standing and staring off into space. His lamp was still on.
d) Blood spatter analysis
John shook his hand. “Nice to meet you. Thank you so much for letting us go in. I know it’s not really allowed.”
Sherlock half turned towards John and a small smile flickered, gone as fast as it came. “You.”
(Sat 12:09am)
It doesn’t. JW
“Why don’t you go back to your house over the weekend then?” John asked
“Alright.”
And now, there he was, leaning against a statue and feeling as if his world had come crashing down. Again. Always because of Sherlock.
Ever since that night at the Black Museum, there had been little incidents, little clues that filled John with hope that maybe Sherlock felt the same way. Looks and longing gazes that went on for longer than what was appropriate, and then the little bumps of their hands that made Sherlock jump like he was electrocuted.
John coughed and shuffled. “Yes.”
Sherlock’s was quiet for a few moments as he stared at John, and John knew Sherlock was trying to read him.
“Right,” John said quietly. He was acting like a complete fool. No wonder Sherlock was avoiding him. God, what happened to them? What happened to the late night conversations in their dorm, the thrill of their cases? And their kiss. The barely-there kiss between them that still haunts John whenever Mary kisses him.
He didn’t know how it even happened, but they were prodding each other repeatedly and then their fingers were tangling and then their pinkies hooked together. And John’s heart was pounding so loudly he thought the whole class could hear it, and it was absolutely ridiculous but Sherlock was so close to him and his hand was large and warm.
John remembers that one so clearly. It was late at night, like most of their cases (adventures), and somehow they’d ended up at the beach. It was a stunning night, and the Thames was quiet, waves rocking gently against the shores. They actually had figured out who the killer was, and after Sherlock made the call to Scotland Yard, they were content to just stay on the lakeside for a bit. They were so far away from the center of London that John could actually see the stars, and he had grabbed Sherlock’s arm excitedly, pointing up to the Big Dipper. There was so much. So much that could have, that didn’t, happen that night, and John remembers stolen glances and the shine of Sherlock’s eyes in the moonlight, brushes of fingertips and soft smiles.
“Moran?” Mike asked, grateful for the change in topic. “That kid’s crazy!”
“Yes,” everyone said in unison.
“Mm.” Mycroft didn’t seem convinced.
John’s head snapped up and tried to glare at Sherlock, but his amusement was barely contained in those blue eyes. “Don’t you dare. Let’s go, you git.”
“Hey,” she said gently but firmly, “don’t think like that. I might not know how Sherlock thinks, hell, who does. He’s a mystery. But I know that he cares so much for you, far more then anyone would think he is capable of."
John smiled, reaching over to clasp Sherlock’s hand. “God, I was so jealous of him. Whenever I saw you and Victor together I just kept wishing that it was me and not him.”
“So, school ends next week.” Mr. Brooke started, opening the folder and laying out several sheets of paper. “These are your grades from this year.”
“Yeah,” John said. He didn’t think he could stand much more of the pity on their faces. John said bye to them quickly and left.
“According to the coroner’s report—” John flipped back to the file, “—asphyxiation was the cause of death, hence the bruising and damage around throat.”
John kept twitching and internally groaning throughout the lunch, he could never keep secrets from Sherlock. It would take a miracle to fool his best friend.
“Radial artery, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum superficialis, ulnar artery, medial to which is the ulnar nerve, and flexor carpi ulnaris.”
John smiled, pleasantly surprised. “Thanks.”
John blinked blearily. A face fuzzily came into view. Some part of his sleepy brain recognized that it was Sherlock, whose face was currently only several inches away from John’s.
He had walked away when Irene stood up and shook her head, her lips pursued. “Boys.”
I still don’t know what you want me to do about my dates. You clearly won’t leave them alone. JW
If John had been drinking something, he would’ve choked just then. It was alarming that he’d been practically day-dreaming about how elegant he looked with that damn violin just moments ago.
Christmas came and all John could think about was Sherlock alone in their dorm. John didn’t really know all the details about the estranged relationship Sherlock had with the rest of his family, since he would clamp up every time John asked. And considering that phone call John had with Mycroft, John couldn’t really blame Sherlock for not wanting to speak wish him.
