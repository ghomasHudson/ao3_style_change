Cas tried not to think about what the Empty had said to him- it really didn’t matter- he was meant to follow Dean to the ends of the earth, and by his Father, that’s what he would do.
“Look here, Cas,”  Raphael paused while Cas had his arms full of boxes, making him set them down on a nearby table.  “Long as I’ve known you, you’ve played your cards very close to the chest.  I don’t need to be psychic to know you had some bad shit happen in your past.  But this one seems like something special.  Put the cards on the table, and let the chips fall where they may, oh fuck, that’s enough of that tired metaphor.”
Dean huffed in frustration, and grabbed Cas by the shoulders, noting the way Cas’s cheeks flushed.
“Yes...technically he is my brother’s son, but my brother was...not a good person.  He’s deceased now, but we’ve- Dean, his brother Sam, their mom Mary, and I- have had Jack since he was born.  He was orphaned, his mother having passed as well, and we have done our best to raise him.”
He could tell Cas wasn’t fooled for a minute.  But his shoulders sagged and he turned back to Dean from his cleaning.  “All right, my shift’s over in five minutes, and my date’s not until later, so…”
Dean blushed despite his brother not being able to see exactly where he was.
Dean furrowed his brow.  Now Cas cared?
Dean was speeding up, and Cas gritted his teeth, wanting to wait to come when Dean did so he could feel the way he clenched, like he had around his fingers so tightly as he climaxed.
Dean glanced around the room, cursing his naturally observant hunter’s eye for taking so much information at just a flick of a glance.  The store was clean and well lit, unlike other seedy joints Dean had been in before.  There were shelves in the center of the room with well organized dvd’s, a magazine rack (with Dean’s favorite,
“You want me to fuck you?” He growled.  Dean nodded fervently.  “You need me to prep you more?  Because I don’t want to hurt you, or anything.”
Dean rolled over, the sun harsh in his eyes.  He reached out a hand and caught the edge of the curtain and yanked it, closing the gap.  He groaned.  Movement was not a good thing.
Dean came alive and kissed Cas slowly, this time much sweeter.  Cas embraced the man tightly and tilted his head to deepen the kiss.  Dean moaned and shifted, making Cas slide out.  He reached back and pulled the condom from himself where it tried to stay in.
“Well, I watch a lot of gay porn, okay?  Turns out real life is actually pretty close to porn.”  The shame was leaving him quickly.
“Is that it?” Dean asked, lifting his towel and looking suspicious.
Cas could feel Dean tighten around him, already nearing orgasm, roughly calling out Cas’s name over and over, like a prayer, until he came with a shout, spurting between their bellies, his hole squeezing and releasing Cas until it dragged him over the edge.  He pushed in one final time and filled Dean, come pumping hotly into him, marking him, claiming him.
Cas felt his stomach twist and he rolled his hips, gaining friction.
It wasn’t enough.  He stood from the bed and went into the small bathroom, running the cold water in the shower, and stepped in, hissing as the icy water stung his heated flesh.  It was bringing him back to the present a little.  He needed to just hang on, soon he’d be fine, and he would be able to just go back to the bunker, and everything would go back to normal.
“Ezekiel is dead, Dean.  It happened some time ago.  Are you sure he said Ezekiel?”
“A tattoo?”  He blurted, standing and moving closer to Cas, pausing with an outstretched hand, almost running his finger along it as if
Cas had several orgasms before he gave up and went to the kitchen for some coffee.  He made the decision to give the next plug to Dean in a few days so he could enjoy the first one for a while.
“My Grace is gone.  What did you expect?  Do you have any idea how hard it was?  When I fell to Earth, I didn’t just lose my powers.  I - I had nothing.”  The implications behind that statement had Dean wanting to crawl in a hole.  “Now...I’m a sales associate.”  The pride in his voice was painful to hear.
a virgin.
But if he had knocked, he would have missed seeing Cas fucking something he couldn’t see at first underneath him.  Then Cas moved, sitting up to fuck a fleshlight between two pillows, crying out Dean’s name as he came.
He pushed that aside and rolled over to fall asleep and dream about dark blues eyes as deep and wide as the ocean.
Cas’s eyes darkened.  “Look at you, just look at you.  So open for me, so much trust, Dean.”  He paused and Dean listened as their breathing synced up.  Cas spoke carefully.  “You love me, don’t you?  No, you don’t have to say anything, I know you do.  I love you too, I always have, since the beginning when I saw your soul in Hell.  Now I know you love me too.”
“And about damn time too!”  Ellen exclaimed.  “If you could have heard how he mooned over that woman when she married your dad- I swear.  I never measured up, but I hardly cared.  We got to have Jo, then I met the love of my life.”  She nodded over at Pam who was leaning over the bar, reading a man’s palm and laughing with him.  Pam was awesome.  She seemed to feel eyes on her and looked up, giving Ellen a wink.  Ellen rolled her eyes and blushed.  “That woman will be the death of me.”
Cas pulled Dean up to kiss him, rolling them until Dean was on the bottom.  Cas then spun around until he was straddling Dean’s face.
There were some noises and Sam came into view, holding a denim jumpsuit.  Dean sighed, too tired to even feel bad about how this was probably traumatising his brother, and helped Sam get the jumpsuit on his legs and over his exposed crotch.  Sam rolled him so he could get to his knees first then stand.
“Mmmgh, god yes,”  Dean moaned in his pillow, slipping a few of his fingers in his puffy hole and pumping in and out.
“Well, I can’t say it, I’m his brother, it’d be weird.”
It’s not that he didn’t want to spend time with Dean, it’s just that since he had ‘helped’ Dean, it had been awkward.  Dean always found some reason to leave the room, and Cas would look at him and see how his lips looked and remember them stretched around his cock, and he’d get hard.  So here he was, trying to find something to help suppress his urges to mount Dean, bite his throat and mark him, and mate him once and for all.
“Do you have a bigger plug?”  Dean asked hopefully.
Cas felt a swell of love for the man threaten to overtake him.  He felt his cheeks flush, ashamed that only a few words would have so much affect on him.  He was angry at himself for allowing Dean to have so much power over him, and simultaneously wanted it and didn’t want it.  It was confusing and frustrating to have so many human emotions at one time.  So he settled on anger.
Cas nodded.  “I tried to smoke weed and get laid, but I wasn’t into it and Balth wasn’t either.  We just hung out and fell asleep after a failed blowjob.”
There was an unread message.
“May I pull the sheet back?” Cas asked.
Dean whistled lowly.  “My dad did a number on me, but Naomi kinda fucked you up too, huh?”
The singing had been hilarious, as usual, and they opened a present each.  Mary had gotten Dean a copy of
“I meant what I said last night.  I’ve...I’ve fallen for you.  But I don’t know what that means.  And I don’t want to mess this up or scare you off, but I’ve never felt this before.  And it’s kind of scary.”
Cas nodded and dipped in for a few more kisses and knelt between Dean’s thighs.  Dean felt his hole throb and clench around nothing, waiting impatiently for Cas to enter him.
He listened as Cas’s footsteps walked away and got up gingerly, wondering if he should remove the plug and shower, and just be done for the night.  He caught his reflection again- bed head, black panties twisted around his cock, and if he leaned over slightly, he could see the flat end of the plug.  It looked so naughty against his skin- and if he stood up straight, his ass cheeks covered it pretty well.
He closed his eyes and moaned, imagining Dean riding him, lowering himself onto Cas, plunging deep into his heat.  Cas was so close to the edge.  He opened his eyes.
“I’m sorry I said-”
“Yeah,” Dean grabbed his car keys and stuffed his feet into his boots.
Dean must have felt the same way, because he sat up, wincing on the butt plug, seeming more alert.
He had kept Cas’s grace inside of him even though he could have expelled it at any point.  Even though the handprint was gone, Cas’s true mark remained, and that could never be replaced by another angel’s grace.  Or removed by any other means- except Dean’s free will to eject him.
He had to watch it.  Getting a boner in these jeans would be very noticable.  It’s not like anyone would really see it in the crowd.  He twisted, shaking his hips, throwing his arms over his head. He looked up at that moment and locked eyes with Dean from far across the room.
Cas sighed.  He poked the bottle through another hole and squirted lube directly on his cock, hoping the cold would shrink him a little. He pushed in and out a little, hoping to just yank it out quickly, but it felt so good, it just got thicker.  He let out a soft moan and hissed when it was too tight to get out.
A full screen still of his face frozen in bliss as he looked back to watch himself put two fingers in his ass while leaning over the hood of Cas’s truck met his eyes.
“What can we do for him?” Sam glanced back at Cas.  “Is it dangerous?”
********
Dean reached out and touched Cas’s dick.  He shuddered as he felt Dean’s fingers wrap around the heated flesh, slick with lube.  Cas groaned loudly and clutched the divider to stay upright.
Rowena rolled her eyes and knocked on the door.  “Dean, any luck?”
Cas smirked down at him.  “You have to wipe all other experience from my mind.”  Cas knelt back up and started making short thrusts, taking Dean’s breath away.  His erection had wilted a bit with the pain, but a few gentle strokes from Cas’s hand was enough to bring it back.  Dean grabbed the headboard behind his head and hung on as Cas’s thrusts got deeper and he picked up the pace.  Dean moved his legs to Cas’s shoulders, crying out when the angle changed and Cas was pounding directly into his prostate.  He knew he wouldn’t last much longer.
Dean’s chuckles died down and he stood to come nearer to the problem.  Cas’s dick twitched on its own.  He hoped Dean didn’t notice.
So he’d kept to his room to pleasure himself, and it helped that he wasn’t surrounded by Dean’s smell.  He did steal a shirt so he could guiltily sniff it while imagining fucking Dean, and only watched gay porn in his own room from then on.
Cas tilted his head, squinting, reminding Dean of a confused puppy.  He fought an impulse to kiss the look off his face.
Dean looked up at him.  “Maybe I want you to come.  I want to know what that’s like,” Dean shrugged, licking at Cas’s tip, enjoying how it made him twitch and cry out weakly.
“Uh, Rowena?” Sam called from the hallway, “Dean’s, uh, he- well...could you come here?”
Cas melted and huffed a breath against Dean, slipped his cock out with a hiss, and turned Dean so he could face him properly.
“I’m an idiot,” Dean said to himself, stuffing the shirt back in the bag.  Even though Dean had done the cruelest thing possible by kicking Cas out, he still took a piece of Dean with him.  Something that
But now he held one in his hand.  One he could use one right this minute if he wanted.  One he could put in and then jerk off, and keep it in for the rest of the evening without anyone knowing, and jerk off again that evening.  Yeah, that sounded good.
episode.
Cas laughed.  “Yeah, I guess so.  I didn’t expect to ever love anyone.”
Cindy nodded and brought the package to the cash register.  There were a couple of clothing racks to the right, and he idly moved the hangers as Cindy rang him up.  He stopped on a pink pair of thong panties, and paused.  He would very much like to see Dean in them.  But surely Dean wasn’t into that?
“I’m kind of an idiot when it comes to words and things.  I say stuff wrong and I screw everything up.”
Dean sat at the bar, on his second beer.  It was nearly 1 am, and he was feeling pretty good about his life choices at the moment.  He did indeed meet Aaron at the bar, but instead of fucking, they played three rounds of pool.  Jo got winner, so Dean played three with her.  They’d laughed, ate awesome burgers (Dean kept saying he’d have gone gay earlier if he knew that the burgers were so good.  Ellen hit him with a spatula), and just talked about stuff.  Dean ended up spilling everything about Cas to Aaron and Jo, and they lent a sympathetic ear, ensuring him that he’d have the opportunity to meet lots of men, and there was someone out there for him.
He knew it was petty, but fuck sitting home pining for someone who wasn’t really interested.
“Yeah, I uh, I got back the day after Christmas.  There’s only so much of ‘home’ I can handle.”  He smiled sheepishly.
Dean looked over his shoulder as Cas darted into the bathroom, parted his flies and released his erection, swiftly pulling it until he came sharply into his palm.  He steadied himself without looking at Dean and wiped the come on the towel Dean had been wearing earlier.  Cas put his dick away and went back to the bed and  offered Dean the edge of the bedsheet to wipe himself off.
Dean stood in the shower with the curtain drawn, refusing to come out.
“You like that Cas?  You like to watch me fuck myself?  You get off on it?  You like to see me fuck this plug you gave me?  You want to watch me come?”  Dean moved his hand quicker, adding more pressure, orgasm right on the edge.  “Fuck!  Yeah, oh fuck yeah, Cas!”  Dean cried as he came over his fist, splattering on the floor, his ass rippling over the plug, somehow drawing out the pleasure until he was shaking and whimpering Cas’s name over and over.  He collapsed back on the bed and breathed heavily for a while until he drifted off into a perfect deep sleep.
He soaped himself up and tried to ignore the sense of emptiness he felt.  He wouldn’t let himself use that plug again.  It just made him want Cas more and more.
Dean smiled, eyes closed, half asleep.  Cas wasn’t worried anymore.  He would be able to wait for Dean to be ready again.  He rolled them again, and slid out of Dean’s worn hole, touching it with a finger to make sure it was uninjured.  It was loose and wet, and Cas reached for a towel to mop them up a little.  He found a water bottle by the bedside, and helped Dean get some sips. Dean smiled and hummed, finally opening his eyes again.
“Love you too,” Dean whispered, and soon he was asleep.
It was lust.  Cas gasped as the man looked back at him and
“Cas, it’s stupid, probably, to say things this quickly, but we suck at communication, apparently.  So I might as well say that this is love to me too.  It’s new, it’s fragile, and we’re probably going to suck at it and fuck it up a lot, but I love you.  There.  Wow, that wasn’t so hard.  Huh.”
“Spontaneous combustion?  Maybe the Thule?”  He could practically hear the gears grinding in Sam’s head.
“I can think of a few things we could post together.”
“This douche by the bar wanted me to gave this to you.”
The smooth top of the knob was worn down with use, and when it stretched him so much wider than the mallet handle, Dean cried out loudly.  He imagined how Cas shifted when Dean taught him how to drive stick, and Dean closed his eyes and pictured Cas’s slender fingers made rough by hunting, and how they wrapped around the knob and caressed it, pulling it into gear, how they rested there between shifts, how his hand would absently stroke the shaft while he talked to Dean.
Cas’s body was so close, and he brushed Dean’s arm anytime he moved.  It was pure torture, and Dean wasn’t sure he’d make it much longer; his cock was wetting his jeans now, and it was painful from being trapped there.
Cas reached over tentatively and picked up Dean’s hand, linking their fingers together.  It felt so much more intimate than what they had just done together.
Cas fumbled his belt open and pulled out his cock which was so hard it was painful.
The walk up the stairs was torture.  Well, it felt amazing, but having Cas two steps behind him, face so near his ass was torture.  He tried to make his strides as normal as possible, but he felt more than the normal amount of bowlegged.
“Would you like me to penetrate you?”  Cas’s dirty talk was really doing it for Dean.
know I can’t talk about stuff.  I mean, come on, I made you a
Cas twisted his fingers and brushed over the bundle of nerves inside Dean and the man cried out, his hole clenching down, and Cas watched as come spurted out of Dean’s slit, the head of his cock swelling and throbbing as he came, his hole clamping down tightly on Cas’s fingers in time with the spurts.
Cas thought.
“It’s just a joke, Dean,” Cas said in that patronizing tone.
The room was thick with the aroma of arousal, and Cas couldn’t help but inhale deeply.  It made him dizzy with sudden and sharp desire.  There was some animalistic part of him urging him to just push Dean down and mount him, but he shelved that away carefully and held out the large plug to Dean.
“How ‘bout me dragon deez nuts across your face?”
The bunker was mostly empty when he returned.  There was a case in New Jersey that was an all hands on deck type of thing, and Cas had stayed behind.  They had it covered and he was tired from the surges his grace kept emitting due to his little problem.
“You know what, Dean?”  Cas’s voice was soft as he looked out the window. “I’m not your damsel in distress, in fact, I was the one who saved you.  GIve me a little credit.”
He had trouble with the angle, so he pulled his fingers out and climbed on the hood and laid back, knees up, spread wide, his cock displayed in the panties nicely, his asshole gleaming with slick when he pulled the thong aside.  He gyrated his hips in time with the song, lifting his hips a little when he took the slicked-up handle of the socket wrench and pressed it to his opening.
He pressed in slowly, twisting slightly, pausing and letting it slide out.  Then pressing harder, relaxing, going a little deeper at a time.  He moaned as he watched his hole gobble up the blue plug, his rim stretched sinfully around it, taking it so well.
The garage light was still on when he went down the stairs carefully.  There was a sound and he froze, his hunter instincts on high alert.  He waited until he heard it again.
The rest of the visit went by quickly.  Dean packed up his presents, and bid farewell to Mom and Sam on New Years Eve, using the tired old joke of, “see you next year”, and promising to call the next day.
Raphael hummed in agreement and hung up.  Cas looked down at his outfit.  He was in a button down shirt and pajama pants.  He should probably stop and get something better to wear.  He’d never been seen out in anything less than a Hugo Boss suit or casual wear, and he’d be damned if he went to the club looking like that.
“Put them on me,” Dean said quickly, holding out his wrists.
“I’ll have some beef jerky and a pack of menthols,” he joked, trying to sound casual like his heart wasn’t suddenly hammering in his chest.
“I’m sorry I said-”
“Exactly.  The Watchers were charged with watching over humanity, but some of them fell in love with humans and mated with them.  Creating the nephilim, which caused major problems, blah blah blah, and here we are.  Castiel is practically an Archangel now, Jack has seen to that, and it seems he has chosen Dean as his mate, but for the life of me I don’t know why he would leave him like this.”
He had been standing there, in the kitchen, trying to remember what Cas smelled like, and was hit with the sudden need to be in Cas’s room, surrounded by his things, like that was the only thing that would make him feel better.
, and Cas felt his cock thicken in his pants.
“So Dean’s brother- Sam?  You buy him dildos as presents?”
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean groaned, running a hand over his face, trying to unclench from around the plug, but it just made it press more firmly against his prostate.
“Come on Cas, you can do it harder,” Dean moaned, and Cas let himself go, tasting Dean’s blood in his mouth, as he marked Dean’s skin and soul all at once.  The pleasure seemed to pulse and wave forever, and Cas felt complete.  He closed his eyes and collapsed, rolling with Dean, still inside him, come leaking slowly.  They would remain like this, linked for several minutes as Cas’s girth returned to a normal size.
Finally Cas moved and Dean stood quickly and walked as normally as he could to the door without running.  He started sweating again.  He exhaled and slouched when they got in the truck.
Cas’s finger pushed further, the tight silky heat swallowing him up easily.  Dean grabbed the base of his cock and squeezed, making the head pop clearly out of the panties.
“That good?”  Dean asked hopefully.  Cas had definitely had more experience than Dean, so he hoped his was at least half as satisfied as Dean felt.  For Dean, it was no contest.  That was the best sex he’d ever had.
He had watched a few more pegging videos that night, coming so hard he saw stars.  So of course, the next time he had time on his hands, he just clicked on whatever was in ‘suggested videos’ on his page.
Benny chuckled at Charlie’s stunned but gleeful look.  “Calm down sis, he only gets like this when he’s tore up drunk.  Starts speakin’ in ye olde English.  It’s hilarious.”
Dean’s eyes went wide as the crowd whistled and cheered and he let himself be pulled up on the stage.  Cas smirked back at Diamond when she tipped him a wink.
“Some-like-it-red from North Dakota wants me to fuck you dry like this, what do you think, Dean?”
She blinked.  “You have a son?”
Dean yanked Cas down and devoured his mouth, crying out when their erections slid along each other for a moment.  The pain of the plug subsided, and Dean began to crave the next size up.
“Cas,” Dean whimpered.  “I need-”
Cas shushed him and Dean could feel the blunt tip of Cas’s cock brush against his hole.  Dean moaned and dropped his face into the pillow, keeping his hips high.  Cas rubbed his tip back and forth, along Dean’s crack, teasing the hole, waiting for Dean to relax.  Finally, there was pressure, so much pressure, Dean felt like he would split in two, and Cas’s cock head popped in.  It felt so fucking big, and Dean pushed back, letting it in further.
It looked like Dean had just walked in.  Charlie Bradbury from psych was with him, and Benny, who Cas had seen at the club many times.  He was a good guy and was often seen with other bear-type men. He hadn’t realized he and Dean were friends.
Dean squinted through the windshield into the brightly lit store.  Sam’s voice on the phone was complaining about Crowley or something, but Dean had already started to tune him out.
“Dammit, Cas,” Dean growled from the doorway, “you missed the perfect opportunity!  He said he liked dragons!  You could have said it then!”
“Mmm.  Skin,” he membled into Dean’s hair.
Cas was looking down at him, biting his lip and moaning.  “You should see yourself, love, you look so good with your cherry red lips wrapped around my cock, so good, so good just for me.”
“Heya Cas.  Back early too?”
Dean:  Balthazar?  You still there?
Dean matched his glare.  “Don’t get fucking righteous with me, asshole, I remember you being the one to ask to finger me.  Usually dudes just get off from a little dry humping and that’s it.”
“How did you-”
Cas was working at an adult novelty store called the “Love Shack.”
panties, if there was such a thing, and the front was whole while the back was open.  He quickly slid them on and went back into the bathroom.
It actually sounded like a great idea.  Being around Sam recently gave him a huge amount of guilt- about Cas, about tricking Sam, about the angel renting a room in Sam’s head.  He was sure Kevin would be fine, and he could use the time off.
“I used to hold it to my face, smelling your scent, pleasuring myself, imagining you wanted me that way.  It was all I had of you.  Your unique smell.  My grace left and my memory isn’t was it was, but I know your scent from anywhere.”  He slapped Dean’s ass cheek, making him yelp.  “Now stand up so I can see you in the panties.”
“Hey Cas,”  Dean said, rolling his eyes.
Dean shook his head.  “Check what out?”
Cas shushed him and Dean could feel the blunt tip of Cas’s cock brush against his hole.  Dean moaned and dropped his face into the pillow, keeping his hips high.  Cas rubbed his tip back and forth, along Dean’s crack, teasing the hole, waiting for Dean to relax.  Finally, there was pressure, so much pressure, Dean felt like he would split in two, and Cas’s cock head popped in.  It felt so fucking big, and Dean pushed back, letting it in further.
“I didn’t sleep with Balthazar,” Cas blurted.  Dean blinked.  Cas clarified.  “I mean I was going to, it has been
“And you’re a hunter in training, remember?”  Dean knew he was reaching, but he didn’t want to leave Cas just yet.  He had to admit he really missed him.
Cas could of died.  That freak- that angel with the weird vaporizing mojo- had Cas in his crosshairs, and Dean almost missed the clue that sent him back there.
“Mmmph,” Cas moaned around Dean, the vibrations making it hard to think.  Dean pushed Cas’s hips up, then back down, setting a pace for Cas to fuck his mouth.  It was an awkward angle, but Cas had to stop what he was doing and lay his cheek on Dean’s thigh and Dean let go of Cas’s thighs and let him fuck his mouth, his thighs trembling, his rhythm faltering.
It looked like Dean had just walked in.  Charlie Bradbury from psych was with him, and Benny, who Cas had seen at the club many times.  He was a good guy and was often seen with other bear-type men. He hadn’t realized he and Dean were friends.
“Hey,” Cas said indignantly.  He slumped and giggled.  “Yeah. Was it him?”
The Winchesters always had eggnog, sat around the piano, and listened to mom and Sam wail out Christmas songs.  Dean would sometimes play the guitar, but he wasn’t very good.  Just a couple of chords.  They’d top the night off with opening one present, saving the rest for the morning.  Dean wondered if Cas had any traditions like that.  They probably gave each other Porsches for Christmas.
Sam was enthusiastic that Cas and Dean had finally gotten together, but that’s as far as he wanted know about it.  He had no clue how wild their sex life was, and he didn’t want to know.  That was fine with Dean.
Dean said something about taking a shower and brushed by Cas, and headed to his room.  Cas blinked and looked back to Sam.
Next to him, Cas mumbled something.
Dean decided to be brave.  “That was literally the best sex of my entire life, and I want to do that over and over, like forever?”
Dean:  Naomi?
Dean hummed in pleasure as Cas laid him back down against him again, the feeling of his fevered skin causing Cas to grind his hips up.  Dean gasped and turned bodily, suddenly straddling Cas, pressing the firm end of the plug on top of Cas’s cock, rubbing it shamelessly, dropping his forehead to Cas’s shoulder, his breath puffing hotly on his nipple.  Cas rutted upward, pressing the plug more firmly.  Dean moaned and rubbed the heated flesh of his cock onto Cas’s stomach.
He sat staring at his phone all morning, trying to make sense of the night before.
but it sounded so crude, and not the least bit sexy.  He was marinating on it so intently, that he zoned out in the middle of his favorite
Cas looked behind him, surprised at how well they looked.  In his haste, he hadn’t bothered to see how they appeared whole, and now apparently visible to Dean.  He could feel the brain fog and immediacy start to dissipate now that Dean was in his arms.
Probably the same reason Dean had come looking for him.  They needed each other.  Dean needed Cas like he needed water.  And he’d always been drawn back to him.  It seemed so simple and he felt stupid for not noticing before.
Cas propped Dean up and quickly took his shirt off, throwing it to the side.  Dean laid his bare back against Cas’s chest and the heated flesh meeting made Cas involuntarily hump the pillow between them, and he hoped Dean didn’t notice.
“Let’s get this over with,” Dean mumbled, towel-drying his hair swiftly.  He’d shaved and looked pink from all the scrubbing.  He smelled so familiar and amazing that Cas suddenly wanted to put his hands all over him just to make sure he was real.  He crossed his arms instead.  Dean was staring.
“Eternity sounds good to me,” Dean whispered, running his hands through Cas’s hair, then down through the small fluffy plumes near where the wings connected to Cas's shoulders.
Cas nodded professionally and seriously at the Sheriff and they walked out of his office.
“Yeah Cas,” Dean sighed happily, pulling them closer together.
Ew.  They were wrecked.  He wadded them up and flung them as far as he could- he breathed a .sigh of relief as they slid under the Model T and into the shadows.  He could throw them out later.
Cas was sipping his coffee, looking innocent.  Bobby and Earl were in a debate about the best way to attack a Rugaru, and not paying them any attention.
She smiled fondly at him for a split second, then let her mask of teenage disdain slip on again.  Cas felt accomplished that he made the angsty girl smile.  He liked her.
Dean:  shag and fancies- you from England?
Cas wrinkled his nose.  “Dairy products are not in the ‘good choices’ category.  I’m only making good choices now!”  He put the shot back on her tray.  “Away with yee, lovely wench!” he called with grandiosity.  Then a little quieter, “Can you bring me some water?”
Dean really liked the gift, he guessed.  He had worn it all night, and it had given him great pleasure, by the looks of it.  Perhaps it was time to give him the next size up.
Cas smiled and nodded, making his way into the kitchen, looking for something to give Dean energy enough to have sex again.
“Your slacks, Cas, they’re rough, my skin feels like it’s on fire,” Dean moaned.
He stretched carefully and looked around.  It was 10pm, he’d slept most of the day away.  He needed to get back downstairs to the garage and clean up his mess.  Then charge his laptop.  He glanced at his desk, freezing when he saw his laptop, already charging... and open.
“Cas, it’s stupid, probably, to say things this quickly, but we suck at communication, apparently.  So I might as well say that this is love to me too.  It’s new, it’s fragile, and we’re probably going to suck at it and fuck it up a lot, but...that’s what it is.  There.  Wow, that wasn’t so hard.  Huh.”
Dean clicked the cuffs over Cas’s wrists tightly.  Cas moaned into the pillow, and Dean’s cock twitched.  He really enjoyed this.  He moved up and behind Cas, sensing the powering down of his grace.
“This douche by the bar wanted me to gave this to you.”
No Dean.  Though that was probably good, since he didn’t know what his impulses would have him do.
The song ended and Dean knelt like a knight and kissed her hand.
The air replacing the space where Cas pulled away from seemed cold and lonely, making Dean shiver. Dean pulled his phone and called Sam.  He got his voicemail and left him a short message about having dealt with the angel situation and how he was going to stay over.
“I guess yer glad to have your boyfriend back, huh?”  Bobby slapped him on the shoulder.
“Stay with me, Castiel,” Dean said so softy, “stay and never leave me.  Please, I-  I need you.”
Cas thought.
Dean was slowly sinking down on Cas’s cock, and from that angle, he could watch as every inch of himself disappeared into that tight pink hole.  Dean was moaning, rising up, and sliding further down, almost fully impaled, leaning slightly back, his nipples erect, his chest flushed red, his hair a mess, his eyes hooded and dark.  He smirked down at Cas and began to roll his hips.
“Dean?”  Sam’s incredulous voice jerked Dean awake.
“Good, Dean.  You look so fucking good on my truck, fucking yourself.  The gear shift knob, that was something, very creative.  The trailer hitch was the icing on the cake, really.”
Of course, he’d been high on endorphins when he posted it.
“It’s not
The thought made his dick twitch hard, poking out of his robe, like a dowsing rod toward the masturbating angel, and Dean swayed as the blood rushed away from his head.
“I mean, I’ve been an asshole to you, I just I need a little punishing, I guess,” Dean said casually.
His gut twisted as he walked.  Thinking about the pain evident in Dean’s face as he had fought Michael for control of his body and losing still affected him so much.  He had known in that moment that he had failed his mission- albeit, his mission given to him years ago by Michael himself- to protect Dean, the Righteous Man, from harm.  That mission had changed from the side of the angels and destiny to the side of the Winchesters and free will, but he cared as much about it then as he did now.  So much had happened since the apocalypse, but the failure was now fresh in Cas’s mind- he was not able to keep Dean from saying yes to Michael.
“Oh, Dean,” he whispered, pink spots appearing on his cheeks.
“That’s true,” Dean said, kissing Cas on the nose.  “And you love me so fucking much.  You are a very lucky man, really.”
“I’m sorry, did you say ‘hour’?” he squeaked.
It was a soft moan.  Low, followed by a sigh.   Dean crept down the stairs.  No one should be there, he’d looked and Baby’s keys weren’t on the table when he passed the war room.
The man laughed, showing off his long throat.  “Yeah.  Your brother wanted you to have the whole experience- striptease, private dance, and more, if you want.  My name is Dean.”
He didn’t need porn tonight, that was for sure.  Dean had just orgasmed while holding Cas, so he’d have that image to masturbate to for awhile.  He also used the experience at the motel, combining the fantasy into one where Dean got on his knees and sucked Cas off, then Cas plundered Dean's ass against the tacky room divider.
“Hey, Steve,” he said, “Sign here?”
They pulled up at the diner a short while later and Cas got out.  Dean stared through the windshield at the group of hunters eating and laughing in the booths.   He was really starting to think this was a bad idea.
I also had to put a whole lot of Cas snark in here- in honor of his canon sass from season 13 so far. I fucking love SassyCassy.
He was a little confused by what he found.  “Congratulations”?  Okay, that was weird, even for Cas.  He took the card, his jaw dropping when he saw what was behind it.
He tried to get the balloon off, but Cas had tied it on too well.  Dean went back to the bedroom and flipped on the light to find his jeans with his pocket knife.  He cut the balloon off and turned, catching himself in the full-length mirror.
Dean cut him off with a kiss.  Cas relaxed and sighed into Dean’s mouth.  Dean pulled back, staring him straight in the eye.
Dean gasped, stroking his cock a little, giving it some relief.  Cas looked so beautiful, all presented to Dean, so vulnerable.  And he was volunteering to give up his grace to feel what it was like to get fucked by his mate!
Cas made a grand bow from his seat, and Charlie returned it.
Thoughts of the shower lead to thoughts of Cas.  Dean had tried his very hardest to keep Cas off his mind, but he’d find himself throughout the day wondering how he was.  He groaned. Now he was probably just going to lay there and think about Cas.
Cas remembered suddenly that he was at a party and it had gotten awful quiet.  A quick glance away and Cas saw that he and the man were the only two people in the room.  Fuck.  Gabriel had set him up.
Cas bit his lip and scrambled out of Dean’s bed.  He grabbed the offered water, looking at Dean’s pebbled nipples and growling.
“Are you really...falling for me?” Dean blushed and suddenly looked very insecure.
“Sit.”  Larue pushed Dean into a sitting position.  “Ooh, good boy.” The crowd cheered, while Dean flashed a nervous smile at Cas.
“You go wild then, love.”  Dean felt a full-body shudder at the mention of a pet name.  He liked it.  A lot.
“That’s what this is about!” he tried to say casually, but came out sounding accusing instead.
Cas: I understand, my mom is yelling at me.  Merry Christmas!
Sam started a little.  “Uh, I told him to wait in the car, I’d forgotten something?”
“Yesssss,” Dean hissed, pushing back on Cas’s hand as if he wanted more.
Cas appeared in his doorway, looking much like he had been asleep.
“Yes he is, and by the looks of it, you are as well.  You need to-”
He dragged his palm down his face, wondering if he shouldn’t put on another pot of coffee.
That wasn’t why he was there.  He needed to focus.
Cas huffed.  “Naomi was in rare form.  She read me the riot act, degraded my choice of major, and then lectured me about what a CEO should be like.  I got out of there as quick as I could before I could develop a serious drinking problem.  Drove back.”
“It’s most likely a side effect from the potion,” Cas said, his voice low and rough in Dean’s ear as he pumped Dean casually, waiting to be told what to do next.
Cas paused.  “Yes, Dean, like the novelty underwear.  I like the red color, I like the slickness of the fabric.”
Dean wiggled a little, being kind of ticklish, and Cas took the opportunity to push his thigh further between Dean’s legs, making him moan in relief with the pressure on his morning erection.  He ran a hand down to Cas’s hip and tugged him closer, so he could let Cas grind against him as well. They rolled their hips slowly, the rhythm sensual and speeding up their breathing.  Dean was concerned about his morning breath, and he may have needed to pee, but it felt so good he couldn’t stop.  Cas moaned as Dean found his nipple through his shirt, biting it and making Cas gasp and grind harder.
Dean sat down on the couch and ran his hands through his hair, looking shaken.  “Oh my god, I just whored myself out to a virgin who was saving it for marriage.  But...you seemed so, uh, I don’t know,
Cas smiled at Dean over the roof of the Impala and got in.  He buckled up and poked around in his backpack until his fingers touched the corner of a plastic box.  He pulled out the mixtape Dean gave him for Christmas and popped it in the player.  Dean grinned over at him, making his stomach flutter.  The strains of
Cas angrily threw the car into fifth gear.  It leapt forward and sped past the other cars on the interstate.  This was so fucked up!  How did it get so out of hand?  How could he have let himself care so much about one person?  And why did he keep saying and doing things to keep that one person at arm’s length?  He kicked himself for telling Dean he’d gotten laid when it was only a half-truth.  Not that it mattered to Den.  That guy could go fuck himself. Or fuck the football team, for all he cared.  Images of Dean getting fucked while wearing shoulder pads and cleats, a jockstrap pulled aside so he could stroke himself while being pounded from behind flooded Cas’s brain.  The linebacker was super hot, beefy, Cas would fuck him any day-  shit.  The images changed until it was Cas fucking Dean in a locker room, balls deep in his ass, making him scream.
Cas straightened his shoulders and walked to the kitchen.
Cas folded his wings  back up and leaned over Dean, his cock dragging along his crack, catching on his puffy rim.  Dean gasped, spreading his legs further.  Cas pushed, moaning at the tightness, the heat coming off of Dean, and managed to get the fat head of his cock in a couple inches.  Dean’s erection was dripping on his stomach, and Cas gave it a couple of strokes as he inched in a little more.
“What are you doing here?” Cas asked bluntly.
Dean shook a finger at Cas.  “Nope, go brush your teeth and pee.  I’m just going to lie here and think dirty thoughts while you’re gone.”
“Just how much can I do?” Cas’s voice sounded wrecked to his own ears.
Cas felt the swirling heat in his body tighten in his chest and spread down to his groin as he neared the edge, losing focus and moaning brokenly.  Impulsively, he grabbed Dean by the neck and pulled his head down so their mouths met in a clash of teeth and tongues, sucking, desperate kisses as Cas hurtled over the edge with Dean clenching his cock tightly with his hole, and spilling a second time over his fist.  Cas filled the condom inside Dean, wishing he didn’t have to wear it, that Dean would be marked as his, walking around with Cas’s come sliding out of his ass as he went and ‘entertained’ other men.  The idea made Cas shudder in another pulse of come, leaving him boneless and panting hotly into Dean’s slack mouth.
Bobby shrugged.  “Me an’ the others have been camping in close quarters for years now, ain’t the first time we heard a little afternoon delight.  No big deal.”  He snorted.  “Sam and Jack left in a hurry though, and Jack looked real happy.”
“No, it’s okay you go first.  I want to watch your butt in those pants.”
“Yes, Dean.  I will mate you.  I take you apart, bring you to orgasm three times, and I mount you and bite you, marking you as mine, filling you up with my seed, mating you for forever.”
“I asked what time it was,” Cas mumbled, wedging his knee between Dean’s.  “But now that I think about it, I don’t really care.”  He sighed, hugging Dean closer.
“What do you need, Dean?  I’ll give you whatever you need.”
Dean:  Guess I’m going to head back to the Roadhouse and see if Aaron is there.  Maybe he’d like to hang out.
He rounded the corner and nearly slammed into Sam.
There was an unfamiliar BMW parked behind Dean’s normal spot by the curb. He got out of the Impala and walked around the car.  It was definitely the newest model, so either someone was in the house with their parents, or somebody got a new car for Christmas.  Dean grinned.  Maybe they’d take him on a ride.
“Lick it,” Cas commanded.  Dean moaned and licked as Cas pushed his cock into Dean’s mouth, holding his head still by his hair, slowly pushing in, his hot flesh making Dean’s hole throb around the plug as it entered his throat.  He relaxed his throat and took Cas further.  Soon Cas was fucking Dean’s mouth, moaning and reaching back to rub Dean’s back and tap on the end of the plug.  Sparks traveled up Dean’s spine at the contact.
“Yeah.  I fell for you. Kerplunk.  Can’t un-fall.  I’m sorry.”  Cas kinda hoped Dean wanted to still have sex even though Cas was being all emotion-y.
Cas angrily threw the car into fifth gear.  It leapt forward and sped past the other cars on the interstate.  This was so fucked up!  How did it get so out of hand?  How could he have let himself care so much about one person?  And why did he keep saying and doing things to keep that one person at arm’s length?  He kicked himself for telling Dean he’d gotten laid when it was only a half-truth.  Not that it mattered to Den.  That guy could go fuck himself. Or fuck the football team, for all he cared.  Images of Dean getting fucked while wearing shoulder pads and cleats, a jockstrap pulled aside so he could stroke himself while being pounded from behind flooded Cas’s brain.  The linebacker was super hot, beefy, Cas would fuck him any day-  shit.  The images changed until it was Cas fucking Dean in a locker room, balls deep in his ass, making him scream.
“Fuck yeah,” Dean moaned, grabbing the far edge of the table to brace himself.
The motel door slammed shut at the same time as the vibrating plug suddenly went ballistic.
Then Cas sank deeper.  There was Dean’s soul, so perfect in its imperfections, shining and beautiful, the tiny parts of Cas winking back at him.  He saw there, finally, what he had always seen but somehow didn’t understand.
Cas grabbed the blanket and threw it over them as the chill started to dry the sweat on their skin.
He finally stroked his cock a few times, just teasing himself really, rocking harder and faster on the plug.
“Hey, Dean,”  Bobby called from a booth.  There’s room over here.” To Dean’s horror, Bobby moved to the other side of the booth with Earl, leaving the remaining seat empty for Cas and Dean.
“I’m going on a beer run and picking up some stuff for the burgers,” Dean called as he grabbed his keys.  “Any requests?”
“Ah-ha,” Raphael said finally.  “I know what it’s missing.  Come on, sugar, we’re going to make you pretty.”
The man arched an eyebrow at Cas and returned the thumbs up and turned, shaking his head as he headed for the door.
The rest of the visit went by quickly.  Dean packed up his presents, and bid farewell to Mom and Sam on New Years Eve, using the tired old joke of, “see you next year”, and promising to call the next day.
Cas had come across a ghost report in Muncie, Indiana, a milk run really, and Dean suggested they go and leave him behind so he could tune up Cas’s truck.  They were so shocked that Dean would let them drive Baby without him that they practically ran out of the bunker.
And I'm impulsive and post as soon as I can.
Dean got on the road early.  He was only a couple of hours away from school, and if got back in time, he could take a nap before he went to meet Benny and Charlie.
“It was so good, I loved watching you come apart on me like that, I love watching you take your pleasure from my body.”
“Dean’s fine,” Cas answered quickly, “he was taking a nap before we came, I’m sure he’s still tired.”  Then he went ahead and ordered a patty melt for Dean and an ice cream for himself.
Dean stopped breathing.  Had Cas just bought him a butt plug?  Seriously?
They sat there breathing hard together, Dean slumping over Cas comfortably, with the sound of Dean’s porn playing in the background.  Dean giggled into Cas’s neck.
Cas grinned wickedly.  That look always meant trouble.
But with Cas, it was… different.  Touching Cas like that, feeling his firm flesh throb in Dean’s hand, had a surprising effect on Dean.  He got a boner so fast he nearly swooned.  He was already a little turned on by the situation- it kinda played out like a porno, and life was so rarely like porn.
Cas was growling, the hunger in him coming in waves, and he tore at the motel bedsheets with cuffed wrists.  Laid on the pillow, against his mouth and nose were the ruined panties, barely able to keep him present.  His cock was so swollen he could barely jerk it with his linked fists, and he ended up rolling over to rut the bed instead.  There was a ringing in his ears, and he was covered in sweat.  He needed Dean so badly, needed to mount him, to take him, but he wouldn’t do anything to harm him.
But he didn’t want anyone else.  He wanted Cas.
He hadn’t heard much from Cas that week between Christmas and New Year’s, but that was always a nothing week- time to visit family, do some sales shopping, play with new toys.
Dean flopped down on his bed, glad to have the bunker to himself for the first time in forever.  Sam and Jack were on a case, and Cas was following a lead on Michael’s location.  All the hunters that were usually there had other places to be, so Dean volunteered to take a day off.
Dean scowled petulantly.  “No, I’m fine.”  He stood gingerly.  “My, uh, my back has been bothering me a little.”  He didn’t know why he bothered lying, it was kind of pointless, really.
“Sounds fun,” Cas sighed.  “I’ll be there in 15.”
He took Cas in hand and stroked his once, Cas’s hips leaving the bed as he arched in pleasure.
here's a little tiny floof epilogue, thanks for hanging in there for me to realize I'd dropped the ball on posting!
********
But there was one thing he wanted.  And he wasn’t sure if Cas would say yes.
So he’d opened up the ol’ laptop and cruised around on Pornhub and tried to find something that interested him.  He had clicked on a link that said, ‘Busty Blonde pegs Butch Boy’.  He had no idea what any of that meant (except ‘busty’), so he clicked it and sat with his jaw unhinged as he watched a fit- looking man bent over a couch arm get fucked in the ass by a hot blonde woman with a strap-on.  The attached dildo wasn’t enormous or anything, but by how it sounded, the guy really really liked it.  Dean had looked down at his dick and was surprised to see he was getting hard watching something go in the guy’s ass.  He was a little weirded out, so after watching the whole thing twice, he let go of his lubed-up cock long enough to click backwards to find something else.  Of course, watching the video twice fucked up his algorithm, and there was all sorts of kinky shit on the suggested videos.  Curiosity killing the cat and whatnot, he clicked on another pegging one where the woman was wearing a larger dildo really pounding into a dude, the camera angle moving around to show the vast quantity of come shooting out of the guy when she started jerking him off.  That had peaked his interest.  Was it possible to just get off from anal stimulation?  He only sexual experience involving his usually ‘exit only’ policy had been with Rhonda Hurley in high school when she’d put him in pink panties, blew him and stuck a finger up there.  It had felt weird, but man, if she got off on it, he was more than willing to do anything she wanted- her blow jobs were legendary.
“Dean,” Cas seemed almost to growl, “they left ahead of us and we can meet them there...I thought I’d drive.”
There was no balloon this time, no card, it just simply sat there, larger than the one Dean had been using, and begging to be crammed up his ass.
since I even kissed anyone and I was so damn jealous of you and what’s-his-name-”
Dean wanted to pull his hair out.  He was supposed to be telling Cas he liked him.  But if this was how the guy was, hooking up with random guys from his past…
He felt Dean shift slightly under him, and him struggle to find Cas in the darkness.  Then he relaxed and a door opened, and Cas slid in deep, much deeper than he had physically, much deeper than he expected.  He was sure Dean would resist him, but he was wide open.
“Really?”  Sam looked up, seeming interested. “Dean and I faced off with one of those guys several years ago.  Most of the lore is incorrect.”
Sam looked up from his laptop, taking a sip of coffee.  “Hey, Cas, what’s up?”
Turned out Gabriel wasn’t lying.
He picked it up and felt its weight in his palm.  Not just bigger, but heavier than the first, too.  His asshole clenched, imagining what it would feel like to slide it in, and his cock started to harden.
What the fuck was Cas doing with panties in his backpack?  Maybe he really was dating someone?
“Cas, yes, auuhhhww...yessssss…” Dean hissed, “please yes, please-”
“Yeah, Cas.”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said quickly, grabbing his knees and spreading his legs.
Dean got pissed.  That guy had said he was the one that got away, but Cas was still sleeping with him?  What the fuck?  He knew it was fishy that the guy had Cas’s phone.  They had been in bed together!
“Oh Dean, you are so very tight.  So much more than the fleshlight or-”
Cas nodded against his neck.  “Dean,” he whispered again.  “Love, I can’t...I mean, I never…”
Dean should have knocked.
Cas slipped out from behind him and turned so Dean couldn’t see how aroused he was, and slid them off .  He sat back down, now only in his boxers, and put the pillow back.
That snapped something in Cas, and he flipped Dean to his back again, holding him down, his wings spreading out in the space of the hideaway room.  “I want you, Dean, and I don’t want anything else.”  He began to work the plug out- moaning when he saw it was the biggest plug of the set.  Perfect.
Here's the rest of it :)
Cas took his smooth jaw in his hands, cupping him tenderly.
Dean stared at his phone.  He was so confused.  Was Balthazar completely full of shit?  It really seemed like Cas wasn’t interested in him.
They walked away from Dean’s crime scene and into the unknown.
“Oof!  Oh Dean,” Cas exclaimed as they collided bodily, the hunter catching the angel before they could fall.
Dean:  shag and fancies- you from England?
Cas nodded against Dean’s shoulder.  “Yeah.  I want to try it.”
But Cas dipped in a kissed him there instead.  Dean cried out and clenched down, his cock growing impossibly harder, and kept his hands away.  Cas would take care of him, he knew it.  He said he trusted him, and he did.
Cas stood by the bar, looking around the club as the bass pulsed on the very crowded dance floor.  He certainly was getting a lot of stares.  He wondered if this was the wisest move, letting Ms. Diamond LaRue surface and drag him into the makeup room.  Sure it was just a little eyeliner, but the reactions from the drag queens coming into work while he was back there raved about how sexy he looked.  They said his eyes were ‘stunning’ and ‘to die for’ and ‘panty soakers’, but the only panties he could think about were the ones Dean was wearing in his mind, prancing around his room, teasing Cas.
The divider itself was made of hard plastic, with a repeating pattern of circles and squares.  The shape of his dick was thinner at the base and very thick in the middle, and tapered at the end.  The circle part of the divider was just the right size…  He hadn’t been fully hard when he stuck it in there after his shower, and he cursed himself for not just taking care of his erection in the shower instead of looking for alternatives.
“Cas, oh fuck, it’s so huge, yes, oh yes, keep going, baby.”
“Hello, Dean,” he said lowering his voice, hoping it sounded sexy and not drunk.
Then it clicked.
Cas shook his head and headed to the small bathroom.  Dean wondered why they even had one in a store like that.  It was just asking to be jerked off in.
Cas laughed, kissing Dean again, deepening it, but keeping it slow, deliberately drawing it out until they got hard again.  Cas pulled away the blanket and looked down at Dean
Cas cocked his head slightly and shrugged.  “If you wish for me to I-”
“Ah-ha,” Raphael said finally.  “I know what it’s missing.  Come on, sugar, we’re going to make you pretty.”
“I was just, uh, I’m going to go take a-”
Dean stood up.  There was no way he’d get a nap now.  Might as well get a shower and make plans for New Year’s.  He hoped that 2018 wouldn’t suck as much as the last day of 2017.
“Thanks for joining us, but we’re going to take a nap now, so signing off until next time.”  Dean felt Cas lean in and kiss his puckered and well-fucked hole, his usual signature sign off (Dean had no idea where he got the idea from, but he kind of loved it).
Dean buried his face in his pillow.  Maybe he would go to the Roadhouse that night.  They should be open, being the weekend and all.  He’d call to see if they were, and maybe he’d ask Jo to get ahold of Aaron.  Dean really would have liked his first sex encounter with a dude to not be in a bar, and to be the one getting fucked, but he wasn’t opposed to fucking the guy, I mean, they’d talked a lot.  The guy was pretty cool.
Cas smiled back at him.  “Only because you love me so much.”
FUCK.
The smell was delicious and made his knees weak.  There was Dean, laying in Cas’s bed, nested in all his blankets, moaning and sweating.
Dean’s door was slightly cracked open when Cas arrived.  He rapped his knuckles on it, swinging it open to an empty room.  His stomach swooped in panic until he saw that Dean’s robe was missing from the back of the door of his closet.  He must have already made it to the showers.  He shut his eyes and felt around for Dean, the familiar brightness of his soul like a beacon calling Cas, and he felt Dean nearby, in the shower, bathing himself.  There were waves of anger roiling off Dean as he scrubbed himself harshly, shame and guilt tarnishing the brightness of his soul.
Dean let his cock rest on Cas’s calf as he moved down until his mouth was inches from Cas’s hole.  He licked a broad stripe over Cas’s balls, which were already tight against his body.  Cas shivered.  Dean moved up a little and gently tongued at Cas’s hole, making the bound angel moan into the pillow.  He could tell Cas was trying to hold himself still, so Dean steadied him with a firm hand before really pressing his tongue on Cas’s hole.  It flexed under the pressure.  He’d never rimmed anyone before, and it really excited him.  He pushed the pointed tip of his tongue into the furl, groaning into it when it yielded rather easily.  Cas was already shaking and sweat was sheening along his back. Dean pushed his thumb in Cas’s hole as he licked, pushing in and out gently, pulling a little to help Cas relax.  Cas pushed back on his thumb, calling out Dean’s name, his cock dripping onto the bed sheet below.  Dean switched to using his fingers, going slow the way he liked it, loving the hot feel of Cas’s stretched around his finger.  Soon it was two fingers, then three.  Cas was flushed all over, head turned on the pillow to try and see Dean from his submissive position, moaning his name over and over.
Dean slid down Cas’s legs until He was face first with Cas’s dick.  It smelled clean and of soap, but musky and dark, the scent he picked up when he buried his face in Cas’s neck.
Dean snorted and giggled.  “Come here,” Dean smiled and pulled Cas close, flipping the blanket over both of them.  “Only you could call the kinky shit we do to each other in bed ‘lovemaking’.”
Dean pulled Cas forward until he could reach his mouth again, slowly kissing him to distract from the pain.  He wrapped his legs around Cas and pulled him further in with his heels, feeling like he would split in half.  He arched his back when Cas slid by his prostate, the crown of his cock catching on it and moving deeper.
Cas cleared his throat and tried not to sound as ecstatic as he felt.   “I guess you could try it.”
“That won’t be necessary, but thank you for offering.”
Dean was humping the mattress in his fitful sleep.  Cas stroked his hair and laid next to him, now without his sticky boxers.  He was naked in bed with Dean, where he’d wanted to be for nine years, but under bad circumstances.
“Damn, buddy, you’ve got it bad for this guy,” Aaron said around a mouth full of peanuts.
Dean squeezed him tighter.  “I’m scared too.  This feels big.  I know that sounds stupid, but it does.  I can’t get you out of my head, not since you kissed me at the party.  It’s not just that I want to bone you, well, cause yeah I do, but it’s like all the other stuff too.  I want to be with you.  Can we try that?”
“Not before we drive it around though, right?”  Dean grinned at Cas, finally getting a smile out of him.
Cas took over and cleaned Dean up, and rolled him over and began changing the sheets.  There were fresh linens in the bathroom as well as clean towels.
If ya'll know me, you know I'm shit at editing, and over-eager at posting.
There was a knock at the door.
Cas ran his hands down Dean’s back, then draped himself over him, his cock sliding along his crease until it lined up, and he pushed back in, this time all the way in in one stroke.  Dean groaned and pushed back, his elbows shaking.  Cas wrapped his arms and wings around Dean, slowly pulling out and pushing in, the waves of pleasure rolling him under, his grace taking over, reaching out to Dean’s soul, entangling.  Dean’s soul wrapped snugly around his grace, completing the bond, and suddenly Cas was hit with the gnawing hunger he had earlier.  He began to pound into Dean, yanking him back onto his cock, driving into Dean’s prostate, as Dean fell face first into his pillow, moaning incoherently, the new angle helping Cas go deeper.  The power of it was building, and Cas watched a ball of blue light form around them, and he growled, feeling himself nearing the edge, and he had to make Dean come one more time, and then he could, and it would be so good-
Cas could smell them well before he saw them.  A musk of arousal, unmistakably Dean was wafting down the hall, and something snapped inside of Cas.  He stomped down the hallway, following the scent like a bloodhound, just to find himself standing in front of his own bed on which lay the pink panties he’d bought earlier that week, covered in Dean’s come and sweat.  The handcuffs were still an option, thankfully, and maybe he could stop himself before it was too late.
Dean chuckled.  “Nah, yeah okay, it seems weird when you say it like that, but who hasn’t tried to get off on motel furniture?  Kind of a lonely hunter’s right of passage.”
Sam made a face as Dean burst out laughing.
It posted twice, and I only updated one of them. Apologies:*)
Dean:   I really didn’t mean to flirt, really
But he did.  “Wow.  You take Viagra or something?  I did that once- thought I was gonna have to go to the ER cause the little fucker wouldn’t go down for 6 hours.”
Dean wiggled his toes and peeked out from under the blanket.  Cas was wrapped in a towel, and Dean watched a bead of water travel down his chest, roll around the edge of his belly button, and disappear into the towel edge.  Dean swallowed.  He pulled the blanket open to let Cas in.
Dean shook himself and realized what Cas just said.
Cas pulled out, changing positions again, this time on their sides, Cas behind Dean again, holding up one of his legs to get deeper.  Dean’s eyes rolled back as Cas let go of his leg and grabbed his cock, smearing the precome all around, pumping his fist quickly, nailing his prostate on every stroke.  Dean felt taken, owned, claimed, and he went rigid as his pleasure overtook him again and he came, crying out Cas’s name over and over, cursing at the intensity, then going limp as Cas pounded harder into him, chasing his own pleasure.  Dean whispered encouragement, throwing in a few dirty phrases to bring Cas to the edge.
“Not even a little.  Want me to return it to him?”
Deciding that he’d pondered it quite enough for one day, he changed the subject to football, and they told stories back and forth about Lawrence High’s terrible team and how they’d never make state.  Dean went home alone that night, happy that he’d only nursed 3 beers all night and had a good time with friends.  It made him miss school though, and he wondered how Kevin and Chuck were doing.  Three weeks of break was too long, and Dean wondered if Mom and Sam would be okay if he went back early.  Maybe spend New Year’s with the guys.
“Yeah, I uh, I got back the day after Christmas.  There’s only so much of ‘home’ I can handle.”  He smiled sheepishly.
Dean bit his lip, trying to resist moving his hand again while Cas spoke in that hushed, intimate tone, looking down at him.
“Do you like my shirt?” He asked, pinning Dean with a exaggerated stare.  He rubbed his nipples, pursing his lips.  Finally Dean broke, throwing his head back and laughing openly.  Cas grinned at him in satisfaction, sitting back in his seat, winking at Dean.  “Yeah, you love it.”
Dean was already trying to stand and slip the globe out when Cas’s words hit him and he sat back down.  “Jesus Christ, Cas!  You can’t just say things like that.  Are you serious?”
“Dean?” Cas whispered under the safety of the blanket.
*****
She looked nervous.  Cas smiled and put the package back on the shelf.
And he remembered waking up alone in his bed, cleaned off of any residue, but alone.  It wasn’t great.  If he wanted to be honest about it, it felt perfectly awful.  He thought something had finally happened with Cas, and that maybe they’d be fucking now, like regularly, hell, the guy was calling his name out when he got off, but Dean didn’t know.  He’d just left, and had been acting really strangely.
Dean smiled and climbed into Cas’s lap, wrapping his legs around him, slotting their cocks against each other, the heat and pleasure making Cas feel weak again.
Dean wiped tears from his eyes and stifled a giggle.  “Yeah, yeah I do.  Looking pretty sharp tonight, Cas.”
Dean had always been a little weirdly attracted to Cas but damn.  A few months of sticking things in his butt and suddenly he was gay for his best friend.
“Didst I sayeth that out loud?”
Cas blushed and looked away.  “I don’t.  I was just curious.  Sometimes a casual encounter can become something more.”
Cas:  Not a problem.  Just so you know, I think Cassie really fancies you
“Less messy, I suppose, and I do enjoy the live interaction with our followers.  It’s so nice that they enjoy our lovemaking.”
Dean huffed a laugh, his breath hot on Cas’s erection.  It twitched in his hand, and pre-come dribbled out.  Dean automatically lapped it up.  It was bitter, a little different from his own, but not bad.  He lapped at it again, swirling his tongue around the crown, glancing up at Cas, who had propped himself on his elbows to watch.
The fact that Cas knew so much about sex toys now should have been off-putting, but it was giving Dean butterflies in his stomach.  Maybe he shouldn’t have eaten those tacos earlier.
Cas:  Goodnight Dean.
Dean smiled at her.  “Yeah I really like that one with Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.
They laughed, Dean motioned for Cas to talk first as they pulled their chairs close.
Planning to go out and get laid didn’t feel as exciting as it should have.  It just felt forced.
“Fuck, Dean,” Cas whispered, setting his forehead on the back of Dean’s neck.  “Fuck.”
Dean nodded, trying to grind on Cas’s fingers again, this time meeting with a little success when Cas’s middle finger breached his hole an inch.  He sighed in relief.  Cas grinned up at him.
“Dean, we’re going to suffocate.”
He had felt a warm rush of desire fill him when the man in the video spread his ass cheeks and showed his hole to the camera.  Cas’s cock stood at attention nearly instantly, and he gripped it and held it still.  The man in the video had a long dildo suction cupped to a chair and was slowly lowering himself onto it.  Cas imagined himself sitting in that chair and that tight hole pushing down onto him.  He shuddered, and with only a couple of strokes, came in his boxers.  He saw stars, and panted out hard breaths.
Dean sighed out loud.  That didn’t sound too bad.
When presents were opened, paper and ribbons cleared up, and pancakes eaten, Dean went to grab his phone.  He’d left it on his bed on purpose- he knew he’d get distracted checking it all morning.
“I...I’m sorry, Cas.  I fucked up,” Dean stumbled over his words.  “I made a stupid decision and I’m really sorry.”
Cas slid easily out of the room divider.  The water was running in the bathroom, and Cas swore he heard Dean moan.
Cas:  Well spotted, Dean.  Cassie likes you.  You should try again.  I saw what you texted when you were drunk, and I think you might like him as well.  Castiel is my very oldest and dearest friend, and he deserves someone who will love him for who he is.
“Something wrong with you, boy?”  Bobby asked as she walked away.  “You coming down with something?  You look all flushed.”
Sam opened his new cell phone from Mom and Dean, shrieking like he did before his voice had changed.  They’d decided it was finally time to get him one since he’d be going off to school next fall.
Dean sighed.  He was fucking this up.  Why couldn’t he just not care and be normal?  Just sit here and be friends with Cas and not feel all possessive?
It wasn’t long before he had made several videos of himself fucking various items; a large carrot, the long tapered handle of the swiffer duster, a broom handle.  He threw out every item he’d put in his ass, unable to stand the thought of his brother touching anything that had been up his butt.  He had to take a special trip to Walmart to replace his brush, the broom and duster, and later a phillips head screwdriver, spatula, and small bottle of olive oil.  His habit was getting expensive.  Especially when he added the element of lace to the videos.
Cas:  Indeed.  I’m a bit hungover as well.  Indulged in a bit too much, if you know what I mean.
Dean sat up and motioned for Cas to sit.  Cas flopped down next to Dean, sitting against the headboard shoulder to shoulder.  They weren’t quite touching, but Dean could feel Cas’s sleep-warm skin from inches away.
Dean:  Look man, I just wanted to apologize.  Won’t Cas be mad about you being on his phone?
They laid there heaving breaths and waiting for Dean to adjust, and sooner than he expected, the burn began to feel good.  Really good.  He rolled his hips up a little and Cas thrust back.
“Dean, look at me,” Cas growled, making Dean’s eyes pop back open.  He fought to keep them that way as he felt the tightness build in his abdomen, coiling there, tingles and prickles running up and down his spine in a way he’d not felt just fingering himself- this was so much more intense- looking into Cas’s darkened eyes in the early morning light, hanging on for dear life, Cas’s words echoing in his mind-
Then he had to wait until Sam and Cas went somewhere without him.
The were heading to Dean’s mom’s for the weekend so Cas could meet them.  Dean had tried so hard not to build it up, but Cas knew Dean was as nervous as he was. Cas knew it would be fine, any woman who could produce such a fine man as Dean was alright in Cas’s book.  He also couldn’t wait to meet Jo and Ellen, and hang out in a rural gay bar.  Sounded really cool.
Cas pouted, wishing they could do it just one more time before they went to sleep.  He relented.
If you aren't a fan of Bottom!Cas, skip this, Dean just wanted to try something, and Cas was all too happy to give it a try
Dean deflated in relief.  Cas wasn’t mad or scared away.
Sam huffed a laugh.  “You know, I used to really like dragons- I thought they were like unicorns, though.  But now, not so much.  Shame about unicorns.”
“Did you just quote a Led Zeppelin song at me?” Cas’s muffled voice drifted back to him.
Cas moaned happily and lay flat on the mattress, taking Dean with him.  They breathed heavily, and stayed that way for a moment, Dean shrinking and feeling the hot rush of come escape Cas.  Dean sat up between Cas’s spread legs and pushed the cooling come back into his hole with the tip of his softening cock, spreading it, plunging a finger or two back in, just to feel the hotness.
The singing had been hilarious, as usual, and they opened a present each.  Mary had gotten Dean a copy of
The phone rang twice.
Cas attacked his mouth again, pushing him flat to the mattress and kissing him sloppily, laughing, covering Dean’s body with his own.  Dean revelled in the feeling.
“Don’t worry, I’ve got you,” Cas whispered.  He moved further down, Dean glad he was going to get sucked off.  He really needed to come.  But instead, Cas parted his legs, bending his knees to his chest, exposing his hole.  Dean spread his legs further, excited about Cas touching him there.
Dean half smiled at Bobby and looked away.  Bobby eyed them both before resuming a conversation with Earl.
Dean felt a blush creeping up his neck as he held Cas’s gaze steadily, trying to ignore the massive cocks dangling on the wall behind him.
“Adult novelty shop,” Cas mumbled.
“But that’s just it,” Dean interrupted, “I should know better by now, right?  I should stop throwing myself on the grenade and-”
Rowena sighed again, sounding put upon. “Of course
Cas froze, turned bright red and started fumbling words again.  “I mean- I um, like when I say that- I um, you know-”
Dean slammed it shut and went to the closet to put on his robe.  He needed a shower very badly but he first had to go destroy some evidence.
“Fuck!”  Dean let Cas slowly push into him, the heat of his flesh bright inside of Dean, his every vein and wrinkle felt by Dean’s overworked tunnel.  Cas thrust up into Dean until Dean relaxed into Cas’s arms, enjoying the fullness of it, so much more complete than anything he’d ever tried.
“What?” Cas turned to make sure his clothes were in place, and looked back at the other man.
“That’s fine with me,” Dean sighed.
“Go ask him,” Dean said, trying to hold back a giggle.
Dean rubbed his back, enjoying the way Cas’s body seemed to line up against him, warm and pliant.  “No wonder you’re exhausted- let me call Sam and tell him I will be home a day later.  I’ll get a motel room and you can sleep in a bed, okay?”
Dean sighed out loud.  That didn’t sound too bad.
The girl, Claire, returned with a roll of her eyes and a blowjob shot in hand.
Dean pulled out his phone and shot Cas a text.
Cas:  Indeed.  I’m a bit hungover as well.  Indulged in a bit too much, if you know what I mean.
Cas’s eyes narrowed.  “And how, exactly, would you hear anything about Balthazar?”
“I didn’t sleep with Balthazar,” Cas blurted.  Dean blinked.  Cas clarified.  “I mean I was going to, it has been
He hummed to himself and locked the door, unbuckling his jeans.  He had lube and a couple of condoms with him (he wasn’t a savage), and he got to work.
Dean:  I will.  Thanks Balthazar.
Dean moaned as his cock stood at full attention against the rough denim of his jeans.  He scurried to pull all of his clothing off, and Cas watched with hungry eyes.
“-nap…”  Dean finished.  “No, yeah, a nap.  Then a shower.  Yeah.”  His face was burning, and his hands were sweating.
Dean was so hard he couldn’t help but rub on Cas’s hip shamelessly.
Dean laughed and sat up, and kissing the top of Cas’s head.  He’d never been so intimate with someone, to just be close like that, not feeling self-conscience. He swung his legs out of bed, grateful he had stopped drinking after midnight and switched to bottled water.  His mouth tasted funky, but he felt pretty good.
What the actual fuck was he thinking?  He was obviously fucked up in the head.  How could he do all that to Cas’s truck?  It wasn’t like he could throw out the shifter knob or trailer hitch without Cas knowing something was up, let alone asking the angel to scrape him off the garage floor.  What the fuck was he going to do?
“What’s happening?”  Dean asked without looking.
“What joke?”  Sam was looking back and forth between them.
Dean glanced at him, falling back into the couch with a sigh.  “Yeah, I guess.”
Dean stood awkwardly.  “When are the others going to be back?”  he asked Sam.
Dean moaned and got up on all fours, tilting his hips back like he did that day when Cas had to work that witch’s potion from his body.  It made Cas shiver.
“Are you going to keep seeing Aaron?”  Cas was looking down at his hands.
He evaluated his situation.  It might not have been the brightest of ideas to stick his dick in the fancy room divider of the motel, it just had looked about the right size to do so, and recently Cas had been getting bored of pleasuring himself with just his hand, and had been getting creative with his masturbation.
He sat up, the room tilting dangerously, and wrapped himself in Cas’s blanket and shuffled to the door to unlock it.
Cas pulled out, changing positions again, this time on their sides, Cas behind Dean again, holding up one of his legs to get deeper.  Dean eyes rolled back as Cas let go of his leg and grabbed his cock, smearing the precome all around, pumping his fist quickly, nailing his prostate on every stroke.  Dean felt taken, owned, claimed, and he went rigid as his pleasure overtook him again and he came, crying out Cas’s name over and over, cursing at the intensity, then going limp as Cas pounded harder into him, chasing his own pleasure.  Dean whispered encouragement, throwing in a few dirty phrases to bring Cas to the edge.
“Dean,” he whispered before pulling Dean onto his lap and kissing him, hard.  Dean moaned into his mouth, shamelessly rubbing his cock on Cas’s deflating one.  Cas thrust upward, licking down Dean’s neck, his hands roaming to squeeze Dean’s ass hard, grinding their hips together.  Dean arched his back, and called out Cas’s name, lost in the feeling of the angel’s hands pulling the robe away until Dean was naked in Cas’s truck again, this time straddling him in the driver’s seat.  Cas slid his hand down the length of Dean’s tailbone, pushing against his swollen asshole.  Dean tried to spear himself on Cas’s fingers, but Cas pulled away.  Dean looked down into Cas’s eyes, breathing hard.  The phone behind him made a noise, and he turned to look at it.  There on the screen was a close up of Dean’s asshole as he pushed nearly all four fingers into himself, right there on the seat of the truck they were sitting on.
Cas sat up straight in bed when he saw Dean in a towel.  “Holy fuck, Dean, get over here.”
Dean whipped around and looked at Cas.
Dean loved this.
Dean’s eyes bored into his, his mouth slowly hanging open when he took in what Cas was wearing.  Cas smirked a little and spun, showing his back (and hopefully his backside) to Dean and continued to dance.  If the man wanted to talk, Cas would wait for him to make the first move.
Dean laughed and pulled Cas into his lap.  They watched the rest of the drag show in the same chair, Dean kissing Cas and breathing into his neck.  It was heaven.
His mind swirled around the images he’d just gotten off to; sucking Cas’s dick, getting fucked by him, holy shit.
“Yeah, I just, uh, thought he could use some cheering up.”  Cas knew he was bright red.
Dean furrowed his brow.  Was this a guy Cas had just fucked?  Was he lying in bed with this Balthazar guy?
What the fuck was wrong with him?  He should be glad Cas was finding happiness with someone else.  It’s not like he owed Dean anything, in fact, Dean felt it was on him to repay the fallen angel in any way he could.  Even if that meant pushing him into the arms of someone else.
Dean wanted to pull his hair out.  He was supposed to be telling Cas he liked him.  But if this was how the guy was, hooking up with random guys from his past…
Cas sat his cup down in the sink and turned back to Dean.  He walked slowly over to the hunter, lowering his face to look at Dean through his eyelashes.
and then added,
But he didn’t want anyone else.  He wanted Cas.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas reappeared in the doorway.  “I thought you said you didn’t fuck anyone.”
Soon he was thrusting against Dean’s pillow, rutting until he came, whispering Dean’s name.  He wondered how it would feel, the real thing, tight muscles yielding to his cock, sucking him in, his fingertips pressing into Dean’s hips as he fucked him into the mattress.
Dean:  Oh I see.  Was he the one that got away?
Dean woke several hours later and rubbed his eyes.  He slowly rolled and sat up.  His back hardly protested and he breathed deeply.  His back was so much better than it had been.  Sometimes it was like that.  A muscle spasm was unpredictable.
They laughed, Dean motioned for Cas to talk first as they pulled their chairs close.
Cas’s eyebrow quirked.  “I see.  You like to penetrate yourself.  The muscles here seem to yield to my fingers with familiarity.  Right here-”  Dean arched and shouted as Cas pressed and rubbed over his prostate, pressing the base of Dean’s cock with his thumb.  “That is your prostate.  Some men prefer its stimulation over the penis, and with good reason.  I have tried this on myself, with various devices, but I prefer the act of penetration.”  Dean couldn’t speak, the waves of pleasure pulling him under as Cas pushed in a second finger.  “There’s something about firmly pressing my penis- well, most of the literature I have read says men prefer the term ‘cock’ or ‘dick’ over penis, so I shall say cock, okay?”  Dean was incoherent as he came.  It was like he was riding the crest of a wave, but the wave wasn’t breaking as Cas held the base of his cock firmly.
Dean moaned at the sight and kicked off the covers on his side too.  He watched Cas watch him, pushing his wet fingers in his hole, stretching slightly, pulling at his rim.  Cas bucked into his fist with small movements, eyes moving back and forth between Dean’s twisting fingers and his face, lips wet and open.  Fuck, Dean wanted Cas to slide those plush lips over his cock so bad, had thought about it in the past- the first time he saw Cas, actually- but didn’t he always think that about a plump perfect pair of lips were made for sucking dick, man or woman?
“Oh, yeah, I wasn’t supposed to- fuck!”  Dean rubbed his face.  “I promised not to tell, but the angel Ezekiel is posted up in Sam’s body healing him from the trials.  Sam didn’t exactly...know he was saying yes to the possession...and I tricked him.  And now, Zeke won’t leave- I mean, it’s not a bad thing, he did save you when April stabbed you-”
It was an odd moment, but the relief that washed over Dean was enormous, and the urge to protect him became overwhelming.  Cas turned his face into Dean’s neck and rested his head on his shoulder, his warm breath a little ragged and puffing against Dean’s skin.
He blinked.  He didn’t mean like, ‘someone else’ instead of him, he meant like, just someone.
He’d never been a very spiritual person, but their connection felt like it was spiritual somehow.  They had the physical thing down, the emotional thing was a work in progress, obviously, and the spiritual connection, something that just felt right, like pieces clicking into place, completing the puzzle.
“Hello Dean,” he said awkwardly.
