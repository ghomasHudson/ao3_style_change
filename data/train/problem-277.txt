Between both Sarah and Mik, the game from Sarah’s hunt were skinned and butchered in a remarkable short time. Sarah loaded the meat back onto her sled as Mik grabbed John’s arm and tugged him out of the room.
Author's Notes: This took me a surprisingly long time to get right, considering how often I write Johnlock porn. I guess it is tougher writing AU. They're themselves, but...not.
Sherlock emerged into a dim hall, lit by even fewer torch lamps than any of the halls he frequented, even the ones from earlier. He could hear the various sounds of the kitchen just fine, but his sight was very encumbered by the sudden onset of near complete darkness. Sherlock rapidly realized that the servants obviously could not complain about the issue and therefore likely received a lower standard of everything available in the palace. Sherlock had not considered it before, but now that he realized it, it struck him as a matter of fact.
After the suite was deemed sufficiently safe, Sherlock and Jaituna were allowed to enter. At the empress’ request for privacy, the guards and servants remained in the sitting room, though Sherlock’s ever-present nanny was exempt from that order. She retreated to an inconspicuous corner of Sherlock’s room and Sherlock, as was typical, went back to ignoring her presence completely.
“That was when I was 17 though, Mik. I’m a militia captain now—I definitely know what responsibility is. Not to mention, I’ve become much better at predicting the consequences of my actions. You can trust me.” John cajoled. Mik looked dubious but nodded. John knew that Mik probably trusted him as a friend without a doubt, but as an employee for Mik’s business, one who had let the man down before, John had something to prove.
son. I told her that it didn’t matter, that you would be a part of our family regardless. But, when she told her father about everything that had happened, he told us to get rid of you and threatened us when we said we wouldn’t. Your mother wanted to think that he misspoke in anger, but I did not want to allow our family to come to any more harm. We moved away from him, to an entirely different district.
One of John’s favorite parts of the days he went to the market was the food. It was so varied because the established restaurants that resided on the street served very different fare than the vendors who lined the street with their stalls. The restaurants offered food for families, multiple courses including tea and dessert. The vendors often walked the length of the street multiple times, peddling their wares to passerby. Some sellers were so aggressive that they almost shoved the parcels into customers’ mouths, eager to share their food with others.
“Says the one who was just preaching that we should all aspire to be like a commoner. They aren’t even intelligent enough to join in on the game, let alone win.” Sherlock cast his eyes in the opposite direction of Mycroft. He did not want his brother to see his moment of weakness, that Mycroft’s derision had hurt him in any way.
His father’s hissed reprimand disrupted Sherlock’s focus on Mycroft’s lengthy deductions. Mycroft’s deductions had been growing in passion and, with that, volume, though both of the brothers had been too caught up to notice.
Though, honestly, the time had long since passed where they could truly be called children. John was 15, growing closer to manhood with the wane of every moon. John had even heard that, in lands west of his own, boys John’s age could already be promised to marry. He shuddered at the thought. Harry, whose voice was still loud enough to crack coconuts still on the tree, was 23 and still unmarried. John was, in turns, both grateful and annoyed. Surely, she would leave home when she married, he hoped, but then wondered if he would miss her. He had no idea since he had never truly been without her considerate, warm, and often obnoxious presence.
Appeased, Sherlock vowed to research as much as he could about the snake god’s magic at the nearest opportunity.
“He’s not that old.” John was slightly offended on his father’s behalf, but not enough to sound defensive, “And yeah, he’s fit I guess, but you’re really just saying that because you get tired and out of breath so easily.”
Harry came through the down clumsily, and for a moment, John wondered if she had sustained injuries, too. Then she straightened, swiped a hand out to paw at the box by the door and entered the house. She shut the door behind her and began fumbling around on the shelf. John could only assume it was for a candle.
The pitcher’s contents—wine, Sherlock could see—splattered all over the servant and the empty floor behind her. Sherlock angled his chest sharply upward to achieve a greater distance from the floor. When he had achieved enough distance, his body was in a near standing position, and it was easy for Sherlock to simply cancel the spell, drop the shorts ways to the floor and land on his feet.
At his hesitation, his mother drew back to study him. She followed his gaze and said, “Hadsana also knows about you. She was the woman who brought you to the palace. We honored her by keeping her on as your nanny.”
“Good,” Sarah responded as Mik dragged a doe, the largest animal in the pile, onto the metal hook in front of him.
“Oh my gosh, why are you doing that? Now is not the time for games, John!” Harry’s tone was both angry and wobbly, like even her irritation was not enough to quell the monumental fear she had experienced recently.
“I’ve met Wat. I like Wat,” Sarah said, then continued after a pause, “Your sister is something else, though. Can you hear me alright?”
Chala was pretty and nice, though, and—overcome by a surge of momentary embarrassment—John clung to his father’s pants leg and tried to hide his face behind it. There was not enough slack in the fabric, so he was only able to successfully hide one eye, which embarrassed him even more. As he felt his face heat with his blush, both Harry and Chala chuckled at his behavior.
John looked away from the herald to notice his father had straightened and was standing stiffly. His solemn gaze was directed at the herald, who did not notice.
“I said, let me help you with the tarp,” John repeated, and began gently pushing Harry’s shoulder to encourage her to move away.
“—your farm still suffered. You investigated and found that your husband’s bones had found their way back onto your land, quite possibly in the runoff from your neighbor’s land, but your husband’s essence was now so small it was undetectable. The land needed to be cleansed, and that is expensive, much more expense than your accounts can bear at the moment. And so, you came here to persuade the Crown to fund the endeavor, to help you clean up the last traces of your murder of your husband!”
Chala had seen John attempting to eat his own weight in desserts, but she had been in an indulgent mood, and the other guests had simply not cared at all. Most importantly, his father was too distracted to stop him.
They were passing a lone tree, crooked and leaning, looking one strong wind away from falling into the Sutlej and being swept away. John looked into it and froze in fear. Harry was perplexed by her brother’s behavior and stopped beside him.
John let Mik ramble on in that way until they were outside of the doctor’s residence, a building that had previously belonged to Mik’s family. After seeing Mik inside, John started his journey to the market which, conveniently, was not far.
John did not know why, though. Because papa said? Because Harry did it? He gazed up at the box on the shelf, a pale brown with a glossy finish, and pondered. He raised his fingers to his lips in nervous habit. “Mmm…”
John could barely think past how thrilling it all was. Being on the ground during an elephant stampede—his heart was
Harry whirled back to face him. She crowded him, jabbing her finger aggressively towards his face. She absently dragged the clay pot across the counter behind her, and John looked down at the scraping sound. Harry did not seem to notice she had done it.
To be fair, Harry was the loudest person that John knew. She was louder than even their father. On market days their father, Wat, allowed Harry to do most of the calling to customers since her bellowing voice was brash and high-pitched, carrying clear to the other side of the market and cutting sharply through the clamor of the marketplace’s assorted noises like the peal of a cymbal. If John yelled as loud as he could, his family could hear him from across the house. In the market, they could barely hear him across their stand. John was sure that if Harry yelled, he could hear her across the entire district.
Sherlock shot his gilded chair one last disdainful glare before clambering into the oversized thing. He wondered how, after all of the cautionary tales in literature and folklore, people still continued to fall in love and suffer for it.
Arranged marriages were not uncommon. Siger himself had arranged the marriage, though it had been an affair carried out between only him and Tufaena. Much to the empress' displeasure, she had only heard of her own son's engagement after the documents had been signed and sealed. The entire ordeal had taken place around the time Sherlock had been born, and even in all the time that had passed since then, it was still an underlying bone of contention between the imperial couple.
“That’s a wrasse, son. They come in a lot of different colors and are some of the most colorful fish out here.” Wat answered indulgently.
No one in the empire would ever openly say they did not love the empress, Jaituna. Still, no one could claim a love that came close to Siger’s. Rumors of the regard between Jaituna and Siger had existed even during her first marriage. After a brief marriage of political advantage to her first husband, who had died less than two years into marriage, the empress had hardly waited a respectable mourning period before marrying again. It had clearly been as much a love match as her previous marriage had not been, and it was apparent to anyone who saw Siger’s face as he spoke of her how very much in love he still was.
Harry was alright, if that’s what one liked, John allowed with a mental snort. John had not seen her from this angle all day, and only just now noticed that she had a dark smear underneath her ear. Probably a mishap when playing with dye at a friend’s house… kind of silly, but John looked back at the food vendor and, sure enough, he was gazing fixedly at her as if he had been struck dumb.
“And your father is your father. Mycroft does not know, and you can not tell him. You can not tell anyone.” His mother said as she rubbed Sherlock’s back soothingly.
Peripherally, Sherlock heard his mother inform the guards that they would head towards Sherlock’s room first. Siger’s voice had been a wispy sound, barely registering in Sherlock’s mind, as he had leaned over to Sherlock’s mother and voiced an enquiry. She had informed him in her usual calm tone that she would accompany Sherlock in returning to his rooms.
It’s Harry. I hope everything is well with you. Everyone back home has been talking about the border skirmishes, so I hope you’re staying safe. I doubt anything could pierce your thick skull, but it’s better not to gamble with that.
That reminded him of the cause of the majority of his whining. Even after all of the excitement today, he knew he would be just as bored tomorrow as he had been earlier that morning. Since they were in such close proximity and the atmosphere was still heavily charged with sentiment, it did not take Jaituna long to notice the discontent expression on Sherlock’s’ face.
And Sherlock really cannot be held accountable for losing a bit (read: all) of his composure at receiving the very gift he had not yet had the wherewithal to ask for.
Author's Notes: Trying my hand at real fic-writing, as in plot, not just PWP (whut is this concept.). I'm excited about where i want to take this idea, so I really hope y'all like it!
“Harry… Harry…” his father was saying, rubbing her shoulder and back to soothe her, “It’s alright, love. It’s over.”
“Let us just confirm,” she started, and then had to stop because she was laughing so uproariously. “Let us confirm that today you have fallen into a snake pit, foiled a regicidal plot, and—” she lowered her voice significantly, but it was still full of laughter, “—learned the secret of your birth, and the first thing that you say is that you are bored?”
“What?” John asked, sharply. The entire empire? “No way… no way any one person has that much money!”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft called, clearly trying to draw Sherlock into interacting with young Lady Tufaena. “Sherlock!”
So, why then, why was his father so tense? John realized that his thoughts were going in circles. He would simply have to ask his father, though he intuited that now was not an appropriate time, not with some strange lord gazing down on them like they were pets instead of people.
Wat stopped the cart in front of their stand and John and his sister moved as one to begin unloading the fish. They packed ice into the into the trestles on the table and then pressed the fish in over it, careful to arrange their wares by type and size. Wat had a leather belt around his waist, a gift from the thankful tanner, that held most of the utensils he needed to clean and cut the fish to the customers’ orders.
As soon as he was in her presence, he felt measurably calmer. Mycroft would not dare pick on him in front of their mother. She smiled warmly down at Sherlock and lifted a graceful hand to run affectionately through his curly hair. She smelled of orchids.
The clinic kitchen was clean and small for the size of the building, though it was larger than the kitchen in John’s home. The counter appeared to be made from some sort of pale stone, and the brick oven was set into the wall, likely attached to a network that allowed it to heat the entire building during cold seasons.
The abuse of power was disgusting, and the lapse of justice was disgusting, too; John vowed he would change that. He would change it all.
“Harry, grab that other end. I’m going to show John how we reel the nets in. Step back and be careful, John. Watch closely.” Wat tugged on the two ropes closest to him. John watched as his father insinuated himself between the ropes and the deck. He twisted slowly, turning his body around while he gripped the net in loose circles around his waist. The net slowly rose out of the water.
Jaituna motioned for Sherlock to lie down. Once he had, she pulled the covers up over his chest and arms and tucked him in.
John stepped away from the door. He swung the door shut and latched it, making haste to reach his father, who was waiting for him near their fence. Once united, they began the short trek toward the icehouse to retrieve the fish they intended to sell at market that day.
“What’s wrong, Harry?” John asked, leaning against the doorframe of the kitchen while Harry ate silently.
Mycroft’s gaze remained on the man, but the mean smirk that blossomed on his face caused the doctor’s confident speech to falter. The conversation he had with Siger was quick, something about land territory—Sherlock really was hardly bothering to even pretend to listen any more. Siger refuted his claim and the man left shortly after, successfully maintaining his façade of gentility at least until he had exited the throne room.
The person was small and paler than most people John had met. He?—John was guessing—He was dressed richly and clung to the elephant he was riding with enviable strength. It was then that John noticed that the elephant he rode seemed older and larger than the other elephants he had seen. The boy was riding the matriarch of the herd.
Wat had lurched closer to the spilled light of the kitchen lamps, and John was able to see his father dressed in a loose, overlarge shirt and walking with the aid of two crutches. Wat appeared smaller than John remembered, but John considered that may be just because John had grown bigger himself. Wat approached until he could wrap John in his arms in a bear hug. John noticed that his father leaned on him more heavily than before, likely for support in the momentary absence of the crutches. When Wat had leaned back and stabilized himself on his crutches, John finally looked back to Harry. She was glaring at the both of them.
“Hm… she’s from the Western lands. The soil there is slightly redder—smudges around the hem of her travelling dress, and the skin on her face has been cleaned recently but is still a little more lined than most ladies—the wind in those lands are drier. A noble, rich estate and not recently become so—her apparel is fine quality and bespoke, and her accessories elegant but not flashy.” Sherlock spoke under his breath in Mycroft’s direction.
Maybe he could construct another experiment on the rate of deceleration due to wind resistance versus the acceleration due to gravity. Mycroft’s insufferable assistant had interfered in the last one and Sherlock had not been able to record any conclusive results before he had been dragged away from the shattered pottery. Perhaps he could recreate it, could try again. The palace still had so many vases.
John was a bit tired after the long day he had, chasing after Harry and trying to keep his balance on the boat, swimming with the fish—well, falling into a tub with them—and cuddling up with his father smelling of salt, sun, and the river. Wat released John’s hand so that he could light the lamp above their front door. John leaned into his father’s leg and grabbed a handful of fabric to stabilize himself.
“Yes, that is what I am saying, Sherlock.” Jaituna smiled at him, but it did not show her teeth and looked a little pained. It was obvious that she did not want to send her son away. “I believe that we still have one or two allies that I trust to take you in and teach you their ways. I will speak with your father about it in the morning—”
“Six months!” Harry interjected, but John continued as if she had not spoken, though his voice became a bit more strident.
Wat eyed John for a moment, but then he looked back over at Harry and shook his head. “Let’s not today. I was trying to finish up patching these nets before you two got here. I’ll finish up with those while you two fill that big basin with water.”
Mik clapped a hand on John’s shoulder and he followed Mik inside. Mik was as jovial as John had come to expect, though his youthful roundness had distributed evenly and he was proportionately fluffy now. John thought it was a good look on him. Mik seemed more exuberant than John thought any man had a right to be after just being rudely awoken by a caller, but John was glad to see it.
As John exited the shop and returned to take in what remained of their stall, he stepped over bits of debris that had fallen not only from the temporary stalls but some of the buildings around them.
“Sure, thanks, papa.” John answered, and he and Mik watched Wat resume his quick steps toward the icehouse.
There were bushes along the plain, but few trees. The only trees present were fruit tree and had clearly been planted purposefully. A ditch ran parallel to the path they walked. Runoff water from the fields was gathered into a slowly draining stream, so slow the water was almost stagnant. Little insects lay on the water or were buzzing around it, their wings adding to the constant hum that was always in the background of John’s neighborhood.
He watched the curtain settle as the breeze died, falling back to their resting position. The silence resumed; without the wind, the music lacked the volume required to travel all the way up into his room. He could cast a listening spell, if he really wanted to hear it again. If he just went out onto the balcony, he could likely catch some faltering notes, but why bother?
“Alright then, go on and change into your nightclothes, my little sher. I’ll go and find a good book.” His mother offered.
Warnings: off-screen non-graphic rape of a minor character (which I cried while writing, tbh), bullying, temporary character disability, unrequited love because Harry runs through these paramours like the Hulk runs through buildings

He much preferred the soul and drama of the esraj, but no one inside the palace much cared for the opinions of the youngest prince. The spare.
“You realized you needed to move him, get him completely off of the land, so you bleached his bones, then hid them away into the animal bones going to grind in your neighbor’s mill. You hadn’t known beforehand that your neighbor’s runoff was coming onto your land because it had not made a difference. But even after you had disposed of your husband’s remains—”
Even after he had climbed fully out of the pit, more breathless from the adrenaline than the activity, Sherlock was almost in denial that he could still be alive after falling into the pit. He looked around, but he was alone. When he tried to regain his feet, he could not stand. His legs would not stay under him, even when he thought about the fact that the mage, and therefore Lord Tufaena, had gotten away and could be up to anything without anyone being the wiser.
Wat, who was behind John and outside of his line of sight, had been tense, but at this he smiled in relief. He gently lowered John to the ground.
) but the next time he deigns to acknowledge his surroundings, that is where he is. That's where he is and what he's done--but what does that matter? Why would that matter?

When she returned to the front of the house, she passed John without a word and took a portion of the food. John followed her to the kitchen.
My spellwork is as advanced as my tutors can get. Well, some of they say they know more but aren’t comfortable teaching it to
“Why do you look so unhappy about that?” John asked. Both Mik and Sarah looked over to John, though Mik looked away, disgruntled, when he saw that John was not addressing him.
And I'm combining Jim and Seb because, well, they are intertwined. I saw this art piece, and it was like....GUHYESIT'STHEM. So tons of thanks to the talented [bu-ko] on DeviantArt for this delicious MorMor:
Distress distorted Jaituna’s face for a moment before it smoothed over. “I apologize if I seem like I’m neglecting you, Sherlock. The empire has been in a state of underlying unrest for the last few years, and it concerns me. I do not want to worry you, but I do care about you, even when there are some times when I’m unavailable or unable to see you.”
“Your Majesty!” Sherlock’s nanny cut in abruptly, interrupting the empress’ speech. “You said you wouldn’t—”
I was just promoted to captain. I’ll ask for leave as soon as possible. I don’t know when I’ll be able to get out.
“Do not whine, Sherlock,” Jaituna’s voice was hollow as well, but the emptiness was a warning in itself.
“It sounds to me like you were both very brave,” Wat acceded, warm gaze lingering on both of his children.
The woman, who had been getting progressively paler with fear and then redder with anger, screeched as Sherlock finished. She leapt towards him, muttering a spell under her breath. Sherlock reflexively flinched and Mycroft made a movement to raise his arm to shield his brother but aborted the movment. Almost instantaneously, the protective spells on Siger’s throne, which extended far enough out that Sherlock’s chair was in their range of defense, took hold of the witch. The spell froze her in place, while the protective enchantments that had been placed on Sherlock’s person since birth caused the spell she had cast at him to fizzle into nothing before it came close to touching the prince.
Jaituna wrapped him in her arms once more. It was not until he was in her stable arms that he realized he was trembling all over. When he sucked in a sharp breath, the state of his sinuses alerted him to the fact that he had also been crying. Her warmth and her scent were the balm to his hurt, again, along with her assurance that she did truly consider him her son.
After lunch, they did a bit more business. At least half of their fish was gone, John surmised. Suddenly, Harry pointed down the street, a quizzical expression on her face. Turning to where she pointed, John saw a man running down the street. He was distinguishable as a herald because he wore the livery of a noble house, and John could see the paladin that presumably carried the noble trundling slowly along further down the street.
From behind the woman, a ghostly translucent hand had wrapped around the curve of her shoulder. The longer that Sherlock stared at it, the more corporeal it seemed to become, until it was so solidly visible that he almost could not see the woman’s shoulder through it. Sherlock raised a hand and pointed to it. His father and brother gazed in the direction he was pointing, though neither said a word aloud.
John stared and wanted like he had never wanted anything in his entire life. If only John could—if he could—
After several minutes of deep breaths, Sherlock tried to stand once again. This time, he was able to get to his feet, wobbly though they were, and head back to the dining room. He did not know whether his nanny would have excused herself already, probably saying that she had sent Sherlock back to his room or made up some other excuse to cover her lapse, or whether she was still at the table under the pretense of waiting for him. He did not know then, that he was not going to find out.
John soon made it to the clinic. Luckily, it was less than a mile away, though it could not have been an easy trip for Wat to make while still injured. John regarded the old office. Mik had updated it, planting flora up the walkway leading to the doors. Several trees lined the front of the building. John noticed that they were various fruit trees. Though some of the trees had ripe fruit, there did not seem to be much fruit that had fallen to the ground.
Here is part one of your bi-weekly, semi-monthly trash. John is sweet and Sherlock is sour, perfect snacks for a movie but with no nutritional value to speak of.
Harry was used to the untraceable leaps of John’s five year old jumps of logic and barely blinked at the non sequitur.
, it felt like there was a stone in his chest and a bird in his belly. He was so excited by it all that he could not even feel his own heart beating.
John was perplexed for a moment until she pointed at the second net pooled against the rim of the deck. John released an excited bark of sound and raced over to it, followed more sedately by his amused father, who guided John through a throw of his own while Harry watched and cheered John on.
Sherlock had not quite been prepared for the heat of the food that he had feigned eating. He had only been half-heartedly listening and arguing as his nanny had tried cajoling him into consuming some sort of heavily spiced, fried mush which she insisted was a vegetable dish. He had eaten a spoonful before involuntarily gagging.
In the second hallway he peered down, Sherlock spotted Tufaena’s man. The servant had a short stature for a man, with a cropped head of light brown hair. He was looking down at something in his hands that glowed with a subtle violet light in the torchlit hall. The object had obviously been charmed by a mage, though Sherlock had not yet determined whether the servant was that same mage who had charmed it or even whether the man was a mage at all. It would be odd for a mage to be a servant, since magic was restricted to those of noble blood. The man could possibly be a mage who worked in Tufaena’s household but, if that was the case, he was clearly hiding that fact since he was not wearing a mage’s robes.
“Wat’s sons are home!” She barely paused a moment to cursorily scrape some of the mud off of her sandals before shoving the door wide open.
Jaituna was frozen for a moment, her face blank. Abruptly, she drew Sherlock into her arms and held him tight. He was surrounded by her warmth and her floral scent as she embraced him, and it was enough to finally leach the tension from him. She pressed her face to his hair and her voice was wobbly for the first time he could remember. After a few moments, he felt her tears dampen his hair and understood the shakiness of her voice. His answering embrace was hesitant, but then it became strong, and he hugged her as tightly as she held him.
“It’s attached to the net, and we’re going to use it to pull the net up. Hopefully it’s got a loooot of fish in it, right?”
Jaituna stared at him for a moment. Other than her eyebrows, which had risen a minute amount in surprise, her face was unreadable. Then, she burst into chuckles.
Sherlock thinks he shook his head before he continued on his way out of the door, but he's not sure. He doesn't have time to sit and talk, though, can't Mrs. Hudson understand that? He must find John.
Sherlock absently noted an unpleasant tingling on his arm where some of the wine had spilled on him, but a choked sound stole his attention. He turned back, eyes skimming the shocked faces of the still seated courtiers. Palace guards had swiftly congregated around the head of the table where his mother and father sat and, to a lesser degree, around Mycroft whose gobsmacked expression mirrored the mage’s. The sound had not come from any of them, though; in fact, other than that one, truncated noise, the people remaining in the room were completely silent. Sherlock followed the gazes of most of the courtiers.
John held his Wat’s hand as they made their way home. The sun was still setting. Twilight was almost upon them, and the waning rays of sun shone bright red and orange across the grassy plains the family walked over. John squeezed Wat’s hand and leaned more of his weight against his father, focusing more on the play of light over the fauna around him.
There was a young woman outside of the window, standing at the side of the building and peering in at them. Her dark blonde hair was pulled into a sensible tail at the back of her head and she was dressed in drab dark brown clothes. When Mik saw her, he released an exasperated noise.
Jaituna’s gaze flicked momentarily to the cowering woman in the corner, a warning, before she took a deep breath and continued, “You and Mycroft are both my sons, but you are not like your brother.”
Sherlock pulled back from her and gave her a watery smile. Things were honestly not so different. He had always known that he was different from mostly everyone else. The only people he had been able to connect with had been his family and it was honestly sort of a relief to find out that there might be a reason for that, that it was not just because he was defective. As his mother rubbed his back, his gaze caught on his nanny, who was still shifting from foot to foot in the shadowed corner.
John considered silence might be the better part of valor in this situation. He held his tongue as Mik continued ranting.
This occurrence, often as it may repeat, warms something in Sherlock. It is certainly another piece of evidence of John's affection for Sherlock. As always, his doctor is taking care of him.
Then, John imagined how it must feel to the boy on the elephant, feeling something so much more powerful trying to rise up underneath him. A great wave of force that could topple him and trample him at any moment, and yet he had bested it, was besting it, riding it, bending it to his will and feeling each monumental step as though it was his own. John was afraid, yes, but amazed and thrilled and jealous, above all.
The woman cut herself off, apparently just realizing in that moment that she had interrupted the ruler of the entire empire. Sherlock’s looked up at his mother. She had a face like stone and was staring straight ahead with a thunderous expression. The room was deathly silent and Sherlock could tell by the tense way his mother had pursed her lips that his mother was holding back her instinctive response.
“Yes, it is not a new marriage. The ring is old, doesn’t fit her finger well—an heirloom, then, and lost weight with the strain of her pregnancy—but the skin around it is pale from lack of sun. She’s been wearing it for a while, then. Her stilted movements bely that the birth was recent, too recent for healing charms to have full effect, not that she would have been able to afford them.” Mycroft expounded with a hint of smugness to his tone.
Also, there is musical inspiration for the title. This is the song that I was playing on repeat as I imagined Sherlock playing his violin:
Sherlock peered up at his brother and motioned the servants to catch up with them, and he increased his pace as they neared the dining room. This displeasing conversation had dragged on long enough. “You’re being melodramatic, Mycroft.”
“And as I said, already getting in the way. As always!” Harry’s voice was petulant but she reached inside of the sash she had wrapped around her waist. Her hand emerged with two peaches. She handed John one and kept the other for herself. “I’ve brought almonds, too, for later. I want to share some with papa, so don’t eat everything!”
Don't worry about Sarah. She loves dead animals and not much else, lmao. She will not be making a play for John.
John's enthusiastic peal of giggles after this is Sherlock's first clue that his deconstruction may not, in fact, have been merely mental.
Sherlock searches both upstairs and downstairs for him, to no avail. He comes upon Mrs. Hudson, asks her whether she has seen John.
“Just got back last night, if you can believe it,” John said, watching Mik gather the necessary dishes.
Wat returned to them and sat cross-legged on the deck. He went to pull Harry down to cuddle next to him but Harry balked, crying that she was too old to sit in his lap. Wat laughed and pulled John down instead. Harry settled herself in against Wat’s side to stare at the fish with them. Wat angled his head down to speak in John’s direction.
Once John finally had the knife, Harry glared at him even more. She threw the mango at John’s head. John had been through extensive military training; the least he could do was catch something that was thrown directly at his face.
Wat gave John a wan smile and then resumed staring off into the distance. John felt awkward and wrongfooted, so he slowly took the bit of wall next to his father and mirrored his pose. A line of dark green ivy clung in a snaking whorl on the wall between them, and the leaves were still and tranquil in the windless evening. He waited for Wat to speak, but after a few minutes of complete quiet, John broke the silence himself.
By the time they had filled the basin, Wat had finished with his net and they had sailed out to a suitable depth to throw it.
His father had not flinched at the insult, but instead met lord Tufaena’s gaze. His craned his head up towards his father, who was glaring at the lord. John did not know much about how to address nobles, but his father’s behavior seemed fairly impertinent.
John carefully backed out of his father’s room, trying to make his footsteps as light as possible. Wat did not stir as John pulled the door closed between them, shutting himself into the hallway. John turned further down the hallway, searching room to room. He did not call out again because he did not want to risk waking Wat. The house was empty.
“You know how we touch this box every day when we come into the house, John. Do you know why?” Wat’s voice was light, but the tone was serious, which told John that this was something important.
“Eat, eat!” Mik ordered John, as he handed a plate of cold sausage and toast. He retrieved a sealed tin from the counter and placed it on the table as well. “There’s some fruit in here, if you’d like it.”
John shrugged it off and slid his bag off of his shoulder. It contained all of the belongings he had been able to bring back from his post, including the souvenirs he had picked up for his family he had been unable to send by post when the fighting had escalated. He continued into the hall that led out of the sitting room, which was the main hallway of their home. Each of their rooms were situated to one side of the hallway or the other.
A thickly keeled body slithered over his hand, wide enough to obscure the entire back of his hand. Sherlock yelled and flinched away, drawing his hand up and unseating the echis carinatus, the saw scaled viper. It was yet another one the four deadliest snakes in the empire and it was gazing at him too, now. To Sherlock’s count, that was three of the four deadliest snakes his land could claim; he did not feel it was necessary to stick around and see whether the pit offered the complete set.
“Well,” Mik said, shrugging as he went to unlock the clinic doors to allow the general public in. “As I said, I’ve got a few extra rooms. Just let me know what you decide.”
reply to your letter! And I’ve been having all of my pay sent back here! Haven’t you been getting it?”
Though the contents of the mage’s hands were concealed from Sherlock, he could see that the man’s hands were busy. Sherlock was still below, on the main floor of the dining room, so he searched for one of the hidden entrances to the kitchen or balcony. He knew that if he appeared frantic, he would draw attention from the diners and likely alert the man he was attempting to thwart. Sherlock’s heart was pounding a demanding rhythm in his ears, demanding he act quickly with the adrenaline spiking his brain chemistry.
As Sherlock reached the foot of the dais, he paused near Siger. Surely one last ditch attempt could not hurt anything.
John, however, clearly has other thoughts on his mind as he continues to regard the wall panel. Sherlock knows that--unlike himself and very strange indeed--John is quite interested in puzzles even
Jaituna was too controlled to let the confusion cross her face, but Sherlock waited a hopeful moment and she exclaimed, Oh! Yes, I do. Did you want to do that?”
As John approached Harry, he noted that she had mostly finished setting the stall up. It leaned to one side more heavily since the posts that supported it were set unevenly in the ground. John went behind their stand to retrieve the trestles in which the fish would lay, to set them on top of the stand.
Sherlock was a little intrigued by that, and he wondered if he could plot some way to get his nanny to do the same for him. He was undecided whether he truly wanted to, but could he actually manipulate her successfully into doing so? Already he had convinced her that the small amount of rice he had eaten was sufficient.
Sherlock glanced up at him, and then back down as he formed his reply, “But, no, she is clearly wealthy—”
“Ugh!” Harry threw up her hands and continued on, stomping towards her destination. They were headed for the bank of the Sutlej river where her father had docked his small boat. It was too far yet for them to see it, but they were not far from the shore. It had rained the day before, but most of the moisture had been absorbed by the marshlands and the banks of the river had fortunately not flooded.
“Are you staying here? I’ve got rooms to spare and it might be convenient. You could sleep in a little longer since you wouldn’t have to walk,” Mik said, trying to persuade him.
Mycroft tried to punctuate his statement by giving a pretentiously sniff, but the gesture was ruined by Sherlock’s inelegant snort.
John was not sure what to say. He and Harry were not on the same page, as he had assumed. There was a misunderstanding between them, and Harry clearly was not going to accept the truth. John had not bothered to prepare a lie—why would he have?
John entered the garden by the house’s backdoor. The trees and small garden in the small plot of land behind their home looked to be faring well, though it was slightly less lush than John remembered. Harry was not out there, either.
“But mummy,” Sherlock began, though he stopped abruptly when his mother fixed him with a hollow look. With solely the change in her expression, she was suddenly the empress who must be obeyed, no longer Sherlock loving mother.
“Let the side flap down, John,” Harry said in a put-upon voice, as if John had not just asked that exact question.
Home. He had been back home to visit since his abrupt departure ten years ago, but only to visit. Not like this—not to stay.
If Sherlock was romantic, he would say that the moonlight sluiced across John's soft features. Sherlock is not a romantic, and his logic is even less so; the London streetlights are bright in this area, and their glow throws half of his doctor's face into shadow and the other into sharp relief. If the window was open, they would no doubt be inundated with the scent of London after a rain--petrichor, geosmin (less present this far into London, because there is less soil--of course), and the unique miasma of chemicals that comprises the city's ever-present smog. Its thick perfume surely awaits their departure from the building.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft tried again, but was halted by Siger’s hand on his chest. Siger’s eyes remained focused on his younger son, listening pensively to his rambling explanation. The woman at their feet had gone extremely pale.
John figured there was no point in putting it off. First, he cleared the nightstand so that he could rest his candle there. There had been a lamp in John’s room, but it was not where it had used to be. John was not sure if that meant it had been moved into the mountain of items on the other side of the room or if it had been repurposed somewhere else in the house.
Harry dark eyes widened almost comically. She was so surprised by the dejection in the response that she stopped walking immediately and turned to stare at her brother. “What do you mean, ‘Yeah’? You’re not going to fight back?”
Harry walked over to the basin, clearly having done this before. Wat beckoned to John and then walked over to join her.
The servant that had been doused in wine had collapsed to the dining floor, seizing. As Sherlock watched, she rapidly turned a deep maroon, then purple, and then blue. A foamlike liquid had begun to ooze from her eyes. Sherlock stared, feeling eerily detached, and he realized academically that he had likely fallen into shock. Sherlock hardly noticed the guards that had come to stand around him until on stepped into his line of sight, blocking the macabre scene.
“Hmph,” Harry said, and pointedly turned her back to John in order to lower the fabric shade over the kitchen window.
From that, Sherlock could tell that Jaituna was still somewhat ambivalent towards Mycroft's betrothed, the young Lady Tufaena, though from what he had heard his parents say on the matter, it was not because the empress particularly disliked her. The same could not be said for the girl's father, Lord Tufaena, but for reasons other than the marriage or, at least, in other reasons in addition to the marriage.
John turned to look at his father, who he saw was looking ahead down the road. Sensing John’s gaze, Wat turned to look down at John, and gave him a rather vacant smile.
Sherlock could not put his finger on it, but his brain was screaming at him; something was wrong. It was not the way he normally experienced ‘feelings’ when his logic had made such vast leaps of reasoning that it took his mind some time to fully make sense of what he had deduced. Instead, it was as if a foreign entity was imposing a feeling of dread over him, something outside of his own mind. Sherlock did not understand it.
Mik’s eyes opened wider as he saw who had arrived, and John watched the man furiously rub the sleep from his eyes.
“I can’t hear!” Harry wailed, turning to Wat. John saw the shine of welling tears in her eyes. “I can’t hear anything!”
John smiled a bit at his friend, who had been talking nonstop ever since he had let John inside. John knew the last decade must have changed his friend in some ways, though it was somewhat comforting to see that the man was still a chatterbox.

Jaituna waited for Sherlock’s response to that. When all she received from him was a wide-eyed stare and stunned silence, she continued, “You were a gift from the snake god, the Snake Queen. Not long after your father arranged Mycroft’s engagement, and while I was still peeved with him about it, he sent a gift to me in a casket. When I opened it, there you were. Your father and I had been wishing so hard for another son that I first thought he had adopted one who looked like him, but then, you have always had my mother’s eyes. One cannot craft a life force from anything besides another source of life, so I had wondered what type of dangerous magic your father had gotten into. However, when I confronted him about the gift, he told me that he had sent me a coronet. When he had last seen it, it had been in the form of a snake. He was able to quickly call back the peasant woman who had sold it to us. She informed us that it was magic, which I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, my smart boy.”
John offered to help with the sled and only received an appraising once-over and a curt denial. They followed Mik into an empty room near the back of the clinic, where Sarah began to unload the meat.
John put all of his weight behind trying to pull out of Wat’s hands, pitching one way and then another, like a wild animal trying to escape a trap.
Or: sweet words, manipulative plotting, and passionate fuckery. And an introductory nod to Mycroft, if you wondered when that loveable bastard was going to get in on the story.
When the paladin began to pass in front of their stall, John could see the lord, who must be lord Tufaena, inside. The interior was heavily shadowed, and so his form was vague, but John could see his eyes glinting in the darkness, surprisingly staring back out at John and his family. The lord tapped the side of the carriage, and their progress halted. He turned on his seat to face them. He was close enough that John could tell for certain—when lord Tufaena smirked, it was directly at John. John was so shocked that he flinched.
Wat replied, saving John from possibly annoying his friend. “It is a surprise to see you up and running out of your house. Your windows are usually still dark when we pass your home this early in the morning.”
Tufaena tapped the side of the paladin and they resumed their progress. Once the carriage was mostly out of sight, Harry released her breath in a loud exhale. John turned toward his father.
“Imperial father,” Sherlock intoned, and then continued at a lower volume, “why do I have to be here? Isn’t this mother’s duty?”
“No.” Sherlock told the snake, maintaining eye contact. He did not know what he was denying, exactly, but he did know that there was no need to look away. He was not a coward.  He would look death in its eyes, brave like a true prince of the empire.
John knew that he would never consider Tufaena his father. The man was nothing but a monster. He was like the beasts in John’s books, preying on the innocent and the good. The authorities had the responsibility to take care of citizens like him and his family. It stung that they had not only condoned the attack on his mother, but that they were likely still dirty, corrupt and being paid off by the very person they should be prosecuting. Even dealing with the other revelations of the night, John could not stand the thought of the grievous injustice that had been dealt to his family.
“The estate has wealth,” Mycroft corrected, “though it is not hers to command. If it was, would she have come herself, newly from the birthing bed? No, likely the majority of the wealth is in some commodity, not easily liquefiable. Their estate uses it to trade with their neighbors, but the coffers are rather dry at the moment. Unhappy marriage, too, see how the husband has not accompanied his wife to this hearing? Likely displeased with the child then, or rather, his mistress is displeased with him finally having child in wedlock—”
One of these days, I will be able to stop my two-page chapter outline from evolving into a 10K chapter. I pray.
The phrasing reminded Sherlock of Mycroft. The smile that curled his lips was involuntary, but he allowed it to stay there. The longer they stood here talking and hugging, he began to remember what it had been like before her distance. He remembered their little adventures and traditions, rituals and secrets that were only for the two of them. Mycroft appreciated Sherlock’s wit at times, but Mycroft could never understand Sherlock’s inquisitive nature the way Jaituna had.  Did. He truly had missed his mother.
Sherlock could not imagine what his mother could possibly be about to tell him that required such a grave manner, but he said, “I promise, mummy.”
John opened the tin and discovered that Mik’s version of “fruit” was actually pastries with fruit filling. John took one filled with a red, gelatinous substance that appeared to be preserves made from some sort of berry.
This one was thinner in width and had no discernable stripes, but as Sherlock looked up he realized he was face to face with this one. Sherlock unintentionally met its eyes. He noticed the flared hood high on its neck, with a large dark splotch on each side respectively. The hissing around Sherlock had grown to an almost deafening timber, but he did not notice.
“Well duh, everything is from the gods. But they give us new seeds so that we can plant the trees for ourselves. So that we can have even more peaches.”
Sherlock overhead Mycroft mention Sherlock’s name to his dinner companion, and he ducked his head down to pick at his plate and feign eating.
The net slowly crested the rim of the ship’s deck. All John could see was a riot of colors: turquoise as vibrant as beads he had seen in the market, violet as royal and rich as what he imagined the emperor’s robes would be, silver bright enough to blind, and little dots of vivid yellow peeking through the weave of the net like sunlight through lace.
Sherlock thought that Mycroft had said the word ‘child’ with so much distaste that it could not possibly still be considered polite, but no one remarked on it. Lady Tremaine inclined her head in acceptance and favored Mycroft with an exhausted smile. She curtsied to them and left the room, business apparently concluded. Siger shot a dark look at his sons, which Sherlock knew meant they had better behave or Siger would try his best to make them regret it later.
“Ugh, come on, hurry up, John!” she complained as she grabbed his wrist, pulling him up so quickly that his shorter legs could barely stay under him. His father’s boat looked about twice as big as their house, which John had nothing to compare to but the homes of his friends, which were all about the same size.
John did not understand it—why now, why like this—a tear welled in his eye at the words. He was depressed but relieved. Mik had told him the same things but hearing them in his father’s voice made them more real, like hearing his father say it made it more… true. Harry was going to be alright.
Mycroft had also straightened in his seat. His posture was stiff and straight, but Siger maintained the same condescending air, presenting a façade that seemed both benign and impartial. Sherlock could not tell if his father was feeling what he felt, but perhaps Mycroft had been.
When Sherlock had been much younger, his mother had read a fable to him every night. As he had begun his studies and learned how to read, she had him read the story to her instead. Sherlock began reading the fairytale about the gardener who had befriended a bear, when he abruptly remembered his own adventure in the garden earlier that evening.
Sure, he might possibly miss being away from pretty much everything that had ever been familiar to him—his rooms, his teachers, the palace grounds, his nanny—but the familiarity of their presence was hardly comforting in his current situation. His mind was too idle, and he swore most days that he could feel himself getting more stupid by the second. If that went on for much longer, he really would break every vase in the palace. And, well… if his family was not gone, he could not miss them.
“Your papa’s pretty fit for an old man,” Mik commented. “Tall, too, not like us. I hope I grow to be that tall.”
John loved his family, and if they had truly needed him then the choice between staying and leaving would have been much harder. Wat and Harry had not needed John, though. They had missed him (and he, them) going by their letters.
“No, the Sutleg. We had a good day and according to the moon calendar predictions, the current on the Chenab should be favorable tomorrow. I’ll be throwing my nets out around there. Well—” here Wat wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulders and gave them an affectionate squeeze, “we will, if these two decide to come with me again. It was really great having them on board with their old dad, even if their energy for teasing each other does seem endless.”
Mik joined their brisk walk and genially clapped John on the shoulder. John closed the satchel for him and Mik chuckled.
“No, papa! I don’t want to be even shorter! I want to be taller than you!” John exclaimed in denial.
“Oh, yeah, I heard about that,” John said, and Wat nodded in agreement. “Papa was hoping to get some grease from him before he left, but he told us that he planned to be here for a while.”
Siger started at that, turning swiftly in his seat to look at Sherlock, the excess fabric of his robes falling around the throne in an uncoordinated cascade. Sherlock had barely felt the first stirrings of panic being the focus of his father’s scrutiny when he finally saw it.
“John, you clean up here and meet us at home. I’m taking Harry to see the doctor.” Wat nodded at John, who nodded back, and then took Harry’s hand to lead her out of the market.
Previously, his control over them had been absolute. Before John. Though Sherlock thinks he can surely at least partially credit this lapse to the fact that he hasn't slept in several days, as well.
Once he was level with the box, he noticed the carving around the lip of the box. Tiny flowers woven intricately in a chain bloomed in a circumference around the box. There were small chips of colored glass inlaid in the wood for the petals and the leaves and vines had been painstakingly painted with a delicate green dye. The blossoms, though miniscule, looked almost lifelike. The shine that reflected from the bits of glass made them look dew-kissed, like John had seen the grass and bush flowers were just after dawn.
“There are 55 different types of fish that live in the rivers in this area. Can you count that high?”
“Well you’d better! Nobody messes with Wat’s sons!” John knew by now not to question his sister saying she was a boy. Whether she identified as his sister or brother seemed to change with the wind. All that was constant—and all that truly mattered to John—was that he was always her favorite (and only!) little brother.
“Don’t let people push you around just because they’re bigger and louder than you! You tell Mik to keep his mouth shut unless he wants your sister to put her fist in it! And get your fingers out of your mouth. They’re dirty.” Harry’s face had suffused with color as her tirade continued, her cheeks reddening like the ripening plums that grew on one of the trees near their home. John admired his sister’s fierceness and the spark of a ready fight simmering in her eyes.
Sarah assessed John again, then shrugged and turned back to her work. Nothing in her voice gave away the annoyance that had shown on her face. “I think he might be cheating me.”
All this he pondered as he watched Mycroft and his fiancée. She squinted at his brother as if she could not make out his face clearly, features pinched in concentration. Sherlock heard his brother offer to procure a vision correcting charm for her—of course Mycroft would hardly deign to use his own magic for such a medial task—only for her to decline. According to her, her father was wary of foreign magicks in his home. Sherlock thought it might have been wiser for him to simply make fewer enemies, and certainly easier than maintaining wards that only allowed select magic to pass into his home.
“Sherlock,” Siger finally deigned to speak, but even his imposing father’s weighty voice was not enough to silence Sherlock’s runaway deductions.
John’s words seemed to shake Wat out of his reverie and he cleared his throat to reply, “Uh, yes. They said… they said she can probably come home in the morning or afternoon at the latest, though she may need some care over the next few days. Harry was pretty upset, almost hysterical, so they gave her something to drink, something to calm her down. Doctor Vihaan burned some herbs for her that were supposed to help her ears. I’ll… we can go back for her in the morning.”
I have some bad news. Papa has been injured. He got caught up in some rope while we were hauling one of the nets in, then he fell off the boat. When I was able to pull him back onboard, he was unconscious. Thankfully, the river was calm that day and I was able to get him out before he had drifted far. Mik is the town doctor now (I haven’t had to go and see that brat for years) and I went to see him. Papa’s right arm and right leg are broken in multiple places. Some of the bone shattered. Mik says the majority of the damage happened when papa was crushed between the ropes, not when he fell. He did hit his head though, and Mik says we’ll have to wait and see what damage is there. Papa wakes up for short periods of time, but he sleeps most days.
The pit was not deep, perhaps four feet, if not less. Sherlock landed hard on a roiling mass, but he could still see the night sky above him and the crumbling dirt of the rim of the pit. He instinctively dug his hands into the moving mass below him to find some stability. He could not see the mage, though the man could not have made it far in the short time since he had cast the spell. Sherlock listened for the man’s footsteps, to see if the man had continued running or stopped to see his handiwork.
"Wow, you're more knackered than I thought," John says, ignoring Sherlock's affronted expression and leading him by the hand into Sherlock's bedroom.
Sherlock saw the man round a corner and hear him say something in a foreign tongue. Could it have been a spell? Sherlock wondered. Why else would the man have spoken at this time—a threat for Sherlock to desist? But no, if that was the case, he would likely have called out before that moment. So likely it was a spell, then. That also confirmed that the man was a mage, and in disguise in the palace.
It was then that Sherlock heard the hissing. It was so loud and so close that Sherlock could only attribute that fact that he had not heard it before that moment to the adrenaline pumping in his ears and his intense focus on the chase. The hissing was close and on all sides of him. He looked down for the first time and saw the thickly banded black and yellow body of a banded krait. Bungarus fasciatus, his mind provided unhelpfully, capable of being over six feet long and determined one of the four most venomous local snakes.
John hesitated for a moment, unsure whether the thought he wanted to voice was appropriate. “… I want to eat it.”
Jaituna=jaitoon=Olive, which I think is a cute name for Sherlock's mom, and Punjab is an exporter of olives, so, there you go!
. Why? Why him? How? How did other people put up with the endless barrage of uninteresting things? Did the drudgery of it all fail to penetrate their vapid consciences?
John, your birth was a beautiful thing that came out of a sequence of ugliness. I was devastated to lose Emma, you know I was, I still am, and I won’t lie to you and tell you that I’m not. But I love my family more than anything, John, you know that. And though I wouldn’t trade either one of you for the other, I can’t regret you being born. You’re my son.”
Sherlock rises from bed, dresses, and calls to John. When there is no reply, Sherlock checks his phone. No messages, not even any missed calls (which John does on occasion when his hands aren't free or when he just wants to annoy Sherlock, whom he is aware strongly prefers to text).
Harry’s mouth trembled like she wanted to laugh also, but she held it back and renewed her glare at John.
Siger waved a hand and his guards approached from either side, dragging the frozen woman away and presumably to the dungeons. Sherlock was still breathless with excitement, almost panting, while Mycroft visibly composed himself after the unexpected outburst. Siger looked torn, likely between commending Sherlock on his findings or reprimanding him for his uncouth manners.
John was stunned and hurt. He had come home as soon as possible, and he had not been off playing around or whatever it was that Harry was getting at.
“Come inside, John,” Wat’s slightly muffled voice came through the door and John instinctively obeyed.
Sherlock orders a cab, exits the crime scene in a flair of elegance ('swept' John, not "swanned" for Heaven's sake), beckons John along, and has them on their way back to Baker Street in short order. John has some questions about the case, mostly a rehashing of events for his post-case writeup, which Sherlock easily answers with no effort.
Mik’s face began to redden in embarrassment, so John continued, quickly revising, “But honestly, that’s mostly because you’re always holed up in the temple or your room, reading books instead of getting any fresh air. I keep telling you to come and join our khuddo khoondi games so you’ll be used to more activity!”
As calmly as he could, Sherlock maneuvered his way to the nearest cloth wall hanging and peeked behind it. There was nothing but stone wall there.
“Apologies, mother,” Mycroft intoned as graciously as he could while still panting, a smile—tiny, but genuine—curling his lips.
'A Holmes never knackers and is never knackering,' Sherlock wants to answer but doesn't do so, since John is lowering himself into the sheets as well, sliding in behind Sherlock, and Sherlock doesn't want to say anything that might make John question his position. Sherlock does not want to say anything that will make John want to be anywhere but where he is right now, in Sherlock's bed (their bed, now, he vows) and beside Sherlock.
John is an instrument of illumination; his mind and sight are bright and keen, as is the gleam of his deep eyes in the evening dark and the sheen of his fine bristle of blond hair.
Reader's Notes: Apparently, it's more difficult to read torture scenes than sex scenes. Go figure. Creative criticism ALWAYS welcome.
As they approached their own home, Harry—with her patently boundless energy—released a woot and skipped ahead to their front door.
John seemed to be feeling a mix of emotions—slightly thrown by their sudden stop and also a bit depressed as he remembered the conversation he had with his friends, the neighborhood boys, a few days ago—which flitted over his young, unlined face. Embarrassed, he self-consciously raised one of his fists to his mouth to suck on, as was his nervous habit.
“Actually,” Harry mentioned, stiltedly, “I think I may have heard of that lord. Tupaina or something, right?”
“Oh, yeah!” Mik visibly perked up at the notion of returning to his future profession, “So, our district is pretty much untouched by it, and Vihaan thinks that’s because our water source is shared with the castle and a lot of other nobles’ homes. Vihaan says leprosy is a big problem in a few of the other districts, though. It can get pretty bad, and people try a lot of home remedies or try to make medicines themselves because there aren’t enough doctors to go around. He was happy I came to learn. Doctors can’t cure diseases fast enough and they’re spreading so quickly. We covered some treatments, such as bloodletting, like I mentioned before. Also, cholera! We talked about cholera! People have been trying to make their own medicinal tea, but it can’t just be anything, and they’ve been doing it wrong—”
“What’s that one?” John asked, wriggling enough to free his arm so that he could point at a fish that was a bit larger than his hand. Its head and tail were a deep purple, but most of its body was a speckled yellow gradient. It had an odd red speck near its gill that reminded John of the sun spots Harry and his papa had across their noses.
John finished slicing and peeling the fruit for Wat and handed it to him on a plate. Because it was difficult for him to stand for long periods of time, Wat sat down to eat. He and John caught up with each other: John told him about the battles he had been in and how he had achieved his promotion Wat talked about the how the fishing had been lately—even though he had gotten all of his information secondhand from Harry—about the accident, and his recovery.
Author's Notes: I'm so sorry, friends. I'm back at school, which means...write when can, desperately.
They had named the baby Jaituna, olive, after the empress. The baby’s face had been uncovered and John thought she looked like a person, but… squished. John was fascinated. Before her, he had never seen anyone smaller than himself. Even Mik, who was small for his age but a year older than John, was taller and broader.
“Oh, well, I don’t know.” Mik pondered for a moment. “I’ve only gone for a day, but yesterday we talked a lot about outdated healing practices, like bloodletting and ash tea medicine. I learned a little bit about leprosy and—”
“You constructed your husband’s murder, sabotaged his farming equipment until he accidentally killed himself. Made it so that you just needed to clean up the mess. You are a simply farmer’s wife and yet you came here with as much staff as some of the ladies who plan an extended stay in the palace do! You don’t like to get your hands dirty, and yet you had to dispose of your husband’s body. You allowed his body to rot on your land, but when the crops consistently failed, you knew he was taking his revenge on you.”
“And that’s why our ancestors made this. When we touch it, it cancels out all the magic on us, and since we don’t have any of our own magic, it doesn’t hurt us. If you don’t, there is no telling what kind of effect it will have on you, or on me or Harry when we touch you. Do you understand why it is important, John?”
“Your mom said you promised!” The woman’s voice was deeper than her youthful face belied, and John followed the conversation with interest.
John was frustrated with the unexpectedly incoherent way his words were coming out, but Wat seemed to know what he was trying to ask. Wat heaved a heavy sigh and his hands spread out on the brick of the wall behind him as if he needed it to lend him support. Wat opened his mouth to reply. It hung open for a moment and then, stymied, Wat gradually closed it. He shook his head as if to clear it and pointedly avoided meeting John’s gaze.
Peripherally, Sherlock caught movement by one of the doors exiting to the hall outside of the dining room and only just barely saw the servant Tufaena had been conversing with earlier slip out of the room. Sherlock spared a brief moment to beg his nanny even more intensely for a specific dessert that was a little out of her reach. Once the woman had turned away to grab it, he slid from his chair and under the table. On hands and knees, he swiftly crawled out between the legs of his chair and scuttled across the floor and out into the hallway.
Wat took a moment to answer, as if gathering enough breath for words was difficult. “No… Harry… thank… you.”
The building was bigger inside than it appeared on the outside, and John wondered if that was because of the layout of the building. He had been taught spatial maneuvers in the military and had some extracurricular experience with puzzles. John chuckled internally; he had never thought either of those would have any practical use once he had resumed civilian life.
Harry suddenly flung his hand away and yelled, “Race you, brat!” Then she was already yards ahead of him, kicking up the soft clay in her wake. John sped off to catch up. Harry, with her much longer legs, beat him to the boat while he was still a considerable distance behind her. She disappeared onto it.
“Mycroft,” their mother said reprovingly, though the hand she raised to briefly cup his cheek was gentle, “what a state you're in. You know better. Chasing your little brother around the castle?”
“And you came to see me?” Mik asked, cocking his head. “I’m flattered, John, though I’m also a bit suspicious.”
Sherlock ran as fast as he could, breathing hard now, but the man was still lengthening the distance between them. If Sherlock did not catch up soon, he might lose sight of the man. He followed the man to a small enclosure in the garden, walled in by hedges higher than Sherlock was tall.
John hesitated for a moment but then reached out a hand and briefly laid it on the wooden box. The wood was smooth and cool beneath his hand.
Most of his furniture had been pushed to one side of the room, against a wall. The only object hat was where he had left it was the bed, though it was covered with all sorts of junk that Harry or Wat had tossed there and probably forgotten about. He was tired, but he needed to at least clear off the bed before he could sleep here. His rigid military training had him biting back a sigh before he realized he did not have to suppress himself so much anymore.
The boys walked in silence for a few moments. Wat’s dislike of anything magic was well known among the families of John and Harry’s friends. Ironically enough, Wat’s wariness of enchantments led him to research them as much as possible, in order to know how to avoid them. Occasionally, a neighbor might come to ask Wat about a particular enchantment. Wat was always open to help them, though most of the conversations were hypothetical since Wat and all of his peers were peasants. Most of their neighbors lacked even the basic education that would allow them to work in a noble’s home, and since magic only belonged to nobility (or rather, anyone who had magic, which was hereditary, must have noble blood), they would rarely encounter any real magic.
What if a spell that was supposed to make him fly turned him into a rock, instead? The thought scared John. Even though he was brave, he didn’t want to end up as a rock or a frog or something gross.
Mik turned away from the basin and yanked a smock off of the top of a stack. John followed suit, tying it around himself by using his vague muscle memory of when he had worked in the clinic previously.
John had never known their mother; she had died while birthing John. Though he had never met her, she was still such an important part of their family—mentioned often enough at home and with her belongings still scattered here and there around their cottage like pearls on the ocean floor—that her presence had never really faded.
Wat was so tense and clearly rattled, so something must really be wrong, no matter how much the slur did not make sense to John. John felt he must be missing something. As John had tilted his head up to view his father, he had the errant thought—not for the first time—that Wat was unfairly tall… unlike John. But no, no, it could not be. Wat was his father, John knew. He may not look much like his father but he had not grown fully into his features. He could yet look like Wat—he had years—and John definitely looked like Harry. There was no contesting that they were all related.
“Why don’t you get someone else to sell it for you, then,” John asked, curious. “You said you knew my father.”
“Are you judging me, now? Is that what this is?!” Harry yelled, too loud in the small kitchen. John was loath to even try to touch her in this state, but he wanted to get some space or Harry would deafen him. “Not everyone can just run off when they have a problem, John! I had to stay because you wouldn’t and it’s stressful and I’m all by myself and I’m a grown woman and I don’t need you! I can handle the business all alone, I have for the last seven months and I can do what I want!”
"I love you," John says quietly. His gaze still bravely meets Sherlock's, though the returning gaze is half-mast from fatigue.
“Yeah, she loves me?” John asked bitterly, incredulous. It was only after he said this that he looked around and noticed that Harry had taken the bottle with her. It was probably even more liquor. John sighed heavily. This was not at all the way he had imagined his homecoming.
“I’d love to have you around, John, but you can’t just disappear like you did before. I’m currently looking for an apprentice, someone I can train up in medicine as a profession. I do want to help you, but I can’t give that position away lightly. It holds certain expectations.” Mik conceded, hands clasped in front of him. He relayed the information while looking John in the eye, and John could tell Mik was trying to convey how important the matter was to him.
Instead, he ponders the conundrum of needing something outside of himself, another addiction (this time, one he really could not control) that has begun to influence Sherlock, and seems primed to increase progressively as time goes on.
Some days, John wondered what their home would be like without her always pushing them around, their father specifically, who sometimes got fairly melancholy when left on his own. Sometimes, when he thought no one was looking, Wat slumped and wilted like vegetables left too long in the sun, as if he was exhausted simply by the weight of living. So, John worried for his father and blessed Harry’s nagging, some days. Other days… honestly, he just wished someone would come and get her.
From the corner of his eye, John spotted movement. He turned his head to look fully and recognized his friend, Mik. Mik was hurrying out of his own front door, though much more hastily than John and his father had that morning. He had a leather satchel clutched in his hands, top flap hanging free and swinging wildly, about to spill all of its innards unbeknownst to the distracted teen.
Wat laughed, a surprisingly full laugh that cast off some of the shadows that had been in his face earlier, “And it wasn’t even her horse, John! She had stopped and done all this for a stranger. I learned that when I approached to help her. She looked up at me and smiled, even though she was a bit sweaty from the work and the sun, and had dirt smudged on her face. And she was so beautiful, John, beautiful and sweet. You have her blond hair and her blues eyes.
As soon as Sherlock entered the room, he could tell that the golden chair on Mycroft’s right side had been hastily added there. Sherlock had not often been in the throne room, having no business there himself, but could still tell that this was an atypical setup for the room.
By the time that John left the house, the sun was rising and he knew that Harry was late. Their neighbors would also be waking up around now, and John could only hope that he would be able to make it to the clinic in time to talk to Mik before he got busy. For all he knew, Mik’s business could be slow, but he would rather not take any chances.
