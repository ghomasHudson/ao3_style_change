“I-uh-we havent gotten too much time alone recently what with the family staying here-dont get me wrong its great that they’re here, but I-um.”
“I’m sorry.” Sam wispered, pulling away from dean, then he said in his normal voice, “have you seen everyone yet?” They got in the car to do their rounds and talk to their enormous family.
“I’M TRYING!” Dean yelled, Sam nodded and calmly walked out of the room. Dean whispered under his breath a quiet and terrified prayer under his breath.
When dean had let everything out, every memory, every emotion, everything, the colors floated around, filling the meadow and coloring the flowers and grasses around them. Cas touched deans arm and watched as dean stared in wonder at the colors he could now see. Cas got up to allow dean space as the prayer had gotten quieter, not silent but quiet. Dean stood up with him and out of nowhere pulled cas into a hug, not a platonic pat on the shoulder and handshake kind of hug but a meaningful, chick flick hug. Deans arms where wound around cas’ neck, while cas’ were around deans waist. Dean pulled away slightly but didnt loosen his grip on the angels neck, he looked at him, looked straight into the ocean of blue that he easily got lost in. Cas met deans piercing green eyes and saw the emotions behind them, the thoughts, the feelings, but he couldnt place them. Dean saw the flicker of hope in teh angels eyes that quickly faded into sadness, to pity. Dean dropped his gaze and turned away, his hand trailing down cas’ arm as he did. As his hand reached cas’ wrist he felt cas yank him back around, facing him. They stood close together, still staring into each others eyes, dean planted his other hand on cas’ chest when he spun, cas still held deans wrist with one hand and the other was gripping his waist. Cas held deans gaze and broke down his walls, letting dean see everything he was feeling in that moment and pressed a tentative kiss on his lips. Dean just continued to look at him, slightly shocked, then he grabs cas’ face with both hands and pulls him into a heated, open mouthed kiss that didnt break for quite a while.
“Yeah. I think so. Its a work trip this time, a definite start and end time, he has his phone so he’ll call every night. The whole, sappy couple bullshit.” Sam shrugged, trying to stow his worry,
“Sorry I wasnt there.” He said quietly as dean wrapped his arms around cas from behind and kissing his neck.
“says someone who puts a good quarter cup of sugar in his coffee.” He said under his breath making cas smile despite himself, hes pretty when he smiles thought dean.
“I don't care, I haven't been here to kiss you or wake you up or anything, for four weeks.” Dean smiled and pressed a kiss to his forehead,
I finished it! Im so happy to have this completed, I know it’s probably not the best ive ever done but i hope its satisfactory! Enjoy!
“I can't just be friends with you, I can't. If you make me, I don't know what I’ll do, but Cas, I cant live without you.”
On day a year or so after their first kiss Dean woke up next to his boyfriend and decided that there was one other thing he needed to draw. He grabbed a marker, kissed cas to get his attention, which he already had, and drew a small ring on cas’ finger in the shape of the infinity symbol. Cas watched him draw it and he grabbed his face and kissed him like his life depended on it. After making out for a while, cas took the marker and did the same on dean.
They spent the next week being the most stereotypical, fluffy, chick flick family they could. Dean drove them to Jodi’s, Cas in the front and Jack and Sam in the back of course. They had meals together, went on a hunt together,  and Jack and Cas spent a good long time messing with their powers while Sam and Dean were researching.
“And yet here you are.” Bal barely kept the snarl out of his voice so that he wouldn’t get the mom voice again,
Dean spent the next few days sweeping and mopping and reorganizing and re-reorganizing. He helped plan and pack and on Friday morning he said his goodbyes. Jodi packed everyone into thier cars and checked their seat belts, dean made everyone lunches, and rowena would never admit it but she snuck an extra pair of underwear and socks into everyone’s bags. As Sam and Eileen drove off in the old, navy, men of letters car that dean had fixed-not that it needed much- dean waved until they were out of site and went back inside to do god-well who knows what as it had probably already been done a few times.
After weeks of cases and research and new arrivals, of visits from Cas, and smaller breakdowns from Dean, and quite a few hunts, the boys still had no leads. They had created quite an army of old allies and acquaintances and they had been popping around the world locating and tracking all their previous kills, with seemingly nowhere to go that was their best bet. Dean prayed to Cas every night, telling him about his day and anything that was on his mind. He liked to think that they were like little love letters, so by the end of each he’d get sappy and cute and address it with things like
“I’m not planning on it, but I’m sure Cas would get to me first.” He says chuckling. A similar exchange takes place between Sam and Cas, though that conversation had been had a few times already. On one memorable occasion, after Dean had yelled at Cas, sam had locked them in a room together and screamed at them that they were family until they stopped fighting. He had let them out of the room only after he threatened to kill them if they hurt each other, in any way, again. The song ended and Sam and Bobby walked off the dance floor, the later muttering ‘Idjits’ under his breath.
“I did.” They sat in silence for a while, cas letting dean emote. He tried not to say anything but he couldnt, “dean youre praying to me.”
“I killed a bunch of those assholes in the empty and now we have to figure out how to kill them again! “
“what if he doesn’t love me anymore, sam. He's been gone for so long, what if he doesn't want to come home.” Sam gawked at him before smacking him over the head,
“I did.” They sat in silence for a while, cas letting dean emote. He tried not to say anything, but after a while he couldn’t, “Dean you’re praying to me.” Cas said with a small smile,
I think there are 11 chapters done at the moment, just some quick read throughs and things. Life’s busy but I hope to get chapter 7 up in a few days.
Im starting some knew stuff with a couple knew fandoms but i dont know if I’ll post it, but stay tuned!
Dean walked through the bunker doors behind cas, carrying their bags and shouted at Sammy that they were home. Sam walked out of the library carrying a book,
“I AM! YOU MAKE ME THIS WAY!” Gabriel yelled as he stomped off to the room he was put in last time he was there.
“If you’re not here then there's nothing to live for.” Dean said opening the door and walking out into the hallway,
“More alcohol?” There was a cheer and cas materialized a case of beer and some fancy whiskey. Dean and cas walked into the living room and sat on the floor leaning against the couch as everyone else settled around them.
Cas pulled a face when he found one file under the name John Winchester, he stared at it in disgust then flipped through more files, some empty, some occupied.
“Ravish me on the counter huh? Better than a wall i suppose.” Cas giggled a bit and pulled dean into a kiss.
“Hey, you want to look around?” Sam asked nervously. Eileen walked around the bookshop running her fingers over the meticulously organized and dusted book spines. After a couple minutes of browsing and slightly uncomfortable silence sam quietly said,
“I’ll try. Thanks Sammy, I’m proud of you.” Sam smiled at his brother, and hugged him. “Alright, no chick flick moments.”
“wow, I thought you were joking.” Dean looked at sam on eyebrow raised, sam just sipped his coffee and shrugged.
“Hiya Sammy.” He said, he turned and hugged his little brother and tried to conceal how horrid he felt, how angry, how sad, he felt that his brother didn’t get all he deserved.
Maybe I even looked up to him in a way. Or maybe it was envy. All I know is that I could be carefree around him, in peace and calm, because the thing I liked most about Rick was that I didn't have to protect him. I have so many people in my life that I need to protect and save and keep saved, I need to look out for them and sometimes even have to make sure they make their own right decisions. It’s this constant task I have burdened on my shoulders, and while all people want to protect their loved ones, in my case I actually do have to protect them on a regular basis and with my own life. And I would die for any of them, I would die for all of them. I would die for you, if I had to. But that task kept me on my feet day and night, never left my conscious, never let me sleep unconcerned and peacefully. So it was nice to have a friend I didn't need to look out for, because Rick was capable of protecting himself.
The lion roared and Cas winced back. It advertised its presence, warned him to stay away, this much Cas knew. And when he looked into those emerald eyes again and found that they appeared uneasy as much as they seemed unsure, he recognized his friend.
She fumbled with his jeans, while he was placing kisses all over her neck and collarbone. One hand moved from her boobs down her stomach. When he tore at her underwear, she was already pulling down his boxers. They were so desperate. So fast. So little caring about foreplay that they didn't even bother to fully undress.
For a moment you just looked at me and I found the anger disappearing and doubts coming up. And you said, “What if someday it ceases?“
He stumbled to his feet, a little shaky, got off Cas, let go of him. Cas looked up, not at him but past him, then back to the ground only an inch away from his eyes. His cheek rasped against the floor, as he slowly sat up. Castiel wrapped his arms around his own body and his eyes fixed his knees and his hair was all messy by violent hands pulling at it. There were no tears in the angel’s eyes, because he never cried.
, Dean could feel them thinking, as he looked back into those blue puddles of sorriness and worry that were Castiel’s eyes. He couldn't stand it. They all needed him to be something, always. They needed him to be safe and needed him to keep them safe as well and needed him to talk to them, but kept quiet themselves. He had to be father and protector and leader and guide and brother and nanny, whatever the hell the situation required. And he, he only wanted to be Dean.
He’d been thrown out. He’d been cast away. He’d been banished from the place that was supposed to be his home and from the people who were supposed to be his family. Yet, he had only himself to blame.
Dean sighed and put down his own bags as well. A skyline of brown paper bags lined the border between them, but that didn't make their mutual stare at one another any less intense. It was only a question of time when one of them would bulge and give in or give up. Only a matter of who was smarter and who was not. But Dean knew, Sammy had a hold on him. A key to his mind that would open him up whenever he wished and no matter the height and strength of his walls.
Dean felt a spark of victory in his stomach, a spark so little, yet so potent to light the world on fire. It shouldn't flatter him as much as it did, but it was the only upper hand he had left. There was a starting fire within his state of drowning in the blindness of not knowing who he was up against. What threatened to kill that fire, though, was the feeling of being analyzed straight down to his very bones. A complete stranger told him about his observations and once again it was all about Dean. And nothing good ever came from that.
“Yes, I…,“ you stammered, but never finished your sentence. You seemed lost in your own head, stuck even. I could see how your eyes were moving to and fro, unsure where to settle, because really, they weren’t searching for something in this room, but for something in your mind. It was as if there were endless possible constellations of opinions in your head, and you just couldn't tie yourself down on any of them. I watched you struggling and thought to myself, maybe you didn't want me to go without you. And I didn't want to go without you either. I was excited to see Rick again after such a long time, but Rick was not you. And I saw you worrying about something, even when I couldn't quite grasp what it was yet.
And I didn’t, and still don’t. I have no other choice than to watch over you, like your mother has promised to you. A promise must be kept, even when I am not the one, who’s made it. I have to do everything, know everything about you, learn everything about you, because only then, I think, can I be the protector you need and deserve. I admit, it’s not the whole truth. I enjoy watching you, no, I love it even. And I have this feeling inside of me, it’s hard to explain. A feeling that demands to be with you, that demands to be a part of you. Like a drug it pushes me and demands for more and even more, and I don’t have the strength and even less the will to withstand it. Because you are my monster, and I need to study you. And I need your closeness like I need air to breathe. And so you’re right after all. I need you.
A frown Dean couldn't decipher, nor could he pay any attention to it, because there was the black eye. Sprawling out below Cas’ eye like a painting in blue and red and brown and yellow. And Dean reached out, his own frown starting to build on his forehead and between his eyebrows.
That part that leaned in and inhaled Cas’ scent. Or breathed in through Cas’ hair and noted how it smelled like paper and trees and human in that entirely new way that he had yet to get used to. That part that touched Cas’ chest and his neck and felt the warmth radiating from the other’s body. That part that moved his hand under Cas’ chin and his thumb under his lower lip. Just barely grazing it with his fingertip and feeling Cas’ breath along the skin of his own fingers. That part that said Cas’ name in that way he always used to say it, and it still meant everything. An everything he still didn't understand. And maybe, he thought, maybe that was what made a difference. Maybe that was what could make him stop after all.
He looked out the window to the garden behind the motel, the lawn dark green and black and the trees standing in silence. And at the autumn leaves falling from these trees, leaving them all naked and raw, but still beautiful. They’d be uncovered and unprotected for the entire coldness of winter, only to bloom and blossom again in spring. But not like nothing had ever happened. Like they grew stronger with every lost leaf and with every season of nakedness. Like a test to show how strong they really are.
It had come out so fast that Cas had barely even realized he said it out loud. Now that he did, he closed his eyes and balled his fists into his trench coat, in the drastic knowledge of what he’d done.
Castiel was striding among racks and racks of food and liquor and other things. His hand was holding brown paper bags with a chicken logo on it, containing food from a diner. His other hand was brushing the racks, desperate to find what he needed. He’d been searching for almost half an hour now and he came to the bloodcurdling conclusion that he was helpless.
“That’s cause downright anything can be related to The Lion King! It’s an awesome movie!“ Dean said, regretting it when he looked at his surprised brother. “I mean… it’s okay, I guess.“
“So, uh, what are the thoughts on Mr. Niceguy?“ Dean asked awkwardly, because sometimes working a job is the perfect excuse when you feel too vulnerable to deal with feelings. “You think we should hunt him down?“
His heart was pounding so hard against his skin, it hurt, and he felt sweat building on his forehead and temples. The room was dipped in silence and calmness, so quiet and peaceful, but inside him there was harsh and fearful disarray. Calamity. Misery. Catastrophe. Cas kept staring at him, so naked and raw, not a word leaving his lips only inches away from Dean’s.
When he glanced up and frowned, Cas looked down to his shoes and said, “I uh… Sam wanted me to bring you some coffee.“
The Winchester frowned, but couldn't help a tiny smile creeping on his lips. “There’s nothing to talk about,“ he said and walked over to the kitchen table and sat down.
Dean lowered his head, pushed the heels of his hands into his eyes. He exhaled. Cas inhaled. Dean walked out of the room, almost running.
After he’d texted Sam, there came another sudden realization. He was trapped in a room with a big and angry cat of prey. And if Dean was capable of hurting him in his human form, with huge paws and pointed claws and a jaw that could rip him apart if he so chose, he was now even more so.
There was an idea inside me. An idea that worked on making sense of it all. And was it only my cruel fantasy that wanted to make me believe the world is bad and everything in it as well, but I believed, no, I hoped not to be forced to believe, that there was a connection between the stain and our last case. The doubt inside me grew more and more and was pointed at you like a gun I only had to load still. And yet, I was afraid of the truth, no matter how much I sought it. And yet, there was a small part of me that wanted to come to you to the kitchen every night, a part that still believed in you. A part that didn't want to give up on our togethership and also not forget.
After a while too many, Cas spoke again, his head bowed down. “It started when… I told you that my faults and my sins in heaven make me fall from heaven. That I will turn human, eventually.“
He emptied his glass and put it down and for some reason, let it be the bitterness of the whiskey or the storm of disgust within him, his jaw clenched. A glance to the side and through the dull darkness of their room told him that his brother was sound asleep, sprawled out on his bed and half his limbs hanging loosely from the edge of the mattress. Dean ran a hand over his face, took a breath into his stomach.
Cas lowered his head and squeezed his eyes shut. He only now noticed the throbbing pain in his head and the numb feeling in his hands.
“I found a job for us,“ you answered randomly and your active motions and the fast movements made me nervous.
She looked back up at Sam, then at Bert and Castiel. None of them said anything, all of them poring over the words they had just heard.
The Winchester whirled around, abruptly let go of Cas and sucked in a painful breath. Sam was standing in the doorway, his face all shock and horror, breathing heavily.
And then there were the things Sam knew about himself. He knew that there must be something he’d missed. Maybe he was too distracted or maybe he was too busy, but even with his eyes wide open and looking directly at the problem, he couldn't quite see it. He knew he needed to find it and knew he needed to do something about it, but it was hard with all that was going on. Three cases and a possible big bad playing them. And then there were things in his own head obstructing the view and keeping him from thinking about how Cas looked a little more miserable every day.
There had been a thought somewhere. And maybe that thought shouldn't go to sleep, Dean had thought. Maybe it should bleed instead. Maybe he had to make sure it bleeds, it could be.
At some point, Bert had tuned out of the chatter and turned to his bowl of chili. Speaking words so soft and gentle that Dean almost forgot how weird it was over his own proudness about how good his chili was. Bert was obviously talking to his food, because he was Bert, and it was a biological necessity.
Cas looked back at him with a dead face, and Dean couldn't stop some desperate sound escaping his throat. His face fell the way Cas’ became stone, and then he kept those tears from running. His hold on the former angel tightened again, he almost snarled.
And Dean hesitated again. He looked at Sam in something like unease, wide-eyed and his mouth forming a silent “O“.
“Uh, a couple of years ago my entire family, my mum and dad and my sisters, they were all turned into werewolves and attacked me, in order to turn me, I guess. But I managed to fight them and then Bobby, you know, Bobby Singer, he showed up and helped me to… get rid of them.“
But the feeling wanted out. Whatever feeling it was, it pushed against his skin. Clawed into his innards. Choked him in every way possible. From outside and within, at his throat and in his chest and in his stomach. It almost made his heart stop. Or accelerate. Or jump out of his body.
“Stop!“ Dean yelled. He ground his teeth and exhaled a sharp breath. “Just stop it, Cas. I’m not a fucking kid, I can take care of myself. It’s fine.
Through the window I saw you packing, it seemed you were headed out. I decided not to be too harsh with me and allowed myself to get on the backseat of your beloved Impala. You wouldn’t see me of course. You got inside and before you started the car, you took your phone.
The hallways had no Cas. The Winchesters’ bedrooms had no Cas. The guest bedrooms had no Cas. The kitchen had no Cas. The war room had no Cas. The library had no Cas. The basement had no Cas. And then the garage, it only had a Bert.
A call had made it all possible. The run. The escape. The ultimate chance to get away. It had sounded like complete bullshit when Sam had told him about this maybe-case in this maybe-not-too-bad-town. Dean thought he wouldn't find squat here. Further investigation had proven to him that, indeed, there was nothing “on fire“ or “burning“ or even “out of the ordinary“ about said sea of fire.
A few steps into the haze on softly frozen grass he turned around back to the train station. It was gone and so were the train and the rails it had gotten him here on. His face darkened a notch, though he didn’t know why.
“Ah, you’re awake,“ a familiar deep voice said. The trickster entered the room from somewhere, holding some half-eaten pastry in one hand and a tray with more pastry in the other. He sat down on the big red couch and put down his tray on the oak wood coffee table between them that — Cas only just noticed — seemed to have waterfalls for legs. “Did you have a nice nap, Castiel?“
And while he wasn’t sure which was worse, killing yourself or being killed, he knew it didn’t really matter. Even if we don’t actually kill someone in our entire life, we’re all killers in a way. We’ve all killed parts of ourselves in order to survive our life. We’ve all got blood on our hands. At some point, something always has to die so we can stay alive. Let that be people or ideas or wishes or ways of thinking.
Yes, back then, he’d had his leather jacket to feel protected, and his necklace from Sam to feel wanted, but it didn't matter anymore now. He couldn't do anything to fix his own life, but he could do something to finish this case. He would go after Anansi and he would kill him.
“No,“ Anansi gave back with a quiet chuckle. “There once was a bird named Woodpecker that promised his mother to bury her into a stone. The mother was very sick and about to die, and the woodpecker went to bore a stone. Then he turned back and said, “Mother, I try the stone, but I can’t bore it. I’ll bury you into wood.“ And he bore the wood. And after his mother’s death he buried her into wood. That is the reason the woodpecker bores wood.“
Bert sat down on the second bed and stared at Dean, who felt particularly victorious. He knew Sam had been cooking something.
Dean was still half asleep when he walked into the kitchen. The bunker was mostly still quiet after their short night, but he could hear the distant noises of everyone setting themselves for the new day.
“To work your mojo, dumbass,“ the hunter gave a little too loud. Though, as he looked around, he found nobody was paying them any real attention. Except for Dr. Flirty in his corner.
It was an unusual order, of course. Dean never ate veggie burgers, even less any salad. His onion rings were the only thing dripping of grease and they somewhat fit into his usual diet of unhealthy and whole and leading straight to heart failure. It’s the little things that count.
“Cas? You okay?“ I asked, when I watched you falling onto one of the chairs, looking like a kicked dog or a sad kitten. You glanced up at me and even when something somewhat happy flickered in your eyes, I could see that you were struggling with something.
There was a bottle of liquor in his hands and it was Vodka. Now, Dean didn't like Vodka, but he hadn't managed to find anything else. It was half empty.
Dean was annoyed anyway. By yet another kidnapping they hadn’t been able to prevent. By having spent the whole afternoon in close proximity to Bert and Bert’s weirdness. And by Sam’s eagerness to spend hours on end with research on tracking down demons, the traces of that still scattered about their room in the form of books and paper. And last but not least, by Cas’ ongoing quietude.
Dean looked down at him, holding him tight by his collar. There was so much anger inside him. So much rage, he felt like he needed to defend himself. Fighting is a working strategy.
I followed him into the kitchen and sat down at the table. He told me about every detail. Things I already knew, things I just supposed, and things I didn’t know. And inside me a big stain spread out, dark and almost painfully it took in everything in me and crushed me. Even only thinking about it now makes it grow again. I couldn’t breathe. I had made a terrible mistake.
A small waterfall swam over him and his boots and colored the hem of his jeans a darker shade. He went inside and discovered it rather assembled a swimming pool now. The brownish flood water covered the entire concrete floor of the majestic hall and reached up to every door of every vehicle inside.
is not a word, you know.“ Dean grumbled, his eyes still fixed on words he didn’t read and pictures he didn't see. “You can’t just superlative a superlative.“
Cas peered at him from the corner of his eye, then back down to his thighs. He’d been sitting in this chair for about thirty hours and his legs felt numb and yet ached. He felt stiff and tired and at the same time like he was about to melt.
And I really think that. It’s rare like a unique artifact or a treasure in the depths of the ocean. Or an angel, who has turned his back to all his tasks and duties and his home to follow a human, who couldn’t do anything for him and still meant everything to him. Barely anything else is important for me. And could I do anything to see that smile every day and every minute, I would do it. And could I do anything to cause that smile, I would do it. But for the moment only realization and win could do that. And maybe one day you realize, that I am the win. That I am the one person on this planet, in this universe and in your world, who that smile should be directed at.
Minutes passed and silence was the superior feeling in the air. Castiel was stiff, hoping for the best and expecting the worst, and he swallowed that desperate lump down his throat. The room slowly absorbed the scent of fast food and sugar and Cas was waiting. Waiting for the right spark to light the world on fire.
Sam made a gesture as if to say ‘that’s it‘ and I agreed with his conclusion. With a smile I looked around in our room, as if to search for someone, and something inside me wished that someone was actually here. And that someone was you, Cas. I wanted to share our realization with you. I didn’t know why, but I had this urge inside me to feel your presence, to notice your scent, to hear your voice. But I shook it off. I almost even felt ashamed for it. Because what I needed even more was to know about your safeness. That’s what I always need.
“Cas!” Dean whined, “such a mood killer.” Dean kissed him once more before curling his legs around Cas’ calves and cuddling up on top of him.
Cas appears on the edge of the meadow watching dean sit in the middle, just feeling. He sees the emotion pouring off of dean, the colors spilling over the meadow. He watches as bubbles of emotion pours off of him, changing color with his emotions. He watches contemplating whether or not to answer the prayers. He slowly walks through the meadow to the tree and silently sits down next to dean.
“Yama only came because Shoyo wanted to.” Another one pointed out, making the one that must have been ‘yama’ blush.
“Good morning dean.” CAs moved to get off the bed and let dean have his space. Cas hadnt meant to stay all night and into the morning, but he got sidetracked in his thoughts.
That night dean and cas were sitting on opposite sides of the library not speaking, cas was taking notes on lore on his arm and dean, who was supposed to be researching reversal spells, was staring at the writing. Sam walked in, groaned, and pulled dean and cas up out of their chairs and into deans room.
“I-“ they had gradually gotten even closer, thier foreheads almost touching, thier breath mingling, thier noses brushing together occasionally. Cas looked into the fan fiction green eyes and leaned forward a bit, dean met him in the middle. Dean still holding the beer wrapped both arms around cas’ neck, cas snapped and the beer landed on the table, he pushed dean flush against the wall and what started as a fond, sweet, i’ll be it-chaste kiss, turned more heated, still filled with all the emotions they could barely voice. After a while, dean placed his hands on cas’ chest and broke the kiss, cas looked at him fear and nerves in his eyes, he started to turn away but dean held his coat lapels and pulled him close again, just close enough for thier foreheads to touch,
“like what? That youre the most gorgeous human ive ever laid eyes on? That I treasure every day I spend with you? That you make me so unexplainably happy? That-“
He flipped to a page at the end of the notebook, it was blank but in the binding was a picture. It was a picture of him and Cas in their cowboy hats, leaning against one another, roughed up from the hunt, they were smiling. Dean looked at the picture again and noticed how their hands were so close, he noticed how hot Cas looked, he noticed how much time they’d wasted. Dean smiled at the picture as if he had lost the love of his life forever, he thought about the last movie him and Cas had watched about the wife who died of pneumonia. He felt a tear run down the side of his face and he blinked the rest of them away. He huffed a laugh and remembered that Cas wasn't dead, he was just on a work trip. He turned the picture over and written on the bottom were the words-
“You’ve been avoiding me, you haven't responded to any of my prayers, you broke up with me and then disappeared! I can take a hint Cas.”
Jodi would take Donna, and anyone who didnt want to do a coupley trip, to Sanfransico to go to the beach. Rowena and Gabriel would be getting a fancy hotel in New York City, Meg and bal were going to walk through the Versailles gardens and see paris, Crowley decided to go back to Scotland for a bit, Kaia and Claire were going to Chicago for their first solo trip, and Sam and eileen had planned to go to London to a little book shop they’d heard about. Dean was happy that his family had taken it all in stride, he really didnt want to show it but he was smiling, maybe blushing a little so he hid his face in cas’ shirt.
“Flustered! I would never!” Dean exclaimed sarcastically. Cas  wouldn’t let him escape though so with one hand wrapped around deans wrist, cas pulled him back within reach and gave him a look so filled with love and lust that dean could almost melt. Instead he placed his hands on Cas’ shoulders and waited with one eyebrow raised. Cas leaned in and pressed a kiss onto the corner of dean’s mouth,
“Lore books mostly, thought you might have something.” Sam answered glancing at a book that claimed it was nice and accurate,
“I dont like forced relaxation,” jack said quietly before popping in his earbuds and playing the Spotify playlist claire had made for dean. Jodi handed him a sandwich and he munched on it happily, ignoring the odd looks from his group, “What? I like to eat.”
“Dont worry love, didn’t drug them, I’m experimenting with a new type of sugar, i did dark brown sugar and panela, it should have caramel and molasses notes.” Mila said sweetly. Dean took a cookie and glared sarcastically at cas who took a bite and analyzed the molecules, trying to put together some sense of actual taste. She grinned at dean and he took another,
Once I pulled up to the entrance of the hospital, I pulled Sammy out of the car and flung him over my shoulder. I ran in and the nurse seemed to get the idea and called the doctors. They pulled him up on what seemed to be a portable bed and took him away. My legs seemed to give up from underneath me and I collapsed. I could feel my head hit the table as I fell towards the left where the reception table was. My head collided with the hard wood and then with the checkered blue and white floor. I could hear a child yell and a nurse screamed but I’m not entirely sure why. Why did this keep happening to me? My vision blurred  and I fought to stay awake this time. My eyes flickering open and closed. I could feel a pair of sturdy hands grab onto me and lay me down on something soft and with a ramp.
“I guess so.” Dean chuckled, reminding himself that this was Castiel he was talking to not one of his friends. He moved his gaze from Castiel to Baby and realized that he should probably start walking to the car. He got up, fixing his flannel and looked down at the stairs, groaning at the realization that he had to go down them. Dean raced down the stairs and around his car, unlocking her and popping in, Castiel following suit.
I could hear her footsteps as she shuffled to the other side. Her dark hair flowed as she rushed to the other side. She seemed confident as she walked to the other side. I got a quick glance at her name tag and read the name Meg.
“Well, I guess that was fast and easy,” Gabe said, “I brought movies and food, let’s watch some television.”
“I don’t know. Do you think she did?” Cas lifted his eyebrow and pressed his lips together, straightening them out as he thought.
“Oh, well…” Cas scratched his neck in embarrassment, “I didn’t actually need anything. Although, we could use some advice.”
I made some food for Lisa and we ended up cuddling on the couch while watching some tv. There was a new episode to a good show that I like to watch with Cas - about two brothers that fight evil alongside their angel - on. I watched the new episode with Lisa and before it started I made sure to record it so that Cas and I could watch it later.
“I think…” I paused in thought before continuing, “I think that a lot of people seem to like beer, just not like my dad. Dad’s love for beer is different.”
I could never tell dad, I already know what he would say, “you’re not a man,” “a true man would never do that” and so much more. I fell over and burst into a fit of laughter. It’s good that I finally got rid of her. She was abusive anyways. I never told Sammy or Dad because it wouldn’t make me “manly” and I couldn’t bear that thought. I can’t let anyone in ever again.
“Do spill,” Charlie said, pulling up a reclining chair next to Dean’s bed - now occupied by Meg - and shoving some popcorn into her mouth.
His face flushed and he looked down, attempting to hide his face in his hands. He gave up and lifted the blanket up and over his head, hiding himself from me. I pouted, sad to see that his beautiful face was now covered with a blanket.
It was too late. Her lips smashed against mine as she pinned me up against the counter. Her body slowly closing in on the space between us and I could feel her tongue trying to break through. As much as I wanted to make my dad proud, this isn’t how I wanted to do that. Not yet anyways. I tried to reach up to push her back but her hands swiftly grabbed a hold of my arms and she held me down.
I want Cas to know how much he means to me and I have come to a realization that Lisa isn’t for me. Lisa never was for me, I think she was more like a stepping stone, a nudge, to the right path. She showed me that home isn’t where you’re pushed to be. Home isn’t where you’re expected to be. Home is where you make it be. We aren’t just given our home, we have to work for it, we have to earn it, and we have to want it. Cas is my home. Lisa was never my home, she’s what I always thought needed to be my home, she is what I was always expected to be my home, she’s what everyone expected.
John had taken him to his first hunt. They were scanning some forest by night and when his dad started yelling at him to stop whining, Dean made a couple of steps backwards. He was scared his dad would hit him. But then he tripped over a root and fell backwards into a dark tarn that proved to be deeper than it looked.
The angel looked puzzled, scanned Dean’s face, and he seemed to find something there that made him look away and bury his fingers into the fabric of his trench coat.
Like a drug, like something that pushes me, the readiness to combat and the pervasive caution had woken me up, as if I had never been sleeping. I couldn't help myself. And in the end, the true horror probably isn't being scared, but having no other choice anyway. And I don’t have it. I have to be ready at all time, I can never really rest. The drug pushes me and demands for more and for always and I can’t withstand it. But with an angel over me, maybe it was easier for me. My ally against the monster inside me. And so you’re right after all. I need you.
“What’s with feather-head?“ Rick asked amusedly and I shot him a look so briefly angry and so quickly turned to annoyed that he didn't know how to read it.
And I remember my smile. Of course you didn’t know, that I already knew every corner of your room inside out, every single object and every inch. Every impression, every thing and every moment in it has been taken in by me and saved, like you do it with information about monsters, as if it was my job to know all about you. As if you were my monster.
Your phone rang and our peaceful silence was disturbed. Your attention wasn't directed at half the book and half me any longer, but only at that thing and its call. For a moment you eyeballed the glowing display, until you seemed to have decided to answer the call. I found the for me senseless noise of the phone-distorted voice of a caller and I almost tried to hear with my eyes. After far too many minutes your look finally met me again and a smile spread in your face. But it wasn't directed at me and mine, but that, which the caller seemed to tell you. And I smiled back, because even when I didn't like to be in the unknown, I knew you would explain it to me. You hung up and there it was. The glow in your eyes and the anticipation inside you. Your small smile became a wide smirk and infected me like fire.
Cas wasn’t sure what to do. He felt like prey. And still he had a feeling Dean wasn’t lurking and threatening but simply confused. He had never been a lion, after all. He had never been any animal, unable to speak and new in his own body. Cas knew how that felt, yet he couldn’t offer any help.
Dean put a hand on the former angel’s arm and by the flinch that it caused his lower lip started trembling. “I’m sorry,“ he breathed. “I’m so sorry, Cas. I shouldn’t have— I was out of my mind.“
The only thing Dean felt was how well it worked. His hands clawed in and his legs pushed against and his entire body was a weapon forcing another down, fierce and unrestrained. He felt his pulse speed up like a sports car and his heart beat was so erratic it almost hurt. Adrenalin shot through him like gasoline and he needed to get it out of his system.
The machine sucked in money and nothing happened. A moment passed and he punched the vending machine so hard, it almost toppled over. Maybe if he hit it hard enough, its window would break, he thought. He wanted a damn coke.
And when it started beating again, an erratic and wild rhythm, his breaths came like hick-ups. He fell out of his stupor and bolted towards the stock-still figure of his brother, falling down on his knees beside him and clawing his fingers into the fabric of his brother’s plaid shirt.
“Why do we have to solve this crap anyway?“ Dean whined. “I mean, seriously, where does it get us, Sam?“
“Alright, would you quit it already,“ Bert complained, his right wrist in the tight grip of Sam’s ginormous hand. “You compared all the watches we got, okay?“ He pulled back his hand and put it back on the steering wheel. “And I’m driving here, by the way, in case you haven’t noticed.“
There was unfinished business between those two, he could tell. He didn’t want to know what it was, he didn’t even want to know about Cas’ black eye anymore that healed excruciatingly slow or why he’d decided to hide it with make-up. He didn’t want to know. For the first time since the two of them had started acting weird around each other he didn’t want to figure out what was going on. It didn’t bother him anymore. He had his own fucking things to think about. It could wait.
He took his drink from the nightstand and had himself a long sip. It burnt down in a wonderful flush of numbness. But reality had never been as easy to swallow, no matter how hard he’d tried during the past few hours. He would have loved to have that feeling of
“Hey,“ you answered and seemed to observe every of my movements. I sat down at the table and ate my peanut butter sandwich. It always was like this. Not a word between us. Only two people existing side by side quietly, coincidentally in the same room of the same bunker and at the same time. Like a secret meeting nobody should know about. I allowed you to look at me, actually it was more like staring, and I didn't say anything. Let you continue. Because it was good to be seen. And sometimes I wonder, whether you’re the only one, who really sees me.
Turned out she lived across the street, and Dean wondered if he had stumbled right into her hunting ground.
I heavily disagreed. “What for? To get myself some injuries? To see people die? Or rather to kill someone, because oh right, I’m meant for that?“
The flames around him flashed and rumbled like waves and he felt them licking at his skin and burning in his eyes. It was so hot that he could feel his hair get braised and the sweat on his forehead and temples sizzle. Then it hit him at once that he was inside a prison of fire and water with no way to escape and no chance to survive. He could dive down and try to reach the beach underwater, but it was so far away and he would need a stop to get air. Where in this sea of fire would he do that?
He put the bar in between the door and the wall holding it, giving his best to push it off its hinges. A
He wanted to make a step forwards, but his knees were shaking with that knowledge. And when he exhaled through his nose a few times, in order to calm down, he knew the fever had taken over. And though fever is something that takes control over you and not the other way around, it was still a fever he didn’t want to have.
Suddenly you stood up. I wanted to know, where you would go, but I forbid myself the question. I pretended to be absorbed in my food, as if I could enjoy its taste, while I wasn't even sure, if I even tasted anything at all. I had used to love eating, but somehow all the nightly peanut butter sandwiches I had to remember, and all the ones I was missing, had left a bitter taste on my tongue and killed my appetite. You left the room and I heard your steps echoing in the hallways. I wondered, where you were headed, wondered, what you planned again now, feared you would do something stupid again, but at least there was one thing I knew for sure: that you weren't following me. Because I was here and that without you.
Dean had forgotten what he was. Forgotten what he’d felt. Forgotten that he wasn't that good person he wanted to be. Forgotten that he had the choice. Dean had forgotten what a simple comment could do. And what reactions to that comment could imply.
I remember. One night I was lying in my bed, wide awake, because my head wouldn't stop thinking. Again and again thoughts swarmed through my conscious, memories, ideas, disappointment. And yet, all the good things seemed to win, the anger began to disappear, hope emerged. And I wondered, why am I like this? Why does it always end the same way? Why, when rage dies away and disappointment fades, can I forgive so easily? Why do you manage to sneak back into my life over and over again? It was the giant fail of my exploding will. And I wondered, if your story involved that, if it should contain my will failing again and again at withstanding to be yours. And perhaps it was time to let the old ways die, but perhaps also not.
She caught him staring and then she smiled and Dean had a feeling of being cornered. Her name was Alice, he learned when she came over to say hello. There was something about her scent that made him melt into a puddle, if that were possible. And the brown of her eyes was so chocolatey that he felt hungry. But not for food.
“You’re so stupid, Cas!“ Dean growled and grabbed him at his trench coat. “You’re so damn stupid. You can’t even look after yourself! And somehow — I don’t even know how — I’m the one who’s got to babysit you! Don’t you think I’d worry if you just wandered off like that? Don’t you even
I put on the old mask of disguise, hiding my feelings from you, in order to keep you from feeling them as well. I build up my wall around me, sheltering me from revealing myself, build it up high and strong and sturdy, but yet it just couldn't hold it all back and stay upright and without getting any holes and cracks. And you still stared at me, as if to stare right into me and beyond, being able to tell what’s true and what’s not. And then I couldn't bear it any longer and looked away, at my hands, at the table, at the ceiling, and just anywhere you weren’t.
The angel seemed to go in and out of reality more often now. He always appeared to be lost in thought or lost in general, and whenever Dean looked at him he wanted to shake him awake. Whatever kind of stupor or trance Cas was in, it was still better than having him say something stupid. Or say something that should stay between him and Dean. Or say anything at all. It was fine with Dean. Except for when it wasn’t.
Maybe it was hard to find in this noisy world and that busy life, especially when monsters and demons and angels and apocalypses obstructed the view. And yet, he found it. And yet, he saw it. And yet, he felt it. And he kept finding and seeing and feeling it, every single time when their eyes met. When the world moved half a second ahead of them and everything felt one step removed, when all was chaos and helpless and lonely and empty. When all was less, they found more. They found each other in a glance.
You just liked him. He was your friend. And you looked so happy in his presence. I had rarely seen you so relaxed and loosened, so casual and free of tension. Carefree, easy-going, cheerful even. Peaceful. Not like usually, tense and in the constant preparedness for attack and defense, not in constant fear. Because that you are. And you’re so used to being in danger and in pain and hurt and fear and disaster, that you don’t even really register it anymore. Perhaps that’s just what makes you seek for people you neither had to protect, nor save. With whom you can be truly carefree and full of peace. And that’s exactly what Rick is. Someone, who was capable of protecting himself, someone, who didn't need you. Not someone like me. Because didn't I need your protection any more, it only and alone counted that I needed it in your opinion.
So when the clock said it was late evening and the thermometer said it was still a little too hot in the bunker, they were all seated around the kitchen table. Their arms rested on dark wood and under yellowish light and their faces were full of smiles they showed too little and suppressed too often and allowed themselves too rarely.
With its wide walls and its high ceiling that hung above him like a canopy, with the lamps as stars, the room around him felt kind of empty. There was still water around him, a peaceful ocean, and the distant ripple of more water coming down and inside somewhere and the blustering noise of rain onto ground from outside mingled into a soothing melody.
Dean drew back and stared. Cas appeared new as well. He appeared like he’d finally found his voice back. Like he’d managed to cast away that silence and speak up. Like he didn't have to want something for the mere reason that Dean wanted it.
. And what was left of that powerful being now? He looked weary, to be fair, his features drawn and his trench coat now dry but still dirty. Cas folded his hands in his lap and he was swallowing over and over again, as if he was trying to get rid of a lump in his throat.
“I am sorry,“ I said, as if you didn’t know already, “I have made a mistake. Please don’t punish me for it forever“
I stared up at you, right into your eyes, which still didn't seem to really notice me. I discovered more color in your face than the days before, so I concluded that you must have slept at least for a few hours. I almost ached to ask you how you are, but I knew better than that, you hated that question. I don’t know if it’s, because you didn't want to answer it, or because you couldn’t. Or perhaps you just didn't feel like it was important.
Anansi drew back and stood back up, closing his eyes. “Ah,“ he gave with something like satisfaction. “I see. I saw a lot. A lot of good lines you’ve said and heard.“
The big realization over my colossal blindness towards the truth was overwhelming every fibre of my body. I hadn’t known, but I could have seen it, hadn’t I acted this overeagerly, without thinking twice about my steps. Caution is what I still need to learn.
“How can one love a monster, Castiel?“ Anansi continued. “How can an Angel of the Lord fall in love with a Monster of Hell? And then fall from Heaven for him? And then be corrupted by him? And then fall from grace and become human, only to experience the ugliest face of humanity?“
Sam fully turned to him, watching his profile closely. “Dean,“ he said. “You might not realize it, but I do know what Dad did to you, you know? I know how many times he hit you and blamed you for everything.“
And then there were hands at his arms and a body against his, wrapping around him like a second skin. And the flames rustled and the ocean gurgled and through that he heard something like a voice trying to grab his unworking ears and his attention.
Everyone was in t-shirts, gotten rid of a few layers of clothing as it was still hot in the bunker and the air conditioning didn’t seem to be working hard enough. Even Cas was only wearing his white shirt, a few of the top bottoms open and the sleeves rolled up. Dean couldn't help but peer over every once in a while, pretending to have a sip of his drink. And it was when he emptied his third glass of Scotch and pulled at the collar of his t-shirt a little to let some air between fabric and skin, that Sam exhaled loudly.
A little later, their food arrived. Sam had his usual healthy vegan plate of crap that Dean wouldn't even touch for money. Bert had classic pancakes with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice-cream. Both Dean and Cas had ordered eggs and bacon. And while Bert and Dean stuffed themselves with their breakfast like there was no tomorrow, Sam took his time to enjoy his own. Cas barely even touched his plate. It earned him a few concerned looks from Sam.
Cas nodded. He didn't say anything for a long while. Then he looked Sam right into his eyes and it appeared like a lock was opening. “I know what you mean. I know what it feels like to be powerful. And I remember what it feels like to have no powers at all. Yet…,“ he focussed back on his folded hands, sighed. “Yet, I’m afraid. Now that I lose my powers… again… I feel weak, Sam. Helpless… useless.“
“And I have bought Scotch for you,“ I said just as silently, with the bottle of brown liquor in my hand, as if it was the only answer there was. You smiled and I knew, you had understood.
That was what enraged Dean the most. Nothing to fear. He felt more intimidated than he wanted to admit.
He was wading through the water in almost slow-motion, careful to avoid the sinking cars and the floating tools and instruments around him. It all looked like a ship had gone down, all kinds of things swimming around and about to sink down to the bottom of this ocean.
Now, of course it isn’t always that easy. It isn’t always black or white, hero versus bad guy, the world is more complicated than that. Sometimes you just need someone to help you realize that you’re the villain of your own story. He’d realized that then.
A yelp went out of Dean as he tried to shake off whatever was pulling him down underwater. It vanished, but it returned only seconds later. Grabbed his legs and jerked him down under the surface reflecting the dull moonlight. Dean didn't remember that there even was a moon, or any light at all, save for the flash he thought he had seen. But then he realized he wasn't looking at air anymore but at pure, dark, air-killing sea water. It was drowning his every breath and memory.
You weren't just a good friend, your weren’t just family. You were someone who was always there for me, no matter what. Shelter and safety and help. You were all I never had, all I had always lacked. I needed you and your presence in the truest sense of the word, not only to stay alive, but to be alive and feel so. You made me stop remembering what happened and what sucked and was messed up and all the pain and suffering, and start looking forward and embracing life as it is, even when it was a giant pile of crap.
“I’m sorry, my love. Forgive me.“ He cupped her face with his big hands and long fingers and leaned in to kiss her. She melted under his touch. “Who we are and who we need to be to survive are two very different things.“
“Because it’s Cas, Dean,“ your brother said, as if it was the only reason ever needed, “Cas and you, you’re… you’re so close. You can’t just lock him out like that. You need him, you know that“
Dean dragged him into their room and the door slammed shut. He hurled Cas to the floor. Cas felt the dusty carpet under his fingers when he curled them into his palms and he didn't dare to get up. He felt Dean’s fingers claw into his hair as he pulled his head upwards and a gasp went out of him. Breathing seemed difficult that way, but he gave his best not to fail. And when Dean pushed his face back into the dirty carpet, he gave his best to keep still. He sensed the dark look on him piercing through his every cell.
So he rose and walked out of the room. He didn't know where exactly his brother was, he only knew that he’d left the bunker. His car was gone and also Dean had practically made a loud and noisy show of his leaving. Slammed doors, shouted curses, squeaking tires. No telling if Dean was mad at him or mad at himself.
When I found you, in the middle of the night and in the middle of the kitchen, I wasn't sure, if you were better or worse. At least you weren't cowering in a corner on the floor with an originated by anger pool of alcohol and broken glass next to you, but with only the familiar bottle in your hand. You were sitting on the table, not at it, staring at your hands and seeming to find something in them that bothered you. It really was a strange view I was getting, but I guess in strange times such is within the scope of normality. I slowly entered the room and eventually sat down on the chair in front of you. You were enthroned above me like a lonely king in a kingdom of sadness, your body throwing a shadow upon me I probably deserved.
And again I felt observed. I knew you weren’t here, but it was like I would feel your eyes anyway. But it wasn’t good, like it was a couple of days ago, it just distracted me. Again and again there were thoughts pushing into my head I had no time for. Thoughts about you. I couldn’t let go of it. Your eyes, your look, the never-ending excitement you seemed to have for me. Why for me? You’re forever, I’m just for now. We’re all going to die, someday. Just not you. At least I imagined it that way. You’re created for eternity, and are hard to kill. I remember trying it, back when we had first met, when I didn’t know what you are and what you’re planning. And somehow I still don’t know. Then again, all of this, all the mortality around me had an undeniable appeal to it. Perfect is what ends someday. Stop when it’s at its best. But I almost envy you for your seeming immortality. You’re infinite, and I will end someday, while you will still be wandering around and need no one, perfect inside yourself, complete without my incompleteness.
My heart was burning. Sam and you. Never would I be as important as Sam. Never would I mean as much to you. Never would I mean more to you. Sam is your brother and he is everything in this world that is good for you. I just wished, you would see, that I am everything in this world you need. I am the one you should have taken with you to that job. I am the one, who should have fought on your side. I am the one you should have needed. But I started realizing, that we weren’t there yet. One day you would realize it. One day you would see it. And I nodded and left the room without a word. Because the mortification would have deformed my voice and painted the words I would have said in a dark color. And so I went away soundlessly, because even when you can’t say good sentences every now and then, I want nothing else than to say good things to you.
“So, what d’you think?“ Sam asked, wandering down the path from Carole Newman’s house, the thirteenth on the list of missing people.
The angel kept quiet through the entire interview, only stood next to him and listened, letting Dean do the talking. Like a pet dog staying by the side of its master and waiting for orders and instructions.
He saw things he couldn't fathom, he saw it all, and still nothing at all. He knew that sky. He loved it, through a thousand lifetimes, across millions of stars. He reached out to it, tried to touch it like he’d wanted to touch that too-beautiful tree in that not-garden and not-building either. He wanted to have it, wanted to find it with his outstretched fingers and hold it. Never let it go and never leave it.
The trickster put it down on the coffee table and sat down next to Cas in a chair that he swore hadn't been there before. With a waving gesture some sort of breakfast appeared on the empty tray. Cas couldn't tell what it all was, the only thing he thought to recognize was the pastry he’d seen Anansi eat the day before. There were other dishes, though. Ones with little balls wrapped in what seemed to be cooked leaves, ones with glossy pastries shaped like triangles, and ones with slices of different kinds of fruit. It also held a steaming cup and a glass of water, and then another glass with a milky white liquid in it that surely wasn't milk.
And though it’d been painful and definitely unpleasant to have his friend give him a piece of his mind in such a violent kind of way, it was a language Dean spoke. Fighting was something that worked for Dean. Because that is how you defeat the enemy.
Dean smiled his affectionate smile and Cas felt like he had yet another Dean in front of him. A Dean he could talk to, a Dean he could stand up to. A Dean that somehow, inexplicably, had lost the memory of this. Was that a good thing or a bad thing?
He needed to feel the adrenalin high. The one that came from chasing this week’s monster and from the military-worth strategizing before and the killing after. Never had he wished more for the iron stink of blood than in that moment. He even caught himself fantasizing about licking it off his fingers to taste it. The glorious delicacy of being the hunter and not the hunted.
He slurred the words and he seemed to have a hard time standing there without swaying. Yet, he managed to pierce his finger into the soaked and transparent fabric of Cas’ shirt. He wondered why he even always had to defend himself. You drink a little too much and try a little too hard and then you come to realize that no one ever takes you serious. And then you try to be threatening and dangerous only to make
“I am. I really am, Dean.“ Cas assured. His eyes bore into the hunter like he was trying to hold him in the conversation, keep him talking, now that he’d managed to get a reaction. “Please understand. I would have… I tried to heal myself. I didn't want it to be seen. But what is left of my grace… it’s not enough to heal myself entirely.“
“All naive and giggly-wiggly. Life must be so much easier when you have others do all the work for you and not even getting the whole picture of it all.“
Dean took another spoon of his chili and while chewing it and looking at everyone’s faces he thought he wanted to stay in this moment forever. He thought he hadn't felt so calm in years. He thought he might get over himself. The moment eased so far and absolute that he felt like he would never be able to break anything ever again. Maybe somewhere hidden under his skin there was a normal after all.
So this is what they knew. 1. They had people disappearing in Hazardville, because they 2. got told a secret, because 3. this is how J.D. Salinger says. 4. They had people going crazy in New Canaan, which was 5. another quote coming to life, 6. this time one by Hemingway. 7. They had a sea of fire killing people in Old Saybrook, which wasn’t a) a quote, but b) an analogy, though c) it still fit into all the weird. And 8. they had met a man, who was firstly, a little obviously arrogant, secondly, more obviously powerful, and thirdly, very obviously some sort of supernatural being. Because a) he had the habit to vanish into thin air whenever the fuck he wanted, and b) knew their names somehow, and who they were, and most importantly he c) had turned Dean into a lion and back. 9. They were fucked. 10. They were still kind of clueless.
Four. And then we can love every aspect of one another, every good trait, every flaw, every look and every single freckle on each other’s faces, be passionate about every shared moment together, even the most banal ones, be attracted to each other both sexually and emotionally, be a friend, a lover, a psychologist, a protector, a guardian and a viewer and observer of every single thing they do, just because all they do is so special and precious to you that you want nothing more than to keep them near you as close as you can and never let go. Your whole life becomes them and it’s so worth losing your head over it. That’s love, that’s true unsuperficial, more than friendly, not just broken, devouring it all love, and that’s exactly what I had with you.
His vision blurred a little, but he wasn't sure if it were tears or the headache. He needed painkillers. Even if he couldn't kill himself, he at least wanted to kill that pain. All the pain. He rubbed his eyes and started rummaging in his duffel.
“I know,“ I answered, when our eyes met and all the magic in them seemed to recharge. It’s weird, how we always manage to share something so nice in the darkest hours and the biggest disasters and worst situations. No matter how bad we were, we could still build each other up like no one else could. As if we were a code nobody was able to crack, but us, an indecipherable cipher. And in our infinite cryptology that nobody understood we worked, in the teeth of all resistances. We were just better together.
Maybe out of hope, or maybe out of habit, the Winchesters both looked at Castiel then, who stood there a few steps below them on the stairway to the main entrance. He looked confused for a second, then looked away with something like shame scurrying over his stony face.
This room wouldn't change anything about that. The gun under his pillow wouldn't change anything about that. And the bottle of Whiskey in his hand and the half of it already floating in his system wouldn't change anything either. He could drink away the days, but he couldn't drink away himself.
“Okay, I give you that,“ the King of Hell said, pursing his lips. “But I don’t have to stand here listening to your stupid accusations. You think I would have come, if it were me doing that?“
Dean made another step towards him and grabbed him by the jacket of his suit. “You get out of my head, you dick!“ he snarled. “And while you’re at it, you get out of our lives, too!“
The other’s eyes were searching now, frantic almost, and Dean wondered what there was to find in him. And with all the urgency in the former angel’s eyes, he still took his time to answer him.
“So,“ he said, somewhat hoarse and staring at his hands. He felt Cas look over at him. No, he’d been watching him all along.
Dean fell into his chest, grumbling something unintelligible. And it was when Sam wrapped his arms around him and ran his hands up and down his back that he realized Dean was crying.
That dizziness and cruel nausea growing inside him even made it hard to cough. He felt like he was breathing for nothing. Breathing new, breathing for the first time, and yet to no avail.
If you can’t fix it, you must stand it. So he would stand it. He would stand that no one was looking for him. He would stand that no one wanted to talk to him. He would stand that he was on his own finishing this case. He would pull himself together and find that teacher he’d heard about who might be able to help him.
Not even two hours later we reached Rick’s house, in the middle of a forest, in the middle of nowhere. I got out of the car and felt the soft, wet forest ground underneath my steps. The air surrounding us was clear and wet. In front of us an old wooden house, little inviting, much hunter-like. I heard steps on the rotten wood of the narrow veranda and found a man standing there. He was well built, dark hair, a slight beard, plaid shirt under a sleeveless vest, ragged jeans and heavy boots. He looked like the stereotype all-states-inhabitant hunter in his natural habitat, and did he wear a serious expression at first, it became a mild smile, as he saw you. And I understood him.
“Cas, I…,“ I began, as my hand moved across my face, as if to hope I could put my mask back on, “… I don’t wanna talk about it now“
He couldn’t make sense of why Dean was acting this way around him. For years and years, he’d been joking and laughing and smirking his way. He’d talked to him about his problems during the day and about his thoughts during the night. He’d told him everything. And then, at some point, Dean had started acting weird and tense. With one feral explosion their world started shattering. It hadn’t been their first fight, but it had been the first one to make a change.
“Ah, you see, I believe that’s the job of you Winchesters.“ He moved his hands across his suit jacket and looked down on himself. “But let’s quit joking around, Dean Winchester. I will win this little game between us. Don’t be so stupid to believe you stand a chance.“
“Hey,“ Sam said when he entered the kitchen, distracting Dean from the bee. Sam had gotten up early to drive Lilly Smith to the airport so she could go home.
Then the train stopped. They had arrived and Castiel was only a little hesitant to leave his seat. Outside, he stepped onto a concrete floor. The train station’s building was a small cube with a flat roof and green-framed windows and a dark door. It reminded him of something he’d seen before, though he couldn't tell what it was.
“I am dealing with it,“ you cut me off and even when your voice sounded calm and steady, I could hear the anger inside it like the loud buzz of an illuminated advertising board at night. Don’t speak, when you should actually be yelling.
You knitted your brows as if not to understand the words I had said. I dearly needed you to get me, to comprehend what I was on about. I acted confident, but inside me I was so nervous and unsure of myself, that I didn't even know what to say first. I just wanted it to be done, I wanted to sort things out, I needed to know where we were.
“You injured?“ you asked with all worry in your voice, I couldn’t even be happy about it, because over sounded was all by the panic of being caught and this dark stain inside me, that was scared I would reveal anything, and so perfectly matched the stain of blood, that would reveal everything. Your fingers fumbled over my chest, as you stood up to inspect me.
His feet led him to the cluster of pine trees, for no reason at all, but he felt like this was the place to go from here. As he walked deeper and deeper into the mist, it started growing higher and thicker even. It covered each and any of it all, even him, and soon he could see nothing but grey and white and something like a light somewhere in the distance.
In some unremembered time before Cas there used to be things Dean kept hold onto. Things that made him never forget who he was. Some rings he’d gathered along the road and a gun with a white handle and a necklace he’d gotten from Sam. And a leather jacket so old and worn-out, you could barely tell what it used to look like when it was new. A leather jacket that smelled of gasoline and gunpowder and dried blood. A leather jacket that was more than just a piece of clothing. It meant warm and it meant right and it meant knowing who he was in such a heavy way that it could throw him down and lift him up at the same time. It was the armor he’d always known.
A headache was pounding against his skull. The sparse light of the cheap-because-ugly motel room still hurt. It could be a migraine. It could be his mind not being able to process all the damage he’d done to his life. Dean felt sorry for himself.
“You shut up, you asshole!“ came out of Bert as he stood up for the first time since he’d entered the room. “Sorry, but you’re being rude and unreasonably mean. I am who I am, and you, sir, need to deal with that. You don’t even know me, or how I—“
Dean walked over to him and sat down. Now that he was closer he could see the patient, dressed in pajamas and a grey bathrobe, looked all drugged up. His eyes reddened and glassy and lids on half-mast and his lips parted and dry. He was leaning back in his chair sluggishly and relaxed and hardly seemed to care about manners. If you made the effort to actually regard him, you could see everything through the hole in his pajama pants between his legs that stood wide apart. As though he
“I’m thinking demonic omens, but I don’t think that’s what you nerds are on about, right?“ Dean gave, a little sheepishly.
And that was it. It took away the pain. Castiel had flames and burns and scars and chaos within, but he wasn't sure anymore if he could see the monster. Dean looked at him like he did, he touched him like he did, and Cas fell right back into him. It was all so foul.
He wiped a hand across his sweaty face and thought back to that weird moment he’d had with Cas down in the basement. There were no actual reasons why he’d done what he’d done and it bothered him that he couldn't manage to figure it out.
“Well, at least you were all cozy and warm in here, right? Glad one of us made it through the night without finding a rotten rat corpse in their blanket. Now enough with the mothering crap, I’m fine.“
A moment passed and then another and another. And they kept staring at each other and then Dean said, “Don’t.“ And he looked away and said, “Don’t do this. We can’t do this.“
He shook his thoughts away and swore to himself he’d pay closer attention from now on. There must be something he’d missed, or maybe dismissed. Maybe he’d seen it but been too distracted by recalling his dreams that kept echoing in his mind. As though someone was shouting at him to remember all that he wasn’t.
Cas had his eyes closed when we breathed into his stomach to keep still. His hands still covered his face, his forehead pressed against the rough carpet. Then he felt the pain. The harsh bolt of burning pain igniting in his back like a fervid iron bar. The rifle wasn't shot. It was hurled down onto his back. Over and over again Dean hit him with its hard cold frame and Cas was about to break apart.
He reached into his jacket and pulled out the familiar yellowed piece of paper he always carried ever since he was a boy. He unfolded it with shaking hands and looked at the words that didn't make so much sense anymore. He’d always felt a security with it. It had always brought something home to him. A bandaid he used to like in the cold.
it’s about you again,“ Bert commented, throwing up his arms. He shot the older Winchester a smirk, then chuckled. “Good ol’ self-important narcissist, centering all the attention.“
It was late at night and Dean was practicing the fine art of drinking it all away. He was tired. Tired the way people are tired by the long lasting darkness during winter. He needed rest, a warm bed and warmer sheets to wrap around himself and to protect himself from what he’d become. But he couldn’t, because sleep requires peace and he didn't have any of that and he was still no taller than that moment.
The sun should rise in a few, Dean thought as he sat up and rubbed his eyes. He got out of his baby, the dusty dirt of the side of the road scrunching against his heavy boots. He stretched his arms over his head, yawning blearily.
Cas looked up at him with his dead eyes and damaged features and there was something so real about it that Dean didn't remember anymore if it actually was or not.
“Where are you going?“ I asked and tried not to let too much of my fear of loss resound in my voice.
“Don’t be stupid, there was fi— there was fire out there! And there was someone else, I—I wanted to save him, but when I was there, there was no one there and then— you saw the fire! Right?“
A warm hand settled on his arm, as she stopped next to him, eying the arachnid in his palm with interest. Her black braids hung elegantly across her back and front and over her shoulders, golden pearls and bands braided into them, and the top pulled back into a neat knot on the back of her head. Her floor-length onyx-colored silk dress flitted backwards by the breeze, her golden bracelets and rings reflecting the sunlight. She was the most beautiful woman Anansi had ever seen.
You did a step towards me and you looked worried. I almost felt bad about lying to you, but then again it wasn't really a lie, because I actually felt sick. And I imagined you coming to me and putting your hand on my face and you finger moving over my rough skin, you looking into my eyes and feeling what I feel, and knowing what I know. That we belong together and need to protect our thing and that there’s nothing that could change anything about that. That we’ve gone this entire painful, disastrous way together and are now here, where we were, and it needs no threat, no blackmail and no decisions anymore to share the same world through the same eyes. And then instead, back in reality, you put your hand on not-my-face-my-shoulder and looked into my eyes, without seeing and feeling what I saw and felt, with a smile that couldn't have been any more friendship-y. And again I lost my head.
Finally the truth was in the air, suddenly spluttered, and it was as if I had just now remembered again that it was the only thing that kept me alive in my labyrinth of lies. Because who was I to ask for honesty, when I don't perform it myself. In math minus and plus may always equal minus, but suddenly it was, as if I could fight all the minus around me with only my plus. And in that moment it even seemed like the plus could win. The truth is, I had no idea where all of this would lead, I was in a big pile of unknowing, but maybe I had found back my courage and maybe that Maybe would someday become a Definitely.
Bert nodded. Sure, another strike of dick-induced nature bending. He’d been working with the Winchesters for several weeks now, and he’d never been part of something this huge his entire life. It should make him proud, excited maybe, encouraged even. But all it did was making him feel useless.
“I think I actually found something,“ Sam said, almost whispering to himself. Everyone’s attention was fully on him, as his eyes flew over the pages again and he cleared his throat.
“Oh, thank you, Mrs. Hamilton, that wasn’t necessary.“ Dean said politely and took the two cups from her, shoving one of them into Castiel’s reluctant hands. Some of the coffee spilled and stained Cas’ white shirt and he looked down at the brown hot taint and seemed to choose to ignore it.
“We’ve missed something,“ Bert said and with that cut into the rustling of pages and the typing of a keyboard.
When Dean finished his food, he seemed to notice the lack of interest in Cas and all the interest in his brother’s eyes. There it was, the Sam Winchester investigation of other people’s behavior. Dean could feel the chick-flick moment coming.
My phone rang and startled me out of wherever I had been. My attention was on the phone and the call coming in. For a moment I only stared at it, unsure whether to take or ignore it, but then I decided to answer. The voice on the phone was Rick’s, a hunter friend of mine. I’ve known him for several years, every once in a while we worked together on a case and somewhere along the way, despite his headstrong and lone-wolfish nature, he had become a dear friend. He was just telling me about a job involving fangs, as I turned my eyes back at you and couldn't help a smile spreading in my face. Admittedly it wasn't really directed at you and your own one, but at what Rick was saying. I hung up and there it was. The tickle inside me, rising from deep down quietly but heard and making me nervous with excitement. Like a bushfire burning it all down and destroying everything I ever thought of, so that I could only think of vampires now.
“He doesn’t,“ the younger Winchester repeated. “He’s not after all of us. He’s only after you, Dean.“
Cas looked away from him, his lips pressed together and that frown spreading on his face again. It seemed like it hurt him to even think about that.
“Because it’s Cas, Dean,“ Sam said, as if it was the only reason ever needed, when really, it felt like just another excuse, “Cas and you, you’re… you’re so close. You can’t just lock him out like that. You need him, you know that“
. I guess.“ Anansi said and sighed. “Peter Pan.“ He rose and waved a hand, making the tray of pastries on the coffee table disappear. Three pineapples took its place. “I’ll be there, Castiel. I’ll be there when you finally realize that you were never asking for too much. That you were just asking the wrong person.“
I went on and took John’s diary. Felt its brown leather cover and the weight of the pages, which hold so much history inside them. And just when I wanted to open it, like I do it every now and then to remember all the things I know about you and your family, I sensed your breathing changing and your body moving. I winced, put back the book hastily and disguised my presence with invisibility. I would scare you to death, would you open your eyes and find me in the middle of your room. You sat up and looked around. I found insecurity in your eyes, even when it was too dark to really interpret it. I sensed you had the feeling someone was here, the fear that flared up inside you for a little moment. But you shook it off and dared to have a look at the clock. One minute after six.
You can see something a million times over and not recognize it; and then suddenly you see it for the very first time.
,“ Dean growled. “We’re turning tables now, aren’t we? Nice one, Cas, really.“ He nodded towards the ground and there was a dangerous smile playing on his lips and a glow in his eyes. Then his raw fist crashed into Castiel’s face and he felt something snap in his cheekbone.
He’d been so frustrated. So provoked by his own failure. It didn't even matter what Castiel did or didn't do, Dean had always felt threatened by it. Or rejected. And even when he didn't think much about himself, even when he’d never felt important to this world, even when he was never important to himself, being the victim never fit into his self-perception.
