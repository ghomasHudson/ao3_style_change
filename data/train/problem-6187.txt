Tony was quiet for a moment, letting the information wash over him.
. Coconut and a hint of something else, something decidedly Pepper.
Tony had hired Pepper as his Personal Assistant years ago. It had taken a long time to fill the position. He had been looking for someone capable, who was unafraid to call him out when necessary. Most of the qualified candidates he had interviewed were too eager. They were too eager to please and too eager to pacify. He wanted to work with someone who would challenge him. Someone who wouldn’t let him get talked into doing something he would come to regret.
Steve couldn’t help but smile. He was happy to see Tony and happier still that Tony was glad to see him. He hadn’t realized how unsure he had been. This thing between them was nascent, and Steve hadn’t wanted to presume too much. He hadn’t wanted to think Tony would miss him as much as he had. Though now, of course, he knew that to be true.
“Steve,” he said. “Steve. Holy shit, you’re alive.”
“No! I’d prefer it if you didn’t. I don’t want… Don’t let anyone see you come into the building, Steve.”
. Why the hell couldn’t you say anything before? Why’d I have to read it in a letter? Hope the shield gives him purpose.
I didn't know what I had expected. It was a Roman name, of course, but not one I had ever heard. And when he said it, he said it as if it were something he hadn’t practiced, as if that name no longer belonged to him. It no longer identified him.
Nevertheless, the Fates had already decided and by now, it was much too late. I was already in love.
Steve turned to face her. He couldn’t read her expression. She got off the table and walked around the desk. She opened the bottom drawer and pulled a letter from within.
Steve pulled away, forcing Tony to meet his eyes.
“And you do that admirably and well,” I said. “Now, come sit with me. I have something I’d like to share.”
Bucky started coughing uncontrollably after dinner. Gail quickly went to his side, knowing exactly what to do. Steve offered them privacy. He cleared the table and took the dishes into the kitchen. Steve always helped his mother in the kitchen. He’d be able to listen to the radio peacefully while his mother assigned him various tasks.
“The evacuation, all those people,” said Steve.
He chuckled knowingly and said, "That I knew."
He fried the finely chopped bacon in its own fat. While that cooked, he whisked the eggs, Pecorino cheese, and black pepper in a small bowl. Once the bucatini was cooked and drained, he poured the it over the pasta, and stirred. It smelled wonderful. He served the pasta and added a bit of parsley as garnish. His mother would be proud.
Steve was thankful.
In the future, he had tried. He had tried to do what he thought would suit him best. He had tried to date women. He had tried it before Janet, but had failed, and then with Janet, everything crumbled.
“Yeah, it’s hard to believe,” he said.
He had been running his father’s company since he was twenty-one. His parents had died in a car crash. Tony would never forget the day, never forget hearing the news. He was in Massachusetts, still in Cambridge, when he had received the call. He fell to the floor, agony washed over him. The last time he had seen his parents, he had argued with his father. It was one of many, many arguments they had had repeatedly.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” he said. He reached for the phone and answered the call.
Soon, he would think back on this time. The memories of this night and the ones to come would sustain him. He would remember his home and his friends. He would remember their parting words, and their words of encouragement.
This would explain Tarleton’s head, but this, this only raised more questions. Whose… Whose blood were they using for this? Most likely an Inhuman. Some poor, unfortunate soul. But were they still here?
He had read a few of the articles she had published before hiring her. She had flown in early and opted for a late night rather than an early morning. Tony didn’t mind. He didn’t sleep much anyway. He had always been a night owl, but now, he just didn’t sleep. Often staying up well into the night before crashing on the couch, or worse yet, the cot in his workshop.
Steve couldn’t imagine not wanting to hear what Tony had to say. He was always thinking aloud, sharing plans with Steve. He had plans for all sorts of wondrous things Steve wouldn’t have thought imaginable when he was younger, let alone possible, but Tony found a way. And that was the beauty of being around Tony, he had quickly learned.
“Steve,
“One.”
I could taste the salt of the sea in him. It was better than even the best wine or the best cheese. If I could’ve been a parasite, I would’ve lived off him, leaching off his warmth, for as long as he would let me.
He asked his voice just above a whisper.
I wish I could erase it all, all these memories I have of you. I would do it, one by one. If you mean nothing, your ghost will stop haunting me. That’s how this works, right?
Tony looked down, at his slippers. They were bright red and complimented his robe. Steve had been thinking of untying it since he entered the room. He could do that sort of thing now, beyond not minding, Tony actively encouraged him.
I can't say how long we sat in each other's company reminiscing about the past. I can't say what possessed me to tell him to stay. The slaves' quarters were on the opposite side of the house, but I wanted him near me. Now that I knew how it felt to have him close, I couldn't bear to let him go.
He let her go, surprisingly. Customarily, a woman didn’t return to her family, not even in times of grief. She belonged to her husband, my father.
Steve was hoping there wouldn’t be an emergency, that no one would need the Ultimates. Sometimes, he welcomed the distraction they provided, but not tonight. Tonight, he wanted to sleep and not dream, not wake up in a cold sweat, haunted by what he had seen.
He eyed another bottle of vodka on the shelf.
I learned about the Trojan and Punic wars, about Caesar, about my namesake. I read of the bloodied battlefields on which they achieved fame and glory. I couldn't help but think of the gladiators in the arena. Fighting for glory.
ask. I always do, and you always ignore me.
“I gotcha buddy,” he said.
"And why is that," I asked.
He had accepted he and his father would never agree on matters. But he had also argued with his mother, and he never argued with his mother. Often, they saw eye-to-eye. Howard hated how much Tony reminded him of himself until he spoke, and when he spoke, he sounded like Maria.
Terrified and distraught, Tony was left to pick up the pieces. No one understood. He was conflicted.
He treasured people and places. He treasured the moments he spent with his loved ones. He treasured the memories of his mother, the good times with friends, the touch of long-lost lovers, and the camaraderie of his teammates. Those were the things that mattered most.
Perhaps that's why – and I tell myself this to soothe the pain – he never seemed to love me. He had loved her, and she was gone, taken much too soon. Perhaps he thought it wasn't worth to love again if there would only be pain in the horizon.
She had been wonderful, and the first few months had been the best time of his life. But she had changed into someone unrecognizable. That woman didn’t love him, she didn’t care about. She only cared about what he could do for her. He didn’t miss her. She was manipulative, controlling, and an opportunist.
“Perfect landing,” he said, to himself, now that he could speak.
Steve entered from the parking garage, he entered the code for the penthouse, and the elevator took him straight there. The doors opened and revealed… A mess.
“Oh God, much better. Much, much better,” he said.
“Tony!”
He missed… He missed being needed. He missed being useful. He missed being on a team. He missed the Avengers.
“See? Jokes already. Corny ones, at that.”
He had only taken a few sips before slipping away. He made his way to the balcony quietly, hoping no one would note his absence. The music was still on and he could hear the murmurs of conversations. He didn’t need to be there. He didn’t need to be among them, at least, not right now.
She had ingratiated herself. She had sought power and he was the perfect conduit. Once she had what she wanted, she had no need for him anymore.
Later, I had to watch him cry out and bleed and beg. I was seething, and I was numb. I was so many things, but most of all, I was a coward. I averted my gaze. I couldn’t watch as they tortured him for the crime of loving me.
“Never rains, but it pours,” he said. Then, he sighed. “Well, can’t wait any longer.”
He was dozing off when the phone started vibrating.
“Don’t tell me,” said Tony.
He had never been this reclusive. He focused all his energy on his company and spent very little time with the Ultimates. The others didn’t know, and Steve wasn’t comfortable discussing someone else’s medical history, not even Tony’s, so he stayed quiet. Tony had entrusted him with something grave, something he hadn’t wanted publicly disclosed. Steve wasn’t going to betray him.
She caught him off guard just before leaving the office. “If it’s serious, will you tell me?”
“No, you don’t! Tell me, Steve, did you know Tony was dying?”
After tomorrow, he would never return. This office would be gutted. The walls stripped bare, then primed and painted for their new owner. He looked at the glass door that read
“Don’t… Don’t say sorry. Sorry isn’t going to bring him back, sorry isn’t going to cure an incurable brain tumor. Just… just get down here and read over these documents.
He and Pepper had discussed the changes she would make. The inscription on the glass door already bore her name. The serif typeface matched the name plate on the desk — her desk, he mentally corrected. He hadn’t been here in weeks, not since they had toasted to her promotion. She was shy and hesitant, but Tony assured her, she was the most qualified person for the job. The board wanted someone with her background, and they wanted someone who knew the company in-and-out, not wishing to spend time having to train a replacement, since Tony would be leaving too soon.
Steve listened quietly and didn’t stop him from drinking.
After that, he didn’t waste any time.
“No, it couldn’t have been that long,” said Tony, incredulously.
He returned to his studies the next term. He wasn’t old enough to take over his father’s company, and the board of directors didn’t trust him enough, but he was hoping by the summer, to have shown his worth.
Steve fought off the last of the robots. They made it inside the escape pod only seconds before the ship exploded. They were both breathing heavy. They had managed to escape a fiery death, but they were far from clear. The explosion had taken with it their engines. They were sitting ducks.
He sat up as he spoke. He moved so gracefully, I almost didn’t realize what he was doing until I felt his nose touch mine, ever so lightly. Softly, he brushed the sand from my cheeks. I shuddered at his touch and met his piercing gaze.
“He wouldn’t want me near the kid now,” Bucky replied sadly.
“He’s fine, I’ll be careful,” Tony smiled down at the boy. Steve looked over Tony’s shoulders.
“You’re not,” Steve responded with a kiss to the top of Tony’s hair. Tony shrugged. Steve held him tighter and turned his attention back to Bucky who was just finishing up the story. Indy clapped when Bucky said ‘The End.’
“Goodnight, Indy.”
“Tony,” Steve replied sternly. “We’re not done discussing this.”
“Thanks for having me.”
“We’re going to get normal things, Tony. Nothing extravagant,” Steve told his boyfriend, hands on his hips.
"You're killing me Barnes," he said, rolling his eyes. "I already told him why, you were here."
“About as well as you’d expect,” Steve replied. “And then it got a little worse.”
“I don’t know, darling. But I’m not going anywhere. I’m here with you and Indy, okay? Forever, like we promised.” He pushed Steve back so he could look in his eyes. Steves face was wet with tears and Tony used his sleeve to wipe his cheeks. “We’ll figure it out,” Tony told him as he nodded to reassure his boyfriend.
“She’s been an angel really. She napped, she ate, we played with some toys. Not a problem at all,” he said honestly.
“It’s nothing, Ca-,” he corrected himself and finished, “Steve.”
“Littler than me,” Steve pointed out. He dropped Peter back down to his feet but pulled him against his side with an arm around his shoulders. “I’m glad you came by today too.”
“That wasn’t your toy, buddy. You can’t have that one, but if you want a doll you can ask your Papa or Daddy later.” He picked Indy up and bounced him a little.
“Yup. Birthday stuff for everyone coming to your party,” Steve smiled. Indy clapped.
“Sure. Sounds good.”
Indy’s face scrunched up instantly at those words and a sob worked its way out. “Da,” he cried pitifully.
“Did anyone tell you what happened to me?” Tony focused on opening the package.
Steve saw Tony come out of the bedroom and walked towards him. “How’d it go?”
True to his word, Happy was parked right there when the elevator opened in the garage. “Sir, Cap,” he greeted.
“Want you,” Indy replied.
“This for me,” Indy insisted, a tight grip on the shirt.
“With Indy,” Steve admitted, “Because he saved his life, Tony,” he said louder when Tony laughed humorlessly. “He would never hurt him.”
“Guess I’m too late for this party, huh?” Steve asked as he walked in, smiling at the sight. Tony hummed.
"Okay you don't have to make some big gesture like this to prove you're gonna be nice to me, just read them," Tony laughed.
“Thank you,” Steve told him sincerely before he could run off. Tony nodded and kissed him briefly.
“He okay?” Steve asked.
“Bye, spiderbaby,” Tony added before disconnecting.
"Oh god please no, don't apologize for that," Bucky said quickly. "I deserved every bit of that but you didn't." Tony was shocked into silence. "You really didn't," Bucky whispered, repeating the sentiment.
“Okay,” Bucky agreed softly. Steve nodded.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he said, voice cracking. Bucky nodded at the folder and Tony picked it up  nervously. He read it quietly for a couple minutes.
“Night, Tony,” Steve replied softly, exhaustion starting to hit him.
“Sounds good. Yell if you need me.” Tony stood and kissed Indy’s head, narrowly missing a gob of oatmeal. “Be good for Papa.”  He took the dishes to the kitchen to clean and put things away.
“You did hurt Daddy, that’s one thing. Definitely the biggest thing. You also didn’t listen and were misbehaving. But why did you hurt Daddy? Did you want to hurt him?” Steve asked, cringing at the question because he shouldn’t have to ask his toddler that, but he honestly needed the answer. He grew up with Hydra so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Indy thought his reaction was acceptable.
“Safe?” he whimpered. “No.”
“I didn’t think I had any right to raise Indy either. I know our lives were different, but still. It seemed risky, and I had no experience with kids. I told Tony Captain America wasn’t a dad.
“Because you’re lucky!” Steve shouted. “You can’t just take these risks anymore, Tony, you have a son. He deserves a dad who cares about whether they’re going to die or not.”
The meal passed in silence aside from the occasional clink of metal from Tony who continued to work. In a sudden move he dropped his tools on the counter and whirled around on the stool. "Did you bring your overnight bags? Pajamas and toothbrushes and all that?"
Tony tried to soothe his son as best he could while not being able to offer him anything.  At one point he scared Tony by gasping for breath as if he were choking because he was borderline hyperventilating so Tony did the only thing he could do. He held him tight with his one free arm and started talking loudly to be heard over the cries about anything and everything that popped into his head. He kept up the running commentary until the little boy passed out from exhaustion and Tony could finally stop, head dropping forward as tears started flowing. He kept his head down not wanting to give his captors the satisfaction and not wanting Steve to see how distraught he was getting after only one day.
Tony shook his head hard and closed his eyes tight. He pressed his lips to Luca’s temple and tried to breathe slowly. “You need to go,” he choked out with a sob.
“Hi Pete. It’s really not a good time,” Steve said softly.
Tony sighed. “Okay.”
“I’ve given you four baths since we’ve been together, haven’t I? And we did this every time, buddy. I know you’re scared but I would never hurt you and I would never let anyone take care of you that was going to hurt you.” He rubbed the boys back with his flesh hand. “I’ve known Stevie here since I was a kid like you so I trust him. And he’s your dad. He’s just trying to help. Think you can be brave and we can try to get this bath done with all three of us?” Indy sniffled and looked very unsure but hesitantly nodded.
Tony looked at him. "Yeah, I know him and look what he did. He tried to kill me."
“I’m not doing anything,” he replied, sounding so insecure that Steve wanted to shake some sense into him so maybe he’d believe him once and for all.
“It’ll only be for a little while, we can hang out and watch movies,” Bucky tried.
***********
“Buppy!” Indy exclaimed, smiling wide.
"Wakanda is on lockdown right now, no one can get in. Some people found out where it was located and they're trying to minimize attention to the area." Steve paused, running his hand through his hair and looking over at Bucky. "I know this is insane, coming to you, after everything." Tony laughed at that, mirthlessly, but let him continue. "I just don't know how long we'll be out of touch with Wakanda, it's already been weeks and the arm got damaged in a fight against some Hydra thugs a couple weeks ago. He's in a lot of pain. And we have a high tolerance with the serum so for him to even admit that says a lot. And every once in awhile it's like this energy surge or shock or something runs through it and practically knocks him out. It's not like we can go to a hospital... I didn't know what else to do, but I had to try something."
“No,” Indy shouted. His face was red now, tears streaming non-stop and he was on the verge of hyperventilating if they couldn’t get him to stop.
“Is it bad?” Tony asked with a slight tremor to his voice that had Bucky looking up quickly.
“FRIDAY, where’s Clint?”
“I didn’t think you did Tony but, honestly, even if you had I don’t see the problem here.” Tony looked at him incredulously, breathing still coming too fast. “Come here, please,” he leaned back, slouching down a little on the sofa and pulled Tony so more of him was covering Steve. “Try to slow you’re breathing okay? In and out, nice and slow.” Tony nodded against him and he could feel him trying.
“Thanks,” Bucky said quietly, handing his daughter over.
“No sleep, ‘Teev.” Tony looked at him like he was crazy for offering.
“Okay,” Steve agreed softly. Tony pulled out his phone and text Bucky to bring him in. They arrived a minute later so they must have been waiting for the okay to enter. Bucky carried him, once again wrapped in his blanket but when they entered the room Indy buried his face against Bucky’s neck.
Steve approached quietly so as not to startle either of them and once he got Tony’s attention he held the water out for him to see then placed it on the end table next to his chair. “Hydrate,” Steve said simply. Tony nodded but continued his murmurings to his son while he gently rubbed and patted his little back.
“You can’t leave now, Buck,” Steve said before he protested. “Please. We need to talk, but it’s late. You can stay here tonight.”
“All right, lets get you boys to bed.” Tony smiled, glad that he and Steve were heading to bed together regardless of how awful their day had been.
Tony spent the rest of the day and night taking care of the baby while Steve helped occasionally while also taking care of Indy. Bucky had made himself scarce, not even showing up for dinner.
“Sorry, kiddo,” Bucky said softly to Tony, who was peeking over at him. “Don’t want you to get sick if we left it dirty.”  Tony reached out to him so he pulled him off of Steve and cuddled him to his chest. “So you don’t hate me then?” Tony looked at Bucky and shook his head quickly.
“What?” Steve asked at Tony’s smile.
“It wasn’t the bath,” Steve said shortly. Tony waited but Steve didn’t elaborate.
Five days.
“No,” Indy mumbled around his pacifier.
"Ready to eat?" Bucky asked.
Steve pet Tony’s head and Tony melted into him. “It’s just loud noise and bright light, it’s not going to hurt you.” Tony didn’t look so sure. “You wanna sleep here with me tonight?” Tony nodded so quickly it was obvious that’s what he was waiting for. Steve smiled and got comfortable. “Close your eyes, I’ve got you,” he whispered over the top of Tony’s head. “Good night, Tony. You’re safe here, don’t worry.”
He pushed me back onto the sand. It was effortless, as were most of the things he did. I felt him on top of me: the warmth of his body, the smoothness of his skin, the strength of his muscles.
“Tony!”
Gratefully, Steve took him up on the offer. They were sitting across from each other, enjoying each other’s company and the pad Thai before them, when Steve brought up the topic. The next day, Tony had Pepper reschedule all his meetings. He spent the rest of the day deliberately avoiding her and her questions.
He could still taste the bitterness.
He saw it as a parting gift, and he hoped she’d understand it was always hers. He had just been holding onto it because he couldn’t hold onto her. On second thought, maybe he didn’t want her to gleam that. It was too much to bear and much more so once he was gone.
Tony wished he, too, could disappear.
I couldn’t speak at your funeral. I tried. Sam took over. He gave a great speech. I watched it on the news a few days later. I couldn’t listen to a word he said that day. It was too raw. Carol asked me if I remembered the day, the day we found you.
She eyed him carefully. “You alright?”
However, my father was kind, if only to her. He loved her, after all. And he couldn't bear to see his wife suffer.
He composed an email. He let her know he’d gladly arrange all accommodations for her. She only needed to state her preferences — flight time, hotel, and the like. Happy would be waiting for her at the gate and would take her to her hotel. If she wanted a tour of his home, he could arrange for that. Likewise, if she wanted a tour of his offices. And if she wanted to do both, they’d make time.
I sliced my hand punching a mirror because I hate seeing young men die. Was I always such a basket case? Or, is it because you’re dead?
He had always enjoyed watching him work, especially when he worked with his hands. Steve had imagined what it would be like to have Tony’s total and complete attention, to have his hands roaming his body. He didn’t berate himself for those thoughts anymore. They were allowed. The future was his, and he wasn’t going to be trapped.
“Wouldn’t want you to do that,” said Steve, pulling him closer until their lips met.
Pepper met all the criteria. She had been employed with the company for years, had reported directly to Tony for half that time, and was more aware of the ins and outs of the company than half the board itself. She was a natural choice.
“I thought… I thought I had made it clear.”
“You’re stronger,” he said.
He didn’t know how to fix a broken human, if he had, he would’ve endeavored to fix himself.
They stood quietly contemplating the air around them. She knew he was lost in his thoughts and squeezed his hand. She was caught by surprise when he pulled her into a hug. He wrapped his arms around her and nestled in the nook of her neck, careful to make sure the drink in his hand didn’t spill down her back.
Tony disconnected before Steve could respond. He got out of bed, got dressed, made the bed, and gathered his belongings. He called a cab while getting dressed, and a car was waiting for him when he walked out of the building. It was a quick trip to the Tower.
“If I kiss you, I won’t stop,” said Tony.
Kamala was on edge. She warned him of the storm. He was flying right through it, but there was little he could do. He had to trust his instincts.
This future was strange. All his life, he had been taught to hate the things about himself he couldn’t control. He had been trained in the art of war. He was a machine for killing, another tool of the state. He was the perfect soldier, but he was far from being a perfect man. He had his weaknesses. His eyes lingered for far too long when walking through the showers. The more he tried to clear his mind of impure thoughts, the harder it was to stop thinking of them.
It was manageable.
It was a strange sensation, knowing he would depart from this planet, never to return. There were so many places he had never been, so many things he had never seen. He still had time to explore. To walk across the barren tundra, to scale the tallest mountains, and explore the deepest jungles.
“Just your gorgeous self, darling. I’ll be waiting,” he said, laughing.
“She was younger than he, as is our custom. I don’t remember her, though sometimes, I hear her voice. I can’t tell you how I know it’s her, but it must be. Her spirit speaks to me, counsels me.”
The condensation coated his fingers. Why hadn’t he thought of taking a napkin when he had the chance?
He didn’t say any of that though.
My mother never returned from her trip. They were all buried in the ash. There was no pleading with the gods. And no sacrifice would bring her back.
“No! Wait, wait. I’ll call you a cab,” said Tony, distractedly.
Tony admired her. He admired her bravery, and her dedication. But most of all, he admired her spirit. He knew Steve would too. Steve would love her. He’d say something outdated. “That kid, she has gumption,” or something of the sort.
Steve faced him, wearing a curious expression. “Your jokes, I don’t get them,” he said.
“Buy me some time!”
“You know I can’t stop saying what I’m thinking! Does it offend you that I find other men attractive? Does it offend you that I find a teammate attractive — not that you’d have much ground to stand on, considering you were fucking Jan knowing she’s married. I know, for a fact, that you were raised to believe that meant something! Or, is it that I don’t find your attractive? Because that’s a lie, darling. I’d blow you right now, if you asked. Just ask, all you have to do is ask!
In a way, you are. You are by my side, but it’s not the way I wanted it. Not the way I thought it would be.
Tony had been in remission, there were no signs.
He could do this. He could do this. He had to do this.
He missed working on his armor. Though the ship gave him much to do and much more to figure out, it wasn’t the same. He had been Iron Man for so long, and it had consumed so much of his time, he seldom knew what to do with himself, since time was all he had now.
He made his way out west. At first, he wasn’t sure why. Soon it dawned on him.
He clicked on the last message from Fury and showed it. “Ultimates business.”
I sat up. The sand fell from my head and off my back. He laughed as he brushed the sand out of my hair and off my shoulders. The little that remained didn’t bother me. Nothing bothered me in his presence. I turned to him and pushed his hair back. The golden ringlet framed his face beautifully, but I wanted to see those eyes.
Tony hadn’t been able to find a suitable replacement. He couldn’t stop thinking he was replacing Pepper, which was absurd. He wasn’t replacing Pepper. They were still friends and she still worked for the company. He was just looking for a new assistant.
“You hooked up with men?”
“Hello,” he said.
“Oh? What, exactly?”
“Steve! Steve, did you know? DID YOU KNOW ABOUT TONY?”
I’ll probably burn this letter. I can’t leave incriminating evidence lying around. I just don’t trust anyone at SHIELD, not that anyone trusts me. It’s exhausting. I avoid sleeping whenever possible, but you’ve stopped haunting my nightmares.
He pulled her into a hug. He ran his fingers through her hair, it was longer now than it had been when they first met, years ago.
“We thought… I mean, I thought that… It’s good to have you back, Cap.”
He dropped his duffel bag and shield next to the sofa and kept his arms at his side. He was exhausted. He hadn’t had a full night’s sleep in days. And though he didn’t need as much sleep as others, he still needed his rest. On the flight back, he kept dozing off, but hadn’t wanted to sleep.
“Most often, I can feel her when you look at me,” I said.
Standing face-to-face, he was taller, but not noticeably so. It was only at this distance that I noticed. He stood up straight and held me at arm's length. Examining me. I thought I’d hate it. I thought I’d hate to have someone bore into me, but I didn’t.
“Tony?”
Even after years of knowing him, it still struck me just how honest he was.
Steve sat up quickly.
Lying on the floor, he started crying. Steve couldn’t think.
“Five years, which for you is just a power nap,” he said.
“There was something buried, deep beneath the Bay,” he said. “Linked to the reactor, working its way to surface, every minute.”
I stared at him in confusion as he wrapped his arms around my waist and nestled into my neck.
Normally, he would’ve had his PA arrange the interview, but considering his PA was no longer in that position, and transitioning into a new role, so he’d have to do it himself.
“Yay!”
“Yes, Pep.”
Tony caressed his cheek. “I’m so glad you’re here,” he said, softly.
I would know the smell of him, the curve of his spine, and the feel of his lips on mine. The way his body reacted to mine, pressed so close. I would know those clear, azure eyes anywhere. Anywhere in the world.
He was trying to control his temper. He was pissed, but that wasn’t the caller’s fault. How were they supposed to know he was avoiding everyone?
What if he were a sentimentalist?
And so, Jim was the one and only choice. He was all the things Tony wished he could be. Jim would do right by him, he knew that. Knew that as well as he knew aerial maneuvers.
Tony didn’t answer him. He was busy unhooking all the straps, and besides, there would be enough time to discuss these matters on the flight back.
“Regenerative formula?”
He thought back to those days, when they were still together. He would always love her, would always think fondly of their time together, but they weren’t compatible. They wanted different things in life. She wanted the kind of simplicity Tony couldn’t offer her without sacrificing a part of himself he wasn’t willing to shed. She ended things amicably.
“Yes, Tony. It’s me,” said Steve, slowly approaching him.
It was his mantra. He told me, time and time again, "My father and his father before him were made of iron, and by virtue of being my son, so are you."
I never wanted to bathe, I wanted to wear his scent for the rest of my days.
She hugged him tighter. “Oh, Tony, what is it?”
“Just barely,” he added.
“Tony, you’re not rambling, but we should get back,” said Steve.
And it was, up until it wasn’t.
"Senecio," he said.
When stargazing was too much, he devoted himself to reading all the bestsellers he had bought but neglected over the years. He had stacks of books, as well as the numerous magazines and journals to which he had subscribed. Pepper had teased him about it before, noting he should discard the ones that were out of date. Eventually, he did, but the pile would soon grow into a new column.
You were already so sure. That night in Yankee Stadium… What was the point? I contacted you the only way I knew I could. The only way I knew wasn’t being monitored because
“I know, I read your diary,” said Tony, laughing.
And moreover, he couldn’t do his job and hers. Jim had teased him, saying he was pickier with assistants than with girlfriends. Tony hadn’t found it funny; the wound was too fresh. Picking at a scab would only make it bleed.
“Antonius, it is my job to care for you,” he said, there was a hint of pride in his voice.
Damn bastard almost killed me. If he had, would I be seeing you again? Would you even want to see me?
“Oh no,” he said, repulsors at the ready, when he found the gyrosphere. It was encased.
Tony stood too quickly and slipped on his dressing robe. It was loosely tied in front and dragged along the floor. He fell forward and the bottle in his hand slipped and rolled toward Steve. Some of the vodka spilled, but luckily the bottle didn’t break.
No, he wasn’t going to think about all of that now. Not when Steve needed him, and they needed to get out of here. They had lost so much time.
“I’m happy you’re here, Pep. That’s all,” said Tony.
He searched his kitchen until he found the cookbook. It was one of the few things of hers he kept in this house. There was the piano in the center of the living room and a chandelier overheard, both had been hers too. This though, this was more personal than either of those.
His muscles were atrophied. He needed some time to compose himself. Tony kept an arm around him; supportive.
Herculaneum was the wealthier of the two cities and being that Maria was born into wealth and married wealthy, it was only fitting she died there instead.
“Okay, I know, but I mean,” he trailed off so Steve jumped in.
“Thanks,” Bucky answered quietly. “I appreciate that, Tony.” Bucky pushed Tony’s hand off of him playfully. “Enough with the feelings, why don’t you go check on your guy.”
“He told me to leave,” Steve answered sadly.
"Stop," Tony interrupted loudly. Taking his voice down a notch, he continued. "What do you need? That's all I want to hear from you right now."
“Um, did Tony tell you what I told him to?” Steve asked nervously. He didn’t want to get too specific in front of Indy. Tony was already nodding as he walked in from the kitchen with a sippy cup of milk for Indy. Bruce nodded as well.
“No, please. Pa and Da.” Indy pointed to the doorway.
“Okay,” he replied, softly and smiled. “I think I’m going to put her to bed.”
“She has a name now,” Steve told his son.
“I don’t mind,” Peter said immediately. “I want to help.”
“No,” Steve answered quickly. “No, Tony, I love you. I’m just giving you options.”
“I can read the book to you,” Bucky offered. “If your Papa doesn’t mind.” Indy patted Bucky’s shoulder where his hand had been resting.
“I think that means it’s time for us to get out of your hair,” Natasha said, as she stood up. She gave Steve a quick hug. “Thanks for having us, it was nice. You’ve got a good kid.”
“Relax, its fine. I’m not cold.” Tony believed that because Steve was bundled in sweatpants and a hoodie and ridiculous fuzzy Christmas socks. Steve was flipping through Netflix before finally settling one of the new holiday movies. They watched for a about a half hour before Steve could feel Tony fidgeting and then heard a telltale sniffle. “Hey, you okay?” Tony nodded but didn’t respond otherwise. “Is it the movie?” Steve asked, smiling softly. Tony shook his head then pulled the blanket over his face. Steve paused the movie then wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him, all bundled in his blanket, further onto his lap and tighter against him. Steve kissed the side of his head because that was closest to his face now. “Baby, what’s going on in there? Are you upset about something?” Steve was starting to sound worried now so Tony pulled the blanket away from his face and managed to turn himself over so he was facing Steve’s chest instead of away.
The day Tony told Jim he’d be leaving, Jim had reached for him and pulled him into a hug. It reminded Tony of that hug in the desert long ago. He wouldn’t cry, not today.
It was dark now and we were alone. It occurred to me then that I had never asked about his mother or about his homeland. I didn't even know his name before he came into my home.
I paused. He had moved closer while I spoke. I could hear his slow breaths as he waited for me to say something, anything.
They were quiet for a moment, lost in their thoughts. There was so much to say and so little time.
He hadn’t never been materialistic before, but months in a cave, and days wandering the desert had cured him of whatever materialism had been present in his system. Sure, he was obsessive and protective of his armors, their designs, and the other technologies he had developed, but those were intellectual properties. Though the armors were tangible, it wasn’t their physicality he valued. It was they represented.
She came by his hotel room on the last night, and he let her in. Welcoming her.
She had pulled him out of the doldrums when no one else could. He was grateful, happy even. She saw something in him he didn’t see in herself. She brought out the best in him. And he kept trying to be worthy of her love, of her dedication.
“Yeah,” said Tony.
It was a long time before he could walk on the sand again. But that night, upon returning to the US, he looked up at the moon, and finally understood what the poets said. He finally understood why they sang her praises. He finally understood what drove humans to gaze upon her, waning and waxing.
“Then, why aren’t you letting go?”
You think I’m such a liar. And yeah, maybe I am, but you’re a sore loser and now you’re dead.
Simply, beautifully, as he said all the things. And I had never had a reason to doubt.
“I have always loved you. You… you gave me a home.”
They took one of Tony’s nondescript cars. It was an older black Audi. They stuffed their bags in the trunk, and kept Steve’s shield under wraps, nestled under their pillows and blankets. And then, they drove across the southwest.
He pulled away. He didn’t want to bring up Sunset. He didn’t want her to think it was more than a passing thought. He was reminiscing, but he didn’t want anything to do with Sunset. Once had been more than enough.
They were his ticket to freedom, they were the wind beneath his feet, the were motion.
It was only after that he realized how warped his views were. She had seen a vulnerable young man, and she had taken advantage. He was hurting and insecure and she offered relief.
The only thing I could sense, and it was everything I had ever wanted it to be. He had never kissed me before, but I had always wanted it, and now I knew. And so, did he. I had dreamt of this moment both awake and asleep. Very rarely is life better than one’s dreams.
He had heard the door slide open and their soft footsteps approach. He relaxed. He knew who it was, would always know when it was her.
No one would believe him. No one would believe she belittled him. No one would believe she kept watch and tracked his every move.
His hands, roughened from years of work, made their way down my chest. I kept my breathing still. He kept his eyes on me.
“Who?”
When he returned, Gail and Bucky were seated on the couch speaking in hushed voices. Steve had intruded enough. They’d been polite enough to invite him to dinner, but dinner was over, they needed their space, and Bucky needed to rest.
And I kissed him. I wrapped my arms around him and even though we were naked and wet, he was still so warm. He was my very own furnace.
She was born in a town near the Tyrrhenian coast – Herculaneum – and on that fateful day near the
Of course, my father didn't feel that way. The memory of my mother haunted him. And so, looking into my eyes, he only saw reflected his worst nightmare: a woman covered in ash. Of course, it was too much to bear.
His labored breaths came in quick succession.
Tony was sitting in front of his computer. There were screens all around him. His S-shaped workstation made it easy to move around the vast, open room. It was modeled after his other workshops, both the one in Avengers Mansion and the one in Malibu. The vaulted ceiling gave the impression that the room was larger than it was since space was limited on the ship. There were computer monitors beeping and cables connecting various devices to one another. If Tony weren’t careful, he’d trip over a cord.
He knew it wasn’t enough, he knew he still had a problem, but he was managing it.
She had everyone wrapped around her finger.
He couldn’t believe he was thirty. For the first time in a long time, he was looking forward to the future. In a few days’ time, he’d be meeting the crew.
“Thirty? Wow.”
They were the color of the sea, and I drank them in. Neptune must’ve blessed him at birth with eyes as clear as the waters in which we swam. And the Tyrrhenian was at its warmest this time of year.
He covered his mouth with his gauntlet. It would have been funny under any other circumstance. He didn’t need to see Tony’s face to know he was shocked by what he had said. Yet, Steve knew it was the truth. It was much too earnest to be a lie. But the question was why, why was he saying this? And why to Steve?
"How so," I asked.
Steve sighed. Some days, it felt as if they did more harm than good.
He smiled.
JOCASTA spoke. “Tony, it has been several hours since you last left your dormitory. It would be wise to spend time with your shipmates,” she said. She pulled him from his reverie. His fragmented thoughts left him shaky, or was it the lack of food? When had he last ate? He couldn’t remember, which never boded well.
She’d come to him unsure but determined. Determined to find the answers, determined to do all she could to uncover the truth. Tony knew she was the real deal. She was a go-getter.
“Shut up,” said Steve. “You already woke me up. I’m coming over.”
Tony hadn’t asked him to stay the night and hadn’t wanted anyone to know Steve had been here, so Steve left before Tony awoke.
I couldn’t watch.
He had wanted a wife and a white picket fence. He had wanted children and a quiet life, but when he awoke in the future.
“What’s going on, Tony?”
Tony looked up at him, eyes glassy.
After some time, he confessed to Jarvis and Jim. He told them the truth. He told him what had happened, what had really happened. How he had been deceived.
Jim had offered Tony a place to stay for the holidays. Jarvis spent the holidays with his extended family and Tony, who had planned on spending the holidays with his parents, wasn’t looking forward to being alone. He had never loved the mansion, but now it was devoid of life. The little life it had.
Then he heard Tony’s — or rather, Iron Man’s — footsteps. He found the armor’s humming rather soothing. Not that he would ever tell anyone such a thing. He and Tony made eye contact. The armor was dented in several places, but it was nothing Tony couldn’t fix with several Irish coffees.
“At least it’s a good view,” said Steve, looking to the stars before them.
“Sorry, man,” said Jim, putting a hand on his shoulder. “I know this is rough.”
Tony had wanted to believe the wonderful woman he had met months ago, the one who had swept him off his feet was still there, under the hard veneer. He wanted to believe she cared. He wanted to believe she had his best interests in mind, but he couldn’t.
I should’ve been honest with you. In the beginning, before things got out of hand. Would you have listened? Did you listen?
Tony nodded.
“There’s the Cap I remember,” he said, with a hint of pride.
“Okay, okay. Let me, Tony. Relax.” Steve took Luca in his hands and moved him to where he needed to be and he started drinking right away. Steve held him there so Tony didn’t have to at the weird angle but Tony’s hand still came up and cupped the boys head.
Bucky turned back to face them nervously. “Do you think maybe I could stay in the spare room tonight? I don’t even know what to do with her. If she wakes up,” he started, somewhat frantically.
“You okay?” Tony nodded and hummed noncommittally. Bucky was still staring at him. He clearly didn’t believe that but Tony looked away.
“Ugh,” Clint mimed clutching his chest, “My heart. The cuteness, it’s gonna kill me.” He pretended to trip and caught himself last second but Tony thought it was the funniest thing he ever saw, literally gasping for breath he was laughing so hard. Bucky shook his head. Little Tony was ridiculous and adorable. Steve dropped back once they were clear of the building and the threat of someone attacking lessened so Clint re-joined Natasha heading in to the jet and into the cockpit.
Tony stepped up to Bucky finally, about a foot away from where he sat on the stool, metal arm resting on the table. "Are you gonna try to kill me if I touch your arm?" Tony tried to say jokingly to ease his own anxiety.
He found a nurse who found a doctor who told him briefly what he had explained to Steve. Basically, they needed to operate near the reactor but it was risky. Not doing the surgery wasn’t really an option either though. They needed consent. He went back to Steve. “It sounds like they need to do this , Stevie. But, is there someone else that can help with this decision? Pepper, maybe?”
“What’s wrong, Tony?” Steve asked again. “Is it the name?”
“We know, Buck. It’s okay,” Steve assured. “We have to start looking in to this now though. If there’s more out there or even just the one we have to find them.”
“Fury, I swear to god. You can’t stop me, I can fly in there in the suit and blast them all to hell and get him out,” he insisted angrily.
It was past midnight and Steve was sitting in the dark on the sofa watching the livestream. Peter had stayed and after he fell asleep on the sofa Steve carried him to his and Tony’s bed to sleep. Steve refused to leave the living room longer than a few minutes. Tony and Luca had nodded off a couple hours before and Steve honestly felt like they probably both passed out. Even unconscious Tony’s grip on Luca’s body never slackened.
“I know. I don’t know if we’re going to be able to see him right now, but we can ask.” He felt a small nod. He cracked the cap off the Apple juice. “Take a sip.” Indy did then tapped Bucky softly on is hand. “Yes, buddy?”
“Hey,” she said softly, kissing his cheek and hugging him. “Hi, Luca.” She waved a finger at him. “You know we’ll come right back the second you want us to, or you can come down and get him. We’ll basically just be in another room,” she assured him.
“I told him to hurry or you’d eat his waffle,” Tony explained.
Indy walked past him silently, shocked, and climbed in the door that was opened by Happy previously. He got himself in his chair and Bucky leaned over to get the seatbelts situated. Indy was crying quietly now but Bucky had to ignore it for the moment. “Hate you,” Indy whispered. Bucky looked at him sadly, clicked the buckle in place and closed the door. He climbed in silently next to Happy in the front and he started driving right away.
"Because everything in me is screaming right now to get away from you because you're trying to kill me," Tony snapped. "And while I know that that's not what's happening at this moment it doesn't matter. I am two seconds from walking out on both of you so if you want this done you will get out of my sight."
“Hi, baby girl,” he cooed, placing his palm on her tummy and rubbing softly. She made little happy noises and then sneezed. Tony chuckled, “Oh boy, God bless you.” She sneezed again and he moved his head from Bucky’s shoulder. “Okay, if you weren’t so cute that would be gross.” He grabbed a tissue from the end table and wiped her nose.
The call to assemble came a couple days after that and Steve had half a mind to send the rest of the team, maybe even Bucky, so he could stay with Tony but one exasperated look from Tony had him suiting up. With assurances that Tony would be fine and that Bucky would be watching Indy Steve had left.
“Good,” Indy agreed.
Tony's hand subconsciously made its way to rub at his chest where the shield had been slammed into him 6 months prior. -Are you in New York? Tony replied.
“You’re the money, baby,” she replied, stepping closer. “I think the Avengers, especially your Captain there, will make Shield do whatever we want them to. And to help us get away once we get what we want he can wire us a large chunk of your money that I’m sure he has access to.” She gripped the hair on the top of his head in a fist and yanked it back so he was looking up at her. “How long we have to keep you here is all on them. Now, be good.” Her hand slid down the side of his face then down over his shoulder and arm til she reached the cuffs. She undid one and cuffed it to the chair so he had use of one arm now.
“I heard,” Bucky replied from where he was standing off to the side.
“Yeah she is,” Bucky replied quietly. The baby chose that moment to squirm and spit out the pacifier. She opened her eyes and whined but Indy leaned his head forward catching her gaze.
XXXXXXXXX
Peter stood up and walked over to Steve, wrapping his arms around the taller man and burying his face in Steve’s shoulder. “They’re gonna be there. This is going to work,” Peter assured him, voice muffled by Steve’s sweatshirt. Steve rubbed Peter’s back and made eye contact with Natasha over his head.
“It’s risky. And you’re right, it’s not what we should be doing but we don’t have other options. Our other option was Fury’s stance of not negotiating with terrorists so,” she shrugged. “We’ve come this far. Tony and Luca have come this far. We’ll have them back by the end of the week, we have to believe that.” Steve wanted to believe her.
“I mean, do you care? Because as much as I don’t want to reward bad behavior I’m like five seconds away from buying him one because he really want’s a baby. So... do you or Stark care?”
“Whatever,” Tony muttered.
“‘Teev?” Tony pulled his head back as much as he could within his sweatshirt cocoon to look at Bucky.
“Yup. I’m fine, promise.” Tony kissed Steve quickly and left the room.
"Tony, listen," Steve started once they were all in the shop.
Steve opened and closed his mouth without answering. Then abruptly stood up causing Indy to flinch back into Bucky’s embrace. “I, uh, I need a minute.” He quickly walked out of the room.
“Yes,” the boy whined, turning away and squishing his face into Bucky’s shoulder. Steve shook his head, exasperated, but Bucky just waved it off. He bounced Indy a little to get him in a good position then slung the baby’s diaper bag over his shoulder. He texted Happy to meet him at the entrance then put his phone in his back pocket. Poppy was looking up at him expectantly from her spot next to Tony.
“Oh, wait. He’s little, Tony. We don’t have a car seat for him,” Steve said worriedly. Tony gave his boyfriend a sheepish look.
“You need some help getting them down to the car?” Steve asked, though he felt Tony’s grip on him tighten.
A few pages in Tony entered the room and Bucky stuttered to a pause on the sentence he was reading.
“Toys,” Tony interrupted.
Tony smiled. “Love you, too. Forever.”
“Shopping is my specialty. Sounds fun,” he said excitedly. “Only the best for my favorite Tator tot,” Tony exclaimed grasping Indy and pulling him from Steve’s arms.
Steve finished his call and came back to sit next to Tony. “How is she? She looks very interested in you,” Steve laughed. The baby was staring at Tony’s face, one hand tapping his cheek and one holding his ear. Tony smirked.
"Bonding? Is that what you think this?" Tony asked.
“Thanks, Buck.”
“He was asking me to read what they say, I was wondering what he was doing. I didn’t realize it was apology chocolate,” Pepper laughed.
“Yeah, let’s do that. I need to do something.” Tony pulled him back into the hug. “Where’s Indy?”
“Very mature thought process, Captain,” Tony said, pushing away to meet Steve’s gaze.
“Pete,” Steve sighed. “That’s okay. It’s good, thank you.”
“ ‘uddle,” Indy repeated, smooshing his face into Steve’s neck and wrapping his arms around him.
“You’re good with him,” he told Bucky as he took Indy back into his arms.
“See you in a few, munchkin. You be good for Papa. I don’t wanna hear you causing a raucous around the store.” Steve laughed at Tony but Indy had no idea what he was saying. Steve walked back to the main aisle and then headed deeper in to the store. They bypassed the kids bedroom section and Steve made a mental note of things they might want to order online. He passed a section with plates, bowls and sippy cups for kids so he sent a quick text to Tony advising him to grab some things from that area too.
"Come down to the workshop," he said gruffly and turned and walked away before anyone could react. He wanted to be where his bots were, and all the Iron Man suits. He didn't really think that they were here to do harm but he was on the edge of a panic track and proximity to the suits could only help.
“Still nothing to be sorry for, Tony. You can sit here like this all day if you want. There’s nowhere I’d rather be.” He pushed Tony back a little so he could look at him. He looked exhausted, which was to be expected after giving birth, and he was pale.
“Shh, stay calm, baby. Almost done.” Steve washed Indy’s body quicker since there was less food there, then got the cup they use to wash his hair. He put one hand on the back of Indy’s neck. “Can you lean back for me so I can get your hair?” He pushed him back by his shoulder gently when he didn’t move on his own. Indy’s eyes were squeezed tightly shut and tears escaped down his cheeks. Steve poured the water on his hair quickly then began to rub some shampoo to get out all the oatmeal. “You’re still okay. Can you take a big deep breath for me?” Indy did and let it out with a quiet sob. “Good boy. You’re safe.” Steve rinsed his har a couple times and once the suds were gone he sat the boy up and hit the button to drain the water. “All done,” he announced.
“You weren’t safe then, but you are now. Me and Daddy and Bucky keep you safe now, right? And we wouldn’t let you do anything that wasn’t safe so today is going to be good, okay? I promise. And I’ll be right there with you.” Steve reached out, picking Indy up and bringing him to his chest. Indy wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck.
“He told me what happened this morning and I agree with his assessment of the situation and what he told you. Your body is basically confused from four days of doing something different, bathroom wise, on top of losing the effects of the serum. You’ll be fine in no time, I have no doubts about that,” he said, smiling kindly.
“What?” He replied, looking at Steve with teary eyes.
“God help me, I actually like that one,” Bucky said. Tony smirked.
“You alright over there?” He called.
“Wow. You’re so humble, Tony,” Steve deadpanned.
“That’s better,” Tony said. “Bigger than it should be on him but we’ll fix that soon enough.” Tony rubbed his hand over Steve’s back for a moment, knowing he was worried.
“I trust you to be there with him and assess the situation I just hate that we’re bringing this all up for him. She’s asking about the day you found him. He said he was strapped to a bed.” Bucky nodded. “She thinks you can help her lead the questions to get more info.”
“You can do it, I’m just making it easier. There,” Steve said once it was laying down with the opening facing the boy. Indy pulled out a a piece of tissue paper and then tried to grab the stack of gifts all at once. “One at a time, buddy.” Indy pulled out a flat wooden square with colorful pieces on the front and looked up at his Papa for an explanation. “That’s a puzzle, sweetheart. So you can learn your colors. You take all these pieces out then put them back in the right spots and each one has a different color on it. That’ll be fun,” Steve told him and while Indy was distracted he took the rest of the puzzle stack out of the bag so Indy could look through them.
“Baby safe,” he said as he pointed to the doll Bucky was detaching from the packaging.
"My Ma taught me how to make Mac and cheese but I improvised a little with what was in the fridge. I added some Monterey cheese in with the cheddar because I didn't have enough but it worked out pretty well."
“Girl,” the agent gritted out.
The elevator dinged and Steve jumped up, not expecting anyone to come by so late.
“I can do it,” Tony offered. “He was already upset because of me.”
“He’s on a lot of meds so he’s a little dazed. But you and Indy were the first thing he asked about,” Pepper answered. “We’ll check in with him later, you guys get in there.”
“Hey, Buckaroo. Where’s my Poppy seed?”
“Really?”
“You headed home tonight?” Steve leaned more toward Peter to stay in the frame. Tony sighed.
“Buppy hold.”
“Sir, the items you ordered have been delivered. I’m sending them up in the elevator,” Jarvis announced.
“Oh,” Steve breathed, relaxing a little. Tony slid off the edge of the bed on to the floor in front of Steve.
“Please,” he said, tugging on the man’s wrist. Bucky looked down at him and Tony lifted one hand up in silent question to be held. Bucky picked him up, adjusting the shirt so it covered him everywhere it needed to. Tony cuddled into Bucky’s chest, resting his head on his shoulder and shivered.
“No. This particular Hydra facility apparently thinks diapers and clothes are optional,” he said angrily.
“JARVIS, did Tony go to bed?”
“So they have him?” Tony asked, making eye contact with Bucky.
“Why go?”
“Well, I can think of one solution.” Tony picked Indy up again and the boy clung to him instantly. “Wanna sleep with us tonight?” Indy nodded against Tony’s shoulder, while Steve shook his head exasperated. “It’s been a tough day. I need some baby cuddles,” Tony told him.  Steve leaned in and kissed Tony gently.
“Da,” Indy whined against Steve’s shoulder.
“They kept me chained to a chair the whole time. They never once let me up.” He looked at Tony to see if he was getting his point. He was pulling a wipe out of the plastic pack. Tony looked up at him.
“Marry me,” Tony blurted suddenly. Steve froze.
“No hungry,” Tony answered shaking his head but reached for more juice.
“I’ll always need you here, Steve. I really am sorry for what I said.”
“But then, when he’s happy,” he shook his head. “I don’t know. Obviously, that’s the goal, we want him happy. But it makes me more angry at Hydra when I see him smile or laugh over something stupid because he’s never even seen something normal before. I just couldn’t hide it this time, I had to leave the room. I’m sorry.”
“So much for our plan,” Clint whispered. They figured they would somehow take Graves back to Shield but it seems these people had calculated for that.
“I’m being good?” He looked at Bucky sadly.
“Thanks,” Tony said sincerely. Bucky nodded and patted Tony’s leg as he stood up.
“No peeing on me, got it?”
“Pa,” Indy managed. Tony gasped in excitement.
“I got this, take care of the llama,” he said, already putting a bunch of paper towels down on the mess with the help of Bruce.
“No kicking,” Tony said immediately.
Hearing Bucky speak so genuinely about the situation actually made Tony second guess his freeze out of Rogers.
“Hey,” Bucky called out as he walked into the living room where Steve and Tony were lounging on the sofa after putting Indy to bed. He was still staying in their guest room even though he had his own quarters. Sometimes he felt guilty, but times like this he just felt grateful that they were nearby because if they weren’t he’s sure he would panic. “Does she feel warm to you?” He stood directly in front of them and held Poppy out a little, half dressed and wriggling, so they could feel.
“No, you’re fine. Feels nice.” Steve was holding himself tense over Tony. “I promise it’s fine. Come on, settle down.” Tony pushed down on Steve’s back and waited for him to relax into it. Once he did, Tony ran his hand up and down his back and held one in Steve’s hair. “Just try to stay calm and close your eyes. Feel my breathing?”
“No Papa,” Indy mumbled around his thumb, clutching Tony’s sweatpants in his hand tightly.
“Sure,” Tony smiled. Indy had one arm wrapped around Tony’s thigh and he was sucking his thumb on the other with his head tilted against Tony.
Steve smiled. “See, he’s fine. He’ll see that you’re okay and everything will be great.” Tony sat up, wiping his face with his sleeve.
“I’ll have it typed up and filed, but are you sure?” Tony seemed hesitant.
“Okay well I can’t keep you hanging in the air like this,” he laughed.
“Captain—,” Fury started.
“JARVIS, start a warm bath, please.” The water started to fill the tub and Tony poured some of his own body wash in to make it smell nice and bubble up then he helped Steve to sit down. He began to wash Steve thoroughly, head to toe, and Steve melted into it.
Tony looked over at Steve surprised then back at Bucky. “I’ll be right here too,” Bucky told him. “Steve just want’s to hang out with you a little.” Bucky unzipped his sweatshirt and let Tony lean toward Steve. Steve scooped him up and sat him on his own lap. Tony fiddled with the ends of his shirt.
“You do, Tony. But it’ll be over before you know it.” He sprayed the wound without further discussion and it shocked Tony into silence for a minute. Then he started sobbing.
“Auntie Pepper is going to tell you when to walk down the aisle, okay? Just like we practiced.” He leaned forward and kissed Indy’s forehead, then stood, nodded at Pepper and walked up to Steve to stand at his side. “You look like you’re gonna pass out, punk. You gonna make it?”
Bucky nodded quickly but the stopped abruptly to look at Steve. “No. I can’t. She should- um, I’m sorry,” he stuttered out. “I have to,” he gestured to the elevator and started to walk away.
“Yeah, that’s right,” Tony exclaimed excitedly. “We’re going to get you so much stuff.” Tony pulled on the bottom of Indy’s shirt. “We’re going to get you all new clothes, some toys, some books, some stuff for your room.” Tony turned toward Steve. “We need a whole kids bedroom set for him right?”
This is just a short chapter to prove I haven’t forgotten about this story! The next chapter will be the wedding and the final chapter for this fic BUT I will be writing more in this universe, just need to end this particular fic at some point lol.
“He is currently asleep, Captain. Would you like me to wake him?”
Steve hummed in agreement. “I am a very mature person,” he replied, placing a quick kiss on the tip of Tony’s nose. Tony laughed.
“We’ll support whatever decision you make. But I know you can do this. And Tony and I will be there for you every step of the way, like you were for us. And hey, we all live in the same place, you got a bunch of built in babysitters. Plus, Indy wanted the baby too, and I don’t want that to weigh on your decision, but just saying, he’ll be a great little helper whether you want it or not.” Steve smiled, clapped his hand on Bucky’s knee then stood up. “I’ll give you some time to yourself, but, if you’re up to it come join us after.”
“I don’t even know what that is,” Steve replied, shaking his head.
“No,” Steve protested, reaching out for the forms like he thought Tony was going to keep them away. “Have to go home, Tony.”
“I finished up and shut everything down and go to pick him up and he’s a got a hammer and he’s pretending to fix Dum-E’s wheels. So I told him it’s not a toy, he could get hurt and to hand it over. He kept yelling no and I finally had to just grab hold of him and snatch the hammer away but he swung out and,” Tony hesitated.
Steve was up first the next morning which was not uncommon. He started the coffee and turned on a some Christmas cartoons for background noise. Bucky was up next with a sleepy baby in his arms.
“So do you,” Peter replied, looking over at him. Steve smirked.
"He's not good at 'feelings.'" Bucky rolled his eyes. Tony smirked.
“So she’ll be Steve’s too then,” Bucky replied, keeping his voice down so the agent couldn’t hear them.
“Pa?”
“Dahhh, ah,” Luca gurgled, patting Steve’s lips with his tiny hand.
Steve nodded, draining the rest of the juice and putting the empty bottle on the table in front of him. “They’re going to operate. They have to,” he answered softly.
“Pa, my ah-ma,” he said so genuinely thankful for it that Steve wanted to cry.
“Thank you,” Indy said happily, unprompted which thrilled Steve and Tony.
“Yah,” he exclaimed. Steve nodded to Bucky so they all went into the living area. Bucky sat in the armchair with Indy on his lap, the llama and book securely in his hold. Steve sat on the sofa diagonal from them and smiled softly at the sight of his best friend and son together. Bucky opened the book and started reading the first page and Indy pressed his back to Bucky’s chest, rearranging himself so he was facing out and could see the book perfectly.
“You can do it, you’re okay, huh?” Tony continued, and Steve could hear the anxiousness creeping into his voice more and more. He was sure that the baby could pick up on that and it probably wasn’t helping. Steve sat on the edge of the rocking chairs cushioned ottoman, next to Tony’s feet.
“Me? You’re the one acting Iike you’ve raised a bunch of kids before. You sure you haven’t?” Steve laughed. Bucky shrugged again but looked embarrassed.
“The money they want is no problem, the rest we have to work with Shield but we’re getting them back, Peter,” he said confidently, even if he wasn’t feeling it at the moment. Peter nodded.  “They’re on the screen if you want to see.” Steve nodded in that direction. Peter turned and gasped. He walked closer and watched as Tony sat with Luca sitting in his lap facing him cuddled against his stomach. Steve walked up behind Peter and put an arm around him and the teen turned quickly and buried his face in Steve’s shirt. He was quiet but Steve could feel the tears wetting his shirt. He kissed the top of his head. “We’re getting them back, no matter what we have to do. I promise that.”
Tony chuckled. “Yeah, you can tell him that he can’t play with the baby. See how that goes.”
“You’re amazing.”
“Exactly,” Steve smiled at him. “I love you.” He kissed Tony’s forehead and Tony knelt up on Steves lap and pressed a sloppy kiss to Steve’s lips. Steve grimaced at the drool he left behind but smiled for Tony.
“I think the less people here the better so Indy can focus but I truly think Bucky could be helpful during this session.”
“Okay, good.” Tony kissed him. “Let’s go put out some snacks, people will be here in a few minutes.” Tony turned to leave but Steve grabbed his hand.
“Buppy,” Indy said as he nodded.
“Where’d you learn that?” He asked, sounding annoyed.
“What can Tony do?” Tony asked as he came back into the room carrying Indy’s snack.
“What happened to Tony? Did he get hurt?” He heard Steve breathing heavy, possibly crying. “Steve, listen to me,” he said sternly. “Tell me what happened.” The Avengers had left a couple hours previously when Fury called about a threat downtown. Clearly, something went wrong.
The Quinet door opened and Bruce was waiting for them. Steve and Natasha entered the jet and Clint and Coulson took the SUV back.
“Then you can be ‘da,’” Steve smiled. “I can be a different name. He can call me whatever he want’s as long as he’s happy.”
“Sergeant Barnes,” FRIDAY interrupted. “Happy is going to meet you in the car downstairs in 3 minutes. He said he’ll drop you off and then come back here with the kids.”
Bucky laughed. “I don’t know, he can’t say Bucky. I corrected him the whole first day I had him and then I just let it go.”
“Yeah, with both,” Indy answered, pointing to the pan.
“I know you wanted me or Papa but you could have tried to wake Bucky nicely like how he woke me up. Just no hitting anymore, okay?” Indy nodded, sticking his index finger into his mouth and sucking it nervously. Tony kissed his head. “Can you say sorry to Bucky for hitting him?”
Tony returned from where Indy had been watching a cartoon with the small boy in his arms. “There’s Papa,” he announced as he handed Indy over to Steve. Steve took him but the Indy was already leaning towards the other man in the room.
He pulled us apart and dragged us home. I was kicking and screaming, but it didn’t matter. The gods wouldn’t answer. This was foretold, I was sure of it.
“I see the way you look at me, don’t think I don’t. But you’re too scared, or too worried, or maybe you’re ashamed. I grew up ashamed. I slept with women far older than me so it would end up on the tabloids, and the paparazzi wouldn’t follow me to the bars on the Lower East Side. I’ve been ashamed of so many things over the years, but I’m not anymore. This is who I am! I’m dying Steve, I’m not going to stop drinking and I’m not going to deprive myself of eye candy. I may be a masochist, but that’s not the kind of pain I like.
“It’s fine, darling. I can walk,” said Tony, as Steve offered his hand. He stood and started making his way to the bedroom before stumbling. Steve swooped in and carried him, despite Tony’s protests.
The mood changed; Steve looked away. He looked out, into the stars.
At night, long after we’d completed our ablutions, and the house settled into silence, we’d sneak away. We never hid in the same place and we never stayed out too late. As soon as we were alone, we’d waste no time discovering each other’s bodies and memorizing the sounds we made.
He couldn’t stop himself from reaching out, from caressing his cheek.
“Oh, don’t you start,” said Tony. There was a playfulness to his tone.
He didn’t know what else to say. Why was Tony acting this way?
Tony continued to support the bulk of his weight as they moved through the ship. They couldn’t linger. They needed to get out. Tony knew there were guards, he just hadn’t encountered them. Yet.
His golden hair was like the rising sun. His azure eyes were so clear. I could imagine the nymphs playing in those waters.
He sounded worse in person than he had on the phone.
He found himself reading poetry more and more as the days passed. The scientists and the thinkers were much too considered with minutiae, but not the poets. They understood. Though we could explain many phenomena, we couldn’t explain it all. He knew he wouldn’t be around for the scientific breakthroughs that would change the world. If he were to return, he would hope the world would have progressed. He would hope some of the problems of the past would be no more. But he hoped there would still be love. He hoped there would still be joy.
"Because you can't lie to me," he said.
Once inside, behind the locked door, she pulled him into a kiss. Her lips were soft, and she cradled his head as if he were something precious. He gave into the kiss, relaxing at her touch.
Steve had loved the desert. Growing up in New York and fighting fascists in Europe had left him with little chance to see the desert with his own eyes. He had never been that far west.
I’ve started this letter so, so many times. Everything… It hurts.
You can follow me on
Iron man.
“I want to hear it all.”
I dressed his wounds and half carried him back to our bed. I didn’t know when I had started thinking of it as such, but I had. The pain was too much, he couldn’t sleep, and I didn’t know how to comfort him. I cried until dawn. And when they took him away, I collapsed on the floor.
Or so, he thought.
I read the stupid letter you left me.
“Steve, it’s Pepper. I… I need you to come into the office.”
He smiled mischievously. I always liked that smile of his; the slight smirk of his lips, the way his eyes crinkled.
“Antonius…”
Tony was standing on the balcony overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It was dark now. A few, sparse clouds were making their way across the sky. It was not the best night for stargazing. He found he preferred it that way, for in due time, he would be among the stars. He could gaze at them all he wanted then, but he would never be able to see the clouds again.
And I don't know how we weren't caught, but that was only the beginning of our indiscretions.
Although many thought he would find himself another wife, he never did. Often, I was told I resembled her. It brought me solace. She had left her mark on the world, and I would try to honor her. I like to think all my best qualities came from her.
I spent hours in study. My tutor, himself a slave, was a man from Greece. He told me of the places he had seen. His stories were so captivating. I could listen to him for hours. He taught me Greek and I learned it with relative ease.
Tony explained how much he hated waking up with a hangover. Told him all about the awful morning after’s he had had. And so, he’d built up a tolerance. If he could drink more than others, he’d never be more vulnerable than they were. He could feign control of situations. And then, when he started taking chemotherapy, it made it easier to hide the nausea.
Tony lived his life on the cutting-edge. His armor was a modern marvel. Itself, endlessly fascinating. Though Steve was much more interested in the pilot. He was madly, deeply in love with Tony. He wished he could tell him that. He wished he could reassure him. Let him know he wasn’t like his other partners. They had only been interested in his money, the comforts that money could afford, and his body. They didn’t care about his brain, and they didn’t care about the man.
“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that idea excites you, but what are the chances you’re not a straight edge? It would be my luck, to confess to having gay affairs when I can’t stop sharing with you all these things that were better left unsaid,” said Tony.
We returned to the house; our togas soaked. They dried as we walked, but not enough. We would have to leave them out to dry. My father rose early the next day, he was going to the Senate. He saw the togas hanging out back and questioned one of the house servants. She didn’t have an answer, but my father was a smart man. He knew.
There was no better feeling than flying. From the rough sketch to the finished armor, it was all a dream come true. He had called it a vanity project because it was. He could be vain, but now? Now, he was a proud. Proud of himself for building a spacesuit, a spacesuit he was testing.
And again, Steve smiled. He smiled more around Tony in the last few minutes than in the weeks he had been away. Coming back was the best thing. He never wanted to leave.
He needed to work on his tendencies, needed to work on his coping mechanisms, but he was eager. Eager to see what lay beyond the edges of the atmosphere. He was eager to see what was beyond earth’s gravitational pull.
He took his time finding an interviewer. She had to have the right voice, the right approach. Someone who understood. He read many, many different interviews. Finally, he found her. The right person to tell this story.
“Damn it,” said Tony. “So close.”
The only thing I could see.
Tony checked his gauntlet.
I wanted Tony to grow up without a mother, as he does in Ults, but in general, 616 is my reference point.
He didn’t have to play nice with Hank and could continue avoiding Janet. He still found it difficult to speak to her off the field. He couldn’t understand why she’d go back to that man.
I wanted to touch him, taste him, feel every inch of his skin. I wanted to feel his pleasure, wanted it to be my own. I can’t say how long we stood there as the water danced around us and the moon shone brightly, but I was home. I was at home in his arms and it didn’t matter.
I loved to hear it.
Tony had looked at him pointedly after they left the debriefing.
I read all about Achilles, Odysseus, and Aeneas.
He nodded. He couldn’t say much more. Though he didn’t believe in fate, he didn’t want to jinx it.
The next few weeks were the longest of my life. My father watched our every move, but we had no reason to suspect he knew.
He moved in close and traced a line along my collarbone. He murmured, "You look different."
“Dinner was lovely, but I have to go.”
I'm sorry for the long wait, and I hope you enjoy this update.
He ran towards him. He couldn’t believe this. He couldn’t believe he was alive. After all these years, he was alive. Alive and captive. Monica was using Steve’s… She was using Steve’s blood. Steve’s blood was the source of the regenerative formula.
