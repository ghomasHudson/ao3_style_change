“I can’t believe you were going to potentially drive through ice just to avoid getting on a plane,” Castiel deadpanned. “Relax. You’ll be fine.”
Dean half-smiled. “So I’ll go home and catch a few hours’ sleep before I come pick you up. Simple as that.”
Gabe hummed along as the song continued, and when it ended, he turned to Castiel and said, “You’re sounding pretty good there, bro. Is this your favorite Gene Kelly movie?”
“The sexiest,” Castiel deadpanned, trying not to let the veracity of those words bleed into his voice. He cleared his throat quickly and set about banking the fire, keeping it down to a collection of live embers and coals that he could quickly bring back to life the following morning.
“Shh, Cas. They won’t be up for long time.” And then he licked at a bead of precum on the tip of Castiel’s cock. Castiel whimpered.
“Don’t ask me,” Castiel replied as he hoisted himself out of the passenger seat. “I’m no mathematician.”
“Say no more.” Dean carefully stepped away from Bastet and paused by Castiel’s fridge. “D’you have any soda?”
“Thank you. For everythin’. Really. Thank you. You… were really nice to me, and you didn’t have to take care of me the way you did, but you still did it anyway, and you’re still takin’ care of me—” he gestured to the box “—anyway, I’m really lucky to, y’know…” He trailed off, his gaze darting to Castiel’s.
“All right, I hope you’ve all brought your copies of the Analects and Sutras, like I asked you to.” He swept up the pile of handouts and gave them to a student sitting in the first row, whose name was Damon. “Pass these down your row then hand them to the person sitting behind you, okay? Now, welcome to the third day of our unit on Eastern religions. We’ve only really begun to scratch the surface of these with Confucianism and Buddhism, but today, because it’s Friday and I wanted to mix things up a bit, we’re going to go a little outside of the box. As you can see from your handout, today we’ll be discussing the underlying themes of the supernatural in these two religions, specifically with regard to the roles of deities.” He flipped to the next slide and felt a surge of confidence at the way Dean was looking at him, all grin and pride. “All right. Let’s begin.”
Castiel relaxed with a chuckle, turning his attention back to the apple. “No, not at all.” He shrugged. “Still don’t like the way it tastes, though.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “I lost a bet with Gabe. It was either put on one of Anna’s church dresses or eat a handful of dirt.”
“Right,” Dean said loudly. “So we’ll go to the diner for breakfast at nine and leave around nine-thirty. Sound like a plan?”
Castiel nervously shifted from foot to foot; he really had to pee. The line for the bathroom was a good fifteen people long, and he was third in line.
Gabe nodded, shoving his hands into his pockets. “I’ll hit up the cafeteria, see if they’ve got anything good.”
Limp, lights still exploding in front of his eyes, Castiel reached for Dean and tugged him closer. “C’mere.” He pulled Dean in for a sloppy kiss, their teeth knocking together and their tongues tangling lazily, morning breath forgotten. Once again, Castiel could taste himself on Dean’s mouth, and he threaded his fingers through Dean’s hair as yet another spike of pleasure rattled through him. Their kiss turned to mouthing at each other’s necks, too relaxed to have any real technique. Dean shifted eventually, squirming closer to Castiel, half on top of him, propping his chin on Castiel’s chest and using his finger to trace patterns on Castiel’s stomach. They were quiet for a moment, then Dean looked up at Castiel through his lashes and murmured, “Hey. Merry Christmas.”
Castiel nodded and went out of the room, closing the door behind him. Letting out a mental stream of curse words, he pulled out his phone and began a new text:
Castiel snapped awake, his body livid with tension and his teeth chattering. He lurched off the floor, a paper falling away from where it had stuck to his face. The room was dark and cut by jagged beams of light: both lanterns were lying on their sides. Dean was clinging to Castiel’s shoulders from behind. “What—what—?”
“No nightmare,” Castiel confirmed. He leaned forward and pressed a closed-mouth kiss to Dean’s lips, loving the way their stubble sounded as it grazed together.
“Again, that was Gabe.” Castiel put the two bottles down on the table. “He’s fond of the whole hog.”
“That’s us.” Castiel stood up, tugging up the handle on his carry-on as other people began moving towards the gate. “C’mon, Dean. Think of it like this: the sooner we get on the plane, the sooner we get off the plane.”
Castiel tried to smile, noticing the absence of Dean’s hands on his body and hating it. “Just me being an idiot. Sorry about falling asleep.”
Castiel sighed a little. “Because that’s what friends do. I’m not about to let you leave in a state like this. Besides, you spent all of August nursing me back to health. It’s the least I can do.”
. Instead, he let out a flat, strained moan that trailed off into a whimper as Dean’s tongue flicked at the head before pressing against the swollen vein on the underside. Shuddering, Castiel mustered what was left of his will and reached for the lube. “Up, please, Dean,” he gasped, and Dean complied, grinning as he pulled off with an obscene
— yes, this is worse than the tie-dye—”) but Castiel was very fond of it, having owned it since his freshman year of college.
“I know. I really can’t complain. I’ll have to show you some pictures sometime.” Hael leaned against the edge of his desk, put the receiver to her ear, and pushed the speed dial for Facilities. “Hi, Jordan, this is Hael, up in Professor Novak’s office. He needs a couple things hung on his walls — would you mind sending Rosie over for ten minutes or so? Perfect. Yes, the door is open. Thanks.” She hung up and swept her long, dark hair over her shoulder. “So, have you printed the syllabus for your Intro class?”
Castiel’s nose wrinkled. “Why. Pudding has the consistency of old soup and tastes like nothing but cheap sugar and even cheaper flavoring.”
and HUBRISANDWAX IS A GODDESS AND YOU SHOULD ALL BOW DOWN TO HER just sayin'. she made this mess readable. forever indebted <3 <3 <3
Castiel’s tongue felt like it was ten pounds and he blinked slowly, trying to get the black spots to go away. “Yessss,” he managed as the spinning got even worse, the ground seeming to tremble beneath him, “I’m fine.” And then he was falling and everything was gone, gone, gone.
The nurse chuckled as she kept pace with him. “Sounds like a rom-com.” When Castiel didn’t reply, she glanced at him and noticed his blush. “Oh no. Did I just put my foot in my mouth?”
“Gabe, you were always so theatrical.” A pretty redhead strode into the room, looking half-annoyed and half-amused. “Why there’s a need for all this play-acting, I don’t know.”
“Do you have supplies?” Castiel asked, his heart pounding. He had no idea what kind of footing they were on now, if they would’ve kissed or just written it off as a huge mistake—
Meg and Kevin slurred something in response. Garth grinned bashfully and reached for Castiel’s coat stand. “Almost forgot my jacket.” He slung his sheepskin coat over his arm and smiled at Castiel. “Thanks for tonight. It really was nice to meet you.” And suddenly he had Castiel in a bear grip, hugging him for all his worth. A terrifying moment later (Castiel was just grateful they’d all put on their clothes again), Garth pulled away and patted Castiel on the shoulder. “We should do this again sometime.”
A habit that Gabe was forming was to rib Castiel on a twice-daily basis about Castiel’s civic duty to “climb Dean like a tree,” despite all of Castiel’s unamused, glowering silences and insistence that he was 99% sure that Dean was straight.
The drive back to their neighborhood was… awkward, to say the least. The moment he started the car, Castiel plugged in a cassette tape of Beethoven’s fifth symphony and cranked up the volume loud enough to discourage any kind of conversation. Castiel could feel Dean’s gaze burning a hole in the side of his head. It took all his willpower not to stare right back. By the time he pulled up in front of Dean’s house, the rain still coming down in sheets. He lowered the volume enough to speak.
yes sweet moses is a real thing in cleveland and if any of you are in the general vicinity i 100% recommend it looks so amazing and i feel daily pain about the fact that i can't go there and get a turtle sundae
“Hold on,” Dean murmured, his voice huskier than usual. He leaned over to the bedside table, his hair glowing white in the moonlight, and dug around in the drawer. With a small “huh” of victory, he pulled out a half-empty bottle of lube and a condom. Dean closed the drawer and wiggled back into place, his shit-eating grin wide. “Knew I’d have it.”
Castiel blinked awake on a lungful of freezing air, his bedroom thrown into a purple, ashy color from the light seeping in through his curtains. He mumbled a little, running a hand over his eyes and stubble before he snapped completely awake.
Castiel glared at the ceiling. He hated hospitals. He hated being injured. He especially hated meeting an extraordinarily beautiful person when a catheter was involved.
The ‘anxiety thing,’ as Dean put it, dominated the rest of Castiel’s day. He met his new personal psychologist, Dr. Shurley, who was a skittish hobbit-like man (“Just call me Chuck,” was the first thing he said to Castiel) but was also, according to Dean’s reply to Gabe’s inquiring text, a “freaking genius.” After Dean had clocked out with a promise to return later that evening, Castiel started to feel rather lonely, especially when Chuck asked Gabe to leave the room and come back around lunch time. Gabe obeyed, promising Castiel that he’d bring back something sweet.
The nurse gave him a sympathetic look. “Don’t worry. I get it.” She stopped at the doorway to the waiting room and gave his arm a squeeze. “Tell him Lisa said hey, and that he should definitely take you to Sweet Moses to celebrate.”
Dean laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners. Castiel was glad for this, for their easy bantering. A small part of him had been worried that Dean would react badly to finding out that Castiel wasn’t exactly straight, but nothing had changed. If anything, they were more comfortable around each other.
“S’what I’m good at,” Dean mumbled, followed by a long period of silence. Castiel guessed that Dean had fallen asleep, and tried his best to return his attention to Buddhist symbolism and its appearances in Eastern media. He felt the words dragging at his eyelids, the margins blurring his gaze, but he pressed forward, knowing that he couldn’t let himself fall asleep.
They stayed like that for the rest of the evening; Gabe didn’t even bother to ask them to help with the dishes, and soon Bastet was hopping up onto the couch next to Dean, lying down against his leg with a purr. Castiel didn’t try to read into their closeness, but he was dimly aware of the fact that he hadn’t been the one closing the distance, and then began to wonder if maybe Dean’s feelings weren’t all that platonic, either. Regardless, he settled sleepily into Dean’s side, awash in the way Dean smelled and felt against him, his cheek leaning against Dean’s shoulder, and when Dean didn’t move, he shut his eyes, utterly content.
He could hear Dean’s smirk. “Amen to that, man.” He finished off his piece of bread before asking, “So what’s the deal with your car? ‘Cause I know a really good guy down off Central Avenue who—”
The huge knock sounded again from the front door, followed by, “DAMMIT, CASTIEL, OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!”
“Sammy had bad nightmares when he was a kid. This was the only thing that helped.” Dean waited for Castiel to move, and when he didn’t, Dean sighed. “The least I can do is be here to wake you up before it gets really bad. That’s better than nothin’, isn’t it?”
Dean sat up instantly, almost spilling the rest of his chili as he half-threw his bowl onto the coffee table. Bastet jumped off his lap, indignant. “Is she okay?” he demanded of whoever was on the other line. “Where did they take her?”
He hadn’t really spoken to Dean since the snow-in, other than to reply to Dean’s quick text of: “home safe & sound. no pipes burst, lots of firewood, dont worry bout me.” But then the snow finished melting, the botched school week ended, and the weekend rolled around. It was nearing noon on the Sunday before Gabe’s departure the next day when Gabe decided to have an aneurysm about the NFL.
“I know.” Dean scrabbled for Castiel’s hands, both of them trembling. “This is it. This is happening. This is really happening.”
Castiel finally managed to make it into the bathroom, and he bent over a urinal in relief. The events of the last three weeks swam hazily in his mind, everything from the morning after Thanksgiving to the last day of classes….
Castiel laughed self-deprecatingly. “Um… When it gets packed. Kind of. Or, right before it really gets packed, when the top’s frozen over and it’s all crunchy, but if you crack the surface, it’s all soft and powdery underneath.” He shrugged, starting to blush. “The Inuit have dozens of different words for different kinds of snow. I’m much the same way, but only one type of snow is my favorite.”
When Michael was out of sight, Gabe whirled on Castiel, dragging him out of the doorway. “What are you thinking?!” he demanded in an exasperated whisper. “You know you can’t talk to him!”
“Whatever you say, Professor,” Dean replied. He turned back to his car, pulling open the back door and sliding Castiel’s satchel onto the seat. Then he reached forward and opened the passenger door, turning back to face Castiel. “You ready?”
Images of broken glass, dented metal, leaking brake fluid, and flashing red lights swirled through Castiel’s mind. “Yes,” he agreed. “Better.”
, absorbed in the tales and drama of a Northwestern baseball family, and one hand firmly attached to Bastet, who was lying blissed-out by his side. Castiel made it through two and a half short essays before Dean said:
“HEYYYY LIL’ BRO!” Gabe bounded into the room, looking entirely too energetic to be allowed in a hospital wing. He was at Castiel’s other side in an instant, and Dean barely had time to get the cup of water out of the way before Gabe hugged Castiel, squeezing him tightly.
Castiel paused for a moment, his grin too big to swallow as he leaned over Dean, their legs tangled together. Here, in the staggered, silver rays of moonlight, Dean looked more beautiful than he ever had before; his eyes fairly gleamed in the dark as he stared back at Castiel before the corner of his swollen mouth twitched and he said, “What?”
Garth hmmed and reached over, his long fingers plucking the CD player away from Dean and running over the player’s shiny plastic surface. He tried a few buttons, then popped open the battery compartment on the bottom.
“I, um, I thought—” Castiel cleared his throat. “You’ve got a lot of downtime during the night shift, so I thought that this might, I don’t know, be a nice soundtrack or something.”
Dean grinned. “Damn straight.” He glanced at his watch and half-frowned. “Listen, Cas, I gotta finish up my rounds, but are you good here?”
“I know, boss.” Hael went back to her desk and slid open one of the top drawers, pulling out a small stack of miscellaneous cat necessities, like cans of Fancy Feast and toys. “I’m basically a vet at this point.”
“Bullshit.” Gabe crowded into Michael’s space, forcing the taller man to take a grudging step back. “You know the rules. Call before you come into town, only speak to Cas in front of another family member—”
“He told me the story,” Dean said abruptly, his mouth getting a mind of its own. “Of the dream, I mean. He told me what happened.”
Dean peered down at the Visitor name tag on his shirt, picking at one of the corners. “Ten bucks says I’ll forget this is on my shirt and throw it in the washer just the same.”
Bobby took this all in with a nod. “Makes sense.” He nodded in the direction of what Castiel assumed was the kitchen. “Made sandwiches. Just grab what you want.”
Michael nodded once. “Dean, it was a pleasure,” he said, his voice dripping with disapproval and sarcasm, before he turned and went up the stairs, his pace measured and somehow intimidating.
At first, Castiel was inclined to ignore the knock at his front door, but when whoever it was persisted for several minutes, he rolled his eyes and answered it, his mouth dropping open in surprise when he saw who it was.
“Sounds good,” Castiel managed, unsteady on his crutches. “If, uh, it’s okay, I’m gonna…” He gestured behind himself and in the direction of the house.
Dean huffed, almost laughing. “Okay, okay…” He took the medicine and quickly tossed it back, grimacing at the taste.
Dean gave a single nod, his attention on the monitor as he typed something in. “I’ll get you some water.” A moment later, he closed the window on the computer but pulled out his phone, his thumbs quickly jabbing at the screen. Then, he went over to the sink and filled two paper cups with water, coming around to Castiel’s right side.
“Yeah, yeah.” Dean shouldered into the house and hugged Bobby. When Bobby pulled away, his beard twitched in what Castiel assumed was a smile as he glanced Dean over.
“Call it what you want, but I heard the snorin’.” Dean pressed a tiny paper cup into Castiel’s left hand and another cup of water into his right. “Here you go. Dose up.”
“I, um.” Castiel swallowed. He’d never told a stranger this before, but quickly discovered that he didn’t give two shits about telling Dean. “It was — I came to terms with my sexuality. And my parents’ opinions didn’t exactly . . . favor . . . the person I was.”
The next morning passed in much the same way it had the day before, but this time, Castiel made breakfast as Dean smiled at him from the couch, Castiel desperately wondering how he was going to make it through the end of the snowstorm without doing something stupid. He tried to keep his distance from Dean as the day continued, grading papers at the dining table instead of the couch and spending too much time puttering around in his basement organizing supplies that didn’t need to be reorganized.
Hael gently rubbed his arm. “But it’ll be a good thing for you to do. Healthy, even.” She hopped off her stool, surprisingly chipper. “Now. I’m going to drive you home and make you drink a very large glass of water before you really regret this little bar visit.”
Dean pushed Castiel back against the closed door, fisting his hand in Castiel’s shirt, pulling Castiel’s mouth against his own. Castiel whimpered, trying to pull Dean further over him, into him; both of them shucked their coats, scarves, hats. Castiel untucked Dean’s button-down from his pants, running his hands across the broad expanse of warm, soft skin that was Dean’s back; Dean groaned hot and heavy into Castiel’s mouth, his grip tightening on Castiel’s hips.
Gabe was already planning a menu, schmoozing the contacts he’d managed to make at the local farmer’s market for a small turkey, all the vegetables, and most of the ingredients for pie, even though everything was already presumably bought-out. When Castiel insisted that he be allowed to make his trademark apple pie, Gabe had put up a vehement protest, arguing that Castiel had to get as much rest as damned possible. But then Anna had stepped in and given Gabe one of her trademark death glares and the matter was settled: Castiel was going to make the pie, and Gabe was going to make the ice cream. And everything else.
The nurse — Dean — fished around in the pants pocket of his scrubs and pulled out his ID badge. He clipped it to the pocket of his shirt. “I always forget to put on the damn thing. Sammy tells me I leave half my brain back at my house, and sometimes I believe him.” He smiled then, something soft and gentle, and Castiel experienced an odd moment of disappointment mingling with jealousy.
Castiel had braced himself for the heat and humidity but it still hit him like a wall. He exhaled, squinting in the sudden sunshine. It was blinding; he could barely see a thing beyond the overhang of the hospital.
They both ducked their heads against the downpour and made their way to Castiel’s garage. Castiel keyed in the code to open the door and they both reached the car with a sigh of relief. Castiel unlocked the car and threw two towels across the bench seat, trying to cover the leather as best he could. “All right,” he said to Dean. “Get in.” Castiel settled behind the wheel, his wet shoes squeaking against the pedals.
He’d always had a certain fondness for ducks, probably something to do with how they seemed so serene and content to just paddle for hours on end. And they never minded stale bread.
The past week-or-so had been in equal parts wonderful and tortuous. Castiel was becoming so used to Dean’s presence that Monday had been somewhat of a shock, when Dean was back at work and only stopping by on his way home to make sure Castiel was still eating on a somewhat-normal basis and taking his meds. Once again, Castiel was forced tofully come to terms with his solitude within the big city, and every time he had an inkling to maybe pound the streets and seek out the most hipster coffee shop he could find, he would remember the bruises under his arms and how he tried to use his crutches as little as possible. But, today was Sunday, and it was Dean’s day off, and, for some unfathomable reason, he’d chosen to spend it by making lunch for Castiel and wait with him until Castiel’s new Rambler came up the street. Castiel thunked his head against the cabinet twice more for good measure.
The first thing Castiel was aware of was being thirsty. He mumbled a little, his tongue thick in his mouth, the skin above his right eyebrow itching and, a moment later, aching. But he felt… softness, mostly. His limbs were heavy and stiff, but he felt the whisper of woven fabric against his skin, the firmness of a mattress under his legs and against his back, and a point of discomfort in the crook of his left elbow. He slowly blinked awake, the room in front of him coming into focus.
Castiel frowned and mimicked Dean, swiping a thumb along the edge of his bottom lip. A ridiculous amount of whipped cream came away, and he smiled as he licked it off. “Thanks.”
“Probably a smarter decision than the one I made.” Castiel hauled himself off his stool, feeling the world tilt around him. “I’m already regretting this.” He handed her the keys.
Dean sent him a hesitant smile before clapping his hands together. “Now. When’re you gonna let me take a Sharpie to that thing?”
Gabe scoffed and waved a patronizing hand at him. “If I didn’t love it, I wouldn’t be doing it for a living.”
Castiel tried to lift his arm to grab the cup, frowning when his hand only twitched. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught the way Dean’s mouth quirked up before Dean said, “Here. I’ll get you a straw.” He pulled open one of the drawers in Castiel’s bedside table and pulled out a paper-wrapped straw, quickly unwrapping it and dunking it into one of the cups. As he lifted the cup towards Castiel, he looked into Castiel’s face, and only then did Castiel see that Dean’s eyes were tight with worry and ringed with exhaustion.
He was five minutes away from home, from the blissful ‘maybe’ of a few hours of dreamless sleep, when the dizziness hit, potentially worse than it had ever been before. Castiel’s heart rate picked up exponentially and his mouth went dry; forcing himself to stay calm, he bent forward until his forehead was resting on his knees, silently praying for it to stop by the time the car arrived at his house.
“I realized that there were other religions out there. And, upon exploring them, I discovered that some of those religions offered truths that were more appealing to me than those of the Christian God. I never really regained my faith, but it was an enlightening experience.” Castiel shrugged. “I also tried looking on the Bible as a work of literature instead of a book of judgment, and then it became terribly engrossing. I’ve read it at least a dozen times.”
But, he had to admit, it did make the abominable wallpaper of his hospital room a little softer on the eye.
Their dinner was slow and comfortable; they ate off their laps sitting around the fire, which was warm and blazing against the cold. Castiel had to redouble his efforts to not look at Dean too often, to watch the way the light played against Dean’s freckled skin as he joked with his brother. Then, at some point, Dean threw a pack of playing cards at Castiel’s head and said, “C’mon. Why don’t you teach us some whist?”
It took about another hour for the crowds to die out in earnest. It was nearing nine o’clock when there came Dean’s usual knock at the door. Castiel opened it with a grin, which faded when he saw Dean up-close.
“Don’t be embarrassed,” Dean told him, reading Castiel’s expression correctly. “Happens all the time.”
As Castiel lay in bed that night, exhausted but waiting for sleep, he blinked in the dim moonlight filtering in through his windows, looking at the Western movie posters on the walls, wrapped in the warm, recognizable scent of Dean’s sheets, and reached for the tiny hand-carved wooden horse sitting on the bedside table. He traced the worn contours of the mane and imagined Dean’s ten year-old hands doing the same, realizing how far gone he really was.
After sitting in silence for a few minutes, Dean muttered, “All right. That’s it. I’m done.” He stood up unsteadily and wandered over to the couch, sitting down with a groan.
, and he was all tousled and unshaven and so goddamn—I have no idea how I didn’t jump his bones every—”
Christmas Eve morning arrived sleepily, and Castiel woke early enough to catch Bobby nudging a few presents under the brightly-lit tree. The couch was empty, meaning that Dean was presumably in the bathroom upstairs. Castiel leaned against the doorway to the living room, carefully keeping his arms behind his back, and smiled. “Good morning, Santa.”
As Dean and Castiel scrambled around the house trying to get all of their supplies together, neither of them could stop grinning, already overjoyed at the idea of finally getting to meet their new daughter. After six months of friendship, a year of being together, three months of being engaged, and two years of being married, they were ready for the rest of it, ready to build the dash between the years of their births and deaths, and ready to do it together.
Dean nodded. “Yeah. I can get you there.” He ran a hesitant finger along the top of Bastet’s head and she let out a little mew in response. “Why did you do the thing with the towels?”
“Cas!” Alarmed, Dean reached for Castiel’s hands, wrapping an arm around his back. “What’s goin’ on?!?”
Castiel was discharged from the hospital the following afternoon after his second session with Dr. Shurley, riding the high of his new glucocorticoid prescription. Since it was the week of (and actually the day before) Thanksgiving, Gabe had insisted on staying with him through Sunday, Anna quickly following suit once she got the all-clear from her editor. Castiel wasn’t thrilled that he’d had to miss three days of school (Oberlin only had Thursday through Sunday off), but glad all the same that he was going to spend the holiday with his siblings, something he hadn’t done in years.
After spending three hours building his course and another hour fruitlessly trying to take a nap, Castiel had given up on staying inside, grabbed a bag of last week’s bread, and sent a quick text. While the walk to the park had been a lot less enjoyable with crutches involved (Castiel swore he could feel new bruises growing under his armpits every time he took a step), Castiel was glad for the sunshine, even if the day was unbearably warm.
Bobby grunted. “Yeah, but traditions seem to hold in this family.” He turned to Castiel with a twitch of his beard. “Goodnight, you two. Don’t stay up too late.”
Castiel scoffed and bit a piece of bacon in half. “All right. Let’s pretend that I full-on Florence-Nightingaled you instead of just handing you a couple of pills.”
. He didn’t understand what line they were dancing on, if Dean might’ve liked him back (which he probably didn’t) or, if he
Castiel starting to smile back. “That’s a very good kind.” Dean pushed open his front door, put the box down on his entry mat, and took off his snowshoes, and, feeling the impending goodbye, Castiel added, “I’ve never had a snowball fight.”
Dean raised his eyebrows, taking in the bubbling student population: the debates about Chaucer, the to-scale model rockets perched to take off, the lazy frisbee game dominating the top corner of the grass. “It ain’t half bad.” He threw Castiel a quick smirk. “They got auto shop?”
Castiel sat down on the other end of the couch and calmly cleared his throat. “If you say something like that about yourself again, you can forget about ever having my apple pie.”
The cup empty, Castiel released the straw and let out his own sigh, feeling much more awake. “Sorry.”
The ride home was quick, the streetlights gleaming under the overcast sky. The rain from the previous weekend had softened to a drizzle by Monday, but the thick layer of purplish clouds had continued to lean on the city like an unwanted elbow pressed against a shoulder. “Home sweet home,” Castiel said to Bastet as he carefully carried her through the damp garden and in through the back door.
The nurse grinned. “That’s good. I didn’t think there would be — you healed really well.” She swept the remaining bits and pieces of his cast into her hand and likewise tossed them into the garbage. “You got a ride home?”
“Well, I broke my foot and got a few scrapes, but everything healed the way it was supposed to.” He smiled as she directed him to a half-glass-half-wood door labeled
“No, of course. Come in.” He capped his pen and pushed his draft aside, gesturing to the small table in the corner. Agnes. That was her name. “What did you have a question about?” He sat down at the table.
He snorted. “I doubt I’m in any fit mental state to tackle a book, so yes, some television sounds like an excellent option.”
“That’s ‘cause you are, Cas.” Dean finished the last line on Marvin’s hat before capping the Sharpie and lifting his expectant gaze to Castiel’s. “All right. Where’re the bandages?”
“Yeah, sure. Next thing you’ll be tellin’ me that you’ve harbored a secret crush for Clint Barton since you were twelve.”
Time carried on, and Castiel began to enjoy himself more and more as the days passed. Not only was his department (mostly) made up of talented individuals who came to their first departmental meeting with positive attitudes, but his students were vocal, passionate, and very good workers. Soon, Castiel was swamped, and he had to schedule his days down to the half-hour to allow for enough time to work on his book, grade his class’ assignments, outline his next paper, and flesh out lesson plans for the coming week.
Dean gave Castiel a shit-eating grin and popped open the lid of one container. Steam burst out of a large pile of orange noodles garnished with a variety of lettuce, onions, and bean sprouts. Bastet licked her lips. Dean began shoveling the noodles onto one plate, creating an ample portion, before repeating the process with the other container.
“Oh.” Dean performed an odd shuffling movement, and a moment later, a corner of the duvet fell away to reveal that he was holding Bastet snugly against his chest. “She’s fine.”
Castiel spent the rest of Wednesday taking Anna on a tour of the city (Gabe obligingly drove), frowning for Gabe’s Instagrams (“They’re eating this shit up,” Gabe had chuckled as he snapped a photo of Castiel squinting into the camera), offering Anna feedback on her current project (“I’ve done three fantasy novels in a row now,” she said, shaking her head. “What I wouldn’t give for a good crime novel.”), and not-so-casually waiting for the time when Dean would stop by on his way to the hospital. On Wednesday, he caught the Novaks beginning a game of whist.
Hael bit her lip and shook her head, quickly checking her email before scooting away from the desk and joining Bastet on the carpet, where she received a welcome series of headbutts and a loud purr. Smiling, Hael scratched under Bastet’s chin, and a moment later, her phone pinged with a response:
“I’m not about to let you take a cab, ‘specially after you’ve been in a freakin’ car accident.” Dean met Castiel’s gaze and shook his head. “Listen, you don’t know anyone here yet, and you need some help.” He shrugged. “I’m a nurse. I like helpin’ people.”
Gabe grinned a little. “Yeah, that’s what I thought.” He opened the freezer and tossed the peas back in. “But he thinks you’re straight, Dean. Like, really really
The vet smiled at them both. “Luckily, she didn’t have any internal injuries. It seems that she tried to duck under the car and just got clipped by the bumper, which means there was less of an impact. We easily stitched up the cut on her side, but she does have a broken leg. We’ll cast her up before we put her down for the night. She’s going to be in the cast for at least four weeks.”
“No kiddin’.” Dean looked somewhat impressed, and Castiel awarded himself a point in the category of (hopefully) getting Dean to be friends with Hael.
“Of course,” Dean assured him, feeling an unhelpful little flutter in his belly. He reeled off his phone number for Gabe, and a moment later, heard his own phone
“Hot damn,” Dean mumbled close to Castiel’s ear. “You didn’t tell me that they were all obsessed with you.”
“Okay, Dean,” Castiel said around a laugh as Bastet leaned over his face to sniff his bandage, “I’ll keep the beard.” He nuzzled Bastet for another moment before she settled down in his lap, purring loudly. “How did you manage to get her in here?”
“Well yeah, I raised him. And I’m the awesomest dude around.” Dean replaced Castiel’s chart and eyed Castiel’s tray. “What, you’re not gonna eat the pudding?”
He’d fought his hardest when it came to falling asleep that night, barely managing to make it through a handful of crackers and cheese for his dinner (the idea and scent of food had made him gag). When Dean had called him with a “Hey, Cas, how you doin’?” he’d replied with a hasty “Fine,” and said goodbye as quickly as he could, even though he could hear the way he was snubbing Dean, probably hurting him. But, he’d only managed to stay awake for over twenty-four hours very few times in his life, and he’d fallen asleep as he was sitting on his bed going through his notes, ripped awake by the dream not three hours later.
The nurse shook his head and finished adding something to Castiel’s chart. “I really hate people sometimes.”
“Dean, if you don’t calm down, you’re going to give yourself a stroke.” Castiel rubbed Dean’s tense arm placatingly. “There’s nothing to worry about!”
Just as Castiel was about to drop off, he remembered the light on by the couch, the duvet he’d left to be unfolded and slept under.
Gabe gave him a smile that didn’t have any real heart in it. “Well, that’s what happens when you don’t sleep for the better part of two weeks. You needed to catch up.” He reached up and brushed some hair away from Castiel’s forehead, his fingers scraping something rough that Castiel realized was the bandage. “And to top it all off, you gave yourself a concussion.”
Castiel slowly opened his eyes to the black fabric of his trousers, his stomach lurching unhelpfully. When he didn’t move right away, the driver added, “Boss? Y’okay back there?”
“Oh.” Dean relaxed again, his mouth curling into a small, pleased smile. “That’s… that’s nice.” His grip tightened on Castiel’s hand and his thumb stroked the edge of Castiel’s palm.
They were quiet after that, and Castiel slowly felt himself drifting further and further towards the edge of sleep,
“I think I’m gonna head up to bed,” Sam said as he stretched, reminding Castiel of a sleepy golden retriever.
“OW!” Castiel backed away, going around to the other side of the table so there was some space between them, completely bemused by Dean’s behavior. “How was I being—?”
“At least you have your pants,” Kevin said with remarkable eloquence for someone at his level of intoxication. He was sitting in just his boxers, arms pressed up against his sides.
Castiel huffed and blushed a little; he resisted the urge to reach up and tug at the collar of his t-shirt.
Castiel shivered as they stepped out of the back door and into the freezing air. Dean glanced up at the sky. “I think it’ll actually snow tonight. ‘Bout damn time.”
boring.” She reached for the doorknob and pushed open the door, revealing her small office area, quaint and decorated with a variety of crocheted accessories and small indoor plants. The window on the far wall looked down on the sunny, teeming quad. “Does your foot hurt when it rains?”
Castiel’s heart rate picked up and he swallowed thickly, reaching up to undo another button on his shirt. Bastet opened her eyes and peered at him questioningly. “What?” he asked her. “You’re the one who got me into this mess in the first place.”
“And how’d the new Theology Professor wind up in a car accident?” The nurse lowered the chart to make eye contact with Castiel, whose heart leapt into his throat because holy
Dean let out a sigh and dragged his forearm across his forehead, wiping away the sweat as his wife beater rode up and exposed an indecent amount of abdomen. “We’re in the home stretch, Cas.” His grin was genuine but tired. “Give me another half-hour or so and she’ll be ready.”
“Say what you like,” Gabe had said after one such protest, his eye scanning the list of ingredients on a bag of locally-made wheat flour, “but you didn’t see the way he was looking at you.”
Castiel hurriedly closed the door, slipping on the snow that had melted into his floorboards before stepping into the living room. “Gabe, this is my neighbor and good friend Dean.” He avoided Dean’s gaze as he continued: “Dean, this is my brother Gabriel. He owns a bakery out in California and makes lots of different kinds of pastry and he kind of has this girlfriend named Kali but they’ve never really—”
Dean pulled out of the hug but held his brother at arm’s length. “You need to stop growin’,” he said shrewdly. “I’m supposed to be the tall one here.” He gave Sam an appraising look. “Hey, you asked out that girl yet? What was her name? Jennifer?”
“Cas, I—” Dean’s hand was at his shoulder, turning him back around. “That wasn’t what I meant, okay?! I didn’t mean it!”
Dean shifted, seemingly uncomfortable. “Are, uh, y’know.” He cleared his throat quickly. “You datin’ anybody?”
“I can see that,” Garth replied, and a moment later, there was a bit of a click. He grinned in triumph, closed the battery compartment, and tried the ON switch again. This time, the little screen lit up in response, and he let out a pleased whistle as he tossed the player back to Dean. “Fixed it.”
..... don't murder me, please? after the next chapter, i promise that you'll get your vicarious smoochies ;)
Dean whistled when he saw Castiel’s dining table, which was laid out and decked to the nines. “Someone got fancy.”
Gabe chuckled at him. “Yeah. You can’t be one of the best bakers in LA without a decent social media platform. And everyone loooooves you.”
Secretly amused at Dean’s closeted fondness for the game, Castiel dealt the cards and started explaining how the game worked to Sam and Bobby. Soon, they were proving to be a very efficient team against Dean and Castiel, who struggled to keep up but had fun nonetheless. The minutes bled into hours as they played and laughed and kept tally of how many games each team had won (Bobby and Sam were definitely in the lead), and soon, the old clock above the mantelpiece was chiming ten and Sam was yawning.
“Unfortunately, yeah.” Dean sighed a little. “I don’t think he’s gotten a proper night’s sleep in a very long time.”
Dean’s eyebrows flickered upwards. “All right, Castiel it is. This is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna give you your next dose of meds so you can breathe OK and get some sleep. You’ve had a long day and tomorrow’s going to be rough as well, so sleep’s gonna be your best friend. If you even try to protest, I’m draggin’ your orthopod in here so she can scream at you herself.”
Castiel had to politely shove past a number of people on his way back to Dean, fingers damp from the sub-par hand dryers in the bathroom. He found Dean staring nervously up at the board that gave their departure time, his leg jiggling up and down. “You okay?” Castiel asked him as he sat in the chair next to Dean.
Anna grinned at the photo, then at the two love-struck idiots asleep on the couch, a blanket thrown over them. “Nope.”
“There isn’t any pain, if that’s what you mean.” Castiel gently shifted around, remembering Dean’s advice about taking it easy.
Gabriel was smirking, one eyebrow lifted as he ran a hand down Bastet’s back. “So, Cassie. We have a lot of catching up to do.”
Castiel put down his fork, the piece of pancake in his mouth suddenly feeling very dry. He swallowed roughly. “I’m just going to have the desk call me a cab.”
, and before he could even second-guess himself, he was closing the distance between them and pressing his mouth to Dean’s.
“I know. I used to make ‘em for Sammy.” Dean’s gaze lingered on Castiel before he returned his attention to the pan. “But I don’t think he ever had quite the same reaction.”
“Cafeteria food isn’t Pad Thai,” Dean clarified as he grabbed his own portion and dug in. He moaned a little and Castiel tried his best not to stare. “It definitely isn’t Pad Thai.”
“Hael, you are a goddess.” Castiel haphazardly tried to gather everything into his briefcase, almost dropping the handouts in the process. “Goddamn!”
“Nope,” Castiel affirmed, already used to the drill of changing his dressing. “How was the night shift?”
Dean tched and reached for the pile of cards. “Man. You weren’t kiddin’ when you said this was your game.”
Castiel almost smiled. “All right.” He watched his brother flop down on the couch, pull Bastet into his lap, and switch on the TV, even though the game didn’t start for another hour. Somewhat befuddled, Castiel pulled out his phone and started a new text.
“Quite,” Castiel replied, gathering up the cards and putting them back in their box. “What do you want to do now?”
“Nag, nag, nag…” Castiel bent down to pick up his briefcase and pulled the strap of Bastet’s carrier over his shoulder (it was one of the fancy carriers with screened sides, a zip-up top, and a carrying strap); Bastet gave him a cheerful but sleepy meow as she swung against his hip. “Right,” he said, his keys in his free hand. “Let’s go.”
Castiel clapped him on the shoulder and led him out of the Administrative Center. “Ten bucks it is. I’m just glad you didn’t get syrup on your tie.” Dean snorted but didn’t deny it. “So.” Castiel stopped on the edge of the quad, which was shining benignly in the weak sunshine. “What do you think?”
Dean considered, putting down both of his mugs and reaching for his plate. “Definitely better’n last night, thanks to you.”
“Hael.” Castiel took a steadying breath and deeply regretted the amount of alcohol in his system. He really didn’t have much of a tolerance. “I can’t just—”
Castiel pulled out into the street. “Makes cleanup easier.” He glanced at Dean. “Speaking of, you’re toweling off the second she’s out of your hands. We can’t have you getting pneumonia.”
He’d taken a shallow, wide oval basket that he’d had since he’d found out about his acceptance to Harvard's grad program (Gabe had had an especially eccentric taste in celebratory gift baskets), and lined it with an old duvet folded thrice. When he popped open the latch on her carrier, Bastet tried to crawl out, her ears perking up in excitement. He gently slid a hand under her stomach and lifted her up, laying her in the basket and making sure her cone was properly fastened. Pulling off his trench, undoing the top button of his shirt, and tugging his tie a little looser (he’d gone to the vet straight from school), Castiel sat down on the floor in front of her.
No response. Castiel checked his phone again a minute later, but he hadn’t missed a text. He started to frown, wondering what kind of signal this was, when a sudden, sharp knock sounded at his front door. Grinning, he opened it to reveal a boyishly excited Dean, who shot him a quick, “Hey Cas, how ya doin’?” before handing him a large bag of chips (which, Castiel guessed, was their lunch), tossing off his coat, and heading for the couch. Gabe greeted him with a cheer and a hand-slap thing before they settled into Sports Center, starting a discussion of the two teams and automatically spreading Bastet between both of them so they could each get a good handful of tummy fur.
Dean grinned. “And that’s what I thought you’d say.” He turned onto West 25th. “Let’s get you to Dave’s.”
“You’re talking to a guy whose teenage years consisted of exploring Confucianism and collecting comics.” Castiel shook his head. “Besides, it was pretty conservative where I lived. I couldn’t
Castiel nodded as the door to the garage pulled up. “She stays in my office. Hael watches her while I’m in class.” He shrugged and opened the car, carefully sliding Bastet into the backseat. “It’s easier that way.”
Dean pulled away a few moments later with a restrained gasp. “Hey,” he murmured, hooking a leg behind Castiel’s knee. “Lemme join the party a little.”
Castiel’s entire frame seemed to stutter at her words, and he reluctantly reached forward to take the French roll, which he held with the tips of his fingers as if it were a piece of dung. “Thank you,” he said with another attempt at a smile before shuffling into his office.
“Castiel.” Michael gave him a grim little smirk, as poised and polished as ever, his suit tailored within an inch of its life. “How… lovely to see you.”
“Honestly, Dean, what did you expect?” Sam sat back in his armchair. “I’ve never seen more pining before in my life, and I spend my time with nerds.”
? A man after my own heart.” Wide, careful hands reached for Castiel’s chart. “How you feelin’ there, Dr. Novak?”
Castiel retrieved another two acetaminophen from the bottle and refilled Dean’s glass, pleased to see water come splashing out of the bathroom tap; it looked like getting that extra insulation for his pipes had really paid off. He went back upstairs, hesitating as he stood over Dean’s slumbering form, loathe to wake him up but knowing that he had to. Castiel put the pills and glass down on the bedside table and reached for Dean, gently shaking his arm.
“Well, if you’re not careful, it’s gonna get offended and turn itself off. And then we’ll really be screwed.”
Gabe’s laugh sounded a tad forced, his eyes betraying his concern. “Listen, Cas… What’s going on? I know that when I left, things weren’t, y’know, a hundred percent okay, but I had no idea they were bad enough to land you in here.”
Castiel gulped, feeling that they were veering into dangerous territory. Snuggling territory. Emotional-attachment territory. This would break all of the rules he had set for himself. “I…”
Dean sighed into his malt. “Goddamn it, Cas.” He sat in silence for a moment, toying with his straw wrapper. “Y’know what?” he said suddenly. “We should celebrate.”
thank you so much for all your support and lovely comments :3 you're all wonderful! thank you for reading!! <3
Dean scooped out the last of his oatmeal. “We certainly did.” He finished it off in one big bite, hardly a moment passing before he was sending Castiel’s mug covetous looks. Smiling, Castiel handed over his half-finished oatmeal without a word. Dean grinned at him before polishing off the oatmeal in three large bites.
“I get it,” Gabe snapped. “And when were you going to pay me a little visit? Or Anna? We have company stock too, as you know.”
“Cinnamon and nutmeg,” Castiel replied. “Just because we’re snowed-in doesn’t mean we can’t eat like civilized people.”
“Don’t bother, Cas,” Gabe replied, coming into the room behind him and pulling the door almost-closed behind him.
Castiel nodded. “I was never allowed, and Gabe got in trouble for playing in the snow, so I never tried. And I just sort of forgot about it during college.”
“Yes. I’m actually very good at making pies.” Castiel swung a small bag of potatoes into the cart before using his crutches to continue down the aisle. “My apple pie actually won a local competition back in the day.”
“Suprabhaat, shikshak,” they all chanted in reply (well, everyone except Dean, who was looking thoroughly bemused).
Castiel groaned and massaged his temples, his elbows propped up on his various notebooks and Bibles. “I’m so sick of Jesus.”
Dean shook his head as he smiled down at the frying pan. “I need to start writin’ down these quotes of yours. Outta context, they sound pretty damn weird.” He flipped the grilled cheese onto its uncooked side, the butter hitting the hot pan with a sizzle. “You can’t work on that all the time, you know. You gotta take breaks. You’re still in recovery, for cryin’ out loud.”
With a final wave, Garth tucked himself into his car and designated-drove Meg and Kevin away. Castiel watched them go with an easy complacent smile, wondering if he would see them again. A foreign part of him wanted it to happen sooner rather than later.
now that i'm not in endless tech weeks anymore and got into college, i have a lot more time on my hands :) so updates should be happening more frequently. i don't really have a ballpark for how many chapters are left, but i do know the story arc. i'm not one for super long fics, though, so i don't imagine this going over 20/22 chapters. at most.
Dean laughed openly. “Hoo boy, I’m glad I’m not on the receivin’ end of that look. Talk about daggers.” He leaned closer to Castiel and whispered, “Don’t tell anyone, but
“Gabe, it’s fine.” Castiel wished his voice would stop shaking. “It’s only for a few minutes. I probably just have to sign some papers.” He didn’t even sound convincing to himself.
Eventually, when Castiel’s skin became too hypersensitive, and he felt like everything was too much, almost overwhelming, he bit his lip and wrapped his fist around Dean’s cock, bracing his weight against his other arm and gazing into Dean’s eyes. He increased his pace steadily, keeping eye contact, getting lost in the dark green of Dean’s gaze.
“No,” Castiel, mumbled, his eyes beginning to close. “It’s good that I did.” The last thing he was aware of was being warm, and being held, and he thought that maybe this was better than being alone, this was better than an empty bed.
“I’m bi,” Dean said like he was explaining something to a petulant three year-old. “And I was a very closeted teenager. Cas, I’ve had a crush on you since the moment I met you.” He gave a one-shouldered shrug. “Details.”
“Good,” Castiel mumbled to himself before turning to his chest of drawers and pulling out a shirt and a pair of pajama pants. He went back out into the hallway and quickly stripped out of his Batman costume, reaching around the doorway of the bathroom to throw it into the hamper, before he changed into his other clothes. He made sure to grab an extra pillow and duvet from his linens cupboard, and when he went back downstairs, he gently tossed them onto one end of the couch. Then, he performed his usual closing-up routine, wiping down the kitchen and making sure all the doors and windows were locked. He turned out all of the lights except for the one next to the couch and tucked Bastet into his arms, gently carrying her upstairs with him. Now that her stitches were out and her cone was off, she was more of her old self, but he was still wary of letting her walk around on her own with the cast on. He turned out his hall light before quietly going into his bedroom, where Dean was still a thickly-breathing lump under his duvet.
Dean was quiet for a moment before he said: “All right. You. Me. Next snowfall. We’re havin’ a snowball fight.”
Dean grinned and ducked his head, looking for a moment like the most sheepish ten year-old in the world. “It’s okay. They’re long movies, and it’s gettin’ late.”
Suffice to say, Castiel and Dean didn’t speak to each other for a while after that, both of them too embarrassed to address the nature of the photo.
“So,” he summed up, “that’s why I’m here. Drowning my so-called sorrows.” He gave a self-deprecating laugh and raised his glass. “Pathetic, isn’t it?”
Accordingly, when the end of Castiel’s class approached, Hael carefully shut Bastet in and headed for the cafeteria, putting together a tray that she thought covered all the bases: garden salad with vinaigrette, some pasta marinara, a small French roll, and a fresh apple. She took it back to his office, ready to ambush him when he reappeared, guessing that if Dean’s intuition was anything to go off, Castiel wouldn’t be heading to lunch.
“One,” Castiel replied, “your welcome can never be overstayed. Two: tomorrow night, at the earliest. But probably more like Monday, Tuesday if it really sets in.”
Castiel dropped his gaze and didn’t reply. He was saved when Dean and the doctor came in a moment later, or thought he was until the doctor started talking. She introduced herself as Dr. Barnes and started walking him through what had happened, asking him a dozen questions about why he’d deprived himself of sleep and food, forcing himself to stay awake. He tiptoed around the answers, shrinking away from Gabe and avoiding Dean’s gaze, but eventually gave in to her ceaseless prodding and told her about the nightmares that had plagued him since he was young, and how the new nightmares had been triggered by the appearance of his eldest brother. He explained that he’d taken whatever measures necessary to avoid going to sleep, or to make himself so tired that when he did sleep he wouldn’t dream; the one thing he didn’t have an answer for was why food had become so repellent to him. Dr. Barnes listened with interest, taking detailed notes, and eventually asked him the inevitable question: “Why did Michael’s visit trigger these nightmares? Did he have a significant role in your childhood?”
“I second that.” Anna was already halfway through her slice and still going strong. “This is gonna be the death of me, I swear.”
in a supposed celebration of Gabe’s last night in town (Dean silently sent a prayer of thanks to the drive-in’s manager for liking Gene Kelly); Gabe was thrilled that he and the title character shared a name. Castiel’s mood hadn’t changed; he’d been quiet for the entire afternoon and evening, replying to all of their questions in simple phrases and always seeming to have his mind somewhere else, even as he fed the ducks and worked his way through a vanilla malt. Dean and Gabe had hastily tried to make up for it, Dean asking as many questions as he could think of about pastry-making and restaurant-managing, Gabe doing the same for nursing and car-rebuilding. If Castiel noticed that anything was off or awkward, he gave no indication of it.
Castiel lurched awake mid-scream, his limbs on fire and his stomach eating itself alive. He fell out of bed, the room spinning around him, and dragged himself to the bathroom in time to pull open the lid of the toilet and heave, the sparse contents of his dinner splashing into the pristine white bowl. He groaned, his head splitting and his body trembling from the all-consuming fear, before vomiting again, even though there was nothing more for him to throw up. But his stomach refused to calm down, and his groans became sobs as he dry-heaved, again and again, until finally, his stomach had had enough, and he was able to flush the toilet and take a ragged gulp of air. His limbs gave out and he splayed across the bathroom floor, shaking violently and barely able to breathe through a flood of anxious tears and the thick hammering of his heart.
“To go to a drive-in or to neck in the backseat? Ohhhh.” Dean grinned as Castiel’s blush deepened. “Can’t believe you’ve never necked in the backseat. That’s like a teenage rite of passage.”
Dean chuckled. “Yeah. Isn’t that the term?” He cupped the side of Castiel’s neck and slowly ran his thumb along Castiel’s jaw, his pupils widening as he did so.
Raj’s gaze quickly darted to Dean, who was in the process of stepping aside and throwing his trash away. “Who’s—?”
“You should finish it.” Castiel tried to take a steadying breath. “You’re so close to the end, and I think that you’ll really really really like the end.”
“Hmmm.” Dean sucked up another mouthful of pasta. “It’s gonna get cold. And don’t tell me that I spent an hour and a half slavin’ over this for nothin’.”
“Dean called me the second you got to the hospital. Dude was almost crying.” Gabe noticed Castiel’s reaction and hastily added, “Shit. Shouldn’t have said that. Anyhow. I left the bakery with my manager and my food truck with my sous chef and came running.” He gave Castiel’s shoulder a squeeze. “You’ve been out for a while, buddy.”
She smiled. It was small, but endearing. “That’s because you’re riding the high of Tylenol Number Three. But you’d say you’re feeling better than you were this afternoon, wouldn’t you?”
“Only three percent. For each of you.” The corner of Michael’s mouth twisted in some sick satisfaction. “Meaning you’ll have seven percent of the stock instead of ten.”
Castiel reached for Dean’s corduroys, his fingers fumbling against the zipper in his eagerness. Dean huffed a breathless chuckle and slid his hands over Castiel’s, popping open the button and pulling down the zipper; they exchanged sheepish, almost bashful grins as Dean hoisted himself ungracefully off the mattress to tug off his pants. Castiel went quiet at the sight of Dean’s tented boxers, forgetting to draw breath and his focus becoming a lot sharper. Moments later, all of their other clothes were in a pile on the floor, Castiel fervently admiring Dean’s golden skin in the milky half-light, his hands skimming over Dean’s shoulders and arms and chest almost of their own accord.
Warm, insistent hands grabbed Castiel’s arms and shook him gently but purposefully and a voice was saying, “Cas. Cas. Wake up. C’mon, Cas, you gotta wake up.”
Garth shrugged loosely. “One of your batteries was loose. That’s all.” He smiled at Dean’s indignant expression before adding, “Hey, why do you have a CD player? I’ve only ever seen you listen to tapes on that Walkman of yours.”
“One, her carrier looks like a gym bag, and two, it’s helpful to be on personal terms with your RN.” Gabe grinned and began pulling out plastic cutlery.
“I’m down,” Dean said with a grin, reaching for another pig-in-a-blanket. “S’better than drawin’ pictures.”
“Look, I…” Dean seemed to chew over his words before he figured out how to say them. “I’d never told anyone about… what happened to me. The whole why-I-became-a-nurse thing. I mean, yeah, my brother and Bobby know because they’re my family, but none of my friends know. Except for you.” He swallowed thickly, staring at Castiel. “I was an asshole. I know. What I said was a dick thing of me to say. But I couldn’t handle it, okay? I didn’t know how to handle the fact that you knew the truth about me. So I bolted.” He held out his arms in defeat. “I’m sorry, Cas. I’m sorry.”
“No,” Dean murmured in reply, one of his eyes cracking open. With his mussed hair and half-asleep expression, he was more adorable than usual. Castiel could’ve sworn that his heart dropped into his stomach. “‘m good. But thank you. Thank you so much.”
They ate in the dining room, which seemed to be entirely carved out of dark oak. Castiel devoured his burger, much to the amusement of the others, and Dean had laughed as he’d nudged a napkin under Castiel’s chin. “Slow down there, Cas.” Dean smiled a smile reminiscent of James Dean and Castiel felt his heart drop into his stomach.
Dean let out a long sigh and his breathing evened out as he fell into a deep sleep. Castiel lay awake for several minutes, desperately trying to calm down while reveling in their closeness, in how warm it was under the duvet compared to the chill of the air around them. He loved the way Dean felt pressed against him, unable to ignore the way their bodies fit together so seamlessly in this weird little maze of slumber. He lost himself in the sensation of the way Dean’s shins and knees pressed into his, the way it felt to have Dean breathing so close and so sincerely against his shoulder, and soon, he found himself falling asleep.
But Dean kept a firm grip on it. “Oh, yes!” He flipped to a new page and broke into another burst of laughter. “Is—are you serving tea?! In a little tux?!”
“Right?” Dean grinned around his glass before draining it completely. “Good times.” He put his empty glass down on the coffee table. “All right. I’d better get goin’.” Dean stood up and headed for the front door. Castiel inhaled slowly and accepted the silent dismissal. He stood up as well, and frowned when he saw Dean staring in fascination at his coat, which was suddenly two sizes too big.
“This sucks,” Meg proclaimed some twenty minutes later, tossing her pencil onto the coffee table. She and Castiel were losing 9-21 to Dean and Garth. “I think it’s time for strip poker.”
“Asshat,” Castiel wheezed, swatting at Dean, who began sucking at Castiel’s cock again in earnest. Covering his mouth with his hand to try and quiet himself, soon Castiel was shaking with the effort of holding himself together, biting down on the flesh of his fist. He knew he wasn’t going to last long, and it only took a minute before he felt himself nearing the edge.
He went downstairs quietly, shivering and almost kicking the wall when he turned the thermostat and didn’t hear the little click that usually indicated that the heating was coming on. So they had lost the electricity, which he confirmed a moment later when he stepped into the living room and noticed that the light he’d left on the night before was off. “Well,” he said aloud. “This ought to be fun.”
Dean let out a quick exhale. “Good,” he said, sounding like he meant it. “You had me worried there.”
” Castiel winced at his volume and grabbed his coat from where it was slung on the back of the armchair. “I’ll just run down to the basement for some more food.” Still avoiding Dean’s gaze, he quickly turned into the hallway, pulled on his coat, and opened the basement door.
“—and you don’t know a damn person in this city,” Dean continued as if Castiel had never interjected. He shook his head. “I’ve told you that about ten times by now, Cas. Don’t ask me to tell you again.”
“I’m serious, Dean. From what you’ve been tellin’ me, I think he might be interested, but he might not be sure if he can make a move.” The sound of a toaster popping came over the line, followed by the chink of cutlery on a plate. “I mean, does he even know that you, y’know, aren’t… straight?”
“Yes,” Castiel insisted, though it sounded more like a plea. He opened the door and stepped onto the road, nearly whimpering at the way the world turned on its side and kicked his heart into a full throttle. He managed to swing his briefcase forward and out, using the momentum to get himself out of the car and standing mostly-straight on the pavement. He paid for it a moment later, though, when the spinning worsened and black spots sprinkled across his vision and he felt like he was about to throw up, sob, and melt all at the same time because this was torture, sheer torture—
Dean only stared at him for a moment before he dropped his gaze and came over to the bed. “How’s your mobility?”
“Severe dehydration and chronic exhaustion, paired nicely with an almost nonexistent blood sugar,” Dean reeled off. “And you fainted on the sidewalk before I could get to you.” He leaned a little closer, his Nurse Face on. “How’s that concussion treatin’ you?”
“Fuck my life,” Castiel whispered, wondering how the hell he was going to get out of this and preserve any illusion of their ‘friendship.’ And without encouraging his own semi, which, yeah, was definitely and unhelpfully there. Then, he realized with a shock that the air around him, was… cold. Very cold. Abnormally cold. A lot colder than it was supposed to be. He sat up, plunging into the frigid air of his room and forgetting all bedroom etiquette, which he immediately regretted when Dean grumbled in his sleep, adjusting and tightening his grip on Castiel’s waist. Bastet chimed in with her own sleepy “mrrrawp” from the vicinity of Castiel’s shin. But Dean failed to wake up, and Castiel reached for a spare pillow that he slowly coaxed Dean into accepting as a substitute for Castiel’s body. Dean hugged the pillow, burrowing into the duvet as Castiel slid out of bed.
“Oh, my God, I’m so sorry,” Castiel started to babble, dropping his hands from where they’d somehow become latched onto Dean’s coat. “I don’t know why I did that, I know I just messed everything up—” Dean was as still as a statue, staring at Castiel with huge eyes, his smile gone. “I just fucked up our entire friendship, didn’t I? Oh, great, just great.” Castiel turned on the spot, whirling completely around, lost and hurt and having no idea of how he was going to salvage any remnant of their friendship. “I’m so sorry, can we just forget that ever happened? I promise I’ll—”
If the fracture is not out of place or is a very low fracture with very small pieces, it can be treated without surgery.
“Christ’s sake, Cas.” Gabe surfaced from giving Bastet a paw massage, exasperated. “Just make him a box of stuff, if it’ll make you feel better.”
“No,” Castiel insisted. “I don’t. You’re already working yourself too hard, and you need to get better the right way. Just stay here tonight and work on kicking this cold or flu or whatever in the balls.” He paused. “Besides, Bastet’s been wanting you to sleep over for quite a while.”
“I don’t like leaving her alone,” Castiel replied, going down the front steps of his porch and setting out across his yard. “She isn’t used to the cast yet, and I’m too worried that she’s going to fall or pull out her stitches or something like that.”
“No, I mean like really celebrate. You gettin’ the all-clear, school startin’ up next week… Summer needs to end with a bang.” Castiel hastily shoved an extra-large spoonful of ice cream into his mouth as Dean pulled out his phone. “I’ve got tomorrow off. I’ll rustle up some of the crew and we’ll play Pictionary and strip poker at yours.” He dialed a number and smirked at Castiel. “You’re buyin’ the alcohol.”
Dean barely took a moment to process this before he was running up the stairs and into Castiel’s office. Castiel was sitting at his desk, trembling violently with his face hidden in his hands and his body curling into the chair.
“Stuff it, Cas,” Dean said, but he was grinning. “Y’know, I never pegged you for a Gene Kelly type of guy.”
1: "the brothers k" is a fantastic book in my opinion, strongly recommend. and "winnie" is irwin's nickname, if that wasn't clear.
Jodie Mills was a middle-aged woman who had short hair, was quietly tough, favoured plaid, and had a bossy mothering side. Castiel liked her instantly.
Dean nodded, reaching forward with the Neosporin-ed swab and slowly dabbing at what Castiel guessed was his wound. “You hit the concrete pretty hard, so you’ve got a bit of a scrape.” He put down the swab and reached for a clean square of gauze.
“Afraid not,” Castiel mumbled, his stomach lurching as he caught another whiff of finely-spiced tomato sauce and succulent meat.
“No.” Castiel stood up, putting down his book and going over to the front door. Somewhat perplexed, he unlocked the door and pulled it open. When he saw who was standing on his porch, his stomach turned to ice and dropped to his ankles, his grip on the door’s handle starting to tremble.
wow i'm so sorry for the late update but my parents are apparently having pre-separation anxiety and i've barely had any time to write these past couple of days.
“Yes,” Castiel replied from where he was peering at a selection of potatoes. “Don’t you see my massive ears and fluffy white tail?”
Castiel realized the veracity of this statement when the front door swung open to reveal an elderly, bearded man who was dressed almost exactly like Sam and Dean (Castiel reasoned that a preference for plaid must run in the family) and wearing a raggedy baseball cap even though it wasn’t sunny. He looked Castiel up and down. “So this is Cas, huh?”
Castiel nodded, crumbling another hunk of bread and scattering it into the water. “They’re the only ones who like my stale bread.”
Castiel made it to Wednesday with two hours of dreamless sleep sometime between four and seven A.M., Thursday without sleeping at all, and Friday with a nightmare that had apparently made him scream so loudly that he didn’t have his voice for most of the morning, and almost late for work because it had reduced him to a quivering, Migraine-ridden mess.
“I… guess.” Castiel tried to ignore the volcanic butterflies in his stomach and scooted over to the other side of his bed, sliding under the duvet and waiting for Dean to do the same; he turned onto his side so he wouldn’t have to face Dean.
“Please say I can come downstairs because that smell is drivin’ me crazy,” came Dean’s (still very congested) voice from the top of the stairs.
,” Castiel replied. “This one’s different, but David Duncan definitely plays off themes that Dostoevsky used.”
“Like Hell.” Dean’s hand pressed slightly against Castiel’s back, becoming a more insistent presence. “Now that you’ve had the dream once, maybe you won’t have to go through it again. You need to sleep, and you’re obviously not okay.”
Castiel quickly went down to the cellar and threw together a box of canned and dry goods, an extra camping stove, and half a day’s supply of firewood. His mind whirling, he ignored the look Gabe was giving him as Dean pulled on Castiel’s old coat and snapped on Castiel’s extra pair of snowshoes.
. He handed over his two of spades, causing Dean to smile just a little, and resolved to leave the matter alone.
“Very funny, Dean,” said the tallest person Castiel had ever met, rolling his eyes. He was lanky and broad, but still somehow gave off the air of an enthusiastic puppy, aided by his floppy brown hair and soft hazel eyes. He smiled as Dean pulled him into a hug and clapped Dean on the shoulder.
Castiel let out a long sigh, ignoring the way it wrenched his side. He knew Dean was lying, because his orthopod wasn’t even here, but the message was clear. “I don’t really have a choice here, do I?”
Dean chuckled. “Nah, that’s just good filmmakin’.” He grabbed another handful of popcorn, although how he still had room for more food was a mystery to Castiel. “So did you like it?”
Gabriel made sure to close the kitchen door before he shook his head and pulled out a can of cat food. “Shit. It’s bad.”
The moment Jodie had left, with a bagged lunch in hand (“Please take it,” Castiel had insisted. “It’s the least I can do.”) and a friendly wave out of her window, Dean had said, “Gimme two seconds to get my workin’ clothes and we’re in business,” and raced across the street to his own house. When he’d reappeared wearing a pair of beaten-up navy blue overalls with “Dean” embroidered in white in the upper left corner and a box of tools in hand, Castiel’s heart rate had approached the realm of dangerous and he’d barely managed to choke out “Yes,” when Dean asked him if he could drive the Rambler into Castiel’s garage and get to work. An hour or so later, here they were — Dean in Castiel’s garage, the top half of his overalls unbuttoned and the sleeves tied around his hips, being indecently pretty and sweating too perfectly in the late July heat, and Castiel in the kitchen, bemoaning his existence and generally acting like a thirteen year-old girl.
“I usually leave here at seven-thirty, give or take. That way, I get in a good two hours’ work before my ten-thirty class.”
RN Sally smiled again. “Sounds great.” She left the remote by his right hand. “See you in ten.” RN Sally left  his room.
“Yeah, but I saw you thinkin’ it.” Dean waved his spoon around in the air to demonstrate said thinking.
When he stumbled into his office about ten minutes before his class started, Bastet in her carrier, Hael actually stood up at her desk with a genuine look of worry. “Castiel—”
Dean shot him a guilty look as he tossed the trash into the medical waste bin. “Sorry, Cas. Can’t do that yet. I’m not sure when you’re gonna be discharged, but the Docs might wanna kept you under observation for, uh, y’know… the anxiety thing. They don’t want you faintin’ again.”
“Charming, Gabriel, thank you,” Castiel snarked. “And would you shut up about the sexual tension? Dean doesn’t even—”
The transition from spending all of his free time with Dean to not spending any time with him at all was eased by the amount of work Castiel had to do, and by Hael’s insistence that she show him more of Cleveland. But, it wasn’t as if Castiel hadn’t seen Dean at all. On the weekends, he’d see Dean roll out his old-fashioned lawn mower and trundle around the small patches of grass on the front and sides of his house, unhelpfully shirtless. If Castiel came home late, he’d sometimes see the lights on in Dean’s house, sometimes even the blue flicker and muted sound of a television. And, he’d hear the Impala’s signature rumble and Led Zeppelin’s signature drums at least twice a week, either late at night when insomnia and the nightmare had him in their grip, or in the afternoon, when Dean would slump in the driver’s seat and slowly drag himself up his front walk. But, every appearance was marked by the memory of Dean’s phone conversation, the words rattling around in Castiel’s mind, and Castiel would turn away from the window, feeling a muted burn of pain.
“You’ve had nothing but coffee since eight o’clock this morning,” she cut in. “Unless you plan on becoming an ulcer connoisseur, you need to eat something.”
Dean’s face broke into a sudden smile, and he pushed the correct key into his lock. “The snowball kind.”
“My sister’s in Massachusetts and my brother’s in California.” Castiel shook his head. “My other brother… I’m not sure where he is.”
Blushing, Castiel slid the handouts in next to his laptop. “Thank you, Hael. How much time do I have?”
