John looked around Sherlock’s bedroom hazily. His arousal was subsiding, leaving a dull, slick ache in its void. He rested his head on the pillow he’d come to think of as his own and watched the closed bathroom door. On the other side, the water began to run, but John didn’t take even the slightest invitation from it. Instead, he closed his eyes. He’d ask Sherlock what the bloody hell had happened once they’d both had a chance to calm down.
His knees buckled forward as he dove to wrap his arms around Moriarty's chest and shoulders.
, Sherlock, that’s brilliant.
the vessel of his pleasure.
"Took us about five months, maybe four and a half," John replied.
“Sounds serious.”
"Isn't it a bit early for this kind of talk?" John asked, wiping his now-sticky palm on a napkin. It was half six and he was only awake because Sherlock had been banging about in the bedroom--and not in a good way--trying to find a "very important" argyle sock because his sock index was out of sorts. John was certain he wasn't in any fit state to be discussing such long-term commitments as
“It’s funny,” John said once he’d sat himself on the floor next to the sofa. He slid his hand along the curve of his lover’s belly, occasionally feeling the little kick of movement below the surface. “When we first met, you told me you thought of your body as transport...” He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to a spot where he’d just felt a flutter. “And here you are, carrying these two around until they’re good and ready to join us.”
“That costs... extra.”
“It’s been a while.” Doesn’t look up from where he busies himself with the kettle. He can see the apparition in the smooth metal of a kitchen appliance as he sets the kettle on the stove. It’s been a while since he’s seen the coat, and the ghost has found himself a new scarf that is almost identical to the one Sherlock wore on their first case. Their case. Cases. Their life.
Or he could walk away from her, change fate as she’d done to him three times.
"I suppose you're going to tell me I can't have the Chinese, either, because of the soy?"
Without thinking, John gasped out his own name, ignoring the fact that he'd just told a stranger his first name entirely out of fear that he'd stop stroking his cock so expertly if he didn't. He was too tired; he was losing control of himself and giving it all over to his stranger, just wanting him to continue those perfect pulls.
Wrapping his dressing gown about himself, Sherlock stood and leaned over the sink for a moment. The doctor got up from his knees, his hand automatically resting against the small of Sherlock's back.
The fingers around his cock tightened, pulling him restlessly.
The man's hand slipped into Sherlock's shirt and pressed a few times with three fingers, smoothing along the skin, watching Sherlock's face for reactions. Was he looking for tenderness? Cysts? John didn't see any reaction--didn't expect to, had no idea what he was feeling around for--and Sherlock was likewise watching the doctor for even the faintest of tells. He had his deducing face on.
Sherlock eyed the Alpha, trying to gauge his feelings. He seemed more shocked than anything, and while he was likely frustrated at Sherlock’s secret-keeping, he surely could comprehend that Sherlock couldn’t just... tell him. Right? There were so many risks to factor in--the fact that John could realistically take Annabelle from him just by claiming his parental rights being the biggest.
My eyes shoot to the open door and into the stairwell, and I can think of at least two dozen ways we could be interrupted—all of them ending in various levels of embarrassment for us and the parties who could intrude.
"I'm going to get your dressing gown," John said, brushing back the curly fringe on Sherlock's sweaty forehead before pushing himself to his feet.
No luck. The warm liquid slipped along the back of his throat, sinking down into the pit of his stomach like drinking lead.
now and he was actually going to have to go home and take care of it himself.
Sherlock looked surprised. A smug smile settled on his lips, eyes flickering to his brother before settling back on John. "Really?" he asked.
"Oh my God," John said, pressing his cheek against the wall and bucking forward a few times. The stranger let him, stopping movement and letting John fuck his mouth at his own pace. A tongue ran expertly along the bottom, twisting around and offering John new angles for thrusting as the head that pleasured him turned, just so.
"God, I've wanted this," Sherlock whispered against his neck, arching his hips upwards into John's. It sounded like a confession. Quieter than the rest of Sherlock's words, like he was ashamed of himself for having such desires.
A boy toward the front stood and approached, leaning over the cauldron and taking a deep breath. He didn't look as confident as the ginger girl, but who would be after a dismissal as she'd received?
And it wasn't even that he'd walk around with the knowledge that he'd let another man suck his prick, it was that he knew he'd use this blow job as wanking material until the next time he got laid.
“A girl. She’s three.”
John gasped out a breathless
"And then I'd mount you like a horse, doctor. I've ridden horses. Do you know how I like to ride them?"
His body felt too hot to be contained. He wanted to get out of his robes, wanted to get into the giant bath tub and live out his fantasies from the other morning. He wanted slick skin sliding along his own. Wanted to lay the man out on indigo sheets and make him writhe.
“Take it.
"No reason at all." John put the flannel back in the dish and stood. "I'll check in on you in the morning, then?"
"John." Sherlock's voice was confused in a way John had never heard before. He'd heard intrigue, unnatural interest, ecstatic confusion--but never the sort of underlying betrayal that laced his own name.
Sherlock didn't fight him, just went to his bedroom and waited for the sounds of John getting into bed. He waited another hour for John to reach an ideal sleep cycle and then closed his own eyes.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock took a hesitant step forward, like an animal peering into a trap.
He leaned in close so that John thought he might finally kiss him, but he turned his head at the last moment and directed humid words into John’s ear. “And I made the decision for you.”
“You’re torn,” Sherlock said, hooking his thumbs on the sides of John’s pants and pressing his lips to the sparse hair just above the waistline. “You’ve been fantasizing about my mouth since the moment you saw me, but you’d also like to fuck me.” With barely any help from John, the pants joined the other clothes on the floor, leaving Sherlock the only one still wearing a stitch.
I scissor my fingers again, moaning too loudly as my middle finger brushes over my prostate, making my cock twitch and drip liberally. Part of me is certain I’d sell my soul for John Watson to pull my hand away and take me over this table right now, but that’s not what I want—what I want is the picture behind me.
All the same, he slipped into the booth and sat down. He'd barely begun to skim through the porn selections when the long fingers slipped through the hole and invited him through.
* * *
“‘Piss off.’” Sherlock gave the other man a genuine smile, feeling something tremulous and warm stretch between them for a short moment as John chuckled. He suddenly found himself without the deeply harboured hope that John would be shipped off by Mycroft’s men to America or Australia or some remote island. In fact, he wanted him to be closer than the few steps that separated them. Objectively, he knew it was because of their very biology--their respective ages would’ve made simply passing in the street feel like it was causing a biological imperative. There was something beyond that, though. Something that made Sherlock feel safe in a situation where he should’ve felt threatened.
to feel another cock pressed against his own.
More than not wanting to be a parent, Sherlock didn’t want to be tied down to an Alpha. He’d never wanted to be anyone’s Omega--he enjoyed his life, and he greatly preferred to live under the radar of other Alphas and Omegas. If he had an Alpha, he wouldn’t be able to take the suppressants he relied on to keep his cycle in check. An Alpha would expect regular mating and all that other business that went along with a bond. An Alpha would expect him to stay home, bored and pregnant, popping out children every nine months the way the government wanted him to.
The doctor is leaning against the threshold holding two mugs of steaming tea. It’s a bargaining chip if Sherlock has ever seen one. He knows instantly that if he utters even the quietest word of complaint, his lover will likely return to the kitchen and dump the fresh-brewed cup down the sink. And he’s been dearly looking forward to his tea as a reward for getting through whatever crap show John has had droning in the background for the last hour.
One hand on his hip, one on his nape, John held a contented Sherlock close in the aftermath, coming down slowly and wishing he could chase the feeling just a bit longer. He was contemplating falling asleep without bothering to clean up--or even willingly removing himself from Sherlock’s body--when both their phones chirped with text notifications.
“How are you feeling?” John asked, spooning up behind Sherlock and slipping his hand under his t-shirt. His fingers danced along one side, pausing to wait for any movement below the surface. The twins were still, as if sleeping in preparation for their world debut in the morning.
At that moment, Sherlock had had the sense to hide his smirk, but it had been short lived, since he’d been banished a moment later by the tot for “putting him off.” Now, he’s situated at the table reading John's finished list upside down.
with spaghetti, and he indulged her.
There was movement in there--Sherlock could attest to it, healthy little jabs of feet and arms. There had been nothing yet for John to notice, but at this point, every day could have been the day John was introduced to his babies’ wiggles.
John pulled away, licking his lips and swallowing, trying to catch his breath before speaking.
He guided Sherlock’s lube-slicked fingers to wrap around himself. His own hand joined a moment later, stroking in unison until their fingers slid up and down effortlessly. The look on Sherlock’s face--all flushed and momentarily wide-eyed--made John want to take a picture of the detective for posterity. He rarely saw him so uninhibited; so close to the edge of losing control.
The Potions master approached him, appearing amiable to an introduction and completely ignoring his brother's nearness.
“Oh, Sherlock, you’re a parent. You’ve got a whole other person to be responsible for. He can’t fault you for wanting to--”
Sherlock, I’m--”
John coughed his half-chewed toast into his palm and stared at his partner, who had posed his question without even bothering to look up from his laptop. To say that the question was quite unexpected would have been akin to saying Sherlock and Anderson didn't particularly get along.
Sherlock's wand followed until the door closed behind him with a final sounding, sing-song "No you won't." When it did, the taller man whirled back around, letting his wand fall from his fingers as he rushed toward John.
Those hands were on his waist, pulling him forward bruisingly and then pushing him away just as quickly.
John looked down the hall, noting that four doors down was the room Mycroft had said contained the wardrobe with the Pensieve.
But no. They had said--
"Sherlock, your body is going to be coming off hormones that have been telling it
The nurse gestured toward an examination room, which Sherlock entered, and John followed, finding the doctor waiting for them.
I sidestep them, pulling him with me toward the living room.
Sherlock held his breath.
John frowned at her, confused, but she held her hand up, open palm. “The patient’s clock is running down.”
He knew John had nightmares. He also knew that he couldn't make them better by starring in them, no matter how much he wished he could slip into a disguise and be that angel John had so wished for on the battlefield.
This was new, though. He'd never been tied up before in a consensual environment, and he hoped he was meant to be willing. If the dreamer's fantasy was for an unwilling partner, he would have a hard time complying when the
John breathed, finally getting the most basic form of contact and finally starting to feel the calm he had so wanted before, though now there was an unspoken tension looming between them.
It was true--Sherlock’s body had never responded so physically to another person. There was no direct trigger that had caused it, but when the attraction began, it was almost a shock for the detective, though he slowly watched John’s reactions to him change over a similar span of time. All leading up to that night in the hallway.
to share a meal. But there was a growing fondness in those familiar eyes, and John didn’t leave Sherlock anticipating the end of that sentence for long: “Because I think I could be persuaded into a takeaway.”
He didn’t expect to see the fully-grown man curled into a ball in the corner of the stall, eyes blank behind the crystallized door.
"On your rounds a few nights ago, you were abducted by James Moriarty, a man who has been pretending to court Professor Hooper in order to gain closer access to my younger brother. He and Sherlock squared off in the Room of Requirement, and at some point, I'm to believe you lost consciousness as a result of a potion given to you by Mr. Moriarty while you were under the Imperius curse."
“How ever will I choose?” John asked with a grin.
“John,” he says, and John can feel the sound in every inch of them that touch. “John, I... I don’t expect you to take this lightly.” Arms tighten around him, and rightly so. John’s knees are shaking with his effort to remain standing. Warmth, words, weight. It doesn’t add up. Too many of his senses are working against him. It’s never been like this before.
The Alpha’s eyes sparkled, and he looked at Mike first, as if he wasn’t completely sure Sherlock was real and needed verification. Mike shrugged; he was used to Sherlock’s behavior after all these years. And when John’s eyes--Annabelle’s eyes, really, he couldn’t get over the exactness of the steel blue gaze--slid back to his own a second later, the man licked his lips.
"Technicality. Am I free to go?"
"It's imperative. For a case, Molly. I need to find out if there's--"
John pays a visit to the Potions classroom. He didn't know what to expect, but it certainly wasn't this.
“Looks like you’ve had a productive day,” he says sarcastically, gesturing to the open dressing gown that does nothing to cover my bare chest and thin pajama bottoms. There once was a time when I wouldn’t understand his sarcasm. I’m loath to remember it—that time when we didn’t completely understand each other and had to dance around implications and unclear social cues and bumbling flirtation like two souls lost in the dark.
John watched as the parchment settled onto the desk with a quiet rustling. The desk was awash in chaos; John silently wondered if the professor's notes would ever be seen again after he wrote them.
"And what about conception? Were you trying long?"
Or better. Whatever.
Beneath me, I can feel him positioning himself, wrapping his hand around his own cock to set it in place for me to lower myself onto him. One hand steadies me on my hip as I raise myself up onto my knees again, and then he’s guiding his cock home, pressing against my willing hole as I sink back down on top of him.
John would have to get it himself.
Before he'd opened it, the door of the other booth opened and closed, and his stranger was disappearing down the hall without even bothering to wank himself. Or maybe he had and John hadn't been paying enough attention.
Their teeth clashed with a pain so bright Sherlock was certain he could see the throbbing behind his eyes. For long moments, he could focus little on anything other than John’s teeth worrying his lower lip, trailing down to nibble at his jaw line with teasing nips. It would be so easy to accept this new pleasure if his body would cooperate. But no.
“In a minute.”
“We’ll only know if we test it.”
They didn't think about it again that day. After all, the new tests had been negative less than twenty-four hours ago.
Sherlock leaned forward, careful of the knot still keeping them joined together. The aftershocks were still pulsing through him every few moments, and John stroked his back as they breathed together. He unexpectedly desired nothing more than for the knot to keep them joined together indefinitely--if this tenderness was what he could expect during a shared heat, he was certainly in favor of doing this more often.
This was new. His cock was most definitely interested.
Still, he licks his lips in anticipation.
It was the moment John Watson realized he was completely, madly in love with Sherlock Holmes.
No matter what niggling sensation in the back of John’s mind told him he’d forgotten to pack Sherlock’s slippers or that they’d gotten the wrong newborn formula, they were ready.
, is that he bristles at the word “damn” being muttered in the same room as his son. They may as well be two different people; their vocabularies are so vastly different.
sentimental, had needed nothing more than the reassuring warmth of the other man in his arms. Only for a moment, only long enough to end their shouting and put it behind them and simply calm themselves enough to sit down and drink their tea. Talk it over; work it out. End the shouting.
And John had come back.
Which is where the pyjamas come in. Hamish loves footed jim-jams. And he whole-heartedly believes in Father Christmas.
John moaned out his agreement for the situation--yes,
“Not yet,” Sherlock said, his voice low. “I just want to feel you right now.”
He felt like he’d been waiting years for John Watson to get undressed and get inside him, but he hadn’t even been in the flat for a quarter hour.
John’s eyes remain closed, but his eyebrows raise in surprise. “Dunno. Harry’s got me by five years. I imagine it’s nice to have someone to blame for mischief in the beginning, then you hate each other, and then eventually you work it out. You’d know--you’ve been through it with Mycroft.”
if something so broken could happen in the night.
“You’re not usually quite this insistent.” The kettle calls to him. John doesn’t realize it’s been so long. Lingering silence hypnotized him. Breathing. He could hear Sherlock breathing. In and out, like he used to. Even.
Sherlock reached out and grasped the thick cylinder in his hand, letting his thumb pass over John’s as he did.
Then he leaned back, pulling Sherlock down with him, and tangled them together on the sofa.
He’d have to get out of bed and deal with it eventually. Didn’t mean he wanted to.
The previous times Sherlock had been by, there had almost always been dishes in the sink, and a myriad of forgotten teacups strewn about the place in various stages of emptiness. Now, the room was clean (spotless by Sherlock’s low standards) and he’d set a basket at the end of the bed with freshly laundered linens. Spares, from what Sherlock could tell, so that they’d be able to change the sheets and avoid sleeping in any cooling spots. The teacups had been replaced with sealed bottles of water on the nightstand, even though the sink and all its glasses were practically within spitting distance of the double bed.
“He’s wonderful to me,” Sherlock responded, honest and vulnerable. “I can’t say I’ve been the same to him.”
And then there was denim on either side of his chest as John straddled him, still fully clothed. Strong thighs, a solid arse, and then there was a bulge of rough material against his cheek.
It went on like that for a while; light kisses, fluttering touches, John trying to keep Sherlock from rushing things unnecessarily. If they were going to shag in the middle of a  Wednesday afternoon, they were going to enjoy each other so thoroughly, they'd have lingering tremors until it was time to go again.
Stop thinking like that. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes did not have a favorite.
The thing about John Watson,
John's cock seemed to have a mind of its own, moving forward into that lovely hand, pumping away and taking his hips with it. It was like being in a threesome with a fist and a man at his back. Each forward thrust squeezed his cock and it was easy to remember the sensation of the stranger's clenching arse around him, and every pull brought him closer to the other man's straining erection.
“Understand, John, that I couldn’t just bring you into her life without--”
Sherlock didn't even have his wand drawn. Bleeding idiot. Gorgeous, insufferable idiot.
He ran his hand along John’s flank, trying to gently rouse him from sleep. Last time he woke the man, he’d had a bit less tactful, and had been told in no uncertain terms that it was a “bit not good” to wake someone by manhandling them into a preferred sexual position, in heat or not.
Sherlock’s hips bucked twice against John, and he felt the warm glow from his hormone-soaked system spreading through him. It wouldn’t be long before his heat consumed him, and he knew that if he was going to change his mind, he should’ve done it long before he entered the flat.
8. New jumpers
babies--and
Sherlock needed more data.
It wasn’t routine, but it may as well have been.
And, on occasion, he didn’t wear a shirt under his dressing gown when he was lounging around the flat, drifting in and out of his mind palace.
“I thought we could all do that together tomorrow afternoon.”
"I'm not his..." John let the sentence trail off when he realized it would fall on dead air. When the keeper returned with the candle seconds later and lit it by pinching the wick, John stared for a moment longer than was perhaps necessary.
“No.” The word was more forceful than John meant for it to be and he softened his tone before continuing, “No, Sherlock, you are not apologizing right now. Don’t ever apologize for this.”
“Does she not like yellow teddies?” John asked, clearly going for a joke to cut through the tension.
. But John Watson was different, wasn’t he? Sherlock had been in his physical presence for less than three minutes, and he could already tell.
"And if I hadn't?"
"How do you know he's quite so bad? Did Sherlock tell you what the man's done?"
“Well, you know it couldn’t have been planned,” Sally was saying to Anderson. “The Freak probably stopped taking his pills so that Watson would never be able to leave him. Snare him, y’know? Loyal bugger.”
“John, just one thing...”
him, but he waited.
He looked overwhelmed, but in a good way. Sherlock stood, keeping some space between them so John could continue to revel in the obviously profound moment he was having. There was a bead of moisture at the corner of one eye, and Sherlock, who was typically useless with emotions, was quick to remind himself that John wasn’t sad. There was a quirk at the corner of his mouth, a subtle curve up that told Sherlock he was content, even happy.
His hips surged upwards, seeking solace from the intense pleasure that was bordering on pain, only to sink deeper into the doctor's waiting mouth.
Yes, it was only for a few brief moments, but those moments were enough to attempt to sever his connection to his other half.
As John tipped Sherlock’s hand and squeezed with him to pour the lube into the silicone lips of the toy, they both seemed to realize at the same time that there were very few positions where one of them would not be fighting for dominance. The problem had been temporarily postponed by the scent of the O-brand, but it was more than likely that the second they were both sheathed, their natural tendencies would take over and both of them would need to dominate. And how were they meant to cope with that while deeper into the throes than they had yet been together?
John reached down between their bodies to position himself so Sherlock could slide home.
John swallowed down the itching feeling in his chest, willing it away, confused and not ready to deal with his feelings. He didn't have a choice. His skin felt too hot, too small for his body, and there was a swirling sensation in his head. He wondered if Moriarty was going to make him kill the brilliant man in front of him. The thought gave a terrible twist in his gut. He'd just realized he was in love with the man, he didn't want to have it all taken away from him so swiftly, so unjustly.
It had been happening as long as he could remember; the dream hopping. He was quite certain that he went as far back as three years old, but he couldn't be certain that it hadn't been stories he'd been told that were fogging those particular glass windows in his mind palace.
Sherlock is very good at guessing simple passwords, the portrait to John's chambers is certainly not his house keeper, and Sally Donovan is Not a Fan.
Thus far, he had somehow managed to keep out of John's dreams. It had been a concern when he'd first started living with the ex-soldier, and as time went on, the worry of getting caught in the crossfire of John's nightmares continued to eat at him. When he could avoid it, he actively tried to stay awake while John was asleep. Their proximity would only make matters more difficult: The dreamer closest to him tended to be the best target, unless he was already caught in another dream.
Mouth working down his chest, fingers slipping down his arms in feather-light touches as he moved. Sherlock squirmed, which earned him a harsh slap to the small expanse of his right arse cheek.
John hummed contentedly and allowed his hand to gain momentum under the water, small waves moving rhythmically. His hips canted upwards, now feeding from the wetness and the perfect heat of the bath.
Sherlock's arms were tight about John's shoulders, pulling him up as much as the angle would allow, and John encouraged their closeness by digging his heels into a shifting couch cushion and pushing upwards into his lover's body while simultaneously dragging him closer, then closer still with hands splayed across his lower back, just above the curve where his arse met his hips.
Preparation was slow-going, as it had been several years since John had been penetrated by more than a solitary finger during a wank. It was more than a quarter hour before his body was relaxed enough for him to crawl back on top of Sherlock and unroll the condom. The pair of them were tested and clean, but this made for a simpler cleanup. More time for the cuddling Sherlock would never admit to enjoying.
“Look at me, Mike. An unbonded, aging Alpha with a limp. Who’d want me for a flatmate?”
John hadn’t noticed, but he hadn’t had much of an opportunity to inspect anything. Sherlock had become almost self-conscious about the bump, sometimes seeming agitated if John touched him without invitation.
And Mycroft’s people could take care of it.
Pulling the jumper up, Sherlock trapped John’s arms and rolled him onto his back with a low groan of success as his chosen mate was momentarily pinned beneath him. He pressed against his prize victoriously, panting hard through his nose and claiming John’s mouth once more.
"I'll get you off right here, right now, with my hands, my mouth, and you don't have to worry about me interfering in your life ever again," Sherlock reiterated, cupping John through his jeans. "Or," he said, leaning in to nibble on John's ear the way he'd done in the hall. "Or you could come home with me and fuck me into the mattress so thoroughly that I shout your name to the whole of London, with the offer of returning whenever you like."
John's hands reached for Sherlock's shoulders, pressing him down.
John Watson’s middle name.
Their bodies only came apart when John softened enough to slip out effortlessly, and though they knew they'd have to get up, shower, and return to the regular world soon, for the moment they were content to be, content to breathe.
This was gay sex, it was so gay and he was enjoying it so much and then even more when the man on the other side of the wall began to move back and forth, pulling John closer to the wall in an attempt to stay inside that hot wetness and then,
"But I did." Sherlock was positively petulant about his honesty. "When I was sleeping."
particular ability. Legilimency was a rare talent, one John had yet to encounter in his 37 years.
John looked the same as he always did, but Sherlock found himself watching the doctor more often, looking for clues. Had the dream been a one-off? The result of Sherlock "cock-blocking" all of his dates? Or had the doctor been fantasizing about controlling him? About spreading him out on a bed and showing him who's boss?
"If we could skip the introductions, I'm rather uncomfortable and very thirsty and would like to get through this quickly, if possible."
“If anything, it’ll help me from saying anything too embarrassing in the moment,” John explained, holding the bulky mouthpiece up for Sherlock’s hazy inspection. “But I’d be lying if I said my mouth wasn’t watering at the thought of--” He cleared his throat and looked a bit sheepish at the almost-admission. “So I’ll wear it the first time, and we can reevaluate it later once we’ve calmed down a bit.”
One of the options on the touch screen (and he wasn't going to think about how unsanitary that touch screen had to be, thanks) was for blow jobs. As a man with a love of pink lips wrapped around his cock--and, well, as a man, in general--John knew he'd have no trouble getting off to whatever the blow job video brought him, so he tapped it and leaned back against the wall so he wasn't quite so close to the video screen.
His secret-from-everyone-but-Mycroft-and-Mrs.-Hudson pregnancy.
“So that’s settled, then?” John asked, sliding it back across the table for Sherlock to deface further.
Jim's hand was cold within his own and squeezed a little more tightly than John was expecting at half seven in the morning. It left his little finger just a bit sore, but he wasn't about to tell the smug-looking Ministry man that his handshake was too firm.
“Almost,” Sherlock gasped. “Almost.” He ground himself down as the knot began to swell hotly just inside his hole, providing him with a satisfying, burning stretch.
“Please,” he begged again. He needed that little push, one small technicality, and he’d be over the edge.
, he thought.
"Would you excuse me, Headmaster?" John asked, head reeling. He needed to find Sherlock; he needed to know what happened. He’d never had any sort of blackout period in his life, not even when he’d first come of age and had far too much fun with alcohol in the Hufflepuff common room. "I'd like to go and find--"
“Oh, Christ,” John gasped. He grabbed the other man’s shoulder with his free hand, canting his hips upwards to thrust further inside. John's grip on the toy forced it down at the same time. Sherlock's thrusts followed, at once fighting to take up the same amount of space inside the toy as John and also to get closer to the throbbing cock pressed against his own. They paused there, fully sheathed, breathing against each other and slowly leaning closer,
"You could transfigure one. You Healer-types always have excellent Transfiguration skills."
“John--” It sounds more like Sherlock than it used to. John swallows. He hasn’t forgotten that voice, then. Still shaken. Wishing the last words hadn’t been goodbyes. Hadn’t been desperate.
When Mummy confronted their father, he admitted everything. His things were boxed and gone before the Holmes brothers woke the next morning.
"Ah, Jim. Primarily in the product he uses in his hair, though there are other tells. Personal grooming, for example, and the way he keeps his nails perfectly manicured." Sherlock pulled a slip of paper from his pocket and signed it with the very same raven quill John had transfigured him the day they'd met.
"Sorry?" John decided it'd be best to feign innocence. The fewer people who knew anything about his venture into the Dark Arts, the better. He could be very convincing when he needed to be; a skill from being under the terroristic teachings of the Carrows.
"A boyfriend, then?" John paused, licking his lips subconsciously before adding, "Which would be fine, by the way."
John's nostrils flared as he exhaled harshly, the air slipping down and fluttering over Sherlock's balls. The tongue settled against the underside of his shaft was moving slowly, like a tidal wave, a gentle, teasing ebb and flow that stimulated him perfectly. The moist heat of John's mouth, the stretch of his lips around the base, the mental image of their play behind his eyes were all adding to this perfect wet dream.
John blows out a long stream of air between slightly-parted lips before running his hand through his hair. “Hamish is going to be a big brother.” It sounds like he’s trying the words on for size. He looks back at Sherlock, eyes drifting down to the flat of his stomach. “Figured if we were going to do that again, you’d make me carry it.”
Sherlock couldn’t remember a time anyone had ever made him feel like he could come from a sideways glance, not even when he first presented as an Omega, but here was John Watson, sucking on his fingers like they were a delicacy, tracing his fingerprints with his sinful tongue, skidding his teeth over knuckles. Those lips had been wrapped around his cock not even a week ago, and it hadn’t been anywhere near as erotic as watching him close his eyes in pleasure from the sheer taste of Sherlock’s natural lubricant. What had always been a messy inconvenience of his secondary gender was now positively
“Then at least we’ll have something to work with.”
"It smells like..." She took a whiff and closed her eyes, focusing on the odor of the potion, and John didn't know all that much about potion making, but he had a hunch that inhaling fumes was never a very good idea. As such, he was on edge for a moment while the girl contemplated the scent, partly expecting her to keel over. "It smells like copper, fresh parchment, and..." She closed her eyes for a moment before opening them. "Damp. I don't know how to describe that."
John hadn't even unzipped his trousers yet.
"I think the Weasley girl fancies you," John noted, leaning against one of the work stations. It was nearly lunchtime, so Sherlock was through with classes for the next two hours. He had been hoping to convince the Potions master to replenish some of the stock for the infirmary.
John knew exactly what Lestrade was implying: Get us the information, or we’ll resort to Veritaserum.
(There used to be two working toilets in the flat but, well, no one was going to talk about what Sherlock had done to the second one. It was an unspoken rule of Baker Street.)
Not that it mattered anymore. SH had surely found another bloke to entertain him.
John stared at him for a long moment, blue eyes unblinking. Sherlock had nothing to compare the situation to; he couldn’t find the emotional clues to piece together what John was going to do next.
He was determined to find the Alpha, and they’d unknowingly stumbled into each other’s circles once more.
“John,” Sherlock responded, smiling and tugging at John’s jumper, “clothes.”
“I don’t mean to sleep.” John hoisted himself out of his chair and held out a hand to the blanket-clad detective. “I think I’ve figured out what’s wrong.”
He wanted it to last longer, but being halfway through his heat meant that his body’s stamina had gone out the window with his ability to be coy in bed. He began to move shallowly, trying to encourage the knot to swell by teasing the head of John’s cock with his deepest inner walls. It was all he needed, and combined with John’s expert fingers, he was sure to--
Sherlock was at his microscope refusing to come to bed? John would kiss his neck with the obvious implication of further appreciation and Sherlock's clothes would practically melt off him. Sherlock was high-strung and more of a prick than usual? A quick suck to the spot below his left ear would have him purring like a kitten and appropriate for civilized conversation once more.
This morning, he was obviously feeling especially impatient. His body was clenching around John's cock, and he was blatantly trying to force a faster pace than John wanted from his morning shag. So he stuttered his hips, breaking rhythm and trying to slow the rapid-burning fire in his belly that was traveling all the way down to the tips of his toes and back up to his groin with a lovely, tingling pressure.
Sherlock got into the bed first while John watched from his side. He felt unsure about how welcome his presence would be just then. Even if Sherlock just wanted his companionship for a little while, it was still probably a bad idea to do much touching. The living room had probably been too feely in the first place.
Except for when--
"John, this is my boyfriend Jim," she said with a bright smile, looking up at the bloke like he owned the world and was offering her a key. "Jim works for the Ministry. He took a few days off to come see me."
A flash of dark robes and Sherlock had rounded on him, grasping him by the shoulders and looking into his eyes with an almost horrified curiosity. John leaned upwards, wanting to kiss it away, wishing he could get back up against the pillar and invite Sherlock into the heated passion they'd shared only a moment ago.
Not to mention the fact that he wasn't fond of having animal parts tossed at him by strangers.
It was a glorious fantasy, one he lost himself in until he was interrupted by a sharp rap on the wall to his left.
At the slightest upward push from the antagonistic alpha’s hand, John was pressing him harder into the mattress, dropping down on top of him like a stone. His hips moved at a slower, more commanding pace with a certain ferocity behind each thrust. Teeth grazed his collarbone and the toy dug into his stomach and the lack of control was so positively
John eyed her curiously before taking the offered parchment.
He could tell when the other man started to get close. His arse began to clench around John, and it was somehow relieving to John to know that his partner was going to get off as well, since he never knew before if the other man was just sucking him off and leaving or if he ever came at the same time.
John stared for a moment. “We don’t know a thing about each other. I don’t know where we’re meeting--I don’t even know your name.”
“Wearing socks to bed is the pinnacle of inappropriate behavior.”
“Fuck you,” John says, a small smile playing on his lips. He takes a few more breaths before clambering onto his own knees and all but tackling Sherlock down to the mattress. The taller man doesn’t protest, instead spreading his legs when John nudges them apart with his knee. They’ve reached a practiced stage in their lovemaking where it barely requires any guidance for John to breach his lover’s body once more.
so desperately, but in the place of darkness, his mind was readily supplying a backlog of every image of John he'd ever had, supplementing those images with what was currently happening to his body.
The fingers in his hair tightened and held him closer. Those hips began to gyrate against him, slowly, agonizingly so. Sherlock decided to test the waters by opening his mouth to the concealed flesh, mouthing at it and breathing humidly against it. He was rewarded by a sharp tug to his hair, angling his head back so that the clothed cock could be rubbed against his mouth until his lips were red and begging for it.
He was meant to be following that madman into the woods.
Sherlock was tempted to let it ring, but Annabelle was napping in his bed just down the hall, and he didn’t want to risk waking her. She was just as terrible at sleeping as he was.
When he got home, it was to find Sherlock in their bedroom, sprawled out on the bed  completely naked.
“Bend over the table and… get yourself ready.” He goes breathless on the last few words, twisting his closed fist over the tip of his cock.
Sherlock let his mouth be used as a vice for John's pleasure, hollowing his cheeks, sucking hard, grazing his teeth just enough to be noticed. His tongue worked at the underside, undulating as best he could with the pace his dreamer set. And then the hands in his hair clenched to fists, pulling him forward as the jean-clad hips in his face thrust that cock all the way to the back of his throat.
To anyone else, it would’ve been imperceptible. The faintest crinkle of Sherlock’s eyes--almost a squint--was gone before it had ever even fully shadowed the grey-blue irises. His face was hard as stone, but for that brief moment, it had been like glass that John could see straight through before immediately fogging back into an impenetrable cloud.
“No, Sherlock, getting shot is a lot. Being invalided home from a military career is a lot. Finding out the Omega you’ve been sleeping with is secretly raising your child is a
“I imagine I’ll only be in town another month or two,” a man was saying. “Damn near impossible to get by on locum work. Rent’s nearly triple what it was when I got back from the war.” Ah, so that was the Alpha. What were the odds there was another former soldier wandering about in these halls at the same time? His voice was pleasant to Sherlock’s ears in a way he couldn’t describe. He certainly sounded friendly, but there was something else there.
Their last sexual activity had been a quick shag at two in the morning after a case that had wrapped up a few days after they found out about the twins. That had been at the estimated nine-to-ten weeks of pregnancy, and now Sherlock was nearing twenty-one weeks.
He looks utterly debauched and we’ve barely even gotten to the main attraction.
The Shrieking Shack loomed large in front of him, signs warning every dozen feet against trespass. But that clearly didn't stop Sherlock, and John continued past the wire fences and up the dirt path to the almost swaying house. He drew his wand when he got closer and saw that one set of footprints had been dragged rather than steps taken.
John knew what he was coming home for, but apparently the detective really didn't have time to mess around.
"I'm aware of the responsibilities, John, and I believe I've considered it all thoroughly. It hasn't made me want this any less than I did when I first decided it a few weeks ago." Sherlock's hand brushed along the duvet that was half turned down next to his knee and he watched the folds in the fabric rather than holding John's eye. "I'm not certain I'd be a good father, but I know I could
Sherlock took a few steps back, putting distance between himself and the temptation to fall to his knees as John undid his flies, and sat down when his legs found the bed. He leaned back, unbuttoning his trousers and snaking a hand inside to stroke himself, a small relief compared to the hot flood of desire unleashed by the pretty picture being presented to him.
When the town car dropped John off in front of 221B, it was already dark outside and the dusting of snow was enough to crunch softly below his feet as he approached the steps. Upstairs, he could see that the lights were off, though he had to assume that Sherlock had already made his way home, or else he was going to have to have another conversation with Mycroft about Sherlock being out, unsupervised and certainly underdressed in the snow.
“I kept her from him, Mrs. Hudson.” He was more forceful than he should’ve been to the woman who was currently plying him with tea and biscuits. “And...” Sherlock trailed off as she poured him a cup. “John, the... ‘My gentleman,’” he said, quoting Mrs. Hudson’s own title for him back at her, “he’s not just... mine.”
There was the distraction--he was looking up as he dragged his teeth along the waist of the trousers, meeting Sherlock’s eyes while simultaneously avoiding the temptation of his presented neck once more.
Draft List - 8/12
Always the same film strip behind his eyes.
“Yes,” John said, shuffling on his feet to dislodge Sherlock’s fingers from where they’d snuck up under his jacket to play at the waist of his jeans. Randy as a teenager when cases wrapped, honestly. Absolutely no regard for the fact that they were being blatantly discriminated against. “I reserved a room earlier today after an absolute
“Yes, I’m aware of the Mandate--and the fact that you have a child. Fast-forward, please.”
Jim had circled around him, wearing a feral grin, catlike in a way fitting the villain of a fairy tale.
John adjusted his foot on the floor and pushed upwards at a slightly different angle, repeating it several times until the stimulation of Sherlock's prostate literally had the man leaking against his stomach and panting into his lover's damp, sandy hair.
“Would you like to see a photo? They’re really beginning to look like humans now, rather than foreign life forms,” Sherlock offered. The print out of the most recent ultrasound was always nearby--they both had a secret habit of taking it out and looking at it, just a surreal sort of reminder that they didn’t talk about.
plausible?”
Before he could unfold the note, she was gone.
I slip away from his mouth to tuck my tongue into his collar, proceeding to graze my teeth over his Adam’s apple, and he grips my hips to roll against me, beautiful friction that’s just barely slicked with our mutual passion. I was right about the suit against my naked skin—the soft rustling of fabric seems amplified as he runs his hands over my bare back, pulling me infinitely closer so I can feel the buckle of his belt just next to my cock. When he grips my arse in his worshipful hands, spreading the cheeks in anticipation, I nearly come just from the feeling of his tie brushing against my cockhead.
“Mmmm,” Sherlock hummed. He didn’t open his eyes, just stayed curled up on the couch.
There was a whisper in the air, obviously courtesy of the woman he'd left behind, telling him to stay away from Sherlock Holmes.
John began to move in and out of his lover, leaving kisses on every bit of skin he could reach as he did so. He was thrusting slowly, wanting it to build. With all the sex they'd been having and would have, it would be impossible to tell which time their child had been conceived. There was a certain amount of determination to ensure that every single encounter was one they both enjoyed, that they'd each found fulfilling, where they'd shown each other exactly how much love was there between them without words.
John, always a very giving lover in general, was quick to see to Sherlock’s needs, whether that was another knot to calm the ache, or a bottle of water pressed to his lips to keep him hydrated. It made him regretful that he hadn’t been doing this since he was 15; he felt a sadness for that poor, wanking Omega who would have to wait nearly two decades to know what it felt like to be truly satisfied.
“Hi,” John said, suddenly feeling awkward. He could count the times he’d seen Sherlock in less than perfect, professional attire on one finger, this being the occasion.
“Yes, thanks,” John said, breezing past the elf and into his room.
“God, it’s going to be so good, Sherlock. You smell divine,” John said, voice close. His teeth pulled at Sherlock’s left ear, tongue tracing the shell. “I knew the minute I caught your scent changing--I knew we’d do this. I knew you’d want this.” He thrust, quick and dirty, just enough to give a tease and Sherlock found himself grabbing at John’s arse to hold him down, gripping and pulling and praying that somehow,
John straightened. He didn’t think he wanted to talk about it, especially with someone he’d once passed the time with. They’d had a brief fling that involved several storage closets and a few unadvised sleepless nights in his flat between shifts. Of course, that had promptly ended the moment her clock had unexpectedly run down one afternoon in the waiting room of the A&E.
There had been a learning curve--there always was a bit of one with a new partner, and John had been sure that his good luck had run out when he'd been unable to make Sherlock scream his name while he'd sucked and fingered the other man on their very own living room couch six months ago.
“Okay, so...” The fluttering grey broke up on the screen to reveal a black teardrop shape with a little grey ball tucked inside. Too soon, the technician adjusted the angle and the image was lost. But that fleeting glimpse had left John breathless. That was their baby. He’d get to hear its fast little heartbeat. He’d know everything was okay.
Sherlock wasn't sure if he'd ever had his own dreams. He didn't know how that would work; if the people he knew in his walking life would somehow make their way into his sleep and keep him company in his head rather then their own.
John’s Christmas lists tend to be practical. For instance, the one he’s done today is a simple list of eleven items penned in his uncommonly tidy doctor’s scrawl. Nothing flashy or expensive. He’s never been one for much flair. It’s brief. To the point:
"You keep that shoulder slumped forward, just a bit, as if it pains you to keep it back in line, yet when you are being addressed, you stand at attention, even though it hurts you to after a time. And right now, you know that you could turn that bat wing into a quill with a wave of your wand, so why haven't you yet?"
"I'm going to get you some water, paracetamol, some crackers, and a cold flannel and you're going to be the ideal patient."
Something warm spread in the pit of John’s belly and he closed the book.
It continued on like this for some span of minutes that John couldn’t count, until he realized he was pulling his lover up and back down again with growing urgency. The swirling heat throughout his body was making it harder to focus on the fact that he had other plans. Spilling into that talented mouth became a pin-sharp focus, and the next time he opened his eyes was when he knew he wasn’t far from the brink. One last look, just to have it permanently embedded in his mind for every other time Sherlock was too wrapped up in a case.
1. Shiloh
The slight incline of Sherlock's head was enough agreement for the doctor.
It was best to wait until morning. John would just suggest it, a simple, quick test to make sure they weren't overlooking a happier cause for Sherlock's symptoms in diagnosing a summer flu.
"What spell were you working on?" John asked, tenderly touching the boy's left arm where the seams on his Gryffindor robes had just split.
He’s arched his back as he rolls his hips in a slow circle, enjoying the way John’s fingers dig into the skin of his thighs. The bed creaks obscenely with every downward slide, a lovely complement to John’s near-coherent ramblings. He’s been trying to slow the pace for several minutes now, but each time his body tugs John’s cock into that sweet spot, it makes Sherlock want to go faster, harder.
Bag on table. Sort out groceries, make tea. Keep going. Pretend it isn’t there.
John was sure he’d soon learn just what that meant, whether he was ready to or not.
* * *
When I turn around, John looks even more wrecked than he was before—his eyes immediately drop to my prick, where it’s begging for his attention. His hair is disheveled where he’s run a hand through it while watching me finger myself with gusto, dreaming of his cock. And what was once a light blush on his face is now a rouge that stains him from hairline to collar. He’s given up on the deep breaths through his nose and is now gently panting through parted lips.
“About her Alpha?” Mrs. Hudson gestured for Sherlock to sit, and then started opening cupboards, probably in search of biscuits. Sherlock wasn’t sure they had any in, but he let her look all the same. Sometimes she was magic at making food appear.
John knew Sherlock would be sore later, surely, from the over-exertion, but it was a small price to pay.
"Please excuse my brother, Mr. Watson, he isn't fond of guests... Or me, though I'm certain you gathered as much," the Headmaster said sometime later. They'd returned to his office to finalize a few things--signatures, agreements, the lot. "If left to it, I believe he would stay down there in that classroom for months on end if I didn't venture to drag him out regularly."
But here, have 10,000 words of fluffy mpreg.
John considered asking for the twelve-hour reprieve, but he shook his head instead.
The other man began to clench around him rhythmically on John's upward thrusts, making John's eyes roll back and his neck stretched backward over the arm of the sofa, a clear offering which Sherlock took advantage of within seconds.
“That would be because there are two in there,” John said.
Sherlock, who was much closer than acceptable social practices would permit, leaned forward and said in a stage whisper: “I’ve a reservation under Watson, as well.” To which John let out a small snort, because really.
He was sure that no one in their right mind put pickles in a breakfast smoothie, but the man had at least been trying, so he supposed he had to give him some credit.
John fumed silently for the duration of the elevator ride. He didn’t even want to acknowledge what had just happened, and he knew that Sherlock would be fine with pretending that it hadn't. The bloody genius could probably just delete the last ten minutes. He’d been
John supposed he should have thought it a possibility. He was a twin--though he didn’t think about it often, what with being so on the outs with Harry--and his father had also been a twin. It tended to go down family lines, but it generally skipped around. Three generations of twins were... odd.
Next came Sherlock's scarf, soft cashmere in Ravenclaw blue with a dull silver striped throughout. He tucked it into one of his pockets and followed the walking trail until he recognized the area.
Even though Sherlock wasn’t looking at him, John shook his head.
Sherlock gave him that On Reserve for Anderson look once more, brow furrowed as if the answer were all too clear.
John nodded. What harm could some external lotions do?
“Oh, that’s it.” Sherlock’s head dropped down to hang between his arms. The thrusts seemed to push all the air out of him, leaving him huffing and puffing against the pillow.
“Just one more moment, Sherlock,” John said, repositioning himself carefully. If Sherlock was that close, the slight movements could be the trigger that ended everything before it really began. “I promise, Sherlock,
3:32.
Mary should be home within the hour. Needs to get rid of the ghost before she sees him like this. Stuff it back in the closet. Push it down, back into the psyche it’s borne from.
He had the lock, John had the key.
Yes, he had certainly had a day.
2. Jeremie
"I require use of your X-ray equipment, Molly. I'll only be an hour, and I require no supervision."
"Good! Very good!" Moriarty said, barely bothering to struggle. John's heart pounded and he tightened his grip, watching the object of his protection over his enemy's shoulder. Jim's voice was flirting with song when he continued, "Oh, he's sweet. I can see why you like having him around, but people do get so sentimental about their pets."
The sudden cold rejection felt like failure.
"Professor Watson, thank you for calling by so early," the Headmaster said when John stepped into the office. "How are you feeling this morning?"
“John--”
’ or ‘
After removing his robes down to a plain jumper and trousers, John settled into the plush, high-backed chair in front of his fire. It was a rare moment of calm, and he was taking advantage of it in order to evaluate the events of the last five weeks. The only thing that would make it better would be a cup of tea, but it he'd just come from a rather overambitious supper in the Great Hall and didn't think he could swallow a drop of even the most perfect brew.
"Mmm," John hummed against a pale throat. "You're my favorite part."
It was tempting. The bonding would take mere moments and would only solidify what they already had between them. Their bond, some might argue, was already complete without the bite.
Sherlock's face was a thin set of apathetic angles. He inclined his head down the hall for John to follow before sweeping off with a sweeping rustle of his dark robes.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” Sherlock asked, even though he knew the answer.
Sherlock shook his head. "Go back to bed," he said, swallowing dryly. "I'll brush my teeth and be back. Sorry for waking you."
Sherlock let go of the toy. They were close enough that they’d swelled just slightly and John could hold it on his own. He used his free hand to grasp John by the back of his neck and hold him in place. As he lifted one leg to wrap around the John’s, he let his nails dig into the skin under his fingers, just a hint of a plea.
"Holmes," John corrected. "We're not married."
Sherlock moaned and arched his back into the bite, at once pressing into the pleasure and trying to buck free of the other alpha. His blood was singing with the need to regain control.
“You occupy yourself with that puzzle for a few minutes, little one. I’m going to get your father a cuppa.”
They probably had another two or three hours before Sherlock’s body would alight again, and while he was sure he should sleep, he imagined he’d be able to think of little else but John Watson and Annabelle Holmes and their golden eyelashes tickling him--and what it would be like to be a proper family.
sometimes stretched the truth for the sake of keeping calm.
“What is?”
He’d seen younger people with the marks, of course. Hell, there’d been a six-year-old down the street from him when he’d been younger who had borne the mark at the age of three. It was unfair at every age, but given that he’d come so close on four different occasions made him especially bitter at the universe. They couldn’t take her away from him now.
--and thrust home once more, stilling his hips and letting himself be taken as deeply as possible by the clenching muscle.
John put down his fork, regretful that he'd only had three bites before Sherlock had solved the mystery, and was about to ready himself for a criminal chase through Hogsmeade (he was far too old for his) when Sherlock held up a hand to stop him.
John scrubbed a hand over his face. “Sherlock, we’re going to love them both just the same--”
"I did." John wanted to comment that the professor was losing his touch; it was a bit obvious.
He supposed it was a talent left over from the war, being able to see through certain security charms. He'd had to train himself at a young age to look through enchantments, it was one of the things that had made him so talented as a Healer--he could see through a lot of magic in ways that many others couldn't. His fingers pushed lightly at the door, giving him a bit more room to see. It wasn't as though he could see directly through an enchantment; far from it. He could see the faint edges of shapes in the room, though, and that was often enough.
But just because he now has the knowledge of how to change nappies and how to comfort a feverish child doesn’t mean he’s better at
The decision not to tell anyone until they were just a bit further along came from the “high-risk” aspect of the pregnancy. Their ages, the fact that it was their first (and second--that thought was still a little hard to process sometimes), and that it was a twin birth all stacked some of the odds against them. But all was well--they would even be able to tell the sexes soon, if the babies would cooperate and give a good view of their respective junk on the next ultrasound.
“Of course not, dear. You needed to know him. But you’ve had a rather long courtship, as far as these things go. Are you... sure of him now?” She gave him a sad smile.
John tilted his head to one side like an interested puppy. Not only had it been so long since they’d last been sexually intimate, but John couldn’t actually remember the last time he’d seen a sliver of Sherlock’s skin above the wrists or below the neck.
He made his way to the Headmaster's office, kicking himself the whole way there for not already being awake. The halls were strangely deserted for a morning in the middle of the week, but John guessed he was being summoned for his tardiness to the infirmary, which would mean it was likely the middle of the first block of classes.
John found his pyjama bottoms on the floor of Sherlock’s side of the bed. After pulling them on, he picked up the towels again and returned to the couch. Sherlock was still chattering, though there was a bit more color in his skin. His curls were still stuck to his forehead in inky swirls.
And later, when they were laying, spent, in Sherlock's bed at Baker Street, John wiped sweaty curls away from his new lover's forehead and kissed him once more, sweetly this time.
Sherlock shook his head.
“You can read them before I do anything with them.”
And something John will probably find in a small box on Christmas morning.
This was news to John, as he couldn't remember being scheduled for rounds so far away from his usual haunt--or at all that night, to mention it--but it wasn't uncommon for Sherlock to pass things off on him so he could sit in his chambers and stare at decaying frog eyes in slug slime or whatever his latest atrocity was.
Soon.
He tried to imagine it, the anticipation building, the feel of a stranger’s expert mouth setting to work. Just waiting for Sherlock’s lips to touch him was an overwhelming experience and then--
“Would you--” Sherlock swallowed, pushed through: “Would you like to come by at the weekend? You could--meet Annabelle.”
The detective was curled around the toilet bowl, hugging it like a life preserver.
John gets a lidded cup from Hamish’s shelf and pours the milk. Sherlock notices that John is using the regular jug rather than the low-fat milk they'd been trying to get Hamish on, but he doesn't comment--again, unimportant focus. John shrugs. “He’ll come up with something. All he wanted last year was that train. He’s yet to be very high maintenance--I doubt he’s ever going to make a pages-long list of Christmas demands.” He snaps the lid into place on the sippy cup and puts the milk away. When he goes to walk through the door, he pauses, putting a hand on Sherlock’s hip and turning him back toward the scene in their living room.
Their daughter’s.
But he can’t be. It’s not
If he could save him, just once, maybe the nightmares would cease.
“Eleanor?” John posited.
“You’re pregnant.” No question, just a slightly flabbergasted expression across John’s features as he pushes himself up to a sitting position. Sherlock follows, not sure whether John can handle the surprise just yet and mildly concerned that he might fall over. Thankfully, there are few better places to fall over than in a bed.
That was how, six hours after leaving the castle with Sherlock Holmes, John Watson found himself sinking down into the pool-sized bath that was filled with lavender bubbles. He leaned back against the side, sitting on the ledge under the water. It felt like the water was massaging him as it flowed through the pipes and into the tub.
The way his head flopped back onto the pillow, eyes squeezed tight, once Sherlock’s hips settled was a sight Sherlock was sure would feature in his masterbatory fantasies until the end of time.
His sister watched on with reproachful, yet interested eyes.
“Boy or girl?” John asked.
"All the more reason not to let him get away," Sherlock huffed. "You're a competent Healer. I trusted you to fix whatever I'd broken." The look in those clear eyes, full of warmth and affection that was generally tucked away behind a cool demeanor, made John's heart flutter, entirely unwelcome.
Sherlock turned to the J’s.
With most people, John was sure there would have been a degree of biting sarcasm.
And then--a week ago. The locked door.
Oh, he was well and truly fucked.
“Let me get you a fresh cup.” John reached for the saucer, but Sherlock held it out of reach with one hand while grabbing his lover’s wrist with the other.
Sherlock ended the call and tossed the phone across the room. It was completely possible that he was overreacting. Maybe the Alpha had a sibling with a similar scent signature. Maybe Annabelle’s scent had caught on the wind as it changed direction, and he was particularly sensitive to it because of his cycle.
"John," Sherlock gasped against his mouth. "Moriarty. We have to--"
So in the beginning, he was thrown for a loop by Sherlock's absolute silence during their lovemaking.
Sherlock rolled over in bed. What would his life have been like with a mother like Mrs. Hudson? He surely wouldn't have been given a mini freezer and his own laboratory at the age of six. Probably wouldn't have been allowed to keep frozen rats and frogs in the same house.
“Sherlock.” John’s voice was more direct now, but he wasn’t getting a single sign that Sherlock could hear a word he said. “Love, please.” He swallowed as Sherlock’s teeth started to chatter audibly. It was the first change in his state since John had entered the room. John got in front of Sherlock--a most uncomfortable squeeze, but it gave him a better chance to see the other man. He put his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and squeezed gently before rubbing up and down, hoping for some blood flow.
. Now, he could imagine himself self-consciously tip-toeing around John to keep the man from seeing his oversized-load of a belly, all while simultaneously craving him. But pregnancy was heavy, his balance was thrown, he’d experienced near-constant nausea--“It was miserable.”
Once they were there, slowly rocking into each other with little more than hot air between them, John let his own arms slip around the entirety of Sherlock's thin frame, holding him close and moving with him as his body at once begged for release and for relief from the strain of his lover's weight.
John thought, snaking up a hand to pinch a peaked nipple between thumb and forefinger. He hadn't had a fantasy he couldn't control since he didn't know when. But every thought just brought more obscenities than he could imagine, more scenes he wanted to play out. More impossibilities.
Merlin's balls, was it written on his face?
John didn’t know how Sherlock did that without checking a clock.
“Hang on,” John says, putting one finger against Sherlock’s morning-chapped lips. “I think you may have forgotten to mention a crucial aspect of this conversation. Either that, or I slept through it. Still, slow it down for a minute.”
John shook his head. "I'll have time to pick one up tomorrow." He glanced over at the Aurors, wondering if he'd catch a glimpse of Potter or Weasley, but he didn't see either of their tell-tale heads. "Is this what you do, then?" he asked. "Risking your life to prove you're clever?"
1. Sophie
The room was silent until a rustling of blankets and towels brought John out of his silent fuming. Sherlock was reaching for his tea.
“Of course not, John, you know as well as I that we just barely made it through that heat without giving in to a bond!” Sherlock realized their voices were raising incrementally when a woman walking by eyed him, scandalized. He lowered his voice, keeping the intensity: “It’s not a matter of settling. We wanted--we want each other. It was just like in your daydream meet-cute, except this isn’t as clean-cut.”
They settled for breathing into each other, lips parted, heated, running on sense memory of sliding mouths. The tips of their noses touched aligned, and John's breaths curved into a smile along his parted lips.
“God, that’s lovely,” John breathed against the back of Sherlock’s neck. “Alright?”
“I don’t think I can do this.” Sherlock’s voice was quiet, practiced as if he’d been mumbling the words in order to work up a script for when he was ready to say them aloud.
this, but it wasn't something he could--or wanted--to do on his own. Sherlock's almost shy disconnection from saying things about the solidified concept of parenthood made John feel like he was trying to keep a distance in case his proposal was rejected.
He relished the feeling of Sherlock’s body moving with him, the heat inside triggering small spasms through him as he got closer and closer to the edge. One hand moved around to grasp the plush arse as they moved, and his dominant hand drew Sherlock in closer. When his fingers slipped along Sherlock’s skin to rest on the nape of his neck, clearly hoping for a kiss, Sherlock turned away once more.
He looked up at Sherlock, who was straddling his thighs and practically vibrating with excitement and he hadn't ever exactly fantasized about this moment, but here it was.
John took a deep breath and moved closer to Sherlock, pulling them together. “Sorry for going all melancholy on you there. I just thought it was something you should know if we’re...” He stopped himself by pressing his face into Sherlock’s neck and taking a deep breath. His eyelashes tickled at the skin below Sherlock’s ear. “Just thought you should know.”
Sherlock Holmes didn't disappoint.
Not kill the man, maybe, but they could certainly ship him off to America or somewhere on a special assignment. Anything to get him away from London. If he was wandering through Regent’s Park on a Tuesday, his life unknowingly orbited that of his daughter.
"Earlier today, you didn't notice that you reached for your wand when I turned on you. Instinct, left over from a time when you'd had to defend yourself around every corner. The Carrow reign, then. You aren't a natural soldier, but you will fight when threatened, the same way the rest of your House would. Your wand pocket is sewn into the right side of your robes, indicating that your dominant arm is the left, however, the fact that you caught that bat wing with your right tells me that you needed to learn to use it, and still do on occasion. Why would you need to use a different dominant hand? Injury. Traumatic injury at a young age, and I'll bet you spent your last years at Hogwarts on the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, where you played with your right arm."
Each time Sherlock woke from the fantasies, he woke with the knowledge that he wasn't the only one waking from a fresh orgasm. He woke knowing that across the flat, John was alone when they could've been spent together.
Before he could remove the condom himself, his stranger's fingers were around him, stroking him and making his body shiver. The condom went away a moment later and then John was cleaned off by the stranger, as he always was. Before John could question a thing, the other man was gone and John could only assume he'd return the next week for whatever else their affair had to give.
"Come on, Sherlock," John whispered in his ear, punctuating his words with sharp jabs of his hips. "Come for me."
Missed it a fair bit, too.
Sherlock’s mind let him imagine that he had won, that he’d pushed a willing John Watson into his bed and pinned him down, arms above his head as their bodies finally came together as naked as the day they were born. The mechanics of this would be different in the light of reality, but this was his--he could hold the smaller man down the same way he felt wrestled down by his need.
Annabelle’s soft fingers wrapped around one of his as she fell into step beside him.
that godawful elder brother that his younger sibling resents for his or her entire life. Which then makes me wonder what it is about the eldest child that makes them so likely to become problematic for the younger--is it because the eldest is jealous of the youngest? Does the elder child need more attention in order to feel--”
His cock was in John's mouth before he had time to think about the fact that he hadn't come from John's orgasm alone. Those lips were now wrapped around him, pleasuring him as they'd done in dreams. The dreams didn't compare to this--to the knowledge that they'd both remember this as a real event, that John was dipping his tongue into the slit as his lover rather than his dreamer. And--
Thankfully, Annabelle was with Mrs. Hudson while he harassed Molly for the toes of a corpse that had washed up along the Thames. They had to be significant--the left foot’s appendages had been completely removed. If Sherlock could find something interesting on the right toes, he could solve the case in time for dinner.
Until there was.
Behind me, John’s strokes speed up, if his breathing and the sound of his suit slowly wrinkling into oblivion are anything to go by.
down there.
But if this went well....
It took a moment for Sherlock to realize that John was being completely sincere--he wasn’t being sarcastic, or putting down what most people tended to look at as a morbid hobby. He was genuinely interested in Sherlock’s work. Genuinely interested in
Their relationship wasn’t one built on so many words--they had never verbalized their mutual adoration and affection for each other, never given a label to their relationship--but that was because it wasn’t needed, the same way John knew he didn’t need to tell Sherlock that he knew, or that he was sorry, or that he would never let anyone lay a hand on him again.
“Your friend was quite enthusiastic about going to get us a bottle of wine, so I imagine he’ll be back to accost you in a moment,” John said, his eyes smiling in the dim lighting.
It had no taste.
“I should’ve assumed, I’m sorry--I didn’t ask.” He was shaking his head as he withdrew his hand, but rather than moving to get up from the bed, he reached for the bottom of his jumper. He pulled it over his head and tossed it to the floor before starting on the button-up he wore beneath it while Sherlock watched, rapt. “The Mandate. I just assumed since you were unbound, you somehow... got around it.”
“I do believe you’ve met your match, Doctor Watson.” He gave a smirk before drawing away quickly, leaving John to stare down at the fading scar on his wrist and the forming band of white around the third finger of his left hand.
He didn't focus on that, though. He couldn't focus on anything. Not when John's clothed body was pressed up against him lengthwise, not when John's mouth was doing wicked things to him and preparing to venture downwards. It didn't matter that Sherlock was the one receiving all the pleasure. John was the one who was in control.
“I don’t know how you’d think I could sleep through this.” John smirked at the stutter of Sherlock’s hips when he started to stroke in time with his movements. “You’re a goddamn sight, Sherlock. Is this what you needed?” A swipe of his thumb over the head of Sherlock’s cock spread the wet bead of precome that had gathered there, making Sherlock groan and drop his head back on his shoulders.
“It’s just not on, Sherlock,” John said. He wasn’t denying the attraction, merely commenting on the fact that their relationship as it was had already crossed a line, and perhaps crossing the next wouldn’t be quite wise.
“I could tell from your scent the moment I met you--”
Steady as her heartbeat somewhere across town, waiting. He would meet her on the twenty-ninth day of January in 2010.
John, who had never been particularly keen on the workings of reproductive health beyond his annual checkups at the andrologist and his sexual habits, was happy for the curtain the technician erected, which separated that half of Sherlock's body from view. Of course he was fond of Sherlock’s body--in fact, “fond” was an understatement--but, well, he preferred not to think of him in such a clinical light.
“Fuck! Oh fucking
. High-end rent-boy.
Sherlock's mouth pressed more insistently against his own, teeth knocking uncoordinatedly, tongues pressing for entrance at the exact moments and instead finding resistance where they meant none.
But it wasn't, not really.
The short answer of it was probably that John always brought it when Sherlock asked him to.
Before John had come along, he had been mostly successful. His addiction to stimulants had been borne of necessity rather than desire for the high. Anything to stay awake--to keep from being trapped in nightmares, voyeur to explicit fantasies, re-liver of tragedies. Most dreams were mundane enough that he could get lost in the streets of London waiting for the dreamer to awaken, but those that weren't, well, they were a whole other story.
When Sherlock had narrowed the results based on danger levels and long-term side effects, John decided it was time to ban experiments altogether.
But no matter how strong willed he may have been, John was out of practice with it. His body was straining in every direction, his fingers fumbled as they lifted the goblet, praying he could spill it some way or another, anything to keep the unknown concoction from touching his lips.
"Good morning," John said, pressing himself against Sherlock's back. He'd woken up hoping for a bit of unscheduled shagging, but had found himself alone. As it was, he was already quite prepared to do his part in their baby making routine, and he let it be known with a gentle sway of his hips against his lover's arse.
Sherlock had lost track of how many times he’d said the word “please,” but he was sure it was bordering on an embarrassing number. John’s hand stroked down Sherlock’s stomach to take his cock in hand, and then John pressed deeper, letting the knot slip inside.
I’ve skipped along through the channels on the telly, hoping to find some ridiculous police procedural that has a case I won’t solve in under a minute. There was even that true-life one that claimed to be about unsolved murders, yet not a single one held my interest.
Sherlock interrupted him, took one step forward: “I wouldn’t even be introducing you to her if I didn’t think we might--”
It’d been at least two and a half hours since Sherlock had gone into the bathroom. That couldn’t be right.
John was determined to figure that out.
"Says the man who still wants to shag me when I come home smelling like cherry cough medicine. Neither of us are good judges of sexy," John said, smiling against Sherlock's neck. No matter the man's protests, he had spread his stance so that John was a bit more on level with him, and John used it to his advantage to let his mouth slide along the skin between Sherlock's dressing gown and his hairline. That curly head tilted back and the blender stopped its task.
