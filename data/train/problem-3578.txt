“She drowns—Cas, she drowns people,” Dean said, letting the towel drop aside, letting his hands come protectively to Cas' waist. “She drowns people who've been fighting with their—with their—”
Dean drove them into the city for dinner, going on and on about the music scene and the bars and the whole feel of it. He’d been to Memphis before, plenty of times. It was a good midway city, and he liked it more every time he found himself back there.
He read.
“You said it wouldn’t hurt!” Sam cried. “What did you do? Tell me!”
It wasn’t very big and the outside courtyard was thick with bright flowers and a bench. The blooms were huge and vibrant, cheerfully standing out against the tan face of the building, nodding their heads in the hot breeze. A fountain tucked in among the blossoms misted the air, haloing the bushes with a haze of rainbows. It was a nice place, nicer than a quick bite to eat.
“Whatever,” Dean continued, waving his free hand. “It’s bad news to get all hung up on her, and he knows it. Nobody will walk out of it not getting hurt.”
“Love has moved through you,” she whispered, her wet fingers coming to frame either side of his face. She spoke only to him, their eyes never straying from each other. “Love will always move through you. It has carved out places in this good earth and it has carved you up and turned you inside out. It’s time to lay down your sorrow.”
Sugar paused, her arms lined with streaks of soap bubbles. She didn't look at him.
Hell, but he'd missed this. How had he ever been angry?
...about us. Or it's something to do with us.”
Sugar tilted her head.
to know about kingfishers is online, isn't it?”
"Mm.” Another pause; he heard her yawn. “What do you do?"
The gardener didn’t answer but kept walking, his little dog trotting at his side, pausing every few paces to stop and sniff something, tail whipping at the air, or glance its black eyes back at the three still standing.
He pushed the book towards him and Cas swallowed, taking it, letting the weight of it fall in his palms.
Despite himself, he had wanted to indulge Castiel's optimism, all this time. And all of it had come crumbling down, just like that.
Over the tributary shallows the cicadas were buzzing in cacophonous chorus, rattling in the trees that hung over the water. Cas sat beside Dean on the warm weathered wood, in the humid night air, watching him carefully out of the corner of his eye.
Applause sounded and Sugar announced the name of their first song and the band struck up, and the people swelled onto the dance floor, settling right into the waltzing tempo.
“But we haven’t
For a moment longer they stood there—brothers still in suggestion, now, but soon to be brothers in name—until Sam softly said, “I should be—I should be getting out there.”
“So you’ve been seeing us? This whole time?” Cas asked, marveling. She shrugged again; the tips, the edges of the universe on the rounds of her bony shoulders rolled with her.
“Are they tearing it up?” Dean asked, trying to see around an eighteen-wheeler attempting to merge. His younger brother nodded, making an exasperated sound. He could hear the distant whirr and clank of back hoes and rubbed his damp forehead, creeping along with the cars ahead and in front of him.
“Cas—something’s happening to me or to us and it’s getting worse. I don't know if it's the job, or—or something else—” He ran his hands over his face, body panicked. “It’s like something is in me, it’s in me and it won’t leave, and I thought it was gone when that old man fucked with my head, I thought it was gone – I thought I had cried it out, but it’s different, it’s still kicking around in me, and when I touch you, God, when I touch you—it wants to claw straight out of me, it wants to get out at you, it wants you—it wants you so bad it makes me crazy, I can’t even think…I can’t even fucking think—
Cas and Dean stopped on the drive to stare at him.
The silence didn't follow them to New Orleans. They hit the city, or the city hit them—something hit something—and all the noise flooded at once. The traffic, the boats, the people. Construction, car engines, barge whistles, fast-talking voices, all of it pushing its way into the car and around them.
The diner faded to background noise as he lapsed into thought. That morning he'd woken up only to realize that he had decided to be a hot sleeper and push the sheets to the foot of the mattress.
"How about we clear the table and you come and show us?" Sam said, and she laughed at herself.
"I can't stop thinking about you. So I wanted you to know. That I think about you all the time— and I don't know—what that means, but I think it means I might be—in love with you? But I don't know. I don't know if that's an—okay thing. If that's what should happen, and it's really no good for you or me because I'm not the person you want. I can't be that person."
“I feel like a person,” he said. “I feel like – like a person!”
“It’s the only explanation I can find. There isn’t anything else heralding ‘an eternal spring.'”
He knew he should sleep. They had another near-day's drive ahead of them tomorrow, to get to New Orleans. He had to be rested. And he
It was an early night, and Sam volunteered to help her with the dinner dishes while Dean and Cas made their way up the stairs, so much easier, he thought, than they had the night before. Their arms were hooked around each other's waists and he couldn't help but smile at it. Their bruises were fading, too.
A kiss, first. Surprisingly hard, Cas thought, when they stumbled back against the door and he felt the peephole connect with the back of his head, and Dean's mouth wide and open against his, breathing, exchange of breath, and Cas tilted his skull the better to fit, felt his heart begin to race almost prematurely. Took Dean's face in his hands and kissed him deep. Spiking flare of adrenaline (arousal?) in his stomach—he wasn't accustomed to it, to the sudden hunger and need that was coursing through his vessel, shoulder-blades finding the grooves in the door, slotting in. Dean slotting in between his legs, thigh a firm pressure there, his hands beneath Castiel's shirt, touching, feeling, exploring. This was not a guest room in Illinois. This was not lantern-light and cotton sheets.
Walking with them back up to Olivia’s house, Sam’s arms around them, though he kept having to wipe at his face—
All he had known unwinding, pulled apart by two words. He'd thought he'd known. He'd thought he'd understood. He'd known nothing, he'd understood nothing until now.
“I can tell,” Cas chuckled, moving his shoulder slightly back to kiss him. Dean’s eyes shut and he hooked his thumbs through Cas’ belt loops, kissing him soft and sweetly, both of them hesitating to do much more. Cas stroked the backs of his hands and rolled his head back against Dean’s shoulder, drifting with him to the music, letting it carry them like boats on the current.
He wanted to cry. He didn't want to cry. He wished sleep could come like the snapping of fingers, that it wasn't so much like the slow burn of drowning.
“What’s going on?” Sam slurred from his bed. Cas shushed him and he fell back among his pillows, huge arms curling around the one beneath his head.
“You're a god,” Sam said, a little while later.
“You should get dressed,” Cas said. “We're guests here, remember.”
“Yeah, let’s just call it,” Sam yawned from the back, rubbing his eyes. “I’m beat.”
In the silence that followed, the clock on Olivia's mantle chocked, loudly, dividing the world into instants, and it seemed that the universe held its breath.
“Reaper,” he said.
“Let me guess,” Dean interrupted. “Late 1800s.”
He had barely taken two steps into the kitchen to demand the book, Cas having slipped from his fingers in the doorway, when she'd shut him down. He started to say something and she held up a hand, heavy gold rings making her fingers curl.
“Yeah,” he whispered. “Yeah. I will.”
“Your blood sugar low?” Dean teased, to let off some of his own frustration, easing up on the gas to avoid bumping the car in front of him. Sam scowled, sitting back, defiantly silent.
“It doesn't feel real, but—at the same time it feels...correct,” Cas continued. His attention flickered down a moment to Sam, sitting on a rock by the water, laughing in conversation on the phone. He turned his head to Dean, and Dean turned too, reached up with his slung-around arm to smooth Castiel's hair from his face. “It feels like a good thing to be doing.”
"No, but it's the next best thing. It's a journal from some dude who was
Sam had returned with a six-pack of apologetic beer and Lily Francis on his arm.
,” he bit out. “But if I hear one whisper of something happening because you were too pansy to take care of it, it’s on you, and I’m not going to wait for him to decide.” He wheeled on Yann, eyes dark. “Listen up, I don’t usually
“Here it comes,” Dean interrupted.
“It sticks in the humidity!” she said cheerfully, wedging it open, finally.
The park was bustling for a Friday morning, he thought, as he approached it where it lay on the street a few blocks from his house. The playground was pleasantly overrun with children in coats and boots, mothers reading romance novels on the benches, joggers, dog-walkers on the pavements.
Chuck Shurley pushed his hands into his pockets. There was still morning to be had, still a walk to take, and he felt that for the first time in a long time the world was opening up beneath his feet.
Sacred invitation. Slow burn, as he gave himself up to it.
“That's what everyone's been telling us.”
Cas couldn’t shake the feeling that Dean’s sudden spike in appetite wasn’t a coincidence. They’d been stopping twice as often as they usually did – even Sam had complained with his incredulous
“Listen, whatever you guys decide—” He shrugged again. “I’m okay with it. If you’re a thing or not, like, it makes no difference to me, so. I mean, as long as you're happy, you know?” He trailed off, and Cas couldn’t help the relieved and affectionate smile crawling across his face.
“I love you,” Dean repeated, a little choked, a little shocked, and Cas hushed him.
The three others lapsed into silence save for the faint rasping sound of Dean rubbing his lower jaw. Yann bit the inside of his cheek and squeezed his arms around the folder.
He sighed this, as though he were finally at peace in the truth of it. It was alright to think that Dean was more beautiful than anything, because he was. Everything Cas had always suspected of him was true. Heaven might have considered him a coal mine of a man, but the diamond of his soul was what Castiel treasured.
“I meant in the meantime,” Sam said, stifling a yawn with the back of his hand. Dean shrugged and watched Cas suck a little bit of chocolate from the prongs of his fork and then set it down. He picked up a piece of bacon and tore it into a smaller piece; everything was always made bite sized when Cas ate, except for burgers, which he ate like Dean did. Dean was sure there wasn’t a coincidence in that.
“That’s six with that traffic,” Dean sighed, mostly to Cas, who nodded.
She vanished into the tabernacle, and Cas heard the sounds of matches being struck again, and a light flared up inside the tiny room.
“There is much good in this world,” Kami-sama continued. “It is a good that is worthy of all my time, and my powers, and my wisdom. I should like to remain a long time in it.”
The three of them looked down the street into the town, the flat storefronts neat and well-kept despite the sag of age.
“Listen, I dunno about
The woman with the universe on her back did just that, and with much of the cash found a man in the city willing to print five copies: one to send back, one for herself, and the others—the others to do with whatever she wished.
be bad, when so much good's come out of it.”
After a moment she said, “...you okay?”
He leaned against one pale-rose-wallpapered wall for a moment and closed his eyes.
“Come eat,” Cas said. “Your food is getting cold.”
“Mhmm,” Sugar hummed, lost in thought. Her husband took the plate from the counter and she glanced at him, watching him go. She rested her spatula against the edge of the pan.
"Undetermined," Dean muttered, unsure himself if even that were true, touching the doll-like hand, the smooth dead skin. He traced the mark with his eyes.
The clasp of the suspenders was warm in his fingers; Cas tucked his thumbs beneath the straps and held them up for him, and carefully he tried to pry it open to fit it against the hem of Castiel's trousers.
She took a shy sip of her coffee and then replaced it on the table, twirling the spoon.
Sam laughed, and she laughed too, soft in the back of her throat.
She smiled at them all as they sat uneasily down at her kitchen table—she could read the anxiety in their bodies as easily as she could read anything else; understandable, that, given who they were—but even she could feel the tic of worry in the corner of her mouth. She'd opened the door for important guests, and she was prepared for important guests, but she hadn't been prepared for the look of abject misery on their faces.
Dean winced, opening his mouth to say something, but Yann held a finger to his lips. The former werewolf took Dean’s face in his hands. “Listen,” he said, as serious as an oracle. “You were
The second floor was very small, topping the house like a hat. Three rooms in all, and a tiny corridor—the two guest bedrooms, Dean assumed, and a bathroom across the hall.
The same crescent catfish and stars that had been etched into Mattie Lawrence's door frame.
The end of summer was long and languorous in Madame Olivia's house. When the three hunters weren't reading her books or helping her cook meals, or talking in low voices about the wedding with smiles on their faces, or sleeping in the mosquito buzz of late afternoon, they were out, drinking in the city. For a week straight they explored the French Quarter, ducked into tourist-trap voodoo shops to smirk at the cheap faux charms and things for sale, took in Bourbon Street, the French Market, the Cafe du Monde, where the beignets were good, but not as good as Madame Olivia's. It was good to have days like this, days without hunts beckoning from states away.
He flushed, looking away in disbelief that it was the first thing to come to his mind. Not hunting. Not to resume the old family business, to pick up where they left off. He wasn’t worried about it. He wasn’t even thinking about it.
Sam rolled his eyes at the taunt, following his older brother into the hallway, trailing after him and Castiel as they rumbled down the stairs. As they neared the bottom, Dean crowded Cas and pressed against him, their steps falling in to time. Dean said something Sam couldn’t distinguish and Cas huffed a laugh, pushing him away slightly, stepping down to the thin floor.
“Shoot.”
“Never, Sam,” Cas said sincerely, glancing up at him. “It’s just – a complicated question.”
“I'll check on the food,” Yann said, scratching nervously at his neck, and he vanished into the kitchen.
He breathed. Took the chance.
Dean caved in at that smile. Something good – a good ache in the center of his chest – shifted towards the man in his arms. The best way of being broken: to be broken open for someone else.
He lifted his head and sat up, swinging his leg over Dean’s waist, looking down on him.
She was an old woman, but she knew volumes about love.
Strong cedar houses that would impress that brilliant light and court it into their empty windows.
He'd said so little, but she had a feeling the world would be hard-pressed to find news to make him happier than he was now.
,” Dean stressed, climbing into the car. The doors slammed shut and Dean revved the engine, circling out of the parking lot.
“You tell me what you’re gonna do after all this. After you leave me.”
“Amos Porter,” he said, carefully. “Rings a bell, I suppose.”
There was a long, expectant pause. The Impala’s engine was idling in the parking lot right outside where Sam stretching his legs and listening to a voicemail from Bobby.
“Well,” the old woman told them over their final breakfast in her home, “I reckon you won't be finding too many more miracles in that binder you've got.”
“I'm positive.”
Her eyes were imploring and devoted, and they listened attentively, like children to a Sunday school minister, or siblings to a mother, and she met all their gazes in turn, all her excited demeanor gone. She was sincere, now. Sincere and strange at the table with them.
“Cas.”
And in it—in it all—he heard himself. He heard the murmurs of the story twisting round and pressing, the truth of it, the fact of it.
Castiel was speechless, Dean’s words entering him and staying, bouncing around his head. He barely registered that Sam and Olivia had left, leaving him and Dean alone, the little book pressed benign between them.
They spotted Cas hovering anxiously on a street corner on the square, watching for them, and he dawdled there a moment longer while Dean found a place to park. The angel had his hands in his pockets and kept glancing up at the sign over Byrne's Birdhouse.
“What do you say, big man? You wanna dance?” Her voice was a low purr, and Sam nodded, surprised at himself, at how eager he was to do just that.
“Did you hear what he called you?” Cas said, his voice breaking the awkward pall like a sliver of ice, and the brothers looked at him.
, y'know.”
It came out as such a strange sound, caught between a whisper and a sob and something worse than that, if such a thing existed. Something worse. Something quiet.
“River Ridge, sometimes,” she said. “On account of it's looking right over the water. The room at the top of the house, incidentally, dear—looks right across the way, to the hills on the other side. It's lovely, it's lovely.”
beside her.
,” he shouted, pacing back and forth again, gesticulating wildly. “Tells us about a bunch of fucking—miracles we're supposed to believe are
It was back again in the bend of his shoulders and the bow of his spine.
Castiel looked at Momoko, who was shyly holding something against her chest. She met his eyes and and smiled, holding out a slender envelope of textured paper with a bright red and gold string tied around it, calligraphy characters written lengthwise down one side. Next, she held out a thin wooden case between her hands, bowing her head modestly as she did so.
Dean shook his head rapidly side to side, palm lifting off of his mouth so he could gasp. His other hand curled into a fist and he slammed it on the table, gasping again and again, as if someone had sucked him into a vacuum and stolen all his air. His body wracked with tremors. He was hyperventilating, nearly, and Sam felt a cold chill take hold of his arms, that sudden eternal instinct to
?” he mumbled, tugging on Cas’ arm as he passed, following Sam back into the kitchen.
Dean cleared his throat. “I'll go to the morgue.” He picked at the corner of his napkin and gave Sam and Cas a sideways glance. “You two can go do your research thing, you're better at it anyway.”
“Cas, what did it say?” Sam crouched down to the angel's eye level, caught his hazy blue eyes. “Did it say what this is?”
In all her talk of hospitality, one thing managed to slip from Mathilda Lawrence's mind—she'd neglected to mention the fog.
Yann sat awkwardly there against the dark glass and the beige drapes, watching them go about their business warily. After a thousand anxious looks from him, Dean had agreed to lock all the firearms in the car, and had promised at least twice not to try and kill Yann in his sleep. Sam had gone in to take a shower; now Dean sat on the far bed with Cas; one jean leg was rolled up past the angel's knee, and he was examining the swollen torn muscle of his knee.
“It isn't my story to tell,” she said.
“Thanks,” Dean said roughly, clearing his throat.
“Knives, you know, and blood—” Yann said thinly, a whimper climbing out of his throat, eyes squinting closed when Sam steadied the knife in his hand. Without another warning, Sam pulled Yann's arm taut and slid the knife over his forearm, tearing a gasp out of the teenager's throat.
As they turned to go inside Dean's eyes were drawn up to the top of the door, just for a moment, just long enough to see the catfish carved into the wood, and the dancing stars on either side of it, trailing out and away and ending in curlicued flourishes. An old and weathered embellishment looking out over the water.
The angel wasn’t listening – he was rubbing his thumb and forefinger together absently and staring at the walls: framed needlepoints, neat watercolors of flowers with their names written in thin calligraphy underneath, a shadow box with a real robin’s egg and a dried corsage, two Victorian cameos, the features of the smooth white visages muddied with dust.
“What exactly does this have to
“You know anything about carpentry?” he said, shifting his attention to Dean, tilting his head in interest.
He made a point of watching them out of the corner of his eye as they bunked up for the night, as he was looking up Sandra Eadie in the county records on the futzy wireless connection. They were moving in wide arcs around each other, tight-lipped, giving each other hard looks. They didn't even try to touch each other, and this, especially, was odd to Sam—over those past few weeks he'd gotten used to seeing them brush their hands against each other, lean into one another, kiss and caress, but now they seemed afraid to do so. Or too angry to do so.
A star who fell in love with a catfish.
“Room?” he asked, sounding bored, tamping out his cigarette in an overflowing ash tray.
Cas was sitting on the bed, unlacing his boots. His dark hair was gently pressed in soft curls against his forehead with sweat and he'd been yawning all the way back. Dean thought that he'd never seen Cas yawn before, but that he liked the way Cas' nose crinkled at the edges when he did.
“I don’t have a dad or anything,” he continued. “It was just me and Mamma, and she can’t afford her medication without me, so please—” He pressed his hand into the table again. “Please understand, if she weren’t here, I promise I would have already killed myself.”
In all the holy scripts Dean had ever read in his life, he thought, he had never pronounced any so easily.
Butterflies bumped in Sam’s stomach.
So why was he doing just that?
with their easy stances and confident walks, even though their pant legs were dusty and their shirttails were messily hanging over their jeans. Strolling along, tossing out experimental dirty words and chittering like monkeys at the results.
The yellow light was still on, and Cas could feel the hum of Dean’s body, a thrum radiating through his thin clothes.
“Y'all have to know
She'd woken that morning with a peculiar itch in her bones, something she hadn't felt in decades. At the very least not since the day of her wedding, she'd thought, dabbing violet water behind her ears in front of the mirror. It had come as no surprise to her, then, when the grumble of an old and much-beloved car had come churning up the ridge, and had settled to a stop outside her front door.
His voice surged out of him like water and he broke.
“Understatement,” Dean murmured.
, but
The Galilee dance hall was nothing more than a repurposed gymnasium in the back of the First Baptist church. They’d ripped up the basketball court and put down hardwood dance floor and done up the walls and kept the industrial sized kitchen off to one side. Before that, Sugar told them, it had been in a barn, but like most other things that were lost in Galilee it had been lost to a flood some years back.
“What do you think I do here all day? You think I lounge around? No, it’s done. The ones that gonna come gonna come.”
Their eyes met, and Castiel leaned down.
“Who are we looking for again?”
Helena took one look at the ridiculously small portion of food in front of her son and scolded him in Swedish, reaching over to put more on his plate.
David raised a brow. “Somethin' out of the ordinary over in the, uh. Ozarks? Where y'all been?”
“You don’t
There was the drag of Cas’ body on the covers, a soft-slip of sound. Dean didn’t want to turn around and see the wreckage. He didn’t want to turn and see the mess he had made of Cas, of everything.
"See, it's nothing," Helena muttered.
He never really finished his sentence; they barely had a plan beyond 'get the book.'
“So you aren't one of them,” Castiel said.
"That's not true," he found himself whispering. "That's not true at all and you know it. You can do whatever you want. Leave that town. Get out of there, I'm serious. Go find somebody to make you happy. I don't want you to wait at that counter anymore."
She cupped her hands, anointed him with water, blessed him, smoothed it back over his hair, most of it slipping down over the sides of his face, catching on the bridge of his nose, his eyelashes.
Sam hoped they'd all sleep easy that night. He was certain that they would.
She blinked, head tilting. Her mouth quirked upwards.
If Sugar was a sparrow, her husband was leggy as stork. He stood with one hand held in the pocket of his loose slacks, his fingers curled around the handle of a beaten violin case. He was a slight man with hair that was going silver at the temples prematurely; he looked distinguished. On his large palm was a star, same as his wife’s, and his fingers were long enough that they appeared to extend the rays of the star themselves when he chose to open his hand.
“Lily,” he said, surprised.
“Right, ‘Kurt’?” Her eyes were bright and curious, not accusing.
“He’s just a kid,” Sam whispered, as if it mattered.
Dean paused, and smiled a little bit.
was a better word, probably, but
“Dean.”
stories. Stories you didn’t hear unless you went way into the backwoods. The swamps. It’s so hard to tell who started what now that history is history.”
“What are you
"You got all you need, then. And if not, plenty of folks to lend a pair or a finger or two!"
“I'll never sell it,” she murmured. Dean and Cas followed her slowly into the hall, hands hovering behind her back as if to steady her; they reached a linen closet and she opened it, and carefully placed the masterpiece on a dusty wooden shelf, smoothing it out with her veined, crippled fingers. “Too precious to sell.”
Dean sighed. He couldn't come up with a suitable excuse anymore.
"1894—" Sam coughed. "That makes you?"
None of them followed her instructions to sit. They hovered together in the center of the room, both brothers held by Castiel's tight and anxious grip, and they could almost feel themselves growing smaller—ever smaller, ever tinier, ever shrinking in the face of whatever they'd arrived here to witness.
There was a low click, and Sam froze, finger still poised on his lip. (She always worried her lip. She’d done it nearly a million times while they talked, running her fingers over it and plucking at the skin anxiously.)
"Hungry things."
,” Dean insisted, flicking his eyes from his brother and Cas to the ground.
Sam shook his head. “Just—might be relevant to our other case, that's all.”
In truth, he already felt familiar with her. Or something similar; there was just something about her that he understood, even after only a few hours. Some part of her that was part of him, too. The urge to get out of where she was, the need for change, for growth, for anything. He’d recognized it, like a zap of static electricity. He'd had that, once, himself.
He just needed to hear it go to voicemail and be done with it. He’d put it to bed. Put her away, leave her behind…
The harsh asphalt of the parking lot stung Dean's bare feet but he pounded across it anyway, the night chill on his arms; he heard Sam tumble out of the room after him and they ran toward the water, towards the faint dirt path that led down to the water from the top of the levee separating the parking lot from the current.
“Y'all like this? This alright?”
When Cas woke the next morning, warm and comfortable in the gentle loop of Dean's arms, the octagon window in the wall was a blank slate of white—tendrils of it creeping in over the sill, so thick and heavy that it seemed to press and intrude into the room itself. Even the branches of the trees outside were obscured.
“Bobby, what the hell does that have to do with anything?”
He was enraptured—Cas realized he must not have much time, these days, to drown himself in anything other than news articles and obituaries.
She turned and bustled back into her shop, the door clattering, and Dean groaned, rubbing his forehead.
Twenty steps behind him, Dean and Sam and Cas cautiously zigzagged through the briars, feet adjusting to the packed dirt and gentle roll of the land towards the riverbank. As they came closer they could see a dock jutting off the back of the house, a little boat bobbing on the current, moored loosely to an end post, oars tucked inside its white belly. The house stood on its wood frame with its open door yawning at them in the afternoon daze, inviting them in to the cool interior, dark with shadows and pulled shades to keep the heat out.
Dean grit his teeth together. Sam’s voice lowered.
“A name, reaper.”
“I'm sure she won't mind us staying until it clears up.”
Your brother is a catfish, boy. And your dear friend is a star. And you are the dust that made them up before they took even those shapes, the shapes that stuck, the shapes we remember, the thing that's held them together all this time, in these bodies, now. And all of you have pushed and pulled your way up through such a very long time, and now you are here, and the story's come to a good end. The closing of a chapter.”
“You told me,” Olivia said, tapping her spoon a little against her ceramic bowl, “that you were going to build these two a house, mashwarohn.”
And slowly did the world cascade inside again.
“It’s just me and Mamma in the house—w-what if one night I just—what if it catches up with me? I could kill her – I
“It is nearly time,” the old god said. “That is what the river says.”
Dean looked at Sam and Castiel's expectant faces and turned to the side, lowering his voice.
"Yes. He was helping with something inside. Dry wall. He was covered in dust."
“You gave me a great time tonight, Sam Winchester,” she said. “A weird one. But a great one. You don’t have to hang around.”
“You’ve got a story, don’t you?” she said as he fumbled, and Sam closed his mouth.
Leaving his body in a gentle roil, casting the blue light back onto his face, and Dean in the doorway, Dean frozen in place, watching it go. Watching it burn and smolder silently from his lover's mouth, iridescent, like silky dust motes in their own glow, an ever-thinning surge.
He turned, after a while of examining the grass, the downy heads of dandelions, and held out his arms to net Dean in them. They strolled.
“Yes, he does!” Sam insisted. “He does, Dean. What would you do? What if Mom was in the same situation? You wouldn’t abandon her. You’d do exactly what he’s doing!”
Cas leaned back against the cabinet and pinned his knees to Dean’s sides, staring at him, half-lidded and cheeks still red, mouth kiss-swollen and slack. Dean dragged his thumb over the hazy pink of his lower lip and Cas pushed towards him, hips rolling up off the counter, legs crooking to bring Dean in closer. There was a scrape of porcelain while Dean pushed the plates further aside and pulled Cas in by the waist, mouths hovering a fraction apart.
“Something like that,” Cas said, softly, almost shyly.
“I have many names,” the old man said, sighing. “Kami-sama. Matsu Kami. I came here with my trees; far over the sea, far from my land, far from my familiars. Only sweet Momo-chin could come with me, for she was clever and acted as my dog.
“Why do you always have to be so suspicious?”
“Mmm.” Cas yawned and pulled at his eyes. He blinked at Dean, owlish. “What were you staring at?”
Together they walked down to the end of the dock, over the sounds of water breaking on the pillars. The wood creaked and wobbled under their feet and the smell of the river was so large and swelling that it almost washed like wind against their faces.
He turned to look at Death, tilted his head a little.
“I think we've got everything we need, ma'am,” David was saying in a low and calming voice.
"What did you call me?"
"All the other agents are so stuffy," she sighed, her lips in a playful smirk. "But I like this look. Very casual. Very good to have for dinner."
“Deep,” he managed, and Dean pushed up unexpectedly, and he clutched the back of Dean’s head, met his mouth while Dean rubbed circles over his shoulders. Their subtle motion made his cock rut against Dean’s stomach and Cas breathed ragged, soft sounds against Dean’s temple, wet kisses being strung over his neck. Cas rolled his head and Dean sucked marks on the side of his throat, fingers pulling and pressing on the skin of his sides, squeezing gently.
“I didn't know what it meant until now,” he continued, ever-softer. “And now we know what it was trying to say. Whatever—whatever we were building between us, you and I.”
“That we shouldn't worry,” Cas replied, softly. “That there wasn't anything bad in any of this.”
“I'm sorry too.”
The crack of eyes in bright light, the catch of the sun on white clothes, on lean lines, on soft dark hair, the shine and glimmer and light – so much light.
“Yeah, I know. So?”
He thought, for a brief moment, of what bad mojo could be hiding within the pages, but it seemed harmless. It didn't look witchy, but he scoured it anyway. He was sweeping his eyes over the back bottom edge when his thumb brushed against a slight dent on the spine. He flipped it closer to look and his heart leapt into his throat.
“Dean,” Cas said sharply. His whole body had turned, gone electric and dark with instinct to protect, and he was edging out of the booth, looking startled. Dean hauled himself up so they could get the hell out of there.
Dean opened his mouth as if to say
“Mighty bad coincidence, that’s all, and an accident, but she’s got a little bit of bad feelings towards outsiders, sometimes.”
His cell phone sat with the weight of a brick in his hand.
In the end, they did leave Galilee that afternoon. The itch was back in Dean and he could hear, down the road, the kingfishers chattering again, and he was more than ready to be out of their territory. All the slow easy softness of the night before seemed to have been shredded away, like fingernails through tulle.
Slowly, all three of them turned to stare at him. That had definitely caught their attention.
Sam’s eyes were closed in a moment of meditative quiet, mind settled by the steady chug of the engine, so he did not catch the way Dean reached out and scratched at the back of Cas’ head, how his fingers trailed down the back of Cas’ neck and down his spine. At the bottom his fingers splayed and smoothed back up, each vertebrae bumping under his palm. A hundred dips and valleys, the whole of the Ozarks displayed for him to touch, and other wonders, all the wonders of the world on one back.
Cas yawned, and sat up, stirring Dean awake. The room was dim and cool in the thin mist-drenched sunlight, the kind of half-hearted morning that meant rain later, and much of it. The angel rubbed sleep from his eyes.
“Well?” Dean said sharply, holding his arm out towards the man’s retreating back.
“Dean, let's go,” Sam said.
The river. The lights. The soft near-evening sky.
“Tomas will have those out for you – would you like chips too?”
“Well,” Cas said, “it's your blessing that matters most. To Dean and to me, I know.”
“Yes ma’am,” Dean finished, handing it to her. She swiped it for him and handed it back, looking up through her lashes.
“Oh, just the dreams,” she said, nonchalant, cocking out her hip as she stirred the hamburger in the pan. “Strange dreams. Nothin' more'n what I'm used to, of course, but more important this time round. Dreams about all kinds of people, but mostly you three and Grand-mère. She tells me all the rules.”
“And you?” Cas said, after a while. The air was cooling with the descent of night. “You're certain you want to marry something like me? All—in-between and not-quite-anything.”
“Well,” Cas said, looking at the ricocheting calamity behind the windows of Sugar Byrne's shop, “I found a Riverlander, and a place for us to sleep tonight. If that counts for anything.”
Sam brushed the hair from her face, behind her ear.
“All this time, and I didn’t know. Or maybe I did – maybe I did and I just didn’t realize,” Dean said, voice slipping into a ramble, an excess of thoughts jumbling out of his mouth.
The words rose up to meet him, gently black against the yellowed paper, years and years and years old, and the words older still—there was age in every serif, every paragraph, ancient and incredible age, and it spoke.
"Well, alright," she said tentatively, her power chair rolling back from the table.
They pushed back from the table and let Olivia kiss them goodnight, peppering their cheeks with soft touches, Baby heavy round her stooped shoulders.
There was a heavy moment of pause. The phone’s weight fell back into Dean’s fingers as Cas sat slightly behind him, both of them considering it.
“We shouldn't stay out too long,” Sam said, but without any firmness in his voice. He was staring at it, at the smoky suggestion of the rain beginning to fall up ahead from its vast underbelly.
“I’ll be watching you, too, alright? You’ve got somebody to look after you. You’re not doin’ it alone.”
They were regarded by the sleepy-eyed windows as they opened the dusty rooms and dumped their gear inside. It was obvious that the place didn’t get very much traffic. The bed sheets were stiff, and though there was nothing particular that gave it away, there was a character to the furniture that spoke of age and solitude and a few stray travelers once in a blue moon.
“Where do the trees come in, is what I’m wondering,” Dean sighed, stretching his arm against the Impala’s hard roof, grimacing. “Were they put in before or after all this?”
"Sam?"
His eyes drifted closed and she moved her hands to his shoulders, turning him around to face the embankment. He took a breath.
Cas drew himself up. “We have some questions for you.”
“S-sorry,” he said, and Dean rubbed his eyes.
He laughed. Sighed.
, and they watched the trio leave the house, climb down the porch steps towards the Impala gleaming gloss-black under the pale summer sun.
Cas was standing in the middle of the floor, taking it all in, and when he turned to face Dean he was smiling, gently.
“Dean,” Cas said, softly, and his pale hand came to rest on Dean's knee.
He swallowed.
She straightened up and shook them out; she’d need to press them. She didn’t know why she’d waited so long for his clothes. Maybe it was the fear she wouldn’t be able to find ones to fit him. Castiel’s had been much easier – he could slip into just about anything. The pants she’d given him were a little loose, but Angelique’s old suspenders would fix that just fine.
"Do you need me to help you?"
“You already have me,” Cas breathed.
"You all look so scared, poor babes," she said, soothing, after a moment. "I have what you need, don't make such sad eyes!" She tamped her cane again and then turned to go back into the house. "You come along in and we'll have a meal! Your Grand-mère fixed you a good supper!"
They’d chosen the first door they’d come to: a decently sized room with faded wallpaper and heavy walnut furniture and two chairs that must have at one point belonged to a dining set. The quilt on the bed was thin enough for the summer and Dean immediately cracked the window looking out to the back, stopping a moment to press his forehead against the cool pane and stare down at the dark back garden. He could make out the vague shapes of the trees and the laundry posts and the sagging weight of the calico dress on the line and the muddled, hunched mounds of the flower beds.
“He had a book on him when he died. The Riverlands Hymnal.”
She pursed her lips and rolled her eyes.
“I can’t believe you can’t
Sam came inside.
He flipped past this title page and scanned the flowery script. Miraculously, much of it was readable despite the heavy water damage on the front.
They found her name in a phone book - a round, beautiful name. Olivia Delacroix. Even the plain standard printing couldn't erase the old dignity from it; it stood out, affected by something ancient and mysterious.
“And you think Amos Porter’s religion is the reason?”
“Oh, he does that too. 'Specially during harvest time, but that’s really my uncle Clint’s business. That man’s got two loves: gin and peaches. Daddy just minds the store during the off season.” She said the last bit on a sigh, climbing out of the cab and jumping down; Sam hurried to do the same, caught in the moment.
A long pause fell. It seemed as if the walls were caving in, as if something in one fell swoop had stolen away the road, and all of it—the upswing of it, the facts of the binder of miracles, of werewolves sustaining silver wounds, of old magic and old fairytales. As if it had all been torn down around them, any chance or hope of something beautiful finding them, finally, and all of Dean's apprehensions inflated, filling the room, squeezing the breath out of them.
“Do you love her?” Cas asked, intent, and Sam cleared his throat.
"They wouldn't have to be unhappy in a long-term sense...just a short term. Enough to maybe walk away, to walk down to the river, maybe to clear their heads." Cas pulled the articles out and scanned them all again, slapping pages down onto the tabletop. "They fight with their lover, hypothetically, and walk away for a while, and then they go missing, and their bodies are dredged up."
Dean’s mind was blank except for that one muddy thought flicking back and forth through the murky recesses of his brain.
“Hmm?” Dean fixed his eyes back on the angel standing a few steps away.
Sam and Cas, of course, heard nothing.
“You stars,” Sugar said, fondly, reaching up with a wet finger to gently touch Castiel's cheek, smiling sadly. “Always so good at reading the faces you see.”
big and bad.”
Sam's voice trailed over the yard. “Come on, guys, let's hit the road!”
“We were wondering if we could talk to you about the trees,” Cas said, tone at least more well-intentioned than Dean’s.
In a state of some bewilderment Chuck went about his morning; he showered, shaved, put on something clean for once, and decided—much to his own surprise—that it felt like a nice morning for a walk. He spared his glowing computer screen only one glance before he slipped on his autumn jacket and ventured out onto the cracked and weedy sidewalks.
"And I can still make the best beignets in Louisiana." Her eyes crinkled in delight.
Dean and Castiel stepped closer to one another, watching the boy raise his fist in the air triumphantly.
“At the end of the story,” Dean said, near-stammering but holding his ground, “it says—the star and the catfish become human. They get—married.”
!” she said, by way of correction, flashing him a view of her wedding band, and Cas smiled gently back. “But you can just call me Sugar, that’s what everyone calls me anyway.”
, that is—nee Francis. They both sported rings on their fingers. They'd gotten married halfway back, at some courthouse in the middle of nowhere, and although Castiel's response was to raise his eyebrows at the new and sudden addition to the family, both he and Dean couldn't fathom anything to be bewildered about. They welcomed her with open arms and knowing smiles, all five-foot-four and towering smile of her, into the Impala's back seat, and east to the house that would be theirs, with nothing but one suitcase to her name.
She paused a moment, took a deep breath; she ran her lacquered nails under her lower lip. Her oxygen trembled on her tongue.
“Yeah,” Sam said, quietly. “I guess you're right.”
“Because I decided,” she tutted, flicking her ash into a saucer, and it very well could have ended there, but she tapped her nail against the table, eyes narrowing in thought. “That room is no good for the likes of you. No spirit in that room,” she said, and her gaze drifted out the window and then back to the faces seated around her table.
“Yeah.” She smiled, biting at her lip again, shoulders dipping. She felt almost proud. “I get you.”
“You know,” he said, “if it weren't for you...I don't think we'd have made it here.”
“There are billions of those damn things,” Dean said. “Pretty freakin' huge wedding.”
“I had all the confidence in you,” he said, and smiled, and his eyes twinkled, dark and mysterious.
Cas’ breath stopped. His eyes closed.
“Yeah.” He laughed a little, but it was short and fell quiet soon.
Divine. There was no other word for it. Even without Cas' bias, Dean had always been an outstanding representation of his kind. Now it was illuminated even more than ever in the easy motions he made: the glide of his muscles under his skin as they worked, his stance, his confident steps. Once the wall had been erected, Dean had clamored for another opportunity to help, and Cas smiled, glad that he had found some kind of respite from the activity, a reprieve from the other stressful thoughts that had been swimming around in their heads for weeks.
"Holy shit," he whispered, unable to believe what he was reading.
Dean reached over and tipped more of the bottle of leftover warm wine into the glass beside them, taking a long sip and offering it back to Cas. He held the cup for him, Cas’ fingers holding his wrists, and when he was finished he smiled at Dean over the edge and gently guided it towards the counter. Dean’s hands suddenly were busy stroking his face.
Carefully he said, “We've been hearing a lot about catfish.”
At once, all three hunters sat up a little straighter; Dean leaned forward, Sam looked startled, and Cas continued watching Lily's face, as if he were trying to puzzle out what lay behind it.
“Just a lot of ectoplasmic gunk under their nails,” Dean said. “And—”
“Let your love grow tall.”
Dean ran a hand over his face and slumped a little against the leather seat. He didn't know why, really, they were making such a big deal of this. After the last—failure, he supposed, between Hartman and the Ozarks, they'd hardly said a kind word to each other, had hardly even been able to bear looking at each other. They'd crawled into the shower together that night, washed off the filth of what they'd done, and gone to bed, hadn't even bothered with apologies. What could apologies have done, anyway?
Now what did they have? Just a little more of the same old story. A wedding, now. What the hell did that even mean? And it was still there, the lingering question none of them had been brave enough to broach or admit to—what it all had to do with Dean.
They drove for hours. Stopped more frequently than was probably necessary. Whenever they pulled over, for gas, for food, to stretch their legs, they kept close together, as if afraid of the distance that might arise should they wander too far. Cas touched Dean whenever they were in the open air, near-constantly. Kept a hand on his knee in the greasy, quiet diner where they stopped for lunch. Kissed his neck while he dawdled near the gas pump. Cast him long and generous and loving, worried looks whenever their eyes happened to meet.
A casual shift closer, nothing unnatural, a gesture of invitation with the tilt of their heads, the silent dare to do something and a snap and a growl of desire as soon as they touched.
“A tea house?” Dean groaned. He could just imagine it – Cas and Sam making him cram into some hoity-toity lace nightmare. He could already smell wilting roses and hear the judgmental titters of old women with dead things glued to the brims of their hats. He shivered and leaned over to toss his empty chip bag into the trashcan on the sidewalk. He shook his leg out restlessly and stretched his back, spine twisting stiffly, refusing to pop.
He got to his feet, pulled his suit jacket from the back of the library chair. Cas didn't move. He was still looking down at the articles, hands splayed white and spider-like on the surface of the table.
“Good three-hour drive.”
“Dean?”
and his hand fell to Dean's arm to stay it. Sam stepped in front of him, shielding the boy, almost, and they waited until Yann looked up from his hands. His face was corpse-white and he was shaking, visibly, looking at them all now not with anxiety but fear.
Hopelessly human. Hopelessly lovely in the vulnerable way only intimacy could appreciate.
“I have to talk about
“I understand,” Yann stammered. “I understand him perfectly. It’s terrible to have to be someone you don’t want to be.”
“I’m so terribly sorry,” she began. “It’s – it’s not an insult. Tommy isn’t being mean. He’s just confused. The catfish, he is…”
“You've been very tense,” Cas said, pulling Dean out of his reverie.
“I just need a break, Sam! Jesus.”
He glanced sideways, uncomfortably aware of Castiel's warmth next to him.
Cas swallowed thickly.
Sam took the cup in his hands, looking at Cas and his brother. Dean was staring at his as if it were going to leap up and swallow him instead of the other way around, and Cas was examining the ceramic. Sam took a breath and drank.
“Come on, Sam, are you seriously believing this? It’s all coincidence! Even this is coincidence, and a few months from now we’ll be back here cleaning up his mother’s body.”
Nate nodded and leaned back in his chair, folding his hands over his flat stomach, thumbs caught in the straps of his suspenders. So old-fashioned, Sam thought.
Some nebulous force standing in front of him, holding out its hands full of good intentions, the fact that he always meant well, that he was just
. How fine he was, how strong, how beautiful, how good and glorious.
It echoed strangely through the room at an unexpected pitch, a remnant perhaps of the angel's true voice, and both brothers took a step back as the lights over their heads sputtered and flashed. One or two of the bulbs popped and the room dipped down into cold.
“I'm okay,” Dean replied. “If you were gonna ask.”
“Well now,” she said, mouth pulling back, her teeth gleaming in the dim corridor. “Let’s see what we can do to make a proper groom out of you!”
“You'd rather be shooting things than relaxing a little? Following up on something that's not got death written all over it?”
The way that Sugar kept looking at him, across the table, in small glances, had confirmed it, at least in his mind. Whatever it was, it had to do with him. There was too much pity and longing in her face for it to be anything otherwise.
Cas sighed. “She—looked like she recognized me. That's all. And after that she was—very
“That book was important enough—
He snapped his cell shut and stuffed it in his pocket.
Dean’s face moved into faint surprise at their proximity and Cas, too sleep-deprived to tolerate whatever excuse Dean could come up with, closed the distance between their mouths in one motion. He missed slightly, landing on the corner of Dean’s lips.
"It's as bad as you think it is," the former angel mumbled, a dark blush gathering on his cheeks. "It really is, Sam." His voice was a croak, and their pace slowed to something more manageable.
“I think it's sweet,” Cas said. “Sam looks so lonely sometimes.”
Dean smiled, tearing off a piece of the chicken and holding out for Cas to take. Dean ate his own piece, leaning between Cas’ legs where he sat on the counter, head back against the upper cabinets.
“May I just thank you again for staying with us,” Sugar said, touching fingers lightly to her mouth. “It isn't often we get a chance to extend our hospitality to strangers, much less strangers asking such big questions!”
Cas looked up, and his eyes caught the sharp peaks of a roof above the sycamores and birches, but it quickly disappeared as they drove deeper. Arrowwoods bloomed on the slopes and a wild turkey scattered into the underbrush as they drove past, disrupting the white flowers.
,” he said, he whispered—he stumbled a little on the formality of it but kept on. “
do?” Sam asked, as she stepped up onto the curb beside him.
Yann shook his head in disagreement. "Not just that - she's making this big thing! It's really something."
“Should probably put clothes on if we're going downstairs.”
“Lily, I’m not asking you to wait for me, okay, but maybe—if this all turns out…if things end up okay—”
“I’m sure it’s miserable,” Sugar said, nodding, slipping the egg off onto a plate and cracking another into the pan with a practiced flick of her wrist. “Oh, but they did have such a good time last night. You could see in their sweet faces how much they needed it. Everything must be trembling under their feet, getting them all so worked up.”
Cas lay with his cheek resting on Dean’s arm, settled close to him, counting the inches his fingers crossed as they wandered over his husband’s body. They paused every once in a while, having minds of their own, as if to admire some distraction on a garden path, rubbing and nudging at the creases and rounded places they met.
were too big. They weren’t going to fit into a shoebox anymore. Hadn’t Dean noticed? They were bleeding well past the borders of whatever frame their lives had previously been assigned. He had to know – he had to know because he was nearly jumping out of his skin, pretending no one else had noticed.
Yann blinked at him, and then blinked nervously at the brothers, and then fixed his eyes stolidly on the floor.
Sam caught his gaze and turned.
have anything to say about the book?”
“She said she kept it clean for people. Not only us,” Cas said, watching the anxiety creep over Dean’s features. “She hardly could have known about us, Dean.”
“What will you do now?” said Death, to break the noisy silence.
He was drunk on the sight of him, the feel of him when he finally drew his cock into his mouth, alive and full. His fingers smoothed over Cas’ hips, keeping him still for the moment, anticipating the sudden jerk from the body beneath him. Dean kept him buried in his mouth and breathed, pulled off, circled the head, slid down again, eyes opening to glance up at the face of his husband. Cas was staring at him, hands clenching on the sheets, opening and coming to rest on the back of his head. His pink mouth was slack and his red chest rose with every pull of Dean’s lips over him.
“I feel happy,” he said. “I feel happy. And crazy – and I love him.”
“Sure—sure! Yeah, that'd be great, uh—”
Cas shifted to let him in, and they kissed there in the mud with the lantern of their marriage swinging in their hands above their heads as the dusk dripped in like ink from the east, and within their skeletons it seemed two kindred things moved against their ribs and reached out, and that they touched within the touching of their lips. Reunited, finally, at last, at long last.
Easy strokes of his hand around Cas’ cock, open-mouthed kisses at his neck, the stutter, and Cas clenched, gripped him, held him, and then white.
“Is that him?” he said, and Sam shook his head loose of flowers, Cas curling his fingers around a bloom and then letting it go to the wind again. They all trained their eyes to the feeble frame of an old, old man moving slowly between the trees, carrying a pair of heavy shears under one arm. He stopped, lifting them up over his head, and snipped, pruning meticulously at the branches dripping with flowers above him.
. Only
“You know how to two-step?” he asked over the noise, and Cas moved closer to him in order to hear.
Cas was holding his hand so tightly under the table that he thought he might burst with it.
“I don't know what happened,” Cas said, breathing thinly. He sounded exhausted and confused. His eyes rolled up to the ceiling and his shoulders relaxed as if in defeat. Sam felt a twinge of pain in his stomach. “We—it was awful.”
The next thing he knew, Sam was yanking Rosa’s hands off of him and Cas had grabbed his arm and pulled so hard his shoulder burned, ignoring as best they could the small anguished sounds the girl was making behind them.
“Yeah, yeah,” he half-laughed, following Dean with his eyes as he trailed out of the kitchen and into the hallway.
Dean glanced back at Sam as if to say
Whistling, just a little, Elohim took his leave.
Corinthian met his eyes again, from under his brow.
“Dean,” he said. “This is Cas.”
Cas watched Dean’s back as he put his wallet back into his pocket, turning around and raising his eyebrows at him.
“So,” Cas began, glancing away from Dean’s stormy face. “The birds?”
“I don’t care about that! I want this to be good! I don’t want to fight everything all the time! I want to kiss you without hurting you, is that so much to fucking ask?”
And breathless.
Celeste finished making up the food and divvied it out onto plates, heaping it all onto three and leaving only a spare bit for herself. Cas stood to help her carry them to the miniscule and sagging table, but she waved him back to his seat, balancing them expertly.
“Happy?”
“We need more gas or we can't start puttin' the sidin' up!"
Dean tapped his finger on the counter impatiently, Cas hovering beside him, hands dug deep in his pockets.
Dean's fingers were cold but not unpleasant, circling him, palming at his sides and coming to rest against his back, the sharp lines of his pelvis, the bony protrusion of his spine. Dean kissed him and kissed him until Cas pulled back for oxygen, gasping,
One day, someday, he might actually be as old as she was. He’d never really planned on that, but now, it was such a great possibility. Old with Cas and Sam, grey and grizzled and grumpy, if Bobby’s example was anything to go by.
She didn't say anything, and he took it as his cue to continue, wishing he hadn't thrown the Snickers bar away. He'd like to have something to cram into his mouth that wasn't his foot.
“Why are they called Riverlands people?” Cas asked, quietly, in the silence that followed.
Dean and Cas exchanged another glance and Dean nodded his thanks.
The plastic cup dangled in his fingers, spotted with water, in the doorway of the bathroom.
"Hardly an old woman," Dean said, and her blush deepened, her hand coming to her mouth once more. She turned her head to look at him sideways, shy and old-fashioned. He grinned at her, and Cas was compelled to reach across the small space between himself and Dean and touch his hand where it rested on the hunter's knee. Though he loved all the many facets of Dean, this one - the charming, wholesome, dear one - was one of his most treasured favorites.
A gesture of welcome to the guests.
Loose and open bodies angled into one another on the bed, the sheets stirring in the soft wind that pulled itself into the room, smoothing their skin. Not a deep sleep but a restful one, and when they woke a little while later from the shallowness of it they turned their heads to look out the dark space of the window, and saw the pinpricked stars making their dancing way across the sphere of the sky.
Cas stumbled back, pulled Dean down—or was pushed? And fallen upon—they were careening, mountainside catastrophe, Castiel's hands still holding Dean's face until he felt the tug of his T-shirt under his arms and came apart, lifted his hands away so that Dean could wrestle it off of him, leave his chest bare and pale and quick with breath under the obnoxious light. A pause of only the smallest naked instant and Dean looked down at him, dim-headed, trailed one hand down the path of Castiel's sternum, brushed against the pink buds of his nipples and then down again, catapulting, seizing his mouth hard. Cas arched, back coming up from the mattress, able only to whimper into Dean's mouth, frustrated that Dean's body was so high above him, he needed, he needed something to press into, the new and throbbing heat between his legs, straining against his jeans, terrifying and exhilarating all at once. He wrapped bare arms around Dean's neck and pulled him down, teeth and tongues crashing, competing, Dean's grip on his shoulders so tight and sharp that he felt the dig of nails into his skin, couldn't care.
“Well hey there!” she called cheerfully to the crowd. “Sure is dark!” She laughed, staring around theatrically. “I’m about blind as a fish in the mud! How about we light a few lamps up here, Andrew!”
“Help you with what?” Cas chimed in, sounding significantly more interested in the proceedings of the hour than he had in anything all evening. His injured leg was stuck out stiff in front of him. “A case?”
“Rosa!”
, but God, if they could just fishhook their fingers just right then none of it would matter.
Cas grumbled something, and Dean stared at the screen. He didn’t realize he’d sunk to the bed till the mattress squeaked, and Cas sat up, squinting at him over his shoulder.
“Terrible things?” Sam echoed, and he exchanged glances with Dean.
Cas had brought back fast food through the aether, and as soon as he saw Dean his face dropped into a look of concern. Dean waved off the question on the angel's face and gave him a tight smile, trying to quell the curling snake of confusion in his chest.
He swallowed, the harsh afterburn of whiskey still lingering in his throat.
Something shifted uneasily in Dean's stomach, and he wasn't sure why. They both knew perfectly well what Sam was getting at, but neither of them wanted to say it out loud. They both knew, as well, that Sam would be nothing but supportive either way. The uneasiness seemed a bit ridiculous, but it existed all the same.
Cas smiled, let his hand rest against Dean's throat for a moment, and then they slipped out of the guest room to follow Sam down the stairs into the early evening.
Everything about that night, Cas thought, had been so simple. So easy. To dance with Dean, to lead him, to wrestle into bed with him, to kiss him. It felt the way that orders had felt, once, in Heaven. Un-extraordinary and wondrous.
“God's handiwork,” Cas said simply. “And it reminds me of home.”
“Thank you, baby,” she replied, in her high, honeyed voice. “It’s my own personal universe!”
“Lily, I’ll—”
He didn't have to think much about what he did next—merely acted, pulling Cas in tight in a hug so all-encompassing that Cas thought he might drown in it. He returned the embrace, face pressed against Sam's shoulder, their palms flat against one another's backs.
They found the highway in the pouring rain—south, along the river, to Missouri, and wherever the old god had claimed they'd wind up next.
"You find anything?" Sam said, looking up from the obituary he'd been reading.
“Okay—and what makes you think this book has anything to do with this? I mean, what if it's just coincidence?”
“Did she say where, exactly?” Sam prodded. “Where on the river?”
“You know I did.” In the dim orange light Castiel's eyes were sloe-dark and starry, heavy-lidded. “I told you. It made me happy.”
,” Dean said, nearing the shore, now, walking as if he were only now remembering how to walk, “
Or so the story goes.
“…hello?” came her irritated drawl. “I swear if this is you punks callin’ to ask about my tits again I’m gonna call your mothers.”
He didn't have to bid the words to come, or make them up. They were already there, like ink on the back of his tongue.
“Do you know where the book is?” Cas repeated, his voice glassy.
He just couldn’t get her out of his head. Miles and hours away from her and she was the first thing on his mind the minute he couldn’t sleep. He barely knew her. He’d met countless girls in countless towns, but this one had stuck on him, had woven herself into his pulse, somehow.
He lifted the cup to his lips and took a small sip, eyes closing. He smiled and replaced it on the table, motioning for them to do the same.
“I’m sorry,” Cas croaked. “I’m sorry.”
Sam was heading back into Dubois. They weren’t going to stay. They’d go somewhere else. Get across the river. Get far away from that breed of crazy, whatever it was.
He flushed and tripped backwards up the stairs, watching Dean slip out the front door, there and gone, a blink of light and then a shadow swallowed up into the darkness of the lawn. Cas turned and climbed the stairs, focusing on the softness of the wood under his palm. Broken in, worn down, soft, an easy glide.
"Anything else out of the ordinary?" he asked the coroner shortly, wanting to get out of the enclosed space as soon as possible. The grey walls were hideously drab, and the whole room was a tight fit. He felt like a little kid knocking around in a cupboard under the sink, everything bent up out of its natural state. The bruises under his clothes weren't helping, either.
Sam nodded. “The woman said he lived up here with his dog and his granddaughter. Maybe she helps?”
Sam's eyes widened and his face collapsed into a soft smile as Cas' shy eyes found his.
There was a pause before his voice came in, surprised.
They walked in silence, not really going anywhere, until Lily perked up at the sound of music bleeding through the wall of a tent they passed. She stopped, and forced Sam to back track with her so they could look inside.
“I'm—I'm really glad to have you, Cas.”
He opened the door to a tiny foyer, enclosed, and one more door separating him from the main shop. A bell hung over it, and above the door in careful hand painted letters was the phrase:
“I’ve been doing this job for a while,” she said, breaking the silence. They listened, unable to do anything else, enraptured. “I see all the gory parts of people. Love them in those gory ways everyone seems so ashamed of.”
“I’ll trust the other with you till it’s time then,” she said to Sam, nodding towards a Dean-distracted Cas.
"Nothing really," the plain-faced coroner said, tapping the steel-topped gurney. "Well, except, maybe—there is this one—Miss Quinn.” He ambled over to one of the bodies and lifted up her hand, turning it palm up. "One of them odd tattoos. I've seen it come through here before a few times."
“Hey, don’t mention it. You get to have the happy ending too, dreamboat. Lily or no Lily.”
“I promise.”
“...dance?” Sam repeated.
She nodded, sagely.
. His love, forsaken and abandoned, left to wait on so many shores, unsatisfied, unresolved, waiting, watching, praying for the day the darkness would ease and the light would take its place. How he had waited—he had been patient and steady, he had been steadfast and strong, he had
The dull gold latch clicked and the door heaved open and there was a light noise as a woman pulled it back. A rectangle of gold spilled onto them from the foyer; what must have been Mattie Lawrence let her hand fall from the doorknob.
The green hills rose up on either side, the trees deep in summer-time vibrancy and heavy with leaves. They had gotten off on some byway to look for a gas station and known they were approaching a town because of the suddenly reduced speed limit, slowing their easy seventy-five to a creeping thirty in a matter of feet.
There was still night to be had in the apartment, and after the long supper she told them with soft insistence to stay awhile, and get some sleep when they liked. She and Cas cleared away the plates, and she made them coffee, brought out a bag of Chips Ahoy, and they sat around her tiny table and talked.
They said nothing.
“Yeah, I figured as much,” Sam sighed, and the three of them passed through the gap in the fence where the orchard began. People were everywhere, climbing ladders to get peaches; the trees were still dripping with them, despite it being the beginning of the second week of the festival. Sam shrugged his shoulders; Dean had stopped, looking around for someone to talk to.
“Well,” Dean said, rambling, and she shushed him again.
“Yann's been telling me all about you,” said a woman's voice; Cas finally caught up to them and slipped into what looked like a small dining room, behind Dean.
“That was...really nice,” Sam said, sounding a little startled, as they started down the steps, past the wind-chimes making soft sounds by the door. “Weird—but nice.”
“My tea is a very special tea,” the old man said. The cups had been cleared away; the table was empty between them. “It gives you what you need.”
Glorious warmth of Cas' body against his, the softness of his mouth and his fingers and Dean’s hands threading into his hair and smoothing over his forehead and cheeks and down his neck, tipping his face up to look at him.
He felt for the door handle and let his weight fall against the wood, the door swinging in. He took Dean’s hands, wove their fingers together, the sun already begging to touch him, splaying at his back, haloing his head.
Cas nodded. He looked down into the shallow water underneath them, swaying and shivering under the dock lantern light. He wondered if there were fish in that mud, minnows or skating water beetles. Or catfish.
Dean knew he was staring at Cas' mouth, but Sam wasn’t looking, and he indulged.
Heat prickled at the back of his eyes and he took a short, gasping breath. He would not cry. He bit at the inside of his cheek. Damn humanity. Damn the nauseating swirl of emotions in his gut. There was nothing enviable about this. It was crude and useless.
“I almost wish we were butterflies and liv'd but three summer days. Three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.”
to know about the trees it should be him. Apparently he’s, like, ancient too. Been here since the dawn of time, or something.”
“Lofty dreams,” Dean muttered, and much to their surprise, Yann grinned, chuckling again.
“So—someone had to collect all those souls.”
Sam swallowed, flushed, looked down. He felt Dean and Castiel's eyes on him, a little wider than normal with the truth of it.
“It's only that you asked if we'd met,” he continued, quietly. “And last night I heard you call us
“Dean?”
,” said Castiel, barely a whisper; “
Sam opened his phone and stared at the screen, and then closed it, and pocketed it. He got up and went inside to find his brother and Castiel.
"You know how to throw your weight well?"
That December the petals had never fallen. They froze, suspended in ice for weeks, but with the thaw they shook themselves out in all their splendor, the air fragrant with their scent, and the whole town had marveled.
“Remember those primary works I mentioned? I found a few things, scattered all up and down—stuff from hunters. I guess wherever this guy went and preached his New Gospel or whatever, there was a pattern. Every-goddamn-thing paranormal high-tailed it out of there for at least two months in his wake. Like nothin' nobody'd ever seen. Not surprised they made note of it. 'Course, it all went back to normal after he died, but it happened. People noticed. Our kind of people.”
To Cas’ surprise she shook her head.
“It’s alright,” she drawled, her face impassive.
“Did you smile?” Cas asked Dean jokingly, and Dean shrugged, wandering away from the photographer towards the dance floor, hands shoved in his pockets. He turned his back to Cas, waiting, and Marcus shook the picture out vigorously under the bright light, standing in front of the dark sheet, and then went to the wall to tack it up.
The reaper paused a moment, realizing he had been summoned, that he was now where he hadn't been a moment ago; carefully his eyes shifted, drawing from Castiel's stoic face to the two Winchesters (who had no idea where to look) to the dusty, claustrophobic motel room, and finally to the painted symbols around his feet, anchoring him in place.
It was supposed to have been
“I'd rather not be operating under the impression that this has anything to do with
Sheriff Earl Jones was an honest man. He was prone to giving the benefit of the doubt, as well, but it didn’t take much convincing once they showed him the baseball.
When Sam didn’t move, focused on opening the Impala's door, she looked around and hastily jogged away from the corner, towards the car. She pulled the netted sleeves of her shirt over her hands as she ran on her teetering shoes, her skirt riding up a little and showing off the top of her thigh over her pale-purple stockings. She was a gaudy mess, all mismatched bright colors and ratty hair piled high on her head, smeared mascara and fake gemstones missing from each of her earrings.
“Hey—yeah. Hey, Lily.”
Lily pressed the phone into her shoulder for a moment, shimmying up and onto the counter in the dimness.
Her name was Celeste. At least, that was the name that she gave them, and when she smiled her Day-Glo pink lipstick made her teeth seem unnaturally white. Her face was slightly rounded – puffy from poor nutrition. Her name was Celeste, she said, and she knew them. Had been waiting for them for some time.
“Uh—yeah...”
Not sharp.
being werewolves.”
“Miss—Everhardt,” Cas said, carefully, catching another glimpse at her name-tag; she turned her squint-eyed face to him and smiled again. “Could you tell me if there's any—connection? Between the kingfishers and the flood?”
White and blue, and every shade of brightness in between. Coiling and seething, pulsing and pulling with the movement of his breath, clouding against his lips. And rising, rising upward like heat in winter, drifting into the air above his head. Curling, soft, soundless.
so long for the one in the water, for the one asleep, for the hollow thing that would catch and carry him.
They were headed for the drug store, the store closest to the three older men, and it was easy to see why: a Coke machine stood by the front door selling bottles for a quarter. While most of the herd flocked to the machine, digging in their pockets for change, one stayed back in the street and raised the baseball over his shoulder.
Dean faced front again in the booth seat.
Riverlanders, then, too—stars and catfish, and crazy kids in podunk towns clinging to his leg and calling him that. Catfish. And now he was, apparently, driving straight through a Hitchcock movie, and his dumb little brother and oblivious angel couldn't even hear the birds that were screeching along after them.
. Like a little lamp in the air over their heads, sputtering but shining.
“What does that mean, exactly?”
“Oh, I’m sure it ain’t!” the woman cried. “Oh, look at what you’ve done to my pop machine! You just wait, I’m gonna call Earl! He’ll deal with this. You
It sounded almost Irish, full-bore folk, the music that was coming down from the bandstand where Sugar and her husband and their friends were playing. The microphone was bad, and Sugar's words were muffled, but from what Sam could tell she wasn't singing in English.
“How old are you?” Cas asked, brow furrowed in thought.
“Promise me,” Dean whispered against Cas’ ear, soft and pleading. “Promise me as soon as this is done I can have you. I want you – please, Cas, I’m gonna lose my mind…”
The boys all turned as a group, panic-stricken.
But all three were looking at him intensely, waiting for the other shoe to drop; now that Cas had said something Dean and Sam could see it clearly on his face, something unsaid in the lines of the boy's mouth.
“Don't—” Dean looked at him, sharp, and Cas gently withdrew his hand from his leg. “Don't. Until we know for sure, I'm treating it like something big and bad. Because it's
“Did she say where we might find one of those people?” Cas asked, sinking down onto the bed he and Dean had silently claimed.
,” Dean insisted, laughing. “Or I’ll go nuts.”
“Well—” Sam hesitated, letting his hand slip a little further around the angel's shoulders, an awkward motion of comfort. “I mean, I'm no expert, but—it was the first time, right? For you, at least, I think.” He couldn't believe this conversation was happening. But seeing Cas in this much distress was twisting something in his stomach. “It's never perfect the first time. You guys'll figure it out.”
Red water; blood of the land, rising to meet him.
,” the man continued. “It’s just – you all said you came down 79?”
Sam stared at him a moment, his hands still uncertain of themselves in midair, and then he smiled, just a little bit, just softly.
“Father Jacobson is at a conference in Ohio this week, I'm afraid, if you're here for Reconciliation.”
Dean's hand squeezed his, tight, and Dean sighed as if yet another weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
"Is this house a gift? You said it was for newlyweds," Castiel said, sizing the structure from afar. He watched a man measure the cut out space of a window on a wall that had already been put up. It was a compact floor plan, not the wild sprawl of the house on the ridge. This was a modest little framework, mapped by close rooms and intimate spaces.
When they regrouped in town later with David and Dean, any tension that had been relieved in their time apart flew back as soon as Cas and Dean were within earshot of each other. At least, Sam thought, they'd stopped glaring at each other—now they just avoided one another's eyes, focusing on lampposts or birds or on someone else's face.
Sam swayed with her, felt the way she moved against him, the softness of her curves under his hands, the way she hadn’t moved her mouth more than a few inches from his.
“Where did the book go?” he said, voice thick and shaken.
Sam swerved into the gravel on the side of the road, and Cas popped the door open, stepping out onto the asphalt. Dean followed, swaying on his feet, and Cas watched as he rounded the Impala and stumbled down the ditch-bank out of sight, presumably to retch into the trees.
Cas paused, pulling his T-shirt off his arms, letting it drop to the floor.
Yes, an avalanche. That was the word for it. They were shy until the door opened, eyes lowered and feet scuffling, gazes darting, smiles trading. Lights on, fuzzing, flickering, fluorescent. The number 16 in faux brass on the wood of the door. The metal buffer of where the concrete met the carpet, the gentle snick of the outside world sealing off, and Dean's hand on his waist.
Cas suggested the Ferris wheel afterwards, but Dean, ever-wary of heights, shook his head. Instead they stood on the grass with parents waiting for their children to come off the wheel, watching it spin slowly and carefully in the sky, aglitter with lights like stars. Higher still in the deepening indigo of the twilight the real stars were coming out in force, shining in the unpolluted atmosphere like some unfathomable road map pricked with a million pins.
Cas sat up straighter, abruptly, finding his voice again in the midst of Dean’s tirade.
Matsu Kami nodded. “Of a kind.”
“Earth to Cas,” Dean said. “Come on, m'starved.”
Corinthian huffed, rolling his eyes to the ceiling, as if he were fighting back the urge to spill. Finally, after a long tense moment of silence, in which Castiel could see him struggling with it, weighing his options, entirely aware of the fact that he was trapped, and that the only way he was getting out was if he were
Infidelity, Sam had said. It seemed the most likely scenario. Gently Cas ran his fingers over the hanging shirts, rustling the hangers on their rod, and then he paused. Reached in and plucked a long brown hair from the collar of one of them.
“What girl?” he stuttered, a flush instantly coming to his face.
"I don't know. I believe some pretty unbelievable things," she murmured, with a sort of half-laugh in the back of her throat, and when he closed his eyes he could imagine her beside him, the two of them leaning against the bench, side to side.
It was sparse and spare; a few silk wall hangings and mats that were soft under their socked feet; they could see a small hallway with rooms to one side and then the back room lined with traditional screens and the silhouette of a man smoking a long pipe, watching the river through the open back of the house. He knelt comfortably at a low table, feet tucked under him, his loose pants and tunic shirt shifting as he did, pulling on his pipe and stretching idly. A small tea pot sat on the middle of the table, steam wafting from it, hovering and mingling with the smoke from his pipe in a violet cloud slowly pulling out of the house and into the open air.
While the scattered conversations leading up to stopping in that small slice of nowhere were filled with the charm of casual debates on where to sleep and eat, one could speculate it was really nothing more than the river’s will that landed them in that little valley.
Dean flushed, and Cas lifted his chin slightly, giving him a sideways glance, appraising the very feature the sheriff had cited.
“Not a hotel, but some real hospitable folk. At least, they should be. They don’t come down much but, they got a real queer religion up there and they fancy strangers.”
“And I—if...”
Catfish.
Dean stared at him a moment, and felt his face go dark again.
“Iowa,” Nate said, nodding. Dean looked at him sharply, Dubois ringing to life in his head again. “Le Beau,” he continued, and Dean relaxed, turning his face away again. “My, I'll tell you, it used to be stories from that place came upriver all the time. Terrible things.”
The receiver dragged and bumped against something and his breath stalled.
“Yikes,” Dean mumbled. “And if those letters on the desk up front were anything to go by, they were gonna get engaged soon.”
bad, and I don't think we want to sit on that and do nothing.”
Sam jerked when a hand found its way to his back. Olivia, her shawl pulled over her shoulders, shrouding her body, her head slightly bowed.
“I wasn't staring—”
His eyes traveled back to Dean. The heavy line of his legs and the gentle swell of sides at his hips and his stomach, the taut tendons of his neck, head tipped back, gazing up – up at the starlight.
“Don’t mention it.”
Sam deflated with relief; her hand slipped back to the strap of her purse. “I just want an interview, I swear. It’s nothing – nothing like that,” he stammered, and much to his surprise her lips curled into the most genuine smile he’d seen yet.
They unloaded into Cabin Eight—and found themselves distinctly at a loss for what else to do. There was no one to contact, nothing to examine, nothing to research. Sam tried to find something on the three-channel television, any kind of white noise to keep the anxiety at bay, but twenty minutes of infomercials only served to set them all even more on edge, and quietly he turned it off again.
“Let go,” Cas said, threat rumbling in the back of his voice. Behind the kitchen door the cooks and waiters were crowding into the threshold, staring at them, murmuring to themselves.
For a bewildered moment Cas thought Dean was going to shove him, or smack him, but instead Dean pulled him forward hard and caught him in his arms, and sank back down into the mud, holding Cas tight against his chest.
“Bobby, I just saw a werewolf withstand a silver knife. You’re gonna have to give me something.”
Soon.
swagger in his brother's step, or something like it from the angel, but instead he was greeted with averted eyes and what looked like a frankly miserable Dean, and an entirely miserable Castiel.
His mind was a jumble, and he knew it. Cas had insisted they'd work things through that night but he didn't see how they could. Only this morning the entire case—if it even
Sam was thankful for the lack of passerby as Cas launched into his tirade.
There was, Dean had to admit, a peace to this. Standing out over the water with his best friend, just admiring the view—the rolling green water, the bluffs across the way, trees still coming into their summer clothes; the pale strips of rock, the sounds of children and footpath-walkers and dogs trailing behind their backs. He could almost ignore the weight of the phone in his pocket waiting for Bobby to call back, or the memory of Yann's blood on the silver knife the night before still lingering in his mind. It felt like the first time in his life that he'd had this opportunity, to take a day off. Perhaps it was.
“We’ve followed it this far, Dean,” Sam said when they stopped for gas in some nowhere in-between town. They’d left Kentucky behind and were about to cross the river again. “No sense in stopping now.”
"What kind of old friends?" Castiel asked.
They sat down on the hard plastic bench that served as a waiting area, and Cas glanced sideways at Dean. The hunter's legs were jarring, bouncing up and down in excitement or agitation, it was impossible to tell. Quietly Cas slipped his hand across the space between them and let it rest on Dean's thigh.
Eventually the inevitable quiet of the small of night fell, and she told them to sleep, if they liked, for a few hours before the time came to move on from the towering presence of the big city. And so they did—Celeste pulled out a spare mattress from beneath her own, and Sam lay down there, on the floor beside her bed; Dean and Cas made themselves a nest of blankets on the sagging couch, and curled up there, and the apartment drifted into silence save for the gentle ticking of the clock in the kitchen.
“How?” Cas asked, looking up at Dean as they came to a stop by the corner.
“Good,” Dean said harshly, and out of habit he stared at Cas, still standing quietly by, watching and listening. “Anything to add? At all?”
“Dean. You need to dry off too. And see to your ankle—”
The gardener still did not reply but looked down at his little red dog and said something to it, his voice lightly scolding in an affectionate way.
cool,” the teenager began. “You were so cool – you were so great. Like – super. Like ultra great super cool – like, oh man, like – so cool.”
“Sam?”
“Explode?” Sam said, and Yann nodded.
She trailed off, attention diverted to the egg that was finally cooked enough to flip. She smiled in momentary victory: the yolk hadn’t run.
“Oh, that's alright, sweetheart,” Sugar said. Nate came in and left more dishes on the counter at her elbow and then went into the front of the house. “It was our pleasure. I tell you, nothing gives me more joy than hosting strangers. Peculiar, maybe, but it's what we do here.”
Cas’ knees slowly bending, his cheek pressed against Dean’s heartbeat. He sank to his knees on the ground, nuzzling at Dean’s stomach, the dip just under his breastbone, the swell of his hips. The shirt rustled and fell to the floor over Dean’s hands, and Cas slid his fingers into the metal clasp of his belt, pressed his face into the crease of his hip, hands tightening as they slid down the backs of Dean’s legs.
“Ever work the river?”
“About—”
“Just,” he said, trying for it, his mind a frenzy. “If we
“I flipped mostly to the end because everything else was pretty boring at first glance,” Sam said, a giddy sort of babble on the other end of the phone. “And then I ran the date of this guy's last entry against the timeline of this riverboat they were on,
Dean’s head on his shoulder, swaying – day lilies in the golden fields of Missouri, their heads nodding, clumps of calico aster, a house, a tall house…the taut pull of Dean’s shoulders under his hands as when he’d moved with that house-raising rope, pulling, effortless, easy.
Dean shook his head; he opened his mouth but no sound came out.
She nodded her head in satisfaction.
For a breathless moment there was silence—and then the slim hiss of the river; and then a sound like rain that gathered and built and broke and they realized, entrapped though they were in the gazes of one another, that it was applause; that Sam, and all the others, the few privy faces on the bank, were clapping, and then they were shouting, praises, it seemed, and Dean did not look at them, had eyes only for Castiel, and with his free arm he swung his grip round his waist and pulled him in tight and kissed him as he had never kissed another soul in his life.
"But when that long awaited day
Sam shook his head, pulling back and swiping violently at his eyes with the backs of his wrists.
Dean fidgeted in the lull and Cas pressed against his side, cheek against his shoulder, glancing up at all the lights strung overhead – a canopy of artificial stars, but beautiful nonetheless.
– I mean, like,
to each other—
, almost afraid, he found, to be disconnected for too long, dove back for another, the taste of Dean's mouth, the heavy wet taste of river air in his mouth when Cas licked inside, reciprocation, Dean tasting him, too. Dean's hands fumbling on his body, blunt fingernails leaving soft lines as if asking to be invited inside.
David, who looked only marginally more awake now than he had earlier, mentioned something about interviewing the witness who'd seen Sandra Eadie's ghost. There was a shuffling around the seats in the Impala—Dean and Cas ending up together in the back seat, much to their chagrin, and sitting awkwardly there with their knees close together and their hands safely in their laps— and David sleepily directed Sam down the main road out into what constituted Hartman suburbs, and they pulled out of the town center under the fading afternoon.
. So many people.
“I understand,” Yann whispered. “I understand. I’m not – I understand.”
"Make you feel like a man, don't it?" Drum said quietly, and Dean looked at him. The old man smiled crookedly, his sinewy muscles flexing as he shook his arms out. "Makes you remember all two hands can do."
“Yeah, so,” Sam said, clearing his throat and shaking off the shock of Cas walking out. He got up, and tossed his fuming brother a halfhearted shrug before striding after Cas, nearly knocking a waitress over.
Dean growled out something unintelligible, and Sam ignored it, voice still soft.
The wind wandered with them, blowing them back towards the house sometime after. Time was strange there. An hour or a minute, it was all the same after a while.
Silence fell in which the reaper set his gaze on Cas, and all of Castiel's arrogance dissolved. He felt at once boneless, as if the floor had fallen out from under him.
He gasped, scrambling back onto his knees—his palms were dashed with scrapes, his throat hurt like hell, and then Sam was there, grabbing his arm and pulling him up. Dean's ankle was pounding like a heartbeat but he ran on it anyway, stumbled down the rest of the levee, Sam at his heels, too winded to call Cas' name so Sam called it for him, shouted it over the increasing rush of the river.
The music had picked up speed in his absence; Sam slipped into the little milling of spectators on the edge of the floor. He could see Dean and Cas across the way, at the far end of the hall. Their faces were flushed and they looked like they'd been dancing for a fair while.
Dean’s face remained unconvinced—in fact he looked a bit frightened at the prospect of a photograph—but Cas nodded in understanding.
“I—sorry, I'm looking for Clint Francis? Er—
They waited, Dean and Cas staring, but they seemed to already know.
“You'd have to talk to one of them,” she said; she almost seemed to shiver and unbuckled her seat belt, bracing her foot against the door to pop it open. “If you want to know about Porter's gospel, or whatever. I don't know very much about it.”
He channeled his weight down, to his legs, could feel it like a slow creep dropping down to his feet, down into the ground, solid. The wall was swinging up and the men on the other side were waiting with their slack lines ready to pull it into position. It was heavy as a bitch—but Dean wasn't thinking about the weight of the wall; he was thinking about his own. He was lost in the positioning of his own form, the tension of his arms and of his leg, the weight so deep he might have grown straight into the ground.
“I'm afraid your little book of miracles won't take you much further,” the old man said. “The land in the south is not good for miracles.”
Cas nodded; he let his attention drift for just a moment to the Winchesters, but they were fixed on him, waiting for him to finish.
“I don't think I can do that.”
“I don't know—just calm down, we'll call Bobby, we'll—”
She shook her head, her eyes wide.
“Just stopping in, then,” she said, nodding her white head.
He chanced a glance and was surprised to see that Cas' eyes weren't the furious hellfires of earlier but something far more resigned. Ashamed.
The slow song melted into another, the guitar plucking along to Sugar and Nate and the rest of the rocking bodies around them.
“I suppose I'm just confused,” Cas added, then. He shrugged his shoulders back. “I'm not sure how—how we're getting on. What's alright to do and not do.”
“Why did you walk off like that?” Dean snapped, the silence shattering. “We were trying to talk to you.”
“Why's the door open?” he slurred. “Dean—”
He sighed, running a hand over his face, rearranging himself under the covers to try and get comfortable. He ended up on his side, facing the other bed, and lay there, looking at the hills and valleys of the two bodies across the way.
She paused to lean over the table, her bony elbow resting on its edge, and her loose fist hovering between them all, like a gavel ready to fall.
Something shifted. Made them animals.
It was the town consensus that Lily Francis was never going to let herself get married.
They were getting settled when Sam's phone rang, and when he picked it up he frowned at the number.
Cas had drifted off, somehow, beside him in the single bed, and was lying on his back, head tilted a little towards Dean on the pillow. But Dean couldn't manage it. He was a buzz of nerves, ready to burst out of his own skin, and his mouth was dry, and he couldn't help but feel his heart thudding in his chest, thrashing.
“Really, ma’am – ma’am,” Dean said, his voice softer, coming closer. “We – we really didn’t do it. Honest. Scout’s honor. If you could just let me show you, there’s a baseball in there, alright? Some boys, they were just messin’ around and they threw it—”
Cas knew they should leave. They should have left as soon as things started getting weird, but he couldn’t have moved if he tried. They were all plastered to the booth, waiting in the agitated silence.
Hand traveling down Cas’ neck, and his mouth followed, tongue and lips, not the slightest scrape of teeth, and Cas moaned and sighed, pushed his body against the wanderings of Dean’s palms.
Craning his head, Sam could see the tops of the trees over the tent closest to them. “Well, if Clint Francis is anywhere, I bet it’s there,” he said, looking back at the other two. “It’s a good start at least.”
All of it waiting, old, and quiet.
The world seemed on edge.
“Take it out on me as much as you wish,” he said. “I am old. I do not mind.”
“Let me guess, it was lost,” Dean said, and Bobby huffed.
“Even just a
Dean hummed in absent agreement, kissed him again, the corner of his mouth, a sweet little thing.
“Yes,” she said tiredly, with sarcasm, and Sam could immediately tell she had said what she was about to say at least a million times. “It’s
“That's me,” she said. She looked uncomfortable—perhaps it was because she'd come upon them uninvited; none of them could tell. “You're—Sam's brother, yeah?”
The yellow python twisted across the kitchen floor and lay heavy over her feet, and gently she moved her old stooped legs to shoo it off.
And Sam's hands upon them, flighty, unsure how best to hold them,
“Oh, I know so.”
Dean cleared his throat and looked away, ears hot.
“Oh, goodness, I wouldn't dream of it. It's a tricky road.” Mattie shook her old head, firmly and wisely, handing him another plate wet and warm with dishwater. “A Riverlander's house is open for as long as it is needed, so don't you pay that no mind, darling. That's what my Aaron always used to say.”
until you've had funnel cake,” Dean said, handing him the wavy paper plate. Cas promptly choked on the powdered sugar and chugged half his beer to wash it down, blinking rapidly. Dean tried his best not to laugh.
There were plenty of books, but their titles were worn down with dust and age and unreadable, even when Dean swiped his grimy hand across them. He looked to the desk next, lifting up some of the scattered papers, nosing through the bills and receipts crammed in the cubbies. A spider scuttled out of the way and he followed it to the knob of a small drawer with a keyhole positioned right below.
As they passed it, wandering into the kitchen after her, Cas saw the one bare mattress, not even a headboard to hold it up to any standard, a grimy window, a bureau stacked with hatboxes full of lingerie. A Bible on the Ikea nightstand. It was a sad room. It was a sad place. She seemed much too bright for it all.
“I – we really couldn’t…” Cas began, and she shook her head, grinning.
Cas rubbed at Dean’s thigh where his hand still lay, thumb dragging over the denim, trying to not worry about all of it. It must simply have been stress. There was a lot they didn’t know, and Cas was all too familiar with how much Dean hated going into things blind.
not interested—”
“Okay, but what about this? People don't just up and stop having lycanthropy. The guy in Nebraska? Demons asking to be exorcised? And we've hardly had any good work in months. Bobby, come on, that's just not natural.”
“S’wrong?” he slurred, rubbing his face and yawning into his hand. It was barely ten o’clock and the heat was already starting to seep into the house, turning the air thick and soft.
“They probably figured she'd washed downstream, thought she'd be in the ocean by now.”
Together they went down the creaking stairs, into the melting openness of evening, the damp humidity and buzzing air. Olivia kissed them all, and Baby twined around their ankles as if to trip or trap them, and with many a fond gaze flung backward to the leaning house the trio swung into the Impala, her old wheels leaning under their weight.
Dean watched him, eyes glued to his face, the rapture of his expression as their bodies came together and apart. Dean could easily say he was going to grow addicted to these times where they were part of the same body, tied to each other, bound up in flesh and skin and bone. Here, where there wasn’t an ache of apartness. Just fulfillment, enjoyment – delight in each other.
Their arms knocked together inelegantly; Cas was obviously in the middle of trying to decide what to do with his hands, and Dean’s fingers edged under the hem of his shirt. Warm skin. Very warm. He had always imagined Cas to be cooler to the touch, and he wasn’t, and it imbued him with such a strange sense of comfort to know for certain that he nearly stopped kissing the angel on top of him all together. He breathed against Cas’ mouth and Cas kissed him softly, palms dragging down Dean’s shoulders and towards his chest.
But he didn't feel like sleeping was an option.
Not knowing who he was.
. He wasn't what she wanted. It wasn't him. It couldn't be.
“An honest one,” Dean said. He would not allow himself to get caught up in the anxiety. He would let himself talk about it. Enjoy it. “A good, honest house.”
Dean dug his hand into the bag of potato chips he was burning through and tossed a few back, crunching them and wiping the crumbs on his jeans. Sam came out of the convenience store, the doors sliding back together behind him, carrying two apples and a bottle of water. He tossed one of the pieces of fruit to Cas and looked on his brother worriedly.
“Don’t make me ask you again to eat, alright? You poor babies have been travelin’ a long time. Long, long time, bless your sweet souls,” she murmured, thoughtfully. “Anyway, she’s expectin' y'all. Air’s cracklin’ with things. Big things.”
All of them were committed to someone."
Sam flipped his phone open and stared at the glowing screen. The wallpaper was something generic, something random—clouds through the window of the Impala, he thought. He vaguely recalled that Cas had taken that picture, bored, on a long drive up from Nevada to Bobby's place, and he'd liked it enough to make it his home screen.
“No, I mean—God, I want to kiss you,” Dean said, breath slipping out under his words, making them thin, making them rise like tide. “I want to kiss every bit of you. I mean it.”
The reaper sighed; he drained the life from his smoke in one long suck and it vanished into the air. He brushed the ash off on his suit.
“Anything but Mexican,” Dean muttered.
to which Sam rolled his eyes and returned a tight face.
Lily Francis' phone rang on the counter of her father's shop just as she was drawing the shades for the night, the only lights the fluorescent bulbs above the front door.
“Yeah?”
? This was over a hundred years ago.”
“But,” Sam continued, giving Dean a sideways glance, “we'll only do it if you
She took a breath, and rubbed her thumb along her palm, lost in what she was saying. She wandered sideways a little, looking into the racket of her birdcages. Cas followed her with his eyes.
He was holding it. Here in his hands. The thing—the thing itself, and he'd almost been convinced it didn't exist at all; it had seemed so nebulous, so grand. It was here. The story they had followed all the way down the river—or, perhaps, he thought, the story that had followed them; under the cracked and weathered covers he imagined dancing lines of text, speaking of miracles. Speaking of grand harvests, and the aurora borealis, of children cheating death, of kingfishers flocking. Speaking of all the evil things in the darkness pulling away, shrinking back as if from flame. The story that made wolves losing the moon, made gods brew tea. An eternal spring. A great celebration. Speaking of something so enormous that Death himself had walked to bring it home.
Sam clicked out the lights and the room went black.
“You’re really beautiful,” he said, because it felt right to say, and her lips quirked into a smile.
Her lack of words made him infinitely nervous.
“I'm just saying—I'm not gonna push you into anything. It's a big step, Cas, it's a big thing to say
“For God's sake, spit it out, Sam, I'm not twelve.”
"Jakob died sixteen years ago, so on and off since then. Here and there, when I have time. It isn't finished yet - I don't think it ever will be. My husband always liked to watch me work, so I always keep adding things.”
“No…you’re not.”
Cas leaned back with him, and didn't reply, but touched a few fingers to his lips as if to hold the kiss there for as long as possible; they looked up at the stars wheeling over the trees, the great atlas of the heavens, without saying a word.
After winding a path to the back of the shed, he finally found it and hefted it—gasoline sloshed inside. Turning back, Dean's eyes roamed in the filmy light. Perhaps it was habit, but his gaze strayed to the rickety bookshelves and an old hutch desk pressed up against one of the walls. Interested, he set the gas tank down again near his feet and went towards them, seeing whatever there was to see.
His little brother lifted his eyes to the rear-view mirror. “What?”
Dean blinked, their faces mere centimeters apart, and their eyelashes tangled for a moment before Cas felt his heartbeat slow beneath his hands, and felt his arms come up around him.
And in all of him, in every inch and marrowed bone of him, Dean saw the hugeness—saw the blinding brightness, the ancient and impossible thing of him behind his eyes, filling up the room like some long-forgotten sun. A star.
was a good word for it.
more than a hundred years ago, and then hung up without so much as a goodbye.
Sam shifted towards them, long arms wrapping around both of them at once, some kind of knot in the center of the quiet little room.
He was sleep-rumpled and startled, but not in a bad way. It was a look generated by the complete surprise at the fact that time had managed to sneak up on them so easily. The dull murmur swelled to a roar.
She babbled something about letting them get settled in and then went back down the stairs. Conversation rose up after her, a low man's voice mingling with her sweet high chirping, and the three hunters looked at one another.
“We can try again,” he said, repeating Dean's words from the night before. “We have time.”
“We haven’t had a chance to look anything up or call anyone yet, so what Dean’s saying, I think, is that we probably shouldn’t jump to any conclusions until we’ve considered everything,” Sam paused, staring at Yann’s face.
“Not you! All of you!” she said, catching her breath, staring between the three of them.
“What can start you with? Drinks? We, well—it isn’t quite happy hour but I will give you those prices if you would like something like that? We have very good margaritas.” She paused, getting ahead of herself and let the pad rest against her thigh. “I’m Rosa, by the way, and I’m talking too fast again.”
no, I don't
Chasing steps down the porch, a dancing movement, and Dean caught Cas by the middle, hands knotted over his stomach, pulling him in, back – the pop of his spine, the scruff of Dean’s stubble above the limp collar of his wedding shirt. Cas’ barked laugh.
Sam’s light voice trying to rile him up, get him going, childish and petulant, and all of them cramped – the fleeting thought a few minutes before that he should reach out, touch Cas’ knee, make sure it was alright, a thought he had immediately tamped down. He remembered the beginnings of an appetite starting to knot his stomach.
Yann reemerged a moment later, setting down a plate of thick white bread and a plastic tub of margarine. He pulled his chair out with a dull scrape and sat down heavily, grinning.
No hurry.
Madame Olivia made coffee in her kitchen, coffee with chicory. Beignets on a plate, warm and soft and drowning in powdered sugar, her own recipe. In the next room her three guests were waiting, sitting in the half-dark.
He didn’t want to hang up.
Dean sank into silence, considering this. He leaned against a dresser and watched her work. She was precise, and everything she did seemed effortless. Must have been from being so old.
“Mmm.”
“It's all unusual. All very unusual.”
Dean stiffened and turned over his shoulder to see Drum motioning at him.
“I haven’t seen her since a few Christmases ago. Did some roof work so the snow wouldn’t cave her in – did it through the church.The Christian one. If anybody’ll have a light on, it’s her. She’s up there in that big old house by her lonesome and she always keeps the light on as far as I know. Part of that queer sort of hers. I’m sure she’ll tell you all about it if you ask.”
Cas rested on Dean's chest, small enough in body to fit there, and together they lay in the dark, watching headlights move across the ceiling, reflected up from the crooked shades. They didn't speak. There was a drowsy sort of contentment here, as if they'd stepped, for a moment, back through the veil, and any darkness looming ahead of them had been detached, like a bone popping from a socket. Castiel's fingertips rested on Dean's collarbone through the fabric of his shirt, and he caressed the jut of it, small circles in the deepening dusk.
“We’re extremely grateful for your generosity,” Cas answered for the three of them; Dean glanced at him. “A home is such a private place.”
“Thanks for waiting,” Sam said, smiling, the two of them moving into the yellow film of the kitchen to sit at the table. Into the sizzling sound of things being dropped into a skillet, Dean’s knee jutting out from the round table; the washed-too-many-times softness of the checkered table cloth; the nod of daffodils in the window box just over the sink; the mottled glasses and dull silverware positioned in front of the chairs; the stack of fancy paper napkins in the ceramic holder; the glossed gleam of blue Dutch china tiles displayed on the buttery walls. Sam could see that Dean had been offered a glass of milk and it had been half-drained already.
