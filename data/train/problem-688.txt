Sherlock makes an angry sound. “I simply do what is expected from me. Officially, John is the captain of this team. I’m just here for the time trials. And I don’t have to polish my image for the cameras, Anderson. I needed Molly to check something on my bike, fell back for that purpose, and while I was riding alongside the car, I got some more provisions. There’s another long
“Was he also local?” asked Havers. What distrust he had harboured towards Sherlock seemed to have evaporated.
John let out a breath, running a hand through his hair and licking his lips. “Before we share a bed tonight, for example.”
The touch on his shoulder tightens, becomes more tangible, more real. With a ragged breath, Sherlock surfaces out of a tangle of bed sheets and blanket. For a moment, he doesn’t know where he is. It’s dark around him, warm bordering on hot which strikes him as odd. Just now, he was freezing, shivering in the grey damp of the destroyed tree-henge. But the smell of wet, torn up earth and splintered wood has been replaced by that of sweat, toothpaste, laundry detergent and honey-pine shampoo.
Suddenly, he gives a sharp whistle that almost sounds like the cry of a bird of prey, and dashes off across the short turf, down the long, gentle slope to where the strange, round water tank stands which Sherlock spotted from afar a while ago.
Sherlock frowned, cocking his head as he studied his brother curiously. “You’re not here because of them,” he stated. “Interesting. And you’re not going to try and manipulate me into talking to ... people?”
She smiles. “Good luck with lordship, Johnny, should you decide to stop being an idiot and give it a try.”
“Oh, hello,” says John, smiling up at Sherlock. “That was quick. Fancy some cake, too? It’s surprisingly edible, although the custard tastes a bit dodgy.”
John looks up at him and shakes his head. “Not since our team meeting. I thought he might be meeting you somewhere round here.”
“Yes, of course. She would have arrived early enough to avoid the crowds. The Windmill runs continuous performances from the early afternoon, meaning the stage door is beset by fans of one or more of the performers early on.”
Sherlock, too, was silent for a moment, seemingly lost in thought. “You’re right,” he then conceded, “we didn’t turn out too badly, considering our parents. Not even Mycroft, for all his ... well, the way he is.
She raised a hand in a soothing gesture. “I don’t mean to offend you, especially because I barely know you, but it seems to me that you’re only now beginning to peek a little out of the closet. Before, like a number of other chaps I’ve met over the years, you might have been wandering around in Narnia for all your denial about your sexual or romantic persuasion. I believe Sherlock, despite all his other quirks and oddities, has been a lot more straightforward in that regard.”
Sherlock has opened the bottle as well, is inspecting its contents critically, holding up his pill to the light. Hope keeps talking.
here almost had a fit while you were on the road today and getting closer and closer to his time.” He waves to Victor who interrupts his conversation with one of his team’s coaches and comes over. He is wearing the grey suit from the previous day and a dark shirt. His eyes narrow slightly when he recognises John, who stands up a little straighter and lifts his chin but smiles when he sees Sherlock.
When they arrived there, John saw that some of the buses had been diverted and the area in front of the building where the regular bus stops were situated had been cordoned off by police. He felt a stab in his chest at the reminder. The last time it had been secured by police tape had been after Sherlock’s fake suicide. Next to him, Sherlock stirred and surprised John by reaching for his hand and squeezing it reassuringly. John let out a long breath.
“Don’t worry about accommodation. I doubt we’ll be sleeping much tonight,” Sherlock told her. “I’ll let you know if the train is delayed.”
He gives Hattie’s back a swift pat, then with another quick and strangely bashful smile at Sherlock he walks past him and out of the door. Sherlock is left to gaze after him, not knowing what to make of the scene. But then, John Watson is quickly becoming the greatest riddle he’s ever set himself to solve. Enigma and even mighty Lorenz are mere trifles in comparison.
While the riders file out of the conference room, Sherlock lingers behind, signing to John to stay as well. Greg looks up at them from where he is stooped over his laptop. “Gents, what can I do for you?”
“Did what work?” John wants to know as he approaches carrying a tray with steaming mugs, a plate with biscuits, a packet of bandages and a tube of Voltarol.
“Very funny,” returned Sherlock, zipping up his windstopper jacket. John tried not to gaze too obviously and too longingly at a pair of long legs encased in tight black lycra. “Ready to go?” asked Sherlock.
John draws a deep breath and shrugs. “Don’t know, really. We had this weird off-on relationship for some years.”
“Should have known that there’d be no signal around here,” mutters John. Sherlock casts a quick glance at his friend in the passenger seat, his face illuminated from below by the cold glow from his mobile phone. Dusk has fallen. Outside the car windows, dark trees and hedgerows rush past, opening occasionally to allow views of a wintry landscape of meadows dotted with ghostly grey sheep, hedges and copses of woodland interspersed with lights glinting in houses and small villages, the occasional brightly lit Christmas tree next to a solitary farm, and the dark hills of the Brecon Beacons half-shrouded in cloud with here and there patches of snow remaining. The heavy rains of the past days have stopped for now, having eaten away what there was in terms of snow in most places – and probably destroying most traces of the ... occurrences John and Sherlock have been asked to investigate in this remote area between England and Wales. The wind is still strong, though, blowing steadily from the west, chasing clouds and brown leaves across the countryside, tearing off twigs and branches and occasionally even rocking the car with a howling gust.
“Yes, yes, I know. But you’re not dead yet. Show me that leg of yours. When did you feel the cramping begin?”
“Well, there is no point of wearing them tonight, is there?” he returns pointedly, depositing most of the clothes on a chair and only keeping the t-shirt and pants . “Or do you plan on going out again?”
“Well done, Sherlock,” says Victor gravely and with genuine appreciation, still holding on to Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind, which ignites the embers of jealousy in John’s belly once again.
“Oh, I will. Also, since you’re so good at deducing people – at least that’s what Molly keeps saying –, tell me about those two over at the door, the tall one with the spectacles and his red-haired friend? Worth pursuing, either of them?”
Sherlock chuckles, signalling to John that he is enjoying this, that John hasn’t overstepped his boundaries. “Well, in that case ... do carry on.”
He got as far as jotting down a basic outline of events, sorely tempted to put down things like ‘kissed Sherlock for the first time’ or ‘snogged my mad flatmate this morning’ when he found his thoughts wandering again. Gazing out of the window at the rather unspectacular countryside with its fields and trees, villages and small rivers and the occasional sunflower field, he was reminded of family holidays long ago. They’d mostly stayed in the UK and he’d gotten around there quite a bit. Whether it had been the Cornish coast, Hadrian’s Wall, the Lake District or the Isle of Wight, as a child he had enjoyed all of them. There’d always been something to see and explore, and thus he’d never minded not going to Mallorca or Italy or the US like some of the other kids. Now he wondered how it would be like to revisit them with the bicycles and the world’s only consulting detective in tow.
John glanced up at the darkening clouds. Only to the south-west, above a line of distant trees and the huge cargo cranes of Felixstowe container port, the silhouettes of which looked like strange, long-legged beasts, he could see a line of light where the sun was about to dive into the sea. Sherlock was right, it was going to be dark soon. Suddenly, riding only as far as the bunker and getting a lift home in a warm car seemed extraordinarily appealing. As did simply sleeping in the hay in the bunker, with Sherlock snuggled up to him his keep his back and shoulder warm.
There is a brief round of greetings, before the three newcomers are invited to seat themselves in front of Denniston’s large desk that is littered with stacks of papers, and houses an ink-well and a large black telephone, as well as some photographs of his wife. The commander himself looks as troubled as his four colleagues. Despite the size and relative grandeur of the room with its elaborate wooden floors and wall panelling and the ornate stucco ceiling, with the amount of people now occupying it, it looks cramped and stuffy, an impression further increased by the shelves overflowing with files and the general bric-a-brac of a busy workplace (at wartime, what’s more).
“He only had coffee. Breakfast was brief and a little tense, anyway. Emma wasn’t in the best of moods, didn’t want to eat, either, and the fact that two strangers camped here last night didn’t help things.”
Both of them are, particularly because they seem so out of place in sleepy Bletchley. More suited to London, New York or Chicago both in attire and bearing with their suave, stylish, sophisticated appearance, Sherlock wonders what made someone like The Woman agree to a performance in a place like this when she could be on stage in the big opera houses of the world, war or not. And as for her acquaintance, Sherlock is not entirely certain whether his appearance leans more towards landed gentry or nouveau riche. Is he Adler’s lover? Neither of them is wearing a wedding or engagement ring, but there appears to be a certain familiarity in the way they are communicating wordlessly over the distance. Sherlock watches their silent exchange keenly and with great interest. Something has stirred his suspicion. Something is strange about the two of them. He can’t decide whether it has any bearing upon their case. Likely not. Still, he is intrigued, fascinated, even. After all, he loves riddles, and Irene Adler and her mysterious scar-faced, ring-bearing friend are posing a particularly juicy one.
“That’s true. I’ll let him know he can be our extra eyes. You might be right. Being involved like this may cheer him up. I’ll tell him to save internet links of suspicious videos, or even record stuff if he can.”
“Shut up,” hisses Sherlock, embarrassed by his reaction born out of lack of experience. John winks, bumping his shoulder playfully.
John nods, apparently finding his suspicions confirmed. “We should have had this conversation when you came back,” he says sadly.
“A lot,” answers the addressed, his fingers briefly resting on the pile of folders as if to underline his point. “Sebastian Moran – and indeed his father before him – have been in our sights for a long time, hence the increased attention from intelligence personnel he received. We’ve been aware of the contacts he entertained with very active members of the NSDAP for several years, and we also knew of his less than heroic conduct during the evacuation of Dunkirk. We monitored his actions closely, hoping to gain as much insight into the network of Nazi sympathisers in this country and abroad he associated with. The fact that his true allegiance has been revealed in such a flashy, public manner is unfortunate as there were several leads we were following that have since dried up, but we must make the best of it now. Moran hasn’t shown himself to be very cooperative as yet, nor very clever, I should add. Time will reveal how open he is to persuasion, and how resistant to pressure. I have high hopes he will reveal more information rather sooner than later. He is not a man with a good deal of spine, and we have enough on him to use as leverage. However, I fear we won’t manage to avoid a public scandal. His mother, Lady Moran, a most formidable woman as you’ll surely agree after meeting her earlier today, supports whatever measures we might have to take to convict her son of treason, which shows her good judgement, and her son’s lack of it. Still, how the case is going to be reviewed by the public is another matter. It’s what I am concerned about. I doubt you have had a chance yet to peruse the evening papers, but Moran is already mentioned several times. And so are you two. Mr. Riley from the
“I am sure this can be arranged once we catch them,” said Sherlock. John saw how the corner of his mouth twitched in a smile. “But of course first we must find and catch them.”
“Well, not know, precisely. I met her at company parties. And yes, all right, sometimes I stalk her on Facebook.”
Sherlock sighs, his eyes boring into John’s. “What do you want to hear, John? I told you why I did what I did. I’m not proud of having developed a smoking habit during rehab. The alternative would have been to keep using cocaine. I managed to kick both addictions – mostly. My lung capacity is extremely good, as you witnessed these past days. It has been tested repeatedly. There is no permanent damage. So stop worrying. I have no intention of smoking becoming a habit again. As I said, I know what I’m doing. Or are you mad at me because I didn’t inform you of my whereabouts this evening?”
“Or ridden on with worse. I’m fine, Sarah. You know me. Stubborn arse and all that. Wasn’t that what you called me when I was being an idiot to you?”
While taking extensive notes on her small laptop and scrolling through the photographs she had taken with her camera, she chatted with Katie, catching up on gossip and enquiring about how she was faring with Emma. John felt sleepiness creep up on him, and wished he had bought a coffee at the station in addition to the pies. He seriously considered taking a nap, but then he felt Sherlock stir next to him and lean forward to address Liz, causing John to snap to attention.
Victor inclines his head. “We were supposed to meet over there,” he points towards the gardens. “But there are too many people about still. So I suggested this spot. Didn’t expect you to be here, though.” The last sentence sounds somewhat annoyed, even hostile.
Cutlery clangs again. There’s the scrape of a chair-leg on wood. One of the desk chairs, probably. Somebody is walking around in the living room, obviously not caring about strings or simply tearing through them. It’s a halting progress, though. Whenever an alarm sounds, the ... person, for lack of a better descriptor, halts and seems to wait.
“I thank you for your kind invitation, but I have to decline,” quipped Sherlock. “Actually, I should be on my way.” He tipped his riding helmet in a mock salute. John closed his eyes for a moment and breathed out through his nose. Sherlock was really overdoing it now. But it seemed to work.
Sherlock frowns. He feels completely out of his depth, and he doesn’t like it. “I wasn’t afraid. Why should I be afraid of you?”
John kisses his cheek. “Don’t be like that. You do know that I think you’re absolutely stunning, right? In case you’d forgotten, I’ll gladly state it again and again.”
Glancing back at Sherlock, he caught his friend’s thoughtful, intense expression. Sherlock was watching him with a burning fire in his eyes, a mixture of possessiveness, pride, need, and a couple of other emotions John didn't recognise at a glimpse. As soon as Sherlock noticed his attention, his face took on the carefully calculated look he so often wore when he was trying to hide his feelings. He even retrieved the sunglasses from the neckline of his jersey and put them on again.
“Relax,” murmurs John, rubbing his back in a soothing gesture. His hand feels very warm. Sherlock hopes his own hands aren’t too sweaty. He can hear the smile and quiet encouragement in John’s voice. Why is he not more troubled by this? It’s not allowed. They’re both men, they shouldn’t be dancing, especially not in a setting that has all the markings of a romantic one: solitude, moonlight, a garden, music. But John seems perfectly at ease. Sherlock wonders if he has done this before. Not exactly
“Sherlock, could you please wake up. We’re almost in Washington and I need to know which turn to take.”
“A little, yes.” John draws up an empty chair from an adjacent table, and deftly lifts Sherlock’s leg onto the seat.
Anderson snorts derisively. “Yeah, and we all know which one the other team is. Makes me sick to see their captain ride in yellow, really. I hope Sherlock’ll knock him off the podium. Or Wilkes. Or anybody, really.”
“But you also believe that the horses were killed, and didn’t just die of some colic?” fell in John.
Sherlock waves a hand and starts to pace impatiently. Molly takes another sip of her tea, draws a deep breath and sits up straighter in her chair. “He is right. I shouldn’t be babbling, and there’s time for bawling later. Right. So this morning ... actually, I should start elsewhere. You see, I’m billeted at Newton Longville, where I share lodgings with two other girls. There’s Sally Donovan who only arrived last week. She’s from Jamaica. There seems to have been some mix-up with her lodgings because she couldn’t be housed with the other Wrens and so ended up at our place.
Vanessa smiles faintly. “You’re right, he didn’t. It’s what I read between the lines. He should be here soon.”
John kicked at a cigarette stub on the pavement. “From time to time. Sometimes I took Mrs. Hudson, sometimes I went by myself. A few times I swore that it would be my last visit because … well, looking at that black headstone and imagining you underneath it just hurt. But I returned nevertheless.”
Sherlock clears his throat, feeling a little caught out. “It’s true. I don’t walk around imagining sexual acts like you and the rest of the population.”
“I don’t see it like that. I think he did do harm. I’ve rarely seen you so unsettled like when memories of the event come up.”
“Yes, will they?” fell in Emma as well, her eyes round with worry. “Because if we have to tell them and they don’t catch them, then—”
Soon, he has to leave her place, too. When he arrives back at the Warringtons, his uncle is in the process of loading his car with a gaggle of boys to drive them home. Sherlock quickly slips into the house to avoid them seeing him. In the deserted kitchen, he helps himself to some leftover dinner, before disappearing into his room, thinking that if the remainder of his stay in Washington passes like this, he won’t complain.
“It isn’t mutually inclusive. So far, I haven’t given you many – if any – reasons to appear trustworthy to you. I constantly withhold information about my past. I avoid answering your questions. You caught me sneaking out in my pyjamas in the middle of the night and had to take my word concerning my purpose and destination. You haven’t seen any of my health reports or blood samples as proof whether I really am as clean as I claim. And yesterday I accosted you stark naked under the pretence of having forgotten my towel, which, under certain circumstances, could be construed as sexual harassment or at the very least indecent exposure. By all accounts, I could be the world’s greatest liar, crook, doper, drug-addict and all-around arsehole.
Milner-Barry frowns at this. “What have the teleprinters to do with codebreaking? We use the Type-X and the Hollerith machines for Enigma, and the Bombes, of course, to find out the correct settings.”
Miranda smiles. “Glad you enjoyed it. Well, you’ve got your keys, but we’ll be up for a while still. What time would you like breakfast tomorrow?”
of the stage, and the first time the Tour de France includes the forest in its itinerary which caused a lot of discussion and media attention beforehand, given how dangerous this passage is. Greg informs the riders that they are about 45 minutes behind time due to their slow progress. Still, nobody seems desperately eager to increase the pace, even if this means more hours spent in the saddle and less time for recovery in the evening.
exists, although John expects one to form early during the next ascension – on paper the hardest climb of the stage. There is another intermediate sprint before that, followed by the feed zone in Beaufort just at the base of category one Cormet de Roselend, an ascent of almost twenty kilometres with an average gradient of six percent. Team Speedy’s is happy to roll along. Sherlock keeps up with the other top-ten riders, John remains at his side. Anderson, Kit and Dimmock are near the head of the peloton as well, ready to react to potential attacks. Several riders do attempt to sprint away, but most are soon caught again. The most surprising – and successful – escape attempt comes right from the front. In a sharp bend, suddenly Wiggins, who was keeping the tempo high for his teammates, accelerates in a high gear and leaves them behind. Moriarty himself follows but can’t catch him and falls back behind Moran, looking furious. As soon as he’s got some breath back, Moriarty begins to talk angrily into the small microphone attached to his helmet-strap.
After Katie’s departure, Molly gave Sherlock a brief update on the Kensington florist case. Apparently Dimmock had apprehended three suspects, the shop’s owner being one of them, the other two members of the London underworld. Molly didn’t know more about the investigation, though, but she thanked Sherlock for the flowers in the name of a couple of patients. He brushed off her gratitude on these people’s behalf with his usual brusqueness, although John thought he looked secretly pleased – even though the flowers hadn’t even been his in the first place. Then again, John reasoned, if the flower shop’s owner was really in on both the murder and the drug smuggling, they deserved to have their goods divided up amongst the ailing.
John sighs, looking at her gravely. “I’ve had a hard time understanding and accepting this as well, particularly because I know what it’s like out there. I don’t condone how things are being done, but I understand the reasons now, I think.”
John decided to tease him some more. “I’ll keep that in mind for the future. Perhaps an occasion will arise for me to don my old uniform again, or dress up as Captain Hornblower or something.” He noted with silent glee how Sherlock swallowed very slightly.
Sherlock’s sleeves were rolled up. He often did that when he was playing the violin. John leaned in for a closer look. Yes, there were faint traces of rosin on his fingers and in his hair, meaning he’d run his hand through the strands. So Sherlock had arrived early, divested himself of some of his garments, had made himself tea, and he had played waiting for John. Why had he not texted, then? Had he wanted to be alone? He had taken the newspapers, but they were stacked exactly the way John had left them. Unread, then. Normally after a prolonged absence, Sherlock spent hours catching up on the news, trying to find interesting cases he had missed or simply soaking up gossip like a sponge.
“I wish I had found something to really replace it, particularly in moments like this, when everything threatens to overwhelm me, when I can’t see the pattern. When I don’t understand how things work, and how to resolve them.”
“Officially, yes. The track is a designated bridle-path, though, but given that it’s in a protected area, I doubt quads are allowed.” Sherlock turned, gazing at John excitedly with bright eyes. “Saddle our steeds, John. We’re going to investigate.”
Sherlock raises his left hand and studies the skin of its back. It still shows the mark of his teeth. It smarts a little. He bit it rather hard, trying to stifle the sounds he was making. But at least he hasn’t drawn any blood.
“And this is Billy the Skull,” says Tiffany as they come to stand in front of the fireplace. “He’s a real skull. Today, we looked at pictures of a bog man whose skull had turned to jelly or something because of the” – she gazes at Sherlock – “acidic conditions in the bog which drew calcium from his bones,” she explains carefully,” beaming when Sherlock nods approvingly.
Sherlock nods and scrambles into a sitting position. He lets go of John’s fingers and reaches out for the hem of his undershirt with both hands. John’s breath hitches when Sherlock begins to push it up and his fingers graze the skin beneath. It’s very warm and surprisingly soft, with only a little hair dusting the pectorals, and a trail of blond hair leading down into the pyjamas. Carefully, Sherlock manoeuvres the garment over John’s head and shoulders, trying to aggravate his present injury as little as possible. The bandage on John’s right shoulder still sits tight. John rolls his shoulder experimentally, but to Sherlock’s relief, he doesn’t groan with pain while doing so. The bullet scar on the left shoulder fascinates him. He looks at John, who hums his permission, before Sherlock begins to run his fingers over the gnarled skin, memorising the shape of the entry scar, the difference in texture compared to the skin surrounding it. Then, he begins to stroke John’s arms, feeling the muscles move, the soft hairs rising up in goose-bumps. He takes John’s hands and examines them, tracing the pattern of the veins on their backs, which, unlike on his own hands, are fairly symmetrical, perhaps because due to his injury, John had to learn to use his non-dominant hand for tasks such as writing.
The kitchen is new. One of the walls to the living room has been taken out to create an open plan space which extends into the conservatory that takes up one side of the living room and reaches out into the back garden. The garden itself looks similar to its mid-1980s state. The apple and plum trees are still there, as is the privet and yew hedge in the back. The shed still stands, but has a new roof. The old swing that used to hang from the branches of the Bramley apple tree has been replaced by a wooden swing-and-slide construction. To the side of the shed stands a plastic sandpit shaped like a sea-shell, probably a leftover from when Tiffany was younger.
“And if either of them has access to cyanide capsules,” adds John darkly. He runs a hand over his face to brush away a strand of gossamer stuck on his forehead, which he seems to have ignored until now. “Why did she die, Sherlock?” he asks softly. “A bright young woman like her …”
Their food arrives shortly before Wiggins. John has just tried the first forkful of hot, sugary crêpe when Sherlock nudges him. “Eat up. There’s our man.”
Sherlock slips under the covers again and arranges himself on his back with his hands folded on top of the sheets, staring at the stuccoed ceiling and listening to the pipes when John flushes the toilet and then washes his hands. He feels strangely calm and content. The constant whirr in his head is still there, but less insistent. He isn’t bored, isn’t craving the next new riddle as he so often does.
The phone stays silent after that. Sherlock is tempted to fling it across the room. Next to him, John makes a snuffling sound. The arm resting loosely over Sherlock’s middle tightens. Sherlock lets out a long breath. Well, he has waited for almost thirty years, he can wait a little longer.
“Well,” says Denniston, once more folding his hands in front of him. “I would suggest this remains for the police to find out.”
Sherlock seems likewise affected. His eyes are boring into John’s. His breathing is elevated, he swallows again. It’s Sherlock who breaks the spell, looking away and clearing his throat. “I ... bathroom,” he rasps, making a vague gesture and scrambling out of bed. John nods, and despite raging curiosity, he doesn’t look up to check the front of his bedmate’s boxers when Sherlock makes a beeline for the ensuite. As soon as he is out of sight, though, John lifts the thin duvet and gives his crotch a stern glance.
In the small town of Ichtegem, about sixty kilometres from Ghent, what initially looks like another breakaway attempt soon turns out to be a young Belgian rider on his first Tour sprinting away from the peloton to greet family and friends who are lining the road. He waves happily to them and blows a kiss to a woman with a baby on her arm, even picks up a Belgian flag to carry for a short stretch, before falling back again into the main field with a look as happy and content as if he has just won the stage. John admires him for his youthful enthusiasm. Here is someone simply enjoying this race, letting himself be celebrated in his hometown, its inhabitants no doubt proud to have one of their own riding in the world’s most prestigious cycling race. John reminds himself that this attitude, this attitude precisely, should be his as well. He should try to enjoy it more. It’s his last Tour, his last ride through Belgium in a peloton ... He looks around at his teammates, bent over their handlebars, sweating as they ride, and feels a deep stab in his heart. He’s going to miss this, he realises, miss it deeply. He can still keep up cycling, of course, after leaving this team. But it won’t be the same. The adoration of the masses, the company of his teammates, being part of the biggest outdoor sports event in the world. He’s never going to experience this kind of excitement of belonging again if he decides to hang up his professional cycling shoes after this race. Even the daily hardship, the months of preparation, the discipline ... he knows he is going to miss them, particularly because he still hasn’t got a real plan for what to do next. Cycling has been his life for so many years.
The bells of St. Marylebone Parish Church on Marylebone Road are tolling for the 11 o’clock Christmas Eve Mass when Sherlock and John return to the Baker Street flat. Lestrade thanks them again, and wishing them a good night (with only the slightest hint at innuendo) and a Merry Christmas, he drives off into the misty gloom. Sherlock unlocks the door, waits for John to limp inside, and shuts it again firmly against the icy fog outside. Taking off his naval cap, John sags against the wall with a sigh. It doesn’t take Sherlock’s skill at deduction to see how exhausted he is. Even though they stopped briefly at a pub in Dartford for a bowl of hot soup and a pint of ale (for John and Lestrade, cider for Sherlock), they’ve been caught up in the case Lestrade asked them to look into ever since John arrived at Baker Street in the late afternoon – arrived unexpectedly.
“You spoke in past tense. About ... what you said just now. Does that mean you no longer want the relationship thing?”
“Excellent. Dr. Watson and I are on our way to London. It should take us about three hours to get to either Waterloo or London Bridge, depending which train runs first, and whether there are going to be delays. We have some new information regarding Jennifer Wilson that may interest you. I’ll tell you once we are in London. I need to talk to Moran again, as well as Irene Adler and Jim Moriarty. Find out if the latter have performances tonight. It is likely that The Woman is singing somewhere, and perhaps Moriarty is playing, too. Also, try and find out whatever you can about Commander Wilcox of Ivy Farm Listening Station, Knockholt, Kent.”
“Mrs. Gruffudd called us because her husband was found lying in a flooded meadow near the river. He is uncooperative and possibly hallucinating and seems under the influence of either alcohol or some strong medication or drugs.”
“I read about you and that woman in the papers, when she claimed you’d had all that sex. It sounded strange. Like one of those shows Ellie watches on the telly. All those soaps.”
“Oh, hello, you must be the detectives from London Susan mentioned,” she greeted them, setting down the bowl and wiping her hands on her apron. “I’m Linda. Please, do come in. You’ll have questions, I assume. You can tie the horses to the fence over there.”
John nods darkly. “What are your plans for this evening after dinner? Most of the others will be out, and there won’t be a team meeting.”
Back at the flat, he clears enough space at the desk to sit down and eat. He feels better afterwards as he sits licking salt, fat and vinegar from his fingers and gazing out of the window at Baker Street below, tinted orange by the glow of the streetlamps. He is still somewhat rattled by the unprecedented second reset. Should he have stuck to the original script, then? Did he stray off too far and this was the warning shot? But it was off right from the beginning with Molly not arriving when she should have and even John reacting slightly differently, his attraction to Sherlock so much clearer and more blatantly obvious this time round. Of course, there can’t be a perfect repeat. And there shouldn’t be. Change is necessary and good. And in the past, the switch backs have always meant improvements
Sherlock snorted, shifting a little closer to John while still keeping his arms close to his body, his entire figure tense as if ready to bolt out of bed any instant. “‘Unresolved sexual tension’? Where on earth did you find that expression? It sounds like something the
“Anyway,” he goes on after a sip from his tea, “according to the shopkeepers, she never showed up in suspicious company. Mostly spent time in town with her friends from work, it seems. The café was a favourite haunt, as was the cinema. The last film she went to watch appears to have been
It’s rather fascinating to watch Victor Trevor’s face as his eyes flit from Sherlock to John and back again. Interestingly, Sherlock shifts a little closer to John. Jerking up his chin, he gives Trevor a broad yet utterly fake smile. “It was lovely chatting with you, Victor,” he says in his friendliest, most charming voice, “and reminisce about the good old times. I wish you a happy and successful Tour de France. I look forward to the time trials at Albi and Cognac. Do make sure you take your
“Which method? The ‘I look at the ketchup stain on your cuff and deduce your life story’ or the ‘I creep into your room and secretly go through all your personal stuff and thus deduce your life story’ method?"
“Because she was interesting, a challenge. And clearly interested in you, attracted to you, even. She tried to seduce you all the time. You can’t convince me you didn’t notice. And I know you still keep her phone – sentiment, is it? – and also that she isn’t dead.”
Sherlock smiles softly. Yes, he knows. Even though officially, John and Rosie still live at the house in Ealing John and Mary had rented together, over the past year, ever since the conviction of Culverton Smith, they’ve gradually spent more and more time at Baker Street, to both Sherlock’s and Mrs. Hudson’s delight. John returned to working at Sarah Sawyer’s surgery which is closer to 221B, but without any intention of rekindling their relationship. Sarah is about to get married to her girlfriend, anyway, the realisation of which brought on some introspection in John that has been interesting to watch. Sherlock is convinced by now that John, like Sarah, is bisexual, only that unlike her, who embraced it wholeheartedly, he is still not ready to accept this part of himself.
When John felt close to coming from kissing himself, he drew back gently. Looking at Sherlock who was gazing back at him with dark eyes under a mop of sleep-tousled hair, he asked softly, “How do you want to go about this?”
It turns out that Marco Mazza is not the only rider not signing in for today’s stage. Two others have been disqualified for not making the time limit during the previous one, a fact bemoaned by one of the affected teams in particular because their man was a valuable sprint helper. Everything points towards this stage being one for the fast men. It’s almost entirely flat apart from one category four climb at Côte de Calissanne relatively early in the race. The riders are going to head westwards from Marseille, swerving north for a bit to then pass through Arles where they cross the river Rhône and then head onwards to Montpellier across the northern outskirts of the Camargue. The weather is warm but bearable. Temperatures have risen again to around thirty degrees after last night’s thunderstorms, but some of the stifling humidity is gone. In fact, strong winds are expected to blow over the salt-flats of the Camargue. John hopes they won’t come from the West. Riding against a strong headwind for a hundred kilometres or more isn’t fun, even when only cycling along in the peloton.
“Only her stage-name, I think. She seems to go by ‘The Woman’. Anyway, I got us tickets. One for Molly, too. I’m not sure she’ll be in the mood to go, but she seemed to be coping surprisingly well, and I’d imagine her to fancy some distraction instead of sitting at home all day feeling sad.”
“Hey, had trouble on the way down?” asked John when he reached him. Sherlock glared at him, stuffing his jacket into the rucksack with almost brute force.
“No, the Park. I doubt Commander Denniston will want this case to be investigated by the local constabulary. After all, Jennifer Wilson’s workplace is supposed to remain a secret, or rather the nature of her work at the manor. We’ll report to him, and leave him to decide who to include in an investigation. I believe he will want to call in the military police, likely some people from London. Let’s hope they’re not going to be complete imbeciles.”
Silence falls except for John whistling softly through his teeth. “Good God, and I thought Enigma was dangerous. You guys here really deal with the tough stuff whereas us chaps out at the front just have to point our guns in the right direction.”
He enjoys the relative peace and quiet of this place as a respite from the people-infested anthill that’s the Park, and now an invasion is imminent. His room is tiny, he needs the additional space of the formerly spare room for experiments to take his mind of cribs and cyphers. And where and when is he supposed to practise his violin? It’s doubtful his new neighbour will appreciate the musical interludes at odd hours. His two landladies are sound sleepers and moreover occupy a somewhat separate part of the house. They usually don’t complain as long as he leaves out the more modern and experimental tunes and plays the odd Ivor Novello song for them to coo and sigh over.
They lie quietly for a while, John’s hand playing idly with Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock following the lines of the Barts Hospital logo on John’s t-shirt. At length, John stirs. “What happened after you’d lain down amidst the ruin of the tree-ring? Did anybody find you? Did your friend come?”
John, too, seems to be noticing the change in Sherlock’s bearing. He looks at him again, openly this time, and then the corner of his mouth twitches up in a soft but warm smile. And then he’s on his feet and walking around until he is standing in front of Sherlock. He holds out his hand in invitation. Sherlock blinks and stares at the hand, and blinks again.
Sherlock shifts onto his back and hums. “That was ...,” he begins after a while, staring up at the stucco patterns of the ceiling as they are slowly revealed in the growing light.
John smiled gently. “Actually, I think it is. I think it’s very important. For both of us. I know this entire topic makes you somewhat … anxious. Makes me nervous, too, to be completely honest. So yeah, perhaps we should talk about it. Gives me an idea about what you might want, and you what you can expect. Should it ever come to it, I mean. Practical application is still to be negotiated, after all.”
Sherlock’s eyes are drawn to the spot John’s tongue has just touched. He swallows again, his heart beating so forcefully that he is certain John can see the pulse in his throat. Unconsciously, he licks his lips as well, only becoming aware of the action when John’s eyes drop to his mouth. He, too, is tense now, as if barely supressing excitement, or fear. But no, John Watson is brave, he wouldn’t be afraid of this. Or would he? Sherlock wishes he had more – any – experience with situations like these. Even more, he wishes that John would finally do something to break the spell, because otherwise he is certain he is going to burst.
“Wow. That’s unexpected. I didn’t really attack that much. It’s probably for that one time I went after Moriarty.”
Letting out a shaky exhale and feeling hot of a sudden, Sherlock leaned closer to him. A rustle of cloth, and John’s arm wandered to his thigh to reach for the hand that was resting there. Closing his eyes and swallowing hard, Sherlock grasped it, running his hands over the once familiar knuckles and fingers. He detected a new scar on the back, and touched it gingerly, reverently. John turned his hand to take Sherlock’s in his, examining it in turn, before lifting it to his lips to kiss it.
“Stop worrying, John,” he mutters into his ear, his warm breath sending a shiver down John’s arms and back. “This is good. May I wash you?”
He glares at a thoughtful Trevor and a somewhat shell-shocked looking Sherlock, before clapping his hands with a sense of finality. “That said, could we please wrap this up now? I’m dead tired, and my road rash itches somewhat badly from the chlorine. I need a shower, perhaps a snack, and then bed. We’ll let you know if we find out who’s behind the media mess, and expect you to do the same.”
Sherlock turned his head to gaze at him, looking slightly irritated. He thought for a moment then shrugged. “I don’t remember the details. Handsome, I guess, by normal standards. I’m sure you’ll find images if you look online.”
“Wrong. I think you’re a bit of a prickly git, yes, but a brilliant one. I hate to admit it, but I fear you’re even right about my bike. I’m going to check with Molly later. By the way, I’m John.”
“It was to be expected,” said Sherlock, withdrawing from the fireplace. “But I think it’s safe to assume that something was hidden there, some small, fireproof box, perhaps. The mortar round the removable stone looked different from that with was originally used to build the fireplace. I’ll have to analyse respective samples. But I reckon that Kerke hid something there, and whoever came to retrieve it knew exactly where to look for it. Dimmock, see if you can obtain CCTV footage of this house. And find out more about the electrician. Also, you need to investigate how Kerke came by this flat. Who owned it before him? Who did he buy it from, how did he pay?”
“Okay. Good. So ... who are you? What do you do? Guess if he could see you, Sherlock would deduce you. But like this, you’ll have to describe yourself. There are pictures of us online. My blog should still be there, and Sherlock’s been in the papers a lot.” He hesitates, frowns. “Maybe there was even an article about our deaths.”
John licks his lips. “So ... that man you’ve been in love with, and still are. You said he didn’t love you back. Are you certain of that?”
Sherlock, too, is restless. Eventually “Thank you for coming along tonight, John,” he says into the soft hum of the air condition.
John nods darkly. “Yes, I know. My uncle fought in the Boer War, and my granddad against the Zulus. Grandpa was deeply troubled by what he saw down there, so much so that he tried to hinder Uncle Charlie from going to South-Africa to fight against the Boers. Granddad always said it wasn’t our war to fight. But I’m surprised. You
Reaching out, John touched his hand and clasped it briefly. “Try not to become tree food any time soon, okay.”
John laughed, and Sherlock, after scowling at him and obviously thinking John was having fun at his expense to then be convinced of the opposite, joined in, his chuckle deep and throaty. He then sobered up, looking at John intently. “Will you touch me again?”
Grousing at the taxi driver to bloody hurry up and take a turn here to reach Baker Street before seven – yes, Sherlock is aware that it’s a one-way-street and is happy to pay any fee or potential penalty should they get caught – he sinks back into his seat, feeling sick.
Sherlock nodded, grinning. “Exotic dancing, yes. She seems to have been quite a stunner, our Martha Hudson.”
“It has to do with a case,” Sherlock interrupts him with a trace of impatience. “I’m not just here to win stages and accrue a collection of stuffed lions and yellow jerseys. I’m actually working. Satisfied?”
Although eager to have a look at what Sherlock wanted to show him, John lets himself be dragged to the party by their teammates. Sherlock, too, joins them reluctantly, looking out of place as he stands awkwardly at one of the large windows looking out over the valley and refusing to participate in the revelry. Neither he nor John take a swim, and both stay away from the alcoholic drinks (of which there are few). The riders from Team Carrefour are cheerful, boisterous company. Lachapelle is wearing his white jersey in the water and has to endure countless remarks about participating in a wet t-shirt contest. Bernard, who goes round hugging anybody he can grab (but mostly Lachapelle), has dispensed with clothes altogether apart from a pair of briefs so tight that they leave little to the imagination. Somebody has painted a French Tricolour onto his chest which doesn’t come off in the water. The party is completed by riders from the third team staying at the hotel. It consists mostly of Scandinavians, Dutch and Germans. The man sponsor is dairy producer Arla. So far, the team hasn’t been very successful in this Tour, but that doesn’t seem to dampen their spirits. John ends up chatting with Thomas Hofmann, a German sprinter turned allrounder who is also of retiring age, and who was John’s teammate for three seasons before they joined their current teams.
Sherlock shrugged. “Not my doing. It might simply be old and the fat inside it has turned rancid. Unlike that McDonald’s burger they used for a long time experiment and which didn’t change substantially after months, some foodstuffs actually do turn bad.”
Sherlock smiles, too. This is brilliant. They’ll find a way to communicate, he is sure. But first: introductions. That’s the polite thing to do, isn’t it? Pointing at himself, “I am Sherlock,” he says.
John nods. “Of course, if you want me to. Better than you attempting to do it with your left hand and cutting up your pretty face.”
John sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Yeah, basically – not that I want you to go back to them. I’ll gladly function as a replacement, although I’m not sure that’s a healthy option in the long run, either. But there is no denying that you are troubled. That thing with your dad really bothers you, even if you deny it to yourself. You’re worried about Moran, too, about people hurting me. You get very protective, very tense. It sometimes seems to me that the more difficult the situation gets, and I’m talking of difficulties you can’t solve intellectually, the more ... physically demonstrative you become. More clingy and cuddly, but also more possessive, more ... uhm ... sexually aggressive.”
John doesn’t wait for them to recover, neither does he intend to climb down and check on them. He knows he’s kicked Stu hard enough to render him out of commission for a while. The fall will have added bruises, at least, if not a sprained or even broken limb. Both seem still alive, judging from the sounds echoing up from the deep. John fully intends to have left the station by the time they have recovered enough to attempt the stairs again, hopefully into the protection of the Met and a waiting ambulance.
He spends the next hour researching Chanctonbury Ring on the internet and reading two rather fascinating articles about recent archaeological investigations in the region. He also searches for information about the effects of the 1987 storm and the replanting of the trees, and finds a number of old photographs from times before the disaster that show the tree-henge in its full glory. He saves a few of them on his phone, and tells himself it’s not due to sentiment. Some are property of a local museum, which Sherlock thinks might be interesting to visit. In fact, he is so engrossed in his research and reading that he doesn’t notice when John wakes up, and is surprised to feel a gentle press of lips to his shoulder.
John’s fingers shift, desperately feeling for a pulse that’s failing rapidly. They press down, shift again, press and—
Sherlock sighs. “Your affair with your secretary is not a big secret. In fact, not a secret at all. You can rest assured that most of your co-workers know, even if so far they have kept silent. The woman in question hasn’t been that cautious, though. She has been hinting about it quite heavily on social media. Perhaps you should have a word with her. Evidence to prove your affair wouldn’t be hard to come by, either online or in the form of receipts, bookings and the like. Personal correspondence, too, although apparently you’re using a second phone to communicate with her. She, however, doesn’t.”
John shrugged. “Perhaps because she was poor and wouldn’t have been welcome even among the servants. But it’s a fairy-tale, Sherlock. Logic doesn’t always work there as they have rules and conventions of their own. And she was reunited with her granny in the end.”
Expectant silence reigns the audience when all eyes and cameras shift to Holmes. He glares at them through his sunglasses, standing stiff and still. John notices how the hand holding the bike is trembling slightly because Holmes seems to be grasping it with all his might. Eventually, he lifts the mic. “I was bored,” he says.
Slowly and carefully, he started moving his other limbs, making a mental inventory of what might be damaged and how badly. Nothing broken, hip and shoulder severely bruised, though, ribs got a bit of a beating, too. Headache from hitting the ground while rolling over, but luckily the helmet had taken the worst brunt of the impact. Otherwise, John reckoned he’d be severely concussed or worse now. Unconscious, too, not just lying prone and in a haze of pain.
Victor gives him a long, calculating glance. Eventually, he inclines his head. “Okay,” he says. “Sherlock?”
John gazes at him with a strange expression. Sherlock isn’t sure whether he is impressed or believes Sherlock to be a lunatic. A bit of both, perhaps. Eventually, John laughs softly. “You are quite extraordinary, aren’t you?” he mutters, as if speaking to himself. Then clearing his throat, he moves to free the chair of his clothes. “Er … do sit down. Or do you prefer to stand?” He licks his lips as he looks up at Sherlock, then rubs the back of his neck and smiles a little sheepishly, as if he’s embarrassed.
They fall silent again, lying next to each other with their arms touching. John thinks that he can actually feel the minutes tick by as well. Like Sherlock, he is wide awake now, his heart beating quickly. When another ten minutes have passed, Sherlock snorts, sits up in bed and swings his legs to the floor. John sits up as well.
“Well, it doesn’t look like you’ve contracted frostbite. But according to the weather forecast temperatures are about to drop, so better have your gloves ready. Hope you’re not coming down with something. You’re usually not that sensitive to cold.”
“Did you like it, though?” Sherlock wants to know, despite the envy he feels for the unnamed stranger who’d been so intimate with John.
Lestrade is watching him and John curiously. “There’s a lot you’re not telling me. Come on, you two. You’re heading to the Yard with me for a full statement. But first we’re going to have a look upstairs to find that pink lady you’re talking about.”
John snorts, glaring at him good-naturedly but secretly glad that Sherlock is indeed okay and relaxed enough to tease him. He reaches for the sun-cream. “Anything else I can do for you today, your Highness?”
Sherlock accepts gratefully, looking relieved. They withdraw to the bar and remain there until the party winds down some time before midnight, exchanging gossip and what else they picked up pertaining to their investigation. Sherlock soon relaxes again, and John revels in his company and attention.
His room is dark, the blackout-curtain drawn, and he pulls it up and flings open the window to air out the room. He remains standing at the window for a while, listening closely to try and catch a sound from next door. But no noises issue from John’s room. He appears to be sleeping peacefully, nor does he snore loud enough for Sherlock to hear. He sighs, scolds himself for doing so, yet cannot help imagining how John might look in slumber. With a jolt, he remembers that he has actually seen him in that state, and has evidence to prove it. Fetching the drawing from his notebook, he takes it to the window and gazes at it in the dim light of the stars, feeling warmth spread through him. Even if John turns out to only regard him as a friend and there will never be more between them – as it should be, he doesn’t want to get John into trouble by suggesting an illicit relationship –, he will always have this: the drawing and the memory of creating it, of studying John’s features so closely that he believes they are forever imprinted in his mind, locked away in a special room that’s now reserved for John.
John begins to suck at his cupid’s bow before, feeling suddenly bold and daring, he touches the tip of his tongue to Sherlock’s lower lip, signalling his clear intention to be let in. Sherlock reacts with a full-bodied shudder before effectively freezing in place. For an instant, John fear’s he has been too forward, has spooked Sherlock. But then Sherlock copies the action. John opens his lips and allows his tongue to slip inside his mouth, before cautiously caressing it with his own. Again Sherlock trembles. His grip on John’s hip tightens. The hand resting against the door next to John’s face moves to the back of his neck, tilting his head so that they can fit their mouths together even better. A low sound reverberates in his chest and emerges from his throat as a moan. John, too, moans softly. As kisses go, this one wouldn’t rate very highly on a technical scale. But the emotional component, the honesty and sweetness and two weeks of desperate pining poured into and culminating in the action, is off the charts. Sherlock is heartbreakingly open and vulnerable, all his insecurity and self-doubt and lack of experience as well as his yearning and indeed love, because that’s what this must be, on full display.
“That’s what the owner claims, at least. But Dimmock has her in for questioning right now, the other employees will follow.”
“Suicide, clear as day,” chimes in his younger colleague. “Stressful job, nasty break-up with her fiancé, perhaps some family or money troubles on top of that, or a person dear to her lost in the war. Bound to shake up a girl’s head, isn’t it?”
John grins at him. He relishes Sherlock’s proximity. Their shoulders and legs are touching. Seeing them next to each other, he is amazed how large Sherlock’s feet are in comparison to his. “You mean spy on them.”
Lestrade sighs. “Unless you want to add something, yes. Sign here. You, too, Dr. Watson. Both of you may have to come in again tomorrow, though, depending on what we learn from Hope and whether we need more clarification. For now, get out of my sight. And thank you.”
His heart clenches with genuine fear. He’s at a clear disadvantage now. It’s only a matter of time until one of Moran’s blows hits his aim, and hits well. The next instant, his weapon is swept from his hand with a cunning stroke. Sherlock rolls out of the way of another which hits the rug next to his shoulder. The next one will hit true, he knows. And right enough, cool metal touches his throat. Moran’s heavy foot lands on his chest, pinning him to the rug and squeezing the breath out of his lungs. Sherlock, winded and immobile, can only stare up at him as he pants for breath. Down the blade of his sword, the tip of which rests at Sherlock’s throat, Moran looks down at him with dark glee. Game over.
In the end he ate one, as well as the peach and a cereal bar, and he drank half a bottle of water for good measure. John was pleased.
Putting away the phone, Sherlock grins and lies back again, watching John stretch and then amble off into the bathroom. He hears the toilet flush, John wash his hands and then brush his teeth, too. Sherlock’s heart begins to flutter in anticipation.
Despite the darkness, John thought he could see blood shoot into Sherlock’s pale cheeks. “Yes,” he said plainly. “I seem to have had a rather vivid dream just now and thought before I ... um ... discharge into my trousers again, I should get rid of them. Also, I imagine that it would be more pleasurable for both of us if you were involved in the shedding of said garment and your corresponding attire, and would actually prefer this active involvement to just posing as something for me to rut against.”
“From what I can tell, his injuries are moderate. Blow to the head, concussion, fatigue. But as I said, I’d like to make sure it’s nothing more serious than that. Also,” and here he steps closer to Lestrade and lowers his voice. Sherlock strains to catch what’s being said, but doesn’t manage to overhear every word. John’s expression is grave, though, when he says something about a panic attack.
“Perhaps she is doing Jim a favour,” muses Sherlock while the three of them watch the musicians return and begin to shift their seats and instruments around a little to make room in the middle of the stage. Looking up, Sherlock sees that someone has clambered up into the rigging above the stage and is arranging the lighting so that a bright beam falls onto the vacated spot.
Slowly, John reached out and brushed his hand along Sherlock’s cheek to then draw his head down. Sherlock sighed and even sagged slightly as if in relief when John’s lips met his. At first, he let himself be kissed gently as if uncertain how (or with what intensity) to reply, before gradually easing into the kiss. It remained a slow, tender if lengthy affair, lips and tongues moving gently together before John drew back.
Suddenly, the dark thoughts are back. John tries to extricate himself from Sherlock’s embrace, but finds he can’t. Sherlock continues to hold him, gently but firmly.
“Oh.” Suddenly, he jerked up his head and straightened in the saddle, his eyes blazing with inspiration. Fenja’s ears flicked back to him in alarm. Sherlock relaxed again, stroking her neck. She settled down again and resumed picking her way over the uneven ground.
“Mr. Holmes,” the girl addresses him somewhat breathlessly, “there are three police officers waiting for you outside.”
Watson scratches his head behind his ear. “Well, if we go by the spelling mistake, if there was indeed one and it wasn’t the radio operator’s or the listener’s fault, he’s likely from Northern Germany, perhaps the Hamburg area. He’s either tired or distracted, hence the misspellings. He’s homesick, or thinking of home, at least, which caused him to subconsciously revert back to his local dialect. Perhaps he has been at sea a long time
Kit watches the fences and nods. They fall silent. Soon, the fences are replaced by silos and large tanks of the petrochemical works that line this stretch of coast. John understands why people prefer the South of France. This
“Sometimes a little more communication from him would be desirable, but that goes for me as well. But as for the rest, I wouldn’t want it any other way. It’s never boring, that’s for sure.”
Sarah grins and winks at him. “Anybody I don’t know about? Don’t tell me you dated Greg, Sally or Sam, too.”
enjoying himself, because John looks so happy and carefree next to him, very much in his element. Leaning over to him, “Don’t worry, I am enjoying the view,” Sherlock tells him.
But for now, most riders are in a celebratory mood. Lyons and Bainbridge are actively looking forward to the flat stages, Anderson is glad that there won’t be any serious competition for the polka-dot jersey until the Pyrenees. The only person not really joining in the impromptu after-dinner party on the long balcony is Sherlock. He vanishes immediately after the team meeting, during which he sat with his eyes glued to his phone, his expression grave and thoughtful. He only looked up when footage from Wiggins’ crash was shown. So far, no news about his injuries or the particular circumstances of his accident have been released. Brook Consulting issued a brief statement to the press and on their website and social media outlets to announce that he was in a stable condition and that everybody wished him a speedy recovery.
Aunt Mabel looks at him with a hint of pity. “Mostly sweets, I bet. Ellie isn’t exactly known for providing a healthy diet, although her scones are really good. Come into the kitchen. I’ll make you a sandwich. And you’ll have some of the salad, too. You need the vitamins.”
“What’s that?” enquired Sherlock when he returned, nodding towards the screen where the opening scenes of a movie were playing, showing a man sitting in a jeep illuminated by golden afternoon light, an instrumental version of “Stand by me” playing. Sherlock was dressed in dark trousers and his purple shirt under his blue dressing gown. It looked less formal and refined than his usual attire, but still smart.
Sherlock smiles at him indulgently. “As I said, we’ll see.” He yawns and stretches. His leg rubs against John’s, making John’s breath hitch. Sherlock notices and swallows slightly. He doesn’t move his leg, however.
“Am I?” enquired Sherlock lightly. “Interestingly, the traces you left online rather prove my accusations, Mr. Hutchinson. Yes, you work here, but only because you need the money, and because you saw it as a good opportunity to cover your tracks while sitting right at the source of your criminal dealings. In truth you dislike your work here. You resent the fact that your brother and his wife are running the place while you are left with what you consider menial tasks. Your failed career as a dressage rider due to an accident moreover gave you a deep loathing of horses, especially high performance ones. This dislike includes their owners, whom, according to some of your comments on your twitter account, you detest for their ‘poshness’ and – how did you call it –‘Overblown self-importance and pretended expertise’?”
Sherlock gives him another of his long, penetrating, thoughtful looks, eventually inclining his head. “The arrangement as it stands is fine. I don’t mind sharing a room with you, nor even a bed. I discovered the latter to my surprise. I feared it would be much more ... intrusive. I don’t know what the matter was last night. Probably a combination of several things. For one, the mattress certainly was to blame.”
Lestrade nodded, watching the competition for a moment before turning back to John and taking a sip from his beverage. “Don’t yet know what to make of him as an officer. He’s eager, certainly, good references, too, but no sense of humour whatsoever. Actually surprised me by joining us tonight. Didn’t have him down as the sociable type. Sally’s wary of him. She fears he might endanger her promotion by playing himself into the foreground. He’s certainly been keen to catch the Chief Superintendent’s attention. Wonder what His Highness will make of him. I’m really interested in his verdict. When’s he due back?”
Still, particularly Wilkes’ and Ricoletti’s plans seem to be paying off. Between the constant attacks from their teams, they have whittled down the group of favourites to a chosen few, some of whom are merely clinging on (like John), unable to launch an attack of their own and increase the punishing speed even more. Soon, the group around Trevor in the yellow jersey is shedding
“The latter,” says Sherlock, his voice brusque. John gazes at him for a moment, then shrugs. “You don’t know what you’re missing out on, mate,” he states, clapping Sherlock’s shoulder amicably. Sherlock has to use considerable self-control not to lean into the touch, which seems to linger, more than a normal clap should have. It’s rather a squeeze, with John’s hand resting where on Sherlock’s upper arm where the shirtsleeve leaves the waistcoat, and he can feel its warmth and slight moisture through the fabric. It’s ... good. Sherlock wouldn’t mind if it went on a little longer.
“Brompton Road. That’s where the CCTV picked him up last. A taxi dropped him off at the Knightsbridge Tube Station entrance near Harrods at 19:56 last evening. He went inside the station, and he tapped in using his Oyster card. There is no footage of him boarding any train. The station was busy, and it seems he was trying to stay out of the range of the cameras. But he must have taken a train to South Kensington, because there his card tapped out again.”
He had spoken lightly, but even as he uttered the words, he knew that he’d overstepped an invisible mark.
“Yes, at the clinic,” the vet replied. “I’m going to drive there now and see if I can detect the clostridium botulinum in the samples, and if yes, I’ll get the antidote. Keep him hydrated,” he instructed the Hutchinsons with a worried glance at the stallion. “I’ll return as soon as I can. Inform the owner, even if they’re out of the country at the moment. This is serious.”
In the general classification, most of the main contenders are still very close. Sherlock lost time during the Morvan stage and is currently less than two minutes behind Victor Trevor, the man in yellow, and in ninth position overall. Although not exactly a GC rider, in pre-stage interviews Trevor told the press he was going to do his utmost to defend the jersey at least until tomorrow and hopefully even further. His team is expected to work for both him and his captain Ricoletti, to make sure the
There’s the small, nervous laugh Sherlock remembers so vividly. John’s eyes flick away from Sherlock’s and back again. “Right, okay.” He licks his lips.
“Yeah, that’s true. And you need a partner who’s okay with that, I guess, and you’d have to be okay with not seeing your partner for long spells. Gregson and Hopkins are spending most of their evenings on Skype to talk to their wives and kids. For me, cycling always came first. Sure, I had relationships. The one with Sarah was the longest and most serious. Had fun, too. Casual things, you know. Most of my relationships were like that, come to think of it. Somehow, I always thought that once I retired, I’d find someone to settle down with. But I haven’t really started looking. Everything that comes after Paris still seems so far away.”
A more sustained and dangerous escape attempt is launched when the peloton begins to ascend Port de Pailhères, the first of the two
“Less than two miles if she walked south and crossed the river via London Bridge. She seemed reasonably fit, so no problem there.”
Midnight has passed when finally, their teas drunk and Sherlock’s arm beginning to grow heavy because he hasn’t played in a while and is somewhat out of practice, they switch off the lights in living room and kitchen and retire to Sherlock’s bedroom. John has set his suitcase against the wall under the small window. His jacket is hanging in front of the wardrobe, the gold braid glinting dully in the dim light of the bedside lamp Sherlock has switched on. His pyjamas are already lying on the cover. Sherlock notices that he has instinctively chosen the side he used to occupy when they shared a bed – albeit a much narrower one – in Bletchley, and at Mycroft’s house in London on one occasion.
Sherlock nods. “According to Hereford Police, where he filed a complaint, he believes ‘those fucking environmentalists and animal-cuddlers’ are behind it. They viewed the CCTV – or what there was of it, because there appears to have been a glitch or short black out. But didn’t his sheep, or at least some of them, turn up during the following days?”
They look at each other and simultaneously begin to laugh. Sherlock has no idea what exactly is so funny about their situation, but he feels laughter bubble up in him like boiling water in a narrow test tube. John has buried his face in his neck, but this time he isn’t licking or sucking or nibbling, but laughing and laughing and laughing. His whole body is shaking, he is giggling like a man possessed. Sherlock can feel some wetness on his skin. Apparently John is laughing so hard he is crying. He, too, holds on to John, buries his face in his hair, and laughs so much he is soon gasping for air. John, too, struggles for breath when he surfaces and beams down at Sherlock.
Sherlock sits very straight and still, not daring to move, nor knowing what exactly to do with his free hand. With a jerk, John releases his other to hold on to Sherlock’s right shoulder, too, as he presses himself closer as if trying to crawl into Sherlock’s chest. Hesitantly, Sherlock raises his right hand, lets it hover briefly over John’s nape, before very gently placing it there and cradling John’s head like a fragile treasure. Slowly, he sneaks his other hand up until it lies on John’s sweaty back. Sherlock begins to rub gentle circles on the damp fabric of the vest. That’s what people do when they try to offer comfort to the distressed, isn’t it? Pat their backs, whisper nonsense? He feels completely out of his depth.
he thinks, grinning to himself. Glancing over his shoulder at Sherlock, the other flashes him a brief but genuine smile. John’s heart leaps. He feels giddy like a teenager with butterflies in his stomach, and wonders if Sherlock is similarly affected.
“Yes,” agrees Sherlock, smiling and winking at Mrs. Hudson, who rolls her eyes and hides her grin behind her tea-cup, “how fortunate.”
She draws a deep breath again and sniffs slightly, finally giving up on her hair. Mrs. Suffield makes a sympathetic sound, and brushing past Sherlock on the stairs, she hugs her. “Oh poor dear, we just heard the news. It’s altogether dreadful. But come, I’ll make you some tea.”
Sherlock inclined his head, waiting for John to walk past him. He switched off the light as John advanced down the corridor, then followed silently.
John put away the shopping, then started to prepare dinner. Eventually, Sherlock sidled up to him and peered over his shoulder. Then he sniffed and stepped back with a faint noise of disgust.
“But you almost did. And I’m sure you heard what the general consensus is: the conditions played against you. The rain and particularly the wind cost you about twenty seconds. Meaning under normal conditions, you’d clearly have won.”
Raising his eyes from the tarmac when he drew near the next hairpin bend, he saw that Sherlock had dropped back a little and was riding next to him, watching him keenly. “Alright?” he asked, and John felt another rush of emotion. He was sure Sherlock knew what he had been thinking about, and for his friend, the self-professed sociopath, to react to his emotional distress was a rare occurrence. He knew Sherlock cared, in his own, curious way, but most of the time he either didn’t bother showing it, or didn’t dare.
Sherlock is pricking up his ears. The man has raised his voice over the din. It’s rather high-pitched and laced with an unmistakable Irish lilt.
“Which one is the sharp mountain over there?” Kit wants to know. “The one that looks like a jagged tooth. Looks pretty high.”
John seems absent, though, lost in his own head. Tired, too. At one point, the hair-stroking stops. Sherlock feels the weight of John’s head settle on his shoulder. His heart misses a beat, and he smiles. John’s proximity still does this to him, catches him by surprise and causes his body to react in interesting and somewhat frightening ways. Sherlock shifts slightly so that John can rest more comfortably against him. 221B is quiet but for the occasional creak of the old house and noises of cars or pedestrians passing outside. About an hour ago, Mrs. Hudson left to visit Mrs. Turner next door. Darkness has fallen, the streetlamps are casting the living room into warm, orange hues. The fire in the fireplace has almost burned down, but Sherlock is too comfortable and too engrossed in studying dozing John next to him to do anything about it.
“The weekend before last. I was in town to view this venue, and visited her in the village where she lives. Lived. Beautiful little church. Lovely. But she didn’t seem different from before.”
“I am fully aware of it. But the message is addressed to us, John and me.” He held it up for Lestrade to read while he explained about the pen and paper. Lestrade’s face paled at the implication.
“We saw the videos,” says Ricoletti darkly. “But we don’t know what made him do it. Marco didn’t want to talk about it. He seemed very unhappy about the whole thing. And
An excited exclamation from the commentators caused his attention to revert back to the TV. One of the riders chasing the lone escapee had missed a turn during the descent, taking an involuntary shortcut down a short rocky slope onto the stretch of road below, to there narrowly escaping being overrun by one of the accompanying motorcycles. Luckily, he had not sustained any major injuries apart from scratches. His bike, however, was severely damaged, and his team’s car with the spares some distance behind.
They gaze at each other and begin to chuckle. “I don’t think I have a thing for sombreros,” says John. “But who knows. You in a sombrero and nothing else ... I’m sure that’ll turn me on. Actually, you could be wearing anything or nothing at all and I’d be ... you know ... interested.”
Sherlock stands and turns to him. “It’s no use, John.” He runs both hands through his hair, looking distraught.
“Yes. I recognise him from the article a few years ago, and from the more recent photograph Lestrade had at his desk. Pity he’s dead. There were a number of questions I wanted to ask him.”
His tone and choice of words rattle John, shaking his bravado. It’s happened before, he understands. Sherlock’s brother has been there, has seen him in hospital hooked to all kinds of machines because Sherlock couldn’t cope with life and employed illicit measures to improve – or end – it. The thought sends an icy ripple down John’s back. The way Sherlock spoke about his addiction made it sound like a minor inconvenience, something controlled and of marginal danger. But in Mycroft’s assessment it’s far more serious. The truth may lie in the middle, but it’s serious enough.
The remark comes with such dry seriousness that Sherlock actually lets out a laugh, startling Hattie who’s been prowling round their legs under the table in thehope of more milk.
John inclines his head. “Some minor modifications will be required, but yes.” He gazes at each of his teammates in turn and lets out a long breath. “Thank you for having me,” he says at length, sounding as if it’s costing him greatly to admit this. “And for giving me this chance. I do appreciate it, even though it might not look like it.”
“That’s true, it isn’t unusual. It does, however, rule out that the lipstick and make-up stains on the handkerchief were from Jenny herself. Moreover, we’ve encountered that particular shade in connection with Jennifer Wilson before. As I mentioned before, I recall seeing traces of the same or at least a very similar lipstick – crimson, not pink – on the collar of Jenny’s jacket when we found her in the quarry. Even had she been wearing red herself – which she didn‘t –, by its position, the stain could not easily have been caused by her own lips. Quite some contortion would have been necessary for her to touch her lips to that spot. And the tiny touch of lipstick on her ear ... almost impossible, even if her ear touched her collar to receive the lipstick stain from there.”
Sherlock can smell them as he approaches. The majority of the flock is further southwards where the grassy slopes fall gently towards clumps of trees and bushes, hedgerows, and fenced-in farmland, until they rise to another hill. The path Sherlock is following continues along the ridge of the hill beyond the tree-ring, descending gently to what looks like another gate, and a strange, large structure. At first, Sherlock thinks it might be a hut or a small house. It’s oblong, yet strangely rounded. As he draws closer, he sees that it seems to be made of rusty metal. A water tank, perhaps. It’s still too far away to see clearly. He vows to explore it later.
“Don’t pretend you didn’t require me to,” snapped Sherlock tersely. “I did your dirty work, the stuff you can’t officially let your agents do. If anything, it was highly convenient for you that I was ‘dead’. If Moran is a hired gun now, I wasn’t much better, only that I didn’t have the advantage of a sniper’s rifle most of the time but actually had to get my hands dirty, often in the true sense of the word.”
“Still, you can’t deny you’re a bit of an adrenaline junkie. I’ve watched footage of some of last year’s Tour stages, and some other recordings of our team’s performance. I’ve seen how you ride in the mountains. You’re one of the best descenders I know. You’re one of the few riders who on the descents can actually gain back the time you lose on the climbs. Few people have your courage, matched by your impeccable balance and control of the bike. In addition, there is a streak of recklessness, almost abandon when you ride downhill. It’s impressive and quite exhilarating to watch. Obviously, your time riding these cumbersome mountain-bikes was good for something, after all.”
“Well, I wasn’t thinking much while the snogging lasted.” John sighed. “But I do feel overwhelmed by your … eagerness sometimes, particularly when …,” he shrugged, not quite knowing how to phrase what he wanted to say without hurting Sherlock. The other straightened even more to bring some distance between their shoulders and gazed at John expectantly.
Somewhere, a sheep bleats, pulling Sherlock out of his thoughts. He turns and looks back toward the edge of the tree-ring, squinting a little against the bright sunlight. He can make out a small group of sheep grazing near the dyke. They are still fluffy in their winter wool and look slightly dishevelled. Sherlock thinks they must be warm, and wonders when they will be shorn. Some lambs are skipping about playfully. Sherlock watches them for a while, until the crack of a small twig makes him turn and scan the small grove ahead of him.
Sherlock nods. “I’ll need to see the girl’s room and talk some more to her parents and old Ms. Cushiel, the neighbour, but I think I know what happened.”
last leave is months ago. Would be helpful to look at U-boats that are known to have been out there for a while, if we’re after their positions. So yes, perhaps he’s indeed been thinking of his girl back home, or his wife and kids, or … I don’t know … his childhood dog, or his Mum’s pie, or his favourite football club or something.”
Wilkes is struggling. He is holding on to the team car far longer than he ought to – even riding in a car’s or motorcycle’s slipstream is penalised, as of course is letting oneself be pulled along by a vehicle, although exceptions are made if a rider is injured and receiving treatment. John watches how the doctor cleans the bleeding wounds as best he can and then administers a jab into Wilkes’ thigh – probably a painkiller. It seems to help, though, because eventually, Wilkes lets go of the car and begins to find a more regular rhythm, helped along by his teammates, six of whom have returned to his aid now. John and a few other riders are happy to join the train which slowly picks up speed and begins the pursuit of the peloton, hoping to bridge the distance between the two groups before the next climb. The slopes of Côte de Saint-Maurice are already visible ahead, rising out of small fields and meadows bordered by hedgerows. Behind it loom more hills, blueish in the summerly haze, with Haut-Folin rising above them, its peak marked by an antenna. The road is ascending gently all the time, passing small settlements decorated in expectation and celebration of the Tour, with folk groups in local traditional garb and farmers in simple work clothes standing alongside tourists and hobby cyclists in colourful gear. Some have put out chairs and tables. Often, the road is painted with the names of favourite riders. John can’t help smiling each time he rolls over a large “WATSON” or “GO JOHNNY W” painted on the tarmac.
Sherlock is in two minds about the cycling. One the one hand, every time John sets out on his old road bike, Sherlock can’t help feeling a frisson of worry. News about cyclists getting killed by HGVs or other vehicles on London’s roads are aplenty. Certainly John knows how to look after himself, but given the unpredictability of traffic, bad luck could strike at any time despite all care and caution. On the other hand, though, John does look more toned. Sherlock tries not to gaze at his thighs and calves for too long because it does funny things to his insides. He has lost weight, too, quite a lot. So much, in fact, that both Mrs. Hudson and indeed Sherlock have taken to nagging him to eat – quite a reversal of their usual roles, in Sherlock’s case.
Victor grimaces. “We’ll see how the next climb goes. I’d rather make it to the top instead of taking a ride in a team car or, worse, the broom wagon.” He gazes at John. “Thank you, Watson,” he says earnestly.
He cast a glance at Sherlock’s profile illuminated by his phone’s bright glow, and at their reflections in the window. The train had long set into motion and behind their faint mirror images London’s East End was rushing past as they were nearing Stratford.
“If you want to know, I was wondering about how you received those scars,” John defended himself. Well, that was at least part of the truth.
Sherlock frowns at his phone. Now this is interesting. It’s what he deduced from his aunt and uncle’s behaviour, but it’s good to see Mycroft confirming it.
He falls silent because around them, people have begun to shush and hiss to shut them up. Irene Adler is still holding the rose when she begins to address the audience, thanking them for their warm welcome and expressing how much she enjoys being back in London. Her Bostonian accent is far more noticeable now than back in Bletchley. Sherlock is convinced that it’s part of the act, to seem more exotic, perhaps.
Eventually, John clears his throat. “Sorry for running out like that. I shouldn’t have, not with you ...”
“What does sex have to do with either Saint George or the dragon?” Sherlock thinks for a moment, recalling depictions of the saint and the creature in combat. “Or both?”
John was pleased to note that Sherlock seemed to have continued to put on weight in recent months. His oddly proportioned but strangely aesthetic frame always reminded John of 1930s and 40s film stars in high-waisted trousers that shortened their torsos and lengthened their legs. Sherlock was still slim, but he looked fit and healthy now, a far cry from the scrawny, wrung out, haunted looking creature that had returned from God-knew-where about four months ago.
“You’d be in trouble if there was a law against my irresistible charm,” says John. His foot continues to rub against Sherlock’s leg, raising goose-flesh in its wake. Sherlock thinks he can feel the touch further up as well. He’s beginning to sweat. He swallows, reaching up to loosen his tie and widen the collar of his shirt. “I’m in trouble regardless.” He lets out a long breath and casts down his eyes. “And there
Sherlock sits up straighter, listening closely to any unusual sound, and straining his eyes to catch the slightest movement between the trees. For a long time, nothing happens. He is almost disappointed, when suddenly, he hears the rustle of leaves on the ground, and the snag of a small branch. Sliding from his seat, he quickly digs the shaped flint out of his pack, keeping his eyes fixed on the source of the sound. It came from a dense clump of trees. There it is again. Sherlock thinks that this time, he even spotted movement behind one of the trunks. Something large and dark is hiding there, larger than a bird or squirrel. Could be a sheep, but it seemed taller.
“Yes, I know. But could you do without this?” asks John, scooting even closer and snuggling against Sherlock’s side, his right arm slung possessively over his belly.
“I told you I’d be more than willing, Sherlock,” John tells him earnestly. “But there’s no rush. I’ll have a look at your manual, okay? Perhaps I’ll make one of my own.”
loves him, enough, apparently, to take a bullet for him. John was prepared to die for Sherlock. Sherlock lets out a tremulous breath, not knowing how to deal with the implications of this revelation, nor with the signals his body is sending, overriding the pain in his leg. They’re very close of a sudden. At some point, Sherlock had slung his arm round John’s shoulders to hold on to him. His side is pressed against John’s. John’s undamaged arm has snaked round his waist and is holding him firmly. Sherlock feels faint, his head is spinning, and knows that neither has to do with injury or exhaustion, nor even with the dratted Champagne. His heart is beating furiously. Despite the cool air, he feels hot. His shirt collar seems too tight when he swallows again.
Now, “John, come cycling,” Sherlock would ask instead. John never refused, even when the weather was bad as it so often was this spring, or he had just returned from a long shift at the clinic. Sherlock claimed cycling helped calm and clear his mind, and while that seemed true, John also knew he simply enjoyed cruising his beloved London, the city he had missed and yearned for so passionately during his exile.
“Yes. I have a feeling that the length of the message wasn’t the only reason for both the women here at Knockholt marking it ‘urgent’ and Jennifer Wilson paying particular attention to it. There must be something else. Also, remember that Jennifer wrote down two rows of letters, similar but with variables. Perhaps it’s more than one message we are looking for.”
John makes a small snuffling sound but doesn’t wake. Sherlock laughs happily, kisses the top of his head, before lying back to begin renovations of his John Watson Wing. He’s in no hurry, though. He might even sleep a little tonight. It’s so warm and comfortable, and John’s breathing is very soothing. And after all, he’s got years ahead to perfect the structure. It’s going to be a most enjoyable task.
Sherlock picks up the letter he was reading originally and finishes deciphering it. The last few paragraphs don’t shed any more light on the identity of the ‘singer from Boston’. Hedwig goes on about her horses, some new foals that were born in May and that show promise. She finishes expressing hope that the war will be over by Christmas.
“You’re much better than I. At least you’re honest, with yourself and others, even if this honesty hurts at times. But I ... I called you a ‘machine’ once despite knowing that’s the exact opposite of what you are. I hit you when you returned from the dead instead of hugging you and telling you how much I’d fucking missed you. I married somebody else and made you Best Man and stand by and watch. I was angry at you for so long when in truth I was angry at myself, blamed you for stuff you never did, blamed all of my failings on you. What kind of messed up arsehole does all that to a person he loves most in the world? Honestly, Sherlock, you should think twice about this, about getting involved with me.”
“Good night, John,” replies Sherlock, swallowing as he watches John hang up the gown. The warm glow in his chest is back, and it stays as he lies in his own bed, his heart beating quick and strong. This entire encounter has been strange and unreal and quite wonderful, despite the implication of John being in love with someone else. Sherlock sighs and closes his eyes. He’s been called ‘extraordinary’ and ‘amazing’, all in the course of one hour. That’s quite something, isn’t it?
Sherlock’s relieved exhale is not lost on John. He sits up straighter. “I didn’t attempt to blow it up,” he returns. “It was an accident, I told you.”
“All right. Let me just enquire about breakfast tomorrow. The drinks and meals went on our slate. Mr. Cook said we can pay for everything in the morning.”
Sherlock shrugs. He’s been called a cold-hearted bastard and emotionless freak, but even he has a conscience. He doesn’t consider himself a morally ‘good’ man, whatever that means. Certainly not as good and brave and selfless as this conscientious doctor opposite him is, but he, too, would be troubled by having the deaths of so many weighing him down. “Well, that’s why you’re not a politician or one of the war-mongers in Whitehall. That’s why you were in the thick of things and took a bullet to save others, and almost lost your life.”
After a careful sip of her sweetened tea, Molly begins to narrate how she discovered Jennifer Wilson’s body in the quarry on her way to work, and her subsequent arrival at Sherlock’s and John’s billet.
John gazed at him, taking in his stern, concentrated expression. He sighed. “So what do you want to hear from me? Want me to describe to you how sex works?”
Sherlock seemed to sense the wave of sentiment crashing over John. He shifted a little, his arms tightening around John before one of his hands wandered to his hair and began to pet it gingerly. “Does it help?” he asked, a trace of insecurity in his voice. John felt the words rumble in his chest and smiled.
again. He needs to keep the younger of the French riders in check, however, if he wants to keep his white jersey, and can’t risk losing any time.
Dimmock nodded, looked uncertain for a moment, likely at being ordered about by a civilian, then making a fluttering gesture, he picked up his jacket and turned to leave. Molly gave John a meaningful glance before busying herself with covering up the body again. John stepped over to Sherlock.
“No, but let me tell you something. Sherlock may be ace, but I’ve put actual money on the possibility that he is as crazy about you as you are about him when it comes to romantic love. The way he looks at you whenever he thinks you’re not watching ... in any cartoon he’d be making heart-eyes at you. I admit that the timing is somewhat shit, with the Tour and everything. Just don’t be a dick towards him and sort out things between you once the race is over. Aren’t you planning to become flatmates in London? Would he offer a flatshare to a bloke he doesn’t like?”
Sherlock snorts softly, and half turns to peck John’s nose. “John, until you came along, I didn’t lean towards anybody. Yes, there were a few times when I thought a man looked attractive. But I never pursued anybody. The mere thought appalled me, and to be honest, it also scared me a little. Still does, in fact. And why would I have done so, anyway? It would only have made things worse for me. I would have exposed myself to more scorn and ridicule, and worse, aggression, had I flaunted by inclination publicly. Things were difficult enough for me as they were. To have my peers know that I fancied one of them ... unthinkable. Also, this kind of intimacy requires two willing parties. You’re the first person who has ever wanted me, both as a friend and a lover.”
“Leave it to me,” panted Sherlock, depositing his holdall and the bike-bag at John’s side. Wiping sweat from his forehead and running a hand through his hair before straightening his jacket and drawing himself up, he strode up to the desk to the complaints of several people in the queue which he carelessly and confidently pushed out of the way.
providing drink, sustenance, and an occasional windshield for his teammates. Sherlock keeps to himself, seemingly lost in his head as he rolls along in the large peloton. He does take the water bottle John offers him but doesn’t initiate any conversation. John hopes for things to improve after the stage. He didn’t like Sherlock’s talk about having to spend more time with Victor Trevor. But at least now they aren’t making any contact. Trevor is riding with his own teammates, easy to pick out amid their group because of his white and rainbow-coloured world champion jersey.
“Hey there,” John said quietly. “Sorry about … well … eavesdropping. I just wanted to check on you. And … er … bring you some things.” He held out the clothes to Sherlock who gazed at them briefly but didn’t make a move to take them.
“Surprised?” asked Sherlock, lowering the device and gazing at John, one eyebrow raised in challenge.
Sherlock snorts into his hair. “Yes, of course I’d move on from the one and only true love of my live. How utterly preposterous, John. You really are an idiot sometimes, do you know that?”
Something tingles in the back of his mind at the thought, but it’s too wispy to grasp, and he doesn’t pursue it because the song starts in earnest now. A number of people have started to dance. John and he are jostled about. They withdraw to the relative quiet closer to the bar, where, to Sherlock’s delight, the strange man with the scar has also arrived. He is smoking again and has ordered a Gin and Tonic which he is sipping slowly while watching The Woman like a tiger his prey. Sherlock sidles closer to catch a whiff of the cigarette.
They have reached the end of the peloton again, which is still riding at moderate speed – a wise decision given the heat. It’s early afternoon now, and the asphalt unbelievably hot. The wind, which isn’t strong, is coming from a south-easterly direction. This means that the riders will be facing a head wind all the way down to Canterbury, making coordinating who leads and accordingly rides in the wind all the more important so as not to wear oneself out too soon. Drafting in the peloton’s slipstream, on the other hand, is fairly comfortable and takes decidedly less effort. It does, however, require concentration, particularly when roads are narrow, bends and roundabouts are to be navigated, and the riders are riding closely together. The danger of touching another rider’s rear wheel with one’s bike and thus causing a crash in a tightly packed group is always present. It takes practice to ride in a peloton. John wonders how it must be like for Sherlock, who hasn’t ridden in a group this size for a long time. He seems to be managing well, however, riding his road bike as elegantly and efficiently as his time trial machine.
