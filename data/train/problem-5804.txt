Hank was about to point out that no, they did not in fact "all know what happened," when Tony reached up and, with obvious reluctance, pulled his helmet off.
"Clint," Hank said, as he started to power up the various pieces of scanning equipment they had acquired courtesy of Stark industries and Reed Richards, "go call Don Blake. Or, no, call Strange. He's the one that's been working on Tony."
"This isn't West Virginia, Morgan. Do you not read the newspapers anymore? Because that would explain why your investments always do so badly."
Tony frowned, clearly about to protest this, and then his eyes widened slightly and he glanced around at the wreckage of the lab.  "Where's Doom?"
"So, can you-" Peter started.
we defining slept with?"
Carol sighed, pushing her hair out of her face with one hand. "No," she said. "Tony's actually downplaying how nerve-wracking having everyone sit in judgment of you is."
“I didn’t know you were interested in cooking, Clint.”  The tone of her voice wasn’t actually mocking, but Clint had known her long enough to be able to tell that she was mocking him anyway.
"Oh good."  Jessica Drew walked  out into the hall.  She was wearing a very red, very tight dress, and  the four-inch heels on her equally red shoes left little dents in the  carpet.  "The last establishment we had a team bonding experience at  won't let any of us come back."
"But..." Tony shook his head; the thought of Agatha Harkness, Reed Richard's friend, Wanda's mentor, as an ally of Loki just didn't make sense. "Why would she care who ruled Asgard?"
"Great. If there are no major problems, then, now we can trade off." Jan locked her fingers together and stretched her arms above her head. The motion threw the curves of her body into momentary sharp relief, and Hank watched appreciatively. If he were in Clint's position at that moment, Jan's breasts would have been higher than his head, more than twice the size they usually were. The thought made him pettily glad that Clint hadn't chosen that moment to look up.
"Right," Ms. Marvel said, looking away. "I'll go deal with Jan." She turned back to Peter for a moment. "Thanks for helping out. You didn't have to."
ooOOoo
"It was like that fear toxin thing all over again, huh?" the EMT asked. He folded his skinny frame down to peer at one of the victims, frowning, then turned to his partner. "DeSoto, can I get some help with a stretcher?"
Underneath it was a robotic understructure, the silvery metal "skull" reminding her of the Terminator after its human face had melted off.  It was almost disappointing; she'd always wondered what Doom looked like under that mask.  A hideous mass of scar tissue, or some other terrible disfigurement worthy of the Phantom of the Opera, or a relatively normal-looking face that he'd decided to cover up out of pure melodrama?  Either one seemed possible.
something instead of just sitting in a climate controlled conference room while Hank and Jan were at Doom's mercy.
“We thought we were going to have to interrogate Doom about your whereabouts,” Sharon was saying.  “Until Stark contacted us.  Thor just grunted at me when I asked him, so I’m asking you.  Where is Dr. Pym?”
Whereas he--  it had never been like that between the two of them.  Maybe if things had gone differently at some point, if she hadn’t fallen so hard for Vision, and if he’d never met Bobbi, but as it was… the only time anything had ever happened between them, they had both been under mind-control.
Sam shouldered Steve out of the way and reached the door first — retaliation for the shove —  then hesitated, half-turning.  "If Doom's really working with Loki, are we sure wherever he's taken them is even in this dimension?"
And the final phase of testing on the geothermal energy project had just been completed yesterday, and...
"Master's?" Wanda forced back the dizziness from the drugged tea, thanking whatever powers watched over witches and mutants that she had only taken a few sips of it, and raised her hands, letting her chaos power gather around them.
"You didn't," Sam said.  "I wasn't sleeping."  The way he was rubbing at his eyes and blinking made that a lie.
Tony's blood had normal levels of testosterone and estrogen, his DNA had returned to normal... his blood chemistry
They'd argued again this time, despite the lower stakes, over Wanda's return and Simon's refusal to come back to New York and see her. Hellrung was all for facing down your problems with a positive attitude, or at least with long-suffering endurance. Jessica, for once, had been in total agreement with him – she'd kept enough secrets in the rest of her life to prefer brutal honesty in relationships, she'd said.
"Damaged," Steve repeated slowly. "What kind of damage?"
"I know why some victims are more strongly affected than others," Hank announced, not looking up from what he was doing. "One of the compounds that causes the endocrine reaction bonds with serotonin in the brain and becomes inert. They can't have meant it to do that; it must be an oversight."
"He probably did, but that sounds almost too convenient to be true. I wanted to believe it wasn't her, that she wouldn't do that to us, and so I couldn't trust the part of me that wanted to believe her, especially not when everyone else was accepting it all so easily. Simon doesn't do suspicious well, but if he lets himself believe it's really her, and then it's not... And I can't tell him what Clint told me. There are some things he doesn't need to hear."
"It's not your bad leg that's the problem."  Hank pulled at Don's clothes with huge hands, as if searching for injuries. There were fresh, red abrasions at his wrists, and Don found himself automatically thinking of rusty chains and dirt and wondering when Hank had had his last tetanus shot.  "You're covered in blood.  What did-" and then he found the stab wound and sucked in a sharp, sudden breath.
Gustave grunted as she ducked past him, then screamed. His blood sprayed warm against her back.
"I'm on the verge of a breakthrough with the DNA analysis." Hank's voice rang with a particularly irksome variety of enthusiasm, one that indicated that he would likely pay no heed to what others said. "I can tell. If I just run one more test-"
Steve had also been secretly sucked in, though he hadn't really understood some of the jokes; there were times when it was easy to forget that he was from another time, and then there were times like that, when you remembered that he had missed the entire cold war. Steve...
"It can't be mind control," Clint protested. He wished it were. It would be an awfully convenient explanation for the memory loss, and it would mean that it wasn't his fault. "She didn't even know she had powers."
He hit the concrete with bone-jarring force.  He struggled to breath for an endless moment, lungs paralyzed by the impact, and then everything faded away.
Tony blinked, expression uncertain for second, then smiled. It was only a little forced. "That's because you usually aren't one. I only have to remind you that there are options you're not considering once in a while."
"Which would mean he didn't want you to know," Don shot back.
The doctors had finished with both her and Sam in a matter of minutes, but Steve had insisted that they brief SHIELD on what had happened here rather than going to a conference room; Tony would have been grateful not to be cut out of things, but he suspected that Steve just didn't want to leave him.
Carol banked the quinjet to the left, and the huge tower at One Times Square no longer blocked their view of the streets below.  A huge circle of green flame surrounded Times Square, blocking off everything within a three-block radius.  Steve could see at least one driver standing on the sidewalk beside their stopped car, yelling and throwing things at the flames.  From the flickers of light around the circle's edges, some people were taking pictures of it.
"Are you sure?" Clint said dubiously, raising his eyebrows slightly. "I could try getting a telepath or Dr. Strange or somebody to un-mind-whammy me."
Zemo, however, they were extremely pleased to see, or at least visibly amused by. Steve was sure he heard a few snickers as they - very carefully - cuffed him and led him away.
It probably should have been creepy, but instead Steve found himself blinking hard, touched by the careful treatment of his carelessly discarded sketches in a way he couldn't describe.
How could she expect Hank to keep trying when around every turn, there was something to remind him of the mistakes he'd made? The mistakes they'd both made.
"Of course she'll stab us in the back," Hank was insisting, one hand flailing angrily through the air. "Supervillains
The guard's head hit the concrete floor with a loud crack, and he went limp.
Sam took two long steps forward and reached up, letting her lock her hands around his forearms. Unlike Tony and Carol, he didn't have any independent means of propulsion; his hard-light wings allowed him to glide, but not take off from a standing start. He needed a tall building or someone to act as a tow plane.
"I'll try not to," Wanda managed.  Part of her was surprised at how normal she sounded, when the rest of her wanted to scream, or cry with frustration at being so helpless, or curl into a ball and hope Chthon would overlook her if she were very still and quiet.  "Can you move?"
He wondered, on that first date to the museum, why it didn't feel strange to be 'on a date' with Steve, when they had been friends for years, and had belatedly realized that it was because they had been friends for years that it felt so natural. They had essentially been dating since they'd met.
Footage of his shield in the middle of the expensive property damage the Avengers had caused was probably going to be on every news program in the city tonight, not to mention the front page of the
"Considering how much chaos energy Wanda detected in that room, it's probably not a coincidence that some photographer was looking at us at exactly the wrong moment."
He'd given it up for Jan, Tony knew, as much as he had for himself. Tony had told himself, during those brief hours when he'd thought the Extremis was dead, scoured out of him by the Mandarin's lightning, that the armor was a small price to pay for having Steve back. And it would have been, but giving it up one day at a time, knowing all the while that all he had to do was change his mind in order to have it back again... It was hard enough to fight that knowledge every time someone at the next table ordered a drink, or every time Logan had sliced the cap off a bottle of beer; he wasn't sure he could have managed to do it when it came to the armor.
Steve swayed backwards, easily evading Tony's right hook, then followed up with a swing at Tony's jaw that Tony just barely managed to block with his left forearm.
Tony grinned, and his eyes looked very blue.  “Great, then dance with me.  I want to see the expression on Assemblyman Liefeld's face when he has to watch Captain America dancing with another man.”  He nodded at the State Assembly's minority leader, who had carefully avoided greeting either of them when they arrived.
Hank resisted the impulse to ask Clint if the quinjet could go any faster. He knew perfectly well that it couldn't, and bothering Clint while he was pushing the plane to the limits of its flight envelope wasn't going to help.
When was the last time he'd eaten? he wondered. Maybe Steve had a point about coffee not actually being breakfast.
"Okay," Tony said. "I won't." It wasn't as if he'd had much of a choice, but Steve was stubbornly clinging to his dislike of the Extremis. "I'll be gone for three days," he added. "Don't let Clint destroy the tower." He didn't mention that it would be the longest span of time they would be apart since Steve had come back. He wasn't that pathetic.
"You used to drag him to these things all the time," she continued, relentlessly.
ooOOoo
Sam hissed through his teeth, snatching his — sock-clad — foot away.  "Your cat is really annoying.  You know that, right?"
Steve stopped in his tracks, going cold, the ache in his battered arm forgotten. "You mean that really was you? I thought the Russians were just taking advantage of your apparent temporary insanity to pin the blame for his death on you."
“We’re not most people.”
One good repulsor blast could destroy the spear, but—no, it was uru.   Nothing short of the fires of a volcano could damage it.   Damn it, they could have used Strange conscious.
Which was one way to refer to the couple of years after Odin had somehow erased Don out of existence, or separated him from Thor, or... Clint had absolutely no idea how the two of them worked, and never had. It was probably safer just not thinking about it too much.
Tony shook his head, waving the statement away. "I was just a thinly veiled excuse for the two of them to get into a fistfight." USAgent and Steve were like oil and water; they respected one another, or at least, Tony knew John respected Steve, and was pretty sure Steve returned at least some of that regard, or he'd never have let John carry his shield, but they didn't actually like one another.
"I can't stay here," he told Steve, giving logic one more try.  "No one else can fix the security system.  And I need to take a look at any data the mansion's sensors got when they teleported out, if there is any.  I might be able to track down their location that way, or at least give us a radius for how far away they could have gone."  The method of teleportation Doom used made it impossible to pinpoint exact coordinates without access to the machine itself, but the more power the teleportation took, the farther the distance teleported would be.
He’d make her leave in a few minutes.
He’d be very surprised if Hellrung hadn’t already heard it from Carol several times over, but just because she still resented him for stealing her boyfriend didn’t mean that Clint had anything against him.  He had never even met Hellrung in person.
The Night Nurse's clinic reminded Wanda of a high tech version of the MASH unit from that old TV show – there were cots instead of hospital beds in some of the rooms, and the operating table was built to be easily disassembled and moved when necessary. All the equipment looked temporary, portable.
She knew that voice. It was her aunt's voice. Aunt Agatha was dead...
And Steve... Steve had been livid, when Sal had shown it to him. Not, strangely, because he'd failed to accept or believe Tony's explanations, but because he
been doing two days after coming back from the dead.
"Can't you be a little late?" Steve asked, taking Tony by the wrist and pulling him up into a sitting position. He kept hold of Tony’s wrist for a moment longer, squeezing it lightly. "A quinjet can get you to DC in twenty minutes."
The office, when he left the elevator and the two awe-stricken men in business suits who had shared it with him, proved to be a cold, barren space. Massive windows let in sunlight, but the furniture was spare and angular, and everything gleamed black and silver, like rock limned with ice.
Saying 'I told you so,' would be petty. Steve lifted his hand from Tony's shoulder, letting it fall back to his side. "You could barely move last night. I think the side effects are pretty bad already."
Clint groaned, and Sam grabbed him by the wrist and hauled him to his feet. "Running builds character," he said, giving Clint a slap on the shoulder.
Steve's jaw tightened. "That doesn't mean I have to like it. And it doesn't mean it's right."
Okay, Steve probably couldn't actually fit both hands around Tony's waist, but that didn't mean that the urge to try wasn't there.
"You need sleep," Steve pointed out, forcing down the hurt caused by Tony's silent rejection. "If you swear on your repulsor gauntlets that you will go straight to bed, I'll let you leave on your own recognizance."
Doom didn't even look at him.  "I know you're awake, Dr. Blake.  Feigning unconsciousness will do you no good."
“That was when I was still possessed by Chthon, channeling his power.” She shook her head slowly.  “I don’t even remember doing it, or know how I did.”
He fired his jet boots, but even though flying was faster than running, it was still too slow.   Doom's fingers curled around the haft of the spear just as Steve's shield took him in the side.
Someone was petting his hair, Steve realized muzzily, an indeterminate amount of time later. Sam would mock him if he ever saw this, Clint too, but Steve found that he didn't really care. Tony stroking his hair was inexplicably soothing.
"What have you been doing in Oklahoma?" Clint had been to Oklahoma. There was nothing there to write home about.
Tony had killed someone. In the armor. Killing someone with his repulsor gauntlets was what started the downward spiral that nearly killed him in the first place; Steve would have sworn any oath someone cared to name that Tony would never willingly use his armor to kill again, not unless other people's lives were at stake.
problems, almost no one was ever interested in hearing about how the Foundation's investments were doing. It had been a major concern a few months ago, when the stock market had been going haywire, but the Foundation seemed to be weathering the current downturn just fine.
"You won't," Tony said. His pupils were huge and dark, making his eyes look grey. This close, Steve could almost count his lashes. "Please, Steve." His voice went low on Steve's name, breathy and needy in a way that made Steve's groin throb.
And what the hell he was going to say to Steve?
Tony tuned the radio chatter out as ambulances began reporting in, and gave his full attention to the two men and three women who had just exited the subway station, all of them writhing convulsively as sticky black goo began oozing over their skin. His helmet's air filters kept all foreign particles out, but if he'd taken it off, he knew the air would be heavy with the thick, cloying scent of cotton candy and burned sugar that always surrounded the Venom symbiote.
She was still wearing her Wasp costume. This newest version was another black and yellow number, with black tights and a bright yellow leotard, gloves, and boots. She'd originally started wearing that color combination to match Hank's Yellowjacket costume. He hadn't expected her to keep it.
By the time he returned to the mansion, the Helicarrier's engines repaired and Barnes under observation in SHIELD's infirmary, it was four in the morning, and Hank had long since gone back to Stark Tower.
"No, really, how?"
The hot flash of rage that filled Don was unexpected – his skin felt too tight, suddenly, his face hot, and he couldn't tell how much of the emotion choking him was his, and how much was Thor's. "You murdered Thor's brother!" he shouted at her. "What the hell do you think? He trusted you once and you betrayed him!" He had trusted him – her – like a brother, fought beside her, drunk mead with her and laughed with her and– The memories of Baldur convulsing in his arms, bubbles of blood at his lips while his breath wheezed with a wet, gluey note that Don's medical training recognized as the sound of someone drowning on the fluid in their lungs... were not his memories. They were still as vivid in his mind as the first time he'd ever had a patient flatline.
And he was just trying to distract himself from the awkwardness of a one-on-one conversation with Wanda.  Clint sighed inwardly, and made himself smile at her.  She was trying.  He could, too.
Strange fetched a fist-sized crystal ball down from one of the shelves and brought it over to her. "This is one of the Crystal Spheres of Contemplation," he said, holding it out to her. "If a magician meditates while holding it, his or her power and strength of will causes it to glow. The brightness of the light it emits will allow me to determine the amount of raw power you posses, and the steadiness of the light will reveal the strength of your mental discipline."
"I thought I'd help  you carry the drinks back to the table," Steve told him.  Then he  turned to the woman.  "Hi," he said, smiling politely.  "I'm Steve."  It  never hurt to be courteous.
Thor's fingers tightened around the grip of his hammer, and he turned away to say something to Jan.
"We're not denying it," Steve said, flatly, wanting to squash that idea before it could get off the ground. "I'm not lying about this when I don't have to." Not mentioning something was different from actively lying about it — he'd sworn never to do that again after he'd first woken up in this time, when he'd first realized that he couldn't be arrested or imprisoned for sex with men anymore. It had taken him much, much longer to work up to admitting that he might
"No, but left and counterclockwise have symbolic importance in more than one system of magic, left hands are ritually unclean in multiple cultures, and this is not important." Wanda stabbed a finger at Clint reprovingly, and he turned back to his phone conversation, shifting to put his back to them again.
Tony's eyebrows went up. "Did something happen?"
Jan landed on Steve's right shoulder with a thud, the weight of the electronics equipment in her arm making her uncharacteristically clumsy. "You tried to have your father killed by turning him into a living bomb," she said.
"You're doing it again," Rhodey said. "The woman doesn't lead, Tony."
Steve glanced down at his shirt front before he could stop him. "Nothing. It's fine."
, that whatever supernatural essence gods were composed of would come back if they gave it a body to inhabit. What they had gotten instead had been something else. Something... emptier.
"I do not. And you should not underestimate me. You wish to rule Valhalla, Trickster. Must you do it alone?"
"The attack..." She shook her head. "Supervillains are one thing. Doctor Octopus tried to steal a Vermeer from us right after I first started working for the Met, but nobody's ever come in with guns before. They killed two people. Art thieves don't operate that way. It's not something you-" she broke off, her voice catching, then took a deep breath. "My fiancé keeps trying to get me to move out of New York."
Damnit, maybe he actually had gone crazy. It wouldn't be the first time one of them had snapped under pressure.
"Right," Peter said. "I'll, um, come find you guys after I see them."
Tony let his shoulders sag, suddenly exhausted, and laid the hammer down gently on his work bench, next to the still dully glowing breastplate. "What do you think?"
Hank turned to Rhodey. "Go find Clint. Tell him he needs to get Jan to grow to at least ten feet. Tell him Goliath-sized, he'll know what I mean. She'll increase her mass exponentially, and have a fraction of the amount of the toxin in her system."
"The Wasp is apparently hysterical, and Tony isn't responding to anyone, not even Cap. It's really freaky, MJ. When I went in to see him, he told me to get out before I died, too, but I don't think he actually heard anything I said, and Cap is really scared. He's never scared!" Hank was obviously scared, too, which wasn't as frightening as Cap losing it, but still wasn't exactly reassuring. Peter couldn’t be sure, since there’d been no way he was going to ask, but from the way Cap had been watching Tony with a gaze almost as fixed and unwavering as the one Tony had on him, Peter thought he might be worried that Tony wasn't going to come out of it.
"Thanks. I think this is the first time things at work have gone right since Loki zapped me; you have no idea how much of a relief it is. Nobody said anything, but I think some of the board members were quietly floating the idea of replacing me." Tony had been more worried by the thought than he'd admitted to himself; without this deal, SI would have been out of options, no matter how hard he'd tried to put a good face on things for the board, and Tony would have lost his company once more. When he'd left the conference room, secure in the knowledge that he wasn't going to lose everything he'd fought so hard to regain after all, relief had hit him so hard that he'd actually had to run for the executive washroom to throw up.
Tony was supposed to have gotten back to New York at nine a.m. Thanks to a combination of last-minute delays, it was now eleven forty-five, and he still hadn't arrived.
They weren’t the only same-sex couple here.  They were just the one the most people were looking at.
He could live with the metal heart, as long as Tony could.
Once the drug had worn off, her reactions just seemed disproportionate and silly. She couldn't imagine herself overreacting like that, even back when she'd been a twenty-two year old socialite playing at being a superhero.
Hank went obediently, stumbling slightly. He kept staring at Jan until Sam had yanked him out of sight around the doorframe.
"I was going to say modesty," Steve said; he hadn't thought Tony had noticed his blushes, "but shame works." He shook his head, feeling his face heat again. "You're all my closest friends. There's no reason I should be uncomfortable with you knowing."
He'd thought Tony had thrown that out along with the rest of the drawings and paintings that had once decorated Stark Tower, when he'd tried to erase Steve's presence in his life during the registration fight by erasing all evidence of him from his living quarters. Why had he kept these two when all the others had been disposed of?
Carol glanced involuntarily at the shrouded body, then forced herself to look away, back to Clint. "She was already being influenced by Chthon in England. I don't think her powers naturally work that way, or she would have healed people with them a lot more often." And if Chthon's influence was necessary in order to do it, then one person's life wasn't worth the potential consequences.
"At least Sin doesn't have Barnes.  Or Sharon."  Sam touched a hand to his bruised face again. "What she did to me would be nothing compared to what she'd probably like to do to them.  Crossbones didn't die easily, or cleanly."  He grimaced.  "It wasn't right.  I should have stopped Barnes, but in the end, I wasn't sure Crossbones didn't deserve it.  Half the reason Sin's as batshit as she is is because of what he did to her."
ooOOoo
The front door of the bunker was secured by a single rusted padlock. Behind it, there would be a flight of stairs leading downward and another door, this one equipped with a fingerprint-coded lock and retinal scanners.
"You were right," Tony said quietly.
"Is it just me, or is that the only kind we get?"
Cap closed his eyes for a moment, then, "Hank doesn't know what it is yet, and the hospital doesn't know how to treat it. Two of the other victims have already died of heart attacks, and four of them are in comas. And he won't talk to me." His voice got softer, face twisting for a second. "I don't think he knows I'm here."
"Must you take everything from me?" Loki demanded, leaning forward so that she was practically hissing in his ear. He ought to have been able to feel her breath on the back of his neck, feel her heat pressed against his back. The fact that he could not was almost more disconcerting than her actual presence would have been. "You have Valhalla, you have your father's throne and all his power, and you cannot spare me this one small thing? Baldur yet lives, for you and all others in Asgard to fawn over. Must I be punished forever for his sake?"
"No! This could revolutionize the entire way we conceptualize superpowers. This is Nobel Prize material, Jan."
The flight attendant's eyebrows went up, probably in skepticism at the sound of Wanda's fluent, American-accented English, but she didn't say anything – just smiled back and moved on.
And in the meantime, people were being hurt, and the Post's editorials were encouraging it. Steve gave in to the impulse to pace — Tony wasn't looking at him anyway — and made a circuit of the lab, picking his way around a quinjet engine, partial suits of both Iron Man and War Machine armor, and a half-dozen pieces of welding and machining equipment. A purple tuft of feather that looked suspiciously like part of one of Clint's arrows was caught on the corner of Tony's drafting table; Steve pulled it free, smoothing the barbs back together.
Steve halted in the living room doorway, torn between amusement and exasperation. Tony and Rhodey were sitting side-by-side on the long leather couch, their backs to him. Several pieces of the War Machine armor were spread out on the coffee table, and Tony, who had informed Steve mere hours ago that they had to be careful not to damage Jarvis's furniture, was poking at them absently with a tiny screwdriver. A small, pen-shaped implement that Steve recognized as a pocket acetylene torch was sitting on the polished table top, next to one of Rhodey's half-disassembled jet-boots.
Steve was stretched out along the length of Tony's body now, one hand bracing himself against Tony's pillow and the other sliding up under Tony's shirt.
Wanda nodded. "She wants to summon Chthon and let him possess a human vessel. She drugged my tea so that I wouldn't be able to interfere in her ritual."
"No." Tony shook his head, something within his armor whirring faintly. He smelled like hot metal and burned plastic. "This literally shouldn't have happened. The odds of that crane hitting the building at precisely that angle, at exactly the right point to cause the most damage possible, are minuscule, and even if everything went perfectly wrong, it shouldn't have done this. The building shouldn't have been on the verge of total collapse, unless it was loaded with structural flaws to begin with, and the company that was building it has an almost perfect safety record." He held up one hand, ticking points off on the fingers of his gauntlet. "Building collapses, gas main explosions, subway accidents. Do you know how many times two subway trains have collided underground in the entire history of the New York subway?"
The alarm in Hank's voice came through loud and clear, despite the crackle of static in the connection.
"I'm fine," he said. "I... um..."
Tony shook his head, and started to pace, hands linked behind his back. It was a familiar motion, something Steve had seen him do before when planning something. "I'll need to call a press conference as soon as possible. I have to put my own spin on this before the Bugle or one of my competitors gets ahold of it." He turned on his heel, facing Steve again, and sighed, shoulders slumping slightly. "Once I've taken care of that, I'll go back to my apartment at SI and get out of your hair."
At the same moment, the last Doombot, still wildly flailing around as its processor ground to a halt, crashed through Sin's men, knocking them aside like bowling pins, and
Wanda pulled her hand, half extended to touch the cat, back again. "I always wanted a kitten when I was little," she said, a touch of defensiveness in her voice, "but we weren't allowed to have them because they're dirty."
"You could tell him yourself."
"Well then," Strange said, "let us go down and investigate your church. There very well may be something inside trying to get out." He most fervently hoped not, given that Chthon was dangerous enough anywhere, and likely to be even more dangerous in such close proximity to Baldur's Bane, especially inside a church. The barriers between dimensions were naturally thin inside sacred places, the more so the older said sacred location was. St. Margaret's had been built nearly a decade before the Civil War.
Hank made a bitterly amused snorting noise—the walls of her cell obviously didn't block or muffle sound.  "Fine, for now.  I'm not sure if Sin has a policy of not giving her prisoners food or water, or if she's just forgotten she's got us."
There was a moment of silence, while everyone struggled to keep their smiles in place for the news crews. "Like Doom," Tony said.
He tried to claw at her, to leave Sin's body and force himself into her mind, but this much foreign chaos power filling her, there was no room for him.
Steve flexed his fingers, tightening his grip on Tony's shoulder. It felt too small under his hand, delicate.
"I don't remember what I was thinking," Clint admitted, still picking at the callus. Even with gloves, archery toughened your hands up. "Hell, I don't even remember where I found her."
How pressure sensitive was it?  Some of the interfaces he'd built for previous iterations of his armor could be modified to provide more neural feedback, including sensory data.
Jan nodded. "I know. I heard you talking to Cap and Tony."
"When she reached New York, proximity to the Spear of Loki in Hell's Kitchen disrupted Chthon's control over her. She came to me, and I was able to place magical shields on her to prevent him from reasserting control." Strange stopped in front of a heavy, wooden door, pushing it open with one hand and waving them inside with the other. "I believe I will let Miss Maximoff explain the rest."
His fingers brushed the edge of Doom's dramatically flaring cape, and then Doom was across the vault's threshold, forcing Thor out of his way with another shot of that strange energy, and dissolved into a swirl of mist, leaving behind the smell of smoke and ice.
"That's the marines," Rhodey interrupted. "They are a cult. Anyway, you're one to talk, mister I-sleep-in-my-armor."
Steve was holding him so tightly that it almost hurt, repeating his name over and over. Tony let himself go limp, sagging against Steve and closing his eyes. What ever had happened, there were almost certainly things that needed to be dealt with, but they could wait; for now Tony couldn’t process anything beyond the fact that Steve was alive, was here, was all right.
Clint had visited the emergency room in St. Vincent's on a number of occasions, both as a patient and as an actual visitor, but he'd never seen it this crowded. The waiting room was jammed with people who had been on the lower floors of the building the Meridian was in, waiting to have their blood tested; since the emergency room also had its usual complement of car accident survivors, mugging victims, people with the flu, and assorted runners up for the Darwin awards, they were low on the priority list and were probably going to have to wait a while.
"Great, guys. That's level two cleared, and the system didn't throw up any red flags." Jan's voice was loud over the intercom, drowning out the faint whirr of floor plates shifting back into their normal position.
listening," Clint said, with a kind of accusatory triumph. "Loki's the one who turned Tony into a girl."
“You-“ words failed Steve for moment.  “You just scanned all the equipment in the room with the extremis, didn’t you?”
Tony took a step back, jerking himself free from Steve's hands. "That's not what I- I'm not going to force you to marry me just because we were stupid and I got... oh God, I can't even say it again. I'm not
felt better afterwards.
The dizziness and pain were fading, but he still felt shaky, and while he could put on a smile for reporters while far more seriously injured than this, the others more than had this one covered. They didn't need Tony here to pose for the cameras.
He had given up the idea of ever returning to normal, Steve knew. That was what his proposal had been about, on one level. About seizing what he could have as a woman, because there seemed to be no hope of ever becoming a man again. He had rejected Don's suggestion of corrective surgery vehemently, insisting that sexual organs that were in perfect working order were preferable to ones that wouldn't work as well even if they were the wrong kind.
"Then I was exposed." Given the situation, Tony sounded strangely calm. There was no discernible emotion in his voice, and Steve was uneasily reminded of watching him on the news after the Helicarrier had blown up, and hearing that same empty calm when he spoke.
He caught the woman around the waist, snapping his wings back out to halt their descent. She screamed even more loudly, and stabbed him in the shoulder with a fork.
She gave him a long, level look. Peter glanced around warily, making sure everyone in the vicinity was looking the other way, then held out his right hand and sent a thin strand of webbing at the corner of her clipboard.
Ms. Marvel was coming out of Tony's room. She was staring off into the distance with a worried expression, not seeming to see Peter. She'd been an Avenger for years, Peter thought. She probably knew Jan Van Dyne at least as well as Hawkeye did.
Tony grinned. He'd actually been thinking of the time Steve had thrown his shield inside the front hallway of the mansion, taking out a laundry list of antiques. "The new one is wrought iron," he said, "and I built it, so I can assure you that it's anything but spindly."
"Wanda's eyes are brown," Carol said. Which wasn't really an answer, but in a way, was.
Sharon took a step forward, sliding between the two of them with complete disregard for Steve's personal space.  "Great," she said.  "We can use him here."  She set one palm flat against Steve's chest and gave him a firm shove backwards.  "Calm down, Steve, or I'll have you thrown out of the medical bay.  Tony's not the only patient here."
He sounded legitimately hurt, though. "It's not so much that they all go wrong," Clint said reassuringly, "as it is that on the rare occasions when they do, the results always try to kill us."
He looked uncertain, almost afraid suddenly. Steve was reaching over to put a hand on his back when Tony's next words stopped him.
Steve had only Jan's shouted cry of warning when the first of Sin's serpent squad leapt up from behind the stone plinth that supported a statue of Dionysus and threw himself at Carol. Maybe the man assumed that being both female and completely empty-handed would make her the easiest to take down.
"So," Don said, after a long moment of silence, "which one of us is going to do this?"
"We are all concerned about Iron Man," Vision started.
Everyone was still too keyed up to sleep, so the end result was that they found themselves sitting in a rough circle on the floor of the Avengers Mansion's living room, playing a party game that Steve had never heard of and strongly suspected was played mostly by thirteen-year-old girls.
"You should leave," Clint forced out, moving to place his body between Hank and Jan, trying to block her view of him. Maybe if she couldn't see him anymore, she'd calm down.
"It's Tony's house," Cap said, smiling a little awkwardly, the way he always did when people thanked him for things. "He can invite whoever he wants to stay there."
Jan nodded, unsurprised. "Tell Hank I don't mind if he stays for a while. If Don and Tony need him here."
It was probably DNA-related, Clint told himself. Hank would be more careful if his workspace were covered in poisons, acid, or some kind of bioweapon. If nothing else, he'd never have something corrosive so close to a computer.
"How did she break free?" Steve asked.
"You do not think it was your power alone that brought me back?" Agatha's familiar face was suddenly sinister in the pinkish-red light of Wanda's power. Wanda stared at her in horror, feeling as if the floor had dropped out from under her feet. "I was returned to life to serve a purpose, to serve him. His will brought me back into existence."
"As you can see, Mr. DeFalco, our new geothermal energy plant emits less than 100 kilograms of CO2 per MWh of electricity." Tony gestured at the powerpoint slide behind him, where the plant's energy output and emissions levels were displayed in pretty red and green bar graphs.
"The important thing is that you came back." It was selfish of him to be happy that Wanda was back in the Avengers Mansion, all things considered, but he couldn't help it. Having the Scarlet Witch back on his team put Steve's world one step closer to where it ought to be, where it had been before everything had gone wrong.
"How about we move a little further away from it?" Sam suggested.
"Yeah," Don admitted.  "But you try arguing with him."
ooOOoo
Thor cleared his throat, looking both startled and concerned. "I cannot apologize enough for the indignities you have suffered on my account, Iron Man." He hesitated. "Or should I be offering my congratulations?"
"My armor's a titanium-steel alloy. It would still have bent."
"I will, next time I see him. Figures he'd go out of town right when I show up for a visit."
Steve's cell phone rang, then, a sudden burst of noise that made everyone in the room jump.
First her mother, then Django Maximoff, her real father, then her children, and now Steve. All her power, and yet Wanda was never able to save her family when it mattered. She had ended up hurting them more than she'd helped, failing them the same way she had failed to save Vision when he had been taken and disassembled.
A chunk of plaster hit her in the face, dust and grit stinging in her eyes, and there was nothing but empty air beneath her feet.  Wanda started to struggle, kicking backwards at her captor's legs and turning her head to bite at the arm around her chest.  She remembered just in time that biting a Doombot was a bad idea, and unleashed a raw burst of chaos energy at it instead.
Loki was not a representative of the US government, or anyone else they had any reason to respect, and had in point of fact tried to kill them all more than once. Trusting Wanda and letting her back onto the team – probationary Carol's ass, she was pretty much on the team again – was bad enough without accepting help from the overtly, self-admittedly evil.
"Mr. Stark doesn't wish to be disturbed-" Jarvis was saying.
"Okay, that--" she broke off, eyes widening. "You what?"
"That was-"
Don was about to refuse and stay put when he saw the briefcase clutched in Tony's left hand. He and the Falcon both backed off as far as the confines of the elevator car would let them, while Tony's armor flew around him in a dangerous-looking whirlwind of red and gold metal. When the elevator doors opened on the lobby, moments later, Tony was completely armored up, and Don was the only one left who wasn't in costume.
He didn't specify what "it" was, and Steve suddenly didn't want to know. The last time he'd heard that tone of voice was in a hotel room six years ago.
Personally, Tony thought the entire thing was an exercise in futility. If trade embargos were as astoundingly effective against Latveria as they'd been against Cuba over the past fifty years, then maybe some time around 2060, Doom might finally learn his lesson and repent. Tony doubted it, though.
There was a loud thud behind him, then the unmistakable sound of Thor's massive, booted feet hitting the pavement. "Why do we wait?" he demanded. "Your message said it was most urgent." Then, to Tony, "This device does not function on the subway. Methinks you should remedy that."
Wanda was still frozen at the top of the steps, staring down at them all, her face still and tense. She reached up with one hand and touched the hood of her cloak, as if to adjust it, then let her hand drop.
"Don't-" Steve shouted, uselessly, too late, as Sam folded to the ground with both hands pressed against the sides of his head and Redwing flew to Wanda and dropped the spear directly into her outstretched hands.
"You were very manly, too. Almost as manly as Hank."
Tony made the soft sighing sound that he only made when he was starting to fall asleep. "I do too, you know," he mumbled.
"Oh, damn," Sam breathed. Redwing landed on his shoulder, huddling into Sam's neck.
"You're a girl," Morgan stammered. "I thought that was some kind of hoax."
Chthon's energy vanished, burned away, but the power kept pouring out of her, draining away into the dimensional walls until there was nothing left. Until the walls of Chthon's prison were solid again.
Tony dropped obediently back into the chair, then looked irritated with himself.
Maybe Jessica had been right to want to call a halt to things before it stopped being fun. They had worked just fine as friends who occasionally hooked up before the SHRA had passed. And friends who were willing to forgive you some of the things Carol had pulled when she'd been drinking, and put up with the dysfunctional mess she'd been after she'd come out of the coma were harder to come by than gorgeous women with sex pheromone powers who were great in bed.
Steve nodded at the door. "Is there anything you can do?"
Sharon smiled at him, taking away the sting of that unconscious flinch. "We know you will."
Tony narrowed his eyes. "You said you'd sealed the spear away."
Clint stared down at her and felt deeply useless. Yesterday, things had been on their way back to normal, if you ignored the fact that he was supposed to be dead and that Cap had been sulking over Tony not being there to a degree that surpassed even his previous sulking fits, and now Jan and Tony were hurt, and Cap, who was supposed to be the one who held things together in these kinds of situations, was visibly upset, and Wanda had maybe done something to Clint's mind.
It wouldn't have gotten them past the retinal scan, though. That was what explosives were for.
Stepping back from Tony was the last thing he wanted to do, but he made himself do it, trying to will his hardening erection away.
"I don't know.  He tried to summon her to Asgard with the ring she gave me.  We should have known it was a trap."  He drew his bad leg — his good leg, now — up and bent forward to lean his forehead against his knee.  It helped the dizziness a little.
Tony sighed, and handed over the watch.
Steve arched his body backwards and watched Tony's fist go sailing over his head. Tony had put his entire weight into the punch, which meant that he was already off balance when Steve straightened up, sidestepped Tony's attempt to rush him, and pivoted on one foot, launching a kick at Tony's head. Tony managed to block the blow with one arm, but just barely.
There was a long moment of silence. Jan smiled tentatively, Clint looked at the floor, and Carol glowered at Wanda and everyone else, pointedly silent. Tony stood there feeling awkward, watching Steve and Wanda try to smile at one another, and struggled to think of something to say.
Tony smirked. "Steve, you still do that."
"Yes," Jan said, resisting the impulse to roll her eyes. "You went to DC."
He could feel the tightness and pressure in his temples and behind his eyes that signaled the beginnings of a headache, despite the fact that he'd barely used a fraction of Extremis's capabilities. It wasn't painful enough yet to indicate a real problem, though, or to hinder him in any meaningful way, so he connected to Fury's private line, the one he wasn't supposed to have the number to, and waited.
Clint giggled. There was no other word for it. "Oooh, Captain America said the word 'breasts.' Without blushing! Keep that up and you might even be able to find another girlfriend some time soon."
"This is extremely bad news." Strange shook his head, glaring at Tony's abdomen as if it had personally offended him. "Apparently your body is becoming more fully female as time passes. It is a complication I had not predicted. And of course changing you back now is out of the question without medical intervention. Otherwise the process would most likely kill you."
She blinked suddenly hot eyes as Strange nodded – "Yes, really not dead," – and drew in a long, shaky breath. Steve was alive. Clint was alive. Simon and Tony were alive. She still had family left, despite Chthon's best efforts.
He'd always tried to use charm to turn business negotiations to his advantage, even in the very early days when he'd still been figuring out how to do it successfully - eye contact was key, but it had taken a while before he stopped having to remind himself of that - but somehow, it had felt slightly uncomfortable this time, in a way it never had before.
Steve leaned forward, peering at the magazine over Tony's shoulder.
"What press release?" Tony reached for the magazine, fumbling it momentarily as Jan thrust it at him. "I've been dodging reporters all day. I haven't given an interview to anyone since Thor came back, and I haven't given a private interview since that bastard at the Meridian who thought we'd faked Steve's... him."
Sam nodded. "Yeah, that would do it, I imagine." He still looked skeptical, eyeing Thor uneasily. The idea that anyone would kidnap and rape a sibling - blood relative or not - as part of a political plot was obviously new to him and probably not something he thought Thor should be taking this lightly.
Tony rubbed one hand over his face, smearing the engine grease even further. "We need to have Wanda take a look at that book; we can't afford to wait until Strange gets back from wherever he's run off to. Doom wouldn't waste his time on it if it weren't useful to him."
Steve wasn’t sure if they were long overdue for some good luck in general, or if they’d already had more than their fair share.
It probably sounded like one of those jokes about Batman and Robin that Steve had always thought were in poor taste. He'd basically slept with his sidekick; as much as he'd tried to help Jack regain a sense of confidence in himself, they had never quite been on an equal footing. "It was only a couple of times," he finished lamely.
"Wasn't this before you told her you were Iron Man?" Wanda asked. "Because if so, I'm with Cap."
Tony had had two tickets to it, one for himself and one for an unspecified and to-be-selected date, for the past two months. He hadn't given the matter of whom he'd be going with much thought; there were always women eager for the chance to accompany Tony Stark out for a night on the town. Some of them were even women whose company he actually enjoyed.
Steve's voice was soft, gentle, completely free of judgment.
"One chromosome different, according to Hank Pym, which is enough to convince the Avengers that I'm Tony Stark, but isn't going to fly with the business world. They won't see anything beyond the fact that it's not an exact match." He held up one hand and wriggled his fingers. "My fingerprints are the same, though. And I still have all the same scars and other identifying marks."
"You don't have to watch," Tony said, voice quiet.
Too many distractions, he decided. First Wanda's return, then that damn magazine article, not to mention the onslaught of disasters and petty supervillain attacks that had run them all ragged for weeks. Was Chthon doing it on purpose? Did he have that much influence yet, or was it just a side effect of how thin the barrier between dimensions had become inside St. Margaret's, the bad luck that followed Chthon seeping out and working in Doom's favor?
It was a fair trade. If he'd known what was going to happen four months ago, he'd still have gone into the fight with the Mandarin willingly. Except... when he'd been prepared to lose the Extremis forever, after that fight, he'd expected a future where he wouldn't be
"You need to come upstairs! Nobody's going to believe this!" Though, given that he and Steve had already come back from the dead... "Or maybe they will."
Thor drew his arm back, his hammer revolving more swiftly, then hesitated and turned to Tony.  "Which of them is the true Victor von Doom?"
"Our relationship is not a 'story.'"
None of the people in Oklahoma knew about Don Blake's connection with Thor, and none of the other Asgardians had ever really understood Thor's attachment to humans, even now, after spending time among them.
"We should have upgraded the engines on this thing two months ago, when Tony wanted to," he muttered.
The New York Botanical Gardens’ annual gala was usually held in the spring or summer – the fact that Steve even knew this was probably a sign that he’d paid far too much attention to Tony’s social life even before they’d gotten together – but this spring, New York had been attacked by Doombots and the Mandarin, and the upheaveal caused by the fighting over registration had still lingered.  Hence holding the 2007 gala in December.
“It’s over,” Steve told him.  “Hold on.  Help is coming.”
"I think you should go as a woman," she said.
Carol sighed. "I know coming back to life like that is confusing-"
"I'll get you one," Peter offered.  "Mineral water or water, water?"
"Huh," he said. "I never realized how much more sensitive women's breast are. Or, well, I knew, but I never really thought about what it would be like."
"According to reliable sources." Tony had been drinking heavily enough by that point that he didn't remember much, beyond the fact that he'd thought Henry's initial greeting – "Hi, I'm Henry Hellrung, and I'm going to be playing you on television," – had been a clever joke.
Barnes leaned back in his chair, shoving the map away from him in disgust.  "Three quarters of a century, and I'm still doing Nick Fury's grunt work.  I'm more skilled and experienced than any agent on board this ship except Natasha — who I helped
." He took Tony's right hand in both of his, smiling a familiar, smarmy smile. "Would your date mind if I borrowed you for the next dance?"
Who was she really? What had she done?
"Tony," Steve said, almost in his ear. "I know you can hear me. Put the tools down and talk to me, please?"
"That would be an excellent idea. How much water do you pump through them in a day?"
"And here." Strange's hand moved lower, hovering in front of Tony's stomach, and then his eyes widened, and he pulled his hand back abruptly. "Light of Oshtur! That's- that's not possible. Dr. Pym's data was very specific."
"It's my fault," Tony said. "I should have answered her phone calls. If you don't give a reporter the story you want them to run, they'll find another one. And she's probably been dying to run a story on me since I threw her out of my office. And then she called me to ask for an interview after the SHRA was repealed, and I hung up on her."
After assassinating a foreign dignitary, Tony reflected, it wasn't surprising that SHIELD was on thin political ice, and charging into a foreign embassy and arresting everything that moved would spark off an international incident that would extend far beyond the already tense US-Latverian relations.
Wanda raised her eyebrows. "Considering the results we got the last time you tried to synch my powers with a computer system, I think it might be better to leave it alone."
He'd expected them - Steve especially - to be annoyed at the very least, especially given how utterly he'd failed to fulfill his responsibilities to the team last year, but in retrospect, he realized, it had been a silly fear. The drinking, losing the company, having to hand the armor off to Rhodey, had all been his fault. His current transformation wasn't. And if they'd been willing to take him back after the months he'd spent as an unreliable alcoholic mess, then the team wasn't going to withdraw their support because he'd come out the loser in a fight with Loki.
"So you're, ah, Mrs. Spiderman?" the nurse raised her eyebrows skeptically.
Chthon was gone.  The city hadn’t been destroyed.  No one had died.
his countless military honors was enough to make Tony's worries about whatever Jan was going to make him wear bearable. "He's going to have to wear the full sized version."
"I can't believe you're actually meeting with a publicist," Clint snorted, as they reached the exit into the main concourse, where there were three times as many people as there had been in baggage claim. "You've been in LA too long."
The two men were the last to succumb, their greater body mass buying them an extra half-second of cognizance – the older one, a white man with thinning hair and one of those omnipresent paint-splatter sweatshirts all the tourist shops sold, screamed hysterically as black goo crawled up his torso, the sound raw and grating.
Peter glanced back over his shoulder to see Cap and  Tony coming back to the table.  Cap had one hand on the small of Tony's  back, and was wearing a big, goofy grin.  Tony was looking over at him  with the same sort of through-the-eyelashes look that Felicia Hardy  always gave Spiderman, except he managed to do it without the creepy  semi-stalker vibes.
ooOOoo
Arlington. Jack Monroe was buried there, and Toro, and all the Howling Commandos save for Nick, Dugan, and Gabe Jones. Bucky had a headstone there, that still hadn't been taken down.
The spear was glowing again, red and white light pulsing like a heartbeat.   Just looking at it made his eyes hurt and his stomach lurch, and Tony still hadn't moved, and Clint was still down, struggling to sit up, and-
"Take us back to the Avengers Mansion," Tony said.  "I need my armor."
"You don't have to marry me," he mumbled into Steve's costume. The edges of his goggles cut into his forehead, and the leaf-shaped pieces of Steve's scale mail were sharp aginst his face. "I'm only going to be pregnant for another couple of weeks, so you don't have to make an honest woman of me. It would take more than a debatably legal wedding to do that anyway."
"No, I took Indres. I gave Pepper and Happy extra tickets." Pepper was significantly more than just a secretary - that wasn't even her official job title, and hadn't been for years - and she needed to be present at events like this every bit as much as Tony did. She was the one who filled in for Tony any time he couldn't be present for something, the one who scheduled pretty much everything around him, the one who knew where the bodies were buried and where the records were filed and who the right person to call to deal with the latest crisis was. Or at least, she had been.
Presumably, he flew back to the Avengers Mansion under his own power, because when he landed, he didn't have to disengage the armor's autopilot function. He wasn't entirely sure how; he found himself sitting in his lab seventeen minutes after leaving Stark Tower with no real memory of how he'd gotten there, still wearing his armor and with a dull, sickening throbbing in his temples.
“Which of us is leading?”
They were just beginning to rebuild their friendship. Steve really hoped sex wouldn't get in the way of that; as good as the sex had been - and it had been very good - he wouldn't trade Tony's friendship for it.
Tony opened his eyes, rolling his head to the side slightly. "Do what?"
"You mean the spear?" Damn it, he was not actually having a conversation with Loki. With new, disconcertingly attractive Loki and her vulpine smile and bottle-glass-green eyes that were the only part of Thor's stepbrother face that he could still recognize in her. "You've been content to ignore it for the past several thousand years. Why do you care what happens to it?"
Tony nodded. "Probably. Or they arranged for it to happen." Steve smelled like lemons, the earlier scents of spaghetti sauce and blood erased by dish soap. Cleaning products, he suspected, shouldn't smell so enticing.
"Cap?  Hawkeye?  I could use some help here."
Steve jerked upright, his hand going for his shield even as he recognized Carol’s voice.  Despite the number of fights and crises he’d been through in the past 48 hours, his body still had enough adrenaline left to set his heart racing.   “Carol.  Don’t sneak up on me.”
"I don't know," Tony admitted.
She had dissolved into smoke then. Even Strange wasn't sure whether she had died, unable to use Chthon's power to sustain her life and physical form any longer, or simply escaped to another dimension.
At least nothing valuable had been broken, unless a ten-foot radius of pavement counted, and a single manuscript was insignificant compared to the kind of damage the likes of the Wrecking Crew
He was staring at Steve, too, but rather than looking curious or shocked, he just looked kind of dazed.
"Sorry," he said. "Thank you, both of you. I know you're trying."
The days when he had fallen for Loki's tricks were long past. "And what would you do with it then, brother?" Thor asked. "Whom would you slay? Which of the Aesir would you make a feast for the eagles? Where else on Midgard would you sow chaos and destruction?"
"You know that's not my name, Victor. Not my real one, anyway." She removed the tip of the dagger from his mask and slid the weapon back into the scabbard at her thigh, probably intending the action to be erotic.
Granted, an apology or two more to Thor might go a long way towards smoothing things over, but...
When Tony and Wanda left, a few moments later, he had already donned safety gear and was muttering to himself as he sorted through the collection of minute containers of assorted chemicals.
And below that, in small, discreet letters, the byline.
"That's arguably libel, you know." She-Hulk shrugged, tossing her hair back over one shoulder. "I could sue them for you, if you want, but it's not really worth the effort. You would probably lose, anyway. The last three lawsuits I was hired to bring against the Daily Bugle did." She grinned. "Just be glad it's not a porn site dedicated to you."
"War Machine?" Steve snapped into his commlink. "We need a way in. Avoid the center of the doors; there's some kind of armed lock."
After two months, watching the rest of the team fight via CNN and his Avengers communicator still hadn't gotten any easier. It hadn't been this hard when he'd been on the West Coast Avengers – he'd enjoyed having the extra time to devote to experiments, enjoyed playing support staff and scientific consultant for a while. He ought to be enjoying it now.
"This isn't about principles," he said shortly, blue eyes boring into Tony. "This is about not relying on people you know you can't trust."
"I feel like a fish out of water in suits." At least, he did in suits as nice as this one. Though Tony was probably imagining him
The staff at Bellevue had been kind enough to lend him clean surgical scrubs, to replace the torn and bloodstained clothes he’d still been wearing when he turned back into himself.  The sleeves were too short, but it was significantly better than being covered in his own blood, as well as whatever grime he’d picked up from the warehouse floor.
"You know how it took me a while to turn up again after I came back from the dead?" Clint started. He was picking at a loose thread on the knee of his jeans, slowly turning a small hole in the fabric into a larger one.
“Mmm,” Tony mumbled.  “Good.”  His eyelids were starting to droop, and his voice had gone distant, as if he were half-asleep.  “C’mere.”  He tugged slightly on Steve’s hand, still in his, and Steve obediently bent down.
"Can we go back to bed?" Steve asked, not at all plaintively. "It's three am." Actually, it was probably closer to one, but he was tired. Also, Tony was about two minutes away from putting his head on Steve's shoulder and falling asleep standing up.
Was Chthon's hand at work there, or was she reading too much into things?
Maybe he had torn or ruptured something inside himself yesterday. Maybe he'd been bleeding internally for the past twenty-four hours, in small enough amounts that the effects were only now catching up to him. It had happened before.
Tony flashed him a brilliant smile. "Actually, I think many women would be able to attest that I'm bisexual. And... Since I was in college, since the Helicarrier blew up, and because the media was still having so much fun with all the other ways I've publicly exposed myself to them that it would have been a shame to distract them."
The BMW wasn't as sexy as a Ferrari, but it still accelerated like a race-car. Carol insisted on driving, which Clint didn't blame her for; anyone would jump at the chance to drive a bright red European convertible, even in New York traffic.
Except, Tony hadn't given him new access codes. He'd been too much of an idiot to ask, and Tony couldn't have simply reloaded the old ones; he would have needed a fresh voiceprint from Steve. "He never changed the access code."
Very dryly, Steve said, "If I ordered you to, you'd ignore me." He was probably going to ignore his own stated plan to use the Extremis only to run the armor, too. The first time being able to access a computer or security camera or satellite transmission in his head was faster and more convenient than doing it the old fashioned way, Tony would tough it out and do things manually. The tenth time, or the first time they needed information or access to a building's security network immediately in the middle of a fight with something, all good intentions would be forgotten.
Steve half turned toward Sam, bringing his shield up to throw, though he knew his chances of actually being able to stop a gunshot with it this way were next to zero. Sam was already poised to duck — there was a bronze statue only a few feet to his right, and one dive and roll would put him behind it.
Jan shook her head. "I don't know. Maybe he pulled the information from her mind."
Don was halfway through the door before he realized that Hank already had company; Jan, shrunken down to Barbie-doll size in order to fit easily on the edge of the hospital bed, was sitting by Hank’s head, petting his hair with one hand.
"The Inhumans won't talk to us, the X-Men won't talk to you, Thor hates us..." Hank ticked the points off on his fingers with the end of the miniature screwdriver. "I suppose it could be worse. At least we don't have to run off and start our own team this time."
Sharon drew herself up slightly, looking as if she were about to object, and then nodded. She straightened her SHIELD-issue jacket and turned back to Tony. "You're right; you shouldn't have brought it up, but I'll forget you said it if you will." She drew in a deep breath, let it out slowly, and added, "Go sit down somewhere and talk to the doctors; you look like hell. Let the professionals take care of things here."
He remembered far too much of that.
Peter scuffed the toe of one shoe on the floor, trying to avoid looking at Tony; something about the way he was just lying there was just creepy. "The guy at the reception desk said it wasn't lethal. So he and the Wasp should be okay, right?"
This wasn't right. Why couldn't she
Steve put his book aside and looked up, about to ask Jan how the evening had gone - he wouldn't admit it to many people, but he actually enjoyed Jan's descriptions of what everyone had been wearing - and froze.
Steve winced. He'd been dealing just fine with the prospect of Tony getting an abortion, but something about hearing him say it so bluntly, especially while he sat there looking so wan and tired... Maybe it was better this way, though. Losing the baby on his own was more natural, and probably less likely to result in horrible complications.
Tony's shirt had to come off in order to attach the leads for the EKG machine. Unlike the last time Hank had seen him shirtless, he was wearing a sports bra beneath his white button-down. Hank, remembering the sight of Tony's naked breasts - and the way Tony had tried to kiss him when he'd been stupid enough to paw at them - was profoundly grateful.
"I thought I said no lights," he snapped. "If it's an emergency, make it someone else's problem, and if it's not an emergency, why are you-" his eyes finally focused on Thor, and he broke off abruptly. "Oh. It's you. What do you want?"
could distinguish an LMD from the real thing if he had the right equipment and a few moments to study it, but he was the one who'd designed and built them — but still, it galled.  Doom wasn't supposed to be better than him.
Steve folded his jeans in half and laid them over the back of the chair, on top of the shirt, then sat down on his own side of the bed, stretching his arms over his head; his shoulders ached from wearing his shield for too long, and that half-hour of sleep he'd snatched in Tony's hospital room last night hadn't been nearly enough.
"We have a press conference in three hours," Wanda objected.
It was a little girl, no more than three or four. She was standing in the middle of the floor sobbing, people rushing past her obliviously. "Mommy! Mommy!"
Don turned back for a moment, looking at Clint over his shoulder. "You never saw me."
Pulling his hand back and shifting his weight off of Tony's chest wasn't something Steve consciously planned on doing; it just sort of happened. Then Tony was lunging up at him, and Steve had a split second to wonder what on earth kind of wrestling move this was before Tony was kissing him, fingers digging into his shoulders.
Clint shook his head. "It'll teach me not to lurk in hallways. I know what you mean about restaurants closing," he added. "That pizza place by the Met went out of business while I was dead."
"I'll ask it, then. I'm pretty sure I'm stuck like this for the foreseeable future. I may still be legally male, but SI has lawyers who could probably take my DNA test results and use them to make the state attorney's office cry. Will you marry me?"
Steve closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them again and reached down to brush a piece of damp hair away from Tony's face.
Doing what had to be done didn't always mean doing what was right, and it never got any easier, except when he'd been too drunk to care.
She was a head shorter than him, weighed barely a hundred and thirty pounds, and had been tortured into insanity by Crossbones and her deranged monster of a father. Smashing his shield into her face and
"That possibility has been considered," Tony said carefully. There was no tactful or friendly way to tell her that SHIELD had had plans to kill her if she re-surfaced and was judged to still be a global threat, or that the Illuminati had discussed meting out to Wanda the same treatment they had to the Hulk – eliminating the threat she represented by sending her off planet or to another dimension, as far away as they could, and, if that was not possible, killing her.
yet, and probably never would.
He was the only Democrat Tony knew who was all for military intervention. It was the torture of prisoners, the restriction of civil liberties, and the waging of war under false pretenses that he had objected to when he'd temporarily taken off his costume last summer, not the actual fact of the war itself.
"Clint," he said, "are you looking for Steve?" He realized that he'd been unconsciously rubbing at his temples with his left hand, and halted the gesture immediately, letting his hands fall back to his lap. Apparently, he'd developed a reflexive habit, despite the fact that it didn't hurt anymore.
Loki's smirk became a true smile, the same wide, gleefully malicious one she'd always worn in her old form.  "My stepbrother is awaiting my consort's pleasure.  He will be dealt with later."
"I, um, sure," Hank said, snatching up the deep green pillow and carrying it over to her. He held it out toward her like an offering.
A lot of things that had seemed necessary at the time didn't seem quite so self-evidently vital and justifiable when he imagined trying to explain them to Steve. Cloning Thor was just the tip of the iceberg.
"Peter," Tony said matter-of-factly, "go away and leave me here with the ghosts before you end up as one of them."
"Which means you'd keep it." As if there were really any question about that. Tony stared down at the pieces of his armor, the dent still visibly scarring the side of his breastplate. If he looked at Steve, he knew, he would see the disappointment in his eyes - maybe he could keep it out of his voice, but his face had always been painfully easy to read.
"I don't think either of us has actually asked anything," Steve pointed out. He probably ought to go down on one knee, he thought. That was the way people always did it in books and movies.
"Thank you," Cap told Tony.
It didn't work that way for most people, though. It was important for most people that their partner have the right equipment, whether it be the male or the female kind.
"Good." Steve said flatly. "You can give him the anti-venom now, and then he'll be fine."
, but that would have been petty, and wouldn't accomplish anything.
Steve nodded. "I'll make sure he
"Isn't he your brother?" Sam sounded openly horrified. He had never been on a team with Thor, Hercules, or any of the Avengers' other divine or semi-divine members before; the particularly nasty nature of Asgardian politics was clearly a revelation to him.
The Avengers were not going to contact Loki, or accept her help, and under no circumstances would she be getting her spear back. However, if she contacted them, they were all going to play nice, Thor included, and do their best not to give her a reason to fight them. Tony was right about that much, at least; they couldn't afford to fight a battle on two fronts right now, not when everything they had still might not be enough to face Chthon.
"Fine." Dr. Brackett waved a hand toward the room he'd just exited. "I hate New York," he muttered. "I don't suppose there's any way to turn this Extremis thing off?"
The flash of hurt he felt was ridiculous — Steve was just being over-protective and stubborn and unreasonable and... he still managed to have a point.  He was a liability at the moment, had been steadily more and more of one recently as his ability to use the Extremis decreased.
The touch on his hair stopped just as Steve woke up enough to remember where he was and why.
"I wish Scott Lang were still around. He would have been great at this." It wasn't just that Scott had been a father himself; he'd been legitimately good with children, and had had an enviable ability to put complex concepts into simple terms without sounding as if he was talking down to people. Hank himself had never quite mastered that. "You could try calling Ben Grimm for advice," he suggested. "He's got experience with kids. I'd suggest the X-Men, but most of them won't touch the Initiative with a ten foot pole." He'd had to promise to run a battery of DNA tests on active and deactivated X-genes in order to get Hank McCoy to bring in an empath and set up extra training for Trauma, when the trainee's fear-projection powers had gotten out of control. "Scott Summers might be willing to give you a lesson plan, but that's about the best you'll get."
She had to act now, find a way to stop him, to break free. Now, before he erased her again.
Hill stared at him, her face expressionless. "That's fascinating, Tony. Is any of it actually significant?"
"If I have to be back-up, I need to at least be well-informed back-up, or I'm no use to you guys at all." Hank looked away, arms folded across his chest. Pointing out that Hank himself had been the one who'd put the 'support and back-up only' conditions on his return to the Avengers roster would have been needlessly cruel, especially since doing so had been one of the first pieces of responsible self-restraint Hank had shown in a while.
"That wasn't your fault." She had brought him back from the dead, and she wasn't crazy anymore, and seeing Wanda be Wanda again and knowing that it
"And in English, that would mean..."
make things all right for Tony just by being there. The memory of how utterly useless and powerless he'd been when Tony had been drinking was still painfully raw proof of how much of a fantasy that was. He could still taste the despair of that last meeting in the hotel room, when he'd tried to help and Tony had sent him away. Tony had refused all help, then. Refused it over the matter of getting his armor back, too.
"The spell was intended for myself," Thor went on, sounding more apologetic than Hank had ever heard him, and that included the time the Enchantress had brainwashed him into attacking them all. "I am deeply grieved to have-"
Judging by the tightening of Englehart's lips, and the way he was shaking his head, Tony was already doing that. It didn't appear to be working.
Hank's head snapped around, and Sin yanked him forward and threw him over her hip and directly into the wall.
Her boots were loud against the bare marble floor, and louder still on the living room's wooden floorboards.
since before the war; he'd forgotten how much he disliked it. He'd seen the movie with Humphrey Bogart numerous times over the years, and the memory of Bogart's performance had overshadowed the book until he'd forgotten just how much of a heartless bastard Sam Spade was.
"You speak English?" she asked, her own English crisp and British-flavored and free of any hint of German accent. "Why didn't you speak it before? I told you I didn't speak Rumanian."
He swung around, cape fluttering, and caught Steve's fist in one heavy gauntlet.
"He shouldn't have had to," Carol said, frowning. "We should have helped her.
it, not really. I don't even know what you call that kind of wrong."
"Look, I'm desperate here. I spend half the day reminding Gauntlet that he's not allowed to call seventeen-year-olds pussies, and that Vance is going to telekinetically throw him through a wall if he calls the New Warriors baby-killers one more time, and the other half explaining to everyone who will listen why one horrific training accident shouldn't be allowed to shut down the program."
"I'm so sorry," Tony said, the words muffled by his hands. "I don't mean to hurt you, but I keep doing it anyway."
It never did any good to romanticize the past. It usually wasn't that different from the present, and in some ways, it had been worse.
"I'd be offended if you asked anyone else. I thought Tony said it was just going to a legal thing in a courtroom, though. Have you talked to him about this?"
St. Margaret's Cathedral was directly below them now, looking as benign as any of the hundreds of churches in the city. The tree planted in its small scrap of churchyard was already a winter-bare skeleton, giving Jan a clear view of the side of the building.
He  came up behind Tony, the ambient noise of the room masking his  footsteps, and slid an arm around Tony's waist.  Tony turned and looked  at him, a faint look of surprise on his face.
Because he'd only been monitoring the security systems, not the museum's guests or scheduled events, because he'd been trying to limit what he did with the Extremis. Damn it.
Steve grinned. "I have, actually. I went undercover as a women a couple of times during the war."
"Wong called us." Jan nodded to where Wong was standing by Strange, exchanging significant glances with the Night Nurse while she wrote something down on the clipboard that Wanda assumed contained Strange's medical information. She wondered what kind of entry one would make on a medical chart for "metaphysically attacked by an elder god."
Tony hadn't sacrificed his integrity, his reputation, half his friendships, and far too many people's lives to have anti-superhuman sentiment break out all over again. Not when they'd finally managed to turn the tide of public opinion and get Registration repealed.
This was actually the second time it had been rebuilt – the architects and construction company had done a very good job. How much, Carol wondered, had Tony had to bribe the Landmarks Preservation Commission in order to build an exact copy of the original building instead of some modern 'update' of it?
Sam was beating at the symbiote with his wings and free hand both, yanking violently on the tongue still wrapped around his wriSt. Steve punched it in the kidneys, a hard jab that Tony could tell he pulled only slightly, and it howled, but kept its hands firmly locked around Sam's throat.
"I know that, I just... I didn't realize, when you first told me, how dangerous this could be. Not until Wanda explained just now. Whatever you do, the risk-"
Sitting around kicking himself and moping wasn't going to accomplish anything, Steve decided. He might as well go find something productive to do and kick himself and mope while doing it.
power!"
Hank, on the other hand, was closer and not three inches high, and Don could clearly see him frowning.  "Doom can't actually devour Thor's soul, though, can he?" he asked, and Don wasn't sure whether he sounded concerned or morbidly fascinated.
call him in for help in a fight, and while Tony had repeatedly stated that he was prepared to find a different place to stay if Steve didn't want him in the Mansion, the Avengers Mansion was Tony's
Tony wrapped himself around Steve in a modified version of a submission hold - had his left arm been a few inches higher, he would have had Steve in a choke hold - and pressed open-mouthed kisses against the junction of his neck and shoulder, sucking just hard enough to make Steve writhe, but not hard enough that it would leave a mark.
Whatever Doom had done to change that hadn't been his fault.  Tony had been right about that, for all that he'd expressed it by mis-quoting C.S. Lewis.  Steve had had no part in it.
Sam had been remarkably good-natured about it when Steve had dragged him into the den to watch movies with him.
"What sex pollen?" said Clint, loudly enough that Steve winced and pulled the phone an inch or so further away from his ear. "Are you even listening to me?"
Rhodey blinked, looking appropriately creeped out. "I thought he was in some kind of coma."
"It's like a trainwreck," Tony said, after what might have been a small, embarrassed pause. "I can't look away."
"Says the man with wings," Clint muttered.
Steve managed to turn sideways and take the punch intended for his face on his right shoulder, which spared him the moment of dizziness a blow to the head might have cost him, but only further cemented his arm's temporary uselessness.
"Satisfactory to everyone? You must be aware that there were a number of people who were very unhappy to see the Registration Act come to such an abrupt end."
At least the other Avengers didn't and wouldn't blame him for being turned into a woma, despite the headaches reshuffling team membership so that he and Wanda could stay on the East Coast and concealing Iron Man's temporary transformation into "Iron Woman" was going to cause them. And they'd mostly stopped snickering.
