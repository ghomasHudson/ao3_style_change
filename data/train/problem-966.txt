To survive this mess by (B)ing
“Fine then I will just go!” He growled a bit.
“There. Now we are even.” He smiled up at John and then rolled over to cuddle with him. “Just don’t do it again...” He whispered, so quietly he didn’t know if John even heard him, but he must have because he felt John brush his hair out of his face and nod slowly.
He walked all the way home and went to Mycroft, “Mycroft...” He whispered quietly, knocking on the door to his study before letting himself in.
DEUCES!
He swallowed and looked up in the direction towards Sherlock. He watched as Sherlock grabbed his phone and read the message, what he saw next made his heart shatter once again. He saw Sherlock roll his eyes and shove his phone back into his pocket, completely ignoring John.
you to tell people earlier, but you weren’t ready and I accepted that.” He said softly and used his free hand to run his fingers through John's hair.
The cab stopped in front of their flat and Sherlock paid, climbing out of the car. They walked up the seventeen steps to their flat and Sherlock took a breath, he wanted to ask if he could come to bed with John – just bed. But it wasn’t his place to ask, John needed to do this on his own time and he didn’t want to push him. It didn’t seem to matter though, John smiled and just tugged him into the room. He stripped him down and moved him to the bed, climbing in next to him and curling up around him. Sherlock's hand snuck up and grabbed on to John’s necklace and John did the exact same thing with Sherlock's dog tags.
JoKe Of ThE cHaPtEr:
Sherlock’s breathing was erratic, him and John had only done this once… He was practically a virgin! Of course he wasn’t, but the chances of Lestrade preparing him were next to nothing. Sherlock started calculating everything in his head and it really wasn’t helping. He closed his eyes as Lestrade started on the buttons of his trousers. He was on the verge of tears, but he wasn’t going to let this disgusting man see him cry.
John giggled and felt most of the anger dissolve from him. “Well, I will be sure to not let Cakeman anywhere near my cake.”
It was late, but John managed to find a flower shop that wasn’t closed yet. He had promised Sherlock so long ago that he would fix the garden and he never did… Then once Sherlock died he felt like it was pointless to do so. He was angry with Sherlock for committing suicide and he didn’t want to do him any sort of favours, but now that Sherlock was back it just felt like the right thing to do. Plus, it gave him something to do, rather than mope in his room and think things over. At least this would be a task that he could do to keep his mind occupied.
John just stayed staring at his drink and didn’t say anything. In a way he did want to talk about it, but at the same time he didn’t want to sound like the needy pub goer that poured his feelings out to anyone that would listen. Perhaps he needed a therapist or something.
John was silent as he walked into the familiar place. He took a deep breath and then looked at her, “Do you still have it..?” He asked quietly.
John screamed and shot his hand, sending the phone scattering across the room. Mycroft screamed out in pain, “ANSWER THE QUESTION!” John screamed and his chest heaved.
Sherlock smiled back and leaned forward to kiss him, “Now, where would you like to go to buy clothes?”
“Please… Hold me, please.” He whispered, it wasn’t like him to repeat himself, but he didn’t think John would notice. He was too focused on the adrenaline and the events of the last ten minutes.
“If I was lying I don’t think I would be standing here in front of you, do you?” He said a bit exasperated.
It was around two in the morning, John was sat on the lumpy motel mattress, watching re-runs of
I JUST SPENT SIX HOURS EDITING THREE CHAPTERS SO THATS MY LIFE! I'M GOING TO SLEEP NOW, NIGHT LOVES
John woke up slowly and groaned. It was still dark outside and Sherlock was waking him up when all he wanted to do was sleep. He didn't understand... "Whyyy?" He pouted.
“No, I knew I was going to die... You’re in love with him...”
Claire was sitting there staring at him, but she wasn't angry... He could tell she was incredibly sad and perhaps a bit joyful? He wasn't Sherlock. He couldn't deduce things like he could, but he did learn a few things. "Hey..." Claire whispered softly.
John smiled and slowly put them over Sherlock's head and around his neck, “Yeah. They look good on you. Plus, it’s clear to me how much you love them. I want to give you something of mine and it’s the perfect option.” He said softly and rolled off of him so that he could lay next to him, he was a bit peeved by the sticky mess on his tummy, but he couldn’t be bothered to get up so he would just deal with it.
Mike nodded slowly and opened his mouth to say something, but thought better of it and didn’t.
Sherlock swallowed and walked back to the door. He opened it and let him in because John was right… he did have a sensitive side, “You have five minutes, Brian. I’ll go get John.” He slowly walked up the stairs and knocked on the door. “Hey, love. I need you to come downstairs for a second, it won’t take long.”
“Yes, of course, John... and I love you. Where is this going?” He was getting a bit fidgety, he didn’t like the tone in John’s voice. It sounded too close to the tone one used when they were about to break up with you, or give you news that wouldn’t be received well. Either of those options were unacceptable.
Sherlock nodded and began to tell him everything. He started with the first text that came at his mum’s funeral, all the way up to what would happen if he didn’t jump. He didn’t mention anything that happened while he was gone though, it didn’t matter. “I just… I couldn’t risk telling you I was alive, I was terrified that they were still watching you and if you even showed the slightest bit of happiness they would have killed you on sight.” He took a breath, “I couldn’t risk your life that way. I would rather you be hurt from my death never want me back in your life when I finally came back, than for you to know I was alive only to die. You must understand that…”
He watched as John gave his speech, and had to swallow back tears at the look of sheer hollowness on John’s face. He watched them lower his casket in the ground, and watched as Mycroft looked away. He watched as Claire and Zack tried to get John to leave, but after an hour of John not answering them they finally gave up and left. He watched as John stared at the pile of dirt for hours, waiting for him to do something, but doing nothing…
John threw a pillow at his back and headed downstairs. He wasn’t angry, he was just hungry, and he figured it wouldn’t hurt to give Sherlock some privacy… well, and also because if John was in the room he wouldn’t be able to stop staring. He fixed himself some breakfast and sat down to eat his oatmeal. He felt like it was bland and he never really was one to like the taste of oatmeal, but really that was all they had at the Holmes residence because apparently some people didn’t like much flavour. John glared at the ridiculous thought.
John walked up to the Holmes mansion and swallowed. He went through the side door because he really didn’t want to be seen, not to mention if he was seen Sigar would not hesitate to kill him. He walked into his bedroom and started packing his bag. He was happy because he was in fact not seen and had managed to get into the room quietly. Halfway through packing the door creaked opened and John swallowed hard. He didn’t know who it was, but he wasn’t about to turn around to look.
“Don’t talk about that here...” He whispered quietly and then slowly retracted his hand. “Sherlock... everything I did... everything I said... that
-Ten Hours Earlier-
Sherlock didn’t pay attention to the movie though – he couldn’t, his mind was wandering with all the things that could have been and he couldn’t make it stop. Everything hurt. Before he knew it the movie was over and John was nudging him, “Want to go to bed?” He asked softly.
John sighed, but nodded back and stood up, “Yes, of course. Just let me get ready and I’ll meet you in there.” He knew Sherlock was avoiding the topic and he hated that, but at least Sherlock wasn’t ignoring him anymore. That was a start.
John pulled out his phone and played with it in his hands. He took a sharp breath and quickly texted something else and sent it to Sherlock.
They ended up staying there for three days before John got a call. Sherlock hadn’t even moved from the couch, except for when he had to pee. He hated himself for not being closer to John, he could have had more time with him, but it was too painful to even entertain that fact – let alone act upon it. John sighed and answered his phone, “Hello?” He was silent for a minute and then his face dropped, all the colour flushing out from him, “Oh my–“ He choked out and swallowed, “No! I’ll be there in a minute just – fuck!” He hung up and threw on his coat as he grabbed some shoes, they didn’t even match, but Sherlock knew the last thing on his mind was properly matching shoes. “Sherlock, we’re going.” He said gravely.
"So- so you brought me here to make me
“I question my sanity too sometimes.” He smirked. “But I figure normal is very boring! Who would want to be normal anyway? I’d rather be extraordinary! Like Sherlock Holmes for example!”  He grinned and leaned back against his railing.
Question:
Sherlock nodded and slowly followed him into his office. He sat down next to John as the DI sat down across from them, the only thing between them was a desk. Sherlock watched as the DI slipped him an envelope. Sherlock didn’t understand still and that was really frustrating to him. But then again he wasn’t understanding a lot of things at the moment. He slowly opened it and inside was a cheque for £500. “What’s this for...?”
Mycroft gave him a glare to shut him up and then turned back to John who started talking again. “I was really scared because he was a powerful bunny and I didn’t want him to catch me! But after a while I sneezed and he heard me and told me to come out.” John snickered as he made his voice go unusually high at this next bit. “’I know you’re under there!! Come out!’” He went back to his normal voice. “The voice sounded so nice and so I came out and looked at the silver bunny! It told me that I shouldn’t be sleeping under things and then it wanted me to go eat with it! So I listened because it was such a nice bunny!” John gasped. “Cakeman!! Maybe I can marry the bunny one day! It was soooo nice!!”
“....no.... I want to surprise him,” He said slowly. “What’s he doing nowadays anyway?” He knew he said he would be done no matter what had happened, but this was different. How could Sherlock write if he wasn’t getting his letters, and why would he continue to write if he thought John was dead? He supposed that’s why he was still trying.
Sherlock woke up gasping and panting for breath. He swallowed hard and looked at the clock, it was only 03:07… He was covered in a layer of sweat and he knew he wasn’t going to go back to sleep anytime soon. Replaying the nightmare in his head it really shouldn’t have been as terrifying as his body made it out to be. There were just thousands of bunnies everywhere and they were running him down. They were going to get him and instead of a regular bunny face they had Lestrade’s crazy manic face on them. God, what had John done to him? He didn’t care though… Lestrade was taken in and he wouldn’t be able to come out.
so if you like my story and have not KUDOS IT OR SUBSCRIBED! YOU SHOULD DO THAT!!!! Also i love hearing what you guys have to say more than anything... so please please comment!!
Sherlock rocked back and forth a couple more times and then came as well. John was so amazing and perfect, he would miss being able to see the boy’s face every day, he would miss making him laugh… he would just miss him. They laid in silence for a long time before Sherlock finally pulled out and got up to go to the bathroom, he brought out a wet washcloth and then knelt on the bed to clean John up. John laid there and looked at Sherlock, “I love you...” He whispered as Sherlock wiped off John's chest, “you know that right? You’ll always know that...”
Sherlock picked up the remote and started to click through channels until he settled on James Bond movie. John seemed to like those and he wanted to please John. He didn’t want to watch a movie at all, but he thought John did and that was what mattered.
“The next thing I knew I was waking up chained in a room filled with concrete. It was cold and wet and I was in nothing but my pants. I was terrified. I had never been more terrified. They beat me daily… The scars I have on my back I- it’s a constant reminder of what happened so that’s why I don’t take my shirt off. I didn’t want you to ask because I didn’t want to remember, but it doesn’t fucking matter because I remember anyway. I remember every god damn day of my existence. I remember what the whip felt like when it was struck against my back, I remember the burning feeling from the scolding hot iron rod. And no matter what I do I can’t- I can’t get it out of my head, John.” By the end Sherlock was shaking like a leaf and tears were running down his face.
"’And how can I be happy if you aren't even here!’ The little girl said stubbornly.
Sherlock trailed his left hand down John's arm until he slowly snatched John's wrist. He raised it above John's head and pinned it against the wall. John made a sound that went straight down to his groin. Sherlock moved his head and started kissing John's neck.
knock knock!
Well, okay, he did know how to fix it, but he wasn’t willing to do that. Though, if that was the only option John was going to accept, he felt like he probably had to. It wasn’t fair to keep any of this from John, John had been so open with him ever since day one and Sherlock struggled to be open himself.
Sherlock wanted to cry and that was really tedious because he currently had his mouth full. He wanted to cry because he finally had John right here with him and it felt so amazing and so
IM RUNNING OUT OF JOKES JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL! I WILL NEVER STOPPP
Mycroft sighed and gave a small nod. He went upstairs once Sherlock had made himself comfortable on the couch, taking a breath as he prepared himself. He grabbed a box of tissues and a glass of water on his way up, then opened the door and walked over to John, “You might need these – might not. I didn’t cry at all, but then again mother was in tears... I don’t know where you will stand, if you were the John from five years ago I know you would cry, but I understand your relationship with him right now is strained and you seem to have hardened with your time away so, here...” He awkwardly handed the pair of things to John and started fiddling about on his computer.
Sherlock smiled some and then went to hug him, “Thank you...” He whispered, John always had the best ideas – even when they weren’t actually his, but he was the one that sparked them.
okkkkkaaaaayyyyyy motherfuckers! so normally it wouldn't be up this fast because I have been super busy, but I found time to get this to you by July 1st. Wanna know why? no.. WELL TOO BAD!!!!!!
John flapped his hands and wiggled a bit, but in the end decided to follow Sherlock. They pushed through the doors and John was overcome with arcade music humming through the air. The place looked very retro and it had arcade games everywhere. It was no doubt a place where unwanted kids came to sort of cool off. There weren’t any staff either so John guessed the kids had found this place and managed to spruce it up. With what money he wasn’t sure, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to figure that out so he left it alone. Sherlock kept walking through the arcade until he came across a photo booth. He snickered at John and knocked three times, “It’s me, Sherlock!” He sung happily and glanced over at John again.
John blinked, “you- what..?” He turned to look at Sherlock, who seemed to be wearing a smug look upon his face and that just made John narrow his eyes at him.
Mycroft cleared his throat awkwardly and Lily sat in her seat, shocked. She had never met a boy as wonderful as John. Someone who took care of her son and made him happy. And not only did he take care of her son, he tried to take care of them too when no one else would. Her eyes flicked to the door and she had a fleetingly thought she should go after him, but she didn’t dare move because she was afraid of what Sigar would do…
“Drop it? DROP IT?! Sherlock another man almost stuck his cock up you forcibly! He probably got off on it just so he could watch you scream and beg for mercy and you’re telling me that everything is okay? I don’t buy it for a second! How far did he get?” John growled. He knew it wasn’t his business but he was honestly livid that someone would do that to Sherlock, he needed to know.
Claire clenched her jaw because that was a sensitive subject for her, “You want to fucking die so much? You want to leave me and everyone else behind? Do it! Be my fucking guest, John! I don’t have an obsession with you. I couldn’t care less if you lived or died just DO IT!!!!” she screamed without even thinking and threw the box of fried rice across the room.
Once inside he pushed Regan up against the wall and kissed her. It wasn’t sweet, it wasn’t caring, it was just hot and messy and had no meaning behind it whatsoever. It felt... it felt wrong honestly, but John pushed those feelings down as hard as he could and tugged her to the bedroom. He was going to sleep with her and it would all be okay in the end. Even if Claire was right about a one night stand he figured it couldn’t hurt to be loved by another person even if they were just going to end up leaving you in the morning. Only… this wasn’t love at all.
John tugged her into the bed and kissed her deeply, shoving his tongue in her mouth. After a while of kissing he slowly snuck his hand up her shirt and cupped her breast. He swallowed some and wanted to jerk away, but didn’t. It – it wasn’t right at all. He didn’t like the feeling of it in his hand in the slightest. He growled and shoved the feelings farther down. He needed to do this – Even though he hardly knew the girl, he needed to have this happen. He took a breath and started kissing her again, trying to get back the energy he had before.
John sighed, “Yes, and how did you know about Afghanistan?” Come on! Come on! Show me how brilliant you are!
Sherlock woke up with a jolt and nearly fell out of the bed, “What the heck was that for…?”
“Thank you! Thank you so much! I promise I’ll be good and I’ll help you with anything you need help with!” John bounced up and down and he squeezed Sherlock's hand. Then it seemed like everything would last forever... but now it was ending.
Mycroft shook his head, “He’ll catch you, you won’t get away with it.”
I tweeted that to Amanda Abbington once and she never replied so she never got the answer.... pity.
Sherlock blinked and watched from the grass, he was so proud of John… His John. He really didn’t expect that happening, and deep down he figured John would never come out and they would live their life together in secrecy forever. He smiled softly and tried to crawl towards John to help him, but was in too much pain to even get anywhere so he just gave up and watched John from where he laid.
“Oh! That’s a friend!” Sherlock grinned brightly and then winced because John would now think he was mental!! “Well... I say friend.” He gave a slight smile and swallowed... it didn’t exactly clear the awkwardness, but it was better than Sherlock stating that that was basically his only friend.
John shifted, but he would not punch Sherlock. He would not hurt him… not after what he said. “No. Just leave him alone.” He closed his eyes and he knew by not doing something it would speak volumes about their relationship, but he just… he couldn’t hurt Sherlock.
“One sunny day. Exactly a year later the little girl saw a ball. More like an orb of light. Bright and burning and beautiful. She ran to it and the orb flew around her happily. She giggled and she felt like the hole that had been in her chest for so long was finally filled. She then realised that this was no ordinary orb. This was Bellfire. Bellfire had been sent to watch over her because when a love, and a friendship, is too strong and someone leaves the other person before they are meant to... They will always find their way back... Maybe I will be that orb of light for you, John...” He whispered quietly as he saw black spots start to fill his eyes. He smiled a little to himself knowing that even though he was dying at least he finished the story. For John.
WELL UNTIL NEXT TIME!
Sherlock frowned, "What are you hiding from me, John?"
Sherlock blacked out for ten seconds and John was sobbing and holding him in his arms when he finally woke up. John should have been mortified that Sherlock saw him like that, but he wasn’t. And now they were currently in the middle of the living room at Baker Street and John is just screaming at Sherlock.
Sherlock spoke with the lady for a while and then they were being ushered inside. Apparently her name was Mrs. Hudson and she seemed rather nice. He was glad he didn’t have to kill her because he hated killing old people... He would do it when he had to, but he hated it and there was no satisfaction in it. John Watson was a man of torture. He loved the feeling of blood rushing over his hands and getting all over his body, in his hair, on his suits, the smell of metallic, the taste of copper when it splattered onto his lips. He loved hearing the screams and begs and he loved playing god. He got to choose whether they lived or died and he always chose the latter. Always. But he would never do that to the elderly... It hurt too much and he was pretty sure he had Mrs. Turner to thank for that. He did kill them because money was money and he wasn’t going to be labelled as some weakling because he didn’t off an elder, but he wouldn’t torture them. Always clean and fast and quick so that they never felt a thing.
Sherlock’s breath hitched a bit as he noticed the fact that there was no ‘Dear’ or ‘Love’ or even an ‘I love you.’ However, there were still the twenty-six kisses and that made Sherlock’s heart ache. He continued to read letter after letter until he got down to the bottom of the box. There was one letter left and he was already a sobbing mess. 32 letters. 32 letters was all it took for him to break down. In a way he was proud of himself because he wanted to breakdown at letter 1, but he managed to tough it out until letter 32. However, John's 366 letter – his last letter – made Sherlock break. The fact that John had gotten rid of the kisses and everything else was just… it broke him. He thought that that would be the worst one, but really they were all horrible. Especially the one where he tells him about Miles. He took a breath as he slowly opened the envelope and swallowed hard.
He got up right next to John, so that the barrel of the gun was pressed against his chest. He raised his hands and wrapped them around John’s hands, “John...” He whispered quietly, “Please...”
John choked back a sob and without a word leaned over to kiss him softly... one last time. Sherlock kissed him back with more emotion than he had ever poured into the kiss. John was grateful that he didn’t reject him, he was terrified that he would considering how upset Sherlock was. Eight years was a long time to dwell on rejection... John took a shaky breath and ran his fingers down the side of Sherlock's torso.
AND OBVI SUBSCRIBE AND KUDOS!
“Don’t you fucking
John could tell he was uncomfortable and so was he, but he felt like this was something they needed to do, “You make me feel the same...” He whispered and slowly reached forward to grab Sherlock's hand. He entwined their fingers together and John slowly started to stand on his tip toes.
Normally, Sherlock would have corrected him. Told him his parents didn’t care and weren’t ever around. But not today… No, today was special so he just took John’s hand and smiled. “Thank you, sir. And yes of course I promise to go to school. I look forward to working with you as well – when you need me that is.” And with that the two young boys walked out of Scotland Yard.
The next day Sherlock and John woke up and started getting dressed again. John wasn’t feeling that great, but it was just a little tingle in his stomach. Plus, they were going to go see Lily today and John hadn’t seen her in five years... he wasn’t going to miss that for anything.
However, after a while his head started to feel extremely heavy. He couldn’t even keep it up on his own, and all his limbs felt like they were filled with heavy rocks. After several moments of struggling to keep his head up, he decided to just let his head fall back and hit the back of the couch. His fingers let go of the cup of tea, spilling hot liquid on his jeans, and shattering the mug all over the floor.
Sherlock banged his head on the desk and growled at John, “What part of ‘you are the worst person to live with and I’m
“JOHN!!!” He screamed, “JOHN PLEASE!!!” being drugged when it was against your own will was rather tedious.
John closed his eyes as he laid on the floor.  “I was at a diner, I think… I don’t remember. And then I remember coming here for clothes, but it’s all a bit of a blur after that.”
I don't really have any notes for the beginning... i'll save them for the end.. However, this is the end. The end of this story. I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it (:
mwahahah I am so tired and today I had to get into a lake that was 50 degrees for five hours! Fucking lifeguard inservices! grrr.
You should have seen her face when I drove pasta.
Claire got a break in the crowd of people and walked over to him, "John..." She said softly.
John didn’t care because he tortured people for a living, but Sherlock’s John would. He growled and then shoved Sherlock, “Clean. It. Up.” He spat.
It wasn’t the best of comfort, but he needed something and this was all he could have. He didn’t know where they were but he just held onto that little strand of comfort he managed to find and soon the car was falling. John screamed as they splashed into the water and started to sink slowly. He concentrated on his breathing and squeezed his eyes shut as the icy water danced above his ankles. This was going to be a lot harder than he thought because he couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that he was going to drown, he couldn’t escape it. It wasn’t going to be quick either, he was going to be in pain for minutes before his brain finally shut off. He didn’t understand how people could say drowning was a peaceful way to die, have they ever not been able to breathe before because that was certainly extremely painful. He thrashed in the back seat and tried to get loose. He was so cold and the water was up to his chest. The only thing he could think about was how someone was going to come and save him... this couldn’t be the end for him and he refused to believe that his story was over.
Sherlock wasn’t ever going to hurt John, not ever again, so he went as slow and as gentle as possible, preparing him, stretching him. He held him close with his free hand, while he added a third finger. He was also going to add four because he didn’t want John to feel any pain whatsoever... this needed to be perfect for the both of them and without proper preparation the first time was usually not a very pleasant experience.
John wasn’t an idiot and he knew exactly what Brian had wanted… even if a small part of him was hoping it wasn’t that. Even if he wouldn’t do it, but if he didn’t… if he didn’t then they would know and it wouldn’t just be Sherlock getting picked on, it would be him too! John really shouldn’t care that much about his reputation, but he did and if Sherlock didn’t realize it was about that before, he definitely would now… And it terrified John to think that Sherlock might not even want to date someone who cared about their reputation so much. “No, I’m not going to do it… you ruined his book so just let him go, yeah? I think he’s had enough and you’ve proven your point about being able to beat him up in a fight.”
John blinked a bit in surprise... in all honesty he was just expecting a hand job, but this was so much better. He groaned and tangled his fingers into Blake’s hair and thrusted. After about six minutes of pure bliss he came into Blake’s mouth and lay limp. He supposed these little adventures he had with the staff would be so much better if he could do it with someone he cared about, but John didn't care about anyone - he never did.
John shook his head and pulled away to look at Sherlock, smiling brightly while flashing those perfect teeth of his. “I’m not laughing at you, Sherlock... I’m just happy because you make me happy. I love you, too. More than you can ever imagine and yes, of course I forgive you, you git. I always will.” He said softly as he leaned forward to press their lips together.
“No! Of course we haven’t had sex or anything! I wouldn’t dream of doing anything like that with someone who wasn’t you! I’ve been celibate since you left, John.” He smiled a bit. He wouldn’t let John find out that he slept with Brian all the time, and many other people for that matter. That would hurt him too much and he wouldn’t let John get hurt anymore. What he didn’t realise is lying would hurt him even more if he ended up finding out. Well, okay, maybe he did realise it… but he was Sherlock Holmes. John wasn’t going to find out.
“John!!!” Sherlock whined and looked at him, “No one will even see it! You’ll wear it under your clothes! Please...” He pouted, “It will make me happy.”
“Right…” He drawled, “Destroying John in the process. Doesn’t matter though. None of that matters, John isn’t who you think he is. He’s a murderer. We have at least one confirmed person he’s killed, but for all we know there could be many more.”
Sherlock blinked rapidly and then all hell broke loose. People were firing their guns left and right and Sherlock had to take a moment to figure out how to get his feet to work. He snapped out of it when he heard Mycroft call his name. He looked up and saw Mycroft throw something at him. Keys. He caught them and then looked at Mycroft who was running towards him.
SO MANY ERRORS IN THIS CHAPTER! FLAILS EVERYWHERE!!!
jOkE oF tHe ChApTeR:
March 2, 2018
“John, I have been losing too much blood… I got shot before we even left the house – Just please.” He whispered.
“That’s because you’re a man, gay or not, most men usually think the only ways to solving relationship problems are through their penis.” She smirked and rolled her eyes playfully at him.
“Of course I have,” he said as he finally got Sherlock's shirt all the way opened. “You aren’t really my type… too skinny, but I suppose since your lover didn’t show up you’ll have to do. It’s a shame too, he really was well fit and perfect.” He let out a sad sigh as he ran his fingers all along Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock swallowed and looked down at him, “My father...” He hissed back, he didn’t want to hiss, but he also didn’t want to give up on this fight so easily.
John frowned. “I’m sorry – and no, that is not pity. I am genuinely sorry because no one deserves that... Not ever, but I also think that you shouldn’t not like anyone just because of one bad experience you had when you were six….”
John shook his head slowly. “No, I wanted it to be a surprise.”
This living (L)
“Really Brian? I thought we were over this phase of yours…” Sherlock sighed loudly, though his heart was pounding on the inside of his chest and he feared John would hurt him again. John did promise he wouldn’t, but Sherlock wasn’t sure if John could handle his reputation getting destroyed at this point in time.
Listen up and I will (T)ch you. A thing or two.
Sherlock did in fact follow The Doctor and Donna trailed behind them. When they got to the TARDIS’ door The Doctor held it opened for Sherlock to step in first. He took a deep breath and slowly entered the TARDIS. He blinked rapidly and just took everything in. “How.. HOW is it doing that!!” He asked as he heard The Doctor step inside.
John whimpered because Sherlock was just sitting there and that wasn’t very nice of him. He heard Sherlock chuckle softly and then he started to move in and out, slowly, like a rocking motion. He held John close and kissed John's collarbone as if to say ‘I have you John and I’m never letting go’, but they both knew that once this was over they would have to let go and John would have to leave.
! “I love you, Mummy...” He whispered quietly and kissed her head.
John swallowed thickly and he wanted to be angry – well, he was angry, but now was not the time to bring it up. He knew he had no right to be angry over the fact Sherlock had sex with Brian. He was technically dead... and if John really had died he would have wanted Sherlock to be happy, even if that meant him sleeping with Brian. That didn’t mean he still wasn’t angry though, but the thing that stung him the most, is Sherlock didn’t stop when he came back… not for a whole week… He ran a hand through Sherlock's hair again and kissed the side of his head, “I’m sorry...” He whispered.
Wasn't that so good? omfg!!
Claire almost threw her phone, but then she couldn’t yell at Sherlock, and she would much rather yell at Sherlock. “Actually, it’s fucking not, Sherlock. I’m not saying that you’re not hurting, but you are not hurting as much as John and do you want to know why?”
OH WAIT I HAVE A V SERIOUS QUESTION!!
“Yes, but a sexy five-year-old!” He smirked and opened the front door.
“It’s my house.” Sherlock hummed slightly.
He patted Mycroft on the head and then limped back to Baker Street whistling.
Marilyn Monroe!” The red headed blinked in confusion and shock.
DEUCES BITHCES!
“No! It will be too late and I won’t let you walk home alone in the dark!” John snapped before he could stop himself.
John regretted texting him immediately, before when he texted him he didn’t see Sherlock read the message. He knew that Sherlock was ignoring him, but he didn’t have to physically see it so there was that slight hope in the back of his mind. He could make up excuses as to why Sherlock wasn’t replying back to him, but this time he had no excuse. He saw it happen and it hurt more than anything. It just added to the pain he was already feeling. He felt like he was suffocating and he needed to get out. He stood up and left the lunchroom, he didn’t know where he was going to go and he really didn’t have anywhere to go so he just went to his next class and waited.
“Plus, you two didn’t end on a good note... I’m rather excited. You jump. John lives a miserable life, until he inevitably breaks your promise. Or you stay... and you watch John get shot in the head. Your choice.” Moriarty growled. “Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose.” He said lowly, his eyes flickering all over Sherlock's face.
Sherlock's eyes flew opened and he swallowed hard. He shook his head and looked conflicted, but didn't say anything. John was saying something, but Sherlock's phone buzzed again and there was just a ringing in his ears. He looked at the words on the screen and clenched his phone tighter.
(See the end of the chapter for
He ran down the road a bit, not quite sure where he was running to, but not caring either. It didn’t last long though because something was suddenly yanking him into an alley. He flinched as he got pushed against wall, groaning as the pain flooded through his back.
“Leave a note when?” John’s voice cracked, but he didn’t care, he didn’t care about anything. He needed Sherlock to get down right now – after everything they had gone through for each other and it was going to end like this? That just wasn’t acceptable.
Sherlock swallowed hard and closed his eyes, John would never forgive him, John would never know why he did this, but it was better than watching John die on his hand.
They chatted about life for the next couple of hours and for that time John just forgot... and it was glorious.
“He’s an annoying, cocky, rude bastard.” John grumbled.
John sat in class twirling his pencil around his finger, waiting for Sherlock to come through the door and take his seat in the middle of the classroom. The bell rang and Sherlock wasn’t there and John knew that he wouldn’t be making an appearance…. God, he felt like a prick, but he had to do it. He sighed and listened to the teacher, until someone poked him in the ribs. He jumped, but was able to keep quiet and looked at the culprit, which of course happened to be Brian. He sighed and turned his head to look at him. “Yes?”
forgive him for this!" He spat and then reached his hand up to the necklace he never took off, the necklace that had a piece of Sherlock in it, the necklace that was a part of their love. He wrapped his fingers around the heart and yanked it off of his neck, breaking the chain as he did so. He looked down at it in his hands and only then did he realise he was crying. A drop of water landed right on the heart pendant and his own heart broke even more than he thought it could. He looked up at the sky and clenched his jaw, he was thankful Mycroft didn’t put Sherlock's funeral in a church – especially since he didn’t even believe in religion.
"I like that jumper on you." Sherlock smiled, making John lose his train of thought. "It's probably the only one I do like. It's not hideous!"
i just started an online math class today and im terrified... shit i need to go work on that now... okay byyyyeeeeee
Sherlock's breath hitched and he shook his head, “don’t talk like that... you’re going to be just fine. Don’t talk like you’re already dead...” He whispered and shut his eyes a bit, because he couldn’t handle the thought of an already dead John. A John going into his death sentence willingly, but not wanting to stop it.
John took a deep breath and clenched his jaw as he continued packing. Sherlock was still sleeping by the time Garrett and Mycroft came over and into the room, honestly he was surprised the boy hadn’t woken up yet through all the noise. He figured it was because this was the first night he really slept since he started getting the text, the thought made John want to vomit all over again, “Ready?” Garrett said at the same time that Mycroft growled: “Let me see!”
“Can..” Sherlock swallowed. “Can you show me, please.. I want to see.” He said quietly.
“Sherlock... you’re being a bit dramatic.” He grumbles and then huffs.
John swallowed hard and he felt like he was going to throw up, but he would not cry because he didn’t know what Sherlock was talking about and it most certainly wasn’t what he was thinking... It couldn’t be. Sherlock loved him more than anything, he told him that himself. Sometimes Sherlock didn’t really understand social queues so he probably got that saying mixed up with something else. “That’s what people say when...?” He whispered and continued to sit on the floor.
He grumbled to himself and didn’t say another word because there was nothing to say. Soon they were where he was supposed to go and he was pushed out of the car. He growled a bit because they could have at least been gentle with him. They pulled the bag off of his head and John blinked a few time to regain his eyesight back. He saw a man leaning on an umbrella with a chair in the centre of the room. The chair wasn’t for umbrella man so it must be for him... ha! There was no way in hell he was using that!
“John that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but was laughing and smiling.
time. But Sherlock had to go and push her away, he knew she didn’t blame him, though, but that didn’t stop him from blaming himself.
He grumbled to himself and hobbled down the stairs because if he didn’t hobble someone would see and then his cover would be blown and he was not having that! Although, he really did hate this limp so he was really hoping something exciting and dangerous would happen soon so that he could ‘forget’ about it.
Sherlock blinked, “Oh... right... sorry I’m just stressed with everything right now.”
DEUCES!!
(U) Listen here, My dear
“You’re an idiot!” He groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. “That’s not why I’m upset. You know what you are? You think that you’re going to make something of yourself, but really you’re just going to be normal – simple. Live an ordinary life, in an ordinary flat, and Sherlock is going to end up leaving you. You’ll find a nice woman and settle down, even though you’re gay because you want the furthest from Sherlock you can get, but after a while that won’t work either. Perhaps it’s because she knows how unhappy you really are, or perhaps it’s because you won’t be able to ‘get it up’ in bed – or wherever you decide to have sex. You won’t have the war, you won’t have any family, and you’re going to start to slowly break. You’ll become a shell of a man. Do you want to know why? Because you’re pathetic. You’ve always been pathetic, you may think you’re invincible, stronger now, but you’re not. You never will be.” He growled.
“Yes, John, I know! That’s why we have keys!” He got to the car, threw John into the back seat, and slammed the door. He winced a bit as he ran to the driver’s seat and started the car. Sherlock stomped on the gas and the car peeled away from their driveway.

Aiden blinked rapidly and frowned some, “I thought…” He trailed off before narrowing his eyes at him, “were you just using me to get back at that guy who came in?”
They ate the salad next and soon the main course came out. It seemed to be some sort of fancy salmon dish. John couldn’t really tell, but when he took a bite his mouth flooded with all sorts of flavours and it was one of the best things he’d ever tasted in his whole life. He was about to make a comment, but Sigar beat him to it.
“Sherlock...” Lily warned to her youngest son.
Sherlock jerked back to life at the sound of Mycroft’s voice and smiled a bit. “Hey… Do as Mycroft says, love… Be my brave little soldier. Can you do that for me?” He smiled as best as he could, even though he tried to smirk, and John nodded. That was all he needed from Sherlock. He climbed out of the car awkwardly and they ran to Mycroft’s car, where John climbed into the backseat, still holding Sherlock. He sat down and Sherlock whimpered a bit.
John’s jaw was clenched. This- This-
“Possibly... but I don’t think he will... I just have a feeling and I know that that’s stupid, but I’m being selfish right now and I need you...” he looked down at the ground, honestly he didn’t even think about what would happen now… He stopped thinking about that the second Mycroft told him that John’s dad had escaped.
Hey hey heyyyyyyy it's me again! I feel like I haven't been away that long, but who the hell knows nowadays? anywayyyy this chapter is hella long... like SO LONG! So I suppose that makes it worth the wait? It's also three in the morning right now but I'm not going to post this until like four PM tomorrow so like.... that's cool. Anyway I have some more stuff I want to talk about, but I'll do that at the bottom.
“I’m fine, John!” He snapped, pulling his hand away. He hated being rude to John, but if he allowed himself to give in to John's comfort, he wouldn’t be able to stop.
I've been trapped inside this (K)ge for ages
Mike about choked on air and slowly laid down next to him. "That's.... Different."
John swallowed hard and looked away.
John sighed and then looked up at him. He put a small smile on his face and shook his head once, but Sherlock new that smile was fake and that hurt him, “I know you didn’t mean it... I just – I don’t really know how to support you, Sherlock – how to comfort you... I know your mother’s death is having a big effect on you, but let me help... please. It’s literally killing me seeing you like this.” He said softly.
well....... fuck.
Three months came and went in a haze of darkness. Sherlock knew that that wasn’t an actual thing, but that’s what it felt like. Nothing had colour and everything was dark, grey, and gloomy. Sherlock had been dating Brian – well, that’s what Brian said anyway, that’s what he told people, but really they only got together for a shag every couple of days, it wasn’t exactly dating. However, he supposed that telling Brian that they weren’t actually dating would be a rather cruel thing to do and might even jeopardise the hook ups they had. He sighed as he phoned Brian because he needed sex – okay, so that was a lie. The sex made him feel guiltier than ever, but he kept on shagging the poor bloke because he was hoping that at some point that would change. Plus, during the actual act his brain shut off so he was able to forget, even if it was just for a mere ten minutes.
“Then maybe you should have thought about that before you–“ He didn’t have time to finish that sentence because John had put his hand over his mouth.

“Books..” Sherlock echoed again and then grinned. “I get turned into books!”
John managed to get another cab right behind Sherlock, honestly he didn’t even know why he was still following the insufferable tit. He gave the cabbie the address and actually ended up arriving before Sherlock did, like a good boyfriend he waited on the curb and stuck his tongue out at Sherlock when he climbed out – okay, so maybe the latter part wasn’t something a good boyfriend would do… but Sherlock deserved it.
The DI smiled back. “No, thank
After all the talks it was time to take her to be buried. Sherlock stood next to the grave and watched as they lowered her into the ground. He closed his eyes and felt the air swirl around him, calming him slightly. It seemed that he had no more tears to cry and that killed him, but right now he had peace.
Sherlock nodded, “I know where he went. Stay where you are. I’m finally coming home. I’m coming back to John.” He said firmly and then hung up the phone.
Sherlock smacked his own forehead, “No, John… no, you are not.”

Mycroft was sitting in his office trying to control the British Government. He had been able to work his way up quickly and now it appeared he was head of the British Government. Sherlock liked to say he

John looked at it and frowned, “What’s this then?” He asked, even though he knew.
Sherlock shrugged. “I was bored... And you were there. Like I said, the day you came and sat next to me in chemistry, I chose you. Really it could have been anybody, John...” he paused for a moment. “You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.” He hummed.
John blinked a bit and then narrowed his eyes, “Is that what this is about? You could have picked up a fucking pen and piece of paper yourself, you know!”
Joke 2 Answer:
....never mind. It's pointless.
Sherlock was literally five seconds away from pulling his hair out when John came back and sat next to him, “Hello!” John sung cheerily, while he took out his pencil and his notebook. He frowned a bit and looked at Sherlock who looked very grumpy, more grumpy than usual, “Something wrong?”
DEUCES BITCHES!
John was nervous and he was fumbling with the stupid plastic condom! He wasn’t even sure if there was a correct way to roll it on. Did it matter what side you used? God, he was embarrassing himself, but finally he got it on and lined himself up with Sherlock. “Like this…?”
“Right! Sorry!” he gasped and started moving. Slowly at first and then eventually he couldn’t control it anymore and was practically pounding into Sherlock and screaming from pleasure.
“Your face!! You should have seen your face!!” He cackled and practically fell off the chair.
Sherlock was silent for a good minute, but to both of them it felt like hours. “Okay… I’ll tell you.” He finally said, because a world without John wasn’t a world he wanted to live in. He went through two years of pure hell for John and to come back and not have him was unacceptable.
Answer:
“Love Potion,” She smirked and watched him intently.
They didn’t say anything for a long moment, but eventually Claire spoke up, “I’m going to stay the night, okay?”
“Sherlock! For God’s sake! I need the money or you don’t get the coke!” Kevin sighed. “We literally went over this a half hour ago.”
“John,” Brian gave him a look that told John he wasn’t buying John’s shit, and rolled his eyes, “no you aren’t… Come on! It will be fun. Now, Truth or Dare?”
“Still are,” John smirked
Regan climbed back onto the bed and crossed her arms over her chest, “I’m not going anywhere.” She grumbled, “So how about you man up and fuck me and then I’ll leave?”
Seeeeeeeee you next time in Chapter 12!!!
Sherlock was grateful he didn’t bring up John and only thought about himself, in truth that was exactly what he needed. John always thought about other people before himself, he always put others first and Sherlock loved that about him. But right now he needed the opposite of John, he needed someone who was so selfish they didn’t think about anyone’s needs except their own. Brian could give that to him. He swallowed thickly at the thought, rolling over and closing his eyes, hoping sleep would eventually wash over him. It didn’t.
John huffed and threw in some pants before going to the bathroom to grab his toiletries, “what does it look like? You’re smart, use that brain of yours.” He returned back into the room and threw the items into the suitcase before zipping it up.
John smiled and nodded, “I was hoping you would choose that,” he said softly and together they walked hand in hand out of the school.
“Come on, John!! It’s a crime scene! There’s a body in there! If I can just climb through the window I can examine the body while the stupid police officers drink their tea!” he huffed, as he jumped up on the dumpster, trying to grab onto the windows edge.
“So you don’t actually love him...” He whispered.
John looked up and smiled a bit, she was very persistent. “I’m John.”
John jolted at the idea, then shook it off and nodded. “Yeah, alright,” he smiled. He was always so lonely on the walk home and he really did enjoy Sherlock’s company during class.
The bell eventually rang and John was regretting his decision to come to this class. He had this class with Sherlock and after about three months of being together the teacher decided to do assigned seating thanks to Brian and the other players. Somehow John and Sherlock ended up together, John was grateful for it then, but now he was dreading it.
Sherlock smiled a bit. “Alright, we can go tonight.” He replied. “But you don’t need to take me somewhere nice…”
Sherlock smirked, “Perhaps you are using the word ‘rainbow’ to describe me because you are in fact gay, you do in fact have a crush on me, and you just feel like ‘rainbow’ is the least offensive word you could possibly use.” He snickered and then before he knew it his face was being shoved into the grass and he was getting kicked in the side. Every kick felt completely painful, but John was watching so he would not scream… Even though he was 79% sure he was failing.
John started laughing hysterically and snatched the paper out of his hands before tearing it into pieces, “A fucking joke! That’s what that is! I’m tempted to go over and kill her for fucking messing with me!” He growled a bit.
Sherlock threw a pillow at the back of Mycroft’s head and laughed. Sherlock stuck his tongue out at him as Mycroft turned around to glare before he turned the corner of the hallway. Once he was certain Mycroft was downstairs and couldn’t hear them anymore he ran his fingers through John's hair gently. "John... John wake up, love…" He kissed his head.
DEUCES BITCHES!
John had brought Sherlock up to their room while he slept. He didn’t leave his side once, he couldn’t. He just laid down next to him and played with his hair softly as he slept.
He sighed, “He was born. That’s what he did. I didn’t want another child because Mycroft was perfect, but then his fucking mother’s vagina tore a hole in the condom. I swear the bitch has teeth in there,” he mumbled to himself before picking up his voice again. “So, she got pregnant! I’ve hated him ever since!”
DEUCES BITCHES
Okay so sherlock may not know if he is correct, but that is the correct way! I was a lifeguard and know CPR and First Aid... awwwwwwwww yeyyy I was also a swimmer and a water polo player so I could probably kick your ass! ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ
“Cover me!” John screamed to Gavin as he bolted from the rusted old car and ran as fast as he could. He dodged the bullets that flew passed him, across the fallen bodies, across the debris, and went straight for the boy.
John giggled a bit and rolled his eyes, “Aww Sebby!! It’s good to see you too! How’s your lover: James?” He hummed. The three of them had been friends ever since John was little... They were his only friends really and they would all torture bugs at recess... They grew apart once John told them that he didn’t want to work with them, but John had been teasing Sebastian about his feelings for Jim ever since they were fourteen. It was so obvious a blind man could see it, but Seb always denied it. He could see the way Jim looked at Sebastian too, but he didn’t know if they actually did anything about it or just pretended like they didn't have feelings for each other. Still, it was fun to tease his old friend.
Sherlock sniffled and crawled into bed, he clung to John and kissed his neck, “My hero.” He said as he wiped his eye pitifully.
“You’re full of shit. You’re a selfish prick and I know for a fact that you don't care about my happiness unless my happiness is revolving around you! You wouldn’t even be able to function without me by your side!” John hisses at him.
“Because John has no clothes so I need to go buy them for him,” Sherlock smiled brightly.
“Okayyyy,” She sung. “But don't say I didn’t warn you.” She giggled and started making him a drink, from where John was sitting it looked like she was pouring every bloody alcohol the place owned into it.
But at that point John started to feel guilty for even coming when he felt sick this morning. Sherlock was right, if he wasn’t feeling well he risked getting Lily sick too and making it so she had less time. He swallowed hard and nodded slowly, “I think I need to go home, Sherlock....” He whispered quietly and stood up, but then fell on the ground because his legs felt too weak. He whined some and just closed his eyes as he stayed on the lovely floor.
“No, my love. This is all about you. It’s my surprise to you so just lay there.” He whispered and started to take off his shirt slowly. He was already rock hard and his erection was straining against his trousers. He could barely even get home fast enough, and it turns out that running with an erection is not a pleasant thing to do. He got his shirt off and watched as John licked his lips. Sure, they had seen each other naked while they were getting changed, or getting out of the shower, but this was different. This meant something… this meant everything. This was their first time and it was going to be magical. It was going to be about forgiveness, love, an apology. All the feelings Sherlock felt, but couldn’t voice.
The words echoed around in Sherlock's head, though he knew John would not have him back right away. A small part of him at least
Later that night John snuck out of the flat. He knew Sherlock would be able to tell he was gone, but he also knew that Sherlock wouldn't try to follow him or be able to tell where he went. He took a cab to his car and then drove to his mansion. He was panicking and he hated every minute of it. He didn't want to do this and he didn't want to admit to anyone that he didn't want to do this.
Blake about gagged and pulled off, but nonetheless swallowed. That had to be the nastiest thing he had ever tasted in his whole entire life and he now had a higher respect for women who swallowed. Of course he never got any action anymore because he could never leave, but his respect still stayed.
They searched for hours and finally Mycroft got a text. He swallowed hard and closed his eyes, “Found him. He’s staying in a motel...”
“The Landlady owes me a favour... back in Florida about eight years ago I helped her out with her husband’s execution.” He hummed.
“I never actually promised…”
“You’ve made me feel loved and that– that is something very hard to do...” He swallowed hard and looked away.
Sherlock swallowed and then stood up and ran out of the house. He was terrified and he didn't want to tell John. He could fix this on his own, he knew he could and everything would be fine. What he probably should have considered is he left John alone, that gave whoever this was the perfect chance to strike…
also i'm laughing because john basically does a cinderella story reference at the end and i didnt even notice that until now - future me speaking.
Lily smiled warmly at him. “It’s not a problem, dear.” She turned to Sherlock and her warm smile turned slightly sad. “Listen… Sherlock, I’m going to have to leave for a few days.”
“That isn’t funny…” Sherlock grumbled, but smiled a bit at John. His sweet bright John, always finding the good in things even after a tragic event. He had no doubt in his mind that the last twenty-four hours were hell for John, but here he was, trying to make Sherlock laugh.
Sigar hummed. “Mmm, so no more suicide attempts? Pity. Because you see.” He leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table as he put his hands in front of his chin. “I rather think you’re a waste of space. You aren’t anything like Mycroft, and you won’t ever be anything like Mycroft. You won’t succeed in anything in life because you’re a fuck up. A mistake. Fucking condom didn’t work on your mother here. It broke. No one wanted you, Sherlock. You’re unwanted.”
“Actually, no... Listen... I’ll be home for dinner, alright?” He smiled softly.
“Please say something…” Sherlock swallowed as he kept taking in deep slow breaths to try and calm himself.
Sherlock swallowed and nodded slowly. “Yeah, they know... And it didn’t exactly help the situation when I threatened the principle.”
“YES THERE IS!!!” He screamed and his voice was a little muffled. John realised that his father was crying... or either trying really hard not to cry... “You are not the son I always wanted! You’re not the son I dreamed of having when I was your age! You aren’t anything like him and I can’t stand to look at you! I’m doing the world a favour! I’m doing you a favour! It will be quick... I promise! We are just going to drive into the Thames... That's all. It will be over before you know it.” He swallowed thickly and turned a sharp corner.
John hummed and started cutting off Sherlock's trousers. After a while he gasped, “Sherlock! I’m so sorry!!! I’M AN AWFUL PERSON!!! I accidently cut it off! You’re dick is gone! You’re like a girl now....” He started giggling uncontrollably.
Sherlock nodded once and stared at the rotting wall in front of him, “Good... I – good.” He said firmly. “Just give me a five more months, tops.”
Whitney.
Voices drifted into the darkness and he couldn’t make out what they were saying, or who they were, but there were voices. It felt like he had been here for only a couple of minutes, but John was almost certain it had been longer than that... and then he saw it. The light! He hummed and started walking towards it happily, he briefly wondered what heaven would be like and then he was completely engulfed in the light and pain shot through his body. He groaned a bit because that was most definitely not pleasant what the fuck heaven? John opened his eye slowly, groaning again as he did so, and immediately shut them. So he was in fact alive and not dead... well, he supposed that that was a good thing, but still.
John moaned loudly as Sherlock's tightness surrounded him. He wasn’t even paying attention to Sherlock's face so he had no idea if he was hurting him… all he knew was that he really couldn’t stop even if he wanted to. It felt so good and he could barely think! His brain felt all fuzzy and this was really so much better than his left hand. God, he didn’t even know it could feel this good. He should have done this ages ago. He finally got all the way inside and stopped to take a few breaths. John really didn’t want to come already because that would be the most embarrassing thing in the history of embarrassing things. Even more embarrassing than fumbling with that stupid condom. He also wanted this to last and he knew Sherlock did too.
also that NOT REALLY line john said totes reminds me of greggles when sherlock and john were in the jail cell together.
Sherlock stiffened next to him and didn’t say anything for a long time, he honestly hated the pause he was giving John, but he needed to get his words together, “I think it’s better if you didn’t know...” He whispered.
anyway! Until next time my dudes!
The Doctor shook his head. “No, that’s perfectly fine.” He smiled softly. “Just make sure you are back before sunset, yeah? Don’t want you getting lost.” He snickered a bit and Sherlock nodded.
I could have kept going, but it got long and I rather liked that ending so yeah that's how that happened! woooo!
fuck you, Watson! *OMG ME FROM THE FUTURE AGAIN. MY FIRST JOKE OF THE CHAPTER.... CRIES. i mean they are in previous chapters but that's only because i put them in there once i edited the story. So cute.*
“I practically dress like this every day…” Sherlock blinked slightly and frowned.
John smiled and ran a hand through Sherlock's mess of hair, “Obviously.” He rolled his eyes and then leaned in to kiss him gently.
John swallowed hard as he saw Sherlock stiffen, “nothing... and no. I’m not shagging Sherlock. Don’t know if you’ve lot noticed, but we haven’t exactly been talking.” He mumbled, they probably had noticed, but out of respect for their relationship decided not to say anything.
Sherlock closed his eyes preparing himself to be struck by the car when suddenly he heard the squeal of the tyres and his eyes snapped opened. The car had turned the corner... And he was alive because the car had turned the corner instead of going straight! And then the gears in his brain started to slowly start up again and why was that car going so fast?
They walked for a good hour and eventually they showed up at St. Barts. John took a breath as he realised where Sherlock was going and he wondered if maybe he shouldn’t have come at all – this was a private moment, wasn’t it?
“Because I thought it would be much comfier than the bed.” John said flatly as he rolled his eyes.
The man was by him in a second, wrapping him up in his arms and running his fingers through his hair, “Shh, John. Shh... it’s okay, my love.” He whispered.
“But sherlooocckk!!! I wanna go to Primark!!” he whined.
She ran a hand through her youngest son’s hair and sighed, “Sherlock, I really didn’t want you to see me like this. You’ve had enough pain, my brave little boy.”
Sherlock went to his room and tore up everything. He had to have some hidden away somewhere, but he didn’t! He couldn’t ask Brian either because Brian was broke and he wouldn’t do that to him... He swallowed hard and continued to shake and then he did something that he never thought he would do in his whole life.
His father hummed and smiled, “You’re welcome… and I suppose now would be the best time ever to tell you that John is dead. He didn’t make it and I think that is the best birthday present I could ever give you!” He sighed happily, “So glad you didn’t die when I shot you because than I couldn’t give you the best present I’ve ever given you.”
I'M ON FIRE!!! I will be having two updates in a row!! I will be updating Everything Is Not What It Seems later tonight! So if you love this story, but haven't read that one you should! John is an assassin hired to kill sherlock holmes! (;
“Now, Irene. Let’s not jump to conclusions here. I simply missed you and thought it best to introduce my boyfriend to you.” He explained, trying not to let the beginnings of a panic attack creep up on him. Perhaps this wasn’t a good idea after all, but he just wanted John to feel the way
“What the hell is wrong with me?” Sherlock groans as he holds his face in his hands, blood is gushing out, but John doesn’t make an effort to help him. “What the hell is wrong with
John immediately looked down again and clenched his glass of beer, but didn't say anything. Maybe if he didn't speak to her she would shut up and go away. However, she didn't. And he knew that that was wishful thinking on his part.
You have another thing coming! I could leave him anytime I wanted to and I would be fine! He isn’t the same, he’s just a fucking arsehole now. Yes, Sherlock controlled my life when we were younger, but that is no longer the case.” He hissed. He honestly didn’t even think he was going to go back to Sherlock once he gave him the letters.
John looked to where the long and slender hand gestured to and he nodded. “Yeah it’s absolutely massive. What about it?”
John narrowed his eyes slightly, he honestly didn’t know if that was true or if Mycroft was just trying to get a rise out of him. Though, if Mycroft was speaking the truth he honestly wouldn’t be surprised. The first six months Sherlock was not the same, he was constantly doing experiments and hardly giving John the time of day. He most likely drugged John on occasion just to test a hypothesis he had about an experiment.
Sherlock was silent for a long time. He grabbed the woman’s hand and smirked to himself. Bingo. Slowly, he lifted up the woman’s shirt and grinned even brighter and put the shirt back down just as slowly. “Yes. This was actually really easy and I seriously don’t understand why they haven’t figured it out yet.” He smiled up at John and opened his mouth to speak again when he felt hands on his biceps yanking him back.
Brian smiled sadly, “I got these because you obviously need something to cheer you up... I’ve never done them, but I don’t play rugby anymore so I figure its okay... I’ll do it with you and we can have sex... or not, but I hear that when you’re high sex is like magic...” He trailed off and started to lift up Sherlock's sleeve.
John clenched his jaw slightly and continued to give Sherlock a death stare, “yeah. He is.” He said icily. “Are you fucking kidding me, Sherlock?”
Anyway I’m twenty one now... oh how weird that is... bwhahha I’m so old help me.
Mycroft was silent for a long moment before he finally nodded and stepped inside, “Come in then... Kettle’s just boiled.”
Donna sighed. “Maybe… But I still don’t believe it… I wasn’t really ever a fan of the books. I thought they were too… Fiction to be a nonfiction book.. That sort of stuff doesn’t just happen..” She sighed.
John punched him harder and harder until he had stopped laughing. His father didn’t know when to stop! That fucking
Yo. you peeps need to get chour arse in gear and start leavin' me some shizzy shazzy comments.
“He’s like a really dry pie… You first meet him and you try and dig passed his layer of crust, but underneath that crust is just more crust! Nobody likes a dry pie, but you know what some people really, really like pie.. So you dig passed that first layer of crust to get to more crust. Then you keep digging through the crust only to discover you have hit more crust and you keep hitting crust for about twelve layers of crust and just when you think that this pie doesn’t have any filling you break the crust and the rich, warm apple filling is just within your reach…
John sat up immediately and looked at him with hurt eyes, how could Sherlock even
“What year did you say you were from?” John asked as he put the milk in the tea.
Sherlock groaned a bit. “I’m fine.” Sherlock tried to take deep breaths and he swallowed hard and closed his eyes, his head was killing him from hitting the steering wheel so hard. Where the fuck were the airbags? “Actually no, John… John… I need help.” He gasped a bit.
John's heart kept breaking and breaking and he choked on a sob. “No. That’s not going to happen. Not until you wake up because I know what’s going to happen, I’m going to kiss you and you’re going to let go…” He sniffled.
John froze for a second and his face hardened like Sherlock had never seen before, “He’s fucking dead, you bastard.” He spat in a cold voice that sounded nothing like John. He honestly looked nothing like John. His features were hardened to a degree that Sherlock had never witnessed, his voice was cold and harsh, but somehow monotone and empty. Sherlock honestly thought John was going to punch him, in truth, he would have welcomed a punch from John compared to what really happened.
