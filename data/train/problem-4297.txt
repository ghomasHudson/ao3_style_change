“That’s enough guys.” But they kept getting back up, “Guys, come on.”
Someone had been looking for something.
“I mean picture it!” Chuck began to say. “The two of you, your little lap dog Jack,” Dean clenched his fist.
The angels yelled and tried to attack back, but Dean would take the blade and cut right through them. He just needed to reach him.
He flung out his hands. Sam and Dean collapsed to their knees, groaning with pain as it felt like their insides were being crushed.
Jack ran from one of the halls, holding a half open book and looking anxious to hear what Sam and Dean had come up with. Michael and Amara walked in with purpose, but as Michael's eyes briefly flashed a glowing blue, Dean realized that the two cosmic beings had probably just been sitting around, Michael and Adam taking the time to catch up.
There were too many. They pilled down on him, clawing at him. They would tear him apart.
Castiel laughed, which, actually from the hoarse quietness of it all Dean would've probably mistaken that for a sob, which he still kinda was.
As Sam and Eileen ran down the grassy isle, they were followed by wedding crowd members, Dean leading the other groomsmen, Jack, Garth, and Cas with Charlie taking charge of other bridesmaids Jodie and Claire. Little Gertie, Garth's daughter, threw the remaining flowers from her basket onto the newlyweds, as she'd been asked to be the flower girl.
“We didn’t get to Billie in time did we?” Sam said quietly. He didn’t expect to get an answer but Dean sighed, leaning his head back against the bricks behind him.
"Of course."
Castiel took it, nodding and smiling. Dean led him onto the floor, taking Cas's hand in his, wrapping his other hand around Cas's waist. For once, Cas wasn't wearing his trench coat, just the plain black suit. A rose was tucked in his front pocket, one Dean had put there himself.
Sam nodded. "Point taken."
Sam got up and made to punch Chuck, but Chuck hit him in the throat and kicked him in the crotch.
Something came from out of the dark and slammed into Dean, sending him flat on his back.
"But Jack brought you back after you were literally smote by God. Can't we just do that?" Dean suggested, but part of him already knew it wouldn't be that easy.
“That wasn’t-…” He started to say. “I didn’t-“ But in another blink he was gone.
“It was all Chuck,” Dean continued. “He started ganking everybody and... Sam, it was all my fault…” His voice broke, and he hid his face in his hands.
I might post other works that take place in a sort of "post canon" to this. Yes I am in denial, my comfort characters are still alive :)
“Against me?” Chuck laughed. “Come on I’m- I’m God.” He took a step forward.
“See this… this- this is why you’re my favorites.” He looked up at them.
Chuck hit the dirt with a thump.
Michael looked at her warily, still holding the angel blade. “Sam, hand her the book.” He said.
"And we wouldn't be able to kill it would we?" Sam said, thinking.
He took a large sip from the whiskey bottle, wiping his mouth afterwards, and leaning against the dresser.
"What the f-"
The empty smiled at him and leaning forward, making Castiel shudder.
“I could find a reaper.” Michael interjected.
Moments before they were in the streets, the accomplishment of saving everyone around them, but Amara had zapped them all back to the bunker, believing they were in need of a better place to talk.
Michael circled around the table to get a better look. “That's one of Death’s books.”
Castiel had been sitting in the dark for a while now. Watching the way he had let Jack's grace get stolen by Lucifer, and how he had let Michael take Dean. It should be soon now. The empty would come, hurt him, and then throw him back into the abyss.
"No," horror filled his lungs as tears started to pour from his eyes.
Sam sighed. “I don’t think it would have mattered. Honestly, they’d probably all be dead anyways just cause Chuck likes to screw with us for ‘plot convenience’ or whatever.”
Then it's eyes flicked to something behind Dean, barely noticeable.
"Yeah only seven hours. Do you know how much stuff we have to get done before then? Get up, we have things to do!"
His heart almost stopped. The same trench coat, the same fluffy black hair, the same beautiful sky blue eyes.
The empty was gone, and the portal had all but faded into darkness.
speech was very cute. Especially since it wasn't so 'unrequited'. It's funny to me but... had you told him earlier you might have been able to spend some time with him."
Jack looked outraged. “Why not?!”
Michael smiled. “Good work.”
Dean sat there, phone at his feet, staring numbly at the floor.
"And that wasn't the only time was it? No no no, you decided to go and tell him that he is the source of all your problems. The 'something that always goes wrong'. That one still hurts him awfully. You apologized but that doesn't matter. You still said it. And you meant it too..."
"I'm gonna get you out of here ok?" Dean spoke softly to him. Castiel squinted at Dean, as though trying to figure out who it was. His eyes traveled up the pants, flannel, angel blade, but they stopped at the coat, bloody handprint still on the shoulder now darkened with time.
“What the hell?” Dean said, glancing between Jack and the plant.
“Just wait a moment.”
With the golden glow of his eyes, he held onto Michael and Amara’s hands, their eyes began glowing the same color, golden veins traveling up their arms from where Jack touched them.
Dean glared daggers at Chuck. How could he do this?!
He gave Miracle one last pet, staring at the dog with affection.
Cas looked to see it, the empty, wearing Meg’s face.
Cas shook his head frantically. "No, no you can't- hhh you can't be here..." He started to pull away. "You're not real. You're a trick. You're trying to trick me."
Michael and Jack also sat at the table, taking a new interest in Sam’s proposal.
“Guys wait!” Chuck pulled himself after them. “No- NO WAIT GUYS!” He cried. He lifted himself and tried to run after them. “WAIT! GUYS, WAIT!”
"Cas it's me. Oh god you're ok. I found you, you're ok!" There were tears streaming from its eyes. His eyes maybe?
And like a bucket of ice water he knew what it was. These were all the demons he's killed, coming for him with a vengeance.
Dean struggled against the dead angel's grip. "No, no! Let me go! Cas!!"
Michael glared at Chuck. “I believe they can win.”
He gasped, the wind knocked out of him.
"Aw Sam, but he likes it." Miracle barked playfully, and Sam scratched the scruffy dog's ears. "Anyways it's your wedding day, so come on, wake up."
"'Anything that belongs in the empty will be put to sleep' remember?" The empty was beginning to dissolve into black. "As long as your precious Castiel's an angel, he belongs here."
The crowd turned, giving Dean a better view of Cas. He looked broken, defeated, and Dean saw with sudden start that what surrounded him, were other angels.
"Hey, what's with the song?" Sam asked.
"What I have is a little more than what Billie can give. It's a hand of God."
"Lonely? Come on Sam, you won't even miss me. You've got Eileen, and now your kids, Jess and Bobby. Honestly it's starting to feel a little crowded in here." Dean looked around the bunker, standing next to the table and tracing his fingers where their initials had been carved. The name's 'Jack' and 'Castiel' stood written in the wood now.
“Fellas, give it up now.” He told them.
Grace dripped from the cut, shining. It flowed from Cas's throat, falling into the black below, absorbed by the empty.
The bars and restaurants were empty.
Dean turned. "Well it's your wedding day and all and I thought waking you up to a song dedicated to your one true love might be the ticker to getting you out of bed." He gave Sam a smile before heading down the hall, followed closely by Miracle.
Thunder boomed overhead, the lightning flashing from the stained glass windows.
With a slight popping sound and a flash of light, there he stood, Michael, looking a little dazed.
“When God left heaven I was certain of his return. So I made sure all the angels and prophets burnished his image on Earth.” He looked around at every saint, angel, and holy almighty idol placed around the church. “The all-knowing, all-seeing, all-caring God.”
There lay Sam, head down, pressed against the table, books in disheveled stacks around him.
Michael stepped forward. "Do you have a specific item for us in mind?"
"Dean." Cas laughed, incredulous. "You really think I would choose my grace over you?"
— [to be continued] —
Jack turned to them. “I would also like to join you, in the rebuilding of Heaven. But I think I should remain here for a bit, maybe live my life a little more, without the constant threat of being killed or… used.”
Sam ran his hands over his face and through his hair, clear exhaustion in his shoulders.
Dean ran cold water over his face. He stood in front of the sink, gripping its sides, his head down.
Dean knew what that meant, and he was running out of time. He looked behind him to see numerous angels rushing at him, Zachariah furious and in the lead.
Religious books of all kinds were open and strewn about the seats. There was a large one sitting on top of the podium at the front of the room. Its pages were torn and slightly disheveled as if someone had gone through it at a frantic pace.
Wooden walls flashed around them, memories bleeding into reality.
Jack stood in the doorway, his eyes red and streaked with tears. He stared at Dean, before running at him and wrapping his arms around his middle.
The burning flared up over Castiel's entire body making him scream. The empty's smile turned into a grimace and it slapped it hands over its ears.
It was the same eerie stillness as before.
"The point was," Castiel grunted, forcing his voice to speak through the wheezing pain. "Dean Winchester was saved. From Billie, from you. Even if he never loved me, I have enough faith in him that by saving him, I have saved the world."
“Yes, they’re from your room.” Jack interrupted. He placed the plants on the table, and as he did, Sam noticed a few of them were completely brown and dead.
"Sleep." Sam said suddenly. "It wants sleep doesn't it? Cause Jack woke it up with Cas that one time, and wasn't that one of the things Billie promised to give it?"
“Jack!” Sam called and Jack turned around. “It's time to go.” Sam pointed over his shoulder at the Impala.
He glared at Chuck, pure fury in his eyes.
She looked down at her hands, and a large curved scythe appeared in her grip. It looked similar to Billie’s, but it was longer, with a wooden handle, and a more rustic appearance. A ring sat on her finger.
They all stared at each other, completely silent.
Maybe he was going to say something more. Maybe he would ask him to stay, or say it back, or… but he didn't get to finish.
Dean held Cas, mind racing, faced with a choice. He could lose Cas now, never see him again, or lose Cas later, once he's realized what's been done.
Rage bubbled up inside Dean, and he was reminded how much he hated this douchebag's stupid face.
The night had fallen.
Dean stood up. "Wait, what? What do you mean you're owed $10,000?!"
“Is-… Is Adam back?” Dean asked. Michael nodded, and with another surge of light in the eyes, the expression and posture changed, clearly Adam’s.
Then the reaper gasped. She opened her eyes and looked down at herself, standing up and breaking her bonds.
“What happened? What did you do?” Sam asked, confused.
The empty scoffed.
“And?” Dean prompted Michael to continue.
"Oh sorry, me and our friends have been betting on whether you and Cas would get together for years," He shouted from the hall. "Gotta go collect."
"I do not sound like that."
"A surprise? Oh come on, how could I not pass up an opportunity to," Dean cleared his throat and in his best Cas impression, "'Grip you tight and raise you from Perdition."
Sam had fussed over him, Jack had fussed over him, they had both fussed over Cas, Jack healing whatever injuries he might have acquired in the empty. The large slit across Cas's neck was an image Dean couldn't shake from his head.
Dean turned, horror stricken at the thought of what he might find.
"Castiel. It's been a long time." The voice thundered, and with a horrid sinking dread, he knew who it was. Castiel shuddered, feeling the hot breath on his face as his attacker leaned in close.
Dancing, laughing, at some point someone had opened up the bar so a great amount of merry drinking occurred. Jack stood in deep conversation with Amara, both reflecting on the more human sides of their rather cosmic lifestyles. Miracle slept peacefully by the buffet table, wagging his tail happily whenever people stopped to give him pets and treats.
“That nephillum…” Its voice shook with barely contained fury. “He made it loud…”
“We’ll give you what you want.” Sam started.
“Nothing. Nothing, nada, zip on how to bring everyone back from a freaking God apocalypse.” He looked down at the book before him, and closed it with a thud.
Sam and Dean got up, brushing the sand off their jeans.
Cas wasn't answering. Eyes closed, head lolling to the side. The vision of the barn around them was fading.
Dean was running out of time. The black was up to Cas's chest now, and Dean was starting to lose his hold.
“So this is how it ends.” Chuck wheezed, “My book.”
“You can’t!” There was desperation in Dean’s voice. Desperate terror on both the brothers’ faces. This is what he wanted, how could Chuck do this??
Castiel had touched his shoulder, for the last time he thought, and had tossed him out of the way, staring face forward as the empty oozed from the walls and enveloped him.
He took a deep breath and lifted his voice. "CAS!"
"Dean, what the hell?" Sam said groggily, throwing his pillow over his head.
"EMPTY!" He yelled. The angels were almost upon them. "IF YOU WANT IT, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU. BUT IF YOU DON'T STOP THEM YOU'LL NEVER SEE SLEEP AGAIN."
Michael  shuffled. “Simply because of the fact that we are angels, or at least angel descended. Sam and Dean are human, the empty has no jurisdiction over them, and thus cannot harm them directly. As angels the empty would give off side effects like that of reliving our worst memories and because we can be physically influenced by the empty, an encounter with the shadow inside may result in us hampering the rescue rather than heeding it.”
Light flashed, and Dean collapsed on the bunker floor, exhausted.
Castiel struggled for breath and grasped uselessly at the arms holding him, trying to get away, but to no use.
"Honestly, how could I not know who you are. Your feathered pal, I assume that's why you're here, he won't shut up about you. Oh he doesn't tell me directly of course but I see it, in his dreams, in his... memories."
Michael faltered, a look of pure bitter misery crossing his features.
The two left, arm in arm to their room.
The black seemed to thicken, like inky waves rising high above them. Dean took a step back, feeling unconsciously for the angel blade in his coat.
It's an epilogue. Sam and Dean finally get the happy ending they deserve.
"I'll check what we have in the library." Sam patted Dean on the shoulder before heading up the short bit of steps, heading towards the numerous bookshelves.
Everything was black except a soft golden glow off to Dean's right. He looked and there was the portal, quietly crackling, awaiting his return.
But he would tell Sam and Dean later. There were bigger things to worry about and they needed to find whoever was out there first.
"He would still be alive if it weren't for me!" Dean yelled in an anguished frustrated sob.
“Dean, Chuck would’ve done this anyway. It's not your-”
“No,” Dean looked affronted. That was not what he meant to imply. “I’m just saying, if Cas were here, he could use resources from heaven and find magic things to help us. Eileen is just human like the rest of us and she’d probably end up being in more danger than where she is now.”
He sighed, and went to take a seat at a table, when he heard a slight whimpering from across the room.
Hell, he recognized a few of them, which did not bode well as he figured he had bad blood with most, if not all of them.
"No, no, not like that." Dean lifted Cas's face to look him in the eyes. There was a twinkle in Deans expression.
Cas looked confused but Dean just stared, feeling vaguely scandalized.
This thing wearing his face spoke in a high, nasally, voice that unnerved Dean in such a way it felt like nails on a chalkboard.
Michale’s eyes glowed with grace, before he broke into a bright overjoyed expression.
——————
“DEAN!” Sam’s footsteps pounded down the halls of the bunker, getting closer with each step. He ran to the dungeon, flinging the door open.
Cas slowly raised his head to meet Dean's eyes. Dean's heart thundered in his chest. Cas leaned across the table, and gently caressing Dean's face, he kissed him, soft yet filled with such a desperate longing, tears leaked from Dean's eyes.
Fire scorched his veins again and Castiel jerked and screeched, gasping and raspy. An impossibly large smile ripped through the empty's stolen face.
“Gone. Exterminated by my father… like everyone else.”
"Hmm, is this a special place to you Castiel?" Uriel spoke, motioning
“No,” Jack tried to explain. “It’s like… I sense a presence.”
There was no light, no shadow, no heat nor cold. The only sound was that of his own breathing, and a faint... noise, somewhere in the distance.
Castiel had to experience that one again once. He should have fought better, fought for Dean. Every time, he had looked so terrified, so hurt and betrayed. He had probably fought hard before, killing him over and over again, he knew he would have done anything to avoid that. But it still felt like he didn't do enough.
Chuck, terror in his expression, turned around.
"Oh he's somewhere around here." The empty gestured to the great blackness around it. "This place is remarkably intuitive. So, if you think hard enough you should be able to find him. But honestly why bother. Isn't it better to leave one messed up angel well enough alone."
After a moment he let go.
“So…. I’m the new Death…” She said, looking up and down her scythe. “Call me Betty.” She gazed around at all of them. “Now where’s the book? I assume that's what you made me Death for.”
“Is it… will it work?” Jack spoke cautiously.
He sat up. He was in a barn, the walls covered in painted black sigils and wardings. And with a sudden thrill of his heart he recognized it. Where they'd first met.
And as they returned home a week later, Sam smiled as he listened to the familiar rumble of the Impala, taking Dean and Cas home. It was a nostalgic sound, bringing back all that they had done over the years, and a reminder that they were free.
The smirk disappeared from Dean’s face.
The music intermixed with a variety of genres and as the song 'Dancing with myself' came on, Adam stood in the center of the dance floor, fittingly, dancing with himself. More towards the end of the night, a large number of classic rock songs began playing. Dean had been influencing the DJ.
He reached out to the plant mug, not powerfully, but slow, careful.
Cas sobbed even further at that, leaning himself into Dean's jacket, the same one he wore when he had left him. The bloody handprint mostly faded but still there.
Michale shifted uncomfortably. “I apologize for that. I was foolish and a blind follower of God’s plan. And now considering I have spent much time in a prison myself… I think it might be in both our best interests to avoid such experiences in the future.”
“Cas…” He spoke.
But they were too late. Michael had finally broken.
Dean stepped forward, half an eye on the portal just to make sure he could still see it.
"Cas! CAS." Castiel felt himself lift, the inky blackness sliding off him. This was normal, this is what happened every-time, but something felt... off. It was too peaceful... too silent.
“Oh there is.” Sam said. “But only Death can read it.”
The Impala rolled down the road, passing miles of empty fields and barren highways.
“Please.” Dean trembled, which stopped Sam in the middle of his protests. “Let me do this, Sammy. I need to do this. And I don’t want… I don’t….”
"Yeah!" Jack nodded enthusiastically. He looked at Michael and Amara. "Can we do that?"
Sam gave him a look. “Like hell, I’m not.
Soon enough many of the angels had been slashed away and were in the middle of reforming. Dean turned his attention to Cas.
Dean stood over Chuck, his shadow blocking the sun. “We won.”
"Oh my, the things I have seen in that poor little head of his. No matter where his worst memories take him they always seem to revolve back to you. Imagine that. Being able to cause that much pain in someone. Shall I tell you about it?"
Dean closed his eyes.
Sam looked at Dean. “So what, Eileen doesn’t matter?”
Amara turned. “Michael,” She faced him. “I haven’t seen you since entrapped me with the mark.”
“Why are you smiling?” Chuck said, the fear apparent in his voice.
They both looked up at him.
Thunder crashed as the Impala rolled up slowly to a large church. The stone walls towered high above them and the large stained glass windows made it give off an eerie glowing light.
In an instant the angels froze. Black sludge traveled up their legs and streamed from their eyes, but they stood motionless, fixed in a position of rage.
Sam hesitated, making a face like he wasn’t sure.
Jack turned to Chuck, staring him down. “It's not his power anymore.”
It was slow. Everything seemed slow. It might have been a week at most, but it felt like the days went on forever, the hours ticking by at a snail's pace.
Two years of living, and a letter showed up in Sam's mail.
Cas approached the table where Dean sat, and pulling out the chair opposite, he sat down himself.
“Why is it so loud?” Cas groaned.
Michael nodded, eyes already starting to glow. The three of them stood around the blade, each laying a hand on it. Their eyes all began to glow the same shining white, almost blinding.
Jack shot up, back ramrod straight. “I KNOW WHERE HE IS!”
“What's that supposed to mean?”
“We’re surrendering.” Sam gave a half-smile before it turned into a grimace. “We’re giving up.”
_____
As though gravity suddenly lifted, Cas came free from the pull of the dark, sending Dean flinging backwards, still holding onto Cas's chest.
Chuck snapped again, movements getting panicked and desperate as Jack grew closer. He gasped.
Coming up on an abandoned gas station, they decided to stop, the Impala needing gas, and Dean himself needing to use a toilet.
Sam walked along the halls of the bunker, in his arms the death book of God himself.
The empty held out its hand. "I accept."
Other things would come up, trusting Metatron, trusting Chuck, ..... Naomi.
"You're a fool you know. Sacrificing yourself that way. You'll be here with me, in pain for all eternity. What was the point?"
Dean smiled at Cas, bright and open, leading him in a slow sway to the beat of the music and leaning in close.
“As far as we know only Death can open it,” Sam shrugged. “But um… we’re hoping uhh.. maybe you can too?”
Chuck smiled at his own joke. Dean’s lip twitched. Everything about this dude was really starting to tick him off. But he buried his feelings, knowing exactly what they had to do.
It's lip twitched, craving to sleep again but hating to give in.
“You’ll kill yourself that way you know,” Sam warned. Dean chuckled and lifted the bottle higher in a cheering sort of fashion.
Sam, Dean, and Jack approached, Jack carrying Chuck’s death book in his arms.
“Dean, what do we do? I’m really trying but I can’t find us any options.”
“It’s Donna…” he said to Dean, pointing at the phone.
Isn't that what you wanted? Dean almost said back, but he kept quiet.
Do leave comments tho, I literally thrive off those.
“Hi,” He said, taking in deep happy breaths.
“SAM, DEAN? THERE’S SOMETHING I NEED TO SHOW YOU.” Jack’s voice called from up the bunker hall.
Sam and Dean groaned, a feeling of failure settling over them once again.
"Remember me?" He lifted Dean up by his coat lapels, and started dragging him away from the crowd of angels. "Don't worry guys, me and Deano are gonna have a nice long chat." The crowd of angels were starting to fade back into shadow, taking Cas with them.
God, this was it wasn't it.
They all stood silently, staring at the dead reaper, waiting.
"A certain recurring nightmare in the head of our dear friend Castiel is the way you decided that in his moment of need, vulnerable, human, homeless, you decided to just throw him out for the sake of another angel."
The wails were growing louder the angrier the empty got, which in turn, the louder the wails were, the more the empty seemed to rage.
"Look we made a trade. Your life in exchange for the empty to go back to sleep."
"Huh." Dean said, wondering at the information. "How are they doing, you're kids?"
The Impala rolled slowly into town. Dean parked at the side of the road and they all opened their doors, exiting the vehicle. The streets were still empty, not a human in sight, abandoned cars sitting in the road.
Cas chuckled at the double entendre. "Always…. although when I rebelled against heaven for you…. that's a specific moment that comes to mind." Dean nodded, thinking back through all their moments. "You?"
The group dispersed to their various corners of the bunker. Sam and Dean followed each other to the kitchen, taking a seat against the wall.
"I love you... I love you, I love you, I love you.... don't go!"
"Uh, yeah! They're good. Actually um... Me and Eileen, we're having another."
Hands shaking, he reached beside him where his angel blade had dropped.
Sam stood in the doorway, mouth hung open, shattered mug at his feet.
Castiel's whole body shook. His heart pounded, and dry, raw sobs came out with every breath. It was all flooding back to him. The dreams he'd dreamed about the life he could've had. Dreams he'd taken and stuffed so far down, only to look at them in the darkest of times, to wish, to hope, but to keep far enough away that they would never truly hurt him. All of that was pointless now. All the could-be's stood front and center, knowing that it might have been possible.
“I don’t know why my powers are doing this, plants just start dying around me and… what do I do?” Jack pleaded, looking down at his hands with worry.
They hit him, kicked him, tore at his clothes and his hair, screaming they're anguish at being stuck in the empty because of him.
"Cas, oh god Cas!" He felt a hand on his shoulder, and he flinched away expecting the pain to come with it. He turned around, waiting to see the familiar expression of the empty.
Castiel glanced around wildly, looking for anything to help him escape. There was nothing.
Michael nodded slightly, but gave no indication other than that.
"Honestly, I never in a million years expected to be a best man, let alone at the wedding of my brother. You know, we've always been in the hunter's life, so you always think you're gonna die young, go out swinging..." Bobby in the front raised a glass and the audience nodded, giving a low murmur of agreement, pretty much all of them having experience with the hunter lifestyle. "Basically, congratulations to these two for making it this far. Of anyone that I could think of for Sam, you Eileen, are perhaps the most perfect choice he coulda gone with. You're gorgeous, smart as all hell, and you keep my brother on his toes."
Sam sighed.
There. Dean felt the trench coat beneath his fingers and held tight, attacking anyone who came from behind.
Dean shook himself. He needed to get this over with quickly.
“I have an idea.”
But they lifted themselves up. Dean stood, facing Chuck, and Chuck just punched him back down again. He hit them, over and over and over again.
_______________
"You do, all the time."
Dean had barely any time to celebrate however before he watched with a horrible sinking feeling as the smoke settled on the floor, melting into the darkness and rising up with a new form.
Dean thought for a moment, moving his mouth as he frowned.
“NO!” Dean frantically fumbled for the hand. “NO PLEASE.”
Dean suddenly didn't want to know. The empty laughed, circling Dean, and in a moment he realized that the empty was standing between him and the portal. A feeling of dread settled in the pit of his stomach.
“Well whatever it is, shoot. It's not like the rest of us are coming up with any better ideas.”
"You just won't die, will you..."
"I know." The empty's eyes flicked back to behind Dean with a smug smile. "But they can."
"It's going to be a little more complicated than you might think, Dean." Michael said.
He didn't know if they could hear him. If any of the angels could hear him, but after a moment of watching, Balthazar and Samandriel looked at each other, then turned fading into darkness.
“Guys,” Worry started to creep in again. “I have no idea what we're walking into.”
Sam pointed. "Is that-"
Amara carefully took up the knife, and placed it within the leather sheath.
Dean tensed, avoiding Sam’s eyes.
Jack’s glow faded as Sam and Dean came forward. Sam walked up to where the death book had been thrown from Jack’s hands and picked it up.
A hot red anger boiled inside of Dean, but just smiled smugly, and gave a little finger wave before promptly disappearing.
Jack lay on his bed, making no movements to go anywhere.
“So,” Chuck clasped his hands together. “Why are you helping Sam and Dean? I mean picking a losing side, that’s a pretty idiotic move.”
“Oh come on, that would never work. Besides where would we find a reaper?”
Cas glared at it.
The empty rolled its eyes. “How Nauseating.” It made a gagging motion and with it the wailing seemed to swell.
Dean looked quickly back at Cas who was shielding his eyes, curled on the floor, breathing ragged.
Instantly there was a burst of light, and after a moment it faded.
Dean scowled. "No. Do not name it after me, that will be way too confusing and I will not be replaced by some dumbass child."
Dean took it. “You know I can’t kill the empty.”
Dean scowled. “I already told you. A while back Cas made a deal with the empty, and when Billie was after me, Cas summoned the empty so it took her… and it took him too. He saved me.”
—————
“You… You woke me up and then everyone had to know who I was and that bitch death and bratty child of yours had to make everything worse…” The empty laughed hysterically, becoming more unhinged by the second.
“Yeah... This could work.” Dean nodded, feeling himself getting hopeful.
“So what are you uh… doing some reading?” Sam said, staring at all the pilled books.
"Will you... Shut. Up."
"If you're asking how we got you out... we uh... we made a deal."
“No, NO! CAS!!”
"I like the way I can still make you blush."
Lightning flashed again, illuminating the sculpted faces of saints and angels around the room.
Sam groaned. He lifted his head slightly before sitting up and leaning on his elbow. There were deep circles under his eyes as he looked up at Dean.
Dean’s stomach dropped.
Amara nodded in agreement. “I should go with you,”
“Ok, Dean….” He relented. Dean closed his eyes, something like relief crossing his features.
"So what can we do?" Dean asked, grasping for any idea.
Dean turned to Jack. “You ready?” Jack smiled, breathing in.
Michael approached cautiously.
Symbols and warding littered the walls and it felt as though the floor turned to a soft dirt.
Chuck smiled that smug smile of his.
"I don't know what that is." Jack said, puzzled.
They slowly walked down the aisles, carefully looking all around, but it didn’t seem like anyone was there.
"Anything that belongs in the empty will be put to sleep." Dean countered, holding up the blade. "That includes both you and everyone else."
"Brothers," Uriel spoke, every angel staring at Cas with murder in their eyes. "He's ours now."
Dean shrank in his seat. “Thanks for telling him.” Dean whispered. Sam looked at him.
“You survived.” He said, his tone rather melancholy.
The dog dissolved into a black, sparkling, puff of dusty smoke. He was gone.
Dean smiled as he saw the dog they’d met earlier, Miracle, trotting by and panting happily.
Unlike the others, they didn't rush to attack Castiel, but they made no moves to help him either. All they did was look on, watching.
"It should be possible." Amara confirmed. "However we need something to carry power. It would take all three of us to put the empty to sleep," Amara gestured to Jack and Michael. "Problem is, I can't enter the Empty myself."
Behind him was what looked like hundreds, perhaps thousands of black inky forms, moving in the dark. They shuffled towards him at alarming speeds. Dean took out his angel blade and looked back to the empty, ready to tell it to knock it off.
"Dean?" Cas asked hesitantly. His voice was still raw, barely a whisper anymore.
The crowd roars, and Sam just mouths a quiet 'oh my god'. Dean chuckles to himself, before continuing. "Well, Sam eventually said yes, as you can see," Dean motioned to Sam and Eileen next to him. "But come on, pretty rude right to just leave her hanging..." Dean shook his head, smiling.
“But that doesn’t matter.” Dean smiled at Chuck, savoring their defeat of him. “We had to come up with a plan B and that wasn’t too hard, as soon as we learned that Jack, when he exploded in the Empty, became a power vacuum. Now all we needed to do was get Jack to you. We knew you’d want your death book, so we came up with a plan, to bait you.”
“I was tricked again wasn’t I? By Chuck?”
Excited cheers and sighs of relief rang out from across the room.
"Us. We did it.... got that... apple pie life. Finally got a well deserved vacation after saving the world, what like half a billion times."
Jack gasped. This had happened before, back at the safe house they’d made before everyone….
“What-… What happened.” She looked around at all of them, finally laying eyes on Jack and immediately sensing his power.
Dean heard footsteps coming up the hall, and lifted his head, expecting Sam to walk through the doorway.
It gave off an irritated twitch in its face.
"Come on, please..." Tears rolled down his face. "Don't leave me. You can't leave me. Not again, you stupid son of a bitch."
"I- uhhh, hold on I'll be right back." Dean ran off in the direction of his room, leaving Sam and the rest of them to stare bewildered after him.
Dean shrugged. "Yeah I kinda did- wait no! Actually, Henry, is the name of our grandpa."
“It's the ending where you grow old, you get sick, and you just die, and no one cares.” Dean said, letting in information sink in.
"Have you found something?" Jack asked eagerly.
“Alright kid, you think you can pull this off?” Dean asked. Jack looked at him and slowly nodded. He took a deep breath and lifted his hand.
"But we actually did it, didn't we?" Dean stretched out on the warm sand.
The thing smiled. "No..." It opened its trench coat in a mock bow. "Call me the Empty."
Dean shrugged. “It might be more helpful to have Cas, with his grace powers and all.”
“We admit defeat? We go to Chuck, do whatever he wants so he brings everyone back?”
The empty had grown tired eventually. Not all the time, but sometimes it would leave him alone.
“Hey! Wow.” Dean reached out and pet the dog’s head. It nuzzled into his hand licking it, appreciating the attention. “How did Chuck miss you!” Dean whispered to the dog.
“Look either way.” Dean rubbed the dog's head, “This guy’s coming with us!”
Standing in the far field ahead of him was Chuck.
Dean stood, holding the blade and bracing for impact.
He screamed, the energy flowing through him, creating bright, white, burn marks of power tearing through his face, his soul, his vessel.
Michael rose. “I’ll go retrieve one right now.”
They gasped as Chuck let up. He raised his hand, ready to snap.
There was a loud pop as Michael burst, creating a surge of energy around them, bouncing off the air and the waves ahead of them.
"Don't..." Dean spoke quietly.
There, sitting under a large wooden pallet, was a dog. Medium sized, blond and shaggy, it looked up at Dean with big brown eyes, whining and looking like it hadn’t seen anybody in days, which it probably hadn’t.
They swarmed him. Angels he knew. Duma, Ishem, Hannah, Theo, Hael, the hundreds that he had massacred as a result of letting leviathans from purgatory infect him.
"Why would I need you to give it to me when I could peel it from your dead corpse."
Jack looked down at his hands. “I distributed some of my power between Michael and Amara. I think it's time we have more than one ruler, and they have my trust that they will be fair and unselfish in their leadership. Michael and Adam being an advocate for angels and humans, while Amara leads as the greater cosmic entity. I can act as sort of a referee, but in the end we can all help to keep each other in check.” Jack smiled. “No single god, just a few of us working together for the good of the world.”
Then Cas flinched as he felt a sharp pain in his head. A new hot surge of emotion pierced through his mind accompanied by a rather unpleasant memory.
“I’m not sure. I just know that it’s out there. I can feel it.”
The empty chuckled. "Though, I do suppose that would have lessened the impact of your big exit. Way to go out with a bang. But, it is nice to leave him in the knowledge that your death.... was all his fault. Billie would have died on her own had he just left well enough alone, and you would still be alive. Go figure."
"Let's go. Sam and Jack are waiting for us back at home." Dean said, breathless, almost giddy with joy. And with that Dean threaded his fingers into Cas's, raising him from out of the dark.
Dean took another sip of the lukewarm coffee and put his head on the table. He was so tired, still recovering from the empty adventure more accurately just the anxiety of everything after.
He gave Dean a reassuring smile. "We'll get him back Dean."
Sam, Dean, and Jack all got in the Impala. The engine roared to life and started moving back down the road.
Dean Winchester was saved.
Something buzzed in Sam’s pocket. He reached in pulling out his phone and looking at it with wide eyes.
"That's what you want isn't it?" Dean said, the room tense.
Nothing happened.
Dean charged back towards the crowd, snatching them at the brink of fading into darkness.
"Yes, Dean?" He said, coming over. Dean pointed up, a mischievous look in his eye.
He looked around, then back at Sam and Dean and Jack.
Cas stood up. No no no, it was happening all over again. Dean flung his hand out, grabbing onto Cas's, holding tight.
He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out the Purgatory blade, resting in it's leather case.
“I LOVED YOU. I DID EVERYTHING FOR YOU AND FOR WHAT? SO YOU COULD THROW ME AWAY? SO I COULD BE CONVENIENT COLLATERAL FOR YOUR SCREWED UP NARRATIVE? I WAS DEVOTED! I WAS YOUR SON!” Hot angry tears streamed down his face. “BUT YOU DON’T EVEN CARE! YOU NEVER HAVE. I WAS TRAPPED, IN THE CAGE, FOR YEARS WITH NO ONE BUT ADAM AND NOW YOU TOOK HIM AWAY TOO!”
Sam breathed, nodding and smiling, barely containing his joy. "Honestly, I can't believe it." Sam looked out, grinning as he watched the kids attempt to play chicken in the sea. "I never expected for us to... get here. To make it..."
And as he began to scream again, it cut off. He choked as he felt through his entire body like he had broken his own voice, like a knife had been dragged through his vocal chords, ripping and shredding them to pieces while he just lay there, gasping and wheezing in an absence of voice.
Castiel mouth dropped open. He shook his head. Had it all been for nothing? Had god killed Dean?
Sam shook his head. “Not great. I think he blames himself for what happened, and Cas being… gone really hit him hard.”
The angels would take out their anger on him, and Castiel would let them, accepting any punishment they deemed for him, as a traitor to their kind.
“It's in there or very nearby.” He said, looking around at the place.
Chuck smiled, but the expression contained no amount of warmth.
"Just kidding, just kidding, I've got more.” Dean stood back up, a big grin on his face, waving down the audience. “You can close your mouth now, Sam." Sam's mouth snapped shut, everyone chuckling.
“We should go try and find Chuck.” He said over his shoulder, before leaving the room. Sam stared after him, concern for his brother written all over his face.
Dean cleared his throat, prepping to shout a little louder. "CAS!!"
Sam, Dean, and Jack whirled around at the sound of a new voice.
Cas put a hand over where Dean still held onto him. "It's been many years since then, Dean. My grace was just a small price to pay to get me back... actually, the fact that you rescued me at all... that was a bit of a surprise..."
"Mistletoe? Why are you......" His eyes widened, realizing the meaning just as Dean leaned in, planting a big, soft kiss on Cas's lips.
"So story time. Sam and Eileen are going on a date, right? And it's the big one. Yeah the proposal. So, Sam has the ring and he's nervous as hell, like sweating bullets, kept coming back beforehand to ask me for advice, and he kept taking out the ring and fidgeting with it, the idiot. Cause see, sometime during the night, he lost it..." there was a resounding 'ohhh' sound across the room, and Sam covered his face with his hands, embarrassed. Eileen just rubbed on his shoulders smiling with a knowing look.
Cas breathed, a sense of dread creeping over him. He felt a slight build up of pain and braced himself to be hit with another wave of painful memories.
Sam and Dean stood there, stunned.
Sam frowned but he nodded. No other choice.
“You sure about this Jack? Whatever you’re picking up on is in there?” Sam asked, looking up at the tall building.
They were at the bunker, Dean, Jack, Sam, Michael and Amara, all standing around the map table.
Wait, what was it that the empty had said? 'If you think hard enough'.... 'remarkably intuitive'.
Dean realized couldn't fight and protect Cas at the same time. He would have to use it. The bargaining chip.
"Oh I don't- I've never..." Cas looked at the dance floor, feeling suddenly intimidated.
God. Chuck.
“YOU. LEFT. ME. IN THE CAGE. WHEN YOU COULD’VE DONE SOMETHING ABOUT IT.”
Eileen sat on a towel, bathing in the sun. Jack, Little Bobby, Jess, and now two year old Henry splashed in the warm ocean waves, being followed and running after the happy dog, Miracle. Cas sat beside Dean, the two holding hands as Cas piled sand on top of himself.
Dean put his face hands and sighed. He then felt a hand on his shoulder and looked over to see Jack.
“Where you first met that primate you fell in love with? Funny how you would choose a filthy dirt eating monkey over your own brethren.”
“Is that the reaper?” Sam said standing up.
They sat in silence for a moment.
"Everyone?"
“Michael would grab a reaper, alerting you to our presence,” Sam continued. “You’d take out the reaper, and take Michael with you. And then it was easy, cause all we had to do was follow Jack’s nose back to you.”
"Yeah Dean," Sam nodded. "We did it..."
“His power.” Sam glanced at Jack. “You sure it won’t come back?”
It had become a sort of pattern. The empty would come, take out it's tired anger on enjoying watching Castiel suffer, then it would throw him into the black, where he would spend the rest of his time reliving his greatest regrets over and over again.
“I hate you.” He spat.
It would take many months before Castiel stopped having nightmares where black sludge would flood from everywhere, taking everything he loved and drowning him with it. It would take many months for him to not feel horribly uneasy in the dark. It might even take years for him to fully get over everything that had happened, maybe he'd never get over it.
“Alright,” Dean gave a short wave. “I’ll see you in a bit.”
“Why you gotta betray me, Michael? For them?”
“Can you do that again?” He asked. Jack looked at him and nodded slowly.
Dean came up behind Sam, who was sitting at a library table, nose deep in about four different books and what looked like a stack load of old notes.
His heart skipped. Dirty trench coat, worn expression, Cas.
Chuck looked at him and nodded. “Hmm. Glad that’s over.”
“Would it have been better had we done what we were told?” Sam absentmindedly asked.
Home Alone was watched and laughed at and confusedly being pointed out by Cas. the inaccuracies of the trap capabilities of an eight year old child.
“Daddy’s boy.” Dean smirked.
Black. Everything was drenched in darkness.
"Please..." He said quietly, but making no other protests, believing entirely that he deserved this.
“YOU LEFT ME!” Michael yelled. Chuck staggered back, a little stunned.
"Yes, we did happen to find a way to put the empty back to sleep. Rowena down in hell helped out of course, and Jack and Sam. And Michael too, actually it was mostly Adam convincing Michael but it worked out ok."
He came back in a moment, carrying a large knife, black, sharpened obsidian strapped to a bone.
"May I have this dance?" Dean smiled at Cas, offering a hand.
Wood?
But Dean rose with new vigor. Again he aimed to punch Chuck, but Chuck caught his arm. Dean screamed as the bone broke. Chuck sent a kick into Sam’s side. He lifted Sam by his coat, and pulling his arm back, he heard the shoulder crack. Dean cried out as Chuck stomped on his leg, the bone shattering. Blood streamed down their faces, and they coughed.
to the barn that had materialized around them. Castiel realized with horror that he could see it too.
It only took a moment. Like turning up the volume of a radio, the sound of people and movement seemed to fade back in. Sam and Deann looked all around them and there they were. People. Real living existing people.
"Now remember," Sam warned. "We just need to put the empty to sleep, not kill it. I think if we tried to kill it that would... horribly backfire on us."
"Stop it-"
Sam rose, a mild look of confusion on his face.
Dean smiled, relaxing.
They broke eventually, unrestrained smiles forming in both their faces.
“I hate that, Dean.”
“Yeah, no…” Chuck grinned at the brothers. “I appreciate the white flag and all but, too little too late. I’m kinda enjoying this story now.”
Dean and Sam turned. “What?”
“CAS, SAM!” Dean burst out.
-Dean'
“Well, don’t look at me, go ahead and answer it! ” Dean shooed Sam to pick up the call.
Dean twirled the empty whiskey bottle in his hands. “Any idea if there’s anybody in heaven or hell?”
There stood Jack, looking at Chuck, rage in his eyes. Chuck could sense it, the large, terrifying waves of power bleeding from the boy.
He eventually let go of Jack, turning down the hall and leaving with Sam out of the bunker.
"I got him."
Somewhere, far down the halls of the bunker, there was music.
"Purgatory." Dean said. "The first time. I spent a year wandering through that place lookin for you, you'd think a guy would know what love looks like." They sat in silence for a moment.
They had decided to go with a potluck style wedding dinner. Everyone got their plates and traveled down the long table of food, serving themselves whatever looked best.
Dean shrugged. “Too late.”
Bottle of whiskey in hand, Dean got up from his bed. He steadied himself against the wall of his room, making his way over to his dresser.
“Dean!” Dean looked over to see Sam holding up the phone again, beaming, a giant quite possibly ecstatic grin on his face. It was a text from Eileen. Dean grinned back, happy for his brother.
The cover glowed as she set the scythe against the table, opening the cover, and leafing through the pages. Her eyes skimmed the paper at a rapid pace, taking in the information with great speed. She looked up after a moment, her expression changed.
"I'll give it to you. You just have to give me Cas."
Sam, Dean, and Jack rolled up just in time to see white, shining, lines ripple over Michael’s body.
“Dean!” He called, making his way over to his brother’s side. “Hey, wake up!”
Castiel's eyes had rolled into the back of his head. Black swarmed around him and he was sinking.
"Huh..." Sam thought about that, nodding slowly. "....You know, if it's a girl we might name it Lillian, after the the hunter that took in Eileen,"
No no. He just needed to get through this. He couldn't fail now, not when he was so close. He didn't get to tell him. He just needed to tell him....
“Yeah…”
“HEY MICHAEL, JACK, AMARA! GET YOUR ASSES IN HERE!” He shouted.
“Can you get him back?”
Sam looked about, a little bewildered.
Castiel saw it coming and cried out as he felt a swift kick to his side. Uriel laughed and kicked him again.
"Stop. Just Stop it." The Empty laughed at Dean. Drips of inky black starting to stream from its eyes. Staining its pale skin in Castiel's form.
“Unbelievable.”
Michael paused. “I never spent much time on Earth. I was curious about the reception of God and Heaven.”
Sam turned back to Chuck. “Then I think it's the ending where you’re just like us. Like all the other humans you forgot about.”
“Do we have any other ideas to try and fix this?” Dean asked.
Both Michael and Amara raised their eyes at that.
"No," Sam slowly shook his head. "They just asked him, and he's teaching them."
They broke, Dean clutching at ex-angel's trench coat, Cas basically sitting on the table. Their shared breathing was quiet, heavy, in time with the pounding of their hearts.
The brothers found Jack standing at the map table holding a group of potted plants. Some looked like they'd been bought but most of them were just patches of grass, dug up and put into mugs.
Dean looked up into the mirror ahead of him.
With a large fist he threw a heavy swing at Sam, hitting his face. Dean tried to rush at Chuck, but Chuck smacked Dean with the back of his hand. He gripped the collar of Dean’s coat, head-butting him and tossing him backwards.
“Jack, we're gonna try and talk to Chuck.” The sniffling stopped. He was listening.
Sam stared at Dean, searching for any reason to go with him and seeing the terrified plea in Dean’s eyes.
Castiel's heart sank with terror. He clutched at Dean tighter, his breathing becoming ragged and panicky.
He hit them, again and again and again. Blood stained their clothes and their faces, matting in their hair.
“How's Jack doing?” Dean asked.
Dean wistfully smiled at him, reflecting that despite his power and wisdom beyond his years, Jack was still just a little kid.
The night started with a dance between Sam and Eileen, the sole people on the dance floor. The music was something of Irish sound, an idea from Eileen given her heritage. The dance was fast paced as they circled each other with step and stomp motion, Eileen twirling on Sam's arm. Sam had worried that Eileen wouldn't enjoy herself because she couldn't hear the music, but she assured him that despite that, she still enjoyed the dancing. Everyone standing at the sides clapped to the rhythm of the music and sometime after the second verse, they began to join in, linking arms and skipping across the floor, shoes stepping in time.
“Does it need to be a special item? I remember last time the one on the sub was a piece of the Arch of the Covenant, straight outta Indiana Jones.”
"Speaking of my death, you had a hand in that didn't you." Uriel removed his hand from Cas's mouth and it one quick motion, brought it down in a hard hit to the stomach.
They could just come back, so whatever ones he killed it wouldn't matter. They would just come back.
Betty narrowed her eyes at him, but she reopened the book. Dean and Michael shared a brief look, and Michael moved unnoticeably closer to Death’s new scythe.
Then it was gone.
__________________
Sam reached across the table, sliding the book towards the new Death. She reached out and took the book in one hand.
Zachariah, still smug faced with an added tinge of unhinged hatred.
Amara and Michael left, to sort out whatever the deal was with heaven Dean supposed.
“There’s something out there besides us.”
Jack sat up suddenly, a strange vibrant pulling at his soul.
Another was having betrayed Sam and Dean for Crowley and the souls in purgatory. Whatever he had been doing it for seemed so pointless now, and he had caused so many deaths because of it.
"I prefer the word oblivious..." Cas mused. “Less dumb…. less ass.” They both laughed, leaning on each other's foreheads.
"Deals have a habit of screwing us over." Dean growled. "Besides, the Empty is embodiment of nothing or whatever. What the hell would we even offer it in exchange for Cas?"
After a moment, Sam slowly raised a finger, stuttering for words.
“SCREW YOU! Screw. You. I really-… I really cared about something for once and you stole that. So maybe it is about Adam, I honestly have no idea. But I am siding with them because you? You ruined the world.”
He recognized this place.
“This kind of power doesn’t come easy. And yes, I see that you’re a nephilim,” Jack shifted uncomfortably. “But something must have happened to you to make your powers act this way.”
Crashed cars littered the streets when drivers had suddenly disappeared from existence.
Jack looked down the room to Michael, who was sitting at a library table and beckoned him over.
Dean sat stunned, floundering for words.
"Freedom at last." The Empty mused. "Freedom from... everyone."
Uriel threw his head back in laughter, either inferring Castiel's confusion from his expression or straight up plucking it from his mind.
She rolled her eyes. “Of course I’m sure, I’m Death.”
Dean raised his glass. "A toast to the happy couple," everyone else raised their glasses with him. "May you live long, and be happy doing so," the room cheered, and Dean turned to Eileen. "You take care of him, Eileen." Then he sat, applause erupting around the room.
Dean paused. "Does... he know anything about mini-golf?"
"Will do."
He wouldn't lose him. Just when he was so close, he couldn't lose him.
Michale calmly looked at the reaper and held up a hand.
“Poor bastard never caught a break.” Dean bowed his head in remorse.
"Dean, I told you not to let Miracle up on my bed!"
The full force came at him. He used the angel to blade to swipe and stab at everything around him, hoping to at least slow them down. Give him time to.... do what?
Michale and Amara nodded in agreement, wishing him luck as well.
Cas's breathing seemed to quicken as he finally looked up into Dean's face.
"We're just a couple of dumbasses aren't we?"
He didn’t notice as the small potted plant sitting by his bedside suddenly dwindled and died, turning brown in a matter of seconds.
Dean Winchester was saved.
This was it.
Dean breathed. It was quiet. Everything was quiet. He cradled Cas, sitting up.
That's when he felt the first stab. Something sharp pierced into his entire being and he shrieked, coiling up, trying to protect himself.
Until they got to the last few pews.
“Relax, I’m not giving him shotgun… Unless you’re cool with that.”
Jack nodded, signaling that he was coming. He stepped over the dead plants around him, a new sense of worry creeping up.
“Well, maybe that's the point.” He said quietly. Dean glanced at him but didn’t say anything, the same thought having crossed his mind.
“Guys?” Jack saw Sam and Dean. Sam was standing near one of the walls, while Dean sat at the table, open laptop in front of him, and looking like he’d been hit with a truck.
I don’t want you to know yet.
"Wake up, please..." Dean put a hand on Cas's face.
Now everything was drenched in darkness, and despite being secure in the knowledge that he had experienced true happiness just by saying it, Castiel couldn’t help but feel like he was drowning.
"I'm sorry..." Castiel whispered, his voice trembling. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm so so sorry, please forgive me, I'm sorry...."
“He better show up.” Dean grumbled, shivering slightly in the chilly air.
Two weeks. The sun was amazingly bright.
Lucifer showed up in a lot of them. Having said yes to him was really something that still bothered him immensely. Because of that one decision, he had caused many problems in the future, including Jack's death for the first time.
But yet he still felt all the heartbreak, misery, and cruel impact that came with hearing those words again.
He turned and looked at Jack.
“Having fun?”
Chuck scoffed. “So what, this is about your human pet now?”
"You know what, Sammy, you do you."
And why so much noise?
And for Castiel, he had expected that to be his last moment, perhaps the only moment of true happiness. Upwards and onwards into an eternity of darkness.
"Sleep."
Swim stuff and all that.
Dean gazed in amazement and relief as the frozen staggered angels around them melted into piles of black ooze.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Well, what do you suggest we name it?"
Cas was sinking!
The empty was laughing. Hysterical, unhinged cackling.
Everyone looked at Michael.
They stood in silence. Chuck raised his brows, looking up at the sky as though considering.
"A third one? Nice! Got any names yet?"
Cas stood at the edge of the floor, watching the people dance and being, himself, mostly content to just watch. Dean approached slowly from the side, just as the song turned to a slower tempo.
For once, everything was ok.
He looked between the three of them. “Tell me what you need me to do.”
“Hey,” He came up slowly behind Sam and tapped him lightly on the shoulder. “Sam, come on buddy, wake up.”
“Alright Michael. Here’s the book we’ve been telling you about.” Sam said.
“Don't give the Empty the hand until you find Cas. If you call to him, he should come to you.” Jack said. “And good luck.”
Sam groaned, pushing Miracle off his bed and rolled over, pulling his blankets to his chin.
"No, Cas, I'm not a trick. Everything's gonna be ok. We'll figure this out." Dean tried to assure him, but Cas looked behind Dean and shook, curling in and putting his arms out to protect himself.
“And Adam?” Sam asked.
Chuck chuckled. “Cute.”
"Where is he?" Dean growled.
"Oh.... that wasn't a nightmare? Did you actually do that Dean Winchester? You tossed him out, told him to leave, never come back, 'I'm sorry but your presence here is making the other angel uncomfortable, would you mind scooching over about half a mile away from me."
He placed the blade on the table in front of Michael, Amara, and Jack.
Pounding.
Chuck wheezed and choked, the golden lines burst from Jack’s eyes, trailing down his face, up his arms and into Chuck’s head. The gold flashed, momentarily getting brighter, then with a final surge of power Jack tossed Chuck to the side.
“Well sure.” Chuck shrugged. “I always do. Me being me.” He stepped closer. “So is this it or…?”
There they were, Sam and Dean, drinks in their hands, toes in the sand, dawning the Hawaiian print shirts, while sitting comfortably on a beach in Miami, Florida.
Amara nodded, a silent agreement passing between them to forget past mistakes and to make good on their actions in the future.
A little dazed, they looked at themselves, feeling something new within them.
Nothing to fight against anymore. Just the dark.
“You know what… I’m- I’m glad. I’m glad because now you get to suffer with me. I can make you regret…. I know just how to make you hurt… ha ha HA HA HA HAAHA…” The empty dissolved back into the black sludge it came from, its laughter echoing everywhere, intermixing with the distant cries.
“Who’da thought finding a dog would feel like a miracle.” He remarked to himself. Miracle, how appropriate. “Come on, Miracle.” He said, beckoning the dog with its new name. “Come here.”
“Hey guys!” Both Sam and Dean tensed, and turned to see him, Chuck, standing there with a large, overly confident grin plastered on his face. “Enjoying a little ‘Alone time’?”
Chuck looked up, confused. “What?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “I’m gonna go get Jack.”
“Cas….” He had said.
There was a muffled sound now, someone calling his name.
Dean nodded. “Chuck won’t be a problem anymore.”
"I have something to exchange!"
“Good boy! Believe it or not, you’re the best thing that's happened to us in the past few days.”
Dean huffed. “Me too kid. I need an aspirin.”
“It wasn’t Billie. It was Chuck.” He spoke, quietly, tone thick with emotion.
Michael took a deep breath. “I… will not be going with you.”
"We need you to make a hand of god." Dean said.
Sometimes, the empty would use that. It would appear as Dean, maybe just to hurt him more, to get a greater reaction. He could always tell it wasn't Dean though, something in the eyes and the way the empty smiled while wearing his face. It was so unnervingly un-Dean like it would often completely repulse him.
That was not Castiel.
(“Cas, listen buddy… um… you can’t stay.”)
A sudden thought struck Dean. An idea. What if Cas wasn't an angel? What if… Could he do that? No... Cas would never forgive him.
Miracle was gone.
He reached with his blade, slashing at the nearest one and the one that followed right after. They croaked, dissolving into inky black smoke.
Everyone migrated to a seat at one of the many tables, Sam and Eileen at the front most one, surrounded by their closest friends. After everyone had settled down, Dean stood up, tapping his glass with the side of a spoon, grabbing everyone's attention. He'd seen it done in a movie once.
Cas stuttered for words. "You-....... you're a hopeless romantic."
What stopped Dean from full on rushing to embrace the angel was something in the expression. It looked cold, bitter.
One of the demons grabbed his shoulder. He reached under his arm, stabbing it where the stomach should be. It dissipated but another arm reached out, grabbing Dean at the knee. He cried out, falling as the demon pulled his legs out from under him.
"You don't know, do you? He didn't tell you. He didn't tell you how he wasn't allowed to rest. How Naomi had given him the order to kill you and how he had fought with everything to avoid that. How he had tried to take the angel blade in his hand intending to plunge it into his own heart to save you."
It did subside eventually. The empty leaned over him still wearing his face.
They didn't hunt as much anymore. Only helping with things that other hunters couldn't handle, doing quick research if people needed it, and they were the ones to call if certain sheriffs needed confirmation from their 'FBI superiors'.
Sam crawled over to Dean, grabbing his arm and lifting themselves up, together.
"CAS!"
in two weeks.
“We’ll do our best.”
They turned, leaving him in the dirt.
“I have a theory.” He said. “But I’m not sure it’ll work.”
Cas reeled backwards, reminding himself over and over again that he was in the empty, not there, he was in the empty, that wasn’t happening now.
Chuck held out his hands. “Just stay down.” But they wouldn’t stop. They just kept coming, and he just kept hitting, but they would get right back up for him to hit back down all over again.
Sam furrowed his brow in confusion, the information new to him.
"Be careful with this." She handed it to Dean. "We have to use it as a bargaining chip, and it must not be prematurely used."
Dean stepped forward. “Have got it?”
A figure stood over him, black sludge dripping off his face and body.
He lifted his arms to his face trying to protect himself, waving his blade in every direction.
“W- wait, Wait!” Dean cried, the smile disappearing from his face. They all turned to him. Dean looked between Michael and Amara.
The shapes of black, shining, wings glittered for a moment as the last of the grace disappeared.
"I got him. Sammy." Dean exhaled.
Jack stood there, thinking for a moment. He then turned around facing Adam, who quickly switched back to Michael, and Amara. He reached out his hands. They both looked at Jack and hesitantly took them, not sure what to expect.
“That’s stupid. Anything could happen to you in there!”
By the look on Dean’s face, he immediately regretted sitting up so fast. He pressed a hand to his forehead, no doubt a headache coming on strong.
It smiled. “Sacrificing yourself for one human? You sure you made the right choice?”
Sam shivered, and though grumbling about it being too early or something, he sat up.
The reaper shrieked as the blade went through it, and Sam, Dean, and Jack all winced in response.
~[Roll credits]~
"Look," Dean started. "You have something that I want. I have something that you want. Why don't we just trade, both parties happy."
Dean's mouth went dry. The empty noticed.
He shook Dean lightly, Dean still quivering and gasping for breaths before he sat up in a set of quick, panicky motions.
The Earth was empty.
“See for yourself.” Sam dropped the book, cover open, in front of Chuck.
"Hey, we did it." Dean whispered onto Cas's shoulder. "We beat Chuck. He's gone, he's finally gone."
"Yet he would still scream and cry and beg not to kill you, but in the end he would be forced to feel the bones in your arm snap. To stab you in the heart again and again, never stopping until he got it right."
Castiel's body shook with sobs again. Dean leaned in closer, pressing a light kiss on the corner of Castiel's mouth.
As the time approached 10, Eileen reminded the kids that Santa would come soon and they should be in bed by the time he does.
"I'm sorry if... I made you uncomfortable... when we last spoke." Oh god. That was the last thing Dean wanted him to say. "And I'm basically human now so... I don't think I'll be much use to you anymore. I should.... I'll go..."
"Please, don't ever think for a second that you can't have me. I had always... I always wanted to.... things always got in the way and I never thought.... I never thought anyone could love me as much as you do. So don't ever believe that you're love was unrequited because it's not. I love you too, Cas."
Jack’s eyes glowed a bright brilliant gold and he threw up his hands, placing either one on the side of Chuck’s head.
“Why don’t we just use a reaper to open the book?”
“It made Jack unstoppable. All of it needed to beat you.”
Behind him, the portal emitted an orange glow, still crackling with its own energy, Jack on the other side no doubt keeping it open.
Why… wasn’t he asleep?
"We're rescuing you, you idiot. You'd think I'd get an opportunity to grip you tight and raise you from perdition and not take it??"
“Hey, Michael!”
When they were done, the glow faded and they took a step back to look at their handy work.
They came at Dean from all angles, murderous black eyes, claw-like fingers, horrible piercing angry shrieks. They pulled at him, tearing at his clothes, his hair, his limbs.
“Sammy!” He called. Sam was over by the gas pump, finishing up filling the Impala. “Check it out!”
“Yeah I get that. But you said in his deal the empty could only be summoned when he was really happy for once, and Billie was literally about to kill you. So what the hell made him happy?”
"Yeah, I bet they will, the little monsters. Where are they anyways?"
He lifted the dog into his arms.
The empty cocked its head, an eager glint in its eyes.
Michael was staring hard at the dead plant, something in his mind being to click.
“And no one remembers you. You’re just forgotten.”
Dean turned. “See, that’s not who I am. That's not who we are.” He gestured towards the rest of them.
"Cas," Dean spoke first. "... I never want you to think," Dean threaded his fingers through Cas's. "That you can't have me." Cas stared at their hands, seeming to short circuit. Dean bit his lip. "I'm yours for the taking... if you still want me."
“Besides,” Jack continued. “I don’t think I’m ready for that much power yet…”
He nodded, a smile spreading across his face. The familiar kind, the good kind.
Dean knew he wouldn't be gone for long but it would give him time.
Zachariah laughed. "What, like you actually care about him?"
Dean gently picked up Cas, holding him in his arms, and he carried him towards the portal.
They were interrupted however when they heard a crash by the kitchen doorway.
“Well…” Jack thought, racking his brain for anything that would apply. “I exploded in the Empty about a week ago.”
"Besides, I don't wanna scar your kids for life when they come barging into Ol' Uncle Dean's room while me and Cas are... well, you know."
Free to live and to keep on living.
He picked up his bathrobe from where it had been thrown the previous night and slung it over his shoulders. Reaching his dresser he opened the drawer and pulled out a pair of socks, intending to put them on.
He looked out, but didn’t see anything… at first.
(“Something always goes wrong.”
“I know, but what else do we have? I think we’ve officially lost, Sammy.”
“What kind of an ending is this?!” Chuck cried.
“What is it?” Dean and Sam looked at Michael expectantly.
Suddenly, Betty disappeared in a puff of black smoke and dust.
"Yeah it's me." He said, his voice shaking. Dean held out open arms, waiting for Cas to come closer, but not entirely sure what Cas would do. "Sorry it took us so long."
“So it is finished?” He asked.
“You're sure?” Sam asked, just checking.
Suddenly, the door to his room burst open, music playing at full volume and someone singing along with it very loudly and very off key.
“Come back, okay?” Jack said into Dean’s shoulder. Dean smiled.
Dress for sunny weather,
Dean turned back to Cas.
"What?" A wide, crooked smile curled up the empty's features. "Don't like hearing the horrors he experienced because of you?"
“I’m still kinda confused. What exactly happened, Dean?”
It huffed in what sounded like annoyance and rolled its eyes in a grand and exaggerated way.
The Empty rolled its eyes. "Have you looked around? I'm not the only one awake. EVERYONE is awake, thanks to that winged freak toddler in your possession when he blew up inside me! Is your ‘hand of god’ strong enough to take care of everyone?"
