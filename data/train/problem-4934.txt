“Yep,” the bartender said, rummaging around in the bottom fridge, “though we don’t get many requests for it at events like this.”
“Of course!” Tony said.  “Jacob Rabinowitz, this is Steve Rogers.  Steve, this is Jacob. He works for PharmaGo, but his real passion is sailing.”
Tony went back to work on the suit. Clint brought him donuts and badgered Tony to come drink with him. It was tempting—the blurry camaraderie of alcohol—but Tony wanted the clear, precise reassurance of engineering more.
Other than Sam and Rebecca, Tony hadn’t knelt with anybody—friend or lover—since . . . wow. Since Pep’s last visit? Maybe. It was nice.
It was strange; she looked so familiar, like someone he had seen around his neighborhood from time to time. But he was sure he’d have noticed such a high class lady in his area, so it was probably just a passing resemblance. (Or his exhausted mind playing tricks on him.)
When Tony wandered into the kitchen, he found Steve standing at the stove, spatula in hand, wearing a suit and tie. (Ah!) Tony’d forgotten it was Sunday.
Steve concentrated and this time the cockhead slid forward, his gag reflex kept in check. He felt full and dizzy and hot, the weight and pressure of it strange and foreign, but wildly exhilarating even as it cut off his air. (I did it!) His pulse sped and his hips twitched. Very carefully Steve eased it a little farther down his throat, then pulled back a little. He held the dildo there a moment, before pressing it down once more, just a little deeper, and holding it there again. But in a few seconds he could feel himself tensing unpleasantly and had to pull it out all the way. Steve took a deep gulping breath and another. He shivered. Then he tried to push the cock back down his throat.
Sitting on his neatly-made bed was a plain paper bag and an index card which said “a little more, as promised. . .” in Tony’s messy hand. Steve held his breath, heart speeding—he had a pretty good idea what it might be.
Saturday disappeared in a whirlwind of work for Stark Industries, urgent calls from Pepper, and trying very hard not to yell at anyone in R&D. By eight pm Tony was exhausted and just wanted to relax. Pepper was in Chicago, Rhodey was still abroad, Clint was out drinking with agents again, and, oddly enough, Bruce and Natasha were at the ballet. Tony had JARVIS call Steve with the usual offer of
Tony spun on his heel and found her, hand outstretched, expression too open for the Black Widow.  She looked like Natalie again.
“Steve,” Tony groaned, struggling to get more friction; he spread his legs wider and drew his knees up eagerly. “Please, fuck me, take me,
Rogers swallowed. “Well, I’ve intruded on your work long enough.” He summoned a smile, seeming to recover some of his previous good cheer, “Thank you for indulging me, Mr. Stark.”
Natasha had told him to act normal, so he’d tried. He went for his usual run. He went to the gym. He went to bed early. He loitered with a book near the coffee maker. (But surely that wouldn’t be
“So,” Clint said, “apparently there’s a new burger joint super close to the Tower. Supposed to be good. What do you say? Wanna go check it out? Grab burgers and beers?”
“So numb. All the time,” he whispered, chest going tight. “Before the battle, after the battle—like I was still in the ice.” He swallowed thickly. “You made me feel something. You made me so angry, but at least it was
Steve worried at the mark, raising the bruise to high color, then started another—a twin mark on the other side. Hot sharp prickles ran up and down Tony’s spine as Steve bit and sucked.
Steve blushed even more.  (Silly.)  Tony’s nice suit was stained and rumpled, his van dyke was in need of maintenance, and the dark circles under his eyes looked like bruises, but he was smiling one of his truly pleased smiles.
(He’d kinda thought Steve might bring them lunch—it was such a Steve thing to do—but this was fine too.)
At the place his neck met his shoulder right above the collar bone, Tony had a dark purple bruise where Steve had marked him. Tony caressed it with light fingers then pressed down, feeling a pleasant soreness. He closed the door tightly and raised the (far more flattering) bathroom lights a smide. Tony turned to look over his shoulder at his reflection. There were no bruises, not even speckling, on his back. It was disappointing, but he’d never bruised easily and floggers weren’t really designed for it anyway.
Tony landed and flipped up the faceplate, ready to pour out his apology (he’d practiced in his head the whole flight back), but before he could say anything--
Tony watched the team settle into friendly chatter.  Clint loaded the dishwasher.  Natasha got five of the big blue mugs down from the cupboard and laid them out on the counter.
dinner, or if he’d just been hoping to hook up, but it seemed even more cruel to ask about that, since Tony’d rejected him, what, four times?
“No, you’re right,” Pepper said with a thin smile.  “I’m sorry.  Of course—of course things have changed in the Tower.  I just—   Never mind.”  Pepper took a deep breath, visibly putting the ghosts of their past back in a drawer as best she could.
“I l—“  Steve swallowed, cutting himself off. “Just—you’re my special fella.  My sweetheart, you know?”
“Nope, sorry.  Got work to do for Stark Industries.”  He didn’t want to see Bruce’s disappointed face, so he turned and gave Rogers a little slap on the arm: “At ease, Captain.”
“Dummy, You-- get that crate open. JARVIS, start up Diagnostic 291-299. I want War Machine's latest specs and diagrams on screens one through three, and I want the Mark XI's on screens four to six. And, JARVIS? Gimmie the Stones. Loud.”
Tony kissed him harder, passionate, almost frantic. Steve’s cock was hard and leaking in his trousers. He groaned and returned Tony’s kisses urgently.
“Start serving yourselves, while Steve and I work on the turkey,” Mrs. Rhodes directed and they sprang into action. Tony started to eat a huge forkful of potatoes while Mrs. Rhodes’ back was turned, but when he caught sight of Natasha’s expression he set his fork back down as stealthily as possible.
contract.”  Tony laughed, trying to picture the look on One-Eye’s face when Rogers threw that his way.
Tony gave a last little thrust with his hips and held Steve’s head in place, then he cried out and flooded Steve’s mouth with cum.  Steve swallowed around Tony’s dick, thrilled by it all: the hot rush of come in his mouth; the sound of Tony’s orgasm; the sight of him shivering with aftershocks.   Steve caressed his sensitized cock gently with his tongue.
“Well, sure,” Steve said uncertainly, “I mean, yes, but I’m sure you have far more experience and--”
“A little harmless fun?” the Captain repeated blankly. There was a long pause—Tom could practically feel Rogers’ blood pressure rising as Dom smirked in silence.
“Mmm,” Tony murmured noncommittally. He tried to take a step away, but Belford tightened his hand on Tony’s arm. “We’re missing the party,” Tony said, “and now I’ve gotten some fresh air. We should really head back in.”
A chill ran down Tom’s spine at how calm and deadly Steve Rogers sounded—because it sure wasn’t Captain America speaking in that murderous whisper.
Standing in the antechamber to the Stark Industries’ auditorium (now holding a swarm of blood-sucking journalists), Tony checked himself in the mirror one last time: his Van Dyke was crisp and trim, his suit perfection. (And some well-applied concealer hid the dark circles from too much engineering and too little sleep.) Next to him Natasha pinned back a wayward curl.

“When we—” Steve made a vague gesture between them and tried again. “I’d never done that. With anybody.”
“So, hey,” Tony said, “now that we’re back in training mode, how about some more hand-to-hand work?  What do you say, Steve?”
“God, Tony,” he said harshly against Tony’s skin. “Sometimes I want you so badly—all of you, every way I can have you—it . . . it scares me.” Steve took a deep breath. “What if I lose control?”
It was strange: the reporters’ descriptions of Steve—earnest, forthright, humble, sincere, fair-minded, kind, generous —were no less than he deserved, but it left a bitter taste in Tony’s mouth. It was true of course: Steve was earnest and humble and generous and all of it, but they saw all that in Captain America. He was an icon, an emblem—they were never going to see anything else. Somehow it cheapened Steve’s utterly remarkable
“Good boy.”  Tony released Steve’s hip then leaned over to sooth the sharp little fingernail marks he’d left, kissing and licking the sensitive skin.  “I’ve got you,” Tony whispered.  And with that, Steve could feel everything sliding away.  (Tony’s in charge.  He’s got me.  Everything’s good.)  Steve’s arousal was still tight and heavy, but his muscles felt lax at the same time.  Tony would give him what he wanted—was giving him what he wanted, because he was doing what he wanted with Steve.  (Good, so good.)
“Yes, sir.” She hesitated, seeming to struggle for a moment, then added, “But, I think there might have been a mistake on the tip field. It was, uh—“
Rogers vaulted into the air and JARVIS, who apparently had a certain dramatic flair, made the zombies swarm into the space Rogers had just left. Tony learned then that “as high as he could jump” was pretty damn high for Rogers; luckily it was easy to readjust Iron Man’s flight pattern. Tony caught the shield smoothly, then pulled Rogers up into the side hold.  (Side hold.  See?  Not hug.)
Hope you liked the new chapter!  There's plenty more to come and comments are a delight as always.  Any favorite bits you'd like to let me know about?  :)
Tony slid carefully from under Steve’s arm, trying not to wake him. He had a quick piss and washed his hands. Away from the furnace of Steve’s body Tony quickly went from overheated to slightly chilled. The arc reactor cast a blue glow around Steve’s bathroom and lit his reflection in the mirror; the wan blue-grey light highlighted every crease and wrinkle at his brow, his eyes, his mouth. He looked old. Tony frowned and the lines went deeper.

gonna restrain the Hulk— Well. He was a genius, of course, but (as Bones would say) not a miracle worker.
Steve reached up, fumbling for Tony’s hand.  Tony laced their fingers together, happy to have something to hold on to, but Steve was urging Tony’s hand lower and slipping his fingers free.  He dragged Tony’s hand to his head.  Steve let go and Tony carded his fingers gently through Steve’s hair, petting him as he worked Tony’s dick.
It had been nice. Really nice. But somewhere in the back of his mind, Steve had kept thinking of Tony's mysterious present and he had to fight off a blush, a semi, and the urge to run off and satisfy his curiosity.
Tony raised his coffee cup, then paused as an equally ridiculous explanation for Steve’s absence shot through his mind: maybe Steve had found a submissive and was keeping his new girlfriend top secret—even from his team—so she wouldn’t be a target for violence or pestered by the press and that maybe
“But you can!” Steve blurted, then looked embarrassed.  “I mean, you’re not rushing me.  Not in the least.  And I’m really . . . eager.”  He dropped his voice, lowered his head, and looked up from under his lashes, adding, “For everything.”
After a moment the fury seemed to melt out of Steve, though, leaving him tired and sad.  “That’s really what you think of me?” he asked.  “That I’d, what? Use Tony and then toss him aside? That I don’t lo— care deeply about him?”
“I keep wanting to touch you,” Steve confessed quietly, “but I shouldn’t trouble you when you’re driving.”
“Well damn, Tony.”  Rhodey stared for a moment then broke out in a bright, wide, shit-eating grin.  “You lucky son of a bitch!”  He reached out to give Tony’s shoulder a rough slap.
(Yes! God, yes.  Please!)  Steve’s mind felt pleasantly cloudy, caught up in sensations: the almost-pain of Tony pulling his hair, the wet slide of the cock between his lips, its weight on his tongue, the musky smell of Tony’s sex.   But Steve realized distantly that what sounded like an order, was a question too, so he answered in his own way…
Steve checked his phone.  “I’ll leave you to it, gentlemen.  Natasha and Clint are back from SHIELD with an update.  And I’d like to show the retiarius to them and see if we can do some trial runs.”
“Then your priorities were out of line,” Steve said sternly.  “What they did--what they’ve been doing--is
“In light of the latest anomaly,” Bruce said, “I’m inclined to think it’s actually a combination of the two theories.”
were the water and you were holding me everywhere at once and nothing else could . . .” (Hurt me.  Matter.)  “—could get in.  Or something.”
He took a few deep calming breaths and fired the engine, forcing himself to concentrate on the road.  He was heading to the Tower on autopilot before he realized he wasn’t ready to go back yet.  He needed someplace quiet to think, so he could clear his head for a minute.  Not his space;
Steve reached for Tony’s hand then pulled him a little closer, giving him a little squeeze and a smile.
And Tony wasn’t even tempted to give Steve any incredulous snark, just answered, “No, Steve.  You didn’t hurt me.”
Tony stroked Steve’s face lightly with his fingertips, then reached back to tighten his fist in Steve’s hair.  Steve gasped and tilted his head back when Tony pulled.
“Well,” Rogers said, rocking back a bit on his heels and putting his hands in his pockets.  “I thought you might have missed breakfast.”  He gave a little shrug.
Again thank you so much for reading this story and for all the kind support you've given me.  Writing this and sharing it with you is such a treat!  :-)
Steve could see the tear tracks on Tony’s cheeks, but he didn’t care. (It was fine. Good.) Steve just knelt there, stroking Tony’s hair in a slow steady rhythm as Tony’s eyelids grew heavier and heavier until eventually sleep took him.
Tony squeezed Steve’s ass, gave a hard suck on his cock and Steve was gone, gone, gone. He arched off the bed, gasping and shuddering, coming far sooner than he’d meant to, suddenly and without warning.  And, oh god, he could feel Tony swallowing around him.
“Looking ‘dynamically sublime’ there, Nat,” Clint teased. She rolled her eyes and turned to Bruce who looked like he was somewhere between a meditation exercise and a nervous breakdown.
“Can you stay like that for me?” Tony asked softly.  Steve couldn’t answer, just held his knees where Tony had placed them.
And they stood, just smiling at each other in the huge kitchen for a few long moments, before Tony clapped his hands and said briskly, “So, here’s the plan.  I’m gonna go to bed right now and sleep for the next, oh, eleven hours.  Then I’ll get up, have a shower, get dressed and at 7:30, I’m taking you on a second date.  Good?”
“So,” Tony said, pulling Steve back into a closed hold.  “I have an idea. Of something I’d like to do for you. Or in your honor--sort of a Valentine’s day present, but really just more something I thought you might appreciate?”
“Wait,” Tony said, struck by a sudden realization, “Is this where you learned to make chicken parmesan?”
“Thank you,” Steve said, trying to reign in his temper. “Perhaps you could tell me more about the position now?”
Steve let out a little sigh, breath warm on Tony’s shoulder.  Tony concentrated on the warmth of Steve’s body, the rise and fall of his chest.  (He loves me.)   Maybe a little nap wouldn’t hurt.  Just for a few minutes.
Tony pulled his fingers away, dropping his hands to Steve’s shoulders as he asked, “What do you want, sweetheart?”
This chapter was a struggle!  I worry it’s too long and the pacing is off and it doesn’t do what I meant for it to, but, um, here it is!  And only a few hours after Steve’s birthday. ☺  Really hope you enjoy it!
As Steve stood, he pulled Tony to his feet with a gentle pressure on Tony’s wrists. Then—once they were both standing—slowly, fluidly, Steve pulled Tony’s arms above his head and pinned his wrists to the wall. Tony’s heart leapt.
They both stared at Tony-- frozen--but Clint recovered fast.  He gave an awkward little laugh and said, “Uh…. welcome back?”
Tony was just considering fetching his phone to look up some of the poems for Steve to read to him, when Steve whispered in his ear:
“Nah, nothing wrong with your cooking,” Tony said, trying not to sound peevish. “But whatever. Anyway, I was headed to the workshop. Later!”
“I hear they’re all a buncha swells,” Steve said consideringly, then added, “but this one don’t seem so bad.”
"We're sending an ambassador and entourage to Manottan next week," Phillips continued.  "We're hoping to establish an alliance and treat for some Stark weapons to defend Eire. Ideally, we might even be able to leave a small embassy."
Tony gasped.  He came, shooting his come across the sheets and spattering the back of Steve’s thigh and ass.  Tony shuddered, face pressed against Steve’s sweat slicked thigh.  (Beautiful . . . perfect . . . oh fuck!)  Tony felt flushed and warm.  The moments slipped by as Tony tried to catch his breath.
Steve leaned in to kiss his cheek and said, voice rough, “I want you to kneel beside your bed and wait for me.  Will you do that for me, sweetheart?”
Rhodey smiled and chucked as Tony gave a humorously overblown account of their battle worthy of Thor at his most rhapsodic. And as Tony spoke, Steve let his hand creep across the couch cushion, millimeter by millimeter. He caressed Tony's hand tentatively with his fingers, unsure. Tony slid his hand over Steve's and laced their fingers together. Steve's heart pounded, but giddy not distressed.
Tony fisted Steve’s hair and pulled him away.  (No!  What--?)  Tony rose up on his knees, then pulled Steve back onto his dick.  (Oh, good. . .)  From this position, Tony could now thrust his hips, driving his cock into Steve’s eager mouth, holding his head in place with both hands.  It was a little awkward—Steve’s muscles were tensed to hold him at the strange angle and he might have lost his balance without Tony’s firm grip.  (Tony’s holding me up . . .)
“Stark,” Fury said as he entered.  “Fancy seeing you here on time.  Do we have the Captain to thank for that?”
!”  Steve was slower, more deliberate, gentler in his answering, “I know,” “It’s okay; we’re ok,” “I’ve got you,” “I love you, Tony.”
“You know I always sit this one out. Thanksgiving, New Year’s, whatever else, I’m down. I’ll even do Easter!”
(Yeah, don't interrupt. The country needs War Machine and Tony needs to feel like Rhodey will be safe. You can drop by with lunch tomorrow, Rogers.)
“And I can make mine,” Bruce said calmly. He let Tony go and stepped away. “I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”
Pepper fell silent.  Steve, his eyes bright and face flushed, came bounding out of the elevator with a luminous smile.  (Seriously, brain?
“I wish to God I’d banged my head hard enough to black out when the plane hit, but I didn’t. I just felt sick and disoriented after, my ears ringing and my sight all blurry.”
Katie looked relieved and perhaps a little grateful. She pushed her hair back and continued: “Now, as I was saying, we’ll wait on interviews, but a few photographs of you in the hospital might be wise to . . .”
“Oh God, come here,” Tony moaned, pulling at Steve’s hair.  Steve scrambled onto the bed, graceless in his haste.
“Hey, Steve!” Tony called, feeling weirdly nervous. It’s not like Steve would be able to look at him and know he’d been browsing five figure cufflinks.
Thank you so much for the kudos and kind words!  Please accept another,  longer chapter as a token of my gratitude.  :-)
“Ms. Ahmadi confirms your reservation for dinner and has marked a parking place for you behind the restaurant.”
Clint went to bed the moment “To Catch a King” ended, while Bruce lingered a little, exchanging pleasant ‘good nights’ before turning in. Natasha was still curled in the armchair, knitting. Tony poured himself a small glass of scotch then reached for his tablet.
“How about food?” Steve asked, as he poured the coffee and laid a hand lightly on Tony’s back. “Maybe some pancakes? You mentioned liking them with blueberries . . .”
“I—“ Steve hesitated and Tony couldn’t tell if his expression were embarrassed or guilty, but after a few moments he sank back down to the couch.
Tony rubbed at his eyes.  All nighters were also a little harder to manage after a five day marathon.  (Fucking Stark phones . . .)  Tony dragged himself over to the coffeemaker, the one he’d raided from the common kitchen almost two years ago.  It sounded a little like Darth Vader while brewing, but he’d gotten sentimental about the damn thing and still hadn’t replaced it.  Dummy chirped at his side while Tony waited impatiently for his caffeine then eagerly burned his tongue.  (Worth it.)
(And, okay, it was probably projection, but maybe Tony wasn’t the only person who got kinda bummed when his fellow singleton friends started pairing off…)
“I think it would be good for you,” Tony said gently, then almost winced. (Ugh. That came out all wrong. Patronizing and just . . . ew.)
“Agreed. I’m very glad to make her acquaintance,” Steve said, the formality of his diction an odd match to the earnestness and warmth of his tone. “I’m glad she and Jim could come visit.”
Steve smiled and chuckled through “Trouble with Tribbles,” and they were barely five minutes into “Shore Leave” when Clint arrived.
“Please,” Tony said, head dropping down to the side. Steve was still stroking the back of his hand. It was terribly distracting when Tony was trying to make plans: what sort of contract to offer (maybe just set out the firm limits?) and how best to frame his invitation to
“Oh my God, Alex!” Tony exclaimed. (They’d fucked on and off back in grad school.)  “It’s been ages! How’ve you been?”
Tony’d washed Steve off with his favorite louffa—exchanging wet, soapy caresses, more affectionate than cleansing—and now Tony was eager to get things moving along in a more sex-wards direction.
Tony could hear loud, heavy footfalls approaching the stairwell—a hand jostled the doorknob. Tony considered dashing up the stairs so Steve wouldn’t see him upset, but maybe it would be okay—he could just say it was the sewing machine, or a bad day, or that this time some youtube comments got to him and maybe
Tony scooted over and patted the spot next to him on the bed. He was sitting up against the headboard. (Really it wasn’t that different from sitting on the floor.)
Tony looked up, startled.  A man towered in the doorway, 6'2" at least, with broad shoulders and bulging muscles, blond hair, blue eyes, and a cream complexion so flawless it was almost fucking
“Thank God for that!”  Pepper smiled, then hesitated again.  “I’m still coming to New York for the Firefighter’s gala, so I thought I’d come visit.”
By midnight, Tony was exhausted in a way coffee and naps on his shop cot couldn’t cure.  (Well, unless they had to, but new body armor wasn’t that urgent right now…)
Steve took a deep breath and concentrated.  He tried to relax his throat again, wanting to stay open, to feel Tony inside him.
Tony shrugged and pressed his face closer into her thigh, feeling loose and unconcerned by it all.  The praise made him blush, but it was just Pepper so he didn’t mind.
.  But apparently Pepper had a read on the committee, especially their founder and CEO Jacob Lang, and, well—things would probably go more smoothly without Tony there.
Anticipation, nerves, eagerness, arousal—it was all swirling around in the pit of Steve’s stomach, making his breathing a little rough as he waited for Tony, losing track of time.  He focused on being still for Tony, the feel of being on his knees, the carpet against his skin, the heavy ache of his cock.
At some point, Tony made his way to the couch and sat watching the team. (His team.) Pepper was flailing around (or maybe trying to dance with?) Natasha who was holding a nearly empty bottle of vodka, looking perfectly poised and sober. Clint was showing an owlish-looking Bruce how to make some fancy cocktail, lecturing loudly in slightly slurred tones about the proper use of egg whites. And Rhodey, well, Rhodey was trying to teach Steve how to moonwalk. It was not going well. Rhodey was far from smooth under the influence, and though Steve was making a game attempt, he was horribly stiff-limbed. (But he was so graceful in the training room . . . ) Steve glanced over at Tony; his ears turned pink.
“This 77 bolt is getting worn down, huh, Dummy?  Let’s just replace that, shall we?”  Tony grabbed a fresh screw.  “See?  Shiny and new.”
Steve’s stomach lurched and his attention snapped back to the Avengers on the couch: Clint’s mouth was hanging open; Bruce was grinning at him; Thor looked wildly hopeful but uncertain; and Natasha’s lips had twitched up just slightly and was there perhaps a soft look in her eyes?
Tony tried not to roll his eyes.  Really it was a good thing that Bruce had pounced on him after his first cup of coffee, eager to work on the Security Blanket. Again.  (Constantly. Obsessively.) It kept Tony from fretting.  (Constantly. Obsessively. About St—)
“Well, that’s all fine for Nat. You gave me sleeves!” Clint bitched without venom. “I told you bare arms!”
“Seriously, Steve, you should come help me with these eggs,” Tony said, tone his usual brazenness but volume a little lowered. “I mean, what if I get eggshells in there? Are eggshells poisonous? See? I don’t even know these things!”
Judging from her first response, Pepper was well and truly over him, right?  (Which is good.  Really.)  Pepper just wasn’t happy about
“Okay,” Bruce said, gazing into his teacup. He looked up, sad-eyed. “Tony? I didn’t mean to imply—I mean, I know how hard you’ve been working on all of this for me and—“
The team nodded and made their way out of the (bland, colorless) conference room to head for the (deplorable, depressing) cafeteria.
, in fact), but he could at least try and prevent Tony from starving himself.  Besides, cooking for Tony felt almost like spending time with him.
Tony let out a disgusted noise and shook his head, then flopped back down onto the couch. “They may have gotten an extra ten minutes of screen time in the new movies, but it was at the expense of their fucking dignity.”
.) Tony bit his lip. (Steve went to Mass alone all the time, but was it depressing on Christmas Eve? Should he maybe offer to go too?) Tony grimaced. (Ugh.)
“What the fuck, man!?” Clint yelled, giving Cap a shove for good measure. “You thought I knew about that shit? What the hell!?”
“With a thirty pound turkey?” Mrs. Rhodes said incredulously. “I don’t think much of anybody has experience with that. But we can calculate it, I’m sure. Now, Bruce, you were going to make the green beans, right? And a green salad?”
“It’s an honor, Captain. Truly. You should have seen my face when the network told me that you were going to give me your first solo interview.” Colbert clasps his hands and looks up to the ceiling, whispering, “Thank you Saint Theresa! I knew you were listening. Miracles are real.”
“Oh, shoot!” Rogers said fussing at it even more and turning about looking for a mirror. Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony collected his oddly assorted packages from under the tree. As he did so, he caught sight of the little rocking horse ornament once more. He smiled and fiddled absently with the bows he’d
She turned and poured herself another cup of coffee and added,  “Act normal. He’ll come to us when he’s ready.”
“It’s just, I thought that—“ Cap began, his tone an entreaty, but he cut himself off abruptly. He shook his head. “Sorry. I came to apologize, not make excuses.” He looked away. “And, I wanted to say: it won’t happen again.”
“So,” Pepper said, filling the carafe with water. “What brings you to my doorstep in the middle of the night, unannounced?”
“Yeah, sure,” Tony said, following Rogers out of the break room.  (The door was already open).  As they walked side-by-side down the corridor, Tony tried to put the fucking SHIELD Doms from his mind.  (Orientationist asshole sack of shit dickface moron
“Then, here I was in 2010 and suddenly it’s okay to want another man and . . .”  Steve smiled a little and seemed to breathe easier.  “I guess, the more I thought about it, the more I realized I’m still
than with the guy who wanted to pull out his chair and make him eggs, but who ever said Tony made sense?  Maybe it was because, for all their complicated past, Tony felt like he knew what Natasha wanted from him now.  Rogers?  Not so much.
From the sound of her voice, Tony could picture her vividly: the tip of her nose turning pink, unshed tears in her eyes, and trembling lower lip.
“I didn’t mean it,” Tony said, taking a step closer. “I shouldn’t have said that. Any of it.  I didn’t mean it.”
Tony sighed (hoping it sounded defeated) then looped a leg through Clint’s and used the shoulder lift Natasha’d showed him.
“And Buck was always making plans, from the time we were little. We were gonna go West to California and strike gold. We’d get a flat together; I’d draw for the newspapers and he’d work in construction. Or he’d go into fighting, like his dad, and win a real big fight with tons of money and we’d be set for good. Or we’d open a gin joint together and live above it. But it was always--he’d say, ‘you and me, Stevie, ‘til the end of the line.’” Steve swallowed heavily. “I always reckoned I’d go out young, wouldn’t have to face things without him. Even with a war on, even once I had the serum—it seemed impossible that he'd . . . . He was just so strong, larger than life, and--” Steve squeezed his eyes shut and took a few deep breaths.
“Sure!” Dom said, “Let’s go a few rounds—see how those magic potion muscles stack up against a guy who’s
Tony nodded. “I’m fine. I appreciate the concern,” Tony added. (He even managed not to sound grudging.) “But I’m fine, and I had it handled, okay? I can take care of myself.”
Tony frowned at the patterns for the Agents’ body armor. Sure, Clint needed the full range of motion in his arms, but did they have to be completely bare?   It was a wonder those guns weren’t a mess of scars if this was how SHIELD equipped him. Tony shook his head.
“Oh! Right,” Tony said, waving a hand and heading for the coffee maker. “Sure, we’ve got plenty of time before we meet with Katie and—“
“Well, you never came up to the canteen for lunch, so I thought you could use a snack.” He nodded to the donut bag.
“It’s beautiful,” Rogers said, looking around the living room.  Light flooded in through floor to ceiling windows that offered an impressive view of the Brooklyn Bridge.
“Huh?” Bruce looked back up from his schematic. He pushed his glasses into place. “Yeah. Sure. And Tony? Thanks. Thanks for working on this.”

Tony was working on the Iron Man suit again when Rogers showed up. He hovered in the doorway, wearing his terrible dockers and rubbing the back of his neck with one big hand.
Thank you all so much for your patience support and enthusiasm.  I’m blown away by my readers.  As ever, I love hearing from you.  THANK YOU and I hope to have more soon….
Tony fisted Steve’s hair and made Steve shudder, pleasure coursing through him.  His orgasm, Tony’s coarse words, the fist in his hair, the cock in his mouth—everything loose and warm and floating.  (Yes, Tony, yes!)
Steve shrugged.  “Maybe.  We haven’t been called out as much lately, and, I mean, some free time is nice, I’m just not used to this much of it.  I’ve been drawing quite a bit, but that seems--” (-- selfish.)  “Maybe I could do more training for them, actually work with a class from start to finish.  There are plenty of things I still need to learn too.  I don’t know.  Just feels odd to be at loose ends so much when there are so many things I’d like to do and so many ways I could be helping.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, looking bashful. He glanced over at Tony with that shy smile and added, “I’m a little surprised myself.”
Thank you so much for all your love and support.  I'm home for Christmas with my family, which for me means thinking a lot about love and gratitude.  I'm grateful for you, for giving me the opportunity to share my writing and for helping me to think deeply about social justice, gender, and sexuality.  This story has brought me through some rough times.  Thank you for every kudo, comment, and just plain reading the darn thing.
Harris was lurking outside the conference room.  He gave a tentative smile and said, “Mr. Stark, sorry about earlier.”  He took a step like he might follow Tony down the hall.  “But I’d really--”
Obedient to Pepper’s sensible advice (for once), Tony took a few deep breaths. She gave him a sweet smile.
at wrapping presents and writing cards, so, uh, no—this, not really my thing. Uh. I just gave Steve a ride.”
As Tony closed in on the ranch, he saw a long figure standing outside, gazing up at the sky. He assumed it was Steve.
Tony’d figured that Steve would want to do their first scene at his place—they were already there, after all, and he’d mentioned
“Sure.”  Tony didn’t bother frosting a glass, but took a moment to fix himself a scotch with a few drops of water, just a small one.  (See?  I can totally do moderation!  War Machine needs repairs.  And upgrades.  Safety upgrades.  And failsafes.  And--)
whiney.)  Tony gave Rhodey an exaggerated leer then added, “And by ‘dodging’ I mean--”  He waggled his eyebrows and Rhodey chuckled.
“Absolutely,” Tony answered with a smile and a nod.  He kissed Steve’s palm, but Steve bit his lip, brow still creased.
Tony stopped short when he looked up.  Rogers’ expression had shuttered, brow a painful little crease; he turned to look at the spectrometer.  (Or just wanted to turn away.)  Tony frowned.  (Shit.)  Tony turned back to the diagnostic, checked the equation one last time, then hit ‘run.’  He picked up his coffee and came to stand closer to Rogers.  (But not too close, not close enough he’d have to look up at him. Not close enough their height difference would be more obvious.)
She took a step closer.  Her expression was sad as she added, “You probably won’t believe this either, but your orientation played no roll in my evaluation.”
of them unleash mutant animals and destructive robots on the metropolis.) Meanwhile Meredith’s son and his husband were planning to buy a condo, but were having trouble finding one with near a space for gardening.
“Why am I not surprised,” Fury said, one eyebrow raised, though he didn’t sound terribly upset about it.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said with a shrug. He rolled out his shoulders and stretched, then headed to the elevator. “No need for the hard sell. You had me at pizza.”
“I think I need a break from this reading. I was considering sketching for a while and I was wondering—would you mind if I drew the workshop? Or maybe did a sketch of one of your robots?”
“There,” Tony said, leaning up for another kiss once they handed over their coats.  “That wasn’t so bad was it?”
“Uh, sure,” Steve said. He was frowning, but it looked more pensive than distressed. Tony forced himself to wait. His heart was speeding.
“Sure thing,” Tony said and hurried into his seat before Rogers could pull it out for him.  (Ha! Victory!)  “So, what’s up?”
Pepper gasped, mouth dropping open in shock for a moment, before she grinned and reached across the table.
called. The junk press (TMZ, the Star, People Magazine, US Weekly, Fox News…)wrote (or implied) hideous trash about him all the time—“tops from the bottom”; “cheating slut”; “liberatioNazi”; “gets fucked by robots,” etc. Pep and Rhodey didn’t usually call him about that though, did they?
Even this far from subspace, Steve’s words gave Tony a warm thrill; Tony stopped his mouth with a kiss.  The room was quiet as they traded long, slow, lazy kisses.  Tony’s body was loose and warm, content like a cat in front of a fire.  Time trickled by slowly.
Tony leaned up for a kiss and Steve obliged him, a soft slide of tongue just the way Tony liked it when he was loose and lax. On and on, warm and soft, until he slumped back into his pillow.
“-- many a break-up,” he concluded with a shrug. Steve was tempted to ask Bruce to repeat himself, but a combination of embarrassment and the desire
“I thought he was Captain Self-Righteous Rogers, Pain in the Ass, which was the only good thing about him?”
I'm SO HAPPY to finally be back!  At last, I carved out time for P&P and managed to get around all the stuff that made this chapter tricky to write.  I really hope it worked!  By now you are very familiar with my addiction to knowing which lines or bits you liked best and reading any ramblings or curiosities you might have in response.  (I may answer slowly, but I truly do love it!) Nothing feeds the muse like your kind words. I really wouldn't have been able to keep this up for nearly four years without you.
“Morning!” Clint said. He gave a jaw-cracking yawn and took a seat. “Tony, man, you know I love your creations, but not when they come from a kitchen—so I’ll have whatever Steve cooked.”
Talk.” Then Rhodey added with clear exasperation, “And for God’s sake, Tony, let the man use your first name!”
Once a full week had gone by with no sign of Tony, Steve couldn’t wait any longer. He was sorely tempted to launch a full scale assault on the workshop. But the fact he’d used martial metaphors for the idea suggested it was the wrong approach.
Clint was off on a good rant, all hyperbole and silliness, that had Bruce and Natasha chuckling, but Tony—
—just to hold your hand or have your head on my shoulder. When you’d curl up next to Pepper or Rhodey, I’d wish it was me. I’d stopped hoping, but I, I still wished . . .”
Tony took a long deep breath and sip of coffee. (Where did that come from?) Mmm. Hot and bitter the way he liked it when he was vexed.
Steve’s fingers caressed his neck then tipped his chin up as Steve leaned awkwardly down for a kiss.  Tony knelt up to meet him and parted his lips eagerly, inviting more. Steve let out a little noise and pressed into Tony’s mouth, drawing him closer, hands roaming Tony’s body with new urgency.
“I’ll be right back,” Bruce said. “And I’ll grab some hummus and veggies. Would you look over my work on number 27?”
Tony took a seat as far away from Rogers as possible and glued his eyes to his phone.  He tried to answer a few emails from Pepper and Isaac, but his concentration was shot to hell.
” Rogers said seriously.  “It's a landmark case.  I read about it, and the StarkSafe (TM) when I was--” Rogers hesitated, “--catching up.”
“Tony, please,” Bruce said quietly, “Let’s just—” He turned back to Fury.  “The Avengers’ Initiative?”
“Okay,” Steve said pensively.  He drank some more of his beer and nibbled a few more bites of his (totally boring pepperoni) pizza.
It is hard to write in These Dark Times, but I'm trying very hard to finish this story in the next few months.  This story means the world to me and I want to see it through.  Your kind words and support are extremely appreciated! I am so grateful for your kindness and understanding.
Tony’s hand pressed heavily against his throat for a few long moments before moving to push down on his left shoulder, encouraging Steve to shift his weight off his neck.  (Better.)  Tony stroked Steve’s hair, scratching lightly at his scalp.
Then his face went serious again. He kissed Tony on the forehead and said, “But you’re perfect for me.” Tony didn’t know what to say to that so he didn’t say anything.
“The Captain wished to bring you coffee. This seemed a reasonable variant on Protocol 387-J12, however, on finding you asleep he had no wish to wake you. The additional presence of the small electronic device with which he returned still seemed in compliance with Protocol 387-J12 and was therefore permitted.”
Steve paced so quickly he was almost running, starting at one end of his far-too-large living room, rushing to the end, and then ricocheting away again.
Tony pictured it again (Beautiful, so beautiful . . .): Steve helpless and thrashing, perfectly able to break free but held in place by Tony’s will and his desire to obey.  Tony frowned.  (Oh fuck.  Maybe that was it?)
Thanks so much for joining me, everybody!  I hope you liked it!  Since I continually find myself tempted to write really rambling author’s notes and since several of you who don’t have AO3 accounts have asked about my update schedule, I’ve now made a tumblr.  Yay!  On it you will find thoughts about this AU, updates on its progress, occasional anecdotes about me, RL liberationism, BDSM, and some funny stuff as well. I’d be delighted to have you join me.  I’m http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/  Hope to see you there!
They lingered in the living room, Tony on his knees on the plush carpet and the decadent pillow (the one Steve had selected and arranged on the floor for him).  Eventually Steve broke the lazy silence.
“But, he’s probably busy,” Bruce added a moment later.  “Especially if there's a power struggle with Fury like you said.”
“Yeah, that’s good.”  The tip of Tony’s tongue poked out between his teeth as he affixed the K-52’s.  “I mean, I could set up a frame to hold them, but this is a lot faster.  And you’re more trustworthy than DUM-E.”
Rhodey cleared his throat and Tony recognized it for what it was: a hearty “is that enough talking about feelings and interpersonal shit? Please?”
Steve shrugged. “At least it looks like he's eating and drinking. Er, just water and coffee. So that's good.”
“I’m down,” Clint called, then added with a glare at her, “But you’re not picking. You always pick the movies.”
“I am sorry to wake you, Sir, but my Self-Harm Protocol has been triggered.” JARVIS’s tone was apologetic. “As you are not the trigger, I have no directives on whom to contact.”
“Anyway, the attack passed—they always did eventually—but I’d given Bucky a good scare. He asked Father Gabe if he could stay and sit with me instead of going on to Mrs. O’Connors. Mom said, okay, so Buck stayed. We played checkers. I showed him some of my drawings.” Steve smiled, his expression distant.
It was cold outside, even wearing a thick sweater. He really should have gotten a jacket. JARVIS flipped on the heat lamps without asking. Tony shivered and leaned against the railing as he looked out at the New York skyline. His breath misted in the chill air.
They’d eaten dinner together quietly. Tony suspected there might still have been left over pizza, but he wasn’t going to complain about the heaping bowl of (much healthier) pasta with chicken and vegetables in a light lemon pepper sauce Steve brought. (Steve had probably been talking to Bruce about Tony’s vegetable consumption. Or Clint had eaten all the pizza. Again. Whatever.)
“Father Gabe gave us each a little St. George medallion before we left for Basic Training and we wrote to him from France,” Steve said, tone wistful. He gave a little shrug.
“Tony!” Rhodey barked through his rant. “Jesus! I’m sorry, okay? I was only teasing. I didn’t mean anything by it.”
—but lots of subs were more comfortable in their own space, so maybe Steve was trying to reassure him? (Not that Tony cared one way or the other, but it was the thought that counted . . .)
(God damn it! You’re not allowed to have an Awkward Morning After with the boyfriend you love who just gave you his--socially constructed--virginity!)
Steve enjoyed spending time with Rhodey. They'd watched the game on Tony's massive television, chatting amicably about nothing of consequence while the commercials flickered past on mute. Clint joined them half-way through and they'd ordered pizza, real New York pizza Rhodey'd been craving while stationed abroad. Tony didn't come up-- not that anyone was surprised-- and Rhodey insisted on being the one to take pizza down to the workshop, though it was awkward for him with his crutch.
“Sort of,” Tony said, running a hand through his now-messy hair. “Well, he asked me first ages ago, but then I kept saying no and he apologized and stopped asking, so I figured I’d better say something since I really want to.” Tony swallowed. “To go on a date with him.”
understand it—but it’s beautiful.  There’s something aesthetically pleasing about the design. You wouldn’t know this, but I once wanted to be an artist, so sometimes I think I see things with an artist’s eye instead of just a soldier’s.”
“Thing of beauty,” Tony said with a grin, looking at their franken-device with relief. “Look-- you get started on another in case this one goes to shit. I’m with you, 79 looks best, but it still might turn out to be 33 in the end.”
Steve’s ears went pink and his pupils dark with pleasure. He cupped Tony’s cheek in one large hand and leaned in for a kiss, a soft, gentle press of lips before he started to withdraw. But then, almost as if he couldn’t help himself, Steve was pressing forward again, lips parting and tongue coaxing; his fingers dug into Tony’s hair, holding him firmly. Tony parted his lips with a little moan and welcomed Steve in as the little kiss turned slick and urgent and hard.
“Oh please,” Tony said with a little huff. He grabbed a plate and turned to the counter. “You brave enough to eat food I’ve
“Look, Tony,” Clint said. “I know I was surprised at breakfast. About you and Steve. Just, I hope you know it’s not that I think anything . . . bad.” (Huh?) Clint added falteringly, “About you.”
Tony parted his lips in a contented sigh and Steve nipped at his lower lip before pressing in a little with his tongue. Tony’s heart started picking up the pace. He was sorely tempted to deepen the kiss himself, but now more than ever he wanted to let Steve lead, even in the little things.
Training in the snowy Wyoming fields of Tony’s ranch rapidly became a high powered, high tech snowball fight. One that was started (much to his surprise) by Natasha and soon picked up (to his even greater surprise), not by Clint, but by Bruce. Tony hesitated for a minute—(Steve hates the cold)—but when Bruce lobbed a snowball at Iron Man with a grin he concluded resistance was futile. (Really, anything to put Bruce more at ease.) Apparently Steve decided the same thing and Clint soon followed suit.
“After what seems like forever—because you’d still be old fashioned, even if you were born in the 90’s—you invite me up to your place. It’s this tiny little walk up with squeaky stairs, but I love it and I’m so desperate for you to make love to me I’m begging you as soon as the door’s shut.”
“You can hold onto the ropes if you like,” Steve said as he pulled a little more and secured the ropes to the top beam with a careful loop tie. Tony nodded, but made no move to do it.  Not yet.  (He liked the pressure on his wrists.)
Tony pushed his dick into Steve’s mouth, with fast, shallow thrusts.  He bumped the back of Steve’s throat, again and again, but didn’t push inside, didn’t choke him.  Steve was so relaxed, it took him a moment to realize that he hadn’t even gagged.  Everything felt good.  The filthy-wet sound of cocksucking was loud in Steve’s ears; he sucked harder and let out a muffled moan.
“Hello, Mr. Stark,” Rogers said politely.  Tony startled.  Rogers had somehow appeared silently at Tony’s side while he scowled at the coffee machine.  Seriously, the guy was almost as quiet as Natasha, which was simply unfair.  Rogers poured some coffee in a to-go cup, then asked, “Would you like some coffee?”
Tony was still struggling with how to begin, when Rogers gave him an out and (like a coward) he took it.
“Yeah,” Steve said with a sad little smile. “We met when I was eight. He was my first friend, at least my first friend my own age.”
“Just want my coffee,” Tony said with a yawn. He poured himself a big mug and settled at the counter next to Steve. After a long contented sip, he added more quietly, “At least for now. Apparently you stripped me last night and I wasn’t even awake to enjoy it!”
Tony frowned.  He and Pepper had actually started hanging out again.  Not lots—Pepper wasn’t in New York lots—but some and it had been pretty awesome.  (Which was an amazing shitload of progress from last year’s “every time I look at you it hurts and I can’t stop seeing the way you recoiled from my ring and hearing you say ‘
“We have to talk.  I can’t . . . I can’t talk to you like this.  Not when I’m angry; it’s not right.”
“Sure, Cap.  Like you said, things are going back to normal. If we get called out, we go.  But otherwise, better show up at the gala and give the people what they want.”
Tony guided him gently with his right hand as Steve curled up, lifting his legs. He was so exposed: spread open, tied up, and desperate to be fucked.  (Oh God.)  He trembled.
Pepper was talking again—something, something, did all he could, could have been so much worse, bravery, something something—but his mind was still spinning around
Tony almost laughed. What an absurd pair they made! (Maybe those romance novelists were onto something after all.)
Tony winced and, hating his own embarrassment, went on the offensive, snapping: “Just, knock it off, ok? He’s Captain America. Show some fucking respect.”
Of course they spun it around, like he’s some liberatioNazi Dom-wanna-be who scorns subspace and his fellow subs. (Fucking assholes.) But he couldn’t exactly explain without telling them--
“Actually, I’m good, thanks,” Tony said blandly. “Vomit,” he added softly, activating JARVIS’ security protocols.
Today Jackie was wearing tight white trousers, electric pink platforms and a matching pink chiffon blouse. The instant he saw Tony he gasped.
Steve was back at the dining room table when Tony and his prodigious bedhead stumbled downstairs from the penthouse.  (The penthouse, where he’d gotten a normal night’s sleep in an actual bed.)
“That right there?” he said, pointing with his chin.  “It’s Tony’s handwriting. And if Tony doesn’t want to hear from you, why the hell would I help you out?”
him file reports and Steve supposed that was true.  He didn’t do it because he was required to, or even out of a sense of duty (well, not to Fury at least).  The reports really were helpful for him.  It let him think about a fight with a bit more distance and helped him identify ways they could all work better together in future.  Even if that battle hadn’t been particularly deadly (or even very interesting), there was always at least the potential for new insights.  And that mattered.
“I want you to stay right here, like this, for me,” Tony said softly.  “Can you do that for me, baby?”
Steve sucked then eased the cock to his throat, over and over. Sometimes he choked, but he seemed to be getting better, and the whole time he imagined Tony’s hand in his hair, his soft filthy praises in his ears.
When Tony rose from the table, Steve stood with a shy, questioning look and Tony’s breath caught in his throat at how
On the side of the bed there was a tray with fresh fruit, a bagel, and some of that extra thick bacon he loved. And a red rose in a single stem vase.

“Corporeal!” Tony said enthusiastically. “Getting there anyway. Physically manifest now. Not exactly
“You’re blushing,” Steve said, sounding truly surprised. (Had he never noticed it before?) Tony felt soft and open and a little embarrassed, but not exactly in a bad way.
Of course, if he went on Twitter or hunted through the comment pages, it would be another story—but he wasn’t a moron. If you turned over the rock, you’d find nasty crawling things. He knew to leave the rock in place.
, then one by one the other Avengers had filtered in, drawn to the wonders of old school sci-fi. Sitting on the couch between Bruce and Steve, with Natasha and Clint nearby Tony felt pretty contented. And Tony found himself getting ridiculously excited about Thanksgiving, not that he cared about Thanksgiving
Tony held in a sigh and turned away from the bar, putting his game face back on.  The man who’d spoken was about Tony’s age, handsome with sandy brown hair and bright green eyes.  Tony felt certain he knew him, but he was having trouble placing--
“Oh, just some old stuff that was lying around the Tower,” Tony said casually, “JARVIS reminded me that we had some ornaments after all.”
“Great!” Tony said, trying to remember if he’d met her before. (Maybe before her hair was blue?) He collected the boxes and checked her blouse for a nametag. No luck.
“Tony, I don’t understand how you could burn them!” Bruce cried in dismay. “I wasn’t even gone that long. And, wait? Are those scorch marks? Was it on
He’d been expecting to find Rogers sitting at the kitchen counter with a book, or working a crossword puzzle, or maybe making something to eat, alone or perhaps in companionable silence with a teammate or two. Instead, he found Bruce, Clint, and Natasha, sitting in a row on the couch, sharing a bowl of popcorn and watching
“Good morning, Tony,” Steve said. He held out both of his hands and Tony obliged him. Steve kissed first his left hand, then his right and, after a moment’s hesitation, cupped Tony’s face with both hands and kissed him softly on the lips.
Behind him, Steve's sensitive hearing picked out the sound of Tony muttering something very quietly, then Rhodes' louder reply:
“Oh, okay,” Tony said. “Good. Just, sometimes, I get into an engineering zone and don’t notice . . . stuff. Even when JARVIS reminds me. Bad habit.”
let me update her old butch cut. Sleek and sophisticated, but low maintenance. Half Wall Street, half Greek goddess. Artemis on the warpath.”
“You think,” Rogers said, vehemently, “you think placing bets that exploit Mr. Stark’s orientation and sexuality is
“Excellent. If you are still interested at the close of our meeting, I will provide some funds for travel expenses. This is separate from the salary. For your initial session, the artist would pay you 25$.”
Also, FYI: On my 16th birthday, my mother gave me a copy of The Joy of Sex with an almost identical inscription.  My mom is awesome.
Tony dropped his head down to the side and bit his lip. He smiled. After a moment’s indecisiveness, he ran his thumb across Steve’s wrist to caress the delicate skin.
“Just make it as soon as he can fit me in. Or should I call Jackie myself?” Tony asked, frowning up at the ceiling, then stripping and heading into the shower.
Natasha looked at him suspiciously. “You’re going to put it on top with your hands, right? Standing on a ladder like a normal person?”
“As a matter of fact,” Steve answered, “Jim just called me. But I get a feeling you might have known that.”
“ ‘C’mon, Tones,” Rhodey mumbled into Tony’s hair, pulling Tony’s arm over his shoulder. “‘Member at MIT?”
Tony wasn’t sure if it was polite to press, but he did it anyway, keeping his voice soft, “When you first talked about her, I thought the two of you were together, but then you never brought her around or said anything about her, and I hated to ask . . . Did you break up?”
Steve was clearly waiting for him to say something more; he hadn’t made the leap Tony was considering. Tony studied him for a moment, then held his hand out with a flourish and a bow.
Dummy had dropped the fabric in favor of bumping his claw against Cap’s knee. Steve looked a little confused, pet him gingerly on the top of his claw, then offered Dummy his hand. With a gentle care nineteen-year-old Tony had worked hard to teach him, Dummy closed his pinchers lightly on Steve’s hand and moved up and down.
“Oh, Steve, yeah,” Tony murmured, hands fisting in the blankets.  (Yeah . . . oh, yeah . . . wait, no, don’t slow down!)
cooking brunch. He always hummed whatever crappy church music they’d played that week. He’d been trying out new recipes from the
(They hadn’t meant to linger over hotdogs, but Steve got to chatting with the vendor, then they needed hot chocolate and it was a bit of a walk—anyway.)
“Tony, you closed the portal,” she said, “That was the best thing you could possibly do. You can’t take it on yourself when—“
“Yuck it up, fuzz face,” Tony said. “It’s working, isn’t it? Who cares if the aesthetics of partial armor are a bit . . . off.”
“We’ll stagger the press releases,” Carmichael said decisively. “Three months after Captain America goes public and introduces The Avengers Initiative--once Mr. Stark’s probation is up, of course--we’ll bring on Iron Man.”
The AI complied silently while Steve scrambled to get out of his clothes and dropped back to his knees in front of Tony. He was already breathing heavily.  Tony looked at him with a pensive expression, then pointed.
work on it.  Bruce was there on and off, but seemed pretty philosophical about the impossibility of coming up with a solution in the absence of fuller data.  So Bruce would come down for a while, then leave for meals and sleep and zen crap.  (“Life-work balance in a non-emergency scenario.”) Sometimes he dragged Tony with him, sometimes he didn’t.
Tony woke in the workshop with Dummy by his side and a blanket spread across his legs. He looked down, expecting a shattered mess—but no. His scotch glass was on the floor, upright, over by Dummy’s charging station.
“Wish I had some of our duets on video,” Pepper added, sounding amused. “For private consumption only, of course.”
Tony tossed two of the big couch cushions down of the floor next to Steve, then wrapped his hand around Steve’s arm, urging him to scoot over and kneel on the padding.  “Move for me, honey.”  Tony knelt behind him to caress him and nuzzle his neck.
At least now the government had banned electroshock and aversion therapy. And you had to self-enroll and be over eighteen years old; parents couldn’t ship their kids off at twelve anymore, like poor Brittney.
better person to set you up. I know all the best people!” The shock faded from Steve’s face, and his brow creased. He looked away.
(Oh, hm. There was a question. “The Naked Time”? “Balance of Terror?” Oh! “Devil in the Dark.” That’d be a good one. Hm.)
The Captain wrenched his comm from his ear and spun on his heel, looking ready to throw the little headset at a tree.
“There are a lot of presents, Tony. The Lotus is the little fast one, right? I don’t think they’ll fit in that.”
, just suck me like that for a few seconds, then . . . then . . . try again.”  Tony released his hair.
Tony turned to go back to his workbench, but Steve laid a hand on his arm. “Thank you, Tony. I—uh, thank you.”
Tony gave a dismissive wave, then said more seriously, “I was talking to Jacob earlier and heard about your generous donation to the Safehouse. You’ll do a lot of good for a lot of people.”
I am overwhelmed by your kindness and generosity.  Your comments are like a big fluffy blanket of comfort and empathy.  Thank you!
“Steve said you’d like to try transforming with us soon,” Natasha said. “An isolated rural location would probably be best.”
Steve squeezed Tony’s wrists a little harder. “And I want you to answer ‘yes, Steve’ or ‘no, Steve’ when I ask you a question. Will you do that for me?”
Tony was pretty sure Bruce had at least an inkling of what was going on—after all, he’d noticed Steve’s crush before Tony had.
“I’m sorry,” Tony murmured.  He stroked his hands across Steve’s back, then--desperate for skin--reached up to where the cowl hung down so he could touch Steve’s neck and run his fingers through his hair.
Tony hadn’t realized how worried he’d been until Pepper caved and he felt like sinking down in relief. “Great. I’ll have it ready for the big conference in Berlin. Their security isn’t as bad as Milan’s but it--”
“Yes! I’ll make a fresh pot of coffee and we’ll get to it. But this time, we’re working in my workshop, k?”
Many thanks to all the kind cheer leaders who have kept me going and above any other my amazing beta.  Where would I be without you, love?
He twisted to look up at her and hesitated a second before adding: “You know . . . I’ll do anything in my power to help you be a mom.  Anything at all.  Just say the word.”
“You have already consumed all the coffee stored in the workshop, however, I believe there is a supply remaining in the kitchen.”
Even Eddie Izzard references couldn’t tempt Tony to eat institutional pasta though. In the end, Tony just had a sad looking salad, toast, and coffee. The coffee tasted burnt. It always did.
he could do it in his sleep in half an hour in a cave with the most deplorable junk, but that wasn’t really the point.  There had to be a way to recycle this crap more effectively.  (‘Cause seriously, it’s ridiculous to let people dump their used electronics on Africa.  The crap people keep sending them is worth more for the copper than anything else . . .)  Dummy handed him an even smaller screwdriver and then, for no obvious reason, a Frisbee.  So, recycle or repurpose.  Actually repurpose.
Tony’s phone pinged. (Steve!) It wasn’t. It was a reminder to go over SI paperwork that Pepper had sent last week. Tony glared.
The next chart repeated the alphabetical list of kinks while the columns detailed Tony’s experience levels with them. There were links to various little notes like “historically, didn’t combine well with a blindfold” or “particularly enjoyed with suspension bondage.”
“As kids I think Bucky made it his mission to toughen me up,” Steve said. “I guess he figured that I’d have just that much more need to stand up for myself, what with how sick I was and my size, which, well, since we assumed I’d be inverted.”
It was nice. Sometimes Tony’d look up from his work, lost in thought, and would find himself staring at Steve: the way his brow furrowed very slightly when he was concentrating on his reading; the way his blue eyes caught the light of Tony’s schematics; the way his tongue would dart out from time to time to cross his lower lip; the way he’d move his head very slightly to the beat of the Duke Ellington Tony’d put on for him. And if Steve caught him looking, Tony’d just smile and Steve’d smile back.
“Rude,” he said to Bruce, glaring at the now empty patch of dirt, “Just rude.  It’s like inviting people to a party then canceling at the last minute. And, okay, fine, that thing was probably promising a pretty shitty party, but still.”
“And thank you for the simulations, JARVIS,” Steve said, looking up at the ceiling.  “You did a great job making it seem like the hologram opponents were actually trapped in the nets.”
Tony sat smiling at his phone for a moment before beginning to type a reply. (It felt weird to just put it in words. Into writing. Had he done this before?)
If they talked about the important stuff and Rogers disappointed him, if he turned out to be as big an orientationist asshole as Tony sometimes feared, then Tony couldn’t just cut him out.  Rogers would still be there: in his Tower, his commanding officer, his Captain.
Tony looked at the formal dinning table again and took a deep breath.  It didn’t actually look like a scene from Stark Manor. Not really.  (Howard would never have served curry. And none of the furniture here was a priceless antique.)  Tony shook his head.
“Okay, so, when you insist on opening the door, getting my chair, all that stuff,” Tony began, “they’re charged actions.  You’re marking me out to everybody there as a sub.”  Tony paused a moment, thinking.  Rogers leaned forward a little, but remained silent.  “Doing that stuff,” Tony continued, “reinforces the idea that there’s a fundamental difference between us; that we’re not equal.”
Tony’s guts clenched. (No. It was fine.) The hair on the back of his neck stood up. (Just because it could jump like an arachnoid, didn’t mean it was hostile like them…)
. It was a sickly greenish-grey, about six feet wide by three feet tall, and most closely resembled an amoeba with five tiny tentacles, covered in some sort of gelatinous ooze that shimmered in the light. Tony shuddered. (The Blob meets creepy, dismembered octopus.) It skittered in a tight little circle, then froze.
Steve cut himself off and took a few deep breaths before he raised Tony’s chin with a gentle hand and said, “Now, I need to go get a few things from my quarters, all right?”
The dildo curved a bit at an angle and was on the small side. It was quite a bit smaller than Tony, which was probably to ease him into things, but also seemed like it would make it less useful for a proper . . . education. Steve gave it a gentle squeeze; it felt slightly springy, but not warm and yielding like real flesh. The texture was a little odd. The head was well-shaped and it had ropey veins standing up which made it look like it might have come from a mold of an actual penis. (And, yeah, that’s a weird thought.) It was very realistic in its shape, but it had an oddly uniform pinkish color to it that was nothing like a real cock.
“Steve, I’m a man being offered a blowjob,” Tony replied with a wry smile. “I’m never gonna say no.”
At fourteen, he passed it off to Rhodey as an atheism thing—not a ‘can’t bear to be around a huge, happy family at Christmas’ thing—and had stuck with that approach ever since. And, to be totally honest, he
Steve had checked “curious” in the column for “gags,” so he’d read that section and found it too was full of cautions:
Running up the stairs shouldn’t raise his heart rate anymore, but his heart was pounding as he dashed to Tony’s bedroom.  The door was open.
Steve’s brow creased; he didn’t look at Tony or speak. Tony added, “I mean, sure, Bucky Barnes, Howling Commando, he’s in the history books and the cartoons and that exhibit at the Smithsonian, but that’s not—“ Tony shook his head. “I mean, there’s a lot of press out there on War Machine, but that’s not really him . . . not
I tried to figure out if this chapter needed warnings of some sort, but had no idea what I could call it other than possible emotional whip lash ?  So, I guess that!
A tall Domme with broad shoulders and a shock of red-gold hair strode across the cafeteria towards them.
Steve squeezed Tony’s wrists harder against the wall and let his tongue dip into Tony’s eager mouth. Tony’s blood was pounding in his ears, his heart thundering in his chest.
“Aw, don’t be like that.  You know what I mean.”  Harris was still trailing after him.  A few agents paused to look at them momentarily, then went about their business.
The food was magnificent; the wine, delightful. They’d talked about art, Stark Industries, engineering, cooking, and cuisine. At no point had Tony found an easy segue to his contract. A couple of times Steve had gotten this sweetly nervous look on his face and Tony’d felt certain that he was going to broach the topic, but no. Nope. Nada. Not yet.
“So what?” Tony said, with a shrug. “You liked me—we were training and you, what . . ? Got a little turned on? There’s nothing wrong with feeling that way. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
The others were already seated at the conference table when Tony arrived: Agent Romanov, Captain America, what’s-his-name the archer-- Clint Barton, that was his name-- and some new guy with salt-and-pepper hair and terrible fashion sense who hunched back in his chair so hard it looked like he was trying to disappear into it.  And of course Nick Fury, a gigantic Dom stereotype in his leather trench coat with a side of leather everything.
“I hope you know you could come to me, if anything were wrong, and you would trust me to deal with it.”

“Hey, babe,” Tony whispered, pressing his cheek to Steve’s neck. “Hey, big guy . . . I’m right here . . . You’ve got me.”
Tony nodded.  He took Steve’s hand and kissed his palm, then leaned his cheek into that large hand and closed his eyes.  Steve stroked his hair with his left hand and even without looking Tony knew he was smiling
Tony stared the glass of water for a moment, then took it carefully in both hands and focused on drinking it. Pepper was a comfortable weight at his back. Still bobbing along to “Single Ladies,” she almost made him spill. (It was a good thing drinking a glass of water didn’t usually call for so much attention.)
while you were in a coma. I was half out of my mind at the thought you might never wake up. You will NOT jeopardize your recovery in a misguided attempt at self-punishment.”
“So, to answer your question,” Steve said quietly. He tipped Tony’s head up with a gentle finger under his chin and looked down with a sad smile. “When there’s still war and poverty and cruelty . . . even if God minds, I don’t think what we get up to in bed is gonna rank too high on His list. Or mine neither—whether the Church says it’s technically a sin or not.”
The next morning Tony stumbled into the kitchen, bleary as usual. (Ok, maybe very very slightly hungover. But not
“So,” Tony said, “I heard that you’ve been giving hand-to-hand training to everybody. Well--” he took a long sip of water, “everybody except
“If you Hulk out, it will be okay,” Tony said as they landed in the quinjet. He put all the conviction he could into his voice. “We trust you—we’re a team. Seriously though, buddy, if you can science for me now, that would be better.”
For seventeen days, Tony’d let it slide-- (Shocking, right?)—because, well, Rogers clearly wasn’t trying to be a dick.  But it was still fucking annoying, so Tony’d done what he did so often: rolled his eyes, frowned, sighed, snorted.  When Rogers couldn’t take a fucking hint, Tony had upgraded to explicit verbal snarking:
“Appointment?” Tony repeated. “What appointment? We haven’t got anything with SHIELD for almost a week. Unless they’re bringing you in for special solo meetings which, depending on their reasons, might be a crappy thing to do and—“
“Ah, sure,” Bruce said.  (After a moment’s hesitation.  Was that hesitation? Shit.) “Sounds great. Maybe after some sleep, though.”
“I thought you might be embarrassed if I said something in front of the others, but Mother Superior thanked me,” Steve said, eyes bright. “She said there was an anonymous donation of five million dollars for Magdalene House—enough to fix the roof, redo the insulation for the dormitories, and hire all the additional staff they’ve been needing. Even enough left over to start a scholarship fund for the older kids. She suspected my influence and thanked me, but it was all you, wasn’t it?”
“But that won’t be enough on its on,” the Captain continues. “People have to ask for help and accept it. And that’s hard. Just telling you that I have shellshock--that sometimes it wakes me up in the night--is . . . hard. . Part of me feels that it means I’ve failed, as a man. As a Dominant. As a soldier. But the rest of me knows that’s wrong. At least, here.” He taps his temple. “I’m working on getting the message here.” He taps his breast.
“Rhodey head out already?” Tony asked, with a sudden wash of confused guilt. (How long have I been down here?)
Cap, Widow, and Hawkeye were already advancing on the creature as one. It struggled away, dragging Tony with it—the damn thing was
Thanks so much for reading!  Hope you liked it!  Comments, musings, and speculation are loved and adored! Hope it wasn't too much porn for you! ;p
“Tony?” he murmured. Tony's eyes fluttered open and he gave Steve an exhausted half-smile. There was a week's stubble-- almost a beard-- growing in the gaps of Tony's van dyke. But that could wait.
“So, I’ve got lots of our weapons specializations and skill sets up there, but we should work on expanding it.  Widow, would you like to go over your training?”
(No, this is ridiculous.)  Tony loved seeing Steve on his knees, tied up, at his command.  Didn’t he?  He’d said he did.  (Oh sure, ‘cause Tony always tells the truth… Especially when it’s about what
“I’ll say this for Thanksgiving at the Tower,” Mrs. Rhodes said, “It sure is nice to have enough ovens! It’s always a pain with just one. And considering the bird you got?! Well, I’d have had to make all the pies yesterday.” She chuckled. “Captain Rogers is a fair hand in the kitchen, to my surprise—I’ll give him that—but left to his own devices I fear we’d have been eating that bird of yours at midnight. Good thing I was here.”
Natasha raise her eyebrow at him, but a few moments later she did come inside, moving silently as always.
“Penthouse, J,” Tony called when he got back to the Tower, then thought better of it and asked, “Actually, where’s Pep?”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Tony fibbed. “It’s an anonymous donation, right? Could be anyone, really.”
