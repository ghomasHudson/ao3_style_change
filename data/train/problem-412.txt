“Are you itching for it now?” He searches my face.
“Happy Christmas!” John pats Lestrade on the arm and leans forward to kiss Molly’s cheek. John’s hand rests on Sherlock's thigh, giving him a gentle squeeze before he moves away.
John closes the gap between them. “Shhh.” The press of John's lips is not gentle but filled with longing. Sherlock parts his lips in anticipation of welcoming the warmth of John's tongue. It's velvety and silky, a thousand times better than what he's dreamt of. The tip traces the inside of Sherlock’s mouth. With a soft moan, Sherlock cups John's face to crush his mouth to his. If he could crawl inside this wonderful, amazing man, he would.
“Can we go under the sheets?” he asked, all shy.
“John.” The response comes in a hushed, broken baritone, and John grips both saucer and hair tighter as he presses in and fits their mouths together.
Sherlock holds him.
“You know, most people come out and say something like ‘I love you’ instead of talking about trading clothes that don't fit the other.”
“Sherlock, you did everything perfectly. I wouldn't have made it through this without you.”
“Sherlock… what?”
Snarl. Delete.
Eyes the color of moonlight in the dim reception hall remain locked to his while he speaks.
Sex is an unavoidable course of action for John at this time, as any lack of participation would raise undue suspicion on Mary’s part. Sherlock has little understanding of sexual attraction and how emotions relate, so he cannot predict how well John will be able to perform. John is surely still physically attracted to Mary, though he no longer loves or trusts her the way he once did. Perhaps it will simply be an habitual act, as they undoubtedly have coupled many times over the course of their relationship.
John wonders if, after ten, twenty, thirty more years, he’ll ever be able to truly forgive himself for hurting this man. Or if he’ll ever truly deserve to have him in his life.
He feels like he’s been waiting for it.
“No, John. Your actions are to be commended today. You're the one that had far too much asked of you.”
He moves to lean against his chair, content to watch Sherlock and not speak. He doesn’t recognize the tune, but he hazards a guess that’s it’s not classical, and also that it’s not an original composition of Sherlock’s, as he’s developed a feel for the detective’s style. The notes are slightly faster paced than what he normally plays, and a touch more upbeat, a song that sounds as though it probably doesn’t belong on a violin, though Sherlock can adapt anything.
“Probably.” Sherlock smiles the gentlest smile John has ever seen and rubs absently at John's cheeks with his thumbs.
Sherlock’s answering laugh is deep and dulcet, and his hands grasp John’s face to bring them back together in a kiss amid the taste of tears.
The last few words might be a shout into Sherlock’s shirt.
“No,” he manages, hands moving to pull Sherlock in by the waist, and he’s a bit startled at the honest sensual growl his own voice has become. “Think how much we have to make up for, and how much time we’ll have to do it.”
John feels a flush spreading up his neck, and a slow grin stealing over his face. It's probably the concussion, he reasons.
and wills sleep to take him. He'd be lying if he said he isn't considering cocaine, but if John can be brave when faced with the enemy, Sherlock will be brave when faced only with this loss he feels with a passion.
Sherlock blinks. He can tell from John's tone that it was meant it to be contemplative but it prickles at him. "What?"
He all but vaults from the platform when his vow is complete, simultaneously frightened and furious and envious and anguished (and something else smoldering under his ribs that he can't name), a terrible rhapsody of emotions within a man that hours prior had claimed to have no notion of such things.
"I couldn't, of course," John says at last. "But then, it's only ever been you, hasn't it?"
“I wonder if Mary knew I was never hers. Not really.”
John laughs indulgently, and Sherlock joins in with the deep rumble he loves, and John thinks the evening's turn of events have made a concussion quite worthwhile.
John is all at once overwhelmed, wanting, needing, to drive home how indescribably lucky he feels to be enough for this person he loves more than anything. He claims those lips again, hard, climbing right into Sherlock’s lap, tears building in the corners of his eyes as he drowns in adoration.
(See the end of the chapter for
He notes the irony in his having been concerned for how adequately John might keep a level head, when he is the one driving himself spare, locked away in his flat.
“Oh and Sherlock, you may want to inform Doctor Watson. Immediately.”
Sherlock sits up with a huff of irritation, takes the proffered file, and opens it with the air of someone interrupted from something boring yet infinitely preferable to the task at hand. Mycroft watches, face impassive, as Sherlock's expression shifts rapidly into one of consternation and a flush swarms up his pale neck.
he scoffs to himself, desperate to ignore his current train of reasoning.
Art by the incredible Johana at
) flat. John has been gone for one hour and twenty-nine minutes, his cheeks flushed and hair tousled from the slight March winds. Sherlock can't interpret for certain if John has been outside and walking for the entire duration of his absence, but he'd be willing to bet on it.
He’d knelt in front of Sherlock, placing a hand on his knee, struck by the memory of his stag night, years ago. Before Sherlock was his. Before he’d been granted the incredible gift of being loved by Sherlock.
Silence reverberates between them. John is everything to Sherlock, in ways that nothing and no one have ever come close, not even his work, sole defining factor of his life though it had been before John (and he
He himself worried, for one hour and twenty-nine minutes. Whether John believed him because he has come to take Sherlock’s deductions as gospel, or whether he refused to believe him because illogical sentiment regrettably cannot always be avoided, Sherlock did not know. And so he waited.
He swallows past an emotion he can't name and places a hand gently on John's shoulder. "I meant what I said. I'll never let you down, I'll keep you safe, I'm
He is overcome with the fierce desire to seize John's hand and run into the night. John would oblige. John would follow.
"Actually, now I can."
Then Sherlock begins to sing, voice rich and low, something John rarely has the fortune to hear, and he suddenly understands.
Sherlock’s chest is heaving and there are tears shining on his cheeks and John waits for him to respond.
It is seven days when he worries himself all over again with regard to pregnancy.
Sherlock’s arms wrap around John a little tighter. John doesn’t think someone watching would have even noticed. But he can feel it.
Anything but what Sherlock doesn't dare give contemplation to.
what it is to feel and covet and touch, it'll be too late to come back, to refrain, to stay detached. He wants to know so badly, and it frightens him. He wants John.
“Course I am, Sherlock.” John shifts uncomfortably in the unfamiliar sheer fabric of the shirt. “I've had much worse than a smack to the head, even if this might have caused a concussion… ugh.”
It comes on suddenly, one afternoon at Baker Street.
. It's all lies that carry him through the rest of his speech, and indeed everything he's said at this table already that wasn't the singing of his own personal praises of John. He ruminates on the many people that throughout his life have implied or stated forthright that he is a terrible liar and he thinks viciously,
Sherlock’s head turns from the window, gaze drifting over John, eyes iridescent with the morning light. John is half aware of the picture he presents - a grown man standing with his mouth open in a shocked smile, tenting his pants, eyes locked onto the man advancing towards him with not a beat missed.
I look up from cleaning to find him staring at my arms. Following his gaze, I realise that I've rolled my shirtsleeves past my elbows; and the evidence of my favourite hobby.
Slowly, Sherlock lowers himself between John’s thighs. He feels the heat from John’s skin radiate and with the first press of skin on skin contact, he gasps.
“Fuck, God,” he grunted.
“Hardly,” I utter under my breath while he fishes in pocket for the keys.
Sherlock Holmes likes this.
He spins me around with a growl and kisses me hungrily. “God, I want to taste you so much….every inch of you.”
Sinatra was swinging
“That's not what most people say,” I mutter.
“I agree.” He presses his chest to my back and nips along my shoulder. My flagging erection fills again. His hand reaches around me to brush his fingertips along the length of my cock. “What do you want?”
“Well...don’t. You’re really rubbish at it,” he says pointedly.
I look at the knife. “This is too dull to be of any help.”
Sherlock Holmes ‘You are correct. Long periods without speaking and sometimes violin late into the night’
The door creaks again. This time he grabs a stuffed unicorn to toss at the cat. Rolling over with his arm raised, he sees Sherlock framed by the door.
It's time, tonight under the half moon that hangs above the shops. He's been brave about many things like death, torture - even murder. Not with his emotions, not the unprotected flesh parts of him. He looks up to the sky in hopes that the right words will find him. Filling his lungs with air, he stares directly into John’s eyes.
He chuckles. “A what?”
I wink. “I was paid today so I'll give you full price. Will you have the other item I'll need next week?”
We’re sticky from sweat, oil and bodily fluids. He pushes up and gets on shaky legs. Running a hand through his hair, he smiles down at me.
Any reservations John had harboured fly out through the lacy rainbow curtains. He sheds his shirt and pulls Sherlock on top of him in a messy crush of mouths, teeth and skin. Pornographic sighs and moans fill the tiny room. John pitches his hips to grind against Sherlock.
Clutching his arm, the nervous one limps away. I knew he'd be the first to flee the scene. The slight man, who had been staring in shock, lunges at me. My fist connects with his nose. It's been awhile since I have boxed without gloves. With a punch to his jaw, my right hand aches. My knuckles will be swollen tomorrow. The thin man staggers back, his fingers scraping on the wall. He spits blood into the white snow.
I muss up my hair and begin to whistle ‘Jingle Bells’ as I round the corner of the alley.
"Oh I did. I also have the ability to recall something if it's essential information. Tonight called for those kinds of memories." Sherlock places a gentle kiss on John's scar.
“Fuck you!” The bald man spits.
And then he sang a song
“It's real, everything. The pain, the happiness, the desire to touch you. All of it.” He closes his eyes. “For so long,” he takes a gulp of air. He can't get enough. “I've held it in and stood by.” The dam has released and floods John's ears with every thought and feeling. “All the girlfriends and Mary, oh God Mary. That wedding and baby. I think I was more relieved that it wasn't yours than you were. I've held my breath just hoping there could be a chance…”
He laughs softly. “At least a few hours and some coffee. I should get us a flannel.”
"She'll appreciate the fact her duvet popped many a cherry. Maybe less thrilled that not one but two cocks were on her bed. Something she would have never imagined."
I only nod and watch him pull out bottles of alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and plasters.
Just as I was about to push forward again, headlights streaked across the walls and ceiling. I prayed it was a car turning around, but the car stayed in the driveway. I heard some muffled techno music.
I capture his mouth again and press my hips into his hand, practically grinding against him. “What do you want to do, Dr. Watson?”
He sets down two juice glasses with ice and pours a generous amount of clear liquid in both.
Wincing as he pulls himself to his full height, he nods. “Not fast. I might have a cracked rib or two.”
“Put it inside me. Just slowly.”
“You’re welcome to a shower,” he says.
Sherlock throws his back against the baby powder scented pillow. He focuses on the rainbows overhead and not coming too soon. As John's body surrounds his cock, it takes everything he has to not thrust up into the welcoming heat. Nothing, not even cocaine, has ever felt this good. He could watch his cock disappear into John every night for as long as they both lived.
John’s pink tongue darts out to lick his cracked lips. “No, you can check.”
As people shuffle by on their merry way to dinners and whatever else these people do, I stroll to the Chinese restaurant five blocks from the Met. I replay the high points of the case I had spent 49 hours and 12 minutes solving. It had started as only a five but blossomed to at least a solid nine, maybe even a nine point four. It's quite exciting when a simple case of infidelity transitions to extortion and attempted murder. But my case high is wearing off and with nothing on the horizon, I can feel the restlessness in my bones. My fingers are twitching as I shake the snow from my hair as I enter the restaurant.
“Sorry,” Sherlock mumbles in embarrassment.
Luckily, Harry and Clara decided to have an epic shouting match that lasted long enough for Sherlock and I to clean up, hide the empty bottle of wine, and to pile up on my newly made bed with a movie. Harry slammed into the house and pounded up the stairs. As expected, my door was thrown open and she raged for twenty bloody minutes about Clara.
John returns to his Facebook feed. More memes, videos of pets being adorable or silly and quizzes. He pauses on one update.
I squeeze my eyes shut. “Fine. My brain never stops. I deduce all the time. I'm always observing, I can't turn it off. On a walk, trip to the shops, even in the men's toilet. It. Never. Stops. It slows when I have a case, something that forces my brain to focus.” I sigh heavily feeling the weight of my talent bleed into his bloodied hands. “When I'm off a case, my brain speeds out of control again. It tears itself apart, and takes me with it. The drugs make it stop. Everything slows to a soft hum and I can function as a human...or close to one.”
You took my dreams
I pull on the latex gloves with a pop and snap. “I'm a consulting detective.”
“I love you. So much.” And I kissed him hard.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock falters.
“Soon, once I get myself together. I'm not well right now.” Sherlock blinked at the shame that threatened to well up in his eyes. “But I vo-” Sherlock stopped short. “I will be. Soon.”
When Billy winks, it sends a cold chill to my stomach. The thought of him and a lady friend shooting up to shag is not a pleasant one. Billy had probably been a handsome boy before drugs gripped him. Every time I see him, he is thin, shaky with a sickly sheen of sweat covering him. However, his drugs are the cleanest in London. His lady friend is a nurse at in a Pediatrics office uptown, and for a little extra, Billy provides me with clean urine samples in case I need one. Lestrade is in the habit of asking after a case, so I need to be prepared.
“What exactly are you referring to?” He can barely hear John over his own heart pounding in his ears. He knows it's physiologically impossible for it to be his heart, but everything is speeding faster than he can process. Emotions are flying around like deductions at a crime scene.
My cock throbs with its own pulse. One hand tries to alleviate the pressure in my trousers, while the other holds on to John for dear life. I’m sinking and he is my preserver.
“Relax.” I pull some bills from my pocket. “I trust you and that's why I never haggle over prices.”
He's so wrapped up in that room, he barely feels the tug on his shirtsleeve. When he blinks, John's beaming face is inches from his.
“I’ll be the girl,”John smiles.
Sherlock winks. “I’ll tell you on the way home.” He glances up as the train doors open. “This is our stop.”
"Never again, John."
In fact, the only Christmases Sherlock has ever enjoyed have all included John Watson. Compared to the past, this holiday had been quiet. They had a small case, barely a five, but they had worked flawlessly together. John had anticipated Sherlock’s every step and deduction. It had been like a beautiful waltz, and left him such a feeling of euphoria that he had paused to purchase a Christmas tree. No number of ornaments or strands of lights could compare to the brightness of John’s face when he had seen Sherlock propping the fragrant tree in the sitting room. They had listened to god awful Christmas music as they strung lights and hung the few ornaments Sherlock had not broken in previous years. The afternoon had been tucked away in the mind palace in the room that had been reserved for Sherlock and John. Cases, tender moments, lovely things John had said, and the day they had met live in the most precious room.
This time, he hissed and his body tensed around me. I froze.
"You don't have to stay in here. You can take my room," John offers.
With a laugh, John shakes his head. "You never fail to amaze me. Do you know what your gift is?"
“Part of the profession. I study all types of wounds, on corpses, victims and suspects. All are clues.” I peer closer and my nasal passages fill with the sweet smell of sweat mingled with the acidic tang of blood. My head spins with...want. Focus, Holmes.
"I'm surprised she didn't go blind. It's so bright." Sherlock squints against the colours.
“You were pretty
I lean close. “Don't worry. I'm sure whatever it is that it's not my flavour.”
With a grin, I slide my body along his as I stand until we are pressed together - hips to chest. “I wouldn’t want that…”
The corner of Sherlock's mouth quirked up. “There is Rosie. Remember that.”
“No, I want you inside me, then. I want to do this with you,” he had said.
“Do you have something to drink at your place?” I ask.
“And more preparation..”
He sits on the sofa. “I was invited but declined. Wasn't up for celebrating.”
“I simply observed. You told me everything I needed to know about you. It's a bit of a talent I possess,” I say proudly.
“Are you sure you want that?” I whisper.
We collapse and untangle only to lie together on the sofa and tangle again. We kiss languidly and caress each other’s skin. Those touches lead to more heated kisses and John climbing on top of me. Another condom foil falls to the floor and he oils himself again. This time, I can see his face as he enters me. I feel each thrust go deeper. My heels dig into his back, guiding him and coaxing him because I have lost the capacity of words. The only word that my lips can form is “John” over and over. When I come the second time, it covers our bellies. When he comes again, I can see his face, and it is beautiful.
"Oh sweet mercy, John!" He huffs. His hips make small circles as his orgasm slowly abates, leaving him boneless.
One drink feels like an eternity. They are embraced by friends and detectives when they hop off the stage. John pulls out a barstool for Sherlock but stands close enough for his arm to press against the detective's back. When he laughs, his body vibrates with joy and he cups Sherlock's shoulder affectionately. Before half his beer is gone, John places the bottle on the bar.
“If you kill him, we don’t get nothing,” a slight man says to a burlier man to his right. The third man glances at his watch nervously.
“So I'm letting a drug addict take care of me?” He points to the bruises in the crooks of my arms.
“I don’t need or want it.” I want it to burn and sting. I need to feel every inch of him fill and stretch me until his is fully seated. Then I want him to pound until I beg for release.
Oh if he's into Itchy Richie, more blokes like the three we just saw will follow soon enough.
He flashes a brief smile. “Right. I'm covered in blood.”
Of course their first evening together would be fevered passion in his sister's twin bed. Nothing about their relationship has ever followed any kind of convention. John couldn't be happier for that - even the awkward start and stop dance they've done for years.
I nod. “They tell me to fuck off.”
"Quite a tribute." Sherlock nods tightly.
"You may need a sleep mask to dim the brightness of that room." Sherlock gestures to the rainbow happiness just beyond the threshold.
"I've preserved Harriet's room perfectly," Mrs. Watson beams from the threshold.
"So am I, John. Good night." Sherlock's fingers wrap around John's hand and give him a small squeeze before letting go.
The pizza was forgotten as we began to kiss again. I have spent hours just snogging his brains out. Tonight, I was going to get to see more, feel more. I had to think of my maths class just to calm down before I came in my pants.
I hear the crunch of bones and the smack of knuckles on flesh. A body slams against the brick wall in the alley I am approaching. It’s in my best interest to hurry past.
“Put that on a shirt.” John wraps his hand around his arm to pull him off the barstool. “It’s our turn to sing!”
He smirks. “Is that an invitation?”
His pulse quickens under my fingers. “Sorry, it's just…”
“I’m not going to last long like this,” I told him. “Are you ready?”
Sherlock looks from the monitor to John.
"You were fan-fucking-tastic," John murmurs.
Sherlock Holmes ‘Aren’t you clever. I could use someone like you. Do you often take the train?’
I quirk an eyebrow. “Leaving you here on your own?”
It’s Sherlock’s turn to grin. “If you do, I most certainly won’t last.” His face falls serious a moment later. “But your mother…”
“Don't!” he cried. “Keep going.”
John sighs heavily as the train lurches forward then breaks abruptly. The radio crackles with an indecipherable message about traffic, delays and something about a switch.
“Have plans?” He pokes my ribs.
“I’m endeavouring to make my evening more interesting.”
“Thanks,” he mutters. He gestures to a row of hooks on the wall. “Any one will do. I'd return the favour, but I'm a bit roughed up.”
With another shot of vodka, his fingers make quick work on the buttons of my shirt. He’s careful to not tear, but I shiver as the cool air hits my skin. His mouth soon follows leaving trails of his saliva along my neck and chest. His teeth graze my nipples causing me to hiss in pleasure. I lean back against the soft cushions of the sofa and allow him to make art on my body. Every kiss, lick, suck and bite marks my pale skin. I push back, wanting him to bite harder, to press his fingers into my skin so that I can remember him for days. I press my lips to the scar, wanting to reopen the wound just to taste his blood.
John's body language shifts in a way that Sherlock struggles to intuit.
John seizes the front of Sherlock's vest and presses their lips together. It's brief, but rough, and somehow Sherlock can recognize that it's very, very John before everything in him goes offline.
Something strange twinges in Sherlock's chest as John sits down heavily, and all he can think to do is apologize again.
John’s breath leaves him in what could be considered the quietest of laughs. “I don’t know. Am I even ready to say it myself?”
“John,” Sherlock repeats, softly, softly now, silent tears of his own disappearing into the fabric of the jumper. “I will never want for anything, the way I want you.”
He chain smokes and shouts at the telly and plays the violin, scrubbing the hateful wedding waltz from the strings with every swipe of his bow.
Mycroft extends the file in Sherlock's direction.
Phrases echo in his head.
“Glad the working half is the one that… loves me too.” He's suddenly shy, lost in new territory, and John wants to kiss him senseless until Sherlock doesn't remember what it's like to not be consumed with love.
John is displaying at least four of them and he doubts that his own face is any less revealing.
There’s a soft, helpless sound, exhaled on the top of his head. “It was never the right time.”
He pushes away from the door, collapses gracelessly onto his bed, sends a text that is inadequate compared to all the things he'd like to say (
“I didn't even thank you,” John says, voice hoarse, making his way to the chair opposite Sherlock (
On that ninth morning, he is startled awake by Mycroft at his bedroom door, a file held in his hands.
Feel free to stop by my tumblr, also
“Ah yes, I could tell you them now, if you'd like.” Sherlock helps John stand and make his way over to the ambulance.
“It's rather serious,” he drawls.
Coldplay,
“That's not to say I don't prefer you in your sensible button downs, and this hideous jumper that fits me like doll clothes fit a shepherd dog but that is perfectly at home on you, and-”
Sherlock leaves.
“I did, I thought you looked very nice and you were beginning to chastise the image of you wearing it, and, well.” He stops to take in a long, slow breath. “So many times you've been hurt, worse than this as you've said, and there's so much I might never have been able to tell you. So. I wanted to change that inexcusable pattern.”
“There you are, Sherlock. I swear you're the only person I could possibly stand to be around right now.”
Feel free to stop by my tumblr, also
“I’d like that.” He pulls Sherlock back into an embrace. Nearly 7 years. They’ve never done this. They’re idiots, he thinks.
“Wouldn't that take quite a long time?”
He doesn't take the drug den case. The same evening he decides against it whilst lying in bed, he gives into something far sweeter and far more dangerous than cocaine, bringing himself off with one fist and choking off his shout with the other. He comes to the memory of blue eyes and rough lips, body shaking for a long while after he has finished.
As if summoned by Sherlock's own traitorous thoughts, John appears at down the lane with an audible sigh of relief. Sherlock is glad for the truth in that his tolerance for social contact wears thin rather quicker than for others, as it makes a fine excuse at present for his having sequestered himself, though he doesn't begrudge John's presence even now.
“She's beautiful today, and I can remember why I loved her. I imagine she might love me, in her way. But she's dangerous, she's a liar, she could be using me to help some other arsehole get to you…”
“Sherlock,” John exhales, more breath than speech, as their eyes meet, and there is so much between them that has always been unspoken that it would be a punch to the stomach, if it weren’t for the gentle heat blossoming inside him; the knowledge that they’ve begun to speak these things is warmth, and Sherlock is the sun.
That low voice reignites the detective, his hand tightening on John's shoulder and drawing him in again, focus narrowed to the inferno in his chest and the wanting in his lips. Dormant instinct flares to life as he kisses John Watson; it's too much, and not enough, all at once.
Sherlock’s cheek pressed into his hair, pale hands strong and sure and gentle on his shoulder and his back. The fire warming them. The familiar scent of 221B, and of Sherlock.
Sherlock had called him a conductor of light once. John would wonder - is he…? Or who is he talking about? Another person he’d call a conductor of light? John would sprain them.
wank in the shower to the thought of his flatmate, though his body aches for what had only begun to be promised as he kissed the man the night before.
"It's always you, Sherlock Holmes," he says with the softest chuckle, mirroring a declaration made striding up a reception aisle. "I met Mary because you were dead, and I suppose it makes sense that I'd replace the most dangerous person I'd ever known with someone just the same. Although it merits a mention that you're wonderful and thrilling in so many ways that she isn't.”
Sherlock is silk and stubble and pain and fear and love.
“Christ,” Lestrade mutters, pushing off the car to walk around to the driver’s side. John didn't realize he was standing so close, but the inspector is grinning under his sheepishness, so John ignores him and pulls Sherlock in by the jumper.
The years have been generous with Sherlock’s humanity, bringing compassion and sacrifice and love. John thinks he should have known that with the demolition of emotional guards, and the introduction of a romantic partnership, insecurity would only naturally follow.
Then he would fall silent for a moment. Sherlock would wait patiently, observing that John isn’t finished speaking.
He inhales through his nose. Several weeks on and the facts are no easier to bear. "But trust me to fall for that sort of woman, you know?"
and say hello!
But it’s better than what he’s leaving behind. “I do still want more.”
“And for christ’s sake, what are you two even wearing?” Lestrade’s voice cuts back in. “Don't tell me you- hell, you're the bloody
“Think of how much time we’ve wasted,” Sherlock finally replies, voice drowned in fresh tears. Lost. Heartbroken. John never wants to see that wretched expression on his face again.
There will be no way for them to say everything that needs to be said in this moment, but he hopes they’ll have time.
Standing in a garden of muted light and sound, it's almost easy for Sherlock to convince himself that he's simply escaping people as he has always been wont to do, that this is merely another exhausting social experience, not something much more personal.
He extends his arms. He falls forward.
He takes the cup and saucer, fingers brushing pale knuckles. Desire, anxiety, and the deepest love he’s ever known sweep up his veins, and his next action is instantaneous.
Sherlock inhales deep the crisp evening air, grateful for a respite from the crowd currently lavishing further congratulations on the newlyweds, before the evening festivities set in. His fingers move in subtle yet lithe maneuvers in midair, habitual preparation for the piece he will play during the customary first dance between bride and groom. He has never dreaded a violin performance more.
“Sherlock,” John had said, laughing. “I especially don’t care about that.”
“I love you,” he tells Sherlock. “Christ, I love you. And you’d better put that violin down right now.”
“Yeah, I think. You know what. I think I
and say hello!
“John, I’ve loved you for longer than you know.” Sherlock looks as overwhelmed as John feels, and the corners of his own eyes burn. “Please say you’ll stay. With Rosie. Forever. There will never be anything more important to me than the both of you.”
John had simply stared down at him, no reply forthcoming.
It is two days before he leaves the flat for takeaway and cigarettes, and two nights before he manages a proper sleep again.
He had attempted to initiate a conversation on the topic whilst planning how John would keep to normalcy after the wedding. John had sputtered that he'd take precaution and to leave it at that. Nevertheless, Sherlock lends concern to the idea, but tries to put faith in John that he can prevent it. Conceiving a child with Mary would change and complicate everything.
pair I've ever met, you know that?”
“Whatever bothers you, ever, we’ll get through it. I don’t care if your tea is more sugar than water. I don’t care if you’re in a strop sometimes. I don’t care if you only want to fuck once a week or once a month. I don’t care if you don’t eat or sleep for four days when we’re on a case. Well, I do care about that, but our rows about it won’t be enough to drive me off. Nothing ever will.”
He growls against the desire that coils within him, then keens as he closes a fist around the base of his erection, unable to control that particular primal urge. His hand slides up once and he shudders with a moan before he releases himself, turning to wrench the tap all the way in the other direction, wordlessly shouting all the things he can’t verbalize. He will
Sherlock Holmes has never made a habit of fear, or apprehension, or sentiment, especially. From age 13 on, he’s considered himself a man not plagued by such things at all. However, he reflects, stood before his mirror to secure a flower to the lapel of his best Spencer Hart, that was before John Watson.
They lapse into what once might have been a comfortable silence, drinking in their gratitude and fondness for the other. There's a nebulous assessment swirling in Sherlock's brain; out of the most common and pronounced tells of the
“I heard the fuss she gave you before she finally fell asleep,” Sherlock says, voice and smile soft. “I made sure this would be hot for when you came down.”
kiss you.”
With the dawn comes the profound weariness of remembering the previous evening’s events, and knowing John will be unreachable for at least as long as it will take to process them. There’s nothing more he’d like at this very moment, curled in his sheets with what feels suspiciously like the remnants of tears in his eyes, than for John to be here with him. He tells himself it’s purely for the knowledge that John would be safe, although it’s a lie. He also tells himself he’d be discontented with having another person around in his state of vulnerability, but this is a further untruth; he cannot recall a single instance in four years where he truly lamented John’s presence, and if anyone were to see him now, he’d damned well prefer his army doctor.
“Pardon?” He freezes.
Still singing 'Galway Bay'..”
“Movies. I’ve been watching some homosexual pornography as research for tonight. I wanted to be prepared to please you,” he said.
“I apologise for causing you pain,” I reply earnestly.
Before he fully realises it, he’s being pulled through the crowd to step on the tiny stage. It’s almost too small for them to share it, but John is undeterred.
A small smile plays at the corners of John’s lips. “Perfect, my sister says she lost her virginity under these silly rainbows. I’ve never had anal sex, or at least not like this. No one has ever been inside me, and Jesus Christ, Sherlock, I want it to be you  - only you.”
John adjusts so that their pajama clad erections are lined up then thrusts upward. His hands plant on the firm globes of Sherlock’s arse and slowly moves against him. The high pitched groan that escapes from Sherlock is surprising and endearing.
“Let's clean you up a bit.” I hand him the flannel.
“You think there will be a next time?” He asked sourly.
It's no place for the old
“I know, Shez. You're one of the good’uns.” He nods. “I can take a few bills off, for Christmas.”
I can see a better time
John tips his face up to Sherlock.
I've built my dreams around you..”
"I'm trying to slow us down. This isn't just tonight, right? You want this to be... permanent?" John asks.
Today is exceptionally warm for London. Unfortunately, his car’s cooling unit is only working intermittently. The fetid air cools for a moment before it grinds to halt. At least, he has a seat. Granted, he's wedged between a wall and a large man who reeks of day old garlic.
Heat floods his cheeks. Sherlock can’t tell if he’s in key or if his voice even sounds pleasant. A few mouths pop open in the crowd.
“Then I guess we’ll skip the prep work?” he asks.
“Know of him, but never had the misfortune,” I say.
“You know, you’re welcome to come by for dinner.” Lestrade zips up his five year old London Fog knock off. “It’s Christmas Eve, after all.”
“I could have been someone..”
The Rare Old Mountain Dew.”
“I'm pleased I inspire such response,” I smile. Contentment embraces me as his head rests on my chest, our limbs entwined.
Instead, I moved away just in time to hear a car door slam. I ran to the window to see Clara and Harry standing on either side of Clara’s car - screaming like banshees over the hood.
This wasn't at all like I thought it would be. I had had daydreams of our bodies just sliding together effortlessly. I would fill him with pleasure, and he would beg for release. Sherlock wasn't the only one watching gay porn to prepare for tonight.
So, yeah. We've been together ever since. I mean, in school we're just friends. We haven't started holding hands or snogging. Well, not in the open. Great thing about Sherlock is that he knows the best hiding places. And we've snogged in everyone of them.
I turn my eyes forward and really look at the bloody tree. I had failed to notice all the ornaments, most of them old and done by hand. I see paper mache balls, painted wooden sticks, and cardboard stars - all signed by a young John Watson. His past is twinkling right before me.
"I would have never envisioned this," Sherlock murmurs.
I chuckle lightly. “I won’t last…”
With a groan, a man coughs and spits on the ground. I can hear panting as I approach the mouth of the alley.
The guttural noises emanating from his throat should not affect me as they do, but my cock definitely twitches like it hasn't in ages. For God’s sake, not now, I admonish myself.
“Yes, I mean, no...no pain,” he shakes his head.
I pull the collar up around my neck. He means well, but I can’t think of anything I would rather do less. Actually, I can - spend time with my brother.
John shakes his head.
“Fuck, Sherlock...Oh God...oh yes, Sherlock…” He says my name in a way no one ever has. Like a whisper or a prayer or a vow. He kisses my back, my shoulder blades, and my neck. For a moment, I feel owned and almost precious. I’m not a genius or party trick. I am John’s and nothing more.
John stepped out of Sherlock's arms. “Good. I have missed you.”
“Sure will.” He beams. “I'll be seeing her later.”
Came in eighteen to one..”
“Why don’t you, then?” I challenge.
John Watson ‘Can’t be too silent with music.’
“My bed is only a twin, so….I can sleep on the sofa and you take the bed,” he offers.
I heard a voice - female. Fuck, Harry. By the sounds of it, she and Clara were having a serious row in our driveway.
“I bet you have your share of enemies,” he muses.
“Where did you learn that?” I asked. I mean, he had said he was a virgin too. He didn’t act like one though.
Out for Christmas Day!”
“Do that again,” Sherlock moans.
“I’m staying with my sister a few blocks from here.” He limps beside me.
"Jesus," John mutters before plunging his tongue between those delicious lips and pulling Sherlock against his body. An electric shock shoots through his body when a very prominent erection presses into his hip.
He looked uncertain.
He sits beside me, and I feel his body heat. “The shine of the holidays has dulled for me too. I was happy to be left alone.” He turns his head toward me. “But I am glad you are here.”
He blinks a few times. “Yeah, if you want.”
Queen of New York City..”
Sherlock takes one step back to fully appreciate the grandeur of the bedroom - from the plush azure rug, frilled bedspread littered with bright rainbows, and arched canopy with even more rainbows. A young Harriet Watson once had lain in this small twin bed to sleep under an avalanche of crescent colours.
Christ, he was right. I grabbed the lube and smeared it on my cock. Carefully, so I wouldn't come in my hands and all over his back. I moved behind him, and positioned my cock between his arse cheeks.
“I only agreed to let you patch me up, not analyse me.” He tugs his arm out of grip. The movement has torn the wound again, and fresh blood collects to drip from his arm.
“That's uncomfortable,” he gasps.
John smiles and my stomach flips a few times. The feeling is unwelcomed as I don't ‘do’ attraction. Sex is biological and rarely necessary with another person. Yet this short soldier covered in his own blood is affecting me. This is dangerous indeed. While he might not be homosexual, he has experienced before. I had seen his eyes take an appreciative sweep over me. He thinks I'm posh, but he's also attracted to me.
I look at my surroundings. “The police will come from this direction, so let's move in the opposite. Do you live near?”
“Your sister is an active alcoholic, yes.” I lean forward to rest my elbows on my knees.
I stand naked and alone in a sitting room choking with Christmas cheer. I pour myself another shot of vodka while I wait for John's return. Down the hall, I hear him mumbling and slamming cabinet doors. His feet pad against the floor as he moves further down the hall. I look down at this body John finds so enticing, and I don’t understand it. Suddenly, I am ashamed of the marks on my arms. It shows my weakness despite all my attempts to be cavaliere about my drug use. I’m a certified genius and fully aware that injecting drugs is an idiotic thing to do - no matter what I try to convince myself otherwise.
“Just a second,” he panted.
We crawled into my bed, and the sheets were cold on our skin. Carefully, I inched my way over to kiss him again. Feeling his cock against my stomach, I wasn’t prepared for how good it felt. I hooked my leg over his hip and rubbed my cock against his pelvic bone.
“Do you think anything is broken?” I ask.
“Sure. But can I see you before we do?” I asked.
“But you were in the army. Loads of men,” I say.
“Sleeps like the dead. How do you think Harry got a terrible reputation at school? She shagged half the girls in her class in this bed,” John says.
His hands slip past the small of my back to grab two handfuls of my arse. I hum my approval against his mouth. Fingertips graze my entrance. Against my will, I gasp.
“I want to. I brought everything.”
“It won’t hurt for long, not when it’s you.” John presses her forehead to Sherlock’s. “Don’t make me beg, Holmes.”
“Read there. You know this one. You said this one didn’t make you ill,” John points to the teleprompter to the side of the stage.
“You said you are just a user. Who am I to judge? I got blind stinking drunk and begged a bunch of thugs to kill me.” He clinks his glass to mine. “Happy Christmas.”
A spark ignites between us when my fingers touch his skin. I feel him take a deep breath.
“Why would you think I'd have antibiotics?” He stops.
Again, his tongue slips over his lips. Definite interest.
“Let's stop. We'll just touch each other.”
“I'm sorry about that,” I said. “Harry.”
“Yes, with my right hand if you don’t fuck me soon,” I snap.
Instead, he perches by the bar to nurse his last scotch and stares at the stage without really seeing anything. He ducks back into his mind palace to relive decorating the Christmas tree at Baker Street. Not since he was ten years old has he enjoyed Christmas. Once the magic dissipates, it is a garish holiday with terrible music and forced interaction with soppy people.
“Uh sure. Are you a doctor?” he asks.
"Two things I obsessed over - Elle McPherson and David Beckham." John shrugs lightly.
“It's been a very, very long time since I've managed that,” he gasps.
"Yes, carried by wine and Christmas spirit, yes. Now." Sherlock's voice is strong, yet a layer of uncertainty lurks underneath.
He gives my cock a squeeze. “I want to bend you over this sofa and fuck you into Christmas morning.”
He can't focus on anything beyond his thundering heart. All of a sudden, John is being tactile in a way he's only been with girlfriends.
“I didn’t think you wanted this. Your body is just transport. You barely feed it, so I didn’t think giving it pleasure was important.” John shrugs lightly.
Sherlock's lips twitch in an almost smirk. "It's somewhere under the rainbow mattress."
Quickly, I retrieve my mobile from the front pocket in my trousers. Despite the time, I send Mycroft an order. I don’t expect a response at four AM on Christmas morning, but it is Mycroft. He protests, not surprising. After two more messages, he relents with ‘As you wish. Happy Christmas’. I turn off my phone and toss it on top of my clothes.
Until a yellowing spotlight hits a tiny stage in the corner of the pub and people clamour upon it to sing. It's bloody well awful. Sherlock considers taking this moment as a cue to leave. Perhaps he and John can pour a final drink for the night to revel in the evening’s festivities. They can chuckle over Molly and Greg in a darkened snug. They can ruminate about the poor choices being made at that very moment as inebriation fuels lust. Maybe John would finally give Sherlock a clear sign of attraction, something he could build on.
“I don't think you can see it from your angle, but the cut is serrated, not clean. The end didn't pierce you, but the edges cut into your skin. If the knife had been sharp, the wound would have been jagged but not like this.”
Sherlock pushed back against me. “Come on.”
Tonight was the night Sherlock and I were going to take the next step.
“For as long as you want. I have a second bedroom if you wish privacy, but you are very welcome to stay with me, in my room.”
Still singing 'Galway Bay'
“No!” He nearly shouted. “I want to belong to you tonight. I want to be yours.”
He stares at my hand suspiciously. Accepting my offer is his best bet at the moment. He crawls off of the fat man, but not before kicking him soundly in the bollocks. The heavy man grabs his crotch and rolls to his side groaning. I'm sure I hear a threat on our lives as he coughs. The sirens draw closer and we need to get out of this alley.
“Yes. I'm feeling crusty.” He glances down at his stomach.
Now, I want to cut myself open so John can crawl inside me. John, a man that I have known for less than a few hours, is the center of the universe.
We haven't told anyone but my friend Mike and his friend Molly. No parents yet. We're going to wait until after we're at university and already sharing a room. We can't wait for that. At uni, you can be whatever you want. No one expects you to be the rugby star who shags all the girls in school. You don't have to hide that you're in love with the smartest boy in your class and can't wait to share yourself with him.
An unusually warm December night greets them. Sherlock steps to the edge of the kerb and raises his arm for a taxi.
“John Watson.” He takes a deep breath before he continues down the street.
He gives me a wary glance before unbuttoning his shirt. “It's not that bad.”
The heavyset man is the first to speak. “Hey, you better fuck off. Nothing for you here.”
He hears a chuckle above him. The train stops again. Luckily, John is heading home for the day but his stomach growls. He skipped lunch and it’s well past dinner time. He thinks of the bare cupboards at home and wonders what kind of takeaway is nearby. Maybe he’d pop in at D’Arcy’s Pub for a pint and some chips. Curry chips.
I pray God
This is not my business. My affairs lay under a floorboard in my kitchen, carefully wrapped and packaged in a wooden cigar box.
With a smile that rivals the star on top of the tree at Rockefeller Center, John presses his hand between Sherlock’s shoulder blades.
John side-glances the detective with surprise. He knows that insults and bellows of disgust are bouncing off the walls of Sherlock's mind palace.
"I'm so close," John chokes out. "Touch me."
And that was tonight.
Sherlock raises his hand. "I could deduce what book, but why ruin the surprise?"
Sherlock Holmes ‘Flatmates should know the worst about one another.’
“Are you okay?” I whispered over his shoulder.
I take the damp flannel but nearly choke when I see John sat on the sofa; his bare chest decorated in the blues, greens, reds and yellows from the Christmas tree.  Taking a deep breath, I sit beside him.
I shove away the feeling of sympathy and melancholy. I'm not here for dinner, but pass through the kitchen door.
Sherlock attacks his mouth again. He could live on the tip of John’s tongue - christ the things that muscle could do. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
He takes a deep breath.
The warmth of the smile resting on Sherlock's lips goes directly to John's cock.
“When the band finished playing
Sherlock hates Christmas music. It is cheerful and syrupy. It is never about real life or emotions. Though Sherlock every attempt to tamp down the things he feels for John, the words that slip out of his mouth ring so true. Last year had been trying with consequences that had brought John home. Perhaps this year will be a time of rebuilding trust to something deeper.
Eventually, he relaxed. As my hands moved lower, between his shoulders, to the small of his back, then to his arse, he pushed back against me as he let out sighs and small moans. Carefully, I flipped open the lubricant bottle and covered a finger.
“You must be joking,” Sherlock scoffs.
“Harry and Clara,” John says as he sets a worn leather doctor’s bag on the table. “They're at Clara’s family home for the holiday.”
“I'm a drug user. Addict is such a strong term.” A lump forms in my throat.
I hear the rip of a condom foil, followed by the pop of the baby oil bottle.
John stretched his arms in front of him to shake off the lingering emotional electricity between them. “So, your birthday. We should do something, right? Cake?”
“Hmm, definitely bruised. Do you have something for pain?” I press my palm to his back and feel him swallow roughly.
John nods his head down the hall. "Come on, my room is that way and a bit less garish."
“Oh very good, too good. All the good,” John gasps.
On a drip in that bed…”
Sherlock feels a swoon wash over him like a tragic heroine in one of the trashy novels Mycroft denies ever possessing. John is lit from within like the Christmas display at Harrod’s. Festive. Joyful. Beautiful. How can he deny this man anything?
“You've no idea.” The corner of my mouth twitches as I think of the long list. “Why did you say that you wanted to die?”
You maggot
The Spirit of Christmas has visited this flat and clearly vomited on every surface. Lighted miniature villages, statues of Father Christmas, stockings, more lights all lead to a Christmas tree stuffed in the corner of the room. It's too full for the room as the branches spill over an armchair beside it.
“Are you okay? If you're not sure.” He pulls hands away.
Out for Christmas day..”
Broadway was waiting for me..”
"You know, I've never had sex with a man in MY bed," John offers cheekily.
John chuckles and shares his phone screen with the tall man before him. “Mr. Holmes. Consulting detective?”
“Christ no. You're amazing! We'll get it right,” I rolled to my side.
“You were handsome…”
As we climb the stairs, my nose is assaulted with the heavy scent of pine. John unlocks the door and pushes it open to allow me to step in first.
The pizza sat on the kitchen counter, but we opened the wine. So my mum would not suspect anything, we used regular juice glasses. I prefer beer - I’ve had a few pints at various rugby parties - but Sherlock assured me this was the good stuff.
“They've got cars
John quickly moves down the hall to what I suspect is the kitchen. I close my eyes and burn the vision of his torso into my mind. Firm chest. Softer belly, had been tighter while in service. Taut shoulders. And the wound, a starburst of knotted skin on his shoulder. What would it feel like under my fingertips, or my tongue?
He shakes his head. “How could you possibly know that?”
The victim watches me as if I'm the maddest person he's ever seen. I give him the briefest of nod and he knows that I'm not drunk or wanting a cigarette. He leans back on his heels to grab a fistful of snow and wait for my signal.
Both Sherlock and John had felt the boundaries of their relationship shift in recent weeks. Nothing dangerous had precipitated to draw them closer, just two people slowly awakening to their attraction and importance to each other. Lingering glances and touches had fueled warmth blossoming across cheeks. Many times, Sherlock had opened his mouth to address it once and for all. Just to lay his heart on the table and get it out in the open. But the moment would always disappear, along with his courage.
Immediately, I rush over to help him.
“It’s Christmas Eve, in the drunk tank
“What have you got on, Shez?” Billy returns to washing the same pot. “Dinner with the family?”
“I’m close,” he pants. “God, you’re so tight, so amazing, so fucking amazing…”
If I'm going to act, it's now. Closing my eyes, I envision the scene in the alley. I hear no click of a gun, but recall the gleam of a blade. The skittish one will run, and the slight one is only looking for another fix. He'll be easy to disarm. Hopefully the victim has a bit of fight in him. Together, the heavyset one can be overcome.
John holds my gaze, his eyes slipping to my lips before catching my eye. His pupils dilate a little.
And the bells are ringing
He nods. “I don't think they are broken but to be sure.”
I roll my eyes with some annoyance. “I consult for the police when they are out of their depth which is always. I am the world’s sole consulting detective as there is no one like me.”
“Fuck!” he growls as I slowly pull the cloth away from his skin.
Mike Stamford ‘Anyone looking for a flatmate?’
The other table, well, I look away. I see everything in one glance. Man in his early 70’s no children. He reads a weathered copy of Jane Eyre, his wife’s favourite. She had passed early in Autumn.
You promised me
“The bathroom is…” His voice trails off as I move to the bathroom without direction.
“Your fucking sister.” Sherlock scrambled to the bathroom with his clothes balled up in his hands.
“You're not that big, John.” That arsehole. I swear he said just so I would roll him over and fuck him mercilessly. And I nearly did because he was so bloody gorgeous, sprawled naked on my bed - offering his arse for me.
The sensation of John's hand tightening in his hair shoots straight to between his legs. He realises he needs to do something with his hands. They wrestle with the hem of John's vest, hungry to touch skin.
“I'll join you. It might help you sleep.” I settle back against the cushions.
We had discussed how our first time would be. We had two options - 1) him fucking me or 2) me fucking him. I wasn’t sure I was ready for option 1. I told him it was okay just do handjobs and maybe a blowjob.
It's a blended scotch, but it warms on the way down. The Met Christmas party is almost bearable after three pours of it. Almost. Sherlock feels fuzzy and a little numb, just enough to take the edge off his tongue. As far as parties go, this one isn't too bad.
“Fucking Harry,” I growled.
John opens Sherlock Holmes’ profile. He can’t see the man’s face, only a silhouette of a man with unruly hair seated in a black leather chair. A silk dressing gown pools around him. John decides he looks too bloody regal. Under occupation: Consulting Detective. Birthday: January 6. Lives in London. No other information. He clicks on the photo album to find only photos of several types of...is that ash? And different types of cakes and pies. Odd. His phone pings with a notification.
John groans.
Sherlock peers up. "What kind of monstrous childhood do you think I had?"
“Then get on sofa on all fours. You say you hate Christmas, but I want you to remember this one. I want to those Christmas lights dance on your skin when I sink into you…” he says huskily in my ear.
“It's not your fault. This is all my own bloody doing.” He shakes his head.
“I'm not gonna kill ya, but I'll make you wish you was dead,” the heavyset one growls.
John glanced up from his phone, something familiar and brilliant flashed in his eyes. And there it was, the first genuine smile Sherlock had seen from John in a very long time, even before Mary died. “Thai sounds great, Sherlock.”
“John, you should know that I play the violin at all hours, and sometimes I don't talk for days when I'm on a case. I think potential flatmates should know the worst about one another.” I stand.
“Fifteen grand,” he scowls.
“Fuck.” And I flipped us over so I was on top.
“Harry loves Christmas.” John winces as he shrugs off his coat.
"Hmm," Sherlock mumbles while exploring all sides of John's mouth. He finds he doesn't care about the wine and sleep stale breath.
John thinks of his tiny bedsit with its creaky bed and barely warm hotplate.
The blond soldier punches him squarely in the teeth. “I should gut you right here.”
John frowns. Who the hell is the Holmes person?
“It could be a bad idea, but it’s the only one I have right now.” He palms my crotch and rubs.
I felt the tight knot that I knew was his entrance. I gave a tentative push, and was shocked that his body opened for me. It was different than I thought it would feel. My finger was surrounded by tight but smooth muscle. I pushed further inside, and it hit me. I was inside Sherlock. We were connected. It made my cock throb with want. I needed to feel closer.
A seductive smile curls on John's lips. "You gorgeous bastard. Tell me you're close."
I offer the soldier my hand. “Police are coming. I know I shouldn't be here and I doubt you want to be as well.”
The headboard crashes against the garish yellow wall every time their bodies meet. The room is filled with the scent of the cucumber melon perfumed lotion liberally used for lubrication.
"Will she be mad?" Sherlock asks as he floats somewhere between sleep and euphoria.
Wrapping his fingers around the flushed member, he peers at John’s head thrown back in ecstasy. “Is this good?”
“I'm sorry.” John’s voice cracked.
Mrs. Watson shuffles down the hall to descend the stairs and attend to her pies.
"I have much to show you...tomorrow night. Mum will be up before dawn and we'll be up soon after." John yawns.
“Perhaps, but I have no interest in most people.” I'm desperate to have his hands on me. All this talk of how fuckable I seem has me craving that moment when he and I become one. “You however, John Watson, interest me greatly. You're fascinating.”
“Oh Christ,” he gasps.
Sherlock Holmes ‘It’s two bedrooms. How do you feel about long periods of silence and the violin?’
“What? For the night?” he asks.
“Where you were stationed, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“William!” I call.
“You could say that.” I tip back the glass and let the vodka burn my throat. It tastes a grade above rubbing alcohol, but it should still numb my fraying nerves.
"We can fondly call it the rainbow connection. The lovers, the dreamers and loss of virginity. Jim Henson would weep." Sherlock moves closer to John's side.
The dishwasher jumps from the basin where moments before he had spent four minutes washing the same pot. By his eyes, I see that Billy Wiggins has started to celebrate early.
“Why did we take so long to do this?” Sherlock’s lips move against John’s shoulder.
He might have the best drugs, but the worst memory. I hand him a wad of bills and pocket the bags.
“And you want me?” he asks.
“John, I’ve never done that...to anyone. I wouldn’t know what to do.” Sherlock’s hips cant against John slowly.
John beams with the words. Sherlock nudges him.
“The boys of the NYPD choir
John wiped the tears from his cheek with the back of his hand. “Yes. I need to see her.” He lifted his eyes to meet Sherlock’s. “You too. You should see her.”
“No, but the sentiment was there.” I pause. “You hate being home, you’d rather be on the front lines. You feel useless here…”
“Not for quite some time. I’m out of practise…” His body turns in my direction.
"Happy Christmas, Mrs. Watson." Sherlock nods.
“Fuck off, I said,” he warns me.
**James Sholto has updated his relationship status to ‘in a relationship’.
Sherlock and I lied on my bed and stared at the ceiling. Technically, we were no longer virgins, but it wasn't what either of us thought it'd be.
It would be closer to the clinic and Harry.
I take a shortcut down a dark side street that I would normally avoid at night. The wind bites so bitterly that even the most harden criminals are most likely parked on a bar stool. Muted light from the windows above spill onto the snow to guide my way. Voices float up from an alleyway off the street. They appear conversational, and I pay no mind. Maybe I could ask for a smoke. The cold stings my lungs in a clean and unpleasant manner. As I draw closer, the tone is definitely menacing from the alley. Two heavies and one victim.
"You've never done this, have you? You want..."John searches for the right words.
Sherlock sighs. That thought is silly and dangerous at the same time. John has been in various stages of inebriation with Sherlock, and never once has he shown a clear sign. And now, the good doctor is flush with beer, and Sherlock suspects a shot or two of something else, and cheering on the singers with hoots and enthusiastic clapping. If Sherlock leaves, it will be alone.
The hunger in Sherlock's eyes tosses John off kilter. He's certain that no matter what words of experience he's to offer, Sherlock will still swallow him whole.
Of course, he wants an explanation. They always do.
John plants his knees on either side of Sherlock. "Let me move first."
“The evidence of my indiscretions. You'd be foolish to not be wary. It proves you've not suffered head trauma.” I grin.
John props himself up on his elbows and squints at the glowing red numbers on the alarm clock on the white dresser across the room.  "And you needed to do this at two in the morning?"
The words strike Sherlock in a way he had not expected.
We started kissing the moment he walked in the door. His lips are incredible - soft and full. God, what he can do with his tongue. When I’m in bed at night, I think about that tongue on my cock - Christ, I can’t last more than a minute. We haven’t done more than some rubbing up against each other and a hasty handjob in his bedroom while doing ‘homework.’ We wanted to have a proper first time, with wine and music. When my parents made their plans, I knew it was the perfect opportunity.
“You're fucking nutters,” the soldier says, but there's a hint of a smile.
“Until you, it never was. My body never craved those things until you arrived. Now it is all I can think about. My mind palace has turned into one of those videos you try to delete from your browser.” Sherlock moves his hips against John. The coarse hairs of John’s pelvis tickle and excite Sherlock’s sensitive head.
“Let’s get undressed,” I said.
“I assure you that I didn't save your life just to take it.” I wave my hand casually about the flat. “There is absolutely nothing here of any real value, and I have no designs on forcing myself on you.”
His lips and hands had slowed, and he’d pulled back with a half smile, certain of his next action but unsure of what the reception might be. He’d stood, crossed to his laptop, queued a song, and pulled Sherlock to sit on the sofa with him.
“Right. It’s not okay. Not right now. But that doesn’t make this less true. There’s nothing else for me.”
John's steady weight anchors him to these new sensations, and he imagines his body could continue on quite sufficiently without his mind, but John abruptly shifts back a few inches. With bodies pressed together, Sherlock knows a devastating desire in those seconds that stretch into centuries.
It’s tentative, and different, and laden with inexperience on Sherlock’s part. But it’s incredible, it’s healing, it’s home.
“What about. Now?” He pulls back far enough to look at the man before him, the man who used to sneer at love and call it a defect. The man who has become more human than anyone John has ever known. The man John has loved for years.
John glances at him. "I swear, Sherlock, when you first told me I wanted to be angry. I left the flat and walked around and I just wanted to come back and rage at you, before I realized how ridiculous that was, of course. So I thought I'd settle for resenting the frankly maddening way you seem to take over everything in my life."
Sherlock doesn't reply at first, winded by an abrupt wave of fondness that is at once completely alien to him, and perfectly at home in his chest as he stares at John Watson.
John's name is a muffled howl into his pillow that evening as his toes curl and his fingers stroke debilitating pleasure from every sinew in his body.
John’s bed has never felt as warm as it does now, with Sherlock climbing in beside him. Long limbs are folded uncertainly before John reaches out for a pale shoulder, murmuring the other man’s name, and Sherlock turns, their breath ghosting together under the duvet.
John would glance back at him, confused for a moment, then intrigued, and then-
The cup rattles in the saucer as he attempts to shift even closer, lips and tongue now moving against Sherlock’s, desperate and burning with a million missed opportunities. He remembers the spindly table near the door with great relief, and breaks away to set the saucer atop a small stack of books balanced upon it, and pull down a shaking breath.
“Now, to business.”
John wakes to the sound of the Stradivarius floating through the door of their bedroom.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice is low, intimate, only for him in this scant space they’ve carved, emotion choking the word, and John is drowning. His breath shudders as the tears fall, overcome as he is with the depth of his affection and need.
He wants to kiss Sherlock, desperately.
“What if I never stop saying things that are not good?” Sherlock had asked him. “What if I sulk one too many times after a row about the shopping or acceptable sleeping times or the fact that I’ve deleted some social courtesy or other?”
“You taste like bergamot.”
, as neither his bride nor the day and its events can be bringing him any contentment. His heart rate picks up and he straightens his posture in exasperation, thankful for the dark of night which would corroborate dilated pupils.
“Are you ready to hear it?” His lips quiver. His fingers move to latch onto John’s arms.
admit this to himself, now). He cannot understand boundaries, cannot respect social expectations, cannot do anything to quell his need for John Watson. He's wondered before just how inconvenient this is for his flatmate and now-
Feel free to stop by my tumblr, also
“You never drank Earl Grey here.”
The response comes immediately, which is unexpected. The pleasant swooping in Sherlock's chest is even more so.
This could be the one they don’t miss.
He straightens up out of bed, reaching for his mobile. Hm. Lestrade probably wouldn't have appreciated a text in the middle of the night anyway.
He glances at the man sitting to his side and his next words threaten to stick in his throat. His eyes close briefly, and open again, as he forces himself to continue as planned.
John smiles at how, despite everything, Sherlock is still Sherlock.
I thought of this and it pleased me so I wrote it, even though it's a short blurb lmao.
“Sherlock.” John says into Sherlock’s chest. He raises one foot over the edge, over the vast abyss.
He shakes his head to clear the strange and distracting emotions, and wills John’s hallmark courage to see them through the next seven weeks and beyond.
Imagine John and Sherlock watching Doctor Who, and they hear River’s line about Twelve - “When you love the doctor, it’s like loving the stars themselves. You don’t expect a sunset to admire you back.”
There's a moment, then, certainly not the first of its kind (nor the last, Sherlock imagines), where they share a glance rife with mutual appreciation and understanding. Now however, words, which have always been unnecessary, are begging to be spoken in intimate reverence, and in this Sherlock feels a shift from their standard.
“John, say you're alright.”
"Sherlock, he'll be alright," a voice - Lestrade's - says. "He's... ah hell, Sherlock... look, he's coming round now, let him up, you
John laughs because Sherlock is rambling now, actually babbling on while his hold on the purple shirt hasn't lessened a bit, and his head swims with the desire to kiss Sherlock and pull up confession after confession of his own. Hmm. Perhaps not the concussion after all.
he thinks, straightening the cream tie at his throat.
He opens his mouth, but can’t think of the proper thing to ask (is John angry or upset or did he kick anything else or did he talk to anyone), so he closes it again. Better than saying sorry for a third time. John’s lips quirk as he takes in Sherlock’s struggle, and Sherlock actually feels the weight in his chest begin to lift at the sight. It stuns him sometimes, the way his own reactions end up tied to John’s, when he’s never had that with any human being before.
“I’m in love with you,” he tells Sherlock without preamble, hands clutching broad shoulders beneath a silken dressing gown. “And I always fucking have been.”
John begins to pull back. "Sherlock, I've had weeks to think about all this-"
“Well, sometimes a person might prefer… what’s the phrase? A pretty lie over an ugly truth?” Sherlock is suddenly overcome with the esteem in which he holds his friend. “But I have never taken you for such a person, John.”
Sherlock is looking at him now with more concern than he thinks he's ever seen in those light eyes, and for a moment he imagined he sees unshed tears there, but it must be a trick of the flashing lights and his own questionable perception at the moment.
“Needed a break too?”
, John thinks. This has been building between them since he returned to Baker Street, since Sherlock came back from the dead, since the very first day they met.
“You were saying there are so many things you've always meant to tell me?”
Sherlock shifts under the weight of a heavy internal sigh, faced with tables of guests in a reception hall shining in shades of yellow. He’s reaching the end of his best man’s speech, a joint effort between himself and John (save for the segments of his own veneration of John) in the name of remaining convincing throughout this entire ordeal, though the challenge of delivery had fallen to him. He’s nearly pulled it off, they’ve nearly completed the charade, but there’s a weariness in him (that he’s strived to disregard), a mental fatigue that began as John stood at the altar with Mary.
Nothing is okay. But this is comfortable.
“Yes, perhaps you should.”
“Really, John? The sun makes perfect sense to me. Conductor of light and all.” Sherlock would say, feeling bold, glancing over as his lips would quirk to one side.
The tea goes cold. John is consoled by the idea that there will be more, for the rest of their lives.
He thinks of ringing John, but that would be worse, he reasons, though he is desperate to hear John's voice.
He texts John, once a day. The first time he stares at his phone for entirely too long before settling on:
“I’m not the same man who missed his chances before. I’m taking them now, but it won’t be as easy.”
He pulls up in his mind an image of Ms. Hudson’s ludicrous hat at the wedding and recites the periodic table backwards by name in an effort to dispel his erection and lose consciousness.
expect is that Mycroft will ask for details, or scold him for the jibe about sweets, or pick at him further for his sulking. He rolls to his side, putting Mycroft out of his mind, and falls into a restless sleep with a hand down his pyjamas and an army doctor in his unconscious.
He opens his mouth, shaking his head just so in confusion, before the memory comes to him.
Even after his sobs subside, and he’s lowered his hand from his face to the back of that expensive blue dressing gown, Sherlock continues to hold him.
Never before, though, has he had memories of John Watson’s hands pulling him in, John Watson’s voice low with desire, and John Watson’s lips on his. His next breath comes out a hiss, transforming into a snarl of frustration as his hips buck and he throws himself onto his stomach.
Tears begin at the corner of John’s eyes, blistering, fitting given the tender burn within him, and he finds he does not care. Here in the quiet comfort of the bed, his throat swells and he knows he is in love, irrevocable and sublime. This man who has saved his life, has been saved in return, and who now slides a hand past the collar of his jumper, is all he will ever need. Sherlock is eternity.
Since the onset of puberty, Sherlock has mastered the ability to ignore the more inconvenient facets of his anatomy. Barring the times he has given in for the sake of relieving tension, significantly few and far between, he has never had trouble disregarding an erection.
He holds Sherlock’s gaze, now, watching lashes blink rapidly over those incredible eyes, the music swelling through the flat. Whether the detective is confused or moved or perhaps just staring at him as he usually does, John can’t tell.
Grimace. Delete.
Sherlock casts a somnolent eye at his mobile, and then back at Mycroft.
? You deserve so much.”
He stays the course, refusing for the moment to dissect any thoughts he might have toward John’s marriage that aren’t related to immediate concern for his best friend's safety. The disquiet has been there longer than this plan, longer than the threat, he knows; ever since he entered the Landmark to find John sat with a woman, ever since he returned to Baker Street alone, it’s been there. But for now, he tells himself it’s about keeping John safe.
Sherlock would be clueless. John would clear his throat and turn his head back to the telly.
It’s not okay. It’s not now, and it won’t be, John doesn’t know for how long. But he has Sherlock. That’s all he’s ever had. And they will get through.
Trust John to work out what he refused to look at directly. Trust John bloody Watson to do something about it.
John had rocked back on his heels then, suddenly coursing with no small measure of arousal, drawing in a deep breath to will himself back to the topic at hand. The blush that spread across Sherlock’s face would have been thoroughly distracting, were it not for the wounded expression underneath.
Well, he can’t deny it to himself, he thinks, bare legs swinging over the side of the bed as he stands to head for the bathroom. The concern for John’s safety, or ability to keep up the pretense, is not what plagues him most about the honeymoon. He steps out of his pants, kicks them into the hall along with his discarded suit, and turns the shower tap to as hot as it allows. He can’t help it now, can’t help picturing John taking Mary to bed, can’t help the revulsion and distress (and yearning, for John) that claws through his chest, he just
Sherlock had raised his eyes, looking embarrassed and yet impatient. “You know. Sexually.”
I had never heard this song before (by your side by Sade), but my dear friend shawleyleres on tumblr asked me for a song fic and I jumped on it :)
“Well, I should hope it goes without saying, John, but I'll be by your side in everything.”
Sherlock thinks stubbornly). “For telling me.”
With a stretch of limbs that dislodges his sheets, he relishes the morning chill that sharpens his senses and allows him to think, before he groans and considers he might like to stop thinking altogether. He rises to a sitting position, head buried in his palms. This is the part he has dreaded most: the Sex Holiday. Or honeymoon, as he’s told ordinary people refer to it. Before even the garden or his altered emotions, knowing that John would have to keep up the charade on his own, and play happy couples alongside a clueless someone with whom his relationship had been destroyed, gave Sherlock over to fret.
“I texted,” says his brother, sniffing in disdain, no doubt at the containers of takeaway and unwashed sheets.
The music starts. John’s lips quirk up to one side and he runs his fingertips over the back of the pale hand he holds in his lap.
The threat is clever as well, he concedes, though he'll never give it the credit he gives to John's nature. All he can do today is stand at John's side and keep faith with the only two things he's ever
“John,” Sherlock repeats, more urgently, and John turns again to look at him, another visual snippet of the evening coming back to him: Sherlock catching him with one arm as he falls from the blow of the pistol, and punching the assailant square in the jaw with the other.
He is greeted in the sitting room by an image he knows will be imprinted in his mind until the day he dies, and perhaps longer than that - Sherlock, back to John as he faces out the window, curls dancing as he moves with the music he plays.
But part of him knows that it will be easier, in a sense. They’re embracing by the fire at Baker Street. They’ve gone further than they ever have. It’s all been spoken in the ridiculous manner they have always had. And they understand each other perfectly.
Sherlock’s expression doesn’t change, though John had expected it to. He simply blinks, eyes burning into John’s. He nods. John can feel their hearts racing alongside one another.
He forces a small smile as Mary sweeps John away into the crowd, aware in a far corner of his brain that the DJ has cued an upbeat song, unfair in contrast to the pain inside him. Horrifying tears prick at his eyes as he finally gives voice to the thought that he's not just losing a blogger or a crime scene helpmate. John is
Standing in the dark, with what he would think to call heartache searing every fibre of his body, he is reminded of why he has avoided emotional entanglements for the better part of his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
to this, Sherlock knows he will defend this connection at all costs.
He steps under the blistering stream of water, thankful for the way it sears his skin and sends up steam to dizzy him, though it’s but a fleeting reprieve from his brooding. His thoughts simmer into hazy memory, a heated kiss, smoldering eyes, and languid breath flooding every corner of his mind. He tries valiantly not to imagine John having intercourse, tries to discourage the sudden blood flow to his groin, and fails.
“Of course I never was. And of course it’s not the Woman.”
No. Sherlock doesn't want to interpret these things. It's easier that it's just John come to see where he'd gone, John perhaps wanting to share in relief that the vows and the speeches have passed flawlessly, John suggesting they return to the reception.
They remain enveloped in scent and warmth and salt water until, nearly asleep, they move centimeters, as one, for their lips to meet. Soft, light, but scorching. John kisses Sherlock, tranquil and warm, and waits for tomorrow.
“What if I can’t…” Sherlock had flapped a hand in the air and thrown himself down in his chair. “Satisfy you?”
after what happened in the garden.
“There's my confident John,” Sherlock teases with his usual feline smile. “And as it stands, we have quite a lot of time. We're waiting on Scotland Yard.”
Sherlock’s brows pull down. John gives a small, amused shake of the head in response.
"Well, good night. I hope Elle isn't too distracting." John offers a shy grin.
John steps forward, crowding Sherlock’s space.
“Add another,” he growled.
I removed my fingers. “You sure?”
Reluctantly, John pulls back to look at Sherlock's swollen mouth. Christ, it is so obscene that he could come from staring at it too long.
John purses his lips. With a tight nod, he inches closer. “Don't wrap my arm too tight.”
“Ready?” John asks.
“It wasn't a complete failure. You felt amazing. I'm sorry it hurt so much. Next time it will be better,” I said.
“I’d hate to break hands...or something worse,” a high pitched voice whines.
A couple, together five years. Incredibly unhappy. The woman, mid-thirties, is waiting until after Boxing Day to break up with the man. He, while unhappy, has no intention of ending the relationship. This will only deepen his dependency on alcohol if not push him to something stronger. He hates his job as office administrator and feels guilty for shagging the co-worker, ah, male co-worker in the supply closet. How very appropriate.
“I can hear your dog tags clink under your shirt. Your posture and eyes are always ready for combat. While you aren't currently groomed for service, your haircut suggests that it was cut to military regulation not more than two and a half months ago. You've been home for four months, but have not seen action in seven months.” My eyes sweep over him. He favours his right hand though he's left handed. “Not since the wound to your left side, I'll say shoulder.”
“What time is it?” I ask.
Something catches in John’s chest. He wonders who might have captured his former CO’s heart. Months ago, James Sholto moved up north - deep within sheep country. Did he settle down with a nice country girl or..? John shakes his head. No matter. Afghanistan is far away, in time and place. It was only a few stolen moments in a hot tent. It was only because death lurked around each corner, on the street and across the arid desert.
The room erupts in applause and cheers. Lestrade whistles through two fingers. Sherlock’s face is on fire from the heat in the stuffy pub and his own embarrassment. Yet, John’s grin is radiant. He gives Sherlock's arm a squeeze.
He looks at his arm. “How can you tell?”
“Course. Happy Christmas, Mr. Holmes.” His eyes blow wide as a hand slaps over his mouth. “Shezza.”
“Do you have ointment?” I ask.
“How long will you need to rest before…” My fingertips skirt down his spine to stop at his round arse. I can only hope to know that pleasure.
“How much money did they want from you?” I grab the damp flannel from the table.
He chuckles and smacks my arse. “Have another date?”
“Let's go home,” John breathes against his skin. “I want to discover you all over again.”
Feel free to stop by my tumblr, also
“Dunno about a sunset though. Stars, right, probably something darker…” John’s eyes would flit over Sherlock’s hair, his skin, his dark blue dressing gown. “Light on dark, yeah. Stars. Yeah.”
“What happens now?”
It is five days when he contemplates assuming Shezza for a case. For a drug den. For cocaine. It’s tempting beyond belief. It’s tempting, and he loathes himself for it.
“John,” Sherlock says, yet again, the name twisting as though he's strangled. “I… I thought you looked very handsome. Before. Wearing my shirt.”
It sounds like a promise to buy tea. John knows it’s a promise for so much more.
He gestures at the flat. Sherlock’s arm moves with his.
“Probably best to wait.” He sighs, hands tangled in black curls.
“What if I always put sugar in your tea whenever I actually make tea?”
Regarding John now, so close and solemn, Sherlock cannot recall ever feeling more contrite in his life, not even when saying goodbye to John from several stories up Bart’s. That is now merely a previous entry on the list of sorrows John Watson has fallen victim to from those he keeps close. Sherlock feels all the worse for having dealt the newest blow, though the fact that it was not his own transgression helps to alleviate this, as does John’s apparent gratitude.
“No, but I know my way around a laboratory and the human body.” I reach inside the bag.
He still sees his lover fighting against his own orgasm. Licking his own fingers, he swipes the sticky fluid from Sherlock's chest and pops it between those kiss reddened lips. Sherlock's tongue curls around John's thick fingers as he moans and give one, two more thrusts. His face and neck turn bright red as he comes so hard the stars explode around John's head.
He wipes his hand on damp jeans before grasping mine firmly. I can't tell if it's because his skin is frozen or the high from the fight, but his grip sends a shiver up my arm and down my spine.
Sherlock’s eyes sweep over John and crinkle in the corners when he smiles. “John Watson, I presume.” He flips his phone to reveal John’s Facebook profile page.
“This absurd bed is making too much noise. Your mother has to know exactly what is occurring in here,” Sherlock pants. “Maybe we should…”
“No, this is an invitation. You hate staying here. Come home with me tomorrow.” I caress his thigh.
His arms wrap around me. My hands cup his face as if I’m the most precious China in the world. We kiss slowly, completely. It’s not the gnashing of lips and teeth like earlier. Our tongues dance and stroke. My chin is raw from his beard scraping against my skin. I shiver thinking of how it would feel if his face had been buried in my arse, opening me, tasting me. My cock brushes against his belly while his throbs on my thigh. I’m afraid if I touch him, we will both explode. And he’s promised me so much more.
Once at home, John marched his belongings into my room. While he put away his clothes, I pried the floorboards up in the kitchen to retrieve my kit. Quietly, I slipped upstairs to place it the heating grate behind a large dresser. I quickly closed the behind me and returned to sitting area to wait for John.
"Really just down the hall. Barely more than a few yards..." Sherlock is losing nerve and his buzz. What had seemed like a grand idea while staring at the footballer on John's wall has become a mess. This is why he doesn't do relationships or anything intimate.
“You scum bag
After we cleaned up and slipped on our pyjamas, we curled together on my bed until we saw my parents headlights stream across the walls and ceiling of my bedroom. After mum checked on us, we moved back to entwine our bodies again. One last “I love you” before we fell asleep.
“Let's hurry,” I suggest. “You look a fright.”
"Good night, boys," Mrs. Watson calls up the stairs. "Happy Christmas!"
“The boys of the NYPD choir
He smirks. “Of course you would know that. My sister has been making an attempt at sobriety for the holiday season. It’s a process.”
I am on my way to sabotaging the entire night. It’s my nature to toss a molotov cocktail into anything promising. I take a step back, and nearly force myself to think like someone else. Like John, for instance.
After a shower, we curled up on the sofa. We slept, well John slept while I watched him. In the morning, John cooked breakfast and I actually ate. We packed all his things into a large olive Army bag and a backpack. He left a note for his sister, and we were off to Baker Street.
“Well, I don’t think she really wanted me to crash her sofa...so yeah...she went on a minbreak.” He pauses to catch his breath. His eyes dart down the street for any trouble. “Uh, thanks back there.”
Sherlock isn't certain how much longer he can last. Just watching John writhe above him with his neck and chest mottled with bites and nips caused by his own mouth is enough to bring on  his orgasm. John slides back and forth on Sherlock so hard they could very well break the bed.
“Then I bloody well want you to kill me,” the man snarls and cranes his neck back to expose his stubbled chin and neck. He has no sense of fear, and I do not believe he is only calling a bluff. He knows what these men are capable of, he doesn’t give a fuck. Definitely a soldier.
From me when I first found you…”
John opens his eyes to reveal nothing but lustful longing. "I can't wait until you know what it feels like to have your lover fill you completely."
“I’m just making conversation.” Carefully, I clean the gnarly looking gash.
Against my will, I feel my lips turn up into a grin. “Not at the moment.”
Heat rises in Sherlock’s cheeks. “You certainly don’t need me to make a fool of yourself up there.”
He struggles the look at the watch on his wrist. “It's four in the morning, so I think I've held up my end.”
“Not today,” I growl. My cock is already purple and throbbing painfully. If his tongue goes anywhere near my entrance, I will come on this ugly holiday throw so hard that I’ll see stars. “Please, get on with it.”
“Are you high?” He asks.
You're a punk…”
“Are you comfortable back there? Taking a snooze before actually fucking me into Christmas morning like you promised,” I taunt him and it works.
“Of course, that's what I said.”
When you first took my hand
The words come out in a rush causing John to chuckle lightly. “Okay, but I’d bet you’d recover soon. Though, I think you coming would push me over the edge and I’m not a young man anymore.”
“Well, so could anyone
“I thought we'd walk a bit,” John suggests.
“I’ve been working for 57 hours and 23 minutes. I am certainly not good for company, or children.” I wrinkle my nose.
“Yeah?”
“I was about to kill a man, who while deserving, probably not my call to make.” Sherlock swallowed the dry lump in his throat.
“Yes, I'm shocked it managed to cut through your jacket. There's no way it could possibly get through that layer of fat.” I gesture to heaving midsection of the bald man.
My eyes travel from his indigo eyes, to the star on his shoulder, and across the soft middle above his hips. Though flaccid, his cock still makes my mouth water. After we’ve showered and slept - more like him sleeping while I search memorise every line in his face - I plan to know his musky taste when I take him into my mouth to wake him as the sun filters through hideous lace curtains. I want it all and for as long as he’ll stay with me.
“We don't have to,” I assured him.
“That didn't stop you from having sex with me.” I grin. “I think it's fair to say that we provide mutual comfort for each other. I know what I want so why should I waste time in stating that?”
"Hey, a man has needs. And when he can't get them from his seemingly uninterested but gorgeous as hell flatmate, he has to get by." John kisses the frown from Sherlock's face. "I want it all too. No need to rush."
Quicky, I snatch up the knife and attempt to catch my breath. “Don't move or I will cut your carotid artery and let you die in this alley.”
He snorts. “You inject drugs, and you think a violin would bother me.”
“Liberal pour for an addict,” I remark cheekily.
When all our dreams come true..”
Then danced through the night..”
“The very ones I’m about to shag you rotten on. Now switch positions with me.” John commands.
“How can that be?” he murmurs. “You were made for sex, with that body and your voice. You have to have hundreds of men and women clamouring to be with you.”
“Well, love to stay for more scintillating conversation but I must be off.” I nod.
John nodded tightly. “Probably best for the both of us.” He pulled his phone out. “I'll have Molly meet us then?”
"Do you want to move?" John pants.
His eyes sweep over my body. “Or it could be the two rounds of fantastic sex.”
“It’s a duet. Of course I need you.” John’s fingers close around Sherlock’s hand.
John Watson ‘So you must be looking for the flatshare’
"Can I move? Are you hurting?"
“Splendid. Shower?” I swing my feet to the floor.
After supper, Mrs. Watson pulls out the photo album, and John's cheeks turn a deep magenta. John observes his mum pouring over pages and pages of his youth with a rapt Sherlock Holmes. Those iridescent aqua eyes smile honestly as Mrs. Watson tells a tale for each page. The laugh that escapes from those sinful lips is hearty and open. As a flush creeps up from the open vee of Sherlock's shirt and spreads to his cheek, John’s navy sweater somehow becomes incredibly stuffy.
Yang barely raises a hand as I leave. The snow falls harder, making already quiet streets nearly desolate. A car has not passed in at least fifteen minutes. That is perfectly fine with me. My goal is to get home and plunge a needle into my arm. The white noise that creeps in between cases is starting hum in my ears. I need to quiet it as soon as possible.
I can walk away, just turn back down the road and find a safer path. I’m not a hero and I’m definitely outnumbered.
I rub my hands together and have a look around the flat. Handmade throws cover the sofa and armchairs. Every surface is cluttered with pictures - mostly of two women embracing. The woman with long dark hair smiles easily and openly. She looks one moment from a laugh. Her companion, a woman who resembles John but with a fuller face, smiles but it’s more of a grimace. Her worry lines run deep; and her complexion is a bit waxy and grey. Probably aching for a drink. She loves the dark haired woman but isn't certain the relationship will last.
When she was done, she cocked her head and said, “Your room smells funny.”
John lets out a relieved but short snort. “I'd like to see you try.”
“Sherlock Holmes.” I extend my hand.
“Harry is a functioning alcoholic, so we have a variety,” he replies. “Just up around the corner here.”
His finger smears some oil around my entrance, then a low groan as he oils himself up. I glance over my shoulder to see him take his cock in his hand.
“We'll work on that.” He offers his hand and leads me down the hall.
“Yes, I'll get it,” he says quickly.
The hard lines in John's face soften. “So, you get high to be normal? Are you on a case now?”
“I don't think I'll need antibiotics,” he attempts to roll the sleeve of the plaid shirt he's wearing.
“We need….something,” he whispers against my skin.
“You need to pay up, mate…” a tobacco-roughen voice growls.
“Santa didn’t give you want you wanted?” he asks.
“What does that mean?” he asks.
“Christ, who doesn’t? But the sight of you like this will end our night sooner than I want. I won’t last a minute,” he says breathlessly.
- - - -
I shiver at the thought, but scramble to sprawl on the sofa as he instructs. All I can see is the bloody Christmas tree blinking before me. I feel his weight behind me on the sofa. The sensation of his tongue on my left arse cheek causes me to jump a little. He licks closer to….
Out for Christmas Day!”
"I'm feeling many things and none of them is pain. God, take me....do what you feel." His finger traces a hard nipple eliciting a hiss from Sherlock's lips.
I point to the pocket of his coat. “I can see your badge from the clinic with your photo. I think it's fair to assume you are the Dr. John Watson on the ID?”
Sherlock hesitates a moment before stepping through the threshold. "It occurred to me that I should give your Christmas present to you."
- - -
We ended up getting each other off. I got to see those fuckable lips wrap around my cock as he sucked me dry. I was eager to return the favour under sticky bedsheets. Listening to his muffled moan was music to my ears.
My fingers graze a syringe and I'm instantly reminded of my original plans for the evening. The powder sits in my coat pocket and here’s a syringe. I just need a candle and spoon. I steal a glance at John as he reveals the pale skin of his chest with each button undone. Suddenly, I'm thirsty for something - is it the syringe or the flesh before me?
“I…” His protest falls on drunken ears as a microphone is shoved into his hand. All eyes are on Sherlock, even his singing partner John. He ventures that John has done this before, but watching Sherlock make an absolute tit of himself is new - and an early Christmas present to most at the party.
“More. Deeper,” he sighed.
When Sherlock glances back to John, he finds his doctor blushing.
I lunge forward. It’s not a kiss, more like mouths attacking one another. Our lips don’t press together gently, with tentative longing. It’s aggressive, angry and utterly amazing. His strong hand cups the back of my head to hold me in the kiss, as if I would pull away now. My hands slide over the hot marks on his torso, along the cool planes of chest to wrap around his back. The tongue that licked his own lips moments before, explores my mouth hungrily. This is not a cinema kiss, neat and perfect. His scruff burns my chin. It’s wet and sloppy, filling the flat with smacking sounds and moans. It’s fucking perfect.
“It's amazing,” he repeats and continues on his way.
"Right, to give you my Christmas present." Sherlock nods and searches for the courage he had possessed ten minutes ago.
“No. As you expertly deduced, it's been a few weeks.” I neglect to tell him about the bag in my coat.
“It's our turn!”
John’s tears soaked through the silk dressing gown and seeped into Sherlock’s shirt. The silent cry turned into a body shaking sob. John’s arms unwound from himself to wrap around Sherlock’s frail body. He took fistfuls of the dressing gown to prevent slumping to the floor. Sherlock resisted his desire to press a kiss into John’s hair. Rather, he willed away the urge to wince against his bruises from John’s blows in the morgue and folded his other arm around John’s shoulders.
"Maybe I'll just use a pillow. No snooping around for your present either. I have it well hidden," John says.
They howled out for more
John notification pings.
He goes perfectly still. The soldier pats down the man’s pockets and coat. “You brought one knife to collect money?”
With his hand still wrapped around John, Sherlock grinds his hips against him. His own cock brushes against his knuckles and his hands and hips move in time.
John slowly fills me, and it hurts and burns like I had known it would. My fingers dig into the arm with every thrust forward. I can’t help but push back wanting more. He’s holding back, and I need that feral lust. I want to be covered in his sweat.
They've got rivers of gold
It’s not entirely a lie. I am certain that there will be sleep at some point. More like the medically induced stupor to numb everything for a time.
John opens the Facebook app on his phone. He scrolls through Candy Crush requests and Foursquare check ins. He takes a quiz to discover what animal he is. Hedgehog. What algorithm sorted that out? He swipes his phone to look at newly posted pictures from his sister Harry and her wife, Clara. They just celebrated their second wedding anniversary. They beam at one another in matching blue dresses, but John knows the real story.
John winds his arm around Sherlock's waist as he turns to the crowd who raise their glasses to sing along.
I saw technicolour. My hips snapped forward, and he stretched around me. He grunted into his fist.
Sherlock's eyes widen. "Of course. I'm not the one for one night stands..."
“I kept them with me babe
“Ta,” he winks and winds the blue scarf around Sherlock's neck.
That is his life: Before John and After John. He's living in the After, a period full of concerns and feelings he'd never previously given the time of day.
