“Nope,” Tony said, starting to back away. “Don’t say no. We’ll just say you owe me, okay?” He was nodding his head, smiling that same sweet, friendly, wicked smile. “‘Kay? You owe me a coffee, okay?”
Tony glanced up at the server, pulling his glasses down on his nose so he could see her better.  “Sure.  Thanks.”
“Don’t tell me to--whoa, what’s with all the encryption?  Are those firewalls?  What are you hacking into?”
She tensed beside him, her fingers stilling, then they began to move again, caressing his cheek, his hair. “Of course you can, honey,” she said. “Are...are they important?”
Steve didn’t disappoint. He ducked his head, laughed under his breath, as he slumped back against the counter bonelessly. One hand rose to rub over his face, then back into his hair. Tony loved that. “You have no idea,” Steve muttered.
“He's not pressing charges. He knows if he did he'd have to explain to his wife exactly why he got into a bar-fight in the first place."
They were polite to each other, courteous and respectful, saying things like, “Please pass the salt,” at dinner, and “Thank you for folding the laundry.”
“You’re right,” he said, the absurdity of apologizing to what was basically a computer-generated secretary/babysitter/friend/wife not lost on him.  “I’m sorry.  I haven’t been taking care of myself.  I’ll do better, okay?”
Steve’s fingers lingered on the floor.  “Strange said I thought you were Johann Schmidt.  He said that’s why I did it.”
“I want you, baby.  So much,” Tony whispered, moving to trail hot, wet kisses down Steve’s throat.  His pulse was rapid, almost dangerously fast beneath Tony’s lips.  He sucked on the pulse-point lightly, the tiny noises coming from Steve’s lips going straight to his cock.
He reached over instead and traced a pattern on Steve’s chest.  “Alright,” he agreed.  “No questions asked.”
Black flowers bloomed in Tony’s vision as Steve squeezed.  He was lying mostly on top of Tony, his right knee supporting his weight, leaning on his hands, choking the breath out of his lungs, choking the
Tony was quiet, his mind whirling.  A thousand thoughts, a thousand questions jostling for room in his mouth.  Finally, one broke through.
Natasha watched Bucky’s broad back shiver and quake within the circle of Steve’s arms.  She wondered that Steve had the strength still to contain him, but he held on, solid, stable.  If not for the paleness of his cheek and the brightness of the blood on his neck and the grass around him, no one would know that he was a dying man.
Tony’s heart broke to see the changes in him, but then Steve lowered his hand, wincing, and cracked his lids, and it was mended again.  The eyes were the same.  Those big, blue, oceanic eyes hadn’t changed at all.  They found Tony’s unerringly, and they looked at each other across the tarmac, across the months.  Tony saw uncertainty in them, pain, fear, and a spark of something else.  Something that might have been hope.
“-And pretty soon, you’d start thinking about them when you were with me. You’d start thinking about what you’d be doing back at school if you didn’t have to come home and hang out with me for the weekend, going to movies, and sitting in the park, and all that other stupid, basic shit that you could do with anybody. You’d think of something you could say to them that you can’t say to me. You’d think-"
The silence pressed in on him from all sides.  It was quiet at home, but this was beyond even that.  It didn’t even seem like there were any birds in the surrounding trees.  Which was strange.  The building was part of an old logging operation.  It was made of corrugated sheet-metal, huge, cavernous, with some dust-grimed windows that were almost all shattered now.  There should be hundreds of swallows in the eaves of this place, building their little mud nests all jostled together like row houses.  There should be sparrows, and finches, and starlings.  All of the birds that Tony had gotten used to seeing at his own place, should also be here in
He didn’t know if he had voiced all those words aloud or if they only existed in his head, but it didn't matter. Tony was here. Tony was touching him, holding him, giving him everything he wanted, everything he'd promised, and Steve felt that quiet in his head again. Felt it there as Tony's eyes delved into his own, parsing the truth there for himself.
“Don’t you dare be sorry.” She touched his cheek with trembling fingers. “We’ve missed you so much.”
The ceiling was high and bare, the beams exposed.  The floor was cracked, dirt-covered concrete, but just like outside, green was sprouting up through the cracks, searching for the shafts of sunlight that fell through the shattered windows.  The clearing was probably man-made rather than natural, but in either case, it let the sun in, and it let the greenery grow.
Steve had been in prison then.  He was in prison now.  The more things change, the more they stayed the same.  Tony wasn’t sure he’d really understood that phrase until now.  And that was fine.  He hated it.  It was a stupid phrase.  And things
He did stay awake for a while. Tony told him about the museum. About the Mayans, and the mummies, and the dinosaurs. He told him about going to the movies. He told him how he made Sam laugh so hard Coke came out of his nose and Sam swore at him for five minutes after, wiping his red, streaming eyes with a napkin. Tony tried to mop up his gross mess of soda and now-soggy french fries, but it was almost too hard doing that while trying not to die from laughter himself.
Steve recognized the voice, and when he turned and saw that familiar face, he couldn’t help but smile. “Natasha,” he said.
Steve blinked up at him, the clouds leaving his eyes.  “Oh.  Hey,” he said.  “Did I fall asleep?  I didn’t miss the end of the story, did I?”
Steve broke a piece off of his muffin and popped it into his mouth. The “blueberry” gritted against his teeth when he chewed. He washed it down with a sip of coffee, and turned the page in the book. It was one of his mother’s books. An old copy of
Peter shook his head, blushing to the roots of his hair.  “Yeah, sorry, Mr. Stark,” he said, and bounded into Tony's arms again.  “Thanks.  Really.  I mean, wow.  Really.”
They left his apartment hand in hand. Dodger ran ahead, taking the stairs two at a time. Steve pressed Tony against the wall just outside his own door and kissed his mouth, slowly, lingeringly, but keeping an ear open for the door at the top. “I didn’t tell you happy birthday,” he whispered in his ear, and Tony let out a soft breath that was closer to a whimper than anything else.
He nodded without opening his eyes.  She had never asked for that before.  Never.  “Of course, you can, FRI.  Come back when you’re ready.”
Tony reached up and pressed his mouth to Steve’s.  “You really are adorable.  How can a grown man be so adorable?”
"No, I'll just keep calling you baby."  He touched Steve's cock gently, then grasped it more firmly when Steve sucked in a deep breath.  "That's still okay, isn't it? Right, baby?"
He went into the kitchen and filled a bowl with water. Dodger lapped it up while Steve put his coat on and found Dodger’s leash in a basket by the front door.
The tears broke free.  The tears he'd been holding onto all day, and he collapsed against her, into her embrace, letting her hold him up, letting her support him and comfort him.  Letting her hands, and her voice, and her
And as if to prove that, Tony’s hand was back in Steve’s hair, petting it with tender little strokes. Steve moved his head, trying to nuzzle into the cup of his palm. Tony indulged him for a moment, allowing Steve to rub his cheek against his fingers, kiss the slight indent of his heart and life lines.
He shifted into first and touched the gas pedal.  The ‘Cuda purred forward, growling like a jungle cat.
Tony insisted they stop at Steve’s apartment building on their way out of town so he could say good-bye. Howard didn’t want to. They had a schedule. A flight. Christ, Tony, he’s just some
They stopped again, and Steve felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment. God, why did this always happen to him around Tony? Six years in the desert and he hadn’t blushed once, but thirty seconds in Tony’s presence rendered him a red-faced mess.
Steve shifted beneath him, troubled.  “Tony,” he began slowly, “that was illegal then.  Even if I’d wanted to--and I didn’t--I couldn’t have.  It would have been a court-martial.  Or--”
Bruce looked at the floor, his hands on his hips.  His brow was furrowed, his glasses sitting precariously on the tip of his nose.  He looked lost in thought, almost as though he were debating with himself.
to do it, too. Why should he be here? Steve hadn’t asked him to come. In fact, he’d made it pretty fucking clear that he didn’t want anything to do with Tony at the reception, so just why was he torturing himself with this? Why couldn’t he just let it drop? Why couldn’t he just walk away?
“Fuck,” Tony muttered under his breath as he climbed out of the shower and toweled off.  Because, of course, he hadn’t planned on sleeping on the couch.  He’d planned on sleeping here, right here in this bed with Steve beside him.
Steve nodded. “Yes. Okay? Yes. We’ll talk about it. We can stop somewhere on the way home. We can stop and talk about whatever you want to talk about. I promise.” He turned his head, trying to catch Tony’s eye. “But not right now. Please?”
Tony’s smirk to that was all the answer he needed to know that Bucky would very much regret having them locked in his living room.
“Oh, finally taking control now, aren’t we?”, he purred and his lips were somehow close to Steve’s ear now, making him shudder under the hot breath, “sure you’re able to maintain this position?”
His words were muffled by the paper in front of his face: “I don’t know if I’m supposed to be happy or disappointed that you didn’t throw something at me.” He chuckled and Steve immediately felt the urge to kill the brown-haired man. Or to throw something.
He flipped Tony around, both of their bodies colliding with each other and then with the line of lockers on the wall. He felt how Tony’s breath was pressed from his lungs for a second, could see how Tony’s grin flickered for only an instance before it returned with hot amusement and fire.
“It has to be true love if Steve Rodgers is willing to skip the last period”, was the first thing Bucky said before he outright pulled Steve into a hug that took his breath away.
Tony made a pause, his eyes sparkling challenging: ”Just say it, darling. We had sex, you want it to be a one night thing. Which normally is my part to say”
“You’re such a tease”, Steve repeated, bucking his hips up, earning a low moan from the other, “and now it’s too late to say sorry and run away”
He shot Steve one last furious but strangely sad glance before he got up, turned on his heels and left.
He let out a harsh, dry laugh that even surprised himself in his bitterness: “You’re the one who can’t stop flirting with this woman all the time!” He literally spat the word ‘woman’ out. He really wanted to tear something apart at the moment.
Steve was used to being on the edge around Tony, torn between want and hate, and slowly, without himself admitting it, also between lust and true affection. It was not that kind of affection one would offer a love interest, maybe not even that kind of affection one would offer a friend, but he slowly grew fond of the other. They sometimes talked afterward, Tony lazily sprawled all across the sheets (or whatever they had been using) and Steve about to leave but caught in a chat. Steve couldn’t remember why they had started talking in first place but it had surprisingly been interesting and even fun.
“Bucky?”, he demanded, louder than usually, trying the handle, “Bucky, for fuck’s sake, get me out of here”
Steve entered the room, back to whistling that weird old song, when he suddenly chocked on his own breath and dropped three horrible movies, one pack of nachos and two special editions of extra crisp Oreos to the floor.
“Why isn’t-?”, Steve started, shocked about whatever exactly was going on. There was no way Tony would really do that.
His answer sat around a little couch table across the room. He only saw them because their voices and catcalls were even louder than the ear shattering music. Bucky next to him laughed and his gaze made his way from the cheering crowd back to his best friend in serious need for help.
“As soon as you tell us where exactly you’ve been”, Steve swallowed hard and his mother saw it, judged by her expression, equally worried and disapproving. He already knew his parents wouldn’t like it and mentally prepared for the speech they’d give him the second he was done talking. Thus, he tried to avoid the question: “We’ve been at a party from a guy from school. Everybody was there”
His jaw ached a bit but he only welcomed the pain. Tony above him was a mess and there was no way Steve would stop now, not when he could make Tony Stark falling apart beneath him. He had successfully managed to suppress his gag reflex and that was most likely what send Tony over the cliff. His fingers, still resting in Steve’s hair curled and his lips were parted to form a silent and yet sinful moan. Steve enjoyed the sight more than he probably should. He swallowed everything and knew that Tony was watching. He looked up, slowly, searching for the other’s eyes.
He did not know if his stare was disgusted or angry, but it seemed to make Tony bent out of shape too.
They were clashing even before the door fell shot. Steve could feel the anger and the want in his body, his mind, his every movement. It was a mixture of losing control and of being the one in charge.
Although Steve started to feel something, their dislike for each other never really changed. Tony still managed to drive him mad all the time. But despite Tony’s qualities as constant trouble in Steve’s life, he enjoyed the other’s company more than he should.
They stayed like that for enough time so Steve could dose of for a couple of minutes. When he woke up again, Tony was looking at him thoughtfully. There was a soft expression in his eyes that was so unlike everything Steve had seen before. At least not on Tony’s face. But as soon as Steve shifted a bit (his arm tugged somewhere beneath Tony had fallen asleep) the other’s expression changed back to normal.
“Consider yourself lucky", he whispered low and dark, sending shivers down Steve’s spine, "if you behave you might get to fuck me later", his lips spread into a wicked grin and the blonde could feel the heat coming from the other. Even thought he was driven crazy he tried to stay stoic, only looking at Tony, not saying anything.
“You are not everybody”, his mother said almost coldly, thought there was curiosity in her eyes. It was obvious she wanted to know all the details. If the situation had been otherwise, she’d have probably asked for it with joy written all over her face, anticipating Steve to have found an husband-to-be. But unluckily, the situation was not elsehow. He could only hope Mrs. Barnes had not been as talkative as she used to be. Or that she forgot to mention the name ‘Stark’.
But most of all, more than the loneliness or the arrogant students, the pollution or the noise, he hated Tony Stark. He had detested him when he hadn’t even talked to him. It had been enough seeing him standing there, in the middle of all his friends and admirers, surrounded by his fans, all self-confident and flamboyant, embodying all the things Steve hated about his new life.
“I really can’t believe what happened to my life”, Steve sighed dramatically and Bucky patted his shoulder: “That’s what city life does to us country pumpkins.”
“Are you scared to admit you want it because of your oh-so-high morals or because you’re fucking stubborn and need to prove something?”, Tony continued to pick at him, proofing once again why he was such a tease to Steve. Provoking all those thoughts Steve unsuccessfully tried to ban from his mind. Most of them involving a significant lack of clothing.
First things first. And first thing was to get home. He was curious what his parents would say. He was 18, but as he still lived with his parents until he finished high school, it felt not at all different than it had felt when he was minor. He was torn between expecting them to be angry and them being glad because he finally acted like a social being. They had expected him to find friends easily as he used to at home. They had been more than surprised when he came home from school in a depressed state.
Steve felt his cheeks redden, this time more out of shame than anger. It had been so obvious Bucky would say that at some point. He felt the strong urge to prove a point. Tony’s body was till on his and his grip on the other tightened. He heard Tony’s breath hissing and felt his muscles tensing.
More was what they said, what they needed to say because he’d made Tony finally speechless. He obeyed while stars from the lack of oxygen sprung in front of his eyes. Yet he swallowed again and earned another moan, long and throaty. He moaned to and it vibrated around Tony’s cock.
Steve had almost started to forget the stares and as he was not interested in Tony’s personality he also started to forget that somewhere in this school Tony Stark was most likely playing superstar. Sam had really and truly saved his day.
Steve enjoyed this kind of power, how he was able to coax all those sounds and pleas out of Tony. It was such a nice diversion to the usual arrogant Tony.
“In the locker room?”, Sam had just asked and laughed, “God, I will never be able to forget that image” He gave Steve a dig with his elbow: “I really never thought you’d be that creative”
“When you are that happy that I have a social life”, Steve argued and slowly moved through the room aiming for his bedroom door, “why are you still standing here looking like I have a big problem?”
He was still glad he had friends who would listen to him whining about Tony all the time. Today seemed to be one of these times when his morale support had decided to become a tease.
“You’re warm”, he mumbled and curled somewhat even closer to him. Steve felt awkward for a moment and had no idea what to do because this was domestic and intimate and not how it used to be. Then his body just acted without asking his mind for approval and he put an arm around Tony, holding him close. Tony had been right because it was warm and comfortable and when he closed his eyes, he was able to forget the awkwardness easily.
"Sounds great", Steve smiled and tried not to look at the remaints of the kitchen as they left their apartment and headed to the car.
“I am sorry I have ambushed you like that”, she stated, a mild smile appearing on her face, “I should probably leave”
There was nothing Steve was capable of doing anymore, he just lied there and swam in his desire. Tony was good, better than good even, Steve thought he’d been rock-hard before, but now he was proved wrong. Under Tony’s experienced touch, under his fingers that in one second lazily stroked him and then almost brought him over the edge, he was so close to losing himself that he just desperately hold on to everything he could find. Steve was so lost in this sensation – more than lost, it was his whole being right now – that he flinched in utter surprise when he felt Tony’s finger at his entrance, covered in cold, slick lube. His breath and most likely his heart too skipped a beat. It was a completely new sensation, completely new pleasure and he happily welcomed it.
“Are you serious?”, he screamed at Bucky but his best friend only ignored him and arrived exactly 10 seconds later than the day before.
“There are Iron Man shorts?”, Tony asked surprised and way too cheerful. Steve soughed passionately. This would be a very long day.
He felt that he still wore his clothes from the day before and suddenly realized, how there was no sticky feeling, no naked bodies and no rumbled sheets. No sex. They’d just fallen asleep during the movie. Somewhere underneath the cozy, warm feeling of having just woken up, it felt wrong and right at the same time. That was not how their relationship was supposed to be. It was so much better. It was new and unfamiliar to wake up next to Tony who hummed happily in his sleep and rolled towards him. Steve felt himself smile before he could stop it.
“Didn’t think you would really manage to get them play”, another brown-haired man said. Steve had seen him before. Clint was the name- if he remembered right- and he was a good friend to both Tony and Natasha. He seemed to be the nicest of the trio and his eyes had a friendly sparkle in them.
“No, I haven’t. Plus your ‘richest guy’ is somebody I definitively have no interest in meeting again”, Steve answered and he was really, really sure about that. If he had ever dreamed of that, it would have been a nightmare.
Tony looked at him with raised eyebrows as he tugged his shirt back into place. “That’s not helping”, he stated, and then with a grin at the bulge in his trousers, “not at all”
Tony came first, his whole face showing an ecstasy that made it even more beautiful, his body arching beneath Steve, moving against him, into him, causing the most delicate friction between, the most delicate pain when fingers buried their selves in his backs and lips smashed onto his. Steve felt his orgasm hitting him. It took him completely aback, washed him away and left him with a feeling that was so close to utter bliss, to exhaustion and content, to control and complete chaos he had do sulk in his breath in long, deep breath. He stayed where he was, too lazy and too overwhelmed to move anymore than rolling a bit to the side, eyeing Tony whose eyes were still closed and his body shaken a bit. It was a beautiful and satisfying sight. He smiled, knowing he was the one to cause Tony lying there, panting, to make him scream and beg and moan. Tony seemed to feel his gaze and turned his head, smiling in a very satisfied and still very predatory way. For the first time it occurred to Steve that Tony had always been in control, had been the one to trick him into something. But then he wasn’t sure. And he didn’t care.
He waited by the car while Tony locked the cabin door, hung the key up, stretching to do it, exposing that sliver of skin Steve so loved, then came back to the car. He unlocked it, and they both got in, settling into place.
“It’s okay,” Jack said, but Steve didn’t hear him. He retreated down the hall, back toward the elevator, jabbing his finger at the button, almost falling inside. He backed into the corner and pressed his hands against his face, trying desperately to get himself back under control.
He maneuvered her back into place without waking her, tucked her back in, and kissed her cheek. “‘Night, Morgan,” he said, and she murmured something back. He didn’t know what. It was too soft to hear. Probably just sleep-talk, but it didn’t matter. He liked hearing it anyway. Dodger got into his dog-bed in the corner, and appeared to go to sleep. Steve wasn’t fooled. He knew he’d be in her bed as soon as he left the room, but Tony and Dodger seemed to have come to a compromise. Dodger stayed off the living room furniture and Tony’s bed, and didn’t beg too much at the kitchen table, and Tony looked the other way when he found him asleep in Morgan’s bed in the morning. It seemed to be working out so far. Steve was glad.
“Hey!” Steve said, wiping grape juice off his forehead. “What the hell?” He plucked the grape out of his lap where it had landed and threw it back at Tony.
The water turned off in the bathroom and Tony shook his head to clear it.  He went into the kitchen and put the rest of the dishes away, waiting for Steve, waiting to see what he’d say about Rhodey’s visit.
Steve lay beside her for a few more minutes, then slowly made his way out from under her and got to his feet. He adjusted the blankets, kissed her one last time, then left, closing the door part-way behind him.
Tony looked uncertain, but Steve thought he would give in. If he’d really wanted to go to a hotel, he would have just done that in the first place. “What about your mom?” Tony asked, and his eyes darted past Steve into the apartment behind him. “Is she asleep? What if she gets mad? I still haven’t met her yet.”
Steve watched him, his eyes dark, shrouded in shadows. “Why do you want me?” he asked, and his voice was harsh. Broken.
It was the picture Steve had been sketching, of course.  He must have worked on it while Tony got ready and drove into town for dinner that night, because he was looking at a finished piece now.  The Bentley, though on the far right in the picture, was obviously the focal-point.  Steve had recreated it in loving detail.  The beach, the dock, the trees, were mere suggestion and glamor, hazy like in a dream, but the car was bold, heavy, leaping off the page, looking stylized but almost real enough to climb into.  Tony could almost feel the rumble of the engine, smell that strawberry air freshner he’d never gotten around to replacing.
“We should get one of those swear-jars,” Steve said, running his hands through his hair, smoothing the place Tony had mussed with his evil hands.
He ignored the paleness of Steve’s skin.  The high-strung, jittery way he scratched his knee, the restless movement of his eyes.
He left, got into the car, and drove away.  On the way to the Tower, he stopped for a cheeseburger.  He didn’t think about sex dungeons at all while he ate.  Not much, anyway.
Steve heaved in a breath, like someone getting ready to lift a heavy burden.  “What do I do, Nat?” he asked.  “Last time I saw him, I…”
Tony smiled up at him. He looked happy, and Steve’s heart eased a lot more than he thought it should have. “Hey.”
“I went out for groceries,” he said. His voice had taken on that lifeless quality again, and Tony hated it. He hated it so fucking much. “I didn’t need much. Just a couple things. I left Dodger home. I took him out for his walk already, and he was more interested in laying on the couch than going out again.”
Steve raised his hand in confession. “I picked ‘pool’,” he said, and bumped Tony’s shoulder with his own, throwing him a careless, calculated grin. “But I think I remember being told I was ‘Insane to the
Tony took it, feeling a little self-conscious. He didn’t know much about Wanda--just what Sam had said--but if she was good enough for Sam and Sarah trusted her in her kitchen, then she had to be something special. “I’m
Tony had planned on jumping on him the second they were inside, but now that they were here in this warm, happy, familiar space, he didn’t do it. He looked around instead, his eyes drinking in the apartment like a cool glass of water after a long, hot day. It had been a long time since he’d been here. He called Sarah every couple of months, just to see how she was doing, to tell her how he was. He liked hearing her voice. He liked that she always seemed genuinely happy to hear from him. He knew he should probably stop bothering her, but he kept calling. Those calls never lasted very long, just a few minutes, but it was nice. An indulgence he couldn’t quite give up just yet, like an alcoholic saying they’d wait until after the holidays to give up drinking...and then after Valentine’s Day...and then after St. Patrick’s Day...
to let the others in. And it wasn’t that big of a deal in terms of the world at large, but he still thought it was a miracle. A small one, maybe, but still a miracle.
Steve bit his lip. He had no right to get angry. No right to feel hurt. Pietro had been a dream. Perfect. Exactly what he needed. Exactly what he should have. And Steve
Tony slid his hand down Steve’s chest, over the dip of his stomach, to the top of his jeans.  He hooked his finger through his belt loop, delighting in the sweet irony of that, and tugged Steve closer.
Tony got to the deli at twelve-thirty.  He didn’t want to take any chances on missing him.  Strange had texted back a terse, “Fine.” an hour after Tony called, so he knew he’d gotten the message.  Now, he just had to wait for him.  And as a great man once said, The waiting is the hardest part.
Tony glared at him, then looked away, trying not to let him see the smile on his lips, and let out a deep breath. He squeezed Steve’s knee again, though, rubbing his thumb along the inner seam of his jeans before finally taking his hand away. Steve felt a burst of triumphant pride in his chest. That felt like a definite win.
By the time they got down to the kissing booth where people would pay to kiss one of the team anywhere except the mouth, the fee getting higher the lower they went on the body--this came from a furiously blushing Jeff, sending Tony and Ray into an utter storm of teenage-style giggles--they finally realized it was now 11:13 pm.
Tony somehow discovered a way to pull Steve’s arm tighter around himself, and cuddled even closer back against his chest. “That’s nice to hear,” he said. “Sometimes when I’m home, even when Howard’s there, I still feel alone. I never feel alone when I’m with you.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah, she did.” He ducked his head, smiling at his shoes, that blush still there. “Mom laughed so hard she choked on her Diet Coke.”
felt amazing. Like a part of him that he had thought was buried and gone forever was slowly crawling back up into the light. And it was funny to think that that could be happening to him. He’d never had more than one good thing at a time in his entire life. How could it be now that he had
Steve wasn’t sure if she heard him.  Her fingers were still on his cheek, but they were still, just a soft pressure.  He folded his own fingers around them and brought them to his mouth.  He kissed the tips, then kissed the hollow of her temple.  Her heartbeat was soothing in his ears, her arms a safe, peaceful place.
Tony laughed, ran his hand down Steve’s chest to his stomach then back to his shoulder. He pretended not to notice the way Steve shuddered. The way his cock suddenly felt hotter, more insistent against Tony’s. “Feeling at a disadvantage, baby?” he teased.
He shook Tony’s hand, then Steve’s, tipping him a wink then headed out the door into the cold night air.
Steve gripped the doorframe.  He had to.  He had to have an anchor.  If he didn’t, there would have been nothing to stop him from crossing the room and dropping to his knees in front of Tony.  Nothing to stop him from pressing his forehead into his lap and releasing a non-stop litany of apologies and promises and pleas for forgiveness.  All the old feelings of desire and love and need rose up in him, tearing through his carefully made defenses like the flood that follows a tsunami.  They cared nothing for his new-found “balance”.  Tony was here.  Tony was
“Oh my god,” she said softly, “I thought that was you.” She put her arms around him and hugged him firmly, and over her shoulder, Steve’s eyes met Tony’s at last.
Steve shook his head, his anger collapsing into bewilderment.  “Whatever, Tony,” he muttered, and walked out.  As he left, he heard the fridge door open, then Tony yelling, “FRIDAY, who ate my goddamn chicken?”
Steve turned his head, his eyes meeting Tony’s.  There was gladness in them, mixed with apprehension.  “You think?”
And even though he’d allowed himself to be put in such a precarious position, Steve still blushed tomato red.
Tony laughed again. He was sick to his stomach. Disgusted with Howard, disgusted with himself, disgusted with the whole situation. He hated that Howard still affected him. And the funny thing was, he hadn’t even really
That’s what Pepper had said. No fighting. No screaming, no yelling, no accusations of...anything. Because there hadn’t been anything to accuse each other of. It just wasn’t working. That’s all. They still loved each other. They still
The humor slipped out of Steve’s face.  He was still smiling, but now it was sad, tinged with nostalgia and regret.  “Buck,” he said, and Bucky was shaking his head before he said another word.
I honestly don't know how many more chapters. Every time I think "Two more to go!" something else happens. But, two more (???) to go!
. He has 714 home runs. Can you fucking imagine that? Seven. Hundred. And Fourteen. Say that, Gabe. Say it right now. Let that roll around on your tongue for a minute.”
He entered the clearing, glancing up as Steve had done at the birds twittering overhead, and came to where Steve sat on the stump. He looked down at Steve’s feet, at the little designs he had made with his toe, and the corner of his mouth ticked up. “You always draw,” he said. “Why do you always draw?”
He looked around at the familiar surroundings.  Familiar, but different, too.  He’d never seen the trees innocent of leaves.  The meadow brown and dry, the long grasses tilled under.  The dock was still there, a white, bony finger jutting out from the shore, but now it pointed only at ice.  The swim float that had been anchored twenty yards out had been hauled in.  It sat in the boat house, waiting patiently for next spring when it could be anchored out again.  Across the lake, Christmas lights twinkled on three or four other houses.
Steve nodded. “Sam helped me,” he said. “With the paperwork and stuff. I’d been there too long. I know that now. I-” he tensed, and leaned abruptly forward, reaching for the bottle on the table. He didn’t pour any, just caressed the curve of the bottle with one finger. Lovingly. Like a man touching his sleeping lover’s shoulder in the dark of night. “I should have left earlier.”
Tony took him to a coffee shop, and they sat together on opposite sides of the booth, Tony sitting sideways, one leg stretched out on the seat beside him, Steve leaning forward, holding his mug in both hands as if trying to warm them.
Sarah hugged them all at the door afterward. She teared up again as she held Steve, but waved him off when he tried to say something. “Don’t,” she said firmly. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
Tony leaned over the back of the chair, put his arms around Steve’s neck and hugged him.  “I know you are,” he said into his ear.  “You’re not going to be in this thing forever, baby.  The serum’s still in there, still doing its thing, it’s just going to take some time.”  He kissed his shoulder.  “I know this sucks, but you’re doing great.  I’m proud of you.”  Tony felt a hitch in Steve’s chest and tightened his arms around him.  He held him while Steve sniffed and wiped his face with the back of his hand.  He only let go when Steve squeezed his hand.
Somewhere inside his brain, Tony felt a circuit misfire. Or overload. Or something. Something that made it completely impossible for the words that had just come out of Steve’s mouth to compute correctly. At least that’s what it felt like. Like there was a panel inside his head and it was starting to flash red.
wanna protect people. Protect you. And Tony. And my mom, and Sam, and Dodger. I wanna take care of you guys. Make sure you’re safe. So, yeah. That’s why I go.”
back,” he said. “That these three weeks aren't going to turn into fifteen years again, Steve, ‘cause I can’t do that. I can’t. And I'm scared-”
Tony finished tying his tie, his fingers doing their own work. “It’s okay,” he said, snugging the knot up to Steve’s throat. “Sounds like fun.”
When he got home, he climbed the stairs, putting one foot in front of the other until he was at the top. He opened the door and went in. Sarah wasn’t home again. Another night at the hospital. Another night alone. If Tony had been in town, he could have come over. If Tony had been in town, Howard would not have come to the store today. Would not have spoken to him. Would not have said those things. Would not have pointed out the fact of his
“I don’t think there’s much proof, guys,” he said softly.  “Maybe there isn’t any proof, at all.  It’s just in my memory.”  He dropped a kiss onto the top of Wanda’s head.  “All he’d have to do was say it was all in my head.  And who knows?  Maybe he’s right.”
Tony stepped closer, and Steve resisted the urge to take a step backward, to keep the same distance between them. That scent. That scent of secrets and spice and oak that Steve remembered so well from before--from every before they’d ever had, save the very first one--made its way toward him and enveloped him in its comforting familiarity, and he wanted to just go to him. Just go to him and fall into his arms. Just wrap himself up in him and never ever move again. But he couldn’t. God. He couldn’t.
“Maybe he’ll change his mind,” Steve said, and looked down to see that his hand was now patting Tony’s knee. He wondered faintly when that had happened. “School doesn’t get out for two weeks.”
“I’m not,” Steve said, and his own voice was still just plain. Without emotion. Dead. “I’m just busy. Like I said.”
They were sitting out on the back deck.  The sun was getting low, but it wasn't dark yet, and it wouldn't be dark for awhile if Mother Nature had anything to say about it.  It was May, spring was in full bloom, and in their little corner of the world, dusk liked to hang around awhile. That was fine with Tony.
Tony roamed around the Tower the whole next day, thinking, trying to figure out what it was about the light pulsing behind Steve’s eyes that meant so much.  As much as he liked to be an expert on pretty much anything he set his mind to, the mysteries of the human psyche would always remain that-- a mystery to him.  Give him an engine and he could take it apart and put it back together in record time, but the mind?  Forget it.  He needed help.
Sam mimicked his posture. “He said he’d meet you after homeroom and then you two could make out in the janitor closet during lunch hour.”
“I haven’t told her,” she said carefully, “and I’m sure Clint hasn’t either, but I think every woman knows when someone else is in love with her man.”
Tony watched Clint go apologize...or whatever. Tony wasn’t a lip-reader. He couldn’t be certain that’s what happened, but he watched him saying something, watched Steve say something back, then watched Clint jump up onto his back and tackle him to the ground while Steve laughed, so whatever had transpired must have been friendly. Tony wasn’t jealous. He wasn’t angry. Or upset at Steve for just
Steve smiled at him. The way he had always smiled at him. The smile he’d missed so much for the past two weeks. “I know you will,” he said with such simple sincerity, such complete trust, that Tony was overwhelmed with both the responsibility and the desire to do exactly that. Giving Steve Rogers everything he wanted was now his number one priority. Nothing would take precedence over that. Over
“Tony told me you weren’t feeling well,” he said gingerly, as if he was picking his words very carefully. “I wanted to...make sure you were alright.”
They sat out on the deck after dinner, catching up, reminiscing, and laughing.  Steve had abandoned his chair and sat on the old wicker sofa, his feet propped up on the table.  Natasha was curled up next to him, her legs tucked under her, head on his chest, arm around his waist.  Steve had thrown his arm around her shoulders and twirled a lock of her hair continuously around his thumb.
He tried to ignore the nose so close to his face. He also tried to ignore that he could feel eyes on him, but finally he couldn’t stand it anymore, and cracked one of his own. “What. Are. You. Doing?” he asked.
Tony laughed and put his phone back into his pocket.  He leaned over the table and blew the candles out one by one.  He looked at the fire in the hearth.  It was nearly burned out, just a blanket of coals and ash.  All it needed was a log tossed in and it would start anew, the flames rising, blazing to life again.  He started away, then came back and tossed two pieces of hickory onto the coals.
Steve pulled him closer, deepening their kisses with a yearning, needy desire. He didn’t want to take advantage of Tony. He didn’t want to hurt him in any way, he loved him far too much for that. All he wanted was to show him how much he meant to him. To give him a physical declaration of just how deep his feelings went. And Tony seemed to want that too. He pulled on Steve’s t-shirt, tugging it fretfully upward, trying to get it out of the way of his questing hands.
“With all due respect,” Nat said, “fuck him.  If Wanda can help, then we can’t let Steve keep suffering.  You said it yourself, honey.  He needs something more than what the doctors are giving him.”
Steve laughed again, and pulled him even closer. He kissed his shoulder, then rested his chin where his mouth had been. “I think we both know who I meant.”
“Not usually,” Steve said. “But to ask for help from you? After all the times I blew you off?” He traced his thumb over Tony’s knuckles, almost absently. “That would have been selfish. More than selfish.
He rode his motorcycle now, the wind cool on his face, the miles coiling out behind him, when he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket.  He pulled over, stopping on the side of the country road and put it to his ear.
“I don’t need a medal,” Sam said, laughing. “Just keep letting me beat you at pool, and I’ll be happy.”
“That’s what it started out as,” Steve said finally. “But now. I don’t know. It’s different over there, Tony.
“Umm,” Steve said, casting a confused/amused eye on him as he came back into the living room and plopped down on a chair.  “Okay.  Why?”
was definitely weird.  Steve didn’t skip classes.  It was so far out of character, Tony could not even wrap his head around it.
“Well,” Tony drawled, “you may have said that other word, that ‘s’ word, but I knew what you meant.”
Ross ignored the bait and allowed Tony to show him the blue-prints.  Tony threw them up in the air, making them almost life-size, so they could walk through them and see how they would work for the team.
At first, it was gentle. Just their mouths. Just a soft brush of a hand through silky blond hair. A parting of lips, then the shy touch of a tongue. It was different than anything Tony had ever experienced. Partly because physically, Steve was just
Tony laughed helplessly, and turned his head until his lips found Steve’s smooth neck. “God, I love you,” he whispered. “You couldn’t take advantage of me, baby. You couldn’t if you tried.”
It probably shouldn’t be.  Sitting here outside this old, abandoned building in the middle of nowhere, miles from anywhere, miles from anything, with no suit, no weapon, no back-up, no FRIDAY, no idea of what to expect, why was it the only thing he could think of was whether or not Steve had kissed him?
“I know,” he said, petting her hair. “I know, sweet girl, but I have to.” He kissed her cheek, then knelt and put her gently on her feet. “But I’ll think about you every day, remember?”
So, yeah, he trusted it.  Part of him even loved it.  There was so much he would have missed out on if he had not taken Erskine’s deal.  So many things he would not have done.  So many people he would not have met.  Peggy.  Natasha.  Tony.  All the things that made up the terrain of his life--the highs and the lows--had come because of the serum.  And he’d helped people, too.  That was all he’d ever really wanted.  To protect the little guy from the bigger ones.  He’d done that.  He was still doing that.
Steve put his face against the side of Tony’s neck and breathed him in.  Tony put his hand on the back of his head, running his hair through his fingers.
“It’s his heart,” Steve said.  “You don’t see it much at first, but the longer you know him, the bigger it gets.  The
Tony fell silent. So silent in fact, an icy sliver of worry slipped into Steve’s heart, making him afraid he’d gone too far. Said something wrong. “Tony?” he asked, timidly. “Tony, did I-”
Sam gripped his shoulders and looked him over. “You look like shit,” he said plainly. “I didn’t want to say it the other night with everybody around, but you look like shit. When was the last time you slept through the night?”
Tony deliberately pushed his hips against Steve’s, feeling the hard length of him. “I can feel that.” Steve ducked his head, that blush heating his cheeks. “Oh god, don’t be embarrassed, baby,” Tony said, and linked his ankles around Steve’s waist, pulling him even closer. “It’s good,” he sighed. “So good.”
“Nah,” Tony said. He laid Morgan down on the couch and covered her with the blanket. “It’s okay.” He bent and kissed her forehead, brushing her hair away. “‘Night, peanut,” he said. She turned her head on the pillow. Her eyelids fluttered.
to talk to Steve. For as long as he had him here, he wanted to talk to him. “How easy this is,” he murmured. “When it’s just you and me. How it only gets hard when we have to bring other people into it.”
Tony sagged against him, secure in the knowledge that Steve would hold him up, and he wasn’t disappointed.  Those arms--those strong, comforting arms--came around him and held him tight.
Natasha slipped her shoe back on and bent down to adjust her stocking, straightening the seam that ran up the back. She was watching Clint openly now. Laura too, but mostly Clint. She pushed her hair behind her ear. “What’s our play?” she asked. “I’ll back you.”
“Hmm. I needed her,” Tony said with not a trace of self-consciousness. “Especially after Morgan left. Apparently, I can not be left alone anymore.”
Okay, okay, I KNOW that Tony Stark would never say anything bad about Natasha.  But, he was really jealous, and jealousy makes us do stupid things sometimes.  And, like he said, he was talking more about Steve than Nat.  That being said, thank you so much for coming this far with me!  Part Two is on the way.  It is set Post-Infinity War, so be prepared for a ton of drama, angst, fighting, and (finally!) kisses.  You are all beautiful!  Thank you!
The grief fell from his face and what replaced it was dreadfully close to the cold, flat look she saw in her nightmares.  More than once, Steve had comforted her when she woke from one of those, holding her and petting her hair until she could sleep again.  She dropped his hand and stood up.
“A week ago, you were telling me you love me, and we were making out like teenagers, and now you want me gone.  That’s fucking crazy, Steve.”
Tony put his arms around Steve’s waist and pulled him closer.  “Okay, Captain Grumpy, what is it?  You’re being all cagey and I don’t like it.”
Steve rolled his eyes and smiled, and suddenly the world was a much, much better place. Lighter. Brighter. Easier. Steve felt it too. Tony could see it in his face, and he felt the remnants of that icy wall between them finally melt away. Steve put his hand into Tony’s and cocked a brow. “You won’t, huh?” he asked, and let Tony tow him in toward him.
He left out some of the more intimate details, the kisses and caresses, the way Steve looked with the razor in his hand, the heavenly feel of Steve’s tongue in his mouth.  He left out, too, his own bout of teenage-style lust.  He was still ashamed of it and hoped he could take that little tid-bit to the grave.
Tony raised his head, his hand snaking back up around Steve’s neck.  “Nothing,” he said.  “We raised the kids’ allowances.”
“We’d better get your memory checked, then, huh?” he said quietly, and grasped Tony’s fingers almost shyly.  He tugged them and Tony leaned down.  It didn’t take much--even seated, Steve was still a big guy--and pressed a kiss against his mouth.
you think about the paparazzi?” he asked. “Are you going to be on TMZ tomorrow? Do I need to have Pepper put out a press-release saying your long lost evil twin decided to come take a dip in the pool before going back into hiding again?”
Steve closed his eyes.  That feeling of peace began to return as Tony’s fingers moved through his hair and brushed over the smooth skin at the back of his neck.  He moved a little, tucking his head under the shelf of Tony’s jaw, and when Tony tightened his grip on his shoulders, Steve knew a moment of happiness that was so deep it hardly felt real.
he was seeing Pepper here in gray sweat pants and an ill-fitting t-shirt with no make-up and her red hair in a simple ponytail just to fuck with him.  Strange would do something like that.  Of course, he would.
There were also spotlights, gates, and guards.  The man was powerful, and maybe not the most honest guy in Washington--which, in this day and age, was probably a plus for him, career-wise--and that necessitated high levels of security.
. He wasn’t thinking about Bucky or Jonathon anymore, so it was working anyway, and that was all that really mattered.
“Yes,” Tony said. He raised one hand and knotted it gently in Steve’s hair. “But I want to hear it from you. I like your voice better.”
Tony walked around the table.  He picked up the tape then put it back down.  Flicked the water bottle with his finger.  He didn’t look at Steve.  “It’s my building,” he said.  “I guess that means I can go wherever I want.”
She wrote her number on a piece of paper and tore if off her pad.  “Call me,” she said.  “Easy or rough, I’ll take it either way.”
Wanda bore down suddenly on Steve’s hands.  Her eyes flared a misty red, clashing with his icy blues.  “I lost my mother and father,” she said deliberately.  “I lost Pietro.  I was used by both Ultron and Thanos.”  Steve winced, but he stopped trying to pull his hands away, and simply looked at her.  “And I lost Vision.”  She looked at him fiercely.  “You helped me carry all that.  Let me help you now.”
“Yeah,” Steve said.  “I do.  I really do.  But Ross was right.  I’m not really allowed.  I should have thought of that.  This whole thing was all my fault.”
Nat, Bruce, Sam, Clint, and Rhodey all sat watching the two of them go at it, their eyes ticking from one side of the room to the other like spectators at a tennis match.  None of them had witnessed a full-blown Steve/Tony yelling match in a long time.  It was funny that they could get so passionate over such a little thing.
Josh nuzzled into Tony’s cheek, his eyes never leaving Steve’s. “Tony’s never mentioned you,” he said.
“Me too,” Steve sighed, and Tony matched him, letting out a breath and slipping off the railing.  He grabbed one of the patio chairs and eased down onto it.  He touched Steve’s arm, his shoulder, cupped a hand around the back of his neck, his thumb caressing the smooth muscle there, as he drew him closer.  Steve came willingly.
“So,” Howard said, “are you bringing Morgan tonight?” His voice was curious but not intrusive and Tony was glad. He’d only allowed Howard to be around Morgan once or twice since they’d moved back, and only for very short periods of time. And never alone. Tony didn’t think he would do or say anything to harm her--at least not now--but he still wanted to keep a very close eye on the situation for now.
They lay together afterward. Bucky and Nat’s bed was larger than Steve’s single one, but it didn’t really matter. They still crowded together on one side, leaving the other untouched. Neither of them thought about it. It just happened. It was just muscle memory.
“It’s okay,” Tony whispered.  “It’s okay.  I’m right here.  Everything's going to be okay.”  He kissed Steve’s shoulder again, then just stayed there, mouth pressed against him, separated from his hot skin by only the thin fabric of his t-shirt until Steve reluctantly released his hand.
“Number one:  You don’t have to ask me if it’s okay.  I’m not the boss of you.  Don’t get me wrong, I love the check-in, but I want us to be equal.  You know, partners.”
Steve shrugged.  “Death isn’t really anything, is it?” he asked.  “I was scared of it for awhile, but after The Raft, I…” He shook his head.  “It’s just a little barrier.  It doesn’t mean anything.  Just that I’ll have to wait again when I die.”  Steve shrugged again, smiling softly.  “You’ll catch up, though, won’t you?  When it’s your time, you’ll find me, right?  And then whatever’s after this, we’ll do it together.  Right, Tony?”
Clint rolled his eyes. “That doesn’t mean I have to think about it. Or care about it. Or listen to you blather on about it. Or-”
Tony sighed in defeat, and took Steve’s hand. He brought it to his mouth and kissed his fingers, making Steve smile even more. “Sometimes I wish I could stay mad at you for longer than three seconds,” he said.
“He was here.  He and Carol were circling, taking down Thanos’ army while Steve, Hulk, and Thor were fighting him on the ground.  They were surrounding him, hemming him in.  Thor and Hulk went for him and when Hulk grabbed him, Thor cut the gauntlet off.  Steve ran for it and threw it to Hulk.  He put it on and snapped.”  She paused, breathing hard.  “Thor  flew up into the air, and Steve was left there alone with Thanos.  There was lightning,” she said, “and thunder, and everything was dark.”  She grasped Sam’s hand.  “Thor threw the axe, and Steve caught it.  He caught it, Sam.  It was like they knew.  Like they both just
s, Steve?” he asked, marveling silently over how easily they had slipped into this banter. “Not really your style.”
Steve looked down at the pieces and uncurled his fingers.  They rolled out of his fist and onto the table.  The fight drained out of him, Tony could see it happening, and his guilt intensified.
Tony thought, as he searched around for a pencil to jot down Billy’s kids’ names so he could show them to Jack.
Steve was frowning a little. Just a little. Like he was worried about something, worried, maybe, about just what the fuck Tony was doing here. “Hey?” turning it into a cool, polite question.
Steve rolled his eyes, but he could see how attached Tony already was.  “You’re delusional,” he muttered, but he’d already given in.  What Tony wanted, Tony got.  And if it made him happy, Steve could put up with it.
It sent shivers down Steve’s spine because he could perfectly remember other situations Tony had smiled like that.
“Well, that would make two of us then”, Steve stated and was not sure whether he should grin like an idiot or sight.
He knew he was taller and stronger, but the way Tony looked down on him made him hold his breath. He needed a few moments to recollect himself: „First of all, I was drunk. Second, you gave me a lap dance and third, I don’t even like you.”, Steve hissed, trying to shove Tony away but the other only pushed him back down, one hand in his hair the other dangerously close to his neck.
“I would not have put it this way, but yes”, Pepper finally stopped her full-on assault and relaxed against the closest wall.
He couldn’t tell who of them had needed it more but it was exactly as he had imagined. He tasted blood on his tongue, his and Tony’s, felt how the other’s hands wandered restlessly over his body before finally settling on his back and in his hair. It was a feeling somewhere between sweet pain and exquisite need. He pressed even firmer against Tony’s body, his hands slipping beneath the shirt, feeling lean muscles and how fast Tony’s breath was going. He heard a groan when he started rubbing the flushed skin and felt how Tony’s fingers tucked deeper into his hair, pulling his body closer and causing their kiss to become even messier. He heard himself moan, felt how heat flooded his body and desire replaced the rest of his pride and sanity.
“And still you’re here, aren’t you?”, the other replied, his fingers once again only centimeters away from Steve’s skin. A constant tease.
They were leaning against one of the kitchen counters covered in white foam and Tony perfectly fit in his arms. It could have been somewhat romantic but his stomach reminded him of the fact that Tony had accidentally ruined their Sunday morning breakfast.
He wasn’t sure if he had ruined it, ruined whatever had been left. He had hoped not to fight, or at least to be honest with each other. But now it felt only worse than before. Because somehow, Tony had managed to make him feel guilty. To hell with that. Tony was gone and was not coming back.
They had been well into their third drink, his head already cloudy – he wasn’t used to drinking that much – , his movements slow and slurry, when music started to play because they had spent enough time in the bar to reach the part of the evening when people used the too small space to dance.
Okay, he could do that too. He closed the space between them, intensifying the atmosphere and adding some tension to their situation. “Well, that you are rich, good-looking, smart maybe. That there’s nobody you haven’t slept with. However, nobody mentioned that you are a spoiled brat.”
Probably that was just how things meant to be between them: a constant imbalance in which both of them struggled to maintain the upper hand. It was a fun thought and it got even better when he pictured all the moments he had managed to overwhelm Tony, when he had made the other moan and beg. They both needed it because otherwise their lives would be lacking something. Steve needed Tony to let off steam, to be the part of himself that wasn’t nice. The thing between them was a more or less stable co-dependency. Made that was the word he had been looking for. It sounded like an appropriate term, simple and clean and also slightly terrifying because he never had been depended on somebody like Tony Stark.
From all the things he had expected Tony to do - and there basically hadn’t been anything he wouldn’t dare Tony to do - it had certainly not been a blowjob. On the other hand: Tony had said he wanted to make him beg. And that sure was a way to manage that.
First of all, he hated admitting mistakes, especially to people that were already arrogant enough, and secondly he awaited derision from Tony. Maybe, if he was lucky and lately he hadn’t been lucky at all, Tony would simply continue to ignore him. However, it was still hard - either way. And felt overall uncomfortable. Finally, he settled on being straight to the point.
“Yeah, because that’s what nothing sounds like”, Tony replied, truly sounding pissed – as if he of all people had a right to be pissed – , “you haven’t been there after school as we agreed upon. In fact, you haven’t even talked to me the whole day”
For one time he seemed like Bucky was the one waiting and not Steve. He got up from the bench and checked his image in one of the mirrors. He looked almost completely normal. Only his hair was still a bit messy and his cheeks a tiny bit redder than normal. It was good enough.
“Never. Especially after you told us about that incident in-“, Sam sounded dead-serious to spoil graphic details of his sex life in public.
“Maybe because you’re a fool?”, Bucky said and held the door open for him, “or because you knew how much fun it would be.”
He swallowed again, this time harder and deeper than before. Tony let out some curse he had never heard of and Steve sensed how the other’s body shook beneath him. He smirked and Tony’s breath hitched, his whole body was moving in his direction and Steve eagerly obeyed.
Steve’s breath got caught again, but when he recollected himself this time, his hands went up to meet Tony’s hips with bruising intense. “I’d rather go for the more violent version”, he hissed.
Bucky shrugged his shoulders and pressed the elevator button: “I know it’s not exactly the best thing in the world, but I’m imagining that you just make him pay for all that bragging. You could seduce his on-off girlfriend. I think Pepper was her name. Or beat him up in some empty corner. Music’s so loud, nobody would hear his screams” Bucky winked and made that really scary facial expression he wore sometimes. Steve was never sure if he was serious about those things or if he only made fun.
He felt hot breath on the sensitive skin of his arousal before he felt oh-so-soft lips touching his oversensitive flesh. His moans were raw and his eyes shut closed, enjoying the sensation of hot breath and soft kisses. His fingers clamped into the sheets, almost desperately, trying to distract themselves from how much they wanted to touch Tony right now. Oh, he would make sure to leave his own marks on the other’s body. A little grin, cunning and dark, danced over Steve’s face.
Sam looked at him with his eyebrows raised suggestively and Steve broke into laughter. Now he was 100% sure that Sam was somebody he liked to hang around with.
Steve was not entirely sure how he’d expected his parents to react. To be honest, he had no idea and with Tony still ghosting though his head there was no time to think closely about it. He’d never stayed anywhere overnight since they had moved to the city and a part of him hoped his parents would be happy about his social life. Which meant they wouldn’t ask that many questions. However, his parents were indeed curious and even though they never had something against him dating boys, they were particular picky about whom exactly he would date. Sometimes Steve considered his parents conservative about this matter. He knew both were liberal in their views of politics and that part of their reason to leave New York was that both of them had not only searched for peace and quiet but also for a friendliness not found in city people, as his dad liked to say. He took a deep breath before he turned the key in the lock and had to admit he was quite nervous. However, he did not expect his parents to stand in the living room, waiting for him. His dad with his arms crossed, looking a tad angry. His mother leaned against the kitchen counter and gave him that reproachful look she had to train in front of a mirror to make it that perfect.
Thought nothing compared to his irritation. He couldn’t stand the other and he was pretty sure Tony disliked him too. So from all the people here on this party, why on earth was Tony offering him a drink in the most suggestive way he had ever seen?
“Why don’t we change position?”, Tony bend down, his lips traveling the same path Steve’s had gone before.
“Drawer you idiot”, Tony hissed, sulking in air as Steve rewarded him with stroking his length. It took Steve not more than a couple of seconds to open the drawer and find what he wanted. From what he could feel and see the whole drawer was full of all sorts of things one could use for sex. He rolled his eyes and sighed deeply. It was so much Tony-like he should have expected it.
“You really missed me”, he said full of mockery but his body started to work against Steve’s, his hips moving against the blonde’s crotch. Tony looked content as a cat when Steve had to close his eyes in bliss, his lips parted and his body shuddering. Steve simply wanted to tear all those close into shreds, finally forcing naked skin to collide. He let out a groan when Tony once again lazily and yet demanding grounded against his body.
“We thought it would be nice for you to leave some steam, to, well, punch into something and imagine it looks like Tony”
“How adorable”, Tony’s voice had changed back to this low tease that filled the other’s head with its intensity, “sure you can keep what you said?”
“Track and field?”, Steve asked not really enthusiastic, “I’ve never been fund of running. There’s no sense behind it”
Tony only lifted his arms defensively, showing his surrender: “Natasha, darling, I only taught him some rules of social life”
Steve spend nights and days thinking about how the heck that had happened and what he was supposed to do now. He thought about telling Sam and Bucky but then decided not to because he already had enough problems. Sam and Bucky would spend the rest of their lives telling him they’d known and in the remaining time they would try to convince him to tell Tony.
If he now admitted it, all of it, it could either end everything – and probably would make his life a living hell – or it could solve everything and maybe he would even get a happy ending.
“Surprised?”, Steve teased and Tony pulled him closer, pressing their lips eagerly together, stealing the bitter taste away from Steve’s lips: “Oh yes”
Instead, Tony laughed softly and finally closed the distance between them, cupping Steve’s face. “Your such an idiot”, he murmured and kissed him.
From the next day on, their deal was working. Steve was surprised how easily it was and how well it went. It was still a bit weird for him having that sort of arrangement, but he grew happier with it every day. He had never met anyone like Tony before and therefore – and for lot of other reasons - it simply seemed to be right.
I'm so sorry it took me so long to update this, but I've been really busy. After my finals, my class has to make a finals movie, and I worte large parts of the script and I'm more or less the director, so I was super busy telling People how they should die (it's a James Bond parody, so all our teachers are the villians).
Steve managed to roll his eyes but went showering nonetheless. He would have had sports after school anyways and was quite glad he packed another set of clothes he could wear instead. There was still a dull ache, anger and sadness, but not as prominent as before, somewhat dried out.
But then it was Tony, Tony who he hated and wanted in ways he couldn’t fully understand. It made him very suspicious and as enjoyable the friction between them was, it was also scary to have some sort of a bond to somebody he didn’t knew nor liked. Maybe it was what both of them needed. He had had his far share of relationships, thought never something like this, never something for him to be truly himself, not only the nice guy.
“If you don’t get going I swear I’ll walk out of this room naked and look for somebody who has more spirit”, Tony threatened and connected their lips in a sloppy kiss. Steve responded to the kiss enthusiastically, biting in Tony’s lower lip until he could taste blood, not asking but demanding. He greedily swallowed up all the moans Tony offered him and when they broke their kiss, he felt his whole body pulsing with need and his mind, his reason, gone somewhere far away.
The movie was fun even thought he had no idea who the characters were and what they were trying to do. Tony gave his best to explain everything, but it ended more or less with him questioning everything that happened and Tony picking on him because apparently the one-horse town Steve was from knew nothing about cinema.
Tony’s lips went further down, placing open mouthed butterfly kisses all over his oversensitive skin. Steve could hear himself panting and felt the shivers running down his spine as well as the heat in his stomach. He also felt Tony’s stares and knew that the other’s dirty little smile added right up to his own arousal. Steve could already imagine where this one was going but he wasn’t quite able to believe it.
Steve looked at him for a long, long moment until his face spread into a large grin and he held out a hand for his lover. “You get rid of it, sex twice as long as we’re not on a mission”, he agreed.
He liked the sex, and when Tony had been so close once again, he had thought of it again, felt the urge and the need, knew that he was craving for more. Knew that he still was.
Madness aka the next semester is going to start soon (but I am looking forward to it) so I thought better now than never. Plus, I had some spare time after I passed all the exams from my last semester.
“Have you heard about it?”, Sam wanted know, his voice low and unsettling. He was clearly nervous. Steve was puzzled. He had no idea what this was about.
Steve was only a millimeter thin line of control away from slamming Tony against the next wall. Hard.
“Say ‘please’”, his lips were close to Steve’s hear without touching it. Steve shuddered beneath the warm breath. He looked at Tony and knew that this would only end if he admitted that he came back, willingly. It made him angry and yet he was sure that he could repay Tony somehow, make things even again.
Tony also started giving him nicknames. Steve hated it, especially because each and every nickname Tony came up with was absolutely horrible. One time he even suggested Country Pumpkin. Steve had protested for all he was worth but as always Tony had been way better with words than Steve had been.
Once, something new and unusual happened just when Steve had settled on the fact that there was nothing between them, certainly not love.
Steve had seen her before and had admired her red hair and delicate features but feared her sharp voice and toughness. Now she appeared behind the crowd, that divided itself in front of her like she was a goddess to admire. She seemed furious.
There was playfulness and humor in her voice. Steve settled on liking her even thought she was befriended to Tony and kind of scary.
Tony – obviously having lots of experience – relaxed beneath him and his eyes did not leave Steve’s. His gaze was still full of hunger and lust, full of challenge, ordering him to act. Steve couldn’t help to close his eyes in bliss when he entered the other’s body, feeling the warm tightness all around him. Tony let out a long, outstretched moan and a low chuckle when he saw Steve’s closed eyes. Steve felt the need to make him shut up before he could say anything mean so he decided that there was not exactly a need for a break, settled his hands on the other’s body and started moving. He had hoped to take Tony by surprise but instead it seemed like Tony was surprising him. He eagerly pushed back, intensifying the friction and pulling their bodies closer, leaving not the slightest space between their bodies. It was a feeling like burning. They felt like one but still Steve could sense the competition, the roughness, the fight between them violent in many different ways. Tony’s lips were parted, his eyes still hungry and his body probably on the edge between utter bliss and pain. He also seemed to enjoy it very much and when Steve found himself capable of speech – and clear thinking – again, he couldn’t resist tasting the other’s skin, drinking in his moans and whines and couldn’t keep quiet himself.
Steve sighed. School couldn’t get any worse than this. Nobody was more curious than his mother anyways.
“Because of Pepper, right? I’m flirting with here. And dating…”, Tony left the sentence unfinished, but his voice had lightened up a bit.
He formed his hands into fists, trying to control whatever emotions boiled in him. It was only mildly working. He saw how Tony sensed the exact moment his self-control was about to shatter into a million pieces.
"You should know", he stated, his hips moving in rhythmical little circles, driving Steve breathless, "that I love challenges"
“You’ll drink more of it than I’ll”, Steve grinned at him and it was probably the first time he had somewhat close to fun this evening.
“We really want you to have friends and a social life, and maybe you can’t get away from rich kids like Tony Stark because they are the center of this universe, but please don’t start a relationship with somebody who is as spoiled as this Stark must be. We left the city when I was pregnant because we wanted to spare you from those people. People like Tony Starks.”, his mother sighed and resigned, his father continuing to guilt-trip him.
For long, precious moments they just stood there, enjoying the other’s presence. It was like finally coming home and maybe that was what it was indeed. When they left their embrace, Steve was instantly longing for the closeness again.
“Well, at least I know the reason for us standing here now”, Sam said from behind him and came to greet Bucky. He was still laughing and it was basically one of the most likeable laughs Steve ever heard. He had no doubts they would get along way too nice.
today (it's a beautiful, rainy autumn day and I am in my second last week of holidays) I got into the perfect mood to write and finally managed to complete the next chapter.
“Honestly?”, he murmured and eyed at his watch. Well, still 15 seconds to go for a new record. And Bucky seemed to be determined to break it. Sam only stood next to him and laughed.
“Are you in love with me then?”, another question, asked by Tony’s abnormally calm and steady voice.
Steve watched him and knew that his was – as everything between them – another sort of challenge. And maybe an offer.
“You could say so, yes. On the other hand: I had to help in the garden and working on the house since I’m six. I kind of turned out to be an active person”, Steve explained glancing again at the clock. It seemed like Bucky was about to break his record in being late from yesterday another time. Steve already looked forward to his colorful excuses. He always came up with the most interesting stories to explain himself.
“I’d offer to help you with that”, he started and chuckled at Steve’s shocked expression, “but your nerves wouldn’t stand it I think” With one hand he brushed through his hair, then he turned around. “See you tomorrow”, was the last thing he said. He managed to make even those harmless words sound lewd.
Steve felt shivers running down his spine, felt his body tense. He wasn’t sure whether it was from anticipation or from the way Tony had managed to let a threat, a challenge, sound like a sweet promise. He longed for it in a way he couldn’t explain, couldn’t express. It was just there as where Tony’s body above and the other’s seductive smile. He saw how Tony licked his lips, craving, watching him, teasing him, luring him into the same kind of trap. He knew he’d probably - most likely - regret everything as soon as he’d leave this room, but he didn’t care. There was something about Tony that made him curious and that always managed to get him into trouble. So he didn’t move an inch when Tony, still over him, still smirking like a cat that caught itself a bird, bent down to kiss him. It was one of those kisses that left you without breath and without a sense for reason. Not anymore. It was that kind of kiss that was not about affection but about possession, control, and Steve let Tony take all of it. The other’s mouth, hands, his whole body were roaming over him, were just there. He found himself in a position he couldn’t resist as a tiny tree couldn’t resist a storm.
“Not at all. Our parents used to work for the same company. Now that company settled to move to the city and it offered to some employee that they could move too so they can keep their job. Bucky’s parents said yes immediately because they came from a big city before moving at the little village I’m from. My parents were more hesitant, so Bucky’s been here for almost a year. He’s doing great. Has more friends than I can count and rocks being one of the most popular people in college.” He made a pause, looking at his clock again and grimaced: “Which may be the reason he’s always late to pick me up “
I am (after some experience) not promising to get the last (or the last two) chapters done soon, but as always I will try. Maybe the fact that it's going to be the ending will get me to work faster.
“But you should now that I like it both ways”, he whispered as you would whisper sweet nothing’s in the ear of somebody else, moving his body over Steve’s, towering above him. “And you got to fuck me into this damn bed so I wonder what I get in return”, Tony’s mean grin sent shivers down Steve’s spine.
And now when it hurt so badly, it made him wondering if Tony ever felt something similar to what he had been, to what he felt now. Probably not.
The moment Tony's body really moved, bucking himself into Steve, simulating little thrusts, Steve lost it. A low, suppressed moan escaped him, and Tony just did it again. His fingers started to move, caressing his skin and holding him still, keeping him at the mercy of the other. He had had (having some dark secrets Steve) lap dances before, but he never wanted to tear somebody's clothes of right at the beginning.
"So they’ve been dating all the time?", he asked and tried to sound casual while every vocal burnt on his tongue and tasted like ashes.
It had been comfortable to just sit there, Steve staring at the wall and Tony scribbling down stuff. It was not what they usually did, not at all. Steve sighed. He was not in the mood for anything that involved moving his sore bones, particularly not sex and Tony seemed to be absorbed with his new project. He shifted and lay down. It hadn’t been his intention to make Tony fall of the bed and after all, it was not his fault when Tony cowered on the very edge of it. He heard a little sound and Tony cursing before the other got up and looked at him, eyebrows raised.
Steve also remembered the one time they went to the cinema and he honestly believed for a full 10 minutes they were there to watch a movie. But Tony had proven him wrong and in the aftermath, Steve wondered how he could have thought that going to the movies with Tony would ever be normal.
“I’ve no idea how I survived before Netflix existed”, he stated when he turned the TV on, scrolling through his collection of movies and series.
“That was when he was about 15 or stuff like that. Youthful folly. And now calm down and tell me everything.”
Sam knew about it the next day in school and Steve was almost surprised he hadn’t texted him before. Bucky must have told him the second Steve had left the car.
“What is he then?”, his mother wanted to know and her eyes locked Steve right where he was standing. “A name wouldn’t be bad”, she added.
“What do you think?”, he purred in Tony’s ear, his breath warm and his voice rough, “how does this one end?”
“Yes, definitively yes”, Tony winked at him, his lips parting for a quick second. Steve really wanted to kiss him, biting those lips, tasting blood.
The worst thing was: Steve knew he should and yet he couldn’t. He wanted to, badly even. He imagined how it could go, how he would explain everything and then Tony would either laugh because it truly was ridiculous or return his feelings. It made his stomach curl when he thought about being turned down, about losing everything they had.
Tony took a step back from him, wiping away invisible dirt from his elbow where he had touched the other. It was all a big show. And the audience started cheering as if he had tamed a tiger or climbed on the Mount Everest.
“Not today”, Sam sounded sorry and Steve raised an eyebrow. How very interesting. “But maybe another time”, Sam’s smile was bright and encouraging and Steve could feel how Bucky next to him was as cheerful as a child on Christmas day.
Tony’s voice grew louder now, angrier: “You told me that we would not get involved with each other. End of the story.”
“I wouldn’t call it a fight. More showing somebody some rules”, Tony replied, his tone in a subtle way very calm and dominant.
“Remember it’s all your fault”, he hissed at nobody particular, before he turned around to face Steve.
“Well, maybe I’m just not interested in seeing your face anymore”, Steve spat and wasn’t sure if the alcohol was making him this aggressive or if his built up emotions were giving him more bravery than usual.
Tony made his last, desperate move to get away with wearing his own merchandise. Flirting always was his last retort. “I could get out of it”, he mused, his lips and breath hot on Steve’s skin. Steve stayed strong.
“You may not be that inexperienced, but you do not make me beg. That’s my part”, Tony purred, his voice almost too soft for the situation.
“I suspected you to have more self-control”, Steve chuckled even thought he was pretty needy himself now.
At some point - the villain had just released an army of monsters - Steve felt himself dozing off. The last thing he remembered was mumbling something about how illogical that part was and Tony correcting him with a long monologue about something very complicated. It involved at least seven other movies Steve hadn’t seen. Probably, that was the reason why his mind decided that sleep was the best Option.
Still he felt the other’s body shivering and clenching around him. He was in control. He should be in control. Maybe it was an illusion, maybe they were still in the middle of a fight without any battle won. On the other hand making Tony beg and scream was all he needed and wanted right now, all he cared for right now. He buried is head in the kihle between Tony’s head and shoulder, knowing that he now covered the other’s body almost completely, intensifying their touch, adding friction, adding closeness, domination. He could sense every tiny motion of Tony now, experienced how his muscles clenched with every shallow movement he made, enjoyed how Tony’s mouth let out the quietest moans as soon as he shifted a bit.
“I was participating in social life”, Steve mumbled awkwardly and kept standing in front of the door, his fingers playing with the shoulder straps of his bag.
There were nights in which he couldn’t sleep, wasting all of his energy to think about him and Tony and what they were and weren’t. Yet, after all the headache this topic had caused him, he still hadn't found a proper term for them. It was not friendship nor romance or simply sex.
“How did you know?”, he wanted to know instead and it was true curiosity and not just the urge to change the topic.
“We already figured that out”, his mother chuckled amused and shot his father a meaningful look. She was really good with these too.
“I don’t think we should do that again”, Steve said, his voice firm but not as persuading as he had hoped it to be.
They discovered that aside from English they also had American Studies together. Steve would have preferred him in all his classes, simply because his wide happy smile was catching and charming and felt familiar. His first new friend. It felt amazing.
“Can’t you figure that out yourself?”, Tony came closer, his Cheshire Cat like grin deepened and the way he spoke turned into a purr.
“I really can’t believe you have more of a sex life than I have”, Bucky sat next to him nipping on a coke and looked at him mildly distressed, “I never thought that weird deal would work out”
“Poison? You would die too", Bucky laughed and simply took one glass filled with green and yellow liquid.
Bucky was about to start the motor when he just stopped, blinked and looked once again at Steve. His eyebrows rose and a big smile appeared on his face. Steve had not even enough time to roll his eyes before Bucky realized: “Oh, that’s what kept you busy”
But helpfully my friends came up with lots of funny cocktail names so I could keep writing. Big thanks to them!
Steve moved deeper, easing the grip on Tony’s hands so he could use one of his own hands to pull Tony closer, preventing him from moving away or against the touch. He could feel the resistance in Tony’s body that vanished immediately when his lips circled around his already hardening nipples. He heard breath itching and was not sure whether it was his or Tony’s. He felt even more heat building in his groin and he felt Tony arching into his touch, whining and moaning. He did not beg. Not yet at least. He kept teasing for a while, sensing Tony’s impatience and his own. But he could prove patience. He could wait, he would wait for the pleasure to see Tony beg, to see him give in. He would love to see that. He started sucking on the first nipple, feeling the flesh hardening. More moans form Tony. Still no pleas. The other’s breath was heavy now, his hands were fighting against their boundaries thought he did not really try to get away. They both knew Tony enjoyed it. And they both knew that this was still a battle. When Steve finally brought his teeth to the sensitive flesh, Tony broke. He could sense it in the way Tony’s body arched desperately and by the way he first tried to muffle his moans the first time this night. Steve could feel his lips curve into a vicious grin. His eyes locked with Tony’s.
Probably ‘no’ was the best thing he could have said in this situation, the cleverest and healthiest thing to do. He was still shocked he didn’t say it.
He looked a t Tony for a painful long moment and searched for glues. Tony looked not as flamboyant and cocky as normal. His face was torn between mild anger and honest care.
Sometimes, when Steve let his mind roam free, he knew Sam was right. There was more to their relationship now than sex and fun, and certainly more than hate and disgust. Tony had become part of his life. He locked him away, separated him from everything else, but when he thought about it, truly considered it, he maybe appeared in the stories Tony told somebody else.
He took in Tony’s scent, took in every inch of his body, of the way his muscles curled when Steve’s hands moved over his sensitive spot. Steve ripped a low, primal sound form Steve’s lips when his hand wandered beneath the hem of his trousers. Fierce, amused eyes met his and only seconds later Tony’s mouth comfortable settled on the brink of his neck, sucking and biting the skin. The hickeys would be left there for anybody to see and Steve oddly enjoyed the idea, the feeling of being marked. He continued to let his hands roam, drawing lazy circles on Tony’s lower belly so he could see how Tony’s breath hitched and moans escaped his mouth. There were still fingers in his hair that now travelled down his back, leaving hot hand prints on his skin and even more marks. Still, the friction wasn’t enough, their bodies separated by too much clothes, by too much everything. He pulled the other closer and Tony grinned at him, his voice low and promising.
“We can definitely help with that”, Natasha laughed too and there was that sneaky, wicked undertone in her voice that made Steve shiver. Hopefully she was never going to be angry at him.
He looked forward to school, which he hadn’t expected, to meeting his friends of whose existence he was still amazed, and weirdly he looked even forward to seeing Tony Stark again, who he still hated more than everybody else. But he had to come up with some revenge for that horrible nickname after all…
It was painful to say it aloud especially because he had never truly said it before, never dared to admit it to anybody else. And now it turned out he had been wrong about it the whole time. A lie. A lie he had told himself because he wanted to see a version of Tony that wasn't there. He sighed and Sam sighed too.
The flat was nice and fancy and luxurious. Steve could almost sense the expensive furniture and the cleaning squad going through here every day. What he could definitively smell was the alcohol. He should have expected Tony Stark to throw party in his extravagant way.
He was about to leave the restroom without another word when Tony interrupted him. He seemed to have recovered from his confusion and was confident and arrogant again. “You still don’t like me?”, Tony’s voice became cunning again, “and I thought you enjoyed fucking me…” His eyes locked with Steve’s and the grin in the brown-haired’s face was as wide and as suggestive as always.
He caught Steve’s movement in midair and forced the glass filled with a weird looking yellow-whitish liquid right to his lips. Steve had no chance and most likely no other choice. He emptied the whole glass with two gulps. It was not exactly tasting bad, but sharp and strong like somebody mixed vodka and wine together and colored it with food coloring.
“After all your teasing, shouldn’t I be the one making you beg?”, he growled, strengthening the pressure against Tony, feeling him reacting to his touch with eagerness.
“And I have-?” “Yes. Or are you suffering from some sort of memory loss?”, Tony said and his voice was somewhere between poison and annoyance.
“That would only be half as fun”, Tony interrupted him, his cocky grin still present, “and I thought”, his voice became low and seductive again, “you want to have fun, little pumpkin?”
The lube felt cold and slippery on his fingers, but he knew that feeling all too well and it calmed him somewhat down, that fucking Tony would be no different than fucking anybody else. Besides being totally different. He had never felt an urge that had been that big, to fight, to claim, to surrender all at the same time. He couldn’t even tell apart what was lust, what hate and what probably affection. It was that mixture that made his mind spin and his body shudder under every of Tony’s touches. And it was this special mix that was now demanding its tribute. His hands found their way to Tony’s ass again, cupping it, admiring it. Tony only snarled and his body moved against Steve’s without any patience now.
I am sorry this took me so Long, but my finals are in less than a week and I was really busy with learning.
“You’ve no idea what I could do to you”, Steve’s grip tightened, maybe leaving bruises on the others skin.
"It's nothing stable...", Sam started but struggled to explain how that was supposed to make anything better.
“No need to be like that. You got an excellent fuck and had fun. I could understand you whining if you just lost your virginity. But I think I’ve already mentioned that that’s not the case.”
Steve could see the way Bucky glanced at Sam, longingly, and saw how Sam’s feet were restless beneath the table. They obviously wanted to dance and were holding back because of him.
“You are a perfect match for me, aren’t you?”, Tony’s lips moved on his, and this time the movement was rough and demanding and so much like Tony it took Steve’s breath away. He answered the kiss, his lips opening slightly, welcoming the other tongue. He could feel Tony biting his bottom lip, felt no regret when he tried the same and tasted blood at some point. It felt good, it felt right and he wouldn’t want it another way.
“Is something bothering you?”, the other asked and there was something like concern in his voice. Honestly? Steve wanted to laugh. He did not because he felt weaker than he had hoped he would.
It hurt and Steve could do nothing about it. He had known from the beginning that Tony was a playboy and had no romantic interest in him, he had known that their whole relationship was based on challenging each other, not on love.
Tony moved down further, his hands massaging his tights now, teasing, brushing over his middle so carelessly it couldn’t be a coincide. It drove Steve crazy. He always was on edge, either because of fingers drawing on his skin or because of hot breath making him shudder. It was too slow and too fast at the same time. He heard himself moan and then groan when teeth were too firm on his skin, then he had to sought again. And finally, there where fingers on the elastic of his pants. He could feel how they hooked in the fabric and he saw Tony looking up at him, his face spread into a wide smirk and his eyes sparkling with suggestiveness. It took another painful second of battles between their glances before he started pulling down Steve’s pants. He didn’t do anything else.
It seemed like a total change had gone through the brown-haired man. His movements were slow and seductive, his eyes dark and challenging, his slightly parted lips a silent threat.
Steve sighed. Sometimes, it was really hard to understand his parents. They were so liberal in their views, they didn’t care about his sexuality, but they deeply distrusted everybody who had enough money for a proper two weeks holiday trip.
Sam and Bucky tried to shield him from most of it, but they were only human and hadn’t yet mastered the art of splitting themselves into multiple people to be omnipresent. He was alone in some of his classes, alone with Tony in one even, and that was enough. His thoughts seemed to be defiant whenever he tried to ease them into something that was not anger or longing, something that didn’t have to do with Tony Stark. But they rebelled and kept spinning like an absurd merry-go-round with himself in it except for the ‘merry’ part.
Because Tony undeniable was part of his life. Given the time he spent talking about him when Sam and Bucky were around, Tony probably was the third most important person in his life. It was a shocking realization and certainly, talking or even considering this topic was poison.
Steve was not sure how exactly he managed to maintain his “relationship” with Tony when he most of the time felt like he wanted to rip the other’s throat out. Thought it was kind of a good feeling. He needed the anger Tony could made him feel. It was relieving and somewhere deep inside of his brain, Steve knew that he was longing for all those anger and the roughness.
“I’m as curious as everybody else. C’mon, I need that gossip!”, he lowered himself down, brining himself face to face with the blonde. “Just act like we’re discussing this insanely boring book.” He gave Steve an encouraging smile.
“We are not here to watch a movie, are we?”, he whispered as the hand began to slowly travel upwards.
Unsurprisingly, only minutes later they had once again managed to end up undressing each other while involuntarily testing each other’s patience. Tony had found it funny to whisper that insufferable nickname in Steve’s hear every time he had the chance to. Steve had made sure he would limp the next day. Tony never complained. Sometimes, Steve felt like the other provoked him intentional, making their sex even rougher. Sometimes Steve himself was the one with a limp and sometimes both of them were scared they had broken something. Which hadn’t been the case yet.
“This is all your fault”, he stated breathlessly while getting a bottle of lube from the close drawer, “yours and that of your horrible clothing”
As some of you may have recognized, English is not my first language, and therefore I always try to improve my English. If I've made some mistake all the time, feel free to tell me so I can improve my writing
Bucky only shot him a wide grin: “That’s the fun thing Steve. God, you really need to learn something about modern life.” He bopped Steve before he pulled him straightly forward to the guy serving the drinks. Honestly, Tony Stark was the only person who had staff serving drinks at school parties. That was so extravagant and unnecessary the blonde had to clench his teeth. If he was ever offered a chance to pay Bucky back for this, he would gladly take it. But first, he would have to get drunk. He sighed and Bucky gave him that annoyed, funny face he always made when Steve snarled and sighed loudly.
Tony’s mouth went back to tearing his skin again and his fingers left Steve body, leaving him longing for what was coming next. “Let’s find out how much exactly you can take”, Tony muttered, his voice was rough but there was still promise in there and it was sweet as poison. Probably it was also a threat.
“You do like it”, Tony simply stated and Steve was glad nobody realized what they were doing or how redness filled his cheeks. He did like it. And there was no way he’d admit it. Still, Tony had won.
This time their kiss was rather tame thought much more heated and intense than before. Steve kept his eyes fixed on Tony. Tony wanted him to prove his point. Well, he would. His lips moved down Tony’s neck as a mixture of sloppy, open mouthed kisses that would leave hickeys and little bites that would leave marks. He enjoyed the idea of marking Tony, of making him his. Not because he wanted nobody else to touch him but because he wanted to show his power. Tony moaned, loud and shameless, his eyes were sparkling with lust.
Steve looked at Tony, considering a long moment to just do nothing, to torture him, to enjoy him writhing beneath him. Then, however, he was painfully reminded of his own hard-on as Tony intensified the friction between their bodies. Well, keeping the other waiting until he was nothing more than begs and pleas had to wait. He felt the heat radiating from Tony’s body and felt bound to look at the other’s suggestive smirks. It was impossible how fast Tony caught him again. If he hadn’t known better he would feel like a fly in the web of a spider. But he knew better. Knew that Tony was the one being caught and “tied” up. He smirked himself, enjoying the thought of himself being the one dominant, not the boy from nowhere, knew to everything and weird to everybody else.
Steve bitterly thought about all the people who enjoyed falling in love. His problem was, that he enjoyed it too. Being in love with Tony Stark made things better and worse at the same time. One moment, Steve saw something, a tiny gesture, a smile, that made him believe everything was going to be fine, the next moment he realized that he had no idea what Tony exactly felt for him. So he hid the smiles that crept on his face whenever Tony did something that made him hope and acted like everything was alright when he felt like nothing would ever be alright again. It hurt to pretend nothing had changed.
“Fun fact”, Natasha added, “they don’t even know each other really. And I thought there was not such thing like love – or hate- on the first sight.”
Tony looked at him, a smirk settling on his lips: “I’m sorry darling, but you are a country pumpkin.” Steve only glared at him. Murderously.
He tried to relax, tried to stop any noises falling from his mouth but Tony was not going easy on him. He couldn’t even tell what the movie was about while he was trying to control his body, to stop it from shaking and to stop his hips from moving. And probably also to stop himself from beating Tony.
“Interested in an orgasm?”, a rough, seductive voice breathed right into Steve’s ear. He flinched and felt goosebumps running down his spine. It should be forbidden for everybody to talk in such a tone. Especially if your name was Tony Stark.
Steve only glared at him and let out a huff of disapproval: “Well, I normally always expect the best from people. But if you’re okay with me assuming you’re having a bad character…”
As far as I have plotted this story out, there are only one or two (depending on whether I will split it in two parts or not) more chapters before this fic ends. Which would make this the first longer story I ever completed (which is absolutley amazing!!!)
I hope you liked Sam. The next chapter is going to be longer again, so that's an excuse for this one being so short.
“That’s true. But actually, I know Bucky from before I moved. We’ve been friends since I’m 7 years old.”, Steve smiled at the memories.
“I think we already talked plenty enough”, Steve spat, turning around, leaving the mess he created and Tony alone.
“I am afraid we don’t have a choice after being locked in here”, Steve replied, his voice shaking because of Tony who had gone to nibble at his neck, making him gasp for air.
He would probably feel Steve for days after and he welcomed it, welcomed the roughness, the way their mouths and tongues collided. His hands were still pinned against the wall, his arching body caught between solid stone and Steve’s body towering over him. It was just right and not enough. His own erection was so hard it hurt, his body desperately craving for release, his lips as red and swollen as Steve’s.
Tony only shot him a glare that eventually hinted his soon-to-be murder but Steve only grinned and kept lazily circling Tony’s ass before he finally slid a finger in. He felt Tony hissing and muscles clenching but it took only a few seconds before Tony adjusted and his body started to move against the intrusion. He heard those little moans escape Tony and he could have sworn that Tony was only holding back. He smirked, placing kisses on the other’s neck and felt Tony’s body urging towards him. The hotness inside of him, around him, radiating from Tony’s body stopped him from being much more of a tease.
“He’s not my friend”, Steve said automatically before he really realized he had opened his mouth. That may have been a bit thoughtless, especially when he saw his father’s eyebrows rising further.
