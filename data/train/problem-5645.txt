“I could erase you,” he tries, digging at the cruelty he once wielded so easily. Why is it so difficult, now? “I could make sure we never find you in the ice. No one would be the wiser, Steve. I could end all of our conflicts before they even begin.”
together. Steve has no claim on the man, publicly or privately, and he’s violently reminded of it the moment he catches sight of Tony in a lively conversation with a beautiful blonde-haired woman. Obviously that’s not an unusual occurrence-- most of the patrons in attendance tonight are beautiful in their own right, even if Steve doesn’t think their personalities do much to match. He’s used to seeing Tony being especially charming with the women, and this is hardly the first woman he’s spoken to
The memories flit by on hummingbird wings, milliseconds of immeasurable memories, safety and happiness bleeding from them like golden ichor. Perhaps Tony was right to liken himself to a God.
Looking back at his life, Steve would say that being in the army and a soldier was the easy part. He had orders, people to protect, he followed the orders, he saved people. Simple. Maybe sometimes it was brutal, some decisions more painful, but the goal was always clear.
"What?" Tony suddenly asked, and Steve noticed that Figaro was sitting at the bottom of the couch, his tail doing some twitchy movements. Sometimes it did happen, that during his playtime, Figaro tossed the scrunchie somewhere and needed assistance in getting it out, which was the current case. "You flung it under the couch, get it out yourself," Tony told his cat, sounding offended.
The answer should be obvious. Just Tony took a second too long to answer when he thought about the divine combo of melted mozzarella and spicy pepperoni on a thin crust. “Well - ack!” Tony yelped, suddenly knocked down on the couch, yelp changing into laughter when hands latched to his sides and quick fingers kneaded the soft skin. “AH! Waitwait hahahaa! I dihihihidn’t say anythihihing!”
Steve felt guilty. Maybe he reacted too harshly. He looked at the mirror, trying to imagine himself with long hair and makeup. "Would I have to wax my body?"
"Tony, you did so much for me, I don't think I can ever thank you," Sarah said, putting her manicured hand on Tony's cheek and smiling warmly. She didn't mean only the makeover, but it also played a role, helping her feel comfortable in her skin once more. The biggest change was in Steve - she saw her son standing a little taller and prouder, flourishing thanks to the relationship he had with Tony. Of course, she would prefer both of them to be honest with her from a start, but after Steve had told her Tony's story, his background, his fears, and the rejection, she knew she couldn't ask of him to confide into, after all, a stranger. The perspective of building a good, trusting relationship from this moment, was good enough for her.
Steve stepped into the spacious workshop. Before he noticed any people, he saw the cars first and whistled quietly. Those were some expensive brands. No surprise here, as those workshops were considered one of the best.
He really, really, really needed to pee. And Tony locked himself in the bathroom because apparently, that was what drag queens did in their free time, which was spending the said time on grooming themselves. Okay, maybe not all, as Steve couldn't imagine Bucky with a facial mask on and cucumber slices on his eyelids, but it was definitely a thing that Tony did. Somehow Steve couldn't imagine himself banging on the door and demanding Tony to leave his home spa, just because he had a need. There should be some intimacy in their relationship.
“That’s the one that doesn’t like me, right?” Steve squinted his eyes, pointing at the last comment. Tony laughed and nosed Steve’s cheek playfully.
"You think I named myself after a cake?" Red laughed, and it sounded more like Tony than Red, to be honest. "It is because the first dress I wore as a drag queen was made of red velvet. It is not a very friendly material, to be honest, it is a bit heavier than others and you get hot quickly, but it is really nice to the touch. Nowadays my dresses are mostly made of satin. I would really like to try some dresses made of charmeuse, but I don't have the figure to pull it off. You have no idea what I am talking about, do you?" Red laughed, and Steve closed his opened mouth.
Steve shrugged with a boisterous smile. "There is not much to tell. Some kid pushed me and I fell into the dirt. When I turned around, Bucky was the first person I saw so I assumed he was the one who pushed me and I lounged myself at him. Bucky tried to shake me off, but I kept pummeling him so he started to hit me back, while all the other kids were cheering. Bucky gave me a black eye and I punched him in the jaw, busting his lip. When blood started to gush out, other kids got scared and scattered, and I and Bucky were the only ones left. I told Bucky to come with me because my mom is a nurse and she would fix it. Mom did patch us up but she also whooped our asses for fighting."
“It’s a matter of getting used to. The better wigs, the less pain. You can take a look at mine, there are in the closet,” Red Velvet said, pointing him in the right direction.
“Oh,” Steve said, carding his fingers through the short hair on the back of Tony’s head. Tony shivered, just slightly, from the light touch, smiling against Steve’s skin and Steve felt an urge to touch him all over. This time differently, more aware and more intimate, paying closer attention to the reactions. “So… you wanna do it?”
"Seriously, I have no words," Tony continued, and Steve continued to not talk, just observing and listening, somehow secretly enjoying Tony's ramble and curious how far it would go.
Steve watched Tony closely. The way his shoulders trembled, droplets of sweat appeared on his face, his eyebrows and lips twitching with every well measured touch. Steve took his time, exploring every inch of sensitive skin, finding what worked the best, and focusing on that, enjoying every emotion showing on his husband's face. At some point, Tony couldn't stay upright anymore and bend in, digging both hands into Steve's sides, just having to hold to something, and obediently, not letting out a full-formed moan. Just those small, wonderful whimpers, trying to make their way out of the pressed together lips. Steve was mesmerized, never knowing how tempting he could find the image of Tony trying to keep it quiet be.
Red had to stop and lowered the cotton pad in her hand. "You are really fixated on the topic of sweets today, aren't you?" she smiled and Steve smiled back in a lopsided way. "Actually, I came up with that, but she was the one who allowed it to stay. I called her like that once, because- ughh," Red's smile became a little wider, "okay, that was mean of me, but her first tucks looked like she stuffed a bar of tootsie roll in her pants. It was not completely hidden. So, it kinda stuck."
It was nice. Their bodies pressed together, moving in one rhythm. The wet sound and the heat. Very nice.
"Please? You are closer to the door," Tony reasoned and while it was true, Steve grunted again, knowing that his boyfriend just wanted to torment him more. Dragging one foot at a time and walking in slow, wobbly steps, Steve had made it to the door, just in time as the person on the other side started to rattle on the doorknob impatiently.
Steve pulled his eyebrows together, thinking that it all was a bit odd because taking the night robe meant that Tony wasn't sneaking off to his workshop, he didn't go to the adjoined bathroom either and leaving the bed seemed a bit random.
Tony didn't say anything, just lowered his head. He could feel that Steve was genuinely worried about him and it wasn't some act. Just why?
Sam just frowned deeper and for a moment, Steve sensed the tension in the air. He almost backed away, knowing that it was better to give his friend plenty of time to process, when it was Sam who first loosened up and lowered his shoulders, seemingly accepting what he heard.
"Oh my gosh, how did you even - " Steve laughed, still not believing what he was seeing. He was an artist and had a good eye for color, but it was like Tony used the whole palette of red and pink shades and sprinkled random Valentine's day accents all over their bedroom, from the cheesiest giant pastel pink teddy bear, ending on the enormous deep red bouquet of royal roses.
“You are Steve Rogers, right?” the guy asked, growing weary of the silence. “Please don’t tell me I made a mistake and just grabbed a random stranger.”
“And what everyone is doing here? Just a little shopping,” she said, pointing Steve’s attention to the few products in her basket. Her eyes widened when she saw Steve’s brimming one. “Or not so little,” she said, looking confused when she noticed a lipstick displayed proudly on top and other makeup products Tony had recently picked.
“We would love to accompany you! Right, Steve?” still no answer. “I know he would,” Tony decided in Steve’s name and took Sarah’s basket, handing it to Steve. “Make yourself useful, huh?” he whispered to Steve, and the sore tone he used grounded Steve back. Feeling that he screwed up, he quietly padded after his mom and Tony, holding two baskets, Tony already hooking arms with his mom like if they were best friends, as they were discussing makeup and skin care, and Tony was charming and polite, and Steve acted like an idiot.
"Well, I didn't want someone else to swoop in and take you away from me," Steve teased, brushing his cheek over the top of Tony's head. He smelled like the soap used in the paintball place bathroom, which was a rather neutral smell, but there was some very Tony scent lingering. "People should know that such a pretty thing like you is taken."
“There. Now do me,” Tony handed Steve the container, smiling adorably. Steve repeated what Tony did to him, careful to not coat any unruly hair trying to make their way out of the headband. He was with Tony in his bathroom, somehow agreeing to a home spa evening. “Should I put it on your beard?” Steve asked, unsure what to do.
“No,” came a quick answer, too quick and delivered in a fully awake voice, and Tony cringed, realizing that he gave himself away. Steve smiled broadly and did the only reasonable things - he grabbed the edge of the white covers and strongly rubbed it over brunet’s face.
Steve laughed and rolled on his side, looking at Tony with adoration. Laughing made Tony ten times more attractive in Steve’s eyes, and Tony was off the scale to start with.
Tony laughed and turned to Steve, pressing their lips together in a kiss. Long and sweet. The kind of kiss that was the perfect happy ending to a tickle kink coming out story.
"And night. I don't think it is safe to go to the bedroom yet," Tony pointed out, not wanting to risk another attack.
Steve's shoulders jumped after hearing the voice. He looked at Bucky, full name James Barnes, his best friend, standing near his locker and getting out of the books needed for today's classes.
"It's probably nothing big," Tony soothed, his posture still relaxed and eyes sparkling happily. "Last time, Rhodey called alarm, it turned out Riri and Harley secretly planned to turn Chevrolet Camaro into a transformer. Rhodey found blueprints and all, and they even started to modify the car. Maybe this time they succeeded and I really want to see that - to discipline them," he corrected himself.
“I think both will look great on you,” Steve said, and Tony almost whooped in excitement, pleased that Steve walked into such an obvious trap, “but you usually wear sparkling materials, so it is better to go with a matte finish, to not overpower the dress. And the rose color will go better with your skin tone, than the cherry one.”
“Yeah,” Tony said to himself, but mock saluted Coulson on his way out, making the agent’s steps lighter.
"Hmph," Tony crossed his arms, thinking that, yeah, maybe, he took it a bit too far. The scrunchie love would end one day, hopefully, and then he would get his cat back from under the vixen's spell. And there was no need to take it out on his fluffy son, not when Figaro was so overjoyed. Before Tony could join in the scrunchie search, there was a movement behind his back and suddenly the floor was further away and the ceiling was a lot closer.
"Heeey, shhhhh, come to daddy," Steve rushed forward, taking the boy from Tony and bouncing in his arms. Fed, diaper clean. Steve checked for fever, but except the heated cheeks from crying, their baby looked perfectly healthy. Peter sniffled some more, wailing in Steve's arms for a change, clearly unhappy. "Maybe he's sleepy," Steve said, feeling that his mind was slowing down because of the late hour.
Everyone turned to her, waiting for the moment of truth. Red looked down, thinking about the last months with Steve. Steve was kind and honest and sweet. He had some hidden heat in himself and a lot of passion. But most importantly, he seemed to love both sides of him, equally fascinated by Red Velvet as by Tony Stark. Tony felt safe and loved and pampered, but Steve also wasn't afraid to give him a piece of his mind when needed. It was very rare to find a person like that.
Tony narrowed his eyes a bit and Steve tried to not crumble under the look. That was a ballsy move on his part. But wasn’t everything he did today out of his comfort zone?
Steve and Tony continue to happily date and Steve has a sweet surprise for Tony, while Tony asks him a big question. Also, Steve meets another drag queen from The Pitted Olive.
“Mhm. I guess that’s why,” Tony chuckled and fluttered his eyes in delight when the kiss ended. Steve only smiled cheekily, proving his point.
"Full body," Red repeated with a wide smile. This time, Steve felt that his blush went all the way down to his toes. Full body was a whole lot of smooth skin.
Steve just smiled gently, knowing all the words he wanted to say and guided by all the feelings he had felt since he saw Red Velvet for the first time and since his first non-date with Tony. Tony was someone truly special, changing his life and making it better, just by his presence. He helped find Steve the courage in places he didn't expect to ever be courageous, was understanding and kind, and just seemed to make Steve's world a brighter place. And when someone finds something so special, they should never let go of it.
Before Steve had a chance to say goodbye, he was dragged into Red Velvet’s changing room.  He was still processing what he heard and just had to ask.
"Aw, don't be like that," Steve cooed, not liking Tony being mean for such a petty reason. "Here, Fig," he said and stood up, walking behind the couch, keen on helping their cat, Figaro following.
"What do you want me to do?!" Steve called back, hoping that his voice was steady and not giving away how much he was enjoying the situation.
God. People were staring at him. Just move along, nothing was happening here. Steve was just sitting outside Tony's changing room and curling in embarrassment. Perfectly normal.
“Good,” the guy smiled. “Let’s start this again. I am Tony Stark,” he said, extending his hand to Steve and Steve shook it. Softest hands ever. “But I would prefer if you didn’t mention my name.”
"Right," Steve sighed. Sleeping on the couch was not an option, but maybe they could use one of the guest floors in the Tower. Still, the mood was gone. Seemed that it wasn't a day for romance after all. Tony didn't like Steve blaming himself over something so silly and decided to fix the mood.
"Oh, thank you. You can call me Sarah by the way," Sarah said, smiling and addressing both Rhodey and Mint. "So, from where do you know Tony?" she asked, genuinely curious.
"That's sweet of you. Are you ready for dessert? Made your favorite," Sarah smiled, standing up and heading to the counter.
"Oh, hi!" Tony, flat on his stomach and on the top of the covers, wearing nothing except his short, silk robe, lay in the middle of the bed, swinging feet in the air, his phone pressed to his ear. He turned to Steve briefly, smiling sweetly. "Yeah, my fiancé just walked in," he said, addressing the person on the other side of the line, "yhm. Latrice says hi!"
Red's blinked in shock, her big blue eyes framed in thick fake lashes and black eyeliner appearing even bigger before she smiled warmly at her boyfriend. "You look very handsome today," she said, approving the look, "is there some special occasion?" came a question and there was some flirting hint underneath.
"Stone is cruel and manipulative and influential," Tony continued his story in an emotionless voice. "I didn't want to drag anyone else into this. And now," Tony raised his head, locking his eyes with Steve's, "he might go after you."
"Stevie!" Sarah brightened as soon as Steve walked into his childhood home. She went to greet her son, her voice becoming stern suddenly. "Did you wipe your shoes on the doormat?"
“Light the candles, okay?” he turned to Steve and Steve nodded, while Tony walked away to discard the withered flowers in the nearest trash can. Steve took out the two candles from the plastic bag and cautiously lit them, putting them down on the sides and under the names. When Tony came back, he smiled at Steve and hooked their arms together and they stood like that for a while, together and in silence in front of his parents grave.
"He is," Tony confirmed, finishing the pop tart and putting his empty mug aside, "but not for your lame bro time, but for my fabulous girls time."
The rest of the sentence. Tony’s lips quirked into a smile because of course, Steve was always loving. And Tony should be equally loving in return.
"I already put an order for your drink, because opposite to you, I am a good, loyal friend," Tootsie summed up their conversation.
Tony smiled, putting his fingers into the container and getting some gray goop out. He rubbed it between his palms and carefully applied to Steve’s whole face.
Fueled on pizza Tony kept working until evening and it was then when he finally saw Steve. Back on their floor, his soldier still engrossed in some paperwork which Tony interrupted by dumping the pizza box in the middle of the documents.
"Because you didn't allow him to invite more friends," Steve reminded, remembering Peter's offended outburst when Tony had stomped his foot and didn't agree to a wild Halloween party filled with teenage hormones under his roof.
Steve’s phone beeped and he left the room, glancing at his mobile and seeing a text message from Sam.
“That was the best,” Steve smiled happily, turning on his side to look better at his boyfriend’s face. “I always think that I know how ticklish your belly button is, but then I am being reminded and it is always a surprise,” Steve teased, wriggling his finger in Tony’s direction and trying to aim at his belly.
Steve laughed. He would love to spend the rest of the day with Tony, but he understood that as a co-owner of the company, Tony had to be flexible. "Okay. Will I see you later today?"
Tony grimaced, needing to come clean about one more thing. “And what if I told you, that I ordered a cleaning company just to make my apartment presentable for you?”
"Kamala!" a dark-haired teenager with a hair neat stretched over his head popped out from the backspace. "Did you finish putting together the boxes?"
Red Velvet frowned, and it was her gentle frown, the one that was practiced to not crease her face too much. "You know that I don't eat before performing."
Steve sat heavily on the couch, putting elbows on his knees and palms around his cheeks, definitely not pouting. Why on Earth did he need a Twitter account? Wasn’t it enough that from time to time he appeared on Tony’s account, being the supportive boyfriend, and allowing Tony share the photos of their date nights or even the short movies from Steve’s training when Tony was proudly showing off Steve’s impressive physique and using those damn filters and making small stars and glitter swirl around him.
Tony groaned, scooting away from the finger, pushing himself further with one hand, the other one pressed protectively on his belly. “You’re mean!” he complained, voice shaking with giggles.
“No,” she gave a solid answer. “My beard is sacred,” she said, turning back to the mirror and turning the shaver on. Steve chuckled quietly, going back to the sofa and watching the transformation happen.
Steve’s smile dimmed a little. Last days were buzzing with information and he felt closer to Tony and more in love with him, but it was all slowly taking its toll on him and draining his energy. He needed some more time to process and regenerate.
Tony’s mouth twisted into a scowl. He was disappointed with himself too, but it was hard. Harder than admitting that he liked being pinned down by Steve, or spanked, as it all seemed… simpler. It was obvious why people who enjoyed it were turned on by it. Tickling wasn’t easy to explain.
Bucky opened his mouth to snark back, but zipped it, looking at all the freshly baked bread and rolls. Well, he would be a fool to get himself kicked out from bread heaven...
Tony turned to him, Bucky's too big shirt hanging on him. His face was cleaned with soap and water, but there was some redness left in his eyes, Tony could blame on the suds getting into his eyes, but Steve knew better. Tony shrugged, looking away. "For long."
Steve wanted to do something soothing, tell his boyfriend that it would be fine, and there was nothing to worry about. Just the floating mass of black hair was so unsettling and Steve couldn't take his eyes off of it.
Tony started to shiver, his blood turning cold. He can't. And he never asked Steve for help. Steve got himself into this mess and he needed to find a solution on his own too. It had nothing to do with Tony. It wasn't Tony's concern. He won't go. He wrestled his arm out of Bucky's hold and started to run.
"I don't know. Maybe next time... you can try to be less loud?" Steve said carefully, mentally preparing himself for a hurt outburst of emotions, and being surprised when none came. Instead, Tony huffed out a laugh and lifted himself from the covers.
The laughter was gone when they noticed the two people standing behind Peter. Ned looked absolutely mortified, and MJ curled in herself, just to hold her laughter in better.
"Hey, baby, hold still," Tony whispered, placing a hand under Steve's chin and turning his face to his. Steve saw tweezers getting closer and his skin immediately started to crawl.
"Steve asked me to come. He said he has something important to tell me - oh," she gasped, suddenly realizing where she was. "Oh, is this where Tony works?"
“Yeah,” Steve said, and they turned around and walked away, holding hands, the bond between them growing stronger and stronger.
"Hmm, somewhere here," Tony smiled charmingly, pointing with a finger to his neck. Steve leaned down eagerly, ready to suckle and kiss the offered skin, when the irritating feeling came back and he straightened up abruptly, sneezing again.
There was no answer, but a surprised scream of pain. Stone whipped around and was shocked himself when a fist collided with his face and the pain and impact made him stagger.
"I decided that we didn't have enough of romance in the past Valentine's days and decided to make up for it," Tony said, sashaying over to Steve, his hips doing some magic movements. To cut the sugar down, Tony chose to wear a simple, black suit, that made him stand out nicely.
"Nachos do sound better than hot dogs," Tony said, narrowing his eyes at Steve, and Steve mirrored the look in reprimand. Nachos were no food for a basketball game.
"Ow," Tony whined miserably, rubbing his forehead, trying to soothe the pain. December was a weird month. It could be the greatest when one was a kid, looking forward to the Holiday days, but became one of the most stressful times in adult life, when the Holidays coupled with the year ending and finishing all business work. Tucked in the corner of his lab, was a Christmas tree, real and smelling of a forest. It was in its most natural state for now as he still didn't find the time to decorate it with silver and blue ornaments, and as much as he loved Dummy, he didn't trust him with this task, his special bot setting on fire things just by standing next to them. That was some rare talent, Tony didn't figure out yet.
After a while, Steve pulled his pants up and flushed the water, feeling better. He took the coffee-scented soap and washed his hands, noticing in the mirror, that Tony stopped paying attention to him and was elbows deep in the water, washing the long strands gently, trying not to tangle them.
"What - whyyy," Tony didn't understand, tears building up back in his eyes. "Hey, hey, look, there is still food," he tried to put the teat back into the boy's mouth, but Peter just looked more distressed and kept arching away.
Coming out was never easy and everyone felt ready in different stages of their lives. Tony knew young people, sure of themselves and who they were even before puberty had started, he knew people in their late seventies, allowing themselves to be who they were just now, after years spent on lying to themselves. And maybe Steve wasn’t ready yet. Kissing in public wasn’t the same as telling your loved ones the deeply hidden truth. And Tony felt so guilty, scolding himself for ever allowing Sarah to get close to him, beating himself up for the day, when he had heard someone calling his name on the street and saw Steve’s mom. He could have pretended he didn’t hear her. He could have turned away and mingled in the crowd on the busy street, disappearing from her sight. Instead, he had smiled and walked to Sarah, starting a conversation, that lead to phone numbers exchange and semi-regular contact. But most importantly, he could have told Steve. Steve, who had became paralyzed this one time his mom saw them together, Steve, who had got his tongue twisted out of fear of his mom connecting the dots. Steve, who he loved so much and never wanted to hurt him. Yet, here he was, standing in front of his bedroom, holding a jug and a mug, afraid to take the final step and see the mess he had made out of Steve’s life.
Steve's hands were shaking and he spilled water all over the counter and watched it drip down to the floor. One deep breath later, he steadied his hands and tried again, this time a nice amount of water from the kettle landing in the bottle. A scoop of powder then shake vigorously. But first, close the bottle with a cap. That was very important, as he once had made that mistake and shook the bottle without closing it. Shake, shake, shake and mix, mix, mix.
The girl eyed Steve, nicely contoured lips curling into a smile. “Oh, honey, she is here. She is just getting ready for the show.”
Steve shrugged, understanding that what he wrote, did sound menacing, even if it wasn’t his intention. “Just write that we are fine and your boyfriend plans on fulfilling your each and every one tickle fantasy.”
Steve nodded, silently chewing on the piece of meat. Since his dad died, years ago, he saw his mom closing in, struggling to find a place for herself. If a bit of makeup was what she needed to feel better, Steve supported that wholeheartedly.
"Get him good, honey!" Tony cheered, and turned to amused Ned and MJ, "so, anyone in the mood for pizza? Maybe we can watch some family videos if you are in the mood, Peter was the cutest chubby baby."
"I don't know," Steve said mysteriously, "but you look nice. Is there a reason you got all dolled up?" he asked playfully.
"Fine," Steve agreed, taking his boyfriend's jacket and offering it to him. "If that is another beauty kind of talk, I have plenty of that back home."
It was petty, Tony knew it was and that it won't change anything. "Fuck you," he ground out, his voice breaking with a sob, but eyes giving away his true feelings. There was so much anger in the brown eyes, a blazing flame, mixing with contempt, showing in the way Tony’s mouth twisted. Maybe once, there was something good between him and Stone, but it was all fake. Just a sugar coating, hiding what a rotten person Stone really was.
It didn’t take long until Steve was satisfied with his job and threw the smudged covers away, getting off the layers of foundation, blushes, and highlighters. What was left, was Tony’s skin, natural and tanned and soft, showing some laugh lines and shadows under his eyes. The whole carefully planned look was gone and yet…
"Aw, babe," Steve cooed, looking at the contents of the tray and letting out a short, loud laugh. Freshly squeezed orange juice in a tall glass, a bright sunflower for decoration and a stack of steaming, fluffy pancakes, decorated with whipped cream and red, white and blue sprinkles, and fresh berries and a small American flag stuck on top. A truly patriotic breakfast on the 4th of July.  That explained the burnt smell from earlier and why Friday tried to keep him in bed. All to not spoil Tony's surprise.
“I am sorry for barging into your space when you didn’t feel ready to share yet,” Steve said, closing the distance between them and leaning his forehead against Tony’s.
"It is Buck!" Steve called, motioning for Bucky to come in and taking steps back, the clicking sound drawing Bucky's attention to his feet.
Steve, completely awake and grinning joyfully because of Tony’s squeaky laughter, took the said words very seriously. “My mouth? This mouth?” He asked just to be sure and pushed Tony on his back. Before Tony could react, his shirt was rolled up and Steve’s lips pressed to his quivering belly, gnawing at the soft skin.
It all started with a certain PR meeting held for the Avengers team, just this time, it was Steve vs the whole PR team. The problem was simple - Steve didn’t like social media and didn’t have an account on any of the numerous websites and apps. Fighting with aliens, planning new missions, schooling SHIELD agents - those were the zones he felt comfortable in. Some thought that the hidden reason behind the hostility towards social media was, that Steve, born in the 1920s, had a problem with using modern technology. Some called it endearing, some pathetic, the truth was, that Steve fairly quickly mastered each piece of technology he was given, skillfully using any given device. After all, he wasn’t dense. Many apps were quite useful, some just plain entertaining, and it required a lot of navigating, but he managed to find some favorites. Just when it came to social media… Steve didn’t feel like sharing his private life with unknown faces. Call him old-fashioned, but he liked having direct contact with people and as much as he liked to take a stop during his random walks in the city to talk with people who called themselves his fans, it quickly became too overwhelming. He wasn’t good at such things and always thought he was too awkward and not what people expected. Steve didn’t like that kind of pressure and didn’t like the almost weekly notices from the PR team that he needed to make himself more ‘accessible’. By no means, he was expected to stop and talk to everyone who ever called him or share mission details with strangers, but he needed to create a more public persona for Captain America and Steve Rogers.
“I don’t go in drag during the daytime,” Tony continued, and Steve noticed he lowered his voice a bit, “I don’t think I am ready for that yet.”
"Yeah, he went to the bathroom and to get us some snacks. This is basically the only reason I come here, to get nachos," she said with a disarming smile.
"Thank you," Steve smiled at the new girl as she put his drink on the table, and she smiled back at him, and Steve almost slid down from his seat in shock. He would recognize that teeth gap anywhere. "Oh my God, Sam?!" he shrilled out, trying to keep his voice low.
When Tony had called Steve to the living room, saying that he has a surprise, Steve expected everything, but not this. And here they where, Tony presenting proudly on himself a whole line of clothes, including a racer jacket, t-shirt, cap, and sweatpants, all embellished with a pointy print, the same one that was used on all of their Avenger's equipment, spelling '
“Hi,” the guy smiled at Steve, “you have guests today?” he asked, turning back to Red Velvet, or Red as she was called.
"You have a daughter?!" Steve asked, his eyes wide as saucers. Wasn't that kind of an information he should know from the start?
Steve scrolled down this page, seeing more text and images of people being tickled, some like, a gif that was of a zoomed in stomach, the belly button tickled by a tip of the feather, signed with a ’
“Are you sure you don’t want to eat anything?” the blond waitress, Beth, asked looking at the man with some kind of worry.
Steve blinked, seeing Tootsie, standing in front of his usual table in the Olive, full lips turned down in an upside-down u shape, eyes, framed with thick eyelashes and black eyeliner, shooting daggers at him. She wore her usual grungy style of clothing, torn flannel and tights, chunky earrings that were painful to even look at, and shorts so tiny and revealing as if Bucky wanted to make a statement that he was able to tuck perfectly, despite the origin of his drag name.
"But you know, that Wakanda is on the other side of the globe?" Wanda taunted, but she was ignored and had to squeeze closer to Tony, when Pietro and Steve stood up, high fiving each other, forming some sort of magical bond over sports.
"Friday, dim the lights, cue some music," he said, and when the first notes of a soothing melody started to seep in, the lights got softer, Tony stood up and spoke again, offering Steve a hand. "May I have this dance?"
“You wear a jacket,” Steve smiled back, walking into the bathroom. It didn’t make sense and was all playful and Steve felt light as air.
“You know since we are both awake already…” Steve hummed, rubbing their noses together. Tony didn’t need to hear it twice and wrapped arms around Steve’s neck, holding him in place and pushing his hips up to match Steve’s.
Steve opened his mouth to say something back when while during wrestling with Tony something caught his attention. He looked at his own hands and let go of Tony for closer inspection, brunet immediately taking the opportunity to launch another attack of the tweezers and Steve temporarily knocked him to the side, hearing a yelp of protest. He rolled on his stomach for further protection and examined his hands closer. The nails, usually clipped pretty short for comfort, were filed into a perfect oval shape, cuticles were pushed back and there was a light coat of sheen nail polish on each nail. His hands also felt a lot smoother, with no rough edges, just as if someone massaged a heck lot of hand cream into the skin.
"You expect me to get full on hotdogs?" Tony asked, eyeing the food with a grimace. "You don't even know what they are made from!"
“Damn straight, I am straight,” Sam remarked in a low grumble, his eyes going to the bar area where Arrow was leaning and placing an order. “Straight as an uncooked spaghetti noodle…” he said, his voice losing its anger and getting a softer note that sounded a lot like longing when he watched a person behind the bar. Big, frilly dark hair, dark eye makeup, pink lips. She laughed hearing the order and started to prepare the drink for Steve first, moving smoothly and gracefully, the bright pink fur bolero and giant silver hoops in her ears, not constricting her movements in the slightest. Underneath the fur was a silver top with leopard print on spaghetti straps and knowing her, she had to wear small shorts and boots going way past her knees. Sam couldn’t help but stare.
"Okay,” Tony nodded, trying to give himself some courage and began to pace around the room. “I know you found my Tumblr account,” he said the obvious, struggling to keep his voice firm. “And - and it was not true, you know that, right? I just - research - an experiment to - ahh,” Tony quickly got lost in his words, noticing Steve’s look changing to a confused one. “I - ah, fuck, fuck, fuck - ” Tony couldn’t get any coherent words out and stopped and hid his face in hands. He continued to quietly curse, not knowing how to get out of this mess and not lose everything.
That was a reasonable explanation. Steve nodded, knowing that there was more to his friend than just the outer layer, of a seemingly tough guy who grew up in a problematic neighborhood. Sam loved to bake good, honest bread but also had a knack for decorating cupcakes and cookies making them look like something from a fairy tale land. It was a good name for him.
“Your lady?” Red Velvet repeated with a twitching smile. “So you want me to wear a dress to our first date?”
“Well, back in my days, if you kissed and slept with someone on a regular and exclusive basis, it made you date them.”
"You will see later. Just don't get too full on anything," Steve enticed, hoping that a little bit of mystery would motivate his boyfriend to come home sooner.
"Steve!" Tony busted out of the building, running into the street and looking around the sidewalk, searching and hoping. He saw Steve where he said he was, just on the other side of the street. No wonder Tony didn't spot him at first. Tony crossed the street and stopped in front of his boyfriend and the sight was breaking his heart. Who knew for how long Steve had been standing like that. His cheeks were flushed from cold, eyes glossy and tired, and he still kept his phone pressed to his ear, listening to the silence.
"Hmmm. I am very convincing," Tony hummed from behind Steve, clad in his obscenely short bathrobe and only that. Oh, how Steve loved that bathrobe.
He wasn’t only a stunningly attractive female, but a crazy handsome male. Steve couldn’t wrap his head around that.
“Hi,” Tony said back, waiting for something to happen. When it didn’t, he moved in closer, putting his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, soldier’s hands wrapping over his back. They both took a deep, calming breath, the sleepy atmosphere coming back. This was good. Yet some thought didn’t want to leave Tony’s mind and he had to do something about…
’, whatever that meant. Steve tried to search for the text he saw on the previous page, but couldn’t find it anymore, instead saw more posts, where people seemed to be interacting with the author.
It was a regular bar, with a regular bouncer standing outside, big, buffed and seemingly bored, and regular customers. From the outside, it didn’t seem like anything special. A big sign with a neon and the name of the bar in a simple font embellished with a martini glass and an olive on a toothpick, flashing with purple, green and red did attract attention but wasn’t anything special enough to attract the looking for adventures New Yorkers. Inside was inviting and warm, with round mahogany tables and comfortable chairs and a small lamp in the middle of every table. There were a bar and a stage with silver, glittery curtains, promising entertainment and a good time. It was a bar like many in New York. But late evenings, magic happened inside.
"Oh, come on," Tony kept laughing and even if it was at his expanse, Steve was happy. It was a good sound to hear. "Loki wouldn't hurt you."
"See?" Tony smiled wider, pointing at his face, and spreading his fingers. "Flawless," he said, making a clicking sound with his tongue.
’ Steve took a screenshot of it and kept saved on his phone, knowing that the friendship between him and Sam would last forever. Until another evening when instead of their regular bar, Steve had proposed the Pitted Olive and all doubts came back again. And Sam once again has proven himself as his best friend, giving the drag queen bar a chance. Steve was forever grateful for his friend being so open-minded.
"Ow, Pietro!" Wanda hissed, when her brother tumbled down on the seat next to her, holding a tray with nachos on and some licorice. "How did you get here so fast? Weren't there any lines?"
“Fish,” Tony confirmed with a grin. “It means that I try to look as much as I can as an authentic woman,” Steve nodded, experiencing that first-hand, “it is kinda weird, seeing that my mother was a camp queen.”
“What’s that?” Steve asked, eyeing suspiciously a table with a tub filled with ice with different colored goops in huge containers placed on top.
Steve's tensed shoulders jumped when Friday addressed him. Oh right. He was living in a highly technological building, if there would be a fire, Friday was the first to know and could activate the complicated line of sprinklers. False alarm.
Steve huffed in laughter. "Thanks, Buck," Steve said, the name coming out almost inaudible and more like a sigh to a nonskilled ear, but the lip movement was enough for Tootsie to decode the word. A little placated, she walked away, having to prepare for tonight's show.
Sarah seemed surprised, but smiled in the end, accepting the invitation. "I will just get us something to drink," she said, and Steve huffed a bit, wishing for his mom to finally sit down with him and rest. He kept his eyes fixed on his mom as she brewed tea for herself and poured a tall glass of lemonade for him, and Steve saw that there was something different about his mom, but he couldn't exactly point what. Chewing slowly on his food and savoring the taste, Steve kept thinking about what could have changed. His mom was always a beautiful woman, but she valued hard work over looks and as a nurse spent most of her days caring for others than for herself. Hair always tied in a low ponytail, almost no makeup, maybe for some people it was bland and boring, for Steve it was modest and natural. And now… Sarah's complexion seemed glowing, her pale skin having a healthy shine, hair seeming somehow thicker and brighter. When Sarah finally sat down across her son and smiled at him, Steve noticed that she was wearing mascara and had subtly contoured eyebrows, which gave definition to her whole face.
“Okay,” he heard a chair being pushed to the back on the soft carpet and saw Red Velvet sitting in front of the vanity station. “Now to show you how the magic happens! Yet first, I have to introduce you to the least attractive part of drag,” she said, opening the drawer on her left.
He’s too lost in his thoughts that he almost misses what Tony says to him. “Oh, I’ve talked to Aunt Peggy by the way. Seems like you took my advice and had a good long life.”
Not that Tony was going to complain. He wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, the full skin-to-skin contact driving him crazy. Hand still in Steve’s hair, Tony pulled him in for an absolutely filthy kiss, to which Tony could feel Steve’s hands on him grip much harder.
“What about me?” Steve ask, pulling his fingers all the way out before shoving them back in, laughing breathlessly at Tony’s moan.
Each thrust is agonizingly slow, leaving Tony breathless at the feeling of Steve’s thick cock moving in and out of him. Steve goes harder and deeper, and Tony’s moans let him know when he hits that sweet spot. He changes his angle, and now with every push back in, he soaks up the delicious sounds that escape Tony’s lips.
He’s not sure what time it is, but the palace is silent, the only sound coming from his own shoes on the tiles. He’s not sure if it’s supposed to be this quiet, or it’s because half the population have been wiped out.
Not about deep or emotional stuff - they both know it’s not the right place or time for it yet - but they talk. About the team. About what’s happened the last two years. Tony even mentions Peter, and as painful as it, remembering that kid’s enthusiasm and passion drives Tony’s determination to get him back even further.
With his neck curved, exposed and bare, it must have awakened something in Steve, because the next thing Tony knew, Steve had released his strong grip on Tony’s thigh and bent forward, pressing his nose into the hollow of his neck and just
As the sun continues to rise, Tony hears footsteps behind him. He doesn’t need to turn around to know who it is.
Steve’s face was flushed red, self-conscious about all the sudden attention. Tony, on the other hand, stood up. “If you all must know, Steve and I have been together for almost a month now. We reconciled our differences during the fundraiser.”
Steve has said it several times before, and Tony himself has said it back, but this time is different. It’s been two years, and for Steve to say it after everything that’s happened, after everything they’ve just been through… Tony has no idea what to feel.
“I know, but why do you have it on me?” Steve asked with a smirk. “It’s not my month yet. It’s Thor’s.”
"Don't laugh," Steve said, feigning a pout which only sent Tony into a greater giggling fit. "The steaks ran out pretty quick."
Rogers. He looked good tonight (not that he ever not looked good), with his tight button up shirt, his blond hair combed perfectly. Tony would have kept on staring if he hadn’t noticed Steve staring right back at him.
Tony’s hips jerk upwards, causing both men to break the kiss at the friction. Taking it as a sign things to move on, Steve reaches for the lube, coating his finger with a generous amount. He teases, rubbing two fingers around Tony’s hole before pushing them in, all the way to the second knuckle.
Tony pats his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t cry on me now, Cap. This was supposed to be a happy reunion.”
The long moan that Tony lets out is encouragement enough, and Steve keeps going, taking his time to open Tony up, brushing his prostate every now and then. God, the sounds that Tony makes. Steve doesn’t know how he’s survived two years without this man.
But none of that mattered right now, as all Tony could think about was the friction of the bed sheets against his erection, and the sheer heat of Steve’s large hands on his hips, lips slowly pressing kisses down his spine. However, as Steve moved lower, a sudden thought came to Tony’s mind.
He can’t read Steve’s expression, but when those blue eyes stare at him, he feels those things again, only stronger.
With Steve's cock in him, combined with his cum, Tony felt blissfully full. But it wasn't enough. He needed more. Thankfully, Steve started moving, his thrusts slow and deep, the urgency from earlier gone, replaced with a desire to milk the experience for all it was worth. With every thrust came a squelching sound, one that only sounded louder with Tony's enhanced hearing, a sound that should have been off-putting but only acted as a reminder of how Steve had marked him from the inside as well.
Steve’s heart skips a beat at that, a little seed of hope starting to grow. Any animosity they had seems to be gone in this new place, and he begins to see the chance to fix things that Peggy mentioned.
Tony reaches down, holding both of their hardening dicks in one hand. He starts stroking them together, and Steve almost curses at the sudden contact. Resting his forehead against Tony, he loses himself in the smooth glide between skin, grunting when Tony moves a thumb over the head of his leaking cock.
, a go. And if you’re willing, I would like to really get to know you. Not that I haven’t already, but it’s different now that we can talk face-to-face.” A pause, then, “But if you’re not, then I’ll be fine with it too. If I must go back, at least I can take with me the memory and experience of having met you.”
Steve said nothing in response, only smiling into Tony’s hair and pulling him closer. Tony huffed, but burrowed into the warmth.
Steve nodded in response. Slowly, inch by inch, he pushed himself into Tony until his hips met the back of Tony's thighs.
Tony recognised that tone. Whenever Steve used that tone, he was going to go on a long speech, lecturing Tony and trying to convince him to not do whatever it was that he was about to do. Tony always listened and nodded along, but not this time.
A few minutes later, when Tony finally recovered enough to walk back out, he spotted Steve back at his post, painting the faces of the children with a forced smile.
Every year, the fire department would release a calendar that they would sell to raise money for charity. It was immensely popular, especially since all the photos were of the firemen, shirtless and holding cute little baby animals. Sure, Tony and the others made fun of them the first year, but after seeing how much money was donated, the entire police department considered doing their own.
Five days later, and Steve still hadn’t contacted him. He wasn’t answering calls or texts either, which was strange considering that Steve always responded immediately. That worried Tony, eventually deciding to go to his apartment.
He doesn’t say anything in response. Not that Steve expected otherwise. He knows why it’s difficult for him to say it back, especially after everything that’s happened. It’s enough that he’s said it, and that Tony hears it.
“I got this for you,” Steve says, passing him a sandwich. “I wasn’t sure if you were hungry, but I was getting one for myself and I thought you might want one.”
Steve broke the kiss suddenly, pulling away, and Tony very nearly whimpered at the loss. Steve slowly pulled out until only the head of his cock remained inside. The demon winced at the oversensitivity as his legs were lifted, coming to rest on Steve’s broad shoulders. With his large hands on Tony thighs, Steve drove himself into Tony, a hard, sharp thrust that made the demon throw his head back.
From some corner of the room, music starts playing, and Steve looks over at Peggy, wondering if he should ask her for a dance.
He finally turned back to Steve and saw the worry that had taken over his face, clearly a result of the long wait. A small smile reached Tony’s face. “You’re crazy,” he scoffed. “This could all end horribly, you know that? And if it does, it could start a war.”
As he calmed down, Tony became aware of Steve's hands, one under his own, the other on his thigh, trembling with intense, barely held back desire. It hit Tony then, how much Steve was holding back, how much willpower he was using to not give in to that carnal desire, to make sure that Tony was comfortable before doing anything and that he would enjoy it too. This realisation, more than anything, cleared his head.
“Unfortunately, no. I’m here to help someone buy a drink for someone else. Although, if you wanted me to get you a drink, I definitely wouldn’t mind,” Steve said, flirting right back.
Seeing Tony like this, seeing him so broken, Steve just wants to hold him until all the broken pieces are forced back together again. But he knows Tony hates that, to be treated like a fragile toy, to be pitied. So as much as Tony may need it, Steve waits, letting him make the first move.
“I told you, I was scared!” The look of defeat on Steve’ face made his heart ache. “And even if I wasn’t, how the hell was I going to tell you? How was I supposed to tell you, a vampire of all things, that I wanted you to be mate? I couldn’t do that to you!”
Standing there, Steve can only smile at how well Peggy truly knows him, at how lucky he is to have her in his life.
Tony keened at the sudden fullness, a mixture of emotions flooding him. Hunger, relief, desperation, embarrassment, and at the back of his mind, curiosity. He still couldn’t figure out what supernatural creature Steve was, not to mention one that would find him beautiful.
“Me too.” Clint called out as he caught up with Rhodey. “Any more of this cheesy romantic shit and I’m gonna puke.”
Getting back to the table, Tony placed the beer in front of Bruce. “One large beer for you, courtesy of the Viking from the fire department.”
Bruce laughed at how oblivious his friend was. “Everybody else knew it was him the second we saw the flowers. Only he would be that big of sap to do something like this.”
Steve said that he wouldn’t get it because he was a vampire, which was fine by Tony. He didn’t need a mate; all he needed was fresh blood every few days and he was good to go.
Steve’s hands moved to grip Tony’s ass, kneading the muscles and exposing him. Just as Tony was about to call out Steve’s name, he felt the other man’s breath against his hole, the name leaving Tony’s mouth in a choked gasp as Steve’s warm tongue pressed against his tight entrance.
And for some reason, once he was done, they brought him to this meeting, where they’re discussing plans on what to do now, on how to get the others back.
“Hey, I didn’t promise you that.” But Tony was weak to Steve’s puppy dog eyes. It didn’t take much for him to give in. “
Ignoring the fact that he was slightly turned on, Tony inwardly sighed at how insatiable his mate was. Still, he couldn’t blame him; Steve probably wanted to make up for all the lost years. Tony did too, but they had the rest of eternity to do so. They had time. So instead, he smacked Steve playfully on the chest. “How are you still so horny? Aren’t you starving?”
Hearing those words brings Tony back to last night again. He remembers saying those words. He remembers the kiss after, the words that were said after.
Steve let go, and the pleasure slowly gave way to care and concern. "Are you okay? How do you feel?"
Tony pushed himself up, looking around. The room had been cleaned up; the bed fitted with new sheets.
Steve’s only ever seen this vulnerable side of Tony, this part of him that he never reveals to anyone else, when they’re alone. Steve was the only one Tony could trust with all of that, and he betrayed him. And now, for two years, he’s suppressed it so much that when they’re finally reunited, it threatens to spill over in a huge mess of emotions.
The man closed his mouth, the corners upturned. “Didn’t think you noticed.” His voice was thick and rich, much like the whiskey Tony was drinking. He stuck his hand out. “The name’s Steve.”
Steve’s fingers, long and thick, were brushing past his prostate, leaving Tony fidgeting and shuddering. “Come on, Steve. Stop with the teasing already,” he whined, squeezing one of Steve’s biceps.
With no hesitation, Steve grabs Tony hand. Following behind, he listens to Tony as he talks about all the food and activities they have in this place, about how Tony is going to bring him around to try everything.
As they move people into the palace, her bracelet lights up. At the press of a button, a voice comes through. “General, an unidentified aircraft has just entered Wakandan airspace.”
“And Captain Rogers.” Tony releases the breath he didn’t know he was holding. “They are in Wakanda, Sir. They were protecting the stone.”
“Shut up.” Tony didn’t know what was happening to him. He was a centuries old demon, for fuck’s sake. Why the hell was he acting like a smitten teenager over some random – but very attractive – stranger, he had no idea.
“You know me so well,” Tony said dryly, turning to Steve, who was walking over with two beers in hand.
It took a while for both of them to get back to their senses, panting hard as they came down from their high. When they finally looked at each other, they couldn’t help but smile and laugh a little at how dishevelled the other was.
“No.” He shakes his head. “You’re lying.” But Steve hears it in his voice. He already knows it’s the truth.
Steve laughs, and Tony melts a little on the inside at how it sounds, how good it feels to hear something so pure and genuine after everything. The blond presses a kiss to the spot in between Tony’s eyebrows, and smiling brightly, says, “Anything you want, Tony.”
Reaching up, Tony carded his hand through Steve's hair, pulling him down into a sloppy kiss. When Steve broke away, Tony, breath hot against Steve's lips, said, "
With every thrust, Steve seemed to get impossibly deeper, reaching parts that Tony had never managed to reach by himself. As Steve starting hitting against his prostate, Tony could only wonder why he and Steve hadn’t done this earlier, why he waited so many years to ask Steve to fuck him.
Tony’s eyes are wide open, surprised at Steve’s sudden outburst of words and emotion. Still, a smile soon appears on his face. “Aww, you’re making me blush. And really, you don’t have to thank me that much, I just did what I had to do. I’m sure you would have done the same- Whoa!”
Controlling his breathing, Tony gets up and makes his way to the windows, watching as the blue and green planet takes over the view. It looks so peaceful from far away. Not as if half the population had just disappeared.
Steve moved back up Tony’s body, the bed creaking under the shifting weight, the heat now draped over his back. He felt lips pressed to his shoulder blade as Steve worked another finger into him. Steve spread his fingers, slowing opening Tony up, but it wasn’t enough. His fingers were just shy of brushing his prostate, and at this point, Tony was so desperate that he moved his hips backwards, fucking himself on Steve’s fingers, trying to get them deeper into him.
Silence filled the room again as Tony tried to think of a reply. He had never actually given any thought about being a relationship. Being a demon meant that nobody would ever want him, so he had already accepted his fate a long time ago, prepared to face an eternity of singledom with hook-ups and fuck buddies along the way. Now that he had a chance, he didn’t know what to expect, or what would happen.
Right now, Thor was the one being photographed, standing tall and huge in front of one of the fire trucks. On each of his shoulders and in the crook of his arm was a small kitten, with all three and him looking just unbearably adorable.
“Because we’re given strict orders to never show ourselves to the people we look after. Unless there’s a great need for it. Even then there’s this whole application process. There’s even paperwork and everything.” Steve scoffed, a small smile on his face.
Tony raised his hand, calling for another glass. Natasha, the bartender and owner of the bar, slid over another whisky almost immediately with an eyebrow raised. “Bad day?”
Tony wondered, turning to the person in question, but the question never left his mouth as he stared in amazement at how Steve’s hair managed to stay perfectly styled despite the strong breeze and lack of helmet.
He was still so uncertain, so afraid to hurt Tony. Tony reached back for Steve’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “I trust you.”
Tony couldn’t help but get a little loud, tone slightly harsh, but only because he wanted Steve to never doubt their relationship ever again. “I’m not stuck with you; you’re stuck with me, and you better not regret that decision, because no way in hell am I ever letting you go.”
Steve knows that he loves Peggy. He always has, always will, but what he feels for Tony is so intense that he can’t put it to words yet he knows what he feels is real, feelings that have been growing with every word and smile that Tony has directed at him ever since they first met.
It was with those words that Tony finally managed to break through to Steve. The wolf stopped, its nose twitching, head tilted to the side as he stared at Tony.
After a few good minutes, he felt Steve trying to pull his head back. He pulled away, letting Steve’s cock slowly fall out of his mouth, letting go with an obscene pop. He slid his way back up against Steve’s body. “Why, too good for you?” he asked, voice already hoarse and throat already hurting.
“Of course I did. I had to, seeing how I was Steve’s contact,” Bruce sighed as he handed over the money. “Don’t look at me like that. If I didn’t help, would the two of you have ended up together?”
There’s nothing much, just a few potted flowers, a table and a bench but the view is what really gets him to stay. Even in the low light, he can tell that it’s overlooking a good part of the city, maybe even some hills in the distance. He plants himself on the bench, waiting in the chilly morning air.
After three more days, Steve’s rut finally ended. Steve had graciously allowed Tony to shower first, which he had, now standing in the bathroom as Steve took his own shower. Looking into the mirror, Tony scanned his body, only to find all the marks that Steve had disappeared, except for one. The bonding mark was still there, unaffected by his healing factor. He brushed his fingers over it, following the ridges left by Steve’s bite, pressing but feeling no pain.
Seeing how much it has affected their relationship, Steve feels that they need to talk about it. But he knows that’s a conversation for another time. So for now, he says, “Well, at least you had the phone with you. Bruce couldn’t have called otherwise.”
But then he remembers how Steve held him, touched him, kissed him. How he looked at him. Even now, he glances at Steve, sees how his eyes are trained on the view in front of them, notices the pain and grief behind all that bravery and strength.
“We’ve known each other for almost six hundred years, Tony,” Steve said, taking a seat next to him. “Of course I do.”
Steve follows soon afterward, coming with a groan inside Tony. He knows it’ll be a pain to clean up, but he doesn’t care. It’s worth it.
Once again, Tony was amazed at and grateful for how nice Steve was, the angel’s good nature never fading. If it was anybody else, Tony was pretty sure that they wouldn’t have asked and would have just done it anyway. And if it was anybody else, Tony would have said no, because he hated the clean-up afterwards. But this wasn’t anybody else.
He knows he can’t sleep anymore, but before he gets out of bed, he decides to take a moment to look at the blond.
“Have you seen him before?” Tony asked, his eyes tracking the movements of the newcomer as he sat at the other end of the bar. The reply went unheard though, as the man shrugged off his jacket, revealing flexed biceps, straining against the tight sleeves. Tony felt himself physically drooling at the display, staring without a care.
The next thing he got was a box of chocolates, and attached to it was a card that read ‘Like chocolate, you make everything better.’ Tony rolled his eyes at the cheesy pickup line, and after picking a few pieces for himself, he offered the rest to whoever was in the station.
he was looking for. So he held back. He would still hook-up every now and then, if he felt attracted to that person, but after a while, it wasn’t worth it anymore. He focused on his work and he never really thought about it until now.
A swell of emotions run through Steve, bringing back memories of when they were still together. A better time before they fought, before Thanos. A happier time.
It really doesn’t surprise Tony anymore, how Steve knows him better than himself. He doesn’t even know how to respond because it’s the truth. As much as he wants to, he can’t just give up. How can he when he’s partially responsible for half the world turning to dust, when he has the capacity to actually do something about it?
He knows that Tony is close. He feels it. He speeds up, driving into Tony fast and hard. He doesn’t let up until the older man cries out his name, the only warning before he comes.
Tony was getting ever closer; he just needed that bit more to push him over. It was at this point that his inability to form words turned into an inability to control the words coming out of his mouth, his brain-to-mouth filter completely turned off. “Oh my God, Steve, I’m so close - Fuck, you’re so big, I feel so full - We should have done this so much sooner - Only you know how to fuck me so good - Harder, I want to feel it tomorrow.”
A hologram of it appears, and before anyone can say anything, Rocket (Steve learned his name after he was finally tired of Thor calling him Rabbit), jumps in from out of nowhere. “I’d recognize that piece of junk anywhere! That’s Quill’s ship! Let them in!”
The other man knew exactly what to do. “Don’t worry, I’ve got you.” One large hand moved up from his hips to the desk, fingers splayed out to brace himself as he began fucking Tony in earnest.
Ignoring all flight response, he made his way there, finding even more damage along the way. The vampire instincts, the werewolf-fearing part of him that he buried down deep inside after becoming friends with Steve, starting acting up, telling him to get out immediately, but he ignored it. He wasn’t going to leave. Not until he could make sure that Steve was okay, because he wouldn’t forgive himself if something had happened and he didn’t do anything.
Steve can’t stop kissing him. Even if he needs to take a breath he only breaks away for a quick second before returning to Tony’s lips. Even as he lowers Tony onto the bed, careful not to touch his wound, they never move apart, Tony’s hands back in his hair, one of his own running down the side of the man below him, using the other to hold himself above.
He had always liked the place. It was far enough away from the city centre to not be too crowded, but close enough to have a constant stream of people going in and out. When he was younger, he spent most of his nights there, hooking up with whoever and whatever. Humans were always the easiest, Tony using his powers to charm them into sleeping with a demon. Other creatures, not so much. They could always sense his dark aura and give him a wide berth, which was fine by him. Tony would take a regular, old human over a werewolf or a witch any day.
Somehow, Tony managed to maintain enough focus to pull off his own jeans and briefs, even as Steve started nipping the fragile skin along his shoulder. Sure, it would have been hot as fuck to let Steve rip them off as well, but he still would like to have some clothes to go home in after all of this.
It's almost imperceptible, but being so close, Tony saw the change, the way Steve's eyes shifted ever so slightly into his werewolf ones. He was so mesmerized by this change that he barely noticed Steve hooking his hands under his knees, lifting and spreading them into an obscene v. When he finally did, Steve had already pulled back, moving his hands to grip Tony's thighs. And finally,
For the first time, Tony realizes that Steve’s broken and damaged too. Maybe not as badly as Tony, but he’s suffered enough.
“Well, I’m grateful,” Tony says, turning to Steve. “Couldn’t have asked for a better group of weirdos to take care of her. Honestly, I feel safe knowing she has them looking out for her.”
Tony shook his head. Now that it was laid out in front of him, he couldn’t understand how he didn’t realise it earlier.
Steve walks out, and with every step, he feels his heart beat speed up, feels his own breath beginning to catch in his throat. He gets closer and closer, until he is right behind the person, and he calls out.
Looking at Steve, Tony wonders why Fate is so nice to him all of a sudden. After everything that Fate has decided for him so far, why does Fate suddenly decide to let Steve live, to let them reunite, to let them have a chance to reconnect?
Tony watched as he moved back, standing at the foot of the bed once again, only then realising that besides his erect cock, Steve was still fully clothed, while he was completely naked. A flush reached Tony’s face, but the embarrassment soon disappeared when Steve took off his shirt, and Tony nearly drooled. Wide shoulders, muscles everywhere, not a single mark or blemish anywhere. Those gorgeous biceps flexed as Steve bent down to remove his jeans and shoes, and when he straightened back up, Tony could only stare at the man who was built to almost perfection. He was so distracted that he almost didn’t notice the pair of pearl white wings that appeared out of Steve’s back, or the faint ring of light that formed over the crown of Steve’s head.
“Yes, you dumb dog. I’ll be your mate.” Tony rustled Steve’s hair, imagining his big wolf ears perking up.
, Steve thinks, kissing along the edges of the long scar. He can feel Tony watching him. He knows Tony always feel shy and awkward when Steve does this, but he does it anyway, because he wants him to realize that having that scar doesn’t make him anymore or any less flawed.
Tony turns to Nebula, and for the first time since they met, they make eye contact. No words are needed.
Perhaps it's because he had already come before and he was overstimulated. Perhaps it's because of the bond. Perhaps it's another newly discovered kink. Whatever it was, he couldn't care about that right now, not when he was experiencing his second orgasm of the night, which seemed impossibly better than the first.
“I’m pretty sure ten packs of steak can last me three days, Tony,” Steve said, packing said steaks into the fridge.
Next to Bruce is Natasha, arms folded on the table as she listens. It’s not even her new blonde hair that surprises him; it’s the fact that for first time, she looks defeated. In all the time that he’s known her, she has always been confident, unapologetically badass. To see her like this… it scares him.
Tony almost choked at hearing his own words thrown back at him. Hearing those words come out from Steve’s mouth, Tony finally understood what it must have been like for Steve, to have the chance to sleep with the man he liked only to be rejected before he could even say anything, to have the slightest bit of hope that his feelings might be reciprocated only for that hope to be torn to pieces.
This time, Tony’s the one to pull him into a kiss, and Steve can feel all the emotions behind it. He knows that it’s his way of reciprocating and for now, it’s enough.
, Tony tried to convince himself, but those blue eyes looking right at him made it incredibly difficult to turn away.
“To make sure evil doesn’t get out of hand.” Steve said, voice soft. “You couldn’t know either. Hell would literally break loose if demons knew that angels were watching them.”
Perhaps it’s an inappropriate thing to think about at this moment, considering how the others are discussing ways to bring back the dead, but when he looks at Steve, he feels…
Tony glanced past Rhodey to see the members of the fire department on the far side of the bar, making a huge ruckus. Not that they hated each other; the police department and fire department have had a friendly rivalry since forever, especially with their stations being right next to each other. The pub was frequented by both teams, with each often trying to claim it as their own territory. Still, everybody from one side knew everybody else from the other, and they were all close enough to consider themselves friends.
It was a beautiful moment… until Steve's stomach grumbled loudly. Tony tried to ignore it, he really did, but he ended up breaking the kiss, chuckling at the flush on Steve's cheeks.
When he reached the small of his back, Steve’s hands moved to grab Tony’s ass. He kneaded the muscles, spreading them to expose Tony’s hole. Tony flushed, embarrassed at being so exposed, so open and vulnerable, but all that embarrassment flew out the window when Steve licked a broad stripe over his hole.
“I don't,” Steve says in response, leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t try.”
Several endless minutes later, Steve finally removed his fingers. Tony sighed at the emptiness, but also in relief at the knowledge that Steve was finally going to move on. Opening his eyes, Tony watched as Steve opened the bottle of lube, using a decent amount to slick himself up.
Tony gives himself a mental slap. This is not what he should be thinking of right now but seeing as he can trust neither his words nor his thoughts, he decides to use his actions. Shifting a little closer to Steve, he rests his head on the blond’s shoulder.
It’s just a kiss, nothing more, nothing less, but when Tony pulls away, he feels as though there’s a weight on his chest. “I…” he starts, but he finds that he can’t complete the sentence.
Travelling into Wakanda, Tony was so focused on getting here that he didn’t have the energy to appreciate the scenery. Now, he finally sees the country in all its glory. He can’t believe something could be this beautiful, the city bursting into view as the sun continues to rise, to shine its warm light. The hills come to life too, so far away but still so majestic. It all looks so peaceful and serene.
Tony looks into those blue eyes and sees everything. Concern. Understanding. Devotion. Reverence. Warmth.
“Nobody’s going to come up here.” Tony ground his hips up against Steve, causing the blond to shudder. “Besides, we’ve waited long enough, don’t you think?”
“It was… perfect,” Steve says, and in that moment, it finally dawns on him that he never had the chance to thank Tony. “But I only managed to live that life because of you.”
Tony heard a sharp hiss from Steve, but he didn’t care. Whoever said werewolf blood tasted disgusting clearly must have never tried it before because Tony was euphoric. Maybe it was because he hadn't had a drink in a couple days, or maybe it was because it was Steve's blood, but Tony loved it. It tasted heady, rich, and slightly sweet; it tasted like Steve.
Too caught up in his thoughts, he doesn’t even realize that the ship has been in hyper speed until Nebula speaks up. “Ten minutes to Earth.”
But the rest of the sentence doesn’t come. Instead, Tony’s hands reach up to grab the front of Steve’s shirt, and before the blond can process what’s happening, he’s being pulled down and his lips meet Tony’s.
But then they started talking, and it was then that Tony realized just how much he’s missed Steve. Because as angry and hurt he still is over the whole Accords thing, he still cares. And as much as he tries to convince himself, he has never stopped caring, and he knows that Steve hasn’t either.
“Condoms and lube are in the bottom drawer.” Steve bent down to get them, giving Tony a questioning look. “What? I like to be prepared.”
With some effort, they tried to manoeuvre themselves so that they could lie on the bed. It wasn’t easy, what with Steve’s knot and all, but also because with every shift Tony made with his hips, Steve would come in small bursts, a sensation that had Tony shuddering. He powered through it, moving until they were both on their sides. With Tony’s legs still needing to be wrapped around Steve’s waist, it was an awkward position, a position that left Steve at Tony’s shoulder level, and Tony needing to bend down in order to look at Steve, but at least the both of them were more comfortable.
At that moment, Steve looked at him, and with those bright blue eyes and warm smile, Tony knew, deep down, that this was the man he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, that those three words would come naturally sooner or later.
Steve had said those words hours ago, but he’s still no closer to finding the words to describe the immense tragedy of what just happened. Bucky. Sam. Wanda. Countless others. All gone and turned to dust at a snap. All that fighting and bloodshed for nothing.
“Me? Lonely? Please,” Tony replied, taking a swig of his beer before he could say something stupid like
Too caught up in these sensations, Tony didn’t even realize Steve had shifted him slightly until one thrust had him seeing stars. Every single thrust now rubbed directly on his prostate, and Tony knew it wouldn’t be long before he reached his climax, the heat and tension already building up deep inside him.
Carefully, he pushed the door open. The room was dark, but the wreck was clear. A chill ran down his spine immediately, and before he could wonder why, his eyes fell on the source of the destruction.
This was true. Perhaps it was because of the distance, the lure of the unknown, that Tony had overheard many of the younger demons in particular, those who were born after the pact, having whispered discussions over wanting to meet an angel. He had heard of those stories before, of angels and demons becoming friends, becoming more than friends. Mainly rumours and gossip, never knowing if any of them were true, or more importantly, if anything happened to them. He would be lying if he never thought about it, about what would happen if he ever met an angel, but he never once thought it would have ended like this.
Thrusting his hips back, Tony gasped Steve's name out as the man's cock pressed right up against his prostate. He clenched, drawing another growl out of Steve. "
“Come on then.” Steve got up, arms flexing as he put on his jacket, smiling as he notices Tony staring. As they walked out, Tony turned to see Clint mouthing “Finally!” and Bruce “Be careful!”, while Natasha just shook her head with a smile on her face. He mouthed back “Put it on my tab!” before turning back to see Steve getting onto a motorcycle. He handed over a helmet to Tony. “Safety first, right?”
“For a long time now.” Steve’s hand slowly travelled up, running across Tony’s chest, across the lines embedded in the skin. The tingling got stronger too, but now it was more like an electric shock, jolts that frayed Tony’s nerves, bordering on the edge of actually hurting. “Our main mission is to make sure your kind doesn’t cause too much trouble. But centuries of watching a person changes things. I started caring about you. I was starting to want to talk to you, to actually want to interact with you face-to-face and not have one-sided conversations.”
Steve gestured back towards Thor. “The big guy. He wanted me to let you know that he wants to pay for whatever Bruce wants.” Steve then leaned forward to whisper, “If I’m being honest, if you wanted Thor to pay for all your drinks, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind either.”
He talks about Pepper, about how she’s started a charity in Tony’s name, aimed at helping those affected by the snap, specialising in counselling for those suffering from trauma. She still feels his death very deeply, but channels that grief into helping others, running the charity like the strong woman she is, all the while being a great mother to Morgan.
When it finally comes into view, Steve has no clue what kind of craft he is looking at. It isn't something of Earth, that he is sure of. It lands, the hatch opens and the stairs descend. The remaining Dora Milaje stand at attention, preparing for the worst. And Steve doesn’t know what to expect, but it sure isn’t the blue humanoid that walks out and towards them. He doesn’t want to stare, but he can’t help it. He has no idea who, or what, she is.
Steve immediately opens the door, only to step into the common area of the Avengers Headquarters. On one of the sofas, he sees a woman with a head of bright red hair, her feet resting on the coffee table.
“But…” For a moment, Tony thought about what would happen to them if they actually got together and if they were found out. He was already from hell, so it wasn’t like he could be sent any lower. Maybe he would just be forbidden to ever go back to Earth. There was a good chance that he would only get a light reprimanding, then a praising from his boss for being able to corrupt an angel. He might even become famous for doing so. Being a higher-level demon, he knew that he would only face minimal punishment. But for Steve? Even humans knew what happened to angels if they sinned. “You’ll be forced out of heaven.”
Instantly, he finds himself in the Avengers tower. Walking around, he notices someone outside, sitting at the edge of the quinjet landing pad, silhouette illuminated by the setting sun.
After pressing a comforting kiss to the top of Steve's head, Tony shifted until he was close to the man's neck, close enough to hear his pulse beating fast and strong.
Even though he saw his name, Tony couldn’t believe that someone would give him flowers. “Do you know who did this?”
“I’m serious! I-” Tony was cut off by Steve’s lips crashing onto his, now his turn to grind their hips together. The friction between their growing erections had Tony moaning, throwing his head back only for Steve to attack his neck, pressing kisses and biting marks onto the column of skin. His hands went down to undo Tony’s jeans, pulling them down along with his briefs, hand then coming up to palm his now fully erect cock.
Tony had never actually seen the photoshoot before, always opting to escape the noise and crowd, but since they had some time left, they decided to stop for a while to watch.
Steve was close, his movements becoming erratic. He leaned forward, staring right into Tony’s eyes. “I want to come inside you.” And fuck, if that wasn’t the hottest thing Tony heard. The look on Steve’s face showed that even though he hadn’t asked, he still wanted a confirmation, for Tony to tell him that it was okay.
“What?” Tony glanced at his friends, wondering what the hell they were doing. Then, when it dawned on him, he looked back up at Steve.
With a huff, Steve pulled away, sending Tony an indignant look before lying down, curling his body around Tony’s. Laughing, Tony continued to pet Steve, leaning back against the warm, furry body surrounding him. Enveloped by the warmth, and tired out by his anxiety, Tony started dozing off. His eyelids felt heavier and heavier, and he began to close his eyes, but not before he told Steve, “Don’t worry. I’m not going to leave you.”
Sleepy after two orgasms, Tony absent-mindedly trailed his hands down his torso. He almost dozed off until he noticed a slight swell to his belly. Running his fingers over his skin, Tony’s mind didn’t immediately register what it was. When he finally did, the blood rushed to his cheeks, burning at the realisation of just how much of Steve’s cum was inside him, completely filled up, just like Steve promised. It all felt so wrong, but so right at the same time.
Tony was riding on the edge when Steve pulled away and pressed a kiss to the base of his spine, a finger coming up to rub around the wet ring. He moved away, leaving Tony cold again at the loss, but Steve was back before he knew it, a hand rubbing soothing circles on his back.
Steve desperately wants to go, but he knows that he can’t leave without saying anything, not after everything he’s been through with her. “I love you.”
Rocket drops to his knees then, sobbing into his paws. Steve doesn’t have to ask. Along with Groot, he just lost his family. He’s all alone.
“I forced you into this.” The feelings of guilt were stronger than ever. “You said it yourself that you didn’t believe in bonded mates, but I made you do it. You didn’t have to but you did. All because I couldn’t control my stupid urges. You only wanted to help, and now you’re stuck in this forever.”
Immediately, Steve is no longer in the common room, finding himself transported to the bar from all those years ago, where he first saw Peggy in that stunning red dress.
That was all it took. Tony came with a groan as the orgasm hit, high on the euphoria that came with it. The pleasure he felt was unbelievable. No one had ever made him feel this good.
“God no. I have fantasized about my wedding, so no, it’s not that.” Steve was about to say something, but Tony stopped him. “And before you ask, no, it wasn’t the sex either. I… nothing can describe how great that night was. I might have been drunk, but I remember everything.”
Tony could only stare at him, a million and one questions running through his head. Who the hell was this guy, and why the hell wasn’t he terrified of being with a demon, not to mention wanting to sleep with one? And now, he wanted to see Tony in his true form? Who, and what, was Steve?
He’s shaken out of his thoughts as Tony moves his hand away. He can’t even mourn the loss of contact when Tony pushes him onto the bed. He pushes himself upright, resting on his elbows, just in time to see Tony rid himself of his pants and briefs.
Not because he doesn’t love Steve, he does, but because those three words aren’t enough to convey everything that he wants to say.
“Had some details on the arson case a few days back that you guys needed. Also, I wanted to make sure you had your coffee for the day,” Steve said, placing a cup of coffee on the desk.
He thinks that sooner or later, he’s going to have a heart attack. That it will be what finally kills him.
Tony must have sent that desire out, because Steve was hard again, rubbing against the cleft of Tony’s ass, which only amplified Tony’s lust even more.
He turns, and for a second, Tony is floored by how bright the blue eyes directed at him are. He almost doesn’t hear Steve when he says, “I know you’re going to do whatever it takes to get them back. And you’re not going to stop until you do.”
“I don’t care,” Steve said, voice now steady. Tony could only stare at him. Was he really that naive to think that?
“Have you seen yourself?” Tony asked incredulously. “You were shirtless! And yes, while I find you unbelievably attractive, it wasn’t just me. Everyone was staring, even Nat! And you had a freaking puppy in your arms! How could I not look at you?”
There is Tony, right in front of him, looking healthy and energetic. His hair is a lot darker from the last time he saw him, less white and grey. The wrinkles from the years of torment and stress are mostly gone, big brown eyes still shining bright with life, appearing the same way he did when Steve first met him all those years ago in Germany.
Tony could feel his brain shut down, conscious of only the moan that left his lips, echoing in the small elevator. Steve pulled back at the sound, his hand coming up to Tony’s chin, tilting his head back until they were staring eye to eye. Tony could only watch breathless as those baby blues darted down to his lips before travelling back up, the lust in them burning right into Tony’s soul. In all his hook-ups, he had always kept to one rule: no kissing. But this,
When Tony didn’t answer, he replied. “You still think we angels are all pure and innocent and naive? What part of any of this makes you think I’m innocent? Besides, everyone’s morally grey now. No one’s completely good or evil anymore.”
Tony didn’t always feel that way. Boredom started about a three hundred years into their friendship, and loneliness only appeared less than a century ago, but now that such feelings existed, he couldn’t stop them. As a vampire, Tony wanted to hate Steve for introducing such emotions into his head, but how could he when Steve also brought so much joy into his life?
And now… Steve was here, telling him everything he had known but never admitted. And Tony knew he would be lying to himself if his time with Steve so far, however short a time it might be, hasn’t been nothing short of the best he’s ever had. Steve knew all his sensitive spots, the places that made him moan, places where no one had ever paid that much attention to.
Tony doesn’t respond, and for a horrible moment, Steve wonders if he’s said the wrong thing, afraid that he’s just ruined whatever frail connection they’ve just made.
It was a short ride however, because Steve carefully dropped him onto the bed. Tony had barely settled on the mattress when Steve flipped him over onto his stomach. Being manhandled so easily, Tony knew that he might have just discovered a new kink.
Tony mouthed along the outline of Steve’s hard length, which earned him a groan from the blond above him. With a smirk, Tony reached under the elastic of the briefs, wrapping his hand around Steve’s erection, almost whimpering from desire when he noticed his hand barely managed to wrap around it. He gave it a few pumps before pulling it out, licking his lips at the sight before him. He’s watched plenty of porn throughout his life, and he’s been with enough men, both human and supernatural, to know that most of it was fake and to never expect too much. But Steve, Steve’s was big enough to put all of them to shame. To think that this thick, hard length was going to be in him soon was enough to make Tony shiver with anticipation.
Steve resists the urge to reach for Tony’s hand. “Thank you, Tony. For everything. You saved the world. You saved the team.”
“I’ve liked you for a while now,” Steve said, a shy smile on his face. “Way before we slept together. But after that night, when you told me what you wanted, I respected it. That was until recently, when I felt things were changing between us, so I thought…”
A shiver ran down Tony’s spine at the feeling of Steve’s warm breath against his ear. Mentally calming himself down, all he said in response was, “He just ordered a beer.”
But that’s not why Steve can barely breathe. It’s because this is the Tony he truly knows. Not the one he saw in the alternate timeline when he was returning the stones. Not the one who he took care of and watched grow up in the timeline where he grew old with Peggy. This Tony is the one from his own reality, the one he spent years arguing with and fighting alongside with. This is the Tony he had so deeply hurt, the one that he somehow managed to patch things up with even after everything. This is the Tony that sacrificed his life, the one that he watched die.
Steve gets back onto the bed, holding himself over Tony once again. He pulls Tony’s hand away, laces their fingers together. Steve kisses him on the lips, on the jaw, along his neck, slowly making his way down Tony’s body. It may have been years, but Steve remembers Tony’s body. All his sensitive places, places that leave the man a whimpering mess.
“Yes, but that’s not it. It’s just… I don’t want to lose you,” Tony said, surprised at how heavy this was all getting. But it was the truth. Sure, after a long day at work of catching bad guys and solving crime, Tony would want nothing more than to be able to go home and have Steve there, a warm presence waiting for him. Similarly, Tony knew that Steve would want him there for him as well, a source of comfort at the end of a gruelling day. But as much as Tony wanted that, he was afraid to think of how great the loss would be if they had that, if they got to experience all of that only to lose it. “And I’m sure you don’t want to lose me either.”
After that, it was coffee, which, although weird, Tony greatly appreciated. Written on the cup was: ‘I like you a latte’, which again, was a lame pickup line, but Tony did enjoy the pun. The coffee was made to his own specific preferences, which made Tony sure that someone in the station was behind all this.
There was silence. Then, the guilt and fear dissipated, and in their place came fondness, devotion, and reverence. A smile grew on Steve’s face, his blue eyes now bright and radiating happiness. “I love you.”
Tony was broken out of his thoughts as he felt Steve’s hand on his own cock, stroking in rough jerks. His thumb ran over the already wet tip, and the building heat in Tony's lower abdomen grew all the more intense, that all too familiar coil getting tighter and tighter, ready to snap at any given moment.
So, what if his colleagues earned money off it, as long as he ended up with Steve, he didn’t really care. Maybe he would place in a bet himself; he could always use the extra money for the honeymoon.
As he pumped his fingers in and out of Tony, Steve continued biting marks along Tony’s chest, marks that would eventually disappear by tomorrow morning. “Don’t wanna hurt you,” Steve said, breathe hot against Tony’s collarbone. He spread his fingers, opening up Tony even more.
“Thanks babe.” Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek, but when he moved away, he noticed the entire room had gone quiet. He looked around to see that the everyone was staring at them.
“Rogers.” Tony could only hide behind a smirk, trying to flirt his way out of the awkwardness. “What are you doing here? Want to buy me a drink?”
He can’t see Steve’s face, but he knows that he is smiling. He can feel it. And as much as he wants to see his smile, he doesn’t want to ruin the moment. He stays there, feels as Steve turns back to face the sunrise and laces their fingers together.
A noise from the bathroom alerted him, and he turned to see that the previously opened door was now closed.
“What we just did… would you call that incompatible?” The demon blushed at that response. He couldn’t deny it. Steve knew all the right places to touch, and Tony’s own body was open and receptive to anything the angel did. It was as if they were made for each other, Tony’s aching body attesting to that fact.
