Steve blushed a deep rose at his voice but didn’t say anything and dutifully went upstairs.
Tony finished eating and thanked Steve for ‘Such a fabulous dinner’ and then added on a ‘I don't wanna be ungrateful or anything but can I go back and finish - only two hours.’, then when he saw Bucky’s face, Tony tacked on ‘I swear!’ and only then did Bucky nod.
Bucky walked over to the bed and Steve held the sheets back so he could lie Tony in the middle.
“Nothing” Steve mouthed back, still with a smile. He then slid down so his head was on the pillow and put his arm around Tony, bringing him closer so they were touching; chest to back.
Bucky set him down on to chair and Tony was breathing heavily due to his little rant but he kept on going.
Tony wrapped his legs around Bucky's waist as he was picked up.
Bucky then looked up to see Steve watching him with a fond smile on his face.
“Buckyyy”he whined,
Bucky watched Steve go to the bathroom to brush his teeth and if he stared at his arse as well, nobody was there to question him. Bucky got out of his warm, comfortable spot in the bed to drag his brown eyed beauty  back upstairs.
“I don’t like it when its completely dark. That's when Howard would beat me. If I didn’t close my curtains he won’t come into the room because then he’d have to close them and someone might be able to him from the window. Then I got used to it.”
“Look I didn't want it to come to this but it will have to be done” Bucky said as he picked Tony up causing him to yelp - not that Tony will ever admit that he made such a noise.
Bucky watched Tony’s eyelashes brush his cheek. The way they fluttered softly. The way his mouth was slightly turned up. Bucky watched how peaceful Tony looked.
“Its okay baby. You get ready for bed and I’ll bring him. We all need to sleep. ” Bucky told him with a small smile on his face.
“You’ve been in here almost 10 hours today, doll. You haven't eaten. I didn’t want to distract you but you need some energy. Come on Tony.” Bucky murmured softly, not wanting to be loud as he knew Tony must have a headache. He could see it on his lover's face, the wince as he dropped something or the bright lights of the lab.
Bucky kissed Tony’s forehead then Steve’s arm and said goodnight. He closed eyes, ready for the next day, where he could spend more time with his lovers.
But before Steve could respond to him Bucky spoke up,
“Come on doll. Come to bed.” Bucky asked him
“Why don’t you have curtains in the bedroom?”
Bucky looked back at Tony. The glow of the moon softly lighting up Tony’s face, Bucky could properly see Tony. Tony with no worry lines on his face. Tony with no frown.
Bucky didn’t say anything and just sat on the bed and began to read his book; The Ascent of Man. Bucky had almost finished six more chapters when he noticed Steve yawning loudly.
“Now you’re gonna eat and no excuses. Pepper can wait”
Bucky looked at the clock on their bedside table. It was 2.36 in the morning and Bucky felt angry at himself for not noticing the time. That he was too engrossed in his book to notice that it’d been 4 hours since both he and Steve came up.
“What?” Bucky mouthed at him - not wanting speak as he didn’t want Tony to wake up.
“You really didn't have to do that. I would eaten whatever you’d made. No one has cooked for me like this and anyway there was no need bothering this much for me”
‘You know if he doesn’t come back in two hours I will carry him to bed myself. Its 10 o’clock.’ Steve said to Bucky
“I need to finish this. Pepper will kill me if it’s not done and you know she's kinda scary and I'm already behind the deadline for this. Come on Bucky! I only need two hours.” Tony kept on going to till they had reached the kitchen where Steve was setting down dinner on the table. Though to be fair, Tony hadn’t noticed as he kept on rambling about how unfair his life was and that Bucky was bullying him.
Bucky watched the two. Part happy that Tony has stopped and part shocked that Steve went to the trouble and heard Tony say as much to him.
Tony opened his eyes to turn around so he was facing the super soldier. Tony looked into his strong blue eyes as he put a hand on his cheek. The genius felt himself leaning into the innocent touch.
Steve blushed and began to protest but Bucky cut him off.
“My God Steve. This is amazing. Last time I had this just as good was when Jarvis had made it” Tony told him.
Bucky just shook his head and did the same. He slid down so he was facing the two of them and put his own arm around so that he was touching both of them.
“No its okay. I wanna wait for Tony. Want him here too.”
Tony closed his eyes as he felt Bucky come behind him and wrap his arms around him. One cool and one hot. Tony leaned back into Bucky’s chest feeling his strong chest against him feeling safe and content in his boyfriend's arms.
Steve blushed and looked away.
Bucky then took of his clothes so he was in just his joggers. He then turned the lamp of that was emitting a soft glow in the room and slipped into bed. The moonlight was shining through the window - they didn’t have any curtains. Bucky remembers when he questioned Tony about it.
Tony opened his mouth and was instantly cut off by Steve.
“Just give me two more hours Buck. I just need to work out this thing and I’ll be right there with you.” tony told him. Then he started to mumble to himself about something sciencey. Bucky didn't understand nor did he want to. He knew Tony, he was a stubborn man.
“Look Tony. It’s spaghetti with beef and lentil meatballs.”
“What? How’d you know that it's my favorite? I've never told you” Tony asked accusingly
He then picked up Tony bridal style, trying his best not to jostle him too much so that he wouldn’t wake up. Bucky carried him upstairs where he found Steve about to get into bed, wearing only a shirt leaving his legs on view and Bucky looked at him in awe - his beautiful Steve.
‘So you are dressed as your own father?’ Loki scoffed, ‘You know that this means that either A. you will have to be all lovely-dovely with Steven for the rest of the night, or B. you just forced me into a relationship with “Anthony”.’ Loki shuddered at the thought, a chuckle then leaving his lips. ‘Yeah, you know what? Those are both absolutely horrifying outcomes. You did a splendid job, Peter. I cannot imagine anything more disturbing.’
‘Hey! Hold still! I’m bringing you back to your nest, you little stray birdie!’ The doctor grumbled, opening a portal with one hand while keeping the raven as far from him as possible with his other.
‘Mister Ant-man!’ Loki shouted, completely amazed by the man’s small form. ‘How did, I mean, what… Thor!’ the raven looked at his older brother and raised his hand. ‘Brother, look! Over here! This is amazing!’
The trickster nodded along, not really knowing how else to react. ‘Might I ask you for something to eat, sir?’ he then asked, his hands now on his stomach as he came to realize he had not yet eaten breakfast.
Quill couldn’t help but laugh at that, imagining the picture Peter just described. ‘You really worry too much,’ he smiled, ‘You’re an Avenger, right? Just wear a disguise when you have to go to the store. Tell you this, you put on a baseball hat and some sunglasses, maybe throw in a hoody, and I bet you no one will recognize you.’
‘Blood?’ Natasha repeated with a frown. ‘Rape?’
Thor’s eyes widened as he looked around himself, noticing that Loki was, yet again, gone without a trace.
‘Oh yeah? Well what if I do this,’ Peter smirked, tickling Loki until he was squealing and squirming under his touch. ‘How you like that, War Machine?’
‘I knew you would like it,’ Peter smiled brightly as he laughed along. ‘Now come on, let’s go. We don’t want to be late for the party. Thor just told me that Quill and his gang are already here so…’
‘W-well, yes, but, I never-’
‘Was he drunk enough to just fall out of the window?’ Tony asked as he sat backwards on his chair, a smile on his face as he was about to win his bet with Sam.
Steve cautiously walked in, eyes charting the entire room, admiring every little gadget Tony had been working on. Trusting his master’s words he ventured further, looking at all the strange technology and weapons which were either carefully displayed or carelessly scattered across the floor.
just keeps stealing them.’
Thor nodded and he gulped, ‘I went inside, closed the door behind me. I saw that all the lights were still on and that Loki was not in his bed. He had left the uhm, the bathroom door unlocked so I…’ Thor took a deep breath, trying to steady his trembling voice. ‘I peeked inside, and I- I saw Loki, standing there. He was… crying and shivering, his skin was all red from the hot water…’ He fell silent as the vision of his younger brother was burned into his eyes.
‘And you didn’t even come in to check what was going on?’
‘We haven’t spoken to our soldier yet, want me to go after them?’
Bucky still remained silent.
‘Then why were you crying when we you found Killian?’ Tony asked casually, continuing his questioning before the girl could even answer. ‘Were you in love with him? Did Bucky or Thor found out? Maybe one of them killed Killian because they did not want him to be around you?’
Steve listened to his master, struggling to get on his feet after sitting on his knees for what felt like months. After a few wobbling steps he managed to stand in front of his master.
He crawled to the other end of the bed and opened the drawer of his nightstand in search of a condom. He managed to find one underneath a pile of forgotten SI files, lubricated and cherry flavored. He never really liked them all that much, yet he was rather safe than…
The kid squeaked and froze in his track, only to quickly turn around, his face still hidden by the cover of darkness and his hoody. ‘Y-you’re mister Stark-!’
Lots of love.
‘Man of Spiders…’ Loki repeated and he looked up at Peter, ‘why is it they call you so?’
‘Thor, I was wondering,’ the raven started as he huddled up against the blond, listening to his soothing heartbeat while the warmth of the man’s body made him feel like he was home. ‘When will we be returning to Asgard? Mother must be worried, and I really miss her.’
Loki looked inside, hoping to find some fruit or bread but all he saw were sweets and small colorful cans filled with drinks. He took a black can out of the refrigerator and looked at the bright green letter M written on it.
Carefully stretching out his hand, Tony placed his fingers on the Beast’s paw. He trailed the creature’s skin, fingers moving through soft fur until he gently held on to his hand.
Tony’s movements picked up speed, the sound of skin slapping and the playboy’s moans breaking the silence of the bedroom. The smell of sweat and sex filled the air, though soon another scent mixed in as well. A scent Tony could not quite grasp.
‘I don’t know.’ The doll stared at the empty wall in front of him, not daring to meet his master’s eye. ‘I have no existing data on a child.’
‘Your shirts, sir. They fit but just barely. It seems like the shirt he is currently wearing will end up at least two sizes bigger.’
The god of thunder and the god of mischief.
‘The captain must have taken shelter in there,’ Thor said, trying to look through the windows, hoping to spot the beast. ‘We should proceed with caution…’
, a little privacy. He turned around one last time to make sure Steve had everything he needed.
That was, until he saw Steve stepping out of the car.
Pepper remained silent for a moment, her nose slightly wrinkled as she was thinking of what to say. ‘Yes, and no,’ she answered. ‘Only if necessary. He sometimes helps with maintenance, but mostly takes care of security.’
He pushed the machine from his lap and jumped to his feet. He panted, his mind still racing over whether to be shocked or aroused. ‘Why-?! Don’t you-!’ he stammered, then took a deep breath to try and collect himself. ‘Why… Did you do that?’
‘What’s
‘But…’ Peter let out a sigh, ‘fine…’ He watched the god and his father disappear in the dark woods surrounding the Avengers Compound. He sat down on the bottom of the stairs with a defeated sigh, waiting for his boyfriend.
I truly hope you have enjoyed this fic, and would like to thank you all again from the bottom of my heart!
‘I don’t have any evidence, not yet. But I’m sure we’ll find some if you could give me and my team some time.’ Steve tried, but already saw that Fury was not buying it. He had to come up with something better.
‘Obie!’ There was both relief and bewilderment in the playboy’s voice. ‘What the fuck is this?!’
‘This is Loki, sir. A spell failed and backfired, causing his body to degenerate to a child-stage form.’
Tony panted and covered his eyes with his hands. He could not believe what he saw. Could not believe that Obie, who was a family friend before he was even born, was capable of such cruelty.
‘P-please unhand me,’ Loki managed to speak between chocked up sobs. ‘I-I am a prince of Asgard! You will come to regret it if you put me through any harm!’
‘There’s something we’ve overlooked, Tony,’ Steve said as the two of them were sitting at the corner of a bar of a small pub. The smell of freshly brewed coffee and liquor mixed in the air as the regular costumers were slowly dripping in. Some were standing by the old pool table, leisurely taking turns, laughing all the while. Most people were sitting at a table, smoking their cigarettes or cigars, a drink in their hand while they talked. ‘Or something we’ve missed…’
frustration. ‘Okay, so what? You on mute or something?’ Tony sighed deeply as the doll nodded, perching his hands on his hips. ‘Unmute. Now tell me, what the hell was that all about?’
Tony’s arms draped over the blond’s shoulders, fingers gently caressing the back of his neck. He felt Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist, holding him close yet still allowing him to move freely. He breathed the machine’s air and basked in the warmth coming from his artificial body.
‘Loki,’ Peter said as he cautiously held on to the trickster’s hand, their fingers intertwining, ‘does this mean that you…?’
‘We will be seeing you tomorrow, Mister Barnes,’ Steve smiled one last time and walked through the doorway. He grabbed the handle and wanted to close the door behind him but was stopped by the soldier’s voice.
‘Yeah, I know,’ A grin formed on Tony’s lips. ‘Quite surprising that I’m here considering this is my home. Now tell me; who are you and what do you want?’
Peter’s heart drummed in his chest as he waited nervously for his father to open the door. He already imagined what it would look like, imagined the posters he had brought hanging above his new bed and what little clothes he could bring neatly folded in his new wardrobe.
‘She is,’ Wanda took a step back, inventing the two to come inside. ‘Are you here to tell us that it was murder?’
Steve nodded slowly, a wrinkle forming between his brows as he thought this through. ‘And Barnes?’
‘Oh, no, please don’t worry!’ Peter said with as much of a reassuring smile as he could muster, ‘My dad Tony always played a DVD every time I didn’t want to go to bed. Worked like a charm, I was always out cold within the first five minutes.’ He laughed nervously, hoping the god would agree with his tactic.
Stane gritted his teeth, his voice filled with frustration and anger. ‘This is all your fault! If that little freak of yours doesn’t come back I’ll fucking sell you off on the black market! See how kind those people are to a fuck toy.’ He pushed the blond back to the ground, followed by a merciless kick in his chest.
Tony held his breath as the blond’s lips were only inches away from his own, his fingers working with precision to further unbutton his shirt.
‘Cool! You hear that, God-man?’ Quill smiled, wrapping an arm around Thor necks. ‘We’re family now!’
‘… You must be making jest…’ Loki mumbled as he kept his distance. ‘Y-you are not Thor! Yes, my brother is older than I am, but certainly not, well, like you! How dare you mock the soon to be king of Asgard!’
Steve shrugged, his smile never fading even though he did still seem a little tense. ‘Well, if you want it red and gold then…’ he stared at the doodle and grabbed a marker. ‘Might I offer some changes to your design?’
‘Yeah, okay, I need a drink, something to wash away the sour taste of crippling guilt and give me back my manliness.’ Tony jumped up from the couch after he took a deep breath. ‘Kid Lokes is going to be the death of me, I swear.’ He then walked towards the kitchen, his hand amiably ruffling up Peter’s hair as he walked past him. ‘Steve, remind me to make a dentist appointment tomorrow. This scene was so sweet I think I can actually feel my teeth rotting away in my mouth.’
Anyway, hope you guys enjoyed it and have an awesome day! :D
Tony closed his eyes as the muscles in his stomach tightened. The doll’s ass slicking up. The playboy blissfully assumed it was caused by his precum, having no idea that the machine had started to bleed long ago.
‘Woow, easy, Peter. Come on, breath. Deep breaths,’ Steve inhaled deeply, gesturing for the teen to follow his lead. They stood there for a couple of minutes before he placed a hand on the boy’s back, guiding him towards the end of the room where two simple cots awaited them.
Steve did not reply, the only sound coming from him being whimpers and growls of pain.
‘And the saddest part is that Loki did not have to do all this,’ Natasha held a stack of papers in her hand, flipping through them as she continued. ‘I did some research. All the papers of the refugees are properly taken care off. There was no way Killian could have expelled them from the Mansion, let alone send them back to their own countries.’
‘But he’s still a kid,’ Steve shrugged. ‘And he’ll probably always be a kid in his brother’s eyes. Thor must have lost his trust in about everyone after his parents’ death. The police in his homeland couldn’t protect them then, so why should he trust us now?’
”’ He stepped closer to Thor, continuing his singing.
‘And these four, among many other, were send to Potts Refugee Reception Office,’ Tony stood up from his chair, gaining the attention of his co-workers. ‘Miss Virginia "Pepper" Potts, owner of the Potts mansion and Potts RRO, it is the primary point of contact for asylum seekers and refugees with the government. It is where asylum seekers can apply for asylum for refugee status, where interviews are conducted, where permits are renewed, and where refugee status documents are handed out. Miss Potts is not married, no children.’
the oldest, so… I guess we better listen to him.’
here?!’ He looked the stranger up and down, eyes wide as he noticed the chain attached to the man’s ankle, his breath coming in rapid heaves. ‘W-what the hell is that for?! Are you dangerous?! Stay away from me!’
‘Oh, look who’s laughing! At least I’m not wearing an
Friends of mine will be going as well! Dressed as Ragnarok's Bruce Banner (in Tony's clothes), Steve Rogers (also in disguise) and Spider-man.
Tony nodded and quickly tried to down half his cup of coffee in one big gulp. He cursed however as it spilled from the cup, leaving a large stain on his expansive dress shirt. ‘Ah, fuck!’
Tony placed his hands on Steve’s hips and hallowed his cheeks, skillfully fucking his face on the blond’s cock. He licked the head, the bitterness of pre-cum sending a shiver down his spine, his moans stifled as he buried Steve’s cock in his throat again. It did not take long before he felt the blond’s hips quiver underneath his touch, telling him that he was about to come. Tony looked up through his lashes and saw Steve’s chest heaving heavily with each breath he took.
‘What is a sinn potion?’ Peter asked worriedly, looking at the two gods.
‘Loki,’ Steve grabbed the trickster’s wrist, holding onto it tightly. ‘I, I don’t feel so good…’ he mumbled as he grabbed his stomach with his other hand.
‘Horrible weather, huh?’
‘No!’ Strange let out a loud sigh, ‘If I wanted to I wouldn’t bring you back here, would I?’
‘No…’ the blond whispered. He didn’t understand his own emotions, didn’t understand why it felt like stones weighed heavy in his stomach. ‘No… master, please-!’
Peter looked up at the god, a smile finally forming on his face again, ‘Never,’ he mumbled softly.
‘That was amazing!’
So this is probably my favorite chapter of this very short story.
‘So, you like it here?’ Peter asked as he felt the trickster’s small hand carefully searching for his own. He smiled and picked the raven up, letting him sit on his shoulders.
them! My dads are gonna kill me when they find out… Oh no, wait, let me rephrase that, first Thor is going to kill me, then he’ll bring me back to life, and then my dads are going to kill me.’
‘Oh, hey, welcome back, Clint,’ Steve smiled at the man.
‘… I thought I already told you,’ Pepper smiled, slightly confused.
‘NO!’
‘Great, I will use Gungnir and you can have Sleipnir, that way nothing can stop us from our quest!’ Loki shouted happily as he took Peter by his hand and pulled him towards the garden.
The four of them fell completely silent, Bucky’s expression going dark within a split second. ‘Yes?’
‘Then… who’s the kid on the second floor? He looked shocked to see us, or rather, to see St- the doll.’
The raven looked at the soldier for a moment and then smiled brightly, ‘Yes, sir, thank you.’
‘It’s okay,’ a male voice, gentle and warm, whispered. ‘I won’t hurt you. I promise.’ The rattling stopped, by which Peter guessed the man had stopped moving.
I adjusted both songs just slightly to fit the story, but I do hope you will recognize them and that it will make you laugh.
Stane sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He didn’t look up as three men entered the basement, their faces hidden underneath the yellow suit they were wearing, their gloved hands filled with tools and paperwork. Steve recognized them as his creators. One of them walked up to Obadiah and whispered something in his ear.
They almost caught up with the blond, almost. Just a few more feet and…
‘Stop what?’ Tony asked innocently, though he could not suppress his smirk. He then sighed at the blond’s slightly unamused expression. ‘Steve, relax. We’ll be fine as long as no one at the police station finds out.’
‘… Big brother?’
‘Hmm,’ Tony thought this over. ‘Still weird though. That you need to eat, that is. Or at least feel hunger. I’ll have to check your tech sometime.’ He placed a reassuring hand on Steve’s shoulder as the doll looked at him with fear. ‘Don’t worry. I’m not gonna take you apart or anything. Just wanne have a look, that’s all.’
‘Hey, I’m not sharing my captain with anyone, not even with a princess!’ Peter glared at his father, pointing the fake gauntlet at him, ‘So if anyone’s gonna get lucky with him it would be me!’ The teen’s eyes then widened, he pulled a face and nearly gagged as he lowered the fake Iron Man gauntlet, ‘Oh my god, I just… I just fought my dad because I wanted to, to…’ He then turned to the trickster, ‘Damn it Lokes, I hate this potion!’
‘Let me guess,’ Tony asked with a slightly frustrated smile. ‘No witnesses?’
‘However?’ Tony pried as the AI seemed to hesitate.
She stared into the garden, carefully holding a tray with some toast, coffee and the newspaper. The view was beautiful no matter where one would stand, but she liked it best from here, the third floor, overseeing every flower, bush and tree.
The four super heroes roamed through the woods, following a trail of footsteps which could have only been from the captain.
The ride took about another hour or so, locating them far away from the orphanage and to the outskirts of town. Their eyes widened as they drove up towards Stane’s mansion; butterflies fluttering from one flower to the next in the perfect garden, birds chirping happily as they made their nests in the large oak trees.
‘Oh, hey, Thor,’ Natasha said as she walked in as well, a slight smile on her face, Bucky and Clint right behind her.
‘Yes, the Destroyer,’ Strange nodded and folded his hands, ‘I think I have every right to keep him on my list, just to be sure.’
‘I start to understand why my brother does not look at you in favor,’ Thor grumbled, leaning against the wall.
No, it was still quiet, and Loki let out a content sigh as he enjoyed this rare phenomenon.
‘I will turn into my sister…’ He looked at Thor, his eyes pleading, ‘I will be like Hela!’
‘So, you couldn’t go to Pepper, nor the police, ‘cause hey? Who would they believe; A well respected American businessman or a crazy, broken, Russian lab experiment?’ Tony smirked, this harsh remark causing Steve to glare at him from the corner of his eye.
‘Sure Loki, no problem,’ Steve smiled, helping Loki to put some more butter in his pan.
‘What happened next, Mister Odinson?’
‘Cohabitants?’ Stark raised his brows at the fancy word. ‘Don’t you mean “staff?”’
The doll was placed on a couch, countless wires connecting him from the back of his neck to different kinds of monitors and computers.
I want to thank each and everyone of you. Your Kudos,  (181?!) subscriptions (82?!) were truly heartwarming! Also, all the awesome comments that inspired me to keep writing!
Thor gulped as he thought this through, a slight feeling of frustration hitting him as he noticed he could not say with absolute certainty that his grown-up brother was living a happy life. ‘I believe you are content.’ He eventually decided to say while Loki crawled underneath the blankets.
‘Do you and Thor share a room?’ Steve asked kindly at which Loki nodded, explaining that he did not like to sleep alone. ‘Did you have a good relationship with Mister Killian?’
The doll remained silent, though it did look like it was genuinely trying to answer its owner’s question.
‘Very clever, Stark.’ A man said with an unimpressed grimace. He walked towards the two, a clipboard in hand.
‘Didn’t your parents teach you that it’s rude to stare?’
‘Wanda Maximoff, twenty-three years old, born and raised in Sokovia, a small country in Europe. Came to America at the age of fourteen and now lives and works here as a maid.’ Natasha informed the two. ‘She found the body when she tried to close his windows on the third floor. Immediately called 911.’
Tony coughed as the room filled with dust, his eyes then widening as he stared at the “present” his coworker send him.
‘Yes,’ the man answered again, feeling his blood boil.
‘That is right,’ the trickster said as he wrapped his arms around the teen’s waist. ‘Now cheer up, we still have some tracking to do.’ He then placed a gentle kiss on Peter’s forehead. ‘And we have to save New-York from a horrible monster, which is not me this time.’
‘And what is it that… t-that thou art in search of, o great warrior?’ the teen stammered, trying to guess what Asgardian English would sound like.
‘Yeah, I already heard,’ Thor interrupted Steve. ‘Killian, he’s dead, right? Bucky already told me.’
‘Monster energy…’ he mumbled. He looked at Tony, wanting to ask him if it was okay for him to take this, but as the billionaire was already focused on his project, he decided not to disturb him again.
‘If you would be so kind as to make a start,’ the god nodded, ‘I will make sure to be up there soon.’ He waited for the captain to leave the room, a gentle smile on his face as he saw his baby brother yawn.
Loki walked through the halls, searching for something he would recognize. He was used to navigating himself through large buildings, the Asgardian Palace was definitely bigger than this compound, but still, he found it hard to distinct all the rooms and halls.
‘I-I don’t know,’ the doll stammered, every muscle in his body tensing as his master closed in. His heart raced in his chest, beating loudly against his ribcage as he held his gaze low.
‘That would be a child, I think,’ Natasha Chuckled and she looked at the archer with a smirk. ‘Surely you should know.’
Completely flabbergasted by this…
‘Downloading all memories,’ the AI’s voice filled the room. ‘Download complete, sir.’
‘Well,’ Clint started and he looked at the other two for a moment, Natasha meeting his gaze with a slightly troubled expression, Bucky merely staring at the game of chess that was still standing on the coffee table. ‘you see, at first, you handed Loki to Wanda, but she had to go on a mission, so she handed Loki to me.’ The archer then swallowed and continued, ‘but I went home to get him some clothes, so I handed him to Tasha.’ He looked at the assassin, waiting for her to continue.
‘No, just-’ Tony hissed as he quickly slapped Steve’s hand from his thigh. How he wanted to pull over and kiss the doll. How he wanted to turn around and take him home, his arms wrapped around his body as they would lay in bed.
‘Oh, this?’ The blond looked at his body. ‘Yeah, not very appealing, huh?’ he shrugged, a half sided smile on his face. ‘Don’t worry about it. Try to get some sleep, okay?’
‘That is correct,’ the blond smiled. ‘And as you know, only one is deemed worthy to wield her.’
‘Yeah, they can stay,’ Steve nodded, bringing his bottle of beer to his lips. ‘Loki in the mansion, and Thor in prison…’
‘I was asleep that night,’ Loki’s voice was soft, nervousness clenching his throat. ‘I helped Wanda washing the dishes after dinner, then went to my room to do my homework. I took a shower and went to bed at ten o’ clock, as usual.’
So, about this chapter... It's not really one of my personal favorites, but I really hope you will like it.
‘Obie adopted you?’ Worry started to brew in Tony’s chest as the teen became very quiet. ‘But he told me you- you are his
The smell of candy and sweets filled the air together with the comforting sound of Avengers laughing and chatting. The lights were dimmed low, Halloween decorations in every corner, causing for a chilling effect. Music was briefly heard every time the door to the living room opened and closed and Loki swore he could hear Drax and Quill’s laughter above all the other sounds. The party had already started about an hour ago and the raven had intended to leave his bedroom sooner but making the potion took more time than he had anticipated.
had to drink it. Tony’s face twitched in irritation as he remembered his seemingly endless arguments with the god of Sassgard. He then looked at that same god who was now hanging from his neck, hugging him with the most adorable smile Tony had ever seen.
‘Thor didn’t say anything about that,’ Tony noted. ‘I wonder why. Want me to go get him?’
Or he could enjoy his brother’s company for just a few more minutes.
” The smile returned on his face, though it was more of a fiendish grin. “
Tony wondered if the doll could even feel tired, as it was more likely that its battery would run out of juice. ‘Or maybe you need to be recharged?’
The heat burned his skin, turning it a livid shade of red starting at his shoulders. The pain was welcome though as it helped to distract him from the horrid images that were saved on Steve’s memory.
Even the doll’s blood was too realistic.
‘Well, I did add extra potion to Steven’s drink, just to be sure it could counter the Super Soldier Serum running through his veins… as for me and Thor, we are Asgardians, maybe the potion does not work on us at all, and you only drank half of it, so…’
He should wake Thor and tell him to let him go.
Tony looked at the god for a moment and then at sweets carefully placed in the grass, suddenly wondering why the trickster did not just hand them to him. ‘Fine,’ he agreed, grabbing two sweets, Peter and Thor doing the same.
‘You’re forgetting the skin tissue underneath the victim’s fingernails, that could be a sign of a struggle.’ Sam noted, ‘What do you wanne do, Rogers? Should I sent someone to pick up Miss Potts?’
‘Although I appreciate your offer, I would kindly like to decline.’ The god stated, nodding slowly. ‘I do not know how long this spell will last, but I am not going to interfere by making it permanent without my brother’s consent.’
‘I start to understand why my brother does not look at you in favor,’ The trickster heard his brother grumble as he leaned heavily against a wall.
‘You bet it does,’ Peter smiled and held up his hand for a high-five, which Loki gave him with a chuckle, careful not to let his mug slip from his hands.
Sam looked at the playboy with a raised brow, but then shrugged. ‘Okay, why not? Twenty bucks saying it’s murder.’ The two shook hands while Steve walked behind them, disapprovingly shaking his head but deciding to stay out of this one.
I really hope to pick up my writing again so I can continue to finish not only "Too Human" but "Hellfire" as well.
‘Rogers,’ Fury called the man’s name just before Steve wanted to walk out of the office. ‘I’m gonna give you twenty-four hours, nothing more.’ He sighed deeply as he saw Steve’s innocent smile. ‘Get out, Rogers.’
younger brother, well, I would have-!’
‘I still have to take a bath, we could go together,’ Loki smiled innocently as the other Avengers fell completely silent.
Loki chuckled softly at that last one. Yes, he has been called an insufferable know-it-all many times, and yes, he had called his brother a naïve oaf on countless occasions. A constantly interfering, always energetic, noisy oaf.
‘Nothing.’ Steve crumbled. ‘I need a drink.’
He held up a dried salamander, its once bright yellow and pink colors now faded and dull. ‘Ugh, this is why I favor Seiðr over potions…’ the trickster mumbled as he looked at the creature in pity. He then lowered it in the mixture that was softly simmering, causing his room to illuminate bright red, after which the liquid colored a deadly pale.
‘Ah, damn,’ Quill sighed irritated. ‘Why not? Is he on a mission already? I mean, I could wait ‘til he gets back you know?’
‘Well, if you’re really that desperate,’ The scientist pressed precious kisses against his inner thigh, slowly moving towards the doll’s entrance. His nails soon followed, dragging them across artificial skin yet still leaving red stripes. Tony admired them for a second before pressing a finger into the bot’s body. ‘Fuck, you’re so tight,’ He murmured as Steve let out a restrained moan. ‘Don’t worry baby. I’m gonna work you open, nice and slowly.’
‘Could you please stop doing that?’ Thor said as he raised his finger to interrupt the man. ‘It really gives me a headache.’
The teen stared at the raven for a moment and sighed, ‘Lokes… how come only my dad transformed into his character? Why not you or me?’
The four detectives nearly jumped at the sound of a familiar voice.
‘So, no signs of any kind of struggle or fight?’ Steve asked with a frown as he looked through the pages of the report, sighing at the little help it was providing.
brat?
Steve stared at the operation table, his heart beating loudly in his chest. Something about the shiny object made his skin crawl, made his lungs refuse to suck in any oxygen. It felt like a memory was locked away, one that was unpleasant or even cruel, but he could not recall it.
Anyway, thanks again! And I hope you will have many more amazing Halloweens to come!
‘You’re lying! Aldrich was nothing like that!’
‘Me? Yeah right, as if I would ever be your subordinate.’ Tony let out a scoffing snort but he quickly got back into character as he saw the child’s disappointed expression. He cleared his throat and continued, ‘I mean, as you can see, I am in charge of creating weaponry, I have no time to spare on actual battle, however! If you will go up the stairs, I am certain you will find a fine warrior who is worthy to stand in your small, tiny shadow!’
The doll seemed to relax with that promise in mind, trusting his master’s words. The two of them stayed in the workshop and continued drawing and tinkering with tech till Jarvis reminded them that it was nearly midnight. ‘You do have a very important meeting tomorrow, sir. I would suggest that you get some rest.’
Anyway, hope you will enjoy!
Hope to see you again and have a marvelous day! :)
‘Will I also become a great warrior like you?’ Loki asked as he looked at the passing windows, watching their reflection.
‘Yeah?’ Both Peters replied simultaneously, looking at each other while raising a questioning brow.
‘… So this murder is solved,’ Fury said, making it sound more as a statement than a question. He looked at the blond, who pulled a doubtful face in response. ‘Or… not?’
The teen slowly looked up; amber eyes filled with fright staring straight at the genius. It was then that Tony’s eyes widened, the child’s face now uncovered. Short, brown, messy curls framed a pale face as his lips were pressed in a thin line. ‘Wait, I know who you are… You’re… Peter, right? Obie’s nephew?’ He frowned. ‘Why are you here? How did you even get here?’
‘Splendid, now has everyone got their sweets ready?’ Loki looked at the two Avengers at his side, all three of them holding the candy close to their lips.
Tony shivered at the breath ghosting down his neck, wanting nothing more but to throw the blond over his workbench and let his hands roam over his naked body. He turned around, every form of sinful lust disappearing as he looked straight into Steve’s tired, yet grateful face. ‘Hm?’
He's horrified and scared yes, but the truly terrifying part is, even
They sit - or in Steve’s case, lie - in silence for a while. Steve watches the slow lightening of the skies against the ceiling, and then of the slow creep of sunlight as the first golden rays break the horizon, casting shadows on the deckled surface. He breathes deep, calms down from the sort of argument. He’s trying not to take it personally, he knows he shouldn’t, but it’s a bit hard when someone just automatically assumes the worst of you, even if it’s not often. Steve likes to believe he’s been treating Tony well, but...maybe he’s just deluding himself.
"Don't." Tony snaps, whip crack sharp, and Steve shuts his mouth with a click. "I get it." His voice is horribly flat, and he flickers out of existence two seconds later.
Steve ends up in conversation with Peter, Ned and Harley after he talks a bit with Aunt May. It’s exceedingly interesting because Steve goes to shake Ned’s hand when Peter introduces him to Steve and Ned blurts out an awed, “Wow, you’re
"Steeeeeve."
, wait wait I take that all back - you’re
But then the villain does something, and Steve doesn't know what it is, he doesn't have the monitor, and all he has to go off of is the comms, everyone is too concentrated on the fight to explain, but whatever the villain does throws the Avengers for a loop. Steve listens, tense as the comms fill with swearing and terse orders from Sam. He starts pacing at the one minute mark, energy cooped up, itching to go join the fray, to go help out.
“Shellhead?”
Tony snaps out of his thoughts when the kid flicks him on the forehead.
that one was kinda logical if you think about it-”
He looks warm, Steve can’t help but think, as he reaches forward to brush away a strand of hair from the man’s forehead, drawing back quickly when a thin layer of frost builds over it. It fades as soon as Steve shrinks away, melting into drops of water in the dark strands.
. “A bit narcissistic don’t you think?”
In the days leading up to Tony's funeral, Steve came to admire just how strong Pepper truly is, business face on and spine as strong as steel, dealing with the aftermath and fallout when others were too broken to despite all that she had lost herself, making arrangements, taking care of Morgan, a hurricane of efficiency and productivity, comforting and strong in equal measure. There’s no denying that Tony married one hell of a woman. But he's glad she's getting her chance to truly mourn now that things have calmed.
“Sounds great,” Steve smiles, turning around and setting a plate of pancakes on the table. Agent Jin brings over the plates and toppings and sets the table. Tony squints at her.
“Goose.” is all she says, and Steve freezes, can feel his brain shutting down and rebooting.
“Maybe Bruce has already-”
“Steve.” and he falls silent. Tony looks at him sternly. “My objectives. My rules.”
“Leave me here.”
like I’m on the edge of death?” He asks, spreading his arms, ignoring the sharp tug of vines across his chest. “I will keep. Now
He pops the DVD into Steve’s computer, and then there’s just quiet and avid movie-watching until Morgan finally wakes up an hour and a half later, adorably sleepy and eager to get back to talking with Tony.
"Y'know," he says, sounding amused. "I have really no memories of you beyond your identity and a cursory knowledge based on what you’ve told me, but I keep wondering if you've always been such a little shit.” He flails his arms a bit, gesturing at Steve who watches him amusedly. “Because if you have, it feels like this should've been mentioned."
Steve snorts, but grabs Tony by the arm and pulls him up.
because
He pauses though when he gets to the report for the battle five days ago. Even now it unnerves him, the memory of that former Hydra agent. Because if there’s one of them still out there, how many more still remain, undiscovered?
The armour hits the boiling ground with a wet smack, and melts, along with the rest of the technology.
“You mentioned speculations or something, and...I wondered if there was something wrong with your systems because I was worried something was
“I used to resent you. Did you know that?” Tony asks after a moment. Steve blinks, not at all expecting that digression.
it is not your fault-”
“Good morning to you too, Jin.” Tony mutters. He’s really not in the mood. It’s too soon.
Steve’s mind doesn’t really register what he’s looking at at first; when it does, Steve feels an almost mortifying urge to laugh hysterically, because it’s a goddamned
, is that right,
There are days where Morgan will grow reserved, quiet and contemplative, nothing like the cheerful and bright kid she is usually. She’ll shut herself in her room and if Steve’s the one to go call her to eat he’ll sometimes find her sitting on her bed, staring at a photo album, quietly crying, and it’s those days where Steve truly feels his heart shatter, at his utter inability to help shield this little girl from the hurt of a parent who won’t ever return.
Tony shrugs, still staring blankly at the floor. His voice is flat when he talks. “Reassurance I guess. I overheard some of your conversation with Pepper.”
The mass is unrelentless, untiring, and after that little stint with Steve's staff, they've gathered that it’s probably some form of technology, reminds him of Tony’s nanotech suit now that he’s seen it up close, and the implications alone from that are horrifying, because if someone has managed to replicate it, the amount of damage that technology is already doing in the wrong hands…they'll need to deal with the implications eventually, but first they have to subdue this thing.
“You.” He directed this at Tony, who pointed at himself, mock surprised. “Don’t do anything. Just.”
“Well that’s the thing though. I’m not sure I want to.”
“It doesn't need to be a serious video, you could take a song and write an Avengers parody for all I care, people love that stuff.”
They meet in a dirt field set with different cobbled together obstacles, part of Pepper’s private property (and isn’t that alliteration if you’ve ever heard it), with Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, Morgan and Peter with their wives, Maria, Shuri, and Bruce on one side in order to even up the teams.
Tony sets to work and Steve heads off, the first time they’re separated since Tony had arrived.
Steve’s mouth twitches with amusement as he listens to Tony’s ranting. He re-applies the bandages slowly, the process taking a bit of fumbling, which again makes that horrible pinched look appear back on Tony’s face. Steve calls him Tin Can this time to distract him, and laughs as Tony flails his arms in concentrated offense.
And then promptly frowns.
“Are you ok with being on camera wearing your iron man undersuit?”
“I feel like Jarvis should be greatly offended at your lapse in memory.” Tony glances guiltily at his ceiling. Despite his protestations to the team that Jarvis does NOT live in the ceiling, he seems to have picked up their bad habit of talking to it nonetheless.
“Well, that was rude.” an amused voice comments.
“As you already know, Barnes here was sent out with the initial mission of tracking down what we previously thought was stolen nanotechnology in that first encounter during the call to assemble. ” Sam begins. “I went with him as backup.”
? Who
He is apparently the last person in the entire world to find out, via Clint when he lept out of one of the vents in the hallway, screaming about how the video is #1 on trending and scaring the ever loving crap out of Tony in the process.
Tony stares at Steve, and then down at the coffee cup. There’s a couple minutes of glaring.
“So.” Tara says, plonking herself next to Tony on the couch later that day.
Another subject kneels before him. They report what they will, and he watches them silently, pale blue eyes chilled to the core. He nods.
"No." He says. "You should leave."
There’s silence and Steve can tell Tony’s not convinced. He puts down the medicine tube and leans back against the counter.
He trails off, forlorn expression on his face and Steve refuses to let that look stay.
joke, it is done and over now, just no-”
At the same time though, Steve can almost feel the exhaustion weighing down Tony's frame, and that vaguely haunted look in his eyes; like he's been through a horrible ordeal. He just looks...hurt. There’s no other way to describe it.
Steve grins, heart aching gladly for them.
difficult is more like it. How the hell are you supposed to decide whether or not to tell a five year old child that her father has sort of, kind of, returned from the dead in the form of an artificial intelligence?
Tony hums in confirmation flipping absently through some of Bruce’s electronic notes.
"No. We don't." Steve walks into his room, stalking past Tony to his closet to grab a change of clothes.
Tony looks away at that, seeming embarrassed, and clears his throat awkwardly. “Not exactly,” he jokes, sounding kind of flustered. “I can’t own any real estate for one thing.”
As they all trickle back to the living room, Steve hangs back a bit, and watches them, this room of people he cares about, and the young and bright minds that are Earth’s future, all talking and laughing and alive, and he feels immeasurably warm and content, the darkness and grief farther from him than they’ve ever been in the many months after the battle.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Look kid, I’ve heard it all. Didn’t really think you had anything new to say.” He tilts a little on the uncomfortable plastic chair to look around the kid and nod at the death ray. “Nice machine though. I like the colour scheme.” The villain stares at him some more.
Steve laughs and pulls him inside the house.
He gets fed and watered, and then put to bed in that order, by mother-hen Captain America, who Tony has discovered is impossible to escape once he gets up to his mother-henning ways.
Steve gives them a grateful smile and heads to his room wearily after that, wanting to be left alone so he can rest, calm down from the high of the battle, sort through the guilt of letting Peter get hurt, but then he stops in his tracks when he opens the door to his room.
“Pepper, Happy and Clint have arrived.”
Steve freezes for a second, previously predicted disappointment and relief rolling over him in equal measure before he realizes that he doesn’t actually know what Tony entered him as. He knows that Tony has always had a liking for weird nicknames and references that Steve could never understand.
“He’s been awake for about 92 hours, having slept 4 hours in the last four days in 2 hour chunks. He hasn’t eaten a proper meal for the last day and half.” Agent Jin’s eyebrows shoot to her forehead.
“I will pay you a hundred dollars if you never utter the words “hip and cool kids” ever again in my presence.”
“That’s it,” he finally declares, after poking at one of the cling wrap toilets, “call in the reinforcements.” He says nodding solemnly at Bucky, who salutes with mock seriousness. “There is only one way to settle this.”
this time asshole” with stern orders not to be dumb(“oh you’re one to talk Rogers”) and watches them drive out of the hangar.
Steve finds him later out on the balcony during the wedding reception, and puts his arm around Tony’s waist, a line of warmth down Tony’s side in the cool night air.
“This is going to be epic.” Natasha concludes happily, and then starts jabbing them with sharp fingernails until they all get off the stairwell so they can tail Happy and Pepper.
And quite suddenly, Steve is impatient, so impatient to see everyone else, to see his kingdom and his people.
The crocuses run out, and when they do, Steve gathers all he has left and brings himself, vines and all, to the edge of his kingdom’s borders. It takes him multiple days of walking where it would have taken him only hours just half a century ago, because he has to stop every few hours and hack out petals and blood into the glittering snow. There are more flowers popping up in the fields, but Steve doesn’t have time to stop and make another potion.
Steve thinks of chilled gazes, rigid, frozen bodies as he ponders the man's question.
The itch to go out and do something doesn’t fade remotely throughout the duration of their impromptu The Office marathon, but Steve figures that if he’s not gonna be here keeping Sam and Bucky company, he’s only going to be in the gym destroying heavy bags from pent-up frustration, and in hindsight, both are equally useless in this situation, so he stays here and watches, and stays thoroughly distracted the entire time.
It seems like the respectful thing to do, cleaning up the place a bit, and Steve eventually manages to scrounge up an old broom and dustpan from an old cupboard in the back. He supposes it’s too much to ask for a bottle of Lysol, so he makes do with a towel he wets with the sink in the back of the lab to wipe down the tables.
wondering every single second how I’m lucky enough to have you love me back-”
“....ok, yes I was,
“Was this a situation caused by you two, or did something else happen?”
as Aaron Burr?”
“You don’t have to go to all that trouble for me Tony.” Peter says quietly after a moment.
Steve smiles at them sadly, reminded of Tony in the suits, an ordinary man transformed into something extraordinary by his own creation and genius, rising from his own ashes with his phoenix suit, all fire and flames.
“So,” Steve says, watching the two of them try and smack each other with a small smile. “How's the team doing?”
“Just for that little comment, you’re the one going to wrangle her when it comes time for her lessons.” Tony grumbles good naturedly to Steve as they start heading back to the castle. “‘Only works on your daddy’ huh. We’ll
What could have
“Change your code. You’re your own person, and I’m sure a genius like you could manage it. You deserve to live your own life Tony, not to be here running after someone who can’t even see what you’re worth, you don’t have to help out around the compound, don’t have to do anything you don’t want to just because of some pre-set objectives-”
More silence, the hesitant kind and then Tony answers.
“-but still you wouldn’t
They dig through an old armoury in the castle, and unearth a bunch of old shields, some rounded, some square. Steve picks up the one that has a white star in the middle, surrounded by blue and rings of red and white. Tony picks up a square one painted red and gold, and then drags them out the door to the nearest hill.
‘Oh, but my dearest captain,’ Tony smirked as his hands trailed down Steve’s cheeks to his shoulders, panting softly in the man’s ear as he whispered in a sultry voice, ‘you have no idea what I do when I’m alone.’
Loki’s smile widened till the point where Tony could count all his teeth. ‘Then I shall go and find this fine warrior. Thank you, Tony!’ he then opened his arms and wrapped them around the playboy’s neck in a hug. ‘You are the best,’ he whispered.
Steve took a deep breath, averting his eyes for a second. How he wanted to tell the kid that everything would be okay. How he wanted to tell him it was all a big mistake and that they would be just fine.
‘Well, I don’t think the movie ever really said anything about Beast’s name…’ Peter said as he continued to walk, ‘just try “Steve” okay?’ The two entered a room which seemed like what once was the kitchen. The still dripping pipelines were rusted, dust falling from the ceiling, the old floorboard squeaking underneath their feet as they stepped through the room, slowly, cautiously.
‘Hmm, no, it’s been enough for today,’ Steve concluded as he looked at the clock, noticing that it was already past seven. ‘I’m going home. Good job today guys, see you all tomorrow.’
‘-But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?’ Rhodey said as he was in the middle of his story.
Loki moved towards the stranger without a sound, standing next to him and trying to understand the man’s scribbles and calculations. ‘Hi.’
‘Good,’ Tony clasped his hands together, trying to shrug this haunting feeling of guilt. ‘Jarvis will tell you what to do when you’re done, so, no worries there.’ He quickly turned around and closed the door as the bathroom was slowly filling with steam, only later realizing that the doll had no idea who or what Jarvis was.
‘Sure is kid,’ Quill laughed. ‘They’re American, so everything’s Xtreme and Super!’ he then looked over at Steve, who met his gaze with a gentle and rather ignorant smile. ‘Except for Captain America himself, that is. He’s quite the opposite, which, I think, is actually really funny and ironic.’
Tony frowned before letting out a deep sigh and rubbed the bridge of his nose. ‘Care to explain?’
A silence filled the room at which the two just stared at each other. Loki’s eyes slightly squinted as he held on to the captain’s shirt, hiding behind the man, while Peter’s eyes were large in complete disbelief.
‘We’re still not really sure on that,’ Tony mumbled as he admired the art decorating the rooms they passed. The mansion was just as impressive on the inside as it was on the outside. ‘Why do you ask? You think someone murdered him?’
‘What…?’ Loki almost whispered, fear instantly shadowing those emerald eyes. ‘T-Thor, I swear I didn’t-’
‘He’s my younger brother, turned sixteen last week. I would appreciate it if you would leave him alone.’ The blond’s voice was low, making his sentence sound more like a threat than a favor.
Loki followed Peter through the halls of the compound, in the meantime scanning his surroundings. He was grateful for the teen to accompany him, for he found out soon enough that, without anyone to help him guide through the building, he would be helplessly lost within a minute.
Such as:
‘I am Tony Stark, duh!’ Peter chuckled. ‘My dad even made me a gauntlet to wear, though it can’t really shoot anything… It does work as a flash light though.’
‘Are you not having fun, brother?’ Loki turned around and smiled. ‘Try to raise your arms, like this!’ The small trickster waved his hands in the air, feeling the breeze run through his fingers as Quill took another rapid turn.
Tony smiled and pressed a gentle kiss against Steve’s soft, soft lips. ‘That’s what you want, isn’t that right doll?’
With a nod of his head Steve went over the young woman, Tony right at his side. ‘Miss Maximoff?’ he asked gently at which the woman stood up. ‘I’m Steve Rogers, Criminal Investigation Department, this is my colleague Tony Stark. I heard you found the body?’
‘Yes or no?’ Tony continued, his voice matching that of his partner. ‘It’s a very easy question.’
‘What?!’ Thor shouted in outrage while the other Avengers could not help but laugh loudly.
‘Well, no, I mean, it was Bruce and Tony who designed me but,’
I’d been scarred enough as a kid, finding May and Ben in the shower together. I didn’t want to go through that again.
And everything faded to grey.
He came in one day with a grilled cheese and a mug of hot chocolate, and pulled up the chair from my desk, sitting down next to my bed.
“What are you doing up so late?”
“His mother figure just died, we don’t need to remind him of that!”
A sob wracked my body. And then another, and another, and I let myself curl up on the ground, crying hard, wishing May were here to hug me and stroke my hair and make it all better.
There was a weird…tension in the room, the whole movie. I was sitting between them on the couch, and they kept glancing at each other over me, acting like they were checking on me if the other caught their gaze.
“As long as you remember.”
“Hey, honey, kid, took you long enough to say the magic words.”
The rest of my classes had to do with business or engineering, since Mr. Stark and I had talked about me taking over Stark Industries before the Snap, and it was in his will that I had full entitlement to his position, when I was done school. Big shoes to fill. The biggest.
I looked over at him and forced a small smile. “I know,” I breathed, scared to speak at a normal volume in case my voice broke.
“Peterrrr, Papa made food and I want you to come eat with me.”
“What? Why? Is something wrong?”
“I actually really like
Mr. Stark looked down, then back at me. I’d never seen him nervous before, let alone genuinely insecure. “Do I? Is it too much?”
“Don’t worry about it, kid. Cry all over it if you have to. It’s just fabric.”
It had been three weeks and four days since May had passed away. Six months, two weeks since the doctors told her she wouldn’t make it to see me off to college.
“I forgot for a minute,” she whispered, a tear falling down her cheek. I pulled my sleeve over my thumb and wiped it away. “I miss him.”
After the funeral, we went upstate, back to the compound. I sat in the back, next to Mr. Stark, staring out the window, feeling numb.
“I hate you when you’re right.”
“Peter, we’re on the highway, of course not. That would be irresponsible.”
When we got home, to the cabin, Morgan wanted some time alone in her tent. Happy went back to the compound to deal with some business. Mr. Rogers and I sat on the porch in silence.
I saw Mr. Rogers, holding Mr. Thor’s hammer, beating the living hell out of Thanos.
“Yeah,” I laughed.
“Sorry, kid, I didn’t realize you were here.”
He nodded. “You know Tony. All about the dramatics. Big gestures. All of that.”
“Did you- did you bet on whether I’d ask Steve out?” Mr. Stark asked, appalled.
“I haven’t asked someone out in years, Hap. I don’t even know where to start.”
Morgan seemed to realize what was going on, and teared up.
“Then maybe you’ve earned yourself some slack.”
“Yeah, go ahead.”
The two looked at each other, and then just kind of shrugged and set up the movie.
“I’m-I’m okay, I guess. As okay as you can be when you’ve lost what’s left of your family.”
“Nothing is wrong. Their date went well. Very well.”
I took a deep, shaky breath. “I saw him steal the infinity stones from Thanos. I tried to make it in time, to-to steal the gauntlet and snap myself or to hold his hand ma-maybe and spread out the force so he didn’t have to take it all. But I wasn’t fast enough.”
The apartment seemed cold when I walked in. I didn’t bother turning the lights on, or bringing the backpack all the way to my room. I set it down next to the front door and went to the kitchen, opening the fridge.
“Pretty bad.”
Mr. Stark and Happy seemed to take shifts, bringing me glasses of water or small snacks and trying to coax me into eating more. I just couldn’t bring myself to get up and face the world, or at least the Avengers. I knew FRIDAY was sending reports of my vitals and behavior to Mr. Stark, trying to gauge if I was improving or worsening.
Getting out of the shower, I toweled off with maybe the fluffiest towel I’d ever touched, and then got dressed and headed out to the living room.
I finished my sandwich and the sat in bed for a bit, wondering if I should get up and go watch the movie, or if I should just call it a night and go back to sleep.
For a moment, I smiled to myself, imagining May commenting on exactly how much pent up chemistry Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers really had.
“Yeah, sort of.”
“I know, kid. But you’re way off base. I mean, he’s still pining over one of the founders of SHIELD who died a few years back and Pepper and I just broke up. Not to mention, you know, we’ve got a whole rival dynamic.”
“Hey, hey hey hey, it’s okay,” I said, swooping in and picking her up. I set her down on some free counter space.
Just like that.
“So why can’t I- oh.”
He stayed with me while I ate, and we chatted idly. He wouldn’t admit it, but he only stayed to make sure I finished my grilled cheese.
I turned around, surprised. “H-hey, Steve.”
It wasn’t a secret that they were more there for me than May.
That earned me a smile. “Thanks, kid.”
I scrambled, trying to make it in time. I don’t know what my plan was, whether I was going to hold his hand and share the power, or if I was going to take the gauntlet and snap myself. I had superpowers, he didn’t. He couldn’t survive it.
“Hey, can I tell you a secret?”
“Um, what’s cooking?” I asked, trying to change the subject.
When May got sick, I didn’t think about the possibility that she wouldn’t get better. She had to get better, right? The universe couldn’t be cruel enough to take away the last bit of family that I had. It couldn’t be cruel enough to take away the woman who’d become my mom.
than you used to be,” I said to Mr. Stark, once Mr. Rogers was well out of the room.
“I missed so much. I missed you guys getting married and-and adopting Morgan. I missed her first steps and first words. I missed Mr. Stark and I working on a million projects we had sketches and ideas for. And I got back and he hugged me and I thought it’d go back to normal and we could still work on all of those projects and I could keep my dad, but-but…I couldn’t save him.”
Between you and me, I shed a few tears during that hug.
Not that I did a lot of walking to the kitchen for the first week or two after the funeral. I spent most of my time in bed, facing buried in a pillow, feeling utterly empty.
She smiled, despite the wetness on her cheeks. “But now you have us!”
“Maybe? Well, I mean, yes, but I don’t wanna jinx it or ruin anything, you know?”
“We didn’t know if you were coming back, Queens,” he said, after a good ten minutes.
The next few weeks, things were fun around the compound. The two were in the honeymoon phase, and everything was cute and lovely. Everyone was happy.
She turned to me, brown eyes wide and sparkly. “You’re my big brother?”
There was a long pause as Steve let me cry for a minute.
And then he was gone.
I stared at Steve for a moment. “All of that over some water on a picture?”
“Hey, slowpoke,” MJ greeted, not bothering to glance up from her laptop.
Both of them turned to look at me.
“May wasn’t technically blood,” I pointed out. “But yeah, I see your point.”
Thor’s intense blue eyes shifted from Tony towards the blond, cold and unforgiving. ‘If he would have done that,’ he started, his voice a low growl, ‘then I would have met the two of you half a year ago. For I would have killed him if he even dared to point a finger at Loki.’ He took a deep breath, ‘but he did not. He never contacted Loki.’
Tony felt Steve’s eyes burning in his back. He shot a quick glance at the doll, guilt crushing his chest as it held its breath in anticipation of his reaction. ‘… Of course I do,’ Tony muttered. He downed the bourbon with one big gulp and placed the empty glass back on the tray. He didn’t dare to look at Steve again. ‘So, what now?’
The god of thunder looked at his body which indeed seemed to be emitting a warm and soft glow. He then looked at Loki, a worried expression on his face. ‘Brother, you… Your eyes, they are turning grey.’
The group fell silent for a moment, Tony being the first to open his mouth, ‘So that girl finally dared to speak and then…’
