Before the Avengers, he never worried about hiding it from anyone. No one questioned why he drank so much on this particular date. They all assumed it was a part of his usual bad, drinking habits and no one, not even Pepper, noticed one of his bad nights always occurred annually.
Tony could do the same.
“Mr. Stark is clearly upset and with good reason,” one of Tony’s lawyers cut in before anymore words could be said. She stepped between Tony and the detectives and continued with a frown, “He is not threatening this department but reacting to distress after he and his
Wade had taken him to the med team and they quickly put Peter under and that pain went away for a little. In its place, was a timeless darkness where time had no meaning.
“So are you,” Steve whispered and leaned forward to kiss him.
Bucky rolled his eyes and murmured, “I’m heard enough of their fucking in one lifetime. I don’t need to hear no more if I can help it.”
Steve ripped himself from Tony’s hold and barreled straight into the fight. Steve grabbed one of Hulk’s fists, his arm was nearly the same size as Steve, and yelled,” HULK! Hulk stop! That thing is Peter! Peter’s in there! You could hurt him! HULK!”
“We are but it would seem odd if my lawyers floundered, not knowing what to do when this gets out. They need to look prepared like they always knew we were together…plus they’re not going to keep their mouths shut about this, it’s too juicy. They’ll talk about it with their spouses or family who will in turn talk about it with others…”
His experiment and any inkling of talking to Bruce or Vision about it was finally lost as he was immersed in Wade’s story. The background worries about his parents and Wade were stronger than those of the mix-up in his experiment.
“It was ages ago, Barton,” Natasha replied. “It was cover for a mission not for pleasure.”
“Steve, I can totally see them together! Can’t you? They can be the next Brangelina, I’ll call them Natucky…no, that sounds like a state. How about Buctasha?! No, that sounds like a weird elk…What if we combine their codenames…Winterwidow…Wow, it’s almost poetic! We’re calling this Project Winterwidow! It sounds perfect!”
In a few days, they would return to the Tower and continue to make love and simply love each other. When Tony first started SI Online, it was out of his impatience to meet his soulmate but, now that he had him, he couldn’t wait to live out the rest of their lives. He wanted everything with Steve and he gave him that and
“I can’t remember anything else other than fighting the mind wipe,” Bucky hissed, clutching his head again as if squeezing his skull could pump out his veiled memories. He ground his teeth in frustration.
The flash drive did not lead them to Nazi zombies, but, it did lead them into the Nazi/Hydra equivalent of Skynet which Tony thought was pretty awesome. Until Zola, a Terminator-wannabe, tried to kill them. But then again, the 90s-animated supercomputer lived up to its super villain persona and told them its evil plan before trying to kill them.
“I’m not glaring,” Tony retorted, “Just staring.”
“Oh, thank God,” Tony gasped and went straight to the elevator.
Bucky lifted his head and looked to him. He smirked and said, “Well aren’t we two peas in a pod, tiptoeing around each other, trying not to hurt the other when all along we are trying to tell the other the same thing…”
By the time Eddie got there, Peter had gone through most of the textbook and relived the class he took the year prior with a professor who kept calling him Peter Porker.
Tony pushed himself up and his muscles all screamed at the action after being in one position so long but he ignored the pain in favor of action.
“Outside, running on the track.”
Steve settled deeper into his pillows and said, “Well you are a child at heart…”
He was never going to let someone die for him again.
Steve heard him but his mind could not process his words. He did not believe him and gasped, “S-show me a newspaper, something with a date on it!”
“Yes, sir,” Jarvis said, his voice fading as he did.
Tony couldn't help his father.
They walked in silence, traversing their own path through the thicket and over rocks and roots. When the sound of camp was just a distant murmur, Steve bumped into Tony's side.
“To the best of my abilities,” Bruce replied, gripping the table tightly. Scott nodded and wordlessly ran out of the room. Bruce explained, “Scott has a portable battery with high voltages in his lab.”
movies?”
Bucky had been trying to get Steve to go on a double date with him. The lady he was with, had a friend who was looking for a guy for them to double date with. Steve usually said no but Bucky pushed. His other girl lost her soulmate. She was zeroed like them. Steve could really start something with her.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony grinned and pulled Steve into another mouthwatering kiss. Steve’s heart beat faster.
They smiled down at the photo with a sense of accomplishment and wonder.
Grinning triumphantly, Pepper stated, “We can prepare the press statements and have them released while they are at the party.” Turning to Coulson, she said, “We can also schedule interviews with the major news conglomerates so they will not be overly accosted when they leave! We can control this, Phil, and Steve will be safe in the Tower. It’s the safest building in New York.”
treachery did not happen.
“Last we saw, yes, but we have no idea where’d he go. Just in case he turns up on the next news cycle, I need you to be prepared to keep Barnes locked down on your property until Rogers is secured, alright?...Stark, where are you go-?....Stark, are you there?....
Happy with the state of his fingers, Pepper let him go and then said, “All the cleaning products are kept over here.” Bucky wordlessly followed her and Tony covered the growing smile on his face upon seeing Bucky’s perplexed expression.
Vision nodded, his way of saying you’re welcome and then he rose into the air cradling the orb in both hands. They watched him until he phased through the wall and disappeared. Tony watched the spot for a few extended seconds, just to make sure Vision and his cargo were gone. When the android did not reappear, Tony turned to Steve and asked, “Have you seen any of the
They’d parted late into the night and Wade had kissed him goodbye so sweetly that Peter was tempted to stay. But he left, Happy was waiting for him and eventually drove him home.
As he thought on it, the idea became more appealing. He could take Venom under his wing and explore the limit of his powers together. And with his intelligence, he would be like the son he always wanted. No one would be able to stand up to their combined greatness.
Peter raised his arms over his head and wound them behind Wade’s neck, pressing their bodies closely together. He pulled Wade’s head forward and huskily whispered into his ear, “Jello Prince more like it.”
Tony placed his hand on Steve’s thigh and the words dwindled in his throat as he stared at his friend’s voracious gaze. Steve instantly felt caught by it and gulped.
Everything was moving smoothly and Steve let himself relax.
Peter grabbed his phone and added Wade’s number. After a moment’s hesitation, he sent Wade a spider web and a winky face emoji.
“Hello?” Steve whispered.
“Round two of testing,” he announced and then flicked the paperclip. It bounced off Peter’s nose and their experiment didn’t so much as twitch.
Tony snorted into his coffee and Bucky just threw back his head and laughed heartily. It was a normal laugh to Steve but the other two froze like it was a miracle.
Tony laughed at himself and replied, “Yeah, just letting my imagination get the best of me.”
Tony turned to their friend and found him leaning against Natasha, smirking at them with his trademark cocky grin.
“Tony…when I was with Schmidt I did a lot of thinking about us,” Steve murmured a little self-consciously. With a flush, he looked down at his lap and played a little with the edge of his blanket. “…I realized we never discussed our future.”
They both stared at the fire and lost themselves to their own dark thoughts.
His heart began to hammer in his chest as he heard May’s light footsteps cross her rickety wood flooring. She opened the door with a smile that fell almost as soon as her eyes took him in.
Tony finally grumbled, “What?”
But he didn’t like denying she was his mom. It didn’t feel right.
Despite knowing it was a dream, he checked Tony over as he lay next to him. Tony silently watched him with tired eyes as Steve lightly ran his hands over him. He eventually grasped Steve’s hand halting his worried checkup.
Tony Stark was his father.
“I’ll go to him,” Peggy gasped, sounding like she was fighting tears.
“Oh Bucky, you did not have to!” Steve gasped. Bucky gone out for the first time last week by himself. Steve had assumed that he was ready but he must have gotten Peter something. It must have been nerve-wracking to him.
Clint nodded and replied, “Meet up two blocks north of here in thirty?”
Even as he unraveled, Tony’s gaze never broke from his and always burned with unwavering love. Steve hoped his eyes also conveyed the undying devotion he had for the man as he stared back.
“They’re very clean animals,” Tony retorted smartly, rocking Peter a little. He murmured to his son, “I think your dad is teasing me, Peter…”
In a flash of light, Bucky was gone.
Tony whispered, “I was ashamed…It was years before you, years, before the Avengers, years before I became sober…I was an alcoholic, party boy, and I liked a challenge. When… W-When I caught the eye of my cousin’s wife I jumped right on it.”
But it was no longer a matter of “if” in Peter’s mind…It was only a matter of “when.”
Wade lightly touched his cheek and fearfully whispered, “Baby boy? You okay? Please be okay!”
Steve smiled bitterly at the other man and replied, “It’s nice to meet you too.”
“We are one,” Venom reminded him and he felt an internal shudder from his host. The boy no longer objected and it made the symbiote smile.
Bruce’s expression wavered and he grasped his arm tightly. He whispered, “I’ll ask your doctors if we could move you to a wheelchair…but please…until I get back, just wait here. I will be right back!”
Coulson repressed the need to roll his eyes. Instead, he sparred one last glance to the sketch rolled in Stark’s hands. Another piece of the Captain so close but too far from his grasp again…
Bucky regarded him curiously and stated, “From what I remember, you are the exact opposite of selfish…”
“Yeah, she died when I was a baby. Hydra killed her,” Peter explained.
“The Peter I know wouldn’t brush aside his relationship with his father so easily for an easy fling,” Wade stated the fact that had been festering in the back of his mind.
“Did…Did you two have a nice talk? Uh, was the coffee good?” Tony asked awkwardly. "You two had coffee, right? It's like your thing."
When the man spotted him, he stumbled over his feet in his jogging. He came to a stop and, despite the hat and glasses, Tony could see the war in his expression as he probably considered whether or not he should run.
Tony stood up straight and gasped, “He’s coming here??
“Steve, don’t make me look into this because if it involves me I am going to kick all of your asses.”
Steve chuckled and helped him remove his shirt and then he helped Tony out of his own. Once they were both bare chested, they irrevocably were drawn back to each other. Tony wrapped his arms behind Steve’s head and drew him into a giggling kiss. They only broke apart once the elevator reached its destination.
The blue glow was leaking through the loose shirt he’d slept in. Bucky nodded in agreement and Tony motioned to the new bandages Gabe had left on top of one of Howard’s bags. Tony wordlessly took off his shirt and Bucky couldn’t help but stare at the lines webbing across his skin.
“I’m sorry but if you just witnessed what I did then you would be on the same page,” Clint gasped. He slid past Tony and said, “I have to find her.”
,” Steve cried, scratching at the mass on his son’s face. It covered Peter’s face, and it looked more like Steve was standing in a mass of lumpy tar than with his son. The mass fell from his hands and he could almost make out his son’s form laying at his feet. Steve surged down and screamed, “
The darkness was the last thing on his mind now and he felt around the bed for the bottle of lube…and felt…and felt. Eventually, he broke their kiss with a groan and sat up, asking, “Where’d we put it?”
“Great, I’ll take care of that after I figure out what the hell just happened!” Tony exclaimed. “Open up! We need to find Steve!”
“What am I, a child??” Peter demanded, “What’s with the parental control? Why can’t I go on the internet??”
His agents cleared out of the room until only Stark and Fury remained.
Steve took a step toward him as if to stop him but Tony was already gone and Steve was reaching out to open air. His heart twisted painfully in his chest and he drew his hand back to his side.
“I loved Bucky,” Steve retorted, his voice giving a little on the end. It was the first time he had voiced it aloud. He had admitted it to himself only just recently. He had tried to deny it like his sexuality.
“Tony, Natasha attacked him for complementing her eyes. What do you think she will do if he tried to kiss her!?” Steve gasped and Bucky grunted in agreement.
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis replied.
“Sir?” Jarvis intoned, stepping toward them with a concerned hunch to its shoulders.
“You know as well as I do that I need to go,” Steve whispered.
But as soon as his eyes fell on Tony’s smiling face, all his worries slipped away.
“And you know I’m a battle tactician who comes up with five different things that could go wrong on the spot! We’re not one hundred percent that we hadn’t changed the future too…”
“That sounds like the sigh of a man with a heavy burden,” a deep voice grumbled.
In less than a minute, Bruce found the solution, cleaned both Tony’s arm and the needle with an alcohol swab, and had the drug pumping back into him. As the morphine did its work, Tony’s face relaxed and he released another pent up sigh.
Tony guardedly asked, “Join me? I don’t think I can stand much longer.”
“I know Stevie don't need it. You telling me you –?”
And then…
century, he would have never dared to even imagine this happening. Now he felt like he was stepping into some sort of fantastical dream.
to see my son,” Steve stated.
“We’ll just put it back into Mac’s fridge,” Eddie sighed. He picked up the beaker but, when it was only an inch off the counter, its entire surface bubbled. Eddie hurriedly put it back down and the beaker thrummed as it vibrated from the bubbly reaction.
Steve flushed and gulped then nodded.
Tony inhaled sharply, his nostrils expanding, and gasped, “Steve. You’re a wet dream.”
What just happened?
After their make out session, they leaned back into the pillows and each other as they looked through the photos.
Tony smiled gratefully at the super soldier.
Steve smiled and murmured, “Oh, you know him, he worried and fretted and muttered dark things under his breath…”
“So we time traveled again,” Tony jumped right in, leaning into Steve’s side like he had done several weeks before. Tony continued, “Haven’t gotten married yet though. Well, we went to the future so we did get married then, our future selves, not us. Don’t worry, you’re invited to the wedding, Eyepatch, we couldn’t do it without you!”
Steve calmed him down…he seemed the only one able to.
“I know one thing at least,” his dad eventually grumbled as they evacuated the last of the personal from the room.
Steve’s fingers found their mark and Tony sat up sharper and squeaked, “Pep! Steve and I need a moment to let things sink in!”
But it also no longer read: MK 15.
!” Tony hissed, his head snapping back up. He glared at Steve with such an intensity that it made Steve wince.
Harold gasped, “
“Tony, those things are still coming!” Steve yelled. They had no time for his usual sarcasm!
James grasped her hand on his chest and vehemently whispered, “
Steve shooed them all away from the grill so he could finish up there. Peter pulled Wade over to the table and sat him down playfully murmuring, “Behave.”
“…I’m going to die,” Tony stated bluntly.
Since leaving the forest, Tony felt like he was fighting a magnetic pull. His every move was sluggish as he had a constant need to look at or be near Steve.
Tony smiled at Steve’s words and then carded his fingers into both of Steve’s hands. Steve turned back to him as he did. His warm smile was still in place but his gaze warmed all the more as his eyes came into contact with Tony's.
“I-I just dreamed that I hadn’t gotten away,” Peter quietly explained. He tried to discreetly wipe his face and Tony clenched his fists tighter. Peter lifted his gaze and smiled reassuringly at all of them. He murmured, “Thanks guys…I’m fine now.”
Natasha stood up sharply and hissed, “That is the last thing we will do.”
Venom moved against Peter’s skin with a small shudder when Tony’s face pressed against it. His dad didn’t seem to notice it as he smiled warmly at Peter and clapped his shoulder.
With every move of joint or muscle, the metal plates of his arm shifted to accommodate the change like a rippling of water.
Steve waited outside Howard’s tent and jumped on the man as soon as he stepped out. Howard raised a finger to his lips, indicating to be quiet. Steve kept his mouth shut in a thin line and followed Howard stiffly as he walked away from the tent.
Tony was glad to be able to banter with Steve again and glad they can still share in their friendship.
“So I am a man with a target on his head and my family are going to be collateral damage?” Howard hissed.
A list of websites appeared, his Wikipedia being the first, followed by his company, and then various news articles…but Steve’s eyes were drawn to the tiny boxes with Tony’s picture, prompting him to see more if he hit the images tab.
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and groaned when his lover bit into the flesh of his shoulder. Steve, always thinking of his needs first, assaulted his flesh with playful nips and a lavishing tongue. Steve was a virgin when they first made love but he was a fast learner and already knew the majority of Tony’s sweet spots.
“You’re alive, Buck,” Steve gasped. “You’re – You’re alive.”
It’d also be a great way to avoid traffic and pesky reporters.
The other Avengers called out quick greetings but, once they all had their say, his dad butted in and announced, “Pete, you should conveniently join us. Friday can direct you to our location.”
“Yes,” Tony whispered. His hazel eyes were searching his, worried and anxious about Steve could only guess why. “I love yo-.”
How many more times would he be forced to watch his soulmate get badly hurt or  almost die?
Tony somehow found him and lay in wait.
Before he or Tony could make any introductions Ben suddenly spoke up.
Tony glanced up and raised a single eyebrow, past the rim of his goggles, as he asked, “Are you hinting that I should be doing the same?”
“You…You did not know,” Peter whispered, his voice was barely audible to Tony.
. How could Peter or anyone else not know he was Tony’s son?! He was a dead ringer for him!
Thor had flown in and landed on the balcony outside the community room. Just as Jarvis informed them of his arrival, Thor came in, took one look at Peter, and went straight to Steve, picking him right off the couch.
“What do you remember?” Steve asked in a whisper. He was afraid to raise his voice any higher, in case of enticing Bucky again.
Ultron dropped the mangled car and caught Peter before he fell too. The robot's hold felt colder than the snow melting against Peter's skin.
Tony and Steve shuffled over to the front door, putting on their hats and glasses to hide their identities from the general public.
Tony pressed his nose into the dip of Steve’s pectorals.
The caretaker had a long raincoat hanging on the opposite wall.
Wade kept his mouth sealed shut when he was near Stark… or should he call him Mr. Stark? He definitely wouldn’t want Wade to call him “Dad”…
Thanks for reading!
want to know how physical Tony and I are?”
The team was already on the surface, but Tony was older and knew the fragility to his body oh too well.
“According to the last brain scans, Sir will be unconscious in 2.6 minutes,” Jarvis replied immediately. “Whatever hit Sir had compromised the suit, letting in water, and fractured a few ribs.”
Steve knew the first step to accepting himself was to stop lying…and he wanted to stop lying to his friends first.
Hulk roared, making Steve flinch but also making Tony’s eyes snap open.
Natasha threw the box at Steve and he caught it. Natasha stepped away, saying, “Next time don’t mess with me, Stark.” She came to a stop in front of Bucky and said, “You. Me. Training room. I’ll show you the merits of rushing into something. Mainly, your face rushing into my fist.”
Steve’s eyes flickered open and his eyelashes tickled Tony’s skin. His arms slid behind Tony’s back and he returned the embrace with a happy grin. He peered up at Tony and leaned against his chest, settling into him.
She ran forward and he was close behind with that near-smile back on his face.
He told Tony, Wade was his boyfriend. Tony knew Wade wasn’t just some fling to Peter. Peter would
“I see Mary in him,” May whispered in a broken voice. Tears were gathering in her eyes and Ben’s eyes were beginning to glisten too.
Tony laughed and Steve smiled sweetly at him. He murmured, “I love your laugh.”
With that, Wade went to the glass doors leading outside, leaving Steve and Tony behind without another word. Tony and Steve exchanged bewildered glances. Tony crossed his arms and demanded, “Friday?”
“Nope! The robot says I retain a full head of hair in my later years!” Bucky proudly retorted, slicking back his hair with a grin.
Tony frowned at the hologram and groaned, “The man looks more like a dorrito than Chewbacca! Run a facial recognition on both of them, J, and, if they come back, inform my employees that I want to speak to them immediately!”
This could be his solution to protecting Spidey’s identity.
“What if they order him to reveal me to the media?”
Tony lifted Steve’s chin and Steve peered up at him with glassy eyes. God, he loved him so much. Why couldn’t -?
In time, he came to an evident conclusion.
She grinned manically at Steve and gasped, “Now we can be together forever.”
by what you did, but I think what you did was good. Bruce is a nice guy.”
Steve never ventured away from the wall.
Thor landed softly beside him and stated, “There has been no movement since your transport has landed. If we are surrounded, they are not making themselves obvious.”
For the next few days, Tony wanted to relive Steve's glory days. They reenacted scenes from his past or constructed entirely new ones. The dreamscape reflected the forests of France, Italy, or Germany and they created giant shadowy figurines that stood in place for Hydra agents or the Howling Commandos. Tony had the time of his life and Steve would catch the boy smiling at him with sparkling eyes.
“You’ve met him?” Tony murmured in surprise.
He paused when he noticed the furrow between Steve’s eyebrows.
Tony murmured, “It was a dream, Steve. C’mere.” He pulled Steve into an embrace and sighed contently when Steve lay his head on Tony’s chest. “No boogeyman is gonna pull me out of your arms,” Tony promised. “No one is strong enough to pull me away from you, super soldier. You’re stuck with me for life.”
“No, it was traumatic and you’re still healing,” Steve pressed, drawing Tony into a tighter embrace. Tony nestled his head under Steve’s chin and Steve continued, “I can’t control when I leave the dream world but we can control when I enter it. We can have me fall asleep first until you get used to the darkness.”
Steve flushed at the name and said, “Don’t call me that.”
An excited thrill ran through him…he was excited too.
The next day everything was…normal. Tony was a little shocked how easily it all was. The only clue to the fact that they had gotten married were the rings on their fingers.
It was another thing Steve was going to have to add to his list of ever growing problems. Feeding his boyfriend while on the run.
Wade let go of him with a pop and murmured, “Happy birthday, baby boy.”
“This century’s views are swayed by media opinion. If the overall media think you two are fake, then the rest of the world will too. And you two don’t want to try to live in a world that thinks your entire relationship is a sham especially since you’ll both undoubtedly be pubic figures. We need to be careful about this, especially once they find out who Steve really is.”
Both boys turned to them sharply upon their entering the lab.
The gates began to open and Steve wetly chuckled, “It’s good to hear you, Jarvis, is Tony – is Tony, okay?”
Pepper physically turned him and commanded, “Shower. Now.”
The Commandos warmed up to him instantly and he fused into their group as easily as a nuclear reaction. Daily, the team would split into groups of three and patrol the woods along the perimeter of the base and Tony was immediately included in the endeavor. He got to know each member personally as they strolled through the abandoned woods. They were all chipper, funny, and so young. Tony enjoyed getting to know them, or, in the case of Dum Dum and Aunt Peggy, learning knew quirks to their younger natures. The men he had grown up idolizing were very human but it made Tony think all the greater of them.
Tony walked over to his main worktable and deposited the remains of the toys on its already cluttered surface.
No matter his age, he was not in a celebrating mood and neither was Solo.
Tony’s faceplate rose, revealing an uneasy expression. He hissed, “The suit disconnected as soon as we landed.
Tony squeezed back and murmured, “I love both of you too…”
Tony held him tightly and frantically whispered, “You can make it through this,
Steve’s brows shot together in a tight pinch and he bit down on his tongue, already wanting to speak out.
“My host will not bond. The foolish boy refuses to eat. You created me. Now you will help me or I will devour your son.”
“What’s with you two and the obsession with my chest? Do you two find that most attractive in a man or something?
“Are you beginning to feel it? That empty feeling?” The Red Skull asked as he leaned over him closely. “That entity that is yourself, your very soul, can you feel it breaking yet?”
“Of course not, more sleep for me!” Steve joked, drawing a small smile to Tony’s lips.
When Tony was returning to his seat and Steve took his place in the witness box, they reached out to each other and their fingertips brushed in passing. A shadow of Tony’s touch remained on his skin and Steve clenched his fist as if to hold the invisible hand that was there.
He kept his hands on the young man he was helping out of the rubble but his head shot up and focused on the person who had asked him the question a few feet away.
“I am late,” Peter stated. “I need to get back before my dad sends the Avengers out looking for me. Your kisses and reactions are just
To those of you I told I was posting it on Friday, SORRY! I had no time to edit it as I got home late last night and I had to work this morning! BUT here it is and it's July 4th so happy birthday America and Steve Rogers! :3
“Pepper?!” He gasped, alarmed by her illuminating change.
Gary laughed and handed Steve his coffee. Gary said, “That’s great! I knew you’d get through this! When I first heard about it on the news, I knew it couldn’t be true!”
creepy tendrils move around his boyfriend and he asked, “Birthday? Who’s getting another year older?”
“Holy shit, ohhh, yes, this is very good,” Tony gasped in a rush. “Yep, continue, Cap -
Pepper turned on her heel and she sported a similar flush to her cheeks as Steve. She focused her frown on Tony and Tony smirked as he stated, “Alright, why did you feel the need to use an override code to speak to me, Pep?”
“I think if he wanted one of us dead, we would be,” Tony told him. “Everything I have seen on the Winter Soldier shows that his shots never miss their target.”
Tony’s heart clenched as he remembered Peter’s statement last night. Peter
Steve unload the fridge of all the needed supplies and covered the counter in lunch meats, bread, lettuce, and other much needed condiments. He was putting together a turkey sandwich, obviously for Peter as it was his favorite, when he paused and suddenly stared intensely at Peter.
When Peter went back to the VIP rooms, everyone was there and his dad embraced him.
Tony was holding an internal debate inside his head.
James came in and draped the lab coat over Steve. He kneeled in front of Steve and stated, “Hey, it’s me…it’s-it’s Bucky.”
Steve tightened his hold on her hand and heard the gears beneath the artificial skin moan with distress. Mary smirked grimly and Steve commanded, “Jarvis, stop the noise.”
As Tony upgraded his armor, Steve was usually sharing a workbench with him or sitting on the couch.
“Security Code 14.75 is when Avengers are fighting!”
Steve’s shoulders slumped and his eyes got big and glassy like a sad puppy. It took all of Tony’s willpower not to hug him. Instead, he clasped his shoulder and promised, “She is not going to get away with this! It’s going to get nasty. People are going to look at you differently. But know that me and the rest of the Avengers know the truth and we’re going to be with you throughout it! Better yet, I come with a pack of lawyers who are going to tear this woman apart!”
Thank you for reading! I am back after a long break! I am going to try responding to all of the comments I've missed while I was gone but, moving forward, I'll be posting to this new fic every weekend. Till next time! :)
He knew he was somewhere in the arctic and north would just have more snow and less life so Steve easily deduced he should head south. He was confident he could go in the right direction using only the sun and stars as his directors.
Tony tried to focus his hearing to better hear his AI but, instead noted the other voices in the room. They were loud and frantic and all around him. Apparently, the Calvary had arrived in the meantime. Had he fallen unconscious? Was Coulson standing in front of him right now wearing his usual unhappy frown.
The suit opened up and Tony threw himself from it and ran into Steve’s arms. He slammed his mouth into Steve’s and Steve swallowed Tony’s exultant sob.
So the decision on how to act was fairly easy.
One year later…
He stomped back and grabbed Tony by the shoulder and pointed the gun to his heart.
Steve grabbed him and pulled him into his arms. He couldn’t smother the pain, but he could have Tony…he could try and concentrate on his soulmate instead of the pain.
Steve stood to look at the scans closely and then turned back around mirroring the bewildered expression on Tony’s face.
He gulped then ducked his head again. He was afraid to look at her and see her reaction. Uncle Bucky’s words flashed through his mind and he wondered if she was “agreeable.” All his thoughts became focused on one idea that repeated like a mantra in his head:
Steve kept begging Bucky to help Tony, to get help for him, or to just check that he was alive but his lost friend merely stared at him with his dead eyes and remained unresponsive. Tony was cold and Steve was screaming at him
Tony took them up to a podium and he finally let go of Steve to place both hands on the pedestal as he took in the crowd. Steve stepped beside him and, after a moment’s hesitation, wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist. The clicking of cameras intensified and the flashing made Steve squint but he did not let go of his friend.
With his heart racing from his boldness, Steve said, “Can you tell him Peter's asleep but I’m awake and he owes me a movie.”
He took a measured breath to slow down his racing heart and reminded himself that he was no longer strapped down to that metal table.
“PETER?!”
He turned the dial back further than it had been and set it to a pivotal year in the past.
That apparently was a thing for Tony.
and he’d done so
“I’ll be out in a moment!” Peter yelled to keep his aunt at bay. To Wade, he whispered, “Want to finish the moment?”
Tony was instantly wary. The AI was hesitant and that could only mean he had sensitive information that his master needed to hear but he most likely did not want to know. Tony’s thoughts instantly went to Peter and he feared him dead.
They settled onto their sides, still periodically kissing, but their bodies began to relax and sleep began to leaden their limbs and eyelids. They ended up falling asleep, their faces nestled together, and their hearts full of their tender love for each other and the equally tender future that awaited them...
He looked away from Tony and his eyes found Peggy’s instead. She stared at him with pity and a newfound understanding. After days of pestering him about it, she knew now why he and Tony stopped seeing each other.
“Come forward now, asset,” Schmidt commanded through the sealed door.
Plus, since in the last chapter Peter endeavored to no longer refer to Tony as "Uncle Tony" but "Dad" he will be doing this in this chapter! So "Dad" = Tony and "Pops" = Steve.
Natasha took one look at the two of them and resisted the urge to smack them both over the head.
His heart froze in his chest.
He circled the top of his cup lid and remembered Aunt May’s words. He asked, “Did he really say that?”
Bucky expected more of a fight from Howard. Howard’s face changed several different shades of red and he was clenching his jaw so tightly, it looked like he may pop a tooth. Instead, the man stormed out of the meeting and it was the last the Colonel heard of it from Howard.
“Don’t go,” he whispered harshly.
He kept his voice low. He was in the kitchen and everyone else was asleep. He had slipped out of bed for a glass of water and told Steve to go back to sleep when he started to push himself up. Tony didn’t waste any time in searching for his own clothes and pulled on Steve’s underwear.
Coulson’s heart raced as he watched the little amount of footage they had on him. The Captain appeared clear-eyed and within his right mind.
Steve nodded. Follow simple commands? Yes, he could wholeheartedly agree to that. It was simple and wouldn’t jeopardize the fragile sanity he was barely clinging to.
He was met with silence…total silence. Wade lifted his head and saw everyone had turned toward him. It was only then Wade noted the hoarseness of his throat and he realized had raised his voice. He couldn't meet any of their eyes because he knew he'd see the truth in their gazes...
Tony turned his head and said, “Me too.”
“Nothing you need to concern yourself with,” she stated firmly. “Let me take care of all of the bad stuff. You just keep living your life.”
. James, Bucky, or whatever else you’d want to go by…I want to spend the rest of my life with
“…Pops? Uncle Tony?”
“If it makes our alien story a little more boring, I am more than happy to take the B-rating that goes with it,” Tony said, looking over his shoulder to see his son safe and leaning into Wade’s side.
His mind was repressing everything to protect him and he struggled with the mechanics of actually breathing for a second.
Tony couldn’t help but grin smugly at him.
“I’ll survive. I’ve got to marry you and make an honest man out of you after all.”
Steve’s head shot up and he smiled as soon as he saw Tony. A light flush brought about by joy burnished Steve’s cheeks was instantly mirrored on Tony’s face. Bucky's little glib went unnoticed by the others but Bucky was now looking between the two of them particularly. Tony pretended not to notice.
Steve slowly pushed Tony’s bottom back onto the counter and helped him sit up. He cleared his throat and said, “Sorry…Tony and I…Well…”
Dad returned the hug by holding him closely and rubbing his back. He whispered, “I know, buddy. I know…”
“Shh,” Ben hushed him. He rubbed his back and rocked him gently like Steve would do with Peter. He softly murmured, “He knew how much you cared for him.
He had killed, he had
A week passed and then another. Steve fit into Tony’s life as easily as a puzzle piece and neither noticed the passage of time.
“In the backyard, in full view of the surrounding buildings?” Tony asked to get his point across about the possibility of paparazzi. Steve nodded, flushing slightly. Tony’s heart constricted as he saw the flush but he pretended not to notice Steve’s aversion and turned to the others as he said, “Alright, let’s eat!”
His body wouldn’t move.
He continued his pacing and, at first he thought Steve wasn't going to reply and have an end to the conversation but, after an extended silence, Steve stated in a quiet voice, “We may not be related but…Peter’s…He's my son too, Tony...”
They both went flying into the opposite wall as James flung open the door.
As Steve let himself relax, his pain became more noticeable. He was so distracted by it, he only vaguely understood what Tony just said to him. He lurched forward, forgoing the strength to keep himself upright to staying conscious. He whispered with a light slur, “I love youuuu…”
Steve stared up at Schmidt in horror. He was so shocked and disturbed that he couldn’t formulate a reply. There was no way he could do it! Steve would
Norman leaned back in his chair and hummed his son’s name, “
The Soldier huffed Steve over his shoulder and then walked away.
“What are my orders?” James asked, his voice devoid of emotion.
But Steve did not consider any of that.
“What do I want?” Bucky asked no one in particular. Steve did not answer and let him sort the answer out in his mind on his own. Bucky picked up his hand and peered at the flesh of his fingertips before running them together. He then picked up his metal hand and stared at in comparison to the other with a frown. He whispered, “…I want to feel human again.”
“You are the most romantic sap I know,” Tony teased, pressing back into Steve. “And I love it.”
And on and on the questions went, getting more vulgar and more insulting as he got closer to his destination. By the time they went through the doors and they were sealed behind them Steve was literally shaking with rage and humiliation.
Soldiers marched in step with their jeep. Tony did not recognize any of them. Most were assigned to protect Panzer’s squad but Tony spent so much time with Steve and the others that he didn’t have much time to get to know the mechanics and engineers of the 107
“The future, how could it know?” Steve gasped.
Steve jumped slightly from the sudden exclamation. Tony dropped his hand and his eyes latched onto Steve’s focus.
Tony’s head snapped over to look at him and his eyes grew comically wide. He gasped, “Oh my God, our anniversary?! We’ve been together for a
Natasha’s eyes quickly scanned Steve and then she turned back to Bucky and wetly whispered, “James?”
They looked ridiculously happy and Tony’s heart soared. That was the future they had wanted. They were going to get it.
Usually, when Tony was in his arms, Tony was his everything. He’d concentrate on the weight of his limbs, the closeness of their bodies, and the feel of his smile in their kisses. His every moment in Tony’s arms was spent loving one another and nothing else mattered.
“Long story but…what about Solo?” Rogers asked, his face pinching with concern.
“What was I thinking, you’re usually so discreet,” Jarvis sarcastically said.
Venom continued, “WE STAY ONEEEE!”
Peter immediately looked away from him but Tony was still able to catch the flicker of fear in his eyes.
“Pep, you know me…I can’t love. I-I’m just not build that way…”
Steve faltered for only a second then shook his head and nearly ran back to the mansion. In the matter of seconds, all that was left of him were his wet footprints running away from Tony.
Yet Mary’s lab was in Oscorp and the boy had originally been found in one of his “abandoned” labs. He knew it was only a matter of time before their suspicions were cast back to him.
. I can’t imagine this world without him. I would physically be alive but I wouldn’t be able to live on...”
“Anthony.”
Peter commented, “Your arm is freaking bigger than my thigh.”
Peter raised his gaze and smiled reassuringly at Tony. He replied, “No, it won’t even faze him.”
Uneasiness churned Steve’s stomach as everything was spiraling out of control. He whispered, “What does SHIELD want?”
“Three years?” He had to confirm. He had to ascertain that she was truly with Schmidt. Because, the memories he had of her, painted a picture of a woman akin to a god. She had been his sunshine, his life, his happiness…To know she had gone through the same evils as he had, sickened him to his core.
Bucky was caught by two suits instead and hung limply in their arms. A bristling Tony, meanwhile, pushed himself out of the suits’ grasps and angrily hissed, “He wasn’t going to hurt me!”
Wade groaned heavily and threw back his head. What the hell was he supposed to do?? He faced problems head on and made fun of their stupid faces! He didn’t dive deeper! He wasn’t serious!! He –! He hadn’t loved anyone like this before to truly care what was happening…
Bucky stood up, smiling sadly at Tony and said, "Work on getting better first, punk."
Peter stood a few feet away from him, fighting a black mass from totally covering his body. The Chameleon, still in Mary’s guise, and Dr. Calvin stood off to the side and impassively watched.
“Well, I was hoping, I mean after all the flirting and that kiss…” Wade teased.
“Fine,” he growled. “Can I go now?”
At one point in the repair, Bucky grunted in pain and Tony called him a baby. Bucky retorted with another insult and next thing Steve knew, they were throwing insults at each other, each one escalating with fervor and abuse. Steve immediately went to stop it but when he tried to get between them they both yelled at him to leave them alone. So Steve stepped back and waited for any signs of violence to step in again. Instead, they kept up the insults and hate as Tony worked on Bucky’s arm. When he was done, Tony hissed, “Okay, shit for brains try it now.”
“Have you figured out what we are doing for the reveal, by the way?” Steve questioned, innocent to the thoughts going through Tony’s mind.
Tony thought of the forlorn and lost Bucky he sat with today and sadly agreed, “No…he is not…”
Tony ran a finger down his bristled jaw and retorted, “Glad to.”
Steve seriously considered his question and replied, “A lot, there’s a lot of stuff wrong, Peter.”
Pepper rolled her eyes and retorted, “We need to address this immediately.”
“Wait,” Tony assured him. “I’ll come back to you. I always do.”
“I…” They both began simultaneously and then they grinned sheepishly at each other.
Steve Rogers was going to be the death of him.
Steve stared at her, shocked by her heartless attitude.
Steve fell to his knees and he cupped Tony’s face as if he was as fragile as thinly spun sugar.
Peter closed his eyes and mentally went through all the tests he and Eddie were going to go through with their new sample. He eventually supplied, “Later, I don’t have an exact time yet.”
Peter awkwardly clenched his fists and then replied, “Nah…I’m…I’m going to go up.”
“I liked it too,” Tony replied, his voice just as hushed.
Father Michael grabbed the pot and poured them each a cup and then sat down at the table with Steve. He gave Steve the mug and then pressed, “Eat.”
his father would abuse the knowledge he gained.
When they left the building, they exited right onto a busy street. There was a giant white shell on the outside of the building so Steve doubted they’d have any trouble finding it again. He silently followed Cable, his eyes always moving as he took in the new environment he was entering. The car plates immediately told him he was in California and, with all of the sand everywhere and the smell of salt in the air, it was obvious they were on the coast. But, California had hundreds of miles of coast, so his narrowed down list was still fairly large.
“Natalia?” He huskily whispered, brushing her hair from her face.
Peter hadn’t seen anyone romantically since Gwen died because he didn’t want to risk anyone else’s life ever again. Dating him was a risk. Even with Wade’s abilities, he wouldn’t have risked that unless he was
With the passing of midnight and the official start of a new day, Steve’s prior hopes of finding a way to separate Peter from Venom were beginning to dwindle. What if there was no cure? What if Peter, his beautiful baby boy, was really gone?
Howard’s finger circled around the star-spangled drawing of Tony’s shield and remembered all the designs Howard had gone through before settling on the classic design that was now immortalized in history as being synonymous with Captain America. The Vibranium was a bitch to get so he had been so nervous etching the design on it…
“What do I do? And how are we going to do this? Which one of us is going to be the girl?” Steve asked in confusion.
God…why couldn’t he have him? Why must they be such catalysts for the future?
“Steve,” Tony repeated and his insides did a little flip. He was now on a first name basis with the Captain America. His inner child was about to faint.
Tony pushed the chip back in and was relieved to see the reactor accept it. It’d work for now but, it felt wrong to put such a damaged piece of equipment into the reactor.
Tony’s faceplate slammed shut and, with a blast of his repulsors, he went flying into the sky. Steve watched him go wide-eyed and with a slack jaw.
Steve chuckled before Tony could think of more to say and he said, “You’re welcome, I guess?”
Steve kept his one hand on the compress but he used his other hand to angle Tony’s head back to have more access to his mouth. Neither of them could breathe so they broke away sharply when their lungs could no longer take it.
It was just after 7 am and he would have gone back to sleep for a few more minutes…if it weren’t for the alarming number of notifications on his phone.
“Don’t get too close?” Steve repeated, quirking an eyebrow. He walked toward the glass door and quickly opened it. Before anyone could react, Steve threw his shield and sent Mysterio flying back into the smoke. The shield flew back like a boomerang and he held up his arm and the magnets drew it back and caught it.
Steve covered his face to stifle the heat coming off his face. He was surprised he hadn’t caught fire yet.
“I am being ridiculously ravished right now by a ridiculously handsome man with a ridiculously perfect body and some ridiculously smelling lube.”
Steve was the first to see him from his spot in the kitchen, facing the bedroom. His eyebrows shot up in surprise. He was wearing his running attire and his companion was dressed similarly. Steve’s acquaintance turned around and smiled in greeting as he recognized Tony.
“That it is,” Steve replied. “We should put this about your bed. How does that sound?”
Steve looked from the couple and then to his own better half and smiled at him. Tony grinned back and Steve pulled him tighter to his side.
“What is that?” Tony asked nervously. Didn’t they take a lot of weird drugs back in the day that they thought were good like cocaine and other hallucinogens?
That next morning, while they ate breakfast, Bucky and Natasha returned to the Tower with nothing.
“Another scan may provide us with better answers,” Jarvis reasoned.
“Pops said Hydra only wanted me,” Peter explained with a frown. He did not like talking about the subject.
“Do we need to worry about that?” Maya’s voice cut through and Steve heard Tony inhale sharply.
“…You wouldn’t mind?” Tony asked, feeling like a confused teen again.
Needless to say, the reporters were literally dancing on their toes and looked like they wanted to jump them. If they hadn’t been assigned spots to question, they probably would have pounced…
The smoke eventually cleared revealing a man wearing a full body red suit with black accents and two large samurai swords strapped to his back. He stopped coughing and straightened with a loud groan. The fact that he was masked alone unnerved Tony but throw in the samurai swords and Tony felt both anxious and angry all at once.
“God, Steve…I am more than fine. You – You’re here!” Tony embraced him again and then repeated more hoarsely, “You’re alive.”
The darkness was immediate.
It only had one ring left before it went to voicemail so he quickly answered it with a breathless, "Hello?"
“How did you get here?” She gasped. She looked beyond him to the door closed behind him and asked, “Are Rogers or Stark with you?”
Fury delivered the news to them personally and blamed the fact that the entire team was divided for this tragedy. Tony was loathe to admit it…but he was right. He and Steve had brought their personal baggage into this and their constant nitpicking played a huge part in keeping everyone divided and on edge.
!” Steve gasped, his voice rough with emotion. “Vision and Wanda will be there in another minute. Let them handle this.
“Tonnnnyyy,” Pepper groaned with frustration.
“Jarvis, let’s go with a Junior Prom soundtrack,” Tony said with a grin that repressed his laughter. Slower, classical music started to play and Steve felt himself relax tremendously. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and nuzzled his face into Steve’s chest then began to sway back and forth. Steve found himself swaying with him. He wrapped his arms around him too and laid his cheek on top of Tony’s head. A small smile twitched at his lips.
Howard’s eyes surprising got larger and he gasped, “What?”
When Wade stopped, Peter cautiously opened his eyes and saw where he innately knew they were going: the Hulk Room. It was a windowless room build with the strongest materials on Earth, made to contain the strongest of the Avengers. It was the safest place for Peter to be while Venom remained on him.
“He’s different now,” Peter whispered as he thought of the man who had stepped into his life, hours earlier. “Ever since the Avengers…”
Stepan promised, “I will, Papa.”
With his eyes still closed, Peter reflected over the prior few days. Not only had Peter felt tired but he had been overly obsessive with Venom and had, at times, isolated himself. Venom had done that to him and Peter hadn’t even noticed…it was scary to think what would’ve happened if he was still in the symbiote’s power… If it wasn’t for Wade and what he felt for him, he may have completely secluded himself and have been lost to the alien.
Steve was drawn to him like a moth to a flame and he knew he was going to eventually get burned…But he didn’t care.
“Captain Rogers –,” she began uneasily.
A young woman entered the room with a calming smile and she greeted him.
“Steve –,” Bruce began with a pained expression.
“He’s my boyfriend and I am an adult male with needs, dad,” Peter replied sarcastically.
“A romantic as always,” Peter groaned with smile.
Tony grimly nodded.
“Tony,” Steve groaned aloud, thinking of him.
“Are you kidding me? I want to see Steve’s reaction to the chest buster scene,” Peter retorted, making Wade chuckle. Wade’s nails were lightly scraping his scalp and it felt amazing. Peter hoped he wouldn’t stop for a long time because it was relaxing.
- my friend. It was his name I connected to Stepan.” He grasped her hand and whispered, “They called me ‘James.’ My name is James.”
His hand met only open air and his eyes snapped open from the shock of it. He didn’t recognize the room and he immediately could tell something was off. Everything was too artificial and that radio broadcast…he sharply sat up and continued to listen. Yes, that was a game he had attended. They were playing a recording, trying to trick him into thinking he was safe.
A nurse rolled in a crib for Peter but neither he nor Tony made a move to put him in it. He stayed nestled at Steve’s side and would likely stay there the entire night.
“Buc—.”
His dad picked up on the first ring, gasping, “Peter!”
Tony paused, his heartbeat picking up a little more, as he turned to the Captain. Steve’s face was a mask but Tony felt trapped by his worried eyes.
And Steve was going to die with more heartbreak than he would have originally had. Tony royally fucked up this up.
I am hoping to get this next chapter out by this weekend but, with my work schedule, it'll probably be out by next weekend! I'll post teasers/updates onto my
“I’m not an invalid,” Bucky grumbled.
The lawyers left not long after, only staying to exchange a few more words and then left them alone. As soon as the doors sealed them inside, Tony reluctantly pulled away from Steve.
And his baby boy’s eyes just widened in surprise…and then focused on Wade as they returned to normal size…and then kept closing.
transferred that foam to the empty tin. He churned that lather until it became a think foam and held it out to Tony saying, “Ta da!”
Wade just held onto him tighter, like his hold would keep Peter tethered down to this era despite his past being completely eradicated. His body was numb, but he didn’t watch his body’s progressive disappearance.
“All alone? How boring,” Wade sighed over-dramatically.
His thoughts and reasoning came back to him in this world of color. It was enough of a distraction to remind him there was more than just cold.
Steve tensed then relaxed and, without looking up, replied, “Fine.”
It was warm but a comfortable warm with a cool breeze that would keep them from ever feeling too hot. But Cable probably was not too comfortable as he had slipped on a leather jacket and gloves to hide his metal arm. He also wore dark sunglasses to hide his glowing red eye.
Relaxed and happy in Steve’s hold, Tony fell asleep quickly.
“We’re actually doing this,” Tony whispered, collapsing onto a nearby chair. He and Steve were still holding onto each other and neither let go when Tony fell. Tony could feel his husband’s grip shaking. The great Captain America could do nothing for his son. Tony knew Steve must have felt torn up inside by this fact.
Steve’s stomach dropped with the realization that he was mated to a man nonetheless one whom he had called incompetent not twenty minutes ago.
That was where the similarities ended. He was not as relaxed as he would have been in his youth and Steve could make out concealed weapons on his person. His longer hair, shielded his gaze so Steve could not make out his entire face. He wore a dirty jacket and leather gloves. His metal arm was entirely hidden except for the tiny space where his wrist was exposed, anyone could have mistaken it for a watch.
“How shall I proceed, Sir?” Jarvis asked.
Peter and Wade were cuddling on his bed, watching an old eighties movie when his dad finally came to collect them for the party. They knew he’d be coming soon so had redressed and hid any evidence of their lovemaking.
“Keep your promise,” Natasha looked over her shoulder and threatened.
Natasha straightened and asked, “What is your second request?”
“You are not strong enough,” the Red Skull hissed and punched Tony across the jaw.
“Don’t do it without backup,” Tony hissed.
“Famine…” Logan stated, his voice barely a whisper.
“You’re practically glaring holes into Stevie there. Did you two get into a disagreement while hunkered down in your hole?”
“The Avengers Initiative is considered a branch of SHIELD and thereby a branch of the military,” the Captain explained. “We’re considered government employees.”
But the interviews were a double-edged sword and Steve became stressed by every single one. It was after one particular interview that they discussed the lie of how they had started dating, did Tony find his boyfriend in their dressing room with his face buried in his hands.
“Not even a hand-job?” Tony whined.
He jumped out of the suit and straight into Steve’s arms. Steve caught him with a look of surprise and Tony gasped, “One last time.”
Tony rubbed his back and murmured something sweetly to him. He could tell Steve was upset and it hurt Steve all the more.
“Let off some steam, Cap,” Cable said and turned back to the reactor.
His weird behavior must had been because he was tired. That coupled with the trauma over the Venom incident probably was making him a little wonky. Peter chuckled and said, “Alright, you want Friday to wake you in an hour?”
Steve cracked open his eyes and looked to Tony. He smiled playfully and held his red hands up as he said, “I do not think I could hold the wash cloth for long. Can you help me?”
He was badly hurt and extremely emaciated. She tenderly touched his shoulder and whispered again, “Steve?”
Steve still worriedly tilted Tony’s head to the side to inspect the cut the best that he could.
century,” Tony countered.
Steve sighed again. What about Bucky indeed? Steve stated, “Auntie Nat is right. It’s their business. I wouldn’t want anyone to butt in my relationship with Uncle Tony so it would not be fair to do the same to them.”
He said nothing as Bucky took his place or as Bruce announced that it was ready or when Bucky picked up the case with the infinity stones...or when Bruce asked Bucky if he were ready and Bucky looked to Steve.
“And let’s get there first squirt,” Tony interrupted. “I’m only going in there for a minute so that is your time limit. Use it accordingly.”
“He’ll be fine, Steve,” Father Michael promised him. “A lot has changed since your era. The news media are more concerned about ratings over events and currently the Hydra scandal is the hot ticket. Tony Stark feeling better and going home would be the last thing in their cycle…”
Unknown to him, on the other side of the country, those sky-blue eyes opened for the first time in over seventy years.
“No problem, what are boyfriends for?”
you were my soulmate.”
“Oooh, you’re slick,” Tony chuckled. Tony pulled them to a stop in front of the arcade and gasped, “Oh, we’ve got to go in there!” He pulled Steve forward and exclaimed, “C’mon!”
Peter could not believe how lucky he was when a cop strolled past the mouth of the alley.
Peter tried to sit up, his entire body protesting from the impact. Venom’s tendrils, wildly jumped around him and whatever people that were around him backed away with shouts of frightened exclamation upon sighting the alien.
! Ow, ow, ow, ow!” Wade dragged out his words as the symbiote dragged him roughly against the pavement. The symbiote was desperate to get away but Wade refused to let go. Its initial attack had knocked off Stark but Wade would withstand any pain for Peter. The alien had to kill him first and death herself still hadn’t found a way to do it so it was going to have an impossible fight on its gooey black hands.
“…Bruce,” Tony whispered cautiously. His anger had melted away in the face of a gamma-radiated disaster standing beside him.
He frowned and readjusted the thought.
“He's still asleep?” Pepper murmured gently, as if Peter could hear her from where he was holed up in his room.
Tony wrapped his free arm around Steve in a tight half-hug and hissed, “My thoughts exactly.” He pulled back to meet Steve’s eyes and asked, “Truce?”
“Maria told me about your living situation,” Bruce suddenly said. Steve twitched in surprise and he slowly swallowed his lick of ice cream.
Tony had promised the mayor he would swoop in before the main ceremony and Pepper had been calling him hourly not to forget. The mayor was practically the only reason they got the permits to build the arc reactor in his tower and even Tony knew not to abuse the favors he promised to the man.
They beat the record of most tweeted in an hour.
Tony sighed heavily and said, “Never mind.” He turned to Steve and asked, “Did you see enough? I think we got the basic idea. Big bad Hydra equates to SHIELD in her mind. We probably should not try to convince her otherwise on the first date…”
Tony smothered the laugh with his mouth and Steve melted into the kiss. Tony pressed him into the door and explored Steve's mouth like he'd never been there. Steve wound his arms around Tony, pulling him as closely as he could, and Tony carded his fingers into Steve's hair, pulling slightly on it so he could tilt his head more and deepen the kiss.
Looking slightly taken aback, Steve gasped, “No!”
Tony entered the room with an air of flair, smirking cockily and raising his arms up in triumph. From across the room, Steve laughed and he was smiling just as happily as Tony was, making Tony’s heart do a ridiculous flip in his chest.
It was the sound of his son’s broken voice was what finally truly broke Steve.
The detectives came for Steve after the press conference.
Pepper came to pick them up. Steve, Tony, and the rest of the team left together. His friends were coming as a show of support and would sit behind Steve during the proceedings.
Peter glanced at the man beside him after his comment.
“Why?” Why these random questions?
Steve slipped on his clothes and then rolled up his sleeping bag. He stuffed it into his rucksack and then slung it over his shoulder as he slipped out of his tent.
Her brown eyes flickered back to Steve and he held her gaze.
The doors opened as he walked up to him and he entered the Avengers’ locker room. When the doors closed, Peter automatically went to pull off his mask. He chuckled to himself for the move as Venom morphed into a plain black shirt and he needed to remove nothing. He’d get the hang of it eventually.
How could they truly live without being there for each other in the real world?
“Why don’t you lay down for a bit? We’ve got plenty of extra rooms here,” Peter offered, placing a gentle and on Eddie’s shoulder.
It was the way he stared at him though that convinced him. Even though he was still so small, Peter stared at him with an unwavering gaze that the older version had used when he stared down the Sinister Six.
He got his wife pregnant at the same time and planned to use the baby born as a comparison to the gamma-radiated babies. Maybe even test future serums on his child as well…
“Yeah,” Peter sighed the word loud enough and his father stepped in.
Frantic to establish a connection, Steve reached out to him. Tony took his hand and Steve immediately relaxed. He asked, “Will I see you in the morning?”
“Steve…man, you need to step out,” Bucky murmured into his ear, lightly grasping his arm.
Steve’s mind flashed back to the moment that thing…
“What was it then?” Tony teased.
Venom shrieked as he attacked the largest group of agents. The men and women scattered, shouting out warnings. Venom was able to grab ahold of one of the more junior agents. All the agents shot at the symbiote, including the one in Venom’s grasp. Venom threw the man an unsurvivable distance and jumped from the path of the majority of the bullets.
Natasha cleared her throat and held up a cell phone.
Tony’s eyes were glassy with unshed tears and his vision must’ve been blurred by it but his gaze was focused on Steve’s. His eyes were begging for Steve to help and Steve felt crushed by it.
“Perfect!” Tony gasped. “I will talk to him right now!” Tony spun around and spotted Bucky leaning against a wall on the opposite side of the room. He was watching the kids play and looking miserable. Tony called out, “HEY! ROBOCOP! You, me, balcony, right now.”
Peter laughed, “You keep saying that word and it’ll go straight to my ego.”
Dad lightly touched his head one last time and whispered in farewell, “I’ll be back soon…”
The article was entitled:
Thanks for reading! I hope I did not scar you too emotionally! ;D
“You and me, we’ll be together, simple as that,” Tony stated.
There was also a superhero in New York, just like something out of one of the comics the he had read as a kid and, of all people, it was Howard Stark’s son! Iron Man. The crew had no photos and didn't have connection to the Internet (a technology that still boggled his mind) so they could not show him what Iron Man looked like. Yet, what they described sounded glorious.
“Just making sure you didn’t lose anything in the plane crash. Oh, by the way, how did you survive that?? And how come you look exactly like I remember you??”
Steve took off his shirt and tied off the bottom to make it into a makeshift bag and then used it to collect the pieces in it to keep them all together. The main body of the reactor was the first piece he added and it was crumbled like a balled up piece of paper. It made Steve uneasy. How on Earth was Cable going to fix this?
“Your father is one of the strongest men on the planet. He does not use that power selfishly as many others would, Peter. He helps people because he knows with great power comes great responsibility. If it weren’t for your father thousands would be dead and many more would be hurt…”
“This ain’t the dream world, babe,” Tony explained with a smirk. “I can’t magic lube to my hand…”
“Great, dad,” Peter replied. He hugged his father and repeated, “It’s great!”
Bucky rose his eyebrows and said, “Really? What about the rest of the team?”
Smiling widely, Tony stated, “Cap, I decided I can’t navigate the past by myself and have determined you will be the perfect candidate to help me. I can’t go to Howard because he’d just use the opportunity to try to learn about my tech and there’s no way I’m letting my dad do that because he’d totally try to replicate it and change the future. So, you are my best bet to try and keep the future intact…”
He found Bucky sitting on a balcony overlooking the water and he was staring out at the ocean with an empty expression.
Steve hummed in agreement and they walked back to their bedroom arm-in-arm.
“Is – Is she Bucky’s girl?” Steve gasped, also affected by what they just saw.
Steve didn’t care about whoever SHIELD was. He looked past Natasha and into the seemingly empty house and asked, “Where is Tony?”
Just thinking of him made Steve’s heart flip in his chest.
“Hi?” Peter said.
They strongly debated where the ceremony would be held. They were tempted to be one of the first to marry at the courthouse but, in the end, decided against it. They would give those happy couples the press and not let their marriage overshadow their long awaited marriages. Steve and Tony had been together for a few years. Some of those couples had been together for decades. It was their day so Steve and Tony only attended as a show of support. It had been a moving day filled with happy tears and wide smiles.
“I don’t have enemies,” Peter muttered indignantly.
Tony closed his eyes and pressed his face against the shield and suppressed the urge to cry. Fury was still in the area and he’d be damned if he’d let him see him cry again.
Their latest group of enemies had been defeated and, as the smoke cleared, Peter was nowhere in sight.
Tony swiped his hand down, closing all the holograms and he asked his husband, “Is everything alright?”
“There’s a photo of us from last night,” his dad explained with a sad sigh. “When we left together. Someone must have been in the garage. We’re both smiling and, according to Steve, when we do that we look like twins, which I think is ridiculous because I am clearly the more handsome between the two of us.”
“Hail, Hydra,” Steve gasped, tears forming in his eyes. He was trembling in Schmidt’s hold and staring at his implant.
Tony looked back to Peter and explained to Peter, “It keeps me alive and is snazzy chest piece.”
Just when you think I can't twist the knife any deeper, I twitch my wrist and prove you wrong!
– is just
Tony lightly grasped his forearm and said, “I went through this too…It’s okay – It’s good even. It’s healthy. It’s a part of the healing process.”
Peter closed his eyes as another shudder of revulsion moved through him. He needed to stop this. He needed to regain control and help Wade. Breathing evenly, Peter gained control of his heartrate and tried to exude a peaceful feeling.
Peter's shower put his to shame. It instantly went to Peter’s preferred temperature and was steaming in seconds. Wade counted at least four shower-heads before his gaze was drawn back to Peter as he pulled Wade inside.
“Steve, sorry,” Bucky gasped. “I-I’ve never woken with someone in my bed. I thought you were an enemy.”
“So Peter’s existence is going to get out soon,” Tony voiced what everyone was thinking. “Though they do not seem to know Peter is Steve’s son.”
Steve smiled and joined him. He grasped Tony’s outstretched hand and let him pull him the rest of the way in. He wrapped his arms around Tony and settled into his side. Tony started to kiss him and Steve readily accepted them but, after several seconds, broke away. Tony was distracted by something, he could tell by the way he was kissing. Steve asked, “Are you sure nothing is wrong?”
Peter looked up from the text with a smirk, and reiterated for him, “We are ingenious dweebs.”
All he knew was that Tony had a home in Malibu, California overlooking the ocean. If need be, Steve would run to the west and search all of the coastal homes until he found him.
. He saw it before when he revealed his face but – but now he could see that it was alive. Its dark tentacles were swaying above him.
It was foolish, stupid even, in the back of his mind he knew his master would get him in the end, but, his newly discovered heart was breaking out of its shell and screaming for a chance.
with his son??
towards finding Peter!
If Bucky was really after Tony he would have shot Tony while he was out.
Peter cried out when Wade was hurt again. But, despite the multiple impalements, Wade did not let go of him and gurgled, “P-Pe-t-terrr.”
Steve gulped and replied, “And what of you? Don’t you get nervous?”
What would a robotic clone with no purpose do?
The doors opened and Steve was about to call out to her but that was when he saw him.
“So Wade, what have you been doing recently?” Steve asked.
Tony watched Steve round the counter with a smile. Steve began to wash off Peter over the sink and Tony looked back down at the photo.
Howard smiled at her and whispered, “This is why I married you…”
Tony leaned down to nip at his neck and reminded him, “And no clothes.”
His heart twisted as he was unable – no,
“No, Venom won’t let him,” Steve stated and he and the symbiote did not break eye contact. To the symbiote, Steve said, “You’re dying. Peter won’t bond with you.”
“Just to rub it in your old man’s face, I bet,” Howard teased and Tony leveled a glare at him.
“I’d do it all again,” Steve replied, wishing they were close enough that he could reach out and touch him. He still half believed this was a dream and wouldn’t fully believe he was there until he touched him.
“All you need to do is smile to make my sad go away, Peter,” Steve murmured and Peter automatically smiled as wide as he could, displaying his tiny teeth.
“Please tell me Sneaky says he gets premature greys at least,” Jim asked Steve.

“More than a little! She was fuming! What the hell changed?? She originally wanted nothing to do with Peter!” Tony asked him with a scandalized look.
Trigger warnings about discussion of rape and graphic violence

Photographs were shot of him by the paparazzi but the shots he waited for never came.
Next Time, Ch. 2: The Scheduled Event comes as a Surprise
He had no valuables on him…not even any shoes on his feet, just the thick socks Father Michael had given to him to warm up his feet after his shower. Those socks were filthy now and probably beyond saving. After he stepped out of the bus, he took them off and threw them out into the nearest trash can he found.
“The nanorobots can construct a variety of weapons. However, being that your mind is not hooked up to their mainframe, you’ll have to vocally state what is needed,” the AI retorted.
Tony’s immediate flush answered that question, making Steve smile. Tony grumbled, “I just wanted today to be special…”
Bucky glanced behind him and saw Steve was still hunched over Tony, their faces centimeters apart. Tears were in Steve’s eyes and he was whispering something to Tony, lightly petting his face as he did. Tony was still holding on to him and his knuckles were turning white from the tightness of his grip.
Cable spun around and his face hardened when he saw Steve was holding the photo. He stomped down the few stairs between them and then snatched the photo out of his hands. His expression became mostly unreadable except his frown deepened as he took in the photo…if one could call it that now…
Now his embarrassment doubled because he was doing this in front of the others. He mumbled, “Love you too, Dad.”
They put Peter’s hand underneath a microscope and had him make it “sticky” so Bruce can watch the process. When it happened, Bruce shot back from the microscope with wide eyes and an excited grin.
He said Howard was here to help so he clearly wanted him to help with the reactor.
Steve chuckled, “Our family is expanding as always…”
Susan Tyler stepped aside to not impede his fall and smiled at his prone body at her feet. She was holding a large, bloody shard of glass in her hand and her front was covered in more blood.
“Protect you,” Bucky said. He paused and grasped his head as he murmured, “And help you…I…I
“And no TV, video games, phone, or internet,” Steve added.
“James don’t!” Natasha begged, her voice breaking through to him. Her hands were digging into his biceps but he barely heard or felt her.
The shower washed his come away and Steve watched its progression into the drain with a deepening blush.
“Sleep well, Sir,” Jarvis stated and the lights in his workshop dimmed significantly.
“Mjölnir?” Thor peered thoughtfully at his hammer and then his eyes flicked to Tony and he asked, “When did the Captain say this?”
But her mate ignored the weapons in favor of drawing back the sleeve on his right arm, fully exposing his implant to her.
With those words, Steve knew with absolute certainty that Norman knew Peter was Mary’s son. He did not know how but Norman somehow learned of it. And he was trying to use this information to not only toy with Steve and Tony but Peter as well.
“Am I already a third-wheel?” Tony sarcastically asked.
Steve parted from Peggy without another word and ran to Howard’s tent. He was happy no one else was hovering by. Word was already spreading throughout the camp that Tony had been inflicted with a mysterious injury. Jacques and Dum Dum had already inquired with him about Tony’s condition and he knew the remaining Commandos were not going to be far behind.
An asset was something useful or valuable.
One of the shelves had the last photo of Tony and his dad. He paused before it and was highly tempted to place the picture face down so he wouldn’t have to see his father. He’d only put the framed photo there because his investors would’ve thought it strange if he had no pictures of the company’s founder up. He regarded Howard’s serious face and again wondered what his father would think of all of this – of Iron Man – of how Tony was turning about the company…
He had to hear Pops’ voice, just one word, and he would gladly let the others drag him away. He just had to be sure – he just had to know that what his mind had determined was not true! It couldn’t be true!
“Wait.” Steve grasped his arm to stop him from leaving. Bucky froze under his touch and did not look at him. Steve whispered, “Please take my phone number at least. If you need anything, anything at all, please call me!”
“Yup,” Peter said, forcing himself not to sigh heavily. He was probably going to be answering this question a lot in the coming weeks.
“And this will come to an immediate end once one of us decides to get into a serious relationship with someone else,” Steve stated.
“Oh, mercy me,” Wade breathed, fanning himself as he fell back into his pillows.
When they were gone, he felt hollow and alone.
, Tony silently begged of his boyfriend.
After applauding the graduates, everyone filled out of the amphitheater and headed toward the ballroom for the afterparty celebration. The voices of family and friends buzzed loudly in the halls and Peggy surprisingly stated, “He almost looks like the Tony we first met. It is so strange to see him
“Hey, Sleepyhead!” Tony called out to the man, “Wake up!”
Tony continued, hoping hitting Steve with both shocking revelations at once would lessen the blow, “Steve, she’s using one of those samples to prove her accusation…”
“Steveeeee,” Wade droned.
Rogers murmured, “I knew he had some problems but…I never thought…”
Tony instantly grabbed Bucky’s arm, staying any form of the attack the man might fight back with. Bucky’s muscles were tense beneath Tony’s grip and he was trembling in suppressing himself.
Steve laughed and kissed his side, the closest thing to his mouth, and buried his face into Tony’s torso to get closer to him. He mumbled into his flesh, “We don’t need to do anything big but we should probably choose a date so we’ll be better prepared for next year!”
Tony was so taken aback by her declaration that he jerked back in surprise. His emotions ran wild as he replayed the statement “fake or real,” “100%,” and “heart on the line.” All of which alluded to something more and something amazing.
“Mmmm, I can still smell it in your skin,” Wade replied huskily as he pressed his face into Peter’s neck.
Steve had a tiny room that reminded him of his old apartment in Brooklyn. The walls were bare, his bed was too small for him, and by standing in the small space he took up nearly all the available space. The American team in the Arctic shared some clothes with him and he hadn’t touched the orange jumpsuit since boarding the ship. He kept it wrapped around his shield and uniform and no one had yet to notice it.
– no, it was not Peter.
Jarvis nodded curtly and said, “Very well. I will need the coordinates for the location and an order for the soldiers there so they know not to bother the suit while it hibernates.”
Steve repressed a sob and, with a shuddering breath, reminded himself that he and Cable were going to fix this. They were going to the past and they were going to save Tony.
“Natasha, you’re hurt!” Steve hissed, worriedly eyeing her injuries. Her adrenaline was pumping so strong that she didn’t even feel the bullet wounds.
Peter squeezed his hands and whispered, “It really happened?”
Wade opened and closed his mouth a few times, grasping for the right words. Wade’s dad beat him and he barely remembered his mom. He had no relevant experience with parents, especially ones that loved their children. Peter’s situation was vastly different and had so many levels to its history. Should Wade do like in the movies and pat Peter’s back and deliver a moving speech that would move Peter so much that he would feel obligated to see his father? How in the hell would he accomplish that in the first place??
He could barely feel Steve’s warmth against his back or the weight of his arms embracing him. Yet his scent, like fresh cotton, was all that kept him from tipping over the edge and go searching for a scotch. And
Howard stuck his head out of the room and waved his assistant over. He gave her direction in order to get his people mobilized and start searching for Steve and thereby the tesseract.
“Something weird is happening,” Steve stated, staring down at his fingers.
As they were pulling into the garage, Steve spotted a few paparazzi catching a few pictures of their car pulling in.
“Wade-!?” Peter hissed.
so that’s not saying much for your intelligence.”
Tony laughed and pulled Steve into his embrace. He teased, “Gosh, darn, I'm sorry.”
“Nothing happened,” Steve assured the former SHIELD agents as soon as they pulled away in an unmarked van. They promised him that someone would come by later to pick up his bike and he trusted their word. He needed answers but also had to set the record straight.
Tony smirked and wound his arms around Steve too.
Tony walked him through the building of the Mark II suit and Steve even helped him pick out the final colors. Tony also built himself a new reactor for his chest, but they had a very long and lengthy discussion about Tony’s health and safety before he installed it. They got into countless debates about how to keep people safe and whether or not he should tell the military about the suit he had built.
“Yay, open me up so they can carry me out of here…” Tony tiredly said.
The shock and fear on Gwen’s face replayed clearly in Peter’s mind. He had to stop. He could not say any more. The elevator dinged and opened. He gasped sharply, “I’ve got to go.”
He just disappeared. Steve couldn’t even hold him anymore in his grief.
Steve merely adjusted and tightened his hold on Tony, wordlessly letting Tony know where he wanted to be.
Next Time, Ch. 10 The Getaway
,” Tony groaned.
“I like to flirt with super serum men, but only if they have blue eyes. Gotta love those blue eyes,” Tony teased, his last statement was more directed at Steve than Gabe.
Bucky entered the tent and secured it shut. He walked over to Steve and whispered, “How was he through the night?”
Steve and Bucky chuckled. Steve murmured, “Well, I guess we should go out there.”
“Oh…yeah, well, I’ll smell ya, later,” Eddie said, stepping back.
Peter shook his head with a chuckle and said, “This is going to be different with a man though…”
Everyone else’s gifted Peter with toys, all of which his son loved.
Somehow, he was brought back. Maybe a mad scientist got a hold of his body and resurrected him or maybe someone in the 107
Tony leapt to his feet, clutching Peter’s tiny toy to his chest. He swayed as he was still drunk but his eyes were steady. Tony commanded, “Jarvis, run a scan on her. Make sure it really is her and she is not armed.”
“The wedding photo will tell us if it worked,” Cable stated as if he could read Steve’s frantic thoughts. If it weren’t for Tony laying limply in his arms, he probably would have taken the photo out of his pocket right there. Cable continued, “Let’s get him downstairs and ourselves out of here before he wakes up or Rhodes stumbles upon us!”
– but back on the streets.
Tony huffed but he didn’t complain. Fury was dead. It would have been weird if SHIELD wasn’t a little antsy and hadn’t uped up their security. He stepped out of the suit and his bare feet touched cold tile. He should have put shoes on before he jumped in the suit. He repressed a shiver from the air conditioning hitting his thin shirt and nodded to his suit as he sarcastically asked, “Where shall I hang this-?”
Later that night, Steve would look back on that moment and wish he had focused on his son’s smile more.
Tony dropped his head and his heart sank just as low. He mumbled, “I’m sorry to hear that…”
He never once brought up the fact that they were soulmates again.
Steve sleepily rubbed his back and murmured in a whisper, “Next time we should fall asleep on something cushioned like the couch or a bed.”
Yet with the daylight the shadows were obliterated and with it his hiding places. SHIELD found him before the sun had even fully risen. The agents could not capture him, he dodged whatever they threw at him and slipped out of all the traps they had.
He pulled out his phone and Steve shook his head but complied as Tony settled Peter between them. Peter reached up to the phone and it took them a moment to find the perfect angle where they would mostly see his face instead of his grabby hands.
“Barnes!” She called out.
“She did ballet,” Bucky commented, his gaze was far off and looking at nothing in particular.
Eddie’s exclamation broke the spell on the people in the rest of the room. Everyone moved forward to congratulate them. He and Eddie broke apart and accepted their congratulations with smiles and happy words.
happening?!” Monty countered as the rest of the team surrounded Tony.
Hell, he was going to change the future to save him. It was a declaration of how strong his feelings were for the man.
"We shouldn't have contacted him," Tony whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
The loss was like an open wound and the only thing to heal it would be Tony.
Tony turned to him with his head cocked to the side in question.
Why did Venom bring them there!?
Hulk turned to Steve with an enraged roar. He did not hear Steve. All he knew was that Steve was hindering him. Steve caught the Hulk’s emerald green eyes and he begged, “Hulk stop. It’s Peter, y-your brother.
Couldn’t he just have one moment of peace with Steve? Just one!!
Jarvis drove them in the Bentley so the entire family was able to pile in the back and Maria dozed off on his shoulder while Tony continued to sleep on his lap.
“Yes,” the examiner replied with an aspirated edge to his voice.
“Brock, now!” Tony barked.
Steve threw his shield onto one of the seats and went to his locker as Clint took off.
Jarvis walked up to his side and stated, “That was extremely dangerous, Sir. I know you like to take your own life in your hands but now the fate of the entire future is at stake. You cannot seek idle flirtations here.”
Steve’s mind could barely fathom it.
“Damn right, you better be sorry,” Uncle Bucky murmured into the top of Peter’s head. Aunt Tasha lightly touched Uncle Bucky’s arm and his trembling lessened.
“I think I’m gonna lie here a little,” Tony whispered to no one in particular.
“I just want to be with you,” Peter whispered into Wade’s shoulder.
“The woman can be a character witness,” one of the detectives replied.
Pepper placed his personal laptop on his lap and he almost cried. He inhaled deeply through his nose and whispered, “Thank you…I…I will work on this…I can do this.” He pressed the button to have the bed push him up into a sitting position and opened the laptop. Two holoscreens opened on either side of the main screen. Sam’s old laptop from a prior century was a thing of the past and Tony dove into his work.
Steve complied with his wordless request and bent his head to met Tony’s desperate kiss. Tony’s mouth devoured him, wild and needy, and his free hand  at his scalp while the other continued knead their cocks together.
With his face pinching to hold back his tears, Steve swooped down and pressed a quick, hard kiss against his mouth. He didn’t prolong the kiss to let Tony breath but he did embrace him tightly.
“Here’s the plan,” he stated. “We’re going to split into three teams. Natasha and Clint. Sam and Coulson. And Tony and I. Hopefully, we will get to the carriers while they are down but if they go airborne, Sam and Tony can fly us out and Clint can use one of his grappling arrows to get the two of you out before the helicarriers go down. These chips need to go into the motherboard in all three helicarriers or this mission is lost. Are we all ready?”
Peter turned in Wade’s embrace and pressed his face into his neck. There was nothing more he could say. He was with the man he loved and, in his final moments, he wanted to be with him.
“Marking my territory,” Tony said, his voice rumbling in his throat, sending a thrill down his spine. He grinned possessively and raised the towel to wash him there. Steve motioned him to stop and Tony looked questionably at him.
“Thank you for including us,” Pepper whispered, gently grasping his hand.
“He has some stuff at my place already, but I’ll send Pepper by in a few days to pick up whatever more Peter might need.”
Very quietly, she murmured, “Let me go.”
Before Iron Man could answer, a large flying craft suddenly fell from the sky and hovered over the roof. A hatch opened and a sharp suited man stepped out. The man’s eyes instantly focused on Steve and he answered the question Steve had just asked, “Hello, Captain Rogers, and, to answer your question, SHIELD is the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division for the United States’ Government.”
Because it was fucking Hydra again.
Peter shoved his card in his pocket and grabbed the bag off the counter. He quickly stated, “He’s not. I’ll have to take a raincheck on that picture!”
Tony was stubborn and, when he wanted something, he poured all of his soul into achieving it. He wanted his soulmate and he did not want to wait until he was 40 to meet this person.
“He didn’t mean it like that!” Peter gasped. “H-He was just trying to help me. I almost tripped when I tried to open a door the wrong way. He was helping me straighten up.”
So I currently am really busy with my internship and I can make no promises when my chapters will come out. However, writing is my stress reliever so I will DEFINITELY be working on this in the meantime! XD
Steve slipped past Tony and stepped sharply on the edge of his shield, kicking it up into his hands. He looked back to Tony and said, “Can I get a ride?”
“I don’t know…” Bucky replied, closing his eyes as he nuzzled Steve’s calf muscle.
. They were happy.
“Fine,” Steve sighed heavily. “But, you will do it, won’t you? Give Wade that chance? I…” Steve dropped his head with a sigh and murmured, “I would ask you to promise me you’ll try but the last time you promised the same and we all saw how well that went…”
“You should move in with us,” Bruce said and Steve looked at him in surprise.
“Take a breather, Clint. You’ve been at this all day. I’m backing her up,” Stark piped from behind her.
“I know nothing about stars,” Steve pouted.
“We could go on a double date one of these nights,” Steve whispered in suggestion.
“You don’t have everything,” Fury finally retorted, making Tony switch focus from gazing lovingly at his fiancé to glaring at the SHIELD director. What’d he mean by that?
“My Tony…” Steve leaned in and lightly kissed his lips.
“Okay, good,” Bucky said  “Then I’m gonna leave before the going gets good.”
“Tony, you brought a Howling Commando into the house. One who everyone thought died 70 years ago until you found him in the middle of a coverup made by Hydra, an evil society everyone also thought dead! And he’s frozen in this thing in the middle of your lab! How – How are you going to get him out of there? Is he okay?”
Tony elbowed his side and murmured, "Shut up."
“We just want to make sure she’s ready to see you,” Pops murmured, running his hand over Peter’s head.
“Soon you won’t remember his name,” the Red Skull promised.
“Fine!! Just gimmie!!” Tony gasped, reaching wildly across the counter for the box.
Fingering the tightly threaded ribbons, Steve asked Phil, “Why give me the ribbons? They will tell people I served in World War II. It’ll help them figure out who I am faster. Isn’t that what you didn’t want?”
He closed his eyes and obliterated the nightmare.
“N-No more killing?” Peter gasped hopefully.
She spun around on the balls of her feet and left Tony. Tony watched her go with both surprise and confusion.
(See the end of the chapter for
The journey to Switzerland was uneventful as they moved through mostly protected territory.
Aunt May looked at Peter sympathetically from her place at the island and Steve got to his feet at the breakfast table.
He followed Bruce silently across the hall and into his lab. As soon as the doors sealed behind them Steve asked, “What is it?”
Her mate separated the distance between them and pressed the barrel of his gun into her forehead. He stated, “I need to tell my master why I had to
“I got you first,” Tony retorted briskly to Pepper and Steve sighed in relief. “Like I said we can’t stay here,” Tony added and Steve rolled his eyes.
“I think we can consider our relationship a celebration of all of that,” Steve whispered happily and began to card his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony leaned into his touch with a happy sigh.
“Yes, that’s Peter,” Steve gasped. “The Goblin did this to him, turned him this way.”
bears.
This was not a part of their act. This was just them.
Steve’s eyes widened as awareness blossomed in his mind. He gasped, “That high-pitch noise – but
It was not over just yet. They still had “evidence.”
we have to work together instead of against each other!” Steve tore off his helmet and vehemently countered, “If we don’t work together, then that chaos will overwhelm us. Together we are stronger.”
“Hey,” Bruce whispered. Tony’s head snapped over to his left. Bruce sat on Tony’s other side and looked exhausted. The dark bags under his eyes were so dark that it looked like it was caused by black eyes and not sleep deprivation. His face drawn and his skin seemed taunt.
“We can – should talk about it, I mean, it’s your life and I don’t –,” Peter began haltingly. He had felt stupid doing it over the phone and wished he'd waited until they were together-in-person when he brought it up.
Peter turned his attention back to the table and his father and aunt.
Steve nodded his thanks and went to rejoin the team but stopped as Wade spoke up.
She tightened her hold on her weapons and whispered, “We need to move out.”
,” Cable said with warning, returning to his side.
“Bucky!” Steve yelped in the background but he did not heed his friend’s warning.
“Because I am.”
Steve trailed his kisses upward as he replied, “Frozen mostly. Dead to the world until…” He paused in his kissing and leveled himself with Tony so he could look at him properly in the eyes. He whispered, “I was dead inside until I met you. You saved me, Tony.”
Peter chuckled and greeted the others as they streamed into the room. His bedroom at the Tower was bigger than his bedroom in Queens but it quickly felt smaller with all of the Avengers filling its space.
Steve hummed in agreement and stood, his towel falling to the ground now too…not that he’ll need it.
“Ok, not honey. How about sweetie pie?”
Steve followed the sound of the familiar voice and flinched when he saw Mary’s remains. She had been torn in two. Her top half was leaning against the wall and her lower half lay a few feet away. Her insides were not human but gear, wires, and metal bits and were strewn across the floor.
Thanks again for reading, as always, I will post a chapter in a week!
"That doesn't matter," Tony retorted bitterly. All Peter would focus on were the bad years...It was what everyone did...
Tony caught him alone in the hall after dinner and whispered, “Hey, uh, have you been checking the news sites?”
“This looks pretty set in stone. Glad to see you don’t leave me at the altar,” Tony observed, making Steve chuckle.
It felt weird flirting back in front of an audience, but Tony had already done it so he replied, “Not as nice as hazel.”
He almost lost him and that very moment nearly destroyed him.
He sat up and forced open his eyes and the world spun around him,
Tony’s head snapped back to Steve and he glared at him. He hissed, “This isn’t funny.”
“Why did you wait till just now, Jarvis,” Tony groaned. “Right now?! I made you to be intelligent to help me! This does not help! You could not wait a few more seconds?!”
“I am sorry that I hurt you but now that you are awake you should leave. Next time do not follow me,” Bucky stated.
For the press, all the Avengers shared small antidotes about Steve but it was nothing like the personal accounts they shared in the private ceremony but they exulted their friend’s courage and strength all the same.
“We only…”
He wasn’t sure, but he may had seen a flash of amusement in Bucky’s eyes for half a second.
His heart squeezed painfully as he looked at her. A year had gone by since her passing but it still hurt. He had only just recently had the heart to go out and be Spider-Man again. Before that he could barely look at the mask, much less wear it.
Tony’s grin slowly fell and then he whispered seriously, “Every time I close my eyes, I see Peter screaming at me.”
Steve scoffed and gasped, “Oh my God, I remember our clichés. I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing.”
Steve finally looked to his soulmate and Tony smiled sadly at him. He whispered, “You are not worthless to me, Steve. You are my soulmate, remember? You’re my other half and without you I’d be…incomplete …practically empty. And it’s destroying me to see you like this. What can I do to make it better?”
Tony snorted and retorted, “Unless you want to horde me away in your room, I can’t do that. I’m obviously not one of your soldiers, I’ll stand out like a sore thumb.”
“We were the ones who left you Howard Stark’s old notebook, making you able to find the Hydra time machine to find him. Everything was connected. We’ve almost reached the full circle,” Cable said, turning the gears on his time glove.
Steve went through the double doors and was instantly hit by strong winds that whipped the red comforter back and forth in his hold. Steve walked to the west corner of the Tower and looked over the edge.
The others nodded and Natasha grabbed Sitwell’s other arm and they propelled him to the roof access door with Cling bringing up the rear. Sam and Tony took off, going to straight to their getaway car.
!” Peter whined in terror, bobbing in the pool.
“I like my coffee black and bitter as tar,” Peter said with a grin.
Steve slowed to a stop as Jarvis’s statement dawned on him.
But that yearning tugged at his heart. He wanted to belong. He no longer wanted to be alone.
“Yes, but only once!” Tony repeated.
Bucky slipped past Steve before he could counter.
Steve followed Tony, buoyed by Tony’s hold on him, and he tightened his grip. Tony glanced behind him and saw a smaller more private smile on Steve’s face and it made Tony’s insides bubble excitedly.
In other words, he was no longer the strongest.
How long had he been gone?
Tony’s hazel eyes looked just like the eyes Peter stared at every day in the mirror.
The boys nodded but Stepan also frowned, clearly not happy by this fact.
Tony was shaking a little but it soon died down. He tucked his cold fingers under Steve’s arms and Steve grumbled unintelligibly at the sudden cold.
Natasha pressed her forehead to his and stared into his eyes. He stared back, entranced by her light green eyes. He could drown in those pools of algae for days.
He’d felt this way before, he knew what it was, but…but…
“Because
“Steve, you sure—?”
“Upon my creation, I would have said it was ridiculous,” Mary replied evenly and Steve opened his eyes to meet her gaze. Her face held no emotion but her gaze revealed a desolate continence.
“I’m sorry, I did not hear that,” Steve said to whoever was on the phone. Steve suddenly blanched and his wide eyes fastened on Tony. Steve whispered, “Peter? Is that you?”
Steve laughed and pushed the man along. Their meal consisted of fresh oatmeal with brown sugar and raisins, a slice of hot toast, a small cup of canned peaches, greasy bacon, and an uncracked, hard-boiled egg. Tony slowed to a stop, staring down at his tray. Steve bumped Tony with his hip to move him along and Tony did but he was still frowning at his tray.
The weirdest one was Natasha, who after learning about the contents of Steve’s “cure,” would sometimes watch Steve with a peculiar expression.
“Tony…I can see that both of you are hurting and I can tell that something was going on between the two of you…something most may have found improper,” Peggy stated, and Tony’s hands clenched. “I do not mean to alarm you,” Peggy assured him. “I won’t turn you or Steve in. I don’t think it is anyone’s business what you two get up to…yet, I can’t stand by when both of you are so obviously hurting. Steve won’t tell me anything but maybe you –.”
“This is going to bring Fury back down on us,” he groaned. “We just got SHIELD to leave us alone.”
Steve looked to him with pinched brows and Tony explained, “We haven’t touched yet.”
Peter was trembling beneath him with silent tears streaming down his face. Steve wiped them away with his thumbs and smiled sadly at Peter. With a thick voice, Steve continued, “Promise me you will continued to be strong. Promise me you will still ignore your sense and help others because it is the right thing to do. Promise me when you’re older you are going to use your powers for good. I know asking you to live a normal life is too much so join the Avengers and take everything we taught you to do good…And Tony…your Dad.” Steve’s breath hitched and felt tears prickle his own eyes. Steve whispered, “Please keep calling him ‘Dad.’ He’s as much as a father to you as I am…Let him be the one you look to whenever you need help, or your inspiration for your graduation speech, and mind him at your wedding he’s going to make a fool of himself.”
,” Uncle Bucky gasped, falling to his knees behind Peter.
The open door was immersed in shadows but there was no mistaking who it was who stood in its arch. Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull.
He opened his eyes only when he knew it was done and the scanner was lowering itself down.
“Imagine what I can do to you when you lose your pants,” Wade murmured into his mouth and this time it was Wade who stole a kiss.
“I wanted to know, what –,” Logan nodded to the trashcan sitting on Wade’s desk, “–is that?”
Howard clenched his fists, not wanting to upset his son further. But there was nothing he could do. The man Tony loved was dead and none of the power or wealth Howard had could change that.
“No,” Bruce said, placing a hand on Steve’s arm. Steve’s face was beet red and he was biting back a nasty retort. “It was Mary Parker. Hydra had kidnapped her and forcibly impregnated her with Steve’s sperm. They took it from him while he was still frozen. He had no idea what was going on. And Mary’s dead… So is Richard…”
“Then what’s your mission right now, solider?” Steve asked changing tactics and straightening out of his crouch into a commanding position.
“Yes,” Steve replied breathlessly.
Peter suddenly hugged him and gasped into Steve’s shoulder, “I’m so glad you two are alright too! When I saw you disappear…”
Tony turned the tablet to Steve and asked, “Who are they?”
,” Tony sobbed. “I love you so much, Peter. I’m sorry,
Bruce looked down and, in a lower voice, murmured, "You know, I tried...When I had the gauntlet and stones...I really tried to bring her back..."
Steve fell onto his side and sobbed, “
Stevie.
Smiling warmly at him, Steve replied, “I’m ready when you are.”
His entire demeanor changed before her eyes. He lost the cold, cutoff façade and looked…scared and confused. He dropped his gun and walked toward her. She raised the gun threateningly but he kept walking toward her. His dark blue eyes were focused on her face and he paid no mind to her gun. She placed her finger on the trigger with her muscles tense, ready to quickly jerk the trigger back.
“GABE!” Bucky hissed, ignoring the Brit as he scrambled over Tony.
Why was this happening to Steve now? What had triggered it??
From that day forward, whenever Steve saw a shooting star or blew out his candles on his birthday cake, he wished as hard as he could that his and Bucky’s implants would reset and their countdowns would begin.
“There’s a gift shop downstairs?”
I have read countless fics where he can do no wrong and it is Tony that is the one who creates drama or has doubts about their relationship. This is also why I made Peter Steve's son as well, because, Tony is also usually the father and Peter is born from an affair. This is a new realm I'm exploring and is going to be a difficult trek.
and he could not function with…
“Oh shush, Capsicle. I am going to be in an amazing mood the rest of the week, you better get used to it.
Steve’s hold tightened on him as his eyes widened and he gasped, “What??”
Steve separated himself from the others and positioned himself facing the sunset.
DUM-E was still sitting next to the car and dutifully pointed the fire extinguisher at the man and released the burst of fire squelching chemicals. Tony almost laughed aloud at the situation. Before the intruder could move, he coughed madly as he inhaled it and blindly staggered to his feet as he pitifully called out, “
When under the tutelage of the Red Room, Bucky had gone through grueling training. As the Winter Soldier, he had no opinion in the matter. He was commanded to do it and that was all that mattered. But Natasha was different. Like him, she did not have much of a choice in her training but she did not block out her feelings, in fact, she reveled in it. Training and the pain that came along with it was exciting to her and it was one of the first things that had drawn him out of his shell as the Winter Soldier.
He felt Venom try to manipulate his emotions again, only this time Peter pushed back. He yelled, “NO! I will not eat another person! A superhero doesn’t do that! A hero saves people! A hero doesn’t hurt people!”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Tony sighed. “Steve and I went big. Not only did we unleash the scoop of the century but we also had one of the most talked about weddings of the century and the press
Steve’s hand had remained on his shoulder to comfort him as he began to relay his story and he tightened his hold to reassure him of his presence.
“I know you,” he whispered to the Captain.
“If you think I’m going to just lay down and -,” Steve gritted, lunging toward Kilian.
Steve wanted to scream out his frustrations until his throat was bloody and destroy something until his fists were useless. No matter how good it felt he did not want this, he did not want Bucky. He wanted Tony and
“Me too,” Steve whispered. “I can’t wait…”
, we’re going to replace the reactor so Stark doesn’t die but first we need to collect the pieces and fix it.”
“What if I don’t want anything to do with the Academy anymore,” he whispered. Natasha tensed beside him and he continued, “Once this assignment is over, I have to return to my master and they will wipe my mind again.” He grasped her hand and gasped, “I
They both were filthy from their come but were exhausted from the long day and battle.  Tony could so easily fall asleep at that moment. Everything was back to normal. He was on Earth, no where near that portal, and Steve was in his arms. His eyelids were heavy and already struggling to stay open.
Eddie rose a single blond eyebrow and replied, “You and Mystery Scar Man?
When Tony reappeared he was still attached to the battery. Steve’s eyes zeroed on it immediately and Tony gruffly explained, “This thing is keeping me alive. I guess I’m stuck with it here too…it’s really unsexy.”
It also made it impossible for him to imagine a life without him moving forward.
They’d have a huge age difference, but Steve wouldn’t have minded...though his mate’s parents may have. Steve smirked sadly to himself. Not only did they have an age difference but they were both male. Both were social stigmas, not what the PR people would have wanted him to saddle with the image of Captain America…but he would have ignored their protests and would have done everything to be a part of this little guy’s life. With their age difference, there probably would've been no romance...but they could have been good friends. He closed his eyes and pictured helping raise him, bringing toys or snacks with every visit.
Wade smiled widely, stirring a pleasant warmth within Peter’s chest. He brought their faces together and they kissed with so much feeling Peter felt dizzy from its intensity.
Steve chuckled and ducked his head so his mouth was over Tony’s as he whispered, “I love you.”
“Put down the gun, boss,” Natasha gritted between clenched teeth and Bucky flinched. Steve saw his eyes widen and he lowered the gun a fraction.
“Okay, guys break it up. We got food going cold at the reception,” Bucky murmured, poking both of them in the shoulder.
“Hungry, son?”
So I was hoping to post this sooner but real life reared it ugly head and prevented that from happening! But here it is! The next chapter! It can't get any worse for the superfamily... or can it? Hmmmmm...
Tony sighed and said, “I was just thinking…”
It was the first time Steve was going to leave Tony alone for such a long period since they reunited...but he needed to be there for Bucky.
“I love you,” Bucky whispered reverently, his lips mere centimeters from Steve’s lips.
“I…used to know him,” Sneaky replied carefully, its voice neutral of any inflection.
“I remember that notebook,” Tony whispered. “I read about the base in it…and you described it containing a miraculous thing but…the remaining pages were missing…
The way I figure it, defrosting would not be too comfortable....
Steve expected to go home and sleep, with Tony snuggling into his side, instead they came home to anarchy.
“Definitely,” Steve promised warmly.
“So you’re here to help us?” Bruce gasped and Mary nodded her consent.
Next time: Ch. 4 Played for a Fool
“…Steve, can you let me hold Peter so the doctors can get a look at you?” Bruce asked tentatively.
He brightened his repulsors and then brought out his arm, shoulder, and even the thigh guns and launchers. It was a menacing sight that made the majority drop their weapons. Those few who initially did not drop their weapons did so when they saw the fight now was hopeless without the advantage of numbers…
Tony reached into his pants and touched himself, wanting to come with his mate. Steve pressed his forehead to Tony’s and cupped him outside of his jeans and helped rub him off.
“Okay, I was a colossal jerk,” Tony stated in defeat. In a serious tone, he reminded him, “I am still so very sorry…”
As Peter stretched him, he began stroke Wade’s dick and whisper horribly dirty and arousing things into his ear. He didn't think Peter had been capable of coming up with such filth nonetheless say it to him but Wade enjoyed it all the same.
“What happened?” Steve asked, uncurling from around Tony.
“I mean to do no more harm,” Mary stated to assuage the Director and maybe even Peter.
“Hey, don’t forget me,” Tony whined from his bed. Peter and Steve broke apart and he saw his dad was reaching out to him. Peter reached out too and clasped his father’s hand and, even though they were merely holding hands, Peter took comfort in its warm, calloused grip. Steve was alive, Wade was alive, his fathers were alive,
Tony flushed to himself as he imagined Steve with his lovers. Was he this gentle with them? An image of what he imagined flashed through his mind with Steve and a man with his face cast in shadow. They both were naked and Steve's hands were running over the other’s chest very similarly to what he was doing with Tony.
Tony pressed his face into Steve’s neck and murmured, “What the heck happened? Didn’t the Goblin crush my old reactor??”
“A lot of supes will be there,” Wade murmured with a shrug. “I can just be another one in the crowd.”
“I am your father!”
, Jarvis let’s make it a ten block radius. We are going to find whoever did this,” Tony growled.
“You are not permitted on the premises,” Jarvis’s familiar voice warned. “The authorities have been notified.”
Peter felt like an empty shell. Without Venom there to fight he suddenly had no purpose. He was too weak to do anything but lie next to his healing father and think.
“I can’t do this,” Tony gasped. He wanted a scotch instead. Scotch is good. Scotch does not get mad at you or is upset about being related to you. Scotch is only your friend, your amazingly, drinkable friend who makes you feel like you are on top of the world after enough sips.
But Steve knew he couldn’t do any of that right now without affecting the future. He had to wait for Tony’s sake. It was going to be the hardest thing Steve had ever done but he’d do it for Tony.
Even in the real world, he seemed unable to help Tony.
How did he and Tony come to this?
In the weeks that followed, Peter went through all the stages of grief. He prayed for his Pops to come back, he screamed at anyone who approached him and blamed them for what happened to Pops, and then he turned it around and blamed himself. His life seemed to be never-ending hurt and anger. His family stood by him the entire time and weathered through the abuse without complaint.
He closed his eyes and he could still picture his perfect super soldier in his mind’s eye.
Tony took a sip from his coffee and peered thoughtfully at Steve. He replied, “Sure.”
“No,” Peter groaned, pulling Wade back down for another kiss. With their bodies no longer moving together the pleasure that had build up was beginning to dwindle. When they broke apart again, Peter grumbled, “Let’s just stay in bed all day…”
“Me too,” Steve sighed, gently petting Peter’s soft hair.
“Yes,” Tony hissed the word like it was acid on his tongue. He still wasn’t looking up at Steve and it unnerved the super soldier.
Tony smirked at his fiancé and then nodded to the door, saying, “Down here.”
is this armor?”
Wade pooled all the snacks onto the foot of Peter’s bed and plucked a red-orange bag from the pile. “H-Here’s your selection, T-Tony, sir…sir.”
“Hmmm, would my alternative self still be this sexy?” Tony mused, biting down on his lip and wiggling his eyebrows suggestively at Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
“SHIELD has yet to post anymore information to their servers. However, it has been noted that Agent Coulson had been assigned the case.”
Steve nodded his thoughts dark despite the priest’s assurances.
Bucky must have somehow neglected to mention their relationship when they stepped out to talk. Steve flicked an annoyed glare in his best friend’s direction. He was probably trying to do it to protect him but if Gabe could keep Tony’s secret, he could just as easily keep Steve’s.
“Is he keeping it from you?” Natasha countered.
Upon Steve’s suggestion, Peter looked speculatively at Tony. At first, he seemed to do it only to humor them but as he studied Tony a change came over Peter. He originally had his hip jutted to the side and was tapping his foot but he suddenly straightened and stopped tapping. He squinted his eyes as if to fix his vision and then he opened his eyes so wide his eyes looked like they would pop out of his head. Alarm flooded his features. He wrapped his arms across his chest and his knuckles turned white from the tight grip he had on his arms.
