He turned over onto his side, staring bleakly out the window at the treetops and pale sky. His first year at university had included a few rough patches, but the second year had proven more difficult. It wasn't the academics; that part was easy. It was the people -- idiot classmates, pompous lecturers -- and the stupid rules.
He was lost in thought for a few more seco dis, remembering deep blue eyes and a muscular bare torso stretched out on a canvas cot when Anthea let out a low murmur of intrigue.
John grudgingly admired how she could blend motherliness and business, but had a question. “What about the other bloke? Shouldn't we meet?”
The fire had burned down to coals when John woke. His neck was stiff, his legs numb. As carefully as he could, he slipped out from under Sherlock, trying not to wake him. Still half asleep, he arranged a blanket over Sherlock before stumbling upstairs to his room. He hadn't eaten for hours but was past the point of hunger.
Sherlock took a small step closer, wanting to bring John back into his orbit. “When can I see you?” His voice was low and urgent. “I need to see you.”
I nodded tightly. I told myself I didn't care. My hand was throbbing. I stood up to go wait in the hallway.
Sherlock rubs his neck, aching from leaning over the microscope for hours. The lab is dim and cool and quiet -- quieter than usual, he notices, the number of squeaking shoes and rumbling carts in the hallway significantly reduced from a typical Monday night.
Mrs. Holmes seated herself regally in her chair, pulling the papers closer for inspection, giving him a faint nod. Sherlock knew he was dismissed.
Sitting alone in the dark flat, Sherlock is conducting a secondary experiment. He runs a finger down the thin, pinkish line on his forearm, the recently acquired scar from the knife blade. The confrontation that led to the scar was another misstep, a close call that could have been much worse. Someday his luck will run out.
I walk back to the mirror that hangs above the fireplace and turn up my shirt collar, looping the tie around my neck. I concentrate on making a decent knot, staring at my fingers, trying to get it right.
When he steps out minutes later, he sees Sherlock running his fingers over the top of the door frame, then sliding them down the length of curtains.
A brush of lips, a trace of whiskey and smoke, the chain biting into the back of his neck as Sherlock pulled him even closer.
Sherlock reached for John's laptop and hooked the strap over his shoulder. “Just passing the time. Welcome to New York.”
Sherlock couldn't hide the dismay that flashed over his face. He was already tired and sore from unloading the stones. John glanced at Sherlock for guidance.
It was stupid, really, to hope that Sherlock would ever consider him anything more than a friend. But, God, he couldn't turn off the constant thoughts he had about Sherlock, the slender fingers, long legs, clever brain, annoyingly sensuous mouth…
Without speaking, Sherlock switched off the lamp, pushed down his shorts, and climbed naked into John's lap, covering his mouth with his own, his arms around his neck, his body saying
“We can forget this ever happened. I swear I’ll stay away from you, if you tell me to go,” John said earnestly. He raised his eyes once more to Sherlock’s. “But I'd like to see you again… if that's what you want.”
John shrugs, unconvinced, and pulls the sheet up to his shoulder, laying his head back on the pillow. Sherlock spoons him, his mouth on the nape of his neck.
He shot an irritated glance back at her, and she returned his gaze, as smug as the cat who ate the cream. Mike was looking at him expectantly.
John makes a small grunt in protest, sleepily flexes his toes against the long, cold feet stealing his heat.
My family seemed to be made of secrets. There was my mother, of course, whose shadowy existence I wanted to keep at a distance. If she didn't want to think about me, I didn't want to think about her.
He had calculated John’s reaction correctly. Somewhere in his mind, he wondered if he had judged his own motives as accurately.
John plucked a blade of grass and studied it. “That's why I like medicine. We can stop death, or at least delay it.”
“Oh, the soap... It was something extra Greg had, one of those hotel soaps.” John pocketed his phone, realizing that he'd been gripping it tightly.
They drew apart, eyes lifting, gazes meeting, agreeing, mouths slotting together again, venturing deeper. A shift of bodies, a step back, John's arse hitting the edge of the sink, the empty bottles clinking encouragingly.
He stood for a long moment, then pulled out his phone. He held it, his fingers still stiff with cold, and pecked out a simple message.
Sherlock moves around the house the following day as if in a dream, staring out the window at the frosty garden or stretched out on the sofa with an unopened book on his lap. He barely eats anything, his tea forgotten on the table and going cold.
“Oh.” Sherlock hid his face by taking a sip of tea. He was too worn out to determine if John was telling the truth. He had no idea if he'd only dreamed Victor was in his room or if he had somehow mixed John into his fantasy. It had felt so real, the tender stroke of fingers and quiet reassurances.
John navigates unsteadily to the library lined with books and overstuffed armchairs. He pours a generous portion of scotch and takes a gulp. He exhales, knowing Sherlock will be behind him any minute.
Sherlock bloody Holmes, the pompous pretty boy who seemed to dog every step of his career, matching him paper for paper, presentation for presentation, accolade for accolade. They’d been advancing along the same trajectory for years, trading sharp criticisms and barbs through commentaries and journal editorials. Sherlock was brilliant but a loose canon, his approach to forensics seemingly cavalier, but always based on sound science with an irritating sprinkle of intuition or something akin to reading people’s minds. John’s own method was much more conventional, relying on solid data and evidence. He was methodical, Sherlock was a dramatic whirlwind. They were like oil and water.
Together they unbuttoned John's shirt, slipped it from his shoulders, tugged away his shorts, the notepad sliding ignored to the floor. They clung together, John rolling Sherlock onto his back.
“For God’s sake, I’m not going to break into your computer.” John was offended, but couldn’t help but notice how Sherlock’s polished shoes gleamed in the light. The man had huge feet that still managed to look elegant on his long legs. It really wasn’t fair that one person could be so attractive yet so annoying.
John’s hands circle around Sherlock’s waist, roaming to the small of his back, his hips, his buttocks.
After a few more strokes, John finds a rhythm, tilting Sherlock's head, adjusting the angle, hearing the rasp, rinsing the razor in the sink. He goes slowly, working deliberately. He is attuned to the blade in his hand, aware of the vulnerable skin under his fingers. He will not cause a nick or cut; he will do this as carefully as surgery.
He worried that he couldn’t remember precisely what Sherlock looked like. He had a good impression, of course, enough to dream about and wank off to, but the fine details -- the exact color of his eyes, the number of freckles on his neck, which cheek dimpled when he smiled -- evaded him.
Pleasantly surprised by John’s reaction, Sherlock straightens the items littering his desk, not knowing what else to do while John examines the other photos.
In counterpoint, John silently wondered about Sherlock's oft-stated vow to devote himself solely to his work -- after all, he had been the one to instigate the kiss by the fireplace last evening. John smiled a little, finally able to see through Sherlock’s hyperbole. He had his flaws and needs and weaknesses, just like everybody else.
He’s surprised to find Sherlock gazing at him, a soft smile playing on his lips. “Well done,” Sherlock says, his voice velvety. “You captured it in a very… evocative way.”
Sherlock inhaled sharply at the contact, stirring John’s senses even more. Their hands and mouths roamed, the small space filling with the sounds of their heavy breathing and wet kisses.
matter.” He looked up, meeting Sherlock’s eyes. “I should have said this long ago. I'm sorry.” He swallowed hard. “I’m sorry I hurt you. I’m sorry… for all of it.”
“‘I’m going to take you apart,” John promised huskily. “I’m going to work you until you melt under my mouth,” two fingers skimmed to the dip in Sherlock's throat, resting lightly in the hollow, “and then we’ll fuck and fuck until we both explode into a million hot stars.”
John looks impressed. “I’ll make a note of that.” His gaze goes to the case wall. “And your consulting detective business… you get all your cases through Scotland Yard?”
Melancholy settled into his bones. All those memories were from long ago. Change and loss were inevitable.
Sherlock swallowed, the impending distance between England and India all too real. “It's a three-week sail, isn't it?”
“I can't figure it out. God knows I've tried…” John laughs mirthlessly. “I don't know how to make it work.” He catches Sherlock's gaze and holds it. “Me, you… Liv.” He leaves the rest unsaid.
Sherlock flips on the light switch, causing one weary bulb to cast a meager, yellowish glow in the oversized closet. There are a few cast-off file cabinets and printers, shelves lined with dusty boxes, an outdated microscope draped in opaque plastic, abandoned flasks and beakers, and two human skeletons hanging from wooden stands mounted on wheels. It’s possibly the most depressing room John has ever seen.
The conference hotel wasn’t hard to find. Sherlock loitered in the lobby, waiting until John’s talk was over, hanging at the back of the room until John answered a few additional questions and autographed his latest book for an admirer.
Sherlock finishes up and slips on his jacket, then leads the way through the door to the elevator. They don’t talk as they make their way outside, although Sherlock notices John keeps pace with his long stride despite his limp.
They stood for a moment, chests rapidly rising and falling. Sherlock's robe had fallen open across his torso, barely hanging onto his left shoulder, barely concealing anything below his navel. John was naked to his waist, barefoot, jeans crumpled down low on his hips.
“You did the right thing coming here,” Dimmock said reassuringly, swayed by their tale. “I'll take care of it.”
Highly aware of Sherlock sitting just a few feet away, John closed his eyes for a moment, recalling the night they had spent in his bed. They had come so close to fucking -- that sounded so crude, but a more delicate term didn’t come to mind -- but hadn’t. He sensed Sherlock wanted to, but something had held him back.
Sherlock clutched the sheets under his chin, his eyes straining and failing to find the faint outline of the bedroom door. Mycroft must have deliberately switched off the hallway light as well.
Their conversation faded as they neared the village, several cars and bicyclists weaving around them.
His hands moved uncertainly to John's waist, steadying himself, his fingers curling tighter when John's lips brushed the corner of his mouth.
He needs John's touch, wants every part of him, but gradually, in increments over many days. Sherlock rolls onto his back, pulling John on top of him. Right now, he wants to be surrounded by John, submerged, wants his weight to settle over him like the ocean, pinning him down, stilling his quicksilver mind.
I paused again, suddenly feeling a rush of fondness toward Sherlock. Under all that gruff arrogance was a very human heart. “I just want you both to be happy. You deserve it.”
He should have known that. It's the logical conclusion, a completely normal development. But he never expects normal anymore. He’s been through too much. Damaged badly. He still has trust issues. Enough to fill a book.
“For once, no. It’s more of a social emergency.” I explained that my friend Emma was getting married in a month and had asked me to be a bridesmaid. I sighed. “I’ve been putting it off, but now I’m running out of time. I have to dance. Like an actual waltz with some groomsman I’ve never met. Can you teach me?”
"Awake?" John asked as he pushed the door open wider with his shoulder, a mug of tea in one hand, a bowl in the other.
“I was stupid, saying it that way. I just… I just don’t know what to do. I don't know what the right answer is.” John waited for a response. “Sherlock? Are you still there?”
John smiles. “One day Orion went hunting with the goddess Artemis, a great huntress, and he boasted that he’d kill all the animals in the world. That made the earth goddess very angry.” John pauses, concentrating on a stitch.
Sherlock was surprised that John wanted to bring up that conversation, but dismissed it. “It's fine.”
John checked into the hotel, a refurbished older building with marble floors and gilded accents managing to blend nicely with the modern decor. The two slow-moving elevators were quite small, revealing the hotel’s true age. He exited on the fifth floor and found the room, slotted the key card into the door, and entered.
Sherlock's heart hammered, his body hypnotized under John's heavy lidded gaze, and he closed his eyes against the too intense moment just before their lips touched in a gentle, testing kiss.
He turns on his heel and crosses the sitting room to his desk. He lifts a few papers, attempts to sort them, then can’t resist glancing out the window. He sees them, the tops of their heads, John’s outstretched arm hailing a cab, Olivia twirling absently around the base of a lamppost, her dark blonde ponytail swinging behind her.
John stood up and went to his desk again, trying not to think about how he'd been splayed over it, moaning, pinned down by Sherlock's lithe body -- just focus, open the damn laptop, look him up, and get a grip. Where was the bloody thing? He lifted a stack of papers, pulled open the desk drawer. Had he moved it? Must be on the dresser.
“I do get out of the morgue every now and then,” she joked. “I'm visiting my parents for Christmas. But you knew that already. I mean, it's the same every year, isn't it?”
Sherlock's voice was raspy, lower than normal, deep enough to send a shiver of aural pleasure up John's spine. He turned back.
Sherlock stood and walked into the house, knowing that John would trail after him. Sherlock retrieved his violin case from its spot in the sitting room. After a few moments of tuning, Sherlock tucked the instrument under his chin and closed his eyes, hearing the music, seeing the notes in his mind’s eye.
“You’ll lead, so arms up, like so,” Sherlock took his place opposite of John and arranged their limbs. “This hand here, and this one here, and lock your frame -- oh, do put some effort into it, John. Elegance.”
Sherlock filled him in on his parents, Maria, all of whom were well, then sketched out his advanced coursework in archaeological chemistry. “It’s a bit of a specialty,” he explained, already seeing the question on John’s face. “It’s applying analytical chemistry to artifacts -- pottery, bones, textiles -- to determine what vessels held, what people ate, patterns of trade... I’m boring you.”
As they progressed through the hives, they refilled the smoker several times. Mr. Holmes went on with details about drones and worker bees, pollen and nectar, mites and predators until Sherlock's head was buzzing like the honey bees they were tending.
Sherlock doesn’t feel the covers being lifted up to his shoulders, the lingering touch on his forehead. He doesn’t hear John’s final whispered words.
John kissed his nape again, pressing his pelvis into Sherlock’s thighs, wending both hands under his shirt. He ran his palms slowly up every ridge and slope of ribs and chest until his fingers reached Sherlock’s nipples, teasing them to tight buds, a whimper slipping from Sherlock’s lips, his hands gripping the edge of the sink.
He turned to Sherlock, pulling him close, their hips touching, his face upturned. They stood for several moments bathed in the fading twilight, searching each other’s eyes, difficult words left unspoken.
Without opening his eyes, John knew it was morning. He could hear birds chirping, the heat from the rising sun starting to warm the room. He was almost awake, but drifted in semi-sleep for a little longer, remembering flashes of details from the night before.
Sherlock moves back in his chair as John seethes at him. “We've been doing this a long time, you and I, and now you're doubting me?”
A few black and white photos line the walls, a vanity table holds hair ties and lipsticks. A small television perches on the dresser top.
He looked up at Mycroft, who had discarded his jacket and sported an ivory waistcoat. Sherlock wordlessly handed him his cigarette case and lighter, lacking the energy to point out that Mycroft rarely smoked.
His words were the tripwire that set Sherlock off, his body seizing under John's hands, strands of creamy come striping the dark surface of the table, a low groan vibrating through his chest.
He stared at the ceiling, picturing Molly clinging to John’s shoulders, grinding her hips against his as the music thumped around them. Maybe John was fucking Molly right now, her legs wrapped around his waist.
He knew Sherlock visited porn sites -- they were in the browser history on John's laptop, sites he himself had not looked up. Men on men, perfectly waxed and toned, some with elaborate tattoos. Maybe Sherlock liked tattoos...
John couldn't help but grin, tucking his smile into the curve of Sherlock’s neck, tasting his skin, pushing in and out in a silky rhythm. Sherlock -- or maybe it was him-- moaned again, their bodies moving in sync.
Sherlock looked up at him, his face a mixture of defiance and vulnerability. “We’re supposed to hate each other,” he said, confused, angry, needy.
John glanced to his left to see who had spoken. He first saw the long brown hair, then the pretty eyes and warm smile, then recognized Sarah, a professor of internal medicine. They’d met while serving on the same curriculum development committee. He straightened up, extending his hand. “Sarah, how are you?”
I hunched on the metal chair in the hallway until I heard familiar quick footsteps tapping on the linoleum.
This time, Sherlock vows, this time they will have decades together instead of weeks or months. His happiness brims over as he lightly places his lips on John’s forehead.
He quickly showered and shaved, then headed to his room for a change of clothes. As he dressed, the quiet motions took him back to the early mornings in the army, buttoning up his uniform for the long hours ahead.
Sherlock is drowning in sensations, the heavy, quickening strokes of John's cock setting every nerve in his lower body on fire. The pajamas are bunching up, pulling in tender places, a seam biting his inner thigh, but it just adds to the building tension, a tiny bit of pain to contrast with the pleasure. His body grows taut, nipples peaked, cock ripe, aching to spill. He half opens his eyes, needing to see John's face.
John shifted, breathed out, his nerves still on edge. This was not how he had planned to spend the afternoon. Sherlock had surprised him, insistent, overriding his objections. Deep down, he knew Sherlock was right. This was long overdue.
John’s eyes widened. He hadn’t seriously considered it before, but the way she was smiling at Sherlock now …
Sherlock slipped his fingers between them to wrap around John’s shaft, smearing the fluid over the tip with his thumb. “Come for me.”
As he rode into the village beside Molly, Sherlock kicked himself for being so aloof. He shouldn't have said anything about editing his mother's book; he hadn't even approached her about it yet. Everything had just tumbled uncensored from his mouth in some misguided attempt to impress John. Meeting him, feeling the confidence in his firm handshake and direct gaze, seeing the flask juxtaposed with the medical text, piecing together his story in rapid sequence -- it rattled him.
John shifts slightly, and Sherlock can tell he’s holding his cock in his hand, about to guide it between his arse cheeks. Sherlock welcomes the pressure and stretch, the sensation of John sinking into his body, merging into one being.
John took this in, trying to sort out his tangle of feelings, amazed that Sherlock was admitting this to him.
There's not even time to answer before Sherlock pushes himself off of John and disappears inside the house. He soon returns, a lit candle in one hand, a bottle of lube in the other.
Sherlock hums approvingly and brushes his lips over John's before breaking away to go shave and change into dry clothes.
Now he stood naked, curve of flank and bumps of spine flashing in a corner of the mirror. He glanced up, the tired face staring at him in the glass momentarily unfamiliar.
“And then what?” Sherlock dipped his mouth to John's neck, the dressing gown migrating off one shoulder.
He looked up again when Sherlock called his name. He had moved a dozen yards downstream and was standing along the bank, gazing at something by his feet.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut harder, certain that something was watching him from the end of the bed, a panic rising in his chest.
Caught off guard, John fumbled with his cup. “I wasn’t –  I mean, I just noticed – you’ve a hole in your shirt.”
He has to resist the urge to rut against John or it will be over much too soon. Sherlock lifts his mouth away from John's to refocus and finds himself falling into deep blue eyes.
Sherlock felt his pulse quicken. He had seen men’s bodies before, of course; life at boarding school and university made it unavoidable. But those were quick glances while dressing or in the shower room; anything longer would earn you an unsavory label, or worse.
Now that they had found their positions, John began pumping his hips, his other arm looping around Sherlock's chest for stability. It felt amazing, his cock buried between Sherlock's thighs, surrounded by the pressure of hot, oiled skin. He built up to a rapid thrust, the tension of being discovered heightening his arousal.
Sherlock smiles at the bad pun. “Time to go home then, and warm up.” He rises to his feet and offers John his hand.
Icy raindrops tap against the window panes, waking Sherlock from a deep slumber. He opens one eye, takes stock of the dark grey early morning, and burrows deeper under the covers. It's chilly in the bedroom, so he wriggles closer to John’s warm back, slides his bare feet under John's.
John’s eyes snapped to Sherlock in surprise, then back to Molly. She hadn't mentioned that particular fact. She was so bubbly, he had a hard time picturing her living in a somber funeral home. His gaze fell to the package.
“Okay.” Molly fiddles nervously with the clipboard. “Um, I was wondering if you’d want to get a coffee —” Molly is interrupted when the double doors swing open and someone walks in. It’s a doctor in a white coat, a stethoscope slung around his neck. Sherlock barely glances up, returning his attention to the corpse.
John waited until he could see an impatient tic in Sherlock's jaw, then pushed his jeans and pants down his thighs, past his calves, and stepped free from the crumpled fabric. He stood up slowly, his hands loose at his sides, and tilted his head, silently daring Sherlock to remain impassive.
John smooths his hand over the back of the plump reading chair in front of the fireplace. “It could do quite nicely.” He glances up at Sherlock. “And where’s your bedroom?”
They look at each other for a moment, and he's sure his face is betraying something that he can't control.
Ever notice how John never gets to drive in the show? So I wondered how driving lessons might go if Sherlock taught him... let the innuendo begin.
“Actually,” Molly continues thoughtfully, “there should be two skeletons up there. John, would you mind bringing down the other one?”
The last thing he wanted was someone else underfoot. He was perfectly content with his solitude. Everything was how he liked it -- his things remained where he put them, his schedule was at his whim, his consumption of certain stimulants and narcotics was his own business. He did not need people meddling with his life.
The disaster that John feared would be unleashed by admitting his deepest feelings for Sherlock never happens. In fact, John discovers over time, it only strengthens their relationship.
He turned his gaze onto John. He was unshaven and looked like he hadn't slept since he'd seen him last night. Sherlock remained standing, not seeing another chair to sit in.
The click of a lock turning behind him made him swivel quickly, practically crashing into Sherlock. But Sherlock was ready, catching John up in his arms, folding him into a heated embrace.
He was better off being alone. It was much more conducive to work, and work was all that mattered now.
They drank each other in, transported by the moonlight and night songs of the crickets, the rich smells of water and earth enveloping them.
Dimmock looked uneasy. “Do you think that Molly’s sweet on him? They've known each other a long time.”
John’s lips part, struggling to find a long unused voice. “I kept waiting. Until I couldn’t leave.” His words are raspy and halting, as if remembering a forgotten language.
Sherlock moved into the room, shutting the door behind him, shedding his coat and tossing it over his chair. “We didn’t have a chance to finish our talk.”
Swimming cleared his mind and worked his bad shoulder, strengthening the muscles and increasing its range of motion. John had been coming to the pool regularly, and he felt fitter than he had in years. The tremor in his hand was only intermittent now, and his leg was completely pain free.
Sherlock scathingly rejected most clients, but every so often he'd accept a case. John couldn't discern a pattern to which requests for help Sherlock chose over others, but then he didn't really understand much about Sherlock anymore. There really were entire days he went without speaking, and others when he would not shut up.
He barely registers the glittery flecks of fire dancing around the bed, can only note how odd it is before his pent-up body takes over, striving for release. He clutches John's arse, tips his hips up, seeking, grinding, throbbing, coming with an intense pulse.
“Why the hell are you here, Holmes?” John snarled, annoyed by Sherlock’s tight shirt, tailored suit, and carefully coiffed hair. Sherlock was well-known for his attention to style, but no one dared mock him for it, unless they wanted to risk verbal evisceration. There was also a rumor that he was an excellent boxer.
They fall into silence and the water rumbles. They've talked everything to exhaustion the past week. Everything easy, that is. There are things John hasn't said, difficult conversations they haven't broached. But John isn't ready, not yet.
Sherlock tried to gather what was left of his dignity. “I’ll walk you out, John.” He turned his back on Mycroft and strode out of the library, John close on his heels.
Sherlock glances at the bedroom clock. Nearly five in the morning. The stitches itch and he has to resist scratching his arm. Thirteen stitches, to be precise. Must be his lucky number, he thinks ruefully.
“I think,” Sherlock ventured, “that you should come back to London with me. With your medical knowledge and photography skills, you could be very useful.”
Sherlock bristled. “My theory was quite sound. Clearly, there are no such things as ghosts. The only reasonable explanation involved an elaborate scheme perpetrated by a group of individuals united by—”
The scenery moved past them in slow motion, the creak and sway of the carriage a soothing antidote to the city’s fast pace.
She was even-tempered and never flustered, which made her an excellent nurse, but sometimes her acceptance of all things -- good and bad -- irked John. When he wanted to rant against politics and incompetence and the bloody long rainy season, Mary would shrug and say there was nothing to be done about it. She would turn back to her embroidery or book and find peace in stitches and words, and he would gnaw on his anger, dissatisfied.
There was an impatient knock at the bedroom door. “Are you still primping in there?” John called out.
Pushing down his disappointment, Sherlock drops his bag onto the floor and switches on a lamp. He hangs up his coat then stretches out on the sofa with a deep sigh, his back aching from being cramped in the airplane. He closes his eyes, resettling his neck against the pillow.
We snogged and occasionally had sex -- quick and furtive and quiet as possible if his parents were home; slower and softer and giggly if they were away. It was a bit ironic, how all this secrecy paralleled my dad’s private life.
Sherlock remains silent, hesitant to admit she’s probably right. He feels foolish, allowing his imagination to overwhelm his normally rational brain. Ghosts and killers and blood stains... He rubs his eyes, exhausted.
John breathed against Sherlock's skin, still drifting in the haze of their union. “Sherlock…” he whispered his name, afraid of dispelling the dreamy atmosphere and losing his courage if he spoke too loudly, “I need to tell you something.”
He skimmed through the previous day's paper while the kettle boiled, then finally sat down with his plate of toast and mug of tea. He took a cautious sip, the tea sweet and strong, followed by a bite of warm bread and berry jam.
“He’s doing quite well,” his father said, sliding the conference brochure across the breakfast table to Sherlock, then vanishing behind his newspaper again.
Later that night, Sherlock sits on the edge of his bed in his dressing gown, resting for a moment before changing into pajamas. His hair is damp from the shower, a droplet of water running down his nape. He’s tired and his body aches. Sleep beckons even though it’s barely nine o’clock.
They fall silent. Sherlock tentatively puts his palm on John's chest, feeling the warmth emanating through his T-shirt. John responds by draping a hand over Sherlock's hip.
If you've made it this far, hello! So this my latest project that I've (foolishly?) decided to post as a work in progress. I'm challenging myself to write longer form this time, which is kind of scary for someone who gravitates to short stories. Life is busy, I'll do my best to post regularly, and, by god, I will finish what I started. Thanks for coming along for this summer slow burn!
“Sherlock… there's no easy way to do this. Please, don't be angry.” John reached his hand out to touch Sherlock's arm, but Sherlock shrugged it away.
Their shirts are gradually discarded, and John kisses the freckles dotting the long neck above him. Busy fingers unbutton and unzip trousers, work them down and off. Shadows dance over bare skin as Sherlock guides John to where he wants him -- sitting with his feet on the flagstones and his back against the couch -- and straddles him.
Fifty-seven days had passed since he'd last seen Sherlock, longer than the promised month of separation. He had heard nothing during all that time, and had started giving up hope, spending far too much time drinking moodily in the bar.
“Calm down. Molly will soon realize we’re gone and will come looking for us,” Sherlock reasons. He watches John mutter and pace in front of the door. “Are you claustrophobic?”
John’s mouth clamps into a straight line, his temper piqued. He calms himself and takes another breath, determined to prove he’s not an idiot. He pauses, then slowly reveals his observations.
“You’re shaking,” John whispers, unsure if it’s the cold or his touch that’s causing Sherlock to tremble. His own hand is unsteady, every hope and fear wound into these few strands of time. He’s forgotten how to breathe.
John walked on to the changing room, looking forward to a swim. The pool was located at Sherlock's rather unorthodox club, a facility that, in addition to the gymnasium, also housed a bar, dining room, and gaming room.
Sherlock tapped his chin. Chairs. He could use two comfortable chairs near the fireplace. Maybe some prints for the walls. But first he would have to clear out the boxes. He dipped a hand into an open carton and lifted out a stack of books, barely glancing at their spines before slotting them into a sturdy bookshelf that flanked the fireplace.
He gently slipped his fingertip in, and Sherlock bit his lower lip, his hands flexing where they lightly grasped John's hips. He pushed his finger a little deeper, going slowly.
It was early, so he dozed a little longer, pulling the covers up around their shoulders, snuggling his feet into the pocket of warmth at the foot of the bed, relishing the pressure of Sherlock’s knees pressing into the back of his thighs.
“I would very much like to touch you right now.” John’s voice was barely audible, but he knew Sherlock heard him from the way his eyes darkened.
John studied Molly's face. Something in the set of her mouth was wistful, her brown eyes a little less bright. John couldn't stop himself from speaking his thoughts out loud. “You have feelings for him, don't you?”
They stepped inside the studio, a bell jingling above the door. Soon a stout woman in her 30s emerged from the back of the store, wiping her hands on a towel. Sherlock caught the scent of chemicals used to develop prints.
“Fine.” Sherlock steeples his fingers under his chin and closes his eyes. “Candle shop… candle shop…”
The coat fell open, pale skin glowing in the light, magnificent chest and thighs and belly carved like marble.
It’s something else -- something he’s carried with him since being shot, since seeing Sherlock fall from that roof, since Mary’s betrayal -- fear. Terror, if he’s honest, of losing control, of being swept away and devastated again by someone else’s actions. He can’t expose himself like that again, won’t let Liv be pulled under by the dangerous currents that swirl around the edges of Sherlock’s life.
The fireplace is mysteriously lit again, shadows licking the walls. A quick scan reveals that no one is in the room, nothing obviously overturned or out of place. He flicks on the light switch, but nothing happens. Bad fuse, faulty wiring, paranormal interference, he doesn’t know anymore.
He pondered this until the massage ended. The masseuse draped the bathrobe around his shoulders and he thanked her, then headed for the changing room, feeling loose and pleasantly sore. Sherlock had finished a few minutes earlier and was presumably changing as well.
“You knew that would happen.” John pointed at him accusingly. “You did that on purpose this morning, distracting me like that.”
Sherlock pulled the door of the study shut, filled with an odd mix of emotions about his mother’s compliment, Mycroft’s impending arrival, and the thought of John meeting his family. Their carefully drawn boundaries might soon become uncomfortably blurred. He didn't know what might happen. He didn't like not knowing.
Looking closer, he’s startled to see a knife handle protruding from a bookshelf. He cautiously approaches, noting the way the blade is plunged between two thick books.
Standing before the wardrobe mirror that evening, he pulled on a navy blue jacket and striped blue tie in preparation for dinner. He adjusted his shirt collar and tugged at the sleeves, feeling like he might snap.
Sherlock slid the frame back into place, wishing there was some way to store up warm afternoons and starry nights, slow caresses and languid kisses. The autumn loomed ahead like a grey canvas, empty and lifeless.
He sidles up to the food and inspects the cupcakes, crisps, marshmallow ghosts, chocolate eyeballs, and other salty and sugary treats. He sneaks several chocolates and a ginger biscuit, then sniffs at a bowl of ominous-looking red punch, detecting vodka and tequila. An unfortunate combination.
John opened and closed his mouth, speechless for a few moments. “But when would we leave? Where would we stay?”
He turns off his phone. Tomorrow he will drive up to visit his parents. He's not sure if he's looking forward to it or not. He's not sure of anything anymore.
Warmth floods through Sherlock’s chest, releasing him from his stupor. He places the pipette back in the beaker, his hand shaking. He hopes he’s managing to hide the flurry of emotions churning inside of him. Despite his inner turmoil, a smile plays over his lips. “It’s possible.”
His expression shifted from surprised to grateful to nodding speechlessly. He fumbled open a box of condoms, his hands shaking a bit.
John nudges Sherlock's chin an inch higher, angles the razor just under his jaw. The familiar face has re-emerged, lean cheekbones and full lips. It's just the scruff under the jawline and neck, and they'll be done.
“I don't expect anything. But you… Maybe you ought to have more. With someone you don't have to hide.”
I paused outside the door to the kitchen to let my eyes adjust. Sherlock and Dad were sitting across from each other at the table. They were both in shirt sleeves, collars open, shoes off. At ease.
“You’re freezing,” Sherlock murmured, not quite meeting John’s eyes as he took his coat and hung it up. “Come sit by the fire.”
John nods, both relieved and ashamed that Sherlock knows his weakness. He would try to do better, would try to control his irrational thoughts and be the steady partner Sherlock needs.
In many ways, it would just be better if he moved out and left Sherlock to his work. They would both adjust. They weren't dependent on each other; they weren't an old married couple, for God’s sake.
“Er, yes.” He can hear Mycroft flipping through the folder contents. “Actually, you bear a striking resemblance to him.”
He rolled the cigarette between his fingers. “I’m not -- ” he stopped, his eyes trained on something far away. “I overlooked something today at the warehouse. That shouldn't have happened.”
Sherlock leans one shoulder against the wall and stays several feet away from John. His own keys jingle slightly in his hand.
During their past few meetings, they hadn't managed more than heavy snogging and a few quick handjobs, the logistics for anything else never quite in their favor. John's gaze now lingered on Sherlock's mouth, imagining, as he had so many times, those plush lips snugging around his cock.
The doors slid open and they stumbled out, still groping, fumbling for a key card, clumsy as two drunks spilling into the room lighted only by the city’s glow through the open curtains.
“Love. Oh, don’t roll your eyes at me like that. Think about it. People would do almost anything for someone they love.”
Harry moved out when she turned 18, leaving John to care for his mother and despise his father more. They fell out of touch, seeing each other only at Christmases. The last time he saw her was two years ago. She looked unwell, thin and sallow. It didn’t take long to discover that she had turned to drinking, too.
My eyes were misty and my throat was choked with too many emotions to speak. It felt wonderful to be my father's priority, and it felt horrible to be the wedge still keeping him apart from Sherlock.
They've been here nearly three years. Surprisingly, he's never bored. The bees have been a fascinating venture. He's been composing a few violin pieces, enjoying long rambles with their dog Stamford, swimming in the little cove below the house when the weather is warm. And of course, there is John's second book he's working on about some of the more interesting cases.
When John awoke the next morning, he squinted at his watch, then snuggled back into the pillow. It was only eight o’clock. Then it struck him — he was in Sherlock’s bed, thoroughly naked. He turned over, only to find the other half of the bed was empty.
Sherlock slid the newspaper from under his mother's plate and quickly scanned the article for the facts: a male hiker in his 30s had been found dead in a meadow about three miles outside the village yesterday morning. A farmer had come across the body and summoned the local police. The name of the victim had not yet been released, pending positive identification and notification of next of kin. The police were not ruling out foul play, according to Police Constable Ian Dimmock.
He turned, presenting John with the plate in one hand, a steaming cup of coffee in the other. He smiled, then his eyebrows rose in surprise.
John's gentle restraint grew more insistent, his hips driving harder, faster, responding to Sherlock's cues. Sherlock clutched at John's back, his fingernails telegraphing
Outside on the patio, John thanked him for showing him the ruins, then added a thought. “I’m going into town tonight to meet some friends at the cafe. Do you want to come?”
He reaches into the drawer of the bedside table and takes out the diary and photographs, suddenly fearful that everything has vanished. Thankfully, the images and words remain, mementos to be treasured.
After dinner, Sherlock started the waltz lesson, trying to drill into my head the concepts of three beats, making the shape of a box, quarter turns, and not looking down.
Dazed, Sherlock closes the journal, wiping away a tear that threatens to spill down his cheek. He stares into the fire, seized with sorrow and longing, unsure what year it is, if he’s William or Sherlock or some blend of both.
Sherlock frowned. He generally ignored anything that wasn't crime-related, but he was vaguely aware of the worldwide financial crisis.
“A bedsit. It’s tiny and depressing, but it’s the only thing I could afford in the city. Not very inspiring for writing.”
“Thanks,” John says with relief. As he reaches for his phone their fingers brush, sending a shiver up Sherlock’s arm.
The bottle tips over with a crash, rolls toward the edge of the table, scotch glugging onto the surface. John’s free hand shoots out to stop the container before it smashes onto the floor, sets it upright. The bottle is ice cold. John lifts his hand quickly as if he's been burned.
Two plates heaped with a full breakfast steamed on the table. Mrs. Hudson, it seemed, had just popped in with one of her delicious fry-ups that she often spoiled them with.
Sherlock’s fingers spider their way down John’s shirt, plucking open button after button. He wants to feel John’s skin against his own, warm and charged with mysterious energy. He pushes the shirt open, running his hands down John’s chest, taking in the bristle of hair, the planes of muscle, the curve of ribs.
John picked up another stone and turned it in his hands. “I suppose Hollywood sounds more glamorous than a logging town in Oregon.”
He wondered what John was doing at this moment, if he was awake and staring at the same sliver of moon. There hadn't been a letter from John in months, just a Christmas card with a few lines. He'd sent a card as well, a quick note dashed inside. What if they were running out of things to say?
He comes, white hot, pulsing, streaking his stomach and fingers. He lies there panting, floating in his fantasy.
Sherlock took a breath, surprised that John would remember such a small detail. “He was a friend.” He toyed with the handle of the mug. “He moved to New York, last I heard. Expanding his family’s business.”
Sherlock’s legs felt weak, his arms languid when John rose up and claimed his mouth, his Iips laced with a musky taste and scent.
John walked toward the road to greet her, then saw another bicyclist leisurely closing the gap behind her. Dark wavy hair, long limbs, well-cut clothes. It was the same young man he'd seen lounging against the tree last evening. Sherlock.
I took a quick step back, knowing I really shouldn't be in this private area of the house. As I looked closer, I involuntarily pressed myself back into the shadows. I had found my dad. And Sherlock.
John stood back, lifting his hand in a wave as he watched her drive away. He looked at his palm again with a mix of pride and melancholy before pulling on his gloves.
John’s rib cage rises and falls with his shallow breath, his balls pressing against Sherlock’s, their cocks hard, nearly touching. He lets out a hissing groan when Sherlock brushes his fingertips over his erect nipples, round and bright as berries.
John only nodded, still fascinated by the strange array of of items in every nook and cranny. Bats and botanical prints and a display case of bullets.
Sherlock smiles, flattered and a bit embarrassed. John is a talker, he's learning, bestowing compliments as he unwraps the gifts of Sherlock's body. John is an experienced lover. He is not.
John rubs his neck again and Sherlock hovers closer. “And a minute later, I've convinced myself I'm overthinking everything. It could be simple.” John looks up into Sherlock's eyes, at a loss. “Couldn't it be? Simple?”
Their eyes locked in the mirror, and for a moment time was suspended. They stood together, their tanned faces contrasting against their light linen suits, their postures relaxed, their bodies glowing with the radiance of youth.
John lifted his hand and watched the slight tremor, his ring glinting in the light. He thought about Mary, remembering her gentle smile, how tiny her waist felt circled in his hands. She had been kind and clever, but had not been complicated.
John looked away again, keeping his focus on the skull on the mantle. “After Mary died, I requested a transfer. I asked to be sent to the North West Frontier. There had been recent skirmishes there, troubles along the border. I didn't care. I welcomed it. I hoped it would take my mind off my misery. Maybe end it for me.”
My dad glanced up at him, and they held each other’s gazes, some unspoken conversation going on between them as they reached across the table.
She chatted as she fussed with the camera and adjusted the tripod. “It’ll take me a few minutes to set up. There’s a dressing room with a mirror just around the corner if you gents would like to check your appearance.”
“Hmm?” John asked distractedly, caressing the curves of Sherlock's backside and melting deeper into the sofa cushions.
John swallowed, very much wanting to touch Sherlock’s skin, just there through the hole; the pad of his finger slipping in, pressing lightly against that compact muscle, able to feel the subtle shifting of his body, every movement telegraphed down the lean fibers of his torso.
His palm wrapped around his soft cock, testing the weight. He tightened his grip, slicking up and down, feeling the shaft grow and harden, imagining a hot mouth, pink tongue, slow wet sucking...
He carefully turns the knob, then lets the door swing open in a slow arc, the hinges creaking in a long groan. He counts several beats, then peers around the doorframe.
John nods silently, biting his lower lip. “But the thing is,” he says hesitantly, quietly, “I think … I… need you.”
“It really isn't.” Sherlock spoke the words before he could censor himself. “India was a universe away.”
Afterwards, long kisses on the plaid blanket by the fire, a lazy meal of apples and gingery biscuits and milky tea.
And now, the heat of John's lips so close to his own, Sherlock slowly opened his eyes, found his bearings when his gaze met John's. Time moved thickly like honey dripping from a spoon, golden firelight playing across John's features, his dark blue eyes deepened with flecks of silver.
“I’ve been meaning to drop these off.” Mike plopped his satchel onto the table and dug through the contents, pulling out two red envelopes, handing them each one. “I’m hosting a little holiday party on Saturday. Just friends and neighbors, plus the usual suspects from the department. Hope you can make it.”
John vividly pictured the scene, cringing at the moment the hiker made the fatal mistake of glancing away, the whirling object striking his head. “I wonder what he turned to look at.”
Sherlock could easily think of enemies, but friends? No. Most people were put off by his sharp tongue and unusually keen observations. They rarely talked to him or even met his eye unless they had to. Apparently, he was intimidating.
Sherlock searches for his phone with one hand, groggy and disoriented. He finally locates it and mumbles something into the speaker.
Sherlock doesn’t draw away. Instead, he nudges his hips back, his thighs finding the warmth of John’s legs. They breathe, their nerves glowing where their bodies make contact, and John gives into gravity, his chest melting against Sherlock’s back, his pelvis nestling into Sherlock’s bum, his arm looping over Sherlock's side.
Sherlock does not press the matter, restraining his impulses to push through John's silence. So he waits and works, one week slipping by, then another, and another.
“Oh.” Sherlock knew he should say more, and struggled to find words. He suddenly felt very young -- and very aimless. John would be healing people, saving lives, establishing himself in a profession, while he would still be at university dabbling with chemicals, adding nothing of value to the world. For the first time, he regretted not having a strong calling to a cause or a career. “Sounds like what you wanted.”
He gripped the top of his cane, regretting his last words, wishing he hadn't revealed so much. But it was too late to take it back. He swallowed. “I was sent to a post near the Khyber Pass. Several units in the area were assigned to construct roads through territory that was heavily disputed. There were tribal snipers in the mountains, bloody good marksmen. Then the rebellion started brewing … attacks occurred all along the border … more troops were brought in.”
Their gazes held a beat longer than necessary, and longer still as the music wound around them. Sherlock's hair was still a bit damp from the rain, curling lavishly at the crown of his head. John was seized with the urge to tangle his fingers in the dark coils, imagined drawing that lush mouth to his own...
Sherlock grabbed the red plaid blanket from the back seat and they strolled to the dock, walking along the uneven planks and breathing in the sweet night air. Sherlock bent down and skimmed his hand through the water. It was cool, but not the bone-chilling temperature it had been at the beginning of the summer.
“Hmm. New York.” John glanced into the kitchen. Sherlock could tell he wanted to say something else, which he finally did. “So he was a close friend, was he?”
I knew what I was doing was wrong and invasive and despicable, but after all the years of lonely suspicions, I needed to know. I had to have irrefutable proof. And deep down, I felt entitled to spy, hurt that they'd kept me shut out of their secret, thinking me too immature to trust.
At some point they both nodded off, John waking again just long enough to turn off the lamp and open the window to let in the cool night air.
I hit a nice round Tumblr milestone, so as a thank you to all my followers, I wrote a little something. A gif of Benedict stretching in a very snug t-shirt sort of inspired this ficlet.
John looked away, knowing he shouldn't stare, then stole another glance. Sherlock was sitting on the bench to remove his shoes and socks, his back curved, his spine standing out in sharp relief, shoulder blades flexing like wings. John stood in his towel, utterly distracted, uselessly sorting through his clothes, unable to focus on the simple task of getting dressed.
Finally, finally, finally! God, it was lovely to get these two back together. Hmm, what kind of scene might the next chapter have in it?
He turned the vial in his fingers, screwed off the cap, sniffed. It was a pleasant scent, evoking summer sun and droning bees, hot flagstones and a cool, purple-shadowed bedroom.
Good god, the variety of condoms and lubricant was staggering. Nothing hidden behind counters or kept under lock and key here. Words like
“Right. I'll just get a few of my things, and take the sofa.” She pries off her heels, gathers up a t-shirt and pajama bottoms, reaches for a pillow, and he blurts her name.
“I didn't interfere, there was nothing to be done, and it seemed to calm her. She passed within a few minutes, so I noted the time -- 12:01 a.m. -- I remember distinctly. Then I stepped out into the hall to notify the attending physician. I told her the husband was in the room, and she looked at me as if I lost my mind. Said the woman's husband had died five years ago.
A warmth pooled in Sherlock's belly, desire igniting, racing through his veins. He wanted more. More skin, more mouth, the sting of teeth biting his shoulder, John's weight crushing the breath from his lungs, John's face contorting with pleasure as he writhed beneath him. He’d been too cautious for too long, too Spartan. Now he craved sensuality in every possible combination.
The crash of John hitting the water greeted him, along with John's “Bloody hell!” when his head emerged.
Sherlock takes a sip of his tea, his body still buzzing from the rendezvous in the pantry. His mouth curves in a secret smile as he lowers his lips to the rim of his cup again.
She gave him a tired smile, then flicked her eyes over Dad’s shoulder to where Sherlock was in the kitchen pouring hot water from the kettle into a tea mug. “No Vicodin for him, I presume?”
His mother stopped, folded her hands over her stomach, and fixed him with a hard gaze. “I know you didn't want to come home for the summer. But your own poor choices landed you here.” She waited a beat as if expecting an apology.
Sherlock quickly slid onto the seat beside John. He leaned forward to speak to the driver through a lowered partition. “The hotel, Wiggins. And take your time.”
Sherlock scrambled to undo his buttons and wrestle off his jacket and shirt while John wriggled his jeans and pants over his hips, his cock springing free. They paused, breathing heavily, limbs jutting, eyes locking, barely noticing the small bumps and banks as the car moved through traffic.
Sherlock stared at him, appalled at the implication until he realized his father was referring to the car. His parents could be so damned irritating at times.
He sweeps away supernatural explanations, determined to focus solely on facts. He takes a deep breath, then lets it out slowly, his confidence wavering. The facts are inconsistent and incomplete. For the first time in his life, he’s adrift in a sea of doubt, and science can’t save him
He’s so tired of hearing himself say that when he knows it isn't true. But the people he needs are bound to others who need them more. He's truly alone again, which was what he thought he’d always wanted, only it isn't.
He'd forgotten that one of the wheels had lost its rubber outer coating somewhere on a flight to Istanbul more than a year ago. Now the battered bag rolled unevenly along the tiled airport floor, making an annoying clicking noise every third rotation.
Sherlock controlled himself so tightly, mastering all extraneous impulses for the sake of pure intellect. If Sherlock would lower his barriers and let him in, if he would just give himself over to something base and hungry and sensual...
“You smell like rain and dog,” John mutters, giving in when Sherlock nuzzles his neck. His arms loop around Sherlock's waist. “Even your nose is cold.”
There have been many such encounters over the years -- glances and touches and cryptic words that might or might not have a deeper meaning in them. A gaze deepened by longing. A touch simmering with hidden desire. He sometimes thinks he sees a flicker, then it vanishes. Or maybe he's just projecting his own feelings onto the situation, feelings he’s kept repressed far too long.
They sometimes meet for coffee when John is in the city. Now that Olivia is older, John sometimes brings her along for a visit to Baker Street. Sherlock finds her to be a bright child, strangely self-possessed, curious about microscopes and skulls and beetles, able to eat numerous biscuits, capable of entertaining herself for a fair amount of time. She has John's dark blue eyes and stubborn streak. He's grown rather fond of her. He might decide to teach her poker or chess someday if she has the aptitude.
John shifted his suitcase into his left hand, noting how battered his luggage looked compared to the rich, unblemished leather of Sherlock’s. It brought home the fact that John could never afford a trip like this on his own. It stung his pride to accept everything from the Holmes, but the time he would have alone with Sherlock made it worth it.
John adjusted the microphone on his lapel then glanced at his watch, trying to be subtle. Only ten more minutes to go, ten long minutes of sitting on the stage with six other faculty members answering questions from an auditorium full of students, some attentive, some bored, and some blatantly scrolling on their phones.
“Coz there’s no need to be,” John rambles over him. He hesitates, then presses on. “And it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve met some beautiful stranger and gone home with them.”
“Bad luck, isn’t it?” Sherlock replied. He put out his palms, framing the scenario in the open field. “Our hiker takes the boomerang out to give it a few good throws, then he’s distracted, turns his head just at the wrong moment, and crack -- it flies off his skull, lands in the stream where it's carried away by the current, and down he goes. Instantly dead.”
“It's good the two of you have been able to stay such close friends after all these years. That's rare, you know.”
And we're inching ever closer to getting these two back together at long last in Baker Street. They've been apart for only a few chapters, but OMG it feels like a lifetime.
Sherlock sleeps deeply despite the oddities of the night, finally making his way downstairs for a late breakfast. Hannah checks his vitals again then shoos him outside for another walk in the walled garden.
Maybe it was foolish, allowing themselves to be tender like this; maybe they were just both imagining they were somewhere else, with someone beloved. It was a dangerous temptation to spin fantasies when you were tired and calloused and cynical. But it felt good, arms and legs wrapped around each other, too safe and soothing to let go.
I was about to look away when another movement caught my eye. Framed in the oval mirror, I saw their hands twining together, clasped low near their hips, intended to be out of view. Sherlock’s thumb glided over the back of Dad’s hand, caressing his skin. They stood still for another moment, then reluctantly separated in a slow tangle of fingers.
“Of course you do,” Sherlock countered as he slipped the paper sleeve off the record and slotted it onto the turntable spindle. He switched on the console and lifted up the needle. “Every British Army officer needs to know how to dance. You can't just stand there like a rube at social functions.”
Sherlock lazily maps John’s torso, dipping a finger into the hollow of his throat, skimming down the hard plane of his sternum, curving around the ridge of a rib. His hand ventures lower, over the soft valley of John’s belly, his fingers making small circles on the skin of his stomach just under his jutting cock.
So here's my confession. I'm purposely (cruelly? annoyingly?) drawing this story out, even though it's relatively short. Why, you ask? It's sort of an experiment, forcing readers to feel the passage of time between events (chapters) as Olivia grows up.
John doesn't even know where the hell Sherlock is at the moment. He can't count on Sherlock, not the way he would need him to be here for Christmas Eve and opening presents with Liv and chatting pleasantly with Harry over pudding.
“It was you, wasn’t it, who had that argument with the other professor at a conference? That YouTube clip that went viral about two years ago?”
Sometimes John imagines what it would be like to bring Sherlock to one of those parties, introduce him as his boyfriend, watch people's mouths fall open, and gasp when Sherlock insults the host. The thought lightens John’s mood, but only for a moment.
Sherlock drifted away from the crowd, climbing the stairs to his room. As he passed the window at the top of the landing, he heard the sound of tires on the tree-lined driveway. He glanced out, surprised to see a taxi. In a few moments, a familiar figure emerged from the car, white shirt, sunglasses.
Sherlock was about to tell her she was making no sense when the headline flashed in front of his eyes. Of course -- the dead hiker. The body must be at the funeral home since the local police had no morgue.
He glanced at Molly, who smiled at him. He didn't know her that well, although they had played together as children and met occasionally at social events and village pageants over the years. She had always been kind to him, playing or talking with him when the others wouldn't.
It’s a balmy night, the bedroom window cracked open to let in the breeze, the single lamp casting a cozy yellow glow, indigo shadows draped along the walls.
“I have a contact who provides them. The, uh, spare bedroom is just up those stairs,” Sherlock adds, hoping John isn’t put off by the grisly images.
He propped himself up on his elbow, mirroring Sherlock. “Look, I drink too much. I've used people, helped people, done shitty, unforgivable things. I've seen the best and worst that humanity has to offer. You,” he lifted a finger in Sherlock's direction, “can't scare me off that easily.”
“Turn around,” John breathes, spinning Sherlock by the hips, their trousers sagging around their ankles.
That night, he lay sleepless in bed, aimlessly flipping through the pages of Shakespeare until a passage from Romeo and Juliet caught his eye, the words echoing pieces of something his father had said earlier in the day:
John shook his head at how quickly he was getting carried away. He should take it slow, not get his hopes up, and be prepared for rejection, be it polite or rude. Their history was not exactly friendly, and a part of him feared that their recent truce was temporary. Maybe they were only getting along because they were both outsiders. Maybe once the year was over and they were back in England, they’d go right back to their bitter rivalry.
Dad raised his eyebrows. “What, all the stuff with Sherlock?” He fussed with the handle of his mug, turning the cup this way and that. “Yeah, I suppose I do.”
She tapped her chin with her finger, forming a plan. She checked her watch. Yes, she would have time. They never got home before 10 o’clock these days. Humming to herself, she bustled downstairs and headed to straight to the storage closet.
This is a little holiday gift about the five senses. Hope you enjoy, and may your December be full of cheer.
Sherlock let his words sink in, an unexpected balm on an old wound. He was too drained to pretend that John's apology meant nothing. He was tired of the strained distance between them, a gulf of past hurts and disappointments that required far too much energy to maintain.
A sliver of Sherlock’s brain was mildly irritated at his own uncontrollable moans, the rest was shutting down under the warm pressure of John's mouth and hands. Skilled, capable hands...
John twitched awake with an embarrassing snort, startled by the voice blaring over the intercom. Completely disoriented, he gaped stupidly at his surroundings. The woman seated next to him frowned and edged away as far as she could.
Dad glowered over the top of my head and I turned to see Sherlock standing in the doorway. He swooped down to place a quick peck on my cheek, then crossed to the cupboard to take down another tea cup, his long fingers sliding along Dad’s shoulder as he passed by.
Sherlock glances over his shoulder, flashes a wry smile through the now familiar stubble. “I've been good, I promise.”
John grinned, reaching over to pick a bit of leaf from Sherlock’s hair. “That’s why it's called the heat of the moment.” He kissed him lightly on the mouth, then drew back, searching his eyes. “Think you might like to try it again sometime?”
Sherlock wore a black shirt under a black suit jacket, the clothing molding to his body like a glove. He was clean shaven, his hair longer than the last time John had seen him.
“Exactly. It took the police forever to figure it out. But a good autopsy and chemical analysis could have led them to their killer much more quickly.”
“Just over here, that should be fine,” Mr. Holmes directed, looking over the assortment of stones with satisfaction. “Well done, gentlemen. We’ll get the path dug out then start to lay the stones.”
He sighed. There was absolutely nothing to do here but die a slow death from boredom. The house, Musgrave Hall, was cool and quiet thanks to the thick stone walls, plush rugs, and heavy drapes that lined the narrow windows.
John pretends he can’t see the lazy lust in Sherlock’s eyes, can’t feel Sherlock’s growing arousal against his belly. “Hmm, I’ll have to work a little harder.”
They both know the shadows that cross the other’s face. The tight mouth, the tense jaw, the gaze turned inward on a moment from years ago and thousands of miles away, a handful of seconds replayed over and over, time ground into a groove so deep it’s almost impossible to escape. Afghanistan. Serbia. Dark memories.
Aunt Harry picked me up later that morning while Dad stayed with Sherlock the rest of the weekend to make sure he was okay and, as Dad put it, didn’t do anything stupid.
John had never been dishonest with him, had never promised him anything, but he had broken his heart. Sherlock couldn't hold him responsible for that forever. They had been so young, and he had been so inexperienced. It wasn't John's fault that he had inconveniently fallen in love with him.
Dad’s posture stiffened. “You were the one who wanted to come along. Now stop acting like a spoiled child.”
It's so simple, Sherlock realizes, his hands clutching John's back, what keeps them together in their odd compromise of a relationship. It's why they settle for every imperfect aspect. He just needs to say it out loud himself.
“Hadn’t noticed,” John replied, leaning against a low stone wall. Growing more curious, he couldn't resist trying to find out more about Holmes. “What exactly do you do again?”
John hastily grabs his coat and they stagger up the stairs, stopping every few steps for messy kisses and wandering hands, finally making it to the sitting room. Sherlock takes John’s coat and carelessly tosses it into a corner of the sofa, nuzzling behind John’s ear.
Dimmock pulls out a pad and makes a note, then flips back a page. “Got the lab report back on the knife. No fingerprints except for Miss Cornish’s.” He flips the pad shut and sticks it in his back pocket. “So, I reckon our prankster got scared and took off. We’ll keep an eye open. Let me know if anything else is out of place.”
“Ah. Yes, they are. A worthwhile indulgence.” He slipped them back into his pocket and turned away to hang up his coat.
Sherlock lifted a drape of sheet and let it fall, his hand skimming down John’s side, curving around his hip, his mouth softly covering John’s, tasting of coffee and orange marmalade. John freed the knot at Sherlock’s waist, the sheet whispering off his shoulder, pooling to the floor, the dressing gown sighing open, hands roving.
A small moan, half surprise, half pleasure, spilled from Sherlock's throat, his ankles crooking around John's back. “John…” Sherlock said breathlessly, “I like it.”
Sherlock felt the tension building in John’s body, a tightening in his thighs and abdomen, the catch in his breath, the way he squeezed his eyes shut. He slowed, sinking onto John's hips, rocking him to the edge of his climax, gratified when John quivered and moaned, his hands sliding needily over Sherlock's thighs, his fingers gripping into Sherlock’s arse as if his life depended on it.
until lunchtime. He was about to climb the stairs to his room again after lunch when his father called him.
Sherlock finally glances away, his cheeks warm, trying to think of something neutral to say. “I… I suppose the morgue is the perfect setting for the evening’s theme.”
“Oh, just running an errand for my father.” She indicated the brown paper package nestled in the wire basket attached to the handle bars. She tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear.
He touches John’s photo with one finger, hoping he is finally at peace. Maybe, somewhere, he will find his William again.
John agrees, still distracted. Sherlock tosses a few bills onto the table and they leave, taking yet another cab back to Baker Street. The streets are quiet, a light drizzle falling. Once they arrive, John trots up the steps close behind Sherlock, following him into the sitting room.
John paused, suspended by the vast array of possibilities that the evening could hold in store. “Shall I stop by the pharmacy as well, pick up some...?” he hesitated, not wanting to ruin the moment by blurting out ‘lube and condoms.’
They rest, twined together, and Sherlock drifts into a light sleep. When he wakes later, John has vanished. He touches the pillow next to him, filled with disappointment and a sense of injustice. Why did they have to meet this way, separated by so much time? Why couldn’t they have met in the same century, the same lifetime?
“Sherlock--” he grabbed Sherlock by the wrist before he could walk away. He tugged him back gently, not wanting to lose their contact. “Stay with me.”
It's intoxicating, touching each other like this, drinking in small details — the flush of color on John’s cheeks; the almond shape of Sherlock’s eyes, his pupils dark; thatches of hair under arms, musky and warm; knobs of spine and sharp elbows, delicate ankle bones and tender inner thighs.
Sherlock stirred, resettled, resting his hand on John's chest, one fingertip tracing the edge of the scar on John's shoulder.
The rest of the night was a blur: Sherlock’s bedroom, tousled sheets, bare skin, tangled limbs, mouths and hair and tongues and fingers, warm, sticky thighs, deep, sated sleep.
His closely guarded hope that he and John might be something more than friends has dimmed over the years, but has never been extinguished. There are tortured midnight hours when Sherlock wishes that insistent small flame would die out for good and leave him in peace. But a flicker of foolish hope burns on, kindled occasionally by inexplicable gazes or unexpected touches from John.
He walks faster, trying to outdistance the darkness seeping in through the cracks he's so carefully mended. A black mist climbs up his spine, closing around the back of his brain. He calculates how much cash he's carrying, how quickly he could inject this pain away.
Sherlock moved to the other nipple, lapping it to a tight bud. John’s fingers wended into his hair as Sherlock moved his mouth down his torso.
John smiled softly, running his thumb gently over Sherlock's bottom lip, falling into his eyes. “Then I'm very lucky.”
John could feel his own climax building and knew he wouldn't last long. He didn't care. He just wanted to chase the ecstasy of losing track of where he ended and where Sherlock began, their boundaries blurring, their breath and bodies merging into one.
They rode by in a flash, their laughter carrying across the breeze. Sherlock watched them disappear into small dots, smoke curling from his nostrils.
Finally, after showers and shaves and a convincing rumpling of Sherlock’s bed to make it looked slept in, they closed the connecting door and exited their rooms for a quick lunch.
Still, he might as well have a look now that he was here. He shifted his cane and rapped the brass knocker, drawing his shoulders up and back while he waited. The door soon was opened by a spritely older woman wearing a floral print dress, red lipstick brightening her mouth.
John nodded, feeling anything but nonchalant. He turned his attention back to his clothes, finally pulling on his pants and trousers. When he looked back, Sherlock had disappeared into the showers, out of sight.
John sipped at the rough whiskey, trying not to look at Holmes as often as he really wanted to. The man was damned attractive, relaxing against the back of the sofa, his legs casually crossed as if he owned the place.
John caught the sly smile Sherlock threw his way and had to cover his mouth, pretending to look chastised.
She led the way up the staircase, chatting about her bad hip and how it acted up whenever it rained. John hated the sound of his uneven gait on the steps, glad for the respite as they paused on the landing before continuing up another flight of stairs.
After dining, Sherlock hailed a taxi and directed the driver to the tailor’s. When they arrived, Sherlock noticed the way John hung back a bit, taking in the tasteful window display of elegant suits and silk ties. His face betrayed the faintest hint of uneasiness.
When John undid the button just below his navel, Sherlock gasped, the muscles of his abdomen flexing involuntarily as John kissed a trail down his stomach, darting his tongue into the hollow of his navel.
The flame is ignited, their mouths smearing wet and hot across lips and jaws and necks, fingers scrambling at braces and shirttails and flies, hands tugging down trousers and pants.
The famous Mr. Holmes was in the news again, his sharp-angled face plastered on the newspapers and telly for having recovered some priceless old painting from art thieves.
Sherlock tries to smile, torn between happiness and a sense of impending loss. “I know. I knew.” He takes a breath, unsure of time and tenses. “I should have said it too.”
Mycroft let out another sigh, then shifted on the bed and folded down the covers next to him. “Get in, then.”
His criticism irks John, but he’s soon distracted by the enticing scent that envelopes them as they enter the foyer.
Of course, they probably stayed at Sherlock's flat more often. I still visited there occasionally with Dad, sometimes on weekends when I didn't have other plans.
“Well, look at the angle and clean lines of the wound,” Molly pointed out. “That was caused by a straight edge, not an uneven rock.”
Time melds into shallow breath and whispery, urgent kisses and quietly giving in to one moment, two moments, three moments more. Then John pulls back, his lowered lashes hiding his eyes. He exhales shakily.
“No, you were spot on. Brilliant.” The cocktail was kicking in, making his mood light. He propped his elbows on the table, tilting his head flirtatiously. “And what’s my story now?”
He had seen John eat, drink, nap, shave, pee (the bathroom door was admittedly quite transparent), read, and type, but he had never seen John cook quite with this detail or complexity before. It made the ordinary -- here Sherlock grasped for the right word again -- intricate. Sensual.
She laughs, and Sherlock knows John is smiling at them as they stride toward the lights and music and magical beasts, all thinking the same word:
Sherlock swallows in anticipation, the tip of his cock so, so temptingly close to John’s mouth. John glances up at him, a taunting gleam in his eye.
John moves first, unplanned, placing a hand gently on Sherlock's shoulder, fingers curling over his bare skin. He turns Sherlock to face him and their eyes meet.
They finally drew apart, breathless. Sherlock felt light headed, intoxicated by John's touch. This was the sweetness he'd known, what he'd lost and had been searching for, what he vowed never to let slip away again.
Sherlock's door abruptly opened and he strode into the room, stopping when he saw John staring at the card.
“I know,” John answers curtly, then sighs. He looks back at Sherlock. “Maybe I'm just a terrible father.”
John breaks into a grin. “That I’ll take it. It’s perfect, all of it.” His gaze lingers on Sherlock, then he runs his hand over the back of his neck, as if embarrassed by his enthusiasm.
He gives up trying to explain how any of this is possible and lets himself fall into the moment, entranced by John’s gently demanding mouth. John kisses his lips, his jaw, his neck, sending shivers of pleasure down Sherlock’s spine.
So Sherlock speaks first, his voice low and strange to his own ears. “I'm sorry,” he says, letting go of John's hand and the jacket, taking a small step away.
Sherlock looked impeccable but closed-down, removed, going through the motions with perfect posture and a drawn face. I lingered near the back of the church, waiting for Dad.
John’s mouth tightened and he looked away. Sherlock instantly regretted his rebuff and started over.
“I promise.” John’s breath was hot against his skin, his voice rough with want. “I promise I’ll come.”
Sherlock lowered his eyes again. “You should know something else. I've been in rehab several times… Drugs… I’m constantly tempted. I take risks, anything to fill that void.”
John moved closer to him on the bed. “If I’m turned on, does that mean I’m a freak too?” He took the come-filled peach half from Sherlock’s fingers, examining it for a moment, smiling slyly. “Peaches and cream…?” he lifted it to his mouth and took a bite.
“I’m fine,” he lied. “Just a bit tired.” He fervently wished his father would come down for breakfast to help distract his mother.
They weren't finished with each other yet. The next morning in the shower, John's fingernails bit into the grout of the tiled wall, Sherlock thrusting into him from behind, hands splayed around John's hips. Droplets snaked down the full-length glass walls, the spray of water dancing off their skin.
“Mm hmm,” she nodded. “Death is fascinating, don't you think? We're so frail. We're here one minute, then
Sherlock flicked his gaze over to where I stood uncertainly by the door. “What do you think, Olivia?”
It was business, he reminded himself as he walked briskly away, as well as a good deed. John was clearly in a bad spot. And if he could offer a drowning man a branch, why wouldn’t he? In this case, the branch was the lure of danger sweetened with cheap lodging, which he had predicted would appeal to John’s complex nature.
John missed it all because he had stormed out of the flat three days ago after a furious argument and had not returned.
The shower stopped just as the kettle began to boil. John listened for the sink filling, heard the tap of the razor against the porcelain as he prepared the tea, making it strong and milky sweet the way Sherlock liked it.
John ran his palm down Sherlock’s side and over the curve of his hip. “Just so you know,” he murmured, tipping up Sherlock's chin to kiss his lips, “I'm going to worship your beautiful cock and arse with my mouth… tongue… and fingers…” a fingertip trailed down the damp cleft between his buttocks, “until you feel as good as I do now.”
At the party they mingled, nibbled on hors d'oeuvres, and sipped champagne. Sherlock even managed to behave himself for once, at least for an hour or two.
“You've never been married, have you?” I blurted out the question without any context, but he took it in stride.
The winter rain continues to pelt the window, and his mind drifts to the hives, briefly worrying about how they'll fare through the cold months. The click of toenails on the wood floor and an inquisitive whine turns his thoughts again. He puts out a hand and strokes the soft fur behind Stamford’s ears. He eases out of bed and dresses quietly, trying not to disturb John, then walks the dog to the kitchen and lets him out the back door.
“Ah, Sherlock.” Mike’s round face always made him seem cheerful. He waved a jaunty hand at Molly. “Dr. Hooper.” He turned back to Sherlock. “Say, I was wondering. You don't happen to know of anyone looking for a flatmate, do you? Asking for a friend who needs a place.”
“Or they were dug up by grave robbers,” Sherlock adds, peering at one of the skulls. “Sold for a bit of drinking money.”
Sherlock searched the ceiling, not knowing what he should say. He could hang up now and walk away, letting it end. Or he could answer. “I’m still here.”
He slips off his coat and shoes, finds the remote, switches on the telly, and sinks under the covers. The bed is soft and smells like rose hand lotion, the bedside lamp casts a pool of warm light. He's hiding, avoiding everything, disappearing.
Finally, John knocked lightly on the bathroom door. It opened almost immediately, Sherlock wrapped in the blue dressing gown, his hair slicked back as John had predicted, the silver razor poised in his hand, just a few patches left to shave.
John finishes the last button and smooths the front of the shirt. “You clean up alright,” he says with a faint smile.
John finally pulls back slightly, seeking Sherlock’s gaze. They smile at each other a bit shyly, the reality of the last few minutes sinking in. There was much more to talk about, but not now. Not yet.
Maybe, he realized with a sinking feeling, Sherlock was already attached to someone back at Cambridge. Girlfriend? Seemed extremely unlikely. Boyfriend? Quite possibly. But Sherlock never mentioned anyone, never took furtive phone calls, didn’t have any photos on display… but who knew?
Once the meeting was adjourned, John immediately headed to his office to catch up on grading. He had just put on his glasses when Sherlock appeared at the door. John frowned. It wasn’t his turn for the office.
“God, I’ve wanted this,” John murmurs, dragging his cock over Sherlock's, the friction building, pleasure mounting,
Holmes laughed unexpectedly, curtly. “I’m getting philosophical. Never mind me.” He flicked ash to the side and looked up at the sky again. “You and Anthea… Are you together?”
John shrugs and spits into the sink. He’s in too good of a mood to be bothered by Sherlock’s criticism. They’d had a quiet dinner out at Angelo’s, the usual pasta and a decent wine, followed by tiramisu. No big parties this year.
They sat in a strip of shade near the bottom of the cliff, the sand warm under their legs, the breeze playing with their hair.
“Right…” John sounded subdued. “Sorry for calling so late. I apologized to your father -- I lost track of the time, but I felt I had to call.”
A small smile plays on Sherlock's lips. He’s oddly content, despite his injuries. But the feeling fades when he thinks again about all the trouble he's causing John, the harsh realities of his work that Olivia is exposed to. The underbelly of London crime is not exactly a wholesome environment.
He works his hand between their pelvises and John seems to understand, lifting his hips slightly. Sherlock grasps their cocks in his hand, stroking them both until all boundaries are blurred — John fucking into his fist, cock fucking cock, tongues fucking mouths, fingers gripping flesh, hot breaths panting, sheets bunching, the universe shrinking to their rutting, animal bodies.
It’s too much. I break my gaze away, staring at my blanched face, my fingers fumbling to turn down my collar. Sherlock is still behind me, watching.
Suddenly tired, he sat on the edge of the bed, then slowly fell backward, lying with his back on the mattress. He turned his head, breathing in John's scent on the pillows and coverlet.
“Maybe he needs something from us before he can rest,” Hannah adds, then gives Sherlock an embarrassed smile. “Or maybe that’s daft.”
Sherlock dines in the kitchen with Hannah that evening, finding her rambling stories about her ex-boyfriend a much-needed dose of dullness.
Somewhere in the distance a sputter of gunfire ripped through the night. Sherlock slowly ground out the cigarette butt under his heel. “I'd like that very much.”
“We can certainly accommodate that,” the shop owner assured them, directing John’s attention to several swatches of a soft charcoal grey fabric.
John helped pull them off, simultaneously wriggling out of his drawers and sliding Sherlock's shirt off his shoulders, craving the contact of his skin.
Sherlock’s not in the mood for it. “Never thought you'd live in the suburbs,” he snaps, then instantly regrets it when John’s mouth tightens in a frown. Sherlock passes a hand over his own mouth, wishing he could take the words back.
John perched on the edge of the tub with his tea, watching Sherlock finish the last strokes with his razor, chin tipped up, gorgeous neck extended. There was nowhere else he'd rather be, John thought, than right here, sharing this mundane moment with this extraordinary man.
Despite all his charm and projected confidence, John was not a happy man. He was restless, unsettled, doubtful of his own talents. He had found a key to smoothing his way in the world, and it worked -- most of the time. This morning, some of that unhappiness had leaked out when he talked about his father.
Neither of us enjoys it, but the publicity is good for business. And when business is good, Sherlock is happy. And when Sherlock is happy… it’s brilliant. His mind snaps and sparks with energy, his hands fly with dramatic gestures, his body hums with excitement. I’d follow him anywhere, do anything, just to be in his orbit.
John suddenly leans forward earnestly, placing a hand on Sherlock’s knee under the table. “You can always call me, you know. If you're ever in trouble. If you need anything.”
“They’re often connected,” Sherlock responded without elaborating. He took a sip of beer, noting how John regarded him for a long moment until he turned to Molly.
John must have seen the hesitation in his face. He withdrew his hand from under his shirt and lightly kissed his way back up to Sherlock's lips, then eased onto his back to lie beside him in the grass.
John had finally capitulated, temporarily trading his simple flat near Oxford for an unremarkable condo close to campus. He’d been in town for a week, pushing through jet lag to meet the department head, get his university credentials in order, locate the grocery store, and purchase a used bicycle for transportation. Classes started in eight days and he was now ready to set up his office.
“Delivering cakes?” Sherlock asked, glancing at John as they drove into the village that night. “We really are desperate for excuses, aren't we?”
“John…” Sherlock said his name softly, ready to share his newly discovered realization, “I'm happy.”
John glanced at him, already familiar with Sherlock's ‘it's for a case’ tone. “Do you want me to come with you?”
John thought about it, twisting a blade of grass between his fingers. “I doubt it. Mum will go back home a few weeks after I leave. I’ll be training at Aldershot for six months, then I ship out.”
John drapes himself over Sherlock’s back, pressing lazy kisses along his spine. “We should clean you up,” he says eventually.
Sherlock peeled off the heavy gloves and rolled back the netting from his face. “I had no idea it was so intricate,” he said thoughtfully.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock takes a seat across from John. “She’ll share every uncensored thought and opinion that crosses her mind, insult you with brutal honesty one minute then mother you the next, and has a rather colorful past. Don’t make the mistake of underestimating her.”
John topped off their glasses with wine. "Well… bon appetit," John said, suddenly feeling awkward, thinking this felt strangely similar to a date.
He thought about the choice of words: John found him attractive, at least attractive enough to think that someone else would find him appealing. But what on earth did that mean?
John collapses untidily onto Sherlock's warm chest, and Sherlock's arms encircle him, their lungs working to regain even breaths.
His fingertips brushed against John's arm as he floated nearby. Without looking at each other, their fingers entwined, linking them together as they silently drifted.
He tries to think of something clever and reassuring to say, and can think of nothing, already feeling the empty space her absence will leave in his chest.
Sherlock watched John from the corner of his eye as he rummaged out pots and pans, a ladle and wooden spoon, the grater from some deep corner of a cupboard. As the broth heated on the stove, John measured out the rice and grated lemon zest into a small bowl. He then sliced the lemon in half. He rinsed and dried the grater, filled another small bowl with frozen peas, leaving them on the table to thaw.
Their smiles wavered, falling serious. John turned to Sherlock, about to say something but stopping, his hand going to Sherlock’s chest instead. He smoothed Sherlock’s tie below the knot, his hand lingering before drifting away.
There was a pause, and John could tell Sherlock was trying to sort out how much of his request was true and how much was an excuse to meet.
John shrugs. “I’m sure it’s fine,” he says, returning to the sitting room, his limp more noticeable. He rubs his thigh, gritting his teeth. “Do you mind if I have a seat? My damn leg...”
He still never talked about my mother. She was, as far as I could tell, salted earth in his mind. Obliterated. I never wanted to get on his bad side.
I was dozing on the sofa when my phone buzzed on the side table, jolting me awake. I had to read the text several times before it sank in.
“Mmm, quite nice,” John determined, finally easing back. “What sensory receptors are activated now?”
“Mm, yes. I thought I'd mentioned that already. He's coming up this week as soon as he can get away from the office.”
John stood on the step in front of the heavy black door, hesitating. He held the note from Mike Stamford that a messenger boy had delivered to his bedsit that morning and doubled-checked the address scrawled on the paper against the numbers tacked onto the lacquered wood. He had a hard time believing an affordable flat could be found in this part of the city.
Dad had continued as an arm-chair consultant to Sherlock, discussing cases during visits or offering his medical expertise on gruesome photos that Sherlock sent at all hours, but he hadn't been out in the field with Sherlock for years. Or had he?
Now my confessions. In the beginning when I started to write this, I had the story all mapped out in my head and pretty much knew where it was going. And then the characters started taking over, demanding more scenes. And then the story became an roller coaster of emotions. And then what was supposed to be a quick, easy story became more complicated. But that's why I love/hate writing! (mostly love when it goes well)
I knew what he said was very true, and so I changed subjects. "May I ask how you knew who I was?" I was indeed curious by this as I had never seen the man before today.
That day...well, I shall never forget it. I had been mildly interested in a case that was an ongoing investigation with Scotland Yard and had been doing some poking about the scene. There was nothing new I could glean from my surroundings and I felt at a loss. My thoughts turned to Holmes yet again.
At night, I would lay in the bed I had shared with Mary, staring at the ceiling. My mind would flash between memories of her and him and I could scarcely breathe for the pain within. Losing them both so close together was absolutely devastating.
He snarled, snatching back his books as they were his children. He turned away, growling out, "Damn young people, no regard for their elders, I'm sure...!" He stumbled his way up the street, still grumbling under his breath.
I groaned as I thought of these sensations. It made me positively ache for him. But I never touched myself or relieved myself of the desire that would streak through me. I had never touched him when he was alive, I would not use him as fodder for release when he was dead. It was not fair or right in any way.
I sighed and made my way towards Hyde Park, thinking about Holmes and Mary, the added guilt of knocking the old man over eating at me. I sat on a bench, leaning back and letting the gentle afternoon breeze play over me.
Concern flitted through his eyes as he replied, "It was good to see you as well, sir. Perhaps you could come by sometime next week for tea with me and the missus."
I realized I was home and had no recollection of getting there. My mind had been so full of Holmes that I had been moving automatically, on an instinct.
I had leaped to my feet, the first emotion I had felt in months registering in my soul. I felt warmth spread through me as anger flashed across my soul.
"I thought you might be asleep for how peaceful you looked, Doctor. I'm terribly sorry for disturbing you," said he apologetically.
I turned and left the constable standing there with no definite date planned and no true promise to fulfill. For I had no intentions on keeping a date or a promise to Clarkie. The only date and promise I intended on keeping was with my service revolver that very night.
I felt horrible immediately and stooped to pick up the books hurriedly. I lent a hand to the man, but he roughly brushed aside my help, tottering to his feet.
I found myself feeling a little moved by the man's kindness, but also felt it was unwarranted. "You make too much of a trifle. Any good Christian would have done the same."
The thought of an everlasting darkness appealed to me and teased me. I would close my eyes and revel in the blackness that greeted me. Even I know my mental state was in a very bad state, but there was little I could do...or wanted to do.
I went inside my house, hanging up my coat and hat in the foyer. I felt exhausted and my mind felt overworked. All I really wanted to do was climb into bed and hide away from the world, but it seemed that my brain would not allow that.
"Begging your pardon, sir, but there is many a Christian who would have turned away from this old man," he replied, giving me a very toothy smile.
He had had dark hair with gentle waves and dark brown eyes, full of a pain that he had only known. They would light up when he was on the trail of a suspect and dim when something had not gone according to his expectations. His smile could be infectious and his laugh always had a nervous quality to it. There were many times he would press up to me when we were hiding and I could remember the flat of his chest against mine. He forgot to shave regularly and I could remember the feeling of stubble against my neck when he would whisper in my ear.
He could have found something easily in the scene before me. His skills of observation knew no rival, save for perhaps his elder brother Mycroft. I knew my mind hand nothing on his prowess.
I sat in my chair by the fireplace, my head in my hands. My thoughts were so full of Holmes that I was feeling overwhelmed. I could remember his scent, the touch of his fingers against my skin, almost as if it were yesterday. He always had a faintly astringent scent about him from the chemicals he worked with, the smell of tobacco almost obliterating it. Almost, but never fully.
Hoffstedter started at me, his eyes wide. I expect he had never thought he would hear me profess my love for another man. To be honest, I had never expected to profess it. But a lack of social grace, which had crept upon me in the previous months, had me saying things I might never have done before.
"Yes, that would be nice. I'll let you know when I'm available and we'll see if it works. Good day, Clarkie."
I entered my place of residence in Kensington, looking over everything and thinking about how Mary and I had planned to build a life here, perhaps have a family. I stopped by the dining room and thought of how I had dreamed of dinners with my wife and dearest friend, of laughter and smiles and happiness. I had planned so many wonderful memories in this house, only to have them crushed within three years. Leaving here would not hurt me so much, it held far too many terrible memories.
Stanley looked positively stricken by my words, though it might have also been the fact that I had never show a distaste for religion in the past. I had been raised Christian, alongside my friends and had never questioned anything before. After meeting Holmes and feeling my own emotions change for him, I had begun to understand the errors in my religious upbringing. Certainly, I believed in God, but not because of what the bible said. I believed in a gracious and loving God, a Father to us all.
“Mmm. Fine,” Sherlock said, and rolled off John with a grimace. He got to his feet and pulled John up. “Shower?”
Sherlock lifted his hand from her shoulder and waved it dismissively again. “This will be our own private army. Me, you, John, Lestrade. Maybe Molly and Mrs Hudson too.”
“Yeah, I understand. I'll wait to hear from him, then. Thanks Colonel, I owe you.” She disconnected and frowned slightly in confusion. Last she checked, Golov was still with Alpha Group, so him working on something international where he'd have an operative in western Europe was very unusual. He did say things had changed, so maybe that was it.
“--and seeing drug paraphernalia and evidence of recent use on someone else can certainly trigger those old cravings.”
Sherlock, now settled between John’s legs, smiled and leaned forward to kiss him on the mouth, but abruptly changed course to his jaw. He continued up behind John’s ear, nipping a little as he went. John liked this better; he was able to touch now, and ran a hand through Sherlock’s hair before bringing his mouth down to Sherlock’s throat and sucking.
.” He was flushed, his bottom lip was a little swollen as if he’d been biting it, and he was nearly panting. Sherlock’s pupils were blown wide, the irises resembling eclipsed suns.
At the very nice opening Sherlock gave him, John took the plunge, turning slightly pink as he spoke. “About that. How...experienced...are you? I know what Mycroft implied, but...”
“John!” Sherlock roared and bent double as emptied himself into John. John grabbed the back of his neck and brought him down for a searing kiss.
Sherlock was already gone. John shook his head and shimmied out of his pants. He was halfway out of his shirt when Sherlock returned. He cleared his throat and held the pajamas out to John.
“An ambulance should be arriving shortly. I assumed someone would be injured.” Mycroft nodded at Sergei’s body. “What did he want?”
Lio’s mouth quirked into a lopsided grin. “I suppose that’s an accurate description of his opinion. I haven’t had an SE seizure this long in years. But to answer your question, no. He’s already been here and read me the riot act regarding stress levels and taking care of myself.” She was silent for a few moments, then said quietly,  “I do, you know. Take care of myself. I take all my drugs and get the proper amount of sleep. Try not to get involved in your shenanigans,” she smirked again, but it quickly dropped into a frown. “I did that before, too, before I met you all. I was really only existing at that point, though. I’d take a pill, eat, take a nap, eat, take a pill, go to bed. Maybe go to the shops. Go to the doctor regularly. Watched what I ate. Didn’t drink, except maybe a small glass every once in a while. Just go through the motions.” She shook her head ruefully, hands clenched in the sheets. “These past few months, I’ve actually felt useful, like I could actually contribute again instead of being a drain, a tumor. I don’t want to lose that.”
Sherlock scanned the list of additional committee chairs. “Intelligence and Security. I thought Mycroft was being hyperbolic when he said this was a matter of national security.”
“There. The cab that just pulled up. Black hair, goatee, dark coat, maybe six feet tall but the coat is hiding a muscular build.”
“Of course.” John sat on the bed and Sherlock gently undid the clasps on the braces. He stood up and removed the shoulder harness as well.
As soon as Lestrade was gone, Sherlock collapsed against John, throwing a hand up to his forehead. He blew out a shaky breath. “I don't like those.”
John swept an arm out. “This place is a tourist trap. No way someone didn't see a murder; there's thousands of people here.”
Ignoring both John and Sherlock, Mycroft said, “I asked for Miss Verednikova’s assistance, counting on her military contacts to be able to work around the bureaucracy.”
The music flowed easily and he let it carry his thoughts. Playing the violin allowed his mind to wander. He didn't have to think about what his hands were doing so he thought other things. Such as John's panic attack. Sherlock couldn't honestly say he was surprised; John had been seeing a therapist when they first met and John admitted to him very recently that he thought about suicide while Sherlock was...away. John had nightmares quite frequently when he'd first moved in, but those had lessened, only spiking when a particularly stressful event occurred, most notably after the case at Baskerville and when he was held by Moriarty at the pool. Sherlock himself wasn't immune to nightmares; he certainly had his fair share while traveling across Europe and Asia dismantling Moriarty's web.
Sherlock looked at John as if he should already know the answer, but still replied, “No. No one else was interesting either. Until you. But I understand the mechanics of gay sex, and I assume you do as well.”
“I'll take you,” Lestrade offered, feeling a little guilty. After all, he was the one that put Sherlock in this position and based on the look he was being given, John knew it.
Lestrade cleared his throat. “Shall we go then, John?” He nodded grudgingly and the two left. Ms Monroe also excused herself to the loo and to gather up some of her things, leaving Mycroft and Sherlock alone.
Quick check with Lio in the hospital before the epilogue. Chapter title from "dystopia" off polaris by Tesseract.
They started at Parliament Square Garden, where Stephen McIlroy was found. Sherlock removed the crime scene photos.
“John, we haven't done anything in a week. I need—want to touch you. I feel...like I've neglected you.”
John stroked his head. “I know.” They stayed like that for a few moments before John said “We’re already in here; let’s go to bed. We’ll figure this out in the morning.”
“True.” She went back to the emails. “’Recruiting’s going well but could use some more leaders,’ blah blah blah, ‘operations starting in Italy, Spain, and France,’ blah blah blah. Oh, that must be where Sergei was before he came here. Golov said he was close.”
I'd like to apologize in advance for the small section of me attempting to write a street kid's accent. No apologies for the solo Sherlock, though. Chapter title from "Lament" off One by Tesseract
“Yes, that was my reaction as well. I advised him it wasn’t necessary, that we could be certain no additional Russian mercenaries would be coming for Lio as she was out of teammates. I don’t believe he listened, so I suspect the camera will be installed tomorrow with the door.”
“She probably looked like a drunk, taking a nap. Anyone who passed by paid no attention.” John looked around. “This is crazy. There are so many people, it's right on top of Parliament and the Met, and no one saw anything.”
John's expression darkened a bit and his hand stopped moving in Sherlock's hair. Sherlock moved to sit up, but John put his other hand on his shoulder, holding him down. “It's nothing. At first I thought he was threatening me, y'know, the whole 'break his heart and I'll break your neck' thing that older brothers do, but I think he was making sure I was serious. And to wish us luck.”
John's exuberance was infectious; Sherlock grinned and said, “Perfect timing. Lestrade just called with a case: dead man with no sign of foul play, but young enough that it's unlikely natural causes. Usually below my notice, but you wanted us to get out. I promise no rooftop chasing required.”
Sherlock was nearly rutting into his hand, and even though both of them came not ten minutes ago, they weren't going to last much longer. “John, harder, faster,” Sherlock panted.
“You must be Kelly Monroe, Lord Denton's chief of staff?” Mycroft quickly introduced Sherlock, John and Lestrade.
“Rinse,” John ordered and Sherlock stuck his head under the spray as John moved to the side. Sherlock's back was to John, and though John had seen the scars littering his back before, he frowned at them. He put his hand on four short scars between Sherlock's shoulder blades. “Can you tell me where these are from?” he asked quietly.
Sherlock essentially ignored Molly and read through the report, freezing as he got to the type of drugs found in Reynolds' system. He set the report down after a moment and sent two texts, first to John and then to Mycroft.
“You seem well, Lio, I’m glad. You weren’t nearly this confident or as in good spirits the last time I saw you.”
“Send it to me.” She nodded in their general direction. “I’ll keep you posted,” she left, slamming the door on her way out.
John looked down at himself. “Shower.” He stretched and popped his back. “I might need another massage.”
“Well. Now we know how to go about it for next time. Thank you Sherlock. You should get some rest too, you need it as much as I do.”
“Done.” John knelt behind Sherlock, placed a tentative hand on the small of his back and said “Tell me if you're uncomfortable or in pain. If you need to stop, we will.” He inched forward until he was flush against Sherlock's arse, running his hands down Sherlock's chest and belly, taking care to avoid the healing incisions and stab wound. John focused for a few moments on rolling Sherlock's sensitive nipples while nuzzling his neck. He slid his hands down to the taller man's erection while kissing his way down his back.
“A car will be here in twenty minutes to take me to the Diogenes Club.” Sherlock got up and headed to the bathroom.
Sherlock surprised John by placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. Judging by the way Lio suddenly froze, she was just as shocked. “You can build a new team. You’ll be our commanding officer, and Captain Watson will be your second in command.” He turned to John. “If that’s okay with you.”
She slid back into the bed and trailed a few kisses along Sergei’s back and shoulders, and let her hand draw slow patterns on his chest.
They headed to a quieter area. “Now that I have the world's strangest search history, what do we do with that information? The killer seems to think Parliament is a treacherous place and thinks killing off members of the Security Committee is going to make it...safer? Better? Seems counter intuitive.”
John placed his thumbs on either side, stretching the hole slightly while his tongue probed deeper. He spent some time tonguing Sherlock's arse, occasionally canting his stubble-roughened face against Sherlock's thighs.
“In any of your travels, have you noticed anyone following you? Or someone that's always there? He might be out of place or he might be a worker, like a janitor in the Station or in the cafe,” Lestrade said.
John also began looking around, but he didn't really know what he was looking for. Until he found it. Snatching a glove from a passing tech, he gingerly picked the item up. “Sherlock.”
“Something special!” one man exclaimed, far too close to his ear and Sherlock flinched away. There was laughter and a slamming door, then nothing.
The case Lestrade dragged him to was hardly a 4, but John was right, he needed to get out. It was clear on the other side of London and took almost 45 minutes to arrive. As they pulled up to the crime scene, a little thrill of anticipation shivered down his spine. It felt good to be back.
Sherlock protested a bit at the early hour, but let John lead him to bed. They both changed into pajamas and John pulled Sherlock's desk chair up to the bed and opened his laptop. John settled on unsolved murder synopses, and read those to Sherlock until he finally slipped into a doze, lulled by John's soft voice and that the bed still smelled like John, despite Mrs Hudson changing the linens while they were out.
She heard the knock in stereo, one through the phone and one on the actual door. She jerked it open. “You could have just started with the knock.”
“Sherlock, Sherlock, stop moving. Please. Just...focus on breathing,” John pleaded, taking his hands away for a quick look at the injury, a deep stab wound between the fourth and fifth ribs on the right side. It most likely punctured the lung causing it and the chest cavity to fill with blood.
Sherlock chuckled, then suddenly snatched the paper John was reading out of his hands. “Joint Committee on National Security Strategy.”
John smiled softly, and listened to Sherlock's breathing even out as the other man drifted off. The smile faded a little as he began thinking. Jesus, what had he gotten himself into. He was on the other side of 40; wasn't it too late to have an identity crisis? A sexual relationship with another man. With Sherlock. He enjoyed himself, of course, and he enjoyed pleasing Sherlock. He hadn't lied when he said he loved Sherlock. He blushed furiously thinking back on his words and actions from earlier. He felt like a teenager with his first crush, but everything he'd said and done to Sherlock had been real. This wasn't a one time fling. He could see himself with Sherlock for a long time. Yeah, he was used to pleasing a woman's body, but he could learn Sherlock's body, and by God he'd enjoy learning every inch of it. Satisfied with that conclusion, he pushed himself deeper against Sherlock and fell asleep.
