“Of course, sir. I am after all a highly sophisticated Artificial Intelligence. Ordering pizza is well within my purview.” Honestly the sass on that bot, Tony had no idea where he got that from. None at all. Nope.
Sorry for the long break, I worked 130 hours in the last 2 weeks. Anyway here is what everyone has been waiting for!
“I enjoy ice cream. Can we get ice cream on our date?” BUCK-E asked like he hadn’t had ice cream every day this week, he was insatiable. Tony had created a monster.
“New designation: BUCK-E accepted.” BUCK-E seemed rather stiff – he was supposed to be able to mimic humans, but apparently even with the ability, he didn't have the inclination. The only thing for it was time, so with that in mind, Tony stretched his arms to the ceiling and was rewarded with a half dozen cracks from up and down his spine, a sure sign he had been working for far too long. It was always that way on the final leg of a project, and this one was no different. He’d been excited to finally meet BUCK-E after weeks of sleepless nights.
Updates are going to be on wednesdays and sundays.
Tony made gasps and moans beneath him to show his enthusiasm, and each sound spurred BUCK-E on. He could feel the building of electrical pressure as he surged towards another orgasm but he wanted Tony to come too.
“I am doing well. Thank you for asking.” The android stood, leaving the rest of the spanners on a workbench to be dealt with later in favor of being a part of the conversation.
“No! I mean yes. Of course you are allowed. I just wasn’t expecting it,” Tony leaned in for the sweet pecking sort of kiss BUCK-E liked best, “I am thrilled. I love it.”
No, he was hurt.
The lights were on when they got back from the dinner that was hosted after the press conference. It wasn’t formal or anything, but it still took hours and Tony was beyond tired from all the socializing. Whatever this was, he hoped it was quick.
It was a bit late for visitors, but after a quick check to make sure Jarvis was still online when he didn’t say anything, Tony assumed there was a guest and not an intruder. It was a toss up as to whether BUCK-E took the lights as the same hint that they had company that Tony understood it to be. The android didn’t look like he noticed anything amiss, but Jarvis could just as easily have told him someone was here -- they seemed to be constantly talking, and Tony could see Jarvis’ influence here and there.
“Tony says that I can change my mind about sex whenever I want. If I decided I no longer want to have sex with you later...”
When he attempted to find her personal devices to see what she was working on, JARVIS stopped him with a new text file:
Sorry I missed posting on Sunday but I did warn everyone this would happen.
“Thanks Nat, you're a great friend,” She could practically hear the eye roll that went with that tone, but under the sarcasm she could also hear the sincere ‘thanks for caring’.
He knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he absolutely

He waited with bated breath while his newest creation booted up. It was only a few minutes before he finished his preboot diagnosis and then eyelids were fluttering like they should and Tony was caught in a piercing gaze that made his stomach do a little flip of excitement.
The little sounds that Tony made as he felt the electric crackle of his own orgasm run through him like a live wire and couldn't help but thrust into the warm wet heat. The feel of little puffing breaths against his cheek as Tony came back to himself, the way they clutched at each other, and the warmth that was passed between them. BUCK-E didn't want to lose a single byte.
The lack of emotion in the man's tone still sent a shiver down Natasha's spine. It made her all the more determined to figure out exactly who this was and whether he was a threat to her friends.
"That would have made waiting until you were asleep to call him completely pointless. He apologized to me for his behavior.”
"Steve? What do you mean?" Tony asked like he didn't know, like Steve hadn't been stinking up the tower for
“Carry me to bed?” He begged, flinging out grabby hands to entice BUCK-E further.
Saturdays were the best and the worst day of the week both because he got to talk to Steve, and because he had to say goodbye to Steve yet again. What was the good part and what was the bad part of that switched depending on whether they were in the middle of an argument at the time, Tony wasn’t sure which was which this Saturday.
"No one came. You didn't come," he whispered, the shame of having to say it out loud was almost overwhelming. He almost started ugly crying right there.
Next to him, BUCK-E pursed his lips as he thought it through, “I don’t know. If I say no, I will have less time with Tony. Because you will inevitably want to spend time with him. But I don’t know if I want to have sex with you. You are aesthetically pleasing, but you make Tony sad and I dislike that about you.”
Groaning and trying to roll onto his back, Tony froze when a hand caught his shoulder, preventing him from completing his turn. When he opened his eyes, he found the hand belonged to BUCK-E and he had been stopped at the very edge of the couch, just before he would have tumbled over onto the unforgiving hardwood.
It would have been perfect if not for the obnoxious ringing that was still going on, “All right J, who is it?”
“I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center.”
“What crawled up your ass and died, Romanoff?” He seemed to at least be paying attention now.
“You are absolutely certain? I do not want to hurt you.”
, but it was just as much a punishment for Tony as it was for Steve because it not only meant Steve wouldnt get to talk to him it also meant Tony wouldn't get to talk to Steve and
“Designation Sleepyhead accepted.” A flat voice replied in a smooth tenor. Okay, so they had to work on intonation but he had been spot on with the voice synthetization, no hint of tin or crackle anywhere to be found.

If something was wrong with Steve then this scene would have looked much different but he wasn’t sure why else she would be here. There were plenty of safer safe houses than his if she were in trouble.
Tony had an almost startled look on his face. “Darling?”
“It was one of his more sincere attempts at mending fences. Would you like me to play it back for you, sir?”
“New designation: Pinocc–” Tony whirled around to eyeball him and saw what he thought might be a spark of mischief in BUCK-E’s eyes.
“I was just- I mean- I,” And just like that Tony knew exactly what Steve was going to ask about. His husband wasn’t a prude per say,  he was never afraid to try something new, but the man could not talk about sex without stuttering through it and blushing like a school girl. Tony just had to be patient and eventually Steve would break. “Is he- Are you really?”
"I am unharmed. Rogers is 231.6 miles from here and cannot harm me. I have not left this bed all night."
Not to be presumptuous but as the only Omega on the team he assumed he would be the pack Omega. Tony hadn't asked him but Steve thought it was implied with how everyone treated him. Natasha made these little Russian cakes that she only shared with him. Clint would flop down on the floor in front of him and set Steve's feet on his belly and rub little circles into his ankles while they watched TV. Every time Bruce made a cup of tea he would make a second one just for Steve. Thor wasn’t on planet very often, but when he returned from Asgard he would always bring Steve a bauble of some sort. And then there was Tony, the pack Alpha was always touching Steve in some little way, gently scenting him and comforting at the same time. It wasn't what a pack Omega would have gotten in the 40s but it was what he'd been expecting for one in this day and age.
"Did you know, after the Omega rights movement really got going, it became proper etiquette in packs for the Alpha or Alphas to wait for the Omega to approach first," Tony sounded earnest and Steve had no reason to not believe that this had just been a big mix-up, a cultural difference.
Tony broke the kiss and dropped his head down to BUCK-E’s shoulder, “Want you to finger me. Please?”
“Of course, wouldn't want you to fall asleep on me,” he tried to tease. It was after Tony moved off to the kitchen and out of the view of the TV’s camera that he saw BUCK-E sitting on the couch staring at him. “Hello, I’m Steve. Tony’s husband.”
"I'm so sorry we missed your heat because of a misunderstanding. How about I try to make it up to you?" Tony purred in his ear.
As sure as he was that he should not have watched the whole twenty minute video, Steve was even
“Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.”
Even as Steve thought that, he was locking the door to his suite in the Tower and putting himself into ‘Incognito mode’ on his phone and Jarvis’s systems -- he wasn’t such a luddite that he couldn’t figure out what that was, or what it was generally used for, no matter what Clint or Tony thought.
BUCK-E hadn’t meant to tease, but he supposed, intended or not, he had been. Hoping to make up for it, he flipped them over in one clean motion, settling Tony with his shoulders on the bed and his hips in the air still firmly in BUCK-E’s grasp. There was much more leverage from this position, and he used that to his advantage, setting a pace that rocked the bed against the wall with every thrust.
“Pretty soon we'll all be driving cars with bumper stickers that say, "Robots make better lovers."
By the time BUCK-E added a third finger, Tony was mostly working himself back onto BUCK-E’s hand. The finger slid in as smoothly as BUCK-E could have hoped for, but it did throw the man off his rhythm, making his hips stutter with the extra pressure. It may also have had something to do with the way BUCK-E crooked his fingers to dig into the man’s prostate just so.
It wasn't often Natasha Romanoff admitted defeat. Almost never really. But this was one instance where she was done fucking around.
BUCK-E was still debating the likelihood of whether Rogers was actually sincere, when Tony woke up for the day. When the man smiled up at him, it made BUCK-E put all of those thoughts into a .save file to come back to another time, Tony deserved his full attention.
Tony wondered what Natasha thought was going on here, because whatever assumptions she had come to were wrong but would probably be very interesting to hear. Not that he could ask, she definitely wouldn't tell. Not in front of BUCK-E at least.
It had taken weeks, which was good because it distracted him from all the emotions he was trying so desperately to avoid, and now he was standing in front of what was, without a doubt, the most advanced AI he had created to date. As the forerunner in artificial intelligence, that was really saying something.
Kneeling on the bed, Steve settled into a good position so he could still watch. In one hand he held the bright red -- Ironman red -- vibrator attached to a long cord with a remote at the other end, the bullet was only the length of his thumb and about as wide so he wouldn’t need to worry about stretching himself. In the other hand he held the new bottle of lube he had bought at the same time.
Comments make my day.
― Kurt Vonnegut
“Are you okay?” BUCK-E whispered as soft as Tony had, sounding a little frightened and a lot overwhelmed by the whole thing.
“Okay.” BUCK-E removed his fingers and even though it was exactly what Tony had asked for, he still cried out in protest. “Shh, it’s okay darling.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Technically Tony wasn’t even supposed to know her real name but then again he was Tony Stark and far too nosy for his own good. That had been interesting, finding out that his new secretary was actually investigating his company for treason and selling weapons to terrorist cells was a hell of a wakeup call. Between the two of them, they had found a few leaks, but Tony and Natasha both agreed that there was something missing in the picture that neither of them could find.
“I don't know what that means. Jarvis? How would you categorize Rogers' apology?” Jarvis was much better at judging these things than he was -- BUCK-E still had a lot to learn about people and their motivations.
He had been going for realistic and aesthetically pleasing, so the android was tall and broad with long, silky, brown hair that was perfect for tugging and a jawline meant for nipping at with the perfect amount of stubble to leave beard burn wherever it went. When the automaton opened his eyes, they would be an intense grey. It had taken a while to work out the eyes but they would contract and expand just like an organic pair would to stimulus, not to mention emotion, if Tony did his job right, which he had, because he was Tony fucking Stark. Jarvis was as much a person as a bodiless AI could be, so he was confident in his abilities.
“Yeah, BUCK. You can always keep watch of me.” Tony pressed a kiss to his knuckles, which sent a zip of electricity right through him.
Stilted conversations with loved ones were a Stark family tradition, but Tony hated the silence, it ate at him -- that was probably one of the reasons he rambled as much as he did, always trying to fill the silence with his own words, lest there be even a breath of air left for awkwardness to fill.
“Oh, sweetheart,” Tony took one of BUCK-E's hands in both of his and applied light pressure, “Steve and I are just going through a rough patch right now. We will work it out eventually. I know you haven't seen him at his best, but that doesn't mean you need to hide your interactions with him. If he's finally pulled his head out of his ass enough to apologize then things'll get better from here.”
That didn’t assuage any of her fears. It just meant that Steve thought he could handle whatever this man was capable of dishing out -- statistically unlikely with Steve’s track record of getting in over his head.
He had already realized that every moment didn't need to be saved in full detail, a detailed .txt file could be used to remember some moments, and there was no point in compressing audio of complete silence to save for later. That still left so many moments that he would want to save every aspect of, like this one where he and Tony shared a closeness and passion.
Slowly, he let Tony sink down. Not that the man didn’t try and speed things up, but BUCK-E had a good hold and Tony didn’t have any extra leverage.
“My schedule for today lists a six-hour self-accusatory depression.”
“Because I assumed if you wanted to know you would find out. You’ve done it before.”
They had another lull while they both tried to find another topic.
To keep himself from obsessively watching the clock, Tony had resorted to going through the backlog of approvals and requests that Pepper had left him to sign. Which was such a shame, because if he did this again next week she would realize there was a pattern and continue to give him a mountain of paperwork and expect it all to be worked through on Saturday.
"It's not the 40s anymore Steve, we have too much respect for you to do something like that. You have choices now and I will always do my best to make sure you get to be the one making those choices."
Steve turned his own little bullet to it's second setting and tried to ride the wave of sensation. His hand flew over his cock and he let go of the remote in fear that he would crush it. His entire body was tight as a drum and Steve could feel the vibrations in his teeth.
(See the end of the chapter for
He hadn’t been searching it out specifically, but now that he’d
“Well, you definitely shouldn’t have done that. Classified, yada yada, top secret Bla bla bla. At least he’s not likely to get shot before he comes home. This time…”
They started a new round. BUCK-E focused on a woman in the back with rectangular glasses and a sharp jaw. They both start combing through social media and databases. JARVIS said this was an easier game than normal, due to the fact that most everyone in the room was a reporter, which narrowed down the search parameters right from the start.
“Tony don’t you dare! We aren't done talki-”
“Doing Steve a favor.”
His hips bucked involuntarily up into Tony’s body as his orgasm flowed through him like a current. Buck-E could feel the lubricant leaking out around his cock, thankfully less than the first time due to a quick adjustment. He and Tony had agreed that it was an excessive amount to ejaculate after every orgasm, and he would rather not need to refill his stores after every time he had sex (something he was hoping to partake in often, which made the mess seem even more bothersome).
Tony feels shaky, aches more than usual. Maybe a good sign. Maybe his body is starting to respond. He wants something more than the plug in him. He tries to decide if he can make it across the room for some of Steve's reserves. He rubs at his neck, puts his fingers where Steve's fingers were. Squeezes. Closes his eyes and tries to remember Steve's scent.
“I need you to tell me who has it out for you,” Jen tells him.
“Love you,” Mike tells Gary, and Steve feels like he’s trespassing.
at him, roving eyes and wandering hands. He stares at Tony’s throat. Tony wants to tear his face away but he’s stuck on the guy’s eyes, the fullness of his lips, bright and pink when the lights strobe over them. Tony wonders what color his cock is.
. But he is once again, maybe for the last time, in a trap of his own making. Afghanistan v.3-4-5. Utterly alone, whispering into an echo chamber, responsible for generating his own heat, for managing Steve's unbridled rage and shame and guilt. Tony is the only salvation he is ever going to have. He knows it now.
Jen is going through her briefcase. “That’s not what I said,” she says. “There’s no precedent for this hearing. You answer to Congress, you’re being scrutinized by the UN, they should have told us Maya was gonna testify, ok? You need to pull yourself together and we’ll deal with it, whatever happens, I’m not gonna bail on you. I’m on your side.”
That isn’t right, the shield is locked in a storage unit on the Helicarrier.
"You thought what?" Tony asked while running one hand through Steve's hair. It was so relaxing and distracting he couldn't remember why he hadn't wanted to finish his sentence.
“It is your husband, sir. Would you like me to inform him you are busy? Perhaps, that he should try it another time?” Jarvis wasn’t being serious, but it was very tempting to do just that. ‘Sorry I have other things going on, maybe later’. It was just a bit too petty for him. Well, not

“Mr. Barnes, if you could please stand in front of the sheet? I’ll take a picture and finish off your new ID,” She gestured to BUCK-E and Tony had to wonder exactly what Steve had told her about the android.
“Training?”
I've been working 12 to 14 hour shifts since Friday, I almost forgot it was time to post! I made it with an hour to spare. Hope everyone liked this chapter. Till next time ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
“As you all know green energy is a cause I hold close to my heart,” That had been one hell of a press conference. It had been like a pack of Mentos in a bottle of Coke when he announced, effective immediately, Stark Industries would no longer be producing weapons. He’d been harangued with questions, had his mental state questioned, and lauded as a humanitarian, all in the same breath. In the year since the announcement, it had calmed down significantly, at least on an outward front.
comments are like cookies and I'm like the cookie monster.
BUCK-E wondered how many times Steve Rogers had been shot, and if that was one of the reasons Tony was so upset that he was gone. If Tony were in any situation where he might be shot, BUCK-E thought he would be upset as well.
"Oh sweetie, we all sat around wishing we were keeping you company. You never asked though, how were we supposed to know you wanted that if you didn't ask?" Tony brought their foreheads together.
Ethics was so difficult, it seems to be very subjective. The entire concept was frustrating but he would trust JARVIS' judgement on the matter.
Tony looked over to see BUCK-E staring back at him with a furrow in his brow, like he wasn’t sure why everyone was suddenly talking so much louder than they were a moment ago. Guilt sank to the bottom of his stomach like a stone – here he was screaming at Steve who was too far away to really get the full impact of it, when poor BUCK-E was right next to him patiently waiting for him to finish.
“That did not make any sense…”
The sound of footsteps echoed down the hall towards him, Tony had to be running to match his pace. It always made him self-conscious to think how easily he outstripped most alphas now, how easily he could take them down. He had gone from that perfect birdlike Omega form, sickly though he may have been, to what at first glance was the picture of alpha masculinity; he was still an Omega though and he thought that would be enough for his friends. His pack... Guess not.
“Oh fuck,” Tony gasped out. He had one hand on BUCK-E’s pectoral for balance as he continued rocking his hips in little circles, never raising up enough for BUCK-E’s slowly softening cock to slip out.
(See the end of the chapter for
done. End the call, J.”
“Did you know he's sleeping with your husband?” Natasha only suspected -- based on Tony's body language and the way 'Bucky' seemed to take his cues from Tony. It was perhaps a bit of a stretch but her gut was rarely wrong.
“Not yet. Patience, darling.” BUCK-E smiled up at the needy man.
Due to real life I will not be posting on Saturday or next Tuesday. I will be taking a work trip and I know I won't have the time. Sorry❤️
BUCK-E threaded a hand through his hair and he just about went boneless.
BUCK-E was beginning to think that perhaps he had miscalculated, Tony was implying he was displeased to have been left out of the conversation instead of BUCK-E’s assumption that he didn’t want to talk about his husband, “I was not trying specifically to exclude you. He makes you upset and unhappy, I did not want that.”
― Isaac Asimov, I, Robot
“Fuck fuck fuck! You are trying to kill me aren’t you?” Tony was panting and shuddering, but he seemed in no danger of dying, “Are you going to fuck me? I’d really like you to fuck me.”
“I hope you know what you're doing because if Bucky ends up killing you both in the middle of the night I'm definitely going to say I told you so. I will of course avenge your deaths, but too little too late as the saying goes.” Natasha really actually hoped she was wrong here, but unlike Steve and Tony, she was too much of a realist to set aside the logic that a dangerous unknown would always look out for themselves. If she’d seen it once, she’d seen it a hundred times. Trusting people like James Barnes got you stabbed in the back.
Instead of following Tony’s instruction and pushing another finger in, BUCK-E took the proper time to relax the muscles with his fingers. BUCK-E ignored the frustrated whine Tony let out even as he rocked back on the fingers inside him.
The answer was not particularly satisfying:
The water was only a temporary solution, a real fix to his problem would be double chocolate ice cream… or a good fuck but apparently he could only have one of those things.
“Good.”
"I spoke with Rogers last night." He hoped that the subject didn't cause Tony any distress, but when Pepper had spoken of his husband the other day it hadn't had the same reaction as actually speaking to the man.
“I am not going to break, BUCK-E.”
Steve was hard enough to pound nails into concrete and knew he was going to watch one of Tony’s videos regardless of the little voice in his head screaming that it was wrong.
“Are the two of you really having sex?” And there was that blush, Tony knew from experience that it went all the way down to his nipples.
He was beginning to feel a bit antsy himself. The incremental slide as Tony’s heat slowly engulfed his cock felt amazing. BUCK-E didn’t let that get the better of him though, keeping Tony’s hips carefully in check until they were flush against BUCK-E’s pelvis.

Tony wouldn’t admit it out loud, but his heart had gone all warm and gooey. This was why he loved Steve, for these thoughtful moments with his AI where he recognised that they were still learning and tried to help them -- even when his face still looked like it might catch fire any second. Of course he could be thoughtless, as he had proved with BUCK-E last week, but there were also moments like this.
There was a long silence where Natasha thought Steve might have actually nodded off. She was just about to hang up and call him again when he spoke up. “Tony didn't grow him in a lab. BUCK-E's not dangerous, and you certainly don't need to investigate him for us. We know everything we need to know about him.”

“Suck it up, Rogers, I am in no mood.”

that he wasn't allowed. Well, not this time.
At the moment, BUCK-E was staring out into the crowd of vultures and flashing cameras, at least outwardly seemingly cool and collected -- if that was true or not Tony would have to wait to find out. There were a few shouted questions as to who the new face was but Tony ignored them all. They would be taking questions from three different pre-approved journalists who had all been instructed to keep their questions on topic -- any off topic questions would be ignored, no second chances given.
“So Nat, you’re sure doing this favor for Steve has nothing to do with another redhead we both know? I suppose it’s just a coincidence that she just happened to take the next two days off very suddenly…” Tony had seen looks passed between the two of them and while Natasha was fantastic at deflection, he could read Pepper like a book. Sure, he had thought her good mood before was just because the press conference had gone well and he had behaved through dinner with the execs -- not a single comment about how they were relics who couldn't see the next big thing if it were a glowing beacon of clean energy right in front of them -- but now he understood it was because she would be getting a visit from their favorite super spy.
“I’d like to apologize to you too-”
“Right... Well,” Natasha seemed to metaphorically shake her unease off because she thankfully let it go. “Steve didn’t give me a lot to go by, so I took some creative liberties. Here’s a birth certificate. You were born in Shelbyville Indiana, to George and Winnifred Barnes. Full name James Buchanan Barnes. Steve insisted on Buchanan but I got him to settle on the middle name. If you would look straight ahead, I’ll take a couple of pictures and get your driver's license and passport finished before I go.”
"Steve would you stop? Please. Tell me what's wrong." Tony grabbed his arm in an attempt to physically halt his progress. His Pack Alpha had no physical power over Steve so it seemed as if he wouldn't even show up when it mattered, like Steve was too much work. Tony's hand wouldn't have stopped him if Steve hadn't let it, and that made him feel even less the Omega than he usually did. He did stop though, to let his Alpha know that he would follow him in all the ways that counted; even if he wasn't Tony's Omega, or the pack Omega. "Talk to me."
“First of all, if I didn't already know that, then that was possibly the worst way for you to tell me. Have you never heard of breaking the news gently?”
"I had my heat and nobody bothered to show up!" That was too loud, he was shouting at his alpha. No wonder everyone stayed away, what kind of Omega did that?
“I meant that I am not breakable. You don’t have to treat me like a porcelain doll.” Even though Tony was frustrated right now, BUCK-E had already seen how much he enjoyed being taken care of.
“There are extenuating circumstances that I just don't want to get into with you at 3 a.m., Natasha. Leave it alone, please.”
to be cryptic but he sure succeeded. Tony almost laughed when he saw Nat's mask crack a bit as she furrowed her brow at that nonanswer.
“I could keep track of him for you, to be sure he doesn't do anything dangerous?” It would certainly ease BUCK-E’s mind to know that Rogers had not come to harm, knowing it would distress Tony.
and Tony’s been
“Gag me, then, just.” He balls his fist. He’s been kneeling here nursing his anger. He’s ready to bust out of his cuffs and put Tony on his back and take him for a ride himself.
Steve reaches for his cock, and Tony kicks. His limbs aren't mapping right, his scant body is wracked with chills, but he fights with all the ferocity he channeled on Titan. He has all his blood. He's taken Steve down before on a thousand mats, in a thousand simulations. He can do it again. He throws the sloppiest roundhouse of his life and –
But now. Steve is like a living ruin. Silent, stone.
Tony doesn’t need to try too hard – he may be a shitshow right now but he’s always been a charmer. Seduction is part of the package. Tonight he finds he
Steve is quiet.
Steve’s nose is pressed into Tony’s stomach. The urge to pull back is useless; he’s fully bound, he couldn’t break the bonds if he wanted to. He remembers: swallow, keep swallowing, just hold it together until Tony pulls out. He has to pull out.
He hears himself screaming, he feels Steve’s hand stroking over his forehead, he hears Steve’s voice:
Under his phone is a plastic card, cracked down the middle. A tiny green light blinks in the corner.
Tony sucks one of his thumbs into his mouth in response.
Tony doesn't say.
Do you want me to try, Steve says. I will, he says, as long as it takes, I am here, if that's what you – If you want me.
- - -
Tony tries to push himself up, but the heart monitor beeps dangerously, so he settles for twisting his body around, pressing his cheek against the handrail, letting their voices hit him sideways.
“I think I can handle it,” Tony snaps. He’s leaning on his elbow now, curled over the counter. His breathing doesn’t sound ok. A bruise is blooming over his side.
“Be safe, Steve” Tony says, his voice weirdly flat. He closes his eyes. Slips away to wherever it is he goes now.
He's sitting in a chair, probably Nebula's doing. She likes to practice her kindness on him. His limbs feel prickly and weak, deep pain and fatigue shot through his bones. He can't see his chest rising and falling in his periphery when he breathes. He is scant and he can see the stars and he feels -
Tony presses one open hand to his stinging cheek.
Steve stands at the end of the line with the mourners, his hands in shackles and his hair dripping into his face. He stares Tony down, the rain turning his suit into a macabre dye-job, and Tony knows how to spot that glare a mile away.
Tony kisses like he’s trying to solve a puzzle. Like he’s somehow grown a sixth sense along with that new fancy gold skin of his and he’s trying to work out whether or not Steve is full of bullshit. Butterfly kisses to his bottom lip, gentle nips where the slick inside of Steve’s mouth meets his. He draws it out, drags his teeth over Steve’s lower lip, gives him the faintest edge of tongue. Testing for boundaries he won’t find.
Rubell talks about every guy he’s every fucked like the sun sauntered past one day and that was that, end of story. Happy endings for everyone.
Steve comes back smelling like regular sweat after his 15 mile run. He doesn't shower, just takes off his socks and shoes and presses his disgusting self up against Tony, rubs his body all over his.
, Tony had whispered in lieu of
“Don’t do that,” Tony murmurs. “No secrets here.”
Tony has a role. They're mated. He should touch Steve's face, and kiss his eyelids, and tell him it's going to be fine. That they're going to get through this.
He catches Tony’s hand. He is gentle. He keeps his grip loose, he keeps his touch light. “Tony,” he says.
because they’ve neutered him and that fucking cuff is still on his ankle and Steve is putting his hand on Tony’s wrist –
Tony finds his eyes – bloodshot, but clear enough. Enough cylinders firing. He nods, once. He looks like he wants to die.
The man catches one of Steve’s hands and presses it to his throat so Steve can feel.

is fast on the heels of
Carol, in full uniform, who climbs in last and apparently counts as three civilians.
There’s a tremendous crack as Steve breaks through his ankle and a metallic clink as the band falls away.
It’s fine. He doesn’t need to call. He doesn’t owe Tony anything. They’re over.
- - -
Tony has to have him.
The response should be rote:
Tony tries to reach across the table to hold his hand. Steve sees it happening in slow-motion, sees Tony’s skin resting on his own, snatches it back. Something is happening in his chest, in his throat. He needs to leave. He shouldn’t have come here. He gets that wash of Tony’s cologne again when he moves his arm and it’s too much –
“Yeah, Stephen,” Steve says. “I loved him the first time, too.”
I'm gonna fuck you until you're better, Steve is saying.
Steve thinks he would personally punch Odin in the goddamn throat given the opportunity.
Tony thought this would be easier. Like slipping back into an old suit. Like flying. He was so certain he could never forget what they felt like together. What Steve breathed into him.
Steve waits.
Steve, Tony says. Steve puts the tip of his cock to Tony's mouth. His skin feels hot, which can't be correct, they can't both have fevers. Tony's muscles protest, rigid, unused. He reels. Unaccustomed to being upright.
, Steve whispers to him, and Tony nods. Tony grits his teeth but he still groans when Steve gets an arm under him and around his back. He walks like he’s been hobbled, like his knees are rusting and his joints have been knocked out of place. Steve pulls the covers over him and makes him take aspirin and surrenders Jocasta’s projector so Steve can’t call an ambulance.
Stark. Tony Stark, he thinks. He hasn’t heard that name in years.
“Tony,” Steve coaxes, and tips Tony’s chin up with one of his fingers. Tony doesn’t look, won’t, focuses on Steve’s genitals in front of him and the things he plans to do with his mouth -
“I thought your heart was ok,” Steve says. It’s one of those nightmare scenarios he needs to cauterize before he can move forward, and Tony’s calm is only feeding his own panic, he knows he’s supposed to be an anchor but Tony is sitting in front of him and that fucking
I don't feel good, Tony says, and then Steve is on his tongue, gripping Tony's head like he's going to crush his skull against the tile, but he just crams his entire length into Tony's mouth, against Tony's throat. Tony actually feels him pulling his jaw apart. He slaps one of his hands wetly against Steve's thigh.
Steve eases them to the wider part of the couch, one hand carefully on the small of Tony’s back, dips him like a woman and lays him down while Tony is still reaching for him. “Steve, ah,” Tony says. “I don’t, I don’t know if I can.”
Tony doesn’t remember ducking into the bathroom until someone is telling him to fucking move.
He gently, gently kisses Tony’s forehead and reaches over him for the file folder.
Tony strokes a hand through his hair. “Last chance, Captain,” he says, and then it’s violent, then he’s pulling and Steve’s eyes are watering and he feels a fresh welter of precome sliding onto his thighs. “Tell me how you want to
“Like what,” Steve presses,
He downs the rest of his martini and angles his way through the crowd of people. The music is changing; the DJ is fading into something urgent and fast with a balalaika.
“I’m tired,” Tony says. He steadies himself with a hand on the back of the sectional, leans over the back to kiss Steve on the cheek.
Tony puts his hands in his lap and blinks at him with his stupid blue eyes.
“Where the fuck are you,” he barks into the speaker, because they’re over an hour late, no call-in, nothing.
“I know what you’re gonna say,” Tony says, and he still sounds like he’s tears aren’t far away but he’s also rubbing the heel of his hand against Steve’s cock, and everything else slides away: Jarvis, the unlocked door, the wide-open window looking out into the courtyard. “And I know why you’re gonna say it.” Tony presses on, tugs his shirt out of his pants and kicks his legs up underneath him so he’s kneeling sideways on the couch and ready to dive face-first into Steve’s crotch. “But I need you not to say it and just let me do this.”
He tries to re-assemble his team because after all of this time building his own family, he is alone again, and Steve has enough experience to know that he must keep himself occupied so he can keep himself from doing something irreversible. He looks at the roster and he looks at his navy leather uniform and he practices smiling in the mirror. He tries to be kind. He tries not to take it personally when Wanda and Vision and Peter don’t come back to the team. He tries to hold on to what he has.
“I am completely uninterested in romancing you,” Tony says, as if it’s any kind of deterrent.
He wants a smoke.
Steve pulls his arm away without explanation. He gets out his cock, and Tony knows: they're not going to talk about it. He lies there like a precious bequest. Preserve at all costs. Like if Steve touches him wrong the patina will spoil. Tony feels Steve jerking himself, feels the heat of it at the small of his back. Only has a moment to process the idea that maybe he is being violated. Maybe he should care. Smells the wet salt smell of it when Steve takes a handful of it and massages it into Tony's neck, right against his glands. A trickle of it drips down his collarbone.
Tony lies still and silent. He is so very grateful he can’t see Steve’s face. He presses his cheek against Steve’s bare shoulder, traces the lines of his bicep, smooths the pad of his thumb over the dewy sheen of his skin. Perfect and unbroken and unmarked.
Leonard is looking haggard. He smiles, tries to coax Tony into taking off the helmet.
Tony looks at him like he’s trying to see through to that dark place that Steve is so good at burying, and Steve meets his eyes for a fraction of a second before he’s pulling his hand away and drifting back around the island to fix Tony’s coffee.
The things I would do for you, Steve is telling him. Do you know how it felt to keep that to myself? Do you know how hard it is to lie across a bond?
I'm fixing you, Steve tells him. He draws Tony into his body, sucks at Tony's lower lip. Bites, hard enough to draw blood. Slips two of his fingers through the mess on Tony's face, slides them into Tony's ass.
pulls all the way off.
“I think I should have finished the job,” Steve says.
He tries to take his helmet off, his chest plate.
You’ve been in Manhattan this whole time and no one knew where you were–”
“Please,” Tony tells him.
That's how he knows he's dying.
Steve grabs his hips and keeps him there. “Tony, what the hell.”
He tries everything, he grits his teeth and tries to drag Extremis up from in him but it’s like staring into a gaping wound, an open, empty port, a disassembled mainframe. He is a broken fucking machine and they put him on his back and Tony puts his shaking arms up and he’s back on the pavement, he’s going to die and he made this bed and he is crying heaving open-mouthed sobs and begging: please, please, please, please,
“I fell off the wagon,” Tony says hollowly.
Steve is sitting in the narrow beam of light, his legs crossed, his shield laid in his lap. He looks like he hasn’t slept in years: red-rimmed, dark-circled, cloudy dead eyes.
“I’m going to prison,” he croaks.
“It is our finding that there is sufficient evidence to try Anthony Stark on charges of dereliction of duty. Furthermore, we have found Mr. Stark guilty of multiple violations of the Superhuman Registration Act. The defendant will be immediately remanded into federal custody. Mr. Stark, you are hereby terminated as Director of SHIELD, suspended of all rights and privileges granted under the SHRA –”
He’s had so many chances, Steve thinks, as he rolls Tony’s sac around in his palm, as he licks his way up to the head of Tony’s cock. He hasn’t been inside Tony for weeks. Months. The most they do is roll themselves together, if Tony is feeling up to it, if Tony can get over his issues long enough to hike up his shirt. No more fucking Tony on his hands and knees or over the counter or up against the wall, no more physical resolutions to their altercations.
“I understand,” Tony is saying. “Really, I do, it’s – you seem very wholesome.” He rubs his hands together over and over, like he does when he’s working out a problem on the map board. Tony lets out a piteous little chuckle for Steve’s benefit, but his eyes are flat and dull. “I’m not–” He stops himself short.
He hears them talking again, murmurs, whispered endearments. He pulls on his boots.
Tony tries to flex his fingers, but his body is several inches left of where he thinks it is and the pain drops him back with an agonized scream. He feels like his brain is stuffed full of cotton. Like the world is a distant spinning galaxy and he is far into the stratosphere. Like he is watching himself fail.
Steve noticed, because Tony became Steve’s entire world the minute Tony came out of a coma with half of his skin burned off.
“When are you gonna love you as much as I do,” Steve asks him.
Steve can’t bring himself to let go of Tony’s hand. He rubs his thumb over Tony’s callouses.
Rhodey says: “When are you coming back?”
Tony slaps him and his eyes snap open. Steve’s slipping.
He wants to know what Tony thinks about trying O-blockers. Tony tries to decide if Steve is asking him to give up. He wants to know if Tony is willing to consider IV Clomid. Just think about it, Steve says.
“Oh my god,” Tony says, when Steve pulls away, low and subdued, like the shock is settling over him in a slow wave. He jostles himself while Steve sits with his own smugness. “I can’t - I can’t feel. Steve.
The man is smiling at him.
“I’m why we needed this,” Tony says. “I explained this to you. Someone needs to watch the watchers, Steve.” He thinks most of it is unintelligible. He thinks he’s bleeding into his brain. He smells the metal of Steve’s scale and for a moment he’s able to imagine that they had this together.
Steve lets his head tip back and buries his face in Tony’s neck. He presses his eyes shut and moans where Tony is massaging the head of his cock with his thumb. Steve shakes his head, searches for Tony’s neck with his mouth.
Steve has to carry Tony into the elevator and sit there, Tony’s head in his lap on the helicopter pad while he nudges aspirin into Tony’s mouth to chew.
“Steve,” Tony is saying. “Steve, hey, it’s gonna be fine. I’m fine.” Steady as a heartbeat.
Steve lies there in the dark and listens as Michael and Gary stumble their way into bed together. They’re not quiet when they make love. Sometimes, like tonight, he can make out words. He envies their shamelessness, their freedom. The gracious thing to do would be to pretend there’s nothing to hear. Shove his head under the pillow that still smells of the cold cream from the woman he fucked a few nights ago. He imagines what it is to come home to the same someone, every night.
Tony sits there, focusing very hard on the floor, breathing into his belly, until his bulge subsides a little, until he can look at Steve without breaking into that lovely pink flush.
Reed looks at him, all fathomless hate and onerous betrayal. Steve thinks it’s more emotion than he’s ever seen from the man.
He turns at the last minute, because there is no reality in which Steve Rogers can ever really give a thing up. He bends. He presses a kiss to Tony's forehead.
“So that was shitty,” Steve says to Tony's back. “Hey,” he tries. “Tony, talk to me.”
Maybe that’s how they ended up here.
Enough, Steve snarls in his Alpha voice, like he really thinks Tony will go down.
Mystery Man shudders and his back muscles move beneath Tony’s hand. Tony’s pants grow tighter, still. He smells like Barbasol. A well-respected man. Tony wants to disrespect him.
Tony smiles to himself. His eyes are leaking. It shouldn’t hurt, it shouldn’t. He thinks maybe he is biologically determined to suffer.
- - -
Tony wraps a hand around Mystery Man’s neck to level himself up. “Come with me,” he whispers, and he grazes the guy’s earlobe with his teeth. “I want to blow you.”
“You could just call,” a voice says, after a few seconds. “I thought you didn’t want to talk.”
Steve must know it's landing hollow, but he persists. He still slides himself into Tony's stiff, unyielding body, he still moves himself like it's a chore and a duty, he persists in wiping Tony's brow and tipping his fluids into Tony's panting mouth. He is so patient Tony wants to scream. He is so distant that Tony wants to die.
“Jesus, Stark,” Steve says, and kicks one of Tony’s workbenches hard enough that it collapses. “Will you stop fucking crying?”
“All morning,” Steve counters.
There’s nowhere to go. He’s down to his base layer: Tony Stark, human. He’s been here before, he’s been here so many times. His life can be measured in cycles of kicking and screaming his way back to life. He thinks a year ago he might have had a contingency plan for this. He has dirt on half of Congress. He has suits. He had friends, until very recently. Friends he would die for. Friends who would have died for him.
” Steve gasps, because Tony is three steps ahead of him and swings a leg over him and sinks down all in one fluid motion and it’s
“Don’t start with me,” Steve snaps, “I don’t like it when you conveniently forget you’re on a team.”
Steve presses his mouth together and shoves his feelings down as fast as they try to bubble up. Distance. This is why he doesn’t come to Midtown, this is – a disaster.
him more than a cowardly exit and excuses, god, what does he say –
“They’re going to lock me in 42’s psychiatric unit,” Tony chokes out. “That’s the protocol–”
Don't be stupid, he says, and Tony feels him bend, feels his plush mouth against the erogenous zone on the back of his neck.
They wait in a conference room and Tony feels dull and tired and middle-aged in his ill-fitting suit. Jen slaps his Klonopin into his hands.
He's too weak to do anything about it, so he lies there and feels the soft puff of the cannula taped to his face and tries to relinquish some of his lonely terror.
“Tony,” Steve says, “You have to have the surgery. You have 34 days left on the list, you could get a match any day–”
His heart flutters, but he’s been learning to ignore that.
this, you don’t get to wallow and feel sorry for yourself for what you did because it was
He looks out into a sea of strangers. Whispers run through the crowd. The front few rows he roped off, just in case, are empty. They’re not here. They think he’d arrest them for coming to Steve’s funeral.
“That’s not true,” he says. “People remember how you–”
Justification upon justification for keeping it.
“Do that again,” Steve gasps.
“Calm down, Director Stark,” someone is telling him.
, catches the rim of his cockhead on Steve’s lips. Bends to kiss him when Steve’s lips become sticky, makes it wet and filthy, and then it’s his cock nudging at Steve’s lips again. Steve dares to lap at him, just once, and Tony takes it away, leaves him flushing and wanting and hot.
You want my knot? Steve asks him. It's yours.
It’s cracked.
There’s no ice this time, but he’s freezing and cold and he can’t do that again. He won’t, he won’t, he won’t –
Tony shuts his eyes and rests his head against the bulkhead behind him.
Tony, Steve says, holding back his Voice with everything he has.
“I don’t want you here anymore,” Tony says.
Tony takes his hand and the man stares for a split-second before they’re
Carol stands up and her fists glow. “I outrank you, Shepherd,” Carol says. “I’m registered and I do have the authority to relieve you of your duty. Keep your
“But you don’t actually want me to romance you, do you,” he says, extends one leather shoe to toe at Steve’s balls. “You want to be my filthy little secret. You want me to pull your hair and tell you you look like something I could sell to Playgirl.”
“We do, actually,” Tony says, and sniffs, wipes his nose on his rolled-up shirtsleeve, “because Peter and Logan just quit and we barely made it out of there, Steve, we can’t sit on our thumbs for this one, Osborn cannot have this team, what if the next thing happens and we’re
Tony's face falls right before his eyes, but he catches himself, pulls himself together. Tony gets grace for his failures and Steve gets nothing.
Do you want me to let you die, Steve asks. Is that how you wanna go? Do you want to leave me this way?
“Neither are you,” Tony croaks, because Steve is just resting his hand on Tony’s throat, as if he were able to measure veracity through touch alone.
In Steve’s fantasies, Tony is usually on the bottom. They kiss chest to chest. Tony allows himself to be led, to be held. Steve holds him in his lap and runs his fingers down Tony’s spine. He traces every muscle like he’s doing a figure study. He sucks bruises into Tony’s neck and Tony lets him and whispers in his ear.
You smell atrocious, Steve whispers. Like. Rancid, he gets out. You smell like you're dead already but I can feel how much you hate this and you keep saying you want it and you don't, I don't.
“Sounds like you,” Steve says, back in his corner like nothing ever happened. “You’re all about executive decisions these days.”
Steve isn’t even hard.
You need to call someone, Tony tells him, and Steve tells him to
Steve’s face says he doesn’t really want to come back from this. Steve has always carried hurts in his bones.
Tony presses the gag back into Steve’s mouth, lets it rest on his tongue. Pumps it in and out of his mouth, slowly, just the first inch, a tease, an object, an empty milestone for steve to chase. He wants a performance.
Tony is shaking out a fresh shirt. He stands facing the window to put it on. “Have your people call my people,” he says. His voice is flat, unreadable. “You know where I live,” he says, quieter.
The sun goes behind the clouds and Steve’s hulking statue casts Tony into shadow.
The unfairness of it burns in him. He is a greedy man; he wants to cradle Tony to his chest, he wants to wake him up with a kiss, he wants to comb Tony’s body for his off-switch and break it so he can have Tony’s undivided attention forever. He wants this, again.
“Okay,” Tony agrees, and moves down Steve’s body.
like it was yesterday.
She ends up staying the rest of the month, and Tony makes the decision to dissolve SI West entirely.
Steve’s throat is raw. He looks at his wrists, looks at the pile of towels. Looks at Tony’s empty glass on the coffee table.
It’s his favorite place to go, these days.
Someone touches him and Tony flinches away. He knows he should fight but he is dizzy and cold and fumbling his way to death. He doesn’t manage it, he stays where he is, his face pressed to the concrete, his limbs chained together.
Tony doesn’t warn Steve when he’s coming. Steve keeps it in his mouth, crawls back up Tony’s body, carefully holds himself over Tony’s prone body without touching, without weight, kisses the taste of him right back into Tony’s mouth.
, all incalculable intensity and selfless performance.
someone extorting you?”
“Tony, no,” he says, and his mouth tastes like Tony, he’s going to be tasting Tony for the next week. “Just touch me, please touch me, please–”
His gaze goes hard and angry and Tony can’t look away. Steve doesn’t have to move a muscle in his entire face, his eyes telegraph everything and anything Tony could ever hope to know.
They’ve always had their rough patches. As a team, as the two of them. Wanda was bad, but it’s the confluence of all of it, this time. The tower. Thor, dead. Bucky, fake-dead. Norman Osborn.
Fuck, Steve says,
“You can be mad at me,” Tony says. “But I am not responsible for your survivor’s guilt, that’s not fair.”
Steve looks at the rest of him instead. He tries to remind himself that this is a luxury. He needs to savor it. He tries to memorize Tony and thinks about someone finding them like this, thinks of all the cheap things they would say about them. Thinks of how many cheap things people have already said about Tony. He wraps his hand around Tony again, rolls his balls in his palm, thinks that the least he can do is make Tony feel something good.
die again.
Steve hears himself moaning and can’t string any sort of rebuke together. It’s dishonest.
Tony feels one of his teeth come loose, feels his cheekbone fracture, scrabbles blindly to put his hands on Steve’s body.
I want to stop trying, Tony says.
But Steve sinks his teeth into Tony's neck and it's so perfect he wants to die so nothing can ever ruin it.
Tony has been crying. His eyes are puffy and his hair is peroxide yellow and his chin is covered in day-old stubble. He’s wearing sweatpants with his wallet jammed in the waistband. He’s clutching a meaty file folder to his chest.
Tony is pressing the flat of his palm to his length, grimacing, glancing at Steve in the mirror with a look that says he is running simulations. He is gauging how far to push, how far he wants to be pushed, how far he wants Steve to take him.
“This is stupid, Tony,” Steve sighs. “You have broken ribs–”
“I can’t do this,” Steve says.
Steve sits back on his heels and learns what it’s like to be the source of all misery in the universe.
“That’s your excuse,” Steve says, and blinks and blinks because he’s ruining Tony’s coffee. He rummages in the cabinet for his French press, shoves his kettle in the sink, opens the coffee bag so forcefully he rips the side of it. “You’re really gonna commit to your stupid sacrifice play–”
Last year at this time, they were sleeping together. Steve was young and stupid and he let Tony love him and the future was as of yet unwritten. He still believed that the thing between them was love.
It’s been some time since Steve has seen Tony in a suit. He’s thinner now, less bulky. He can’t train like he used to. Steve will never flip him onto a gym mat again. He’s no less attractive, objectively. He’s wearing a red shirt, some dark grey 3-piece thing. It’s an event. Steve’s noticing now, the way he actually showered, did his hair so it flips, dabbed cover-up under his eyes because the paparazzi drift around them like a gathering storm.
Tony's kneeling-collapsed on the shower tile, in Steve's lap. Steve's cock, fully hard, bobs between them. One of them is naked. What's my temperature, Tony asks, but all he can focus on is Steve's neck, is the way Steve keeps touching him. Stop, Tony says, Stop.
“I know you’ve made up your mind,” Strange tells him. How unfair, that it’s only now, under cover of darkness, behind Stephen’s heavy oak doors – that he is understood. That he is seen. That they can let this ugly secret thing between them out in the open for a little while. “But people always want them back,” Strange continues quietly. “You know, Tony came to me, after Norman Osborn–”
They've never had a natural rut together, certainly not a chemically-induced super-soldier fugue.
The man touches his elbow.
Leonard raises his hands.  “Are you going to shoot me, Tony?” Leonard says, in that damnably calm voice.
“Tony,” he says, and Tony wonders if Extremis will let him die, this time.
The beat drums through him and Tony does what he does best, compartmentalizes for now, because it’s easy to trade in regret, easier to get lost in it. It’s easier still to get lost looking at this man’s body. The details are just wrong enough to make him feel ok about it: a bronze thatch of hair on his bare chest, bottle-blond bedhead. Tony has never seen anyone as blond except Steve, not really, not without help, but this guy is pretty enough to pull it off, and after he sticks his feet for a minute he
Maria makes it clear she thinks it’s inappropriate, but what is he going to do? No one wants to look at Tony Stark. He’s growing pale, too much time in the suit. He probably has a dress uniform somewhere, but this is what he wore to all of his friends’ funerals, so it's good enough for his agents'.
Tony still sees space racing out in front of him every time he closes his eyes. He wanted that light – blinding, impossible - to be Steve. Even now he wants Steve to be saving him.
Steve leaves him for hours.
The man looks at him a little too long, nods, jerks his thumb. “You’re in.” His voice is straight Brooklyn.
A flinch goes through Tony. “I’m still baseline human–”
– like it’s the last time he’ll ever get to do it
Steve’s jaw clenches.
He draws out a single cigarette and looks to his left. The man next to him has been watching – Steve isn’t stupid, he knows what he looks like. Knows he commands attention. This man is tall and brunette and muscular, deep brown eyes, too-tanned skin. He offers Steve a light and Steve dips his head and murmurs thanks and turns away like it’s nothing, like he doesn’t love it, like he isn’t flushing hard enough that his cheeks feel hot.
So what was I, Nat asks him. You don't have mistresses, Steve -
Steve throws his coffee in the trash and goes home to take a shower.
“I just want to help,” Steve offers. “Will you let me help you, at least?”  He reaches out to touch Tony’s shoulder and Tony flinches violently away.
The music is making Steve mad, the relentless drive of the beat eggs him on, like time will stretch out forever if he doesn’t
“ – this crazy SOB was in charge–”
“I want you to get angry about the tear in your heart,” Steve says, because he is, because it’s been brimming in his bones and seething in him and he can’t fucking stand it, Tony sleeping until noon and outsourcing his contracts and Tony sliding into this pathetic wan shade of himself. “I want you to be pissed about this, Tony, I want you to decide that you’re gonna beat this, ok–”
When he comes back to himself, he’s being loaded onto a stretcher. Someone is fitting a blanket around him. Red light strobes over the sidewalk and he’s borne into the back of an ambulance. He’s lucid enough to feel the needle going into his arm. They tell him it’s for clots. They tell him he’s confused.
Steve stands there with his hand on the bare brick and turns his back and walks up the stairs.
It's dark. The window is open. Steve is brushing something over his forehead, is peeling off the patches on his arm. Maybe not, the hands are unsteady. Very un-Steve-like.
He hefts Tony into the armchair in the corner while he strips the bed. He gets stuck on a corner: he pulls it and pulls it until he rips the sheet, and then he slides down to sit on the floor and cries. He's always been an ugly crier: blotchy-faced, red-eyed, snotty as hell.
Steve is working on how to tell him he doesn’t know how to exist in a world without Tony when Tony collapses in the hallway.
He cries. He sees Nebula's dark eyes and feels her prosthetic arm on his spindly wrist and he is dimly aware that his chest feels hollow.
You don’t have to look at the body, he tells himself, and he pulls on socks with shaky hands. Don’t look at the body, he thinks, and he marches past the gym and the Director’s office and all the men and women in uniforms who whisper about him behind his back.
He kisses Tony, tries to put everything he has behind it, and Tony just melts into it, his shirt sliding half off his shoulders, his cock soft against Steve’s belly. He lets Steve hold him, lets himself be divested of his shirt, lets Steve lean him gently back onto the couch and drag his legs up over his shoulders and takes it, takes all of it, the softness and the touch and the kisses he doesn't think he deserves.
and Tony says
“I try not to make a habit of assisted suicide,” Stephen Strange tells him.
He is so close to oblivion like this. Steve gets him as close to peace as he's likely to feel in this lifetime. It's just harder, now. Tony's poisoned their little well. He has to work harder to lose himself. He grinds down. He presses himself into Steve's flesh, wants to feel every inch of him, wants the heat, wants to live here forever -
is swallowed up in
He's wearing gloves tonight, fingerless and leather, more for Steve than for Tony. They help Steve go under, he claims; they evoke a time when he was brutal and adrift and alone and he would have done anything to have this.
Tony actually shudders under his hands. It’s only Steve’s preternatural hearing that lets him pick up Tony’s barely-there whimper.
Steve’s mouth is slightly open, like he could kiss Tony if he wanted to, if they were still in love. He’s still bleeding, Tony realizes. It’s all Tony can feel, the ash falling on his face, the slick of red dripping out of Steve’s mouth onto Tony’s cheek.
Steve sighs. He shouldn’t, but no one is perfect, and sometimes, on days like these, bad days, it’s like they never got past it the first time, like they’re
“This isn’t a trial,” she says. “And if –
Tony is crying; Steve can only tell because his face is shining and wet. “Good things,” Tony says, staring at the ceiling.
The usher stares at his chest for a moment longer and takes in Steve, drawn up to his full height, and holds open the doors.
He moves like he’s had training. Dancing lessons. The rev is bothered. Tony will have to ask Jan about it the next time she takes him out to dinner to tell him she’s worried about him. He must be falling out of touch, out of favor, out of circles. A New York blueblood Tony doesn’t know? Maybe not, maybe he has a wife back home in Levittown. Tony doesn’t care. He thinks he should fall out of touch more often.
“Then why is he in here,” Tony says, shuffling through Steve’s notes like nothing is wrong, like he doesn’t look wretched and his beard isn’t coming in all over his cheeks. “We have Thaddeus Ross on the team, we let anyone join up these days, what is this – Cloak and Dagger won’t be on a team with me, Steve,” he says, bitter and exhausted.
Steve tries very hard to go about his life, but the knowledge of how they have wounded each other and his impotent, useless anger follow him. His nightmares persist: sometimes Tony is erasing him, sometimes Tony is laughing. Sometimes Tony tells him he’s a fucking idiot and it was all a game. He was never needed.
Steve is sitting in one of the chairs by the doors, looking like he has an axe to grind.
Tony gave him all the tools this time, put the armor in his hands. Welcomed his sentence at Steve’s hand. History does repeat, it seems. Steve couldn’t go through with it last time, either, so death found him first.
Steve looks as exhausted as Tony feels. He puts a pillow under Tony's hips, arranges his feet, gently massages his genitals like he's tempering Tony's body.
Tony doesn’t stop him, doesn’t ask for a condom. Steve sucks him with his tongue jammed up against the underside of Tony’s cock, drool sliding down his chin, and Tony’s hands eventually find his head and tangle in his hair.
“I’m leaving, Tony,” Steve says, his voice carefully neutral, poking his head into their bedroom. The helicopter is landing in 10 minutes. He shrugs into his holster, tugs at the shoulder strap. It’s 4 p.m. Tony hasn’t been out of bed today. “Shouldn’t take more than a few hours, ok?”
Steve remembers watching that, Tony, raising that golden fist to the sky like a god.
“Our relationship was intimate,” she tells the commissioner, and Tony closes his eyes.
Steve pulls him up and Tony chokes on his blood. He can’t find his breath, but he is close enough to feel Steve’s. Steve’s hair is poking through the cowl. Steve’s shield clatters to the ground. Steve’s hands are on his skin and Tony would live this death a thousand times just to feel it.
- - -
After Russia, Tony tries. He shivers. It feels like the wrong thing to say. Too close to an accusation.
“There was this asshole,” Tony says. “And he thought he was better than everyone else. He didn’t pay attention to what he did, he didn’t care where he was going. He lived without intent.”
Steve thinks he has terrible taste in men, but then the slender column of the man’s throat moves and Steve is
, Tony wants to say.
He can’t help the moan that comes out of his throat; he doesn’t want to. He nurtures his anger, he keeps the thing in his mouth even when Tony lets go, suckles at it, imagines it’s Tony’s cock, lets Tony touch him everywhere, lets Tony pinch him and bring tears to his eyes and yank on his lead and close his fingers around the base of the plug.
“Where is this coming from,” Steve chokes out. “Do you,” and Steve can barely make himself say the words out loud. “Do you not want this? A relationship? With. Me?”
“I painted it gold,” Tony says weakly. “So I won’t look like a monster. So they’d trust me.”
, he thinks, and crawls back into bed, shivering.
Tony thinks, and laughs and awful barking laugh, blood bubbling up on his tongue.
He unzips his pants, reaches into his underwear – black, unremarkable, wet-smelling – and pulls himself out. He is hard. Steve realizes he’s been hard, it was in his walk, imagines him on the phone with Thunderbolt Ross and his cock tucked away in Steve’s mouth, imagines them talking about him, they want to put him in prison, they want to lock him up, they want to make him disappear, Tony’s the only one who knows he’s here, Tony could do anything to him –
The man looks to be about Tony’s height, towering over almost everyone on the dance floor, his movements loose and easy and confident. He strides, people part for him. Half his face is hidden by some ridiculous mask like what Steve used to wear – and that sets off little waves of something sharp and leaden in Tony’s gut – but this man is
He takes good care of Tony. He wipes down his skin as much as he dares without disrupting the scent layer he's been painstakingly trying to establish. He smears his come on the Synth-O patches and places them gently. He dutifully performs his 14 hours of surface contact a day. He hauls an entire fridge into the elevator from the game room. He tips bottles of water against Tony's chapped lips. He lets Tony mix his come into chocolate pudding and he does his best not to seem hurt that Tony can't keep it down unadulterated.
“Shut up, Mike,” Gary says, breathless, as they slide their window open. “You’re gonna wake Steve up.”
Steve was always good at reading the room, knew how to shock and awe and sober. Knew when he’d slipped back into the past. Knew when to leave.
“I may have lied to you, but you’re a
Steve is almost unrecognizable in death.
Tony has run through a lifetime of sympathy for Steve. Tony has bled for him and thrown himself bodily in front of him and sold his principles before governing bodies for him. Steve has savaged him for the last time.
shape, Christ –
“It’s not even the tabloids,” Tony spits, “It’s everyone, that was their takeaway, not ‘Avengers Save World From Death Serpent,’ it’s ‘Tony Stark’s Alcoholism Rears Ugly Head,’ Steve, you don’t want me on the team right now, I don’t know if you know this but people
“You don’t get to know them,” Tony tells him. “Yes or no.”
He looks, finally, for once, like an old man, like someone who has died of protracted, relentless illness. Frail, delicate, weak. Those hideous gaping wounds in his chest, in his stomach. His outstretched arms like he is offering himself up to death. His mouth is open, in a scream. Tony thinks about Sal, how his body was torn open, how all they could really recover was gore.
Steve is at the landing when he hears it, and it’s bad today, because Tony isn’t even trying to stifle the ugly wet sobs Steve can hear coming through the heavy oak door.
The village, where vice isn’t vice and all his worst ideas are acceptable. He fumbles for the card in his belt, runs his thumb over the stamp.
“Tony,” he says. He can’t keep the hurt out of his voice. “When, why didn’t you–”
He has imagined this moment ad nauseam. He has lain in bed and traced his fingers over the same places on his body where the bullets entered Steve’s, has imagined what it is to bleed out in four places.
He wonders out loud if he’s having an aneurysm.
Steve leaves him to his own devices, mostly, sneaks away to Howard’s office to plan his search for the New Team. (“We need some old friends,” Tony had said, looking utterly defeated, before Osborn had even shown up, before they’d even been back to visit the rubble of the tower.) It’s partly self-serving, he knows, but he doesn’t want Tony to stumble onto a half-composed roster. Not now, it’s been barely six weeks since they dusted the rubble off their boots and retreated here to haunt the place and it still feels like they’re squatting.
A club, it’s just a club.
“No,” Steve grunts, and laces his fingers in with Tony’s, dips his head to kiss Tony’s collarbone. “I’ll be fine.”
“Fix it,” Steve is saying, and Steve is crying at him. “Fucking fix this, Tony.”
He pulls away, chest heaving. He’s flushing again. Always so transparent. Tony looks at him, dazed and hungry.
In the morning, Tony feels almost himself.
Maybe it’s the novelty. He can’t tear his eyes away. He thinks, at first, it must be a swinger’s club – but then he realizes: there’s everything, there’s everyone. There are two men with their hands on each other, there’s a man dressed in full drag batting his eyelashes at one of those wrestler types that are becoming popular in the racier magazines. There’s a woman just feet in front of him, shirt open, nipples just visible, and she mouths the words to the song and smiles an easy, loose smile, joint aloft as she dips and twists and laughs to herself. Shameless.
if he doesn’t find that warm place his cock wants. This place isn’t about idleness; neither of them have really stopped moving. Even now the man is running one hand through Steve’s hair, grinding up against his leg in a slow, filthy seduction, undoing his own belt with his other hand.
He humps at air, unrecognizable to himself. The bed creaks and Steve is so solid and he bores into Tony's body and he is rapture and he smells amazing and he says
Tony barks out a laugh. “Of course you did,” he says. “I bet Rubell fuckin’ loved you, wanted to climb you like a tree and fuck you over the balcony–”
The bed dips. Steve smells like the masking cream, neutral, fresh. Hardly the monster who was fucking him hours ago. A rustling, like Steve is getting ready to settle in behind him. A wave of something Tony can no longer discern.
In this fucking pipe dream, Tony apologizes, begs for forgiveness.
“Around,” Tony repeats, and he’s wringing his hands again, back and forth, twisting and knotting his fingers together. “And you just
Tony’s eyes snap up to meet Steve’s. He looks awful, up close, carries dark circles under his eyes. He doesn’t look sated or well-fucked or moderately content. He looks like Steve feels. Like he wants to stop.
Tony presses the hand without the incursion alarm over Steve's mouth. "No talking," Tony cautions, "lay back," Tony says, and Steve clutches that fucking ball and presses his mouth shut because Steve isn't sloppy like Tony, doesn't mix up his imperatives or his priorities, Steve is
He lets Tony sleep. He lies on his back, aware that there is a body next to him and there is a wall between them and it is his fault. Tony’s eyes dart behind his closed eyelids and Steve thinks about the way they went eerie and white when Tony sent that pulse through himself, thinks about the way his body jerked as the arc brought the ceiling down on them.
- - -
Steve cradles his face. “It’s there,” he soothes. “It just doesn’t belong to you right now.”
“No,” Tony says.
I fucking can,” Tony roars at him.
His eyes find Steve’s as he’s pulled away: sitting in the commissioner’s chair, turning the gavel over in his hands, judge, jury, executed.
It still couldn’t save me, he doesn’t say. It still didn’t heal all the wounds. It opened some new ones that never closed. I learned volumes about new kinds of pain.
It’s not what he wanted, not exactly, but it’s closer. It’s further away from kindness. It’s more like a favor. It’s more impersonal. He probably would have died if he’d been allowed inside Tony’s body. It’s probably not the sort of drug you can try just once.
You're bonded, Nat is insisting. How did you -
, he wants to snarl. He knows what a death sentence looks like.
, buried, unmoving, so close that it’s unfair to both of them, he knows, and he can feel the gasp run through Tony’s body, feels it hitch in Tony’s chest and Steve bites his earlobe and Tony halfheartedly tries to get away but he’s moaning, he’s saying something unintelligible and Steve can feel the weight of his cock, the heat of it, trapped between them.
She's running. Tony smells grass and autumn night and dew and the river. He's home, he must be home. There are voices all around and his vision is spotty and he insists, weakly, that he can walk himself. That it's not so dire.
Steve ends up down at street level because he sees a flash of red and shining gold and his heart leaps in his chest.
This is not like flying in the suit, not even the first time - this is terror. His fingers are stiff where they grip bare metal, his heart is whole and beating like his life is about to end. His eyes are freezing open. He is being dragged through the air.
Okay, Steve says. He sounds tired. He sounds like he sounded after Insight. Eager to relinquish responsibility. Weary of the game. You still - do you want my skin? You're still not stable, he says,
Tony looks at him, red-rimmed eyes and greasy hair and he sets his mouth into a firm line. “No one wants a drunk on the team, Steve,” he says.
“If you wanted to go to a meeting,” she says carefully. “I could probably swing it.”
“If you weren’t an alcoholic, I wouldn’t have to,” Steve tells him, and Tony closes his eyes as if he can will him away.
“I know,” Steve says, and hushes him, kisses him back until his mouth is red and swollen and Tony is falling asleep on his shoulder, still hanging out of his pants. He fixes that, pulls Tony’s underwear back up, eases his pants off, undoes his tie for him. That’s the tricky thing, these days, making sure his hands are always gentle. Conjuring Tony as he used to be, braver and stronger and less pathetic.
“My kid was in that school,” one of them says. “My fucking kid died because of you, Stark.”
, and it’s wrong on his face, it’s cruel and callous and nothing like Tony.
The elevator stops and the lights don’t come on. They crowd him; someone is on their knees and putting their fingers in his hair. He bites someone’s bare arm and gets his face bashed into the tube wall for his trouble. They hold him there, his legs twisted under him, one of his eyes swollen shut, his breath coming in ragged wheezing gasps.
Dreams are different, now. Tony is using his whole brain; he has surpassed those pedestrian notions of the soul and the subconscious. Everything that’s ever happened to him is written in ones and zeros, available to peruse at his leisure. Tony can wander in regret and wallow freely.
It’s the wrong thing to say, because Tony’s eyes are fixed on his face – not casual lust anymore, something shrewd and searching and calculated. He’s working out a problem, and Tony never stops until he gets what he’s after. “What’s your game, mister,” Tony says, his voice strangled and tight.
Tony runs his fingers over his chest, under the collar of his shirt. Over the port where his fake heart used to be.
Tony tells him he's a fucking liar. You had a phone, he says. I thought you left me to die, he bursts. My ribcage was cracked, Steve. Do you know what that was like, after Afghanistan? Do you know what you fucking did?
(Jesus, Cap, someone had said.)
“I’m trying,” Tony says because the justice of it all is paralyzing. He is too wrung for tears and too spent for anger and even in death, Steve has never lied to him.
The anklet is wide and golden and degrading.
“Why do you do this,” Steve says, finally. “Why do you act like you’re not worth anything to the rest of us?”
“I got you,” Steve says, and then they’re out of the cloud, they’re in clear blue sky, and Steve
, he doesn't say.
“That we just fucked, Steve? Should I not say that?”
His life is Tony, now, and Tony’s life is being stolen out from under him.
the whisper comes again.
One day, Steve wakes up without anger.
They bake him a cake, as if he is a child. They bring it out with a single lit candle, but no one bothers to suggest that the fluorescent lights be turned off. He’s wheeled right up to the table. There are words on the cake, but he doesn’t know what they say. He hopes this doesn’t turn into an exercise in pushing his comfort zone.
Extremis goes offline for the last time, and Tony looks at Steve for the first time in a long time through his own inadequate, human eyes.
“I should go,” Steve says, and turns.
Tony feels jagged, unpalatable. All the things he says are slightly too mean. Too intense. Not enough.
Steve presses his hands over his face. He looks almost contrite, almost, for just a split-second. I don't want this for us, he murmurs, but there's no accusation in it, only raw, frayed sadness.
Steve jerks his hips forward and Tony gasps out a laugh.
A trickle of red peeks out of Tony’s nose. It looks like tar; his skin is so pale in the lamplight.
Everything is collapsing.
Tony watches his face like Steve is a puzzle he could assemble in his sleep. It is torturously, deliriously good. It’s just the wrong edge of painful, it takes all of his focus to beat back his panic: he isn’t actually dying, the serum can take more than that.
Steve slides one gloved hand over Tony’s cheek and Tony doesn’t dare breathe. He can't bear it if it's real; he can't abide it if it's not.
“Then it’s fine,” Steve says. “Jocasta knows. You programmed her, remember?”
“Can you see that,” Tony asks her, and points to the spider web crack Steve has left in the drywall.
. Tony's heart feels loud and too fast. He's burning. He feels his forehead, just to be sure. Steve, he cautions, and Steve is already denning, locking the door, drawing the shades on the window.
Steve starts to fuck his face.
someone because I wasn’t good enough, what do I do with that?”
Steve nods. “Maybe you did,” he says, carefully, “but we’ll fix it.” Steve says. He’s close enough to reach Tony’s knees, scabbed and scraped and bandaged, but he puts his hands there, solid, warm, grounding (he hopes). He kneads Tony’s thighs, he tries to catch Tony’s eye.
She smiles a sad smile. “This is it. He needs the transplant, he’s not in a good place for eligibility unless you can get him to go through with the apheresis. Not unless you have a clone up your sleeve,” the doctor says. She stands on her toes to pat him on the shoulder.
The signal in his palm is pulsing, now. He's not attending to the incursion.
Tony falls asleep like that, Steve’s arms around him, Steve’s face dampening his shirt.
It’s fine, it has to be fine. Out of his mind, here and now, sweat and sex and this Adonis with the beautiful ass. Step, step, step, and the man dips him, twirls him. Tony is breathless and knows maybe it’s the coke, maybe he’s been pushing too hard lately, knows that his heart sometimes flips in his chest and it isn’t the romance, but this is so different from the colorless world he usually inhabits that he doesn’t even care. He would let this man dance him to death if it meant that he could keep feeling this way. The rev likes this man.
For all Steve's unchecked violence, he won't knot him now, when it matters most.
“Do you not trust me with this,” Steve asks, each word carefully chosen.
Steve has another fantasy.
“Do you want me to fuck you,” Steve says, because the head of his cock is bumping the back of Tony’s throat and he isn’t gonna last if he keeps going at warp 10 like this –
, what the fuck do you want me to do about Thanos anyway, what can I do that a god and whatever - Carol is - can't, Nat, I'm just
Tony drifts around the living area. He toes at the file folders strewn over Steve’s floor, doesn’t comment on how they got there. He turns a picture of Bucky’s brainwashed face over.
When he opens his eyes, Steve is gone.
Strange is silent for a long moment. “I’m not sure I can do it,” he confesses. “You undid it the first time all on your own, it’s complicated magic–”
- - -
“I hate this,” Steve says. “It’s all of it, all at once – this Bucky thing. And you. And. I didn’t think I was going to be around people.”
“Am I dying,” Steve says. It’s pathetic, it comes out as a hoarse little whisper. He’s trying to remember if he has affairs to put in order. He’s dimly aware of his heartbeat. He thinks he had ideas about his own death. He thinks he’s been meaning to die for a while.
Steve's always been dragging that frozen mausoleum of his around. Tony picks up wood to build his own pyre. They've never been able to really open the link with the chasm between them. Steve likes to blame the serum. It's easier than an admission: complicity, love.
He feels what little is left of the bond
Whatever Steve had worked up, it vanishes, just like that.
Tony feels himself sliding out of his body again. He is vaguely aware of Jen, shifting beside him. She passes something to him hidden beneath one well-manicured green hand over his knee as if she means to ground him.
Once upon a time Tony would have met him at the door.
, Steve.”
Steve has been seeing through people’s bullshit since 1918, and tells Rhodey so.
“I needed a change,” he says hoarsely. It’s so thin, they both know it. Tony’s face is completely blank.
“How’s your girlfriend,” Steve asks, and shoves a single fry in his mouth. “Amara? Pretty,” he says. “She looks smarter than you.”
It’s a setback. Tony’s access to SHIELD is more limited, now, but he’s clever enough that he’s irreplaceable, for them. The number of contracts he takes plummets, but he’s still thick as thieves with Maria Hill. Tony manages to work up some of his erstwhile charm and talks her into a deal for one of their training facilities in Florida that they abandoned when their budget got slashed along with everyone else’s.
He says. I didn't know what to say to you. So I didn't say anything at all.
Steve doesn't like that, and a half-snarl curls out of his throat before he grits his teeth. He rucks up the back of Tony's gown, doesn't even ask about it, doesn't preface it with
Tony pulls on the strap and Steve whimpers.
Tony’s face crumbles faster than he can put his walls back up. “So?” he says, his gaze slack somewhere over Steve’s shoulder. “We can pretend, you can pretend I’m the stranger you thought I was and I can–”
The sky still has nothing on Steve’s eyes, Tony thinks.
“I think you’re mixing me up with someone else,” Tony says ruefully. “6’5”, red and gold?”
Someone is crying.
“Do you think this is funny,” Carol snaps. “I don’t want to watch you go through this, Tony–”
“I miss you when you’re not here,” Tony is saying, and Steve feels Tony’s length drag along his tongue before Tony’s back in his throat again. His vision is collapsing. He doesn’t mind, it’s nice here. Blood roars in his ears.
Steve doesn’t expect Tony to chase him, but he should know better.
He finds he’s nodding to himself, tapping his foot to the beat. Yes, this is better. This is for him.
The rest of it, the ride in the helicopter, the way Tony’s face gets paler and paler, the way they have to drain one of his lungs and his hand goes slack in Steve’s fades into a nightmarish blur.
he might have a friend but Rhodey knows all his dirty secrets, has cleaned up all his messes more than once.
“Take a breath,” Tony tells him, and he slides just the tip of his cock onto Steve’s tongue. He tastes like Tony’s cotton/poly underwear, salty. Tony is cut and Steve would spend hours dragging his mouth over the velvety pebbled skin of him if Tony would let him.
“I sound like a real asshole,” Steve gasps. “Have we met?”
I wanted to give you a choice, Steve says, wretched, and it's the first time Tony's heard his voice in two years. He sounds older. You didn't break the bond right, he chokes out, like he's barely holding back his own tears.
It’s evening. It’s starting to snow and he hasn’t closed his curtains. He doesn’t remember falling asleep; he doesn’t remember taking his clothes off. He doesn’t sleep naked anymore. He doesn’t like to look at his body. He doesn’t have anyone to impress.
“Yeah, Tony,” he concedes. “I’m sorry. I’m here.”
Rhodey says, “Ok, you need to listen to me,” and Steve puts down his assault rifle and sits on a moldy wooden crate and braces himself.
Steve looks at him, a fight starting in his jaw. He shakes his head, casts his gaze down. He wipes his nose. Tony feels absence when he slides out of bed. He retrieves cool cloths and new sheets and a new gown and linens for Tony. He produces sweats from somewhere.
No, says Steve. Not for a long time.
He drives the nine blocks and parks up on the sidewalk in front of the tower complex. The doorman holds the doors open and people stare at him as he takes an eternity crossing the giant Resilient branding on the floor to get to the elevator. He supposes that soon it, too, will be gone. He tries to imagine the tower filled with strangers. With civilians. He doesn’t recognize anyone behind the desk, these days. They don’t know him, either – he leans on the counter while they call security and get him a retina scan.
“Tony, it’s me,” he says softly, letting himself in through the thick oak door. He knows better than to slip in unannounced. He’d like to avoid panic, or flight today.
Tony can’t go too fast, can’t gorge himself on the shit he used to eat, can’t fly across the country to Malibu whenever he has an itch. There’s a wire sticking out of his stomach now, with a controller and a battery pack.
“No,” Tony says. “No.”
“Fuck me, come inside me,” Steve says again. “Make it hurt,” he says, imagines a world where he doesn’t have to climb onto a jet after this, a world where Tony locks him under his desk and keeps him full and hurts him every hour on the hour.
You know, you still haven't apologized, Tony says.
“Ok, I know. Just look at me,” Carol murmurs. Tony looks at his hands and reminds himself that his lungs can expand to fill his chest now, that he is mostly whole. That he is unremarkable with the fucking anklet and the situation has spiraled out of his control, he needs a drink, he needs a drink –
“What’s my name,” the man says, and when Steve can blink his eyes open he gets to look up into a handsome face and bright blue eyes. He would have been gone for this guy, once upon a time, he thinks. He has the sort of face that starts wars.
His face is burning but the couples and throuples and groups he passes don’t give a shit that he’s pulling up his briefs and stuffing himself back into his spandex pants, god, he did that, Tony did that, that’s Tony, did Tony recognize him, Jesus, what has he done –
“Where’s your contingency plan, Director,” he says.
Steve swallows, once, twice, three times. “I don’t know the parameters.”
Steve blinks. He sniffs, as surreptitiously as he’s able, but Tony just smells like stale sweat and tears and a tiny hint of copper where his bare feet have found the crystal shards all over the floor.
He’s so naked in the face of Tony’s ire, so defenseless, his hot shame on display for Tony and the rats to see.
“Do you want to come properly or not,” Tony says.
“Okay,” Steve says.
“She means your trial,” Steve says.
“That’s not good enough,” Steve says in a hysterical whimper. “You don’t get to die,
It comes out too confident, too defensive, like he’s sure of himself. Like he’s not sorry for any of it. Tony’s whole body goes stiff and he picks his head up and
Tony pushes his sushi around and finally just sets down his chopsticks entirely. “What do you want me to say, Steve,” he sighs.
This new rule felt much like Tony's rule about not surveilling people unless given explicit permission to do so, nebulous and without any real reason. If no one knew he did it, what did it matter if he gave himself access to this woman's phone? What did it matter if he knew if Steve Rogers was not getting shot at this moment? It hurt no one for him to avail himself of this information that was so poorly guarded.
The vibrator inside of Tony cut off -- an audible lack of sound -- and the man dropped like a puppet with its strings cut. Sheve worked his cock through his own orgasm and to the other side, where his muscles started jumping and twitching to get away from the sensation.
“I've heard of it, but I find it doesn't actually help to dance around an issue until everyone's uncomfortable. Why are you so chill about this? Not to be rude Steve, but you don't seem like the open relationship type.” Natasha had in fact seen -- on multiple occasions -- how incredibly possessive Steve could be of his husband. Many a bar fight had been started over Tony Stark's supposed ‘honor’, a not insignificant number of which she had helped him finish -- which led her right back to that getting in over his head thing that Steve was so great at.
Tony probably should have thought about what would happen when Steve did inevitably come home, but -- while he was a futurist -- he rarely thought things like this through. It looked like Steve and BUCK-E were sorting it out amongst themselves though, so that was really all for the best.
"It's nothing. I'm fine," Steve choked out.
“No, that was between the two of you and Steve. BUCK-E went out of his way to make it so, and I'm not going to disrespect that. Will you tell me why you didn't want me to be a part of it though?”
Trying to compromise, BUCK-E grabbed hold of one of Tony’s legs and pulled the man into his lap. The new position made it much easier to touch. Tony had so many sensitive areas that it was hard to choose where to focus, but the hitch of breath he got when he ran his hands down the man's back to squeeze his buttocks was very captivating.
Steve was so distracted by his task that he almost missed when Tony let out a whimper as the vibrator was kicked up another level. The man gave little thrusts into the air and Steve imagined it was because it caused the toy to shift inside him just right.
“I may have spammed her phone just a bit trying to get in contact with Tony. She is more than likely still mad at me. Put in a good word?"
“That is a definite no-no. It's not nice to surveil people without their consent.” BUCK-E wasn’t sure why it mattered… If the person never knew to begin with, they could not object.
“Okay. But if you make Tony unhappy again we will have a problem.”
He burst out laughing. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation, maybe it was the fact that it had been just him and the bots (who didn’t really surprise him anymore) for weeks, maybe it was Maybelline, but that was hilarious. That little smirk was back. It looked wonderful on him, almost coy, and Tony was mentally patting himself on the back for a job well done because here was the personality he was looking for.
What worried her even more was how quickly he found the bug that she had planted. Not 15 minutes after she had left before he had it. The last thing it recorded was the man saying "I’m told it's rude to surveil people without their consent, Agent Romanoff." before abruptly cutting off.
He hadn’t expected to see Natasha Romanoff unpacking foam lined travel cases of electronics in the living room. Normally Steve would have warned him if someone needed a place to stay for a few days, so Tony wasn’t sure how to take this -- not that Natasha couldn’t visit, but she generally didn’t stop by at 11 pm with half a Bestbuy worth of computer equipment…
Tony rolled his eyes, “Just spit it out Steve.”
“And I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep.”
― Kurt Vonnegut
BUCK-E hadn’t considered that was what the fingering was leading up to, but he realized he should have -- it was generally what came next according to the Internet. He thought he would enjoy sinking his cock into Tony’s wet heat. Video evidence showed that it could be a very enjoyable act for all parties involved.
Pepper had said to make Rogers work for it, he wasn’t sure quite how to do that but he knew he didn’t trust the man yet. What was the probability that when Tony called his husband again in a few days, the man wasn’t angry about everything once again?
Even with the adjustment to his pressure relief valve there was still enough lubricant released that he could feel it run down his balls and into the crack of his buttocks to settle on the bed in a small puddle against his coccyx.
Not at all.
Whoever had been at the center of it all had covered their tracks well. Without that closure, Tony didn’t feel right keeping the weapons manufacturing open, which meant -- unless he wanted to lay off a whole lot of people and close his doors for good -- he had to find something else for the company to make. Phones, computers, and other personal technologies were easy money but the crowning glory was his arc reactor.
“Are you feeling unwell?” BUCK-E hovered over him, inspecting him for who knows what. It was ridiculously endearing.
Tony started begging but it was soft and the audio quality was poor so there were only a few words Steve could make out -- please, more, and need to come were the most used phrases. The reason it was so captivating was because Tony had turned to look almost directly at the camera, begging the person just off screen with his eyes and his words and his cries of ecstasy to let him orgasm.
“Who is he?”
He'd just gone through his first heat in the Avengers tower, His second heat in the future, and not a single Avenger came to help him through it. At first he'd thought they were waiting for Tony to come and have him first, as the Pack Alpha it was only right. But that never happened.
― Iassic Asimo
BUCK-E had heard the speech already while Tony practiced, so he decided to not to focus on it. Instead he looked out into the crowd. JARVIS had proposed a game of tag to help with his speed at identifying people.
― Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five
“So I heard you spoke to BUCK-E.”
“Oh?”
you would stay. But where the fuck are you, Steve? Huh? I sure as shit don't have any clue.” Completely without his permission, his eyes started to water, and he could feel his whole body shaking with rage. Here was holier-than-thou Rogers rearing his ugly head, because butter wouldn't melt in his mouth and he had never done a thing wrong in his whole damn life, trying to tell
“Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect.”
BUCK-E pressed a finger between Tony’s cheeks. Gently rubbing at the puckered ring of muscle and letting his dry finger catch against the skin. When he was bored of teasing, BUCK-E brought his hand around to run it through the pooling lubricant on his stomach making sure to get an even coating.
Never go to
The textural difference between the sensation was intriguing, he would have to do a longer study of it at some point, focusing on the friction coefficients and the length of time before more lubricant needed to be reapplied.
BUCK-E couldn't argue that it was a very pleasant morning activity, but now that it was over, he was once again thinking of Rogers and whether he would behave. The best person to ask would be Tony, being married to the man surely gave him an insight that BUCK-E -- who had only interacted with the man for a matter of minutes -- did not have.
Tony let the sound lull him into a doze and slowly into a deeper sleep, content in the knowledge that in that moment he was not alone
For a few long minutes Tony and Steve just stared at each other through the monitor. Tony wasn’t sure what to say and Steve had that constipated look on his face he got whenever he was psyching himself up to have an uncomfortable conversation.
“He did not. I triangulated his location based on the cell towers that were in the area. He is at a military installation just outside of Washington DC.”
He almost fumbled his phone to the floor as he propped it up on the nightstand to free up both of his hands.
was totally and completely unacceptable. Not going to happen. No matter how good it would feel to tell Steve right where to shove it.
Tony hadn’t even realized he’d fallen asleep, but he was sure that it had been hours because he didn't have that annoying persistent pounding behind his eyes any more. He would have slept even longer if he hadn't been so rudely awoken by the sound of a ringing phone circa 1980. It was, without a doubt, some form of retribution on Jarvis’s part for making him call in his pizza order earlier. Tony swore Jarvis was the pettiest person he knew.
Sorry for not paying on a schedule. I truly don't know why I thought I'd be able to do such a thing... Here's the next chapter❤️
“Yeah, I hate that about myself too. I also make him happy though, and I hope to do that more often than not.”
After Nat packed up and left -- leaving behind some very nice, very legil-looking papers -- Tony collapsed into the couch, thoroughly exhausted. He honestly decided to set aside the whole 'BUCK-E is hacking into secure mainframes' thing aside. There was really only one person he could have learned it from and the point was really moot now, wasn't it, he had already learned. Tony could chastise them both but that would be rather hypocritical seeing as he was the one that taught Jarvis…
Once the toy was no longer blocking his ability to think, Steve wound the cord until he could see the remote and turn the damn thing off.
The curtain around the freestanding bath is drawn. The room smells like tobacco, like clay. The water sound gets louder and he steps barefoot into a cold puddle of water that bounces the scant light of the sunrise around the room.
Turns out, now they just look through him.
You can’t miss what you’ve never had.
Steve blinks. “That’s it,” he says incredulously. “That’s – really?”
, Tony wants to tell him.
The world spins on without him.
Tony thinks about the sound of his laugh, about the way Tony thought he was having a heart attack for the first time in years the first time Steve kissed him. It’s enough; Tony’s stood in Steve’s shadow for a lifetime and every day was a feast. A privilege.
When Tony comes to, Steve is trying to fix it.
“Those aren’t yours,” Tony sniffs, and lunges for them, but Steve is faster, and Steve isn’t encumbered by human weakness and bone-deep fatigue and mediocrity. He holds them out of Tony’s reach.
Steve could say.
Tony looks at his hands. “I had a heart attack.”
Tony turns back, and the room has changed. Steve’s body sits atop a slab, but the slab is one of the slide-out bench beds on the submarine from a lifetime ago. Water drips onto the floor.
“I can’t tell you how much I want you,” Steve tells him.
. It's better.
He falls on his back, and the air is cut with the smell of forest and gore and metal and burning rubber. The mud soaks into his clothes, runs up his back – he blinks, his eyes are burning, he can’t find his feet –
“I’m not living there,” Steve tells him, and doesn’t touch the burger.
Tony says,
“Tony,” she says. “There’s nothing there.
A waitress appears out of nowhere with a burger, just like Steve always orders it. A pile of hand-cut fries. Bacon, cheese. The finer things. Tony waits, gets this look in his eyes, like everything might be okay if Steve just doesn’t leave. If they can just get through a meal together.
Their last conversation goes something like this:
“I know,” Steve says.
“I should have known, you move like a goddamn ballerina, Steve,” Tony says. “You blush like no one I’ve ever seen. What the fuck did I do to deserve this, why now, why this, why like this–“
Tony’s smile is threadbare. “Okay,” he says. “Right to business. I got your delivery. You don’t want the mansion?”
They take his suits away. He is allowed to watch as they pack them up one-by-one and label them and put them in a SHIELD-secure location.
“You know, we can hear you, sparkles–”
, he says, over and over, until he almost believes it.
“Get up,” Steve says. “Get up, Tony.”
Steve sets his jaw. Swallows. Looks Tony right in the eye.
“I fucking know now,” Tony says, and he’s flushing. He shoves his hands in his pockets, but not before Steve can see how they’re shaking.
“If you were asking nicely, you wouldn’t be able to speak, Steve,” Tony snarls.
He laughs.
He needs to get upstairs, where there are strangers to tell him how glamorous he looks and press alcohol into his hands. The rev is building; he needs an anchor. He can already feel his heart pounding in his chest. Dancing would be better; it would feel less like he’s dying again. He should cancel with the cardiologist, he’s starting to think he doesn’t want to stop doing this.
Steve starts to say,
Steve sits back on his heels and swears. There’s nothing in here they can use, and he knows if he’s able to coax Tony to standing it will be a long shameful walk upstairs and Tony will disappear into their bedroom and odds of getting him out again – fed, sunshine, human interaction – are slim. “I can’t, we can’t,” Steve says. “Damn it–”
“Why don’t you fuck me,” Tony says, and they’re the wrong words, Steve hates how casually he says it. He wiggles up the bed, pulls his knees up, drags one of Steve’s pillows under his body. Waits, like he’s content to go along with whatever happens to him. “We both clearly need it,” Tony says, and something’s shifted. He throws it out like it’s nothing, like Steve could be anyone. “As long as you’re not mind-controlling me,” he says. The joke doesn’t land; it’s just them and Tony’s sniffling and the recycled air hissing on in the exposed ductwork.
“I think I should leave the team,” Tony mumbles, looking at his hands.
Steve reaches across the coffee table to grab Tony’s shaking hands in his own.
We were running away, Steve said, maybe just to get them all to shut the fuck up, and Tony should have seen it then, how he was getting tired around the eyes. We’d blown up a Hydra base. The bridge was out. There was an airstrip, there was a plane to steal. So we were clear, he said, like anyone off the street could steal a plane, and all the Avengers held their breath, because that was then and Steve could carry anyone’s attention if he wanted it. We were in the sky, he said.
A laugh bubbles out of Tony’s throat. “Are you fucking serious,” he says.
He doesn’t have a choice, in the end – the bouncer is waving someone else in behind him, and he’s trying to look up at the glowing marquee but the ladies are chittering just behind him:
A quick burn, then. The serum must have brought him out of cycle early.
“If you don’t want to be there for my appointments, it’s – whatever, Steve. Would I like you to be there? Yes. Will I live if you don’t shuffle your missions around?” He runs a hand over his face and it seems all the will rushes out of him at once.
“When things like this happen, I worry I’m dead,” Tony presses on.
, I’m gonna hurt you,” Steve says.
“Do I know you?” Steve asks, and the man bends to kiss Steve’s forehead.
There’s a big hand on his shoulder, heavy and warm, and Tony spins around and gets his hands up and he’ll shoot Steve’s ghost as many time as he has to, the RT is hot -
Always looks so sad, Gary says.
“No,” Steve says, firm, because tenderness is not the order of the day, “wait.” He wraps his entire hand around Tony’s half-hard length. It’s more of a massage than a hand job: Steve pulls down the entire length, soothes his thumb over Tony’s velvety skin, so careful to let the tips of his fingerless gloves catch just enough for Tony to feel it, Tony loves that. His eyes are closed, he's holding himself back from thrusting himself bodily at Steve. He hardens up quick, so Steve plays with his balls, hefts them in his palm, runs them around in his hand, pulls ever so gently.
Tony taps at his watch. “Jet’s on the tarmac,” he says, like there wasn’t a time they slept in the same bed. “Window closes in 30 minutes.”
Rhodey stops by and almost immediately defaults to “call Pepper.”
He thinks about the way Steve used to say
Steve grabs Tony's wrist midair, slams Tony once, twice against the wall like he's a rag doll. Something pops in Tony's shoulder. He hears his wrist snap, feels his collarbone break under Steve's open palm.
“You thrill me,” Tony deadpans.
“Tony–”
Tony turns his face away. “You shouldn’t want me, Steve,” he says. “Why are you like this?”
Steve's answers grow quieter, rarer. Like he thinks speech will break him out of his single-minded mission and he can't afford the distraction for even a second. He moves slower now. He moves like the world is an unbearable miasma through which his body must plough. His stride widens. His face remains carefully passive like he's bundling his anger and swallowing it back as soon as it bubbles up. By the end of the day he's sweating and he won't look at Tony and he sits in the chair and puts one hand over his crotch to cover up the stain where he's leaking and buries his face in the other.
Time contracts. Jen is herding him out of the room, into a hallway packed with reporters holding their phones out–
“I could fight dirtier,” Tony says, and there’s no affection in his voice. “Let you what?”
Steve is quiet for a long minute. “It’s your decision,” he says, and holds his breath.
“Don’t make me go through that again,” Steve says. “Tony, I can’t do that again. I can’t keep doing it. I can’t.” He bites it off.
Tony gently pulls his hand away. He wedges it under the pillow. He removes the temptation from Steve’s grasp.
, Tony would say, if they were back in the mansion and it were the light of day and they knew who they were, but this Tony has glazed eyes and enormous pupils and sways on his feet and traces the muscles in Steve’s neck with his fingertips.
“I can’t,” he mumbles.
Tony shovels takeout into his mouth because his alarm tells him it’s time to eat and washes it down with Seroquel.
Steve cracks his eyes open. The shield is gleaming.
“You’re broke, Tony,” Steve tells him, because he can't bear Tony's shame, too. He knows what he looks like; he knows how people see him. He leans his cane on the lip of the table. “Make it quick.”
Steve grabs Tony around the waist because he is so close and warm and tender and he is somehow, miraculously, Steve’s. Tony misinterprets; he leans in for a kiss and Steve ducks away because having Tony like this inspires something capricious and mean in him.
A SHIELD agent is shepherding him through a wall of cameras. White gloves, black suit. Her weapon is holstered. They’re leading him to an ambulance. He tastes blood in his throat. His hands are shaking. His nose feels like it’s broken. He runs his tongue over his teeth: all in place, everything intact.
Fucking knot me, Tony snaps. You can't even knot me.
,” Steve hisses, and his face is so close and Tony wants out, exit left, panic button.
and then Tony is twisting one of Steve’s nipples. It’s dirty, it makes Steve shake and gasp and his mouth opens and some of Tony’s come is spilling out of his mouth and Tony
Do you know who you are again, Tony says, through gritted teeth. His head throbs. He's badly dehydrated. He can't summon any inflection at all. He is so deeply tired of this, of this dance, of the two of them.
Tony moves incrementally closer, risks it: he doesn’t look like Tony Stark these days, not even to the people who know him. The circles under his eyes are a permanent fixture and he’s wearing the wrong colors. His beard is just the wrong side of sleazy, he’s been trying out eyeliner, he greases his hair and wears jewelry to distract from the circles under his eyes. He smokes cigars to cover the smell of alcohol that clings to his breath. His body is a little less muscular, a little softer. A little more exposed, without his armor. A little weaker, without those weekly sparring sessions with Steve.
Tony thinks he finally manages, though he taps the final L again to be sure.
Tony lets his face drift into a placid smile. “No,” he tells the psychiatrist. “There’s no one here.”
“I meant it,” Steve says. “I mean it. I love you.”
“Please do that again,” Steve says, breathless, thirsty, obsessed –
Steve grits his jaw and stares back.
“I’m worried I’m turning into something bad,” Tony tells him. “I feel like I looked into a funhouse mirror and saw my darkest self, I feel like.” He trails off, shakes his head like he can rid himself of the demons. “Jocasta says it’s replacing my heart tissue,” he says. “I don’t know how to fix it, it was
is what runs through his head.
- - -
There is something like a sob on the other end of the line.
A wet slick is blooming down the front of Steve’s uniform and his face heats at his own hypocrisy. He just had his cock in his best friend’s mouth and he liked it, he wants it again already, he wants so many things and this place is made of lies and glitter and blow, neither of them can ever have this, not really, not for real, not for permanent.
Tony lies there. His body will be jerking in his bed as Steve breaks his body, as Steve’s shield flakes his armor away like it’s nothing. Tony prefers not to fight, here – he likes to watch Steve’s face. It’s a side of him Tony didn’t get to see until the end. Like all of his restraint and all of his patience had drained out of him all at the same time. Like Tony. No, this time he’s a silent observer. Steve punctures one of his lungs and Tony smiles through the psychosomatic blood in his teeth.
Knot me, Tony says, insensate, and tries to jam his body onto Steve's. He feels himself tear. He feels like he's fucking a beta with no face and no name and nothing to hurt him. He can sense Steve is alpha, barely - the knot, the timbre of his voice that awakens absolutely nothing in him, the way he buries his face in Tony's neck every 30 seconds, just to see, just to taste.
Tony stands in front of him and nudges at Steve’s heavy cock with one bare toe.
Tony tries to scent him, more out of muscle memory than need, but Steve's face lights up like he has been living for a breakthrough like this. He traces the line of Steve's collarbone, his strong neck, his chin glistening with Tony's own slick. He presses his face in, and Steve quivers like Tony has singlehandedly injected him with enough hope to see him through whatever he sees this as.
Carol carries him down the ramp, his head tucked under her neck. She smells like a prairie. Like a fresh day.
Tony thinks he's crying. His temporomandibular joint feels like it's going to rupture. Like his teeth are going to crack. He has no idea how he's not biting Steve - maybe he is, maybe Steve doesn't care. Steve strokes his throat, drives himself in deeper, and Tony is forced to swallow and swallow and swallow. He doesn't - they've never done this, he's going to break his jaw, he's going to break his jaw and Bruce is so far away and Bruce is maybe dead and Steve is -
That feels wrong. He usually remembers everything. His memory is better than most, even for his age. The nightmares leave him with perfect clarity.
Tony pulls away, tries to wet his lips.
But it's just come and his stomach roils after he's swallowed some of it after subsisting for so long on nothing.
. Something crossed out below it. Written smaller:
Sharon is late, so the technician wheedles on, wants to talk to him about the serum, and Tony drags himself through the familiar science of it. They move on to ballistics, and three slugs are deposited into Tony’s hand; the others, unrecovered. He rolls them around in his palm and uses Extremis to quiet his tremoring, traitorous hands. Imagines melting the bullets down, reloading them, inserting the rounds into a pistol. Imagines what that would feel like, in his chest. Would he die?
I'm bondsick, but I'm not fucking stupid, Tony says. Steve is right. He feels feverish again. Steve hasn't taken his temperature in a while. His last blood sample is still running, but he'd bet money his hormones have done the opposite of stabilize.
He should be in agony, he thinks. He should be suffocating, he should be in pain, but there’s nothing below his waist, there’s just the firm weight of Steve’s body across his chest, just the wheeze of his own collapsed lungs and the blood spilling down the sides of his neck where Steve ripped Tony’s armor out of his body and the jagged piece of steel that stopped Steve’s heart and then went through Tony’s, too.
The balcony levels bracketing the cavernous main dance floor are tight and dark. They step through clusters of people – couples, more than couples – in various states of undress, in various levels of penetration. A woman, in flagrante, blows a kiss at him over her lover’s shoulder. The air is so humid with the sour bleach funk of sex that Steve feels like he’ll never be able to get it out his skin. This place lures, he thinks. It makes you certain you belong here.
He has to do better.
“You know, it’s almost like you don’t trust me, Secretary,” Tony says into the phone.
Steve hangs up the phone because he is no longer strong enough to break it in his hand and digs out his wallet. Tony gave it to him, years ago. It’s just a wallet, plain, brown, faded and scratched, but it’s made it through the end of the world and back. He rifles through it until his fingers find the hard edge of the last Avengers identicard Tony ever made him.
“What,” he says.
“When…better,” Steve is murmuring, “Armor.”
Tony looks genuinely hurt, and the petty part of Steve that’s been growing these past few months shudders with delight.
Steve moves in him, over him. Tony exists, raw, hanging. Testing the line: always empty, always less than an echo coming back.
He carries Steve’s LMD through the crowd and bears each and every one of Sam’s dirty looks. The crowd stretches on forever – a sea of black umbrellas. The rain runs off his jacket and the water crawls up his socks. Steve’s fucking statue towers before them. Extremis picks up the distant hum of the Helicarrier engines.
“I deserved to know,” Steve tells him, shaking off the last cuff from his ankle.
Steve freezes.
Tony reaches, for the first time since he laid there in that fucking bunker freezing to death. He plucks at the string. And this time, he finds absence.
“You have somewhere else to be?” Tony says, and he’s already sliding his hand over Steve’s chest, slowly but deliberately picking at the buttons to his shirt, twisting his hips so his chest is angled towards Steve and Tony’s halfway to climbing into his lap.
While he could have suppressed the smile that crept onto his face, BUCK-E didn’t see any reason to -- Tony seemed to derive enjoyment from seeing BUCK-E enjoy things. He understood that sentiment entirely.
The room was starting to really stink now that he was in his right mind. Shame and sadness and old sweat mingling into a stench that drove him to take a shower.
“Am I not allowed to create new designations for people?” Tony was forever creating new designations for people, BUCK-E did not realize he was not also allowed to do that as well.
“Miss Rushman, to what do I owe this pleasure?”
“Say hi to Pepper for me... and maybe tell her that I'm sorry.”
“Understood,” Steve paused for another minute to chew at his lip, “When I do get home, could we go on a date together? All three of us?”
I swear they will get around to the sex part of the sex bot soon.
“Who?” Steve tried to play dumb.
He would have to stretch Tony out much more than he currently was though. It was a lot to try and fit into a very small opening.
It was satisfying to watch Tony clutch at the sheets and swear up a storm as he tried to come to grips with the sudden change in position and stimulation. BUCK-E would watch Tony like this for hours if he could. If Tony would allow it, he would be content for neither of them to ever leave this room again. They would stay here happy and blissfully naked together. It was enough though, to have this moment and know that there would be more moments like it.
Tony left a line of kisses across his chest, grazing a nipple on his way up to BUCK-E’s mouth. BUCK-E was beginning to get more comfortable with kisses, but he still would rather have his hands all over Tony.
It wasn't any louder but it was definitely firmer. Jarvis disconnected the call, disregarding Steve and whatever he was shouting now. Like a puppet with its strings cut, Tony fell back onto the couch. Before he could hit the back though, he was pulled up against the warm body next to him. He tried to stop the tears that were gathering, but the harder he tried the more his eyes welled up until he was hiccoughing into BUCK-E’s shoulder.
– Philip K. Dick, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
“What if I like being careful with you, doll?”
With one hand around his cock and the other tangled in the sheets above his head, Tony looked absolutely captivating. BUCK-E changed the angle of his thrusts by 14.735 degrees to more solidly stroke over Tony’s prostate with every thrust. It took almost no time at all after that for Tony to reach his orgasm.
It was perhaps a bit early for BUCK-E to be making public appearances, but it was definitely too early for him to be away from Tony. As far as first outings went, it was at least a good one. An announcement on a new project Stark Industries was embarking on would have all eyes solely focused on Tony Stark. They would hardly notice one more person following in his wake with all the madness that surrounded him at these things.
“He's not a ghost or a spook or anything like that.”
Sorry it's been so long since I've updated. I did warn that this might happen so I claim no responsibility. pretend it's still Wednesday and I actually posted this on time.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

the videos he couldn’t stop watching -- and it was starting to make things uncomfortable for him around the Tower...
“No, B U C K dash E. He’s my newest AI,” Tony was gratified to see the look of surprise flit across Steve's face. He patted the android’s shoulder as he waited for Steve to find some words.
“There is no point, and that’s the point!”
“-which surprisingly didn’t even make the list. Clocked in at number fourteen if you can believe it.”
He could feel the rumble of approval in Tony's chest though and that was really all that mattered. The hand in his hair fell to the base of his neck, guiding him to just where Tony wanted and that felt right.
He had expected caustic words and snarling.
It was tempting to just turn the vibratior on and hold it to his cock but that wasn’t what he wanted.
"I thought I was the pack Omega. I thought everyone would be there. I wanted- I even left my door open," Steve wished a portal would open up right here so he could just jump through it and escape this conversation.
Standing at Tony's side, BUCK-E was decked out in a stormy grey suit dress, it was knee length with a pleat in the back and a delicious cinch at the waist that did things to his shoulder to hip ratio that should be illegal. A pair of heeled oxfords made the android even taller than he already was, and Tony revelled in the way he loomed over anyone who got close enough -- it was possible he was just a bit protective of Tony. That was to be expected though. Right now, Tony was the biggest part of BUCK-E’s life, and until he found more things in his life, that fact would continue to be true.
He had expected the man to be angry that he was made to wait for BUCK-E, instead of being immediately gratified.

“I know sweetheart. I’m sorry I assumed. It is classified and we should definitely not talk about it because that would also get me in trouble.”
“Now, you know where he is. Did he tell you?”
He smiled into BUCK-E's shoulder. It was such a good idea to watch the Princess Bride yesterday. Just the best idea he’s ever had really.
Steve decided suddenly that his hand wasn't going to be enough this time. He made his way to the bedroom to find the little box that had arrived in discrete packaging that he hadn’t had the nerve to actually use yet -- although he had charged and washed it just as it instructed. He’d even held it in his hand while it vibrated and he imagined what it might feel like inside of him.
Steve nodded vigorously. His legs felt like jelly and after a very frustrating completely unsatisfying heat he would very much like Tony to make it up to him.
Tony whimpered but didn't try to convince him otherwise. When he removed his fingers to add more lubricant Tony mistakenly thought BUCK-E had changed his mind without a reason.
“Good morning.”
“I think I would enjoy that.”
"Oh, I just- I thought no one wanted me," Steve might cry again. Tony was staring at him with so much affection that Steve was barely even thinking about the fact that Tony was looking up at him instead of down.
“Well it's either that or Tony grew the man in that lab of his,” The man was just shy of a mad scientist and they all knew it, given time and the right motivation he could create an army of super soldiers to take over the world.
have continued watching once he fully registered what (or rather who) the video was of. It was an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust.
“Good Morning, Sleepyhead, I was starting to wonder if you’d ever wake up,” He smiled and waited to see if he would get any reply or if it was too early for that. AIs needed to learn their replies after all. Sure, he had access to the Internet but it could take time for the bot to develop a personality.
Which was why it was such a gear shift to hear the man offer him apologies. It was unexpected and did not fit well with what he had learned of Steven Grant Rogers so far.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you all for coming. If you’re done socializing then we can get the show on the road.” It was always satisfying when a room hushed to hear Tony speak. The constant flash of cameras made it almost impossible to see, so he focused on a point in the middle of the crowd.
“WHAT!” Steve actually shot up out of his chair. It crashed somewhere behind him off screen. “Tony! What does that mean?” he asked, gripping the screen.
"We've all been trying to court you as our pack Omega. I was starting to think you didn't want to be, no matter how happy you always looked to have the attention."
“Bucky?” Steve tried very hard not to make a face at the odd name – trying to be polite no doubt, because he had no reason to suspect that BUCK-E was anything but a man sitting on their couch – but Tony could see the way his eyebrow wanted to twitch upward.
BUCK-E focused on specifically not furrowing his brow, mindful of the 37 cameras still constantly taking photos and 12 other cameras recording the entire press briefing.
With a nervous anticipation skittering across his skin like goosebumps, Steve followed the cord from its spot between his cheeks until he found the remote, his cock twitching with every inadvertent tug at his rim when he pulled at the cord. He turned it on and almost cried out at the sensation. It felt like his entire body was shaking from the vibration in that little toy, it hadn't felt so intense when he held it in his hand.
The first finger slid with minimal resistance. Tony shuddered and rocked his hips into BUCK-E’s hand. It was only a few careful thrusts of BUCK-E’s finger before Tony was begging for more, it was longer before he actually slid another finger in. He didn’t want to cause injury by stretching Tony’s muscles before they were ready.
“Yeah, okay.”
The problem was he didn't exist.
The way Tony swiveled his hips on BUCK-E’s cock had the android throwing his head back at the unexpected sensation. He had not expected the feeling of being inside Tony to be so intense, his orgasm crept up on him with an electric crackle across all of his nerves.
“Steve, I’d like to introduce you to BUCK-E,” he announced, waving a hand at him to leave no room for doubt, while also breaking their silent staring contest. He loved his husband, but Tony was pretty sure he knew who was going to win that one, and it was the guy who didn’t need to blink.
When BUCK-E looked to Tony for reassurance he nodded his approval. Natasha did good work. The fact that Steve had set this up settled that little nagging worry in Tony’s head that Steve might not actually want to try and make nice with BUCK-E like he said he would.
“Don’t do that. I’m the one who fucked up here.
Steve frowned off to one side, probably at the image of BUCK-E on his screen, “But that’s not what I asked. It's not 'would you mind having sex with me', you shouldn’t begrudgingly put up with someone you’re having sex with. You should want to have sex with them. Would you like to have sex with me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hence, admitting defeat. As much as she hated the idea of Rogers gloating because he finally knew something she didn't, Natasha had to know.
“Too late.” She would at least pause her obsession with Bucky for the next two days. After that, he was fair game.
“Come on. Up and at ‘em. I don't know about you but I could go for a cup of coffee and something greasy. I’m thinking pizza? Jarvis, could you handle that for us?” Tony was thinking it was time for a nap too, if the jittery feeling under his skin was any indication – which he knew it was. He was a connoisseur of the flavors of sleep deprivation.
“We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love.”
“Thanks for the save.” He wriggled up the couch into a more upright position that just so happened to be leaning against BUCK-E’s side. He was pulled in even closer with a hand still on his shoulder, which meant there was an arm wrapped around his chest holding him quite snugly. It was everything he had been craving – warmth and touch and that indescribable feeling of closeness.
Tony still had pushback, even now, from his board and his CFO -- no matter that SI was doing better than ever. Between the personal devices that blew Apple out of the water and then blasted it to shitty little planned-obsolescent pieces and the green energy that would change the way the world thought of power usage, the company was at the forefront of two different industries. Apparently they weren't 'where the money is', even though Stark Industries made enough to pay every single employee a living wage with full benefits and a bonus every year. There was just no pleasing the older board members though -- Obadiah led the pack of malcontents, no matter how often Tony tried to explain to his godfather that green energy was the way of the future.
“Oh. I- um. Would you like me to?”
“You just can't differentiate between a robot and the very best of humans.”
sure that he shouldn’t have watched the others. There was no excuse really, he was an adult, fully in control of himself, and he knew what he was doing was wrong. It was inexcusable.
Of course, he didn't regret creating BUCK-E but he hated when Steve looked like that.
“Put him through.” He waved his hand through the air with a sigh. He needed more coffee, and he probably (definitely) didn't need it but he wanted a slice of cold pizza – he’d already had three slices but who was counting? Jarvis probably... and judging too, if Tony knew him at all.
“I simply am who I am, nothing more nothing less.” Tony wasn't sure if BUCK-E was
Instead he lubed it up -- perhaps too well with how much of the slick was pooling in his hand -- and with a steadying breath, he pressed it against his hole. It took some convincing to make himself relax enough that he could push it past his rim. Just as he had begun to worry that he was doing it wrong, the silicon toy slipped all the way in, easy as anything.
“The question that we need to ask about the future is: can robots understand and appreciate the arts?”
As the tension bled out of him and Steve slowly calmed down, his conscience started up again with how wrong it was to use videos of Tony like that. It was objectifying and demeaning. He should be ashamed of himself -- and he was -- but not so much so that he thought he wouldn't do this again, no matter what kind of promise he made to himself.
BUCK-E admired the way Tony’s face contorted as he rode out the climax. The android didn’t think he would ever get tired of watching that. He saved the moment in his long-term cloud storage in the Starknetwork, which was filling up faster than anticipated but Tony had promised that a private remote server was close to being complete. Then he wouldn’t have to worry about which memories he saved in their entirety.
Surprise to me I guess. So I will probably not be posting consistently until I get back... Sorry.
"But I thought-" he bit his tongue, it didn't matter what he thought he was obviously wrong.
The apple was completely forgotten about as he pulled up his favorite video, well practised in pulling it up with the right keywords. It was more difficult to pull his pants down with one hand holding his phone but he couldn’t take his eyes off the screen.
She was tempted to let the silence weigh on him, but her patience was frayed -- she was well past playing the long game and there was a chance that Steve might just go right back to sleep if she waited much longer. “Barnes. Who else? I can't find a single thing on him before he started following your husband around like a lost puppy. He's like a ghost, Steve.”
Tony didn’t remember falling asleep but he was sure it was before he was laid in bed.
“You are Tony’s husband so I assume the two of you have sex, at least when considering Tony’s sex drive. You wouldn’t be as compatible if your own wasn’t similar, so I imagine you would like to have sex with him often when the opertunity presents itself. I also would like to have sex with Tony often, and it doesn’t seem fair to make him choose between the two of us.”
“So… How is BUCK-E?” Steve asked hesitantly.
“I give you my word, you are not going to hurt me. This is probably the most open I have ever been, and while I wouldn’t mind giving fisting a try, I am in no mindset for that right now. Please BUCK-E, I. Am. Ready.” Tony emphasized his words with kisses.
Someone is taking his picture, and the bulb leaves a halo in his vision.
“Oh,” Steve says, and Tony is still pressing his body against Steve’s, and Steve can see the scarring from his surgery through that big gap in his shirt if he looks hard enough –
Steve's hand trails down his back, tentative, lower, lower. He tries, gentle. Hopeful. But Tony is dry and he cries out and winces and can't even bring himself to feel strongly about it, one way or the other.
“Yeah, whatever you want,” Tony says.
“You remind me of someone,” Tony says. “You’re so tall.”
Steve thinks he’s harboring a deep secret. A dead lover, maybe. Worse: an ex-lover. Someone ready to stroll back into Tony’s life at any moment and take. Worst: someone that has hurt Tony. Steve doesn’t talk about it often but Tony knows, sees his gaze drift to the thing around his wrist: in the gym, when he’s half out of the suit, when he’s pulling his shirt off.
He doesn’t have time to react before he feels his cheekbone cracking.
Tony shakes three of them into his hand. “I should have asked Janet to come,” he says. “I should have.” He chokes the rest of it off, because there are so many useless
There isn’t long, Tony knows that. Extremis is in its own death throes, flipping wildly between the hulking Helicarrier wreckage and trying to feed him information about his spinal cord, severed in two places. There’s nothing for the enhancile to do – he lost too much of the volume of it when Steve ripped his armor off his chest with his bare hands. He’s too far afield to swing regeneration like this. He’s not going to make it.
Mystery Man shakes his head. Pulls Tony in closer, flush against his body.
Tony feels like a foregone conclusion. Like Steve keeps trying to water a husk with long-rotten roots.
Steve’s hands are shaking. “Tough,” he says.
Loosens his grip. Lets Tony drop.
, everything,
Tony would have made a good Sentinel: vigilant to a fault, unfeeling, cruel.
“You were gonna kiss me before,” Tony says. “Do you still want to?”
Tony closes his eyes and feels sticky leather wrapping around his throat.
“If it were up to me, you would never wear clothes again,” Steve confides.
Oh, god. Steve is a monster. He is seven kinds of liar and Tony will still twist himself into knots to take the blame for a stranger.
Steve desperately tries to quash the instinct to call for backup and reminds himself that he is the backup.
Reed supervises his processing and pointedly doesn’t look at Tony.
The grapevine is a priority mail envelope, because all the kids left in the fucking divorce so there’s no one except Deadpool to actually bring him gossip anymore. The envelope contains the deed to Avengers Mansion and a form letter that Tony didn’t even sign himself. Steve stands there with the paper in his hand, shaking, reading and re-reading the last line:
“Don’t swallow,” Tony pants, and his the tip of his cock is finally resting in Steve’s mouth and Steve wraps his tongue around him and shudders. Tony comes like he hasn’t had an orgasm in weeks, spurt after spurt after spurt. Steve’s mouth fills up but he doesn’t dare disobey. Some of it is leaking out the side of his mouth, it’s too much, it’s exquisite, he feels like a filthy secret and a personal slave and it’s the furthest thing from Captain America he can possibly imagine.
Tony sets his face like a stone and his eyes well up and a tear beads down his cheek.
“I’m gonna swallow,” he growls in Steve’s ear, and then he slides down the length of Steve’s body.
He wonders, for the last time, if this is one of his visions made manifest.
“Tony,” Steve says, and twines his fingers with Tony’s.
“Have you met me,” Steve snarls.
Tony’s voice trembles when he finally answers. “I’ve always wanted you, Steve.”
Don't, Tony says, after the fifth-sixth-seventh time.
“You asked me to assemble a new team,” Steve says, “And I’m working on it, Tony, ok, put it down, we don’t have to do this right now–”
Steve is watching him.
, Tony says, and it shouldn't feel so wretched, the bond is still closed, he knows it must be the Androderm and the Alpha sweat and the days of fever and hunger and despair. But Tony is small and he is human and Steve stands among gods and Tony loses to gods every time.
He doesn’t feel anything about it.
Time isn’t elastic. Tony would argue, he would have some equation up his sleeve to prove it, but Steve felt it then, and he knows it now: their window has passed. The hurts have scabbed over. They’ve scarred. You don’t open old wounds, they’re just there. They persist. You have to look at them every day and maybe if you’re lucky you forget how they happened.
“You need to sleep,” Steve says, because this is Tony’s very own personal slippery slope to hell. He kneels on the porcelain floor in front of Tony, draws Tony’s hands into his own. “Listen,” he tells Tony, and gathers Tony into him. He runs his hands up Tony’s sides. He’s sticky with sweat, dried blood, something that feels like sap. “We will fix this, but not right now.”
"Do you realize it's 3 a.m. or do you just not care? Do you hate me?" Steve had that this-had-better-be-good pissy voice going but she was too on edge to care. He had made this her problem and he could damn well deal with it. Steve was usually up half the night when he was away from his nice warm bed at home anyway. There was every chance he hadn’t even been asleep.
“No! You don't get to lecture me with one of your quasi moral speeches right now. I asked you to stay, because I needed you. I needed you! And you
“So, who is he really?” Natasha asked him in russian, which would have normally given them a modicum of privacy given the rarity of polyglots but Tony knew that wouldn’t stop BUCK-E, who didn’t bat even one Polybutylene Terephthalate eyelash at the language shift.
It was then that Tony actually registered the conversation, as he was measuring out the coffee grounds for the machine. He dumped them in and started it up as fast as he could (he had his priorities, all right?) before running back to the living room.
“Yeah, I know.”
He had been headed for the kitchen to get breakfast, but instead he caught an eyeful of Tony’s beautiful rear end as the man bent over to root through the refrigerator -- the sudden change in blood flow had nearly given him vertigo. It was all Steve could do to grab an apple -- that he didn’t want -- as an excuse for entering the kitchen, before hightailing it back to his room as quickly and normally as he could.
It was why BUCK-E had decided to wait until Tony was asleep to return Rogers’s call. Even if he did not project the sound outwardly for Tony to hear, he still did not want the man to see BUCK-E’s reactions to whatever Steve told him. He didn’t want to upset Tony further, Tony had been upset enough since BUCK-E came online.
“I know.” Was all BUCK-E said back to him. It made Tony huff out a tiny laugh.
The Army Angry
“Okay. That’s okay. How about we go to the lab and I'll grab your charger and we can lay on my bed? Is that all right?”
The Tony on his phone put up a token struggle, not really trying to escape but more like he was enjoying the feeling of being restrained. Out of nowhere Tony bucked and of course Steve knew it was because of the wireless bullet inside him but the first time he watched it he’d been confused and completely captivated. Miles of beautifully tan skin writhed on the bed, trying ineffectively to get some kind of friction when there was none to be had.
“The advance of civilization is nothing but an exercise in the limiting of privacy.”
“Just hold my thighs up and take me to bed,” He mumbled into BUCK-E’s shoulder.
“Okay.” They were quiet for a moment, besides the sounds of Tony’s quiet sniffling as he tried desperately to get a hold of himself, “How long is a little longer? I will need to charge in one hour and twenty five minutes.”
“Not yet. One more finger.”
BUCK-E nodded and followed behind him, one hand wrapped gently around Tony's fingers. He wasn't sure whether it was to soothe him or BUCK-E, maybe both. In the end it didn’t matter really, Tony laced his fingers through BUCK-E’s, he would accept the comfort offered and give his own all the same.
With just a minor detour they settled into bed. BUCK-E, with his head cradled in his charger, a faint blue glow haloed his head as his eyes fluttered shut, and Tony stretched so he was touching as much of BUCK-E’s body with as much of his own as possible. He watched the tiny eye twitches he could just make out that signified BUCK-E’s REM cycle had set in just like it should, before setting his head on BUCK-E’s chest to listen to his gentle breathing. It wasn't really ‘breathing’ per se, it was actually BUCK-E taking in cool air and forcing the heat out the same way. The more active he was, the more heat his inner mechanisms would produce, thus the heavier BUCK-E would breathe.
was the waspish thought that flitted through Tony's head. Or maybe he wouldn't but he would definitely be enjoying the lack of sleep a lot more.
“Yes. Let’s get this party started, I’m ready.” Tony was overeager, there was very little chance he was truly prepared enough.
“Just tired. And besides, what’s the point in being capable of carrying me around if you don’t do it?” he pointed out, hooking both arms around the android’s shoulders and attaching himself like an octopus.
“As you wish.”
The constant stimulation was pushing him right back to full hardness again before he even became completely flaccid. BUCK-E clutched at Tony’s hips, using his hold to grind them together more leisurely as his erection filled in. It felt as if sparks were lighting him from the inside out and he wanted to take a moment to appreciate it.
“Those who believe in telekinesis, raise my hand.”
“I would like to fuck you.”
He morosely set off for the kitchen, the shirt he'd slid on felt tacky against his damp skin but it didn't really matter because he'd never felt less sexy in his life. What was a little more gross on top of that? He was apparently so unappealing that the heat scent of Omega wasn't enough to lure anyone in. In fact someone had even gone so far as to shut the door to his apartment that he'd left open, just to make sure everyone knew he was going into heat. Steve's eyes burned with unshed tears so he picked up the pace.
