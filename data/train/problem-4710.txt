Dean catches sight of the flush on Cas’s cheeks, so to distract attention away from his boyfriend, he laughs and jumps down to hug his father, who pushes him away with irritation. He doesn’t appreciate being woken up in the middle of the night, even if it is to see Dean this happy.
“Tell me, malysh. Why were you swimming naked? Are you trying to provoke my jealousy?”
When he turns back to the beaten man, he notices that his eyes have taken on a glassy, vacant look. Castiel taps his cheek a few times to jostle him out of his haze. “Uită-te la mine!”
She receives pursed lips and rolled eyes, but they bundle Dean along with them. He uses the gurney for support as he walks, his hand clenched around Cas’s.
Jimmy sees the flicker of hope there, and he doesn’t want to fan the flames. It’s why he hasn’t brought this up before now. He’s going to have to come clean, though.
Sex and submission in one chapter??
“This is a treasure, and you haven’t experienced nearly enough of them, Cas.”
“Cas, c’mon. You don’t need to -”
Dean keeps his eyes lowered, nodding as he swallows hard around his pride.
“What if I’m crazy, Cas?”
“Of course, my prince.”
That the feeling continued throughout the entire next week indicated that it is a little more significant than he’s ready to acknowledge. His burgeoning feelings for Cas are getting harder and harder to contain. They are leaching out of the tidy little compartment he’d shoved them into and seeping into every other area of his life. He can’t go twenty minutes without something reminding him of the man he loves.
A brief shock of fear crosses his face, but Cas blinks it away and tucks his face into Dean’s neck. He kisses the ink-black hair behind his ear and whispers, “Let’s hope I’m wrong.”
When Cas is entirely sheathed in Dean’s body, they break the kiss to focus on the significant moment. They don’t speak the words, but love shines out from the depths, peeking through every crack and weakness in their outer defenses.
There is no right choice here. If he should try to keep Dean here, the rebellion will come for him. Normally, that wouldn’t be an issue as Dean should be able to leave at any moment. However, some of his abilities aren’t functioning, and he can’t take the chance that he could be stuck here. If he sends Dean away to find an alternate place to meet, Cas is concerned that he won’t be strong enough to summon a way to get back. Horrible options, both of them.
Dean coos his sympathy as he runs his nose along Cas’s jaw. “Can I do anything to help?”
“Fucking heavenly… I’m close, Dean.” The angel pants as he rolls his hips into those sinful lips. Catching Dean’s heavy-lidded gaze is enough to push him over the edge.
His eyes water at hearing the name spoken out loud. Luke’s brows jump at his reaction.
“What was that?” Dean asks without moving his lips.
Dean’s feet are weighted and aching from the shackles. The heavy chain between them is too short, forcing his strides to stay much shorter than his natural gait. He is being escorted to the crown prince for an audience, which Marius explained to Dean in French while he was helping him get dressed. Again, the iron bonds interfere with the simplest of tasks.
“You’re asking for it, pet.”
Cas lets out a rough breath. “Come up here.”
Every time Dean cracks his eyes open; he immediately wants to slip back into his hallucinogenic dreams. They might be incomprehensible nightmares courtesy of the mind-warping drugs they have him on, but they’re infinitely better than his reality.
"Cas, seriously. I'm looking for stray lightning bolts."
She turns toward the door, but then stops and adds, “Before the meeting, though, think about what you want out of this. Is this a hobby or a career? Will you be willing to sell personal pieces or only commissioned work? Will you be willing to create whatever your client wants or do you need creative control? Make sure that you know your limits.”
The creature approaches, back on two legs again but he has kept the human illusion. He’s naked, but Castiel is too infuriated to even consider that fact. He runs at the beast, who smiles at his approach, until he makes impact. With fists swinging, Castiel takes every bit of his anger out on the abomination who took him from his home.
“I’m not squishing you?”
Cas didn’t miss that they are suddenly Cas’s rooms again. Dean has stopped referring to them as theirs. Warning flags are everywhere.
“Oh, we can pause the movie so you can.”
The worst part, for Dean, is that he finally found out the purpose for the metal rings in the wall next to Castiel’s bed. Currently, his wrists and ankles are chained to the rings in the shape of an X. There is just enough play in the chains to let his arms rest, but no more.
“Can I help you? It looks like some of it is heavy.”
“Can I see?”
Dean doesn’t take a deep breath until the beast of a horse is pointed north, chewing up the miles with his massive legs. Cas’s weight against his chest is his touchstone. He can get through this day; he will be strong for Cas and take care of whatever needs to be done as long as he can reach out and know he is protected.
Cas chuckles into his pulse point. “I thought you’d be happy to have a reprieve from that.”
“Give me time, Cas? Please?”
Cas wears his punk look like armor. In this heaving mass, far away from his neighborhood, he can’t rely on his reputation to keep them out of his way. Instead, his eyeliner is his war paint. The chain around his neck shines and shimmers in the fluctuating colors, calling attention to the predator in their midst. The snarl of his lips makes him unapproachable, and when a particularly out of control man flails into him; he shoves hard with an unyielding snap of his arms. As the man goes down, a ripple effect of people finally gives Cas space, creating a wake around him.
“What’s the matter, Dean?” his mother asks distractedly while grabbing more popcorn from the bowl in between them.
“You’ll have forgotten all about me by then,” Dean says sadly, cupping his jaw and guiding him down.
The boys have to part for a while. Dean takes his situation to the police. Cas tries to find Michael.
Taking a deep breath, more to pull the freshly-showered scent of Dean into his lungs than anything else, Cas swallows roughly around his salivation and admits, “Before we leave, there is something else you need to know about your passport.”
Cas hums appreciatively as they resume the incredible rhythm. They race together towards release, even as both of them dig their heels in, trying to make it last. Just one more minute...one more thrust...one more touch...one more kiss.
“You are?”
The grin lifts into a full-fledged smile when the expanse of toned, tan skin appears under him. “Mmm. Delicious.”
Realizing that this is going to be a common occurrence from now on, Sam starts the car with a muttered, “Fuck my life.”
While the cop on his back calls in for backup, Cas braces himself for what could potentially happen when another gun enters that powder keg. If only he could warn Cole and Gabe. He’s honestly surprised that the owner didn’t call out for the police when they identified themselves. Loudly.
Dean licks his lips. “It’s been too long. I couldn’t get back.”
“You couldn’t afford me, handsome.” The sexy, lidded gaze Cas gives him revs his engine. Damn. Cas is sex incarnate, and Dean can’t get enough of him. Anytime, anywhere, all Cas has to do is show an iota of interest, and Dean is ready to oblige. Not just ready. Anxious.
Cas leans over him, making a disapproving sound. “Maybe I should cut out your tongue so you can’t speak to him again.”
“I can’t believe you bought me an engagement ring.”
Cas rubs thumbs over the sharp hipbones under their reach. “You won’t. We’ll say them before we begin any play.”
“Dean, hold onto my arms.”
His vision is useless here in the dark water, but he opens his eyes against the salt to try to see his escape. He is right. Useless. And now he is so oxygen-deprived that his brain is shutting down. Shit.
“No, but the only recourse I have is to get out of these charges.”
Cas redoubles his efforts and pulls Dean’s hips up to get the perfect angle. It catapults Dean into orgasm within seconds, his body convulsing around him. “You’re so huge, so goddamn perfect, Cas. Watch, baby.”
“Meet me at the stables?” Cas smiles in answer.
She hums her approval, and Dean is losing some of his bravery. Cas’s stares are sometimes too much to handle. Two powerful supernatural creatures eyeing him like a giant steak is making his fight or flight instinct want to take over.
Castiel shouldn’t push Dean’s bond any further, but it’s important to him that Dean understand and be able to speak to the people in this time and place. He forces knowledge of the Greek language through their fledgling connection.
Dean’s eyes drop minutely, but he stays silent.
Dean looks around and then sidles up to Cas, hooking his fingers into his belt loops. “If you had a studio here then you’d spend less time at the museum?”
The movement is using up his air quickly, but his desperation knows no bounds. He yanks his foot away, only to feel another slick, smooth tentacle trace along his wrist. Over and over, he twists, turns, and goes ass over teakettle just to keep his limbs out of the monster’s grasp.
Once he gets to Torchy’s, he finds that he’s ravenous. He hasn’t thought about food all day, not since he left his apartment this morning before his first class. Come to think of it, he barely ate yesterday, either. He finds Sam in a booth, picking petulantly at his leftover chips and salsa.
Leaning in with an amused look, John replies, “Well, no shit. Not many can, son. This is a favor.”
“Like Advent?”
Cas laughs at the crazed energy that shoots through Dean with the news.
“Oh, yes.” Darwin holds his hand out for Dean to shake. “Pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
That’s probably as good as he’s going to get.
“I've never had the opportunity to speak to one of Krushnic's lovers. They are usually being escorted out the door before the come has cooled. I’m sure we’re all curious. How is he in bed?”
Cas squints at him. “You realize that I am a prince, yes? That is my home? Those people work for me?”
*****
“Fuck,” he moans, cock still spurting come into Dean’s mouth as he watches intently. “Do it again, Dean. Please?”
“Dad, you aren’t still doing that are you?”
Cas bites his lip and narrows his eyes in concentration before taking a deep breath. “That’s really brilliant, actually.”
“I’m going to show you a different way to experience closeness and intimacy.”
This chapter fought me for days, but I finally forced it to submit.
*****
Running with your eyes on the area above you is about the dumbest thing you can do while carrying a homemade flamethrower, but Dean does it. He’ll be quadruple damned if he lets this fucker get away again.
“One.” He doesn’t get a full breath before the next blow lands, just as painful, just as perfect. His jaw clenches after the fifth smack, and sweat dots his brow by the tenth.
She looks up from the painting, her brow furrowed. “I said no such thing. I’m merely suggesting that you should paint for yourself, embrace what you are interested in creating, and your audience will find you.”
“It’s impossible that there isn’t a single clue left behind!” he bellowed this evening after the latest disappointment, hurling a crystal decanter into a wall of the Council Room. When an advisor unwisely tried to correct him, Dean had to physically restrain Cas from choking the life out of him.
“You must have forgotten because I haven’t had my mouth anywhere near a cock for almost a month.” Dean smirks up at him under cover of his lashes and licks down to the base, letting his nose bump along the shaft as he goes.
X-rays for his arm and CT scans for his head have been done; Cas’s arm has been set and put in a cast; his scalp has been stitched. Now, they wait for him to wake up. Dean has been unobstructive through most of the process. He realizes that his position at Cas’s side is tenuous at best. If he remains silent, they might not question why he is there. The only time he has voiced his opinion is when they wanted to further cut his skin to help them set the open fracture. Dean was emphatic that they not damage the artwork on his skin any more than necessary. He knows that it is something that Cas would care about.
“No, for a different reason than you're thinking.”
“Fine. Yes, so you keep saying.”
Dean seems settled by that knowledge. They head back towards Peleş, but Dean stops them when they are within sight of the castle.
Cas huffs a laugh, and continues the search.
In Russian, just in case they are overheard, Dean tells him, “I’m leaving tomorrow.”
“I know, but this kink feels a little different.”
Dean looks up at him, unamused and arctic.
“He won’t. I will make fast friends with his wife and won’t let her out of my sight.”
“Fuck the research. Fuck finding out who did this. I don’t care why they stole my life; I just want it back.  It’s not fair! I want to be the boy you fell for.”
Cas lifts his legs so that he is floating in front of Dean. The wings swish powerfully and churn up the water. “No, just pay attention to them.”
“I know. I know you did, but it was horrible to see, Cas. I still have nightmares about it.”
When they are sated, sweaty and panting; Dean’s heart aches to do it all over again. He pulls Cas tighter to him, not wanting to lose the connection they feel during these intimate moments. Closing his eyes, he catalogs every sensation. The scent of Cas’s skin, the feel of it beneath his fingertips; the growling timbre of his voice now that he’s shouted out his pleasure; the blue glow of his grace humming inside of him; the feel of his swollen lips on his skin. Dean is in love for the first time in his life.
“Here, let me help.” Dean joins him with the retrieval. When they are done, he asks, “Do you paint?”
“Please don’t freak out about this, Dean. We’re in close quarters and it was a sexually-charged situation. We both enjoyed it and that’s fine. It doesn’t have to mean anything more than that.”
“Crass, rude, disgusting, vile,” Cas offers.
Cas looks up at Dean’s flushed face and frowns. “Why is that so hard for you to ask me? Don’t you know that this master and slave farce is just that? We are accommodating a very real threat to us. That is all this is.”
“He’s been following me. He was at my office and at my home. When I was out at a club with my roommate, he drugged me.”
“Bread, pasta. Something starchy,” he mutters with his eyes closed and his head tipped against the window.
Cas can picture Dean wearing a bathrobe with a paper bag crown, his little brother looking up at him in awe. His heart aches for Dean’s loss. He wishes that he could give that innocence back to him, give him more time with Sam.
“Let’s get on with it, there are urgent tasks to complete before the ball,” Castiel affects an air of boredom to mask his discomfort. Being near Dean is making him anxious, not a familiar emotion to him. Typically, Castiel is in firm control of his mind and body. He does not second guess himself. Nothing about this situation with Dean is fitting with anything Castiel has known before. He is adrift.
Cas kisses his nose and they fade into fucked out kisses until all of their exertions and panting catch up to them. Parched mouths win out, and Dean convinces Cas to bring him a chilled water bottle. The generous man also brings back an assortment of snacks.
With a shake of his head, he sets the phone down and signals the bartender for another drink. He isn’t going to get sloppy, but being back in Pasadena is messing with his head. He swore he’d never come back here, and if it weren’t for this client that his burgeoning business needs desperately, he would have had no problem sticking to his guns.
Cas appreciates the obscene praise; it makes him work harder to get Dean over the edge before him. “Can you take it harder, Dean?”
The ease with which his vision comes to life on the canvas makes tears of joy fill his eyes. After such a violent struggle earlier, this uninterrupted flow is delicious and goes a long way to restoring his faith in his talent.
“So, what do we do?” Sam wipes a hand over his face, tired and gritty from the hunt, exhaustion pushing down on his shoulders.
He had been making plans for what he would be required to do once his sentence was up. After all, he was a new member of the Solntsevskaya Bratva whether Cas was going to take him on as his Novobranets or not. He knew that his path would be hard on his own, much harder than his time in prison, to be honest.
Dean grins without looking over at his husband. “I suppose you’re going to have to show me how it’s done, then.”
Dean blinks a few times, emotion overcoming him. He swallows it down and forces a smirk to take its place. “Well, I guess you’d better open your gift…master.”
“Cas, what’s wrong?”
Searching for the truth in his gaze, Dean replies, “Certainly you can relax and enjoy this without death being involved. There’s got to be some middle ground.”
“Ever?”
“They can see me without your touch?”
Cas shakes his head and cups Dean’s jaw in his hand. Even with his grip firm around the other man’s neck, his husband leans into the touch.
Back downstairs, they open up the topographical map that Cas purchased at the ranger station. They use Dean’s GPS to locate their exact position and then look for roadways near them that might potentially have the added culverts. They mark up the map, but once that’s done, they can’t do anything else until morning. It’s almost fully dark, and there’s no sense hunting for a clue without being able to see it.
Dean’s breath stutters out on an exhale, and he fires a little too jerkily.
Dean feels proud of being considered Cas’s equal, and then feel ridiculous for wanting the man’s approval. He’s a ruthless criminal. Thinking back to the scene at breakfast is enough of a reminder to gain some perspective. He didn't kill the man, but it was a close thing.
Cas stops him at the first knuckle. He loves the look of amazement on Dean’s face. Experiencing this through Dean’s eyes is like being a virgin all over again. It’s better even, because he has the knowledge and experience to make this so good for Dean, while watching the wonder of having it for the first time on the face of the man he loves.
*****
Hearing the deep, resonant laugh across the distance makes Dean ache to close it. What he wouldn’t give to be cozied up in bed with Cas, discussing their days. He remembers the ticklish vibrations of hearing Cas talk while his head lays on his chest.
“Well, let’s hear it.”
“Oh my god, Dean. You were a baby!”
The only hitch in the plan is his inability to put on any warmer clothes on his top half. They would have to remove the wrist bands to do that, and he hasn’t gained that trust yet. No matter, he won’t be here much longer. Everything is riding on this escape. If he doesn’t succeed, he will not get another chance until late in the spring.
Yet, despite all of that, here he is, waiting for Dean to arrive at the little cafe he likes to go to when he has time for lunch. It’s near his office building, and their tea is wonderful.
Dean could see that the words were not registering with Cas at all. “How do you not know what the internet is?”
Cas is silent for too long. Dean starts to apologize, but he’s cut off. “You don’t find me worthy of that respect?”
Dean nods as he adds, “In a very macho sport. I didn’t want to be the poster boy for being a gay athlete, which I suppose makes me a bit of a coward.”
Dean sputters in disbelief. “Met? Don’t be ridiculous, Cas. You’ve known me more than half your life.”
Dean only laughs harder. Sam blushes and tosses the nearest bottle cap at him.
Castiel tries again. “Vous parlez Français?”
Cas raises an eyebrow as if to say, ‘No shit.’
Gabe adds with a girly, breathy falsetto, “Yes, Cas! You’re so big! Do me harder!”
“I’m not going to leave you, Cas.”
“Bound to him?” Sam asks incredulously. “What the fuck, Dean? What have you gotten yourself into?”
Dean laughs. “Thank god. No offense, Cas, but your bed was quite possibly the most uncomfortable one I’ve ever slept on.”
The man tries to take Dean’s hand, and Cas is done playing games. He bats it away and then lifts the edge of his shirt to give the man a view of his gun. His eyes go wide and he takes a step back.
There is some heavy angst in this chapter. I planned the events of this chapter from the beginning, and I feel that they are necessary to get the plot and characters to the next step of their development.
Of course not, he scoffs at himself. Dean never kills unless it is absolutely necessary. In the short months that they’ve been together, Cas has learned so much about Dean that he feels absolutely certain about that judgment. Even the pelts for their blankets, including the one that Dean had made him repair as both a consequence and a teaching tool, were found objects. He only takes them from animals that have died.
“I’m going to be fingering your ass. My hands are going to be holding you open and sliding in and out of you. I’m going to be stretching you, getting that tiny hole ready to take a cock. If you’re squeamish about it, you’re going to be tense. If you’re tense, you aren’t going to relax and let me in.”
Dean is tempted to buy him an apartment in Budapest and bring him here every spring for the rest of their lives, just to see that look in his eyes again. He realizes that he is completely bent to his omega’s will, but he couldn’t care less.
Finally, he slips a finger into the loop of anal beads that they have never used together. “Hmm. I think this is the perfect toy for tonight,” Cas says as he slowly holds up the long chain of graduated silicone balls. Dean’s breath hitches and his hips shift, but he doesn’t say a word.
The words are almost familiar. Like hearing someone speak underwater. You can almost make them out if you concentrate. Dean closes his eyes and listens intently. Their voices shift in his ears. He can make out the meanings of some of them, even though he’s certain they haven’t switched to a language he speaks.
With a huff, Cas says, “I told them to go fuck themselves.”
“Why?” Dean blinks and tries to focus on him, but his eye won’t open any further.
The next chapter is plot-heavy, but more sex, too.
Mary opens the door silently, but when she sees the sweet, intimate scene unfolding inside, she backs out and tells the nurse to come back later.
Cas grins, “But this time with toys as well as my hands and mouth.”
“I want to trust you, Dean. I really do.”
Dean smirks when he sees the prince’s cool visage crack. He blinks rapidly and swallows hard, all the reaction he can allow in this room. “That won’t be necessary.”
“If I ask you to look it over for fine details, are you going to lose your shit?” she teases Cas. He has the decency to look suitably guilty.
He figures that night time is his target because there is so much less traffic in the late hours. Most of the patients are asleep, and they are running a skeleton crew. Sam brought him a duffel bag of his things, but the nurses are taking their sweet time going through it. Apparently, someone believes that shoe laces are incredibly dangerous and he can’t be trusted with them. He also can’t have Carmex lip balm because it’s addictive. Who the hell gets addicted to lip balm?
Cas’s eyes pop open wider. “Really. So this isn’t just a little hobby, then.”
“Give it a rest, Meg,” Cas grumbles.
“Come sit with me,” Cas says and takes his hand. They sit at the table, Dean still distracted by the chaos of thoughts storming through his mind. Cas rubs his hand, working out all of the stress in the muscles, which seems to work on the rest of his body at the same time. Minute by minute, Dean sags into relaxation.
You've read the tags, you know this isn't where it ends.
Dean nods in acceptance, softening instantly to Castiel. He steps closer without thought. “Sorry, I just had to be sure that you weren’t-” He drifts off, caught up in the beautiful features of his face.
As soon as Cas’s brain catches up with what is happening, adrenaline spikes through his body and a scream leaves his lips, “NO!”
Dean is in no mood to make light of the situation. Cas puts a hand on his cheek and leans in for a tender kiss. “But that isn’t what happened. I have a broken arm and a concussion, but nothing permanent. Don’t focus on what could have been. You’ll make yourself sick.”
“Castiel, my child, I’m glad that you are finally able to take this step. I trust that you are happy with my choice of par animus?” He actually winks at Cas which makes Dean’s brow furrow in confusion. That is not what he expected from God.
He rushes home, half-jogging, with the book in his backpack. He doesn’t trust himself to keep it in his hands. Even so, the music of it calls to him, begging him to open it.
“You selfish little prick!” he growls. “You can and you will accept my help because it is the only possible hope of you getting out of this without a felony conviction.”
Dean and Cas share a look over her head. Yeah, these people are worse than they had anticipated. Who threatens to kill a toddler to keep their parent in line? That’s sick.
“I’m a contractor. I do home and commercial renovations mostly.”
“I was just explaining that the sounds of our language are difficult for you.”
Cas squints at Dean, but doesn’t say anything further. He presses his palm into Dean’s, trying to make a connection with him. He gets a vague impression that Dean doesn’t trust Cas’s new friend, so when they lock their eyes on each other, he nods. They’ll talk later, of course, but Cas lets the matter drop for now. He isn’t going to push Dean into working with anyone that he isn’t comfortable with, no matter how kind the man has been to him.
“Have you ever tasted yourself, Dean?”
He’s sure that they must have worked their way through half of the South Pacific by now. They split their time on land and in the sea, so they can explore the islands while they are there. Dean calls it recuperation time, but Cas recognizes it for the bluster it is. Dean puffs up with pride and satisfaction when Cas appreciates the beauty of each new island. Once he realized how it pleased Dean, Cas has made a concerted effort to observe and praise the unique qualities of each one- the shallow lagoons, vividly blue water, sky high palm trees, and sugary sand.
Dean thinks his next statement. “I asked why we’re suddenly able to speak telepathically, but I think we just answered the question.”
On a heavy exhale, Dean admits, “You’re priceless, Angel.”
“Cas?”
“Dean is going to hate this.”
Dean can tell that Sam isn’t getting the significance, that he’s prevented him from understanding by calling it a dream to begin with. “There was a man there, the only one who noticed me or would talk to me. He spoke to me in English, and he knew my name.”
Still, he finds himself dreading the screeching sound of the brakes. Cas leans down for one last kiss, and brushes his thumb over Dean’s bottom lip. “See you around, Dean.”
What about in years to come? Will they still be as forgiving of his shortcomings? Will they expect him to change? Will they want grandchildren? Will they pressure Dean into seeking a more respectable man to spend his life with?
Dean rubs his hand over his mouth, nodding. “Yeah. There’s some air to clear.”
“Good. So, you’re going to go down that hallway behind me, pass the bathrooms and take the second door on the left. The door will be open. I’ll be there in just a minute.”
The only thing marring the experience for Dean is that he’s jealous over how easily Meg is allowed to touch Cas. Her hands drift over his skin to wipe away stray ink, to lay down dabs of Vaseline, and to brace the gun. He stamps the feeling out and shoves it into the far reaches of his mind. Whatever they have is new, fragile. He isn’t going to be clingy and demanding, no matter how much he wants to be. That’s not like him, and it definitely seems like something that would make Cas run for the hills, too. Even so, he finds himself wanting to rush forward in time to get to the point when he, too, will be trusted enough to touch Cas freely. Even with all of the time in the world, he knows that it isn’t a guarantee. Cas hasn’t explained his touch sensitivity, so Dean isn’t sure if it is something that he can get past.
His voice is rough from panting and dehydration. Exhaustion dragging down every syllable. Castiel takes a moment to look back at the captain of the guard with disdain. His eyes scream what his mouth refrains from saying. He can hear some quiet snickers from back in the ranks.
Bennie calls him about an hour before he is supposed to leave his office, concern evident in his words.
“Okay, you obviously knew something was about to happen, or you wouldn’t have sewn this book into your coat.” Dean pulls it out of his back pocket again, running his fingers over the edges.
The commanding edge to Cas’s voice does nothing to alleviate the anxiety of the moment. It isn’t until his Dom rubs carefully over all the available surface area that he lifts his hand and strikes. The sting of it makes Dean’s muscles seize up, which is the worst thing to do. If he relaxes, it will be more enjoyable.
“You’re right. I should just go out and experience the orgies and debauchery for myself instead of reading about it. Oh wait, I already have!”
There is no pretense with Dean. What you see is what you get. It’s so simple and pure, and Cas is getting caught up in his feelings for this man again. He knows that Dean senses the shift in the air, that he shares his physical interest, but he lets his gaze drop first. He clears his throat before continuing, “I’m sorry that he tried to embarrass you on top of everything else.”
“I’m not.”
“I’m not going to stop trying.” Cas assures him.
“Yes, when they told me you were gone and explained that I couldn’t talk about you.”
“Cas, god. I’m gonna-” Dean’s eyes close to focus on his release.
Dean laughs, relenting. “I can see that going terribly wrong.”
Dean smirks. “Aww. Thanks, man. It might be hard to sleep on this tile, though.”
Jody swallows harshly and words pour out of her mouth.
“Wait. Seriously?”
“Or yours. You wouldn’t write in your textbooks, high school or college. Maybe you knew it would catch your eye?”
“Are you kidding, Dean-o? I’ve been dying to get my hands on that virgin skin since we met.”
Dean’s glad he hadn’t taken a sip yet. Even without the beer, he chokes and sputters. Cas is feeling like himself again, apparently. Dean feels his heated gaze like a tangible weight.
Cas is still sprawled between his thighs, kissing and nipping his skin as he waits for Dean to be able to be present. Dean smiles down at him and cups his cheek with his fingertips. Vivid, ultramarine blue pops up to meet his gaze.
Cas is focused on capturing images for his client, just as he’s been all afternoon, but Dean enjoys this quiet time with him. They talk in between shots, and Dean has brought his sketchbook out here with them.
“Where did you get that? I didn’t see that on the line,” Benny complains. He tries to dip his fork into the delectable treat and Dean smacks the back of his hand harshly.
Sam Winchester has never seen anything more out of place than his older brother at a fraternity party. He’s leaning against the wall watching two of Sam’s fraternity brothers play pool, the same beer in his hand that has been there since Sam put it there almost an hour ago. He knows that Dean hasn’t talked to anyone beyond the nicety of telling them his name and shaking their hand, either, because he’s personally sent a few interested parties over to introduce themselves.
When Dean withdraws and sits back, he smiles. Picking up a small morsel, he slides closer. Wrapping his arm around the back of the seat and leaning over into his personal space, Cas nudges the small bite to Dean’s mouth. He doesn’t open immediately. This is a bizarre thing for Cas to ask, but he’s been raised to have manners, and so he relents. Salty, spicy, and crunchy bacon explodes on his tongue. He hums his approval, which ignites the spectacular smile on Cas’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They could restrain you if you do that. Why don’t you just eat and avoid this battle?”
As they make the final corner around Fort Independence, the view of Pleasure Bay opens before them. The protected bowl of the enclosed bay is buzzing with the multicolored sails of kiteboards. Gusty wind whips them around, letting the boarders lift off and stay suspended in the air for spectacular tricks. Dean catches the wide-eyed interest on Cas’s face, so he guides them to lean against the railing to watch. The tricks don’t always land right, and they both flinch in sympathy when one particularly daring guy bites it hard and then lays sprawled across his board to catch his breath afterwards.
Benny is nodding, letting it sink in. Dean is gaping at him. “No. You’re fucking with me, right?”
Cas nods and lets Dean lead him to the bed. Cas is naked in the space of a blink, but Dean is still clothed. Cas squints, but Dean’s clothes remain. They are both watching his body expectantly, until their eyes meet.
Blue eyes lift to his, lidded and glassy with debauchery. “Welcome home, angel.”
“I’m hardly unaffected, baby. I’m chomping at the bit to get to you.” Cas backs up his statement by pulling Dean’s hand to feel his rigid bulge. Dean licks his lips and let’s his hand transfer paint up and down the outline of his erection.
“Yeah, it is.”
Dean’s eyes cut to the stall directly across from him. Cas smiles. He knew it. “She is yours if you want her.”
Fuck, Dean has missed this man so much. He’s walking art for more reasons than the ink on his skin. He’s the epitome of fierce strength, possessive fury, and calculated brilliance. Those are the parts of Cas that everyone knows, and that Dean fell for with hardly a nudge. Dean’s always had a thing for bad asses, so it isn’t a stretch to say that Cas fit Dean’s highly specific type.
“I wanted your mouth on me. I wanted it so badly. I was ready to do anything for it.” Dean closes all gaps between them, one arm banding around his shoulders, the other combing through his hair.
Dean huffs out a little pant and squeezes his legs together to shift the ache.
“No, don’t drug me. Please. I can’t be here. I have to get to the library. I have to-” Fog fills his brains and clouds all of his senses. He tries to say more, but his tongue is thick and unresponsive. His vision tunnels and then goes black.
“You sure?”
When he guides the flared head to his hole, he pushes. Nothing happens. Cas coerces, “Harder, Dean. Take me.”
He might have been taken against his will, but he’s too tired to continue railing against the man who is taking care of him. At least for today, they have a truce. Castiel wore himself ragged trying to escape, and his eyes are heavy.
Castiel blows a frustrated puff of air and stares into the queen’s eyes. There is mischief there that annoys him. She is practically admitting that she toyed with Dean and got him to compromise himself.
Cas is utter charmed by his shy but brave admission. He ghosts his thumb along Dean’s plump bottom lip and purrs, “I’ll gladly keep you distracted, sweetheart.”
Sam has the presence of mind to look chagrined and step out of Dean’s reach. “It was the doctor’s suggestion. After talking with us, and what happened while you were on the ward, he thought that removing what is triggering your stress would be a good idea. Not permanently. Just for now.”
“Perhaps not, but in this case teaching is necessary. So either we don’t do it, or you agree to accept my instruction.”
There are enormous cushions laid in a circle all around the fire, distant enough to warm, but not overheat. The cushions are large enough to seat two large people comfortably. Above them, large vines filled with blooms the size of their heads wave in the breeze.
Matei tries to hide the snicker. “Poor baby. You had to endure sleeping late in your royal apartments.”
Finally, Cas seems like he is satisfied. “Okay, we’ll continue, but I want you in our bed, pet.”
“What was Dean doing when it happened?”
“So good,” he breathes, now pushing back with leverage into Cas’s hand. Cas keeps stroking his prostate, loving how wanton and needy Dean is becoming. His responsiveness is always appealing, but this is utterly beautiful to watch. There is no inhibition, no barrier, between Dean and his body’s responses. He is completely overcome by his desires, and Cas can’t get enough of it.
Cas waits for Dean to meet his eye. “I think I might want this too much.”
Glassy eyes shine back at him. “I won’t. Believe me, I don’t want to tear my ass hole.”
That word, repercussion, sounds an awful lot like punishment. He tries to imagine the same scenario if Cas had given him a consequence for not staying present in the moment. Okay, he can’t imagine what type of punishment could be handed out for that.
“Dovol’no!” The first word from his patient is a growling, rumbling command that makes Dean’s skin shiver into goose bumps. His eyes jump up to look at him. Thankfully, the man’s focus is on his friend; the irritated look is not for him. Dean is disgusted by that thought. Why the fuck should he care how this man looks at him? He’s an inmate, same as Dean. Flinching at that truth, Dean sets his jaw. He’s been locked up for less than two weeks and it still rankles whenever he remembers.
As is his custom, Dean tries to play it off with humor. “You should have seen the other guy.”
“But I’m really curious. You don’t have to tell me what he said, but was he at least nice to you?”
“Yes, Cas. Oh god, you’re perfect.” Dean praises Cas through panting breath while his hands roam over his thighs and the globes of his ass. Cas nudges his head to make him turn to face him. They give and take messy kisses through agonized sounds of need. Cas is holding him so tightly that Dean can tell that he’s barely hanging on.
“Let go, Dean,” Cas nudges him back, but he holds firm. Confusion in his eyes, he explains through labored breath, “Baby, I’m almost there.”
Cas grips the hem of Dean’s shirt and pushes it up his sides, delighting in the feel of his warm, smooth skin. “I can’t believe I’m allowed to touch you again. Dean…” Cas sighs into his skin, tracing his angles and curves with worshiping fingers.
Anxious to do just that, Dean brings the tip of his cock to Cas’s hole, letting it thump against the loosened muscle a few times to draw a lovely shiver out of Cas. As he thrusts slowly forward and up into Cas’s gorgeous body, Cas pushes back. The result is that Dean bottoms out quickly with a full body shiver of his own. His open mouth rests against the tendon on the side of the angel’s neck while they both catch their breath.
“Neon fucking green, Cas.”
“You have always been worthy of whatever you want, Dean. You are the only one who thinks you aren’t.”
*****
“Okay.”
“How many more are you planning to add before you go to the gallery?”
John wipes a hand over his mouth, a gesture so reminiscent of Dean that it sends a shock to his battered heart. It has been beating along at a limping pace since he last saw Dean in the courtroom weeks ago.
His hands run up Dean’s sides, feeling his skin already dewy with sweat just at the thought of getting what he wants. Holy shit. Dean’s been responsive before, but this is fucking incredible. Cas will gladly do whatever he wants to keep getting this kind of response. “How can I get you there? Tell me what to do.”
Dean shades his eyes to better look into those of his omega. “You aren’t still planning to lead me on a chase.”
“I know what the words mean...”
“Ask it.”
How about a creature fic where Dean is half octopus and there is lots of consentacles? Read
Hello everyone,
Biting his lip, unsure how much to reveal, he decides to be daring. “I know you don’t have a small cock, Dean.”
He feels simultaneous pangs of dismay and gratitude, and then guilt for being grateful Dean isn’t involved or pining for someone. He wants to tack on the word ‘else’ to that thought, but fights himself on it.
Dean’s eyes widen, mouth gapes in disbelief. He lets Dean’s misinterpretation linger for a moment, long enough to let images form in the man’s mind. When he looks like he might be salivating, Cas finally clarifies.
Dean sniffs and turns. “Why did you come in here, Cas? Don’t you know how much it hurts to see you?”
Dean chuckles and then puts a hand on his shoulder. “You’re not paranoid. If you took these crazy precautions, it’s because you felt you needed to.”
“I haven’t felt up for company,” he admits.
“I want to know you. Every part of you.”
“I really hate the idea of going into the new year with things so unresolved, don’t you? How about if I beg off the party early and we can at least spend midnight together?”
“This is much more enticing than I thought it would be, but I want to watch. Keep going, pet.”
“Shit.”
“Yeah, buddy. That would be awesome.”
“I can only hope.”
The notebook in front of him is filled with notes on the Russian Tzars, but there are still gaps that must be filled. The professor for his Dynastic Empires course requires each of them to teach a lecture series on their selected empire, and Dean’s knowledge must be close to encyclopedic if he hopes to secure a spot as his TA next semester. One particular gap that he is struggling with is understanding the political reasons for Peter the Great’s decision to change Russia from a tzardom to an empire.
“Yes, but our season does not last quite as long.”
“Thanks for bringing me out here,” Cas says sincerely when there is a lull in their conversation.
The aftermath, trying to heal, Russians invading, and someone gets justice.
As soon as the door opens, he exhales in relief. The vibrations are there. He has a way to get back; he just needs to find it. In a handful of minutes, the sound brings him to a book on the Parthenon. Dean smiles. He remembers Cas telling him about his time in Ancient Greece while they were in Rome together. Trying not to react too strangely when he picks up the book, he brings it to the librarian’s desk.
“Your hands are magic.”
The apology flows easily. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Master. I accept my punishment. I accept whatever you give me happily.”
In the space of a heartbeat, the other man’s face warps into something dangerous and violent. “You will love me. Only me.” As he speaks his impassioned words, he pounds on his own chest. “He is nothing. You will forget him.”
“Does he wield more power than Alastair?”
In the low light, it’s difficult to make out the shock of dark hair making its way towards them, but Dean is so attuned to Cas that he easily recognizes him. His lips tip up in contentment, and Benny turns to see Cas approach.
“Are you telling me that you aren’t secretly thrilled that I fucked up and I’m out of Dean’s life?”
“It wasn’t until I woke up that my brother told me he took the ring off before the ambulance arrived.”
“Dean, can I ask for one of your secrets?”
“I mentioned the other day that I’m up for most things, and I don’t have a problem telling you if I don’t like something. My only hard limits are water sports, scat play, and any kind of age or puppy play. I’m not a huge fan of humiliation, either.”
“Well, we’ll let you get back to your work, sir. I just wanted to bring that observation to your attention.”
Alexei is turning a deep, worrisome red, but he tries to speak. “I apologize, Pakhan. You were gone, and I was forbidden from speaking of your plans.”
Dean closes the space between them, adrenaline preventing him from using proper rational thought. “Obviously I haven’t made enough of a point if you’re still using that kind of language.”
Dean clears his throat roughly. “I’m-I’m not here alone.”
When Cas finally meets his eye, he asks, “Will you please give this a chance?”
His confusion and yearning are pushing for access to his mind. “I’m trying to do the smart thing. He screwed up. Why should I have to give up my dream to keep what he didn’t care enough about to protect?”
“He doesn’t know what he’s getting himself into.”
Sam has to admit, that is a pretty big hole in Jimmy’s story. Dean moves on to the next folder. “He told me that he went to UC Berkeley. Also a lie. I checked student records. He never attended the school. In fact, there hasn’t been a James or Jimmy Novak that attended the school since 1973. Considering his age, I doubt that’s the same guy.”
“See these wires? The little nibble marks? You’ve got mice.” They make significant eye contact as Dean sets the lamp down. Already, he can see the worry crease Jimmy’s brow.
“Why is the castle here and not in Bucharest?”
“Vor?”
Not only is he interested in everything about Dean, but Cas fondly remembers the very few times Dean’s smooth, slippery tentacles moved over his skin. In fact, he gets goosebumps when he thinks about them. They have featured in a multitude of his dreams, and he wants them on his body in the worst way. As the light fades outside the cave, Cas conceives of a plan to get what he wants. His eyes flash with wicked delight as he puts everything in place.
“That’s the million dollar question, isn’t it?” Dean chuckles, but there’s nothing but sadness in it. “I’m hoping that you’ll be curious enough to investigate for yourself. I’m hoping that you’ll go home and look through your things and find your important documents. I really hope that you’ll ask yourself some probing questions.”
Cas shakes his head and bestows a toothy, gummy grin on his brilliant boyfriend.
Cas takes off his shirt and lets Dean look his fill. His eyes flit from artwork to artwork, obviously overwhelmed by the embarrassment of riches. Dean licks his lips and Cas can almost feel it on his skin.
“In what universe would I not be up for you fucking me, Cas?”
When he does come, the memory of Dean’s lovely commands are what pull him under. On any other day, he would have begged for Dean to keep talking to him. Today, though, is about power dynamics, and he needs Dean to feel his submission.
Cas tries to steel his resolve, but Dean grinds back and his head pushes through the muscle. The sensation is as essential as breathing. It’s luxurious and suffocating simultaneously.
Cas guides his hands to his not quite flaccid cock. The Dom manipulates his balls out of the way, and points the head of his cock down.
Dean seems to choke on that word, his face dropping. “I don’t have two nickles to rub together and you live in a million dollar penthouse overlooking Red Square.”
When he meets Dean’s eye, his gaze is steady; sad but not pitying. “I immediately went into the system because she didn’t have family, either. I was at an orphanage for most of my childhood, and they were severely understaffed. Babies were not held unless they cried, and apparently, I hardly ever cried.”
Despite his talk about sleeping on the plane, Cas had a plenitude of work for him to do on the long trip. The Solntsevskaya Bratva, the largest in Russia, has a typical structure. The Pakhan is the head of the group, the Sovietnik runs all support systems for the group, the Obshchak is the head of security, and the Avtoritet, which is Cas’s position, is the counsel, advisor, and keeper of the law. The four of them act as the executive branch, for lack of a better term.
Dean narrows his gaze on Cas, and if his eyes drift to his lips more than once, he’s only human.
Dean waits for the blush to fade from his cheeks before he continues. “Besides, all of that shit is our past. It’s where we came from, but not who we are or what we’re going to be. I like who you are, and I’m enjoying the hell out of being with you.”
Castiel glares across the fire at his captor. Throughout the past several days, the creature has offered him water from a beautifully carved cup, plates of fragrantly spiced cooked fish, and even fresh fruit. Every time, without fail, Castiel ignores him and turns his head away. Every time, it is left there for him.
Dean rushes to comply. He is so excited, so filled with anticipation, that the cold doesn’t even register. When he is completely bare, Cas directs him further. “Roll up that fur and lie down with your shoulders propped on it. I need you elevated a little.”
He had woken up this morning, dreamless and confused. In the light of day, he’s thinking more clearly. He’s sure that he had exaggerated his experiences with the book, but still feels the need to investigate it thoroughly. Just in case.
For the first two hours of their trip, he teaches Cas the basics of sailing while he actively sails the boat. They head directly north away from Nantucket, weaving through a smattering of islands expertly. On the couple of occasions when Cas missed the mark by letting out too much rope or not reeling it in fast enough, Dean jumped to correct the problem, never once letting on that he was anything other than happy with Cas’s progress.
The SAM Project has been officially open for a few months, and the building is filled with the effervescent chaotic energy that so many children bring to any confined space. Cas can hear the peals of laughter through the open windows in his studio. He’s struggling with getting a particular texture onto his most recent canvas, and the sounds pull him out of his focused concentration. Before he had met some of the kids that Dean works with, he might have been annoyed at the interruption. Now, it feels like he’s being called to play hooky from school. Quickly cleaning the paint from his brushes, he hops down the staircase and heads toward the main lounge where Dean is most likely to either be or have been recently.
“That is an excellent question, Dean.”
“I’m so sorry, Dean. There was confusion about the address and the truck went to the wrong location.”
Hearing the siren song begging him to open the book is torture, but he has to wait to be cleared first. He has to eat, see his doctor, and then convince everyone that he feels awful and just wants to sleep. But, the book.
Dean rolls his eyes and sits back. “Do you know how to be anything else?”
Dean is so far out of his depth that he can’t help the blush that fills his face and neck. The golden collar around his neck reminding him of his place, the orgiastic soundtrack filling the silence boldly, and now the first outward signs from Cas that he might be interested in pursuing something between them; it’s all too much. So rather than flirt back, Dean rolls his eyes at the wolfish look and proclaims, “My eyes are up here, asshole.”
He takes pity on the prince. “It just means that I find it ironic that you chastise me for sleeping in when you have hardly ever been out of this bed before noon.”
Finally, heavy footfalls pound in the distance. The Wendigo is heading directly for him, and Dean allows himself a smirk while he crouches low. That’s right, big boy. Feel that false security. It will make your death all the sweeter if you underestimate me.
“Can I do it now?” Cas asks.
Quick, perfunctory prep is all he has patience for right now. He dips his middle finger in past Dean’s rim, pushing and pulling on the edges. Sinking in all the way to his palm, he thrusts once, twice, three times and then pulls out. Dean’s gorgeous, greedy ass tries to hold him there, but he only returns for the briefest of moments with two fingers, scissoring them open to stretch him as much as possible. Cas loves the look of him spread open and waiting. He can’t wait to see what this little pink hole looks like when he’s done with it. Spitting into his hand for lube, Cas is at the end of his restraint.
“Heading to a street hockey game. It’s why I’m down here today.”
“Well, you’re about to get your wish, baby. You’ve got your beast.”
“Like what?”
“Why would he make that choice?”
Cas sits down next to him, but focuses on the wall across from them. “It’s official. Mikhail gave his orders.”
Cas kisses her head and meets his eye. “I want to adopt her.”
The look in Cas’s eyes has Dean sucking in a surprised breath. Oh god, Cas. Dean takes the sketchbook out of his clenched hands and sets it aside gently. His body replaces the book in Cas’s lap, sinking down to connect head to head, chest to chest, cock to cock. “That’s it, isn’t it? You don’t think you deserve to have this?” His words are spoken quietly, as if they can be less intrusive, less raw if they are subdued.
When Dean trusts himself to touch, his hands lovingly stroke the globes of his ass. “I can’t believe how beautiful you are, Cas. I’m speechless.”
He can tell that Cas is stroking himself while Dean settles into a sated afterglow. “Come in my mouth,” Dean begs when his strokes start to stutter. Cas moves into position, looking down at his beautiful lyubimyy. He opens his mouth, tongue ready to accept his offering. The sight, once again, is enough to tip him over, and he stripes the lovely pink tongue with ribbons of white. Dean smiles around the mess, eyebrow quirked in invitation.
“Well, I, for one, am seriously considering it while I choke the life out of you.”
Cas scowls. He needs to be more observant. He hasn’t noticed that vile man lurking about. “I spoke to Alex about him before they went back to the city. He promised me that if Alastair made another wrong move, he would get rid of him.”
“What do you mean?”
Dean’s back bows as Cas takes him ruthlessly. His eyes roll back in bliss. Words are completely beyond him.
Castiel glares, fists clenching at his side, but he keeps silent.
Cas hums, sending vibrations up his body as one hand drops to cradle his scrotum and put pressure up on his perineum. Dean chokes out another lewd sound. Cas takes the not so subtle hint and continues rubbing the spot firmly, even as he pulls off to ask, “You don’t happen to have a condom with you, like a good boy scout?”
“Because I don’t trust the enemy,” Sam snaps back.
Standing toe to toe, Dean breathes, “Yeah. You’ve got it.”
Something in that look is begging Dean to need his help. It’s hypnotic, and Dean can almost feel tightness on his wrists, restraining them. Dean is far gone in the haze of need, but he apparently possesses a tiny modicum of self-preservation. He shakes his head. “I’m good. I’ll be good.”
“It’s all about me trusting you to give me what I need, and you wanting to take care of me.”
Overcome with emotion, Dean swallows hard and looks away.
Dean particularly likes the way some words sound, and he walks around the cave repeating them. He has been saying the word “fish” for the last several minutes, but instead of finding it annoying, Cas finds it incredibly cute.
*****
“Yes, that is part of it, too. A good dominant finds what makes their submissive happy, and then they reward them with it often.”
“These are all fascinating ideas, but I don’t -”
Dean smiles up at her while Cas runs his fingers through his hair. It might be demeaning, being petted like a dog, but Dean can’t help how much he loves it. He wishes that the act was more accepted in their culture. It feels divine.
“I couldn’t just leave you to a public defender, especially when the outcome is so important.”
“Are you seeing someone?” Dean asks, and Cas wants so desperately to hear interest in his voice, that when he does hear it, he doesn’t trust himself.
With a quirk of a smile, Cas pops him firmly on the ass cheek. “Get up. Now. We can’t miss this flight and risk the police coming to look for the escaped convict.”
Dean clears his throat and nods in understanding. "I lost. What do you want?”
“So, we meditate together?”
“Cas, if you hadn’t blocked that hit with your arm, you could have died.”
Castiel’s rage bubbles up now. “I gave my word!”
Dean feels like he has been dropped into another country. They may be within the borders of the United States, but at this table, and within a twenty foot radius of Dmitri Castiel Krushnic, it might as well be Mother Russia.
Dean’s eyes are cartoon-wide, “Wait. Seriously?”
Cas lifts his chin and barely touches their lips together. “I will never ask you to do something you don't want to do or aren't ready for. Sex is about pleasure, and if you are feeling anything else, we will stop."
“Oh, shit. I hadn’t thought about that.”
“Well, he’s been there for almost a day, so-”
Cas fiddles with the little sugar caddy on the table, uncomfortable with this kind of open affection and kindness. Finally, he looks up to meet Dean’s eye. “I like you, too. I didn’t want to, you know. I kept trying to make you fit into some ridiculous stereotype, but you don’t. Honestly, you’re not like anyone I’ve ever met.”
“I said stop!”
Dean nods loosely, but Cas demands words. “Yes, of course. What do you want, Cas?”
Cas suspects that it has more to do with his role as Dean’s father than as his lawyer. What he isn’t sure about is if he’s keeping an eye on him for Dean, or attempting to keep him out of trouble. He suspects it’s a little bit of both. Regardless, he doesn’t need to camp out in his office every day.
“This doesn’t bother you?”
Cas isn’t ready to be distracted. He’s tense, headphones blaring loud music, and still wearing his shirt and pants from the night before.
He halts her with an outstretched hand. “You’ve been honest. I can take the criticism.” He turns and leaves, his fists shoved deep in his pockets.
“Yeah, back in high school. Well, when he graduated.”
“Please, Stăpân?” he whines.
Alexander rolls his eyes. “Do you believe him?”
When they camp for the night, they share a small tent set as far away from the other guards as they can and still maintain a safe perimeter. Dean can only imagine how weird it is for them to be camping out with two men in a committed relationship. Last year, he would have been mortified.
“No, we’re fine here, Cas. No one is paying any attention to us.”
“You. You happened.”
“Would you like to play?”
“A good one?”
Dean grins widely until Cas fusses at him not to crack the paint. When the images load to his laptop, he calls Dean over to look.
Setting the platter of fish on the table along with some bowls, Dean digs in and apparently tells his friend to do the same. Cas doesn’t move. He hasn’t been found out yet, but feels that his proximity to Dean is mostly the reason.
Cas grins. “No, but I did go to Catholic school.”
As Cas runs a hand through Dean’s hair, he explains, “No, Dean’s getting on his knees for an entirely different reason.” There’s enough innuendo in the statement to make Benny splutter and blush. Dean knocks his hand away and sits back in his chair muttering about Cas being a spoilsport.
“And what would the wrong idea be?”
He tries to hold back his sob of relief, but he’s not strong enough. “Cas,” he whimpers.
“I told you about Cas before.”
“Come on, Cas. Daylight is wasting.”
Dean meets his eye then, defiance and censure in them. “Then why aren’t you concerned about slavery here?”
“Is it legal for men to be together here? It isn’t in England.”
Spurts of milky liquid shoot from the rigid, rosy cock. Cas’s mouth salivates as he watches. Slowing the pace, he focuses on the strong contractions milking him from within. Before the pulsing stops, Cas tips over the edge and fills Dean's inner channel with his own come. Collapsing onto his forearms, Cas licks up the underside of Dean’s spent cock and sucks on the head. Dean huffs out a curse as over-sensitivity sets in.
“Yeah, I’m feeling all kinds of gratitude.” he bites back.
When he shifts to re-distribute Cas’s weight, he must jostle him too hard, because Cas sits up, wide-eyed.
A tear falls from Dean’s eye and he stares at the floor. He recognizes that he is being selfish. He doesn’t need an elder to point it out. If he is in any way responsible for Cas’s hurt, he will do what he can to fix it.
“So, my lovely pet. Which shade shall we go for? Vermilion, Red lake, Rose Madder, Crimson, Magenta?”
“The Unseelie will attend the auction as well, and if one of them takes an interest, you will be living out an excruciating and very short existence.”
“Fuck you, golden boy. It’s not like you ever would have stayed with me once you got tired of slumming.”
Dean’s eyes go wide with glee. “What? Really?!”
Cas sighs and does as he’s told. He really doesn’t want the cop to be surprised at finding a gun tucked into the back of his jeans. Further into the building, he hears scuffling and muffled curses. The cop looks interested in the sounds until Cas takes his mind off of them.
Facing the trial alone was never something that he contemplated. He’d always figured that he and Cas would walk into the court room side by side, a unified front against the monster that wanted to kill him. Cas had been his support through the entire ordeal, had been the one to save him. Dean wasn’t sure that he could face his nightmare without him.
Cas tilts his head in a desperate attempt to understand. Fertilized? Dean is a man. There is nothing to fertilize.
Cas looks up, caution in his tone, “I didn’t know I was allowed to have your mouth.”
Cas nods in understanding before he throws his head back and comes, screaming Dean’s name. Just as his cock kicks out the first spurt of come, Dean lifts him easily and swallows him down. Moving from the chilly salt water to the molten heat of Dean’s mouth adds another layer to the sensory overload. Cas feels his eyes cross as he huffs out a whine. He looks down his body to watch Dean suck and lick him clean while his adventurous sex organ slithers along his cock, reveling in the creamy come.
Cas helps him navigate to the property, and it’s just as cool as they thought it would be.  When they park, they take a minute to soak it in. “Cas, this is fulfilling some of my favorite childhood dreams. Living on a train? Young Dean would be so impressed.”
Dean decided on having two places rented; one in his real name, and one using his new identity. He still knows enough people with their toes dipping into criminal activity that with the right amount of money, he was able to get new passports, ids, and prepaid credit cards for both he and Cas. Fedex overnight took care of getting the package to him even halfway across the world.
Cas smiles a beatific smile at Dean’s slack-jawed reaction. He’s touching the lines of Cas’s newest, and most important, tattoo like they are made of the finest gold. To Cas, they might as well be. Of all the art that he could have put over his heart, he’d chosen the most precious of them all - Dean.
Faintly, almost as if it wanted to remain hidden, he hears the hum. Dean’s eyes dart around the area, even as he strains to hear where it is coming from. Leaping to action, he scours every shelf seeking out that beautiful noise. The empty well of hope fills with a deluge. An excited smile twitches as the sound gets louder. There. He pinpoints the shelf, and now, he can see the glittering gold. He huffs out a laugh. He isn’t crazy. He hadn’t been dreaming.
Movement in front of him drags him out of his head. He is supposed to be at St. Augustine’s in twenty minutes, but he had to stop and pick up an energy drink. Normally, he doesn’t drink them because they are terrible for growing and developing kids, and he wants to be a good role model. Today, though, he needs something to get him through the game.
Dean scoffs around his coffee mug. “I doubt that’s true.”
Every sense memory of the beautiful man is suddenly haunting him: the rough grind of his well-deep voice, the heat that radiates from his body, the silk of his midnight hair, the dark rings of blue that outline his lighter irises. Dean licks his lips, chasing the taste of him that is still on his skin. He’s even remembering his delicious masculine scent of wood smoke and honey.
Cas turns on his heels and walks back toward their horses.
Dean looks up then, the pitiful glimmer of hope he allows is enough to squeeze Castiel’s cynical heart. “I stumbled upon Alastair and three other men torturing a black man named Reggie in the showers today. They didn’t care for my interference.”
“I cannot offer you the protection of my organization,” Castiel states plainly.
“You’re ridiculous.” Cas huffs while trying not to smile.
“Dean?” His surprise is genuine, but Alex ignores it and snorts in derision. He shares a look with Alastair, the vile captain of the garrison who looks much too pleased, jubilant even. “Yes,” he hisses. “Your lover, Dean Winchester.”
. There’s no way Cas missed Elizabethan England, right? He had to have been there.
“Can you take a little more?”
“It isn’t bad at all. I’ve nicked myself worse with a razor.”
Cas was livid. “Then you’re a fucking idiot.”
Cas has to bite his lip to prevent himself from offering his apartment. It’s not the time or the place to offer to move him in. Dean is looking for a temporary home, a safe haven, a solution to his problem. He is not looking for a romantic entanglement, even if they’ve just spent all weekend playing house together. Although, it is so easy to picture waking up next to Dean for the foreseeable future. He’s terrified by how fast he’s falling.

“Well, yes. In a manner of speaking, he is literal destiny; all of my Goraal are.”
“Sam, now isn’t really a good time. Could I take a rain check?”
It takes him much longer than it should to suss out Castiel’s room. Once he’s managed to get on the right hall of the correct level, he’s forced to wade through two more checkpoints. Most of Krushnic’s soldiers get by on feigned ignorance. They give their stone-faced glares and repeat the phrase, “Ya ne govoryu po angliyski” so many times that even Dean has memorized it. He’ll be damned if he believes that none of these men speaks English. Mrs. Morozov taught him a few key words in Russian when he went back to thank her tonight, and he is grateful for the lesson. He asks to speak with Mr. Krushnic, and adds a pleading, “Pozhaluysta?”. Apparently, adding please works on even hardened criminals.
“Are you still okay with me fucking you?”
Now that the prisoner has his feet, he is indomitable. He is breathtaking in his ferocity. When he lifts his head, a pained gasp leaves Castiel’s mouth. His face has been beaten so brutally that there is hardly any recognizable shape to it. One eye is completely sealed shut, nose swollen and twisted in a fracture. Castiel’s heart aches for this man.
Dean swallows and looks away. “Again, Cas. It’s not my money.”
In a last effort to make a positive end to this shit conversation, he adds, “Since I won’t see you, have a Happy New Year, Dean.”
Castiel uses his knight to draw Luke to advance his king. He furrows his brow as Luke’s words register. “Did you think I would be upset?”
“Castiel, Alexander does not speak French, and she does not speak Romanian. You knew the woman was visiting this morning. He is beside himself trying to communicate with her.”
Dean knee walks on the bed and leans down for a kiss. “I’m in love with you, Cas. You are my everything.”
“Does that mean that I don’t have to leave you anymore?” Dean tries not to put too much hope into the question.
“I came out to them. They didn’t approve.” He shrugs like it is the simplest thing in the world, and maybe there is some artifice there, but he still holds his head high.
Cas does not roll his eyes, but it is a near thing. "No, Dean. It is nothing degrading, I assure you."
Cas can’t take his work with him to Nantucket, but he refuses to miss seeing Dean race, so he’s frantically trying to complete a commission ahead of time rather than risk being late on delivery. There are few things that irritate him as much as another person not following through and pulling their weight, so he will not do it to a client.
Cas shakes his head and explains, “Dean is my One. I chose him and he chose me. We are a family now.”
Pouting just a little, he lets Cas undress him and he returns the favor. His fingers can’t stay away from the tattoos decorating the Russian’s body. His greedy eyes can’t get enough, either. He kisses and licks one of the ornate stars just under his collarbones. “Bart has these, too. What do they mean?”
They are speaking their own language, so Cas can’t understand anything but the furious tone. He has never seen Dean like this before. His skin is pulsing in a pattern of glowing white and deepest red stripes, like lightning mixing with the night sky. He is in his other form, his arms waving menacingly at Bart. The moving pattern of his skin is mesmerizing, and it certainly seems to be putting the other man under its spell. Bart is hardly moving as this enormous threat approaches with murderous intent.
“Of course, sweetheart. What sounds good?”
“Do I have a fake name, too?” Dean teases on his way to invade the other man’s personal space. Now that they are finally alone, Dean needs to have Cas under his hands. He wants to kiss every blessedly warm inch of skin. He won’t be satisfied until he can convince himself that Cas isn’t a mirage, that he won’t disappear again without warning.
He hears gruff but boisterous praise coming from the front when he returns. Apparently, Doug is a very satisfied customer. He is showing off all of the details of the quick sketch Cas has done for him, exuberant hands flailing about in his excitement. Cas is standing back, quietly and uncomfortably dealing with the appreciation.
Cas’s voice breaks with emotion, and Dean pulls him in for a tight embrace. “Yes, Cas. I’m sure. I have no doubt at all that you are exactly what I want. I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to tell you.”
“Then, what are you hiding from him, other than your recent lobotomy?"
Cas doesn’t dare move. Not yet. Not before he gets on top of the incredible pressure around his cock. When Dean finally urges him to move, the slide against the velvety walls and Dean’s cock proves to be so intense that his eyes water.
The sweetest smile he’s ever seen on her heralds her blessing. “You deserve to be this happy, Cas. I hope you and Dean are it for each other.”
“I just expected to run across Luke’s camp by now.”
He hears the gasps of surprise from the high court and a singular, feminine laugh filled with power.
Dean shakes his head minutely. Even Cas’s rhetorical questions deserve answers. “Every fucking day. Several times a day. I’ve dreamed of you. I can’t get your taste out of my head, sweetheart, and I am practically foaming at the mouth to get more of it.”
“I thought so, too, which is why I called each department personally and asked them to double-check their hard copies. When nothing turned up there, I asked them if they had ever sustained water or fire damage that could account for missing records. They all denied any such damage.”
Dean rubs the spot at the back of his head where he feels the weird tether. “Yeah, like this mental connection. It appeared right after we met and it grows each time I see you. I feel emotions from it, mostly urging me to get back to you.”
He wanted to try being submissive for Cas. No. Sir. He can’t think of him as Cas or he’ll make the mistake again. He willingly offered himself to please...Sir. Within the very first hour, he’d broken the only rule he’d been given. He is disappointed with himself, but he resolves to do better. He will be diligent and focused so that Sir is pleased.
“He should have thought of that before committing espionage against his allies.”
“She hasn’t been named yet. We have only had her a short time and she didn’t belong to anyone. What would you like to name her?”
Instead of waiting for the bus to go to Dean’s apartment, Cas decides that he wants to lick his wounds in his own space. Before he descends into the subway station and loses his signal, he sends out a quick text to let him know.  Not waiting for a response feels like a chicken shit thing to do, but he can’t be bothered to care right now.
“We moved to Kansas, but I came back here for college. I went to BU. What about you?”
She has told him repeatedly that he has a unique perspective, that no one else has lived his life, and that he needs to focus on what story he wants to tell with his painting. The problem is that he honestly has no idea.
Dean feeds him directions by hand gesture, tapping him and pointing out his turns. Cas loves the warmth of him curved tightly around his back. Dean fits around him like a coat tailored for his unique shape.
“It’s far from done. I don’t know why he’s so deliriously happy with a rough outline.”
“As you so courteously reminded me, my eyes are up here, Dean.”
Castiel points at his own chest and says, “I am Castiel.”
There is no getting around it. Confession time. Castiel clears his throat and apologizes, “I’m sorry that I didn’t-”
“Why were you there so long?”
“S-’s okay. I can’t wait. Need you, Cas.”
“Spit it out, Cas.”
“I apologize,” Dean speaks quietly. “I came here accidentally. I will be gone as soon as I can.”
“Yet you date men.”
Dean steps up in front of him, boxing him in, kissing the frown from his lips. “Because he can see what it will be. You are a genius, you know that, right?”
“Okay, I think that’s a good idea, actually.” Cas is proud of Dean for being proactive about this, since forward thinking tends to run counter to his MO. Well, they should have talked before they had sex of any kind, but their first time together wasn’t exactly conventional.
A brief but steamy interlude between Cas and Dean.
“Wow, it is an honor to meet such a distinguished barrister,” Mr. Kelly gushes, fanboying with glee.
“Oh, sweetheart. You aren’t crazy.” Cas puts his hand over Dean’s heart. “This is real.”
“Yes, probably. You’re quite blocked.”
“Fuck me, Alpha,” Cas murmurs as he grinds himself against Dean. It feels so good that Dean doesn’t immediately recognize when it is gone.
Oh, that he can definitely do. This particular fetish doesn’t often rear its ugly head, but watching the delight on Cas’s face as he tried so many unique and delicious flavor combinations dragged it out from the depths of his subconscious and shoved it under a spotlight.
“It was really stupid to put yourself in my hands right now, sweetheart.” Cas gives him a brutal kiss, teeth nipping and biting, tongue plundering. “But I’m really glad you did.”
“Look again,” Cas beckons, pointing him towards the room again, and then back at the mirror. Suddenly, it becomes clear. The mirror isn’t a mirror. It’s a painting of the room, meant to reflect like a mirror.
Cas is quietly listening, nibbling on his pizza, which is also a unique turn of events. Sam had always thought that angels couldn’t eat, but it appears that it is a choice. As the stories about the Fae realm continue, Sam notices the space between Dean and Cas disappearing. They end up shoulder to shoulder, tucked together as if receiving comfort from each other. The closeness seems to loosen something in Cas. He adds in his own commentary about their experiences, which is unexpectedly full of dry wit.
Nope. They slam closed again. Seeing Dean in pain and sick is going to wilt his hard work. Back to fantasy land he goes. In his imagination, which he has never felt was very robust, he creates a dozen new scenarios of having Dean. Above him, riding him with wild intensity; below him, kissing him sweetly; writhing against each other with great satisfaction. It doesn’t matter the circumstance; all that matters is Dean.
“Open your mouth,” he commands just as the first drop glistens at the tip. Dean opens wide, keeping his eyes on Cas’s face as he waits. Cas yells out his release and Dean braces for the warm, bitter come.
Dean quirks a smile. “He’s the gift that keeps on giving, ain’t he?”
“What?!”
Cas lets out a whimper of pain at his words. His breath hitches as he openly weeps. He shakes his head, trying to push the vile thoughts away. “I have never regretted anything more, Dean. You have to know I didn’t want this. I never wanted this.”
“We’re in the middle of a goddamn war, Luke. Surely you’ve noticed?” he interrupts.
“Can I carry you?”
Dean shakes off the heavy moment and asks, “Will they do that? I’m not cuffed.”
“Of course. We’ll design it, and then maybe we can find someone who’s good enough to do the ink.”
“My friend, Meg, inks them, but they’re all my designs. I’m actually going in for her to start a new one in the morning.”
Hello, my lovely readers!
The lovely woman’s eyes go wide in surprise. “Another Krushnic? Are you related, dear?”
However, he is filled with restless energy; the urge to find Castiel is a compulsion. From bow to stern, he looks for the wild shock of dark hair. It isn’t until he passes one of the officer’s quarters that he hears his voice. For the first time since he was pulled away from Moscow, his mind settles completely.
If Cas hadn’t also learned that Benny was whole-heartedly heterosexual, he might have become jealous of their closeness. Instead, he can appreciate Benny for being such a loyal friend to Dean during the hardest period of his life.
“No, Cas. I love that you want to treat me well, I just don’t like it to be scripted. If you feel like massaging my lower back when you’ve fucked me hard, that’s awesome and appreciated. If you want to soak in the tub with me and talk, I’m all for it. But I don’t ever want you to do it because it’s on some agenda or checklist.”
“Cas?”
Dean shakes his head, “No, take me out here. Please.”
“Everything okay, love?” Cas loops his arms around Dean’s neck and idly plays with the fuzzy, short hair at his nape.
“You’re so much more than that.”
Dean tentatively rolls his hips up when Cas takes him in again. The feeling is utter bliss. “God damn, Cas. This is-”
Dean leans back away from him to see his face, which is as far away as he is allowed to move. He needs to see if there is any sign of deception in his eyes when he answers. Not that he knows what that would look like. He knows nothing about Cas. He still needs to see it.
“Oh, yeah? You enjoy them, do you?” Dean teases.
Dean smiles then and walks towards him. “I know you’re not angry with me.”
Those golden and earthy green eyes widen. Clearing his throat, Dean stammers, “What - what’cha doing, Cas?”
“Can I help you?”
“Are-are you sure?”
“You are here to keep mankind on the right track ideologically, correct?”
Dean glares and responds quietly enough to seem silent in the room. “Cas- The prince didn’t wake me. I didn’t know there was a change in the schedule.”
John ruffles his hair and pulls him in to a one-armed hug, pats his back in a manly way and puts some distance between them.
With nothing to do but wait, he’s been picking at the problem Cas is in. He isn’t sure how or what he’s done, but someone is upset enough to chase one man all over Europe. That’s not a small thing. That’s not an easily resolved issue. Whoever they are, they have Cas terrified of them, and that won’t stand.
“Your brother is on his way. Let’s sit down on the curb so we don’t get run over.”
“What do you mean?”
“Come in, Dean.” His voice is quieter, but carries no less authority for it. The men part around him, letting him make the journey alone. Twenty feet have never seemed so long. He stops a few feet inside the cell, hesitant to do anything to offend Castiel. He’s lounging in bed, book in hand, and still looks like the commander of the universe. Dean was stupid to have ever questioned this man’s power.
Dean is more impressed by the grounds than all of the rest combined. The manicured gardens spread out over at least an acre of the most valuable real estate in all of Russia. The night has a bite of coming winter to it, but they are still expecting moderate temperatures for a few more days.
“Am I that obvious?” Dean looks over at his mom, enjoying the delight on her face.
The restaurant is adjacent to the rooftop bar, so they don’t have far to go when it’s time for their reservation. Dean leads the way behind the hostess, leaving Cas to get a good look around. Minimalist, clean design leaves the gorgeous view as the showpiece of a large, open room lit by strategic lighting. Wrought iron, bare wood, clear glass, and succulent green make up the entire aesthetic.
“He’s going to call when he gets done with this meeting. Whatever they decide will determine where he’s staying, so we aren’t sure.”
“My way involves you receiving a shit ton of special treatment. Are you still amenable?” Cas knows he’s treading into asshole territory, but he’s greatly annoyed that Dean has backed him into this particular corner. He should wash his hands of Dean, let the man do this the hard way. He should let him suffer if he won’t listen to reason.
“Should I try to find a cushion for your tender ass?”
Understanding and excitement dawn on the man’s face. He’s getting it.
*****
“Yes, you do. Stop interrupting. I’m professing my love to you.”
Cas lifts one brow, question and command rolled into one gesture. The flush of Dean’s face and neck are adorable.
When it comes off his finger, Dean sees that the indentation is deep, the strip of skin ghostly pale compared to his tan fingers. Is Cas really going to give him his ring? He’s nervous, excited, and confused all in one fell swoop.
“What do you like about it? Explain it to me.”
“Dean, I’m 30.”
“And that bothers you?”
Cas pulls him down for a brutal kiss and then tips their heads together. “Don’t decide yet. Give it some time. Really think about this. This bond is forever, not until death do us part. Do you understand?”
“Look who’s talking.”
Cas swallows, pain etched in his features. His mouth is slack, words temporarily abandoning him.
“Worse?” Dean stands up and faces Cas. “I don’t know whether or not to be offended.”
*****
Sly mischief meets him in response. Cas takes his hand and grins wide. “We’re a little overdressed for where we’re going, but I suppose it makes sense.”
It makes sense to Dean. After meeting Cas’s asshole brother and seeing the bruises he left when Cas defied the man, he is certain that keeping secrets would be a necessary part of Cas’s life. His reasons are a great deal more important than Dean’s hurt feelings, his pride. There’s more to the question of why, though. A personal reason. He rolls up the sleeves of his shirt and kneels by the tub, leaning over the edge.
In the aftermath of the party, Cas deals with a heavy dose of reality. His plans for seduction abruptly change, and Dean is given a modicum of freedom.
She smiles at his answer. “Obviously. Why here and why now?”
Pay attention to them? He’d love nothing better than to give all of his attention to these marvelous wings. He’d never even thought about wings until Cas’s had finally appeared in front of him. Now, he is the proud owner of a full-fledged wing kink. The pun makes him chuckle to himself.
There are a few small canvases tossed on the ground next to his borrowed easel. Splashes of paint are showing on them, but he can’t see anything defined. One of them is ripped to shreds. That tells him everything he needs to know about Cas’s mood.
Dean is already hovering over the tub, so it only takes leaning down a few inches to collect his payment. It is Cas’s question, so Dean lets him control the kiss. It is firm, demanding and deep. Cas possesses, claims. When he starts to lean back, he finds his bottom lip caught in the pinching pressure of Cas’s teeth. Cas gradually lets it slip free, leaving Dean breathless and squirming.
He wants to run into their home, but he needs to be smart. If he’s taken unaware, if Bart has set another trap for him, he won’t be able to protect Cas.
Cas looks away, trying to approach this without making it into a big deal. “I chose Krushnic.”
“What are you working on?”
“I’ll stand up for you, you know I will, but the two of us standing alone are still cannon fodder.”
“Holy shit.” Sam’s face brightens in amazement. When he looks up, he sees the bizarre eye contact happening again.
“That’s cryptic. You’re not going to tell me who?”
Cas reaches down to grab Dean’s shaft and angle it down to fit snugly against his hole. “I guess you’d better fuck me hard and fast then so we don’t get interrupted.”
As Cas tries to shift direction, Dean decides he’s ready to claim his prize. With a burst of speed, he takes his omega to the ground, but rolls to absorb most of the impact. They land in a dense patch of ferns that are protecting thick mosses beneath. It’s the perfect bed for him and his omega.
“So you believe he deserves better?”
“Hey,” Dean calls to him softly. After a second time doesn’t register, he walks over and puts a gentle hand on his arm.
As soon as Dean is steady on his feet, he releases his impotent rage on Cas. He punches, shoves, and kicks at him while he screams about the injustice. Castiel, feeling so sorry for how he was forced to treat Dean in front of the court, lets him. Quietly, calmly, he lets Dean vent his fury on him. Lets him take his pound of flesh and then some.
“What?” Dean lifts his swollen lips and glazed gaze to question.
Cas’s praise fills him with warmth. His long cock is splitting him, and he widens his stance to let him take even more. As much as he loved being inside Cas, the feeling of Cas at his back, taking his pleasure from his body is his reason for drawing breath.
Continuing with the hand feeding, Dean widens his legs so that Cas has room to move between them. As Dean tries new foods, he watches Cas’s reactions. He finds that while honey is his favorite, he also enjoys the fruit. Dean feels pride in the fact that he is taking care of his friend. It’s more intimate than anything that they have ever done, but there is an innocence to it. Nothing about this scenario is scary. Even with Cas leaning his head down on Dean’s thigh while he chews, it feels right.
Cas turns as much as he can to see his expression. “I know. I’m sorry I riled you up.”
The paramedic pushes him back down on the gurney when he tries to sit up. “Sir, you need to be checked out. If everything looks good, you can be on your way in an hour or two. Okay?”
Cas shakes his head. “I suppose some things don’t change that much over the centuries.”
“What’s the idea?”
Given the way his day has been going, he isn’t surprised that Cas demands something sexual from him. Dean drops to his knees easily.
*****
“Bitter. Salty.”
With every day that they wake up together, enmeshed and tangled into one creature with two minds but one heart, Cas allows himself to nurture that tiny seed. Dean has unknowingly been checking off a list of mating behaviors, but Cas would never follow the courting through to its conclusion without letting Dean in on what it is that he’s doing. He just can’t bear to tell him yet.
Just a note: I'm not an expert in Russian prison/organized crime culture. Everything I've written comes from research. I actually did a lot more research than I can possibly put in the story, or it would end up being 100K words.
Cas furrows his brow. “I thought Claire picked up her Bonneville already.”
With a sigh, she commands, “Promise me.”
“We’ve taken out a dozen Wendigo. Why is this one any different?”
When Dean opens the drink menu, he urges Cas to do the same.
Cas leans down to lick across his pulse point, letting his tongue delve deep enough to feel the jackrabbit beat bump against it. “Mmm. I really, really do.”
“You don’t need to reassign them. I don’t plan to be out except on the days when I testify.”
“The government, the mob, a serial killer, a drug cartel…”
“I would never rape you.” The earnestness of Cas’s words feels like a knife to his gut.
Dean looks up at the gravelly voice. Castiel had entered the room behind the servants and he hadn’t noticed. He notices now and his eyes refuse to leave without taking in every possible detail. He vaguely remembers his reactions to the man in the courtyard - his completely inappropriate and out of character reactions. Dean swallows hard. Never in his life has he thought about a man in any but the most platonic way. Castiel is different, though. For some inexplicable reason, he is hitting every one of Dean’s lust triggers. He moves with such confidence and grace, masking a wild energy sitting just beneath the surface.  The chaos of black hair combined with deep blue eyes and pouty full lips all make his palms ache to reach out and touch. When he sits across from Dean and focuses his complete attention on him, a shiver runs up his spine. ‘Alright, that’s enough of that’, Dean snaps at himself. ‘Stay alert!’
“Dean?”
Dean puts a hand over the book for comfort and placates her with the words she wants to hear. “I’m sure she will.” He adds quietly, “Thank you. You’ve saved my life.”
He retreats to the door he left cracked open and puts himself on the other side of it. Leaning against it, he blows out a breath. That was fucking weird.
*****
With that adorable tilt, Cas replies, “That would be an advantage to be able to communicate over loud noise.”
Michael laughs. “How apt.”
The following day is spent in preparation for the lavish party, so there is hardly time to spend together until Dean is delivered back into Cas’s care after the extensive grooming.
At first, he handled the situation like a typical Winchester. Drink away your troubles and don’t acknowledge them no matter what anyone says. That had been fine for the first couple of days because it was exactly what Sam expected from his older brother. Then, he started googling everything he could find about Jimmy Novak. Stalker-ish, but still not harming anybody. Sam was certain that seeing proof that Jimmy was not Cas would maybe even help him move on. No dice.
After setting a box down on the table, he holds out Dean’s collar; the same chain and lock that they’ve used before. With a questioning arch of his brow, Cas asks permission. Dean knows that once he gives it, it will be the last time Cas asks permission for anything until they are finished playing. Dean nods curtly, bowing his head down to wait for the chilly, heavy weight to settle around his neck.
Cas growled without looking up from his laptop, “Unfortunately not. I have to claim that miscreant as a blood relative.”
Limping along in his letter by letter phonetics, he feels an unsettling presence approach to his left. Ominous shivers race down his spine, and Dean settles into a subtle fighting stance.
His lithe runner's body is beautiful in the glowing moonlight, and Dean pulls back a little of his speed, content to watch Cas from this small distance. His wild, feathery hair is damp with sweat, his muscles are proudly displayed, and Dean can’t wait to get each and every one of them under his nipping teeth and adoring tongue.
Stunned silence reaches back at him. “Holy shit,” Dean finally whispers.
“Fuck, Cas.” Dean’s voice is shaking. “I’m aching for you.”
“What do you mean?”
“Hey, what’s wrong, Cas?” Dean asks softly, angling his face in so that their words are kept private.
Dean nods but his heart is racing.
“I know. I’m not.”
“Mom? Dad? We’re here.”
“What do I do?” he asks when Dean prompts him to respond.
*****
“Yes.”
Michael looks grateful as he takes his leave. “He needs to be ready for-”
“Let me guess? It didn’t?” Dean’s jaw was clenching, but he hasn’t adopted any other pissed off body language, which gives Cas hope.
Cas shrugs, leaning back in his chair. “Yevgeny is a better teacher. I’m not known for my patience.”
At 6:58 am, Dean is waiting at the doors of the library. Even after stopping for coffee, he’s early. More than anything, he wants to pound on the door and demand to be let in. He can’t. He won’t. The last thing he needs is to be barred from the one place that will allow him to connect with Cas. Instead, he bounces on the balls of his feet, paces by the empty bike racks.
Because Dean is in the FBI database already because of his job, and he voluntarily handed over his weapon at the scene, he is free to go when Jody has all of her questions answered. Of course, he isn’t going anywhere yet. Not until Cas is released.
After getting nowhere with that clue after a few minutes, they dig into what else they found. Cas needs a break from reading, so he flips through the titles of papers that Dean had taken pictures of.
He nods in agreement. “Did pretty good, though. Sam’s a good kid.”
Step. Retreat. Cas hits the bookshelf and his breathing is uneven. Dean takes the book out of his hands and sets it aside.
“Um, pretty awful, actually.”
Fucked out and sated, Dean turns glassy eyes back to him. “Come for me, Cas,” he demands. Castiel obeys. Dean’s heart squeezes at how beautiful his immortal love is in the throes of orgasm.
“Maybe.” Cas goes back to the window, hoping to catch a last glimpse of Dean before he leaves the yard. Michael peeks out the window to follow Cas’s eyes.
Cas gapes at him. “Your parents own your apartment?”
After a filling meal with their host family, Cas and Dean wander back to the Acropolis. As the sun sets and the stars begin to show, Dean is mesmerized.
Hearing it breaks Dean’s heart. He’s never been more angry at those that took him. “Baby, you may not remember being the boy I fell for, but you’ve become the man I fall for more every day. I love you. Just as you are.”
Cas chuckles and ignores him. Dean, not one to be dismissed so easily, shoves the cart down the aisle a few feet so he can insinuate his body in between the shelves that Cas is pulling from and Cas himself. When he drops back to his feet, Dean slides his hands up Cas’s sides under his coat.
“Yes, I could have. But I don’t need to spy on you to know his body, Jim. I spent ten years with Cas as my best friend, and for the last four we were lovers. No one knows his body like I do.”
*****
Dean chuckles. “Sure, but that would be cheating and therefore disobedient. Right?”
Dean drinks deeply from the glass. “Getting back to what originally freaked me out, why did you tell me not to get used to that getting naked trick?”
“And if not?” Dean’s stomach turns at the thought.
“Dean, do I look like I’ve ever gone somewhere for brunch?”
“I was watching for that Azazel to come out of the building so I could track him. I need to figure out who he is and what he’s up to.”
“On the phone with your dad. About-about me?”
Without waiting for a reply, Dean spreads Cas’s thighs to an obscene angle, pulling on his center. He flips open the cap of the lube, drizzles it along his sheathed cock, and drips it onto Cas’s tight little knot of muscle. As he rubs it in, he feels a tiny bit of give. “How much prep do you need, sweetheart?”
A pause lingers. Eventually, Cas sighs. I am tired, Zeki. I will gather my resources and bring them to you in the next day or two. Agreed?”
He lands easily from the hop and gives her a once over as they start to walk. Her clothes are clean-ish, she’s not high, she looks rested. All things considered, he’s content with that much.
Cas steps back and runs into the door frame. At the moment, the last thing Cas wants to think about is painting. It makes his head pound in a sickening way. Another fear attacks his raw and bleeding thoughts. Dean just got the keys and he’s already brought a gift for him here? What is he playing at?
“Fuck,” Cas curses and closes his eyes. “I hate that I can’t be there.”
They had parted ways at his apartment on the morning after their submission experiment, knowing that it would be a while before they would be able to be together. He’d reluctantly let go of Cas, feeling wrong about it with every fiber of his being. He’d set the thought up on a shelf to contemplate later, and when he got around to examining it late one evening, he’d attributed it to the lingering effects of playing with power dynamics. Of course he didn’t want to let his dominant leave. He’d spent an entire day at the man’s feet being completely dependent on him.
“Yes, sir.”
“I was worried that I would get too worked up because this is completely outside of my comfort zone, and then I’d get performance anxiety because we were in front of so many others. It wasn’t the optimal situation for a first experience.”
As much as he wants to, Dean doesn’t grab his arm to stop him. Instead, he jogs ahead and then stops in the doorway, directly in his path. Cas sways back and stops, still not looking him in the eye. “Cas, I’m really sorry about having you arrested, but as you heard, it won’t be on your record.”
Cas is losing the will to continue with his plan. This provocative man is getting beneath his skin like no one before him. His stoic, grumpy soldier was enough of a puzzle to solve, but this open, lighter side of Dean is delightful. He yearns to pull Dean into the tub with him, get him wet and take him apart. He wants to bar the door and refuse to let either of them leave until he has kissed and licked and sucked on every inch of his smooth skin.
Dean takes a shuddering breath and then dials.
“Marriage.”
Dean leans back to scowl at him. “So, I wasn’t supposed to win that challenge? You were setting me up for failure?”
Dean is still hurt. He hasn’t forgiven Cas. More than anything, though, he wants to see him again. He isn’t going to wait to send a letter. He wants to talk to him now.
Jimmy is so miserable watching this young man fall apart that his eyes fill with answering tears. It doesn’t make sense. Why should he feel anything other than common sympathy for his plight? It must be because it directly involves him because seeing Dean like this is twisting him into agony.
Leaping to correct the misconception, Cas interrupts him. “No! Dean. I want you desperately. You are everything that I desire. It has been torture to be away from you.”
“I went to her, placating and subservient. She let me practically grovel.” Cas is seething with emotion, his restraint tattered. Delicate lights in their private rooms flicker and shake with his emphasized words. He begins pacing the open floor under impossibly high ceilings, so he loosens the grip he has on his true form. All six wings stretch themselves into this realm. They snap up and out, feathers fluffed to release some of the intense heat he is gathering due to his rancor.
“Meet?” Dean thinks about the book in his hands back in the present. His eyebrows leap up to his hairline. “Who? Michelangelo?”
“I don’t have a clue who he is. What the fuck is going on, Dean?”
Cas waits until Dean makes eye contact, and then he snaps his hips up into him. Dean huffs out a surprised groan. “Yeah, Cas. Hard and brutal. I want you to wreck me,” Dean grins. He’s already lifting to provide the counter-thrust for the next wave.
Cas nods, and cautiously explains. “Kneeling is like a pledge or an oath. I probably take it too seriously, but to me it signifies a promise of service and obedience. Seeing you on your knees, Dean, naturally makes my mind picture that type of relationship between us.”
“Can you keep your hands to yourself, Dean?”
If you enjoyed something in this chapter, or it made you feel inspired in some way, I'd love to hear about it. Keeping a consistent posting schedule is so much easier when you feel like your efforts are appreciated.
“Let’s go so you can get some sleep tonight. You obviously need it.”
Dean makes his way over and flops down onto the bed with a bone-deep sigh. Cas tucks himself against his side, one hand drifting into his hair to play with the short strands. Dean leans into Cas’s touch, letting the feel of his angel soothe him. They relax together, watching the dappled sunlight play across the top of their tent.
The mischief in Dean’s eyes pours over him like honey, sweet and sticky. A lift to the corner of Cas’s lips stokes the fire.
Sam holds his hands up. “Sorry, shit. I didn’t mean to hit a nerve. I just figured that if he’s important, you’d have told dad, that’s all.”
Cas rubs his hand over his jaw and sighs. “You need proof. Physical proof, yes?”
The earnestness in his speech is startling. Even though Castiel knows Dean is putting on a blatant show, he is still tempted to believe him. He files that information away for later. Dean is a masterful liar, which is a dangerous skill for an enemy to possess. Even thinking the word enemy leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. He doesn’t want this man as an adversary, not at all.
I am fighting writer's block something fierce. I don't like reading author apologies for delays, so I won't be hypocritical and write one here. Just know that I am doing the best I can at the moment. I feel like my creativity is starting to flow again, so that's a good sign. I was able to get about a third of my unanswered comments replied to, and I finished this chapter, so...I'm writing!!!
“It’s my honor, Dean. How are you?”
Shaking his head, Dean argues, “No, no, no. I wasn’t trying to be a brat.”
“How long have you known Novak?”
Cas looks up then. Dean is angry, confused, and struggling to maintain self-control. “Why would you keep this shit from me?”
*****
“Obedience is willing submission, first time and every time. Say it.”
“No, it’s not,” he denies. “I-”
“What? What do you mean?” The pearl-clutching is a bit over the top, but Cas tries to remain calm. There is so much anger percolating to the surface, though, now that he is in front of someone he can blame.
The juxtaposition of pride in Dean for rising above and sorrow for him that he has to puts Cas off kilter. He loses himself when Theofanis supervises a little too close to Dean. Thankfully, the Fae chuckles at his bristling possessiveness rather than taking it personally.
“Jesus, Cas. What happened?” He instinctively moves closer, hand reaching for the side of the prince’s face until he sees the man jerk away from him.
Whenever he thinks about Sam aligning with their worthless drunk of a father to put him in this place, his fury knows no bounds. It will be a long time, if ever, before he can forgive, let alone forget.
Dean groans, his muscles going limp in Cas’s grasp. “Fuck, yes.”
Hands lift and separate the globes of his ass, exposing his pink hole even more. Slick fingers run down the crease, and his hand turns to let his thumb rub in circles around the furled muscle, wetting it and helping him relax.  “Have you decided on your safe word, Dean?”
Mood shifted, Cas laughs and moves away from him.
Cas lets his thumb rub across Dean’s plush bottom lip as he shifts in his lap. “I was on my knees, spread wide. I was thinking about you touching me, how much I needed you.”
“I would like that very much, Malysh.” (young man - term of endearment)
“The truth is, I don’t know what I want from this arrangement. I’ve never offered anything of the sort. It is a … unique situation we find ourselves in. I promise that I will be your protector, your champion. I also promise that what I ask from you in return will never be something you can’t give. Is that fair?”
Dean grins. “Nope. That wasn’t the deal. You navigate and we stay wherever we land. We landed here, so we’re staying here.”
“God damn, that was gorgeous,” Cas praises, fire rushing through him like dry tinder.
Dean shakes his head, “No, I’m fine. I wanna go home.”
Dean nods his head, not trusting his voice.
He never has this problem with drawing. He can just put pencil to paper and within minutes, ideas would bombard him. Painting is entirely different. Last night, he’d spent a solid hour staring at a blank white canvas with trepidation. He had painted a random pattern of colors on it, just to have something other than white to look at. It didn’t help.
Cas blinds him with an excited grin, catching his fingers loosely with Dean’s. “I thought we might go for a ride.”
When they study the area, they are able to cross off the majority of the culverts they marked. Dean grins and kisses him. “That little nugget of wisdom is going to save hours of tramping around out here in the woods.”
“I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
Cas looks up then. “I’m happy to help, but every time I ask you to explain your line of thinking, you shoo me away. Tell me what I can do, and I will do it. Happily. It is my life on the line.”
“I think so, yes. We haven’t been together for long, less than a year, but we have been through some extreme times and they have brought us closer.”
Cas tilts his head back up and teases, “I was expecting a chaste kiss. That was very unexpected.”
Cleansing breaths rejuvenate him, clear away the residue of pungent smells from his abused nose. Up above him, an iron girder is suspended from its center on a similar rock column. The ends have been filed down, so it looks like a diving board. On the other end of the girder, a chaotic statue of a man sits. Dean doesn’t see a sign telling him not to, so he leaps up and grabs hold of the iron. Swinging his legs up over his head, they land on top, and he is able to pull himself up to sitting with no problem.
Looking around him, Sam decides to at least call Dean before jumping to conclusions. Who knows what that curtain of light could have led to. When he doesn’t answer, Sam continues the search on foot. He comes across the disgusting remains of yet another Wendigo victim, which terrifies Sam until he realizes that it couldn’t possibly be Dean. After an hour of looking for signs of his brother, Sam decides that the best course of action would be to get in touch with Bobby. If anyone knows what they are dealing with and where Dean could be, it’s him.
