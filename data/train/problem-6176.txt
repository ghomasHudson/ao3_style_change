“I almost threw it in the ocean,” Tony says, resting against him. They’re in their bed at the Tower, Tony’s head pillowed against his chest. He’s shirtless, and the bandages from where the arc reactor once sat are fresh and bright white against the olive tones of his skin.
“Yeah, Tony, please.”
Steve sketches quickly, capturing the way Tony’s hands cut through the air as he tosses little bits and pieces into the stir fry he’s making for dinner. Just like everything else, Tony cooks like he’s putting on a show, and Steve smiles to himself, head ducked low to capture a series of arches that form the curve of Tony’s jaw, the tilt of his head.
“Sergeant Barnes has spent decades as a Prisoner of War for the most deranged sect of Nazis this century has ever seen. Sergeant Barnes has been subjected to a level of torture you and I can’t even imagine, Mr. Secretary.” Tony pauses to draw a breath, keeping his voice as even and steady as he can, “Sergeant Barnes is a
“Don’t talk like that.” The words are sharp, but Tony’s hands are soft.
Arousal teases at the boiling rage in his belly and the embers of what Steve feels for Tony sucks in oxygen and surges back into a bonfire.
Steve grinned into his shoulder, biting softly at the skin just below his gland and making him cry out. “No. Tony, no.”
Prying himself away from the bottle for the countless time in his life was just as hard as it had always been, and more. On the surface sobriety doesn’t actually change anything. He still feels on edge, stiff and formal around the others when he has to see them and desperately lonely and bitter regardless of whether they were there or not.
“You have a lot of nerve coming here, Steve. One phone call and you’d be behind bars. And you know it, too. You know it and you came here anyways because poor fucking Tony Stark would never call in his own partner. Well, you’re right again,
“Steve—"
Steve hardly gives Nick Fury a passing glance as they cross paths outside the entrance to the Barton’s barn. One of Fury’s eyebrows quirks up at his tone, but he keeps his silent spy master observations to himself and continues up the path to the house.
Steve comes, hours later, and taps on the glass while Tony’s lying prone on the old futon that somehow survived the destruction. Or maybe it’s new and just ugly.
Tony brushes back his hair, letting one of his thumbs trace along his lips. “It can be whatever you want.”
The crease is back between Tony’s eyebrows, his nose wrinkling in confusion. He still hasn’t pulled his hand away and the heat that radiates from his palm warms Steve like dying embers still burning low. “I’m not following you, Steve.”
Isn’t that always the question?
He glances down to Rhodey’s newest message.
With Tony’s hands on him, Steve can pretend.
When Tony starts to move, a painstaking, controlled pace meant to wind Steve up and drive him mad, Steve arches up and wraps his arms around Tony’s waist. Just like the first time, he presses his mouth to the arc reactor, tracing the mottled skin at the edges with his tongue.
Tony’s hair would be soft, greying more every day, with the spicy smell of his cologne wafting up from the curve of his neck. Steve would press his face into that space, close his eyes and just breathe. Steve would be home.
“Jesus fuck. No, what the fuck are you doing? Don’t come near me!” He’d exclaimed when Tony had shuffled slowly closer, hands up in front of his face, bruises evident on his throat already. One thick thumb print interrupted the mating gland at his throat, skewing the shape.
“I know.”
anything! I want you to listen to me and respect what I have to say, even if you don’t like it.”
“I’d run it for him.”
Steve focuses on sucking him down, swallowing around the length of Tony’s cock until he’s sobbing above him, harsh but quiet as if he desperately wants to keep it all in. There’s only so much one man can take.
“I assume that means you’ll be on your best behaviour, then.”
“Okay, Tony. I hear you.”
The battle rages on around them, but it’s like they’re the only two people that exist. They reach for the gauntlet together. Steve slams an elbow into Tony’s chest, forcing him back.
Steve snorts, affronted, but Bucky’s known him a lot longer than Tony and snaps his metal fingers at him, pointing. “You are jealous! You’re worried I’m zeroing in on your guy.”
Later, he'll ask Steve to squeeze the air from his lungs until the world narrows and all he knows is pleasure and the twinkling lights of the night sky refracting in the depth of Steve’s eyes.
“Okay,” Tony says slowly, waiting for more.
That brings Tony up short. Has nothing really changed then? Steve hadn’t had the right to give him commands and expect him to follow them before, not really. He’s all but said as much and just like that everything post-Siberia comes rushing in and something starts to curdle deep in the pit of Tony’s stomach.
Steve glanced towards the bed, taking in Tony’s pale frame as he slept.
“Mm.”
“Tony? Is everything alright?” The confusion somehow makes him angrier.
He’s disoriented and in pain, clawing his way through a jungle of wires pooled on his chest and wrapping up around his cheeks. A canula tickles under his nose and of all the pain radiating through his body, he is distinctly aware of his body already working to force the IV out from his arm. The pink blots of colour on both hands suggest he’s already worked out more than one port.
“And where does Tony fall in all of this?” Natasha asks, voice just shy of menacing.
Guilt mixes with remorse and regret and grief and loss and Tony slams the door shut on all of it. Focus on Peter. Peter needs you right now.
The moment that his lips touch Steve’s, his whole body lights up like fireworks in the night sky. If anything, he deserves a medal for the whole five seconds he holds back before he’s crawling into Steve’s lap, thighs on either side of Steve’s hips. Tony gets his hands in his hair, stroking his face, cupping his chin. Any part of Steve that he can get his hands on, really.
“And?”
“Stop acting so indignant. You threw this away, Steve. Not me.”
Steve had been so at ease, so peaceful that night, and, as Tony often reminded him, so painfully oblivious.
Steve moans, biting down until he can feel his teeth grind together. Spit drips down between his legs and pools on the flat surface. It should be uncomfortable, sitting in the cooling little puddle but now, like this, it only escalates the pleasure.
“Couldn’t have known I was coming around the corner, Rogers.”
Pepper shakes her head and rests her temple against the doorframe.
Natasha’s lips twitch at the corner as she thrusts a phone into Tony’s face but they all turn to Steve as he comes towards them.
He ate with measured bites until all the food was gone, lost in a fugue marked by the sloping grace of Tony’s hands as he prepared them something far better than the pasta the hospital provided. Once upon a time Steve might’ve had that—the soft domesticity of watching Tony at work in their kitchen—coming up behind him and curling his arms around his waist. Opening his mouth and letting Tony sneak tastes between his lips under the thin guise of teasing each other until the meal was finished.
“Yeah. Maybe.”
Comments are much loved, let me know what you think!
The day they’d finally made up, Bucky had locked himself in his apartment, drowning in a smell not unlike a thin coffee, sweetened with hot cocoa that Steve used to make them in the biting Brooklyn winters. It wasn’t like anything he’d ever experienced before, and he’d fisted himself roughly and often, picturing them together. Picturing himself with each of them. Between them.
Their midwife, Anita, is a kindly looking older woman with steady hands, and she gives him a knowing look that leaves embarrassment prickling on the back of his neck. He’s being ridiculous. Women give birth every day. An infinite number of parents raise happy, healthy children, but he’s scared.
“Ninety seconds to the surface,” JARVIS advised, and a flicker of the SOS appeared across the HUD before it disappeared. Even the alarms had stopped blaring. “Suit integrity, 23%.”
God, it’s miraculous to watch Tony stroke off on him, getting off on the way Steve can toss him around like he’s nothing. Steve knows how he loves it like this—the slick drag of him catching at Tony’s rim when he pulls all the way out just to plough back in.
Tony kisses him, straining up to kiss him with everything that he has and shows Steve that this is okay. Even if it could destroy them both, it’s still okay. Tony’s willing to get hurt again.
Morgan becomes a small version of Tony before Steve can even process she’s entered their lives. Every day is a whirlwind of growth and discovery as she learns about the world around her. She learns to walk and talk sooner than she should, not that it comes to either of their surprise. Tony Stark is her father, and Steve would have expected nothing less.
“Is that why you walked away?” Steve counters, and his lack of understanding, his complete disregard for anything Tony is saying or has said, continues to astound him. “Is it? Damn it, Tony. Are you saying you walked out on our marriage because you think I’m like your
Hearing those words from Tony’s mouth had been the biggest gift of all and Steve’s heart soared. Tony trusted him. Finally, after all that time, of showing Tony that there was merit in letting himself fall backwards—that Steve would be there, always—Tony was standing on the cliff’s edge ready to jump.
Before Tony can even think to stop him, Steve’s fingertips brush against the thick line of scar tissue and his fingers skitter away. Steve startles backward, breaking the kiss and holding Tony back with a hand on his shoulder.
“Don’t you—don’t you think we should talk about this a little more?” Steve’s breathless, a high flush rising on his cheeks, and Tony smirks down at him.
“Feel like we haven’t fucked ‘im in ages either.” Bucky teased, a hand sliding back down his chest, aborted when Steve grasped his wrist and pinned it to his own thigh on the couch.
After proving that Tony Stark, Not Recommended, had been a serious underestimation of his skill, Tony could even argue that he deserved this pseudo-retirement. The team has new blood now. Spider-Man, War Machine, and the Winter Soldier have been made permanent additions, along with Ant-Man and the Falcon. Though Tony isn’t so sure about Scott Lang.
and he’s taken a massive risk coming back to the United States in the first place. While he’s gone, Bucky and the rest of the team are unprotected in Wakanda. Natasha, Wanda and Sam are a formidable opponent to any enemy with the Wakandans as a welcomed ally, but worry still twists like barbed wire in his belly.
Before Steve can process what Tony’s doing, Tony is shoving at his shoulders. He’s tugging him in and pushing him away as if he can’t make up his mind before he settles on pushing him
, acting under extreme duress, and the Avengers will not see him doubly punished for the sake of unfortunate politics.”
He’s pulling off his tie on a Thursday afternoon in the kitchen of the Malibu mansion, almost complete in its remodel, when FRIDAY interrupts the mental blueprints he’s drawing up for R&D.
“I didn’t see it that way.”
“Wow, that’s so much cooler up close,” Peter reaches out to shake Bucky’s hand but barely even glances at his face as he takes in the length of silver prosthesis and weaponry.
“I’m going to make pasta for dinner tonight.” Steve explained. “It was Tony’s turn to choose. He picked Italian.”
Without even thinking, he thumbs some of the spend near Tony’s nipple and presses it into Tony’s mouth, chasing after it with his tongue.
Take that, Steve.
“Yeah. You know how it is in the hospital. Things get a bit boring.” Tony imagines his face must morph into a teasing smile, it feels like a teasing smile, but Steve doesn’t react. Just keeps looking at him as if he might explode or run from the room.
“You’re not even going to pretend, Pete? How do you even manage to hide your secret identity? Or do you? Has the entire world figured out who Spider-Man is and I just missed that? Because you’re a shit liar. Absolute crap, kid,” Tony cocks a hip against one workbench as Peter gapes at him like a salmon.
There’s a lingering fear in his eyes, and Steve knows he fully understands the risks. Sometime between Pepper’s surgery and Steve’s recovery, Tony had decided they were worth it, and for some reason, Steve felt confident that it would all be fine. It wasn’t a suspicion, but a definitive certainty that in a few hours, Tony would be on his way home to recover.
Steve brushes a hand over him, wiping as much as he can off the armour while Tony looks away. He refuses to let himself process that this is
Tomorrow he’ll have to start making arrangements to bury his soulmate.
The words come out unfiltered. “It wasn’t for you.”
At least Tony has always been straight with him. “Just tell me,” Steve forces out, throat suddenly raw.
“It’s fine, I’ll be there with you the whole time. Someone had to do it, right? It’s an easy enough job, and after you figured everything out the first time, I thought we’d make a good team. Been a while since we worked as a team, huh?” Steve nudges Tony’s shoulder with his own and Tony just stares up at him, disbelieving and dismayed.
“There’s nowhere to stay. The Compound doesn’t even exist anymore.”
But Tony knows the power that Steve holds in his hands and has been careful never to give himself that kind of permission again.
“Shh, okay, you’re okay. Come on, now.” He strokes a hand up and down Steve’s spine, into the hair at the back of his neck.
Rough fingers slide back along his jaw, spilling down along the curve of his neck and onto his chest. The night before, Steve had been so careful to avoid his scars, fingers purposefully skittering away, only skimming the edges of the long, horizontal mess that crosses over his breastbone. It slices straight through the circle of scar tissue that used to house the arc reactor.
“It’s not about winning. It’s about maintaining appearances. You’ve done that. I can cover the rest. You’re retired now, Tony. Taking a break from these things is exactly what that means.”
Steve brushes a hand across his wet cheeks and slides down Tony’s body without a word. He kneels between his legs and presses a kiss to his belly, right below his belly button, before he leans in and sucks Tony down to the root.
Steve had searched his eyes, enunciating each word carefully to ensure there was no possibility of miscommunication. “You want me to fuck you. In your sleep. While you’re having a nightmare?”
Steve was able to order around the corpse of his soulmate—give the suit posthumous orders without even realizing—all because of a snide comment made in anger Steve rarely thought about? All because Natasha had gotten things wrong and Fury had been a bit more of a bastard than usual with his delivery?
“That’s right.”
The fantasy shifted then, and Steve gritted his teeth as the tension in his belly wound tighter.
“It was nothing, Pete.” Lie. “And I’m not here just for you.” Lie. “Seriously, everything’s fine.” Another lie. It almost makes it easy to see how the lies could have spilled out of Steve, one after another, until they littered the ground like thousands of grains of sand. “Did you still want that pizza?”
Maybe, he thinks, if he asks nicely, they’ll bury Steve along with him. After all, how can Tony expect Steve to go on living without him?
He gets a flash of short, manicured nails sliding across the hair of his scalp, head pillowed on her shoulder after a particularly difficult day. The whisper of her pet name for him once.
“Oh.” Understanding dawns on him. “This is one of the things.”
Using his hand and his mouth, he works Steve over until precome leaks steadily over Tony’s fist and Steve isn’t sure if he’s coming or not. He’s trapped in the unforgiving purgatory between desperation and relief, tears streaming down his cheeks.
“Agent Romanoff is waiting for you on the helipad, Captain. Departure in twelve minutes.”
“Sixty goddamn hours. Fuck. I had no idea it had gotten this bad.”
In retaliation, Tony reaches up and twists one of his nipples until Steve’s worrying at his lower lip, and his eyes are falling closed again.
Steve closes his eyes and breathes it all in. There must be a way he could trap all of this in his lungs and be surrounded by this feeling forever. Not only does he have everyone around him, but he knows now that one day everyone else he’s loved will be here too. Steve doesn’t have to say goodbye, and surely Tony will help him find ways to pass the time.
Tony curved into the motion the warmth of welcome spread through Steve. Tony was always such a responsive man, even in sleep. Behind his eyelids, Tony’s eyes flickered from side to side and Steve leaned down to press a kiss to his temple, breathing in the spice of his cologne and the soft undertones of
Those masterful, practiced hands.
Tony smiles. “I missed you too, baby girl. I need you to run some odds for me.”
Steve emphatically shakes his head.
Tony, gracious as always, would have been a fool to ignore such a perfect request.
“A two-hour cat nap where he keeps us both up muttering in his sleep doesn’t count as coming to bed, Steve.”
Natasha genuinely seemed to want him to enjoy what she brought, depositing slivers of baklava and delicate little kartoshka. Last week she had produced a dense little cake he couldn’t remember the name of – something that tasted like bananas and hailed from Spain.
“Why are
“Let’s hear them out.” Tony waves them over, and when they sit down, it feels like the beginning of the end.
“But how?” Steve had asked, all of seventeen, adjusting to his new presentation as an alpha. The revelation had shocked everyone in his life, most of all himself.
“I’m never letting you go,” Tony says, lips pressed to his ear. “Aunt Peg’s the smartest woman I’ve ever known. I’m never letting you go now, Steve.”
“Hey, stop.” Steve leans in and brushes his lips against Tony’s, abruptly cutting him off. “Don’t worry about that. We’re exactly where we’re supposed to be, and if something else comes, we’ll be ready. You know we’ll be ready.”
Tony’s voice is small and strained. “Come here.”
“And why, pray tell, would you do something like that for little ol’ me?” Tony asked, tone light and teasing as he stepped into Steve’s space.
Ninety days from the date he first handed Steve the papers and let
“No time. Hurry up.”
“We could order a heavier one for you.” Tony blurts out, interrupting the stuttering because the last thing he wants anyone to feel in this place is shame.
He feels rooted to the spot. He’s not certain he can move or breathe.
“No, not just for you.” That time it isn’t a lie.
“You’ve been the one saying all along that as long as we’re together, it’ll be fine. This is another one of those moments. We got lucky, and Morgan, hell, she’s everything. She’s perfect, and this life we’ve made together is just as perfect. But not everyone was so lucky.”
Steve had ordered around his corpse, lifeless in the coffin that was the Iron Man armour and Tony had thought that that would be okay. That Steve could somehow come out the other end of that scenario with his sanity intact and not be completely fucked up. Or he knew that wouldn’t be the case and made the call anyways,
“You’ve been down here before,” Bucky cuts him off. “Don’t try to tell me this is the first time—we don’t do that with each other. I really thought this was helping you, at first, but this isn’t right. It’s not healthy.”
They do win.
When Tony finally works up the nerve to call Peter, he’s eager and willing, more than happy to drop everything and web his way over to the Compound, really, Mr. Stark, he’s not busy in the slightest! Tony sends a car for him instead because it’s a bit of a trek, even for Spider-Man, and he arrives just before dinner, when Tony will introduce him to the team.
“Hey,” Steve whispers in his ear, wet fingers tipping his head back again to trade sweet, soft kisses, before Steve slips from his body and steps back. He takes Tony with him, arms working to twist Tony until they’re pressed close together. Steve’s firm, warm presence wraps around him and Tony wants to bury inside him, pressing a fraction closer as if it were possible. “Thank you.”
Comments are much loved, let me know what you think!
“Tony, please—”
The Compound stands in the distance, glowing against the low dip of the afternoon sun. When they’d started the planning, Steve had suggested they hold the ceremony down by the river for the quiet. The soft wind and the gentle lapping of water; an atmosphere he knew Tony loved. It had surprised him when Tony had suggested an arch against the treeline.
Howard brushes her off with a sweep of his hand and she stumbles backward.
Time does Tony the favour of slowing to a stop, and for a second, he swears that they hang there, suspended between reality and the fantasy that Tony’s clung to for the better part of a decade. The answer is so obvious now, and maybe there will be more conversations to be had, and maybe he’ll never marry Steve again because he’s a betting man and the odds have never been in their favour. Not from the start.
Steve was gentle, oh so gentle, when the first hints of a nightmare had started. They’d prepped Tony beforehand to make things simpler, and Steve had been able to slide right into Tony’s body as if it were made only for him.
He looks up at Bucky to ask, but the sleek, black arm stops him short. It isn’t the light silver of the Stark Tech he remembers.
It’s not perfect after the conversation in Tony’s workshop, but it works well enough.
“He’s going to come over here,” Rhodey shifts sideways, his back to Steve, and catches Tony’s eye.
Bucky rumbled audibly when the beep sounded. “Stark. This is at least the third message I’ve left you. ‘M startin’ to take it personal. Call me back.”
The blunt head of Tony’s cock pushes into him and Steve feels made whole. In Tony’s arms he’s alive, reaching up to touch the sun and bottle the clouds. “Tell me again, Tony. Please,” he begs, tugging gently at the hair at the nape of Tony’s neck.
He grilled up steaks the size of Clint’s face, paired with creamy Caesar salad and a potato salad recipe his Ma used to make before the war set in. Things became a bit more complex with Natasha’s cabbage rolls, which came out perfectly, stinking up the Tower with the smell of boiled cabbage.
Steve switches to the private line, just for the two of them, racing up the street to where the Hulk is being overrun. Thor is in the sky overheard, Mjolnir flashing against the glint of the sun. They’re almost through. Victory is within reach and Steve can almost taste it.
Clint shrugged. “So? We can have steaks on Saturday and then Steve can make them again three weeks from now. Stark can afford it.”
Steve releases one of Tony’s hands, but he doesn’t go far. Instead of clocking him, Tony’s fingers fist in the hair at the nape of his neck and
Tony gives him a set of stunted pats on the back and says, “no tears, Happy. There’s nothing different about today than any other day.”
Tony’s gaze flickers up, expression carefully neutral. “That’s not what I said. Are you—is that what you want?”
“Never, Tony. I’ll never let you go.”
“I lost the kid.”
Worse, he has absolutely no idea how much or how little Steve and Barnes have shared with the rest of them, and if they haven’t said anything, he sure as he isn’t going to. There’s no sure-fire way to know what they’re thinking; if they know.
“Tony, calm down. Don’t–”
Every time he opens his mouth, the words die on his tongue because he can’t figure out where to begin. There’s a pandemonium of chaos overtaking the globe. In some places, they haven’t even finished counting the lost. Governments are in chaos, and their own leaders are calling on them. On Tony. On the remaining Avengers.
“Barnes. You safe to be around people now?” Tony's voice exuded a confidence that didn’t align with the conversation Bucky’d been overhearing.
In the night, he woke hot and heavy, a desperate, aching erection between his thighs and Tony would only smirk and pull Steve towards him.
He has
“Bucky told me what you did for him. And for Sam.” There’s nothing challenging or threatening in his voice. So why does Tony feel so defensive?
Steve presses his forehead into the arc reactor again, rolling back and forth and there are tears landing on Tony’s belly now.
Just when Tony thought maybe it was too much, Steve bit down hard, drawing a fresh wave of blood from Tony’s throat as something forced its way into his mind. It was new – not what had been there before – not what he had been expecting.
Steve eyes him carefully as he continues, but doesn’t rise to the challenge. He’s perfectly professional, not a hair out of place.
It all ends too soon, when a massive swirling orange portal appears in his bedroom and Tony’s pulling the blankets up to his chest like a scandalized miss. He doesn’t have much of a choice when Voldemort himself steps out of the portal, Bruce half behind him with bugged out eyes, and tells Tony that he needs him to go with him, that it’s time.
“What is it?” Tony snaps.
“FRI? Can you get him back, baby?” Tony asks, frantic eyes scanning the HUD. There’s no reception. He watches her scan various satellites, trying to pick up a point of contact, anything. But nothing comes back because he’s on a spaceship hurtling to Thor knows where.
Natasha reached over to ruffle the kid’s hair. “They’re the Widow ones.”
“What?” Peter demands, waving his hand across the holograms to pause them. The colour in his cheeks is dissolving quickly. “You never–I thought you said–oh my god, Mr. Stark, I–I didn’t realize. Oh man. I’m so sorry, Mr. Stark– oh no what did I–”
Tony pauses by the table and Bucky looks at him, dark eyebrows lifting.
It’s amazing. It’s perfect. It’s
“You were a drunk. A sleazy, slimy playboy who didn’t give a second thought to anyone but himself. You had the biggest ego I’ve ever seen and you didn’t think about anyone but yourself. But then I got to know you. Slowly. And I started to see that that wasn’t much more than a façade you hid behind.”
“I’m far from perfect, Tony,” Natasha says blandly.
The man that has Steve, literally, worshiping the ground he walks on. Bucky doesn’t owe Tony anything. So he chalks it up to guilt over the murder his mostly innocent parents and throws on some obnoxious, loud music to try and drown out his subconscious.
“Tony,” Steve’s eyes are on his, pinning him in place, “let me fix this. Talk to me. What can I do?” If Tony were to close his eyes, he’d be able to feel the ghost of Steve’s fingers tipping his chin up and pressing their lips together.
Shifting up higher on the mattress, Tony fumbles for the tube of lube he’s shoved into the bedside table; a pathetic hope that he might get lucky or at the very least have the urge to re-familiarize himself with his own hand.
“She was my aunt, you know.”
“You’re so dramatic, Queens. We need to rearrange your patrols so you aren’t spending so much time with Iron Man. I’m beginning to think he’s a bad influence.”
Maybe Steve just liked to be naked, and hell if Tony didn’t love being pressed up against him when he was.
Tony kisses him again, grinning against his mouth. “So, let’s review. You die and the first thing you want is to play with my bots and get fucked? You’re one hell of a man, Steve.”
As tears drip onto his back, Steve shatters. Every atom in his body flies apart under Tony’s skillful touch and with Tony driving up into him, hand flying over his desperate cock, Steve never stood a chance.
Steve just laughs, shaking his head as he reaches for the catches and pries the shirt off, Tony’s fingers following soon after in a searing trail up from his stomach to his chest.
“I know, it’s okay.”
The memory shifts before Tony can see how he might’ve replied.
After, it was easy enough for Steve to drop back into the fantasy and lose himself in what it might be like to have Tony in his bed with him, sated and relaxed. Tony would be so warm with his legs tangled with Steve’s as they traded soft, loving kisses. The chill would be gone and Steve could spend the rest of his life in perfect contentment, at peace and fulfilled. They’d never leave the bedroom, if he had any say in the matter.
He drains the remnants of his glass and punches the button to end the call even though Steve’s been about to say something more.
“No, shut up,” Tony snapped despite the chattering of his teeth. “You let go. You made me
“Ms. Potts.”
“Don’t drink. Not tonight. You’re upset. You’re going to do something you regret, again.” Tony’s head shoots up, startled and he meets Pepper’s even, telling gaze. “You really think I don’t know? Come on, Tony. It was obvious. I thought maybe you were just getting him out of your system at the Tower. One last hurrah. But it’s never going to end for you if the two of you keep doing this.”
Tony needs to stop shouting.
“Like that, sweetheart?”
Steve would give it to him if he asked.
still in love with him.”
It only makes Steve kiss him deeper, pulling him closer as if he could tug him inside his chest and keep him safe. Keep them all safe.
“Coulda offered, jerk.” Affection soothed the sting, but Bucky frowned.
“You’re drinking.” It’s not a question.
Neither of them do.
Wanda laughs softly. “It’s sweet, Stark.”
“No!” Tony says too quickly. “No, it’ll compromise the mission, he’ll only worry. I’ll let him know when he gets home.”
Except then Steve had put a plane down in the ice, and woken up seventy years into the future with vanilla clinging to his skin, torturing him in the most devastating way. Alpha-Alpha relationships, though few and far between, were accepted and respected for the most part and his heart sagged in his chest under the weight of his loss.
There was no water, no crashing waves. Just Tony’s arms wrapped around him.
He snaps the phone shut and ignores the vibrations that follow, letting them drown in the back of his nightstand. It’s not that he doesn’t feel the same–of course he does. That’s the entire problem; as much as he wants to get past this, move on, accept the fact that for whatever reason he wasn’t
The fallout came later when resentment and malice dripped from Tony’s lips and played on a torturous loop through for hours afterward.
Choking on nothing aside from his own humiliation, Tony padded back towards them with a flaming red face. He was torn between loving it, and brutal embarrassment not because Bucky was teasing, but because it didn’t even make sense that he had stolen these things.
It could be any number of things off with Tony, really. Most obviously that if Tony was going into heat, which was fewer and farther between these days, Clint’s teasing had struck a chord and he was wrapped up in his mind over Bucky’s comments from before.
He’s hurt Tony and Tony’s hurt him and Steve is still so fucking angry but there’s nothing to do with the rage.
“No, of course I’m not really thinking of offing myself, Jesus.” Tony knows when he’s being an asshole and right now, he’s treading on thin ice, preparing to push away one of the few good people left in his life.
Tony has to force himself away from Steve, prying his fingers from his shirt and pushing backwards. He tries to commit him to memory, standing tall and beautiful, perfectly fucked out and mussed up from Tony’s hands and mouth all over his body. It hasn’t been this way before. Fear is always present in their line of work. He’s terrified of losing him again.
“Show me,” Steve murmurs.
Suddenly, Tony was empty.
“Here, let me—” Steve reaches down between them, a difficult task from where he has Tony folded in half with his knees up by his ears, fucking into him with a pace that’s borderline cruel. Before he can get a hand around Tony’s cock, Tony slaps him away and distracts him with his tongue forced into Steve’s mouth.
Steve’s letting him have this. Letting him have him, when he’s vulnerable and raw, when Tony has been less than perfect and hardly deserves it by half. But Steve’s giving this to him, handing over the reins and giving him control. For a man like Steve, it’s a gift Tony cherishes with everything that he is.
Now, Tony breaches the silence, and the torrent of loss comes flooding in at full force.
“This is not doing anything for me.” Steve deadpanned, tugging Tony towards him and licking a strip along the underside of his jaw, practically purring as he reached down and traced the line of Tony’s waistband. “But
“Maybe in a way, it is. This doesn’t come natural to me, Tony. I’m not sure it ever will. It’s killing me not to tell you what I think. But do I know that I should keep my mouth shut?” Steve ducks his head and gives Tony a rueful look. “Absolutely.”
“He’s not feeling himself. I know him, better than any of you, once he’s feeling better, he’s going to want to—”
Steve has laid him down on the pyre and set him ablaze, thrusting into him while he burns and turns to ash, the taste of Steve’s kisses as bitter as charcoal.
It was something Steve could never hope to understand, but in that exact moment, he knew.
He can’t take it. He can’t. He’ll come and all this will be for nothing.
Some days were easier than others.
The little part of Tony’s heart that follows Steve wherever he goes is missing again. For the brief moment they were together, it was nice to feel whole. Even when it wasn’t.
Tony reaches up to pet his face, tracing his fingers across the harsh line of stubble forming at his jaw.
No matter where or how he fucks him, Steve gets it perfect. Every. Single. Time.
Steve feels powerless alright. Completely at Tony’s mercy and suspended in his arms. He’s burning up, split open on Tony’s cock as he works himself in one painstaking inch at a time. Tony tosses him around like a rag doll, using his meager weight against him to push Steve into the couch and slam him back into the cradle of his hips.
“I figured I owed you, after I, you know, blew the last one off.”
“If the next thing out of your mouth isn’t the truth, Steve, I swear to Tesla I’ll—”
“Did you figure it out?”
“They’ll be fine.” Even as he says it, Steve tries not to shift, biting down on the inside of his cheek as his ribs ripple beneath his skin. It feels like everything inside him is free-floating, drifting off to places it doesn’t belong like a puzzle spilled onto the floor. The serum will handle it though. It always knits and stitches him back together, and Tony
The look he gives Steve is decimating. It’s rage and heartbreak and a man lost, looking for a place to lay the blame. He can lay the blame at Steve’s feet if he has to. Steve will take it all, only if it means that he never loses him, never has to watch him collapse before he hits the ground and disappear on the breeze.
As if he hasn’t just been snapped out of existence.
“Christ, Tony,” Steve pants against his back, voice wrecked. “I can’t believe you’re—
“Come stay with me,” Steve is saying, the newspaper folded in his lap and Tony isn’t sure where he’s even found one. The StarkPad, which could just as effortlessly give him news from around the globe, sits neglected on the side table because Steve is still old-fashioned in more ways than one and the tips of his fingers are ink-stained evidence.
It didn’t particularly taste like anything special either.
Steve’s orgasm creeps up on him, overtaking him without warning and leaving him rigid and panting, thrusting off-rhythm into the warm heat of Tony’s body with a groan of
“Just admit it.”
“We’re not asking you to forgive each other,” Steve says quietly, and Tony takes a significant interest in the dirt underneath one of his nails, mouth tipped down in distaste. “We’re asking you to put aside what you can, for now, for the greater good. I’m sure if the WSC can set aside the Accords, this is the very least we can do.”
“Tony,” Steve starts again, hard and firm as if he’s prepared to say what he has to for this to end but Tony ignores him. Steve can make his own bed and lie in it.
Tony doesn’t have an answer so he just shakes his head.
“You’re not supposed to do this by yourself.” Tony murmurs, pressing his forehead into Steve’s temple. It feels so good to hold him. To be held by him again, even as his body is screaming to be let go.
“Our stuff will be here in a bit, so what do you want to do first?” Tony leans against the island that juts out to form a half-sunken wet bar. “A tour? Dip your toes in the ocean? What?”
Steve’s whispering his name like a prayer, cracked and raw when his other hand comes up to clutch Tony’s wrist in a vice grip.
Tony dies anyway.
The rest of the Avengers slowly come forward to fan around him, shaking hands and making introductions. Steve and Bucky are last, Steve coming forward and offers a handshake. It’s the only time Peter’s beam falters, but he recovers quick enough that Tony thinks only he and Steve have really noticed.
“Oh, well that’s not so–wait, do you have a new super soldier web fluid you forgot to mention?” Peter rolls his eyes, like
“Yeah? Somethin’ about your alpha in your nest doin’ it for you, doll?”
“I can’t,” Steve’s voice is thick and pitched low with desire, but there’s reluctance there that slows Tony just for a second, “not like last time. Tony, not like last time.”
“I’m sorry, I am so fucking sorry.”
“I know you said something to him. I just didn’t think you’d cave so quick. Out with it, Parker. What’d you say that’s got Cap so on edge?”
was sent to honeypot me so I stand by that initial reaction,” Tony leans back in the chair and crosses his legs at the ankle, flicking a smirk in Natasha’s direction. “Plus, I still want one.”
Tony prods at the wound, already knowing full well that the way the words tumble stiffly from her mouth, it’s more than he can possibly comprehend. Natasha’s twitches up at the corner.
“Then you better not come,” Tony says simply, before he drops to his knees and swallows Steve’s cock to the base. He jerks forward as Tony sucks, holding himself back from thrusting into Tony’s mouth as his cock disappears into the sinful circle of his lips.
“Fantastic,” Steve breathes into his mouth, calculating just how much force it might take to peel the suit off Tony piece by piece. “Let’s do it again, and you can drop me into the ocean after.”
“If only you were so lucky, kid.” Tony ruffles a hand through his hair and nudges him off towards the showers before calling off the rest of the drills. The team doesn’t even give Steve a second glance, tossing weapons aside and heading off in various directions without so much as a word from their leader.
After everything, it had been a long road back.
An arc of heat and light slices through the aliens threatening to overtake Clint and Natasha fighting a few feet away from them, and bodies drop to the ground around them.
“Let’s go.” Steve’s in his space, nodding towards the side of the stage and Tony gives him a cold look, falling into step beside him.
“I’m not an easy man to love,” Steve says, voice low.
“What doesn’t he want us to know, Pepper?” Steve interrupted.
“Oh, I know!” Tony’s still talking. “Let’s go with pre-serum Steve. I always wanted to meet that feisty little guy.”
This is the closest Steve’s come to broaching the subject again, and Tony feels the familiar rush of endorphins that makes him want to head for the hills. It starts with a twist in his belly, his heart rate kicking up, an extra mouthful of saliva to swallow around before he speaks. He spends every waking moment thinking about what this is, what this means, what it could mean, but when it comes down to it, the words stay trapped behind the jail-cell bars of his molars.
Tony turns away with a heavy sigh and crosses the short steps towards the side table in the small sitting room, a half-empty bottle of scotch loosely capped beside overturned crystal glasses from the night before. Or maybe this morning, it’s hard to say.
Tony feels frustration clawing at the back of his mind. He’s already going to have to lose the arm, he knows that, and it feels supremely unfair that Steve can sit there and not say a word. As if it doesn’t matter. As if he doesn’t care. As if he really trusts Tony to—
“Stark, we really must go.” Strange crosses his arms over his chest.
“It’s the United Nations!” Tony cries. “How can you be condescending, Steve? They don’t want to collar us, they want to oversee us, and frankly, if people are as scared as we know they are, and this could change that… Maybe we need it.”
He’s not the man Steve once knew and his body reflects the toll the years have taken but Steve’s touching him as if he’s priceless and carved from marble, gasping into his mouth as he maps his skin like the New World. If Steve never stops touching him it’ll be too soon.
Steve’s lost almost a foot in height and Tony towers over him when he’s in this body. All of the muscle mass has melted away and his arms jut out from his sleeves like twigs that could snap in the breeze. All the definition in his face is gone now, so the sharp edges of Steve’s cheekbones and jaw jut out against skin stretched too tight. He looks hollowed out and gaunt, a shade paler than ivory.
Steve frowns, trying to assess what hurts, as if he has some sort of sixth sense to look at Tony and diagnose his injuries by instinct alone. That had always been Tony’s super power, knowing when something was wrong if Steve ducked out of medical or ignored wrapping wounds that he insisted would only heal on their own a few hours later.
Tony hollows out his cheeks and sucks harder, determined to push Steve over the edge right now, tears and all. He slides his tongue along the sensitive space under the head, pokes lightly into the slit, and lets Steve control the pace, taking him faster, deeper until Steve is gasping little breaths that sound suspiciously like sobs and the rolling of his hips becomes unsteady.
Steve’s got him up against the window, fucking into him like it’s his last night on earth and Tony loves it. There’s a smear of saliva spreading across the window from where Steve caught him off guard, pressing down on the back of his neck to hold him still against the cool glass while he kicked his legs further apart.
The US seems prepared to welcome Rogers and his merry band of fugitives back with open arms.
Steve’s apologized, more than once, and for more than just not telling Tony about his parents. No, he’s sorry for lying, hiding the truth for so long, not letting Tony in, blaming Tony when he shouldn’t have. Those are the things he said, which means he gets it. Genuinely, truly get it, and sees Tony for exactly as he is. Most of all, he listened, even when he might not have wanted to or liked what Tony was going to say.
Tony to watch, talking to him in that never-ending monologue and telling him what to do, how to stroke himself just right, the way that Tony would if they were there together.
“Fuck!” Tony reaches down to wrap his hand around his cock as he spurts off against the skyline, Steve chasing his release deep inside him with a broken moan that might’ve been Tony’s name. Pleasure ripples through him in waves as his body clenches and releases around the slick glide of Steve’s cock, pumping fresh layers of warmth and wet inside him.
He sighs. “Can we–would it be okay if we…?” That feels like enough for today and there’s too much to consider for him to listen to anymore. There’s nothing else he wants to say.
The shouting jostles his ribs and Steve winces, nausea turning circles in his stomach.
He took stumbling steps backwards, putting as much distance between himself and the bed as possible. It seemed that might be the only thing he could give Tony now.
“What did I say about being reckless?” Steve demands in a harsh whisper, plastering them together.
“All that’s well and good, Rhodey, but how exactly are we supposed to be a team again without trust? Without everyone on board?” Natasha aims right for the jugular, her question pointed and laced with a half dozen other questions she doesn’t voice.
“Ehh, I’ll eat anything.” Tony said.
– blatant rejection.
Bucky and Nat are in the kitchen later that morning when Tony skulks out of bed, thinking it’s late enough in the day that everyone will already be up and gone. It’s a rare morning off. Steve had cancelled their morning circuits the night before after Tony had drifted off in the warm circle of his arms.
Cock trapped between his body and the glass, Steve’s thrusts stutter as the grip on his waist constricts and rubs him up against the window pane again. The glass is slick with precome, sliding down towards the carpet. Steve forces his fingers into Tony’s mouth and Tony sucks, obedient, so far gone that Steve could do anything he wants.
As Steve drifted off again, the smell of rich, creamy coffee swelled around him. It was a beautiful thing they’d managed to find here and though Tony didn’t linger often in the mornings; he relished these small, soft moments hidden away from the world with his mates safely tucked against his side.
Steve staggers under the weight of his confession, or at least, Tony thinks he must because a second ago he was upright and now Tony’s on the ground. They’re both on the ground and the grass is wet and dew-drenched. Tony supposes that he should feel cold but his body doesn’t register it.
Sometimes Steve liked to think they were soulmates.
Steve huffs a little but smiles, tugging Tony in until he’s leaning against his chest, the car supporting both their weight. “I don’t really mind, you know. I’m glad you’re friends and I know that nothing would ever happen. You know that right? That I trust you, completely?”
“So that’s it then?”
“Enough chatter,” Steve says, trying to get a grip. Some team leader he is today.
He yanks Steve upright, driving up into him as Steve shifts in his lap, trying to accommodate the new angle. The hand on his throat steals the air from his lungs and his chest burns. Tony wraps around him at every angle and his vision blurs at the edges.
Bile rises up and Tony swallows back the burn.
And there wasn’t a single mark on him, the prick. Not that Tony hadn’t given it the old college try, biting down hard enough to make Steve grunt and squirm.
After, Tony was gentle and soothing, pulling him against his chest and easing a hand over his back until he was dozing off, satisfied yet somehow not fully sated.
How are they here again? How exactly has this happened? Tony’s all out of answers.
“We’re not talking about Steve right now,” Tony says, unmoving.
Steve laughs, a pure and genuine laugh. “So much better.” But he hesitates. “Tell me again you’re not going to regret this tomorrow.”
“Get away from me. Tony, I mean it—”
His little love-sick fantasy that tasted like marinara and fresh basil felt like it was going up in smoke.
“A year, Tony.” Steve shakes his head at the enormity of the loss. Then again, softer, “A whole year.”
Pepper clenches up again, and Anita gives them a nod that steals Tony’s breath away. From one moment to the next, there’s a baby in her arms. It’s not nearly as magical as Steve’s been led to believe, but it’s real and she’s theirs, so it’s enough. When Anita settles her on Pepper’s chest, crying with healthy, heaving sobs, Steve immediately curls the blanket around them, a hand over Pepper’s, over Tony’s.
It should enrage him, but maybe it’s not so horrible to have the power taken out of his hands. He can bear this if Tony wants him to, if he needs him to.
When he woke later in the morning, Tony was already gone off to the office, and he found himself tucked into the corner of the living room couch in the soft, late morning light.
A sob broke free from between Tony’s fingers and Steve could only watch, heart splintering in his chest as his stomach dropped and all of his errors came rushing forward. This wasn’t the reaction he had anticipated.
It had taken a long time for him to confide in Tony about Bucky when the relationship had been new, and longer still to admit that Bucky had also been an alpha. Tony had been curious and kind as the story spilled out of him for the first time, a hand held in his as he soothed him and reminded him that just because the world hadn’t caught up with them in the 40s, didn’t mean that their love wasn’t normal, beautiful, and real.
When Tony pulls his fingers back and wraps them around his throat, keeping up a steady pace as he drives into him, Steve moans and lets his head drop. If Tony pressed down just a shade harder, he’d even take away his ability to breathe and Steve could be completely at his mercy.
Of course, as if this weren’t already all different shades of fucked up.
“No, we didn’t!” Clint interrupted. “He said wagon wheels. The pretentious little Italian rich boy wants wagon wheels for dinner.”
Rhodey is quiet for a long moment, eyes searching his face for something Tony doesn’t understand. He shifts uneasily in his chair. No one sees through him quite like James Rhodes.
“Come on, fuck me,” Tony rearranges himself on the bed, shifting the back of his dress shirt up and over his hips as he feels Steve come to stand behind him, prick rubbing between the crack of his ass.
Tony’s body jostled and pitched forward under his hold as Steve curled over him, letting himself teeter on the edge of release, holding back his orgasm with the sheer force of his will. He didn’t want this to end. He wanted to crawl inside Tony and live there forever, a first line of defense against any threat that came their way.
So, what if it would be nice for Clint to have a new style of exploding errors for their target practice tomorrow? Sue him.
Peter becomes a member of the team with seamless ease. After classes and on the weekends, the young spider participates in training exercises on a near daily basis, sparring just as well as the rest of them, and earning a hundred bucks off the allegedly-famed Hawkeye and Falcon. He takes them both down with an effortless grace, surprising them with a combination of his new web fluid and the drone that neither of them had been anticipating.
“What’s it about, then?” His voice is a husky and Steve can feel that he’s losing his footing.
Steve sighs, watching the stark lights of the hospital room glitter off the icy glass. “How can you be so sure?”
“It looks like you’re not going to give me much of a choice,” Tony nods with a hint of sarcasm towards the closed door that Steve is still blocking with his oversized body.
The look Tony levels at him is the same as the day Ross had proposed the accords. The day everything fell to pieces with a small quirk of Tony’s eyebrows and the sardonic curve of his lips.
. It can always be worse.
He can’t come. He won’t.
This was the whole point, wasn’t it? Isn’t that why he’s here, now?
him how to live again; part of that teaching is finding limits so Steve never goes to the memorial. They didn’t talk about it, hardly even acknowledged it until the day after the ceremony; when Tony had said in tight words that they already had their own memorial. His eyes flickered to the photo of Peter, and Steve had wanted to sob.
Bucky barked out a laugh. “Not a prank, punk, but have you noticed that things have been going missing lately? Before Bruce left last week, he couldn’t find his fleece. Wanda couldn’t find her socks yesterday either.”
“Tony, I’m sorry.”
“Oh, no?” Tony asks. “Because you know, sometimes jealousy can be a good thing. Sometimes the jealousy can actually be really, really hot.” As he speaks, Tony’s mouth trails across Steve’s jaw until he bites down on Steve’s earlobe and sneaks a hand around his waist to grab his ass and roll up against him.
“Tony! We’ve talked about this. That’s not – I don’t want – I
Steve doesn’t know who the hell he is without the serum anymore.
In one memory, Steve tells him that he’s scared of what Tony might say, and then powers through anyways.
“Peter,” Tony warns, with a pointed finger.
He’s been a fool. Tony’s been an absolute fool because people never really change. Steve’s fed him just the right amount of bullshit, handed it over on a silver platter with one hand while the other weaves tricks and lies behind his back.
“Your divorce judgement is ready.” Pepper doesn’t beat around the bush when it matters, and he’s grateful for that, but it doesn’t stop Tony from closing his eyes and pressing his fingertips into his eyelids until explosions of colour appear.
“We thought you might say that.” Clint flops down on the couch and crosses his arms over his chest, looking like a cat rolling in the cream. “Show ‘em, Nat.”
“Love you.”
“By my calculations there was no immediate threat, and given the Captain’s inclination to, quote, ‘show you off to the city’—”
before everyone starts cackling.
Steve sighs, the exhale through his nose too loud and broken across the crappy connection. He’s probably pinching the bridge of it, closing his eyes, exasperated with Tony like usual.
“Yes. Yes, please! Hurry up!”
He shoved the thoughts away, yanking himself back from the inevitable slippery slope of imagining Tony’s voice. There were sick places in the back of his mind—that much he could admit—and he was ashamed that he kept indulging them.
, rushing in to scrub the hint of charred caramel from his nostrils. It didn’t click with Bucky’s muddled brain. How could this man continue to be so kind to him over and over again, after everything?
What more is there to say?
“Yeah, come on,” Tony urges, legs around his hips against as Steve finally shoves a slick finger into him, a bottle of lube rolling along the side of the bed as he gets to work making Tony’s eyes flutter and the tendons in his neck strain. “Steve, please. Hurry, okay? It’s fine, just—”
“Tony—”
Tony swallows his denial with another smooth, fiery mouthful and flips the phone open. Taking a deep breath and holding it tight in his chest, he presses dial on the only number that had ever been programming into the phone.
He lets out a shaky breath and stills Steve’s wandering hand, pressing it firmly to the centre of his chest.
Rushing through the door to the B.A.R.F. programming room, he tries to mentally prepare himself for whatever it is he might see there. Damn Steve for putting them both through this. Selfish. Always so fucking selfish.
“And what about you?” Steve says, tone rising as a flush of angry heat rushing into his cheeks. “What about you? You’re blameless in all of this, right?”
Tony’s never thought about it that way, the utter disrespect of Steve barging his way in all those years ago a familiar memory. But a nail in the coffin? A behaviour Tony had come to expect from Steve, that hadn’t surprised him in the slightest. Maybe it should have and a swell of pity and nausea rises in his stomach when he thinks about the Tony Stark he was all those years ago. A thing to be walked over.
It would have saved them so much pain and suffering if they had. If Steve had listened, then.
“Pepper misses you.” Steve says quietly. Tony’s face falters and his lips spasm into a tight line. “Morgan too. I visit with her when I can. She’s incredible.”
“Hey, what’s this?” Tony brushes away the tears creeping out of the corner of his eyes. “Talk to me.”
All the colour drains out of Bucky’s face. “Stark, I’m sorry–”
A steady stream of breathy gasps urges Tony on and he pulls off long enough to tongue the slit and swirl a wet circle around the head before he’s dipping back down and sucking at a brutal pace. Reaching above his head, he grabs onto Steve’s ridiculous purple tie and yanks, making Steve groan.
“–and just look them up and down, lick your lips and tell them how badly you want to fu–”
“Yes, Tony, it’s good,” Steve says, shaking his head as Tony beams down at him, panting. “This is more than good. This is something worth holding onto. Wouldn’t you say?”
He avoids Steve like the plague, except when they’re running full team drills. Which means he only has to see him daily for about three hours, depending on the set. It’s bearable at first, he dodges Steve’s soulful looks and ignores his name called down hallways.
It’s a lot of doom and gloom, centering around some megalomaniac who is convinced he knows what’s best for the entire galaxy. Tony wonders how many times Steve could punch the alien in the face before the end of the world.
The tapping goes on for a painfully long time and when it stops and Tony hazards a glance at the door, Steve is sitting there, back pressed to the window panes with his head hanging in his hands.
Steve tries again. “You were–”
They whispered to him, singing along his nerve endings and exploding his synapses.
A reflective orange light caught Steve’s attention and, on the nightstand, Steve clocked a small bottle. Sleeping pills.
Was this his fault?
“Because I was–”
Tony asks, stepping into Memory-Steve’s space and placing both hands on his shoulders, anger dissolving into concern.
Steve emphatically shook his head, his emotions splattered across his face, beaming with a love and pride that made Tony twitchy but pleased.
“Don’t do anything reckless.”
“What about you and me? Think we can figure this out?”
He apologizes later on and Steve, jaw gritted, actually says the words “we’re far from perfect.”
“Yeah, yeah,
After all, it’s nice to mix it up from time to time.
the way that he needed. Then bringing down the gavel and reinstating his rule into law all over again.
you want to laze around? Come on, there are people waiting.”
The thrill of what it might mean to let himself be weak explodes in a shower of sparkling colours behind his eyes and challenge rises in the back of Steve’s throat. “I can take whatever you’ve got, Stark.”
They look so pleasantly domestic like this, both still in sleepwear, relaxed and content. For a moment he wonders if maybe… but no, he’ll ask later when Steve is there for safety purposes. He’s got some self-preservation left in him.
“Not saying you’re wrong, Tones. You know I’m not. But at some point, this whole thing… it needs to stop being about blame. Don’t you think?”
Steve blinks.
“Not much to tell, really. He broke into my house and stood in the dark for a couple hours until I got home. It was very Slender-Man meets fangirl stalker, really. I felt unsafe. Plus, I think he told me I was arrogant to think I was the only superhero in the world, or something like that,” Tony chuckles lightly.
“I guess I just expected—”
It feels like the time to be
the devastating push to be something better, something more. He hates himself for being so invested in Steve figuring this out.
Somehow, that’s worse. Tony, loving Steve more than he can bear or ever hope to understand. And with a damned fucked up way of showing it. Shame layers into Steve’s grief, the last stone that crushes him into oblivion even though Steve can’t remember whispering
What kind of ludicrous game was Ross playing at, anyhow? Word of Tony’s marriage ending had been front-page news for weeks, and here they were, prepared to stand together before benefactors and diplomats claiming that the Avengers were united and Steve and Tony had reconciled enough to bring everything into place.
During one extremely unfortunate bout of thorough fair, Tony isn’t totally paying attention during a morning set.
“Lay off him, Clint.” Steve grunted with a smile.
“Come on, doll, let’s hear it. You know how I like to see that pretty blush.”
Bucky saunters over behind Steve’s seat, and gives him a whack to the back of the head, hard enough that Tony thinks it should hurt, but Steve doesn’t even flinch.
again.
The elevator takes him down in silence and as he steps out, his eyes prickle again at the sound of AC/DC radiating from the workshop, so loud it could rattle the spotless glass. Tony is there with his back turned to the windows, a soldering tip in one hand and an Iron Man gauntlet balanced precariously in the other.
They’re just on vacation, a few steps removed from their responsibilities, and the sun is hot and bright in the sky. When they get home, the team will be there waiting for them, and everything will be back to normal.
“Nothing.”
Beyond incredulous, Tony scoffs and shakes his head with wide eyes, letting his voice drop softer. “You’re a fucking mess.”
Steve grunts into Tony’s mouth, pinning Tony between his body and the tractor, letting Tony slam back without care. It’s rough and vicious, but Tony’s nails are still biting into his flesh as if he’s out for Steve’s blood and if this is what Tony needs—
“He asked me to marry him. We’re—we’re getting married.”
“Can’t help it.”
But Tony won’t be here to see it.
Tony’s going to stop this. He will, it’s just been so long and kissing Steve is like tasting sunshine, warming him from the inside out. He’s going to stop any minute now. Their divorce certificates are sitting a stone-throw away and here Tony is prepared to fuck his husband—ex-husband—all over again as if nothing’s happened.
Whatever the reason, he stays, eyes locked with Steve’s stormy blues that give him a window into the squalling emotions underneath.
“We stick together,” Tony said, fierce rage burning bright behind the brown-black mixture of his eyes. “We stick together,
“Bucky, now. Stop teasing. Fucking mate me, alpha. Come on.” Tony prodded him sharply in the ribs with a foot and Bucky growled at him, a challenge.
They haven’t talked about it.
Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s neck but not before guiding Steve’s hands to his hips. And then they’re swaying together, everything else bleeding into the background while Tony plays with strands of his hair and lets his gaze drop down to Steve’s mouth.
“That enough talking, sweetheart? Because I need to fuck you. I need to fuck you right now Steve, please say I can.”
Steve spent the rest of the day worrying over it.
But when he had thought about it… he’d allow himself only the briefest moment. Quick, self-indulgent fantasies in the shower when everything had still been raw and painful, only a few times in their early days back at the Compound. It had been cathartic, he’d told himself, healing the aching parts of him torn open after he’d broken his partner’s heart, and found only a shell of his old friend and lover.
The new apartment wasn’t terrible, it just wasn’t home.
It’s a small weakness that Tony’s wearing them at all, but Steve had loved them—something about fashion in the forties and seeing a part of that on the person tying him to the future—and Tony loves Steve, regardless of whether or not he should.
“Flatterer. The history books all say you weren’t any good with the dames. Guess they were wrong.”
“Fine, then take mine off instead.” He gives Steve a cheeky wink and together they get Tony out of his pants, shoving them down around his ankles so Steve can cup him through the thin fabric of his underwear. The underwear isn’t long for this world though, and Steve shoves them down after his pants before he scoots to the edge of the bed and settles one hand on Tony’s hip and wraps the other around the base of his cock, brushing the tip with his lips. Tony gasps and tries not to close his eyes because Steve is looking up at him, mouth parted and teasing along his cockhead, a cheeky look on his face that drives Tony wild.
“Mr. Parker is not of age for gambling. It would be ill-advised to expose his developing mind to such a risk,” Vision interrupts them, and Peter’s eyes go impossibly wide. As if he isn’t an enhanced, radioactive spider superhero who’s already fought Captain America and will quickly be preparing to defend earth against an unknown alien invasion the same as the rest of them.
“You said we aren’t going to be those people.”
With gritted teeth, Tony forces himself to meet Steve’s eye. Steve looks destroyed.
, and more importantly,
He tries to insist on sleeping in another room, where his nightmares can only hurt himself, because he wakes up screaming Tony’s name and admits that he sees Tony snapping and smells the way his flesh was melting from the bone when he’d gotten Tony’s body into his arms and carried him to safety, limp and lifeless.
“We love it, Tony.” Steve added, blue eyes filled with a deep earnestly that made Tony squirm. “It would have been fine if it had never happened, you know that. But since it has… this is amazing. Thank you.”
