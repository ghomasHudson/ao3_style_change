where it’d be. He hated it that his first experience with love had to be in a hidden crumbling building in a hidden crumbling town and not eating ice cream in the mall like every other teenager’s. But then again, he kind of loved that they had found this secret spot in the middle of nowhere and made it their own.
deepen the hole in his stomach. The way he avoided Cas’ eyes, despite being seated right in front of him,
And it was true. For all his illiterate-ness, Dean was a genius at math. Where Cas would spent 20 minutes and two calculators, trying to figure out how to split their restaurant bill, what with taxes and tip, and everyone ordering different things, Dean would do the math in his head up to the cent. And Castiel would be lying if he said he didn’t find that
This ended up being more angsty than I anticipated. Balthazar cameo! he's kind of a douche tho, I don't know why.
” Castiel corrects him and Dean can’t help the smile on his lips at the past tense. “He was my friend… I think. We were also lovers.”
He gulped, and looked up. Castiel was gone. He felt the strange urge to talk to him, just to see what would happen… But as a got a text from his dad asking what time was he arriving on Lawrence, he settled for deleting the app, it was better that way.
“Look, no relationship you get into in the future is going to be like the one we had, or the one you had with Lissa…” Jesse said, and when Dean looked at him frowning, he continued “small town, of course I know she cheated on you. Sorry about that, by the way. My point is: you can’t live in fear things are going to turn out bad. Ask him out.”
Castiel's head tilted to the side as he stared at Dean with a slight frown and -when had he gotten this close to Dean? Had he always been this close? Air started to feel thicker and Dean fought his deepest instincts to not stare at the other boy's lips, not for too long at least.
much, anyway. So he didn't ssee the slightly panicked face the boy in the trench coat had made before he sat at the edge of the bed and started to read in silence.
at him. And he secretly gets angry at himself for how angry he got at Cas. He just got treated like shit by that other dude, Dean shouldn’t be adding more wood to the fire by also treating him like shit.
Dean hurried to open the door, using it as an excuse to hide the red rapidly creeping up his cheeks.
By the end of the summer, he's only going on Grindr once a week and he's able to look at Jo in the eyes again –his own blue pair finally clear from the fog and the redness of the previous month. She gives him a knowing look and turns her attention back to the screen, where her and Charlie are killing aliens with laser guns.
I apologize. I don’t understand what might have given you that impression. I will try to be more aware of my surroundings.
Ten minutes later, a busty little red riding hood is twerking at Benny, and Dean is fighting to get the barman’s attention again. He reckons it is a little pathetic that that is the only man (or person, for that matter) whose attention he is trying to get tonight. What is the point in being bi if he isn’t able to score on an open bar night? He takes out his phone, sighing when we stills sees no response.
bullshit he’d been lying to himself about for years, that he forgot to notice the important things. And the important things weren’t memorizing each other’s coffee order, nor hanging around an absurd amount of time together. Those were superficial things. Just like how good a bit of stubble looked on Dean’s face or how he always teased Cas about his heritage.
I know. I never understood the appeal in sharing poorly taken pictures of genitalia. Is that supposed to arouse my interest?
"Oh, that's more than just okay, Cas. It's awesome." Dean hears himself say before he can process what's happening and he's glad he subconsciously switched into flirting mode and isn't drooling anymore, because
"Yes, we should get started on the project. I will e-mail you some references we could use." A beep came out of the pocket of his sweatpants, Castiel took out his phone, read a message, sighed and said "It appears my roommate's girlfriend has fallen asleep and it is now safe for me to return."
“Oh, come on, Jo! We just arrived, you gonna ditch us already?” said Dean, a bit annoyed that she seemed so eager to leave to the one ambience he couldn’t go to.
Yet Castiel kept sitting in front of Dean every week in class. And, sure, he usually sat on the same spot: third row with Charlie on his right side. But then again, that one time Charlie sat on the left chair and Dean on the right one, Castiel looked a bit puzzled when he entered the classroom and didn't see Dean on his usual spot. He still sat in front of him anyway. And Dean tried not to make a big deal out of it, because, really,
going to fuck up if you keep this up for too long, Dean-o" she paused to look pointedly at Dean "And also... I mean, is this thing you're doing completely immature and could be solved in a civilized manner by having a 10 minute conversation with the guy? Yes. Hell yes.” at this, Dean rolled his eyes at her. “But... I know you, and you are not going to do that because.. ”
What if his friends were right? What if he had been alone for too long? What if the reason he kept having meaningless one-night stands and developing crushes on impossible assholes was that he had forgotten how to actually be with someone? The thought made him a little bit sad, not that he’d ever said it out loud, but he thought…
fine. He won't die from heartbreak. Whatever. He met someone cool once, he can meet someone cool again. Perhaps this is for the best. He'll save himself the embarrassment of seeking something serious with Cas and having to explain the whole catfishing-but-I-wasn't-actually-catfishing-you situation.
on Dean, on the deep green of his eyes and the black of his leather jackets, of his Impala, of the smiles he sometimes dropped too quickly, when he thought no one was watching.
When the trench-coated boy left, Charlie couldn't understand why Dean wanted to kill her. He didn't care to tell her, either. For once, he would like to know how he himself felt about something before baring it open for his friends' scrutiny. He still went out with her, Jo and Benny for dinner that night. He could use the change of air.
It takes every little string left in Dean's self control to not drop off to his knees and take it in his mouth.
A little voice in the back of Dean's head told him he was oversharing, but he didn't care. He was tired and Cas was here and he couldn't help but be openly honest with him about this. The other boy just looked at him with his head tilted to the right as a smile slowly crept to his lips.
He sees Jo a couple of times over the summer, and makes a conscious effort not to ask her about Dean. Sure, he still cries when he sees the Facebook photo where a smiling Dean was tagged by his mother. And he still 'likes' said picture, even though Dean hasn't spoken to him in a month now. But he still has
And with that they all turned they attention to the series again. But Dean’s mind kept thinking, what if…
It had been Love at Second Sight. At least for him. And he often wondered whether or not Dean had felt something the first time they met because why else would have he called and asked for a coffee? Castiel did not obsess over that thought for months. Not too much, anyway.
That’s what Chuck had asked Jo as they left Dean in the Starbucks table and, Cas cringed at the thought,
He feels Cas' body relax under his arm and lean closer to him, as he stands straight and stares down at the blonde guy, who gives Dean a once-over before huffing and saying:
!" Dean was particularly defensive about his historical crushes. Last time Benny dared to say something about Vivien Thomas he had regretted it for a week.
was happening at all. Even if it was just a friendship, he knew his freshman-year-self would have died if he knew he could one day have coffee with Dean on a regular basis and hug him and touch him, and just...
If someone had told Dean Winchester that morning that he was going to spend the night at Castiel Novak’s dorm room, he would have probably passed out. If that someone had also told him that all he would do in there was talk to the guy, he would have been a little disappointed, but he would've thought that made sense.
Dean is a nerd, which is why he's rocking out to Mamma Mia on his way back to his room after a long day when he bumps into... someone.
Eventually, he stops going on Dean's social media profiles to torture himself. He also stops looking for his username on the views of his instagram stories, and he texts so many random dudes that their conversation gets hidden beneath a sea of unsaved numbers. And, eventually, the urge to scroll down and re-read their old conversations until he falls asleep, also subsides.
Although, in order for an actual friendship to form, I would need to have more information about you, D.
He and Jesse hadn’t had a friendly break-up. At all. He had ‘pulled-off a Dean’ and ruined it by choosing his family and his status over his feelings and Jesse’s, breaking the poor boy’s heart in front of all of their friends. But that had been in high school, Dean was a different person now –or so he’d like to think. Besides, Jesse had forgiven him, somehow, Dean didn’t understand how, and often wondered if he would have been capable of forgiving something like that.
“Jesus! You’re pissed. What on earth did the guy do to you?” Jo asks, grinding as she gets the popcorn bag from the microwave and serves it in a bowl.
They were at Cas' dorm, drinking cheap vodka with Jo and Ash, and Pam, and Chuck. Cas was trying not to think too much about when he'd started to spend more time with Dean's friends than with his own, when Chuck looked at his phone and read the tour dates the band had announced that morning.
“We didn’t match... that’s not… that’s not how it works.” Dean quipped as he made a mental note to remind Charlie not to share Dean’s personal life with her girlfriend.
When he laid in bed that night, full, tired and happy, he checked his phone one last time. He had a new text from a contact he hadn’t seen on that screen for a long time.
“Don't sweat it, kid. Besides, it's kind of entertaining. Now that Dr. Sexy is over forthe year, I need some new drama in my life” she shrugged, and they both laughed.
“So he’s a jerk, so what? Let it go, Dean-o, he’s not the love of your life, you’ll have to find another” Jo says, shrugging
he thinks. He might be a little too drunk to be making this decision. But right now, with Castiel staring up at him with those big blue eyes and those cat ears and that bow tie... Tomorrow he will probably hate himself for doing it this way. But right now, his brain has left the building and the smell of Castiel's sweat is drowning his lungs and his dick is making all his decisions for him. So Dean leans in and kisses him.
“Is that… Do you think that’s why he wanted us to leave? So he could have a date with his bald grandpa?”
Three strong knocks on his door and Charlie's voice calling his name brought him back to reality before he even noticed it.
frustrated mind. Because here he was -the dude he'd been fantasizing about the entire semester, he was right
and the warmness of Castiel's body against his, make Dean almost forget all the awful things he has always thought about himself.
It was laughing like an idiot staring at his phone screen and being unable to listen to Muse’s Starlight without automatically thinking about Dean, and waking up with a smile on his face because he knew he had a new text from Dean waiting for him when he opened his eyes. And he felt bliss. So he held on to that, and forgot about everything else.
And no, the warmth that fills his body when Dean Winchester looks up at him from his football practice and smiles that wide, open smile Cas loves so much, has
“WHAT?” Dean’s eyes leave Castiel’s back to fix on his friend’s face “No, I don’t” he lowers the tone of his voice to make sure Castiel can’t hear them “Shut up, Charlie”.
But another night goes by, another abrupt awakening in a pool of sweat. Another bad dream. Another day without him.
Dean put his phone in his pocket and made himself a sandwich. Maybe he had gone too far. After all, he didn’t know the guy and they had only started texting this morning. But the anonymity the app granted him filled him with the courage he lacked in real life. He couldn’t help being kind of a jerk himself. When his phone buzzed against his leg, he smiled to himself before taking it out and flopping onto the bed to read the new text he had gotten.
When he didn't hear the familiar Grindr ping coming from his phone the next morning, he told himself Cas probably was still sleeping, or in class. The dude was double-majoring, for fuck's sake. He had every right to be busy.
But their past, Cas' depression, his drug abuse on the weekends when he didn't hang out with Dean, the reason the blond was so tense around his father, or that he always changed the subject when asked about Benny, or the fact that Cas was the only one of his siblings that left New York, that he hardly ever called his parents or even talked about them. The
Sure, they were together almost all of their time, and they were texting each other constantly, to the point where Cas would every day, without a fail, wake up to either a good-nigh or a good-morning text from Dean, and that always made him start his day off with a smile. Because he kept remembering what it felt to see Dean walking through campus, his hand in Benny’s, so far away from him. And the fact that he had now been on his crush-for-two-years’ bed (with all of his clothes on, obviously, but
"Hey... where are you? Castiel's already here!" Dean tried to keep his voice as calmed and quiet as possible.
He plugged-in his phone to the charger on the other side of the room, turned off the lights and called it a night.
Some song with a loud bass and high-pitched auto-tuned female vocals was blasting through the giant speakers as Dean and his friends made their way throw the crowd under the changing and colorful lights of the strobe. After fifteen minutes dancing in a crowd of sexy nurses and ripped-off comic-book characters, Jo started to seem uncomfortable. Dean thought it was probably the heels. He’d told her it wasn’t the best idea to wear them if she intended on dancing all night, but she hadn’t listened. However, after a while of her not complaining, he decided that it might not have been the shoes, and asked what was wrong.
"Yes." the other boy nodded and squinted a little. "You seem surprised to see me. We did agree on meeting today, didn't we?"
Once he revealed himself as "D", the physical interactions had practically stopped between them. Sure, he had held Castiel's hand as they walked into Hell, but he also did that with Benny and his other friends in order to not get lost in the crowd. But of course, Benny didn't start grinding his hips against Dean's seductively once they'd reached their destination, the way Cas is doing right now. Dean tests the waters by placing his forearms on Castiel's shoulders. He is rewarded by the most intense look by those blue eyes as the corner of Castiel's mouth turns upwards in a smile. Fuck. He wants to kiss him so badly. He wants to take him to the bathroom and fuck him then and there. But he also doesn't want to just be a quicky in a dirty club's bathroom. He wants more. He's always wanted more for him and Cas. He looks up from his eyes and above his head and stupid
at a club. But he has to smile as well because, damn if the way he argues isn't cute as heck. They start dancing again and, okay, the fact that Cas insists on singing the lyrics in French on his ear? Not fair. It also doesn't help that he's dancing dangerously close for Dean to keep fighting the bulge forming in his pants and, as his head starts to clear up he catches himself wondering whether or not it'll be alright if he just kissed Cas again.
"You know about these matters," Cass said with some relief. "They seem to understand each other so well, I forget that humans tend to. Dean was always self-conscious about his lack of education, so I am glad for him to be enriching himself." He thought no more about it.
"Don't let me see how terrible I look," he begged as Cas wiped the makeup off his face because Dean’s body was still scarcely obeying him.
Castiel's thoughts ﬂowed insistently at Dean, recalling him to the Thanksgiving dinner at Bobby's. "I'm not participating if you're still badmouthing me," Dean said to the table.
He was the monster, more than anything he'd ever hunted. “Please love me for who I am,” the black bear said.
The guests were ferried in separately for maximum discretion, but it was either the unusual number of them—almost twenty—or the imposed fast during the last two weeks, because everyone was simmering with an odd, dark excitement as they politely sampled Etienne's hors d'oeuvres, nodding at his reminiscences about foods eaten years ago.
Left to scope out the grounds for signs of demon activity, Dean received the news of the AV guy's stubbornness with resignation.
The only thing Sam could fault his brother for was that his solitary walks tended to take him into dark, uninhabited parts of town, but that only meant that the odd mugger would have a very unpleasant surprise should he tangle with the sober veteran hunter.
"Indeed, I have been a model soldier. But unfortunately I was given an assignment that I simply cannot complete. Not for any scruples on my part, I assure you," the angel clariﬁed.
Suddenly Dean's anguish was wiped clean. He felt nothing because he expected nothing. Remiel nudged the ray of dryness in the direction of Darius.
"No, here, let me show you a little bit of how it's supposed to be," the man Dean said in one of those warm impulses he was prone to. "If I was with a chick, I'd take off my shirt," he said, following suit.
"Let me handle this one," Dean had told Sam, who accepted that they had no badge that would give them jurisdiction anyway.
"So this is Hell," Dean amended. "But, like, deluxe Hell, and you get here by being a lesson for the entire universe in What Not to Do and taking a stop off in a sleazy club?
"He's a pig, I may be a heartbreaker, but my father taught me better than that." And to distract from the warm feeling Cas' protectiveness gave him for a change, Dean said,
"Miss Harriet gave me some good ideas already, thank you, but don't be surprised if I call you up some day asking for more help."
Dean didn't like knowing that there was going to be somebody sitting behind him in almost every class watching his every move.
Roberto Vasquez was the sort of man who referred to one of his tomato plants, "una mata de tomates," as if he were talking about a woman, with an emphasis on the feminine gender of the word. To his father, a simple farmer, life was marvelously complex, a seething riot of life and death coming together in ways best summed up by the gendered Spanish language.
Back to back, they slashed in the darkness. Occasionally they felt some kind of contact, a thing brush against their face or press against their blade. But because they couldn't see, it might have been a giant or an ant. The lack of speciﬁcity meant they were fearing hundreds of things at once.
"As for you, darling." Valac fussed with the red hair some more with a smile he quickly wiped off his face. The demon stared around the circle. "You tell Castiel what you like, I don't care. He lost this one long ago. There was never any going back."
"The same is true of Dean, I'm afraid," Cas said. "I can feel him where he is being kept. He's very weak. Any further exposure to the demonic side of things could be fatal." The angel could feel a very faint trace of Dean's presence. His soul resounded with relief.
It was pretty fantastic, Dean thought, relaxing in the new arms of the evening. It was all Cas, of course it was the Cas he felt safe enough with to melt into his very being. But it was equally true that the sweet angel was making Dean's body mold to stranger after stranger—hell, he was right in the middle of it doing the molding. If Cas could grasp how incredibly hot this was, and Dean doubted it, he seemed to think it was better than darker alternatives.
Dean's brain was whirring. "Somebody's going through a bunch of stoned hippies and picking off their souls while they're riding the peace train? What about the bodies?"
"Actually, Adeline, our speciﬁc constitutions require a lot of liquid," Etienne said from his chair, glass of wine in hand..
Sam had learned to hold onto the smallest scrap of something good. He undressed and got into bed, glad for good dreams going on for the time being in the other bed.
Dean took a sip. "If it can't be said in a double entendre, best not to expect Balthazar to say it," he agreed.
Dean had never wished he knew Mongolian and could take the driver's seat more fervently than he did while listening to Cas converse with the Khan. All he could do was examine his reddish hair and blue eyes set off by sun-weathered features and prominent cheekbones. Inside his body he was paralyzed.
Dean took his friend up on his offer to teach him how to play guitar but proved a hopeless student. Surprisingly, Davin refused all his offers to teach him how to ﬁght.
Dean wondered what it was like to stand on a hill on a clear night way back before there were satellites and cell towers and all the noise he had to tune out when he tried to tune in.
"Since none of you can explain the process properly, it seems we are at an impasse—quite deliberately engineered on your parts," the lead angel fumed. "Castiel, could you be any vaguer?"
"We've been doing our best to keep it in the family when a hunter goes down in the line of duty," Bobby said. "Eddie says there's no hard feelings about that ﬁrst spell of yours not working out."
For Dean, the one thing that he, the hunter well-versed in demons and monsters and magic, the one thing that was truly unthinkable was being loved.
The technical elements of this were Cecil's domain, and he had them rehearsing details like the chants needed to respond to Spider Woman until they wanted to scream.
“Well, she should have just ignored it, because she set it free and all hell broke loose on the demigod for reneging on the deal. The details are a little scanty in these notes, but I think it was actually kind of like that time I told you about when Sam and I negotiated between Mr. and Mrs. Rain: a little symbolic this and that in the right place, and order is restored."
"You were saying," Grace prompted from where she ﬂuttered by his ear. "It's a different sort of Heaven?"
Then came the solitary times when he was forced to dry out so he could soak up more smacks again. Hell had this sort of thing ﬁgured out down to the exact science so as to make best use of their torturers' time.
He stretched out on the futon. "I'm telling you Sam, we've been doing improv our whole lives, showing up and acting like FBI agents or whatever, and what have we found—that it doesn't matter if we really carry a legit badge, if we act like it, we do the job. And not just their job, our job, because we're the ones who show up and have the experience to face what really needs facing."
"A stiff whisky for my friend, and another glass of wine for me," Paulette said, getting up from her chair. "I'm going to go powder my nose," she said signiﬁcantly.
Parts of Dean's consciousness were being taken over by some dark, syrupy feeling as if he were looking through black amber.
"Oh my god, what I wouldn't give to live here," he moaned internally. "What's the monster situation like here?"
Persephone was only supposed to spend some time in the underworld, not forever, was the last clear thought Etienne and Dean shared.
While he averted his eyes from the burst of light brought about by Balthazar's use of the knife on his angelic form, the demon continued, "I've often seen it as a cooperation between departments, more than a head-on collision, our two fronts. Instead of steak knives, we're competing for souls, but keeping each other sharp in the process."
They both started at the ﬁrst endearment between them since their reunion, and a slight ripple went through the crowd as well. Dean wasn't used to being around a bunch of beings that vibrated at a similar frequency.
"No more time to celebrate, boys, this was going to be your last lesson regardless. It's been nice having you." She pushed them out of the hall and into a dark corner outside. "There's been some developments while you've been here."
"I don't care who it is," Dean said.The random man Castiel chose was merely an obstacle that Dean quickly slid his way around to get to the essence of the angel he loved, for that essence to shape his own body.
The thing wearing the photographer smiled. “You didn't catch even the whiff of the demonic from Barry here, did you?"
Valac made it all stop for a little while. Gradually, his mind stopped speaking to himself so pointedly, the thoughts coming from all over as if from outside his brain like the few times he'd smoked pot.
All of these qualities had all been a natural part of Cas' increasing humanity, but he did everything he could during his torture and inquisition sessions to reinforce the idea that the process made him weak. And above all, that the whole thing had been involuntary.
Dean stepped around and some people selling trail mix and bead necklaces. "That's the thing, it's not the sixties. We know better now!"
That the Dean in his own reality was anything but functional didn't interfere with the transferred respect in Remiel's mind.
The angel had had close contact with a few other humans and knew them to always be hoping for a personal savior, to a one.
There was no mistaking that they were talking about the angel with the sardonic sense of humor that Etienne remembered with exquisite clarity in Hell. And though the demons assured him that administrative mistakes did happen and angels did come to correct them, his angel, his Balthazar never came to rescue him.
"All I know is they keep trucking it in and leaving it for us along with a fat wad of cash," the guy, who seemed kind of drunk, slurred cheerfully.
The red hair dye washing down the drain was a visual conﬁrmation that he was getting clean in some way, but he wasn't comforted at all.
What was his old lover doing? Were he and his Dean able to fulﬁll their roles in their apocalypse and save their Sam? Was his counterpart able to forgive Adonis for messing around behind his (presumed dead) back?
"Gina has a really good reason not to celebrate the colonization of her land," Sam said. "I think your turkey tastes even better the next day, so it's perfect that we're going to do it all over again tomorrow."
"Except these aren't eagle feathers, so do you think we should be concerned about this Sun-god noticing that?"
People from the Cause had tried to rope him into their schemes for shoring up defenses against a Hell that was currently without clear leadership, but that part of Dean had died. He was sure of it. The last bit of himself that pretended to know what he was doing expired the day Heaven sent him an ofﬁcial message—a couple of days after the big ﬁght.
"Can you turn your emotions off for one second?" Domenic snapped. "We all know that some angels have fraternized, but even beyond the music they've developed recently, certain things have been noticed."
"I've been seeing this hypnotist – she guarantees she can teach me how to chew food again. She calls it a trauma, but I know I got grossed out by eating with someone and can't forget about it. I took a bite of an apple and chewed it OK but I still felt like I was drowning when it was going down."
There were no ﬂies on the ancient Mongolians when it came to sex, Sam learned in the time it took for Dean to reappear.
After Cas closed the door he said, "Are you laughing because I made a fool of myself in front of that woman?"
He looked around. This was the kind of place you could get killed for making a pass at a guy, so he was relieved that he didn't have to worry about that possibility.
"Well, that depends. I like a guy who knows his wine—usually he knows a thing or two about other subjects," she said, heading them towards the east side.
"This is what I mean, Thursday." The nickname worked its usual magic. "You like, pounce on the slightest thing as either proof that things are going well, or things are going to shit. I never thought I would be giving anyone lessons in being laid back, but you've got to accept that I'm different every day, and believe it or not, you are too. Even if you weren't shaped by new experiences, you have trillions of old ones in the hopper, waiting to come up."
The sounds that been crackling in that empty room died away, and the angel stared at it as if he were holding a snake. He threw the article far from him and did something Dean didn't even think he could do: he retched.
He ﬁnally saw his pants on the other side of the room folded on a chair. That was strange. Sam had long since given up on picking up after him. Oh well, maybe he'd had a ﬁt of tidiness overtake him while he was wasted last night. Because he remembered being drunk and getting called out by that waitress.
The angel appeared at Dean's bedside where he was curled up in the fetal position on a bed at Bobby's, and made the formal announcement. The Heavenly ban on the human halves of the Nephilim couples was lifted. He could come by any time he liked, as long as he gave ample notice so that Castiel could arrange to be in some other sector of Heaven from his ex-beloved.
He watched a teenage girl with pigtails holding a small ﬁre in one hand, and a tiny waterfall in the other. Every time she mixed them together, a different thing popped out.. She had a small pile of random objects—a pink carnation, a loaf of bread, a small yellow bird-and kept repeating the exercise, her face full of wonder.
When Dean took a deep breath before speaking and grabbed his side in pain, Sam knew they couldn't sweep it under the rug, which was the Winchester way.
Dean opened his mouth and Bobby stopped him. "And those so-called messages from Cas don't look like they're ﬁt to share with the class."
"No! I told you about that deva who was squashing people together starting with a touch. Stay a step back! Tell her you're not interested!"
“Our angel troops have found that Hell’s forces were curiously ineffective. It seemed that no one could follow orders and there was constant confusion among the ranks,” one of his informants told the leader.
The saline solution he habitually carried back from his drinking days. It helped him on many occasions look much less hung over then he really was.
Castiel uttered many psalms of contrition for the danger he had exposed his beloved to. He should have known that there was no such thing as privacy in Heaven. He did his best to push all the desires and worries from his mind. It was surprisingly difﬁcult for a seasoned soldier like himself.
The tiny creatures, which looked like black, ugly hags smaller than a penny, were milling about aimlessly where the brothers had been ﬁghting them.
"So you DO have a technology!" The demon stopped collecting his tools. "How do you do it, and why are you telling me?"
"I don't mean to minimize his pain," Etienne nodded sadly. "We ﬁght—oh, what those walls of our room have heard! My Balthazar was always different from the blank-faced angels, I think. You should have seen the uniform he appeared to me in, the ﬁrst time I saw him in my dream! He thought a soldier’s garb would best explain his mission to me, but it was fairly obvious he was much more than a uniform, though the buttons and braid suited him just ﬁne."
"Actually it's a lot less than that—between two and six percent in the US. I'm seeing a lot of redheads, and most of them do not look like henna."
"There are two vessels that look likely for me in Europe," Cas said shyly. "I've talked to them both in their dreams, and they're willing. Which would you prefer to negotiate the entry for me?"
“I didn't touch him or anything: we shared a nice moment, the three of us. We were friends, that's all."
The woman, whose name was Josie Slick, was the local sheriff and had enough clout to eject a couple of complaining voices out of the sheriff station with just a look.
"I do enjoy possessing someone myself, so you are going to be a rare treat, Dean," Valac said. "You had quite the wall built up around yourself, but Barry managed to catch you in an unguarded moment. Well done."
"You couldn't have had that good of a time last night," was what he heard from Sam's bed. "You were all tucked in with the covers up to your chin like a good boy when I came in at almost 5. You're lucky I didn't bring anyone home."
"We have a lot of things to do," Castiel reminded him and toweled them off without further distraction. They emerged in a clean shirt and made sure to say hello to the receptionist. Shortly they were in Mesopotamia.
Even Cas burst out laughing. "Men have always had their ways," Castiel said with a formal understatement that suddenly reminded Dean of when they were ﬁrst getting together.
No one could jam his angelic workings, or his human ones, for that matter. Etienne could feel his lover through their bond, and nothing was stronger than that truth. He could feel their link vibrating through him like a tuning fork, righting any demon-sponsored confusion.
He didn't know what he expected was behind the curtain in Heaven, but the workings of power were mostly a lot of back and forth about details he couldn't follow. He knew from Cas how important it was to get Heaven out of its traditional focus on war. But the brain fog that used to fall on him while in school kept him wishing he had a knife and a desk he could carve AC/DC logos into, always a good way to pass the time.
It took ages, but ﬁnally his request for another review was granted, and the administrators found some bureaucratic term equivalent to "collateral damage" that found reason to pardon Etienne. Balthazar was disappointed that they hadn't found him at fault, that no one was at fault, but he raced down to Hell to rescue the man's soul.
"When it comes down to it, we think more in terms of giver and receiver," another had said, fresh from a torture session that left all his virtues limp. "With so little communication forthcoming from above, angels have forgotten what it is like to be—inspired--from without."
Dean had no idea how he was supposed to feel about that, and it was even more confusing to have his emotions pulled in a hundred directions under the cold gaze of the new head angel. He also couldn't help but feel that this conversation was exactly what Cas had been afraid would go on between them.
"I was skeptical at ﬁrst, I admit. It seemed a rather unexpected end to Cas' obsession with the man, but you were right—we had to be sure it wasn't the start of something larger. Would you like to—question—this one ﬁrst? You do have such a talented touch."
"There is a lingering bad feeling about the last angel-like creature throwing his lot in with Hell," Balthazar said drily.
"I don't know what self-help book you got a hold of, buddy, but what you and Dean are doing through is normal,” Bobby continued. Or it was until Dean was made ﬁgurehead of Hell. For Dean's sake I hope he can listen to whatever excuse you have for having stopped trying, other than your foolish pride, but I'm not sure I'm even interested anymore."
The redhead-for-a-night Dean grabbed three beers on the way in. "And it makes you look like Raggedy Andy on 'roids," he snapped.
It was relaxing, Dean thought, to listen to Castiel speak to him at length in this private way. He felt the rocking motion of even the things he didn't understand well. "So humans have always been stupid?" He didn't know if that made him feel better or worse about his time.
"Whatever do you mean?" Balthazar replied as he watched the wine do its golden work on his hostess. He liked to watch someone like her, who looked like a column sculpted out of a single block of dark marble, melt a little thanks to the grace of chemistry.
While the other three partners stared at him in disbelief, Dean gave a sanitized version of his experience with the ghost, and how the Khan prevented the spirit from getting in.
”Call a meeting of the ofﬁcers. Tomorrow. Our adversaries don't know it yet, but we just took the advantage. Yeah, get some fucking sleep to you too."
Cas' old vessel stood at the door to his apartment, looking as disheveled as ever. "I've been kind of wanting one last tour with an angel inside," he admitted. "Everything got crazy and maybe I didn't end things too well."
"Yeah, the preacher gig. I know," Dean said disinterestedly. "If it's a friend of Father Gregory's, I promise not to get too wasted. Don't wait up."
He started wondering how long he'd be able to keep this up before the ﬁnality of his separation from the angel hit home. Finally his brother fell silent.
"So the angels, I mean, the Holy People, they're not even the same kind of thing as the Sun," Sam cut in, ignoring the look from Darla.
The intense, alien pleasure he discovered with the angel recently was such a game changer he'd been able to keep himself from thinking about it until Zachariah crudely confronted him with it.
He didn't know how he would feel if these were merely consenting humans acting out their little fantasies, but all Dean knew was this warehouse of sad angels was nothing like what he'd had with his two lovers. He was watching something inﬁnitely miserable and dangerous, something that no angel would seek out if he knew how to achieve true union.
"I'm not doing this for you, brother, nor even for Heaven," Remiel whispered to where Balthazar had stood.
"It was decided to spare an archangel's pride from further insult. But somewhere along the line a little bit of Dean's soul rubbed off on Castiel. A few others have had it happen. Apparently, the things can be transplanted under the right conditions."
"Yeah." As if Dean had just uttered the open sesame, the guy made way for him to come in. He led the way into a parlor where the noise of a soap opera on full volume easily drowned out the music on downstairs.
"Oh, that's right, let me tell him what bar to meet us at. He's writing back in our room." Batlhazar paused for a second. "All right, one of our favorites from the 19th century it is."
Valac took them into his chambers immediately, and said with a show of disinterest, "So, you've decided losing one of your own to our side is a big black eye for Heaven."
"That's like, statistically impossible, soldier boy," Davin said, setting up one test of skill after another that Dean passed with ease.
Sam stood there for a moment. This moodiness of Dean's was not a good sign. It didn't even make any sense. They had some kind of mass soul- harvesting going on, and Dean was getting upset about crackers.
"How would I know, Sam? They didn't pass out gaydar with my package. Wait! That's it!" Dean jumped up and the trailer groaned in protest.
"Your homegrown suffering is really a touching tribute," Valac said, looking around at all the implements and the Limbo-dwellers, who were paralyzed with fear. "But it pales before the real thing, doesn't it?"
Sam walked over to the car, the car that was one of the gods in his brother's pantheon. He was different since he was in Hell, of course. Dean had admitted that he'd discovered things about himself there that frightened him.
"I'm too thrown off my usual self for poker, though I guess you have a perfect poker face," Dean replied. "And they'd be able to tell if you messed up the machines. Nice work, though. Cash always comes in handy where we're going."
The angel drew himself up to his full height and ﬂitted around the globe several times until he found the correct incantation to use the book properly without harming his vessel.
"Did I hit the wrong frequency?" the human asked, panicked. The last thing that he needed was the Heavenly Host listening in on his Enochian lessons.
"Couldn't be Tonenili, right, he's more of a trickster kind of fella? Water's his department, but he would get bored from doing the same thing for so long."
Then he woke up. Alone. A quick inventory revealed not a mark on him, but that didn't matter with angels! Cas could've ridden him in more ways than one and erased the memory and the evidence. God Almighty! Why did he ever start messing around with angels? "We have work for you to do" my ass!
On these nighttime walks, which Sam no longer begrudged him, Dean didn't feel so alone. There was so much going on; the universe was so huge and so present.
The bartender ﬂuttered his eyelashes at Dean and the uncategorizable creature that he was tried very hard to cram some of himself into that ﬂirtatious gaze.
"Can you believe these guys all share DNA from the Khan?" Dean said excitedly about the family that ran the restaurant. If this is how was brother wanted to play it—compartmentalizing the hell out of things-Sam didn't think he was the one to judge.
"Oh, thank God, Sam," he grabbed hold of the same familiar features to make sure that they were real.
Dean and Etienne went back to serious lounging around and drinking. They were in Dean’s East Village apartment, where they sat with their preferred beverages and tried to make sense of it all.
"I knew he was about to do something rash," protested Balthazar. "Castiel was always intemperate. But I've had years to think about this. I'm prepared to recite it from beginning to end."
"Yeah," said the woman who was standing a little in front of the people who had come to greet the dust cloud the car kicked up.
"If you say so," the other man looked him up and down. "Those protein shakes Sam turned you on to making the difference?" He gestured to the canister on the table.
"Wait a minute, baby, don't take it like that," Dean tried to soothe the angel. "This is the way it's supposed to be. You get into it, do things you wouldn't normally do in the heat of the moment. A lot of people ﬁnd it therapeutic. Plenty of chicks I was with—"
Balthazar winced. It was hard not to talk about his newfound happiness, but it was the last thing his old comrade needed to hear. "And Grace told me about something else that has been forgotten in our long memories. Did you know that you weren't the only one born with eight wings?"
Dean turned, expecting someone from the Cause he would have to gently rebuff. He didn't recognize the face at all. Damn. Much worse.
Heaven was a busy place. He'd not had loneliness or intimacy, per se. Warriors aren't made that way, usually.
I am happy to report that my guest is very well-behaved and no trouble at all. In fact, my efforts to learn a second language are going much better, and I'm experiencing a sense of calm that is quite useful during these stressful times.
"To hear Bobby tell it, the festival planners were kind of asking for it. These holograms are apparently the perfect way for a spirit to manifest and control a crowd that's the least bit opened up to the beyond. I should have realized as soon as that girl told us about the virtual show this afternoon."
"They've never seen such a failure as you," said one sector of his brain, which was carved up in different occupied zones.
Hell was there for you, was the marketing angle. They knew what you wanted, they taught you what you wanted. And you could come back for more any time you liked.
She knew that people did like to rest a little once they'd passed, and neither the shaman nor the warrior was likely to get any rest any time soon dealing with the mess over at Bobby's house.
Dean put his hand on his brother's shoulder. "You can see I wasn't trying to force a lifestyle choice on you. How could I not give you a little push to something that will probably save you?"
And here Dean always thought his brother preferred brunettes. "Yeah, that's really interesting, Encylopedia Brown, but I don't see what's it has to do with our downsizing demon."
Remiel hated making anyone suffer, and he also detested getting involved with lovers’ relationships. Unfortunately, Dean was in a dangerously fragile state, and this was the only way.
Dean had been drinking less since he brought his number of sins back to the pedestrian seven, Sam had noticed.
"Peace, brother and patience," Rafael stayed his hand. "Ah well, we know from experience with Castiel that it will take a while for the creature to recover from its ﬁt," the lead angel said, throwing the torture device aside. "Carry him back to the anatomist to have the growth re-measured!"
Cas' brow cleared. "Of course! I had sped up time in your perception and neglected to slow it down again. What you experienced as happening at a normal speed, when you remembered it in your home dimension it must have been a blur. Try to think about it right now."
The two brothers mainly stayed on the road like before. As Dean had suggested, they looked up experts in the whitest to the darkest magic, and every shade of gray in between.
"But you still come out and look for that warmth. And you ﬁnd it for a little while," Cas pointed out. "The places where Dean goes, he's trying to avoid just that, and he would quickly snuff out that warmth if he did.”
Etienne fell apart, he got possessed by any evil spirit he could dredge up, was thrown into an asylum for attacking people on the streets because he had an angel-shaped hole inside of him, left by this intimate coexistence with an alien life form. Dean wasn't sure what it was like for the average vessel, who he'd heard existed in a kind of suspended animation while the angel was using them. But between his Spanish friend and Balthazar some essential veil had dropped, and it was not the clean transaction it was meant to be. It destroyed Etienne.
"That's exactly what we think is going on!" Sam exclaimed. "A marital tiff between Mr. and Mrs. Rain. He's in the doghouse for something –"
When they established through their mental connection that Tiny’s thought very much like his own, they grinned.
Dean was already stripping off that ridiculous outﬁt as soon as he had the key in the lock, so he was in the shower ﬁrst.
The angel tried so hard to find the way back there that Dean feared  they’d never reach Wonderland again.
Imprisoned separately from then forward, the Nephilim only saw each other at the meetings where Rafael's new strategy was put into place. Every day, Castiel looked at his compatriots for just a moment and saw that they had neither heard from their former vessels, nor had any concrete knowledge of their capture. He tried to let his resolve be an example for the others.
This was the other key to his downfall in Hell. Balthazar never came. Oh, the demons reassured him that this longed-for love existed. They regaled him with stories about the likable angel's exploits that had reached Hell. They were well informed.
"There's more to you than meets the eye, Monsieur Winchester," Etienne said, looking Dean up and down with a penetrating gaze.
"Your older brother is impetuous. Leave him be," White Crow said as they watched the Khan jump into Dean's body for another round of target practice. "You have the magic stick that will glow if he is hurt, so do not burden him with your concerns about the stories in which he comes home sick or injured, or the two of you are separated when he goes to another realm. They are all true. It has already happened in each of these ways."
The sheriff often traveled with an ancestor, but Sam had always thought it was a sort of quality control thing about her decision-making for the tribe.
"Dean," he said, shaking her hand and sitting down. While he listened to her amusing stories about having an active social life at her age, he observed her on the angelic plane. She was deﬁnitely one of them.
"No news doesn't mean the worst news, Naayééʼ Neizghání," Sam gripped his brother's arm and then they both started at the difﬁcult name rolling off his tongue.
"That's pretty close," Dean said, no longer feeling quite the effect now that he was a lot closer to being able to kick Cas' ass, but he still felt very excited about the prospect of being alone with him in that strong new body.
"Dean, Dean, it's not worth it. Come on. We have a job, remember?" Sam took a haymaker himself while trying to separate the two men.
Much like other spirits he and Sam had dealt with in the past, the spirit they'd summoned wasn't helpful on her own initiative. It was all about asking Mrs. Rain the right questions.
Castiel's old scowl was back, and Dean wanted to kiss him for it. He hadn't realized how much he missed teasing Cas.
His companion looked up abashed. "How was I to know that, if cats come in either gender? I started thinking of you that way when I was getting to know you after raising you from the dead. You were this little thing with sharp claws that kept biting the hand that fed him."
Dean smiled in thanks because he felt sorry for this person who still expected something of him, he wasn't sure what. The demon contorted his face in what they both supposed was a smile back. Hosting a material being was difﬁcult for Hell, where any liquid other than alcohol couldn't remain healthful for long. Dean saw the books on human nutrition mixed in with manuals on caring for your ﬁrst puppy that Valac brought in the room sometimes and ﬂipped through, frowning. For a while the demon had him in cedar chips as if he were a hamster, with a little ball with a bell in it to play with.
"All of them we can ﬁt," Dean said mischievously. "All my favorites. You know what I like." He gave a thrust with his blunted weapon, disarming his adversary.
"I am from far away, but still your ﬁghting prowess has reached there," Dean heard Castiel say as he made the slightest bow of their head. They came to back in the desert outside Vegas.
Every once in awhile, a real angel, one judged to be too obsessed with dark pastimes, was chosen to spend a short time in Hell. The angel's itch for darkness was scratched, the demons got to play house with a real angel for a day or so.
Sam had to put his foot down about how much of a release he found out of ganking whatever was handy. Now that--that was better than Betty. It was some kind of Zen moment he'd never felt so deeply. It got him off so much it scared him.
Now that he said it aloud, it sounded foolishly simple. Perhaps Bobby Singer had been right about having it out face to face.
It was everything he'd been near for months, but it was directed at him, and he felt like he was going to be sick.
It was difﬁcult to control these mental communications between bonded ones, and Etienne and Balthazar probably had the strongest bond from knowing each other so long.
"Ugh! We've already decided that your boyfriend-thing is acting like the Wind, because he's whispering advice in your ear," Darla said to Dean. "At least, that's what you say it is. And the Wind is like, the most powerful thing around, just about. The Wind was in the First World, and it created the First Man and First Woman.
Cas took a deep breath. He was trying to ﬁght this new irritability that was so easy for him to fall into these days. "And then an absence took over. I don't know how to explain it. A terrible absence that is not death."
"All right, I'll play. Have you been able to determine the source of the gains?" Valac was bored, and bookkeeping was his personal form of torture. Now that he was in charge, he tried to be sure he was the one doing the torturing.
"What?" Dean choked on his milkshake. It was a little too thick. "We don't have time to go legit at this late stage in the game."
It was odd. Sam's eyes were telegraphing the same message to him when the door opened to a hospital ward much like the ones they had been walking through.
They had a simple evening. Together, they ﬂew to the top of the Empire State Building and listened to the Enochian streaming all over the world. Castiel explained some of the obscure stuff with Dean wound in his arms.
"Not taller or bigger physically. This was a big dude we're talking about. But I think it's safe to say I was the one with the power," Dean said, thinking of Adonis marveling at the ﬁrst sight of the Nephilim in the sky.
"Hope you aren't leaving any of yourself behind," his dad said, as he had taken to doing once it was understood the Dean was sleeping with girls. Their father had treated both sons to several stern lectures about getting girls pregnant.
"I had to do some research," the angel replied a triﬂe testily. Right before they called he'd been working his way through a an charismatic church at prayer, trying to familiarize himself with what he could see of those souls that were conveniently opened up for viewing.
It was almost as much fun to egg on Dean as it was to play "Gank 'Em Up." The title and rules had changed over the years, but it was the same basic concept from when they were kids kicking the front seat with their dad driving. But in recent months Dean had been taking it taken more seriously than ever. Which was both worrisome and hilarious.
The angel already detested the creature for being of the same cloth as the spiritualist that led Etienne astray, but he forced himself to be polite.
The few people he could see fell into one of a few groups. They were mainly children, old people, and people wearing work uniforms. There were bus drivers and restaurant servers, farmers and janitors.
"What news is this?" Raphael asked. "Is this condition some kind of contagion they have afﬂicted upon us?" "Crowley thought the idea absurd," Remiel said.
"You don't plan these things. It wasn't easy for me to accept that I'm getting closer to someone who's not human. It's like bestiality in reverse and I wasn't anxious to break that taboo.”
Dean was moving around the house as if homing in on something. "No brother, I think you were right about it being a book, it's just not in their secret stash."
Sam studied his face. "You look good, man. I get down on him sometimes, but Cas really does come through. He's a true friend. Hopefully heaven really is going to ignore you for a little while. You just want what I want-to save people and maybe not be miserable every second of the day."
The demon laughed. "A straight shooter. How refreshing. We don't establish things like that from these little meetings, friend. We're here to sniff each other's arses and posture and then go back and dictate a memo."
"You're having a little too much fun with this, Sherlock. See if you can hold back your enthusiasm when the old man is around," Dean said.
Together, the childless widower who was functionally illiterate and the headstrong young woman ﬂeeing from her highbrow family roamed the ﬁelds, falling in love with each other only secondarily. What they really loved together was a third thing—the countryside, in all its color and form.
For anyone who didn't know better, they'd think that Dean, always prone to extremes, was ﬁnding an escape in running and ancient history. All that mattered was that they didn't want to tip their hand, any of their hands, early, before they'd ensnared Heaven and Hell in so much chaos they didn't know who to ﬁght anymore.
"I brought up Persephone because I wondered if you realized that you, yourself, have created such a 'deal' with our pastimes here."
Some were drag queens in towering boots and odd wigs, and others were completely normal-looking businessmen. Dean couldn't put his ﬁnger on what the people all had in common, but everyone was very friendly, as if it were an odd sort of family he'd stumbled upon.
"Can you see me with your eyes closed?" Dean asked the others. The ﬁrst two to be turned nodded, but the others looked confused. "We've got some work to do, but don't worry. I've had a lot of time to adjust, so I can make it easier on you." H
"Dean Winchester, you emotionally stunted bastard. You thought it was the job that kept you from getting close to somebody, but you're a toxic mess that destroys everyone he gets close to. Cas knew who he was before he met you, and now you gave him the ability to feel all the shit in the universe, plus all the crap you unloaded on him. Good thing you got yourself quarantined downstairs and can't hurt him anymore."
The sheriff was all brass tacks, and he'd seen her in the company of several spirits as if it was no big deal.
"But the cloud of blackness you've been manufacturing here couldn't help but attract us like bears to honey," Valac continued, taking a small envelope out of his sleazy jacket's inner pocket. "You've been playing with ﬁre, friend, you all have," the demon's gaze encompassed everyone who had been in Limbo.
"So King Kong may be in the same situation. I'm thinking I summon Kong and see if I can do Fay Wray one better. Maybe a little TLC and Kong will do what I need him to do, take out the werewolf,"
Balthazar had Zophiel on the rack. Once the prisoners understood that their torturer was truly acting as a double agent, he felt a little more secure that they wouldn't involuntarily come out with recriminations for having misled them into bonding with their vessel.
The demons had seen angelic bodies such as they were normally unable to see, and they were ready to kiss the hems of the quartet's clothing, so reverent were they of anything matching their angelic archetypes.
"He wasn't a man-whore!" Dean's face was ﬂushing. "When his wife was kidnapped, he created a law that stopped people from wife-stealing. The Khan stopped torture; he was ahead of his time. Hate to tell you: they overcharged you on that Phoenix University degree of yours."
Castiel felt as though he was going to come apart himself from worrying about his mate. Dean was troubled, he knew this, but the last time he entered Hell, it was out of despair that Cas had shut him out. They were working on things now. Dean had forgiven him.
"Seems that she wanted to have her son's boyfriend literally beat the gay out of him," Sam observed. "On some level she might have believed homosexuality is a kind of demonic inﬂuence. She must have ﬁgured nothing would turn Eddie off like nearly getting killed by Soren."
Dean returned from his walk and hit the books. Military history and Native American myths were his two standbys.
"Ah, no rest for the holy," his instructor said. "I must go. I wish I could tell if you're really holding up as well as you're trying to make out, but there are no precedents here. Practice those verb forms I gave you. Goodbye, cousin."
"So back then, guys were, I mean, there were places," Dean began tentatively, still not used to having changed social statuses with his new preference.
Who, of course, was no longer there to receive the blow. Sam watched his brother's ﬁghting prowess, hewn out of all his stolen dreams and existing in some sacred place where not even his despair could corrode it. It was beautiful, the explosion of blows Dean pulled out of thin air and delivered to the much-larger opponent, though not without sustaining a little punishment himself.
Darla was the one he heard the most from. She sent him horribly misspelled text messages and goofy pictures from the internet almost every day. "Somebody has to make sure you're not going mental," was her blunt reasoning for checking in so frequently. Dean sent her pictures of the city with appropriately rude notes and felt his duty to his past was discharged.
He got the line out of one of those old swordﬁghting movies he and the Khan watched with rapt attention while Sam slept, but he'd had to put his foot down about the guys acting them out.
Some demon had loused them up pretty good, and Bobby patching them up was ﬁnally the icebreaker that helped him get to know these four brilliant hunters who were now dead in their own safe house.
Only after the other angel was gone did Dean realize Balthazar's lips hadn't moved during the last sentence.
But now, Valac's dolly wouldn't even heal himself anymore. Was it that he couldn't remember how? That he didn't care?
Far away through his bond with Etienne, he could feel a desperate struggle occurring between his friend and Balthazar, but it was too late to consider what might be going on.
Then he said aloud. "Sometimes Dean can be rather irritating. Might I try some of that cranberry sauce?"
“Otherwise it would be like saying," he yawned broadly, "'Hello, Mr. demon, I am deﬁnitely going to gank you,' and the demon says back, 'Very well, old chap.' Way to take all the spice out of life, Sam."
"Touch nothing. None of you. And don't put anything in your mouth!" the angel ordered his companions, staring at a point in the distance. "We must leave this place at once."
He looked at the hands gripping his shirt. They belonged to a glassy-eyed young man with a wobbly smile who was the picture of everything Dean didn't want to be welded to forever.
"Etienne," he said in that tone that was so like the one his friend wished he could hear in other circumstances. But Etienne would never waste his real affections on anyone so obsessed with nothingness.
"I suppose you've been sent by that liar Remiel, so there's not much I can do about it in my position, is there?" Castiel snapped. "Why should I come out when the new regime promises to be just as corrupt as the old one?"
Upstairs was in an uproar, and the Ten were not prepared to have their peaceful regime disrupted by angels with desires for anything other than union.
Both times, he'd lost control of himself when the man was suffering. That must be what he liked about Dean. The human's obvious ecstasy left him cold.
"You need to start heading off for home ports, Sailor. Do you need me to call you a cab?" the bartender asked. "That depends, Honey, how far do you live from here?"
"Why have they taken me to Hell?" he asked his nothingness. Hell was where everything hurt, wasn't it? Dean tried to remember. Everything in this place needled him in places where he could still feel pain. It was agony, but not the nice kind that helped him forget.
"And I know from experience that they don't tell the whole truth, not even because they mean to hold something back in every case, but because they can't express their truths to our limited awareness."
"Oh well, that thing didn't suit my purposes, better luck next time," was Balthazar's attitude, which at least didn't contain the self-righteousness Dean occasionally tuned in on with Angel Radio.
"We have no idea what kind of repercussions this is going to have on our plane, but it's kind of a neat surprise, knowing we're going to gank somebody without being sure what. At the end of the day, we may have the hides of Lucifer, Crowley, who knows?"
"If they want to do some late-night chanting or something I could dig that right now," Sam said, washing his face at the sink. "One of Cecil's pop quizzes, not so much."
Left alone in Paris, Etienne had been robbed of even the memory of his dear Balthazar—the presence once closer than his very ﬂesh-and had tried all manner of things to ﬁll that space. He and Balthazar had some real shouting matches about the foolishness of this choice that Balthazar made unilaterally. Maybe Etienne could have avoided Hell altogether, if only Balthazar had let him remember their time together.
"In addition, that the area has to be contained as a crime scene until the authorities can determine the source of the drug. Well, you fellows are aware that people can be kept in virtual quarantine without their suspecting a thing.”
“You're upset," he said to the man seemingly gasping for breath in front of him. "You regret making that choice," Castiel ventured.
"Uh, yeah." The vodka made a long silky trail down Dean's throat. "Didn't you hear me? I was praying my head off. It was the only thing left to do."
There was a silence in which Castiel and Balthazar expected their new leader to explode at such a suggestion.
The occasional drink his father turned a blind eye to, if he noticed at all, so Dean snuck a little here and there. It helped him go back and focus on his responsibilities as the family anchor. Davin Windham had been the ﬁrst sign that there was something powerful in him that was being ignored, but that incident soon was coated over by all the other places and faces. All those girls…
"The Bible passages this young man picks out are no coincidence. Clearly, he's saying that he forgives someone, or is trying to," the minister said.
"No, you were transmitting on a solidly prayerful wavelength and those are always private for Enochian speakers. I only heard you for a second because our prayers coincided."
Etienne and Dean stared at each other for some minutes, passing back and forth thoughts of the sort of vicarious pleasures they could produce for both angels and demons. They both knew Hell’s psychology intimately. And Dean knew more than he wanted to about Heaven.
But something had reached the quiet, unassuming student in a place where it shouldn't have. Balthazar was at ﬁrst perplexed and then horriﬁed to see the depth of the human emotional range playing out in his former vessel.
"No offense, but are you going to help a brother out at some point? Cecil's a genius but he's kind of a dick. What does your sixth sense tell you?" Sam asked his brother as they washed up for a dinner Dean still didn't feel up to eating.
The ghost came right at him, entered him, and left him, but only after throwing him around like a rag doll and leaving him with a broken rib.
Cas thought back to the conversation he'd had with his brothers last night. Dean's killing of a powerful demigod with the power of the black hole in his being, well, Heaven had surveillance systems for events like that.
In a few moments he heard a response from somewhere, "Yes, I'm actually working at the moment, but let me know when you ﬁnd another section that interests you."
Dancing was the way he ﬁt in best with the old, proud ways of his home village. It was what showed Etienne Roberto Valery-Vasquez to be one of theirs, though he spoke another language and was lavishly educated for possibilities far beyond those of other villagers.
To Cas' mind, beginning the hated "role-playing" as Dean called it was about as sensual as giving him a blood transfusion. Fatally, he told his lover so.
After ﬁve minutes of having his fragile mind blown watching actual brontosaurii and pterodactyls, Dean said, "Hey, Cas, you still here?"
When they got in the elevator, Dean burst out, "I don't even like being around non-contagious hippies, and you volunteer us to spend time with a bunch of body-snatching bohemians?"
While he ate the two men traded dirty tales, the waiter sitting back in admiration at the classical style Dean had inherited from his ex-spirit. When he was ﬁnished, Dean headed out to the street, decided that he would spend the next year or two of his life around the only people that didn't make him feel like they were merely reﬂecting his own energy back at him.
"I like our other games better," Dean said with an edge in his voice. "Don't you worry about what they're up to on this secret assignment? We both know Heaven is if anything more devious than Hell." His face brightened. "So give me a dose, quick."
"Idiot-savants," Cas completed Dean's thought as he found some modern elephants for the man to see in the wild. "No. Something more complex than that."
Dean felt a twinge. A while back, that would have been a dream come true. He was a shameless groupie. Being part of his favorite rock moments was something he was almost willing giving up his pathetic soul for.
A parishioner reported going into the church ofﬁce and ﬁnding some books on homosexuality. "They must be thinking of starting a ministry," the person said, but the boys knew the woman's motivation must have been quite the opposite.
"I bet he has," Darla was muttering. Dean had had to be completely honest about his agenda to rescue Cas as part of this operation, and the girl loved teasing the badass with the bow-and-arrow about his boyfriend.
Always skeptical of his brother's hunches, Sam looked over Dean's shoulder as he opened the small, worn leather volume.
A trio of musicians had been setting up in one corner: an accordionist, a ﬂute player, and someone with a small guitar. They began their ﬁrst song.
Etienne's ﬁnger was on the button that shut off the mechanism. He chose one of the manual tools from the rack on the wall, letting his observer suffer a little, waiting to see what his fate would be.
"I sympathize," Crowley had said. "The working grunts like us always have to pay for the mistakes of others.
"Trying to save face while he ran away with his tail between his legs, I bet," Dean said, and caught Cecil's wife laughing a little too hard.
"No, like why don't we ever ask people for help? Because Dad drummed it into our heads—'only trust family.' Well, we're not like him; we get along with people.
It was a roar as of many voices. Dean felt his brother's back tense against his and shouted, "Whatever you do, don't cut me, Sam."
"Alcohol is a drug," Sam pointed out. He, for one, remembered last night. "Maybe you should have some compassion."
"I'm sure I'll be all right in a day or two." He took a deep breath. "If there's any good that's come from this shitty situation, I want it to be something for you."
"Big Brother, Little Brother, I'll leave you to it," the sheriff said, hiding her smile. "You eat whatever they put in front of you," she admonished Dean.
Dean had the strangest dream. He was in Hell, which was, well, Hell, but he felt better than he had ever felt in his life. It must be Hell, because he wasn't used to crawling around in tattered clothes anywhere else. But he felt great, like how you would feel if you'd been rolling around with a bunch of puppies or after a day at the beach, but times a hundred.
Dean circled around so that Sam could return to the motel and pretend to have been there all night. All things considering, it had been a good day. Seeing Cas' true shape like he did today was a huge relief.
"Listen, man, they patched Cas up and then Balthazar swooped in to take over as nurse. He thinks the few words Cas activated from that book set him back so far he needs some kind of major angel antidote or he and his vessel aren't going to heal very fast."
"I can order for myself, Dean," he muttered. When Sam was a kid, he used to think of Dean as one of those sheep dogs that was programmed to herd sheep but would push around anything else that was handy.
The specter was of a young, un-jaded man with wild hair, a little shorter than he, looking like the promise of a new age, circa 1967.
Finally, one day Castiel said,” I really must return to work, Dean. Grace has entrusted me with this mission, for whatever reason, and I must deal with this wretched club."
"I hate Fate. I resent the hell out of all the shit those bitches keep cooking up for me. But take away that structure, that thing to ﬁght against, and it's all just one big cage ﬁght with no rules, no winners, no sense to it if we're merely determined by our environment."
Sam looked at his brother from the passenger seat and knew that Dean was getting ready to propose a game of "Gank 'Em Up," which never failed to remind the younger brother about the poet Wallace Stevens.
“Mind you, brother." Balthazar's voice softened. "Even after that they look up to you. You had no road map and still you found your way to Dean. You gave me hope after all my years of mourning Etienne."
"If Cas and I could have talked about all this from the get-go, I wouldn't have kept this from any of you, especially you, Sam, not once I knew what was what.
And Sam did. He poured out his worries about his own vessel situation, which he felt to be overwhelming when his brother wasn't there to help him carry the burden. Sam admitted that he'd assumed he had his brother all ﬁgured out.
"That's the club in New York, you dimwit! Now that we've nearly perfected the short-term paralysis of angelic faculties with that infernal techno music, any angel can be pleasurably relieved of his power for a little while, and then leave as if nothing has happened. Or so they think. Perhaps they've had more clients than usual."
Yes, he was helping his only true friend, and that friend's lover, yes he might possibly overthrow the stupid regime that believed in using people as vessels and then throwing them away. Yes, he most certainly would make that toad Crowley wish he'd never been shat out by the universe.
And so, End The End, Inc., was born with the premise that he would never have to deal with any of the paperwork. The two other men and some trusted hunters took care of everything over the coming months.
“The records point to inclinations that can't be satisﬁed by any human or angel, by anyone other than one of Hell's denizens. Didn't you often feel your angel to be holding back, afraid of abusing his greater power, when that's what you wanted from him?"
"No, no, I—" The angel straightened up. "That was very apropos, Dean. The deﬁant posture, the—everything. You have the most amusing way of putting things."
Dean retreated to a part of his brain while Cas assumed his earnest note-taking posture before Sam and Bobby's stories of Dean-wrangling. It was weird how easy it was for them to ﬂow in and out of each other's thoughts, but it was so right. When he ﬁrst was fused into Cas' vessel back in Hell, he was so far gone he felt more like a rapidly scattering mist than a person.
Cas could tell Dean was having a hard time focusing on his face as he reached out and touched two ﬁngers to his forehead. The delicate fabric of his friend's body and mind was now inert.
As often happened, Etienne ended up calling up a demon instead of the god he wished to ask why he missed some unidentiﬁable thing from beyond the sky.
All Dean knew was, things got bad. It was worse than he'd ever felt it, this hole eating away at the center of him. Just like in Hell, it was the knowledge that even the pain and the horror was a ﬂimsy mockup. It was random, it had no substance, but it hurt anyway.
"I don't know. It's like ganking someone, in a way. You aren't sure how it's going to go, who's in control-that's what revs you up, and if you were sure there wouldn't be a point.
Bobby woke up with an amber-alert level hangover and two sleeping Winchesters passed out on the couch.
She was short, about 5'2", with chin-length dark hair. She was wearing a short-sleeved white shirt over an army-green t-shirt, jeans, and rubber boots. Dean judged her to be early forties and nobody's fool.
"I'm getting something," Sam said excitedly from behind his laptop. "All of these lucid moments the kid has, there's a pattern."
"My intent was merely to be a caring presence while you relived your trauma from hell. But something happened."
Dean was aware of Darla staring at the unusually intense exchange between him and her relative, but this was too important for him to worry about that.
"At least some of these wounds they must have inﬂicted on each other," Sam said, indicating the scratches they each bore and the remnants of ﬂesh under the ﬁngernails." The knife wounds could have come from somewhere else, or from the knives still in their hands. "Maybe we can avoid telling Bobby."
Some part of his mind wondered why the demon would be paralyzing him if his signature plan was to get people all heated up by dancing into mass hysteria.
"You aroused my wrath. It's good practice.” And then the two sparring partners were doing that staring thing that made Sam so uncomfortable.
When Dean froze. The gun clattered on the ﬂoor out of his reach, scattering the salt line in the process.
The image of some other hand tightening a network of chains around that body was so intolerable Valac smashed some of his furniture.
"If it were one case, it would be scientiﬁcally fascinating." Dr. Evans admitted. "But about 150 people have disappeared, and we have less than half that number of bodies claiming to be that full 150.
"Remember when I was so freaked out about those soul-sandwiches made by the Jimi-god?" Dean's thoughts ﬂowed smoothly into Cas'. "I didn't want anyone in here with us, but I don't think it works exactly like that."
"This must be one amazing gal to unwind you, Dean; jeez, your nerves have nerves," the man said with what Dean assured his companion was his habitual lack of tact. "Does she, you know, could I take her for a spin, too too?"
It was of Rafael in his usual male vessel, sitting at a table full of ﬁve-year-olds, each wearing a party hat. The angel, who wore a paper crown, was throwing a temper-tantrum because he didn't get his way at his own birthday party.
"All right now, as discussed, any funny stuff and he goes back for good," Darius said to Remiel at their assigned meeting spot. "Our realm only agreed to deal with you, Remy, because of your millennium of fair dealings."
“The benefit of the friend is that he gets to spend time with the person he loves”, Cas had read somewhere, and he truly believed it. So he felt blessed that he could at least be around Dean, and enjoy his company, even if it came in a friendship-only package.
When he arrived, Jesse was already there. He hadn’t seen the other boy in so many years, it felt weird now to be standing in front of him. He had seen pictures on Facebook, sure, but it wasn’t quite the same as finally seeing him again in person. The initial shock was quickly replaced by a familiar warmth in his chest as Jesse pulled him into a hug.
"Yes, it is." He looked up at Dean with wide open eyes but quickly squinted them as he analyzed Dean's face. "What's the matter?" He placed the laptop on the bed, stood up and took a step towards Dean. "You don't think what you have done is good?"
) at the coffee shop when he was on his way to his dorm, and decided to join them. He didn’t feel like eating that night, but he could use an almond milk mocha. He could use the half-barked way Dean laughed a little bit more.
Alright. That smile did not take the air out of Dean's lungs. Nope. Luckily, the noises the evelator made when it arrived camouflaged his pounding heart and he had a good enough reason to leave before he passed out or something.
Castiel seemed really offended and for some twisted reason Dean liked that. He felt like laughing out loud because this conversation was ridiculous, but incredibly entertaining and it was nice to be having it. He did not laugh out loud. Instead, he made use of the height difference between them to feed his confidence and took a step towards Cas.
"Told you I'd be here, didn't I?" He says, lowering his voice more than his vocal cords will forgive him for tomorrow. It's a little bit weird, but he's not drunk enough to not care if he blows his cover.
