"Finchdale, sir. A boarding school not far from here." John kindly replied. He kept looking out the window wishing the traffic could hurry just a bit faster for his sake.
Why does he need to go to a school so far in the country anyway? What's the point of that, he'll get the same education as he did at his old school, so what does it matter?
"Yeah, see you later," John waved off. Mike disappeared leaving John alone. He glanced around the room in a daze deciding what to do next. Unpacking, that's what's next.
Walking down the hall, he grew more and more anxious. Sounds of objects moving around and feet shuffling became louder as they came through the doorway.
Sherlock runs up to John the next day at school. "Hey! My mummy said you could come over anytime. Is that alright with you?" He pants from the excitement.
John came by Sherlock's desk holding his hands behind his back bashfully. "Hi, John." Sherlock greeted his friend delightedly. He had just been coloring a bee but that didn't really matter at the moment.
As they ventured farther up h breaths became shorter and more forced meanwhile Mike is chattering away, definitely not huffing and puffing like John.
"It wasn't my fault Mummy, he pushed me first. It was self-defense. He was the one being ar-ard-arduous." Sherlock looks down sheepishly. He wishes he was with Redbeard.
He can hear Ella's voice say to him "This will be good for you, a change of scenery is what you need."
Mike carefully chose how to phrase his sentence. "You see mate, your roommate isn't exactly, what's the words? Ideal you could say," he explained.
John stiffened at the mention of his old school but only for a fraction of a second. His smile suddenly felt too thin and began to droop down. "Mum wanted me to go to my dad's old school, felt like it was better than Darnier." That wasn't a lie but not the whole story either.
"Oh, a boarding school, seems nice." The cabbie said, looking into the rearview mirror. "Ever been into the countryside, or are you a city lover?" He asked then, giving a small chuckle.
He heard the commotion of rowdy boys coming from that direction and decides to head there. He opened the door to reveal a small group of boys circled around each other, laughing with one another. It looked to be a comfortable room. A sofa sat in corner across from a fire place with two boys lounging comfortably on top. All around were things to make this place feel like home, a small piano in the back, dart board, table tennis, a flat screen in the corner with the sofa.
Sherlock wasn't really sure that trucks would be a good game but he agreed anyway because maybe John could make it interesting for him.
Traffic started up again, and they slowly wind their way through the roads to their destination. John watched again as the city life slowly trickled away letting trees grow more and more together, and buildings became less prominent.
John looked for the source of the voice and found a husky boy about his age beaming at him. He was taller than john, towering over him by a few inches, a round face with round glasses and bright eyes. Suddenly it clicked for him of who he was.
John turns around joyfully to see his new friend. "Really, I can? Great! Do you want to play trucks with me?" He asks Sherlock.
A subtle whisper went around the room sizing up him just from looks alone. He stood in the doorway, fidgeting a bit under the stares.
After gathering directions from two fourteen year olds, that helped him in no way, shape, or form, John finally came about the boarding house he was assigned to.
The memory of his mum and Harry standing at the bus stop floats into his mind. His mum, trying not to cry in public waved and tried to smile as her second eldest child is being sent off to a posh boarding school. Harry with her stance wide and protective, adorned a look only saved for terrible times. Their father always said that she was too dramatic for her own good which caused to her to leave as a ghost of her former self and care too little about things that should matter the most.
There were six boarding houses, three for girls and three for boys. They were all categorized by names who influenced greatly within history. His boarding house was named accordingly - Doyle.
Silence answered back. No one seemed to be here. For reasons unknown he found that to be a bit strange.
At first John was not happy with the decision of transferring to Finchdale.  It didn't matter to him that it had been his dad's "home away from home". His family needs him and going to some school thirty miles away won't help. Not to mention the money they didn't have to pay for the school.
It was one of those professional cameras, a Nikon, costed a lot of money. It wasn't John's decision to get it in the first place. It was a part of his therapy, Ella suggested that he take pictures, to capture any emotion that he was feeling. He thought that to be a bit foolish because he had never been skilled in the arts. He only bought it a few weeks ago so he was still rubbish at it. His camera roll consisted of dreary trees and different fields of grass captured in a weird angle. Ella had told him that he was certainly getting better at it but he didn't see it. She stated to him that this was supposed to be an outlet for him but the only thing it seemed to do was make him feel even more useless than before.
Sherlock frowns, but John gathers the plastic bags, walks around the other side of the bed where most of the objects he'd swept off had landed and, still focused on Sherlock, settles on the floor. "You lie down, and tell me how you've classified each of these things. We'll just organise now. You can save the deductions for later."
His manic self-distraction drained away like the blood from her face, replaced by singular wide-eyed focus: he stood, still as marble, staring at every part of her at once.
An increase in the warmth of John's skin beneath his hand, of John's hand against his skin. No more warning than that before a shimmer spirals up his spine. Different, from the first time, and yet the same subtle power locking their grips in place. John's eyes wide and round, surprise and pleasure and, yes, relief — his own eyes must reflect the same.
John crosses his arms over the hollow ache in his chest, the folded paper safeguarded beneath his palm. "You didn't."
He didn't draw his hand back fast or slow, and didn't bring up a shield of biting words — but the proverbial stiff upper lip marred the hushed pink of his mouth, while his fingertips hovered against my throat. Subtle arcs and twitches of his eyebrows spoke minute pleas — asking me to understand how very much he had to lose.
help, let alone ask. Not a hero, fine; just a stupid arse trying to solve his puzzles, and only incidentally protecting other people.
John, and paid for it terribly. Suffering alone in this musty nest of neglect because he had not, maybe could not, figure if John had forgiveness enough for what Sherlock had done, or how to ask for it in a way John would hear, or whether he deserved to. Did he even know how to acknowledge that much emotion? So many ways he and John were alike; so many ways he needed help and wouldn't ask.
"Turn around," John instructs, before his composure has a chance to crack. He tests the spring of the crop, sending it hissing through the air.
He lets himself fall back on his pillow, blinking away the miasma of red dots and held breath that usually tugs him back into hopelessness, but this dream was different: he wasn't immobilised in terror. He felt — feels — fully alive, battle-tense, alert for the moment he'll be needed. He twists to sit up, scrubs hard at his face, and forces himself to really look at the crisp, peaceful room around him.
Sherlock's fingernails dig tiny crescents of pain into his neck. The imprint (seared with near-painless intensity onto his skin one dark and memorable night, not long after Moriarty's game) had once seemed so stark and black and permanent. Proof, if any were needed, that it was
"That's why the wall took a pounding..." John and Sherlock are equally bad about missing the excitement of the war, in between cases. They've only just finished wrapping up the thing with the Black Lotus, but for all the physical danger they'd faced John's not sure the case was much of an intellectual challenge for Sherlock; he ought to be pouncing on the chance to look at something new.
He came right out and said, 'I'm afraid, John,' and John had told him he'd simply got himself 'a bit worked up', before Sherlock had even begun to explain what he feared. And from there, everything had gone wrong and ever more deeply wrong.
The door swung inward and Sherlock appeared beyond, a whirl of darkness ranging past the fireplace. He stuttered for half a beat then continued, louder and more angrily.
The only response is a slight jump of the tendon under John's fingertips; thoughts chase each other in grim, silent circles behind that impassive face.
A half-dozen other answers wanted to spill out of her but her breath caught hard in her throat, as John's mouth twisted against the things he didn't want to feel or admit or hear out loud. But she could see unequivocal love and fear in John's every move when Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and pressed his hands to his ears, leaving the gun pointing at the ceiling with his finger still on the trigger. Her heart pounded; everything in the moment felt like glass on the verge of shattering.
No, he's right about the connection, but wrong about the wife. Rather than the ratty snarl John would expect, Sally has
. Unshaven; curls drooping flatly around his paler-than-usual face, his too-hollow cheekbones. The dark shirt, dark trousers, dress shoes, they wouldn't have been out of place before he faked his death, when he'd been forever in the news, but all looked like they'd been slept in for days, and the black silk dressing gown hung asymmetrically over the top of it at all (something heavy in the pocket) was torn at the sleeve and spattered with dull stains.
Sherlock blinks, tipped off balance by the unequivocal negation, hand still stretched forward — and John reaches out and grips Sherlock's wrist, arresting the motion.
His eyes flickered open, seeking confirmation that we were anticipating the same journey through these woods, then lit with a half-voiced laugh; fingers searching beneath my shirt as well.
He considers and dismisses the idea of settling on the bed — too much chance of waking Sherlock, too many questions John isn't sure he's able to answer. Too much respect for
A shadow joins them, lingering by the door to apologize for interrupting. Molly greets him by the name "Jim," invites him in, and John doesn't track the conversation at first, distracted by even stranger distortions in his second sight.
John stands beside the bed like a compelling statue (an Egyptian god in brown quartzite, a Roman general on a triumphal arch), holding Sherlock's riding crop.
He forces an even breath; he knows he's been sluggish, detached, essentially sleepwalking through daily tasks like shaving and cooking, but this revelation suggests he's been much worse than he'd thought. Sherlock is brilliant and stubborn and sneaky — John is sure even Mycroft and Mummy had a hard time catching him as a child if he engineered a way to avoid his vegetables — but John's good with people, he's been told he's good with
Michael hummed in agreement. "A few blokes from Gryffindor tried it last night, I heard. Didn't work."
John turned so he was facing Sherlock and slid his hand forward so their fingers were touching. “No, that’s… good. I just, um, wasn’t quite sure where stood, y’know? After last night.”
Sherlock grinned, sitting down and allowing his back to fall against the grass below. “Stargazing, of course.”
The flat itself was… fascinating. Books, trinkets, clothes, a laptop, and science equipment seemed to be strewn everywhere, Max’s eyes lingering on the skull on the mantelpiece. Sherlock awkwardly tried to clear away some of the mess, making room for John to sit before remembering the others. “Uh, there is some room on the sofa, here.” He gestured, picking up a pack of nicotine patches and throwing them unceremoniously onto a nearby desk.
“In a moment I’ll get you to pair up and practice your dancing. It’ll be no good for us Hufflepuffs to embarrass ourselves on such an important night. Now, all partners are to be boy/girl, so up you get, boys. No need to be shy. Find a partner.”
Rosie chooses this moment to poke her head out the door. Her eyes light up instantly and she sprints over to where John and Sherlock are standing. “Daddy! Papa!” she yells, jumping into Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock instinctively lifts her up and spins her around, smile spreading over his face.
John nodded. “Yeah, of course I’ll be ‘right. On that note, er… I can’t really stay after curfew anymore, either.” He paused, flushing pink. “Sprout figured out I was coming back to the dorms late.”
“Michael...” Sherlock spoke slowly, as though searching for the perfect word. “Is a dick. And I’m glad you punched him.”
Mycroft’s words rang loudly in his head and Sherlock suddenly remembered his grandmother. He thought of everyone he knew and how utterly hopeless they had become upon meeting their soulmate. Sherlock didn’t like to admit it, but quite often, Mycroft was right. It really wasn’t an advantage.
This remark was met with a bout of chuckles, and John watched worriedly as Sherlock’s head shot up to stare at the student with wide eyes.
“You… Slap…” He couldn’t form any coherent words, and was painfully aware of the tremoring hand by his side. His breaths quickened, a combination of realisation, guilt and regret wracking his lungs. His mind raced with every word, every action, every moment they had shared together. He wondered how long Sherlock had known. Keeping John in the dark, waiting for the perfect opportunity like there was all the time in the world.
“Are you encouraging me to get piss drunk so that I’ll spill all my secrets?” John raised an eyebrow, attempting to wiggle it and failing miserably.
His sister, Harry, was alright though. She was a few years ahead of him at school, and as soon as she had found out what the words meant, she hadn’t hesitated to tell him.
“Okay, fair enough. So we’re ringing the old landlord. Type up the address, I’m sure there will be a number too.”
“John, John, John. Look, look here,” Sherlock’s fingers lifted to point at his nose, eyes crossing slightly in an effort to keep sight of them. “It didn’t grow. I’m not telling fibs.”
He made a startled noise as Sherlock exited and hurriedly straightened out. But Sherlock had seen it. And he had felt it too. Because in that moment, John’s throat wasn’t the only sore one. And unless the intruder had strangled John too, Sherlock could only come to one conclusion.
The movie had looked terrible. Sherlock had seen billboards advertising it around every corner. But he had been in the centre of London after a particularly boring case earlier that day, and in that spur of desperation for something new, Sherlock had seen the cinema and gone straight in. In reality, all the movies had looked equally terrible, but the comedy he’d chosen had been the most popular. Surely popular opinion couldn’t be
He’s a new face to the teachers and Rosie’s classmates. In fact, the man’s identity is a total mystery to everyone.
“Sherlock?” she had asked curiously, folding down the corner of the page she was on and closing the novel gently.
Nev smiled fondly, looking up into the camera with a knowing glance. “So,” he started, lips curved in a smirk. “You’d like to meet him, then?”
Sherlock was returned home within the day, monitored closely by one of Mycroft’s associates as the week went by. At nineteen, Sherlock was experiencing withdrawal symptoms for the first time. It briefly crossed his mind that his soulmate might be too, but there was a double murder and, well…
“So, obviously we covered a little over our call a week ago, but tell us about the nature of your relationship with William. Would you say he’s your boyfriend?”
He willed some self-control and sent the message to Lestrade, studying the phone intensely while he worked.
Sherlock smiled, enthralled by John’s bashfulness. “Boyfriends, hm? There’s a term I could get used to.”
Cedric paused suddenly, and John looked up, startled. “It was about that apprentice, Sherlock, wasn’t it?”
This prompts a loud cheer from Rosie. John groans but a grin etches his face. Rosie stands between them, one of her father’s hands in each of her own.
The drugs had initially been a pass time. An innocent recreational hobby that he partook in when bored. But soon enough they had led him to the wrong crowds, seeking – no,
“I was high approximately 90% of the time we were talking for that first two months. Living on the street, sometimes, when my landlords became tired. If we called, who knew what kind of… nonsense talk you’d be exposed to? I didn’t want you to see me in that state. Even more distasteful and intolerable than usual. I was, quite frankly, nauseating. Could you imagine if we had met then? “Oh yeah, John, come visit me in the opium den. We can have a nice cuppa laced with ketamine while we sit on the bloodstained blanket known as my bed.”” Sherlock mocked, clearly becoming more emotional the longer he talked.
The kiss was hesitant, tender, filled to brim with curiosity, and John unwillingly found himself grinning against Sherlock lips. He allowed himself to savour the sensation of being this close – this intimate – and made sure to catalogue every detail. The feeling of stubble against his cheek, his nose squished against Sherlock’s, and the way Sherlock lips seemed to linger everywhere they touched.
John wagged his finger. “No, I mean, I never did… Because, you know, Sherlock, magic is what you call, an um...”
“Don’t act daft, John. Are you seriously,” James exaggerated a shudder, “shagging that dirty squib?”
’, as John had so eloquently dubbed it, and soon enough, Sherlock was breaking into Soo Lin Yao’s apartment. He was vaguely aware of the yells filtering through the mail slot, but found it difficult to focus on John’s exact words. The spilled vase was too fascinating and apparently, despite John’s absence, he was not alone.
John shrugged. "Just don't fancy myself being thrown out of the Great Hall, thanks. Go ahead, if you want. None of us are stopping you."
, for Merlin’s sake. Apparently I’m not allowed to associate with them anymore and I’m not wanted in the dorms. Not to mention Sherlock has had to put up with constant harassment, too.”
John snorted. “Are you kidding me? Of course not. In case all those other idiots haven’t already noticed, you’re a bloody Potions genius, and your lack of magic doesn’t justify them treating you like dirt.”
Disbelief seemed to shroud John’s expression, but a tinge of hope sparked in the quirking of his lips. He was excited.
And then there was an attack on their base, and all troops had been called to action. John remembered feeling distant, as though this raid was a small obstacle one might face every day. His focus was marginal, and he took cover and shots at the enemy with the familiarity of routine. He vaguely recalled shouting – desperate yells – before a familiar singe littered his hands. John might have fallen over, if he weren’t already crouched. He stared at his hands with wide eyes, heart beating radically in his chest. They were there. His soulmate was alive and —
Three weeks into classes was when the rumour began. John wasn’t certain where, and how, it began, but as soon as it was out in the open, the whole school was immediately on board.
His feet itched to run – to sprint as far as possible away from John. As far as Sherlock could tell, John already hated the aspect of them being together. He was always the one to shut down Mrs Hudson’s comments, quite offended that someone would even consider him being anything but heterosexual. But rather than running, Sherlock simply stared. His eyes pierced into John’s for a long, silent five seconds.
In the cab, on their way back to John’s bedsit, Nev looked at John with a wide, yet curious, grin upon his face. “So… you’re looking awfully happy. How were things with Sherlock back there? We didn’t need to intervene or anything, which is a first, so Max and I are feeling a little weird, to be honest.”
“Tell me what’s wrong, Sherlock. I can’t help you if I don’t know.” Lestrade pulled his phone out of his pocket, hurriedly composing a text to Mycroft as he prompted Sherlock’s response.
The truth was, Sherlock wasn't well acquainted with relationships. Any sort – unless you counted what he had with Mycroft as a 'relationship'.
John’s eyes widened. How on earth did she know? One glance behind him and he knew the others were thinking the same. And apparently, the woman had only just noticed the cameras. “Dear me, this a surprise.” she laughed, dusting her hands against her apron. “Sherlock won’t be happy with all the attention.”
Briefly, Sherlock considered the fact that this laugh could be sounding from a thirteen year old boy, but promptly quelled the thought. It was nonsense. This was certainly the laugh of a
Max spoke up. “Tell us what’s happened since we last saw each other. You still in touch with Sherlock?”
John was fuming. After observing Sherlock’s terrified face, John opened his mouth to give those other students a piece of his mind. His efforts were unnecessary, however, because in that moment, a sharp, low voice emitted from the corner of the room. Everybody’s blood ran cold.
“Damn…” he mused, reading the homepage with fascination. “This certainly sounds like William. The way it’s written, too. Listen to this: “This is what I do: One, I observe everything. Two, from what I observe, I deduce everything. Three, when I've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how mad it might seem, must be the truth.”
He felt this way until he was fifteen, when all of a sudden the pain in his abdomen became so bad he felt the urge to vomit. He recognised the feeling. It was the feeling of being beaten and bashed, until your eyes are hazy and you can’t tell your left foot from your right. He recognised it because it was a familiar one. And Sherlock suddenly realised that although feeling the pain of his soulmate was often a nuisance, they could feel his pain too.
John went silent, staring at Sherlock with a quirk in his brow and a stern pursing of the lips. It was difficult to discern whether the detective was joking or being starkly honest with John, the only clue being the sparkle of mischief which swam in Sherlock’s eyes. After a few moments, Sherlock’s stoic façade could not be maintained, and he snorted loudly before the two of them abruptly burst out chuckling.
That night, as was tradition, the fifth-year Hufflepuff boys sat in the common room drinking Butterbeer and eating Chocolate Frogs. John was sure he was going to be sick, but tradition was tradition, and he laughed along with the rest of the boys as they recounted the day's happenings.
"You've a limp in your right leg, hence the cane, but your therapist thinks it's psychosomatic – quite correctly I'm afraid. You see, your limp is quite bad when you walk, but when you're standing still, it's like you forget it's there. Likely the result of a traumatic experience – in this case, your military service in Afghanistan. To be more specific, you were shot in the… left shoulder, I presume, and due to the intermittent tremor in your dominant hand, are unable to continue practice as a surgeon. Something which I'm quite upset you didn't inform me of before."
The current scene was all too familiar. John, seated in Sprout’s office, with another Hufflepuff fifth-year by his side.
His head shot over again, face melting with relief at the familiar large door in lieu of a wall. Breathing in deeply, John braced himself before pushing the door open, poking his head around the corner. While this room bore similarities to their usual, there were a few noticeable differences John found himself gaping at. First, all traces of the large bookshelf were gone completely. In its stead was instead another sofa on which Sherlock was currently lying, fervently playing a violin which John was certain he’d never seen before. He looked closer to gauge that Sherlock’s eyes were closed, and decidedly shut the door behind him as gently as possible.
“The truth, I suppose. But I still wanna dig up some more stuff. There’s a lot on this website and I don’t want to miss anything. Should we look up the new address? Text him ourselves?”
Max stared back, mouth hanging open in an incredulous smile. “I mean…” he started. “I doubt this is what John had in mind when William said ‘chemist.’”
Snape flicked his head towards a desk, on which sat a roll of parchment, a quill, and four dirty cauldrons. “One hundred lines followed by a squeaky clean cauldron. Continue until I dismiss you.”
The time came soon, as predicted, and before Sherlock knew it, the man was walking up the stairs and towards the exit. Sherlock started in his seat. He wasn’t prepared. He had nothing to say. He stood awkwardly from his seat, cursing silently as his forgotten box of popcorn fell from his lap and to the floor. Scurrying down to pick it up and desperately trying to tidy the mess, Sherlock lifted his gaze.
Sherlock hummed indignantly. “That’s rich, considering your mother’s a muggle. I wonder what she’d have to say about your
He had eventually circled back to Regent’s Park, and simply sat on a bench, staring wistfully into the distance. So much time had already been lost. So many years of naivety, foolishness and denial. So many years of lost love. John cursed Sherlock in his head. Why had he been so hesitant to tell John to begin with?
This came as a surprise to Sprout. And unfortunately, John hadn’t anticipated Xavier bringing it up in conversation. “Pray tell, Mr Watson, why haven’t you been in the dormitory?”
Back at their cramped hotel room, Nev let out a long sigh and slumped onto his bed. “We’ve got a tough one, Max.”
“Okay! Now, with this exact thought in mind, walk past the wall three times: ‘I wish for a room to relax.’”
John held up a hand, and couldn’t help the sarcasm from escaping. “Sorry Xavier, care to remind me what a
John had never ended up finding Sherlock. After his detention with Snape he’d looked in all their usual spots – the Room of Requirement, the Black Lake and even the Great Hall – but alas, he was nowhere to be found. John wanted to die. It was no rocket science that Sherlock didn’t have many friends, but John had let his anger get the best of him nonetheless. Their last conversation kept repeating itself in his head. How easy it would have been to say, “I’ll tell you later when Snape’s not around. It’s not important, I promise.” But instead, he’d chosen to be a massive twat, potentially chasing his best friend off forever (or an other indefinite amount of time.)
John could barely believe it was already his fifth year. Some of the people he felt like he'd met just yesterday, and though he did know many spells, there was still a lifetime's worth to be discovered. He watched jovially as the first years came flooding in, stumbling over one another as they stared at the roof in awe. The sorting was always a highlight, he thought. The raw happiness on the kids' faces as their house was called warmed something in his heart, and everyone, if you disregard Harry Potter, was usually met with utmost enthusiasm from their house members. John looked over towards the Gryffindor curiously, unsurprised to see the fourth-year golden boy being hounded with attention.
John shrugged helplessly. “Not that I know of. We only text and when I tried looking up his full name on the internet, there were tons of results but… none of them were him.”
Xavier walked out solemnly, shooting one last indecipherable look over his shoulder before closing the door behind him.
“Michael,” corrected John. But he wasn’t in the mood to talk. Why couldn’t Sherlock just understand that?
Max breathed deeply in contemplation. “I don’t know why but… something about this whole scenario makes me a little scared to text him. I bet he’d be onto us in a second.”
Lying in bed, John tried thinking about Hogwarts’ new additions, but alas, his mind kept drifting back to a certain Potions apprentice. He wondered if Sherlock would be at the feast tomorrow. So far, he hadn’t made any public appearances, but tomorrow was the Halloween Feast. Surely he ought to be there. After all, it was quite potentially, the most important day in Hogwarts’ history. Besides, Snape would surely drag him along, right? With this hope in mind, John finally succumbed to sleep, breaths even. Little did he know, this castle contentment was not to last for long.
When Sherlock was twenty four, he began to dwell on the idea of soulmates. Though he didn’t care to find them, and was perfectly content with his studies, his mind palace would continue to taunt him with a stark nothingness in its far left corner. An unknown face with an unknown name and an unknown background. He still despised the thought of them, and his frustration only built when Molly Hooper began purposefully knocking her arm on bench corners and falling over at the slightest touch.
The man looked up now, blue – no, grey – eyes staring at him intensely. “Which was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Right.” John spoke tersely. Silence dominated. The two stared at each other from across the room; Sherlock on the sofa and John by the kitchen.
John fidgeted in his chair. “Well, I believe him, of course. The amount of stuff he knows and the sorts of images he send support that, but… It’s difficult to comprehend when you’ve never heard of such a thing.”
"Yeah, but John seems to be really into this guy nonetheless. They're not together or anything yet, it seems like, but John wants to make sure everything's legit before he pursues something deeper. Should we give him a video call?"
She begins to ramble on before John can even get a word in. “John! It’s such a relief… This man here arrived before you and is claiming to be Rosie’s father. I was just about to call the police – I still can if you want? He didn’t look like he was about to leave anytime soon and could still be a threat to the children…”
The sound of a violin thundered dangerously. It might have been bothering Mrs Hudson. But Sherlock was oblivious to everything around him and merely continued to play.
“That depends,” started Sherlock, taking a small sip of his drink. “Are you going to tell me why you hit Michael?”
John buried his head into his hands. A shaky breath escaped his lips and wisped into the foggy, London air.
“Aye, too bad, Johnny!” jeered one boy from his year, Xavier, giving him a harsh slap on the shoulder. Michael sniggered beside him, and James looked as though he was tempted to join in. John kept his gaze firmly locked on the floor.
John listened in wonderment. “So I guess you’re some type of Potions genius then, huh? That’s amazing.”
“Isn’t that right, Watson?” A firm hand clapped his shoulder, and John reacted before he even had time to think. He turned sharply and shoved Xavier away from him, hands balling into fists as the boy stumbled backwards in surprise.
“Okay… so that’s kind of a relief. We know the guy most likely hasn’t stolen the picture from anywhere, but hey, anything’s possible.” Nev clicked his tongue in thought. “Should we try his name, then? John said he didn’t have any luck because of its commonality but it doesn’t hurt to double check.”
This was all so difficult. So new, yet so familiar. The mere thought of what the future could hold made John's palms sweat.
A distant memory haunted him constantly. Not of war, the cabbie, or Moriarty. But of his father, shaking him back and forth against the wall and spit flying and a ring in the back of his head.
Because standing in the hallway now was none other than Sherlock himself. He looked almost as surprised as John. An uncomfortable silence enshrouded the whole space, with Sherlock and John staring at one another as the others loitered awkwardly in the background. John had choked up, speechless, and Sherlock’s expression was indecipherable. Everyone’s silent breaths could be heard amongst the nothingness, even Mrs Hudson standing still in confusion.
“Fifty? No. Serial killer? Eh...” Sherlock trailed, waving his hand casually as though it were a possibility.
John hummed. “Yeah, I suppose. I just… I don’t really know why it began in the first place, y’know? It hasn’t really been too bad, but ever since I started hanging out with Sherlock, it’s like I’ve turned into this completely different person. They don’t even want to associate with me anymore. And they don’t even
But it wasn’t for another two hours. He entered the flat with dripping hair and a face flushed from the cold. Sherlock was curled up on the sofa and facing the wall. He didn’t turn around upon hearing the door.
Max and Nev shook hands with John once more, thanked him for the tea, before departing the bedsit with their camera crew in tow.
Which is practically what he did over the next two weeks. At every opportunity given, which included after classes, lunchtimes and weekends, Sherlock and John would meet either in the Room of Requirement or beneath a tree by the Black Lake, wrapped in each other’s arms and hidden from speculating eyes. Sometimes they simply talked, about their childhoods, their interests and people they knew. Often, John would ask Sherlock to deduce those around them, watching with enraptured eyes as Sherlock unravelled life stories and secrets with a simple glance. And other times, which had become a personal favourite of John’s, they simply kissed for what seemed to be hours on end. The kisses were slow and languid some days, fervent and zealous the next. John favoured them both equally, simply content to be secured in Sherlock’s embrace.
“Have I ever told you how amazing you are?” he slurred, leaning back in the armchair and allowing his feet to slide forward. At some point in the night, their shoes had been disposed off, and John revelled in the comfort his woollen socks provided.
Sherlock couldn’t yet tell if he was alone or accompanied by someone else – the cinema was packed like sardines. But the credits would be rolling soon and Sherlock would have a complete, unobscured view.
overexcited at the prospect, because upon lighting his first Bunsen burner to record the burning time of different types of paper, Sherlock had immediately singed two fingers. He huffed indignantly, blowing on the burn before returning his gaze to the microscope before him.
“Hey there.” he grinned, smiling up at Sherlock. “Bit of drama for your first appearance here, aye?”
“So maybe… This is more to do with the fact that you’ve chosen someone else over them as a friend. It’s probably a blow to their pride because they’re your housemates and he’s just a Potions apprentice who, em, can’t do magic.” Molly paused, unsure. “The whole idea of him being a squib and you wanting to hang out with him… they can’t comprehend it without justifying it some other way, hence the slurs about sexuality.”
His rehabilitation and abstention had been one of the hardest experiences of Sherlock’s life, so when he was finally allowed to return to his usual experiments and crime solving, Sherlock was on cloud nine.
Sherlock sniffed, purposely avoiding the persistent glare of the lenses. “I am in fact clean.” He began slowly, fiddling with his hands. “But when we first started talking – when you were in Afghanistan – I was… far from it. It was a difficult time of my life. I often—” Sherlock paused. “I’m sorry. This is just quite difficult with everyone here.”
Mike described in detail about the layout of where everything is, the rules that apply and the unspoken rules among the boys. "Each side you've got a room, one side of the room has two beds bunked with two desks side by side. Every room has their own bathroom, thankfully, and with a first aid kit inside the cabinet. Lights out by ten, we go to town every Sunday, and most importantly, you don't snitch on anyone."
Sherlock looked to find John around the room and found him already staring at him from his desk. He mouthed 'thank you' and got a beaming grin in response. Sherlock stuck the cards in his basket and continued with maths. He already had ideas, later John would find cards in his jacket pocket with no idea how they got there.
As his mother consoles him Sherlock looks up at her as he remembers the events from today. "I made a new friend! His name is John and he gave me a juice box. And he said that he liked my name!" Sherlock exclaims happily. He giggles lightly at the thought of a new friend.
His mother bend down to hug her son. "I know darling but you need to be more careful." She tenderly runs a hand down Sherlock's face. "They don't see it as self-defense, listen. I know you're trying your best, okay? I know."
An announcement sounded on an old intercom in the corner of the train "Stop thirteen, from London to Makanshire. Please exit." John heaved his heavy luggage and hobbled off the car, up the stairs and into the empty streets ready to hail a cab.
He walked along the path that went through the heart of the whole setting. In the middle it had a small fountain with benches surrounding it. When John sat down on one, he could see straight through two buildings that showed the front gates. Parked there was a fancy looking van with people around it. They were unloading bags from the trunk so John figured this was a student arriving late.
"We've got newbies in the past before but never in our year so I'm happy to see you," Mike spoke as he climbed up the stairs. John took note of his friend's husky build and muscles that had appeared from the years of rugby.
It was quite prestigious and he had been surprised that they considered him at all to walk among the grounds. A vase in a hallway probably costed more than the family car.
Fifteen minutes later the cab pulled into a graveled driveway, passing two marvelous iron gates that were towering over them. As soon as the car stopped outside of the crumbling walls that led into the estate itself, John eagerly toppled out, nearly tripping over himself. The cabbie opened the rear and helped him gather his luggage up, kindly offering to help John all the way to where he needed to go.
John took all of this in stride as they became closer to his room. The way the room was set up didn't seem to bother him much by the way Mike had explained it. He was thankful for his own private bathroom, well him and his roommate's bathroom. From the sound of it, John had a feeling that he would do just fine here, a small glimmer of hope.
"Oh really? That's great, yeah thanks." John turned around and proceeded to gather some of his luggage and follow Mike up the grand staircase to the student's rooms.
"Yes I'm aware," the boy snapped. He stood with his back turned towards John and Mike, currently occupied with setting up his clothing within his wardrobe.
Mike looked at John in apology. "I guess he isn't here at the moment," he reasoned. Mike roamed over to the doorway with his body halfway out. "I guess you'll meet him later then, yeah? I suppose I'll let you get settled in. Good luck with everything."
He hiked his knapsack higher on his shoulder to avoid pain. While trying to balance his sports bag on top of his suitcase, John attempted to open the front door with full hands but failed in doing so. It wouldn't have worked anyway, there had to be a passkey for it.
After looking through six more pictures of some dreadful trees with a horrible filter covering it, he considered taking a walk.
He wasn't surprised to find no card in his basket. He hadn't even made the effort of decorating it. Though he was a little hurt, not that he was let anyone know that. What came as a surprise though, is what happened during their maths session.
John was speechless. That boy's voice was so deep yet he was so skinny, it didn't match him.  Nothing matched him, his hair was too curly for his head; when he turned around to face John he noticed that his eyes were a striking blue but couldn't place exactly what color. His skin was so pale, it looked sickly as if he weren't taking care of himself properly.
He sits down and opens his box to strawberries and bananas. Sherlock was the only one who ate alone, or so he thought. "Can I eat with you?" a voice asked. It made Sherlock look up because he was sure this boy was not talking to him. No one ever talks to him. He had blond hair, clear blue eyes, and a friendly open smile. "Can I?" he asks again.
They made it to the top of the staircase, finally, and continued down a corridor of doors on both sides. Some doors were open, some were not yet John could hear the familiar rumble of boy's laughter ring throughout the hall.
Walking into the foyer, he noticed that it seemed to be newly refurbished but still exuded an air of sophistication. A grand staircase reached up into the second floor no doubt leading to the student's rooms, to his left there were two adjoining rooms, a small kitchenette and what seems to be a spacious common room.
Sherlock blinks repeatedly as if to process that sentence. "S-sure." The boy sits in the chair next to him and he pulls out a ham sandwich with animal biscuits and two juice boxes.
That makes Sherlock smile as everyone called his name weird, and it made him smile even more when John him his second juice box. It was apple.
Also, if this school was considered posh and a person could embody that poshness, it was Sherlock. The school let students wear their regular clothing but Sherlock adorned a suit, probably designer, a charcoal grey jacket with the same color trousers and a white dress shirt underneath.
"Happy to be here," John huffed out. He felt his shoulder sag under the weight of his backpack but ignored it and walked on.
Curiosity finally got the best of him as to who his roommate was. He decided to ask Mike, he might know. "Say, do you know who I'm rooming with?"
"Oh, is that so? Well tell him he's welcome over anytime." She tries not to sound so surprised. "Now darling, why don't you go put your bag upstairs and Mrs. Hudson and I will make honeycakes, alright?" As her son runs upstairs, Mrs. Holmes makes a mental note to get John's mother's number.
John had thought because he is now farther away from home that his sessions with Ella would decrease but that hasn't been the case. Instead of twice a week it has been moved up to three times a week; Sunday, Wednesday, and Saturday. It's not that he doesn't think he needs it because John knows very well that he needs therapy. But this will be his third year and while he and Ella have come a long way he has danced with progress for quite some time.
Thankfully a few students noticed his struggle and opened the door for him. He muttered a quick thank you and dragged his luggage in behind him. He would have to make a point to get a passkey.
John could see Mike visibly wince. Was he that bad? He stopped walking and turned around to face him. He set down the bags he was carrying and took a deep breath in. He seemed hesitant to talk but decided to anyway.
John laughed incredulously. What could make him so terrible of a roommate? "What, does he perform crazy experiments like a mad scientist?" John joked.
He held out his hand for John to take it. "Sherlock Holmes. Apologies for the inconvenience of roommate choice."
He tried not think of recent events that have affected him greatly but it pushed its way into his conscience. The divorce, his dad leaving and never really looking back. The sudden but not really new happening of his mum's drinking. Guilt grew in John's stomach, making him almost physically sick. How could he leave his mum? In a time like this? What kind of son was he? He felt himself already spiraling down a path that was hard to walk out of.
John faced the window and looked at the rolling hills pass by as the city life faded into the background. His bags filled the empty seat beside him, a sign to any new passenger in the train that it's best if he's left alone. He tried to remember the last time he had even been in the countryside but no memory came up.
It sat across room twenty two which were both located at the end of the hall. The door also had a mini white board attached in the corner, it had a marker but it was blank. John noticed that while the other doors had at least some stickers or writing, this door had none of the sort.  Mike gave an anxious glance before opening the door.
"She—" John started. But his eyes tracked where she was, where her hands were, back across the floor. Mary felt herself tense further when his eyes caught, and hung, on the takeaway bag with Sherlock's soup. Upright. Unspilled.
I raised an eyebrow — it wouldn't do to laugh — and Sherlock rolled his eyes. I knew what I was doing, could see Sherlock himself was more amused than annoyed — the set of his shoulders, the faint crinkling of his nose.
. Is that the two of you...Sherlock, I asked you not to be dead. Mary, I asked you to marry me. You both gave me what I wanted. This is—" He threw his hands up helplessly, paced two steps toward the sofa and then back again. "Look, I find it difficult. I find it difficult, this sort of stuff."
The computer makes a delighted beeping noise echoed by Sherlock's "Ah!" of excitement — and the arrival of Sherlock's overenthusiastic pathologist, the one John heard so many comments about during the Black Lotus case. She hurries around to look at Sherlock's results on the computer and John steps behind Sherlock, out of her way, blinking.
Mary bit her lip, thinking about John, bitterly tangled up in all their dishonesty. Would her past self had chosen differently, come clean with John early in realizing how deeply she'd fallen for him, if she'd known about the heartbreaking lie Sherlock had still been acting out at the time? And the lies the rest of John's world had told him on Sherlock's behalf? Could she have?
"John, we've lied to you, and lied to ourselves that we were hiding things in your best interest. We've been selfish. You needed all the relevant information to make sound decisions, and we've kept it from you. Our reasons don't matter." She felt Sherlock try to withdraw and squeezed his hand, encouragingly. "We were wrong."
thoroughly, just changed enough superficial details to evade reporters, well-meaning acquaintances, and any remaining enemies who
When she'd last stood here, both the kitchen and sitting room doors had been open, light drifting dustily through the flat, but today both were closed tight, crowding the landing with near-darkness. A scrawl of yellow chalk
Taking refuge in pure logic, keeping his thoughts strictly on the case, providing no stimulus from his private life for the drug to distort: exactly what he's been trying to do, since his pre-dawn realisation that yesterday's fear (grit on the lens, doubting his senses, losing his mind) had been exaggerated by some narcotic.
Sherlock's lips curve just a little in return, even as he dismissively flicks a crumb off his chin. "Totally mundane."
"Anything else pager-related?" Sherlock holds a second biscuit between his teeth while his fingers comb the rest of his pile but he's already shaking his head. John tucks the papers in and drops the envelope into the box unsealed.
Normal, for the marks to fade with time; highly variable, as much as love itself. Normal too, more often than not, for the daily actions and emotions of bondmates to kindle fresh marks to replace the faded, always unpredictable in form, fashion, and especially time-frame. No science has ever been able to predict the when and where, no ritual has ever been found to force the hand of "heaven".
But this situation is too complicated, and he isn't dealing with someone he can cajole back into bed, he's dealing with
John pulls Sherlock through the kitchen (paint experiment, list of Semtex tracking additives, lingering Orange Pekoe — must be out of Earl Grey) and down the hall (John's sweat: strong, came this way after his run) — he's been stupid, careless with the evidence but John's been shaken, blind, not himself; Sherlock needs to stop Moriarty
"He must have drawn his own conclusions about my actions. And he knew when I started using an alternate identity we set up together a long time ago — the associated bank account never ran dry. But we haven't spoken."
Tread heavy, slept late again, trainers, sweatshirt. Regent's Park. Safe this time of day? Reasonably. But away from CCTV, on the inner circle — needs to stay on the perimeter. Doesn't need reminding. Considering a haircut, might stop at the barber's after run; unlikely but factor into estimated length of absence.
He pivots back to face Sherlock, eyes sweeping the room (appalling watercolour of Bellever Tor, door to the en suite ajar, lights on in there as well) before his gaze settles on Sherlock's face. Even with the fear-drug lingering in his system, he's far too tense —
"When did you last eat?" John asks, worried but detached, fingertips smoothing more cream over a diamond of welts below his shoulder blade.
"We're not having this conversation in the middle of the road. The house is up this way. Give me your pack and come on."
John releases Sherlock's wrist and stands up; he doesn't know how to interpret the sharp not-quite pain bunching the muscles in his back and shoulders. There's no point in repeating himself; Sherlock knows his frustration at being left behind and can undoubtedly deduce what John would have spared him — if he had been allowed.
, in some as-yet-unexplained way, when emotional bonds have become genuine and deep between paramours, and idiot sentimentalists (who call the imprints left behind by the kindling power
The all-too-knowing stranger reaches for his hand; John pulls it back, trying to keep the threat from collapsing into a fist, warns "
"I haven't thrown you out on your ear." John fills the pot with water and sets it on the cooker to boil. With a glance at Sherlock's hunched form at the table, he steps around the cat to open the lower cabinet nearest the refrigerator; when he pulls out the pasta he discovers a jar of handmade sauce, with a label that says "from Angelo's" in Lestrade's sloppy handwriting. Small reconciliations, this past Christmas.
He settles on the couch, which is a mistake; Mycroft switches his attention from his "intransigent" brother to John. Soon enough, John has a handful of eyes-only file and an earful of tortured violin.
He looked to her, his chest struggling to rise and fall evenly. "I have always needed John. I needed him even before I met him. I always will."
The suggestion works better than John had hoped; Sherlock stretches out on his side at the edge of the bed where he can point at one significant item after another. The papers had been neutral — John has to force a more clinical mindset to stop himself recoiling from things like the pallid earbud, identical to the one Moriarty had inserted so repulsively into his ear canal.
Sherlock's skin contracts with a muted ripple of pain and dismay, and he turns his head away, ear and temple lying against his folded arms. John's taken the time to prove to him, scientifically, that he needs to eat more often than he does, but it slows him down in more ways than one and he's simply had no appetite
Even so, they don't need long to gather bags full of "M's background," and "M's wardrobe", and "Jim from IT", while tossing all the "irrelevants" — like the croquet ball — into Sherlock's laundry basket.
They settle back down on opposite sides of the table, in a warmer silence, more like those they'd sometimes shared at Angelo's after the end of a case.
The headache is not yet gone, but is fading beneath the dullness of the medication; he paces briskly back and forth in front of the sliding doors, focusing himself on the real world, on those things he knows how to attack. He opens the door.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I've thought so often about this day, I gave myself three rules. Start with my apology. Shut up and listen. Don't be clever."
." Sherlock catches himself, drags his hands away from his eyes and lets them fall from his face. He curls both palms around the warmth of the mug but doesn't look up. "I hoped you would. I knew Mycroft would, if you passed it on to him. I had to trust that the two of you would know best when to share it with the others, if they hadn't worked it out themselves." He presses his thumb against the rim of the mug until the tip blanches white.
"Shut up!" Sherlock barked, hands coming to cradle his bowed head. John turned so he could see Mary, still gripping Sherlock's wrist. "Shut up, just — just. I need to think."
brother, anyway; however childish the Holmes spats are, or however mulish his own, they won't end in murder. He looks down at his hands.
"Either way. Words we need to have aside. We can't change the past. Any of our pasts. But I would very much like for us to write our futures — all our futures — together."
"You asked for soup," she said, holding up the take-away bag, pushing the door further open with her foot. The sitting room looked rearranged, ransacked, chaos and intrusion making her head hurt. Strange empty spaces, heaps of obsession starting on the floor and climbing up the walls on string: papers, pictures, maps…
Sherlock has turned his head enough that John can see his eyes, shadowed but catching again on the stacks of paper on the chest, the scattered detritus by the wardrobe: the overwhelming puzzle dragging his mind back to full speed. John's body feels heavy with sympathetic fatigue. Sherlock rarely takes proper care of his physical needs but he has to know he's diminishing his own efficiency by driving so hard.
Jesus, what is he thinking? This is a bad idea, John tells himself, very bad, worse than letting Harry take him on his first pub crawl.
He hasn't been this close to tears since the graveside. Doesn't know if the urge is driven by relief or rage or some mix of the two, or if he's been caught off-guard by the exhaustion that can rise when a vigil nears its end.
John takes a generous bite, and the heavenly smell of the sauce blossoms into a rich melange of flavours, even better than he remembers from Angelo's restaurant. The cat curls around his ankles, begging for his attention.
John stiffens under his scrutiny; fatigue, frustration highlighted in the planes of his face, casting shadows of some more difficult-to-define emotion before he tries to hide his tells once more.
"You don't get to say that to me again," John snarled coldly, taking two swift strides toward Sherlock, who took a step closer to Mary, ending up in the empty space where the red chair had once been. John stopped in his tracks, making a triangle of tension between them.
is the word that comes to him and it fits, he's doorless, exposed. One desolate breath. "I can't — thinking, words, I can't stop..."
Silence: like the space between the lightning in my bones and the thunder in my veins. He pinned me without touching, hands on the door to either side of my arms, face turned away but mouth close enough I could feel his breath passing over my ear. Some of those dark curls brushed, ticklish, against my cheek, and I wanted to free my arms, tug him closer, tangle my fingers in his hair.
Sherlock eyes him suspiciously; John focuses on projecting 'doctor' above all else. On wanting Sherlock to rehydrate, to sit down before he falls down, on wanting to have an entirely clinical look at his back. After an encounter like this, John always needs to inspect — half healer's instinct and half devilish pride in his handiwork — and if he were dealing with someone else, John might be intimate and playful about it. Tease the injured skin, tease his partner, tease the possibility of more.
"Sherlock?" Light fingertips touch Sherlock's unmarked shoulder, and he shudders. John (still fully dressed, sweating again,
"There were too many things I witnessed that you simply couldn't have arranged. Or anticipating and arranging them would have required as much cleverness as you were supposed to be faking.
"So no, I never believed you were a fraud." He gazes down at the boiling water and slowly roiling pasta, neck and spine still bunched with tension. "Doubting myself, doubting whether the message was really there, having no clue why you'd stay away, stay
A part of John wants to hold his ground, bar Jim's passage, but he doesn't know why — the flirtatious fawning is only discomfiting, not threatening, and he has no idea what the shadows might mean. Stepping back, John gives Molly a bewildered look — the lines of the Entanglements in his peripheral vision
A kiss, a conflagration, a surreal blend of urgency and willpower; an act I'd once dismissed as inherently uninteresting, not part of my identity. Irene had asked me to look past definitions, look at
John pushes the bedroom door open, opinions packed dense and tight behind his lips, unreadable, unguessable. Sherlock's internal palace is in chaos, jolted by explosives, and what he understands of John's expressions and moods is as jumbled as the riot of research (Barts' hiring practices, earbud distributors) and half-finished projects (Vivienne Westwood fabric samples, flash drives full of Dublin accents) spread across his bed and floor.
John looks back up at Sherlock, and the urge to start giggling again probably isn't the best sign, as far as that goes.
The truth could never set her free, but it might be the only chance she had left to defend the relationships she cared about.
So hard to read Sherlock's empty tone, to guess at whether his 'old resentments' against his brother have been mellowed with need, or pulled painfully tight like the ones John has borne since his last conversation with Mycroft, before the fall.
He switches the kettle on and reaches up to pull two mugs from the cabinet. It's only when he sets them on the counter John realizes he's snagged them, automatically, with his right hand. His left isn't shaking anymore but the rest of him wants to and he braces rigidly against the lip of the counter with both hands, jaw working against the resurgent hot fury burning up from the pit in his chest. Nearly impossible to contain now he's not looking Sherlock in the eye.
He prefers to touch only on his own terms, offers his hand sharply, horizontal and tense; watches the man's long, elegant fingers wrap around his own for less than a second, measuring something known only to him. Can't help noticing he possesses a healthy Entanglement, wrapping in an easy curl around his finger and stretching out to someone not present, as clear in the dimly lit warehouse as it would be in the daylight.
Black Lotus, needs to check how long Moriarty's had connections with China, if it goes back as far as Carl Powers... Stop. Back. Cargo volume. Seasonal fluctuations. Correlate with weather. Filter again. The piece he needs is here somewhere, he knows it is.
And realized her mistake even as she pushed hard with her foot to get her whole body behind the cover of the bare wall behind the pocket for the sliding door: she'd have done better to set the soup down slow, rise up with hands raised. Or to freeze altogether. Like she'd never seen a gun.
"Sherlock," John said. "Did you forget? 'There's always something.' So, here it is: I did shave for you."
Less often, recently, with the black gone to less eye-catching shades of gray: battleship, slate, ashes, ashes....
He is utterly still, though. Not a twitch, not a single sardonic comment. His eyes aren't flicking about, vibrating with his thoughts, chasing from John's hand around the riding crop to his shoulder to his thigh to his shoes and back again; they're pinned solely on John's face.
Sherlock threw himself onto the couch, still in his coat, and the springs squeaked in a tired minor third; I would have wagered he could reproduce the notes for me on the violin if I asked. My own sense of pitch is relative, not perfect.
Sherlock's brother studies him with frowning consternation, as if he'll find reasons in John's expression for the defiance of his expectations. As if he would understand those reasons when he sees them. As if Mycroft believes he should simply be able to gather all the scattered toys from Sherlock's nursery floor, and put everything back to rights for him.
When Sherlock wakes, John will wait for him to break the silence. He's not likely to be in any shape to talk about what they've done, at first, but sooner or later they'll have to.
turns out to be, John wants in. He might not be part of the tangled interdependent web he can perceive in crimson bits and pieces, but he will damn well do his small part — whatever that might be — to protect it for everybody else.
One day. She'd had one precious day to see them working a case together, see Sherlock's magic in action, and John just as bold and brilliant beside him, always right where he was needed. Then they'd vanished together into a clandestine Underground station, solved the crime, saved Parliament, and come back to the surface impenetrably separate.
John's gaze traces from Sherlock's mouth back up to his eyes for an eternity, a whirlwind of his own spinning somewhere inside, until his tongue teases his lower lip and he settles again. A faint deepening of crow's feet and the lines on his forehead. A hesitation of trust before he yields, with a quirk of the eyebrow, softening from stone to flesh beneath Sherlock's cupping palm.
He glances across the table at Sherlock. Their eyes meet. And then the light of mischief glitters in Sherlock's tired eyes, blossoming quickly into a broad, honest smile. John smiles in return and in a heartbeat they're laughing.
, Royal China Club, night before last), Sherlock murmurs automatically, far more interested in reasoning out why none of John's girlfriends seem the
"Sherlock," she said, to both pairs of eyes, her own voice broken and wrong. "Let me tell him. Please."
John looked at Sherlock, tense. Seeking the promised verification, she thought. Not trusting his own judgment, not even wanting to trust Sherlock's; not able to trust her words or, presumably, the look on her face. Sherlock, for his part, appeared locked into place — merciless eyes still first and foremost watching for danger to John, and searching for clues in her face, her elbows held apart from her sides, the navy socks she'd thought were black when she'd grabbed them in the dark, the ragged part in her hair.... The gun wobbled downward half an inch, but she might as well have been nailed to the floor for all the difference it made.
"You found me. He knows where I am." John keeps his statements short, the words clipped. Giving Mycroft as little to read as possible.
For a few minutes, Sherlock dares to hope for sleep, one of those sweet, gratifying moments when pleasure trumps the need to push himself to exhaustion to silence his brain, but too much has been laid bare, he has too much to consider and reconsider. John needs sleep, will need space to do his own considering. With practised care, Sherlock pulls away to slide out of the bed.
Inside, John distantly listens to Sherlock brush off the DI's questions about who his companion is — and even if John hadn't seen his photograph in the paper he'd be sure Lestrade is the DI; he has a quiet air of command John recognizes and responds to. The only problem with looking was he'd never learned how to easily shut it down again; Lestrade's Entanglement flashes bright and strong through his wedding ring as he reaches for crime scene gloves.
Sherlock shakes his head, and his fingertips twitch, just a little, shifting the tendon beneath John's fingers. "I'm not stupid, John. You think I want to incapacitate myself
"There is literally no amount of money in the world that could convince me to work for Magnussen. He knows who I was. He knows where we live, so he can pass that along to anyone who might want me dead. He let me know at our bloody
Sherlock lowers his chin, reaches out slowly until his fingertips just brush the crest of John's cheekbone, watches John's eyes startle, track, harden: doesn't want Sherlock to evade the issue, now that it's out in the open; can't permit the enchantment of touch to soften him into a forgiveness Sherlock hasn't earned; won't allow Sherlock to think this is a proper prelude to an apology.
So many times John has demonstrated his own form of whip-sharp perception; known, without being told, when Sherlock needs his frustration transmuted to focus, distraction to calm, mania to peace. Known, without being asked, how to tie him up, tie him down until his rocketing mind runs smooth and placid. How to still him with sensation.
strands tied around her finger, redder than — well, there is no earthly comparison. Red and flawless and bound up in one of the tidiest knots John has ever seen...rare, to see the sign of a perfect triad. Sherlock is right about the sex. Wrong about it being a clandestine affair.
He stepped closer, just an inch or so, and touched his fingers under the tip of my chin. Patinas of blue and green darkened the silver eyes fixed on mine, all his attention and all his determination balanced on a single fulcrum.
"Sherlock," he says, hoarse from holding back his cries and therefore somewhat gruff. He clears his throat.
Sherlock's work is done, for now. Despite the hard row John knows lies ahead for forgiveness, to rebuild trust, they are
John sets the crop aside and leans over Sherlock on the bed. He draws light fingers down slowly between his brows, counting on unconscious reflexes to pull his eyelids down. When John takes his hand away, Sherlock's eyes remain closed. Protecting Sherlock from getting chilled wins the debate over leaving the painful welts bare; John tugs the duvet upward, settles it over him as gently as he can, then strokes Sherlock's hair until his breathing finishes settling into the rhythms of sleep.
After an uncomfortable moment, Sherlock looks down. John realises, with a faint flush, that his fingers are still clamped tightly around Sherlock's wrist.
The physical clamour of his body drowns out the mental, and it's what he wanted before but he hates the pointless tagalong emotions that cocaine has left behind, crackling like static, sapping his will even as they spur and scatter his restless mind. He itches to get up and move again, at the same time he aches to close his eyes.
"How long has it been since he's reached out?" she asked, simply. She and John were equally stubborn on some points but if she could just get him to
Mary hadn't a hand free to cover her smile, sad and hopeful; Sherlock's harsh little bark of a laugh served them both. The hand that gripped hers shook like an old man's, though — the last dregs of Sherlock's energy, his temporary cocktail of adrenaline and emotion and his drug of choice fading and leaving precious little behind. She looked at John, who stretched out his hand, palm up, just above Sherlock's.
Sherlock finally looks at him again, and now John recognizes the flatness in his silver eyes, the haunted awareness that every fighting soldier eventually acquires. He wishes, not for the first time, he knew what alchemy turns that realisation to steel in some and acid in others.
As she climbed the voice grew clearer — not the telly; Sherlock Holmes' voice, his low baritone half-rumble and half-roar, and before she could consciously pick out the words, the rhythm told her he was reciting Shakespeare.
Then she stepped inside, knocked again on the open door, and paused to listen. Still no answer from Mrs Hudson on the ground floor, just a loud voice from above — something declamatory on the television? She stepped inside uneasily and headed up the stairs. She'd been to 221B only twice — the chill night John had disappeared and she'd come for Sherlock's help and, after they'd rescued him, the following morning when they'd returned seeking answers to who the
Yet Sherlock's eyes are so bleak when he looks up that everything in John freezes; his voice is so quiet: "I was trying to be your friend, John. But it all went wrong."
Alerted by the sound of wood-on-wood, John opens the door before Sherlock can reach it, but he stands firmly athwart the brightly-lit entry, arms folding across his chest. Registering his objection, because he's hopeless that way.
"Just — stop. You two both think you can protect me by running away from me? No. Mary, you say you've been on a battlefield? Worked in a team?"
"'Friends protect people,'" Sherlock says finally, and hearing his own words, the last angry thing he said to Sherlock's face before they were separated by the four-story gulf of that terrible final act, is excruciating.
Sherlock yanks his hand back as if burned, and John stumbles two steps backward. Not ready for this, how could he have thought he'd be prepared...
But no matter how many newspapers, log books, crime reports, and other mounds of data Sherlock chews through for hidden clues, or how many pads of graph paper he fills with notes while John dozes, he has unearthed no sign of Moriarty, and Sherlock hasn't
"Stay where you are, John," Sherlock's deadly voice trembled where his hand gripping the enormous Smith & Wesson 629 did not.
She'd rather stay with them, learn the edges of this new shape the three of them could form. But not if it meant giving Magnussen a shot at John and Sherlock.
John pushes to his feet, rubs uneasily at the back of his neck to loosen both the muscles and the sweat-stuck hair irritating his skin — he needs a haircut.
Realisation dawned on John like a wave – engulfing him completely and leaving him shivering with shock. Although nobody was trying to tear
Sherlock took a slight breath. “Well,” he began. “It’s obvious you all suspected me when you first showed up at the door. John, after you looked at my face, your eyes immediately went down to my hands, presumably to gauge if they were shaking. You’re a medical man – you’d be able to tell within a few moments if you suspected I was high. Thankfully, for everyone, we both know I’m not.”
Sherlock nodded the affirmative, wide eyes still locked on John. “What you did just then… with the um, spell… that was good. Yes, quite good.”
Allowing his eyes to linger on Sherlock’s face a moment longer, John then shifted from his position on the floor and made move to the opposite side of the room.
John nodded. “I can’t put my finger on it but he just gives me a weird feeling. He teaches us some really fucked up spells, too.”
Molly Hooper, a quiet girl the year below John, spoke up softly. "An apprentice? I didn't know Hogwarts allowed them."
He balled his hands into fists nervously. “Yeah, right, um… Just a little tired, lads. Don’t think this chocolate sits well with me. Sorry to be a let down.”
A comfortable silence encompassed them in that moment, and John was perfectly content to just lie beside Sherlock and listen to their synchronised breathing. He couldn’t quite recall when he’d last been this calm, and revelled in Sherlock’s presence. Very briefly, the thought of taking Sherlock’s hand in his crossed John’s mind, but he hurriedly stowed it away and berated himself internally.
What the hell do you mean, ‘this has everything to do with me.’? I can’t bloody read your mind, okay? Just… Tell me what you’re on about and then we can finally move on and forget—”
And with that, before John could even utter a word, Sherlock had grasped John’s hand tightly and was dragging him back towards the castle. Their legs moved quickly up the stairs, ignoring the few passersby who gave them odd looks. “Sherlock,” John puffed, “where on earth are we going?”
He didn’t particularly understand why he’d offered his phone to the man. They weren’t friends – he didn’t owe him anything. But there was a pull in his gut, something akin to obligation, which made him do it. The man thanked him and took the phone from John’s grasp.
John watched Sprout’s demonstration carefully, placing his hands on Molly’s waist. “Hm? Oh, yeah, of course.”
Sherlock surveyed him closely, disregarding the employee. He’d been injured at war – that much was obvious. But was the cane really necessary? Sherlock thinned his lips.
Neither had any idea of what to do. They were seated the same as they were. An hour had passed in tense silence and it was getting late. Sherlock shifted in his seat before finally standing up. He nodded to John in goodnight and moved to retire to his bedroom. He was almost there, halfway down the hall, when John called out.
“Of course, yeah. Max and I were actually thinking... Maybe you should go ahead first and we’ll trail behind. It’s one thing to have someone you’ve been talking to online suddenly turn up at your home, but a whole camera crew? A bit much.”
“Oh, well… In that case.” Sherlock jumped up eagerly to join John in brushing his teeth, the toilet by which he previously sat vanishing in an instant.
Shouldn't John have sparked with joy? Exclaimed how happy he was and that this 'was everything he'd ever wanted.' That's how Sherlock had imagined the scene unfolding, anyway. But dreams weren't realities. Dreams were nightmares in disguise.
John wouldn’t admit it, but he felt a pang of something when Sherlock’s face shone at his words. The subtle widening of the eyes, the gentle caress of rouge against his cheeks.
The curious faces of many children peek out from behind the blinds. Sherlock tries to see if he can catch Rosie but she’s nowhere to be seen.
Nev nodded, pleased, and glanced back at Max who nodded enthusiastically. Nev looked back to Sherlock. “If that’s alright with you? Some of the crew can stay with the car so it’s less cramped.”
That was how Lestrade had found him one hour later. He’d given the door a rapt knock before entering, calling Sherlock’s name with the usual urgency. “Sherlock, I’ve got a case for you – a triple homicide!”
Snape harrumphed nonchalantly, rolling his eyes and redirecting his gaze back to the pile of essays on his desk. Making his way over awkwardly in an attempt to appear inconspicuous, Sherlock’s head peaked over to study what John was writing, eyes widening in disbelief.
“And you can do so once the both of you have calmed down and collected yourselves. The faster you finish your detention the faster you can go find him. So
He was tempted. Merlin, was he tempted. But he simply couldn’t bring himself to say it, and instead shook his head. “He can stay then, I guess.”
"All good, John, just teasing." laughed Nev, shifting to Max a subtle wink. "Well, you seem to have a pretty interesting case on your hands. How would you feel about Max and I coming to visit you in London?"
The four of them, followed by one other cameraman and a crew member holding a microphone, made the trek upstairs. John leaned heavily on his cane, despite Sherlock’s reassurances that ‘he didn’t need it’, and looked positively nervous at the circumstances.
Sherlock looked away. An unfamiliar emotion clouded his face. John thought it might have been shame. “How so?” he prompted.
Sprout shook her head, disappointed. “I hate to do this, really, but I’m taking 50 points from Hufflepuff for these disturbing enlightenments. After I’ve finished with you both, I want all you boys to sit down among each other and sort this out. It’s immature, selfish and it’s obviously crippling our sense of house unity. Rogers, you are dismissed, but John – I’d like you to stay back and have a word.”
Sherlock’s eyes lifted from the page he had been staring at for the past twenty minutes. “A soulmate? Surely you’ve heard of them.”
John diverted his gaze. He was equally as confused as the rest, but didn’t fancy laying all the blame on Potter. He seemed to be the most shocked of them all – almost as though he didn’t want to enter the tournament or had never entered to begin with. Looking around, John’s eyes immediately fell to a figure by the head table who appeared to be staring right at him. Squinting his eyes, John’s face erupted with joy upon realisation. He slipped out of his seat hurriedly, ignoring Michael’s cries of protest.
“It’s not… It’s not terrible. So far, it seems like everything William has told you, other than his name, is true. But we managed to get a hold of William’s, well, Sherlock’s old landlord. You might know this, for all we know, but it came as a bit of a shock to us. Apparently he’s, er, quite involved with drugs.”
With this unfortunate wake up call and a lack of coherent conversation the night prior, John was unsure of where their relationship stood, but apparently, he wasn’t to be concerned. Sherlock had awoken soon after, eyes bleary but concerned, and had immediately stood to fetch some water and rub John’s back. No words were spoken between them, but the silence was companionable, and John understood that Sherlock was likely feeling as crook as he was.
“Alright. You honestly look really torn about all this, John, so how does this sound? Ten points from Hufflepuff and an evening detention with Professor Snape?”
The laugh was high-pitched – it didn’t suit the man’s façade. This man was short albeit broad shouldered. He held himself with a strong composure which commanded authority, harboured a slight tan and a tame haircut.
The results, as they anticipated, were minimal, with many being off topic entirely. Max looked disappointed. “Do you think he’s made the job up?”
“Probably, yeah… Let’s have a look at the new address then.” Nev reopened Google and typed in the address displayed on the website’s homepage.
“Now, as a ball, it is traditional – but not compulsory – for every attendee to have a partner. This event is for fourth years and above, but younger year levels are permitted if invited by an older student.”
“Mm, I can recall a few occasions, yes.” Sherlock grinned, dopey. His feet moved to meet John’s, entwining somewhere in the middle.
Sherlock’s eyes opened and Lestrade reeled at the influx of emotions presented in them. It was so unlike Sherlock to display any part of himself so willingly, and he almost felt guilty witnessing it. His hands weakly gestured to his left shoulder, the tremor in them too strong to do much else.
Sherlock seemed lost for a few moments, staring at the large crowd. “I gathered.” he spoke eventually. “Would you, um… like to come upstairs? Might be a tight fit.”
John had spent the next three weeks staring at his arm. He didn’t understand most of the words, but it was comforting to know that there was someone out there just for him. That someday, he’d meet his soulmate, she’d think he was a military man, and then they’d live together happily ever after. He wondered what words were on his soulmate’s arm. Hopefully something nice. Something poetic and enchanting. Because there was no doubt that as soon as he saw her, he’d think she was the most beautiful and beguiling woman in existence.
The movie was long forgotten. Sherlock hadn’t actively paid attention for a solid ten minutes. The laughter, that one giggle, had stolen all his attention.
The fourth year looked up, eyes glowing with pride at the chance to be helpful. “Um, I, er… Suppose you could apologise, first. The calm before the storm,” she giggled then, an awkward, high pitched sort of laugh. “And then maybe, give them an ultimatum.”
He looked to where the door should have appeared, cursing at the sight of a simple blank wall. He gave it another go.
“I was just asking if you’d be alright spending those lunches in the Great Hall. I likely won’t be allowed company.”
Max focused his lens on the screen. Specifically, on the description of the search result Nev seemed to be enticed by. It read:
“C’mon now, Mr Watson. No use dawdling.” came Professor Sprout’s voice from the front of the room, nudging her head in the direction of the girls.
As Sherlock moved towards the sofa to make them some tea, John hurried towards the armchairs. Collapsing on the farthest one, he made a satisfied sound. “This is so soft, Sherlock. You have to come sit here once you’re done.”
Discomfort drowned them. John’s eyes were wide and frantic. Like there was something on his mind that he couldn’t quite acknowledge. “
“Hm? Oh, right...” Sherlock blushed awkwardly. “Well, first of all, your immediate reaction to me getting hurt was a dead giveaway. And also I, er, often help Professor Snape with the potion grading and you seem to excel at the ones with healing properties.”
John hesitated. “Actually, Professor… Is it true that partners for the Yule Ball can only be boy/girl?”
“Perhaps not,” another voice spoke, and as though their privacy was being severely violated, both John and Sherlock’s eyes darted to the door. “But I do have to ask you, Watson, why on earth are you currently surrounded by three immobilised students and missing from Transfiguration class? Skipping class to abuse your fellow students?”
John’s brows crinkled further. He closed his newspaper and straightened up. “No, this is bothering you. What is it?”
“Positive.” John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and pulled him down gently, engaging their lips once more.
“Not even one phone call?” Max explored, eyebrows furrowed. He clearly wasn’t convinced. And rightfully so, it appeared, as Sherlock’s gaze flickered downward in avoidance.
John huffed a breath of laughter at the oddity of it all, but showed no hesitation in following Sherlock and lying down beside him. “Wouldn’t have taken you for an astronomer.”
Sherlock’s gaze softened in response. An expression reserved only for John. “How was your walk?” he asked.
Sherlock stumbled, biting his lip anxiously. “Right. I’ll just… fix those up.” he gesticulated to a random bundle of equipment on the shelves by John’s work station, and John suppressed a grin at Sherlock’s utter transparency.
“You’re my best friend.” he had spoken quietly into the silence. It was a random thought, but, John concluded with clarity, a very true one.
“Murder?” proposed Nev. “But... this ties into our theory that this is William, too. John told us that William doesn’t want to call, and Lestrade says that that he’s tried Sherlock’s mobile to no avail.”
John swallowed thickly, shaking his head. “No… No, of course not, Professor Snape. I just, um… was writing some last minute notes and er, these guys were talking to Sherlock and er...”
"You too. So, you're currently living in London I presume, and were recently sent back home from military service?"
“Hi, Sherlock.” whispered John in reply. Turning his head around to face Sherlock, he tried to convey via expression how very remorseful he was. “That sounded beautiful, by the way.”
He did, mere minutes later, and his arms were empty. When he noticed Sherlock staring at him from the sofa, he froze.
“Hi?” said the person on the other end. The obscured audio quality combined with the man’s thick accent prompted Nev’s face to twist with worry.
“Though I may seem intimidating as an authority figure, I am first and foremost your head of house. I care about all of my students, and I most of all care if they are feeling unsafe or unwelcome. I despise bigotry and discrimination, John, and you were a victim of both. I apologise for not realising sooner.”
But merely deducing from his posture and attire wasn’t enough. Aware of Mike’s absent phone and the ever-present signal on his own, Sherlock spoke nonetheless. “Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine.”
Three weeks later, Sherlock was on a different side of London, deteriorating in a drug den. Mycroft had cut off his funds four days prior, leaving him with limited cash and a constant thrum in his head. Part of him was ashamed, but the days were blurring together, and one thought remained at the forefront of Sherlock’s mind:
Despite these precautions, nothing could have prevented him from running out to save a fallen comrade in the midst of a raid.
Sherlock opened the door and John followed behind loyally, risking a glance behind to make sure no one was trailing them. Once inside, the door closed behind them, and John turned his head to gauge his surroundings.
This case exceeded the difficulty of any before it, but the Catfish crew weren’t going to be giving up anytime soon. William seemed to be a very interesting bloke. Hopefully he was all who he claimed to be.
But Nev’s brain was elsewhere, scrolling through the results purposefully. “No… Wait, here we go. I think I have something, Max.”
John was attracted to women. It would be foolish to deny that. He enjoyed their company well enough and the dates were fun. Everything was nice.
“Sherlock!” Lestrade rushed forward, dread seeping through his veins. His eyes darted around desperately searching for anything recreational, though papers, half full beakers, an abundance of petri dishes, and a flickering Bunsen burner were all he could find. His features contorted in confusion, hesitantly reaching a hand out to the consulting detective.
“Like hell I’m telling you, kid.” Cedric chuckled. “Seriously though, if it becomes more of an issue, talk to Sprout. Trust me.” Cedric winked before turning and continuing on to the castle. John frowned. What the hell was that supposed to mean? With a frown, John vowed to forget about it before following after Cedric, hoping to Merlin that detention with Snape tomorrow evening wouldn’t be absolute torture.
Sherlock should have listened to Mycroft from the beginning. This shred of hope regarding John was a distraction – a hindrance to his intelligence. Not to mention: inevitable disappointment. This came to Sherlock’s attention cruelly upon their visit to the bank.
John watched Sherlock ramble with a small grin on his face, captivated by his excitement and expression. The weather at Hogwarts had been getting progressively colder over the past few weeks, and so the two of them were bundled up by the fire in Sherlock’s personal quarters. He’d been surprised when Sherlock first proposed them sitting in there as opposed to the usual Room of Requirement, but found the space to be just as comfortable and very Sherlock-esque. Books were strewn everywhere, with many packed unevenly in the bookshelf to accommodate the expansive collection, and potion recipes seemed to lie on every surface. The sitting room was home to a desk, a small dining table, a large sofa and a fireplace, beside of which sat Sherlock’s personal kitchen/laboratory. Here, it seemed as though potions were brewing constantly, and though the smell turned John away at first, he learned to become accustomed to it.
His parents hadn’t bothered to tell him the meaning behind the script on his left arm. His father was missing half the time and his mother had simply warned him ‘not to fucking bother.’ Looking back, they hadn’t been the best.
. But John seems like a person who appreciates honesty. If it were a woman and they knew John was bisexual, why would they feel the need to talk to him as a man?”
John looked as though he wanted to say something, but then the moment was over, and Sherlock was picking up a letter from the ground. They left the apartment side by side, an uncanny ambience between them.
Nev hummed. “But there is an entire screen separating you. You don’t necessarily know what he’s going to be like in person.”
“I’m sorry. For yelling at you the other day. I was a prick and I had no right to treat you like shit.”
The pain the two had suffered over the years had become something to be shared. They no longer had to bear the burden alone.
The next day began with Max and Nev returning to John’s bedsit, the older man welcoming them with a handshake once again. The man was anxious – that much was obvious. His limp seemed to be worse today and he stuttered over some of his words. He looked like he hadn’t slept a wink. Nev encouraged him to sit and relax rather than make them tea. Who knew what the news of their information would bring.
Somewhere through the conversation, Sherlock had found the time to lean in much closer, and John swallowed thickly at their sudden proximity. He looked up at Sherlock through his lashes, bashful, and closely studied the features of the other boy’s face. “You’re very handsome. Have I told you that before?” he mumbled softly beneath his breath.
Soon, they were topping up their drinks again, and John wasn’t quite certain of when they’d gotten around to opening the second bottle.
“I could hear a bit of a ruckus up there, yeah… Apparently Watson… I’m not sure of the full story...”
Sherlock sunk into himself, watching with fearful eyes as John grabbed his jacket from the hook and left their flat in a hurry.
John allowed his head to flop to the side. “I know I can trust you, silly. I just, I don’t know… I don’t even know why it scares me so much.”
“You know, last time I checked, you have to be in a relationship first for it to count as cheating.”
John’s grip on his pen tightened instinctively. Sherlock, who was similarly packing away his things, had been cornered, two Ravenclaws and one Hufflepuff boy lanking each side. John wasn’t quite certain if they realised he was still there.
The doors opened and John, Nev and Max emerged, followed by the MTV camera crew in the cab behind. John held his cane firmly and limped across the pavement, butterflies so strong he thought he might throw up. They reached the door to the flat, smooth and black with golden lettering. John took a few deep breaths through his nose. He was a soldier. He could handle anything. Even if William was a murderer. Even if William didn’t want him.
Bursting out into another fit of laughter, John reached behind him for a cane Sherlock hadn’t noticed previously.
That was how he found himself packing his bags and heading off to Afghanistan as an army doctor two years later.
John shook both their hands warmly, and gestured to a few seats by his desk where the two could take refuge. He moved to the countertop and prepared tea and biscuits, which Nev humorously labelled an authentic English experience. Once settled, Max prepared a larger camera to focus on Nev and John, settled comfortably with their tea as the conversation drifted naturally to the purpose of their visit – William.
Sherlock looked stunned. “Me? John Watson’s best friend? What… What about those Hufflepuff boys? Jamie?”
Sherlock was five years old when he first learnt of the soulmates. He’d been studying the different types of biota in their back garden when he felt it. A sharp yet dull pain on the cap of his right knee. He looked down curiously. There was no blood, but Sherlock felt as though he was bleeding, and had ran immediately to his Mummy who was reading a large book on the kitchen stool.
“Why does my knee hurt?” he questioned bluntly, hiking up his tailored shorts to show her the unmarred leg.
. But he couldn’t. His mind was racing too fast, his heart was banging too firmly against his chest.
"Just a little mundane for my liking. Not London itself, I love London, but with my injury," John gestured to a cane behind him, "it gets a little difficult."
Nev smiled widely as John described their relationship and could see the pure adoration flickering behind his gaze. The chances of William being who he claimed to be were miniscule, but he sincerely hoped that the results wouldn’t hurt John as much as he feared. “Do you mind if we take a look at some of the messages?”
It was safe to say that Potions was much different now. It had become a kind of common knowledge that John Watson was now friends with the squib apprentice, so the two didn’t hesitate in talking during class. Sherlock’s helpful hints had also increased phenomenally, the two of them bashfully ignoring Snape’s raised brows at their continuous interaction during class time. Mike, on the other hand, didn’t seem at all surprised by the change. Rather, he often joined in on their conversations and regarded them with an eerily knowing smile. John had no clue what that was all about.
Nev took a hesitant step forward. “Um, so, everything seems to be going really well so far. It’s great to meet you William, er, Sherlock. I’m Nev, from an MTV show called
Max, for a moment, looked as though he was about to lower his camera. But then his gaze was diverted elsewhere, and it was all too late.
He himself was in Hufflepuff. And it was amazing, really. He had a few mates in his house who he got along quite well with, the common room was always warm, and Professor Sprout was one of the more lenient head of houses. A study group had also been organized to accommodate students and there were a few girls he thought he might fancy taking to the newly announced Yule Ball.
One year into his deployment in Afghanistan, John awoke in the dead of night with a strong pain in his abdomen and the irrefutable need to vomit. But upon kneeling by the communal toilet and sticking his fingers down his throat, release would not come so easily, and he was left shivering on the bathroom tiles. Repetitive scratches of pain littered his arms as though someone was trying to tear his skin off, and John had to hold them close just to stop them shaking. Every limb ached, but John hadn’t exercised any time recently, and hangovers were a thing of the past.
“Mr Watson. Sit back down.” Snape sneered. “You’re still serving detention in case it… slipped your mind.”
But John wasn't quite sure. Scanning the head table, John could only pinpoint a few new faces, and none of them seemed young enough to be starting an apprenticeship. As the night gradually came to an end, it was concluded that no, Dumbledore was not introducing a new apprentice, and John briefly wondered if they ever existed at all. Rumours and gossip spread fast at Hogwarts, and this piece of information seemed to be no exception.
Carefully, Sherlock treaded around the divider concealing the intruder. He was close, so close, and then suddenly there was a debilitating pressure on his throat and Sherlock’s broken yells for John did nothing to appease the pain. He clawed desperately at the cloth constraining him, but his breaths only became shorter and shorter and shorter.
Soon enough, John began skipping lunch and bringing food down from the kitchens so he and Sherlock could spend more time together.
Sherlock wants to snort at her stupidity, but self-consciousness gets the best of him. Had John not told anyone he was married to a man? That he was married at all? Did he even wear his ring in public?
“No idea.” spoke Max. “Nev and I thought it might have been because he didn’t want you to find anything like this. Maybe just a safety precaution – you are strangers, after all.”
With his hands firmly holding the sig, John considered his options. It was either he shoot the cabbie and save Sherlock, or potentially, in the future, turn it against himself. In that moment, the decision was easy.
he had shot the cab driver. It might have just been his soldier sense of justice. Or maybe it was because he felt indebted to Sherlock – he had cured his limp and paid for dinner, after all. But really, perhaps it was because John was greedy. He wanted more of Sherlock. Wanted to witness more of his deductions. Wanted to go racing through the streets of London with the wind in his face and a killer on the loose. And if Sherlock had died in that moment, what then?
Holmes? Who is Sherlock?” Nev wondered aloud. Max, in his excitement, reached over Nev to click on the link, camera fumbling slightly.
It was so nice. Sitting there, across from Sherlock. Nobody else mattered in that moment. Just the two of them against the rest of the world.
He had been foolish to believe that John Watson was his soulmate. John Watson, who laughed with him, defended him, and killed for him. Sherlock doubted someone so
“Heh, silly. Here,” Sherlock leaned forward to forcefully grab John’s glass from his hand, pouring him another drink of Firewhisky which dribbled over the edges.
“Shit, John. I know you told me he’s interesting but… this is otherworldly. What does he do for work?”
John wasn't quite sure what he expected saying something like that. But Sherlock lighting up like a Christmas tree and fumbling over his words definitely wasn't it.
Michael laughed loudly, a sound akin to a snort escaping his lips. "Twat? I think fairy is a bit more accurate, innit?"
The two sat opposite, a companionable but slightly tense silence between them. In an effort to avoid talking about what had occurred a few nights ago, they simply continued to drink, half a bottle down much quicker than either had anticipated.
His soulmate, of course, was the obvious thing. He was a thirty one year old man who had never knowingly met his soulmate, and things were beginning to look grim. John looked down at the cane resting beside his bed, then the tremor in his left hand. A cripple. Even if by chance he
