Sam nods excitedly and turns to his bag. He unzips it, sticking in a freakishly large hand to rummage about, and pulls out a thick book.
Not that Cas had ever been much of a liar.
A beat passes before Bobby blows out a sigh and smacks his tumbler onto the tabletop with an audible thunk. “Out with it.”
Seated behind it, slightly frazzle-haired and scribbling away, is Kevin Tran.
bomb? Drove a hundred miles (or maybe a thousand, he didn’t check the odometer) because, what, his SpacePhone™ told him to? What is he doing here?
Dean probably should have seen that coming.
She rolls her eyes and nods, smiling once again. “Yes, obviously pie. What else.”
” Dean says, and his voice has dropped to a scratchy, untouched octave. “Didn’t they.”
,” Sam says, hands forming vague finger quotes, “is...” He trails off for a short beat, and his eyebrows pop up. “Good,” he finishes, and huffs out an incredulous laugh.
Dean frowns and lowers the phone, staring blankly at the steering wheel. He’s got that feeling again, like he’s a damn open book - though he’s not sure why anyone would bother to read.
Cas had said, just before his wings had painted stark shadows on the walls. Massive and fluttering, they’d shifted Cas’ posture, like he wasn’t quite used to them, their heft a foreign weight at his back.
into Heaven’s Library? With a frickin’
Cas hums again, head craning back to follow the seagull’s steep climb upward. “Closer to twelve, maybe.”
Her brow arches in a double-dog dare. “What do you think.”
The panty-dropper act had worked like a charm in his twenties - sixty damn years ago, now - but Ellen’s always been made of stronger stuff. Her brow drops low in an unimpressed glare that has Dean smiling wide.
, per se, but at least he’s not a smear on the stone floor. He breathes out a relieved sigh and wipes the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand.
“I swear to Jack,” Charlie mutters, fingers smashing against the controller buttons, “if you say ‘get over here’ one more time—”
Cas had been destroyed, too: his atoms dispersed at the snap of an archangel’s fingers, blood blackened by wretched souls. His very mind had been broken, colonized, infiltrated - his own happiness weaponized against him.
Ellen sets the bottle down and slips the stopper back in. Dean doesn’t look up at her - though her gaze on his face feels like a touch - as she slides the little shot glass towards him.
his own happin—
A beige leather book. With gold insignia on the spine.
“Well?” she says, leaning forward against the bar. “You gonna hug my neck, or what?”
“My dad took me fishin’ once,” John says.
A husky laugh comes from somewhere above his head, drawling and achingly familiar.
. What are they, at a bachelorette party in the Hamptons? “Aren’t you supposed to be a lesbian?”
Dean’s mouth turns down, impressed. Leave it to Sammy to find a giant celestial mountain in another plane of existence and go climb the damn thing. “Anything interesting?”
Cas lets the sentence hang, and Dean squints over at him.
Dean shakes his head and stares down at his boots. “Nothin’ much,” he grumbles, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Just...” he breathes out a short sigh. “I dunno. Tired, I guess.”
He could say
Dean shakes his head, smiling wry but wide, stomach aching with laughter. “Pretty hardcore,” he says, then faces forward. “For a nerd.” He takes another short sip, noting Charlie’s scowl in his peripheral vision.
“And no,” she continues, eyes going shifty. “He let me in.”
Dean feels the tension across his shoulders recede, and he sniffs, eyes tracing the hazy alpine skyline.
Dean nods at nothing in particular and chews his lip. “How do you keep it all organized?”
Dean strides over and pulls it open, standing aside as Bobby steps out onto the raised wooden platform. There’s a tall square table flanked by barstools to his left, and a rusted mesh fire pit on his right, but Dean barely notices either of them.
He’s driven past it a few times, but never gotten too close; there’s something mildly forbidding in the way it juts out of the earth, its stamped concrete walkways a jarring foil to the surrounding flora. From his perch on the front steps, it looks like any other city library - modern and well-maintained, if a bit oddly placed.
Cas’ head drops like he can’t hold it up anymore, and Dean thinks for a second that he looks like an old Renaissance portrait - all blue-tinted shadows and oil-painted misery.
Bobby leaves his own glass empty, but pours another two fingers for Dean. Dean watches the spirit slosh against the scratched glass, coming nearly to the lip, but never spilling over. He brings it to his mouth to sip, but Bobby raps against the tabletop with his knuckles.
A rusted metal light overhead flickers on, and the shadow recedes.
John blows out a harsh sigh. He’s silent for a long moment, but for the click in his throat as he swallows. Then he sucks in a short breath and nudges Dean’s shoulder with his own.
Kevin shakes his head. “No name listed.”
“Dean—”
“I know,” he intones, giving her a tight smile.
Back then, Dean had told him to pull the comic from his site and go the hell outside. Now, Dean feels mild envy for him and Charlie both.
Dean shakes his head. “The hell does that mean?”
He looks up, finally, and tries to school his expression into something less hopeful and more nonchalant - though he’s pretty sure he left his devil-may-care persona back on earth.
“We’re in Heaven, Dean,” Sam murmurs, and there’s a startled sort of wonder in his voice. “
The tension across Dean’s shoulders breaks - sudden and startling - and he hunches forward, blowing out a sigh. His vision is hazy at the edges, wetness clumping his eyelashes together.
She comes around the table, sliding into the chair at Dean’s side, and when she finally looks up at him, her eyes are bright and red-rimmed. She takes Dean’s hand in hers, her skin smooth and cool, and slips the little framed drawing into his palm.
, it’s been so damn long since he last said those words. They feel dusty, cobwebbed in his mouth.
...” he squints his eyes in a frown, “...
Mary senses his sudden tension and looks up, following his eyes over her shoulder.
Dean stares at him for a moment, then nods down at his hands as if that makes any sort of sense. He runs his tongue over his lips, eyes darting about the half lit barn for any indication of the time. “How long have I...?”
Dean’s smile grows, and there’s a phantom ache in his teeth. “Yes it was.”
Fuck.
A slow smile stretches Dean’s face. “Mom’s pie.”
Bobby sets his glass down and folds his arms across his chest, eyes rolling. “You’d think that rusty nail mighta knocked some sense into your head—”
He thinks Cas might be calling his name, but it’s muted and distant, garbled like he’s underwater.
Dean blinks several times, brow sagging in a frown. He’s not sure what he was expecting, but that certainly wasn’t it.
likes
them like air, like sunlight. Like rain.
Ellen grins while Dean gapes like a damned fish. “Buffalo Trace, Old Fashioned Copper,” she confirms, and Dean’s eyebrows nearly climb off his face. “Thirty years old.”

He glances up at Kevin, still scrawling away. He looks different than Dean remembers - broader in the shoulder, stronger around the jaw. There’s a dusting of stubble across his chin and a line etched into his forehead. He’s gone a little grey at the temples.
“Well,” he says, turning to Sam with the softest smile he can muster, “ya got time, little brother.”
Cas -
“Three days before,” he says, voice low and scratchy. “Before we lost her.” He bumps against Dean again, soft and a little awkward. “It was Halloween... You remember it?”
The road had ended in a quaint little cul-de-sac, maybe ten yards from the barn. Dean had parked at the dead end, idling. He’d passed a short while with his hands clenched on the wheel, eyes squinted at the barn doors, arguing with the voices in his head - all of which sounded infinitely more reasonable than he himself.
Dean’s eyes fall shut, lungs seizing up, and the trussed up Ma’lak box behind his ribcage jolts. For all he’d once planned to lock himself in it and be cast out to sea, he’s pretty sure there’s an ocean
A shaft of sunlight pours in through an open window, bright and garish against Dean’s eyes. He shakes his head, quick and spasmodic, and glances back up at Ellen.
thought
here?
One corner of Dean’s mouth ticks up, and he bumps his shoulder briefly against Cas’. “Man,” he huffs out and tips his head toward the bedroom. “We coulda been doin’ that for...” he trails off and shakes his head, pressing his back against the bench. There’s a sore spot just under his shoulder blade, and he wonders if there’s a bruise there, too.
It’s a loaded question, one Dean’s heard about a hundred times since he hopped the pearly gates. Skirting it has become something like second nature.
Sam’s face is blurry in Dean’s peripheral vision, but he can imagine his expression - doubtful and mildly amused - when he asks, “You even remember any of it?”
“Hester.”
Come visit me on
He sits down on the end of the nearest table, twiddling his thumbs. From this distance, he can barely hear the pen scratching over the paper, and the interminable silence grows oppressive.
Dean frowns and gives a little shrug. “Okay.”
Dean stares at the squiggle, a frown etching across his forehead. The figurine he remembers was nearly solid white, the only deviations its pink skin and dark eyes. There’s not a speck of white in the little scribble, no cherubic cloud-seeder to be found. Just messy black shapes and a faded blue circle. Black wings, blue halo.
Dean gives a bark of laughter, and his cheeks ache. He’s learned that Charlie is an appallingly poor sport, and her swearing tirades in the wake of a loss amuse him to no end.
Dean adjusts his shoulders, the tension across his back hunching him forward. “A building,” he repeats. The hunter in him is banging around his chest like a Ma’lak box, and the fingers of his right hand twitch for his 1911 - can nearly feel her etched steel and pearl panels. “Abandoned?”
Dean opens his mouth to respond, but Cas is having none of it.
Her tiny white hands rise in a shameless shrug. “You can take the girl out of the corporate espionage scheme...”
Better.
There’s a muted flutter and a sudden, yawning emptiness in the room. Dean’s hands clench and release, clench and release.
His lips part, dry and sticking together at the sides. “I
, she’d said.
Sam makes a considering noise in his throat and replies, “Mostly just open hayfields. Miles of ‘em.” He pauses a beat, then tilts his head, contemplative. “But,” he interrupts himself with a shake of his head and tries again. “But we saw...”
White symbols litter the floor - some he recognizes, some he doesn’t, some he’d painted himself. His eyes catch on a sigil on the wall - a septagram done in dripping black paint. He remembers the feel of the brush in his hand, the drag of the bristles across the dry-rotted wall, the clench of his fingers around the grip as he painted the seven lines, awaiting the arrival of the next Big Bad.
Nearly.
Straight-faced, Dean asks, “How’s life?”
“I’m sorry,” he murmurs, glancing off to the side.
“What?” comes Charlie’s muffled voice.
Dean sniffs and hunches his shoulders against the swelling pressure in his chest. Kevin said these were written by Arch members - angels. He clenches his jaw, grunting, “Funny sort of thing for an angel to say.”
His hands clench up tight, fingernails digging into his palms. The whispering voice speaks full volume now, coming from somewhere near his heart, echoing through the hollows inside.
hand.
Dean shrugs. “Because I’m—”
Cas is right, of course. Nothing has changed.
Kevin glances up, following Dean’s eyes. “Yeah,” he says, matter of fact. “Most people have. First Corinthians thirteen.”
Kevin sighs, and his face softens, mouth forming a flat line. He gives Dean a look - admonishing, with the barest hint of pity. “It
Dean nods his head, pursing his lips. “Funny,” he murmurs, and Kevin’s eyes flick to his for an instant, squinted and wry.

the universes Chuck destroyed. Not just ours.”
“Yeah,” Charlie snorts, “and you cheese it.” She presses several buttons at once, and her character - a skinny brunette in a hilarious and mildly sexy bathing suit - kicks Dean’s guy about thirty damn times.
She shakes her head and points a blunt-nailed finger at him. “Dean, don’t you dare.
Dean’s brows rise at that. Offering comfort in a time of need isn’t really his parents’ bag - at least, not that Dean can remember.
Dean frowns harder. “How’d you know I was—” He bites down on his tongue, swallowing down the stupid question with a snap of his fingers. “Right,” he nods. “Prophet.”
Cas is...
Kevin gives him a flat, baleful look that clarifies precisely zero, then turns back to his giant book.
the Arch.”
Dean shifts over, his foot upending an empty beer bottle he doesn’t remember drinking. It rolls an inch or two and promptly disappears. He arches a brow; no littering past the pearly gates, apparently. He juts his chin toward the empty space at his side and grunts, “Pop a squat.”
He brings the glass to his mouth and takes a short sip. It stings like battery acid - Bobby’s ‘legendary’ sour mash always does - but it’s a familiar burn, and Dean savors it. He coughs subtly into his shoulder, grunting, “Whatcha been up to?”
Dean gives a crooked smile and steps over the threshold, scraping his feet against the bristly welcome mat.
She’d had Dean supine across the foot of the squeaky queen, sitting astride him and working some kind of magic. She’d settled his hands on her slim waist, tugged at his hair, bitten his lips; he’d had nary a moment to want something before she gave it - the craving coming on the heels of the having.
, Dean nearly says, though he’s sure John remembers. Dean learned young that that was all John kept in his head: sepia-tone memories of lost happiness.
Dean’s eyes cut down to his hands, one clenched so tight it shows white at the knuckles.
She looks much the same now. And just as it did back then, her scowl splits in a toothy smile, ruddy cheeks dimpling.
Dean’s shoulders tense further, crowding up around his ears, and he shakes his head. “He’s not
Dean frowns and curls forward, chin dropping to his chest. The whisper in his head makes a short utterance, and Dean sees himself, greyscale in his memory. Face blank in the aftermath, bones numb from the onslaught, and all he can think, can feel, can say is—
being an idiot.
Editing is going pretty quickly, should have all chapters posted in the next couple days.
“Mhm,” she hums, giving another slow nod. Her finger slides across the two tiny black scrawls, vaguely triangular and joined at the middle. “Wings,” she says, then taps the blue oval just above, “halo.” He sees her smile out of the corner of his eye. “You drew it all the time.”
“It wasn’t an expectation,” Mary says, then gives a little shrug. “He just... I think he figured all the—” she shakes her head, as if searching for the words, “-the
He watches the glasses fill in succession. Ellen pours like a master - quick and efficient, not a drop lost. “Better now,” he says, eyes fixed on the glinting lip of the final glass.
“No,” Sam says and casts his eyes out toward the peak. “On the forest in the field.” His glances straight upwards, eyes wide even in the garish sunlight. “Skies were blue all around, no clouds anywhere except...” he turns to Dean with an unreadable expression, “...right over the little forest.”
His bafflement must show on his face, because Bobby’s brow straightens, tone going softer.
Dean nearly chokes on his next breath, then shakes his head, swallowing dryly. “Shit. Hey,” he grunts out, wincing at the gravel in his voice.
“Busy?” Dean says again. His voice cracks a little, and he swallows hard, face warming in shame - or perhaps anger. Dean’s never been real good at telling one from the other.
So, of course Sam is thinking about Cas. After all, he’d loved him nearly as much as—
John is silent for a long, soft moment. The breeze is mild, barely there, the still air keeping the water placid and quiet. The two little bobs in the water float toward one another, drawn together by an inexplicable gravity.
What do you want?
Dean’s jaw goes taut, mouth pulling into a rictus of a smile. He breathes out another brittle laugh and shakes his head. “...Nope.”
Dean nods and knocks the tumbler back, the whisky burning down his throat to roil in his belly. This, at least, he understands.
The door swings inward, hinges creaking out a plea for some WD-40, and there’s Bobby, glaring at him squinty-eyed from underneath his ball cap.
“Did you say—”
She was young - maybe eight or nine - with dark hair and shining eyes. Her right arm was burnt black, her left leg misshapen as if crushed, her face battered and bruised.
These days, Dean feels more
. Concrit always welcome, and thanks for reading!
He means the words - entirely, wholeheartedly - but there’s a blue note in his tone that he can’t quite suppress. He broadens his smile, lets his crow’s feet show, and slips his last glass on top of the stack.
Dean’s mouth pulls into a wide grin, and he raises his hands in a shrug. “C’mon, who could hate this face.”
Sam huffs a fake laugh and shakes his head. “I don’t...” he starts, then cuts a considering look at Dean. Dean stares back, blank-faced and expectant, and Sam blows out a sigh, eyes downcast. “Yeah, okay. Look, I was—” he cuts himself off, pulling his lip through his teeth. “... I was thinking about Cas.”
An image floats to the surface of Dean’s mind: a pretty brunette with ice blue eyes, offering Cas an army and a shining pointed blade.
There’s a soft pressure at Dean’s side - Cas nudging him with his shoulder - and Dean looks up.
Dean’s breath hitches, and he blows out a sigh, shoulders sagging. He’s not sure why it’s so hard to say - why it hurts so much, like poking at a broken collarbone. It’s true, after all - not a word of a lie. Might be the truest thing he’s ever said to Cas, now that Dean’s thinking about it.
Mary seems to sense his imminent retraction, and she settles her face into a genial smile. “He’s good,” she says mildly and comes back to her seat across from Dean. “Wasn’t sure he’d like it here, at first. But,” she settles into the worn wooden chair, “I think he does.”
He hears the broad smile in Mary’s voice. “Coulda been the next Da Vinci,” she says, nudging his shoulder.
- but can’t quite attach them to their meanings. He squints his eyes tight, as if by looking hard enough he might divine a translation.
, Dean says:
“Hannah knew, too,” Dean grits out, taking another step forward. “Didn’t she.”
- these are something else entirely.
Sam sighs, weary and a little frustrated. “Kind of? I don’t know. I mean,” he leans forward, lacing his fingers between his knees, “Jack’s done a good thing here, ya know? This...” He makes a broad gesture with his hands, eyes darting over the scenery. “This is how it’s supposed to be. How it should have
Dean nods absently and casts his eyes about the room. The shruggie guy is still shrugging, Yoda’s head still bobbing, Ivy’s white marble eyes staring sightlessly toward the door. Dean’s gaze settles on a painting he hadn’t noticed, tucked into the corner behind a threadbare recliner: an abstract composition of flowing indigo and teal, offset by swathes of pale yellow edged in pink, with a crooked pillar of white rising up the center. Dean’s not much of a one for fine art, but something tells him this is a masterpiece. Ageless and tragic and
Perhaps he’s in a Ma’lak box, too.
If John bothers/triggers you, please skip to the next chapter.
...And that's all she wrote. Thanks for reading :)
There’s a short, pointed silence, and then a familiar noise from somewhere inside - a soft, airy flutter.
“I’m telling you now.”
- is nearly as tall as he is.
Only, in this instance, Dean’s not exactly sure how.
Trouble is, Dean doesn’t know what he’s expecting. And he certainly doesn’t know what he wants.
“Hello, Dean.”
. Moved and helpless - like he’s watching a Greek tragedy unfold in real time.
Dean sighs, long and deep, like he’s emptying his lungs for the first time. His shoulders sag low, but they feel light, loose like the weight they carried has fallen away.
- rings through the humid air.
Sam leans closer, and he smiles almost comically wide. “Dean, the Library? It’s
Dean had spent so damn long looking for the answer - scouring Heaven and Hell and the Earth alike - that he’d all but forgotten the question.
“It hit her,” she goes on, “and hard, but...” Her lips press together in a firm line, and she gives a definitive nod. “She coped.” She glances up at Dean, eyes wise and soft, her voice pitched just above a whisper. “Moved on.”
Kevin goes back to his scribbling, and Dean inches closer, curious, but a low harrumph from Kevin has him taking a step back.
Sam angles his head to stare at Dean. Dean stares back, and whatever Sam sees has him going glassy-eyed and pinch-lipped. He pulls in a shaky breath, eyes squeezing shut. “
Dean wets his lips, chewing the bottom one. “Can I ask you somethin’?”
Dean grasps at the amulet, sucking in a deep breath. “Here goes,” he murmurs.
“I’ve read this one before,” he surmises, nodding towards the text.
He arrives at the head of the table, nearly abreast of Dean, and smoothes a finger over the pale wood surface in an intricate pattern.
Dean’s jaw clenches, and his vision goes a little hazy at the edges. There’s a brief, sharp twinge in the center of his back - a remembrance of his last moment on earth. He recalls the aching, burrowing pain, not of the rebar, but of Sam’s crumbling face. Dean doubts he could survive it again; he didn’t even survive it the first time.
hadn’t even occurred to him.
The awning over the table is dripping, the floorboards damp and shiny, and little rivulets run down the metal handrails at the edge of the platform where it overlooks the lake.
Cas freezes, brow dropping low. “Promotion?”
Dean swallows hard, and Cas sidesteps around him, giving him a wide berth. Dean hears the soft susurrus of Cas’ wings manifesting somewhere behind him, tastes the slight hint of petrichor on the air. He doesn’t turn around.
. “She... she went before him?”
John peeks over his shoulder and gives Dean a tiny crooked smile. He juts his chin toward a lonesome rod - Dean’s own - propped against the empty side of the bench.
- years. That’s as long as Dean’s human life. As long as he spent in the Pit. And ancient, eldritch, and celestial though Cas may be, Dean thinks that forty years rebuilding Heaven - forty years of radio silence -
Dean uses the moment of distraction to pull the joystick hard to the left, tapping square one last time. His character - a rippling muscled dude in a skintight suit with a yellow loincloth - casts his spear at Mileena, yelling a guttural ‘Get over here!’
Dean’s face splits in a broad smile, and his vision blurs. “Ya think?” he huffs out, fingers curling around Cas’ forearm. He brings his other hand to encircle Cas’ elbow, his thumb sinking into the hollow at the crease.
Sam sniffs and shakes himself. “Anyway,” he says, and his voice is level, but thick. “It - hunting - it just, uh. It didn’t make me happy.” He turns toward the distant water, the revelers at the little picnic on the shore. “Eileen made me happy,” he intones with a growing smile. “Junior made me—” he shakes his head, eyes going bright, “
Charlie clears her throat. “Push on the gems - red first, blue last. Plop it on the door, and it’ll automagically—” Dean frowns,
“Hm?” Mary leans closer to him, and Dean’s nose twitches with the scent of tart apples clinging to her hair. She looks at the little scribble, frowning for a moment, before her eyebrows pop up. “Oh, wow,” she sighs out, leaning closer. “I forgot about that.”
“Well,” he begins, making a swift volte face toward his desk. “You could do it in some—” another soft chuckle as he climbs the short stairs, “—convoluted
He’d eventually stumbled upon his soggy marsh, his legs cramping, back stiff, and a headache pounding at his temples. In hindsight, Dean supposes he could’ve called for a lift - Sam or Charlie would’ve come for him, surely. Or he could’ve just
He looks over at Kevin scribbling away, oblivious. Dean calls his name, but it comes out in a cracked, stammering whisper. He clears his throat and tries again. “Kevin.”
“Yeah,” she says, settling her elbows on the bar. “First thing I laid eyes on after your boy fixed up the joint.” She snorts under her breath, shaking her head. “Bout fell over when I saw him. It was...” Her voice cuts out, and she pulls her bottom lip through her teeth, eyes far away. “A moment.”
- the barn is dark and just cold enough to draw Dean’s shoulders up.
“It wasn’t your burden to bear,” Cas says finally. He takes a diagonal step around the tree, careful to keep his back to Dean.
Silence descends on him,
There’s a crack and hiss in the background - a beer can opening, Dean thinks - and he can hear the snarky smile in Charlie’s voice. “Tell Kevin I say hi.”
Warning: The second scene in this chapter features John Winchester. Scroll to the next "
Dean gives a gusty exhale, shoulders sagging, and hoists himself to his feet. He leans across the bar, arms wrapping tight around her back, and he squeezes his eyes closed, pressing his nose into her hair. She smells like charred barrels and gunsmoke, sweet hops and ballistol.
Cas’ face crumbles, and he makes a sound that could be laugh or a sob. He stares down at his fingers - scratching idly at Dean’s clavicle - and shakes his head.
Dean turns to him, meeting his eye for a brief moment. John gives him a tiny half smile, then looks back out over the inlet.
Once he sees that first scribble, he begins to notice several others. There’s one nearly at the ceiling kitty-corner to Kevin’s desk that looks like it might be in Japanese. Another on the wall opposite him that’s comprised of funny little hieroglyphs in a spiral pattern that he thinks might be Linear A.
He knows he won’t make a catch, and that the sun won’t set. He knows he won’t speak a word, and neither will John. He knows the dregs of his beer will be warm and flat. And he knows the fish in the inlet don’t know that they’re wet.
When he arrives at the inlet, John is sitting on the bench at the end of the pier.
. The whole place is designed to keep people happy; everything - from the bucolic landscape, to the picket-fenced houses, to the cloudless blue sky - all of it exists to preserve the joy, the peace, the contentment of the souls here.
Dean licks his lips, dry tongue sticking to the skin. “Who wrote this,” he whispers.
Sam sighs deep and scratches at the back of his head, mussing his hair. “I don’t know,” he shrugs. “Wasn’t the same. It was just... bumps and bruises, spilling salt all over the dash, and...” He chews on his lip for a second before glancing over at Dean. “It just made me miss you.”
Dean frowns for a moment, bemused, before he follows Sam’s eyes to the massive, jutting peak in the distance. He feels his eyebrows climb his forehead and points with the rod. “The mountain?”

Dean picks at the label on his bottle, eyes fluttering shut. “M’not sure I’d know it if I saw it,” he grits out, voice pitched just above a whisper. “Happiness.”
it here.”
It’d taken barely a minute in the storeroom to find the haunted object; his EMF had directed him to an ancient clay vase - scorched at the bottom and chipped around the mouth, with a crack running down the side like a fault line.
He stops short at the sight of another little dot, this one in a soft, glowing white. It’s across the bridge on the other side of the forest, in what looks like a sprawling botanical garden.
He thinks of Mary, serving him pie in a house over yonder - how even a hundred years later, he still sees her, gutted and burning behind his eyelids.
Dean’s eyes alight on hers, and his lips purse. There’s something something fragile in her face, a budding hope that he doesn’t want to crush.
His boots trample hellebores and bluebells alike.
Kevin glances at the little clock on the desk, then turns back to the tome he’s scribbling in. “Your appointment was ten minutes ago.”
Dean’s never been much of a one for pomp and provenance; he’d as soon shoot three fingers of Bobby’s old rotgut as sip at a decanted Lagavulin. But Dean’s pretty sure he’s seen this very bottle on a pillowed pedestal behind a glass wall, and hell if he isn’t itching for a taste.
Dean isn’t sure where the realization had come from, but it had hit him like a damned freight train. And on its heels had come the urgent, almost desperate need to hear Cas deny it.
around the weight of failed expectations, the clamoring memories of a rod rarely spared. Even now, half a century later, he can still feel the scorn bearing down on his shoulders, pulling his lips into a stoic line.
Mary sighs, barely audible. “You ever gonna talk to him?”
Kevin looks up briefly, eyes flicking to the symbols on the wall. He shakes his head, going back to his notebook. “Inspirational quotes.”
Charlie snorts indelicately. “Yeah, well, I got gutted in a motel bathtub by a frickin’ Frankenstein. So, I win.”
, and Dean, wet-eyed, had grunted it back.
Mary’s eyes dart up to his, and her soft laugh lines deepen. “Yeah, you did.”
Dean stares, and Cas stares back. Dean’s not sure what expression he’s wearing; his whole damn face has gone numb, though he feels little beads of flop sweat forming at his hairline.
Mary tips her head to the side, eyes going soft as her lips turn up, and the moment passes.
Dean watches him disappear into the thicket, the gnarled trees painting him in shadow, swallowing him up. Dean turns away from the quiet chimes, the buzzing hive, the creaking branch, and backtracks his route along the tortuous path.
“I said I’d ask,” Dean prods, with a warm crooked smile, “when I wanted to hear it.” He slips his hands from Cas’ shoulders to the stark bolts of his jaw, smoothing his thumbs over the damp planes of his cheeks. “
Dean frowns, confused, and glances up at Mary. Her eyes are shiny, mouth screwed up in a tiny sad smile.
Dean tips his head back in a nod. “Right. Uh...” Dean trails off for a moment, unsure. Nearly all of his childhood memories are of Mary, but they’re weathered and vague, filtered through the consciousness of a toddler. He barely remembers the words she said, only the lilting strains of her voice as she calmed him, soothed him, protected him—
“Dean,” Sam murmurs, “I don’t think Cas is a Seraph any more.”
Dean swallows. “How’s Eileen?”
Dean bites his cheek so hard he tastes copper, and he drags his eyes back to Ellen’s downturned face.
She’s silent for a short beat, unfocused eyes downcast. Then she sucks in a short breath and shakes her head, eyes cutting over to Dean’s. “She was a kid,” she says, and gives a soft chuckle. “She’s
- says it: “Just not on
Dean sucks in a short breath and nods. He steps forward, thighs nudging the table edge, his shoulder nearly butting against Kevin’s. He does a quick double-take when he realizes that the kid - that
It’s dark and musty inside. The air hangs thick and humid, dust clouds swirling in the flickering light shafts. Dean squints then blinks hard, eyes falling to an illuminated spot on the ground.
Dean could say
Dean sucks in a breath like he’s breaking the surface.
It’s an odd question - neither Dean nor Bobby go in much for small talk - and Bobby clocks it quick. He raises an eyebrow, leveling Dean with A Look, but something in Dean’s face gives him pause.
Charlie’s voice comes through, clear and a little echoey. “Well, it was
Dean shrugs as much as he’s able while spamming the square button. “It’s the best move!”
, he nearly says. He shakes his head sharply instead, “—bad weird.”
He eyes the script, following its neat, angled lines. He recognizes a few of the words -
Charlie gives him a self-congratulatory smile and passes the glass to Dean. He tips his head in thanks and takes a gulp, face scrunching up at the taste.
She gives him a look. “That was Dad.”
He snorts a laugh and finally peels his eyes open.
weird. Just...” He shrugs and bites his lip. “There was a place, in the distance. Like a, a tiny little forest. Just a few trees and a—” he tips his head to the side, frowning, “a building.”
Dean leans in close, his nose a few scant inches from Cas’, and he slides his hands up to the broad, hunched shoulders. The base of his palms press against the curve of Cas’ collarbone, and Dean feels the movement as Cas sucks in a breath.
, Jack had said to Dean, sitting creekside with his rod, graceless and dying.
Cas’ eyes climb up, roving over Dean’s face like he’s committing it to memory - like he’s seeing it for the very first time. And perhaps he is.
Dean sighs and sets his beer down with a thunk. “What.”
Charlie stares blankly for a moment, slack-jawed and dull-eyed, before cutting a glare at Dean. “I literally hate you.”
barn, incidentally - Dean had known that the rumple-suited man before him was different. Other.
Dean glances down at his half-eaten lunch, licking Buffalo sauce off the side of his thumb. He’s pretty sure the plate - with its lopsided tower of wings, side of celery, and little cup of chunky bleu cheese - is meant to replicate one he’d had at a greasy spoon sixty odd years ago. To the naked eye, the place had looked like a shithole - just another offramp dive in B.F.E., Nebraska. But the wings - damn, the
Dean repeats in his head.
Dean huffs a brittle laugh and nods down at his hands. That much is certainly true, but- “No tellin’ the jailbait that,” he mutters.
“Hey.”
Dean shakes his head, the motion twitchy from the mounting swell of dread in his stomach. “Cas—”
Dean’s spine goes stiff, eyes widening. He hasn’t heard that voice in ten - no,
Ellen’s eyes narrow for a split second before her face goes carefully blank, eyes falling back to the sink. “You could have.”
“And restored his Grace,” Sam nods. “So. They get here and start fixin’ the place up. Opening up all the personal heavens, getting rid of the whole greatest hits shtick, right?” Dean nods along; Bobby had told him this much. “Then, get this,” Sam continues, leaning ever further forward, “Jack leaves.”
is love for one person.”
Ellen’s eyebrows form an oblique line, doubtful and sympathetic. Dean almost laughs; Ellen never took his bullshit before, he’s not sure why he thought she’d start now.
Dean’s mouth closes with an audible click, his shoulders drawing up. He adjusts his seat on the bench, hands gripping the rod tight. Sam gives him an inscrutable look, and Dean’s head dips in a nod.
“Yeah,” Dean says, voice thick in his throat. He peers out at the mountains, and he feels his lips do something funny - a smile and a frown, all at once. “Yeah, me too.”
; he’s not even angry - just a little bruised, and, really, when
Sam turns toward him, eyebrows raised. He gives a circumspect nod and sets his beer on a protruding tree root. “‘Course.”
Sam trails off, and Dean’s hackles rise. He settles his gaze squarely on Sam’s face, jaw pulling tight. “What.”
All roads lead—
“—open. Badabing...”
The grass is wet and gleaming - dew, Dean thinks - and while the sun shines bright overhead, Dean’s comfortable in the shade of the oak tree, away from the crowd.
“Wondering why I feel like a goddamn bruise,” Dean goes on, taking another, surer step toward Cas. “Wondering why... it never rains.”
Heaven’s sun shines bright over head, casting sepia rays from every direction. Dean winces at the vivid blue sky and looks towards what he imagines is West - though he can’t be sure, since the sun here never quite sets.
Kevin gives him a bland, slit-eyed look. “This
he? He can’t think of a single moment in his life - or his afterlife, for that matter - where nothing hurt, where nothing stung, where the ache in his chest didn’t prod at him with cold, blunt fingers.
Dean’s eyelid twitches, and he blinks several times in succession, giving a low grunt. “I dunno, Sammy, kinda sounds—”
Then, of course, the crowning jewels: a wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling flatscreen TV and a tiny blue console that ostensibly contains every video game ever made. Charlie calls it the Deus ExBox.
Dean smirks wider and settles back against the bench, stretching his legs out before him. “So, you and Eileen are John Muir-ing it through Mirkwood.” Sam snorts at that, as Dean knew he would. “Then what.”
Cas turns back toward the sea, head tilting just so. “Did you know,” he murmurs, “the first garrison sent to collect you from the Pit—” he shakes his head, “—failed.”
, I missed you.”
Dean curls his fingers into a fist, pressing his knuckles into the table until zinging pain shoots up his arm. Dean’s not a complete idiot; he gets Heaven’s schtick. It gives people what they want - what they couldn’t have during their lives. Charlie wanted a 64K TV. Mary wanted a house with a white picket fence. Apparently
“What’s goin’ on with you?”
Dean peers up at her askance, and she stares back, face straight but for a tiny wry smile.
, he wants to say
“I checked
A moment passes, calm and quiet. The salted breeze stirs the moss overhead. A bird chirps a strange tuneless song. The sky reflects the water, and the water reflects the sky.
Sam clears his throat and turns back toward the water. “Yeah, Eileen thought so too, but... I don’t know. It felt—” he sucks in a short breath, shoulders coming up in a benign shrug, “nice.”
Dean reins in his surprise and dips his head, summoning a wry smile. “Well,” he says and points his fork at the plate of pie crumbs.
The last time Dean was here, there’d been heavy wind and soaring sparks. Lightning.
Dean blanches. “I—”
“I never gave it up entirely,” Sam murmurs. “If someone needed help, I’d-. I’d figure something out. But...” He hunches forward, settling his elbows on his knees. “I realized one day that... happiness isn’t given. It’s
Dean had returned in the dead of night, pilfered the vase from the storeroom, and headed out to a little copse by the parking lot to burn it. As he’d poured the lighter fluid over it, a little girl had appeared between the trees.
“I didn’t say that,” Dean interjects, abrupt and pitched a bit too low.
For a moment, he’s transported to a roadside dive. He sees himself: twenty-seven, undead, orphaned and sick with it. So damn angry he can barely see straight. He sees Ellen, a matriarch with a .38 special and eyes made out of flint.
Dean’s jaw tightens, molars grinding together. An Arch member.
Cas’ head tips forward, posture sagging over the table, as he whispers, “
Dean frowns. “Is that... Is that porn?”
Forty years is a long time.
“Yeah, well,” he says, gruff. “I never really had, uh,” he wets his lip, shaking his head, “a Bill.” He gives her a tight smile, pressing his tongue against the roof of his mouth. The words taste wrong - but then, so does everything else.
Realization dawns, and Dean’s jaw goes slack.
been. It...” he trails off for a moment, then nods, definitive. “It deserves to be protected.”
long - life, he figures he’s seen just about everything.
A muscle in Kevin’s jaw twitches. “Automagically.”
Her eyebrows are drawn together in a guileless frown, the errant ray of sunshine lightening her hair, and she looks so very, very much like—
Dean’s throat goes tight again, his lungs compressing around his quick beating heart. Apropos of nothing, it occurs to him that his heart shouldn’t beat at all; he’s dead, after all.
far, actually, now that he’s thinking about it. “Even then?” he intones. “Even back then, you...?”
Dean sucks his teeth and grimaces. He’s not sure what it is, but Heaven missed the mark on this one. He’s sure it’s the same recipe as the roadside joint, but there’s something not quite right. It certainly doesn’t help that his pint glass keeps automagically refilling with Stella Artois instead of El Sol. He grumbles with every sip and pretends like the mild flavor isn’t growing on him. No way in hell is he letting Charlie turn him onto her trendy lesbian beer.
The implication hangs in the air between them, and Dean gives an imperceptible nod. Dean’s no Dr. Phil, but he knows himself well enough to acknowledge this particular truth. And Sam had pulled enough armchair psychiatry on him over the years to nearly convince him there was no shame in it.
“Thank you,” Cas murmurs, and it’s soft and a little soppy and so very, very
Dean groans. Again with the rusty nail. “It was

there?”
Kevin shrugs and hunches forward, eyes settling again on his book. “Senior members of the Arch. Angels mostly.” He breathes out a little sound that might be a laugh. “Pretty sure a couple of them are just graffiti.”
Kevin holds Dean’s gaze for a split second, face inscrutable, before hunkering back down over his work.
Sam blows out a gust of air. “Yeah.” He snorts a dull laugh and shakes his head. “Stupid, really. I was retired, what, twenty years before I...”
Dean gets a sudden, painful urge to hug the kid. He takes a faltering step forward to do just that, and the amulet jostles in his pocket.
Mary makes a little noise in her throat. “Three times,” she whispers.
Ellen barks a dry laugh. “Oh honey, it never woulda worked with you and Jo.”
, he thinks. Angelic mouth? He smirks a little bit.
Dean splays his hands in a shrug. “I contain multitudes.”
There’s a sour note in Sam’s voice, a sort of self-censure that Dean knows all too well. He supposes he’s not the only one whose baggage followed him to Heaven, but he finds he’s not glad for the company.
...” She peers up at his face, and whatever she sees has her brow furrowing deep. She shakes her head once and grabs the bottle, tipping the mouth toward the water-spotted glass as she says, “I think you taught yourself not to want it.”
Charlie’s lips turn down in a dramatic pout. “Stella Artois.”
Only one chapter left! :)
He keeps his eyes closed as he does every morning, hoping the flat darkness will pull him back, away from the brink of consciousness. He remembers Billie, forty-something years ago, threatening to cast his soul into the Empty; no Heaven, no Hell - just eternal sleep afloat in the void.
. This is...” He breathes out a little sound that might be a laugh. “This is happiness bedrock, Dean.”
Then again, he can’t think of anyone who knows grief better.
Dean shakes his head and gives a little shrug. “Yeah, ‘course,” he says, gruffer than intended.
— “It’s pretty close to Sam’s place,” he posits, which is ostensibly true. “And I—”
A pit yawns open in Dean’s stomach. He’s found a lot of things in Heaven - some he’d lost, some he’d never had - but
Sam smiles at that but briefly, before his lips purse, face growing somber. Dean knows Sam too well - how he thinks, how he operates, how he’s smart as a damn whip. Dean knows
Dean smiles, though something is pinching in his chest. His nephew - his namesake - is still down there, crawling across the earth. Dean knows he’ll meet him one day, but there’s an ache near his heart for all the years he’s already missed.
He takes a shallow breath and tries again. “I don’t need you to say—” he licks his lip, head shaking, “—whatever it is you came out here to say.”
Dean follows suit. As the lager touches his tongue, he’s tempted to make a face - just on principle - but he can’t quite bring himself to do it. The flavor is mild, the bubbles fine and buoyant, and it cools his throat against the warm spring air.
, Ishim says to Cas in the cathedral in Dean’s head.
Dean’s smile goes sharp, and he leans forward on his stool, jutting his chin out to the side in a gamely nod. “Rack ‘em.”
Sam pauses briefly, and Dean follows his eyes as they climb to the faraway mountains, silhouetted in the afternoon sun.
Dean breathes out a sigh. There’s a sheen growing in Cas’ eyes, something exhausted and aching, angry and
Sam gives him an opaque look, then turns toward the cookout. Eileen and Jo are dragging a grumbling Ellen toward the water. Mary’s sprawled out on the grass with her feet in John’s lap, laughing up at the sky.
“Hey,” Charlie demurs, “you don’t get to say anything about cartoon porn, I’ve seen your browser history.” Dean rolls his eyes even as his face warms, but doesn’t offer a defense.
Dean’s jaw clenches. “Ellen Harvelle,” he says, voice pitched low.
She gives him a look that goes right through him - compassionate, or maybe pitying. Her mouth turns down like she can hear his thoughts, and he bites his cheek, shamefaced.
As it stood, he’d shrugged and tapped on the message from Sam. He’d typed out a brief response -
This time, Dean isn’t sure he knows what any of those words mean. He squints at her, shaking his head.
“And I get it, ya know,” Sam continues, cutting through the reverie. “You...” he sighs and peers at Dean, mouth pursing. “You lost a lot of the things that made you happy. I know that.” He shakes his head. “But...”
laughed.
She notices, he’s sure, but she only tips her head in a nod. “Okay.”
“Heaven operates on the power of desire,” he says, tone flat. “Wish Magic, essentially, but...” he trails off on a weary sigh. “It isn’t perfect. You may have—” he shrugs a shoulder, the movement jerky and a little strange, “—thought of this place in passing, and...”
That could be any number of people. Eileen, Jo, Ellen. His parents, Bobby. Even Charlie has offered a hand here and there.
“Ishim.”
Kevin gives a crooked half smile and nods toward the map. “Your little forest,” he says. “Where is it?”
Baby rumbles against Dean’s back, purring as she idles at the roadside.
right
There was a brief period in his youth (though at the time, it seemed unending), when Dean was entirely mute. He doesn’t remember much of it - only flashes of emotion and vague imagery. The teary-eyed frustration as his mouth shaped the words, the breath evaporating in his throat. John’s hands - callused and clammy - clutching at his shoulders, blue-bagged eyes begging him to speak. The fingers had pressed nearly hard enough to bruise, the breath on Dean’s face sour and fermented.
Dean Winchester, Jr is
Dean’s not sure what he deserves, but eternal sleep hadn’t sounded so bad. Still doesn’t.
Dean nods, though his stomach goes taut. He hadn’t caught sight of the rift, but he’d seen the Harvelles’ old pick-up trudging across the bog, maybe a mile out from his bunker. He’s got enough friends in the Arch to know that rifts aren’t uncommon, that pass-through is usually minimal, that the Arch can handle it. He also knows they could always use another set of hands, more boots on the ground, as many seasoned, able-bodied hunters as they can get.
“They were my last words, Dean,” Cas grumbles, and fuck, Dean isn’t ready for this. “My will, my- my
Dean didn’t know Jo’d joined up, but he supposes he could’ve guessed. Hero complexes, piss and vinegar, after all - the sword Jo’d lived and died by.
For a moment, nothing happens. He frowns down at the amulet, turning it between his hands. Then there’s a soft pop and a little sizzle, and the metal begins to glow, warming against his palm.
His eyes catch on something high up on the far wall - not a window, but a block of text in a language Dean doesn’t recognize. It looks to be handwritten in some sort of deep gold paint. It glows faintly against the eggshell wall.
Dean halts his stride, one foot dangling uselessly in the air. He doesn’t remember the drive from the hayfield, doesn’t know why he’s here, rather than alone in his dark little bunker, rather than floating in the endless abyss of the Empty. He doesn’t know why the sun beats down on his back, why the eden that surrounds him feels like a wasteland.
Cas turns another page. “If it’s supernatural in origin, yes. But the magic of Heaven is purely divine.”
Dean snorts.
“Even if he joins the Arch,” she continues as if he hadn’t spoken. Her voice is ardent but still gentle, and she leans forward. “He’s not going anywhere. He—” she huffs and tips her head side to side. “He might get a little banged up, maybe, but—”
Dean’s vision blurs, going hazy at the edges, and he remembers.
be more than a blip on his radar.
... I know he’s got a lot to say. He just...” she pauses for a moment, then shrugs her shoulders. “He doesn’t really know how to say it. He knows he—” she cuts herself off with a quick shake of her head. “Well,” her hands raise in a brief shrug. “It’s his truth to tell.”
Cas is an archangel -
He glances back up at Sam to find his expression has gone pensive. There’s a wariness in the straight set of his mouth, belied by a shrewd sort of softness in his eyes.
He’s not sure how long he’s been sitting here. Time provides no dimension in Heaven; there are no seconds, no days, no seasons for him to count. Perhaps that’s a good thing; Dean imagines that if time were numerable here, he’d be scratching tally marks into his bedroom wall - a prisoner of war in a darkened cell.
Dean huffs. “She better.”
“Shut up.”
No. Shut up. Just—
“I didn’t really,” he says eventually. “Quit, I mean. Eileen and I, we—” he tips his head side to side, “we slowed down, I guess, when we found out about Junior.” He heaves a short chuckle and hunches forward. “Those first couple years after he was born were...” He pauses for a moment, combing his fingers through his hair with a fond smile. “He was more than enough monster for both of us.”
- to die by her cool, white hands.
It doesn’t make him—
He sees Cas bow his head in his peripheral vision. “Time is—”
Sam’s jaw clicks shut, and he turns to stare at Dean with sharp eyes, head angled just so. He’s got that look he gets sometimes - like everything is illuminated, like he knows too much - and Dean feels as if he’s made of spun glass. Transparent.
“I can’t...” he murmurs and purses his chapped lips. “I can’t- ‘forget the past,’ Dean.” The words sound colder, harsher than when Dean said them a moment ago. Dean shakes his head, but Cas only glances down at his hands. “And I wouldn’t want to. Even if I could.”
Dean breathes out a mildly bewildered laugh, pressing his forehead to the bottle in his hands. “You
Dean’s tempted to raise his arms - to dance into the storm like when he was a boy - but a soft touch near his heart stills him.
His stomach clenches.
“Catch anything good?”
Dean’s eyes fall shut, and a sigh gusts out of him, emptying his lungs.
Ellen’s hands freeze, and she glances up at Dean, circumspect. She holds his eyes for a brief moment, then smiles down at her little glass tower.
He stares at her for a moment, feeling wrong-footed and a little short-changed, then peers through the open French doors toward the mountainside. He scans his memories, steering clear of the ugly ones that present themselves first, looking for something -
“That’s not—” he starts, then shakes his head, lips pursing. “I’m fine,” he says, bald and unyielding. “I’m good.”
Cas looks over his shoulder in the vague direction of the noise. Dean tracks his gaze to the two long work tables at the rear, cluttered with various odds and ends. He spots a mortar and pestle, a few little glass vials strewn haphazardly about, a couple candles, and a short stack of books. He recognizes the binding - the same as the ones in the Library.
Dean knows that too. “I know that too.”
He’s close enough now that Cas has to tip his head back to meet Dean’s eyes. The movement stretches the length of his throat, sharpening the line of his jaw. His lips are a downturned bow, his eyes a deeper blue than Dean’s ever seen them.
Dean feels his brow drop low, shoulders going stiff. “What,” he grumbles.
” he says, incredulous.
Kevin notes the location, tapping the spot with his finger. A tiny block of text appears next to the cluster, its symbols strange and unfamiliar.
Apparently not to Kevin, though. He stops on a page about halfway through, tapping his finger near the top.
than a man.
Bobby purses his lips and grunts out a cryptic ‘hmph,’ then turns his back to Dean, setting his spoils on the table.
“After,” John murmurs, and Dean looks up at him. His hazel eyes are still shining, red-rimmed, tracing over the distant skyline. “When we lost her, I... All I wanted,” his brow drops in a frown, “all I could think about was...” He trails off for a moment, chewing his lip. “Chasin’ that storm.”
Sam gives him a funny look, squinty-eyed and confused. “I made an appointment.”
“You’re a good kid,” he says, and the sincerity in his voice has Dean’s shoulders going tense, “but...” He trails off, jaw working like he’s chewing his tongue. After a moment he continues. “There’s a reason you ain’t seen hide nor feather of your angel in half a damn century.”
She shrugs and chugs the last inch of her beer in a great swallow. “I guess?” she says, voice thick. “I don’t know.” She belches for a solid three seconds, and Dean turns his lips down, impressed. “Got the feeling it was kinda...” she tips her head side to side, “top secret? Maybe not, like, nuclear football level, but… something.”
Mary sighs, amused and resigned. “
“You drew me a map once.”
Digging his fingernails into his knuckles, he wonders when exactly he forgot how to play it cool.
instead of callin’ a damn ambulance.”
Her lips go wide in a smug smile as she slips her hands under the bar. They reappear a second later, three scuffed little shot glasses clinking in each, and she slides them onto the counter.
A vague silhouette appears behind the bar, tan hands sliding onto the counter at the top of Dean’s eyeline. Dean clenches his jaw and keeps his eyes down, half expecting it’s the barkeep come to cut him off.
A muscle twitches in Dean’s jaw. In some forty odd years, he can’t recall Sam ever having said those precise words.
His voice is gravelly, nearly broken when he speaks. “Why are you
“That…” Cas whispers, and a cord in his neck flexes as he swallows. “That was
His gaze flicks back and forth between Cas’ limpid eyes, and he whispers, finally, “I want it to
Dean’s eyebrows pop up, and he feels a sort of mild, obligatory guilt uncurl in his stomach. Frankly, he’d all but forgotten about the infinite other universes that Chuck - in his epic, cosmic bitch fit - had dusted just for kicks.
Ellen’s eyebrows pop up, and she smiles wide. “She loves it,” she crows, tipping her head toward the bar’s saloon style doors. “She and Bill’re runnin’ rounds as we speak.” Her eyes go distant and the slightest bit shiny. “Huntin’ with her daddy,” she intones with a soft smile, “like she always wanted.”
“You said your piece,” Dean says, voice carrying on the breeze. “When I wanna hear it again,” he takes a small, deliberate step forward, “I’ll ask.”
Her mouth is a straight line, but there’s a smirk in her eyes that has the corner of Dean’s lips ticking up in a cocky grin. “Big talk,” he says and grabs a shot in a loose fist. He holds it up in a vague toast, grunting a sporting, “Cheers.”
She wasn’t wrong. For all Dean played the loyal son - the at-will soldier - he was under no illusions that John was anything other than a deadbeat dad. But there was something more to it - something he didn’t explain to Rhonda as she’d fingered at his bruises, that he
Dean’s mouth moves before his brain does. “Even—” Dean bites his tongue, incisors digging into the tip, then shakes his head. He’s already come this far -
Sam smiles at that and shakes his head. “Right, well,” he goes on. “Eileen and I took a few years off, til Junior was old enough to...” he shakes his head again, shrugging his shoulders. “We didn’t want to lie to him, ya know?”
Cas’ eyes flutter closed, brow forming a pained line. “Dean—”
Ellen is unfazed, as ever, and she tips her head, giving a mild hum. “She was older than you were,” she says. “More independent. And she didn’t see it happen, just...” she shrugs and tosses the rag into the sink. “One day, Daddy didn’t come home.”
Dean shakes his head. “What.”
Dean sucks in a briny breath. “We’re fishin’ now,” he says, tone sharp with a certitude he doesn’t feel.
Heaven is much the same - perceptive and generous - and it leaves Dean feeling just as he had that night with Pam. Vulnerable, flayed open.
Dean blinks hard - once, twice - and something rattles in his chest. “Cas,” he whispers.
A memory comes unbidden, floating to the surface of his mind. Him and John, sitting on wet boulders coated in algae, casting lines into the murky creek a couple miles from home. They’d left Mom back at the house, curled up on the sofa with Sammy, barely an infant at the time.
“Kevin sign you up for a library card?” Dean interjects with a crooked smile.
Dean knows that. “I know that.”

“What face?” Charlie grumbles. “All I see is a
say without making him sound crazier than he rightfully is. Fortunately, Kevin is already pushing back his chair and rising to his feet. He comes around the desk at a trot and descends the stairs.
Sam hadn’t spoken a word - just raised an eyebrow at Lee’s boxers and undershirt strewn across the floor, and handed Dean a Mars Bar he’d lifted from the Gas ‘n Sip. Precocious little shit.
" to skip the scene.
“Well,” John goes on. “Somethin’ musta come over him, cuz he—” another soft laugh, “—he threw it all in the trunk, loaded me up in the car, and. Off we went.” John moves in Dean’s peripheral vision - tilting his head, Dean thinks. “Hopped on 35, drove til we hit Evergreen. Set up camp, roasted a few marshmallows for breakfast, then...” he gives a deep sigh, mild and contented. “Fished until the sun went down.”
Dean’s hands tighten around the old rod, and he blinks to clear his vision. “Did it to me too,” he murmurs.
He doesn’t miss the earth - not really. He’d never say as much out loud, but he’d lived far longer than he’d ever wanted to - ever meant to. He was tired when he asked Sam to stay with him, to finally let him go, and even here, on the other side of the pearly gates, that weariness hasn’t faded.
Dean’s face goes hot then cold - the thing growing in his chest reaching some sort of critical mass - and the words resound in his head:
Dean swallows. “Read about it in the, uh,” a dry chuckle, “New New Testament.” He takes another tiny step forward, and he’s nearly to the table now. “King Jack Version,” he huffs out with a half-hearted smirk.
The whole thing is a sprawling map. Not the sort he’d seen on his phone, but the sort at the beginning of a fantasy novel, with little hand-drawn forests and ink-flowing rivers. Dean stares for a moment, dumbfounded, his eyes running over the fine details and cross-hatching.
“Not yet,” he says instead.
Cas hunches forward, spine forming a wearied curve. “Nothing has changed for me,” he intones, and his voice is restrained and waterlogged, fathoms deep.
Smooshed up against one wall is a rudimentary drawing of what looks like a fluffy kitten clinging to a tree branch. Underneath, scrawled in plain English:
“I think,” she begins, pulling the stopper from the bottle, “there might be something you thought you couldn’t have.”
The door is open.
Dean rolls his eyes and waits until she comes around the corner with two dark bottles of IPA. “Why are your curtains closed?”

Dean starts and cranes his neck around. Sam is coming up the pier at a jog, grinning wide. Dean gives him a wan smile, edging into a chuckle when Sam catches a face full of moss from an old cypress.
him, and he feels like he had just after Mary had burned - like he’s standing on a snowy slope in the imminence of an avalanche, like the softest spoken word will bury him in debris.
An easy silence falls between them, soft and a little wondrous. Heaven is a strange sort of place, Dean’s found, and it gives him a strange sort of feeling. Dean thumbs absently at the reel and wonders if Sam’s felt it, too - the tight fullness in his chest as something expands behind his rib cage; the warm flutter in the pit of his stomach.
Dean could turn and look, face the man seated next to him - but he doesn’t. He’d know that scent anywhere: wet leather and gun oil, whiskey and sea salt.
Dean rolls his eyes and bumps his shoulder against Sam’s. “Yeah. That.”
That last one carves a fault through Dean’s mind. Ishim had nearly killed Cas, had him supine and bloodied on the cold floor. Dean’s hand had hovered over a banishing sigil, a plea in Cas’ eyes begging him to use it, to smear his grace across the cosmos if only to save Dean’s life.
Sam nods. “Yeah. I mean,” he gestures vaguely with the little menu, “Eileen says he does a lot of work for the Arch, but...” He trails off for a short moment then shrugs. “We’ve been here for a while. I sorta figured he would’ve... dropped in by now?”
Sam rolls his eyes around a tiny smile. “Shut up.”
John sighs, heavy and pained. “Shoulda taken you fishin’.”
,” John repeats. He blinks hard, and a few errant tears spill over. Dean tracks them, wide-eyed, as they trail down John’s ruddy cheeks, disappearing into the wisps of his beard.
“Cas, I—” Dean sucks in a sharp breath, the air putrefying in his throat. “I can’t—”
Dean had stood there, arms stiff and hands fisted, irritation warring with a swell of dread. Then he’d shaken himself, straightened his spine, and set off down the narrow dirt path amongst the trees.
. Dean.”
, Dean had said once, as he’d pulled Cas away from Heaven.
The question hangs, floating on the salted air, and a cumulus cloud crawls over the sun. The light bends and shifts.
Black wings.
Dean brings his knees to his chest, folding his arms across them. “Why...” he trails off for second, the weight of Sam’s stare pressing the words back down his throat. He harrumphs, cutting his gaze across the pasture to the shoreside picnic, and tries again.
“Pulled him out of the Empty,” Dean offers.
Here in Heaven, Sam and Mary are quite alike: happy, whole, and ready for a new life - a new fight.
Dean frowns. Someone who understands Heaven and knows how to protect it; an angel, certainly - maybe a strategist or a soldier. But someone compassionate, too - someone devoted the people here, these wandering wayward souls.
Dean stares at her back where the knobs of her spine meet her neck, her shoulder blades distorting the periwinkle plaid of her blouse. She turns around, her eyes fixed on her prize, thumbs smoothing over the simple wood frame.
An old abandoned barn appears in Dean’s head - the twin of the one just beyond the mountains. A man with limpid blue eyes set in a wide, stark face stands in the wake of high winds and dancing sparks.

“You, on the other hand,” Ellen’s voice cuts through Dean’s rambling thoughts, and he peers up into her frowning face. She shakes out the towel and runs it over the countertop between them, giving Dean a furrow-browed look, all sympathy and sufferance. “I don’t think you been a kid since you lost your mama.”
Dean feels a twinge of guilt in his throat and swallows it down. “Mm,” he nods. “Eileen’s gonna join. And lord knows wherever she goes—”
Cas is silent for a moment, still like a statue. The breeze picks up, tinkling the wind chimes at Dean’s side.
As it stands, it’s only ever dark when Dean closes his eyes, and if Heaven is a prison... well. At least, there’s beer.
The road through the pass had been tortuous, winding across the mountain in steep slopes and sharp turns. Dean had ridden the clutch hard, one hand on the wheel, the other patting the dash - soothing Baby as she climbed the jagged hills. The descent had been slow and smooth; foot gentling the brake, he’d soared down the mountainside, and the vista rose before him like a sunrise.
Dean looks up and finds Cas staring at him, brow furrowed. Dean’s eyes meet Cas’ sunken ones, and Cas turns back to his book.
Dean’s stomach clenches taut, even as a smile comes unbidden. He remembers Sam peering over his shoulder as they’d stood on the bridge, his mouth slack and eyes liquid. Dean had known without looking who stood behind him. Sam had gone to her on shaky legs that crumbled beneath him as he reached her. Dean’s vision had gone blurry, and he’d turned away from them, eyes squinting out at the sunlit mountain.
“Hey!”
“‘The other angel.’”
Wait. What? “You- the Library?” Is Charlie making magic plutonium bombs for everyone now? “How’d you get in?”
Dean should have called before he came.
Charlie gives him an unimpressed glare and hoists herself off the couch. “I’m a chapstick power alpha, thank you very much.”
. He pushes his forefinger against the red stone, face screwing up in a wince. It depresses and clicks into place.
Charlie rolls her eyes and skips towards the kitchen, tapping the Yoda bobble head on the bookshelf as she passes it. There are several other action figures on the shelf, and a bunch of other tchotchkes, most of which he can barely make out in the dim fluorescent light. He glances over at the windows framing the dining table; he figures Charlie’s gotta have a great view, being situated so near the lake. But the curtains - done in a deep, velvety purple that looks like some sort of magic fur - are drawn, the afternoon light pooling just around the bottom.
“So,” Kevin says, setting his pen down finally. “You’re here.” He looks up at Dean, and his eyes are dark, lined with crow’s feet. “Did you...” He pauses for a moment, head tilted in mild expectation, “...need something?”
“Ya know what, though?” Dean whispers, and he feels the corner of his mouth pull up in a wry smile. “I think I figured it out.”
Dean holds his gaze for barely a second, then looks down at his feet. His boots are scuffed, layered in fine dust. He glances at the floor - pristine white marble shot through with gold rivulets - and wonders if he’s tracked dirt onto it. He figures he must’ve done. It’s sort of his M.O., after all. Messing things up.
And perhaps he is.
“You’re
them.
“Toodles!” Charlie says, and the line clicks dead.
Cas stands at one of the work tables at the other end of the barn, bagged eyes fixed on the open book before him. He tilts his head towards Dean, but doesn’t look up at him.
“You could have that too, you know,” Ellen says, eyes fixed on the basin. “A Moment.”
Ugh, of course they did. “Gross.”
,” she’d whispered tearfully. “
Dean swallows the words.
“Yeah,” John whispers back. “We sat by the big window, the four of us.” The bay window, Dean recalls, overlooking the street. The whole block was dark from the power outage; the thunder shook the treetops. “Watched the storm all night long.”
He peers through the little door-side window, but the lights are off inside. Maybe no one’s home. Maybe they’re busy. Dean grimaces - maybe they’re
Cas is silent for a beat, and Dean peers up at him. His face has gone soft, mouth curving around a tiny smile. “I saw you the moment I arrived,” he murmurs.
Fifty-something years ago, Dean had worked a case at a little university somewhere in Maine.
He runs his tongue over his chapped lips and clicks in the green stone, then the blue one.
Dean stares for a second, jaw working soundlessly. Then he bites down on the inside of his cheek, giving Kevin a tight, crooked smile. “Oh, just,” he gives a twitchy shrug. “Thought I’d stop by.”
“How ya doin, kid?” she asks, tipping the mouth of the bottle over each glass.
An image floats to the surface of Dean’s mind: Jo, young and gung-ho, twirling a little knife inscribed with her dad’s initials. Dean had told her how John had taken him shooting when he was a boy, how he’d hit every can dead on.
Ellen’s lips turn down, and she grasps the bottle between her palms. She turns it idly for a moment, then reaches into the sink for a shot glass, plopping it down on the counter between them.
Dean’s stomach clenches, eyes tracing over Cas’ low-lit form. In the liminal space between the shadows of the trees, his body looks strange - more like a bending of light than a corporeal figure. It occurs to Dean that Cas has no need of a vessel in Heaven, that he has likely restructured his true form for the sole purpose of looking as Dean remembers him.
Awareness creeps in, unbidden and inescapable.
Between the two of them, destruction and devastation had become something like status quo, nearly commonplace in its almost constant recurrence, but—
Dean feels his spine go stiff, brow furrowing low.
And yet.
In hindsight, Dean probably should have known that already. Sam had mentioned Junior’s ‘partner’ Alex before - but frankly, Dean had figured that was just Sam being precious about it. He’d assumed Alex was an
rage, “—I knew what losing her did to you.”
Dean prefers the open road.
“Our backyard,” he murmurs, and feels his lips quirk up.
“But,” Sam sighs, and Dean looks up at him. He’s staring down at his wringing fingers, hair obscuring his eyes and shoulders sagging. “I’m just...”
Cas tips his head side to side. “Thereabouts, yes.”
The steps are short and shallow; he takes them two at a time until he comes to the landing. Up close, the building looks bigger, the door a huge, imperial thing towering several feet over his head. It’s a smooth, dark wood, its wide panels inlaid.
would mean love for all humankind.” He tips his head toward the inscription. “

carved on the front, and he’s running what Dean imagines is the celestial Library of Congress, and Kevin is finally -
Dean had heard it anyway.
Sam gives a slow nod. “Right,” he murmurs back, face going oddly soft. Dean frowns up at him, and Sam schools his expression back into business mode. “Right,” he repeats and licks his lip. “Problem is, Cas is just a seraph. He doesn’t have the juice to run this place. So, Jack—” He reaches across the table for the book and turns it towards himself, flipping it open to a page bookmarked with a gold ribbon. He smoothes his pointer finger over a line of text and reads, “
“Over the river and through the woods,” he murmurs, and he pulls onto the road in a cloud of gravel dust.
Her eyebrows make a sympathetic shape, and she pulls her hand back. Dean’s shoulders relax, just slightly.
“I check the bathroom, kitchen, whole damn house, but—” John’s voice drops to a thick whisper, “—I can’t find you anywhere.” He swallows loud, and Dean sees his bob drift further out as his hands slacken on the rod. “Sammy’s still cryin’, Mary’s losin’ it, and I’m—” a bitter chuckle, “—‘bout ready to pull my hair out. Then I- I look out the kitchen window and... There you are.”
“You’re standin’ out in the backyard. Wearin’ your—” a wet laugh that Dean’s never heard from him before, “your little blue onesie. It’s got this- this big ol’ bumblebee printed on the back.” He laughs again, head shaking. “It’s soaked through.
Dean feels a broad, bitter smile crack his face like a fault line. “Busy,” he repeats, choking out a laugh.
His thumb brushes against the phone’s screen, and he glances down when it illuminates.
He just... what?
Cas’ eyes fall closed at that, shoulders sagging low. His spine forms a desolate curve, and he finally meets Dean’s eye.
Ellen tips her head, sharp-eyed and considering. Dean holds his counterfeit smile for a moment, the weight of her gaze pulling his lips down; then he drops his eyes to his hands, fingers laced and wringing on the bar.
There’s a soft click and a groaning creak. Dean turns toward the sound just as the amulet winks out and falls, clinking as it lands. He stoops down to pick it up; it’s cool to the touch now, and Dean shakes his head. As he slides it into his pocket, a musty draft hits his face - the scent of old paper and tanned leather tickling his nose.
Sam blinks, slow and deliberate, and says, “I know.”
“It’s a domicile,” he murmurs, squinting at the little symbols.
Charlie’s posture is stiff, her eyes round with manufactured innocence. She was a shit liar when she was alive, and she’s an even shittier one dead.
. Cas’ brow furrows, and he takes an abortive step forward, reaching out a hand.
Ellen gives a humming laugh and sets about lining up the little glasses. She grabs the bottle by the neck, and the stopper gives a satisfying pop as she pulls it.
“How’s Dad?” he asks lowly, and regrets it immediately.
you wanted,” she returns.
Hand fisted, raised, poised before the solid oak door - but Dean doesn’t knock. He should’ve called before he came.
Sam is silent for a moment longer, and his head turns slowly toward Dean. “There was lightning.”
She carries on, heedless of Dean’s momentary lapse. “And because you’re,” she huffs a dry laugh, “well,
As he’d approached, he’d noticed an odd stillness in the structure - a hollow sort of silence, stilted and uncharged. A quick peek inside had confirmed what he’d already surmised:
Her glass refills itself, bottom to top, an inch of fluffy white head settling over translucent gold. Dean’s brows rise, and his lips tick up. “See now,
He doesn’t know, he doesn’t
“You’re late.”
‘yonder’ and floored it for forty damn years.
It’s a little different than the last time he was here. The forest is new - if it could even be called a forest; Dean’s counted twenty-three charred, spindly trees. They provide a sparse canopy, shrouding the old barn in speckled half-light. The facade is mostly unchanged, though the red paint is a little more chipped, the foundation brickwork more weathered than he recalls. And of course, the weather is mild, warm and bright, with none of the storm clouds Sam had mentioned.
“You got somethin’ better?” he leers.
I could get used to.”
“What’s this?” he murmurs, pointing a finger at the tiny black and blue squiggle.
- is what he didn’t tell Rhonda. What he couldn’t tell Sam. What he barely understood himself.
“Four knives with twisted gold blades,” Sam posits, leaning forward. “Sound familiar?”
Kevin gives a hum of confirmation and continues his writing. Dean clenches his jaw against the sudden awkwardness; he feels out of place (which he is, it’s a frickin’
Sam’s face freezes, eyes darting away in mild embarrassment, and Dean snorts a startled laugh. “You’re shittin’ me.”
Dean looks away, brow furrowed. “‘Course I did,” he grunts out, throat tight.
“I, uh,” Dean starts and swallows hard. “I went past the mountain. To the—” he runs his tongue over his lip as Bobby squints at him, “—the forest in the field.”
Dean furrows his brow and peers down at the bottle. It’s crystal and shapely, its contents a deep, glittering amber, and Dean’s eyes catch on the shiny inlaid lettering across the front:
Dean swallows dryly and nods. “S’good.”
Human weakness.
Dean’s arm drops, flopping uselessly at his side, and his bicep aches. “Heya, Bobby,” he grunts out, forcing a smirk onto his mouth.
“It’s the spirit of Corinth,” she’d said, matter of fact. “Devastated and destroyed, but rebuilt stronger, better, every time.”
“Uh...” His eyes go wide as it glows brighter, nearly scalding him now. “Shit,
Kevin peers up at the verse again. “
Cas stands at the foot of a spindly oak tree, head craned back to stare up at the canopy.
Sam huffs a laugh. “Yeah. But,” he says and raises a forefinger, “Heaven’s not finished.” He makes a vague gesture towards the nearby window overlooking the forest. “Still isn’t.”
And in the distance, Dean had spotted the old barn in the little forest - a tiny black scar on the gilded plain.
Dean squints, perplexed. While he himself looks almost exactly as he did when he bit the bullet, nearly everyone else in Heaven looks younger than he remembers them; Charlie looks about the same as when he first met her, and his mom looks almost as she did in his childhood memories. Kevin, on the other hand, looks quite a bit
Charlie shrugs again, grabbing her controller to select a new fighter. “Stranger things, I guess.”
He extends a hand toward Cas’ retreating figure, mouth tripping over his name, and the light overhead flickers out. He spares barely an instant to glance at it, and when he turns back, Cas is gone.
Cas’ eyes shine a bright Carolina blue, his chapped lips curved in a bittersweet smile. “I found you,” he says, “the same way that...” he shakes his head, casting his eyes toward the ground, “... a sailor finds a lighthouse.”
Mary’s eyebrows scrunch together, and she sniffs. “She stayed with us. Til he came.”
, of all people), the private villa (courtesy of Charlie, though Dean still isn’t sure if she digitally finagled a lease or if she somehow owns the place), and a fifteen page color-coded itinerary - written, printed, and
Archangel - immortal and adamantine, now that God himself has destroyed his only weakness. And Dean is an eternal soul, freed from the bonds of his mortal body - limitless and enduring in the endless expanse of Heaven. They’re stood now on evener ground than they’ve ever been before.
Kevin lays the book on the table, rifling through the pages. Dean peeks over his shoulder, but the text is inscrutable, Greek to Dean.
Sam huffs a laugh, eyes rolling skyward. “Yeah. That.”
Dean’s spine stiffens, and he nods. Right. Some people do more in Heaven than just drive around in circles, listening to the same six cassettes on an endless loop.
Cas shakes his head, frowning mouth working soundlessly. The wind kicks up, scattering the little bees, and one lands on Cas’ throat before fluttering its tiny wings and buzzing away.
“Look, Dean,” Kevin says, sotto voce. “It’s...” he shakes his head, thumping his pen against his palm. “It’s nice to see you and all—”
Dean points. “There. I think.”
The painting slips from his fingers as Mary takes it back in her hands. She holds it gently, reverently, as she stands and walks around the table. Dean shakes his head to clear it, and watches as she replaces the little picture on the center of the wall. It looks, at once, as if it has always hung there, and like he’d drawn it but a moment ago.
years isn’t fucking long enough. “Cas—“
He cuts himself off, and his eyes flick side to side. Dean can tell he’s searching for a better word - something softer than the barbed, stinging one he’d just barely swallowed down.
Her skin looks like clouds, her eyes like the sky. She laces her fingers with Dean’s, and the tension across his back fades away.
It’s in his hand a moment later, his thumb hovering over the screen. There are no icons, no home screen, just a blank black surface. Like most things in Heaven, it seems to just... operate as expected - to do whatever it is he wants it to.
He shakes himself and peers down at the map. His eyes follow the mountain range, inked in broad jagged lines, to the river - a flowing swirl in a dull, washed blue. North of the mountain is a colorless expanse, marred only by a cluster of tiny dots.
,” Dean intones. He rolls the word around in his mouth, and it’s coming back to him now. “Charity?” he guesses.
Sam dips his head toward the bench. “Mind if I join?”
Charlie beams. “As a matter of fact, yes.”
He staggers toward the veranda, pausing to step into a pair of boxers that he’s pretty sure are his, and lumbers barefoot onto the stone tile under the awning.
Bobby hunches forward and rolls his eyes. “You ain’t here for a gab and a mint julep.”
Dean presses his tongue against the inside of his cheek, running the tip along the indents from his teeth. “And what might that be,” he says, dull and a little bitter.
He’s heard that one a few times, but it never quite rings true. They’d said the same thing about Hell, too; but Dean had felt every torturous second there, remembers them all in high-def technicolor, just as he remembers every bleak, desperate moment of his human life, just as he remembers the endless drive across Heaven, waiting for Sam to meet him at the bridge, sitting on his bench at the end of the pier, casting his line and never
“Actually,” Sam murmurs, and his voice sounds vague and a little strange. Dean peeks a look at Sam’s face in his peripheral vision to find he’s gone oddly pensive.
“Sam goes,” Mary finishes, her smile seeming to widen and soften at once. “He loves her,” she murmurs.
He sees Mary nod in his peripheral vision, and her finger taps on the little scribble near his thumb.
Dean gives her one back, though he feels a headache coming on. His teeth
exactly Cas had summoned the Empty, no mention whatsoever of the bedroom door he’d often found Dean stood in front of - unable to open, unable to turn away.
Dean feels his frown deepen, etching itself into his brow.
Lost for words, Dean casts his eyes about the study. Now that the door through which he entered is gone, there don’t seem to be any doors at all. He sighs and peers around at the walls; maybe there’s a window he can throw himself out of.
He cuts himself off, biting down hard on his tongue, but the damage is already done. Even so, he waits for Sam to ask, unsure if he can say the words unprompted - if he can even say them at all.
Stupid, really; it’s not like he doesn’t know how Cas feels. He’d known it when Cas had first said the words - bloodied and weeping, walking the plank. He’d known it when Cas had returned from the Void - pale and thin, with fragile bones and sunken eyes. He’d known it five days ago, when Cas had murmured
“A—” Dean starts, then shakes his head. “Someone
Dean smiles to himself, eyes roving over his apparent masterpiece before alighting on a strange scribble in the corner.
Maybe all that isn’t really Dean’s bag, but he’d hardly endanger it for a flash of lightning and a few drops of rain. Dean’s happiness has always been the incidental sort, anyway - happenstance and fleeting, ephemeral like morning fog.
Sam had been rather circumspect in those few months between Cas’ death and Dean’s own; no offhand utterances of his name, no needling questions about
Dean frowns, face warming. “Sorry, what?”
No sooner has Dean thought it than the arching stretch of a shadow blooms across the barn walls. It’s been years -
And Sam, as ever, doesn’t disappoint. “You been to see them?”
Ellen is silent for a long, gravid moment. The weight of her gaze pushes down on Dean’s shoulders, compressing his spine.
Bobby shifts forward in his seat, and Dean looks up at him, noting the heavy brow under the shadow of his ball cap.

Sam gives a solemn nod and taps his finger on the page. “Jack destroyed them -
Instantly, the tabletop is transformed. From the tight woodgrain rise sweeping swathes of squiggly lines, odd little symbols and soft, muted colors. Dean’s eyebrows shoot up, and he leans closer.
They sit in silence for a while, and Dean’s nearly halfway through his beer before Sam speaks.
Dismissed, Dean turns back to the latin inscription. He wracks his brain for Corinthians, but comes up empty; generally, everything he remembers from the Bible is out of Revelations, since he’d essentially lived his entire life in a state of on-again-off-again apocalypse.

“What else do you remember?” she asks, and her voice is mild and curious, lacking the censure Dean expected.
Certainly more than Dean, anyway.
—” He approaches the door in two long strides and smacks the amulet against the lacquered wood.
Something hot clenches in Dean’s stomach - an old forgotten shame he hadn’t felt since he’d made Lee climb bare-assed out the motel window just as Sam came through the door.
“So,” Cas grumbles back.
He’d given no response but a plastic smile, slipping two quarters into the Magic Fingers coin slot. They’d smoked the roach to ash and laughed at the tingling vibrations, Ina-Gadda-Da-Vida blaring from the boombox.
Silence reigns for a short moment, during which Dean stares down into his half-empty glass and pretends not to feel Bobby’s eyes on him.
Dean harrumphs into his shoulder, chewing on his tongue. “But?”
Cas had said in the tumult of rolling thunder, beneath the shadow of arching wings.
what Sam will ask next.
Dean blows out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and follows Cas’ eyes to the sea. There’s something fluttering in Dean’s throat, pressing at the backs of his teeth, waiting to slip out. Dean holds the tiny words on his tongue, tasting them on every inhale.
