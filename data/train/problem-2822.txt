“I wish mine could teach me that.  I’ve mostly been learning from books.”
Cas picked up the bottle of wine from the cart and poured a glass for Dean.  He poured himself a smaller glass.  “I’m sure it’ll be fine.”
“I think it’ll work for you, but I’m not sure,” Cas babbled nervously.  “I don’t know much about these things.”
Missouri had Dean select three stones and flip them over.  He didn’t recognize the symbols etched into the black stone.
The creature nodded its horse head and mewled at the knight.  It crawled pitifully after Dean as the man walked toward the water in the centre of the road.
There was a scuffling sound on the other end of the phone and some mumbled talk that Dean couldn’t make out.
“That might be best,” Dean said.  “It’s been a confusing day.  Your other son was here earlier.”
Jack grinned back at her.
“What did Cas say when you found him?”
It was never going to be alright.
The candle flames licked his flesh as he chanted out the ritual a fourth time.  The words hurt to say.  His eyes bled.  As he spoke the final syllables his vision exploded in stars and then blackness.
In the evening they began discussing what direction to go and how far they needed to travel.  Rowena took a rolled up map from a chest in her study.  She set the roll down on one end of the table and gave it a little push.  The map unrolled itself and stretched across the table.  The map kept unrolling, stretching well past the length of a blanket.  The table had fit the three of them comfortably that morning, but should not have accommodated the size of this map.  But the table kept expanding.  When the map had finished unraveling completely the table could have easily sat twelve people.  An expanding table like that alone was impressive.  But what pushed it into amazing territory was that the table didn’t seem to take up any more room. The cottage didn’t get any bigger and everything was still the same distance away from the table, but now the table was four times as big.  He could not decide if the table was grew itself or the map made it grow.
Castiel was shown to a lavish suite of rooms.  Far more room than he needed.  The bedroom alone was the size of Rowena’s entire cottage.  There was even a chamber to receive guests in.  He had no idea how many guests he would be entertaining while here, but he had more than enough space to do it with.
“Of course,” he extended his elbow for her to hold onto.  “My study is this way.”
All done.  Not a long piece here, but I didn't want to put it at the end of the last chapter.
“As promised, one pound of crushed chicken teeth.”
“No,” Sam told her.  “Cas will find a way to bring him back.  He’s gone to find a way for Dean to come back.”
“Jack is probably assurance against Mother,” Gilda guessed.  “He’s banking that Mother won’t move against him as long as he has Jack.”
Dean stood and closed his notepad.  He was surprised at the restraint Sam had shown by not poking fun of him for it.  He wasn’t grateful enough to say anything, but he was surprised.  Once the notepad was safely stowed in his room he went in search of a carrying case.  Something that would fit an object of unknown size and weight.
DEAN:  Come on.  You’re my friend, you have to help.
“I can do this,” Cas said.  “I’ll be fine.”
“Another game?” Dean asked.
The queen looked out onto the balcony.  “Interesting.”  She was quiet for an almost painful length of time.
Dean had always wanted to be a father one day.  He had never thought that the child he would raise would be a faerie changeling.  He wasn’t quite sure how to wrap his head around that information.  The queen had dismissed him almost immediately after announcing his ‘punishment’.  Then she hadn’t spoken to him at all.
“What happens if you don’t?” Castiel asked.
“Are you okay?”
Missouri ignored him and looked at Cas.  “At that point you’ll have a little chat with your brother.”
Sorry about the delay with posting this.  Work has been exhausting.
“Sorry, I’m getting a little off topic.  My point is that people like us don’t always get a lot of happy in our lives.  Sometimes the happiness isn’t there and sometimes we just don’t reach out and take it.”
“Well, the king offered me a job in the sense that I can take the job of advising him through this crisis or I can sit in his dungeon until I have my head removed.  His wording was quite…forceful.”
Dean had waved aside the man’s protests.  “Made it accurate.  The healers say it was the drink that killed him, but he died when mother did.”
The fawn almost vibrated when Dean scratched gentle behind its ears.  It danced in place for a moment and than bounded over toward its mother who decided play time was over and led it back into the trees.
“I didn’t do anything.”
The Faerie didn’t wait for Dean to attack again.  Instead he launched himself back over the desk at Dean.  Dean had better reach with his sword, but Zachariah was faster.  Faster than he should have been.  Dean found himself on the defensive as he sought to avoid the flurry of knives coming at him.
The hall was full of celebrants.  Dean thought they’d been at the ceremony, but the details were sketchy on that front.  He glanced around the room until he found Cas.  His husband was talking with a pompous looking man and an equally pompous looking woman.  They looked like they might be merchants or ambassadors.  He wasn’t sure.  He’d never seen them before.  Whoever they were they thought highly of themselves.  Cas looked bored, but was being polite.  He thought about rescuing him.  It was the right thing to do.  Besides, he was a knight and knights came to the rescue.
“Might be a bit of a problem on his wedding night,” Gabriel told them.
The ride away from the battle to whatever this ruin was had not alleviated his concerns at all.  Dean was clearly more injured than he had initially thought.  He knew that they needed to leave the area, it wasn’t safe to stay, but he didn’t like forcing Dean to move.  The knight had been quiet during the ride.  Castiel looked over constantly to make sure he was still in the saddle.  It almost looked like he was asleep, but he would perk up and look around occasionally.  Sometimes he would mutter something that Castiel couldn’t quite hear.
“Just lay down like the vermin you are,” Zachariah told him.  “Get out of my way and just die.”
Dean’s eyes widened.  “You must be Barb.  I spoke with your husband Greg earlier.  I think I can help.”
“I’ll get the horses,” Dean told them.  He started walking toward the doorway that Cas and the horses had disappeared through earlier.  The excitement of the fight was wearing off and he could feel some fatigue setting in.  Accompanying it was some soreness.  He was already starting to feel the effects of being bashed around by a dragon.  Even if it was only a fairy in disguise.  This was going to make for a great story at some point.
A voice sang out in delight.  “The first to cross my lake is safe, but the second is mine by ancient pact.”
“I think I already got this speech from Lucifer,” Dean told them.  “He threatened to remove my arms.”
“If I did that how would I get a chance to talk with you?”
“I have a contract that says you get to,” Dean said.  “If you’re nice I might let you read it.  Your mother is a stickler for details.”
“It’s a beautiful morning to be summoning fiends,” Lucifer said dryly.  “I’ll take that wall down.  Don’t worry about that.  And don’t worry about the bogarts either.  Lilith will keep her word.  She’s almost here.”  Lucifer pointed to a dark fog bank that was building on the western edge of the valley.
“Did you get along with him?”  Sam asked.  “Any hard feelings between you two?”
“Better?”  Dean asked.
The Men of Letters had kept their bunker well stocked.  When they’d first moved in Dean and Sam had to replace all the perishables, but most of the stuff was still very useable.  Sam had practically fainted over the library.  Hell, he still gushed over it.  Their library had books in it written in languages that Dean had never even heard of on topics that he had never even thought of.  Dean wasn’t a book man, but he could tell the Men of Letters had sunk a lot of time and money into those books.  He guessed that when the bunker was active that a lot of people had spent most of their time in the library.
Zachariah tried to pull it free, but it stuck fast.
Dean squeeze Cas’ hand.  “I’ll be here if you need me.  Not sure what I’ll be able to do, but I’ll be here.”
“What would I steal from a cradle?  A baby?  Why would I steal a baby?”
“I know Poppa.  I could have hurt her.  She should have my knight.”
Castiel sighed in relief.  He didn’t have a sleeping baby, but at least he had a quiet one.
“Do you want it back right now?”
“Did you enjoy your pie?”
“Another touchy subject I see,” the man said.  “But if you’re really a knight, why are you still here?”
“Then let’s get this part over with.”  Castiel rode his horse next to Baby and gestured to the road.  “Lead on Sir Knight.”
Sam dropped a heavy tome on the table.  “So I guess I should take all the information I dug up on the Bender clan and their lands and go away.  Let me help Dean.”
“Be careful,” Castiel warned.  “These are rumoured to tear a man in half with a single bite.”
“It’s perfect,” Dean repeated.  “What did you make it from?”
Castiel ate a small meal alone.  He had pulled extra food from the bag, but Dean didn’t touch it.  He turned in early as well.  With no wood for a fire there wasn’t much to see.  And without Dean to talk to there wasn’t any real reason to stay awake.
“I won’t intrude any longer on your celebration.  Congratulations to you both.”
“Bruising aside, you’ll be fine,” she told him.  “I’d avoid more fighting, but you knights never do.”  She shook her head and walked back to the knight with the broken arm.  “This will still be unpleasant.”
Castiel quickly began emptying Dean’s pack.  The blankets and spare clothes were tossed aside.  They wouldn’t be helpful right now. The chess set was discarded as well.  He noted the second potion Rowena had given them.  That would be useful later.  He found a bundle of cloth that was wrapped around a faintly glowing spoon.  Why on earth did Dean have Castiel’s spoon tucked in his pack?  He’d deal with that later.  There was nothing here that would help either.
A set of double doors opened into a sitting room that led into a hallway.  They almost literally ran into a pompous looking man that Castiel had never seen before.  He might be one of Charlie or Gilda’s courtiers, he was too well dressed to be one of the servants.
“Maybe we should talk about whatever is on your mind,” Cas said.  “I don’t mind.  I like talking with you.”
“I don’t know,” the man said.  The redness from his exertion was being replaced by a redness of irritation.  “Witches are crazy folks and I just want my horse back.”
Things had not gone according to plan.  Dean sighed and stared into the cup in his hands.  He was not a heavy drinker normally.  His father had shown him what could happen when a man was consumed by drink.  Though in his father’s case it was more of a man pouring drink on after being consumed by grief.  Despite what people said, drink had not killed his father.  It was the loss of his mother.  His mother had died 10 years before, shortly after Sam had been born.  A sickness in her lungs took her and she burned up with fever before the healers could even get to her.  His father had never recovered.  Eight years later Dean had to bury his father next to his mother.  After the funeral guests had left Dean had returned to the crypt and changed the date of his father’s death to the same date as his mother’s.
“This is amazing,” Dean said.  He tore his eyes away from the ring.  “It’s perfect.”
“My name is Missouri,” the woman said.  She held up her hand.  “This will go faster if we don’t waste time with pointless exchanges.”  She pointed at Dean.  “You are Sir Dean Winchester.  Son of John and Mary Winchester and a knight on quest.  And you are Castiel Novak.  Son of Charles and Naomi Novak and wizard along to assist with his quest.  I know who you are and where you are going.”  Missouri paused for a moment before continuing.  “As I said, my name is Missouri and I see things.  Sometimes it’s important, sometimes not.  What I’ve seen for you is important.”
“I don’t think I’ll marry the princess,” Dean said.
Castiel jumped in his seat.  He hadn’t heard the woman approach.  He hated being snuck up on.
“It should be straightforward to get there.  Another two days should see you out of the forest.  There is a village right near the forest’s edge, but it likely won’t have what you need.  I would suggest heading north for a week to Grovetop.  It’s much bigger and you’ll probably find what you need there.”
"Dean Winchester,” Naomi snapped.  “Everyone at this table is here because we love Jack.  We all are going to help you rescue him.  I will not stand by and leave my grandson in danger because you are casting aside willing aid.  We are all helping, let us help.”
His conversations with the birds an animals didn’t help as much as he would have hoped.  He made the mistake of trying to get some of the birds to tell him how big the forest was.  Then at least he’d have an idea of how long before the scenery changed.  It took several tires, but eventually they understood what he wanted and he was able to understand the answer.  The forest went on for as far as they could see.  Horizon to horizon full of green trees.  Broken here and there by rivers and large areas that he thought might be settlements of some kind.  Though it could just be natural rocky formations.  Birds were a little shaky on architecture.  Sparrows had the same word for both natural rocks and man-made buildings.
His decision meant that he had to ask Cas to not only pull his sword out of the manticore, but sheathe it for him as well.  Cas had picked up some of the larger pieces of armour that the manticore had torn off and tossed them into his saddlebag.  They would need a damn good blacksmith to put it back together.  If it was even possible.  Dean had his doubts.  His shield was useless, mangled almost beyond recognition.  The wizard hadn’t even asked if Dean wanted it and just stepped over it.  Missouri had been right about his shield though.  If he hadn’t been wearing it he would never have survived the initial attack, let alone lived lone enough to kill the manticore.
“I do Dean,” Cas said.  “I think I always have.”
“It’s very nice.  I bet he’ll love it.”
“Manticore venom was enough,” Rowena said.  “I’m not letting your brother dance through my skull willy-nilly.  Get the damn armour.  Or pick some up off the field, there were some pieces laying around the place when I was there last.  Just don’t come crawling back here begging to be patched up again.”
“Looking to restore glory would be my guess,” Charlie said with distain.  “Zachariah probably just had to suggest he’d restore the family.  It’s a strong motivator for the disgraced.”
Cas had gently laid Dean down and scooped up the knife the demon had dropped.  “I’m sorry Sam,” he had said.  “I can’t stay.  I have to go back to him.”
Dean leaves his forehead against Cas’s then, exhales and won’t dare open his eyes. “Cas.”
There’s talk of heading for New Orleans but something catches in Dean’s throat at the thought. (Something that has a Cajun accent and fangs and smells like seawater.) He claims that he doesn’t want to run in with any lingering ghosts and they turn their nose more properly east. Cas takes his hand without saying anything and Dean is grateful for the solid press of Cas’s palm against his own.
“Did you know that? That he loved you?”
Amanda, fresh off break-up number five of the year, all but melted. “Oh no, honey, not at all. They go completely under so your little sweetie won’t feel a thing.”
“It’s very strange,” Cas says intensely, as if working out the intricacies of an ancient spell. “Because pickle juice is not enjoyable on its own.”
“You more than deserve one,” comes Cas’s immediate encouragement. “And you’re allowed to say that, to feel that.” The rush of a sigh rustles through their connection. “I wish there were some way I could help.”
Picture quality isn’t great over these video calls but Sam is pretty sure a delicate blush falls over Cas’s cheeks.
“Relatively normal. Are you still planning to start that documentary tonight?”
Lauren had also been able to tell him the good news as soon as he arrived: They were as sure as they could be that Miracle had already been spayed. Dean’s whole had deflated with relief, even as she explained there was a chance they were wrong and so he should be on the lookout for a heat cycle and shouldn’t let her wander around outside.
When Cas emerges from the bathroom, clean and in fresh clothes, he finds Dean sitting at the foot of their bed, grinning at his phone. “Sam is at that diner just down the street so we can meet him if you’re up for some food, and coffee.”
“Yeah?” Dean asks and his chest is fizzing with the implication and he’s blushing from nose to ears and back again.
A part of him, that screaming, squalling part, wanted to do this at the cemetery. To know what it was like before kicking it. But something else folded up that impulse, told him it would be selfish, that Cas didn’t want it and if he did that was even worse, to kiss him, finally, and then go off and die.
When he trails out of the shower, Dean still feels unsettled in his own skin. He pulls on boxers and a tshirt without looking at Cas and then, when he does, he finds that Cas has dug through and claimed a tshirt of Dean’s for pajamas. He has the Bible from the side table drawer out, and is sitting on the edge of the bed, paging through it absently.
Dean exchanges “hello”s and smiles with Jody and then crouches a little, facing Claire. The little girl peers up at Dean with faint recognition and that universal toddler uncertainty.
Dean gets a grip and moves his hand. Every twitch and breath from Cas is a volume for him to study - Cas has always been quiet when they’re together. Any sound made, Dean takes it up greedily. Cas’s hips move to meet Dean’s hand and Dean encourages him forward. He fits his face into the notch beneath Cas’s jaw and mouths there hotly.
. And then Castiel turns around, shows Dean his back. Which makes Dean short out a little again because if he thought Castiel’s thighs were something, they were nothing compared to the curve of his ass. He blinks and half-wonders if that’s what Castiel wanted him to look at. Maybe this is Castiel coming on to Dean and he’s just, like, really bad at it.
“When I rebuilt you, Dean,” Cas says, with the attitude of a spouse who has already explained this, several times, and is annoyed that they're being asked about it again.
“Well, it’s just me and Claire,” Castiel is saying as Sam finally pulls his attention from the frankly terrifying dog that Meg is making kissy-faces at. They all more or less abandoned the pretense of getting into real clothes for these Zoom meetings days ago, but Castiel’s bedhead is truly a sight -- Sam thought it was bad in the office, but Castiel’s home look is something else.
The next morning, Dean makes hangover-breakfast sandwiches and coffee for all and pretends not to notice when Claire and Jack high-five across the table. Cas stands behind him at the stove the whole time, pressed into his back and muttering about the evils of whiskey.
Before he can get to it, Castiel puts the Bible aside and lays his hand to Dean’s shoulder. It takes a few seconds. Dean can feel, sixth sense, the lingering shadow of Cas’s hand above him, the pause, and then the determination, the press of his uninjured palm cupping the joint.
Dean glares for only a half-second before nodding and taking the offered hand.
It’s late when Dean calls Cas but he doesn’t work the next day and there was too much to Joe Exotic to fit in a text message. The phone call starts as just that, Dean sprawling out about the bizzaro world that is apparently private exotic animal zoos and Cas listens attentively. He promises to watch the first two episodes to catch up with Dean, though he doesn’t sound pleased at the prospect of watching animals in mistreatment.
Dean blinks a minute and raises a hand to the back of his head, feeling off-balance. “I - Yes? Your hand isn’t broken, buddy, I -”
Or, not so bad after all, because honestly it might work.
“I forgot about your eyelashes,” Cas says.
Sam is looking at him like maybe he’s insane. Dean expected him to just know about bees and their seasonal habits or whatever, like he always seems to just know things. Either way, Dean is pretty sure that bees aren’t supposed to be around in the winter.
Since blowing out the big bad, a lot of their cases are clean-ups -- lingering ghosts and ghouls or ancient things that have been walking the Earth since long before there were ever Winchesters or Campbells. There’s the rakshaka in Montana, wendigo in Minnesota and North Dakota, a slew of ghosts along the east coast and across Texas. At all their stopovers: bees. Through the snowy afternoons in the midwest and the dawning spring in the South, bees. They’re not dicks about it; they’re not, like, bees. For all that they seem to be following him or something, he doesn’t get stung once. They never dart or dive at him, just hum in close, to the crown of his head.
Dean asks how Claire is doing and suggests activities to keep her occupied. Cas asks if Dean is getting enough sleep and how the dinner adventures (he and Sammy are starting to get real creative with their food) are going. They both start watching some stupid reality show on Netflix and text theories and commentary back and forth.
A moment later, or maybe it’s an hour, or maybe it’s a second, Sam is at his side and holding onto his shoulders. “Dean, c’mon,” he’s saying. His words are waterlogged. “Please, Dean…”
Cas kisses him again, a soft impress.
Sam watches as Dean realizes it in degrees. He straightens his shoulders back and wipes a hand down his face. He looks to Jack and, so tenderly, reaches out to clear away his tears too. And then, Sam watches as his brother smiles. “Hell yes, we’re gonna get him back.” Dean watches Jack until the kid tries for a smile and then he turns to Sam and he sees there’s a smile already there.
“Some part of you must have,” Chuck is saying but he’s mostly white noise to Dean. Everything else is white noise, except Cas. “He wasn’t exactly subtle about it, was he?”
If Cas is surprised to hear from him this early, he doesn’t say so. Dean doesn’t want to talk, not right away, and so instead he asks and asks. Prompts Cas. Listens as Cas recounts a dream that Claire had and about the book they read that morning. Cas talks about the work he has to get done and the decrease in donations their foundation has gotten lately. Cas talks about the fourth episode of Tiger King that they had watched the other night, using some app that synced their Netflix screens so they could watch together, texting reactions throughout. Cas talks about the research-hole he had fallen down, about exotic animal legislation and then Oklahoma itself. He talks about his brother, Gabriel, offering to do grocery shopping for him and then he thanks Dean, again, profusely, for the emergency diaper-and-chalk delivery.
A stretch of silence lingers. Dean swallows, tries to focus on getting them across the parking lot to their motel. Cas's eyes are still on him, muddled from all that whiskey but still a searing blue (Dean had half-thought that the pigment would fade out when Cas dropped to full human, with no grace behind it. But no, it turned out that really was just the color of his eyes.)
“Gonna be the next Ansel Adams?” Dean asks once he’s close enough.
Dean can feel the press of Cas’s hand as he tries to push him away, out of the way, because there’s a teeming wall of void that’s opened behind them but Dean holds his ground.
“I’ll bet you have,” Dean says. He wiggles away a little, sitting up further and reaching across the bed, across Cas. Back in focus, Dean holds a glass of water in front of Cas who is suddenly parched.
But the thing is, after almost an hour of listening to Cas, to letting his warm, rich voice wash over him, he does want to talk.
Cas turns and gives him a smile and Dean returns it, as easy as breathing. The angel is still learning
Sam and Cas really do have to get together to get things finalized on their grant. It’s just that they probably could have gotten everything done with just the chat feature on the google doc. They didn’t strictly need to be on a video chat as they hashed things out, but Sam could hear Dean just waking up and he is a Good Little Brother so he makes some excuse about human connection and it being easier to talk things out. Cas obliges without much fuss, luckily. A minute later and Sam has half his screen taken up by the document, the other half full of Castiel’s focused expression. In the background, Sam can hear the cheery music of some television show.
Dean pulls his opposite arm across Cas’s shoulders, hooks him in tight and close, knocks their heads together as he locks his forehead against Cas’s. He won’t look away, he’ll do that for Cas, he won’t look away. His eyes are boring into Cas and for a moment they don’t say anything, just breathe. Dean can see an inky black swirl along Cas’s temples.
Claire immediately lights up and reaches for the gift, shaking it gleefully. “Bubbles!” she shouts, giggling. “Thank you!” And then she’s dancing around Jody’s feet, asking if they can play with the bubbles before bedtime, please, please, Aunt Jody, please.
. As a human, Cas has found that he liked having facial hair. His hand trails up from his jaw to the bridge of his nose, the cartilage there.
Dean has an angry retort half-way out of his mouth before he thinks better of it. He breathes deep, twice, and then scrubs at his face. “Sorry,” he mutters. “Overheard one of those...fucking press conferences and I just…” He can’t put into words the anger that’s been roiling at the pit of his stomach. The fear that slops under it, like a living thing, and the need to
And finally, Cas asks, “Did you wanna talk about what’s wrong, or not?” His tone is gentle, earnest. He’s genuine asking and Dean has the feeling that if he said that he didn’t, that would be the end of it.
“Oh, I am,” Dean says. Against the nape of his neck he can feel the curve of Cas’s smile.
“Thank you, for the suggestion,” Cas says, once it’s just the two of them. “She especially liked going on the hunt for the pine cone this morning. Apparently we were also looking for buried treasure.”
And yeah, Sammy and Eileen and Jack will all always be welcome in that home, of course. But Jack has been talking about striking out on his own a little. And he and Sam have lived in each other’s pockets for going on 15 years now so maybe it’s time for some distance. Not too much, but well. Sam and Eileen are really making a go of it.
as the power chord running under their mission…
“Of course,” Cas responds placidly. In the background there’s a call of “Daddy!” and he gives Dean a wry smile. “I suppose that’s my cue to go.”
He’s right there. He’s right there and Dean can finally see him, can finally touch him, and Cas is turning away. That thought has him breaking, has him surging forward and pushing Cas, slamming his back up against the motel wall with heavy hands. Cas gives a gasp of surprise at the movement, a little grunt at the impact, but he doesn’t pull away.
Similarly, when God wants your attention, you’re a little powerless.
“Oh my god,” Claire drawled. “It is one shot of Jim Beam. Calm down, old man.” Jack giggles at either Claire’s insult or the affronted look that shutters over Dean’s face from it.
“Okay, well, Philadelphia sucks,” Claire comments. “But if we were doing tequila and Tecate it’d be a Desperado.” They all have their shots in hand and their beers opened at the ready. Claire lifts her shot over the low-slung table and grins. “Here’s to…” Her eyes sweep from Cas to Jack, “Here’s to family.”
“Usually, yeah. Didn’t know he had a single father till, like, six months in.” All right, maybe that was a little too pointed, but Sam knew his brother, repression and all, too well.
Their house, eventually, is a mess of decoration. There’s posters and pins and postcards, some framed and mint condition, some yellowed and salvaged from thrift-store bins. There are medallions and trinkets that double as protection and warding. There are, after a few years, drawings and paintings from Eileen and Sam’s little girl. A calendar and a whiteboard. Wildflowers that wilt against thumbtacks that Cas couldn’t resist.
He can remember a roadside fast-food shack. A last ditch prayer with desolation crowding in on his chest. He can remember, forever, the silence in answer.
“Do you wanna watch old Jeopardy episodes and pick some losers?” Sam asks, trying another one of Dean’s tried and true mood elevators. That had been the move when they were little. Sammy was an anxious kid and watching Jeopardy made him nervous. Until Dean taught him to pick for a contestant he wanted to lose and root for that to happen.
“You can take me home.”
“Your brother’s nose is crooked,” Cas says with the same gravity as reciting biblical goddamn prophecies.
The movie Sam chose is Jurassic Park but it definitely doesn’t matter. He and Claire are playing a drinking game (drink every time a dinosaur is named, every time Dr. Sattler is sassy, every time you’re inexplicably attracted to Jeff Goldblum) but no one else is paying attention. Certainly not Dean, because about five minutes in, Cas canted a little to the side and leaned full into Dean’s arm. So, yeah, Dean kind of stopped paying attention to the movie, or the drinking game, or anything else happening in the room.
[screams like Misha in the season 14 bloopers when they finally finish the take]
“You should tell him that, Cas,” Sam says and Dean can’t see it but he knows Sam’s smile is eating shit.
“You don’t know that!” Dean’s voice is a little raised as he counters but it’s not the first emotional exchange we’ve had in that front office.
The trees are still in full green but the weather is turning its thoughts toward fall. “We’re gonna need a blanket at the next stop,” Dean mumbles into Cas’s neck.
Plus, they've been back on the Human Lessons kick. So far, Cas has only had beer and never more than two at a time.
hope you enjoyed these dumb, dumb idiots as much as i did writing them. hope, even more, that you and all of yours are safe in these times. as always, please let me know what you thought!
The sigh that Castiel releases is less like pleasure and more like relief. Dean feels cracked open at it, like he’s the one being breached, like he was the one that douchewheel angel had monologued at.
They went into an exam room. Mary slipped out maybe twenty minutes later and relayed to us that the dog wasn’t chipped or registered in any way that we could detect, so it looked like we had another regular client on our hands.
“Shut
Dean shudders through inhales, is shaking, has his head pitched down so that that tip of his nose is along the bridge of Cas’s.
Instead of responding to that (because, really, what is he supposed to respond to that) Dean says, “Come home with me, please.”
“I’m not above bribery,” Dean quips. His smile is soft, matching Cas’s. It takes him a minute to realize that they’re just doing that -- just standing there, smiling at each other and, okay, maybe a portion of that Facetime call that Sam mentioned earlier was spent similarly. Just Dean looking into the screen of his phone and Cas looking back and, like then, this doesn’t feel weird or awkward or off-balance. There’s a certain tension to it, but it’s a tension loaded with promise and interest and something hopeful, eager, slips through Dean's chest. Maybe, too, it wouldn't take a false-start for them to get to being themselves. Maybe it would just be as easy as this.
(See the end of the chapter for
There isn’t a lot of excitement working at Smith Center Veterinary. It’s a small practice in a small town made up, largely, of couples who are on the brink of retirement. Most of our clients are sweet little old ladies with cats, housewives with birds, and the odd millennial who never moved away from their parents’ hometown with a rescue dog.
He thought it, maybe. Had considered it, some dark nights. He thought it as he watched Cas walk back into a Gas ‘N’ Sip in Idaho and he thought it as he watched the angel back from the dead next to a payphone and he thought it as Cas showed him the truth of Purgatory and he thought it as he said, lost, “For what it’s worth, I would give anything not to have you do this.” He thought it and rejected it and thought it and rationalized why it couldn’t be.
He does that, twice, and then showers and takes an extra long moment under the spray. The vacuum pound of the water around him makes the ache in his head abate a little. A hand to his jaw explores what Dean once called
Behind him, Sam whistles low. “Guess there’s a reason it’s the Garden State after all.”
next chapter: the boys get drunk again!
“I like all your sides,” Cas says, eyes fixed on the haze of the Polaroid, still developing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Gotta add Cas here as her owner, too.” He pulls Cas over with an arm around his shoulder.
“You’re welcome.”
Dean huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. The bee dislodges, twirls, alights on his nose. Dean laughs again, keeps laughing. Bends at the waist and throws an arm out against his car to hold himself steady because he can’t stop laughing, he can’t stop seeing Cas’s face, that easy smile, the serenity, when he talked about watching the bees.
. If this were weeks ago, Dean would have definitely asked Cas out by now but he’s not exactly sure how that works with...everything.
“No. I mean. Isn’t it better, always, when there’s a clean break? When the bone is fully separated? Completely and utterly in two?”
He gets Cas over to the patch of grass overgrown with weeds next to their motel and he does, indeed, vomit. It’s a short affair, though, not too bad. It can’t be fun for Cas, but Dean gets to run his hand along the former angel’s spine and shoulders, let his fingers dip over the nape of his neck as he murmurs, “All right, buddy. There ya go. You’re all right.”
Softly, after a moment, Cas comments, “You’re in a good mood.”
Rowena is talking about frontline workers, lines that have become standard if no less heartfelt over the past month and a half, but Sam watches as Dean’s attention drifts. He sees two pairs of big blue eyes riveted on Dean, it seems, and then sees Dean cross his eyes and blow out his cheeks. Rowena’s words are cut off by a screeching laugh from Claire, her hands clapping excitedly. Sam can’t help but smile and shake his head. But he doesn’t miss the grin that passes over Castiel’s face.
“Right” Cas said.  “I’m going to go get on my horse now.”
Nothing in the studio seemed weird.  No hex-bags.  Nothing remotely occult.  No obviously cursed items.  Sam shrugged at Dean as they stepped out of the garage.
Cas and Jack were safe.
“I can’t speak for fairies, but humans can get stuck in shapeshifted forms.  Part of the spell keeps the mind intact, but over time it wears off.  It’s possible for people forget they’re human entirely and become the animal permanently.”
“I could have killed Gilda,” Dean corrected.  “You didn’t stab her in the face.”
“Maybe we should just go,” Dean said.  “You have people to see.”
“Look,” Dean told the man who had just tapped him on the shoulder.  “I don’t know you and I don’t owe you any explanation.  Leave me alone.”
“You don’t have to though,” Dean said.  “You don’t have to do this.”
Rufus came huffing up shortly after Cas had flown away.  “Birds are acting weird.”
“Simon was my friend.  Great guy.  Bit nutty about his music, but he was an artist.” He smiled wistfully.  “I think all artists have to be a bit nutty.  Damn, I’m going to miss that man.”
Cas lay just as still as he had been when Dean left.  Luke had removed all Cas’ clothes and piled them in a corner.  The witch had washed the blood from him.  Dean could see the basin of water on the counter.  Without all the blood the injuries were starting to show.  His entire body was covered with lacerations, some of them looked deep.  Dark purple and greenish bruises were starting to colour the skin.  His right shoulder didn’t seem to sit properly.
Dean’s concern made Cas feel warm and even more safe than he had before.  “I’m tired, but I think I’m fine otherwise.”
“STOP!”
“I think there are some witch killing bullets in the Impala.  I’ll check on those and make more if we need them.”  Sam stood and closed his laptop.  “See if you can find a carrying case for a cursed object.”
Castiel took his seat and waited for take off.  He enjoyed traveling and especially enjoyed flying.  It was one of the major reasons he worked for the company he did.  There was a lot of business trips to take and he got to spend time all over the world.  Most of his coworkers hated it, but he never turned down a chance to travel.

Rufus pulled up short near a rock formation Dean had always called The Hands when he was younger.  It had towered over him when he was a boy, still did, stretching nearly twenty feet above ground.  It vaguely looked like two giant hands pressed together, sort of like the earth was praying.  A large crack separated the two hands near the ground.  Over the centuries rain and the cold had stretched the crack into an opening.  Dean had discovered that the opening lead down to a small cave It was tall enough for a grown man to almost stand, as long as he hunched.  Dean remembered having all sorts of adventures inside while his father went hunting.  His father had insisted on checking it every spring before letting him play there to make sure no animal had decided to use it as a den.  It had always been empty.  It wasn’t empty now.
Once he was sure the dragon wouldn’t immediately fill the room he was in with fire, Castiel dropped dismissed the barrier spell.  He popped his head out quickly to see what was going on.
“What can we do about it?”  Castiel was surprised at his voice and how calm it was.  He was screaming inside, but his voice was steady.
Dean leaned in and kissed Castiel.  “I’d rather have weird son that’s ours than a normal one any day.  At least he was polite.”
*****
Lilith smiled.  “Hello Jack.”  She shivered and pulled the blanket closer around her.
The breeze picked up and Dean started to shiver.  He broke the kiss but didn’t pull away.  He rested his forehead against Cas’.  They stayed like that until another gust of wind blew past them.  He planted a quick kiss on Cas’ lips and pulled back.   “We should get dry and warm.”  As cold as he was, Dean knew that Cas must be even colder.  He had been underwater far longer than he had been.
“My what?”
“What?  Oh,” Sam sat up.  “I didn’t need to know that Dean.”
******
She sighed deeply.  “Father wants me to marry.  He has for some time now.  He keeps bring these just awful knights.”  She looked at Dean.  “Sorry, no offense.”
By the time the four of them reached the castle the front few groups had already engaged the force coming through the ruined castle wall.  Now that he was closer he could see that some of them did appear to be a personal guard.  Some of them looked like household servants though.  All of them had murky purple eyes and the colour had run like water down their faces.  All of the screamed and howled as they attacked with whatever was at hand, even if it was their bare fists.  This wasn’t combat, it was slaughter.
It wasn’t for the faint of heart.
Dean laughed and watched Cas crouch down by the firepit.  He whispered something into his clasped hands.  A moment later Cas opened his hands and breathed along the cupped palms.  Little motes of red light blew off and settled onto the wood.  Wherever they landed little tongues of flames shot up.  He moved a few steps around to the side and repeated the process.  In short order they had a warm fire crackling away.
“Are you up to traveling today?”  Dean asked.  “We can wait another day if you need it.”
As the newest ranger it was Castiel’s job to scout the area for any damage that Bernice had caused.  They had her chipped and could sort of track her movements, the equipment was old and only gave a vague idea of where the bear was.  He knew she’d moved back to her territory with whatever spoils she’d stolen.
“Not your fight Dean,” Michael told him.  Another bolt of lightning drew the creature’s full attention.  “Get Jack.  We’ll deal with the ogres.”
The world didn’t fade back in like it had faded away.  Instead Dean blinked and he was standing where he had before what ever just happened had occurred.  The man was still standing in front of him and he looked smug.
“Nidaviller?  It’s one of the nine realms from Norse lore.”  Sam had slipped into lecture mode.  “He’s a long way from home.  Anything that could make a door to another realm of existence is probably going to have some bad effects on humans.  Where did he put his key?”
“Can you climb down?”  Castiel asked.  It would be easier if he didn’t need to go get a ladder.  It would be a pain to lug it back from the truck.
“I look good in everything.”
“They drink a lot down there,” Garth laughed shakily.  “Tell each other all sorts of tales and get themselves worked up.”
“It’s alright Cas,” Dean said.  “You can just say it.”
“My father was very sick.  Raphael did everything he could, but my father’s body was falling apart around him.  I loved my father dearly and it was torture to see him wasting like that.  While Raphael tried to holding him together I went looking for another solution.  I summoned every demon I could call up and demanded a cure for my father.  None had it.  So I bargained and pleaded and begged.  I bought the names of other demons and summoned them.  Still no cure.  In the end there wasn’t one to be found.  My father died.  I wasn’t there with him like I should have been.  My family has forgiven me for my absence, but Castiel never has.  In one fell swoop I lost both my father and brother.  It tried to help, but failed.”  He gestured out at the field.  “This can be my redemption.”
“I love you.”
“She’s in that side room with the huge fireplace,” Sam said.
“It’s the middle of the summer Raphael.”
*****
“MY BABIES!!!”  The woman stood clumsily, but with alarming speed.  She pulled a stick from her rags.  Its tip was already glowing with a sickly yellow light.  “YOU HURT
“That makes sense, you must miss your brother.”  Castiel nodded his head toward the noise of the party.  “I could do with a bit longer of a break from mine I think.”
“Absolutely.  He might not have figured it out yet, but he does.”
“What is going on?  Who are you?  Where am I?  Where is Cas?”
“I just wanted to make myself clear,” Lucifer said smoothly.  “Regardless of how he feels about me, I love my brother and will do anything to keep him from harm.”
Dean watched him go with some amusement.  The wizard looked excited, but he couldn’t figure out why that would be the case.  He wondered what Cas had been up to.  Fortunately he didn’t have to wait long to find out.  About ten minutes later Cas came running back up the path carrying something wrapped in a blanket.  Dean recognized it as the blanket Cas used while on the road.
“None taken,” Dean said easily.  “Some of us can be bastards.”
“This is unusual,” the king said.
“Carrying a shield isn’t that big of a deal for me,” Dean raised his left arm to show the heavy leather stretched over a wooden frame.  He’d also donned his armour after they left Missouri’s wagon.
The room was oddly designed, it was a square, but had three entrances, four if you considered the one out to a balcony.  It had probably been intended for large gatherings and meals, which would explain why there were so many ways to enter or exit.  It was not a good place for an ambush, too may ways to get out, but that seemed to be the intent.  Dean found himself impressed with the commander of the thirty soldiers at the other end of the room.  There were a few of Bender’s men mixed in there, their eyes and faces stained purple, but most of them seemed to be faeries.  Their teeth were too white and their eyes too blue.
“We paid her so she would heal me,” Gilda said gently.  “I’m as recovered as I’m going to get in the short run.  It’ll take months to fully recover.  That’s not fair to her, and I don’t want to stay that long.”
“Oh just sit down.”  She tucked the bag back onto her belt.  “No theatrics.  You’ll get some info, and some of it will be vague enough to make sure you do what you need to do.  Okay?”
“I prefer you in nothing,”
Cas’ grumpiness on waking in the morning was among the first things Dean learned about the wizard.  He quickly learned to avoid conversation until Cas was awake.  At best it questions would be answered in monosyllabic responses or grunts.  At worst it was met with surly comments.  Once he was awake, the wizard was pleasant, but until that point it was best to just let him be.
“Yeah, but I accepted.  I wonder if Rowena accepts quests in lieu of payment.  I don’t exactly have a lot of coin to give her.”
“There’s a building over there with an intact roof.”  Cas pointed it out at the back of the clearing nestled among the trees.  They headed in that direction.
Gabriel smiled and let his nephew lead him and Jessica into the drawing room.  “What story?”
The Queen took it from its spot and held it up.  The fading evening light glinted off the metal knight.  She slowly turned it over in her hand and stared at it for a long time.
The word ‘trollop’ might have been muttered from the head table.
“Can you understand what it’s saying?” Dean asked. “Or can you just understand birds.”
“Drop the princess bit,” Charlene said.  “Call me Charlie.  At least where my father can’t hear.  Or my nurse, she’ll skin you alive for it.”
“Don’t you worry your pretty head about that,” she told him.  “Raphael can be a right bastard, but he is an amazing healer.  Has the hands of an angel he does.  And the personality of a festering sheep.”
“Then you may take your dying fairy elsewhere.  I’ll deal with the Court when they show up on my doorstep.  And I will be forth coming when explaining what happened here.  They’ll find you wee girl.  And they will not be nice.”
“I don’t know what that does,” he said.  “But maybe we should leave it alone.”
“No, the fields,” Castiel explained.  “I want you to cleanse the fields.”
“I’ll come with you,” Cas said.  “I need to wake the horses up.”
Jessica had been stabbed several times.  It looked like her body had just been tossed to the ground with no real intent to hide anything.  There was no sign of Jack.  Dean began looking around the garden.  And down toward the orchard.  Jack wasn’t down there either.
And then Cas was gone.  Sam hadn’t heard from him since that moment.  He’d lost his brother and his friend in the same instant.
He tilted his head for a moment.
“Okay,” Castiel said warily.  “I’m glad you could help him.”
It took him a moment to locate the source.
Jack burst into tears.  “I’m sorry Poppa.  Don’t hate me.”
******
Michael and Dean provided most of the details with the rest of the table chiming in now and again.  Castiel didn’t say much.  Every time he looked back Lilith was still staring at him.  Not glaring exactly, but it was an uncomfortable gaze.
“Yeah, well you’ve been away from home long enough,” Dean said.  “Thought you might want to sleep in your own bed.  Besides, I owe you for throwing a rock at you.”
“If you’re sure,” Dean said.
“Did you want to follow the road north to Grovetop?”  Castiel asked.
Uncle Raphael moved silent to the bedside and looked over both his fathers.  He nodded to himself and then smiled at Jack. He held up his finger for silence again and walked back to the door.
He paused for a moment to let the crowd chuckle.  If one group could appreciate the oddity of his ‘normal’ it was these people.
His mind was starting to wonder and Dean looked like he was fading fast.  Charlene seemed lost in her own thoughts, but didn’t look like she was about to fall asleep at the table.  Shaking his head, he pushed himself up.  Dean gave him a questioning look.
Neither of them said anything.  Castiel thought it was best to let the queen do most of the talking.
“This won’t be a habit,” Cas said without turning around.  “But I thought you’d want an early start today.”
“Torment?  To fight at my king’s command?”  The spirit laughed.  “To fight so I may return to my beloved?  This is not torment.”
“What changed?” Lucifer parroted.  “I believe that would be you.”
Castiel was about to turn back to the trail when he heard a call for help.
Later that afternoon he gave Dean back his cloak.  The rain had stopped hours before and he couldn’t justify keeping it to himself anymore.
The only reason Dean wasn’t the first one to clamber over the rubble into the castle was that Sam got there first.  It wasn’t difficult for him to walk over the remains of the door, but he held onto Dean’s arm for support anyway.  He wasn’t going to turn down a chance to touch his husband.  Even if the reason for it was that he had ripped out part of a wall to open a door.
Part of him had expected to be attacked immediately, and he wasn’t entirely disappointed.  There wasn’t anyone in the front hall, but he heard the screaming as soon as they rounded the first corner.  There was no real thought to the attack, certainly no attempt at subtlety.  A group of men and women ran right at them.  The were dressed like household servants.  The leader, or really just the person at the front of the charge, was a matronly woman with grey hair pulled back into a bun.  Her eyes were the same murky purple as the people outside and her cheeks were stained the same colour.
Just a single voice.  It sounded like an owl.  But it was joined by another just like it and then another.  Soon a chorus of voices rang through the forest.  Not just the owls but other nighttime creatures had begun the call.
“Don’t know.  I’ll deal with this.”
“I can almost hear my love calling for me.”  The spirit looked toward the spot where he had died.  “I can feel my bones there.  Take up my armour Sir Winchester.  Take it to replace your own.  The smith said it would keep any blade from my skin, and I guess she was right.  Didn’t do anything against a club to the head though.”
He was started awake a little while later when his shoulder was smacked.
Castiel kissed Dean and helped him tie the straps of the gown.  “Maybe.  Bleached out green has always been your colour.”
“Leave first one,” the voice said.  “You are free, only the second must stay.”
“That doesn’t change that I am responsible.”  She touched the bandages around her arm.  “This is my doing, not yours.”
**********
Gabriel smirked and downed one of the glasses he was holding.  He swapped the empty glass with one of the ones Sam was holding.  “I needed some help carrying everything.  Sam is being very helpful.  Such a good brother inlaw.  Or brother of my brother inlaw.  Anyway, he’s being helpful.”
A commotion near the bar caught Sam’s attention.  The bartender was missing and the waiter that had served them their drinks was yelling for someone to call an ambulance.
“It would have gotten you some tutors for Sam though.”
Castiel frowned.  He adjusted the cloth of the sling that one of Raphael’s apprentices had made for him.  His shoulder throbbed a bit, he had been warned it would.  He had been warned by several people.  And then lectured at length about being careful by his brother’s chief apprentice while Raphael stood near by.  Once the apprentice had left, Raphael repeated the lecture.  If Castiel was not careful he would never regain full use of his shoulder again.  To be honest, Castiel didn’t care if he never moved his shoulder again, Jack was safe.
“She might if you take that shiny knight of yours with you.”
Castiel laughed shakily.  “Yeah you did.”  He kissed Dean’s forehead and than lips.  Dean’s breath was awful.  Way worse than any morning breath.
Cas reached the doorway ahead of him like he’d planned.  He slid from his horse and grabbed the reins to lead the animal inside the darkened structure.  Hopefully there wasn’t anything waiting for him.  Dean slid from his own saddle.  He almost lost his footing as the ground shook from a massive impact.  The dragon had landed on the plateau..  He tapped Baby’s flank and the horse moved forward and stepped inside the structure.  Dean pulled his sword and turned to face the dragon.
“I should go now,” Lucifer said.  “Dean will take good care of you.  Right Dean?”  Castiel heard a tone shift in his brother’s voice and caught the look he gave Dean, but didn’t understand it.
“Payment?”  Dean demanded.  “I thought you helped your brother because he needed it.”
several of his arteries in his brain have become blocked.  Any brain tissue fed by those vessels have begun to die.”
DEAN: It just looks perfect. Wish you could see it.
“Anyway.  This is for you.”  He thrust the bundle at Dean.
Year 1
Jack burbled happily and let go of the ceiling.  Both his fathers lunged toward him.  Dean caught his legs while Castiel managed to get his hands under Jack’s head before the baby hit the floor.  All three of them ended in a heap on the floor, but other than Castiel’s banged knee, no one was hurt.
“Do you have a string?  I don’t want him to lose it.”
“I think I do,” Cas said quietly.
“Why just you?”
“Say you’ll never come back here.”  He pulled on the leather again.  “Swear it.”
“Fine,” the man grumbled as Dean gave him half the coins.  “You can send whoever you want with the horses, but I suggest your unarmoured friend go first.  You look heavier in all that metal.”
The dragon was writhing around the plateau.  Dean had moved part way up the staircase he’d been standing next too.  He was safely out of the dragon’s way for the moment, but once it got itself under control again he’d be in trouble.
Dean huffed and swatted his husband’s hand.  “Maybe I’ll get one for when I go home.  Could spice things up for us.”
“I want to go for a walk.”
“I don’t care what’s in the way, I’m going after him.”
“More so I think.”
“Maybe, but they’re too caught up in their own things to worry about the living,” Rowena said.  “I’ve crossed the field a few times when I had to.  It’s unpleasant, but not really dangerous.  Frightening though.  Most the stories about the place are ghost stories that the ignorant made up to scare each other.”
Even through the dirt Dean could see that a running horse had been etched into the metal.  The detail was impressive and he looked forward to seeing it all shined up.  It would take time, but he knew it would be worth it.  The armour was definitely enchanted, it would have been a pile of rust by now otherwise.  He had no idea what enchantments were laid on the armour, but he hoped Cas could help him with that.  Assuming that Cas was willing to talk to him.
Helen politely spat the small taste of pie she’d taken into a napkin.  “You have a talent dear, we all do.  Yours may not be pie making.”
“I’m okay, Dean,” Castiel assured him.  “Just a little tired still.”
“I’ve never seen one.”
“This would have happened eventually brother,” Lucifer said gently.  “It doesn’t mean what you’ve feared.  I walk my path because I want to, not because I was forced.  Find your own way and do what you will.”
Sam waved an arm toward the head table.  “Dude, you didn’t even lecture him afterward.  You just showered and went to bed.  I would have had to suffer through a powerpoint presentation if I’d been driving.  But Cas?  Not even a word.  Anyway, that’s when I knew something was up.”
There was a clap of thunder and a moment later Michael came into the den.  The doors swung shut the moment he was through.
A moment later he heard the clicking of his mother’s staff and the lower murmur of conversation.  The conversation grew louder and Naomi entered the room.  She was accompanied by Lucifer and Lilith.
Cas and Raphael had gotten him back into bed.  Or Cas and Rowena had, he tried not to think about it too much.
“Well, I met her mother a few years back,” Gabe explained while pointedly looking at his nails.  “And reconnected with her daughter a little while ago.  She was the one who told me about the whole suitor thing.  Suggested that if the princess had an advisor that her father might back off a bit and let this whole marriage thing sort itself out.”
Dean didn’t even see the blow coming.  The other Dean backhanded him hard enough that the chair rolled several feet.  Dean blinked his vision clear of the tears of surprise.
Lucifer chuckled.  “I already had that chat with him.  Though I think our brothers are doing their own version right now.”  He drank some of his wine before continuing.  “But no, I don’t think I really need to.  Probably didn’t when I first spoke to him.  I don’t believe he’ll hurt you Castiel.  Not because of any threats from your family.  At trust me, we could be very creative if we wanted to.  No.  I think that Dean won’t hurt you because you are you.  He’d sooner cut his own arm off I think.  Which is for the best.  I think one of us would remove it for him if he didn’t.”
It was on the second day that the attack came.  The tedium of the terrain had lulled him into a half doze.  The shouting of men and thundering charge of horses snapped him out of his doze.  He saw a dozen fully armoured men bearing down on him and Dean.  His horse reared in confusion and terror.  Castiel was almost thrown, but managed to cling to the saddle as his horse turned to charge back the way they’d come.  He was met by the sight of another group of armed men charging toward them.  His eyes widened as the tip of a lance speared him in the chest.  The knight holding it didn’t stop and the lance sunk down to the hand guard.  The horse and rider passed through him and his horse without pause.   He managed to look over his shoulder in time to see the second group of me clash with the first.  The sky darkened and he heard the whistling of arrows begin to fall around him.
Cas’ blush deepened to more of a scarlet colour.  “Yes,” he finally said.  “Raphael noticed the books and eventually I was found out.  I’m not sure what was worse.  Mother’s lecture about theft and how I should have just gone to her about these questions, Raphael’s lecture about human anatomy or my aunt Amara’s laughter.  For the next few years my aunt and Gabe gave me anatomy books as gifts.  My aunt’s were always on how to draw the naked form.  Gabe’s were just naked pictures.”
Of course, it made sense.  The kiss hadn’t been because Cas had been happy to see him, it had been to cast a spell.  Dean wasn’t sure if he could breath under water,
“It’s just as trippy from my end,” the other Dean assured him.
“I don’t know what to say for this.  I want to take part.  To make this a great night.  But I don’t have my own story.  As long as I’ve been alive they’ve always been together.”
There was an army of skeletons swarming over the remains of the bogarts.  He could only assume that this was Lilith’s handiwork.  It had been effective, but he couldn’t supress a shudder.  This was why people feared necromancers.  How did anyone stand up to an army of the dead?  He looked across the valley to the large fog bank that was slowly dissipating.  He could see Lilith on a horse.  Her head was tossed back and the deep vibrating note that carried over the battlefield seemed to be coming from her.  As he watched, Lilith swayed in the saddle.  The note wavered and stopped.  Lilith slumped forward on to the horse and slid to the ground.
“He’s surrounded by a wall brother,” Gabriel said.  “Where is he going to run to.”
“If you wish to yield,” the other knight said, “I will not hold it against you.  You have fought well this day.”
The tip of the blade sinking into the eye had several effects.  The fire stopped immediately.  It was replaced with a deafening roar of pain.  The dragon flailed its limbs and Dean was knocked backward again.  He managed to maintain his footing, but had to take several quick steps up the carved stairs to avoid falling down.  The enchantment on the blade seemed to hold because he hadn’t dropped it.
The look was quick, Castiel barely saw it.  The colour drained slightly from Lucifer’s face and his eyes widened.  It was gone almost immediately, but for that instant Castiel thought he couldn’t have looked more surprised if he had been slapped.
Dean was there.  The knight pushed him backward with his right hand and held up the shield to block the attack.  Castiel stumbled backward, but managed to keep his feet.
The girl ran straight up to them and Dean had to lean down to catch her before she ran into Baby.  “Calm down,” Dean told her.  “What’s wrong.”
Keeping the blanket pinched around his waist, Dean walked over to the firepit to claim his clothes.  They had dried over night and smelt a little of campfire smoke and river water.  But not too badly.  He dressed himself quickly.  He folded Cas’ blanket put it in his pack next to his spare set of clean clothes.  He was sure the wizard wouldn’t want it back as soon as he woke up.
While Gilda snickered, Charlie openly scoffed.  “It’s a wedding.  Haven’t you boys ever seen one before?”
“It’s pretty enough and you’ll probably have a few bruises there too,” she told him.  “The ringing will stop and you’ll be able to walk after that.  For now, lay down here and I’ll get you some tea.”
“Who is he?”  Dean asked.  “Rowena mentioned him, but I think there’s magic involved and I don’t understand it at all.”
Dean nodded at him and pushed Baby into a walk.  He heard Cas follow him.
“Oh, right,”  Castiel dropped his backpack to his feet and pulled out a thermos.  “I made you some soup.”
Castiel felt himself blushing.  And shivered.  “We should probably build a fire and get dry.  I don’t want you catching cold so soon after being ill.”
“what about my head?”
The creature stood out of its crouch.  It towered over Dean, easily twice his height.  He was right about it having a horses head, but it also had hooves where he’d have expected feet.  The rest of the body was close enough to human to count, though it seemed sexless.  He cursed under his breath.  They’d stumbled across a kelpie.
“The fact he came here at all is nonsense,” Castiel grumbled.  “I’ll talk with my aunt as well, she might be willing to offer her help.”
*****
Dean laughed quietly.  “Not really.  I’ve fought before Cas.  I’ve seen men die.  But this?”  He gestured out at the field.  “These would have been my brothers dying.  It’s a lot to watch.  And they’re trapped.”  He took a shaky breath.  “It’s one thing to die for a cause.  For your brothers.  For whatever.  It’s another to die over and over
“These things happen,” Dean explained.  “As long as a request doesn’t interfere with my quest I can offer my help.  Sometimes it helps later on.  My tutors told me a few stories where people helped along the way offer assistance when the knight needs it most.  Besides, he obviously needs some help.”
“He’s a witch Dean.  Be careful.”
“I was in the back,” Castiel explained.  “These rooms are too big.”
“Does it hurt?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean had been dragged to a few weddings by his parents, but those had been very stuffy formal affairs.  A big ceremony and than a party that he wasn’t allowed to attend.  He wondered what a wizard’s wedding would look like.  Probably lots of flashy magic and grand displays.  Dean made a mental note to ask Cas about it later on.
The kelpie hunched down and snorted.  “No,” it growled.  “He is mine.  And you had your chance to flee.  You are mine as well.”
The rule was stupid and not a single person would break it.  The worst part for Dean was that he understood.  He wouldn’t set out on his own to rescue the princess either because he hadn’t been given the quest to do it.  This was definitely a quest, textbook case of a quest.  Trying to undertake a quest without being tasked with it was a good way to end up dead, enchanted or some horrible combination of the two.  There was no question of your success.  Just how badly you would fail.
“I find her hair intriguing.”
The queen flitted about the room as she spoke.  Servants kept dodging out of her way and almost dropping whatever they were carrying.  She never seemed to notice.  Castiel noticed she never stopped looking at Dean, and he didn’t care for that look.  He wasn’t stupid enough to say anything about it though.  At least not yet.
“We are here to cleanse the Field of the Damned.  To lay these souls to rest.”
“I don’t know,” he admitted.  “We’ll have to wait and see I guess.  She won’t tell us.”
Dean looked at Michael questioningly.
“No.  You challenged a Winchester.  I am a Winchester and I accept your challenge.”
There were three people in Castiel’s life that would be up to such a crime.  Dean loved pies, and liked tarts quite a bit, but he was out settling a dispute and wouldn’t be back until the next day.  His brother Gabriel loved all things sweet, but Gabe wasn’t visiting.  That left one culprit; Jack.
“Oh,” Cas said.  “Like a party?”
The sound of Baby’s footsteps changed and Dean pulled himself upright to look around more carefully. The tiny voice in his head screaming about vigilance seemed happy with this idea.  His shoulder was not as happy.  He hissed in pain and blinked away the spots that appeared in his vision.
“Father, I don’t want to marry Dean.”
Lucifer spent a long moment looking at Dean.  Castiel thought it was probably only a quick glance, but it felt like an eternity.  Finally his brother looked at him again.
“I need to do something before we leave this morning.  I think it might help with,” he gestures vaguely out at the field.
“Your journey is going to slow down shortly, but also speed up.  You’ll want to keep your shield and sword at the ready.”
“Why?”
*******
Dean had been reluctant to leave them behind.  They had obviously been robbing and murdering travelers, but he couldn’t take them along on his quest.  He knew handing them over to any authority figure would have resulted in their deaths, which he felt fine about.  These men had killed an unknown amount of people and deserved to hang.  At the same time, it felt wrong to kill them in their sleep.  Cas had been no help at all.
Castiel was unsure of where he was.  The heat was oppressive.  The strong wind brought no relief, only pummelled him with burning sand.  The landscape was difficult to make out through the blowing sand, but he could make out vague shapes.  It looked like sand stretched out in all directions without end.
“Take me back now,” Castiel snapped.
“Wait,” Jack said.  He walked over to the soldiers he was playing with and picked up his knight.  “I’m sorry.  You should take this.”  He set the knight down and stepped away.
“But you did it for me,” Dean said quietly.  “None of this would have happened if it weren’t for me.”
“It’s something we Novak’s like to do,” Lucifer laughed.  “Now let me play my part to get your son back.”
*****
Castiel didn’t even turn his head.  “When do you introduce me to the princess?”
“Apha-what?”
The sister that came over had the look of a woman who did not tolerate nonsense.  Within moments she had Dean out of his armour and tunic.  Dean had met squires that weren’t as efficient.  The sister ran fingers along his arms and ribs checking for injuries beneath the bruising.  She asked him several clipped questions while staring in his eyes and tapping the side of his head.
Castiel noticed that the knight waited until he had started eating before taking anything.  He also noticed that Dean didn’t take very much.
“I can walk as easily as you two,” Charlie said.  “Gilda can ride, the rest of us can trade off.”
“Can you trust him?  He might have lied.”
Cas had just rubbed Dean’s uninjured shoulder while Rowena lectured him.  After she stomped out he stayed with Dean for a little while longer.  He didn’t bring up Dean’s naked trip to the floor or the wrestling to get him back into bed.
“I am mounting an expedition Moose.  I’ll be needing your help on said expedition.  For a week or two.  Maybe three.”  Crowley glanced down his nose at Sam.  “I’ll provide you with the appropriate dress for our trip.”
Castiel had built up an image of Bobby from Dean’s stories.  Dean spoke highly of him.  While traveling he had wondered if Bobby would live up to those stories.  Moments after meeting the man he decided it was all true.  The man called out a gruff greeting from inside the stable as the rode up.
“Not as badly,” Lucifer said.  “But I wasn’t referring to the spell in this case.”  He pointed to Castiel’s side.
“Well, my brother isn’t either of those,” Gabe assured her.
Dean cried out in pain as the manticore sunk its teeth into his shoulder.  Castiel saw the creature’s tail start to rise up and started to panic when the first stab bounced off Dean’s chest plate.  It wouldn’t take long for those barbs to find flesh and inject their venom into.
“It’s the ring thing again.  Or still really.  I can’t find the right one.”
“I guess,” Dean said softly.  “I don’t really want to marry a princess.  Hoping for better options.”
“Thanks for coming so quickly,” Dean said.  Castiel appreciated his husband making the first steps for him.
“No need for apologizes,” the dwarf dismissed.  “I had simply assumed you would have returned.  You or your man.”  He glanced Cas over.  “Though, I suppose your kind could come here far easier than he could.”
“We can put her on my horse,” Dean told her.  “You too.  I’ll walk.”  He sighed and looked down the way they came.  “It’s going to take a week to reach Rowena.  And that’s if we cross the Fields of the Damned.”
Dean to the chair and tossed the knife back onto the desk.  “Go.  Squash that voice in your head that says you aren’t good enough and find that happiness.  Let yourself be happy for a change.”
“Yeah, that works out well,” Dean said.  He flopped down in a chair.  “She’s nice, but I didn’t want to marry her.”
His first walk in the garden must have provided some proof of something to Raphael.  Dean was allowed to get up more frequently and for longer stretches.  Raphael’s visits went from three times a day down to one, usually first thing in the morning.  He strongly recommended resting in the early afternoon and retiring early for the night.  Dean followed his suggestions, partially because he had learned his lesson and partially because he really was tired enough to need some sleep in the early afternoon.  The days ticked by slowly, but he was recovering.
This went longer than I'd intended, but I didn't want to break before the woods.  I've also realized I am terrible at naming things.  Takes me forever and I'm never completely satisfied with chapter titles or the like.  *shrugs* Oh well, it's posted now.  Hope you enjoy it.
“Who is that?”
The door cracked open some time later.  It could have been minutes or hours later.  He couldn’t have even guessed.  A large woman in a pantsuit stepped through.  She had to duck to fit through the door.  He remembered her.  She was the leader of the coven that had been killing people in the area.  She wielded impressive magic, but it was her ability to lead that made her truly dangerous.
The remaining guard readied his spear and drove the blade toward Jack’s prone form.
“I know it’s silly,” Dean blushed in the dim crypt.  “But, I think there might be something to that story about the lord and land being linked.  I’m happier than I’ve ever been and things are going great.  No one’s going hungry this year.  Even if next year’s harvest is terrible, we’ll have enough.”
Both of them stared at the board for awhile without moving any more pieces or saying anything.  The silence pushed slightly into the uncomfortable territory.  Cas
“Ready for your first quest?”
“I was not wasting time,” Cas protested.  “I was saving your life.  That werewolf almost ripped your arm off.  If I had not taken the time to heal you you would be dead right now.”
He was allowed back into the ICU after Dean’s breathing tube had been removed.  Dean was awake, but groggy.
Castiel kissed the pout off his face.  “No, I do.  I just didn’t really think I’d get to.”
“Do what,” Cas asked.
Castiel wasn’t sure how to respond to that so he didn’t.  He felt a little giddy at the prospect of kissing Dean, but also a great deal of concern over the fact the man said it at all.  He hadn’t known Dean long, but he didn’t strike Castiel as the type of man who would just say something like that.  It reenforced his concern about how injured Dean was.
“Regardless,” she continued.  “Both of you will be here for at least a few more days.  Which brings me to our agreement.”  She turned and dried her hands on a towel.  “Have you contacted your family yet?”
Dean shook his head.  “Your love is gone too.  It’s been hundreds of years.”
CHARLIE: There is an email from you with several attachments.  They look like pictures.  Are they       pictures Dean?
Gilda continued without acknowledging Charlie’s interruption.  “The king provided many, many suitors for Charlie to choose from and she rejected them all.  The tourney was sort of a last-ditch effort for him to give her the chance to choose.  I think he’d have selected someone for her after that.  It would have made everyone miserable.”
******
“What colour are the wounds?  Black or green?”
Dean wheeled on the angel.  “And Sammy almost died because you were with me.  If you have to choose between me and Sam.  Pick Sam.  Always pick Sam.  He’s worth it.”
“My father stormed into the dining hall and banished it,” Cas laughed.  “Then he beat my brother near senseless for doing something so stupid.”
“Umm….sorry?”
Dean glanced sideways at Cas. He seemed as confused as everyone else in the room.  The only ones who seemed to understand what was happening were the two sitting on the thrones.
“What pie?”
He pulled himself to his feet and heard the sobbing at the same time he saw the creature.  Even though it was kneeling with its head bent low to the ground, he could tell it was big.  It almost seemed to be crying as it frantically jerked itself around.  Despite the aggressive pulling it never seemed to move.  It was stuck to the ground by some force, though Castiel didn’t think it was a spell.  Moving to the side he could see a leather cord wrapped around its neck.
Dean doubted anyone would ever be able to describe how he felt in that moment.  The man he loved and the son he had fought so hard for were here.  They were
“One with monsters and knights.”
“And I want to prove I’m worthy of you Cas.”  Dean dropped to a knee in front of Cas and pulled the small wooden box from his pocket.  He cracked the lid and presented it toward Cas.  “Castiel, will you marry me?”
He didn’t know what the mistake was, but he was sure one was made.  The red knight hit the green knight’s shield and than rapped him across the helmet with the side of his sword.  The green knight staggered backward and it was clear that the match was over.  The green knight had lost.  Castiel felt sorry for him and slumped back into his seat.  Others around him, both in the royal box and the surrounding stands seemed to agree with him.  There were equal parts cheering for the red knight’s victory and booing for the same victory.
acting like fools.  Their first priority needed to be how to feed Jack.
The crowd seemed very interested in the match and Castiel found himself caught up in the excitement.  Only a few minutes in it looked like the red knight had won, but after a quick exchange the red knight saluted the green and they began to fight again.  More than once he found himself holding his breath as the two men hammered away at each other.  And a few times he thought that the green knight might actually win this.
A well used road was visible nearby and Baby quickly found the path that led down to it.  She had been in an irritable mood this morning and he let her pick the route.  Dean suspected she didn’t care for the slow pace they’d had to take the last few days.  She always preferred moving quickly and got snappish when she was forced to stay at a slow walk.  Baby loved running and Dean usually indulged her.  He had met few horses that could match her speed or her stamina.  She could run all day without tiring, even while carrying him in full armour.  His armour was tucked away right now and he wore a simple green tunic.
“Really?”  The queen smiled.  There were too many teeth for an instant.  “Perhaps something else than.  Do you have any children?”
Castiel tried to slow his breathing down while calming his horse that was dancing in circles not sure in which direction to run away.  Even Baby was stepping in place.  Dean looked pale, but not hurt.
“Did you ever think about why they’re all wicked?”  Rowena asked.  She had moved over to the kettle and gave the stew a stir.  She leaned over to smell it and frowned slightly.  A few crushed leaves went into the pot and she smelled it again before nodding to herself.
Castiel looked down and saw that the knight in green was once again taking the field.  This time his opponent was wearing red.  It was obvious that the green knight was tired.  Castiel didn’t think it had even been an hour since he had last fought.  He didn’t know anything about setting up the match schedule, but this seemed like a very short rest for the knight.
Castiel laughed.  “She is.  Doesn’t leave much to chance.”
“No problem,” Dean told her.  “Is he one of the music teacher’s students?”
“You’re up early,” Dean said quietly.  His voice sounded off and Castiel was convinced he was right about the crying.
Logically he knew that any adventure story had been edited down to the most exciting bits.  The storyteller might spend an hour regaling their audience with clever third sons of tailors and all the great deeds the boy got up to, but the teller left out the boring bits.  Sleeping under a wagon in the rain didn’t make for great fireside stories.  Nor did hiking across the entire kingdom on foot.  So Castiel had figured this would happen during this quest.  Long stretches of nothing interesting happening.  It was all just so boring.
The panic that Dean had felt on the car ride back was starting to fade.  Frustration and anger were starting to take its place.  Dean was comfortable with angry.  Much better than being scared.  Dean hated feeling scared.  The calmness that Luke was exuding didn’t help Dean relax.  It was just pissing him off.
“It could be worse, Moose.”  Crowley said as he sauntered into the bunker kitchen.  “He could be washing it down with the swill in the fridge.”
Dean grumbled a response and turned back to Castiel.  Dean grabbed his arm and they ran toward the doors that lead into the castle proper.  Sam and Gabe were each tugging on one of the handles.  The door wasn’t budging.
“Is that his name?  It hadn’t come up.  He was too busy shaking a sword at me that he could barely hold on to.  Smart kid, but half my men would have cut him down for that stunt.”
“Were they playing nice,” Castiel asked once his brothers had left.
Charlie leaned in and pulled Gilda into a hug.  “It’s okay baby.  You’re safe now.  I’m safe.”
Luke sighed.  “He’s stable right now.  I think.  That curse, whatever it was, is nasty.  Unnecessarily nasty.  As far as I can tell, it does two things.  First it does a catastrophic amount of physical damage.  You or I would not have survived that alone.  Fortunately, angels seem to be made of sturdy stuff than humans.  The second thing it does is attack the soul.  Again, you or I would have been destroyed outright.  But angels are all soul and Catiel seems to have walled himself off away from the curse.  So the only thing it can find to, eat for lack of a better term, is my magic.”  Luke washed his hands and dried them before continuing.  “That’s why I had to keep upping the power of my spells because the curse kept sucking them up.  I think it’s getting weaker though.”
He waited until they had all returned to their pillars.  The sound of the grinding stone caused by their movement set his teeth on edge.  These were functional guardians, even practical ones, but he wouldn’t have used them to guard anything in his home.
“It’s not business of yours, but there was no one left to send me on a quest.”
“You really aren’t seeing the solution here are you?”
“If you’re that worried about him being hurt, why aren’t you the one casting this spell,” Dean asked.  “It’s dangerous to mess around with magic.”
“The nurse was sitting him at the side of the bed and he developed right sided weakness.  We’ve taken him for a CT scan already.  The official report is pending, but he’s showing signs of a stroke.”
“Well,” Dean laughed.  “You made the mess, you get to clean it.”
“Are you okay?” Dean asked.
Sam shook his head.  “Probably not.  A muse would likely want the festival to go forward.  Stopping the arts doesn’t really match what we know about them.  Maybe a witch?”
It was getting dark and he didn’t think he could depend on the barge to come back now.  He hoped Cas would be okay on his own on the other side of the river.  He shook his head.  Why wouldn’t he?  He was a wizard after all.  He might not be flashy with his magic, but he must know some spells that would keep him safe.  Dean still wanted to get to the other side of the river.  He didn’t want to leave the wizard alone all night.
“Who are you?”
Jessica narrowed her eyes in fond annoyance.  Apparently she was going to have to ask what Dean was planning on wearing in the morning before settling Jack to bed.  It would save on laundry.
“I don’t know.”  Castiel turned away and walked to one of the women.  She told him about the food that was available.  It was a simple meat and vegetable stew, but it was warm and that was something he would miss while on the road.  The enchanted sack his mother gave him would conjure fresh food, but none of it was warm.  The woman also confirmed there was some tarts that would probably deal with Gabe’s sweet tooth.
“We can enjoy it for a bit though,” Castiel said.  “We won’t be staying here forever.  Especially now that you won’t be able to marry Charlie.”
It took more effort than he’d thought possible to sit up.  It was a herculean effort to get to the door. He pulled it opened and leaned against it for support.
“A ring?” The dwarf asked.
Helen laughed the laugh he liked.  “I don’t doubt that at all.  I saw your first attempt.  But you did it.”  She leaned in and whispered.  “Now do you want a real secret to making a great pie?”
“I was hoping that he’d be so happy to see me come back that he wouldn’t question it,” Charlie said.  “And that I’d finally chosen a suitor.”
Michael looked up and nodded.  “I’ll get her to Raphael and meet you down there.”  There was a crack of thunder and bolt of lightening snaked down from the clear sky and struck him.  Another bolt cracked down and Michael was standing next to Lilith.
“Mine too.”  Dean stepped inside and closed the door.  “Even back home I don’t have this much space.  It’s nice, but a bit much.”
Dean realized he was still holding onto Cas’ arms and let his own drop.  “Um, so is there anything you want to do while you pretend to be human?  Or should you keep resting?”
“I did not challenge you boy,” Michael said.  “I challenged him.”
Castiel took a slow breath and pulled at the magic he had felt before.  He wasn’t used to channeling raw magic.  Spells were safer, but you needed to know the
Well, he wanted to shout.  What came out was more of a hoarse croak.  He barely heard it himself and the voices continued.  He tried again and had a bit more success.  The voices stopped and he heard walking.
“What do you plan to do tomorrow?” Cas asked.  “For my father we each light a candle and prepare his favourite meal.”
Michael and Dean moved some of the furniture to make more space for Jack to play in.  The adults took it in turn to play with him, but none of them were allowed to even touch the knight.  That was Jack’s alone.
“Kay, the spell will last that long at least.”  Luke was quite for a moment, but the gibberish he’d been muttering before didn’t pick up again.  “I already owe you guys a lot, but is there coffee there?”
The sun was warm on his face as Dean rode out of the forest.  The advice the woodcutter and his wife gave him had proven helpful in getting him and Baby through safely.  One of his tutors had always insisted that advice obtained during a quest must be followed to the letter.  While Dean didn’t think going to a tourney was a quest, especially since he’d given it to himself, not following a humble woodcutter’s advice while traveling through a forest was a good way to end up enchanted.  Or at least lost.  There were rules to these sorts of things and it was usually best to follow them.
There was a knock at the door.
“You’re sure?”
Dean’s phone vibrated.
“After you saved mine,” Cas countered.  “Twice actually.”  He pushed the sword back toward Dean.  “Please take it.  It would mean a lot to me if you did.”
There was an awkward pause.
Their first fight almost occurred within the first week.  Dean had cleared out a room on the first floor to be a study for him.  It was a nice enough room.  Big enough for whatever his needs were, but it was so far from Dean’s.  He politely turned it down and instead took over a small corner of Dean’s study.  At least to begin with.  He spread out a bit and Dean kept having to move Castiel’s books to get to his own.  They never spoke about it, but Castiel melted a little every time Dean didn’t say anything and just handed him a book or scroll or vaguely glowing leaf.
Lauren agrees, “Like, when he first came in? I thought that he was kinda clinging to her? And now it seems like maybe Miracle picked up on that? And is sticking close for his sake?”
Dean hears the click and wind of Eileen’s camera, but he ignores it. Maybe is happy to hear it. He’d like a relic of this moment.
“Dean,” Cas says seriously, voice a wrecked rasp. “Your nose is crooked.”
Dean blinks through new tears tessellating his lashes. “You… You mean get him back?” His voice is shot to hell and it breaks when he says him, like he was going to say Cas’s name. But for the first time since they split up last night, Sam thinks he sees something like hope blossom over Dean.

“All right, well, I’ll do that too. But I still wanna beat up Joe Exotic. And that other guy. The cult guy, in South Carolina.”
Good Little Brother.
“Dude.” Sam is leveling him with quite the unimpressed look. “Last week, the two of you were on Facetime for almost three hours. It’s gonna be awkward and silly and then you’re gonna get back to being yourselves and it’ll be fine.”
“Bring the wee one up then!” Rowena insists, clapping her hands. Her teenage son has long-since rolled his eyes and abandoned the frame.
“I don’t want you thinkin’ that way. I don’t want you hitching all your hope to my wagon, you know.”
Then Claire shouts, “We’ll make the popcorn!” and suddenly it’s just Cas and Dean sitting at the table.
There’s something rising up in Dean and it might be bile, it might be tears. It might be that hollow, choking feeling that has followed every defeat they’ve found their way into, every unforced error, every blockade that’s risen from the snowmelt of every almost-success. All that comes out, though, is a strangled out cry.
. And then, for certainly not the first time,
Dean doesn’t rise to the bait, instead slings a smile across the couch. “Yeah, I guess it does. Worse people to be stuck with then my pain-in-the-ass little brother.”
“Congratulations on making it through another shift.” There’s an emoji of a happy face blowing a party horn as well and it’s stupid, it’s so stupid, but it makes Dean smile at his phone for another full minute.
As Mary put in his information, we all read over her shoulder, eager for the gossip of someone new and handsome. Dean Carter was 41, which was older than any of us would have assumed, and gave an address just outside of Lebanon (“I didn’t know people still lived out that way,” Jessica had commented with a wrinkled nose.). The dog, which turned out to be a female actually, was named Miracle.
In the next minute Amanda has the exam room set and ushers Dean in with Miracle. Sam elects to stay in the lobby and watches his brother go. Once the door closes behind them, Sam turns to the counter and Jessica behind it.
“Cas Carter,” Dean replies. “He’s my husband.” And then he rattles off a cell phone number and the same Lebanon address as his own and Mary, admirable, gets it all entered on the first try.
As they push out of the bar and into the cool October night, Cas proving to need some help. Dean slips an arm under his -- with the height he has on Cas it pitches Cas's shoulder up, their faces close.
“But first, you have to sleep,” Cas hums.
Dean inhales deep, holds it, and then lets it out in a rush. “Talking to you don’t hurt, either,” he says, softly but sure that Cas can still hear him across the line.
There’s a moment, just a minute, as they’re heading for the garage, when Mary is ahead of them (that’s still a head trip, his
and huffed out something that was not, by the strictest definition, a laugh. “Maybe it’s just the beard,” he joked and Dean laughed and then Cas was back with wet hair, looking soft and rumpled and Dean had to look away.
Cas kisses back and Dean doesn’t think of Meg, or Daphne, or April, or that Gas ‘n Sip manager from Idaho. He just thinks
