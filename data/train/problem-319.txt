The bedroom fell alarmingly quiet with Greg’s question. Silence hovered in the air as heavy as fog. Out of everyone, John had thought Greg knew what happened to Sherlock when he was going, since both of them were connected with Mycroft. Apparently not. It seemed that Mycroft wasn’t only keeping secrets from him after all.  John glanced from Greg’s shocked expression to Sherlock’s still bare back, and to the floor, where the black dress shirt had been for the night. Wordlessly, John grabbed it, and handed it out to Sherlock, whose pale hand was already there and waiting. The shirt was gone in a matter of seconds.
John fought not to roll his eyes, thinking that the man probably assumed something of their relationship, like everyone else did. That his thoughts probably fell in the line of ‘Not his date’, ‘Not his boyfriend’, or ‘Live-in P.A’ or some variation of all three. Thinking of Sherlock, John glanced over to him after he sat down. The taller man was fixed like a statue by the window. Arms crossed, stone features, the usual business face. One that painted him as a ‘high-functioning sociopath’ to the outside world and not as man that John knew him to be. Underneath the facade, he could see Sherlock’s mind churning in thought. He could also see his impatience. John cleared his throat, pushing forward because someone had to.
Her one-worded answers just added to the fuel in John’s anger. “It didn’t matter much then? I didn’t fail to notice that our lives would be saving your skin too.”
John fixed a hand around Sherlock’s cock, teasingly moved his hand down the hardened silk shaft. Both their breaths hitched. John continued the motion trying different pressure to see what Sherlock liked. The motion was dry. John rubbed his thumb over the slit, smearing the precum to make the glide smoother, and it helped. But John knew that wasn’t enough, it wouldn’t have been for him.
John swallowed the lump his throat, swelling by the second from Moriarty’s indifference. Moran was a prick… maybe a lot more than that, but killing him would have pleased Moriarty. John was glad that he didn’t, but he rather wished he had done more than just trapping him in the boot of a cab.
Stepping on the small landing, John felt like he was thrown into a new eerie world. An unsettling feeling lingered in the air, chilly and barren. It seemed like no one had lived on that floor for some time, leaving it lifeless. And if someone had lived in this house, it seemed to have sucked the happiness out of anyone that stepped foot in here. His torch bathed the second floor in white, pale stillness.
Shrugging it off, John went upstairs to his bedroom and grabbed the extra medical kit from the back of his closet. He returned downstairs and into the kitchen where he left Sherlock. He blinked at the scene before him.
John paused, feeling the throb of Sherlock’s cock. It radiated his desperate need to come. Feeling a bit smug with himself, John held his other hand on the back of Sherlock’s head, then pulled his hair, just slightly to get Sherlock to lift his head. They stared at each other for a few seconds, John’s hand still wrapped around his madman’s cock.
“No defensive wounds like the first two victims. Stabbed in the heart from the front, the killer changed to a longer weapon, judging by the minor exit wound here.” Sherlock pointed out a small pinprick on the grey skin. The smallest river of red had trailed over the victim’s side. “The throat was cut, possibly to prevent calling out for help. Worthless really, the victim would have been in too much pain to do so.”
“But there’re two bodies,” argued Lestrade, joining them, and eyeing the victims. “How do you know that there was only supposed to be one?”
“Where’s your card, Sherlock?” asked John, glancing around the room in all of the obvious and usual places. On the floor in the corner. Behind his bedroom door. Underneath the bed. “It’s not where you normally keep it.”
“If he had, it certainly wasn’t the first time you’ve been hung up on,” Sherlock countered informally. “Send him a text if it bothers you. I doubt he would respond. Even I heard the shout about a body from here. He’s busy.”
Potted plants hovered in the corners; squeezed in the middle of the foliage were plastic chairs lined in a row. Faint sunlight trickled though the large windows, clashing with the bright fluorescent lights overhead. Their footsteps echoed noisily through the quiet atmosphere. Sherlock stopped abruptly before one of the doors. Written in gold calligraphy over textured glass was ‘Office 129’, below which it was ‘Dean of Education’. A shadow darted across the other side of the window. John caught Sherlock’s sleeve before he could push open the dark wooden door.
There was a noticeable fall in Peter’s face before he suddenly reached into his pocket, and pulled out a pen. He snatched up John’s hand. Numbers bled over the top, covering his skin in messy blue scrawl. Peter stepped away. “I forgot my mobile at my flat today. It would be nice to see a text from you, John Holmes, when I get home. Maybe we could get a drink.”
“Well…yes…I guess we are getting there,” John replied with a shrug. Getting there? That was definitely an understatement. He knew what Sherlock -‘supposedly’- wanted. He knew what he wanted. It was the fact that -he couldn’t…didn’t want to do anything while still being married. Both Sherlock, -and he, himself, deserved to be ‘all in’. There was also another complication: what equals to being ‘all in’ with Sherlock? That was something that they hadn’t talked about yet. “Conversations are neither of our strong suits, you know?”
John pointedly ignored her, opened the door and walked into the daylight. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, face tilted up facing the sky. He was grounded by the warmth of the sun. It felt like he was back in Afghanistan. His posture stiffened, his legs heavy as he marched down the road towards Moriarty. He was ready to fight.
“It wasn’t bruising on their necks, but charcoal residue. There is a small possibility that it transferred from the killer to the victims somehow, but there were no signs of struggle. The blood found on the bricks and pavement is a match to both victims. Unfortunately, the leaf found at the crime scene is still being tested. Other than that, I’m uncertain and I don’t like being uncertain. Molly found standard yellow paint on the victims that could be found at any hardware store, the paint most likely stained their dominant hand-” His head jerked towards Lestrade.
John walked down the sidewalk with an armful of grocery from the nearby store, knowing that their supplies in the flat were dwindling nightly. He weaved around the sea of people as he made his way back to 221B Baker Street, his residence for the last two months. Since Mary’s disappearance and the reappearance of Moriarty.
John glanced across the road; looking at cars parked, with luckily zero witnesses around. He turned back to Moran. “You’re going into the boot of one of those cars. Either willingly or knocked out, understand?”
John glared at Sherlock. The air in the cab was thick and suffocating. He wanted yell, scream at Sherlock that he better not think once about leaving him out of the fire again. He wanted to shake some sense into the detective. Silence lingered between them until the cab pulled up to the curb outside of Baker Street. John glanced up to the second story as he got out of the cab. His eyes fixed on the windows where they both call home, not knowing what he was going to do or say when they were alone. But something needed to be said, and now.
John nodded. “What about the crime scene? And the husband?” He tapped on his leg. “I’m fine if you want to head back to there or to the Yard.”
As soon as they were in a different alleyway, with the pub door closed behind them, John lost it. His back met the white bricks. Laughter spilled from his lips as tried to form a coherent sentence.
John could taste his heartbeat. Questions pulsed through his mind. Could it be Sherlock? When his mad flatmate would poke around in his things, he usually left the mirror alone. It was like Sherlock knew its purpose and never messed with it. Unlike him, who disturbed Sherlock’s sock index and the detective fell in a snit the first time. His glance switched between his nightstand where he tucked away his gun after his shower earlier this morning and his chest of drawers. It wasn’t large enough for someone other than himself to climb inside comfortably. Maybe he was being absentminded whilst getting dressed this morning. After waking up in Sherlock’s bed, their flirting, the kiss…it was enough for him to lose his mental capacity. Yeah, he must have closed it. Finally, Sherlock had found another way to drive him mental.
The dry laughter that escaped John’s throat was sarcastic and disbelieving. What exactly was Mary expecting him decide on during a gun standoff? Whether or not to shoot Mary or let her walk away? Or be shot himself? It was all more than a little confusing. And something in the back of his mind told him that it would probably become more complicated as they continued to aim at each other.
“It’s an experiment,” Sherlock stated before John could pull one out of a hat and finish explaining. “I was tracking his circadian rhythms.”
“I’m fine. I just…ran into a door. A rather large door, didn’t see it coming actually,” John feigned as he mentally promised to deck Sherlock the next time he saw him.
“Oh good. You are awake. I was a bit concerned for you. No, Sherlock isn’t here, poor man is probably worried sick that you’re gone. Me on the other hand,” Mrs. Hudson sighed dramatically. “For someone who’s observant about my comings and goings, neither of you noticed I was missing.”
John glanced over his shoulder, pondering if he should expect Moran to suddenly appear in the doorway. It was empty. John returned his eyes back to Sherlock. “Moriarty walked away that day at the pool, but on the roof, you said he blew his brains out. No one can walk away from that. Right now, you are remembering a ghost and nothing more.”
John met his eyes steel colored eyes framed by dark untamed curls, and the scowl of frustration. He ignored it, plunging forward as the steady head to Sherlock’s whirlwind. “The body, rigor hasn’t set in. The blood is still clotting.”
“Alright. I’m…” Sherlock held himself still for a moment and breathed really hard before he continued, “I’m perfectly fine.”
“I didn’t mean all of your clothes,” John muttered exasperatedly, his fingers pinched the bridge of his nose, and he repeated. “People are going to see you naked.”
“Same as the other two,” confirmed John quietly as soon as he was in Greg’s earshot. He leaned close to Lestrade and added, “Gunshot wounds. I counted six for the female. Dead about two hours ago.”
Sherlock pulled away. John’s lips still buzzed from the contact as he met Sherlock’s grey-green eyes. “I didn’t die though. If Moriarty was slightly cleverer or myself a little less…well…”
In the room, it was just them. With the drapes open, the beginning of sunrise painted through the sky, splattering through the shades of grey.
Sherlock answered breathlessly. “Yes. I believe so. I’ve never tested it myself. Sensitive follicles could be considered to be the prelude to foreplay in this case.”
Mary shrugged, John’s words figuratively rolled past her, and they obviously meant nothing to her. It’s not like John could tell now. When she was still pretending to be average…John could. Now, seeing the woman he had married, then divorce after two months, no, John was pretty sure his words meant nothing to her... this was coming from the woman who never let him have a say with anything to begin with.
Mrs. Hudson nodded as she picked up random scatterings of newspaper articles from the floor. “Yes, he was considerably rude too, telling me to shut up in my own house.”
“I’m not going anywhere,” he mumbled against Sherlock’s mouth, “I have no plans on dying anytime soon.”
Sherlock’s voice came from the other side of the door after a few moments of a quiet pause, “It helps me think.”
He also wasn’t sure if Sherlock should be taking his clothes off without him. John should be undoing one button at a time, revealing all that pale skin, until Sherlock was as naked as he was. That was a progress no one should do alone.
Then Sherlock leaned forward, catching John in a deep, filthy snog, shutting the army doctor up. John returned it was vigor. He had immediately forgotten that he was in the middle of a sentence. His hands were released, and slowly beelined to Sherlock’s weakness, and threaded through the inky curls, earning a deep rumble from the detective.
“Dangerous, Sherlock,” interceded John. He didn’t like it; his left hand twitched at his side. Something didn’t sit right in his gut. No other lower class criminals had ever demanded to speak with Sherlock before. They would only seem right pissed when he’s involved, and the usual threats were made.
The other man laughed and the sound of a zipper being drawn closed. “What? You don’t fancy breaking another table? Could always add another green one.”
The other man drew to his feet. Pain simply radiated from his body. “I can’t go back not after becoming your hostage. He’ll kill me.”
Before John could respond, the phone was snatched out his hand. “Your best people? Your best people can’t even tell the difference between a threat to the country and an innocent man! I’ll handle this.”
John sighed, his head pounded from the caffeine, which was not working fast enough. “He plans his fixes around my schedule. He’s been getting high while I’ve been working. I’m putting a stop to it.”
“I was joking, yesterday, about sending Mycroft a cake. You shouldn’t tempt him into failure like that just so you can remind him of his weaknesses,” John lectured flatly.
The living room was empty as he padded through. Upon entering the kitchen, John found Sherlock glued to his microscope. He shuffled to the coffee maker, filling it full of water as he asked. “Experiment or the case?”
The tied man struggled while he sat and the gun - John was right- happily waved around Issac’s face, causing the man to scream against the tape. Moran sighed and smacked the gun against Issac’s face before he continued. “I know you’ve received text messages stipulating to find him in 48 hours or you’re dead, Sherlock. But there’s been a command to change the rules.”
John didn’t pause at the door; instead he pushed it open and walked inside. There was some pride in interrupting Mycroft. He partly expected Sherlock to be in the bed. How terribly injured would he be if he were insulting the hospital staff? Who knew how many people have come across Sherlock, tried to tend to his injuries but instead had gotten sliced by his sharp mouth. He was also verbally sparring with Mycroft- all good signs?
His remark either went unheard, or ignored as Sherlock descended down the stairs, two at a time, before disappearing altogether. John followed just as quickly and yanked the black door closed. Sherlock hailed a cab; John quickly trailed inside after him.
Before John could finish, Sherlock bolted from the sofa. John watched as Sherlock through the door, and noisy footfalls echoed up the wooden stairs. John quickly followed. He walked through the doorway and was bombarded by the taller man in seconds.
Even during the wee morning hours, traffic was horrendous. To John, the cab wasn’t moving nearly fast enough to the hospital. His nerves were a wreck all because Sherlock was an idiot. Was it Sherlock fault it got physical? John just had a feeling it was. And now, he was feeling concerned and worried for the said idiot. How badly was he hurt? How exactly did the idiot get hurt? The last John knew, Sherlock dismissed him and sent him away with Lestrade to speak to the killer alone. Did something happened right then?
He bolted upright in bed, panting; a faint sheen of sweat covering over his skin. His heart pounded in his ribcage. John groaned, throwing his thin sheet on the floor in frustration, glaring at the state of his lower body, straining against his pants. Bright sunlight gleamed through the window, splashing an array of scattered rainbows over bed. He flopped down on his back, throwing an arm over his eyes to try to cast flashes of his dreams from his mind. Thin pale fingers trailed over his skin. A deep voice accompanied by dark curls. Lips wrapped around a certain part of his anatomy. Even without recalling all the details, there was only one person near him who fit a profile like that. Sherlock.
Not the way he left it. The soldier in him couldn’t leave a blind spot in room while he was sleeping.
“ Your sergeant here refuses to let me interview the criminal,” Sherlock stated matter-of-factly to Lestrade’s question.
They climbed into the cab. John shifted between looking out the window and glancing over at Sherlock, whose façade disappeared the moment they pulled away from the block of flats. Orange lights enhanced Sherlock’s features; John noted that his eyes were larger than normal. Shocked.
“Mixture?” John asked before it suddenly clicked in his head- “You can’t drug your brother,” he reprimanded with another sigh, knowing full well of Sherlock’s conspiring tone and being Sherlock’s drugged experiment more than once…apparently. “The whole government would fall if he blacked out for an entire Wednesday.”
Two pairs of feet ran by the bar, the owners chuckling and talking lowly. The light clicked off, drowning the pub in darkness again. A door slammed in the distance. Moans radiated from upstairs, along with a rhythmic scraping sound. John swallowed heavily. Placing a hand on the bar, he stood carefully, stunned to find his knees were a bit weak. He tucked his gun away. Heat flushed over his face when he found Sherlock staring at him with his calculative eyes before turning away. He followed Sherlock through the pub, going out the back door, thankfully without a bell overhead.
John snorted at Sherlock’s choice of words while he plugged the tub. Water from the shower started filling up the bathtub when Sherlock sat on the other end, away from the water spraying down from the shower.
“An accident on the road to the prison. The driver had a likeness to Moran, swapped out of his clothing and sent to prison instead.”
John shook his head, and pressed his mouth together in a thin line, wary from Moriarty’s outburst and of the man himself. For all that Moriarty sounded and looked like, there was no way to measure how he would lash out. No way to tell if everything that John saw was real, or if it was faked- everything from his emotional outburst to being in a wheelchair. He was scarred much like John himself. There was no way to tell if Moriarty even had a weapon of some sort, planted nearby.
“Indian food it is then. I’ll go place the order.” He padded across the room, neglecting to pick up his oatmeal-colored jumper on Sherlock’s bedroom floor that had fallen from his lap. He’ll get it later. Some deep, dark part of him, liked to see his clothing on Sherlock’s bedroom floor. That very same part of him, wouldn’t mind seeing Sherlock’s clothing on the floor either, eventually.
Sherlock’s eyes trailed up and down John’s body, narrowed trying to deduce John’s body language if he was serious about it. Then Sherlock stepped out of the tub, walked to John slowly. Clever fingers swiftly removed John’s towel, and let it drop to the floor.
John shrugged. “Yeah, not sorry one bit. Take it since you keep finishing my sentences and won’t let me get a word in.”
“This is murder, not a mugging,” stated Sherlock. He waved his hand over the crime scene. “A 70kg person contains 5.5 liters of blood. Times that by two. There are no traces of blood on this pavement. So where is it? I don’t recall blood being able to evaporate out of thin air. The bodies were dumped here.”
He pointedly ignored the CCTV cameras turning slowly like a pair of eyes watching his every step… which they probably were.
Sherlock lifted his dropped jaw with a blush. “First drawer, bedside table. Put the condom on yourself. I won’t require much preparation.”
But he was still reeling from Sherlock’s confession, partly because he knew that he should have said something back that was more profound, more meaningful to the both of them, things that he should have said a long time ago, and never did.
John paused. He swallowed heavily; recalling the last two times that Sherlock had composed a piece. One: The Woman. Two: Was something that he wished to move on from.
“Sorry,” John offered gently as he released Sherlock’s hair and the detective let out a small hiss. “I didn’t know I was hurting you.”
John shook his head and held his arms out, waiting. His eyes were clamped shut to give Sherlock privacy as he heard rustling sounds from somewhere in the professor’s office. From the other side of the office door, he could hear student chatter. “That was a joke, you know. I didn’t expect you to actually go through with it.”
Molly shook her head, her brown ponytail waving behind her shoulders, brushing against her white lab coat. She motioned to the morgue door and walked over. Her hand rested on the silver handle. “I have to get back to Mr. Garrideb. I have two more postmortems after him. I’ll probably see you both later.”
The inspector shook his head, pausing, “I…don’t…I wasn’t paying attention. How important is the color of the walls?”
God. They had kissed. It seemed unbelievable to fathom after so many years. And it was a fantastic kiss. But what exactly did it mean for them? Was it a one-time thing? Was it a point that Sherlock had to make to ‘fix’ what he broke? John rinsed the shampoo from his hair, trying to mute out the questions that plagued his mind with the sounds of running water before shutting off the tap completely.
Sighing, he rubbed his forehead with his sweaty palm and lowered his face to the floor. This nervous habit of his … it’s bad. He knew it would send Sherlock mixed signals.
“This is a waste of time, Rose,” stated the man from the wall. “Just make the trade and be done with him. It wouldn’t matter soon afterwards. You heard what he said.”
John hummed into the kiss when Sherlock’s arms encircled around him, tracing his long fingers along John’s back. His vest wrinkled upon the pressure of Sherlock’s fingertips. John could feel the warmth of those hands over his back, burning into his skin underneath.
He yawned against his own will as he spoke. “All positions are masculine when there’s two men involved, Sherlock.”
John shrugged. “I live with him. It’s hard not to start thinking like him. You need to lock the blocks of flats down.”
“I’ll keep that in mind. There’s one more topic that we talked about. When Sebastian Moran came into our flat as Joseph Mollet, he gave me his mobile numbers in case you changed your mind about taking the ‘fake’ case.”
Lestrade’s heavy steps creaked over the wooden floor and down the stairs, leaving John in the kitchen with Sherlock. Out of the corner of his eye, John could see that studious gaze roaming over him. Teal eyes focused on his face. John sighed.
“How do you know it’s not the professor?” he asked, hoping that it would be that easy to avoid this.
The fact of the matter, was, John did not bed a partner every night. And he certainly did not bed Sherlock, whose exotic looks could turn a person towards their greatest sin. If it was a different time, Sherlock could have made cities fall to ruin or inspire paramount works of art. John would bed him. Right now. Sherlock’s willingness, and his offer made to John and John alone made his heart jump.
John giggled anyway, despite knowing the reason why they were there. When the cab stopped, Sherlock flew out of the car. John paid the cabbie, and apologized. He followed Sherlock, reaching his side when Lestrade came over to the edge of the police tape.
Silence befell the DI’s simple office in New Scotland Yard while three men crowded around a computer. John watched the footage of the CCTV over Sherlock’s right shoulder. The scent of the detective’s cologne wafted over his nose, the pale column of Sherlock’s neck teased him with every throb of Sherlock’s pulse. John licked his lips; glances flickered between skin and screen. His shoulder brushed against Greg’s, who was perched over Sherlock’s other shoulder, watching the small computer screen with rapt attention. John signed deeply, ignoring whether to follow his impulse or his urge to solve the case so he could get on with snogging a certain detective. Not Greg. The other detective. He had to consider his intuition as well, waiting for his impending divorce in order to snog said detective. John shook his head, erasing that last thought. It was no longer pending divorce, at least, according to the text message that burned within his pocket when he glanced at outside of Bart’s while Sherlock had hailed a cab.
The DI sighed when Sherlock didn’t put forth an answer. Instead, John offered, “The man who entered the lobby, he wasn’t in the other footage.”
“You can look if you like. I would do the same if I were the doctor and the addict was left alone for several hours with his drug of choice only a few feet away,” Sherlock stated. His clothed arms held up to John, willingly, in surrender, which took John a bit by surprise, considering it was only yesterday morning when they last fought about it. “I’ve been sitting here, staring at it. Considering it. Fixed between the temptation and choices to make to keep-”
Sherlock poured the wine as he spoke. John watched pale fingers hugging the shallow stem. “John, you usually chastise me for conversing about murder in a public setting.”
The baby’s wails morphed into screams. Sherlock pulled away from John’s shoulder and stood. “Apparently, this is going to take a more delicate approach.”
He sprung forward snatching Sherlock’s mouth in frenzy, earning a surprised hum from the detective. Gone were the hesitancy, the walls, and the line drawn in the sand. John groaned into the kiss when Sherlock finally got with the program. His tongue trailed the seal of Sherlock’s lips that opened to up to him willingly. John’s hands found the inky curls, held Sherlock’s head in place to kiss him harder and deeper. No words could express how he felt, so with the movements of his body, to reinforce his words that he loved Sherlock. Had always. Will always.
Stuck barely in eyesight was a yellow post-it note on the underside of the counter. Not that odd of a concept, considering that John uses them inside the refrigerator at home. Except this one had his name written on it, in clear, almost feminine scrawl. He groaned. He knew that he shouldn’t even look at it, or even take it. But he did.
“Yes. But there’s more to this! Can’t you feel it? I only matched the soil to prove what we saw on the footage. There’s absolutely nothing to prove that the jumper or ‘Joe Bloggs’ was in the flat with Oliver Izard, stabbed him and killed him. There were two other men on the footage outside the row of flats. Nothing inside the lobby! Nothing! Don’t you see it? You’re not an imbecile and occasionally you do prove to be a decent officer. You know I’m right!”
“I don’t make the rules,” Moran shrugged, and struck a match to light his cigarette. Smoke trickled from his mouth as he spoke. “But two more people will follow this poor lad here if you don’t figure out the message. Remember, start at the beginning, yeah? That’s your first hint, the second hint… well… take a great look at Spoo’s forehead before I ruin it.”
“It’s an interesting thought, lives end, and once it’s over, it’s not the person in death that will miss it, but the people that were left behind.” John groaned when a warm tongue licked over his collarbone. The fabric of John’s cotton vest stretched with soft crinkles as Sherlock exposed his ruined shoulder completely to the sun lit bedroom. John exhaled, and threw his head back when gentle kisses peppered over the ugly silver webbings. Nimble fingers followed the pathways of scar tissue caused by the secondary infection. John bit his lip when a warm tongue crossed over the pathways.
“An idiot,” Sherlock replied simply before taking a sip of wine. “Hopefully fingerprints will prove positive for leads, otherwise I should be called in tomorrow morning.”
Feeling his eyebrows meeting his hairline, John watched as Sherlock paced away from the window. His hands fixed underneath his chin in a steeple as he gracefully sat down in his chair. John fought not to roll his eyes again, knowing that if they were alone, Sherlock would flop onto the cushion with a sprawl of ungraceful limbs. He had been close to being kicked with one of those long legs several times.
His attempted joke fell flat. A blaring mobile brought life back into the dead space, jarring John out of his racing thoughts about last night and Sherlock.
Footsteps echoed through the room, joined with the telling click of an umbrella against outdated hospital floor. Mycroft’s voice came from farther away. John had rather hoped he was by the door. Or, headed there. He needed to talk to Sherlock without big brother watching.
John rested his forehead against Sherlock’s. He closed his eyes, savoring the taste of Sherlock on his lips. Sharing his air that he breathed. John dragged his fingers through Sherlock’s soft hair, fingernails lightly massaging the detective’s scalp. Sherlock moaned softly. John smiled when he was pecked lightly on the lips. “Jesus, you’re fantastic.”
John licked his lips, focusing on the blond and the brunet- there was something about the brunet that he couldn’t place. “Sherlock, doesn’t the blond male look a bit like the jumper from last night? I mean, from what was left of him at the morgue. About the same height and weight.”
“Pity.” He spat that word out in distain. -“For someone who wanted my help, he sure wasn’t grateful for it. Would whine about everything. It took him about six months or so to see things my way. Breaking him-” Moriarty paused, and cleared his throat when his voice grew too garbled to understand. “Sorry… breaking him gave me something to do during recovery, but it wasn’t the same as being here, playing the game.”
Violin music radiated throughout the flat. John sipped his tea, scanning through the paper, listening to pencil scratching as Sherlock decided on the notes. Every so often, he would offer an opinion, causing them to bicker. It wasn’t too much longer until John couldn’t contain his yawning. He didn’t bother to disturb Sherlock who was fully engrossed in his task. John brushed his teeth, went upstairs, changed his clothes, and climbed into bed. He drifted off to the sounds of the violin.
“Sherlock is fine as far as I know with all that. He’s fine as far as he knows. Had Mycroft mentioned anything to you about a third person? Or Moriarty?”
“Yes?” he squeaked. Oh yes, John knew that he was completely mental. He hadn’t squeaked since puberty. He cleared his throat, hoping to salvage any look of sanity.
He wiped the tang from his mouth on sleeve of Sherlock’s dressing gown. John went back to the wrecked cab, and seemingly kept an eye on Moran at the same time. He pulled the key from the ignition.
That wasn’t how John remembered it. His pulse quickened thinking about the red sight lines on Sherlock. And the smell of gun and blood carried in the air. John remembered the wind swirling around them, and Sherlock’s voice within the noise, promising that Mary was safe now, he was safe now, and so was his child. John declaring Christ’s name in every way known to mankind. Surprise must have shown on John’s face because Sherlock added. “Mycroft didn’t tell you.”
“-tortured, Sherlock. Serbia could’ve ended worse than scars on your back. Do tell me if you choose to keep Dr. Watson out of the line of fire again. That-“
It looked like Moran was knocked out. John checked the man’s pulse. It was fine, until it wasn’t, and that’s when Moran opened his eyes. Rage. Undiluted anger narrowed in John’s direction.
“There’s someone in there,” John whispered, motioning at the door, the muffled sounds of someone talking on the other side.
A flare of ice went down his spine. Then he recalled what AJ had said earlier. Mrs. Hudson was the bait to trap him, so… “I’m the lure for Sherlock. You were going to hand me over to Moriarty. You were going to give him both of us.”
John couldn’t finish his sentence. Words failed him just from feeling the way Sherlock’s body welcomed him. He caressed inside the tight heat, scissoring his fingers, stretching the muscles in hopes that Sherlock’s body would welcome him again.
He slammed his mouth shut immediately after his outburst, humming lowly, and closed his eyes, trying to gather himself before talking again. He walked forward, his hands resting on and then squeezing the worn fabric of the back of his chair.
With that, Sherlock stalked away, with his collar upturned. John snorted and glanced back at Lestrade. “I’m taking that as a no. You better meet us there.”
“Your behavior is pointless,” John countered lamely as Sherlock crossed the flat and dramatically flopped on the brown leather couch. John saw a flash of Sherlock’s face before the taller man turned, sulking, and giving John the view of his back. Shaking his head, John retreated into the kitchen to put the kettle on.
He pushed away from the wall, and followed Sherlock further down the alleyway. Wordlessly, John took in the scene before them. Blending in with the red brick of the neighboring building was a streak of dark red stain. Then a pool of dark red hugged the wall. In the middle of the blood, sat a silver knife, and a large leaf.  “We found it.”
“File a missing person report at New Scotland Yard. This seems like a case that may appeal to their abilities. It might actually showcase some talent.”
“I have no idea, Greg,” he answered truthfully. The mobile beeped his ear, John pulled away, and the read the caller ID. Mycroft. John sighed before returning the phone to his ear. “I’ve got to go. Mycroft ringing.”
“-But I didn’t want to kill her or have her killed. You don’t either. When you marry someone, build a life with someone, and she betrays you, it’s difficult to put it past you, but you work at it. Then someday you can look back and let it go.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at him. John noted that his eyes were steely-blue this time. Lestrade pressed forward, handing two pairs of gloves over to John. John wordlessly passed the other pair to Sherlock. John snapped the latex gloves on with ease.
“I will say this plainly then since you do not see it. I will not tell Sherlock about Mrs. Watson, if you do not tell him about our conversations of Moriarty and what you’ve learned about our third.”
In this moment that John could bring the end to all things. He would stare Moriarty in the eyes and watch his life seep away from them. This man- monster had created nothing but pain for all who came across him. John slowly squeezed the trigger…
John pulled his jumper over his head, his voice muffled as he spoke. “Missing dinner or force feeding you breakfast?” he asked, and then added. “Besides a bit early to talk about ‘spending the night together.’ Even you should know what that means. And you haven’t even kissed me yet.” He hesitated, “unless you don’t…”
The corridors were empty by the time they had paid the cabbie and ventured into the main building. University students rode up on the lift with them before exiting the elevator on the third floor at a run. John didn’t question to where they were heading, knowing all full well that Sherlock probably knew where to go. The music in the lift continued to play until the doors opened on fourth floor, revealing an empty corridor painted dull grey, lined with office doors.
But now, it would be forever, a lifetime like this. He grabbed the front of Sherlock’s suit and pulled. Anchoring the taller detective downwards as he went on tiptoes, holding onto Sherlock’s shoulders.
Long legs wrapped around John’s waist, pinning their hardness against each other. John felt Sherlock freeze underneath him. He moved away from the neck, pulled at the detective’s hair to turn Sherlock’s face towards him. Mouth open fixed, eyes closed, face flushed with sheen of sweat on the darkened brow. John followed the pleasure seconds later, thrusting his hips against Sherlock one last time.
“Megan Hageman. 2343 Battery Road! She should be home. They were supposed to make it look like a break in! I haven’t heard anything!”
“We aren’t going to ravage each other right now. There’s something I’ve wanted to do, and only had seconds to do so days ago.”
Looking at his best friend, John grew serious. His doctor eyes roamed over the tightness around Sherlock’s eyes. Taking in the subtle twitches in Sherlock’s hands. The rather grey-sickly looking complexion compared to a healthy pale.
“I didn’t hear that,” mumbled Lestrade. He tossed a file at John, who caught it easily. Sherlock hovered over his shoulder as they flicked through it. Photographs. Sherlock cursed softly. “Blue.”
‘Before everything’, meant John’s own mistakes of marrying a woman he barely knew, blinded by the heartache that Sherlock had left him behind. He felt untrusted, unwanted, and deep down, back then, he knew that was the reason why he married her – spite Sherlock, to cover up weaknesses he will never admit to. His hands fisted Sherlock’s suit jacket, probably ruining the sleek lines with the indentions of his fingernails. He didn’t care.
To his surprise, Mary lowered her gun with a sigh. “Because only one person in this entire world is allowed to kill Sherlock Holmes. Anyone else tries or does, without his direct orders, answers to him.”
John retorted breathlessly, mirth echoed in his voice. He flickered his eyes down, motioning to his toes barely touching the floor. “Is that what you’re trying to do? It seems like you are trying to decapitate me instead.”
He bit the inside of his cheek, mind still whirling on the fact that he was missing a full day of his life. John glared at Sherlock, making the detective roll his eyes. “I will tell you about your missing Saturday. Just go get the gloves while I gather the samples.”
He wouldn’t send Harry a bottle of temptation just because he was irritated at her. Although, there was a difference about not getting along with your sibling verses your sibling invading your privacy. And John wasn’t Mycroft’s brother, thank god for that. The doctor in him knew there was a difference between being an alcoholic, or a drug user compared to liking a pastry a bit too much. But still, it wasn’t kind to set someone up for failure, no matter how much they are a prick.
Glowering at Sherlock, John murmured. “I don’t care about finding leads. I’m a bloody doctor; I know the different between ‘taking’ and ‘using’, Sherlock. You are using drugs…” he paused, and hummed again before continuing lowly, -“you don’t need them to be brilliant, fantastic or any other way I’ve described you...how have you…I should have seen the signs.”
Problem? Sherlock’s voice echoed through his head as much as the word sex did. The question or problem, here, was how could John explain himself without sounding like a complete nutter? There was an unreasonably attractive man in front of him, propositioning him for sex like it was an every day occurrence. Much like rain in London.
Good thing the water was going on the chilly side, cooling his body temperature down, keeping his erection in check.
The detective inspector nodded, and grinned. “I’ll let Myc know, it’s difficult to be infatuated with them. They can make you all sorts of mental. I’m going to be late if I don’t get going. Pints on you next time.”
Something that John couldn’t name flashed over Sherlock’s face before he stood up. The detective walked over to his chest of drawers. John watched as Sherlock paused, staring at his expensive shirts as if there was something fascinating. John partly wondering If Sherlock could deduce things from his own clothing as he did with others.
“Oh god,” John utter lowly when Sherlock kissed, worshipped at the circle of his scar where the bullet cut through, and almost killed him. It brought him home as a shell of the man he was. No longer was he a soldier, or an army doctor. He was nothing until… here, now; in the arms of the man who gave him a purpose, a war, which gave him life again. In his sight was a man, lovingly caressing John’s shameful wound. John trembled against the significance that Sherlock touching his shoulder as his ‘all-in’ was more intimate than any of his experiences with past lovers.
“Oh John! Mmpphhhh!" Sherlock held his breath for a good four seconds when he came, spurting streaks of cum up along his stomach, chest, and even got a few drops onto John’s arm beside his face.
John didn’t stick around for long. He followed the distinctive coattails walking down the pavement. He jogged to catch up. When he joined Sherlock’s side, he murmured. “You know, Greg would have given us a ride to the Yard.”
“She did say that she gave you and your detective boyfriend the flash drive after she had shot him. Also said that you torched it in a fireplace, bad move on your part.”
A wriggle made the doctor snort and rubbed his palms around Sherlock’s leaking cock, obviously teasing. Sherlock wouldn’t have any of that which he then quickly remedied the situation with his pale hand wrapped around his own length, about to stroke himself hard and fast, chasing to orgasm…
John’s forehead smashed into Moran’s chest as Moran took the brunt of the tackle, landing on the tar road with a wheezed groan. Good because John still used the skills from his old rugby days. Tackling criminals was something he was very well versed- in; thanks to the Work he did with Sherlock. John scrambled up Moran’s body, getting leverage to deliver a punch. But he paused at the stunned look on Moran’s face, and the man’s arms uselessly sprawled on the road.
“Good,”- John inhaled deeply, recalling what he really wanted to say after the cab ride before he got too distracted with his newly rediscovered attraction for Sherlock. Before the temptation to touch completely overshadowed the conversation he needed to have with the man before him. Whatever expression that was on his face made Sherlock sigh loudly.
“You’ll find out soon enough, John,” replied Mary with a light smile as she walked to the door. That smile was something that didn’t settle well with John. “I have a call to make. AJ, stay with them.”
“The last I heard from her, they were going to dinner…you know…trying to work things out. I haven’t heard from her since.” Brown eyes tracked between John and Sherlock. “Will you help me?”
John stood up from the edge of the hospital bed. His hands parked on his hips and he pointed at Sherlock with a disapproving frown. “I’m not forging paperwork.”
Sighing, John reiterated what he could remember from his conversation with Mycroft. He licked his bottom lip, stared out into the fireplace on the flickering embers, dying but still illumined the floor around.  He was now tempted to get that drink he brushed off earlier, while recalling that Sherlock’s jump from Bart’s rooftop. They had both gone through hell, and after the whole ordeal, he was going to tell Sherlock that the man who drove him to ‘fall’ might still be alive.
A lone candle was a beckon through the crowd. After many apologies for bumping into multiple bodies, John finally made it to the table. It was smaller than their usual booth in front, which was currently occupied by a group of seven. John licked his lips, wondering how two grown men could share it. His heart started pounding as it did before in the bloody cab to get here. Sharing a space with Sherlock seemed to jump-start every nerve in his body. John shed his coat at an alarming speed. He was tempted to yank his favorite tan jumper off over his head just to get some cooling reprieve.
“Oh? Did we? I must have missed that part of the conversation while you were gone, it’s difficult to talk about baby names when you’ve been wherever the fuck you have been the last two months, Mary.”
With great timing or luck, Angelo returned to their table with their orders. It smelled heavenly. John’s stomach turned, desperate for his first meal since the apple he had eaten earlier this morning before his shift at the clinic. John devoured his order eagerly. As he chewed he watched Sherlock eat. It was enlightening; a rare sight that showed Sherlock was human and not devoid of human needs. Even though he had witnessed Sherlock’s human side more than once, most of the time it was a battle to get him to eat one bite, especially on a case. Here, now, Sherlock was taking one bite after another like he couldn’t get enough. The candlelight reflected in Sherlock’s eyes, and undetectable to anyone but John, there was tiredness. Something nagged at the back of his head, the doctor part of him when he sees a patient; John cleared his throat.
Then she sighed, and went back to AJ on the floor. John watched as Mrs. Hudson yanked off AJ’s shoe before throwing it over her shoulder in favour of the knife that fell out of it. Then she flicked open the knife and started at John’s ropes.
He turned to Sherlock, who studied Molly with a disgruntled expression that was usually reserved for his brother. John glanced over to Molly. She pulled the bloodied gloves from her hands and started threading her fingers through her brunette ponytail. John was a bit more confused than he wanted to admit. And proud of Molly for having an evening to herself after her engagement with ‘look-alike’ or Tim…or whatever his name was fell out. God, he was becoming Sherlock. Nevertheless, Molly deserved to find some happiness. John cleared his throat.
Peter brightened. John saw his blue eyes roam over him just as Sherlock’s did. Luckily, John didn’t flush under the gaze, not like he had with that overgrown idiot. Thank Christ for that. Instead, it was Peter who seemed to flush under his attention. It was then that he realized how exactly he was the diversion and why Sherlock made him take off his jumper.
“Where are the mobile numbers?” Sherlock asked hastily. Large hands fixed on his shoulders, rooting him in place. John knew that familiar tone, it was the very same one that Sherlock had when he thought of a breakthrough on a case. John shrugged his shoulders; Sherlock’s hands heavy underneath.
The tone of Molly’s voice made him pause before leaving the clinic through the double set of doors. It was a firmness that he didn’t normally hear from her. “Yeah?”
“Perhaps, I didn’t want big brother and the rest of MI6 tracking us down before I could make the trade.”
John cleared his throat, and stepped into the kitchen, placing the medical kit gently on the table. Sherlock’s face up jerked to watch him. His nimble fingers pulled at his shirt, fixing the buttons through the buttonholes in haste. John snorted.
John grinned and sat on the edge of the bed, avoiding getting rammed by the railing. Sherlock’s larger hands perched between his, pale fingers danced in the shelter of John’s hands. “Yes. I know you and you know me. What did he want?”
“Right then, well there was no sign of struggle, or kidnapping at the flat, which makes sense because they weren’t killed there. The door was locked until the landlord checked in on them. So, out of leads there. What did you notice about forensics, Sherlock? I need something, anything.”
The camera nudged a little, as if the person behind it was encouraging Mr. Hageman. The voice was a bit uneven, reminded John of someone talking with his or her mouth full. There was a sound of a flick, and smoke drifted into the frame. Whoever it was, they smoked.
Then Sherlock closed the distance. John protested against the insisting mouth. His hand shoved at Sherlock’s shoulder. Breathlessly, John broke away and fled, squeezing himself close to the other side of the cab as he could go. His mouth buzzed from the contact. His body craved for more. There was a hum of lust under his skin, along with anger. His eyes roamed over Sherlock’s smug face.
The only sound he could hear was the steady beat of his heart.  John turned into the nearest doorway, casting light in the shadows, highlighting the corners. He found a room with storage boxes thrown haphazardly around. It seemed like they were either packing away their things or bringing them out of storage. John couldn’t tell, but he knew if Sherlock had been here, the detective would’ve known. Hell, he probably would have been able to deduce if someone was still in the house.
“That very one,” answered Lestrade with a nod as John moved to close the refrigerator with his shoulder. Instead, a long leg kicked past him, snapping the door shut. The bottles rattled inside. John moved to the counter. He glanced over at Sherlock, “Countertops clean? Pots and pans too?”
John matched the pace, fucking into the channel of their hands interwoven around their cocks. Between the moans, John moved one hand from Sherlock’s hip, and behind. Stroking, teasing a finger up and down the line of his buttock. John broke the kiss, and whispered over Sherlock’s lips.
There was a snort and the huff of laughter. “It applies to the bloody both of you now. It’s hard enough to get everyone to cooperate with Sherlock. Well, tolerate him at least. Don’t need two of him.” Then Lestrade stood, and drained the rest of his cup. He waved to the door. “I should be getting back. I needed a break-”
“Making jokes. But that’s not what I meant. You’re bloody gorgeous.” He whispered. His left hand brushed over a sculpted cheekbone. He was tempted to place a kiss on those lips. He had always been tempted, and there would never be a day where he wasn’t. They would old and grey together, and he’ll still want. Instead of closing the distance, John licked his bottom lip, hoping to dull the yearning. He cleared his throat and continued; he had to get this out before he was completely drawn away like a sailor lured by song.
“I don’t want only to be seduced by your looks, Sherlock. You posing on my bed was amazing. Your promise of sex and pleasure is tempting but that’s not all I want.”
Instead it was a close up a young man, with frightened wide eyes, tape over his mouth, and tied to a chair- or John assumed he was, judging from how the young man wasn’t getting up and running. A sunglass-clad man perched behind the chair with a cigarette hung from his lip, and a hand fixed on the tied man’s head. The light hung above them, John could see the gleam of metal in the man’s other hand. A knife? A gun?
John mentally counted up the seventeen steps as he climbed them. He felt Sherlock venturing behind him as a dark, silent shadow. Clenching his hands into a fist, he hung them to his side like a soldier, ready and at attention. He braced for the fallout and the news that he thought Sherlock was going to deliver. He wasn’t going without a fight. Back then when Moriarty was a threat, he had decided to be on Sherlock’s side, figuratively. Now, it wouldn’t be any different except he was going to be there, physically, utterly and completely. He wouldn’t let Sherlock cast him away even with this new development. This ‘Trap’ as Sherlock had said. A trap, for what? For who? Either way, he was here. Even if he had to handcuff himself to Sherlock, he will make sure of that.
Silence followed behind Moriarty’s words. Holding up the gun to aim was making John’s shoulder strain, adding to the pain from the car crash, being tied in a wooden chair, and the activities that he had gotten into with Sherlock… that being the least he minded, and being on the list of more than willing to repeat. Damn shoulder and all. But this, standing before Moriarty with a gun, whatever this standstill was, it needed to end.
Sherlock’s hands moved away from John’s shoulder. The long, elegant digits sank into inky dark curls as Sherlock stepped away to pace barefoot across the floor. John observed the motions, watched for any differences in breathing in case Sherlock had another ‘not panic’ panic attack. “Talk to me, Sherlock!”
Lestrade’s face was grim, sinking John’s hope as the DI replied, “Stabbed in heart like the other two. I may not look it, but I sometimes do listen when Sherlock says something.”
From the corner of his eyes, John noticed Kitty, and immediately slowed down while staring at her, seeing red. She was still working as a reporter after all that nonsense she pulled?  John could not hold Sherlock’s hand anymore tighter than he possibly could, even upon seeing her. He muttered the mantra of ‘no comment’ over and over again as he pulled Sherlock into the Yard.
He opened his mouth to counter Mycroft, but his jaw snapped shut, completely taking in what Mycroft had said. Siblings: plural, not sibling. Not even plain Sherlock. John studied over the older Holmes. He may not be as smart as both Mycroft and Sherlock, but by normal standards, he wasn’t an idiot. He was pretty damn smart. Mycroft’s expression was flat, very much like the nickname of iceman. Nothing could penetrate the surface, or moreover below it, but that wasn’t true at all. Greg, and somehow, Molly seemed to have broke through the façade. Time to use that information to the advantage, just like Mycroft would. Or even, ‘The Woman’, but John wasn’t going to talk about her.
John cast a glance to the CCTV perched on the nearest corner. It shook at him repeatedly like someone shaking ‘no’ with his or her head.
Sherlock snorted. “Perhaps I should…I know the perfect chemical mixture for someone his size and weight…”
John squeezed Mrs. Hudson’s hand, and whispered lowly over his shoulder without taking his eyes from the doorway, hoping that she could hear. “Wait here on my signal, and watch your back.”
“Ah! Speaking of that,” John muttered lowly, glancing to the door. “You should know that there’s a spot in the morgue that he’s found that allows him to overhear our conversations.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and whispered, “As you know, proposing to Janine was necessary to get through his security, and as you probably recall, the miscalculation in that plan didn’t end too well for me. Now, it is hardly necessary, and would do more damage in harassment, and attracting security than finding the schedules to make progress in this case. Besides,” he added as an afterthought, “I don’t have the ring anymore. I gave it to Mrs. Hudson.”
The detective sighed dramatically, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. To him, it probably was. “Only two reasons why couples do not wear their rings, marital disputes or cheating. There’s an indention on his finger, the ring has been recently removed. He told you boyfriend, instead of husband; I want to know why.”
“I know there are other ways to inject, Sherlock. I’m not going to ask you to tell me where. I trust you, but what made you…” John’s question trailed off. The flat fell quiet.
“Waited for a weakness,” finished the inspector, completely ignoring the other two men. John patted Lestrade’s shoulder sympathetically.
John snorted at the man’s sarcasm and followed with a frown. But he didn’t feel any pity. It was their choices that got them here in the first place. “I really don’t want to think about it,” he answered.
John asked lightly. “What exactly are my options, Mary? To shoot you or be shot… again? I can’t say I was fond of the first experience.”
“I held him off. I know how to fight, regardless what Mycroft thinks. I’m not helpless. I’ve mastered most hand-to-hand combat.”
“For me, and it was. I did not achieve an orgasm from it this time,” Sherlock countered darkly, his eyes flashed the same predatory look at John before his hands fixed on John’s belt. “But, let’s see how well you do. Don’t fall on me.”
“Tell brother mine that the real Mr. Moran did not escape from prison on my watch but never was incriminated. Unfortunately, I was…blindsided and a replacement had taken his place for his crimes.”
John absolutely did not like the sound of falling asleep. Yes, he was tired from the early morning crime scene and the two whacks on his head earlier didn’t help, but this was the opposite of sleep. He wasn’t sure if he should be aroused with Sherlock ordering him about. It would be quite a scene when they are out on a care, or when he ordered John to make him tea.
“What are you talking about? He’s right-” asked John, he nodded over his shoulder to where Sherlock was supposed to be standing right next to him.
It was then that Mary raised her gun at him, aiming over his heart again. “It is what it is, John. Rosemund needs to be safe. I will do anything to accomplish it. One half-done detective for an innocent new life.”
Sherlock hovered next to him by the doorway. He smiled at the detective, who somehow slipped on the blue dressing gown while John wasn’t looking. He had to have slipped it on between Mrs. Hudson’s tea drop-off and John’s hunting for Sherlock’s card. It was John’s favorite. How Sherlock knew was a mystery. John added that to his lists to ask Sherlock.
“His wellbeing means a greater deal more to me than his happiness. My people will handle Moriarty’s threat. Sherlock’s happiness is questionable…pleasing you isn’t the only habit he has, and I don’t wish for him to revisit those habits.”
Sherlock tilted his head back and forth as he answered. “Inkling here and there. Not exactly a priority if Moriarty might give us the answer. He meant to lure us in, and we are going to lure him out.”
John turned his head, finding Sherlock’s eyes closed, mouth slightly agape. It was then when the detective let out a soft snore and John shook his head. Unbelievable. He pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. And once more, John got up, slowly pulled his softened member out while holding onto the condom. After a quick knot and the condom properly disposed of, he fetched a flannel from the bathroom and gingerly tended to Sherlock.
“Yeah, it did. But that’s not all-,” Lestrade answered before his voice grew muffled, followed by a shout. “Don’t move the body! Get someone in here to take a damn picture of it!”
“Hungry?” John asked and stood up from the edge of the bed. He angled away from Sherlock to adjust himself quickly. Tight pants and trousers were troublesome when it came to matters below the belt. Kissing Sherlock was one of those things. He flipped his button down shirt over his shoulders, and straightened the wrinkles out of the front. John turned, carted his hand through Sherlock’s hair, and marvelled at the way that the detective’s eyes fluttered closed. John gave Sherlock a gentle kiss. “How about early take-out, maybe the curry stuff you liked last time?”
His name again and the ‘take me’. He’d hope that it was referring to taking the phone rather than whoever had planted it. Someone knew that he was going to be here. John hated that. Predicting his every move like he was some piece on a chessboard. He was a human being for god’s sake, not something predictable to be in someplace, at the right time, hours in advance. John stuffed the other note away, joining the first in the pocket.
“I’m hardly the first woman who has been able to carry a child. It doesn’t make me an invalid,” Mary snapped. “The three of us made it out, alright.”
When it was obvious AJ was finished talking, John broke the silence with a spiteful jab. “Your scar, one of the high bidders job gone wrong then?”
Sherlock leaned over him, hands shot out, fixing fingertips on the back of John’s neck, tickling at the small hairs. The touch sent shivers down John’s spine as Sherlock continued to speak. “They lived together, shared the same lipstick- not friends, but lovers. They were-”
“I haven’t done that since 6th form,” John panted, looking at Sherlock. The man wasn’t in any better shape than he was. “What happened to the idea of delayed gratification?”
She waved lightly in dismissal. John grinned at her. He returned the wave and continued down the hallway as Molly disappeared behind the closed door. Then he ran when the coast was clear. Hustling to get back to Sherlock’s side and know more about the case, to feel excitement pounding through his veins. His phone chimed in his pocket. He ignored it.
“Great times,” sighed Moriarty, almost as if he were reminiscing, maybe he was… John didn’t know. Then Moriarty nodded over to the people in the pool. “But no guns this time. They were entertainment for me while waiting for you and Sherlock but they didn’t even last twenty minutes. They’re the last piece of a message, and it’s required to solve the puzzle. Want to take a stab at what would be your prize?”
But that still didn’t stop Moran’s fist grazing against John’s cheek. A fresh wave of blood flooded into his mouth as skin meshed into teeth.
John smiled down the empty corridor. “A lead, apparently. There’s no stopping him with that. Shall we go see what he’s figured out?”
“Of course not, I’m an idiot compared to the two of you. But I’ve spent enough time around you to realise when you’re lying. He didn’t like being called out as a liar.”
A low groan escaped his lips. He placed his other hand on the bed. John held his head down and didn’t dare open his eyes, knowing if he met the intense stare, he would be lost.
“You are the worst kind of distraction, John. A very tempting one and within arms reach. I would gladly fall for this distraction but if I do, our discussion would lead elsewhere. Mycroft had more to say.”
He had expected to have a bit of a kip with Sherlock. After all this git had fell asleep after they had both finished, left John breathless, sweaty, covered with ejaculate and a ‘heavier than he looks’ detective still on top of him. He had rolled Sherlock over, carefully, so he wouldn’t land on the floor.
“Your wedding ring has been off for a matter of days. You had clothing packed away. You cycled to work under the pretenses of getting back into the shape you were in before entering a state of martial bliss but we both know that wasn’t quite true. You feel relieved, mostly, now that Mary is gone. You have been sleeping better the last two months compared to when you would come over the flat for ‘hanging out.’ As I informed you, I don’t make mistakes and on the rare occasion that I do, I learn. I refuse to lose you again, and I wish to pursue a relationship with you beyond friendship, ergo the intimacy of the kiss at the flat to demonstrate my intentions. Is that explanation enough for you?”
In twenty steps, they reached the landing. The door creaked slowly closed from the previous impact. John’s heart pounded in his chest, definitely wishing... He paused at the sight of his gun in Sherlock’s hand.
“No,” Lestrade replied gruffly. Stress and frustration easily passed over the static. The detective inspector then added, “Mr. Hageman was strangled in his cell. He recorded a message. I’m forwarding it to both of you. Hold on a tic.”
“Please spare me your standard bore of protest,” Sherlock countered with a wave of his hand. “There are many different definitions to describe one’s sexuality. You may not have found other men attractive, and your previous relationship with Sholto leaves the evidence that you do feel something. What? To what level of degree? I am uncertain because of the lack of data. I know that you’re attracted to me. I can reassure you that the attraction and fondness is mutual.”
John roamed his eyes over the criminal, estimating in his head the other man’s height Jack Ripper was only a wee bit taller than himself. Essentially, his wife would have found him unattractive as well. Oh, how badly John wanted to say that aloud, but he knew it was only going to make him look insecure. It wasn’t like John had turned into an insecure little baby at the mention of his height, but one can occasionally be sensitive about it.
“And if we don’t find anything?” asked John. Then there was a familiar twist in his abdomen. John covered it with his hands. The growling of his stomach drowned out Sherlock’s reply. Green-grey eyes narrowed at him.
Mycroft placed his empty cup on the tea tray, and stood, pulling his suit jacket down to straighten the wrinkles. John looked between each brother, wondering what that conversation was about.
The slight ‘pop’ of Sherlock’s lips made John jump, recalling ‘The Incident’ as he called it in his head. He pushed away from the counter, slowly migrated around the table to the hallway. “I’m going to take a bath then.”
He placed his key in the lock, climbed up the stairs, ready to eat the Indian food that he had been carrying since the car park. His appetite looked forward to it.  John was just ready to relax in the flat with Sherlock, kicking his feet up and watch a bit of trash television. He paused when he entered the flat, finding Greg hovering over papers on the floor, picking them up.
His heart pounded in his chest. Heat pooled into his lower body, reacting in a surprising fashion considering the source. He wasn’t gay, but his body reacted in ways that told him that the idea was fine. Oh, it was just fine. Just fine really. The hand that wasn’t occupied by the gun, reached for stability from the sticky floor. His hand landed on something warm, solid, and it jumped underneath his touch. John glanced down, finding his hand on Sherlock’s thigh. John fought every urge to glance over at Sherlock, wondering if…
John accidently bit his tongue and held his breath when traffic started to part, and the car wedged between narrow spaces growing at a rapid speed. When the car was free from traffic, the view outside began to blur. John knew that they were in a rush but Christ! He didn’t want to die. Lestrade’s madman driving skills may be the end of him. He should not mention this to Sherlock and give the detective the satisfaction of being right about his deductions on Lestrade’s driving.
Together, in perfect synchronization, they both bolted through the sea of green and blue tables, made a dash for behind the bar as a light flickered on. It barely illuminated the entire pub. Liquor bottles rattled when their backs hit against the bar. John grabbed his gun from his back, steadily waiting for the ambush.
John rolled his eyes. “Don’t remind me, Sherlock is a magnet for all trouble. Where do you want us first? I’ll tell him when he’s out.”
Moran spat on the ground. “You don’t get it, do you? I owe him. This life, killing people, not exactly what I signed on for when I asked him for a favour. I’m his until my debt is paid.”
As John opened his mouth to protest that they don’t need wine, the restaurant owner disappeared with another grin. He danced around the crowd, his white shirt vanishing into the kitchen. His booming voice carried through out the restaurant. John turned back to Sherlock. His brow furrowed together as he remarked.
“Not your first time tying someone up?” he asked, thinking that she was a widow of a drug dealer, and had said that this wasn’t her first kidnapping.
“Right,” remarked John with a slight nod, feeling a more than disappointed he didn’t know the truth…or the alternate truth in this case. Then he patted Sherlock’s bandaged hands.
There was another struck of pain over his brow. John fell to his knees with a wave of dizziness.  Then there was a smack on the back of his head, bringing him to the ground on all fours. He knew the lights he saw were from his head, but this was not the time to worry about it…yet.
“Interrogation? An interview? A friendly chat? Take your pick. You were the one who asked for an audience. I’m free to leave at any given time unlike yourself, though murdering three people does that.”
John arched his eyebrow when Mycroft looked down at him with his large nose. Like he was trying to remind John that he was a peon, a goldfish, in a rather immense world. He knew that look, at least a similar version of it, where Sherlock was mentally calling him an ‘idiot.’ It usually meant that John did something or noticed something that he shouldn’t have, or he was in danger. It had to be the latter. Mycroft wasn’t trying to kill him, a jolt of shock crossed over his features. A sliver of the iceman’s expression flashed panic within his eyes. John only saw it for a second, but it was enough.
“Sherlock-” John warned lowly after making sense of the quickly mouthed words because as far as he knew, the ‘Jefferson Hope’ sniper was never found and the case was still open even after all of these years.
The chair creaked under Sherlock’s weight when he shifted forward towards the table. John resisted telling Sherlock not too move to close to the criminal, but the urge was still there, broiling as the ‘Jack Ripper’ leaned even closer. He wanted to meet Sherlock’s eyes when Jack grinned boldly, almost pleased with himself now that he had Sherlock interested.
If Moran strangled him, John would lose everything before he got to Moriarty. Sherlock would be the only option left for the psychopath.
“We both know that Mycroft is a diplomat,” he whispered, his eyes stared into Sherlock’s grey-green pair of eyes. “I’m not. I’ll break your arms if I have to.”
“But Merry Mollet didn’t have any known siblings,” argued Lestrade. “Her family history is her file.” The DI pulled away from Sherlock’s shoulder, moving to the cream-colored files on the end of the cluttered desk. -“Confirmed only child of Martha and Andrew Mollet, both died in a car crash when she was ten. Jumped around in the system until she was legal.”
“Baker Street!” he yelled at the cabbie as he slammed the door shut. The cabbie grumbled at him for his rudeness, but the car rejoined the busy traffic.
Paperwork flew into the air, raining down over their heads as Sherlock joined them, ranting as he went. “The foliage found at the first crime scene disintegrated during analyzing. The traces that were miraculously rescued tested as paper! Paper! What kind of morons do you have in that lab?”
John would have found his protest more believable if Sherlock’s cheekbones didn’t burst into a full blush. He shrugged innocently. He hadn’t meant for Sherlock fall down. To rile him up a bit, yes. Injured, no.
“Sherlock. Let me help you, alright? And what did you mean you won’t need much preparation? I don’t want to hurt you just because you’re rushing to get penetra--”
All they could hear was each other’s loud breathing. A surge of relief washed through John when Sherlock carded his fingers through his greying-blond hair. Slowly, he closed his eyes, letting himself relax.
An exaggerated sigh from the kitchen carried through the air. “Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Hudson, no matter how predictable it may be-”
He climbed to his feet and Peter hovered by his side, undoubtedly thinking that John was going to fall down. John snorted and rubbed the sore spot again.
“And you’re completely underestimating the possibility of one because you don’t wish to cause panic.”
This time, the worry was familiar, in the older sibling protectiveness. It was very same worry that John had felt with Harry, when she would bring new girlfriends home. He snorted, and laughed. John couldn’t help it, knowing now what he was on the receiving end of.
He walked closer to the man, close enough to be sure the second bullet would do the job that the first one didn’t. He didn’t aim for the head, but aimed for the heart. It had to be in Moriarty’s chest. Then perhaps, he would put another one in the head.
“Won’t?” Scoffed Donovan. “You’re damn right I won’t. He’s a witness and I’m finally getting somewhere with him. I got his name, we can start with a backgr-“
Lestrade sighed. “I can’t argue with you, Sherlock. But I also can’t agree with you. Just…if you don’t mind, could you look over the Pruit and Mollet case? If I hear anything from my superiors about the Izard case, I’ll let you know. They just want this to get quieted down because of all the bad press.”
John watched through the blue surface, the rising bubbles as the gleam of dark eyes disappeared forever. It only took seven minutes, but it was the most satisfying seven minutes in John’s life, knowing that the biggest threat between himself and Sherlock is now gone, forever.
Then another person followed through the open doorway. Him, John didn’t know or recognise, and he would have remembered someone with a vivid scar, such as the one on the man’s left cheek. The man leaned against the wall, arms folded across his chest. Apparently, he wasn’t running this show. John turned back to his ‘used-to-be wife’.
Judging from that infliction, it was too small to be a plain gunshot. John had seen a spread of gunshot wounds, this injury seemed too…he didn’t know how explain it, but gunshot wasn’t right. It seemed messier, or should have been with the amount of blood staining the victim’s back. John glanced over to Sherlock. He cringed slightly, finding the taller man working on the first victim with his small magnifying glass, digesting clues with his eyes whilst taking pictures with his mobile, and putting the puzzle together with his genius mind. Not to mention, sniffing the body. Before John could even protest about the ‘not good’ bit, Sherlock stood, then immediately sprang to John’s side, looking over the second victim with as much precision as the first.
“Moriarty’s only weakness, or so he said, was his ability to change his mind. He had done it once at the pool. He had done it just now with my death threat and Issac Spoo. He’ll do it again, I’m certain of it.”
John stuffed the note in his pocket, and went down the corridor. He glanced through the open front door, almost expecting to get caught out. No one was paid any attention, including Lestrade. He was busy calling orders to the other two officers. He snuck by, flitting up the stairs. No one would see John, stealing evidence. That was a job mostly reserved for Sherlock. He also mentally promised himself that he wouldn’t make a habit of it.
John glanced at Sherlock, allowing his eyes to roam over the man in the bright lab lighting. “Yeah, I’m looking at him now.”
As John approached 221B Baker Street, he spotted a familiar woman, and the familiar car that she was leaning against parked on the street in front of the door.
Disclaimer: I don't own BBC Sherlock, or any other variations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters.
“I think we like it up here,” countered the suspect with a laugh and a small dance. The uneven footing made John nervous and he cringed, fighting his urge to tackle the man down, and help the baby that so desperately wanted to return back to its mother. To a person offering warmth, comfort, and home. He took another tiny step towards the ledge when the suspect wasn’t paying attention.
When Sherlock finally stopped, John glanced over the other crime scene possibility. White bricks reflected the sun like snow. Shutters were bright blue, unlike the usual sky in London. Rainbow lights flickered in the upper frame of the large bay windows and were the only light source within the darkened pub. John didn’t bother reading over the business hours this time. Instead he followed Sherlock as he rounded the corner of the building hidden away from the main street. John grabbed the door handle and jiggled it. It was locked.
“I hardly know of your efforts compared to your namesake. Jack the Ripper had killed more than three, and without a gun.”
John followed Sherlock into the corridor half- expecting to get caught escaping. But as they headed for the lifts, there wasn’t even a holler. They walked by two nurses, and a mum with a young child, who stared at Sherlock and tugged on his mum’s skirt for her attention. The boy did not get it. John spared the child a little wave, earning a frown from the boy instead.
“It would’ve gone faster if you would’ve told me to flirt with him,” John countered back in annoyance. He yanked his jumper back over his head, quickly fixing the buttons on his collar. “You didn’t have to punch me.”
John looked over, finding Sherlock’s face a sickly shade of grey, and very much matching how John felt himself. He felt cold creeping underneath his skin, even with all of his layers of winter clothing over him. John wondered if Sherlock felt that way as well. They needed additional security and to be safe. Hell, they just needed to get away, as far away, as quickly as possible from Moriarty and his twisted mind. Maybe a vacation in Switzerland would suffice.
If he could have, John would probably have died from heat stroke caused by his embarrassment, at being caught out by Sherlock. He could try to explain that it was only the particulars of bodily functions in the morning if he didn’t know already that it would be a waste of time. Instead, he looked down at the owner of those limbs, that voice, and the question. Pale opal eyes stared up, a dark eyebrow arched at him. John cleared his throat, trying to chase the morning roughness away. “How long have you been awake?”
Peeking through the doorway, John found Sherlock in the same position. Still pouting, balled up on the couch. “You know, if you’re bored, do some experiments, you have body parts in the fridge, play your violin at obnoxious hours or shot the walls again. You are creative, think of some way to entertain yourself other than the drugs.”
While he was still trying to process what happened, the ropes loosened, and he pulled free. He rubbed his wrist once before giving Mrs. Hudson a hug. “You’re amazing, Mrs. Hudson.”
“I know Sherlock will step aside once Mrs. Watson and the baby are recovered safe and sound. Do you truly think that he knows, with utter certainty, the depth of your feelings once Mary returns?” Mycroft asked with a grimace. “Once your daughter is born?”
He gave Mrs. Hudson the mobile with Sherlock’s voice still calling for him. It took everything he had to walk away and not turn back, heading for the door. “Mycroft’s people will be here soon to take you back to Baker Street, Mrs. Hudson. Mary… do make sure your leg is seen to and have a nice life.”
His lungs burned, thighs too, as they pursued the suspect up the stairwell. Their heavy breathing echoed off the plain concrete walls. His feet ached from the repeated solid impact of the concrete stairs. John used the safety rail to pull forward, giving him the increased momentum he needed to keep up with Sherlock. The baby’s helpless frightened cries blurred with Sherlock’s yelling from four steps ahead of him. John fixed on the figure dressed in black, not daring to take his eyes off of the person underneath the black mask in case they vanished. If John could bore a hole in the back of the individual’s head, he would, just get the mother’s tear-streaked face and haunting cries for her baby’s return out of his mind.
John closed his eyes for a minute. There was a loud groan, and he was pretty sure that obscene sound came from him.
John let up, giving a bit of slack. The purple disappeared to a red when Moran gulped down air like a drowning man to water. Music trailed into the air, making the harsh breathing of both men vanish.
John shook his head. “Not a problem with that, no. Slightly off -putting that you’re pleased with death threats.”
John snorted at Sherlock’s grin. “Contain your excitement, Sherlock. You’re worrying the cabbie. Let’s just get to the crime scene before you get us kicked out of here and then we really do have to walk in the rain.”
John’s eyes widened. He shook his head and he waved his hand. “No, no, no, no, Sherlock. I should apologize, I didn’t mean to…” he trailed off. The words ‘touch you’ were on his lips, wanting to leave. John couldn’t. Not yet. Instead he cleared his throat. “It’s fine. It’s all fine, like you said, it was unexpected that’s all.”
John shook his head, forgoing his remark about the suit. Nothing could ruin the line of the suit on Sherlock. On other’s, maybe. Or point out the fact that Sherlock carries his mobile around, and that doesn’t ruin the line either.
Surprisingly, his gold wedding band was still by the tap. John picked it up between his forefinger and his thumb, conflicted over the span of emotions that churned through his head. He was married, is married to a wife that was missing. Sherlock kissed him. He was married. He cheated on his wife. Sherlock kissed him. He returned it with vigor. What the hell? What would happen if Mary were to suddenly reappear into his life?
There was a shadow in the doorway. Greg stood, his hands in the air, his mouth moving slowly. Every motion of Greg’s body language radiated caution, and placating behaviour. Maybe a bit of surprise or a lot of surprised. John easily put the pieces together.
He glanced over his shoulder, meeting Sherlock’s eyes. “I’m not going anywhere smelling like your posh cologne and linens. People would talk.”
“I did-” Sherlock whispered. Sherlock’s hands pulled John upwards, and closer. Sherlock’s lips stopped at hairbreadth apart from his own. Lips brushed against each other when Sherlock continued. “But wouldn’t allow myself to see it until you did.”
Sherlock closed the distance between them again, grabbing the mobile and notes from the bed. Sherlock stuffed the items into his belstaff before pausing in front of John with a pleased grin. “But it is interesting. My reaction doesn’t count for anything, and with the death threats it can only be one thing.”
“What did you talk about?” John repeated evenly. There was a squeak from the other side of the phone, followed by static.
“And planning fixes around my schedule and getting high might have something to do with it,” John added to inform Greg, so the DI could also be on ‘Team Clean’ with him, Mycroft, and Molly. Sherlock sighed when Lestrade glared at him. “Yes, John, but that’s not important. What is important is just how did Sebastian Moran escaped prison.”
“So what you’re saying is, that Moran has been out there, the whole time?” John questioned, his eyes met Sherlock’s when the detective snapped to attention. “For as much as you boost about your connections, Mycroft, you really should check your employees. I’d recommend paying them more.”
“That was one of my questions, yes. Another is, where were you going to meet Moriarty for the trade?”
It took the detective two tries then Sherlock responded in a raspy voice. “ Terrible idea. I waited. We didn’t have penetrative sex so that was the delayed gratification. Not good?”
“It is still early to be using past tense considering my brother’s supplies were only surrendered days ago. By evidence, he didn’t start again until after your-”
John jumped as he opened the bottled water, splattering over the newspaper, his hands, and trousers. His eyes flickered between Sherlock, who had his hands fixed underneath his chin, his eyes closed in his usual thinking pose, and the water all over the place.
In order to get his questions answered, John needed to be at the hospital. At this rate, it seemed like he was never going to get there. Hopefully Sherlock wasn’t being completely intolerable, if so, John would’ve received a call on his mobile by now. He pulled his mobile from his pocket. Nothing. No missed calls or text messages. Thinking of Sherlock, and of calls, John pulled the now-considered-ancient flip phone from his pocket. Blue light from the time blended in with the streetlight flickering in and out of the cab.
“Something’s missing,” Sherlock rambled. His fingers jumped in a sporadic dance against his mouth. Then his green eyes widened and he turned towards Molly. “Personal effects…are they still here or did those forensic idiots defile them too?”
Sherlock sighed, like their questions were physically taxing him. “Did you both not hear what I said? She could be dead, but he’s mixed up his past and present tenses, and he said he wouldn’t help us ‘save that bitch’. Why would she need saving if she was already dead? An obvious giveaway that she isn’t dead yet. Maybe there was some kind of signal that he was waiting for, in order to know that the deed was done. So, no, she’s not currently dead as far as he knows.”
A/N: So, I'm having a bloody awful crap day! I decided to update it hopes that it would make me feel better. Please give love, kindness, and kudos. And don't forget to thank whitehart, who mostly provided the 'mmm' in smut. And yell at me for ending the way I did.
Two hard knocks rapped on the door, and before John could reply, it creaked open and the inspector’s voice called out into the flat. “John? Sherlock?”
The detective drew back with a visible flinch, grey eyes rolled, and his mouth moved into a frown before talking in silence again. John tracked the movement, picking up the words, ‘loud’, ‘deaf’ and ‘gun’. Sherlock’s mouth moved again, John only assumed that Sherlock was calling him an idiot or something of the sort.
Moran’s voice came from the dark screen, “If you’re as smart as he thinks you are, Sherlock Holmes, you’ve already realised he’s the killer of the Mollet case I presented to you. Now start at the beginning. We’ll be in touch.”
It seemed his question went unnoticed as Sherlock muttered lowly. “The fingertips were tilted up, not down, not made by their own hands, or the killer’s if grabbed from behind. It would have to be…oh, obvious!”
John watched as Sherlock’s eyes roamed over him. The detective’s face softened as it always did when it was just the two of them in the flat. “Yes.”
John bit his tongue about the news while on their way to New Scotland Yard, instead he had listened to Sherlock, as the detective explained that there was no way to prove the ID-less jumper was indeed Oliver Izard’s killer, or even related to the other two victims. Sherlock was on a case, buried in The Work, the evolution of their ‘relationship’ could wait. It had to wait. John nodded here and there as Sherlock expounded that the dirt placed the jumper at the scene. It also didn’t help that the jumper was, in fact, at the scene while they were there. But blood, no murder weapon, not even latex gloves could actually conclude that the jumper killed Oliver Izard. The best chance to connect the jumper to the crime was the footage of the video cameras located inside, and around the block of flats. They have been cooped up in Greg’s office for at least one hour, if not more, watched through the first video from inside the upper class lobby. After deciding there was nothing suspicious throughout the footage, they moved on the footage for the outside the lobby.
“I had a suspicion. You’re handsome and quite intelligent. He didn’t react when I first entered the room.”
Sherlock smiled before crowding into John’s space. The doctor’s mouth was captured and covered immediately. When the kiss broke, Sherlock whispered against his lips.
Moran shrugged, and glanced away for a moment, clearly stating without words exactly what he thought of John and of John’s plan. Moran huffed, sending dregs of smoke out from his nose. “Well, going solo probably wasn’t the way to do it. Too late now, toss the gun and let’s go.”
John sighed and shook his head. He might as well as get out with it. It would be helpful to have someone on his side to convince Mycroft to tell Sherlock everything. It can be another version of ‘Team Clean’ instead of drugs for Sherlock; it would be information for Mycroft.
He walked away before he could hear whether the cabbie said something else. Swiftly, he unlocked the door and walked down to Mrs. Hudson’s flat. “Mrs. Hudson? Are you there?”
John laughed harder. Tears formed at the corners of his eyes. “I thought you were leading us into danger…again!” John leaned against the wall again and threw an arm over his face, giggles still poured out from his lips. “Oh Christ…I thought we would have to listen to them shag.”
He left the bedroom, and was greeted by Lestrade at the bottom of the stairwell. The other two officers walked by him, headed into the kitchen where the body was. There was a frown on Lestrade’s face, and not his usual ‘this is a difficult case’ frown, but like the ‘barer of bad news’ frown.
John cleared his throat. His eyes flickered between Sherlock’s eyes, and the frown of Sherlock’s lips. He knew Sherlock well enough, better than most people do. Well… to be precise, John knew Sherlock intimately, having lived with Sherlock in close proximity longer than anyone else to know when sulk was coming, or what karate-chopping the fridge meant. Knew him intimately as of recently, physically how Sherlock felt under his hands, but still this question seemed to mean something else.
Instantly, he was smacked with the scent of chlorine and a wave of heat when he stepped inside. His mind supplied another flash of memories, the weight of semtex, the little annoying voice buzzing in his ear, and the look on Sherlock’s face when John had walked out of the dressing room, and the proper meeting of two men that John had gotten in the middle of.
“Well, that’s the way it’s going now. There’s no light. No Sherlock. It’s come down to you and me here Moriarty. One of us is dying tonight, or both if that’s what it takes. But you’re not allowed to come back from the dead a second time.”
He didn’t want to mention Moriarty or explain that someone had broken into their flat. Or explain that it was the first time that John had grabbed his gun since returning to Baker Street. While he was with Mary, his night shooting had gotten progressively worse. Her solution was to take his gun away, and complained about his lack of self-control. Ironically enough, John felt more in control of himself with the hard metal in his hand rather than without it. It was probably stress that made him react in his sleep from nightmares of the war. Or the stress of this case that kept building and building and, eventually everything was going to crumble. Including him and Sherlock. He was waiting for everything normal to fall to pieces, to be thrown into chaos. John chose not to elaborate, and thankfully Lestrade understood his silence for his unwillingness to explain further.
“You,” Sherlock reiterated in annoyance, leaning against the wooden desk, flashing John a spectacular amount of pale thigh in the dim room. “Have to be in there to catch the suspect; you’ll be posing as one of the students.”
“Are you ever going to elaborate why I’m here? Because I really don’t have time for waiting around. Your brother is expecting take-out, and I prefer it warm. So, it’s either say why I’m in this car, or pull over. I don’t fancy having a chat in an abandoned warehouse halfway across London…again.”
John could feel himself gaping; chin hitting the floor gaping. He walked over the edge of his bed before he could fall ass over tit. “What-”
Sunlight still sparkled through the window, throwing an array of rainbow colors across the floor between them. John followed Sherlock into the other room as the taller man clamored into his large coat, and knotted the scarf around his neck.
John snorted. He must have yelled that last bit. “Sorry about that, yeah, my hearing is a bit gone.”
A/N: I want to thank my beta englandwouldfalljohn(The Lady Althaea). This story is still coming, and enter 'the typical busy excuse here'. Sorry! Just hang in there.
Well, hearing that from Sherlock did sting a bit more than John would have liked it to. He knew it himself, but hearing it aloud from an outside perceptive was completely different. John cleared his throat. “Even so, before anymore repeats of what happened in the flat-”
The consulting detective sat down, his fingers fixed under his chin for a moment before suddenly springing back to his feet. He bolted out Lestrade’s office and down the hallway. John shared a look with the inspector, who sighed.
John exhaled, making his whole being sag against the cab seat. His eyes fell into his lap, where his hands rubbed on his thighs. “I don’t know what to say…I’m not…”
Jack unconsciously touched the skin around his ring finger where his wedding ring would be, and gave it a slight scratch. When he noticed Sherlock had paused to stare at his hands, he pulled them under the table. Sherlock turned a little more to face him straight on and continued.
Of course, he called Sherlock right away after discovering it. He watched as Sherlock roamed over the house with his studious eyes, taking in every detail as he could see them. In the end, John asked for Mycroft’s resources, while hearing endless complaints from Sherlock. Hoping with Sherlock’s mind and Mycroft’s connections, that they would discover something. Last night, they reached the latest lead. It seemed now that ‘Mary Watson’ was gone forever.
John was in the midst of making them breakfast, simple eggs and toast (again) when the sun finally broke through the sky. Bright yellow stream of light trickled through the windows, but the ghastly grey still shadowed over Sherlock’s features and had been there since the lab. John couldn’t help but notice the slight shivers of Sherlock’s hands when he adjusted the knobs. Even in the safety of their home, and Mycroft’s watchful eyes, something was still bothering Sherlock. Coldness followed them, like a ghost, sucking life out from the warmth of their safety net.
Shaking his head, John retorted as he walked to his bedroom, “It will take you longer than that to get ready yourself, Sherlock.” A slamming door was the only answer.
The remainder of Sherlock’s glass was downed in a second. “I’m returning to the flat. I need to think.”
Lestrade’s hand held the door shut when Sherlock tried to push it open. “You still need an officer in there with you to while you interview. I’ll go in with you, not negotiable. And I think you would prefer me over any other officers in this building.”
Right? Fair? Enough? John couldn’t finish talking. He was lost in the marbled map of Sherlock’s back, wondering what might have been different if he had been there. If he would’ve known Sherlock was alive…then maybe…
John nodded over the dark skinned man on the pavement next to the woman. “This one sustained three shots to the lower left quadrant. He bled out slowly, didn’t die from his wounds right away.”
The crowd in Angelo’s had thinned out over the course of their dinner, Sherlock quickly strode outside, waving his arm about to hail a cab. John hurriedly snatched his coat from the back of the chair and ran after him. He was stopped by Angelo and forced to be polite say goodbye and promising to return soon. The black cab pulled back into traffic once John got outside. He stood in the bitter London air alone. There was a tap on his shoulder. John turned around, surprised to see the blonde from the bar.
He tossed his coat on the back of the chair just as Angelo appeared with a grin on his face and two menus. John took them and sat down. His knees bumped into Sherlock’s. John jerked away, tucking his legs as closely to the wall as he could. He handed a menu to Sherlock. To his surprise, Sherlock took it and green eyes flickered over it.
“Sherlock…you’re doing that face again,” John muttered lowly, pinching the bridge of his nose, knowing that Sherlock would understand that pointing out ‘his annoying face’ meant that no one could comprehend him.
John breezed past Sherlock and ventured into the kitchen. Luckily, the medical kit was still there from yesterday. Mycroft had texted, informing him that he had disposed of Sherlock’s supplies while they were out. It saved John the trouble of doing it, even though he now had the yearning to break all of it himself into tiny little smithereens. He waved Sherlock in, pointing at the empty chair before rustling around in the medical kit for everything he needed.
The three bodies, two men, one woman laid facedown on the pavement before the skin club SophistiCats. The darkened black door easily blended in the night sky, sandwiched between a pub and a sex shop. The golden scroll reflected in the lamplight, mobile lights, and the random number of torches. The music beat from inside oozed through the building walls, drumming the bass over New Scotland Yarders, Sherlock and himself. The black awning over the club rattled and danced loudly with the beat. In his younger days, John would have worked his magic happily across the floor, but now, all he has is a headache. His body protested as he moved from his crouched position and pulled off his dirtied latex gloves He deposited them in the bin and walked to Lestrade, who was leaning on a red post near the black doorway.
John snapped the phone shut and tucked it away. “Yeah. I’m still here. I was checking to see if the vic was the wife.”
“I’m planning on it,” Lestrade retorted then started bellowing orders around the scene. He turned back to John. “Don’t let Sherlock talk to anyone until I get there. Especially the shooter.” Then Lestrade added, “Or Donovan.”
He watched as Sherlock turned away with a pleased expression and walked into bathroom, leaving the door open. The light flicked on. An obvious invitation and somewhere in the distance, John was pretty sure his jaw joined the sheet on the floor. Pipes rattled in the walls, he could hear the splashes of water, falling on the bottom of the porcelain.
Then John grabbed the steering wheel, yanking it with a hard turn, hoping the cab would drive onto the pavement so at least giving him the time to get the jump on Moran. He would either go for the gun, or at least make a decent get away to take Moriarty down on his own time.
He glanced over when Sherlock didn’t answer right away, found the detective in his usual thinking pose. Pale fingertips rested on Sherlock’s lips as the man in question thought. Even when Sherlock was all about the case right now, John couldn’t help but to be propelled into thinking about those lips on his from when they stumbled into bed together. It had been about time something happened, that he would agree with Sherlock there. Going at it in their pants may not have been what Sherlock had planned at all, but tumbling into bed was exactly what they needed. That quenched the feeling like he was going to go mad, and burn up from the overpowering sexual tension…but it was slowly building up again as the clock ticked.
“We caught the suspect at the crime scene. He admitted to shooting his victims but he refuses to talk to us further without you there.”
Someone had to protect them. Because Sherlock, his wonderful brilliant detective had a point. If John was kidnapped at 221 B under surveillance, what’s to stop it from happening again?
“The pool water is poisoned with a chemical mixture of arsenic and cyanide,” Sherlock answered flatly. “He’ll be dead in minutes.”
There was movement in the corner of his eye, and John drew back, swinging his fist into the air automatically. The force radiated up his arm as John’s knuckles cracked into Moran’s nose.
John had hoped that Sherlock would have closed the distance. He would much rather prefer snogging Sherlock than explaining what Mycroft said about Mary, and him, and the blackmail that could possibly tear him and Sherlock apart before any more progress could be made with their ‘all in’.
He exhaled sharply, and then flinched with the car door next to him opened. Before John could demand what was going on, a brown bag was disposed on his lap. Aroma from the spicy curry drifted underneath his nose. “So you think that Moriarty is alive then?”
“I could use a bit of a kip,” John replied sluggishly. They had to get up but he was relaxed and sated. He’ll deal with it later, very carefully. John could feel Sherlock’s words more than he could hear them at this point.
John narrowed his eyes, and furrowed his brow together. Silence grew within aquatic center. John could feel sweat growing behind his knees as he stared at Moriarty. Was it another trick in one form or another? He could be overthinking the situation, but in any way he’s glad to be the one with a gun in his hand.
Sherlock nodded and placed a glass of wine in front of him. John was thankful, not knowing if he could survive another sporadic touch while feeling whatever he was feeling at the moment. John snatched the glass and guzzled half. His thirst still burned at the back of his throat. Sherlock spoke and John leaned forward so he could hear the low bass of the detective’s voice over the crowd.
In five minutes time, John was dressed and downstairs, sitting, reading through their most recent bills. Or he was trying to read through the most recent bills, wondering what would have happened. Why his eyes were centered on Sherlock’s mouth. Why he practically vibrated with desire to pull him closer, and why he regretted pulling away. He watched the clock, seeing if Sherlock was going to be true to his ten-minute deduction. Sherlock stalked into the living room, pristine as usual, pulling on his large coat with swiftness. It had been eight minutes. John stood and grabbed his coat. Off they went.
John didn’t bother asking how Sherlock knew. “No. The wife was dead for hours. When I left, Lestrade was sealing up the crime scene. I found something else though.”
Moran chuckled, and turned his head, grinning at John as if they were mates going for a wild ride. “I know a pub with great fish and chips. They have great stouts too. What’s your poison, doctor?”
“You don’t know anything anyway, Lestrade. There’s always something you miss,” Sherlock stated flatly.
The sharp trilling of Sherlock’s mobile disturbed whatever Sherlock was going to say. John couldn’t help but to feel a little relieved, but at the same time disappointed. Sherlock turned away, going back to his search.
John couldn’t argue about the ‘boyfriend’ bit nor about the ‘bad move on burning the flash drive’ when it was a bad move considering their circumstances now. Also considering that Mary--or Rose’s past seemed to have come back to haunt them repeatedly.
Before John could a have moment to tease, the mobile trilled in his hand. “Someone’s ringing you again.”
“Well, perhaps the cabbie in the boot is, but right now I’m killing a bit of time until he’s ready. He has big plans.”
He pulled out the dead mobile from his pocket, the two slips of yellow messages, and presented it to Sherlock.
Victory pounded through his veins as the suspect rounded, went up another staircase, passing the door that would lead to the ninth floor and instead, going to the last option: the roof. They would be able to corner the suspect, Lestrade would be able to question, and the serial killer would be put away. They rounded another staircase as the darkened individual barged through the final metal door leading to the rooftop.
“Does that matter? If she had done it then something could have been remotely salvageable in this case!”
The video angled around Hageman, briefly casting a caught shadow of the person behind the camera on the grey blotchy walls.
John’s eyes snapped open and to the pair of eyes looking at him in the rearview mirror. The message was a threat on Sherlock…had something already happened? Could that be the reason why Sherlock was hurt?
Something pushed at the middle of his back, and John stubbornly remained as he was. Until something kicked him, a boot, judging from the impact on his ribs. He went to eat a mouthful of carpet, blessed that Mrs. Hudson did hover every day.
He didn’t know what the detective saw on his face but he pushed away from the doorway. Sherlock called over his shoulder as he went down the hall. “Eggs would be acceptable.”
“Greg,” greeted John. The inspector pinched the bridge of his nose and waved them through. His grey hair shone like bright silver in the sunlight as they walked past police cars and other officers.
He shook his head, resisted joining in Sherlock’s amusement and stuck with the conversation. “You did save her,” John stated conclusively.
“Mycroft didn’t care for you figuring that out, did he?” Sherlock gave John a look and got a grin in reply.
John didn’t wait for Sherlock’s remark, instead he ventured into the living room. The hopeful look on Joseph’s face disappeared, and utter defeat wrote itself over his face.
Surprisingly, Sherlock did. John wedged the balled up trousers underneath Sherlock’s arse. Then John dropped to his knees.
“This is one of the maddest things that you’ve ever done for a case, Sherlock,” stated John. His eyes were shut, making it difficult to rant on to Sherlock when he couldn’t see him. “Almost rates up with you stealing a double-decker.”
There was lewd wet pop before a rough masculine voice spoke. “I think we should take this back upstairs.”
John gently knelt forward and released the drain plug, leaving the hot shower on to keep themselves warm.
“Good morning, you seem awfully cheerful,” smiled Molly, then the rest of the Sherlock’s words seemed to register as John offered a small nod. “Hands?” she repeated with a squeak.
“I don’t remember attending primary school this morning. Quit bullying him for letting him do your job because you can’t,” he murmured lowly.
When he walked onto the rooftop, he paused in his steps taking in the scene. The suspect stood on the edge of the building. The baby squirmed in a bundle in the free hand. He swallowed heavily when he noticed the gun was focused on Sherlock. It was always Sherlock at the wrong end of the gun. He could see her face, pointing a gun at him, thinking that he was Sherlock in their trap. The baby cried.
“He already knew. You know there’s no sense in lying to him. He already knew that you asked me to ‘babysit’ him. His words, not mine.”
John turned away from Sherlock. Moving the attention from Sherlock’s scars, John teased moved to his friend. “What brings you here, Greg? A bit early for pints, isn’t it?”
John took a hesitant step forward, his palms up in the air, placating submission to soothe the nameless man. “Alright, you don’t have to step down, but at least hand the baby over. It’s not good for the little one to be out here with just a blanket.”
Another buzz vibrated against his left leg, inside his pocket. Another chirp announced in the sitting room. “We both know how his last interaction went, how it ended, how do you think we’re going to fair this time? Semtex again? Trapped underground?”
He shook his head gently and ignored it. John grabbed the antiseptic from the bed, and started on Sherlock’s cuts.
“Christ. What can we do then?” he asked aloud, not knowing if he was asking himself or someone else. “That arsehole in there, murdered three people and maybe a fourth.”
It seemed like they wouldn’t get some time after this case, everything would happen back-to-back. Another question was would they snap under the pressure of everything?  There was the temptation to get the scotch out of the kitchen cabinet and pour himself two fingers worth, but the warmth of Sherlock’s body kept him on the sofa.
A/N: Thank you for all the comments/kudos/ and bookmarks. This story is still going, I have up to Chapter 18 written out. For as short as the chapters are for this story, I feel like it's not going to end until about Chapter 50. Perhaps I should make longer chapters...We'll see. I want to thank you to all my betas who reviewed over his chapter.
“Yeah, they are,” agreed the detective inspector. He pointed a finger at Sherlock. -“If you ever repeat that in front of my superiors, I’ll deny it. I brought you copies of all the case files. The Pruit and Mollet case is still open.”
John nodded. “Didn’t want to say anything while you were in mid-deduction and focused on the case. Been so for a couple of hours, now.”
“If I were you…I would be a little nicer in asking me to finish you.” John arched an eyebrow while both his hands slowed down, the fingers inside Sherlock’s tight heat purposefully avoiding the bundle of nerves.
Suddenly, narrowed grey-blue eyes met his; almost seeming like Sherlock knew what he was thinking from the distance across the room. He didn’t want to have this discussion right now. He swallowed everything that he was feeling and focused. The Work. The case. John arched an eyebrow in his direction, hoping that he would be able to answer the wordless question. ‘Anything yet?’
Or on the other hand, they could be completely barmy because it could have simply been Mycroft again and took care of Sherlock’s drug supply box. Boundaries were never a thing to follow in the past either. And this could possibly his backhanded way of telling John that he had the information. Hell, this could be another backhanded test that Mycroft did to test his loyalty to Sherlock.
“If you can find something to tie him with,” he answered, thinking of the wasted tatters of rope they had just cut through. John kept an eye on the doorway, waiting as the heel clicks grew faster. “Maybe just the hands and feet.”
Moran shrugged, but didn’t argue John’s words. “I can’t go back empty handed, or show I was overpowered. I’m better off dead to him if I couldn’t play my part.”
John watched Sherlock’s long legs set the pace before he followed seconds later. He caught up to Sherlock, and remarked. “The surname should be easy enough. How many ‘Spoo’s do you know in London?”
His head started pounding. John felt hot, feverish, and flushed. He licked his lips, finding that he was suddenly parched. His thirst only grew when he saw Sherlock’s eyes following his nervous habit. Not that he was nervous. His heart spiked when a hand landed on his knee, flaring old feelings that he hadn’t experienced for a while. John stared at the hand resting on his knee, and a flash of gold caught his eye.
“Not enough circumstantial evidence?” mocked Sherlock. John watched him as he crossed the sitting room with his long legs, stomped on the table, then onto the sofa, to pin papers to the black and white wallpaper. Joining the spray painted smiley face from a time that Sherlock was bored. “No desperate link with the murderer weapons? Or how about matching the typical ‘same place, same time’ trivial? Everyone loves that one, we see it on the telly often enough. ”
“And how many bullets for the men, John?” Sherlock questioned, his coat collar flipped upwards as he joined them by the red post. Before John could answer his question, Sherlock continued with his deductions.
Sherlock suddenly rolled away from him, and got out of bed elegantly. The tall lanky detective took the sheet, wrapped it around himself like it was his usual coat. All the milky pale skin John had touched hours ago was covered up right before his eyes. Sherlock padded around the bed, curls on his head bounced wildly.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder, and John followed his line of sight, landing on the computer behind them. John turned around facing the screen with disbelief. Sherlock had ran the lifted fingerprints in the system before they started the video. Said that he had one print to scan. On screen, red letters flashed one name that sent chills down John’s spine.
John felt his stomach sink. He resisted the urge to look back at Sherlock, to see what kind of face he presented. He wondered if it was still the smile that they shared moments ago. Instead of looking back, John pursued his lips together, in the pressing silence as Greg took in the scene. John ignored the uncomfortable pull at his pants. They should have cleaned up before falling asleep, and then maybe they wouldn’t have been caught together. He shook his head, that wasn’t it. He wasn’t ashamed. There was no possible scenario in which John would leave Sherlock alone in his bed, not after what they had done together. It was a step forward, finally in the right direction.
“About five minutes after,” concluded Sherlock. His hands fixed underneath his chin and gave the Inspector a surprising look. “A personal record for the Yard.”
John ignored Sherlock, and only stared at the object on the bedside table. Sherlock continued to complain as he pulled the sheet over his face, “John, seems like you don’t have the same goals as I do.”
“Now, what video did Lestrade send you?” asked Sherlock. He closed the remaining distance between them, his chin hooked over John’s shoulder, looking at the mobile, and where John’s thumb hovered over the play button.
“No. We’ll settle this,” Mary stated, motioning with the gun in a little wave between them. “After we finish having a chat.”
“You were doing the honorable thing, John. You appealed to his humanity and yours. It was no fault of yours that the circumstances of this evening reached to that particular outcome.”
“You’re the one who bought the lucky cat for me. And technically, I didn’t gift you a death threat, it wasn’t on our list this year. Someone else did, and I just found it. We have 48 hours to find this Issac Spoo bloke or you are dead. We shouldn’t be happy about this.”
Greg was frowning at him. Arms folded across his chest. “Is everything alright? You know with”-the detective inspector pointed up at the ceiling, and then he mouthed, “Sherlock on drugs again?”
John paused in the small clinic room; he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Was he still using his mind palace when you came in? Did you say anything that might have triggered a-”
He really shouldn’t flirt while Sherlock was working. But Sherlock’s hands, neck, and even the cologne that permeated in the air distracted John. The startling dark bruise peeking out from his collar on Sherlock’s skin made John want to add another one. But they were on a countdown, during a case. Facing a death threat, and four people murdered, it was definitely not the best timing either. Best not get too distracted, or it might put Sherlock in a mood again, much like the one at New Scotland Yard when John was sent away.
“Well, at least we have a full profile on CCTV to use for possible ID,” remarked Lestrade. “Maybe his identity can make a new lead.”
He did look over his shoulder, missing the expression on Sherlock’s face altogether when the detective peeled away from him and out of bed. There was a startling bruise over Sherlock’s pulse, framing the purple tinge with the paleness. It was obvious what had happened. For Sherlock to think that Greg wouldn’t know, just showed how well and new to all of this he was.
“That’s it, Sherlock, provoke the suspect into shooting you, you git,” mumbled John in annoyance. He tucked his gun in his waistband and stood. He shouted through the door. “Don’t shoot, I’m coming out.”
Footsteps retreated from outside the hall. John hurriedly jumped into the shower. Under the warm spray, John relaxed, his eyes drifted shut. As he lathered his shampoo into his hair, his thoughts began to wander again. All back to that kiss.
“Yeah,” John sighed. Feeling his anger shifting to something that he couldn’t understand. A life was still a life. His hands trembled. “But, the baby didn’t-”
Pain radiated inside and outside his torso, where his seat beat was and did it the job of holding him in. The remains of the airbag were sagged in his lap, thankfully deployed. Still, John felt as though he had been either punched in the face, or kicked in the jaw again. Either way, it hurts. But better than having his face smashed in, though he also wasn’t in a rush to repeat it.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” John said as he grabbed the mobile from her. He punched in the number that he knew by heart, and waited with anticipation as it rung.
A voice John had burned into the back of his mind. The voice in his ear while he was strapped with C4, right at this spot. The voice of the man who caused nothing but pain and sadness in their lives… it echoed, “Because after all, I’m still here.”
It wasn’t more than two hours later at the clinic when John’s phone buzzed again. Luckily, his last patient was waddling out the door. He inhaled sharply, staring at the text message on his phone. His hand shook lightly as he read over the message again and again. John muttered curses underneath his breath, swearing up and down that he would kill Sherlock Holmes if he found him.
“Don’t give me that, Sherlock Holmes. As I recall, you thought your morning tea magically appeared.”
The other line went dead. John pulled the mobile away from his ear, frowning at the contraption. He took a few steps into the lab, hoping the service bar would reconnect again. “Either Greg hung up on me or we lost service.”
“You’re bisexual, not straight,” Sherlock countered with a grin. “I could have told you that years ago.”
John sighed and paused, staring at Sherlock, who was staring back at him intensely. Grey-green eyes flickered over John’s features, pausing on his mouth. John licked his lips, and was satisfied when Sherlock inhaled sharply. Grinning, John caressed over startling cheekbone and pressed a kiss to it.
He inhaled, seeing the suspect, hearing the baby, and seeing Mary and her gun. Waiting for Sherlock to fall again, this time by a bullet. John desired to have his gun in hand to steady himself. He was a soldier, damn it! He should be able to focus. It wasn’t her that they were chasing even if his head was screaming otherwise. It wasn’t his baby even if his heart yearned to hold it close. He needed something, a danger to focus on. He needed that gun moved off of Sherlock to focus or else his head would be useless. John walked until the suspect turned the gun on him. Relief flooded his system, knowing that Sherlock wasn’t a target at the moment. The aim was steady and determined, not on par with their usual suspects. Something nagged at the back of his head. Putting it off for the moment, he fixed Sherlock with a look and the detective replied with an arched eyebrow.
John remained unmoving as the taller man stalked over to him. “You’re planning on manipulating me to your advantage. The question you should be asking yourself is whether or not I care for a repeated performance.”
“It’s just your jumper for now, I doubt that it will progress any further than that. The secretary has a history of attraction for older men, but not old enough to seem like their father. I have already been seen, which leaves you. I’m normally not adverse to your wardrobe but ridding you of it is necessary to further the case.”
He walked into the sitting room, putting his set of keys and wallet into his pocket. Mrs. Hudson hovered in the doorway between the sitting room and the kitchen.
“Damn,” the detective inspector cursed, and stalked through the Met. John matched his strides. Even before John could see Sherlock, he could hear the low insistent baritone carried through the air. Donovan’s annoyed tone argued back, with the usual attached insult of ‘freak’. They rounded the corner, John readying to Sherlock’s defense and side when Lestrade cut to it first.
“My wife always thought you were clever…She was a big follower of your gay blog. Said it was romantic. She also said it helped that you were easy on the eyes to make up for your arsehole personality. Want to know what I think?”
John felt Sherlock’s hard length pressing against his back, muscles throbbing slightly every time he shifted against Sherlock. He could feel Sherlock’s pounding heartbeat against his own skin.
The expression on Moriarty’s face morphed into disgust. “I think he’s had too much of ordinary,” the man’s eyes flickered up and down John’s frame, undoubtedly taking in Sherlock’s dressing gown, shirtless, and in tight trousers on John’s compact body. The insane man sneered. “I’ve seen it. Not tooo difficult to hack into security cameras, you know.”
“Now that you are being seen to, I will take my leave, unlike you, Sherlock, some people have real responsibilities. I’ll alert you both if the circumstances changes. I also want to mention that 221B is secure and currently under surveillance.”
His heart definitely didn’t skip a beat from hearing Sherlock’s last name attached to his. “Yeah…maybe…work can be pretty demanding.”
John quickly changed into a blue jumper and dry trousers. Sherlock had his coat waiting. They ventured out of the flat and into a cab on their way to New Scotland Yard. In comfortable silence, Sherlock’s phone chimed, John’s buzzed in his pocket. They shared a look before checking their phones. John grinned when Sherlock groaned at his phone, hostilely pressing buttons before tucking it away, his head turning to look out the window.
The nurse grimaced, her nose wrinkled with irritation, as if she had had some recent experience with Sherlock. John could bet a large sum of money, and win it, that she probably had. Sherlock being his usual self was good news then.
The sting of tears gathered at the corners of his eyes. The baby’s helpless cries echoed in his head. Something firm and warm grabbed his shoulders. John looked up, finding Sherlock’s sharp grey eyes in the blurry haze. He felt the world shift under his feet and he grasped handfuls of the dark coat, clinging to Sherlock in a rare moment of helplessness. Sherlock was here. He had seen worst than this. Experienced worst. But this was a child. Something innocent.
“Oi!” John complained when the chill in the air bit as his bare skin and all the warmth dissipated. He threw himself forward on the bed and grabbed the corner of the sheet in a fist. He grinned up at Sherlock in mirth with his naked bum in the air.
“Before his death, Jim Moriarty had stepped in our flat. Not once, but on multiple occasions. Slept in our beds, messed with our things. You never knew or noticed. I would have Mrs. Hudson wash everything he touched. I would start an experiment to cover the scent. I had…believed…that Sebastian Moran would have been here as well. Everything that Moriarty would have touched hasn’t been moved.”
It had crossed his mind once or twice to say something, especially that one afternoon with the wine bottle in hand as he walked into Sherlock’s room. Then he never had the chance before Sherlock’s stunt that spiraled John into years of grieving. Afterwards, with Mary, he had placed a wall around his heart, so he wouldn’t ever get attached again.
The kettle whistled, calling John back into the kitchen. He fetched two mugs, quickly fixed tea, and returned back into the living room. Sherlock was sitting up now, with John’s laptop in his lap. John sighed, but at least Sherlock was entertaining himself. Placing one cup nearest Sherlock, John took to his chair. He sipped on his tea as Sherlock spoke.
John answered the confused DI. “He came to the flat, with a case about his missing sister, Merry Mollet.”
John snorted, caught off guard by the bizarre question. It wasn’t out of the ordinary that Sherlock asked odd questions - usually about postmortem and time of death or if he could have another head in the freezer. The answer will always be ‘no’ to another head. Never about Sherlock, or his features.  John turned around. A smile rested on his face from the ridiculousness, and then he noticed the look on Sherlock’s face.
John shook the water dripping down from his hair onto his forehead. His fingertip swirled over the skin, he watched as it fluttered at him, almost as if Sherlock’s body was giving permission, tempting his finger to breach the entrance. He circled around carefully, dipping his thumb inside, earning a shuddered gasp from Sherlock.
Oddly enough, those six words hit John with the sudden scent of chlorine and the phantom heaviness of semtex on his body. John fixed his hands on his hips.
And John didn’t wait for a farewell, a dismissal, or an offer for a ride from Lestrade. He ran into the night until he reached the main road, hailed a cab, and climbed inside. John glanced outside while he was engulfed in the silent dark of the back seat. It wasn’t even daylight yet, and everything has managed to go to shite. He rubbed his hands on his thighs, in a hurry to get to Sherlock.
“You got a point there. Look, just don’t run off like him, yeah? It’s different when both of you are here and we have back up with more officers like back at the row of flats. But for now, it’s just the two of us. I have another team en route but till then I need you to watch my back.”
“Well, that’s good to know.” John was relieved to know that there were no witnesses of his own private time. Both inside the bedroom and out of it. Then he added, “So, what happens now? Someone was in our flat, what do we do about it?”
“What happened to ‘most likely unarmed’?” he questioned, thankful that the panic  had started to subside and didn’t carry in his voice. He shouldn’t have been panicking in the first place. Being shot at was nothing new. John shook his head, tightened his grip on his gun. Sherlock was here, ignoring his personal space as always. It was fine. Everything was fine.
Eyes roaming over Sherlock’s body, meeting the bright prismatic eyes in the dark, John was most definitely lost. But only for a moment. Whatever spell Sherlock had cast on him vanished right there. John was left with the sight of the man posed on his bed was-beautiful, but that’s not all he was. John knew just how to explain himself now. He climbed onto the bed.
John didn’t bother questioning. Instead he focused on delivering a fine sweep of his tongue over seam where their lips are sealed, tasting the faded taste of toothpaste in Sherlock’s mouth. That one split second he switched from the taker to the giver. He had let Sherlock have his fun. Now, it was his turn. He kissed back with vigor, addicted to the way Sherlock felt. So warm, and a bit heavy.
“That would be me,” announced the DI, checking his pocket. He ventured to the doorway. “Text me if you think of anything. This case…last night…it was a rough one. I’ll get all the paperwork gathered up and drop it by later. Bye.”
“No. I need to say this, and you need to hear it. Now, if you try to protect me, or leave me out of this fight, Sherlock, I will drag you to New Scotland Yard, lock you in a cell and give Mycroft the key, is that clear?”
“Then listen,” whispered Sherlock. “Starting when the first shot was made, there were four possible scenarios. First, you could have returned fire, but on chance of hitting the infant, you did not. You could not guarantee the direction of his fall. He would have fallen over the edge or onto the rooftop, and theoretically could have crushed the child with his weight. Secondly, we both could have gone onto the rooftop, and you presented that you were armed. Cornered, either you or I, or potentially the infant becomes a victim immediately. Third, the infant is used as a distraction, thrown to either of us for a chance to escape, and as a doctor, you know how malleable small infant’s neck’s are, a simple toss could have ended the infant’s life. While armed, but knowing that the officers would capture him with that he ends his life with his own weapon. Fourth...is what happened.”
‘Or kidnapping.’ That was left unsaid, but the predatory look in her eyes told John what he needed (or not) to know.
John glanced over to his best friend, his flatmate, and the mad, insane detective who claimed to be a ‘high-functioning’ sociopath. For someone who says that he doesn’t care, he sure did ask that question a lot, especially to him. John wasn’t angry. He wasn’t in pain. If anything at all, he was thankful for the oblivious idiot standing next to him, waiting for the answer to appear on his face. He was happy. Happy that Sherlock was here, standing next to him, which made him waver in his decision of stepping over the line that he had mentally drawn. The ‘I don’t know.’ Closer? Or not? Feelings? Or platonic?
He opened the door to their flat and walked inside. Immediately, he was embraced with a sense of home, belonging, and peace that now it was just the two of them. Although it being home, John was livid with his flatmate. His ‘All In’, who was pacing about the sitting room like a mad man, contradicts his somewhat passive behaviours in the cab. Sherlock stalked into the kitchen, then back into the sitting room. Long fingers ran over John’s chair, then to Sherlock’s, over the dust collecting on the fireplace that Mrs. Hudson hadn’t gotten to yet. After touching everything in sight, Sherlock had stalked down into the hallway, in the direction of his room. A loud thump interrupted the low ramblings of the detective.
The flat was silent when Mrs. Hudson ushered their client in, cooing softly as if she were talking to a wild animal. Quietly, the client moved through the doorway, and across the flat. He stood, holding his arms across his chest. The older woman encouraged the nameless man to sit on the brown leather couch that Sherlock had been in moments before. Instead, Sherlock yanked over the plain wooden chair, the one designated for clients. The man was dressed in black trousers and plain brown shirt that echoed the shade of his hair and eyes. He sat down, looking uncertain as many of their clients did, and the uncertainty only enhanced the client’s young features. John saw a look flash across the man’s face but not before glancing over both him and Sherlock in turn.
“I can’t do both?” Sherlock questioned, his eyebrow arched at John. He only shook his head, grinning a little. “So, nothing then?”
The last of Sherlock’s words echoed in an unexpectedly silent room. Eyes of the Yarders stared at them. Phones rang, but no one made a move to answer. It seemed as if someone said freeze, and nobody moved. John nodded lightly to the stunned DI as Donovan approached the spectacle. Before she was close enough, he pulled at Sherlock’s coat, dragging the heavily breathing detective out of the building. Sherlock and his long limbs did not protect as they trotted along the corridors. It worried John even further, because when Mr. Punchline was quiet, things do not fair well.
