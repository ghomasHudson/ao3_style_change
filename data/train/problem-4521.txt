With more than a little regret, he brought a hand to one of Castiel's wrists and moved it away from his ass, to rest at the small of his back. It had been fine, it had been
"I didn't. Zach was offering the deal."
laughing. At some point, the laughter turned into crying. Great big ugly full bodied sobs, but he was still laughing through it. Dean just held on and let himself cry. Smiling, so much it hurt.
and let someone else worry about things. Because no matter how much he bucked, it was Castiel's mouth setting that steady pace. No matter how much his body begged for more, Cas denied him. And all Dean had to do to change that was ask. He didn't, but he
Cas stared at him. Head to the side like he had been asked a question.
"So uh, Cas?" He paused to make sure he had Cas' attention. The guy seemed pretty blissed out, totally absorbed in planting a line of tiny kisses along the underside of Dean's jaw.
Jimmy was still processing. "I don’t know?"
"That's what this was? Moral support?" Dean hooked a thumb into the belt on either side of Jimmy's waist. Fortunately for any passing motorists, it was doing its job of keeping his pants on quite admirably.
This was just one of those things. Dean didn't have to understand what it was like to share that sort of connection to know what a big deal this was. He let them have their moment, and just enjoyed that he was allowed to be a part of it. It felt strangely voyeuristic in a way that nothing else had.
Cas closed his eyes and hissed in a breath. His hand came up to Dean’s scalp, the other around his face. Dean's eyes closed, as he hummed in contentment.
"Sammy, again."
He was content to stay right there until Jimmy said otherwise.
not into the idea of overstimulation. Not to where I was going to take things. Just wanted to be able to touch you for as long as I could. This.... this is more than enough."
"What should I be saying to you, actually? Never asked.”
"Honestly? Me neither. Not anymore. So, I do what any sensible person does and go for the salt." Dean had to laugh, "Then
"Is the game over? Because if my vessel is not able to touch you soon, he may die. It would be tragic," said Cas with an absolutely straight face.
His face slipped away from Dean’s collar to press into the skin of his neck.
Dean did his best to sound curious but disinterested, not at all suspicious. “No. Why, why would you think that?"
"I can explain. I
His angel leaned in, rested his head on his shoulder.
Cas kept his head bent. Dean watched a hundred tiny muscle shifts, some loosening, some tightening, until the body was holding itself in a completely different way. And then he raised his head, and Jimmy’s eyes looked out at him.
Cas’ voice sounded tired. "No danger. Only me. Reacting... badly. Reacting... too much."
rocketing through him. One that made it feel like tiny pieces of his soul were being stitched back together. His entire body shook as he continued to fuck Jimmy. The feeling shot up his spine and through the handprint on his shoulder. But it probably wasn’t as intense... as what Jimmy was feeling right now.
Jimmy pulled back enough to look at Dean, right in the eyes. He was still smiling, but his smile had gotten more complicated. “You need to understand. You gave me another chance. You went to Hell for a damn good reason. I... I wasn’t even thinking about Claire when I said yes. He was supposed to
Dean was quiet, one hand on the wall of the shower, the other covering his mouth. It was Jimmy. Not Cas. The water and darkness did nothing to disguise the tremor in his voice. "What?"

It was also really fucking hot.

Cas' hand was off his ass in an instant.
shouldn't have." Alastair's voice was sharp and mocking now. "Did you really think this was—"
Jimmy settled between them. "I'd be okay if I touched your thighs?"
Cas bent down to kiss Dean again. When he broke it - "We would both love to touch you. Is that too much?"
done that.
“Cas didn’t – Cas doesn’t – he doesn’t think, not about food and water. That was – Dean I
was a smile, sunny and true. Jimmy looped his hands around Dean’s neck, brought his face close. Even wet like this, his hair was making a valiant effort to stick out in strange directions. “You’re a good man,” he said.
He had realized something.
Dean smiled softly at Cas, doing his best to pull him into an embrace despite the weird angle. "You know, there'll be other chances for sex. We can just cuddle until you feel better. Either way, fine by me." Actually, just cuddling sounded kinda nice right now.

Dean dropped his hand lower and began gently playing with his balls.

Damn. No wonder Cas had been such a wreck.
Jimmy to understand - but it needed to at least make sense.
Then the mattress shifted slightly behind their heads. Cas.
"I'm not sure what happened, but I do know you did a great job. You got backup. Some things you just don't go up against alone." Dean wasn’t going to acknowledge the hypocrisy in that last part. "It was... I got stuck somewhere else, but I'm back now. We're gonna be okay."
"Just getting your attention. What I was going to say is
than porn.
Something was clearly going on, and it wasn't something Dean really understood, but he was going to figure it out. Cas was kind of a mess, after all. In a good way. "Can I move now, or do you still need a minute?” It was getting really difficult not to move. Cas might be an angel, but Dean wasn't a saint. "You can just nod yes or no?"
bright. Cas surrounded them again, and he was
It was like they both decided to give him a show at the exact same time. Cas got a hand in Ketch's hair and pulled a sound out of him, and Ketch was using this as an excuse to actually touch. His hands were on Cas, on Dean, on the furs sounding them, as he plastered himself tight against Dean's body. This was
“It's totally haunted now. By us,” said Dean.
Dean took a slow, deep breath before turning to face Cas again. "You made a mistake. Mistakes happen."
afraid of him? This fucking sucked.
"Cas is still figuring things out,” Dean said, in explanation. “Food is - he’s on a learning curve." He continued to steal Jimmy's barbeque ribs, not showing any signs of remorse. Getting his own plate again would mean he wouldn't be able to keep his arm around Jimmy. No one wanted that.
matter then. Just bringing pleasure to the man he loved.
"I don't know about your pretty lips saying things like that," said Jimmy, from above. "What if you sucked Cas for a while. Wouldn't have to worry about talking."
He wiped his face on a nearby thigh before taking Jimmy's cock in his mouth. He thought this was an extremely clever bit of problem solving.
"Clearly I got the best deal out of the three of us. But as fun as this is, I still want to talk to Cas."
"Thank you, Daddy."
"Yeah. I know. I saw." Jimmy moved in, and slid his cheek against Dean's.
It was honestly really appealing. The idea of making out in the backseat, just that, with no pressure to go any further... but he'd already kind of made plans with Cas. So that would just have to wait. "Maybe we could find a drive-in movie somewhere, make an actual date of it?"
The words went in his ears, but bypassed his brain entirely. The praise sent a current of electricity down Dean's spine, straight to his dick.
"He thinks - saying it that way makes him sound too good." Jimmy cupped a hand around Dean's face, and looked at him. “See, when he found you - you said you were a demon. Said you were worthless. You asked him to kill you. And he… he tried.” Jimmy’s head tilted to the side, and for a moment he looked
. Silent, motionless. He wasn't armed. He didn't have anything to defend them with. He hadn't even thought to search the kitchen for salt. He tensed, didn't let go. He was going to have to trust Cas to get them out of this. Whatever
"Any details you need me to fill in?" Dean was aware that Cas might take that as an invitation to find out everything. He hoped he didn’t. But Cas seemed more fascinated by Dean's skin.
"‘Okay’ is a big ask. Maybe just ‘better?'"
And a muffled voice could be heard. The words indistinct, but the speaker -
"Are you... okay physically?” said Sam.
"Don't worry. I got you." It was only a few steps to the edge of the bed. "You're not going anywhere." He felt Jimmy's legs lock tighter around his waist, and Dean arranged things so he could lay him down. He was supporting his own weight, keeping Jimmy pinned to the mattress underneath him. "Cas is great, but he's not you. He’s also not the one I want right now.”
"Dean... would you like something? Anything?"
watching us together."
"Tell Jimmy - I thought you were going to die and you were carrying around parts of him and having drugged up orgies because the angels left
Jimmy pulled the computer into his lap, skimmed through the list, and then started to read aloud, very quiet, very intense.
"Hey, hot stuff," said Jimmy's voice from behind him. "You made our angel go feral and non-verbal, so you get to talk with me. You know..." He paused. "Yeah, this is ridiculous, we've already messed up the bed. I'm getting under the sheets." Jimmy stepped onto the floor, and very messily and inelegantly began to undo the hospital corners. Dean got up just long enough to grab the trench coat before climbing back in.
.’" Close enough. Besides, it
"We're waiting for the pie to cool," Dean explained. It made perfect sense to him. "Claire helped make it. I think Mom's really glad to have a granddaughter." Did Sam and Jess have kids? They must. Maybe they went home already. It was late afternoon. Maybe it always had been. It didn't matter. This was a nice dream.
"Dammit Dean..." And Jimmy just launched himself across Cas' chest, and took him in his arms. "After enough time has passed that my wife is able to have me legally declared dead, I will take you to Arizona, or Connecticut, or somewhere else gay marriage is legal. And if you still want to marry me then - I will marry you."
Dean laughed. "Right. I...wow. Yeah, that. Sure."
Dean chose to ignore that, because it started to get overwhelming if he thought about it too long.
"Pontiac, Illinois," said Jimmy.
Dean didn't say anything. Jimmy unwound the blanket he was wearing around his shoulders. "Come on. Get out of there. You're going to get sick."
not pull out."
He wasn’t nervous. This was just what it felt like when he let himself be insanely, stupidly, head over heels in love.
Dean put the cellphone on the bedside table again. "Sam knows."
Dean was warm and comfortable and he smelled food. He made a kind of a contented purr. Maybe Cas and Jimmy would visit this dream too. That would be nice. Sam was talking to one of them. That was weird. Dean tried to remember what he was doing. Came up with nothing. Wouldn’t he know that kind of thing, if this was a dream?
"Headboards? Like the ugly purple padded thing on the bed right now?"
Dean felt Cas shudder, through the cock he held against his throat. The fingers holding his head spread to a wider, firmer grip. Cas kept up his motion, slow and firm and inexorable.
. And I couldn't explain what happened to me before, not in a way that Amelia would accept. But with you I could. Because it's the truth. I
"Yeah, and if she weren’t in some kind of angelic impound lot with Zachariah, that's where we’d be now."
"She's going to see you as the guy with answers who could have explained, but didn't. Actually, I think that idea you had about teaching her to use a shotgun is great. That'll let her know you respect her. Then she can trust you. She's a really great kid. And I mean, sure she gets angry, but then she cools down. Sam reminds me of her. Which is weird maybe. But there you go."
Cas came back down to the bed and stroked over Dean's hot erection with a handful of lube, one that made everything silky and slidey and cool.
Cas closed his eyes and smiled "My vessel loves the way you adore his body."
That could wait. Right
Dean smiled up at them, and ran his hand appreciatively up strong muscles to get to Ketch's bicep. "Cas takes some getting used to." He was more teasing than reassuring.
Castiel pushed Dean down to the mattress, scraping fingers across the old handprint brand, the tattoo that would let no demon inside him, and the ribs Cas had carved with tiny runes that would let no angel find him. Cas was inside his body, in so many ways, and now he was inside Cas', as Cas adjusted himself on Dean’s hips, rolling back to find that spot, that perfect spot. And when he found it again he moved against it, using Dean as a toy, stroke after stroke after stroke until Cas wrapped long fingers around Jimmy's cock - and used the other hand to stroke the tender skin where Dean and Cas met - and then he was coming, spurt after spurt across Dean's chest.
"Wait, this car has bench seats?" Jimmy was climbing out of shotgun - out of Sam's seat - into the back.
"I will really
Dean stopped what he was doing long enough for one word.
had the right to be happy, but now the world is ending and I’ve got both of you. And
Jimmy pulled Dean into his arms, and tucked his head under his chin. "Come here, you. Castiel knows you love him. No question. That was a big deal, what you did last night. But I have to know. Is this guy... still alive? This guy who isn't Zachariah. Because Castiel is going to want to kill him. And by Castiel, I mean me. But Castiel will get there first."
to be good for them.
too real. Not bad, but - just a lot more than he ever expected. Jimmy wasn't a dream. This wasn't some djinn-vision, or alternate future, or weird hallucination. Jimmy was real. So was Cas.
"Yeah,” said Jimmy. “Don't worry about that. Not going anywhere."
"They're going to be mad at you. Claire and Amelia. Claire will probably take a while to trust you. But that's okay. She's allowed. And Amelia - is actually easier. We were never, I mean..."
Dean rattled off the address while peeling a leaf off the bottom of his foot.
this." It took every last bit of willpower he had to keep the memories at bay.
"I uh... I might need your help here.” This wasn't easy for Dean to say, but he had to try. "Cas was... I couldn't hurt Cas. This is... We’re getting married. We get to spend the rest of our lives together. We can take things slow. We’ve got time.”
Cas body was starting to look flushed. "My vessel has very strong opinions on the way you... drink beer bottles.”
"It's not like it would be legally binding or anything. I was just thinking there's no way I can marry you both unless a whole lot of people get a lot more open-minded. Add in the whole angel thing? No way. I mean, Pastor Jim would've done it. It sucks that he's dead. You would have liked him. I’m saying, the only blessing I want from on high is Cas. Not sure how that works - if I'm marrying him too. Or I guess you guys are marrying me, since you already said yes to the whole vessel thing." Dean stopped short. "Crap. Sorry, man. I didn't mean it like that."
"So now that you know what
Alastair was right. Dean
"Cas, can you tell me what a good boy I am again? I liked that." Dean heard himself speak as if from a distance. But not the distance he usually felt from his body while doing this. He was
Dean’s words were out before he could stop them. "I just want to be

Ketch behind him, shivering and reacting to Cas' touch. Moving into it, pressing closer.
Sam sat behind him, still wary. He glanced over Dean's bent head. Looked at Cas in his bathrobe. "Who am I talking to. Cas or Jimmy?"
Jimmy smiled, a big goofy smile. "I'll let him know." He flopped backwards onto the pillows, crossed his arms behind his head, and gazed up at the ceiling."This -" he made a vague hand gesture at the room. "This has been good for us. Our, you know. Relationship."
"Yeah. I can do that."
"I didn't think I would ever have this," he whispered, into the quiet stillness. "Not before. Definitely not after. I wasn't sure I could."
"Sometimes that doesn't work," he admitted.
“Cas. It’s - I’m…” Dean could do this. “Good to see you. Really, really good timing.”
Dean still couldn't meet his eyes. He had a point. It suddenly
"Promise," said Jimmy. "But you better remember. Same goes for you."
"If this is reconnaissance, we need to know where you like to be touched."
"Thanks Alfred." Cool car. Bat cave. British butler. Dean was practically Batman.
want Cas to leave. If Cas left, he was going to have to call someone. Sammy. He was going to have to call Sammy. Dean didn't know if he could forgive Cas if he had to do that. There were some things his little brother shouldn’t know, and what happened with Alastair was top of the list.
so beautiful. Having my fingers in you felt amazing. You were..." For some reason, Dean felt almost shy. Just... talking like this. He didn't really do the whole morning after thing.
"Hey, I’m with you. But I'm not even at the good part yet." It was all Dean could do not to skip straight to the punch line.
“Hold on. I’ve got an idea,” Dean grabbed a pillow for his knees and dropped it off the side of the bed, before moving Jimmy’s legs onto his shoulders. Jimmy laughed, which seemed to be how he always responded to Dean manhandling him.
Dean kissed him. It was messy. It was the kind of clumsy he’d been when he was a teenager. He only just managed not to knock their teeth together, but their noses weren't so lucky. Jimmy laughed, and rolled on top of Cas with him, kissing Dean back in just the same way.
Fingers stroked the back of his neck. “You sleep so easily in my arms, Dean,” Cas rumbled. “And my vessel slumbers just as soundly. I was considering taking you to watch the sunrise. Somewhere no eyes could see you. The center of the Grand Canyon, perhaps.”
Dean pushed back against Jimmy's hand. He wanted, he
have the right to make mistakes and not be perfect.
"If she’s anything like Sammy she’s gonna hate us if we lie to her. But she deserves normal too. There’s gotta be some way to split the difference. I just don't know how."
Dean didn't say "I told you so," but it was close. Now, instead of just using his fingers, he was able to use the flat of his hand without worrying about too much friction. Starting at the bottom of Jimmy's rib cage, Dean slowly dragged his hands upwards, until he reached the nape of his neck, and could feel him squirming, frantically pulling closer.
Dean bit his lip and tightened his grip on his knee to keep from touching himself.
This was Cas, this moving golden orb around him. It was beautiful, and intricate and unimaginably complex. And he and Jimmy were at the heart of it. Cas was the person sitting next to them, but so much more.
Dean's smile was almost sad. He nodded. "Okay. Wanted to make sure. Thought maybe I dreamed it."
"You don't have to do anything you don't want."
Dean started pacing. The carpet felt weird through his stockings. He realized the pacing wasn't helping anyone except him and sat back down. He wrapped his arms around Jimmy, rested his chin on his shoulder. The only thing that mattered now was Cas. But Dean wasn't good at situations where all he could do was wait.
"And here I thought you were vanilla and boring."
Jimmy shivered underneath Dean. "Wait. Your idea's better. I'll get to feel you too, through him. Cas' whole bondage thing would turn into a
And that was when the realization sank in. Dean could

some of the things he wants to do to you. And now? Since he figured out he can sort of, kiss your soul when you orgasm?"
And as soon as he knew he was allowed, Dean lost himself in open-mouthed kisses on shower-clean skin. He was hopelessly, helplessly turned on as he moaned into the skin of his lovers. They were going to get married. He was allowed.
with no luck. He could dig through paper records just fine, but he’d grown up learning how to find hundred-year-old newspaper articles on microfilm. Not up-to-date information about how to actually cope with shit. He looked back at Sam, admitting defeat. "It's called a 'personal bill of rights.' Like a list with 20 or 30 things on it? Ash had it, in one of his books.”
"In here," said Jimmy's voice, coming from the bedroom.
Engulfed by them, Dean melted. Ketch kissed like a drowning man gasping for air, clutching at him. Until Cas laid a hand heavy against the back of his head, to calm him down.
"Not sure if it’s because of that Righteous Man prophecy or if it’s like... the angel version of a valet doing doughnuts in a fancy car or what."
Jimmy was using the slight changes in Dean's muscles to stroke him with the same rhythm. They were both kissing him - Cas on his lips, Jimmy on his neck. Jimmy's hand found its way to his balls, and gently squeezed.
A fire. A hospital room. His brother screaming from down the hall. A body. A crossroads. Dogs he shouldn't have been able to see. Pain. A knife in his hand. A sunken room with a drain in the floor that was backed up more often than not. A pool of blood that reached his ankles. Burning pain in his shoulder and something with wings and impossible edges hidden in the shape of a man. A box and too much earth. Another body, this one partially eaten. Someone is wearing Sam and a white suit in a garden where nothing can live.
." And now that he'd started, he just
“That makes two of us." Dean snuggled back, close enough to feel Jimmy breathe. "I wasn’t getting how new he was to this whole... wanting-things thing. He really does wants to fuck me, right? That’s not just something he thinks
"You slept in the middle. You and my vessel. I exist around you as always." Cas sighed, contented. "He sleeps still. I did not wish for you to wake alone."
Dean flopped back against the bed. "Cas. You're - I don't - Are you? I mean... Really?" Propping himself back up on his elbows again, tried to clarify. "Is that what you want?"
In one movement, both Cas and Jimmy sat up to bracket him, front and back.
"Yes.
"Don't think I've ever heard anyone say, ‘Mr. Winchester’ in my life? It's always just 'Winchester.' Usually shouted across a room."
Cas smiled his mysterious smile again. "I wanted you both at once."
Dean’s attention was back on Cas. He found a mostly-full pot of coffee, nearly dumped it on the flames, thought better of it, and poured it into the sink before getting some bathwater and putting out the flames that way. The second there was a clear pathway, Dean was walking towards Cas and pulling him into a bear hug.
Dean held tight, and tried to keep remembering where he was. "Sometimes,” he said, “Sammy talks about stuff that happened a few years ago for him, and I don't even remember it. I'm so tired, Jimmy. I just want to sleep forever." He was shivering. But at least he wasn't crying.
Quietly, not wanting to wake Jimmy, he finally said, "You sure I'm not a demon?"
"Still good?" Dean had one finger halfway in, and added more lube.
do that for you, but I'm asking him not to - if that's cool?"
Dean couldn't stop laughing. His entire body shook with it. "Where have you been all my life?"
"what the..."
"Oh yeah. We're good."
anything."
Dean turned his head away, reluctantly.
Jimmy backed into one of the kitchen stools.
"I mostly just wanted to do this."
"I'll be thinking of you while you’re gone." Dean began lazily stroking himself to illustrate.
Jimmy lined up his hand with the red brand across Dean's shoulder. “Still weird to think that somehow I did that.”
. "I want everything to go back the way it was. I want the world to stop ending and I want to be able to sleep. I want you to stay. I want somewhere to live besides my car. I want you to feel loved, I want Jimmy to have a normal life and -" The list went on for miles, but he made himself take a breath. "The Stones were right. You
Dean turned the engine off just to be safe.
"Do you want Cas to hold you too?"
"Are you okay?" Right on cue.
Then he felt like kicking himself. He did
Dean had already started taking off his shoes.
Dean just shook his head. He didn't know anything.
"Thanks." Dean's voice was barely a whisper.

about the gun show!"
"You're so beautiful," said Jimmy. "You're so beautiful, and I wish I could say it better – you – your
"God, you're perfect." Dean's voice was barely above a whisper. An escaped stray thought.
"I do not think so? But I also do not understand the question."
Jimmy nodded. His wide eyes followed Dean.
"And Jimmy?"
Jimmy kissed along the length of Cas’ cock and then broke away. One of his hands wound into the trenchcoat.
"Nightmares," said Jimmy. "You must get nightmares."
"Dirty talk and puns? I think I'm in love." Dean pretended to dramatically swoon.
thing. He'd come apart so bad he might throw dressers around the room."
Or maybe it would end in a demon virus taking over the world, Cas falling, Sam saying yes, and Dean sending his friends to their deaths for no reason. But right now, he was allowed this.
"Okay, slow. You can start to press in a bit." He felt like he was giving instructions for driving a forklift. Oh well. Not everything about sex could be sexy all of the time. Not even Dean Winchester.
Jimmy bowed his head. "That used to scare me."
Then stroked himself, once, with even more lube. He put a hand on Dean's arm for balance, lined himself up, and began to sink into him.
Dean had to agree. He didn't want to think about Jimmy anywhere near Hell. But he was almost to the good bit of the story, and didn't want to get distracted.
"I could finish you with my mouth. You could hold me as my vessel fucks me. You could fuck me as he does. There are so many possibilities Dean, and I want to try them all."
Cas cuddled Dean closer in his arms.
That made things snap into focus. Dean knew the question he was too afraid to ask - the one he was going to ask anyway.
"Yes."
Dean turned to Jimmy. "It looks like we're gonna have to share." He was okay with that. He just wasn't okay with actually asking.
It sent Dean sinking deeper into his strange sort of zen. Torn between trying to focus on Cas and wanting to just float in the safety that was being snuggled between these two. This was even better than being the little spoon. Definitely different from sleeping between two chicks.
"Hell?"
"You may open your eyes to see me look deeply disbelieving."
Dean's only reply was to fall back against the mattress, and throw an arm over his eyes, face turned skywards as he gave an irritated groan. The muscles of his abs fluttered involuntarily. He laughed.
Then he walked across to Dean. Took both his hands. Kissed one, then the other.
and still wanted him. But Cas – would he be able to look at him anymore? Would he be afraid to touch him?
Jimmy brought his hands softly into Dean's hair, and pressed him into his chest. "It's okay," he said. “It’s okay.”
him for it because sometimes he didn’t leave me alone and bleeding out on those white fucking shiny goddanm floors, and you... why the fuck would you do that!" Dean was shouting, and he had gotten off the bed and was standing as far away from Cas as possible, wrapped in Jimmy's trench coat. Clutching his phone like Cas might try to take it from him.
"Just talk for now?" This might count as an emergency, Dean wasn't sure. He just knew he didn't want Sam to hang up.
"Come on. What’d you think I’d be like?"
"Dean," he said. "May I kiss you as I have been touching you?"
"Oh." When he put it like that, Dean couldn't exactly argue.
"Cas. There's nothing to forgive. We're good. And come on,
Dean let out a long breath. "I am so proud of our angel right now. And
Dean whined. It wasn't manly or flattering but there was no other word for the noise he was making. Cas hummed around him in a pleased sort of way. His eyes closed, a little lost in the experience.
"I am sorry. I am nearly... past speech..."
Cas pulled the crumpled tie out of his pocket. "My vessel thinks I will rip this in half."
That sense of peace he'd felt earlier was back. Not as strong, but there.
Please?"
. God, no. I can't
"Are you
tempting us with these images?"
Cas scrunched up his eyes as though he were in pain. "
"Oh. Okay. Nice."
There was a sound almost like kissing as Cas sucked his own fingers, experimentally. “Apparently, I need salvia.”
As much as Dean enjoyed that mental image, he made himself focus on the important parts. “It’s the closest I’ll get to having you both at the same time, when we’re awake.”
"Any idea how you're going to patch things up with the kid? I gotta think rescuing her counts for something?"
Jimmy dropped his head onto his shoulder, and exhaled.
"Pretty easy on the eyes yourself."
"You have no
Cas easily pulled Dean up from the pillows. His kisses didn't stay on Dean’s lips, but traveled over his jaw, and neck. Cas tipped Dean's head backward over an arm, so he could kiss down his entire throat, starting at that vulnerable soft place just underneath the chin.
Dean tried his best not to thrust up into Cas' mouth, but it wasn't easy. Not with Cas looking at him like
Dean got his feet under him, trying to get some space between himself and the car. "Cas, I am doing the rock-bottom bare minimum here. Jimmy deserves so much more. And you, you're a literal angel. I don't even know where to
." He almost didn't want to say anything, but... "If he can do that, do you think he can stop your gag reflex? I mean, I don't... I'm not...."
It was disorienting, tipped backward in Cas' arms like that, suspended in the air. It was actually a lot like when Cas had him in that wedding carry, except now Cas was sitting on his hips, stroking Dean with the hand that
demon-free.”
"Now you are being
Dean was still playing with the slit and head when Jimmy moved around to kneel at his side, sitting between him and Cas. Then somehow he managed to contort his head until Dean felt the unusual sensation of being kissed
“Hey Cas…” He wasn't even trying to fight the angelic strength. “Is Jimmy okay?”
He was pressed between both bodies now. Castiel leaned forward, thrusting into Dean with small, intimate, expert movements. Jimmy's body he might be learning, but Dean's body he
Jimmy curled in closer and pulled the blanket around them, over their heads, blocking out the small bits of light that made it into the room. His face rested on Dean's collarbone, and his hand on Dean's ribcage. His breathing became slow, and even.
Okay. That was something. Dean tried again. "Imagine if someone horrible were able to force you into the same connection that you have with Jimmy. And it's just as personal, and just as strong but it's

"Yeah," said Jimmy.
"They have
"Take as long as you need,” he said, into Castiel's neck. “You. Are the best thing. I have ever felt. Best thing I've ever seen. Kissed." He meant to kiss him on the lips but ended up kissing the side of his chin. It didn't matter. That was good too. Dean brought both his hands up to run the length of Cas' back, starting at the shoulders, continuing down his hips, and across his thighs before returning to hold him close, trace little nonsense squiggles in the space between his shoulder blades.
that's sexy. But before you go..." Dean was still lying on his back, and undoing his pants as slowly as possible. Half way through, he paused.
"Nah, it's fine." Sure, having Ketch here was weird, but maybe also kind of awesome? Definitely useful while they were stuck like this. Also it gave Dean an excuse to... not talk about certain things.
him down.
“I’m choosing this. I
“You’re the best.”
Jimmy bent down, and brushed his lips over Dean's. "I want to play with your ass and see if I can find the spot that can make you fall apart." He looked above Dean's head, for a second. And looked down, with his best Royal Flush face. "Oh. I forgot. Cas actually put your body together. He knows
Jimmy exhaled, and at the end of his breath unfurled against Dean's body, pressing too tight and pulling the cracks and kinks out of his back like a very mean masseuse.
"Don't take this the wrong way. But I miss having both you guys in the same body. This has its advantages," Dean snuggled back into Cas, "but it's not the same.” Snuggling was a pretty generous description for what he was doing. It leaned towards cuddling, but... suggestive cuddling. Dean kissed Jimmy's hair and whispered, as if Cas weren't right there, "Feel like this all the time? Like he's got you in this nice warm hug?"
“He's starting to get hard for us," said Jimmy
Dean shut himself in the bathroom and locked the door. Not that it would do anything to stop Cas from opening it if he wanted, he could probably unlock it with his goddamn mind. But it made Dean feel better. Back against it, he slid to the ground to take stock of the situation. He had a blanket, his cellphone, and Jimmy's trench coat. It was pathetic how happy he was about that last one.
Not even slightly.
"Do you have some kind of system or schedule for who gets to use the body when?"
himself. He'd say it was an honest-to-God miracle. He’d have to ask Cas."Just hold me for a second?"
"Okay. You can talk." He was sure to specifically address Cas, to avoid any confusion. “I messed up. I wasn't thinking straight and I'm still a little messed up. I want to explain but I
"Ketch went over the basics, but if you felt like explaining more of what's going on here that- that’d be great." Dean tried to reposition, but Cas refused to be moved. "Mostly just want to know what to call stuff. For, you know... dirty talk." Couldn't tell a guy how good something felt if you didn’t even know what to call it. And whatever was going on with Cas' cock right now felt
Amelia like I really should have. I don't think I made it very good for her."
Cas let out an actual
"What would you say, then?" Cas placed a few kisses along Dean's hairline, and Dean ducked his face against Cas' neck. Arms wrapped around his back, petting the back of his neck, and Dean was practically glowing from happiness.
"He's... listening." Jimmy had seen the self-help article on the screen, and seemed to know what it was at least.
“A place with running water that has not felt a human presence in some time. A place we will not be disturbed.”
“So a poltergeist?” said Sam.
Dean pulled Cas into a kiss that would scandalize a succubus. "
"This is different.
"If I had clothes I think I'd be okay though? They don't even have to be right for the weather. I just need
get to write about my kid." Looked at Jimmy. "Honestly, I feel bad for the guy. He didn't ask for those visions, but that nightmare future had those books made into movies and that’s not coming near our family. Chuck'll probably be so scared he wets his pants. But for the record, I wouldn't actually hurt him. That's a good way to piss off an archangel."
"Good. Cas, yes/no questions only."
There was a moment of vertigo, as the entire world seemed to shift and then snap, and plunge into complete darkness. And it took Dean longer than it should have to figure out he was lying in bed, awake.
of his clothes?"
" said Jimmy. "I didn't know... that was a spot. I need to re-figure myself out." He touched Dean's hair with his fingertips, but couldn't reach farther than that. "Don't stop.”
"I forgive you. Oh
Jimmy gently pulled his arm away. "Yesterday. You couldn't stand to have Cas kiss your thighs. And you couldn't tell us why."
"...I think I get what Jimmy meant about you not getting human sexuality. Let me think of how to explain." He thought about what Cas had said about somehow being both connected to Jimmy and able to see the sky, even with the roof in the way.
"Yeah, jerk. You too."
"You'd look good in them. Pretty sure you look good in most things. Even that trench coat. But you look damn fine naked too."
Maybe it was a bit crude, but Dean wasn't exactly known for putting things delicately.
Cas kissed the back of Dean's hand. “I would take care of you as carefully as you did my vessel. There is nothing I would not give you."
Dean was the picture of calm except for the way he fumbled with the lube with his shaking hands."Baby, I want this. But we have to go slow, alright?"
"Hey. Listen?" Dean put a hand to either side of Jimmy's face.
The arms would have been long on
"You need the room?" asked Sam. "There's places I could be."
That was all the warning Dean gave before he lifted Jimmy into his arms. The move was sudden enough to surprise a real laugh out of him.
Dean had forgotten how good this felt. He wasn't sure he'd ever really
I can't convince you to come back here for a few minutes?” said Jimmy. “No one's waiting on us."
"It's easier if you keep talking to me." Dean knew what to do, but right this second - he was just too afraid to move.
Dean laughed. "That's a lot of luck."
Cas tilted Dean's head back, and
Dean took a moment to just look up at him. "I am so in love with you right now. I can't believe I get to be the first person to do this for you. Means I get to make sure it's done right."
, how many times do I have to tell you?"
Dean turned his attention back to Jimmy. “Thank

die, this Zachariah has been screwing with everyone, but I've got you right here. World is crazy, you're doing an amazing job. So
"Don't see why I wouldn't, give it a shot."
Dean crawled towards him, strung out and not thinking totally clearly. It had been a very long day, he had thought too many things, and now Cas was going to kill him by misunderstanding sex.
He took a slow deep breath and tried to focus on
He broke away. Felt Cas go as silent and rigid as a statue in his arms. Probably, it was a decent idea to back off. But the second he did, one of Cas’ arms curled around him and it was like backing into a wrought-iron fence.
"Does this mean we're hunting together again?" said Sam.
"Hey check it out, I found another knife!"
the store. The payphone was fine!"
Dean focused, and turned all his attention to him.
"Forget it. Don't know why I said that. You're not even human so it's not like this kind of thing matters to you anyway, just forget I said anything." He could not believe how fast he’d gone from sexy and in control to making a complete ass of himself.
"Wait a sec." Dean was fine, he just needed to make sure he stayed that way. “I’m just... this is really different.”
He took his time spreading a generous amount of the stuff all over the place. "This is part of the fun. There's so much of you to explore." He went back for another kiss - but quickly pulled back. "Eew. Why does flavored lube always taste like ass? Actually, I take that back. Your ass is fine. This tastes like... really bad flavored lube."
Jimmy just looked at him.
Breaking off the kiss, Dean turned his attention back on Cas. He kissed his lips, the side of his face. Kissed a far down as their current position would allow, still tied together like this.
"I'm a bad influence. You're perfect. Come here."
"I love you too. Please. Just... keep talking?" They couldn't know this. It was too hard to explain. "It's not -"
"He's gorgeous."
Cas walked across the room and pulled thin curtains over the tiny window. Warily, he sat on the bed. Then relaxed into pillows piled against the headboard.
Jimmy thrust into him. "This is all for you, kitten," he said. The words seemed to be helping his rhythm. "You were made for this."
"It’s not locked." The darkness at least meant that he didn’t have to see Jimmy's face, as Jimmy came close to him.
- the fact he was so pissed off was the main reason he wasn't having a complete breakdown. And maybe going silent and holding a coat like a security blanket wasn't the picture of mental health either. But whatever, it was working. As soon as he got himself back together, he wanted an explanation.
Dean felt good. Really good. The hand at his back pulled him forward, spinning his chest so Cas could kiss his shoulder.
"How have I got anything to do with that?"
"See, I was focused on this gorgeous guy and whatever Cas did kinda blindsided me." Dean felt stupidly romantic. Also couldn't stop playing with Jimmy's hair.
"Marry me someday?"
They sprung for the good mattress. Oh dear sweet Heaven. Promise me that if he tries to get up, you'll do a holy oil circle around us, ‘kay?"
"I'd love to have some kind of explanation for you. It's just sad that all there was going on is me, being scared and wrong and dumb.”
"Probably shouldn't be telling you this over the phone, but you remember the Roadhouse?" It was a lifetime ago for Dean, but it had only been a few years for Sam. "I wasn't flirting with Jo. I wasn't interested. Also, she wasn't into
“Okay.” Dean tried again. "I mean, it sure seems like your mojo took a hit after..."
The high pitched sound Dean made would have been embarrassing if this had been anyone else, but right now he didn't care. An odd shudder ran through him, starting at the base of his spine and ending at his shoulders. Like that feeling of jolting awake right as you’re falling asleep.
Cas drew in a long, shuddering breath.
It was hard though, with Cas smiling at him like that. Practically
“Um. If something actually goes wrong, that might not work.” Dean tried to explain in as little detail as possible, “What just happened? If you weren’t inside my head, you probably wouldn’t have noticed. Just a stray thought. We do this, and you ask me if I'm okay... I might say yes even if I'm not." To show weakness in Hell was to invite pain. "You could
"Sit. Drink."
Jimmy looked up into his eyes. And as if in answer, Cas draped Dean's other leg over Jimmy's shoulder, and slid forward, changing the angle until he was almost lying down. Dean could practically feel those eyes behind him.
"Jimmy. God, I didn't even think - let’s say I was talking about Cas. Since now I know you’re not really into the whole dom thing.”
Jimmy hissed and bucked wildly - which resulted in a pretty good thrust. Dean snort-laughed.
" He dragged a hand up Dean's cock as he kissed him, then leaned down to whisper into his ear, like it was a secret. "What it would feel like to just wrap arms around you and pull you in
my fault." Jimmy kissed him, hard, and Dean laughed into the kiss.
don't want the details of your sex life, but I do need more than 'not good now.'"
"Okay. I'd kiss you first but I think I'd get distracted too quickly."
"Yes. Holy crap, that's hot. Yes!"
He didn't have to tell Cas to add more lube. Cas had that part down.
"He's okay? Just close, not overwhelmed?"
Jimmy bent his head to lay one soft, lingering kiss just inside Dean's thigh, then broke away, and raised his head to look at him. "One more?"
"Later. My vessel is full."
Dean's jaw clenched and he squared his shoulders, trying to salvage what few shreds of dignity he had left. "You mind explaining to me." He wanted to shout, but didn't. "Exactly what the hell you were thinking there?" Even
"I need you to know that this person, who you've been talking about, with the bribing and ownership? That doesn't sound like Cas. It sounds like Alastair. Who I am really
Castiel was making intense eye contact. He didn’t usually do that for whole conversations. Normally, he talked facing odd directions and let Dean talk to the side of his head. Which meant he was probably doing it for Dean’s benefit, but this was already not going to be an easy talk. Dean closed his eyes. He wished he could do this sitting next to him, so they could be close but not have to
That's not what I want and you know it." Dean's voice cracked, but he didn’t care anymore. "I wanted to make this work, so I told you about how I was so desperate to be cuddled by my goddamn
Dean sniffled a bit. It
Cas reached back to adjust Ketch against him. "I would have expected more scar tissue, given your profession. You must have access to magical healing."
There was something about being reminded of just how different this was from Hell that was... too many memories. Too many emotions. Dean tried to hold onto their surroundings... but they were starting to slip away. The bed stayed the way it was. The rest fell slightly out of focus.
There was a long pause. He hadn’t given Sam enough to go on. He knew he hadn’t. But he could hope.
it. This was the man he was going to marry. He was allowed.
"Maybe you are. Right now
Jimmy turned away from Cas' neck, in what looked like a real effort. "The lace?" he said, finally. "You didn't make it with normal lace patterns. You made it with Cas-patterns? He can tell."
"I'll tell you. I promise. I might need to. I don't think so, but I might. At least now you know not to take it personally." The joke fell flat, but he'd kind of expected it to. It was more for himself than for Jimmy.
was. He'd rather die of embarrassment butt naked in the middle of Bobby's kitchen than backed into a corner by a demon. Or another angel. In which case Dean's answer was still no. The only angel he wanted inside him was Cas.
"I'm sorry." Dean felt like he'd been completely wrung out. He wasn't sure he even could cry anymore. "I thought we could have normal."
Cas' eyes were bright. “Yes.”
, he was back. And there was a pillowcase over his head, for a second anyway. Then Cas was pulling out handfuls of little sample-sized KY lube bottles. Most of them went on the nightstand. But one, he kept in his hand.
"Everything."
"I didn't
Dean could feel his face burning with embarrassment. He wanted to pretend this had never happened as soon as he possibly could so they could get to the fun stuff. He kissed Jimmy quickly. "Also you. Okay done. Right. Where were we?"
"Well, you didn't
"Does talking count as moving?"
Dean laughed, which - okay, wow that felt strange with Cas deep in his ass like this. Shifting even a little made things get… interesting. He made a mental note to explore that another time. When he was less overstimulated.
"You're okay though?" Some part of Dean knew he should be more bothered by this, but Ketch was calling him pretty names and it was really hard to focus.
"You look like you're about to
But that did give him an idea. “Hey, do you think it'd make the kid feel better if she keyed my car? It'd have to seem like your idea though.
"For the record, if I say stop while you're in my ass, you should stop
Dean nuzzled his face against the happy trail leading down to Jimmy's cock. He was hanging half off the bed by now, and stopped to take in the sight before him
"No," said Cas. "You know we will always stop if you say no."
when your heart was doing the bungee jumping scene from
He put a hand on the blanket at Dean's waist and draped it over both their heads. It was just big enough to rest all around them, not letting in any of the chilly air. Dean wondered, not for the first time, if he was too broken for this. If maybe he should just stay away. If maybe Alastair was right.
too much. This wasn't
Dean didn’t want to wake up. His entire body was relaxed, he was cuddled up to something warm. He felt safe and secure and was going back to sleep. Vaguely, he remembered there was something he wanted to be awake for. That could wait. He moved to snuggle more deeply under the covers. What could be so important that he would want to leave this feeling? Nothing. That’s what.
"FUCK!" Dean held onto the sheets for dear life. And Cas
"Dean." There was a strong hand on his elbow. Dean had been here before. He knew it. As much he knew anything right now.
Dean folded in smaller on himself. Couldn’t look at them. Couldn’t make himself ask to touch them. They shouldn’t touch him. He wasn’t going to throw up. He wasn’t. "I'm sorry. I’m sorry, don’t know what went wrong, I just..."
Dean felt his breathing slow. He was less light headed. The faint screams that he hoped Cas and Jimmy couldn't hear began to fade.
Still moving incredibly slowly, Ketch carefully slid into a spooning position, warm and secure behind Dean.
Dean started giving Jimmy a lazy handjob while he talked.
Dean had to close his eyes for a second to keep from embarrassing himself. He could still have this. It didn't have to be ruined. It didn't take more than a second to get himself back together, and he hoped that Cas and Jimmy hadn’t noticed.
Jimmy scrunched up his face, like he
a big deal. So why did it feel like one? The words tumbled out in a rush -"You really want me to call you Daddy as a sex thing?"
Carefully, and cautiously, Cas leaned back into Dean's arms, turning his head to nuzzle whatever skin he could reach, mostly Dean's bicep and shoulder.
Cas hissed, and pressed into Dean to get more firmly under his hands. But Dean was teasing, and also proving a point, so he moved his fingers away from those sensitive connections, and rubbed farther down.
you, Jimmy. And I
the insanely powerful angel. "Not the same as what you can do, but I think it's pretty impressive for a human?" Anyway he thought so. That had taken practice. "Now imagine that, but on your dick."
Dean did he best to seem unaffected. "Look, I get that I'm not the man Dad wanted me to be, I do. But I thought –" He took a deep breath, it didn't help much. "I'm not Dad. I
was there?"
Jimmy gently pulled out, and started shoving all the pillows to the middle of the bed in a mound. After a brief bit of eye contact, Cas helped too. When it seemed solid enough, he sat to one side, looking at Jimmy with glittering eyes.
"Say something?" Seeking some kind of reassurance, he took Cas’ hand. This wasn’t something he’d allowed himself outside the privacy of his imagination. Not since that time with Rhonda when he was nineteen.
There were hands moving across Dean’s back, over his ass and the backs of his thighs. Then the fingers began to explore deeper.
Yeah. I'll... do that, while you finish up in there." It was only right to give a man some privacy for some things.
Then another, longer pause.
"That is not Alastair. That is not damage and lies that should be fought with all that you are. That is only pain and doubt, which can only be accepted, and forgiven."
"You're not just saying that because I like it? You don't have to, it's okay."
So if Dean’s arms were around Cas now, trying to protect the body that could take a knife or a bullet without flinching - if he had to
"I do
How could he think about anything with Cas wreaking havoc on his oversensitized body like this? Even his nipples were responding, to nothing more than the temperature of the room.
Sam looked at Dean with exaggerated concern. "You mean the salt I keep in my bag?"
He extricated himself from the two of them, enough to lie down. Enough to curl up under the trenchcoat and watch the lights move above him in this strange dark void. Cas lay down too, not quite touching, and reached out a hand for Jimmy.
He'd tortured people. He’d
"So. Where are we?"
"Just gimme a second, kitten. You're going to feel so good, I promise."
"If I can't do this, will you still love me? I want to. But if I can't?"
"I think I’ve got you exactly where I want you." Dean rolled his hips slightly, with no intention of trying to escape.
"I will tell you this every day,” Cas said. “Every day, until you believe that you saved us."
"You were so beautiful.
“I... don't know what I'm trying to say. All my words are getting mixed around. It all means..."
"At least Hell gave me that much." It wasn't a fair trade, but it was something. A hand through his hair, and he was being kissed again. Jimmy was starting to get hard. Dean wasn't having any luck there himself, but he wasn't bothered. Nothing could bother him right now.
Dean tried to refocus, "Uh… never mind. Not important. I meant -"
He reached over, curious, to poke at the discarded holster, with the crown of his head almost touching Dean.
"Yeah, but we're into it." Dean was pretty sure Cassie or Ash wouldn’t have been nearly so cool about the whole Cas thing. "You know, it's nice to have a boyfriend who also loves Cas as much as I do. Too bad you can't stay here while he goes on a supply run."
Dean was probably only imagining he could feel Cas. But he closed his eyes and let himself pretend. "He sounds pretty."
If Dean were in a better place right now, he'd have some comment about Cas running around stealing junk food without clothes on.
"You could talk to my vessel, or you could kiss him."
Cas nodded seriously. "Your brother is like me."
Jimmy had a moment of shyness, but only a moment. "We've got this picture of you taking off my tie and... tying my wrists with it?"
"This can only work if you tell me what you want,” said Cas. “That is what you told me.”
"She's his kid. Of course I'm serious."
Jimmy moved from his ankles to his knees. Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen him in so few layers before, and didn’t even try to keep his eyes from wandering.
Dean turned over so that he was facing Jimmy. But took the pillow with him.
"Okay. So God and Sir are banned in the bedroom from now on." He snaked an arm around Cas and placed a kiss on his angel's shoulder, simply because he could. "Okay. Let’s brainstorm. List sexy things until we find one to call you. We could do Angel, but that seems kind of… would that be like you calling me 'Human' or Jimmy ‘Meat-suit?’ Master’s out. What's something sexy that means you belong to someone, and like... is something you're into?"
Jimmy took a deep breath, and nodded.
Cas," he muttered.
“I'm gonna need to ask about that time Raphael turned you into meat paste, back at Chuck’s. If it’s the kind of thing you only want to explain once, I’ll get Sam. But whatever works. Just... don't overdo it.”
"The gas station? But that –"
"He doesn't know."
"The care you take with him? With his body? With his daughter?"
"Yeah."
Dean groaned, bit his lip to keep the string of nonsense pleading phrases at bay. Cas was a genius and should be promoted from angel to sex god. He laid a kiss over each closed eyelid, then turned Dean's head so he could kiss along the hairline, down to Dean's ear and divot right behind his jaw.
because you can never have too many pockets. And more places to conceal stuff. Guns. Knives. Silver. Weird shit I found at a crime scene. A live rabbit. You never know."
Dean nodded. They were already closed.
"He goes deeper than usual." And now Dean was paying attention, it was
Jimmy reached out to draw Dean closer, pet up his stocking, stroke up his thigh. “I'm going to take these panties off, for Cas. Make things easier."
"Oh. I think I like this,” Jimmy whispered. “No place for me to hide. In a good way. In a Cas way."
Not enough air.
There were hands on his back. "Oh, making us jealous isn't going to work. You're ours now, and that's all there is to it."
"So good,” said Dean. “You have no idea. Guess who I got to wake up next to?"
"You heard what we said?"
Sam shot him a bitch face. "If ever you even try to get me to wear one of those hats, you are dead to me."
Cas gasped.
He tried to approximate where he'd seen the lines of light connecting to Cas earlier, lazily tracing the path with his hands. Touching soft and slow. He didn’t want to accidentally end up hurting somebody. While Dean stroked along his shoulders, Jimmy's breaths became a whole lot heavier. He stretched, straightening out every link of his spine.
Jimmy subtly shifted his thighs to cradle Dean's hips.
"I'll say,” said Jimmy. “Well. I've just had the best sex of my life. I've just had the most amazing orgasm of my life. I know that asking you to marry me was the smartest thing I've ever done. How are you?"
Jimmy inched on top of him. Reached out to bring the zipper down the rest of the way. His hands slid along the edges of Dean’s hips, pulling off the boxer briefs and jeans. Until there was nothing left. He sighed. "You're an unfair person, you know that? I'd say something about being sculpted by the gods, except that I actually know you were put together by an angel."
Cas wasn't fighting Dean's hands anymore, and his breathing was slow.
I've seen other people do the same kind of thing, but they just end up like me, or Cas. And you're just kinda here."
Jimmy bit his lip.
"Outside the hotel you beamed me out of. Here’s hoping that street preacher passed the word along to Zach and then decided to vamoose."
And Dean took in a little more of the cock, as Cas fucked into his mouth.
"Thank you. For - " Jimmy paused, trying to find the right words. "I think I should just thank you for everything."
Dean knew he should say something good, something important, but the only thing he could think of was - "we're gonna be like a sexy Russian nesting doll."
When Jimmy pulled away, he still stayed close, foreheads touching. "I'm going to get Cas for this next part,” he murmured. “You don't have to say it. I know I'm doing the thing with the hiding. But I don't want to mess this up, I
"There's some cars out front but I guess the people just walked away? Never saw anybody. The place is locked of course, so before I can get a drink of water I have to punch out a window. I just spent forty years in Hell, but the newspaper's saying it's only been a couple months. And I know for a fact I got torn to ribbons by some hell hounds, but somehow I'm fine when I look in the mirror? The only difference is I’ve got this handprint that I definitely didn't have before. Like... next time, just give a guy your number, Cas." Dean was quick to correct himself, "Or don't. We're getting married after all."
Dean half expected to see Cas out in the bedroom. He hadn't thought he'd gotten so used to them having separate bodies. Then he found his clothes and his phone, made his way down the stairs and past the crappy sofas and weird exhibitionist window setup. At least he didn't have to worry about any concerned neighbors. Nobody liked whoever lived here. It would have been nice if there was a street sign right next to the house. There wasn't. Dean was starting to regret his choice of no shoes by the time he finally did find one. He looked both ways down the street. No one was watching. And he already looked suspicious as hell, so he sat down on the curb and dialed Sam.
Jimmy didn't have words. "Are you
"Ah - Castiel - " Ketch's voice. "What am I - what I mean is. Is there some... role I am filling?"
Even under all the compliments, Jimmy looked uncomfortable. "Kind of a thing, right? Bottoming?" He looked like he wasn’t sure he had the right word. "Lots of things that can go wrong."
"I know that this connection can hurt.” And he definitely wasn't talking to Dean. But Dean still heard him say, in a voice that was terribly soft,“You know that it
Cas blinked, and drew back dazed. He swallowed, and made a sort of abbreviated breathy sound. He looked as though he were remembering how to talk. Dean smiled fondly, and waited. Cas might have nodded, or might have just sort of bobbed. But he looked over Dean's shoulder, processing that Sam was still there. Slowly.
"So if I get this right, this should be intense. But if anything starts feeling bad, or even just weird in a way you don't like, stop me. Okay?"
Dean tried to talk, but every time he tried it felt like gravity was coming from the wrong direction. All he could do was hold on until it calmed down. He let Cas take all of his weight, closed his eyes, and waited. A hand stroked down Dean's back. And very slowly, it was as if he felt a change in the altitude, or barometric pressure.
the edge of Castiel's shoulder blade. He was going to invest in some massage oil, that's for sure. With Cas holding on to him, Dean's other hand was free to pay attention to Jimmy's cock.
"Hey there. You are." Dean looked at Sam over Cas' shoulder and mouthed ‘say something.’
"You should see yourself. Seriously, it's like you walked out of a wet dream. A really good one. I can't see you around me right now, but I know you are and I dig it. Hey," Dean's face lit up with a grin. "I know I can't feel you, but you said you could see my soul. Does that mean you can feel
Even if he'd tried, Dean couldn't have stopped his hips thrusting in search of friction. He was pretty sure he was getting even more out of this than Jimmy was.
"Kinky. You know I’d do that if I could, Cas. I love knowing I get to make love to both of you. Again."
Jimmy actually froze.
Dean let out an involuntary moan. "Fuck Jimmy, that's hot. We are... definitely going to come back to that at some point."
"You're so calm. How d'you do it?"
Dean opened his eyes again so he could see the look on Cas' face. Calm, comfortable, and focused. Dean was glad he'd told him to wait because it was hard to relax under a look that intense. It took him a few deep breaths before he could get his body to cooperate again.
Dean shook his head, reached back and got his hand in there too. Any leftover weirdness from the spell was totally gone now. Ketch's cock was back to normal, and it wouldn’t have been anywhere near enough to give him what he needed from Cas - but it was still a nice size, and very interested in things. Dean was still kind of drunk on the energy in the room. More than a little giddy about the fact Cas was still hard inside him.
Cas nodded, soberly. Then pushed himself up on his elbows, reached for Dean's hand, and kissed it. Dean sighed in annoyance.
I'd be able to understand him because I'm special or something."
"My vessel is doubtful of your ability to tie a tie."
Dean nearly choked. He made himself finish chewing.
"Is there anything that you need?"
Jimmy just seemed to want to hang on to him, nestle into him, and breathe. That was fine by Dean. He'd had sex a few times since getting out of Hell, but this was the first time he'd managed an orgasm. He’d been so afraid he wouldn't be able to. Not when he was awake, and not in actual, physical agony. He'd been ready to be okay with that. He could make Jimmy and Cas feel good, and that would be enough. So this was...
"Didn't do that. Thought about it. Chickened out. Thought - don't know what I thought."
"I'm scared, baby. I don't want to hurt you. I know what I'm doing, but it's been a while." In the back of his mind Dean was still trying not to think of how many people he’d hurt with these hands. Couldn't even ballpark how many souls he’d tortured. Couldn't undo that. But he could make Jimmy feel good.
"I think about it,” said Jimmy. “I think about you - making love to me. I... I've gotten off to it." He went hot and red.
Thought better of it.
need your brother to like me." Jimmy adjusted. "Also I feel kind of sticky, and suspect that you coming all over me has something to do with that?"
"Scared, wrong and dumb." Dean laughed. It was a jagged and bloody thing, that laugh. "Sounds more like me than you."
"Is this news to you?"
. It's just words. If I don't want something, I tell you. You saw how I said no to Naked Twister. I also really don't like foot massages. That's okay. I just want to know what you like."
, pushing shirts out of the way so he could touch skin. When his hand was over Dean’s solar plexus, he kept it there.
"Yes. We are here, the ones who love you."
Something about the matter-of-fact way Cas said things like that really got to him. “
"I'm going to teach her how to shoot. She's what, ten? Twelve? Old enough to learn to use a .22 or maybe a shotgun. At least we get her started on a BB gun.”
"That's it." Dean closed his eyes and focused on the sensation. It was always a little strange at first, but it felt good. It wasn't long before he was starting to seek out Cas' touch.
Dean kissed him because he couldn't talk. Not yet.
The shower water turned off. Jimmy draped the blanket over Dean's shoulders. "Hug?"
"Um." Jimmy was already breathing kind of hard. "Don't think I understand the question?”
Cas' hand - probably guided by Jimmy's instinct - wrapped around his half-there erection, but didn't move. His eyes were completely focused on Dean.
Dean looked for any sign Jimmy was lying. Didn't find anything. "I'm so glad you're my husband."And with that, he was grinning like he'd just stolen the coolest thing ever, and gotten away with it.
"He doesn't, but..." Jimmy wasn’t finding the right words. A little annoyed, "Angel rest is complicated. Like, a more intense version of cuddling? Whatever that is?" He laughed, and brought his arm more tightly around Cas' shoulders. "Mostly it’s something you do with other angels, but seems watching you and me getting along so well qualifies."
"Ground control to Major Tom?"
Cas kissed him deeply. A hand stroked down his ribcage, over his hip, and came to rest on his ass - before Cas jerked himself up, annoyed. He needed both hands to work the little thing of lube, and as he flicked open the cap and squirted into his hand, he stared at the bottle like it had offended him.
"Say please.”
There was a little moment that might have been Jimmy and Cas holding hands, or might have been Cas passing Jimmy something. It was only after Dean felt Jimmy's fingers, cool and slick between his legs, that he remembered
If Cas was actually visiting his dream instead of just featuring in it, there was probably a reason. He should ask about that. But instead, he draped arms around both men sitting beside him. Sandwiched between the two of them, he was comfortable even in the chilly air. If he looked behind him, he knew the house would be gone. They were in the middle of a field, the whole place covered in lightning bugs, sitting by a campfire burnt down to embers. Neither of his companions moved, but somehow they both had arms wrapped around him.
"Permission to speak freely, soldier?" said Jimmy.
Dean laughed and wiped his nose one last time before drying his eyes on Cas' clothes. He struggled to find words that wouldn't start him crying again. But before he could, Cas turned his head to kiss a few of the tears away. And Jimmy cheated out a little so Dean was able to see his dick - almost painfully hard and leaking.
Dean parted his legs. Cas was using a lot of lube, and rubbing it into the skin just – everywhere. So much lube that Dean had a stray thought about wasting it, but then, it
"Dean, talk to me, what's happening?"
"Claire will probably think you're kind of dumb, at first," said Jimmy.
"I don't think it's up to you to say what's sexy." He smiled at Dean. "You're ours. We decide. And you don't worry about it."
And the thought of Alastair nearly threatened to bring everything to a halt again.
And a stray thought was all it took. And suddenly Dean wasn't sure if he could do this anymore. He was still ready to try – but made himself stop. Whatever he was trying to prove didn’t matter. If this went badly Cas would blame himself. Dean couldn't do that to him.
“That's why you're
“Then why are you holding onto my neck.”
Jimmy brought himself up to kiss Dean. "Don't you dare apologize, okay? Don't you dare."
Dean made his body even tighter and smaller. The lights above him blurred. He blinked back most of the tears.
"It'll probably feel like two different dicks, honestly. I bet we fuck pretty differently.”
"I have done my vessel a disservice by seeing a fearful soul instead of a damaged one. After you fucked him, there were many old fears he lost. I suppose sodomy was one of them."
Jimmy stroked along his ribcage. "You're kinda cute when you're embarrassed."
Jimmy rubbed Dean's back through the coat.
"I was thinking if I grew mine out a little, I could get some friction against your thighs while I took your cock in my mouth."
"Okay, buddy. What I've heard is that you nearly died, Castiel nearly died, I
, and grabbed Dean harder, pulling him closer. His head dropped onto Dean’s shoulder, breathing high and fast and shallow.
He picked up where he left off, kissed his way to the center of Jimmy's chest before coming back up to steal a quick kiss. He got to be the one to walk Jimmy through this. Or he would, if he could stop kissing long enough. And Jimmy was not helping, hanging on to every kiss Dean gave him, straining up as he tried to keep him flat to the mattress. "You're lucky you have such a gorgeous cock. Or I'd just want to keep doing this. And I'd never get around to doing you."
Like. Sure Cas had been dead before, splattered across the walls of Chuck’s house like sick modern art. That had been bad, but at least he’d gone out fighting. This time... Dean had watched him die in that bleak, bombed out future Zachariah sent him to, where Lucifer was wearing Sam’s body, and Dean had turned cruel. The sort of person who sent Cas to his death casually. For nothing. For a distraction.
a freakin
"I feel him as temperature, mostly," said Jimmy, drawing a line along Dean's inner forearm, down to his wrist. "I'm touching when I see him against your skin. But he's also texture. Like - something very dense. Like velvet." Jimmy ran his fingers in a circle against Dean's palm. "Or - vibrations. Like a loose electric wire. But thinner."
"Sammy." He thought he did an okay job keeping emotion out of his voice. Sam could probably tell, but Jimmy might not. "A little help here?"
. This was Cas, not Alastair. He
Cas swiveled his intense stare onto Sam. "I am in your debt.”
Jimmy scrunched up his face. "I gave you some pretty bad dialog. 'Bet you've never had someone give you their nice fat cock before, huh pretty boy?' That kind of stuff. Also you were wearing the leather jacket."
"Of course..." said Cas. "Could my vessel and I visit you in your dreams?"
"It should probably be more..." Dean tried to find the right word, "Hands on? I mean, I could just
Dean pulled back again. He wasn’t quite ready. Soon. He nuzzled softly against the skin of Castiel’s thighs, kissing one of Jimmy’s femoral pressure points. It was reassuring, to know if anything happened, he could stop arterial bleeding long enough to apply a tourniquet. He did the same thing on the other side. Between Cas and himself, they could keep Jimmy safe.
And then Cas' other hand was there, and bless Jimmy's influence because now Cas knew to cup his balls lightly at the same time he was stroking his cock, thumb starting to expertly swirl around the head on the upstroke. Dean was usually a more attentive lover, but this was different. The hands on him were light and so damn careful in a way he'd forgotten. Forty years in Hell - was a long time.
"I wasn't. Honest. I just meant that it's a really nice bed. I actually got some sleep."
"I had some people I wanted to say goodbye to first. Figured he wouldn't let me. You got me out of there before I had a chance to try negotiating."
As Jimmy buried his head in Dean's neck to stifle his giggles, Castiel kissed Dean deep and slow.
Castiel was silent.
"You thought things were bad when you got back? You should have seen when you left. Yeah, I'm sure." There wasn't any anger in his voice, only affection. Self-deprecating, not hostile.
"That's right.” Sam started to consolidate the food into fewer containers. “So, you and Jimmy are hunting with us now?"
"Sammy - " Dean sighed and gave up. The last thing he needed was Sam to be
“You know who I am?" There was heat in Jimmy's voice. "I'm the small town salesman who ran away with his secretary and left his wife and child behind.
"Can't be too smart. He did agree to marry me." But Dean was grinning. "Don't tell Bobby yet."
“Hey.” It was like trying to befriend a particularly skittish animal. “Look at me?"
"It will be necessary if you want me to surrender to you."
you wanted to talk to Cas."
Dean's fingernails were digging into Jimmy's skin, but he couldn't make himself let go. If he did, Jimmy would leave him here.
Cas took the hand he was holding and dropped kisses along the wrist and palm, before sucking Dean's thumb into his mouth. Cas made eye contact, and sucked a little more deliberately. He probably didn't need to read Dean’s mind to know where his thoughts went.
Then he began to swallow around him again, setting a pace that was just insanely slow. The visual
Dean came up for air long enough to get that knife away from him, throw it into the far wall. He was kissing Cas again before it hit its target. He knew it would hit. He was good at this, and it was an excellently weighted knife.
“You did what you’re supposed to do,” said Sam. “Kept him warm. Told him you loved him. Held him, once you figured he was okay with that.” He smiled sadly. “And you’re about the only person here who asks for help. Keep doing that.”
Dean swore.
"Appreciate the offer, but we just came from a place with a really nice bed. If Cas feels up to it, I'd kinda like to go back. So unless anybody has more questions?”
." Then Dean said, quieter. "They were going to get married."
"… she'd be right."
Jimmy bent down to kiss Dean. "I'm gonna pull out real quick, pretty thing, but it's just so I can get you to a better position. You'll have my cock again real soon."
Jimmy laughed, and twisted under Dean's hot almost-bites. "What are you, sixteen?"
Dean obeyed without thinking. His mind was so quiet for once. Wasn't listening for potential threats or scanning the exits. Didn't have to try not to think, about things he'd rather forget. The stillness was effortless. Cas played his other hand through Dean’s hair, pushing it back and away from his face.
"Yes?" Jimmy's voice sounded so ragged that it could have been Cas'.
"Don't think he's even
Cas balanced him, maneuvering things so Dean's legs were around his waist and his hands supported his ass. He backed them both into the shower, the perfect temperature from before. It was nice, having someone be this thoughtful. Letting himself be pampered. Cas wasn’t going to drop him.
, and it had been so long since he'd come...
"Tell him how you answered," he said, lips almost touching.
Cas kissed each palm in turn. "You have saved the lives of each of us. You are loved. Feel free and safe to tell us whatever you wish."
Jimmy sat back on his heels, between Dean's spread thighs, and then he was sliding a pillow underneath his hips, and grabbing one of Cas' little bottles of lube. Then there were cool fingers touching his thighs, gentle circular motions. Dean had said it once already, but he had to say it again. He wasn't even slightly afraid. "I'm so proud of us."
"C'mon." Jimmy pulled him into the spray of the shower.
And Dean's cock was officially showing signs of life now.
Dean stopped teasing and used two fingers to lightly trace the curvature of each shoulder blade. His touch was more substantial now, but not by much. Jimmy rolled up against his body, and one of his thighs dropped between Dean's legs. He made a soft cry, found Dean's mouth again.
"You can talk. You can touch. Tell me what feels good, what doesn't. Don't worry about holding back. Don't like... fuck my mouth or anything. This isn't a dream, I need to breathe and I have a gag reflex, but other than that? We're fine. You know, I wanted to wake you up with a blowjob this morning. But turns out you were too busy fucking Cas."
Cas kind of huffed. "We don't
“Ear protection."
"That's not the only part of me that's hard, thank - " Dean remembered their earlier conversation about taking the lord's name in vain in the bedroom, "Thank
Jimmy started to scrub Dean's scalp. He didn't say anything.
"Cas said." And Dean had to stop, he was laughing so hard. He eventually managed a perfectly neutral expression. "'I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from Perdition.'" He couldn’t quite manage to keep a straight face the whole way through, and ended in laughter and a kiss, both directed towards Cas.
A knock on the bathroom door. "Hey buddy?"
Cas stroked Dean's hips before holding them there, solid. He bent down to Dean's cock again, and this time began to kiss teasingly up the shaft, and drop a single kiss right on the head that wasn't nearly enough.
"Will you let me kiss you?” said Cas.
"I'll be fine in a second,” said Jimmy.
Cas was looking back at him with those huge, earnest eyes. Dean had to look away.
Just as solemnly, Sam bowed his head.
Dean decided to abandon all pretense of dignity in favor of comfort. "Can we cuddle while you talk?" The thought that they could cuddle in a dream, and he could be in the middle… that made him happy.
Laying there with him, in the dim light, under that familiar coat - Dean felt like maybe he could talk. He still didn't want to, but maybe he could. Jimmy pulled the sheet over their heads into a tent-like situation.
your beautiful, sensitive asshole.
"My vessel is trying to take responsibility for that, but it was my hand."
Realizing what he'd said, Dean hid his face in Castiel's neck. He did
"You have,” said Cas quietly. “Fucked me,"
"Sam Winchester. We are in your debt."
"Lucky you." Dean was all pillow-talk. "I thought this was how I could touch him. And here you are with him inside you all the time."
"Um. Time, it – gets weird for me. Not in a bad way. But, probably not for a while?” Jimmy looked embarrassed. “I don't think I sweat anymore though.”
As soon as his leg was no longer trapped, Dean pulled Cas back into his arms, and fell backwards against the mattress.
Dean smiled. "Thanks, Cas."
"It is too much to ask of you." But there was still a tiny question in Cas’ voice.
"Okay,” said Sam. "Message received. Put me on speaker. Let's go talk to Cas."
He’d paused too long. Sam had to know something was up.
"Look in my eyes," said Cas. "And tell me you do not believe this matters to me."
"This
The Oreo tower was putting the tower of Babel to shame and very nearly suffered the same fate before Dean decided to stop. On second thought, he decided there might actually be such a thing as too much Oreo stuffing, and split his frankencookie in half. He held one out to Cas. "Hey, want one?”
Wait. There didn’t seem to be any covers, and the chest he was asleep on seemed to be attached to a person. Which, all things considered, was better than the alternative. He had been right, about that reason to wake up. Cas must’ve have done something, because this was the best sleep he’d ever had in his
... but then, he was guilty of looking at Cas and seeing, well,
suspicious. He walked into his brother's room, sat on the foot of the bed, and opened the laptop. And started to type one-handed, because he didn’t want to let go of Cas.
But Jimmy blushed, and pushed up a little into Dean's hand "I think maybe I'm offended."  He stretched his fingers. "Maybe you need a little more of me."
Jimmy relaxed against him, all tension gone. And as Dean held him, he changed. Cas broke the grip easily, and then was above Dean, hands on his shoulders, pushing him down into the mattress.
, but Jimmy was setting the pace here.
if these people are weird exhibition fetishists, I
Dean was diving for his shoes and his knife. It must have fallen under the bed somewhere when Cas knocked over the lamp. And his pants were gone. Did he need a crucifix for holy water if he had a literal angel? He didn't know. If they survived, he'd find out.
" Cas nuzzled at his sensitive cock. "I see your nipples and dilated pupils, and the heat rising from your body."
"Yes. Yes, I'm... Dean, I... May I touch your cock?" The words seemed hard for him. He said them anyway.
"She killed a man and saw you nearly die. She's not okay."
"Eugh,
Jimmy kissed him, and the kiss lingered.
There was a rustling over Dean's shoulder.
He took a long, satisfied exhale. Then came a little closer. "Cas, just look at that beautiful dick, wrapped up in all that gorgeous lace." Jimmy pressed his hand against it, "Think he might be getting hard for us." His other hand was sliding over the curve of Dean's ass, and tucking fingers underneath the lacy garment. "It's not elastic..." Jimmy muttered to himself, "It's got to have maybe, buttons..." He stroked a hand slowly between Dean's legs, until he found the first snap holding the crotch together, and unpopped it.
"Of course he did." He and Cas were going to want to talk about that, but it could wait. "Actually, maybe we are staying here? I think they might be asleep. Damn, I was really -"
Jimmy looked between them, overwhelmed by the attention of both Winchester brothers at once. “But...”
Some dull metallic noises as Sam started to move the guns off the bed.
“You don’t have to say anything,” Jimmy backtracked. “You can, obviously you
Cas was able to run hands down Dean’s back and over his ass now. Take his lips again. Dean moved his hips in tiny little circles, chasing after that feeling as he kissed Cas like he needed him to breathe.
But he wasn't in a good place right now.
"Hold me." Dean cleared his throat sheepishly. "Please?"
Jimmy looked at him seriously. "Just so long as you don't think you owe
"Hello, Sam."
"I think I was getting pinned to a bed by someone I can only describe as sex incarnate. And I'm hoping they'll tell me how to make it up to them for laughing."
Cas' breathing had changed. Gotten more ragged. Dean clenched down on Cas' cock again and used his entire body to pull the two of them close.
Dean didn't say anything. Just took small, gasping breaths as he held on too tight. He was trembling, but not even Cas with all his strength could have pried him away from Jimmy. He made a strange sound, between laughter and tears. "I didn't mean to ask you to
"Remember how you wanted me to kiss you earlier, and I wanted to kiss you, but I asked you first? I was mostly just teasing, but it was good, right?"
"Because you're beautiful? And you're brave. You make me brave. I'm not actually, I'm actually kind of a coward. You're the only guy I might actually see myself trusting enough... to let him make love to me."
"I do not know. I have similar fears. I feel more right than I did."
"You wish. Of the two of us, I'm the guy who has an entire angel inside him right now."
"Yeah. And can’t forget about the angel looking out for both of us."
" He hid his face in a pillow to try to muffle the laughing, and once that was out of his system he sat back up and looked at Cas. "Never change."
a body in Hell. He didn't want to think too hard about the implications about the state of his soul.
"This... this is enough..." Cas said. "Your breath. Your small sounds of pleasure. The way you feel around my body..."
"Hey babe." Dean shifted to support more of their weight. He was never 100% sure when they switched, but didn’t want to let them know that.
way to form a connection?”
Dean had a stray thought that if they ever decided to settle down and become respectable members of society, the three of them could probably make a decent living as porn stars, considering the whole twin thing Cas and Jimmy had going on without actually being related. It took a second to realize just how many things were wrong with that idea. He kept it to himself.
. And no one believes you, and it keeps telling you it's hungry because it's draining fluid from your spine with its creepy little mouth. Because
"Better?" said Jimmy.
"I love you," said Jimmy. "Sorry if this isn't the best time to say it, but I do. Sorry. I can't think of anything else."
was enough to make Dean feel a bit of that strange sensation of floating again.
You mean you’re telling me that I'm totally
Dean got down on the floor with him, and pulled Cas into a hug. "Let’s get back under the blanket, and then we can talk, okay? It's cold out here."
"Dean..." said Cas. There were huge blue eyes fixed on him. "How... do you know to... warp the rules of your dreams... for my pleasure?
Jimmy gave Dean a thumbs up. "Two tickets to the gun show,
"You have taken such care with me, and with my vessel."
Jimmy was breathing so heavily. And still talking, swearing - it sounded like swearing. But maybe not swearing in
just didn't know what was going on with physical bodies, did you?"
Castiel was still touching the burn mark. Then he bent, and it felt like a bow, and kissed it.
. I want you inside me. I didn't feel this way before I met you... don't tease me. Don't tease me right now.” And slightly apologetically, "I mean. Slow me down, if you think that’s right. But... you'll do that anyway.”
as every inch of his hot and too-hard cock disappeared into Cas’ body, and he could feel the cool silkiness of the lube, and he could feel how tight Jimmy was, and how
And slowly, Jimmy rolled Dean's shoulder back to look at him. "Dean..."
"Jimmy...” Dean said. “I want him comfy a lot more than I want an orgasm. That fantasy we had? What part of it spilled over into too much?"
It definitely wasn't all that surprising, and it wasn't something he wanted to take advantage of, but Cas was
say it. "That whole not letting me wake up alone thing?"
. A hand cupped his cheek as Cas made a sound that might have been a word, or the start of a word, but mostly sounded like a relieved exhale. Dean pulled back to pay special attention to the tip, running his tongue around the edge and playing with the slit.
"I told you, I locked myself in the bathroom. I know, enclosed space with no way out. Bad plan. Didn't know what else to do." Honestly, it hadn't been a plan at all. He just didn't want to have to see all that crap Cas brought him. It had been almost thoughtful. In a different context, it might even have been nice. That's probably why it hurt so much.
. I - I am so out of my depth here it's not even funny. Tried to help. Messed up." He started to laugh, and his laugh got a little out of control. "Six months ago I was married and selling ad time in Illinois."
"If there were a way we could share Cas, I'd say yes to that in a second. Doesn't seem like there is. So we get to share you instead."
Cas sighed. "Do you want punishment for what you did there, Dean? Would that help you feel clean?”

“Pretty much what it sounds like. He goes until it’s too much, then keeps on going. You know how chicks can have multiple orgasms? I told you prostate orgasms were different. If you know what you're doing, they can be
what he was going to say was stupid, like it was actively painful to say.
A long sigh of contentment.
"I changed. But mostly Cas. And..."
"No that... good,” said Sam. “That's good.” A pause. He was maybe in the middle of processing. "
made Jimmy shut his eyes, and calm himself down with more breathing. Dean pet his hair, made shushing noises.
didn't want to talk about this. It shouldn't be this hard to figure out what was going to trigger him and what wasn't. He wished there was a blanket or something he could hide under, but settled for the next best thing, and grabbed a pillow to hide his face. He felt like crying, which was
. But could you - it feels like I've got stage fright or something - could you, keep a hand on my belly? Something like that?"
"This is safe. I'm safe. And I don't think I actually age. I've got all the time there is.” Jimmy's fingers combed through his hair. “I like your weight on top of me. I like feeling you between my legs. I like looking up and seeing you, looking at me like
Dean's hips juddered as his fingers dug into the muscles of Cas' back. There were so many things he wanted to say in that moment, but none of them were anything he could ever put into words. Collapsing backwards onto the bed, pulling Cas down with him, Dean lost himself in his lover. There was nothing else. Everything in existence was contained there, on that bed, the only thing that mattered was the connection between them. With wordless, gasping breaths, Dean gave himself over completely to Cas, made himself a willing vessel for Castiel to use as he pleased. His, and no one else's.
"I was talking Yellow-Eyes type stuff. What were
Dean felt himself starting to panic and he didn't know why or about what. He'd be okay. He was just scared. He'd be okay. He just had to remember to breathe. He wasn't even sure what he was afraid of. Everything was okay.
There
“What, why – Oh, right.” His brain caught up with his mouth. “You didn't know what edging was. Look, I haven't
"You'll let me know if you start feeling different?"
Dean paused to play with Cas' slit before stopping long enough to say, "Yes, Daddy. Can I have a kiss?" Belatedly, he realized he had forgotten one of the important rules. "Can I have a kiss
"Put me down. Don't let go. I just want my feet under me."
A body again. This one real. This one here. Dean was trying to remember how to breathe as he held on to Jimmy. It only lasted for an instant, but time worked differently in Hell. He focused on the feeling of Jimmy’s heartbeat and the gentle rise and fall of his chest. Dean tried to match his breathing.
Jimmy's cheek was against Dean's chest. He was quiet. Dean stayed silent for a minute too. "I wish he hadn't shown you that." His own voice sounded too much like the cold version of himself from that awful demon-virus future. He took a deep breath. Exhaled slowly.
"My vessel is here as well."
he was sure he'd start crying again. Or worse.
And then they were standing in a tiny, dark living room with matching fake-leather couches and nothing on the walls. The place was cold and impersonal, a timeshare where no one could agree on the decor. And it made Dean nervous. Especially those three huge floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out over the dark, empty street. They made him really nervous.
Dean didn't move. Orders got him into this mess. "It's fine. Just need the computer. I'll give it back."
Dean made another quiet happy noise. He felt loved.
"But the shower and bed both include you."
Jimmy's knees - still in his slacks - were bent, and he rested his wrists on top of them. "Yeah. See you on the other side. Call me if you need me." He exhaled long and slow, tipping his head back.
"You are so good for me,” Cas continued, “and so good for my vessel, in this moment, as you respond so unguarded and open. Our good boy."
"You told me to spread my legs and asked if you could kiss me and the whole time, I’m keeping this mantra going about how 'This is Cas. You can trust him. It's fine. There's nothing to worry about. He's just kissing you. He won't bite.' And like, yeah. It's great you kept your teeth to yourself and I'm not screaming in agony right now, but it still really fucking hurts, okay? I quit. I'm done. Find someone else to save the world. Let Sam do it. He was always the smarter one anyway. Tell Jimmy he doesn't totally suck, and I'm sorry. Just go. Or stay. I don't care." That was a lie. He cared a lot.
different idea about when to call for backup."
His brother dead in his arms. Snapping muzzles. Suspended by hooks in deafening silence broken only by the sound of his own screams. Kissing a demon at a crossroads while he bargained away something he didn't even want anymore. Riding Alastair's cock as the demon lay there, looking almost disinterested while he watched Dean fuck himself.
"Boyfriends." Sam gave Dean a long, level look. He crossed his arms. "An hour ago I was hearing that Castiel was your prison daddy. Sorry, Cas, if you know what that is. And ten minutes ago, you were
"What? No, why would you-”
" If Dean had clothes on, he'd be up and pacing. "Who the
He would stay like this, for however long Cas needed.
Cas carded fingers through his hair, rhythmically. “Maybe you would like to coax yourself open, show us how you like to be touched?”
"See, I actually really like lube,” said Jimmy. “Even when you don't
He just looked so gooey, and so
Dean couldn't look him in the eyes. He was silent for a while, and when he did speak it was barely a whisper. Nowhere near loud enough to be picked up on speakerphone. "I'm so sorry. I should have known. You were patient with me. Even when I did that weird thing and fell asleep on you. You just held me, made sure I felt safe." Dean kissed one of the hands before returning to a normal speaking volume. "I can explain.” He kept his head bowed and his eyes closed. “By the time you got back..."
Jimmy was leaning over him, smiling."Cas wants to say thank you. He loved watching us together.
Cas was being. With both of them.
Unmistakable.
"Tell me if I do something you don't like." Cas said, and titled Dean into the spray, letting the water pressure get at his back and hair.
Then Dean felt Cas' hand drop lower. Ketch sputtered, pulled away. "No. No, there's - no need for that."
"Dean. Thank you for this. Thank you for being ours."
Jimmy took his hand. And Cas turned towards them, making careful, serious eye contact. There were more lightning bugs around him now, radiating out from him like a snowflake.
"Is Cas listening? Because I'm going to do something."
Cas pulled off his dick
me to tell you?" Disobeying direct orders had carried a heavy punishment. That line of thought held a lot of bad memories, but it did give him an idea.
He traced Dean's tattoo, idly.
us so. Oh Dean, what did he do to you?”
to feel like it had totally erased all of Alastair's fingerprints from his skin.
Cas nodded. A pause. Then, one of Cas' hands covered his. Guided by Castiel, and his strength, Dean softly moved his hand along his angel's back. And the moment his fingers brushed the very edge of Cas' shoulder blade, Cas made a noise that sounded like a
"So an idea here? Cas, I'm thinking that it might be good for you to get to know Jimmy's body too? If he’s up for that. I can give you guys your space, or stay. I mean I'd like to stay, but if you don't want me to stay I get it. Only..." Dean trailed off as Cas' eyes went from confused, to the fuzzed-out non-focus of the Cas-Jimmy in-between.
, let alone him. But at least it was better than being naked, and the shoulders were definitely going to be big enough. Once he put it on, it almost looked like he was wearing some kind of ugly short dress. Giving up on the sleeves, Dean stuck his arms through the neck hole and tied them around the back.
"But now there's something I can
"The inside of my head is a mess, Cas. Promise me, if I'm having a nightmare, or worse. You won't bring him in there with you. He doesn't need to see that."
"Hey, Cas. Are
"Oh fuck that's hot." Dean found his voice again.
Neither Castiel nor Sam were speaking.
"Did you finger yourself and imagine it was me? I'm betting no, but you were so good to me earlier. Like you knew what you were doing. So either you've done it before, or you've thought about it a lot."
not just your physical form. But I can touch you! I can't feel you, but I can
"What, you're picturing explaining how salt works as a battle situation?"
" Dean held up a Stanford sweatshirt that was probably the biggest size they made. “This thing could probably fit two people. Like. Two human people. Not a vessel situation."
Another kiss to his neck. Cas repositioned his body, turning him so he could kiss his earlobe. Dean hummed in contentment. This was still weird, but less weird because his eyes were closed. Then his head was dropped back. Cas was holding him up to kiss his Adam's apple, his clavicle. It was hard to remember not to move, but he managed it.
"He knows. Smug bastard. Don't know what it is, but he
"Yeah. That other place had a nice bed. And our clothes."
Cas nodded. "I had it all at once, when I came back to my vessel's mind. Emotions. Some details. Emotions matter more to him." He smoothed his hands down Dean's neck and shoulders. And ended, of course, at the handprint.
Cas nodded. And so very slowly, he leaned over Dean to take Jimmy's face in his hands. He kissed his mouth, and cheekbones, and nose, and forehead, and the lids of his eyes. Jimmy was kissing too, kissing away Cas' tears.
He was on a bed. He could see the surface. But the current kept pulling at him and he was getting tired.
He'd gone from seductive to self-conscious way faster than he would have liked. But at least Jimmy knew he was only pretending to be a badass most of the time. And seemed to like him anyway.
said Dean, against his lips. “The lube’s still in the bathroom."
Dean shook his head. That wasn't it. He was pretty sure that wasn't it. It was hard to think, much less explain. He felt… he didn’t know. Everything had been so good before, but the warm feeling of safety had taken a claustrophobic turn somewhere.
realized." Dean paused. Should he tell Sam? Was it better to get it out of the way now, before they were all stuck in a car together?
“I will come alone."
Jimmy had his fingers around the tops of the panties, pulling them away. This required touching Dean's ass and also his dick kind of a lot more than was probably strictly necessary.
"Mmmm. I'm thinking, he sucks your cock while I push into him nice and slow?"
Cas had done up the buttons, but not to their corresponding button-holes. "Please?"
Cas put a hand on Jimmy's shoulder. The two of them made a long second of eye contact.
"Would you want to touch us, if we let you move again?"
Dean hummed happily around the angel's cock and scooted closer, until his nose was nestled in the dark thatch of hair. Dreams were great. No gag reflex. The fingers in his hair tightened, but Cas didn't pull or push him anywhere. Cas didn't do that kind of thing.
"Right. Just... Don’t know how on top of things you were back then, but you saved me from him. Twice. And were there when I woke up. I mean,
"Remember to put quotation marks around it, if you’re searching for a phrase."
"Yeah, yeah. I'll see you soon."
"He misses the other angels.” He was curled up into Dean's side. "A lot of them were bad and dangerous, but a lot were cool. Watchers. Healers - they've got cupids even. They know all sorts of things. Crazy
for taking care of
Dean was so mad at himself. He stared at the ceiling and let out an angry sigh. "I'm sorry. I want you inside me. I just... not today. Maybe not... ever. But I want you."
“Hi.” Definitely Jimmy’s higher voice. “Dean. Nice to see you. Ah...” He swayed. “Castiel just dropped me in, didn’t give too much warning. It’s good. I’m fine. Give me a second.”
"They left? Did they know we were here?" Calm, but high alert.
"I will. But you and Sam, you're the ones that are still standing. Even Cas and me needed a respawn. Which is why I'm really glad
That brought Dean back to himself real quick. "Yeah. Of course. We don't even have to actually get married if you don't want. If she wanted to stay married to you on paper because taxes."
"Dr. Sexy's got nothin' on you. And you don't even have cowboy boots."
"You do too much, I know. But I would still ask you - for your help, in this. My vessel does deserve better."
"I got it. Thanks." Dean took the towel and tied it around his waist, but things still felt a little unreal as he searched around the bedroom for their clothes.
He could probably just use the trench coat as a pillow. And pillows were a luxury, so all things considered he had a pretty nice setup going on here. "I'm tired of being used and then treated like crap, you know? Family's great. They don't just friggin abandon you after you tear your heart out for them. I feel like that poor dude at the end of
Jimmy got tense. "The second you think it's safe enough for us to see them. The second you're sure no one is following us. That's what we'll do."
"... that is enough."
He looked upwards, not at Dean, and seemed to get bigger somehow. Heavier. And when he looked back down - it was Castiel straddling Dean's body, and Castiel's eyes looking at him. He put two hands on the offending garment, ripped it off like a band-aid. Surveyed Dean beneath him. Put his hand over the handprint burn mark. Just needed that one arm to pin Dean to the mattress.
as though he were fully planning on kissing Dean forever.
"If I put you on speakerphone, do you promise not to make fun of me?"
"You're cute."
"Please don't." Dean couldn't do this. He was tired of hurting.
"Hey..." Jimmy tucked his knees under him as he sat up. "I've got Cas, and now Sam it sounds like. I’ve got you. I’m safe.”
"I don't care." Dean was really starting to feel sick.
shows up. Blows all the windows in on me. I think he just wanted to say hi, but got kind of excited."
before your partner climaxes, and you do that a couple times and like... that’s for later."
He rested his head against Cas and smiled. Took a deep breath. "Smell so good, Cas." Cas was stroking Dean’s hair, with strong fingers. Warm, comforted. No awful twisting hunger eating away inside of him.
obvious that Cas’ breathing was slower, his eyelids lower, his shoulders rolled back.
The breeze was cool and the sunlight was warm, as Dean sat on the steps of the porch holding his beer. Lisa would be by soon to pick up Ben, but he already had his things together. Claire was helping him fly one of those styrofoam gliders with the wings that fall off. He was getting better, but the angle was still too steep. Every time, it would stall and crash back to earth, falling to pieces.
He turned his face to kiss the inside of Castiel's wrist.
"What does that even
"Well done, soldier." Dean returned his hand to Castiel's back. Sliding the pad of his spit-slick thumb along the edge of one of Cas' shoulder blades. Exactly where the angel had placed his hand earlier.
"Dean? Dean, come on, you need to talk to me."
"I'm also wanted for multiple homicides. That's harder to fix. I've been hunted by the FBI. Haunted by the FBI, even. I think that's the last time I died on paper? But I’ll figure something out." Thank god Sam studied law. "What music do you like? Name a musician."
"I want to kiss my way along the inside of your thighs and lick that gorgeous V of your hip bones."
“Let go. Lean back in my arms. Let your head fall.”
Once Dean felt his knees hit the edge of the bed, he sort of toppled over onto it, bringing Jimmy with him. The bedsprings screamed in protest. There was a chance Sam had managed to find the single crappiest motel room that also still had electricity. No way Dean was going to let Cas and Jimmy stay here. They deserved better.
Because now Jimmy was
in the middle of a parking lot. In Missouri."
"I guess Cas had - scars? Wrong bits. You could tell, looking at him, that some things didn't quite match? But it’s like… the things that don’t match kind of gave you vertigo? There were places where a pattern just ended, or two patterns came together, and was
"Sounds right. Not to mention they both look drop dead gorgeous, and I like sharing them with you." Dean dropped the flirty tone in favor of genuine affection. "Baby's the closest thing I've got to a place that feels like home."
"But it's not like I'm going to wait that long to have you unwrap me." Dean continued kissing his way southwards, but brought a hand up to keep playing with Jimmy's nipples.
Too late. The voice was clear, a strange rumbling chuckle followed by a voice that was nasal and almost oily, if that was even a way a voice could sound.
"It's a lot easier when we talk about things. And I asked Jimmy to kiss me before he went to get you, and it was really good for both of us. This can work if you tell me what you want. Some people think that's not sexy, but some people are idiots, and I can prove it. Want me to?"
"I am arbitrating," said Sam, completely deadpan. "I have taken a Psych 101 course."
"Bitch," was Dean's partially muffled response. He had people looking out for him. That was good.
There was dried come in his leg hair. Also he really needed to wash his hands.
"Yes to all of that except Naked Twister."
allowed to end without Jimmy getting to see his kid again.
"So good, my Dean. We feared this would be too much for you. But look how you love it."
"Say the part about trusting me again?"
freak outs. Oh, Dean."
Now Dean was the one blushing. He tried to use Jimmy's body to hide his red flush. Made a noncommittal noise, sort of acknowledging that Jimmy had said something.
Dean wrapped himself up even tighter in Jimmy's trench coat. Told himself Jimmy needed his space. Didn’t want Dean to touch him. Dean could understand that.
"My vessel and I could touch you with two bodies, in your dreams. I can accomplish this."
"Cas. Stop.”
Jimmy and Cas made eye contact. Jimmy smiled. Dean thought that telepathic communication thing they did was cute. It should have been unsettling, but it was just normal. The only difference was they had two bodies instead of just one.
" Jimmy pulled off to the side. "I'm bringing him back online. You know he is one hundred percent literal about everything he just said, right?"
Dean just dropped the lube. He kept a steady rhythm, between the stroke of his fingers and the movement of his head. Even once Jimmy started thrusting, he could keep control of things with the hand around the base of his cock. He started applying a little more pressure, with each motion of his fingers. Still gentle, but persistent.
"I only saw the sequel, and I saw it because of sexy priest Obi-wan."
. Being his first was like…. there wasn’t really anything to compare it too. He closed his eyes and let himself get lost in the rhythmic motions, the warm weight on his tongue. He felt powerful and safe. He reveled in the chance to kneel here freely, and give pleasure because it pleased him to do so. Opening his eyes, he watched as he did his best to make good on that promise of making Cas fall apart.
"How do you want me?"
“Lilith. That’s my safeword. If I say that, for any reason, you need to stop.”
"It wasn't Zachariah. Gotta say this. Could you maybe just... hold me for a sec? But first....uh, I need to get something." Dean sat, and rearranged things so that he was holding the trench coat like a child would a blanket. His ears were burning with shame, but he didn't know how else he'd be able to get through this. "Cas knows I love him, right? This isn't his fault. I'm not scared of
Cas let him down, into the more exposed wedding carry. "You are being so good for me."
"My vessel thought it would be better if he talked to you without my emotional shadow. He was right. I would have been angry. It would not have helped. So I stretched myself in a long line out from him, and spent time in the clouds. The sky was beautiful."
"She's our kid!"
Sam was very much there, leaning against the strange non-entrance entrance with his floofy hair and looking way too pleased with himself.
"Not even a thing. Also, I told you to shut up? We're fine."
“I guess he could have been making fun of me. That might make more sense. God, I'm an idiot. He had this whole thing planned! Those markings on our ribs." Dean looked at his chest, knowing that somewhere under his skin, it probably said 'property of Castiel.’ He couldn't read that stuff. "Like... it could be worse. He didn't try to castrate me with his teeth or make me call him Daddy, but he wrote on you too. That's just sick. Why'd he have'ta bring you into this?"
He slipped out of bed, giving Cas' ass a playful squeeze. Cas caught the hem of the oversized sweatshirt, dragged it over his head, and Dean freed himself with a laugh before darting out of reach.
Very carefully, and very slowly, the fingers lifted and Cas' eyes were there again. He looked concerned. The patterns behind him were no longer lightning and plasma, but softer, lightning bugs again. Jimmy was sort of half-draped over the back of the couch. If he didn't have his eyes open in a kind of fuzzy happiness, he would have looked passed out.
"He says he gives very good foot massages."
way was letting a hundred people who wanted to hurt you do that same thing. And after a while, you start to seek out that horrible person, and ask for it. Even though you don't want it, just because afterwards you feel less alone for a while. You figure you hurt so much already, it doesn't really make much of a difference." Dean had to stop for a moment. Catch his breath. "It was like with Alastair. And that's why I sometimes... react bad to things. Sex isn't just about making more humans. It's also something that can be used to warp break or heal."
Dean pulled back off again and coughed a bit.
"And it was
Cas learned forward slowly.
"Anything."
him for it, and how I would
Dean put his hands on Jimmy's shoulders. "Cas. I don't know how to help you understand that every single thing on that list is true for you just the same as it’s true for me. Should have just called Sam to debate philosophy with you first thing, but I thought I could handle it. I screwed up, okay? We’ll make this work as long as we talk about stuff. Right, sweetheart?"
Jimmy but...  um, yeah." Dean hoped Cas understood. "I just need to know you’re not - I don't know - bleeding out or something? I don't know how this angel stuff works."
Sam unfolded himself up out of the couch, and stood. He easily had about five or six inches on Jimmy.
That made Jimmy smile.
"Yeah?" Jimmy sounded hopeful.
Sam paused. Jimmy had turned to face him, even though Dean still held him in his arms. “What you’ve got to understand - is Dean spent longer in Hell than he did here. He’s got habits, and ways of thinking about things, and things that remind him of Hell and those things
"He thinks you're punishing him." Jimmy was
Because this was a dream, and it was similar to one he’d had before Hell, Dean didn’t have any trouble breathing. If he’d tried this while awake, it would have caused a panic attack instantly, but this was different. This was familiar, and the insistent pressure of the hand cradling his head felt grounding instead of controlling. In that moment, all he had to do was exist. There was an almost meditative quality to it. Dean moaned around Cas’ cock as he felt the past grow more and more distant. There was no room for anything besides remembering to breathe through his nose and stay focused on keeping the muscles of his throat relaxed. He tried to maintain eye contact but ended up giving in to the desire to close his eyes and enjoy the feeling of the steady hand guiding his head and the cock down his throat.
Right down to the eye contact.
we do this, both of you need to know that if you want to stop, we stop. Don't need to give a reason. We uh... don't have any lube, so that means no butt stuff. Not right now at least. And um - this mattress is amazing even if the rest of the house sucks ass. But I'm not sleeping in the wet spot so try not to jizz on the sheets. We’ve got a perfectly good shower and I’ve got a perfectly good mouth. In me or on me is fine. Just not in my eye or something. Also maybe not the hair? I’m assuming you’re clean? Doesn’t matter, Cas would have fixed it if you weren’t. And before you go away and I can't talk to you, I want to know if there's anything you’d be really into. Because I'd be happy to
He felt Ketch steal a kiss against the back of a shoulder-blade. Then curled closer against his spine, and Cas let him. Dean was pressed between them, and they both had an arm around his waist.
Cas moved, and put his hand on Dean’s upper back. Then dipped, got the other arm under his knees. And lifted. Dean let out a squawk of surprise and held on. Cas pivoted and stepped onto the floor, holding Dean like an awkwardly shaped bag of laundry.
"Sure seems like it. Don't know what that says about your taste in men, but I'm not complaining."
Cas' hands were on his hair, and the back of his neck. No pressure
Dean felt that voice through his entire body, and it felt
"Don’t know if you want that to sound dirty or not, but I'm into it. But first we need a shower. Trust me, they're a lot better now than whatever you had in 1901."
Cas smiled, and leaned in to kiss Dean properly. Dean returned the kiss, stomach and thighs tensing as the bulge at the base of Cas' cock pressed against great places inside him. Cas pushed Dean's hair out of his face, and there was just so much unmissable, undisguised devotion in those eyes.
"This ugly-ass house?”
Dean was being transferred to another set of arms, the first arms in a while that actually staggered under his weight.
Cas was starting to swell slightly on his tongue. That was kind of fun too.
“Please. Love your fingers." He hoped they wouldn’t think he was whining. But Jimmy had stopped and Dean still needed
Cas stood, in the corner of the room. He was wearing a pair of sweatpants cuffed over about four times.
"Okay," Dean said a bit too quickly. "Okay just..."
Dean's touch was feather-light, barely there and teasing. Never more than a fingertip or two made contact at a time, and he didn't linger too long in one place. Jimmy squirmed.
"One fake passport. As many fake driver’s licenses as you want.”
people and been trained to like it. He couldn’t let Jimmy and Cas see that. "I need to turn my brain off and get fucked. I'm worried I screwed this up and I’m no good for you. I still want to call you Daddy and I want Cas to tell me what a good boy I am and I'm scared you're going to call me a worthless whore even though I probably am one."
Waking up trapped, alone. Again.
He slipped out from between Cas and the car, ducked in the driver’s side before anyone could ask him anything else.
Jimmy folded himself across Dean's torso. Fingers touched his chest, and the sides of his ribcage. He kissed one of Dean’s nipples, played his tongue around it for a second. Dean moaned, arched his back. His movements were slow. His thoughts were slow. Everything felt good.
and pulsed like an electrical explosion. A few seconds later Jimmy pulled his hands away, still touching Dean's face, feeling for responses.
"I do not speak ill of your brother, but if Ruby is any indication... you are avoiding the question."
Dean was quiet for a minute. "I think Bobby’s going to like being sort of a grandparent. Dad would have."
“It’ll be like
"So... I don't really know what your true form looks like or how it works or anything, but is there a part of you...." Dean searched for the right way to describe things, "somewhere more vulnerable? Jimmy kinda made it sound like you two were having brain sex or something, and I don't know how that works, but I figure there's parts of you that you share with him that you wouldn't want to share with someone else?"
Please, Dean. I beg you-"
Dean didn't know whether to laugh or cry. "Thank
"Admit it. With all the freaky shit you and Cas get up to, that was at least as much you talking as him."
, I can't. Something's always not working right. If it's not my dick, it's my brain. I feel so damn old." Dean was angry, but the person he was angry at was dead. Sam had killed him.
There was something about hearing Cas use language like that, in that matter-of-fact way, that was way sexier than it had any right to be.
“You sound terrible.”
Dean stopped moving, but left his hand where it was for a second. He waited for Jimmy to catch his breath and stop shaking. It gave him time to do the same.
“I’m sure it was really scary and all, but thinking about Castiel knocking in windows...”
Jimmy slumped against him. And breathed like someone who had been holding his breath for a long time.
. Not about BDSM, or PTSD, I only learned what all the letters in LGBT stood for like a month ago... "
Dean was not ready for how good that felt. It felt good when he did it, but it felt
Cas turned to look over his shoulder. Dean suspected there was some silent vessel/angel communication going on, because Jimmy swung himself up behind Dean to also straddle Cas. He pressed up against Dean's back, reaching forward to drag down the zipper on his jeans. Dean twisted around to kiss Jimmy, and rolled his hips.
"Okay. Just one then."
"Ours will be. It will be exactly like this, only better."
"Oh." Jimmy said.
"Jimmy, shut up. Sam, answer the question!" Dean was scared, no hiding it anymore.
“So your kink is just.... love or something? I... guess that could work?” Dean wasn't sure he was comfortable with that. But it was also as far from anything he’d called Alastair as you could get.
Dean felt like he was watching everything from slightly further back than he should be. His stomach felt weightless.
"Can I hold onto your hair? I promise not to be rude about it or anything? You'd still be in control."
Jimmy moved into Dean's space. Managed to tangle himself even more around him, until they were a bundle of legs and arms. And he searched blindly up, nuzzling, for Dean's face. There was a nose, then a mouth on his, but it wasn't a kiss. Jimmy was just sort of pressing there. Asking permission. Dean shook his head. He couldn't.
"My vessel thinks this version of me sounds much cooler.”
"I love you." He held on tight to Jimmy, covering his face in kisses. "I love you so damn much. Thank you. Oh, God. Thank you so... much... I can't... I didn't..."
“Unarmed and defenseless, huh?” Jimmy looked like a kid just dying to tell a secret. He must never be allowed to play poker. The look on his face said
"He wouldn't have cozied up to a literal demon."
Dean just licked his lips and nodded.
"My last vessel said she had terrible taste in men."
time, but... you know what I mean."
Cas tilted his head to one side, trying to understand. "A corrupted connection is better than no connection at all," he said slowly. "And if that is your only connection for long enough, another connection - will make you think of it. Make you feel it again. Sex is that for you. Not only you. Humanity."
“I got good at kissing and giving her massages and things. But I never - and it’s not the same thing. I think I was sort of relieved, when I finally figured out about her and Roger, what's that all about? I didn’t think she’d leave because of Claire, and at least she was getting good sex somewhere.”
"Cas. I really think I can do this."
Cas did stop.
Jimmy snuggled Dean deeper. "Castiel can bug Sam for details."
that sent an… an
"What am I supposed to do with you?” Jimmy ducked his head so all Dean could see was wild hair. “Other than just keep you in bed forever, I guess. But, ah. Not to be that guy. But the barbecue ribs downstairs smell
"You didn't have to do that,” he said.
"Feels so good. I forgot." Dean was shaking, "I forgot it could feel like this." He couldn't hold them back anymore. "I'm sorry, Jimmy." He wiped his eyes on his arm, "I know it’s not sexy.”
things he wanted to say, but if he tried to say
“I don't want to find out where I go when I die. I don't want to go back there."
"What if I never..." He couldn't give voice to that particular fear. Not in the middle of an empty parking lot, not for all the world to hear. "I don't know. You and Jimmy help. We'll figure something out."
do the circle thing. Slow. Just sort of press against the edges. I really like to sort of...do this thing where I crook my finger and press along the side as I pull out?"
"You." Dean turned towards the kiss. He suddenly needed the blindfold off. It was too much. With shaking hands, he slipped it away and saw that the room around them had vanished, replaced with an approximation of the patterns Cas had shown him earlier. A pale imitation of Castiel's true form. The best Dean could do.
"Shall I carry you out? Or is there more I can do here?"
"You would ask to simply receive care and love. But you would feel wrong and selfish to lie back and let me love you as you loved my vessel, without giving me something in return. But this kind of surrender is neither incomprehensible nor unforgivable to me. I would give you this. And I hope you would not think badly of me, if I asked for permission to continue even after you began to cry, or struggle, or did anything other than ask me to stop. I will always stop. I will not always be entirely gentle. But I do not think that is always what you want." He turned to stare right at Dean.
"Hey, uh. I don’t know if now is a good time to tell you or not, but you should probably know." Dean had to clear his throat. "It's not official or anything, and no one's planning to do anything about it, but I'm pretty sure I've got a kid. He's about ten?" He did some mental math. "Yeah. Ten. I don't really know him all that well."
Cas scooped Dean up in his arms, and the bathroom door just popped open.
"We should pick up some kid sized safety glasses."
"Right here."
"Kinky."
"Glad you think so." Jimmy lay back on the mattress. "God your hands are gentle."
Jimmy laughed, and snuggled to Dean's chest. "Cas certainly seems to think so."
Dean tried to tell himself that Cas hadn't abandoned him.
"Shut up. You're gonna make me cry.” But Jimmy was starting to smile again, and there was no venom in his words.
"Yeah. We don't keep track of that kind of thing, not with family."
"I will be mindful. I will not hurt my vessel." Raising himself up, Cas held the tip of Dean's cock, steadying. “I could heal him,” he said as he lined himself up. “But that… is not… the point…”
"You good, babe? Or just ticklish?"
Cas' face was still weirdly serene and hard to read. "If I thought myself capable of leaving a wounded beloved, I would walk into holy fire right now.”
"Dean, I ..." Jimmy shook his head. "Come here." He pulled Dean up and into his lap. Cas was still lying against the mound of pillows, lazy, with a glint in his eye as he watched their every move.
Cas to avoid security cameras.
Jimmy kissed Castiel’s hand and then knelt at his side, very still, tucking his head into the curve of his angel’s neck. Cas brought up a hand to touch his hair. Dean wrapped an arm around Jimmy too. Calmer now.
Jimmy tipped himself against Dean, forehead to collarbone, and breathed like he’d been running. He said something, could have been “thank you” or “love you” or “trust you.” Dean didn't feel worthy of any of that, but for a second he let himself pretend to be the kind of person who could deserve someone like Jimmy.
Dean was starting to really like this crappy little house.
There was the sound of wind, or wings. And then they were outside, in an empty parking lot on the edge of Kansas City in the blue early evening. And there was his Baby, parked just where he left her.
Dean pulled him into a kiss, and Jimmy fell into his arms. And once the relieved, grateful, exhale of a kiss was over - “Cas likes this idea."
Sam unconsciously mirrored his pose, leaning against the door. "You were bad at relationships before Hell too. You don't get to just opt out altogether."
There was something unbelievably sexy about that. Dean still didn't understand how it worked exactly, but he imagined his lovers' souls brushing against each other as Jimmy moved out of the way to make room for Cas. He made a mental note to incorporate that into the bedroom at some point. "Jimmy says you had fun last night,” he said. “But I'd kinda like to hear it from you."
"Chuck!" Dean said it like a swear word, and was out of the shower without an explanation. He dialed his phone, got an answering machine. Left a message –
"Worse than... nightmares?"
A short pause on Sam’s end. "So I guess that means I'm showing up in... where's he from? Illinois? Showing up in Illinois wearing the Fed suit and serving divorce papers?"
"His eyes are closed," Cas observed. "And a blindfold appeared in the coat pocket."
"Pretty sure he's dead.” Dean snaked an arm around Jimmy. “I was unconscious when it happened."
"I want this. I
Dean started to let his hands explore the body in front of him, but didn't stray below the belt just yet. Jimmy closed his eyes and leaned into the touch. "Love that you've got calluses."
"Amazing. Yes. Can I wear heels?" Dean hadn't meant to say that either, but no taking it back now. "The really tall kind? And stockings?"
, because we will never let you go back there."
"Sammy?" Dean hoped he didn’t sound as scared as he felt. "You went to school in California, right?"
Jimmy's eyes closed, and he sounded dreamy. "If
"So good, my Dean. So good."
And he was so focused on Jimmy in fact, that he didn’t notice what he was wearing.
"Thank you," said Jimmy, wide eyes just meaning... everything. But he couldn't resist any longer, and turned to the food, and Dean. "Why do I feel like I ought to be asking someone's
he said, smug.
"You help him to feel safe. He chose you. As long as that remains true, I will not allow you to hurt yourself."
Sam snorted. "I don't know who's the cuter couple, you and Cas or you and Jimmy."
A little kiss on just the corner of his mouth, not enough, teasing.
Dean took a moment to process that. Then decided he'd be better off keeping his mouth shut. He ran his hand along the entirely too tense looking muscles of Castiel's back.
Cas' eyes were glowing. His silver-blue angelic aura reflected off the bathroom's white tiles. He laid a hand over Dean’s forehead.
"Stay safe. Don't do anything stupid. Be patient?"
"I wish I could've given you an orgasm. That's not a big thing. That doesn't seem like a crazy goal."
"We are not starting that who-saved-who's-life thing up again. You admitted you don't understand formal causality."
Dean gave up trying to do anything other than hold on.
"I'm going to ask Cas to bring you here, to where I am. You were right the first time. I should have come to you."
"I have to stay. You're going to marry me. I have a kid now. Somebody has to keep her safe."
Jimmy grabbed the back of Dean's head and kissed him. Dean was glad his own weird upbringing and Sam's anger issues were useful for something.
"You've learned to trust each other. It's nice."
The coat slid off the bed as Cas lowered himself down over Dean's body. His lips hovered, almost touching but not, as his heel of his hand came to Dean's temple. That one hand kept him lying prone on the mattress.
Dean took that as permission to finish off the rest of Jimmy's plate. "You should try food sometime. You liked other stuff you've tried so far. Food’s at least as good as a hot shower, and that was totally worth getting out of bed for."
Cas. And if my Baby gets hurt because you distract me, I'm never forgiving either of us." Dean took his hand off Cas so he could lovingly run it over the dash. "You take good care of me. Isn't that right, Baby?"
There was a beat, before Cas made one of his pleased sounds low in his throat. "You are
"Breathe, try to relax for me." Dean was smearing additional lube onto his fingers. "Okay. I'm going to take this finger out but I want you to stay relaxed. You're doing a great job. Keep remembering to breathe, and tell me to stop and I'll stay exactly where I am." Careful of the possibility that Jimmy might tense up, Dean slid his finger out, before sliding it back in alongside a second. He went just as slowly as he had the first time around, and didn't just slide straight in. Instead, he rocked his fingers back and forth as he went, pressing against the rim of Jimmy's hole and silently cursing whoever invented flavored lube.
“Dammit, I love you. I love that you're doing this for me. I love that I get to do this for you. I love that you got yourself here. You've done good."
"That’s what anyone walking by is going to think. What is going on with those street-facing windows?"
Cas was getting flustered. His eyes fluttered, then flicked to Dean's lips, the rest of him almost vibrating. He pressed forward, searching for a kiss-
Dean just sat, trying to pull himself together enough to be able to talk. He didn't really have anything to say, but that wasn't the point.
Jimmy was lying beneath him, breathing hard. Every mark that Dean had given him stood out against his soft unblemished skin, and his hair was wild. One hand was behind his head, grabbing onto pillows or headboard or something. The other was in a fist, holding the sheets. His cock was completely hard now, and starting to leak at the tip, as flushed and red as Jimmy's blushes. It was so close to Dean's face, and so were the thighs spread wide enough to lie between. One of Dean's hands was splayed across his abdomen, and he looked sexier than any one person had a right to. Which made sense, considering Cas and Jimmy were two people. Or maybe Dean just wasn't doing most of his thinking with his brain anymore.
Dean hadn’t quite noticed that Jimmy had gone rigid and fuzzy until he heard a much deeper voice say, “We are all lucky to have him.”
Cas dipped his head into the curve of Dean's neck. "You understand."
Dean wanted to argue that, and was about to. But Sam had a point. Dean hated it but that didn't make anything he said less true. "You're gonna make me say it?" he said, somewhere between hurt and downright snippy. "It’s me. Being bad at relationships. Hell screwed me up, okay? I'm trying, but maybe that was a dumb idea." He crossed his arms protectively over his chest, and leaned against the edge of the desk.
want, I think it’s your turn. And if I don't want the same things as you that's okay. There's enough we both want that it won't even matter. I'm asking you
Everything was suddenly very quiet. Even the sounds of the occasional car passing by the motel and the night-time world outside seemed to grow quiet. The sheets were softer than he was used to on the road, and the man above him had agreed to marry him, and there was a literal angel who thought Dean worth saving. He was still wearing the stockings they got for him.
The phone sitting on the pillow crackled to life. “Right.” Sam sounded bossy. "Breathe in four counts, hold four counts, exhale for four counts, hold."
Sam shook his head. "How'd you
"Good. That’s good. You belong here. Hey – what's Jimmy up to?" Dean wouldn't have admitted it, but he'd almost forgotten Jimmy was there. Cas was just that good.
"Okay, first? You might not stay hard while I fuck you. Some guys don't. And yeah, they feel different. I mostly meant that this might be over before that. It's okay if it is. Like I said. We have plenty of time. I'm not going to rush this."
"What if I cooked? I don't do it too much, but I can,” Dean said.
Golden patterns started to fold in tighter, and Dean realized - they weren't lightning bugs anymore. He wasn't sure what they were, but also knew that was not a safe question to ask. They
"Hey now. Don't rush me. I know what I'm doing here." Dean was in his element now. Sex God Dean Winchester was back in business.
Cas rocked him against his cock. Just a little. He was
Castiel moved his hips against Dean, pulling back, and then pressing forward again.
that he thinks I'm a sexy burning Ferris wheel." He landed a kiss before Jimmy got a chance to correct him."It's sexy the way he says that stuff. With you, it's just cute."
but I'm the one who gets to hold him like this.” Dean demonstrated. “It's just different."
"Oh dear
"One of the teeny tiny short robes that hit at mid-thigh? I can wear a bow tie. Only a bow tie."
"Burns? If it happened in the first month or so of me being a vessel... I didn’t know which way was up or down." Jimmy shifted, uncomfortable. "Gimme a second. I'll get Castiel."
"You are being good as we speak, by letting my vessel fuck you through your fear.”
And then abruptly, almost mechanically Dean said - "I can't do this."
Dean sat back. "Everything okay?" New things could be weird.
He wanted to hold Jimmy, provide some physical comfort, but at least Cas was still able to do that. The angel was rolling over his vessel like a wave, pinning him down, giving him all the skin contact possible. Staring into his eyes.
It took a little while, but the laughter and tears eventually calmed him down. Jimmy hadn’t stopped running hands up and down his back, and kissing any skin he could reach.“Thank you," he said, finally.
Cas steadied Dean with just one hand, then dropped to a knee in front of him. Kept drying, over Dean's ass and legs, in big slow circles. Then he stood.
"His daughter?"
." Dean looked up into the dark, quiet night as the reality of it all sank in. "I don't know how Dad ever let us out of his sight."
There was another long pause before he started, with no real lead-in.
there is some serious potential."
cold. But the belt was coming off. And so was the concealed carry holster. Dean wasn't trying to be sexy anymore, as Jimmy crawled forward.
Cas nodded. And then Dean had Jimmy across his chest.
Cas made a noise that could have been a scoff, or a laugh."If you must do something for my former superior, please include all the
"Can't." The shaking was back. "Can't fix this. Not that simple." He was okay. This could be okay. He could be okay.
"I don't sleep much anymore." Dean chose his words carefully. "Four hours every couple of days. Maybe."
"Well he’s too good for you. So you should definitely put a ring on it."
"Cas. You okay?"
was he supposed to explain that he wasn't afraid of Cas, when he also wasn't
doing it. Dean's thoughts were muffled. It took work to make them form words. It probably wasn't worth the trouble. He'd rather just float here.
"I thought about it. I didn't. But I thought about it. Wouldn't be the first time I sold my soul."
"Did you touch yourself?" Dean slid to his knees. Careful not to lose balance.
"I should have asked before playing a game like that. Rules were needed. And the ability to stop playing. You have been trying to tell me this."
He didn’t want a safeword. He didn't want to have to admit he'd need one.
Cas' eyes went unfocused and fuzzy for a moment, and then Jimmy was there, laughing.
"I want to do right by him." Dean paused. "But there's a problem. He says it feels weird to be fake-married while he's still real-married. And I won't let him fake his death. I'm not doing that to the kid.”
Cas put a hand under Dean's neck and arranged him, so his face rested in his body and Cas didn’t have to look at him.
He laid a few kisses along the small of Dean's back. "You're doing great so far. Anything I've explained bad?"
"This is me. Talking. Words. Words.
"No, it's. Walk me through it? Don't even know enough about this stuff to say, ‘this that and the other thing, not my thing.’"
"Oh no you don't," said Jimmy, and he thrust into Dean, hard. "You've been nothing but my sweet beautiful kitten, getting dressed up in a beautiful corset to please me, and I haven't been treating you right." He picked up the pace. "You need to know you're mine, and only mine. Feel how hard I am kitten? You did such a good job pleasing me."
Jimmy fell back down into the mattress. "Oh. You're warm."
Dean moved so that he was supporting most of his weight on one elbow. "Like that, huh?” Dean's lips sought out the pulse point on Castiel's neck, while his hips sought out more of that glorious friction. There was something incredibly sexy about knowing that the only reason Castiel was pinned like this was because he was
Dean wanted to keep watching, but felt a strange buzzing sound behind his eyes. He tried closing them. It helped, but not completely.
"Why did you stop my vessel? Why did you not want him to see this? Why do you think there is any part of you he would not find beautiful?"
"I would have my vessel kneeling before you while I held you in my lap. You would lean forward and take him into your mouth, giving him the pleasure you deliver so well, while I hold your cock in my hands. Perhaps I would be inside you, as I did this."
Dean considered it, but shook his head. "That's not safe. You could sort of wrap it around your hands and hold onto it, but we'd need a way for you to get out of it quick. If you want, I'll swing by a hardware store and we can pick out some nylon rope in a color you like."
“Yes...” said Cas. He was having a little trouble talking. “Nothing will change.”
Cas sighed, but kissed him back.
"You know enough to tell me if you're safe right now?"
Dean reached up to take Jimmy's hand from where it rested, and bring it to his lips, holding him close. He wasn't crying. But his breath still had that shudder.
"I was in a hotel the second time! With a mirrored ceiling!"
"Cas. I can't.... too much." He had to fight every last instinct he had, to push Cas away.
"This is as neutral an observation as I am able to make,” said Cas. “The shower, and the way you made sure I understood there would be no conditions to staying with you and Sam, this helped make sense of some of the things you have done. You desire this release, you desire to receive, you desire to be fucked. You see this as something closed off to you, and it pains you."
"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure you don't want me reciting the Gettysburg Address."
He didn't have to worry that Cas felt left out, or less than. "Do you know what this
"So. What's the plan? I had an idea, but I don't want to throw too much at Jimmy too fast. It's just - you kinda forgot he needed food and I'm pretty sure one of the few things the kitchen
"I built this body. I also do not have a gag reflex unless I want one."
He raised an arm that felt like it weighed twice as much as normal and managed to pull Cas closer. "Should be scared of this. I'm not." His speech was less slurred, he wasn't as dizzy, but he still felt warmth pooling in his arms and legs. The muscles of his thighs felt like they had been soaking in a hot tub for hours. Completely relaxed in a way he didn't think - he had ever been before.
"It'd be nice to find out my capabilities before I have you completely surrounded," Dean whispered.
There. Oh fuck. We're actually doing this."
"Please?" Dean surprised himself by wishing they had a blindfold. But that could wait. He did want to see Castiel's face after all.
Dean couldn’t help it. He squeezed Cas into a hug. Probably too tight, but he didn’t have to worry about squishing a literally indestructible being. Castiel stayed still.
"If he can do it fast, and not get caught on any security cameras? You're the only one of us who doesn't have their face on a Most Wanted list somewhere." Dean brought his hand up to cradle that face. Maybe he was talking about wanted lists, but his tone was more like a man saying ‘I love you.’
"Cas and Jimmy are pretty cute too."
. I've never," He wasn't sure quite how to explain it. "Sex has never felt like this for me. Remember what I said about it being a connection? I've had plenty of sex before, and yeah, some of it was better physically. Especially at the end there." Dean tried to make a joke out of it, it didn't really work. "But I've never felt a connection like this. I had a good time, but this was more... I don't know,
"I will curl tighter into you. But I… am almost always closer to you than is... polite."
Cas walked quietly over to the bed, and knelt beside Dean.
Jimmy did a funny move, like a whole body shiver. "Yes.
Dean had probably been this hard before. The first time he had sex, maybe. But he wouldn't swear to it.
Cas traveled kisses along Dean's eyebrow. "You would like to reward us?" His lips took Dean's, long and deep, before letting him have enough breath to form an answer.
Dean felt Cas nod against him. So he got a quick peck on the cheek and a slap on the ass before Dean went to stow the silver knife. "Get that beautiful ass back in bed and we can try this again, starting from right before I freaked out on you.”
Cas rose up on his elbows to join them. "No. This is joyful." Dean pulled their angel into the embrace too. Very squished, and he didn’t care.
"That works."
"I didn't know that." Dean chose his words carefully. "It’s good I help him feel more... the way he wants to be." He turned on the mattress so he and Jimmy faced each other. Dean brushed the hair out of the way to kiss his forehead. "He does the same for me." Cas was in there, somewhere.
With Cas as his anchor to the present, Dean parted his thighs as an invitation to continue, and now there were hands petting against the soft and vulnerable skin there. The touch was so light, as Cas rubbed circles and patterns up and down, occasionally taking one hand away to carefully cradle Dean balls, working them between his fingers before letting go. His hands began to stray, fingers trailed to Dean’s hip bone, then dug in and massaged the tight muscle of his upper thigh. The entire time Cas was looking down, every piece of attention on the way his hands moved on Dean's body.
I wanted to do this. I wanted to make love to
Because whatever this thing is, it's pretending to be your kid but it's
I wish we had some lube right now but human bodies don't work like that. Sorry. Some other time though?
Knuckles of Cas' hands raked up Dean's spine.
He was still cautious. Cas had put some serious words in there. Words like 'struggle.’ There were some types of restraints he
Dean kissed his hair, as Cas started to kiss his way across his skin.
"Not going to lie,” he said, when he broke away. “That was... really hot."
"No," Cas agreed. "I do not act under orders."
"Let me wash your hair? Also, I have found this loofah."
Cas brought a hand up to Dean's cheek.
"Whatever's in the duffle," said Sam, getting up. He cracked open the motel room door to snag the rubber doormat from outside, and used it to kick out the rest of the holy fire.
"Actually, I think being a single-income household gives Amelia some more breaks. And I –  I mean it would just be stupid to go anywhere near Claire now, too many people on the lookout to kill Cas. But you know. Things could change.”
"I can’t decide if I want you to come in my mouth, so you can taste yourself on my lips when I kiss you or if I want you to pull out and come across my chest, and maybe even my face. I've gotten off to that fantasy a few times, actually."
Jimmy nodded, swallowed.
“Of course you can have a kiss, kitten. Stay right there, I’m coming around to you. Keep on sucking Cas’ cock.”
And Dean was babbling.
A moment later, Cas' touch got lighter, more irregular, wider circles, sneaking down to touch Dean's
"Two is good for now. Remember that spot I found earlier?" Dean crooked his fingers. "I'm going to try and find that again."
"I do not think so, Dean. I may be able to get closer. Approximate a version of myself that will not blind you." Cas' words sounded small and difficult.
"Shhhhh," said Jimmy. "What do you need? You're getting good at saying what you need."
"Can I touch you?"
Dean sat up and shed the trench coat before giving a salute and a wink."Yes sir." He was in the middle of crawling over to Cas before he realized what he'd said. And his reaction was instantaneous.
Jimmy lightly punched his arm. “Since my partners are both so very direct – I mean the saying things out loud so you can look at them. And also the sex. I mean, sue me. People sex is good, and I wasn't having any with Castiel, and now I am. So that's good."
"It's not fair. One second I'm thinking about how good this is going to feel and the next -" Dean covered his face with his arm rather than look at Jimmy. "How long have I got to deal with this?"
"We're celebrating. In the kitchen, that has one strange tiny window six feet off the ground."
“Probably taking notes for later. But I wouldn’t blame him if watching kinda did it for him. If I could watch you and him together, I know where I would have been ten minutes ago. “
Dean pulled the coat up so that it covered his head. It was childish. He did it anyway.
Dean stopped and slowly withdrew his fingers. He wiped his hand on the sheets before rising from his place on the floor on unsteady legs, crawling into bed. He grabbed onto Jimmy.
"That's what I want. We'll get there. We'll get there." Because they
He looked up at Jimmy through his lashes, not even trying to be sexy. Just where he was when he thought to ask.
"Cas, what is this?"
"Dude, don't take this the wrong way but can you not? My little brother is
Jimmy paused, clearly processing on a lag. He pushed himself out of bed, leaned his forehead against the glass of the tiny ugly window. Blue moonlight from outside cut around his profile.
biting. Dean shuddered slightly and let go, replacing teeth with tongue and trying not to think too much about how much he was
The room became even sharper. Another figure. This one was indistinct, but recognizable.
Dean moved the arm blocking his vision. Propped himself up on one elbow to get a better view. "Seriously. I'm not complaining, but you have the whole headboard. Can I have one of the pillows? I was kinda hoping to be able to sit back and enjoy the show."
Dean reached back and squeezed Ketch's thigh. In response, Ketch hooked his leg around Dean's.
"I tell you
Dean kissed his hand and nodded.
Dean rolled his eyes, but went to get it. Arranged it on the nightstand in easy reach, then turned back to Jimmy. Who was just kind of looking at him. Figuring him out. “How are you doing?" Jimmy asked.
