But Dean had said he was thinking about it. Cas was trying not to linger on it. It seemed unlikely that Dean would want to do this, and Cas suspected if he were to say yes it would come, yet again, from a place of wanting to fulfil Cas’s needs, rather than heeding his own. Cas couldn’t let himself consider that Dean might actually want this too, not after last time. But Dean said he was thinking about it. Thinking about them. There it was again… the hope that was too much to hope for.
He groaned, scrubbing harder, rubbing it across his lips and finding them dry and chapped. He checked the mirror again, getting better. He got more soap.
"Oh, what?" He shot back.
"You missed the establishment." Cas pointed out, and Dean turned briefly, shooting Cas a smile.
"Oh, bully for you, Castiel is back." The girl sarcastically proclaimed. "Hugs all round?" She raised her arms furiously. Dean noticed with a wry smile that she had an English accent, something that hadn't been noticeable whilst Castiel had been inside her.
Dean turned for a few seconds to look across the room, and Dean followed his lead, looking towards the piano, listening to the tune. Cas couldn’t place it, but it felt familiar.
"Think spring's coming." He told the man, peering out. He looked back at Cas, his listless face, and noticed with a small smile that the sunlight from the window was just shy of reaching his face, but would, in time.
"No, what is it?" She asked again, noticing an unconscious flinch. And then she recognised it. It was a look she had seen before, a look she had seen in her Father's face before. And now that she had noticed it, she could feel it too, a twinge in her grace.
“They’re selling stuff they grow, or animals.” Sam answered, taking a sip of coffee.
"So he'll wake up?" Dean asked anxiously. "Is that what you're saying?"
“Such as being beholden with sexual opportunities.”
Dean eyes moved a lot during the meal. He looked at his food, at his plate, out the window, at a menu. Not once did he look at the faces of his company. He knew what he would find there; Sam, eyes pleading with Dean to make some sort of move, something forgiving, something to show Cas he still cared, and in Cas's eyes he would see, beneath the heavy layers of cold, angelic indifference, reproach and sorrow. He didn't want to see either of them.
"She's human by a technicality. And we tend to forget that little rule when they're particularly annoying."
"Over there." Cas instructed, holding up his blade and indicating to the far side of the room.
Dean felt it too. He recognised the tightening in his chest, in his pants. Dean wanted this too, in this moment desperately wanted Cas as much as Cas wanted him. That look was intoxicating, and the feeling of being powerless underneath it was devastating.
"It would not be wise." Cas concluded. "I doubt I would be welcomed with anything other than violence."
Dean shook his head. "Just... Never mind."
"It's a coveted position, Dean." Cas told him. "We were told to love humans above God. Many angels would see this as a reward."
There was no need for him to go inside, other than his own childish desire to be near the hunter. That being said, he also feared being around him; he feared the sullen silences, the pointed ignorance, the sharp words. But more than that, he feared the emotion that was emanating from Dean in waves – the emotion that the hunter could not recognise, but that Cas had seen last night when he had been yelled at, all the sadness that radiated off of Dean whilst he slept.
Dean blinked, unfazed. "Must've been some other guy. After I left."
Cas watched him warily, clearly anticipating some sort of response. He looked defensive, and Dean didn’t blame him, not after what he’d had to do. What he had
"Just for a minute or two," He sighed. Sam didn't say anything, prompting Dean with his silence. "He stopped breathing, then his heart too. I tried CPR, but it didn't work."
“Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes people just don’t wanna be helpful, but you can always slip ‘em some cash, especially civilians.” He heard Dean sigh, a rush of static over the phone, and he had a vision of Dean pinching the bridge of his nose, holding the phone close to his ear as he found his words. “I’m sorry for not trusting you earlier.”
"Yeah, I think so." Sam frowned. "Cas should be safe here, though. Rufus really proofed the place, and Bobby."
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows, in what was recognised as a confused, but curious, expression. "You find writing this down helps?"
“Definitely not his Mother.” Dean grumbled, thinking back to the night outside the club and wincing, the sinking feeling in his chest growing heavy every time he thought about it, about his words afterwards. “God, I’m a dick.” He sighed.
Cas breathed in deep to the stretch, letting the words rattle around his chest. Sam believed in him, he believed he could do this. It will just take time. He exhaled, and felt some of what he believed he might recognise as anxiety lift off him, and let his hands drop to his sides. “Thank you, Sam.”
“I mean it. We’ve got work to do, sure, but you’re picking it up. And you’re good with weapons. You were right before, you wouldn’t be useless in a fight.”
“Yeah, probably.” He looked over to Sam and Cas, his posture straightening up as the tension of the next task settled in. “Right. We ready for this?”
"Mandy." She interrupted.
Cas blinked, digesting the information, frowning as he felt a glimpse of something , a haze of what he saw whilst he hadn't been there. He looked at his hand, dimly remembering the ghost of Dean's words. Begging, pleading. Begging for Cas. He flexed his fingers subconsciously, trying to chase the memory.
“Cloakroom.” Dean gestured to another queue, pulling more cash out. Dean knew his way around this place with such familiarity, knew the rules, the language and which queues to join.
It was good to flex those fighting muscles again is all. Spending time with his best friend and his brother, working their skills, joking around and testing each other - it was a good day.
"Whatever." Dean huffed, sitting back down. "Don't you wanna hear what happened when you were out?"
"Why'd he want to see me?" Dean frowned.
"When did you see her?"
Cas lifted his head but didn’t turn to look at at him again, staring into the space in front of him.
Dean waited impatiently, eyes darting, used to Cas's habit of appearing just behind him, just out of sight. Between him and Sam, they had pretty much the entire room in sight-line, but no angel appeared.
, and Dean could feel his knees buckling underneath him. “Bedroom, bedroom!” He repeated, hands shoving Cas back but clutching onto the cotton shirt, not letting him get too far. “If you keep doing that this is gonna be over real quick.”
"Right." Dean called to the angel behind him. "Look for the lock of hair. It'll probably be in something, a photo frame, a locket..."
he’d come out as, but he had. And Sam was cool with it. Barely batted an eyelid, seemed to actually be rooting for it, rooting for them.
It had been a few minutes since she had started, and Cas was already sweating, teeth gritted against the pain. He hadn't said anything, ignoring Kirsty as she made small talk with Dean, failing to do so with Cas himself. He found himself staring hard at the yin-yang symbol on the wall, gripping tightly onto the armrests of the seat.
"What new one?" Sam sighed.
It was the last thing he’d expected out of Cas’s mouth and it had taken Dean a second to catch up, to figure out what Crowley was so excited about. Sam had shot him a look, surprised but impressed. Dean felt anger surge in him, he couldn’t understand how Sam was on board with this, would okay him to use his body as a transaction for safety, to
His eyes narrowed as the credits rolled, and his mouth dropped open a little, clearly trying to process the proceedings.
Dean’s eyes on him. He’d made an impression, at least.
“I’m going.” Cas announced as he walked into the garage, his own duffel slung over his shoulder.
"It's not safe for him out there." Sam said.
She broke into number twelve, a house that was practically a mansion after the motels. Parking the car around the back so as not to arouse suspicion from any nosy neighbours, she let herself in quietly, using the same technique as she did to get into the car. Shutting off the alarm quickly, she headed straight for the fridge, plucking a beer and a chocolate bar out and slumping down into a sofa. It was plush and soft, and she almost felt like going to sleep right then and there - it was far comfier than what she had been sleeping on for months.
So now they had to find the item anchoring grandma to this realm. Based on a conversation with Becky’s Mom, they figured they were looking for an old diary in storage, one that she’d poured her “heart and soul” into, and had left a lock of her own hair in. Sounded reasonable, except it was in the basement in storage, which meant it was going to take a while. Not ideal, when the EMF was sparking and they’d already run into a couple of cold spots.
"Cas..." Dean said, amazed, forgetting himself for a minute, so amazed to see him again.
“I never could have. I didn’t realise how far gone on you I was until long after, long after I rebelled… I…” He shook his head, recalling. A lifetime ago. He was a different man now, in so many ways. “Even at my worst, you were still
urges are overwhelming. I hadn’t realised how distracting they could be, how inopportune it is, or how… how
Not tonight.
“What?” Sam asked.
Dean finally spoke, and it was about the car. But he had a good point. It wasn't where he had left it, in the car park of the reservoir. The lot was empty, of cars and of humans.
"I think he's asleep. She. I dunno."
"Empty?" Sam suggested, and Cas weakly nodded. "Dean, I think it's time to stop for lunch."
His chin drooped, resting on his chest, and his thoughts turned sluggish, and stopped.
Dean looked round. "What, a car drove a little too close?" He asked sarcastically.
"You do not have to do anything."
“No.”
“You doing okay there?” He heard, and he glanced up at the bartender. She was pretty, dark hair twisted up in a knot, a strong jaw, a little bit of makeup. She had dark circles under her eyes, and splash marks across her shirt from the soda spray. She looked tired.
It was going fine, nothing weird. Just a new normal, a new routine. A happy spot in the midst of this train wreck of a year.
Dean tilted his head slightly, considering. “You don’t know? Thought heaven knew everything there was to know about the Winchesters.”
Dean had no idea what propagators were, but Cas seemed pretty into them, talking about the benefits of the format, the humidity and the way it trapped warmth. Dean nodded along, letting Cas talk at him, the words washing over him. The skin of his neck stretched when he turned to look along the table, and Dean let himself look at it, thinking about how it would feel against his lips. He’d already kissed it, he knew, but he hadn’t appreciated it, hadn’t stopped to memorise the feel of it.
Cas had been sitting quietly in the room for a while now. Sam had gone for a shower, leaving the angel to occupy himself.
"Yeah." Dean told him, ignoring his brother's sarcasm. "So I called him."
There wasn't much of an upstairs; a gangway to walk along at the top of the stairs, and what seemed to be a vacated office, the glass punched out. Sam rolled his eyes at his brother before nodding, and made his way to the stairs. This left just Dean and Cas, slowly looking round, each with their weapons raised. They knew better than to be anything less than on guard around the threat of Leviathan's.
"Dean, it hurts!" Cas whined, clearly distressed, unused to this feeling.
Cas stood tall, raising his chin in a display of dominance. "Are you here to kill me, Olivia?"
. Dean heard in his head, his own thoughts chasing themselves in circles.
“I think… your birthright.”
Dean could almost feel it already, and the itch in his limbs to reach forward and take was enormous yet out of reach. If Cas stepped forwards now, if Cas took him
was gonna notice was awkward. Let alone Sam…
Cas turned to look at him, gaze cold and stony, and Dean felt himself shrink into the seat.
“I mean in general. It’s been a couple of weeks since you, you know-”
“Dad didn’t teach us how to deal with emotions, he was so angry all the time. If he wasn’t happy he would drink himself out, or he’d smash stuff. He had all of these ideas about what being a man was, what being a hunter was, what was strong and what was weak.”
Dean frowned slightly. "My mind is completely at ease now, thanks." He sarcastically replied, watching as Sam picked up his bag to go. He took a sip of his beer, looking out the window at the car. It was all packed and ready to go, and Dean felt a pulse start in his temple. He took another sip, gritting his teeth around the taste as he watched, seeing Garth through the glass walking up to the car. In just a few seconds, Sam would be gone in the frankly too small car, and Dean would be left alone in the too quiet hut. No, not really alone.
“I can’t figure this out for you, but I can probably tell you that railing your male friend outside a gay bar isn’t straight?”
, soot and smut deeply ingrained. Dean reached up, using his sleeve to clear off the top layer of dust and cobweb.
don’t do this, this ain’t me.”
"What-" Sam shook his head. "Don't be a child, Dean."
“Castiel, my old friend.” Cas watched as Crowley consciously relaxed his posture, holding his head up high. He was presenting as in charge, confident, but he could see the flicker in his eyes, the twitchiness. “Good to see you up on your feet, I was worried. You’ve even put on some muscle, by the looks of it.”
Dean carried the man, cradling him in his arms, resting his flopping head on his shoulder whilst Sam led the way into the hospital.
Sam scoffed, looking up at Cas, who narrowed his eyes as he looked between the two brothers. "He's right; I am having difficulty following this discussion."
“I’ve not read the later ones, I should find them.” Cas mused, and Dean placed a hand on his shoulder.
"Because I see now that everything I did was wrong." He told her. "And I am sorry that you are paying for my mistake."
“I accept your offer.”
“I was bluffing.”
"Sam?" Dean called over, looking round as he saw Sam standing by the fridge. He hit the button on the remote and the opening credits began to roll the slow music rising. The younger Winchester froze, waiting on Dean's request; he wanted something, if the look on his face was anything to go by.
"I, uh..." He breathed, looking at his friend, leaning forward, letting his weight fall on his right hand on the bed. "I believe so."
Sam pulled up a chair at the table, smiling as he clapped Cas on the back. "Cas, I can't believe you're awake!" He greeted him, quickly taking his hand away as he felt him flinch under the force of the slap. Though meant kindly, the man clearly wasn't used to being so fragile.
“Dean, are you wearing make-up?” Sam asked, and Dean snapped to look at him.
Until then he was gonna feed Cas as many burgers and steaks as he could. He knew Cas liked burgers, and maybe he could stockpile some iron before he got anaemic. A burger made of spinach like Popeye just wasn’t gonna be as good.
Cas frowned, squinting, repositioning his aim. Everything was a little harder without his grace. Not long ago, he could have shot without trying, hitting it through easy manipulation of physics. He used to know the atoms in a different way, could see how everything worked, would see the wind and know how it might affect his every move. Now, he was looking through gelatine eyes, and everything was dulled. He blinked, tuning back into Dean's words. "You wanna bend you arms just a bit, helps with the kick."
Sam was, at that moment, cursing Dean's timing. His phone began to ring in his pocket just as he and Garth were executing a brutally silent decapitation, unfortunately waking up the one he was standing over.
“Please don’t.”
It took him a few hours, but he finally fell asleep. Dean had, after all his restless shifting, somehow ended up reclining back in the uncomfortable hospital chair with his feet on the bed, an inch away from Cas's own legs.
"He did." Dean nodded, brushing past her innuendo. "That meant to change my opinion?"
“Yup.”
“We didn’t do the bank. That was Leviathans.” Dean explained.
The words still rolled around Dean’s head. “
Can hummed in thought. “I’ve trusted you with my life, so many times, Dean. But I’m not sure if I can trust you to not change your mind again.”
Dean leant against the doorframe, watching. There really wasn't anything to watch, except the slow breathing of the man in the bed. It was reassuring, at least. It was like checking for a pulse; Cas was still there.
to feel good in his body, he craved intimacy, and physicality. He looked at the press of people and imagined being in amongst it, his body pressed against someone else, the gyrating roll of the crowd. Abstractly it looked good, and the thought was stirring something in him that felt like anticipation, nervousness.
"We could use your Casper, again." Dean called, and Sam glanced over. He knew Dean was right. It was all very well and good pointing them to here, but their Dad had practically hoarded this stuff.
"Well," Dean nodded, and clapped a hand to Cas's shoulder, the most intimacy he could muster. "I'm glad you're okay."
"A planetarium?"
"I take it you heard our little plan, then?" Balthazar asked, sensing, rather than seeing, the demons close in behind him. Completely surrounded, though a circle of a few metres around him was clear, just enough room to swing a cat.
"Great." Sam said.
Sam nods, leaning back against the seat. “Sure, I get it. But if you don’t enjoy things while you’ve got them… I don’t know how you’d keep going. Sure, maybe we don’t get things for long, maybe, but like…. I wouldn’t trade my time with Jess for anything. Even though it near killed me when she died, and everything we went through…. knowing I got that time with her, it keeps me hopeful. Like maybe there’s good times ahead.”
“For one night, Sammy.”
"Outside." She told him, simply, looking down to his chest as he panted, moving fast out of excitement and agitation. She knew he didn't belong here, she knew that his very presence was an anomaly, simply by the fact he was breathing. No-one in this endless place had breathed in a very long time. Some? Not ever.
Sam stood. "Right. Let's get going."
Livvie's face softened as she blinked furiously several times. "I'm sorry."
"Yes." Cas recalled the two multipacks, functional for the purpose.
"Anti-possession charm, left it for you on the nightstand." He told him, cracking a smile at the perplexed look on the man's face. "We'll get you something more permanent soon."
But the other was wavering. The other nagged in the background, repeating the words of others, the times that people had said that Cas would never wake up, that he was as good as dead. That Dean had heard the last "Hello, Dean", seen the last headtilt.
“Let alone what, Dean?” Cas asked quietly, and Dean looked back up to those blue eyes, softer now, eyes Dean could just fall into. They’ve spent years staring at each other, looking for something in each others eyes that they’ve never been able to quite put a name to. Maybe they’re close to it now.
"There's the motel." She whispered. "Though I doubt your sidekicks would appreciate me being there."
He span away from it, the sight of it antagonising him, before charging further down the corridor. He passed three more coffee machines, ignoring them all.
Cas wiped his hands over his eyes. "I don't know. I am unfamiliar with the feeling."
“I’ve seen you in here a couple times lately,” She said, and he tried to remember if he saw her when he was here with Charlie. “You new in town?”
“I let my pride monumentally take over all sanity.”
“You think he's lying?"
They spent the next couple of hours researching. Or, at least, trying to. Dean was so agitated by the prospect of a chance that he couldn't sit still, until Sam snapped at him to sit down at shut up; she'd get there when she got there.
"You!" She wheezed. "How could you do this?"
“And I’m thinking… there’s gotta be a better way to do this. We’ve got the army, NSA, got the police force-” Dean pulled a face, which she shrugged off. “The FBI… all of it’s focused on humans. None of it is actually tackling this underbelly. It’s all hunters making judgement calls.”
Eugh, he was clammy as all hell. He pulled the sheets off, shivering slightly as the cool air hit him, and pulled off his clothes, chucking them straight in the hamper, because that was something he had now. They really were getting domestic, he thought as he stepped in the shower, sighing as the water hit his flushed skin. The office shit was weird, right down to the shirt he was wearing. It felt familiar, the flick of the tie over the shoulder. He didn’t wear ties often, was it from when they pose as feds? His brain resupplied the image of the shirt, hazy now, and it came to him in a flash - when Zachariah had wiped them and made them office drones he’d dressed in that suit, and looked like an idiot while he wore them. He shuddered, pushing it away.
“What do you want?” Cas asked.
“Because we earned it. You earned it.” He pushed a warmed plate towards him on the table. “Since when do we ever need an excuse for breakfast foods anyway?”
“No, I know, I’m not blaming here. But, Dean really struggled. I mean, on the surface he was okay, just about. You saw him when you got back, he was drinking loads, getting into fights… he was ruthless in a hunt but he was reckless. He said… he said we never got an out. That we can’t even die.”
Livvie noticed it, and she softened at the gesture, finding herself touched by the sheer humanness of it.
Dean froze. He'd forgotten Cas had ever said that.
Cas watched as Dean walked the distance, kicking at the slight snow that had fallen overnight. He was bulky with all the layers on, claiming more mass than he possessed, a shorter neck from how high the shoulders of four separate shirts climbed. Cas thought back to last night, how he slept in only one thin tee-shirt, the muscles of his arms thick but unassuming, more honest than the layers Dean wore right now. Sam was larger, without a doubt, in height and muscle, jutting and imposing and leaving no doubt as to the fact that he could overpower you in a second. He had no doubt that he was very attractive to some. But Dean, his thinner tone, his softer physique...
“Shifter?”
"Oh, God..." Dean moaned, the events of the previous day coming back to him, having been lost momentarily in the hangover. His head hurt even worse as he remembered what happened, remembered Cas turning up...
"After everything you've done for him, he still treats you like a pet. Doesn't he realise? You were a mighty angel, and you gave up everything for him!" She shook her head, ringlets bouncing. "The other angels don't understand your affection for him. I think I do."
Dean's fist moved fast, aiming straight for his brother's jaw, but Sam was too fast. Swatting away the fist with his superior strength, he pushed Dean back against the counter, head slamming back against a cabinet as Sam caught him in a choke hold.
“Why?” He asked as he dutifully shook it off.
Dean relaxed his jaw, the ache settling in deeper as he watched the road for any critters about to jump out in the night. “You know other hunters get to settle down if they want?”
He dropped the wrist like it burnt him, and it flopped off the edge of the bed, fingers trailing on the floor. That last beat, that last thrum of Dean's pulse, didn't feel like Dean's.
Dean leant back on his chair, watching Cas as he stood up, reaching for his shirt, clearly suppressing another wince at the tug of skin. He wondered what Cas's problem was, what specifically was putting him in such a bad mood. Of course he had a right to be in a less than jubilant mood, he was newly human, he'd just sat through the hours of what was probably fairly brutal pain.
And soon, Dean was alone again with nothing but the radio, his thoughts, and the soft breathing, and occasional snuffled snore, of his last friends in the world. While he had them. But shit, it was good to have them.
Dean came back inside after about half an hour, the cold finally getting to him.
"You do." Cas answered, following Dean's movements, sleep riddled brain attempting to catch up.
Charlie paused, halfway through sitting up from the sofa, instantly frowning. “
You would think that after watching humanity for aeons he would have an idea of what fashion was considered ‘nice’. He remembered how seriously the English Monarchy took fashion, their ostentatiousness serving to elevate their status and demonstrate power. He remembered the first caveman donning animal furs to keep themselves warm. Neither example helped now.
"No. No, he's not our friend, Sammie, not anymore." Dean gestured at the girl sitting calmly on the rock. "I don't know if you remember the past few months, but that guy has put us through hell."
"Hey!" Garth cried, striding straight over with curious swagger for a man so small. "Dean, how you been?"
“Uh, sure?”
“Yes, that’s how driving works.” Cas said. He hadn’t looked at Dean once since beginning the short drive into town, because he was focused like a professional, which Dean supposed was good. At least this car had seatbelts, the Impala never did and it never really came up, but he might consider it if Cas ever drove it. “As you’ve never passed your driving test either, you’re equally unqualified to drive.”
He blinked. You couldn't hide much around a psychic.
“I do. But will you mean it tomorrow?”
Castiel eventually turned off the shower.
Dean blinked in confusion. "Yeah, I know.
“Okay, and you said?”
“I was just gonna have a smoothie.” Sam said, looking towards the blender, shiny and out of place in the kitchen, and Dean groaned.
“During a hunt, I think,” Dean mused, moving his hand to let it catch the light. “Landed on a shard of glass a while back… shallow, but the skin’s thin there.”
They were in another sleazy motel. They seemed to always be in one or another, and they were all exactly the same. Two beds, a television, and some bizarre separator stuck in the middle of the room. The boys could easily navigate the rooms blindfolded, if necessary.
To everyone I saw celebrating Dean & Cas's wedding on Sunday - congratulations! We had a great day, and nothing can take that from us. It's canon.
[10:15 AM] Bradbury: if you had to choose between sharing a car with them or levia-bros?
“Uh, yeah, it was good.” He stepped in the room, and saw Cas stiffen, on edge. “It’s a nice town, the folks are pretty welcoming.”
"Oh, Dean!" She cried, charging towards the hunter and wrapping him in a hug. "I'm sorry, sweetheart."
"And who d'ya suppose is Cas's true love?"
Dean groaned as he woke up. He was fuzzy around the ages, the slightest tinge of a hangover creeping at him, but nothing unmanageable. He rolled over onto his back, stretching out a little, trying to figure out if he was nauseous; no, he was fine. He hadn’t drunk too much, not for him, anyway.
“Interesting,” Cas rumbled out, dropping Dean’s hand and reaching for his shoulder, to place his hand over the memory on Dean’s shoulder. Dean fell into his orbit, knees slotting together, sandwiching Cas against the car but somehow still utterly at his mercy. They kissed, Dean clutching at Cas’s waist, the back of his neck, and Cas kept squeezing, almost bruising again the mark he made so long ago. And then he gripped Dean’s jaw, steering him back, lips tearing away. “I think I see what you mean.”
Really blank. Devoid of anything except the noise he had heard. And the wave of the hand.
"Well," he muttered. "It isn't the complete set without it."
or whatever, Dean could help with that. He would show him what had always worked for him, a crowded bar and a mass of people who would happily help Cas get off. The instant they’d stepped inside he could see it, could see people’s eyes on Cas, shoulders broad in the shirt he’d picked, ass snug in that denim. Not that Dean was looking, really, but he needed to make sure he didn’t look a shambles. But no, Cas cleaned up good.
"Yes. For several moments. He stopped the car."
The door of the cabin banged open, startling them both as they turned to look at Sam carrying two six packs in, kicking the door shut behind him. The giant of a man banged the two six packs down on the counter, shucking off his jacket and complaining about the cold, the damp, how slow he has to drive the half mile to the Gas-n-Sip down the road. He was all noise and bluster, his presence taking up the whole cabin in the instant he arrived, popping this bubble that Cas didn’t realise they’d created.
Dean forced a breath in. Fuck. This was going to hurt, this was going to be cruel.
"Well, apparently their friend, Hilda, was seen at her old house." Sam said. Dean blinked, underwhelmed.
“It would take time, but long term….”
“Instruments or sport?”
"Dean has gone in search of alcohol." He dryly informed him.
She looked at him in the eyes, staring, completely focused, unblinking. Then, she spoke.
They drove to the nearest hospital as fast as they could. Sam took the wheel while Dean sat in the backseat, cradling Cas's head in his lap, alternating barked instructions of "careful" and "faster", yelling every time there was a bump, anything that might hurt Cas.
"Couldn't what?"
Honestly, what’s a guy meant to do with that information? How is someone meant to respond to that?
"Oh, no. I'm giving you a chance to say goodbye. You see, I'm not as cruel as Cassie; I'm not just leaving you to wonder what happened to him. You get your goodbye. Whether it's loving or not is up to you." He heard a static woosh, and a thump, and her voice distant in the background. "Say goodbye to lover boy."
“If Crowley keeps up his end, which he usually does. We’ll cover our backs but we should have one less problem to deal with.”
A car passed them, travelling in the other direction, and Dean cringed as he felt it pass close. He saw Cas sigh.
Dean took a step forward, and so did Cas, and the space between them was thin. Dean’s eyes glowed, practically, and Dean looked at him, really looked. This wasn’t like in the kitchen, with Dean distracted in conversation, happy to be around Charlie, to see Sam back, no. This was Dean, here, in his room, his full attention on Cas. Apologetic, kind, willing.
“Sam!” Dean cried, and Sam put a hand up to stop him.
"For the ritual."
"You okay?" Sam asked, and Dean scowled at him.
Finally, a
"And I did not appreciate it enough." Castiel conceded. "I betrayed him."
“You’ve been judge, jury and executioner for a long time.” Cas told them, reaching forward to grab Dean’s hand. “It could conceivably take a lot of power from you, a lot of responsibility.”
You. But that clearly wasn’t the answer Dean was looking for. “
Dean’s mind flashed back to the shower, coming to thoughts of Cas… He remembered the muffled groan he had heard through the wall when Cas had showered, the looseness in his walk after… Cas sucking his finger after the paper cut… sitting close on the couch, enough to feel his body warmth… Seeing him on the dance floor and knowing, without any doubt, that what he was feeling was
"I dreamt-" Dean began, before shaking his head. "Never mind." He stared at the closed eyes, as if by sheer willpower he could wake him up.
Dean blinked, mouth falling open into an ‘o’, eyes wide and frozen and staring at Cas. They were so green, and Cas could see a smattering of freckles across his nose, paler in the winter months but still there. The light was warm across his face, the candlelight flickering. He inhaled to speak-
?” Charlie clarified, and the brothers looked at each other over the roof of the car.
“Yeah, and it took me a while to find you, sure. But I have eyes
"In my sleep." Dean grunted, spinning the blade in his hand and stabbing it straight into the gut of an elderly nurse with a large saw in her hand. He slashed up, feeling her go limp under him before throwing her to the floor, the light flashing out of her eyes. Balthazar began to smite, but with so many demons at once, and all prepared to fight, he found himself swamped; the preferred method of palm-to-forehead-burn-out too slow when only one, or possibly two can be done at a time. Dean fell back, staying close to Castiel, while Sam stepped forward, attacking any that made it past Balthazar, while Dean took the rest.
"Where are they?" Dean asked, and the man ushered them into the living room, in front of a large bookshelf.
[10:16 AM] Sam: L. At least I’m allowed to kill them
But he stopped. He raised his head to the ceiling and sighed, a long exhale of a breath that he hadn't realised he had been holding. He knew that the pulse wasn't Cas's, and he knew that the warmth was residual. He loosened his grip, instead letting his fingers form a loose curl around the wrist. He reached over, snatching the half drunk bottle he had left on the nightstand. Because, what else was there to do?
“So. We’re doing this.” Dean summed up, smirking at Cas and cocking an eyebrow in a way that he just knew would get a rise out of him. Dean knew he wore that look well, and he saw Cas narrow his eyes, knowing he’d caught it. It was his old reliable move, calling people’s bluff, pushing a button and seeing how they reacted. Right now though, it was an invitation.
"What would you do?" Cas cried. "Dean, there's blood!"
"Shut up. I'm getting Cas a burner too."
"Where you been, Chuck?" Dean asked. "Man, we haven't heard from you in ages!"
He dropped the useless weapon to the floor.
A wave of pain and humiliation raged through him and suddenly he was moving, his hand striking out, hitting the spell bowl from the trolley. It flew wide, crashing into the wall with a loud
"Surely they would impede your plan," He guessed. "Why do you want them here?"
is the one saying he needs to leave the cabin to have sex.”
“The world’s not ready for that.” Dean agreed.
“Does it matter?” Cas asked, and Dean felt his jaw drop as he heard what Cas said. How he told him he didn’t care, that it didn’t matter in comparison to their safety. But Dean couldn’t fathom how Cas felt even
Dean heard the phone ring as he breathed into Cas's mouth, and ring, and ring. After 5, it stopped, and he heard Sam's voicemail message.
"She did not harm me."
Because what could be done?
"He's not happy about it, but he agreed." Sam shrugged. "We need your help."
"Man..." Sam sighed. "Are you going to go after him?"
"Wow." Dean whistled. "Classy."
Dean laughed, the tension breaking. “Terrified’s a strong word.”
"A shower?" Cas repeated, a frown across his face.
He spent much of the journey in thought, though tried not to; he tried to merely think about the first sip of a cold beer that night, but his mind couldn't stay in one place. It kept moving to areas he really didn't want to go to. After all, the point of him being out, not back in the motel, was to get away from those thoughts pressing into his mind.
"Oh, and that went so well." Sam thought of Lisa and Ben, safe knowing nothing of the dangers they once faced. He knew that Dean checked up on them every once in a while, though he never mentioned them.
"Ahem."
Sam scoffed. “Jerk.”
?” Her voice blasts tinny through the speakers, and Cas exhales the breath he hadn’t realised he was holding.
He gripped tighter to the shower rail in frustration. This wasn't meant to be long, drawn out, this wasn't at leisure or ease. He kept pumping himself, refusing to abort the proceedings. This was to get it out of his system, to force the ideas out of his head, so that every time he saw Cas, saw him wandering around half naked, saw him with water from the shower still dripping down his back, saw him in the middle of the night, hair messed up and eyes dark...
Cas blinked hard, a tear falling from his eyes to join those already flowing freely from Sam's.
What would it mean to give a ring to Cas? Cas was new to humanity but he’s not blind to it, he knows about wedding rings. It wouldn’t have to mean a promise for forever.
“Sounds good.” Sam agreed. “So I was thinking… if we’re thinking about doing this-”
"Don't be such a baby." Sam told him.
“Hey.” Dean spoke into the quiet, his voice a little hoarse.
“You all said it’s an easy hunt.”
“I kinda-”
Until Cas said….
“We should get in,” Sam said. “Beat her to it.”
“Not really.” Cas turned another page.
And he’d told her
“I do. Dad held out.” Dean rested his head against Cas’s stomach, feeling the weight of everything crush in. “Cas, I was destined to give up, I get it, but I coulda held out.”
Sam looked up after a while noticing the near complete silence that they had been sitting in for the best part of quarter of an hour.
“Really?” They hear the angry British accent call across. “A summoning? You could have just called?”
"Yeah, it is." Dean agreed, putting the needle back on the table. Sam saw his brother's face darken, his jaw clench, and he took another drink from the bottle.
They got back into the car, leaving the diner quickly after Castiel had a vicious coughing attack, spitting blood into the food. They all seemed to lose their appetite after that, but at least they managed to get a free meal.
"Cas." Dean whispered. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You're right, I've been a complete... Cas?"
“He was killed during the rebellion.” Cas told him.
“Have you planned anything for dinner?” Cas asked, and Dean turned to look at him in surprise. Dinner, at a time like this?
“Sure.”
And then, one day her Father did not return. She waited days. Days turned into weeks, which in turn became months. He never returned.
"Nah, man. Barbados, or something."
words that he knew he had no hope of hearing but may be able to read none the less. He turned, pushing his way back through the crowd to what he hoped was the bar, to Dean…
She fake retched, laughing with him, swatting him away. They walked together, laughing for a minute, before Dean got sombre again, the words settling in. The way he always got uncomfortable when someone thought he was gay, when they questioned why he and Sam got separate beds in a motel, whenever a guy hit on him… Each time his Dad’s voice came back to him, his Dad’s fist.
“Humans have been farming for over twelve thousand years, sixty years won’t have made a significant difference.” Castiel cooly replied.
He glanced over at Dean, surprised to realise that he had spent at least ten minutes lost in the movie. Dean was staring at him, flushing slightly when he found he had been caught, and looked back at the screen. Cas smiled slightly, the gesture still new on his face, the muscle movement unfamiliar in his cheeks but natural all the same.
He wished he could call him now, ask him what to do. Bobby would know. Either that or he'd give Dean the kick up the ass he knew he needed.
"Nothing's gonna happen tonight, I can see that much." Was the reply. "And you really need a decent night's sleep."
Dean didn't know what to say. He didn't know how to react. He didn't know what to do. He just sat there, unmoving.
As he got his breath back, hands clawing at the sheets, he looked up, seeing Dean still asleep on the recliner in front of him. He hadn't woken up. His leg was sticking out from under the sheet, golden tanned and lightly haired. The sunlight from the window was just reaching his toes. Cas sighed, getting out of bed. He wasn't going back to bed, to sleep now. The clock ticked over half eight.
"Olivia." Balthazar spoke softly through lips that hadn't moved in a year. He caressed her cheek, and even Dean could see the care there. If it hadn't just killed Cas, he may have been moved.
"So staying still is the best plan?" Dean chuckled. "We're in a shed that'd fall with a strong breeze, warded or not. We need somewhere safer."
“Wait.”
"Great." Dean sighed. "Fine. You ready?" He asked the man behind him, who nodded.
"No way will one of them give up their blade; not to us."
“It wasn’t fair on you for me to treat you like that, hot and cold. That’s on me, you did nothing wrong. I’m not being a good friend, let alone…”
“Uh, yeah, speaking?” Sam mouthed ‘
.” She told him. This wasn’t what she’d been expecting out of the night. “Have you heard of Internalised Homophobia?” She asked, and Dean shook his head. “Look, I’m no coming-out Jedi Master or anything, I used forums online when I was figuring all this out but somehow I don’t think that’s your jam, even if you did pick up HTML pretty well.”
Dean reminded himself. Maybe that would be enough.
Garth picked up one of the books from the table, glancing it over. "What about Dean?"
"Bill." The old man smiled. "Bill West."
"Yeah, he did good. I’ll check it properly when we get there."
“From the fifties.”
"Yeah."
“Is your objection based purely on Jimmy’s opinions? He’s no longer in this body, anywhere.”
"Morning." Sam called, a little too loudly from the other side of the room.
Without looking, he reached down, and picked Cas's wrist back up. He firmly placed two fingers on the pulse point. He had to be sure.
“For a cop.” Dean stood to grab a coffee, it smelled good.
Cas obliged, and Dean could hear rustling for a moment as Cas settled down, and then silence. Dean frowned, the oddity of the situation hitting him, and he opened his mouth, though was unsure what to say.
Thirty seconds later, Dean was heading for the bathroom, leaving Sam chuckling at the table. He knocked on the door gently, clearing his throat. There was no answer.
"Enochian?" She choked.
"I am sorry for your loss." The angel said, thinking that from what he had learnt of human customs, that was the correct thing to say. He didn't know that it was usually a term reserved for death, otherwise he might have used it referring to Bobby, but he shouldn't.
” Sam yelled, looking between the two of them.
A black Impala drove up the drive, conspicuous in the dry dust. There wasn't much else around, a few farms, here and there, but none within a few miles of the place. They parked, and three men got out, two in plaid layers and jeans, one in a long trenchcoat. They looked up at the building, glancing to each other.
"Dude, what the hell?" Dean cried, eyes flicking from the road to the distressed angel who was examining his finger.
"Ah..." Dean sighed, wiping his eyes and turning back to the road, shaking his head, a smile still dancing on his face. "Let's get you back to Sammy."
"She seemed to know you."
Sam's hand clenched around Ruby's knife.
Dean finally returned to the motel much, much later. And, much like the rest of the day, the night at the bar hadn't gone as expected.
"Dean, maybe we should take her to a hospital?" Sam suggested. They hadn't considered that yet.
Dean made sure Sam was good with getting Crowley out the bunker, and he was certain he was gonna get an earful about that later, but he needed to talk to Cas. He shut the door, blocking any noise back to Sam and Crowley.
But fuck, being on the receiving end of it? Dean’s mouth had dried up like the Sahara, and that was nothing to do with all the dry air from the fireplace. His chest had gotten tight, his heart was beating a mile a minute, and with every extra word and as Dean finally pieced together what the poor guy was getting at-
Dean nodded, looking away again for a few seconds before turning back. “But I’ll try.”
. But no, he could handle a rejection. He was used to it.
Castiel stiffened as he processed the information. Livvie watched as his jaw clenched, as his hands fisted at his sides.
"It's a very similar shade to that of your eyes." He suggested. Dean dropped it instantly.
“Did you use the wipes I gave you?” She asked, and he shrugged. No, he hadn’t.
"It was a long shot." Dean grumbled.
“We don’t have to talk about it.” Cas said quickly, taking a pointed step away from Dean.
The film was over. Dean was plucking at the fabric of the settee, glaring at the credits as they rolled, though clearly not taking any of it in. Sam didn't think he'd been watching for a while, now; the frown had been etched on his face for at least twenty minutes.
"We're cousins." Sam told her, casting his eye to Dean, who was practically twitching, desperate to get to Cas. "I'll do this. You go to him."
"It was your ghost." Dean grumbled. "Why would Dad have anything that worked on an angel? He didn't even know they existed."
“One of the human ones.” Cas said, cupping a hand around Dean’s jaw. “What were you thinking about?”
“We ran.” Sam reminded him, and Crowley rolled his eyes.
Sam looked back at the book, and sighed. "Yeah, I do."
"Okay"
His fingers, as they were wont to do recently, began to trace the patterns in the flask, long familiar after weeks of carrying it. He felt the familiar sting of tears in his eyes, and took another sip of whiskey, draining the dregs.
"I dunno, shouldn't we tie her up first?" Dean frowned, unsure. Like Sam, he didn't quite know what to do with their mysterious visitor. While he was no stranger to women passing out in his bed, this isn't what he generally had in mind.
“Who was it?” Cas asked, finally walking into the kitchen properly and serving himself a cup of coffee, neatly black, before sitting down at the table with them. Cas had really gotten into coffee lately, and had started researching the environmental impact. He’d already convinced them to make the switch to fair trade, and it was hard to grumble at the price hike since Charlie’s magic card.
"Let's see." Dean leant over.
The thought terrified him.
Warning: Spoiler for Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan, if you haven't seen it. Which you should have done.
“You can do that?” Cas asked, and Charlie nodded.
“I don’t think
"I think you're being unreasonable." Sam told him.
“Aren’t you the one who’s always saying there’s more to a diet than beer?” Dean countered, earning himself an approving shrug from Sam. “We’re out of eggs, anyway.”
“I mean, that body held an angel for 3 years, how weak could it be?”
“Just trying to get your attention. Maybe I was overzealous?” He smiled, faux contrition in his eyes.
She scoffed. "Funny, that."
"They didn't just send me down to say hello, they wanted me to pass on a message!" She grasped Cas's hands ardently. "Oh, say you forgive me!"
His powers weren't unlimited any more, he couldn't just use them as freely as he did before if he wanted them to last. He could still be one of the more powerful beings in all the cosmos... if he didn't use his powers.
"I'll take that." Sam agreed.
It seemed obvious now. Her Father had cruelly snatched away her grace, but he would not have put it so far out of her reach that she could not get it back if she truly needed it. He had protected her when he had needed to; when he believed his life to be in danger, he made arrangements.
“Any recommendations?”
“That’s different.”
you didn't get pie?" Dean barked at Sam as he emptied the bag, scrambling to find the promised pastry. "It was literally the only thing I asked you to get!"
"I know how to eat." Cas interjected, and Sam spun around to him, face apologetic.
The door opened easily, no one around to see since they’d moved along the people who used here. Sometimes Cas would bring them sandwiches and tea, would sit and talk with them for a while, and Dean had worried to start with that it might go bad, but he always came back happy. And Dean started buying extra food for them, so Cas could start a damn soup kitchen if he wanted.
"Vokda." She requested simply, and the guy opened his mouth to ask with what, before she flapped her hands at him. He poured it for her, and she knocked it back, before beckoning for more.
"You bitch." He hissed down the phone. "What happened to waiting until he's human?"
“Poor Jeanie, I figured she was a shoo in.” He heard Tasha say, holding up the bottle of whiskey, offering another top up.
Sam blinked. "Well, then tell him that." He said simply, and the older Winchester stepped back, returning to his frantic pacing.
"Anything for you, miss?"
"You know, couple years back. It was flashy."
"Then why didn't you tell me?" Dean demanded. "Why do you keep hiding things from me?"
"Castiel." Livvie said simply, and could see the little girl stiffen in her reflection.
"Cas?" Sam called, and the angel looked up at him. "You coming?"
"Three hounds at the door, and a hospital completely full of demons." Balthazar told him, lifting his own blade.
There was a break in the crowd, a crack through the swarm for just a second, the tiniest second, and Dean saw him, shining eerily pale in the lights, hair dark, skin shining with sweat with his hands on the waist of the guy, pulled close. He was moving with him, dancing so easily, grinding, and he was gone.
“You’re hurt.” Cas breathed, reaching back to him, and Sam winced away.
"Perhaps it was growing up with your father, and his military background?"
"Yeah, I know." Dean sighed, chewing the inside of his cheek. "We don't think you're useless. You just spent a few millennia fighting in a different way."
“No, that wasn’t-” He cut himself off. “That wasn’t him.”
"Cas?" Dean choked out.
Feeling that she had raided all there was to raid in the car; she took the bag and slung it over her shoulder, slamming the trunk. She kicked the car for good measure, before sauntering into the bar, smiling at the name of the place - 'The Angel'.
But, despite the urge to bolt, Dean stayed. Down in his gut, he knew that Cas had come back because Dean had asked him to, and while he knew if he were to think too hard on that he'd probably freak out, it meant that right now he had to be the one who was there for him. He was the one who had to deal with the fallout, even if that meant chick flick moments. So, instead of going back to Sam, he walked past Cas and sat on the edge of the bathtub, away from Cas's reflection and now able to see his face properly. If he was told to leave, so be it.
"Dean." He croaked, and the hunter turned round, almost unbalanced under the influence of alcohol. Cas could see the red in his cheeks from the liquor, and wondered briefly if this was to be a repeat of the night before.
He frowned, beginning to notice something that had been left ignored until now, something that, with all of the other sensations that were new in this body, had not been forefront in his attention. Now he looked down, glaring at his crotch as he realised that blood had travelled there, causing it to swell without his bidding. He remembered this had happened before, and at that point he'd simply willed it away, not an option now. He tilted his head, unsure how to proceed. He knew the mechanics, knew the biology, but faced with an erection, he was unsure what to do, or if he wanted to.
“That’s not what he meant.”
“Yes…” Cas prompted, feeling Dean shift away slightly.
“Cas-”
"Dean." Sam warned, and Dean glanced sideways.
“Barely.” Cas grumbled, and Dean grinned at him. Cas watched as he handed over their coats, taking paper tokens in return, pocketing them. He steered Cas away, heading down the crowded corridor, following the beat of the music as it got louder and louder. Within seconds the room opened up, larger than Cas had expected, into a wide hall, high ceilings and flashing lights. Across the other side of the room was a stage on which a man in a very de constructed fire-fighters uniform was gyrating for the audience who cheered him on. Cas could barely hear anything over the sheer
"Why aren't you fighting this?" Livvie asked. "You could over power me. I'm still just a human!"
It didn’t look good. Wow. He looked a mess. This wasn’t a good look. He had to get rid of this,
Cas shook his head, beginning to move to the bathroom. "Hustle is a verb, Dean; you can't 'get it on'."
Dean groaned, remembering last night. Fuck. Genuine, actual, fuck. Oh, wow…. this was gonna be so awkward. Like, levels of awkward that even
“I suppose…” He thumbed a line gently along Dean’s lower lip. “Watching from afar, and walking alongside you are two very different things.”
If ever there had been a time for Castiel to hug Dean, it would've been then. He might've broken through to what was buried beneath the anger, he might have managed to reach across the big, gaping hole in their friendship and put a tightrope where there once had been a bridge. But he didn't. Instead, they both got distracted by Sam, who had sat up, awakened by Dean's yell.
Cas was gone.
"Him?" Olivia blinked. "I only ordered a drink! Hardly a difficult order."
Dean raised his eyebrows. "No worrying over here. Not an issue."
“Imagine the world if you hadn’t,” Cas turned Dean’s hand over, examining his fingertips, smiling as he scratched a nail into Dean’s fingerprint. He could feel Cas’s breath on his skin, and if this is how Cas was treating his hand, one of the few parts of Dean that was visible on the regular, what was Cas gonna be like if, when, he got Dean naked. Dean shifted in his seat, and Cas looked up. “Is this okay?”
"Have you ever partaken in this activity?" The angel asked, though suddenly regretted his question when the hunter looked back at him, coldness in his eyes. He shut his mouth and shuffled slightly uncomfortably; he had forgotten, just for a moment, that it wasn't how it had used to be. Dean was no longer in the mood to satisfy his curiosity about humanity, no longer willing to answer personal questions about himself. He was barely willing to have Cas in the same car as him.
He smiled, reaching back to touched Cas’s flank, feeling skin against his hand. Real. Not a dream. That happened, last night happened. “Morning.” He sighed out, pressing back deliberately against the dick against his ass, and he felt breath tickle against his skin.
“You’re not ready.” Dean told him firmly, grabbing his shoulder and pulling him back. Back in the day Cas could only be swayed by this when he wanted to be, could let Dean push and pull him, or stand his ground. As he finds himself forced back he realised now how much he’d taken that for granted, how much he’d allowed that to happen, that a part of him had liked allowing Dean the illusion of matched strength. Now, however, it frustrated and infuriated him, another example that Dean could use in this ongoing argument, that he thought Cas was
“No, Dean.” Cas said softly, stroking the back of his head.
The hunter hesitated briefly, looking at the doubled over angel, but as he quickly straightened up, his face betraying no more pain, he quickly went back to his anger.
"Maybe..." She sighed, cocking her head. "Haven't decided yet."
It was at times like this that he really missed Bobby.
"I was concerned." Cas admitted hesitantly.
"You alright over there?" Dean asked. Cas didn't look at him.
Cas raised an eyebrow, silently calling him on it, and Dean blushed a little. “You’re right, it wouldn’t reflect well.” He joked, and Dean sighed a little, trying to relax. They fell into silence for a minute, both of them trying to figure out the dynamic here, and somehow Cas felt at home in this. He had never been sure of the right thing to say in human society, with Dean, with each passing day feeling less and less sure in himself and his choices. Right now, with Dean struggling too, it felt like he’d been practising for this for years.
He took the hand away and looked down at it, toying it between both of his. The skin felt so frail, and he knew if it were to be cut, it would bleed, not heal as it used to. Moving it slightly, the light caught the thumb, and Dean saw the faint line of the paper cut a few days ago. Still not quite healed, Cas's first real, human glimpse at a mortal wound.
“Because.” Cas sighed out, the words coming slowly, firmly. He wasn’t even looking at Dean now, and he felt the rejection sit on his shoulders. He suddenly felt small, and Cas felt so far away. “I don’t trust that you’ll still want this in the morning. I won’t let this be another regret.”
"Can you even do that?" Sam asked. "I mean, the last we saw..."
“Are you asking my safe word?” Dean quipped.
"You know how to wake him up." Dean finished.
Cas frowned, not in the mood to try and decipher Dean's wording. The hunter, sensing Cas's mood, shrugged, rolling his eyes.
“And Crowley probably wouldn’t knock.” Sam said.
Cas was staring at him still, mouth slightly parted. God, it was like when Cas had first landed in his life, how he stared at Dean because he didn’t know he shouldn’t, that it was weird, that it made people uncomfortable. He was the sole focus of his attention right now, and Dean was pinned under his stare, unable to get away. He felt…
Castiel's face was pale, paler than it used to be. Days of comatose-bed-rest would do that to a guy. It lacked the warm flush of life. But something seemed lacking. Or rather, didn't.
She let go of Dean and took a furious step towards the angel, but in doing so managed to kick the bin out of the way, into the corner of the room, with herself blocking the way for the both of them.
The angel smiled, elated at Dean's joy.
“Oh, I have the moves.” Cas replied, surprising himself with how easy the retort came, recycled straight from Dean’s own words. Cas hadn’t thought about how he’d wanted his words to land, but Dean’s eyes darkened. Dean was enjoying this.
"Apparently not," Dean agreed. "She looks like she's... waiting."
Dean shook his head in disbelief at the conversation U-turn. “Charlie, what the fuck?”
"Ca-cas?" He finally managed. There was no sound but the breathing on the other end for a few seconds.
Dean stood up, climbing off him and reaching down his hand for Cas to grab, to get back up. He wasn’t meeting his eye, the connection from seconds ago lost. “This
Dean suddenly realised where his eyes had wandered, and abruptly moved them back to his burger, taking a too large bite. Angel or not, it generally wasn't considered polite to stare at a woman's breasts.
Leaving the car in the lot, he walked onto the high street, checking out each shop as he went along. It was coming up to five in the afternoon, which meant that, for once, he was going to start drinking at a socially acceptable time. Not that it mattered – the Winchesters were so far outside of the realm of social acceptability that an arbitrary rule like drinking hours didn't matter to Dean. Sam, for some reason, was kicking up more of a fuss these days.
There was a long wait. Dean knocked again, and wondered briefly whether they should simply break in, but the door was opened, and an old man was standing behind it.
"Yeah, well; that's what he's got us for." Dean told him as he stretched, arms high above his head, curving his spine after the long journey. His neck ached, and he rolled his head, trying to ease out the pain. It was minor compared to some of the injuries that the boys had incurred over the years, but it was still a general nuisance. "How's your shoulder?" Dean asked, nodding to the blood stain on Sam's shirt. The younger Winchester winced, and Dean nodded again. "Let's get inside and patch it up."
Having paid and received the tattoo aftercare speech (and pamphlet) from Kirsty, they left, Cas walking stiffer than usual, a little straighter. Dean chuckled as he pulled out his phone, leaning against the car. Sam picked up after the third ring.
"Sure." She smiled, brushing past him and leading the way, instinct and intuition taking her.
And in Dean’s eyes today? He could see that glimpse of what had been missing.
“No, he did everything right. He never let go of his gun, when I did.” Sam shrugged. “He needs a bit more prep with people skills, but in a fight? I think he’s up to speed.”
"Was bound to happen eventually." Dean replied, glancing down at Cas.
. They don’t understand the long game. I need a show of power.”
But he had hated himself for a damn long time. He hated so much about himself, he hated Dean Winchester, everything about him. He’d been putting on a show for such a long time he didn’t even know what he was under all that. And somehow Cas was chipping his way under it, he had for a long time.
“I’ve fought in combat before.” Cas grumbled, experimentally chafing his hands together. His fingertips tingled, numbness already setting in. He knew combat would warm them both up but right now they were standing around and talking, which wasn’t doing much to get his circulation going.
"So you're saying, until Cas can take care of himself, we're staying here?" As if to prove a point, the wind outside picked up a little bit, and an audible creak from the walls rung through. Sam shook his head at the noise.
"You are so very young, Olivia." The angel sighed. "Do you wish for so large a sin to be on your conscience?"
"Commando?" Cas repeated, frowning.
“You bring up…
in the middle of negotiating with several key members of the United Nations.”
"Oh, boy, what have you done to your hair? Those sideburns are just gonna eat up your face."
"Don't... don't tell anyone." He commanded.
Dean moved his head to chase Cas’s hand, placing a kiss against it. It felt good. “I do want this.” He said again, and Cas nodded. “Last night, this morning, it was good.”
“You know, uh,” Dean bit out, squeezing his eyes shut for a quick second before looking over at Cas. “You know that’s not easy for me. I’m not good at that.”
"Yup." Sam confirmed. "She made it worth the bartenders while to lie to you."
Cas looked sadly to Sam who was still standing there, but as they made eye contact Sam's eyes dropped to his feet, and he followed Dean, leaving the angel, alone and unloved, at the edge of his watery grave.
. And it was scary now, but God… he wanted it.
"Of course not." Dean retorted.
now, he was confident. He could fight, he knew it. But Dean cited Crowley again, that he was a target, but when he glanced to Sam and saw him shrug, he knew that wasn’t the whole reason. Dean didn’t believe in his abilities. Dean didn’t believe in him.
“I mean, specifically,” Sam sighed, trying to piece the words together as best he could. “If your friendship changed into something else. If you guys got… romantic?” Sam finished hesitantly, and Cas could see the trepidation on his face. Oh.
"Oooh, burn." Livvie winked.
“Don’t be a baby.” Dean had scolded, squinting at his own piece, trying to figure out if it was cleavage or a boulder in the dirt road. “It’s not that bad.”
Dean groaned as they walked to the clothes shops in the mall, seeing the skeletal mannequins laden with whatever excuse for 'fashion' was current right then. He moved them past the worst of the offenders, leading Cas into one that seemed as neutral as it could get.
Cas frowned. “How?”
Sam looked over to his sleeping brother in the next bed as he put on his shoes. It was half six in the morning, the time that he always got up for a run, not long after Dean would finally get in from drowning his sorrows at whatever local hovel there was. Sam had been with him once or twice, to keep an eye on him, to perhaps glean some drunken insight into him, but he rarely struck anything deep. It was mainly just Dean's drunken insights on cleavage.
Sam frowned at him. "You planning on shooting some cans on a fence?"
"At least he's talking to you now." Sam pointed out. He patted the angel awkwardly on the shoulder. "He'll get better."
the water pressure was great in this bunker) but it was now absolutely necessary. He ran the water over his face, scrubbing with his hands and using some of the face wash he’d bought in a nesting whim. He saw his hands come away gray, which he supposed was a good thing, but when he glanced out into the fogged mirror he could still see it all around his eyes and streaked down his face. “Fuck.” He muttered, reaching for the body soap.
"Aren't you usually the in-bed-by-nine one?" Dean scoffed, sitting down and pulling the laptop towards him.
Cas braced himself.
“Kinky bastard.” Dean joked, lazily pressing a kiss on Cas’s sternum, chasing this soft happiness he was finding here.
Cas sat down on the bed. "I remain well." He said patiently. "Though it was not as safe as I had expected."
"Yeah, sorry-"
“I’d like to see it.” Cas mused, tracing a fingertip over a cartoon of a cow thoughtfully, and Dean smiled with affection.
Tasha wandered away when one of the women from the table strolled over, beelining straight for Dean. She was hot, polished, clearly out on the prowl and he respected that. He bought her a drink. She asked him where he was staying, when she trailed her finger down his ring finger, seeing it empty…
He sat bolt upright, shocked into consciousness by Sam's voice.
"Well." The old man huffed. "Well then, I'd better ask you to leave. I have to go to visit my wife in the hospital."
"Don't care." Dean shrugged him off, continuing his march to the car. "He knows how to wake Cas up. We're calling him."
And it had crashed so completely around him.
today. He picked at the corner of his eyes, scraping out the crust that had formed overnight and blinked his eyes open. They really felt crispy today, way more than usual in the morning. Okay, time for a shower.
He was right. When he got back into the room at 8, sweaty and in need of a shower, Dean was still asleep. He had rolled over, and the covers were wrapped around him tightly, though had fallen off on one side, leaving his right leg exposed. He was still frowning.
. He kissed Cas because right now every reason not to felt wrong, felt so, so stupid, because it was the only way he could say it. That Cas had his respect
"Same as ever." She told him, practically singing with her southern lilt. "No worse, though."
"Anarchy, my dear. It is such a shame we do not know what to do with our new found freedom." She smiled. "But enough about me. Tell me why I'm here."
“Why would I need a wet-wipe?”
Sam sighed, looking up at his older brother. "And we gotta be careful, Dean." He span off his palms, finally, turning to face Dean properly. "We can't be going on big hunts right now, we can't just walk around like no-one's after us."
“You can come in.” Sam told her, as Dean muttered nonsense about Indiana Jones. She stepped out onto the balcony, and her mouth dropped open in surprise as she took in the bunker, and Dean felt a surge of pride in the place.
Cas had come back to the bunker with all kinds of crap… the conservatory really wasn’t that big. He’d bought a wormery for the kitchen, which sounded unhygienic as all hell and that would have to be a fight for another day, hundreds of flower bulbs, a couple of bug hotels, whatever those were, and a box load of proper-gators trays, which Cas had explained multiple times was not to do with gators in swamps (yet Dean kept riling him up, just to get him to talk, to see that eye roll, the exasperation).
“Will do. You too.”
The Bible ended up coming back to the cabin with them. Sam had arrived several minutes later, worried and ready to attack in case this 'Cas Vanishing' thing turned out to be something bad. As it was, when Dean explained what had happened, he'd nearly doubled over laughing at it, and was happy to see that under the frustration, Dean clearly found it hilarious too, the twinkle in his eyes evident, and even allowed himself small smiles when he'd glance in the car mirror, seeing Cas in the back seat, still holding the Bible.
"I forgive you." The angel said, and Livvie looked up again.
"We'll have to get you a nurse." Dean mused out loud. "A hot one. Wonder if Obama Care covers that?"
beat. Dean was looking straight at Cas, waiting for permission. But there was no reason to wait, and every reason to press on. Ready as they’ll ever be. Cas nodded at Dean, and Dean looked to Sam. Okay then.
"Dean, I'm all but useless."
"Did too, and you know it."
Dean snapped back, taking a step away from the bed, tracing his fingertips over his lips.
“There’s a reason he liked this deal.” He told Cas, and surely he would get it, that if Crowley was happy with this offering then it had to be bad. Maybe Cas just didn’t get it, he hadn’t been human long enough, in the hunter life for long enough, but he would know what angels would think of him? Surely that was bad enough, right? Why wasn’t he getting it? Why didn’t he get that this
"Real helpful, Sammie." Dean huffed, pacing back and forth. "A church? Would he go to a church?"
"Including..." Sam sighed. "Cas's sword."
"Like what?" Dean snapped.
“I- I…” He heard Dean stutter.
Sam walked in, big, galumphing and sweaty. Dean pulled back, he hadn’t even noticed that he’d been leaning forwards towards Cas, but he instinctively pulled away, smiling at his brother. “Mornin’, Sammy.”
"You remember how he is." Sam reminded him, standing in the door way, having changed his top. "He can barely work out which way up a badge goes."
“Oh.” Sam sat up in his chair, fully departing from his book. It’s time to finally talk about it. “Sorry about that.”
“He’s right, I was the untrustworthy one in our partnership.” Cas reminded him.
Dean's hope seemed to be splitting in two.
Cas was standing in front of the sink, hands curled around the curve of the porcelain, staring in the mirror. Dean blinked in surprise, despite being prepared for any manner of bathroom activities. Somehow he hadn't been quite prepared for the sheer expanse of skin, naked from the waistband of his hospital pants up. The unflattering light above cast shadows on his back, trenches under his shoulder blades, each bump of his spine. From the door he could see the curve of his back around to his side, the soft skin under his arm. Dean wondered if he was ticklish.
“Uh.” Dean’s brain ground to a halt again. Fuck. He hadn’t even thought about that. Cas had probably been waiting on a response. Cas had been waiting for him to say it back and instead he was freaking out, not panicking, just being the worst self he could be. Cas didn’t deserve this, he deserved someone whole, someone who could say shit back, who could-
“Of course.” Cas took Dean’s hand, closing the gap between their skin, and Dean let himself to relax into it. This was okay, they could do this. Could he kiss him? There weren’t many people around, and realistically none of them were looking, but could Dean actually push himself to do it, to kiss him like he wanted to, like he’d so recently built up a habit for?
"I don't know." Sam breathed.
“Well maybe that’s the problem.” Sam responded, flicking through pages. “We’re just running and hiding, every time. Maybe it’s time to fight back.”
Sam clenched his jaw, watching his brother as he rummaged, weighing up the pros and cons. He saw the danger, all the risks of calling the angel for help, but what he also saw was his big brother rummaging desperately in the trunk of their car, desperately looking for hope.
Cas’s brain ground to a halt, the answer obvious, but also unreachable. He knew what Dean was asking, but he answer was aloof. “Because your cause was just, and heaven was wrong.”
Oh. “When I said I-”
“I thought they liked…. something else.”
Cas had to be careful in future. He held a power over Dean, he could see that now. This friendship, this affection that Dean felt for him, he couldn’t abuse it. Perhaps he should even leave, let Dean carry on. Cas was human now, and humans survive. He would find a job, some income, rent a room and eat and sleep and defecate and do what humans do until they die. Maybe he would even find some joy in it.
“Wasn’t sure you’d pick up,” Dean drawled back at him, a swagger rolling through Dean that hadn’t been there a minute before. This was bluster, Cas recognised, enhanced confidence to not betray his nerves. He knew it well, had seen it before. “Didn’t think we were on the best of terms, what with you trying to blow us up not so long ago.”
And Cas didn’t seem to care. Cas didn’t care that what he was offering, he couldn’t get back. That when someone thinks that of you, you’re never coming back from it.
They ended up back in bed, regretfully mindful of Sam’s text’s to both of them, though Dean had  offered a blow job in the kitchen just to spite him, one which almost physically pained Castiel to turn down.They dragged themselves back to Dean’s room, and Dean had knelt at the foot of the bed and taken Cas in his mouth for the second time. It was slower going, several orgasms already under their belts in the last twenty four hours had taking the edge off of urgency but hadn’t hampered on this need for closeness which had erupted in both of them. Dean had taken his time, gotten used to the shape of Cas, eager and exploring while Cas petted his hair, his shoulders, the line of himself in Dean’s cheek. It was addictive, having Dean like this, being allowed this, and while he’d only known it a short time he knew it might kill him to have it taken away.
Sam shook his head. "Yeah, maybe." He looked down at his knees.
“You wanted to cook.”
"Yes, some." Castiel agreed. He began to walk towards the motel with Sam.
“I know.” She smiled, folding her arms across her chest. “But now I am ready to be
"What the hell did you do?"
They got into the car, and Cas sat down heavily. Dean raised an eyebrow and sat down too, closing the door behind him. He went to start the car, but glanced back to his passenger. The angel seemed different, he seemed... upset? Angry?
“It’s fine. I’d lost my V-Card to Shirley Lester a couple years before anyway, so…” Like that had been the point.
"Dean." Sam called, clearing his throat, expecting Dean to jolt awake suddenly, but was surprised to find that he merely opened his eyes, somewhat blearily. "We're here."
“You’re still upset about that?” Crowley chuckled, and Cas narrowed his eyes. Dean was nervous, but so was Crowley. Interesting.
"Nice to meet you Dean." She said. "Now, can I get you anything?"
Cas looked around, unsure of what to look for. It certainly was different from their usual eateries, quieter, soft music twinkling through from a piano being played across the room, each table laid with a table cloth, lit candles casting warm glows. If it was nice, Cas couldn’t call, but if Dean was uncomfortable… “Dean, you know I would have been happy anywhere.”
“Yeah,” Dean waited until Sam had taken a few steps away before letting himself touch his fingertips to Cas’s arm, calling his attention. “See you in a bit, yeah?”
Dean laughed a little.
Dean frowned, unsure as to whether Cas understood quite what he was asking. But then, when it came to saying humorous things, he rarely understood what he was saying.
Dean was trying to get his attention again. “
He seemed to have been making some progress on the computer – he had managed to call some form of menu screen up – before he heard Dean's call.
He lowered his hand.
Teasing the fabric up, the shirt reached her bra, and he stroked the silky material there, squeezing gently and chuckling at her slight gasp. In retaliation, she reached down, groping to his crotch, anticipating the hardness she was to find there. Instead, she was somewhat disappointed.
“They keep life interesting. Demons are irritating, fetid. The fun is in the chase.” He winked at Dean, who grimaced. “Dick Roman is scared of you, wants you boys, specifically, dead. Which makes me think you’re the ones with a chance of getting rid of those oil stains for good. Not to mention the fact that out of all the fights you’ve picked, every battle you’ve fought, every
"Dean thought so too." Cas agreed, tugging out plaid shirt, unsure what to choose.
“Drink.” He agreed, glancing down at the board. Nothing nearby, some werewolves thirty miles out but they weren’t gonna handle that right now. “You wanna go out?”
Cas knew that while perhaps his judgement couldn’t always be trusted, but they could certainly trust his ability.
That was the crux of it, wasn’t it? That’s what Cas was saying. Cas deserved better than to be dragged along by Dean, to have something for one night and then for Dean to flip the tables the next day. He’d be constantly waiting for the next twist and he’d hurt Cas each time. Cas deserved so much better than Dean.
“Good.” Dean nodded, staring at the menu with a frown. They sat for a minute in silence as Cas looked through the menu, trying to figure out what he might like. It was hard, so many of these flavours would be new to him. He’d already found out what he enjoyed out of Dean’s repertoire, and he enjoyed trying new foods, picking out strange items in the supermarket and attempting them, but this was different, committing to an entire meal. He looked up at Dean, who was still frowning, and Cas felt a wave of regret.
“Dean-”
“I’m still not clear on the why.” Dean said, taking a step away from her.
"Cas?" Dean looked up to see the angel standing beside him on the deck. As the hunter was seated, the angel towered above him, but that wasn't the only thing that was off. "Is that you?"
"The dream team lives." He sighs. "Sort of. When am I going to be done with you lot?"
"It was an honour to meet you, Castiel." Missouri said as she stood up, squeezing the angel's hand.
"Oh, that doesn't sound too good." She cooed. "Is it the whole Dean thing? Because I could give your sweetheart a little encouragement if you wanted."
Dean frowned, glancing around. “How the hell do you know that?”
“I stuck my nose where it didn’t belong.” She said. “I was getting the wiggins from him, and the other big bosses, so I started looking round the computer systems, doing some deep dives. It was all normal, regular boring business stuff, and then I got into Dick’s drive. Then it wasn’t.”
"This place has three goddamn rooms, Sam. I want some me time, I gotta go sit in the bathroom." He leant back hard in the chair.
It had been a
"I don't care." Dean spat.
Dean held the phone to his ear for a few seconds, before lowering it slowly, staring at it. His jaw was set, eyes fierce, seething.
"You're just sand in an hourglass, Cas." She told him. "You can try and stop it from falling, but sooner or later, there's not going to be anything left."
"You okay, Cas?" Sam asked, and looked over to Dean.
“That’s the best way we’ve found too.” Sam agreed.
"I don't do 'clothes shopping'." He told him with a shudder. "Shoulda called Sam."
"She did not go into detail; she merely made it clear I was no longer welcome there."
"Does any land truly belong to anyone?" Cas asked sagely, and Dean rolled his eyes, determined on acting like nothing untoward had just happened.
He briefly wondered if he preferred how it was before, being a devoted angel of the lord, whose only fate in his existence was to follow orders. Nothing was difficult, everything was clear cut and simple; now there was choice and heartache. Now he had free will, and that was difficult.
Sam found the basement key in kitchen drawer, grimacing as the light persistently flickered when they turned it on. “Bingo.”
Dean swallowed, and disentangled himself from her, turning around and standing by the window. "Don't worry about us, it's Cas you're here for."
He was uncomfortably close to Cas, close enough to see the pores of his skin, the faint, purple shadows beneath his eyes, the dry chap of his lips. He'd been this distance from the angel many times before, Cas having little concept of personal space, but this was different. This was Dean invading.
“Seriously?”
"Because it's a ghost! We hunt those things; we don't take advice from them!"
"Yeah!" Sam told him. "One of things last year that..." He trailed off, rephrasing. "You kept stuff from him, and that hurt. If you want a way to earn back his trust, this is a start."
"Why are you calling, Chuck?" Dean asked. "Not that it's not great to hear from you, but..."
"Um," The hunter frowned, wondering how to recap. "You were in the hospital for a few days. We tried everything we could think of, every source we had, but you weren't waking up." He scratched at the side of his face, glancing up, knowing that Cas needed to know. "And Crowley stopped by. Plus half a hospital full of demons."
“Everything okay?” He asked, looking over. She was hot, was the first thing Dean noticed. Tight jeans, a leather jacket and long dark hair that flowed down her back. She was looking at them, and Dean wondered for a second if he was being checked out, almost bringing out the charm, but then he actually looked. She wasn’t checking
. “You’re offering to fuck him?” He finally spluttered out, and Crowley rolled his eyes at his ineptitude as Cas patiently explained. He wasn’t offering his body, not really, he was offering his
He paused when he saw a familiar name. Bobby. God, Dean missed him. He'd always been a constant presence in their lives, a second Dad while they were growing up, and even more so when John died.
” Dean yelled, muffled to Cas’s ears, and he tried to follow as the crowd got thicker. He could see they were heading for a bar but was losing sight of Dean, and he frantically grabbed his sleeve, forcing his way through, following the pattern of plaid in the sea of skin and fabric. It cleared a little as they got to the bar and Dean pushed his way through to the front. “
He was a coward, he’d hurt Cas, over and over and over again, and yet now it was
Sam and Dean were well seasoned professionals at avoiding surveillance cameras. Dean, after having worked out roughly where they all were from the computer, kept his eye out and successfully managed to skirt each one, keeping to the shadows as best he could. He let Sam be his conscience here; care needed to take precedence over the situation – if Livvie caught him, their plan was dead.
"CAS!" Came the yell, and he was suddenly awake, scrambling in the covers, breath coming hard and fast, sweat sticky on his back. His heartbeat too quick as he tried to focus his vision, still half lost in the blue sky and the white clouds. His vision started to darken, the sky quickly fading as he adjusted to what was actually there. Dean Winchester, a hand around his ankle like it was the first part of Cas he'd grabbed for.
He opened his eyes to see what he'd spilled being washed away down the drain, all evidence of the deed done, but Dean knew... He scrunched his eyes shut, trying to block out the knowledge that he'd just got off to the thought of Cas.
Cas just blinked, unsure of what to say.
And then there were hands. He felt it, one hand with a strong grip on his right forearm, gripping almost painfully right, tugging him inexplicably up, up, up and breaking the water. Sucking in a huge lungfull of air, he opened his waterlogged eyes, trying to make out what he could see.
"Dean-"
"Well, maybe it ain't my place to say, but he sure does seem awful fond of him..."
“Okay, no need to be rude.” She joked, at Dean waved her off playfully. “And you?”
Crowley turned to Cas, looking him up and down. “As much as I’d like to say
When he left the bathroom, towel wrapped firmly around his waist, Dean was awake, blearily blinking in the dull light.
Dean glanced up as Sam threw on a jacket, a nod in his direction as he left the cabin to take a leak while Cas occupied the bathroom. How long was he expecting Cas to take in the shower?
He didn't know how to end. Was he meant to say 'amen'?
“These human bodies are
She saw him land in the field, in the mud, on his hands and knees. She saw the angel sob, saw the tears fall, saw the hurt in the angel and the confusion at the horrendous harshness and intensity of this brand new experience.
"I can't just sit around here, waiting for you to wake up." His throat caught on that, no small spark of guilt landing with the words. He knew he shouldn't blame Cas for this. The angel did this for him.
He could feel the rough graze of stubble under his fingertips, and he tilted his head, stroking it softly. Did it seem darker than usual? The angel had always sported a five o'clock shadow, and maybe he was imagining it, but he could've sworn it was worse. His fingers played along the grate of it, stroking up and down his cheek, enjoying the texture. Without thinking, his fingers travelled along, back down from his ear, and landed at the man's lips. His fingers didn't stop, mapping the texture, first the soft line where skin met lip, and then just further in, scraping the chap of his lips. He remembered the feel of them against his, warm, but unresponsive, different, but utterly right.
“Wait!” Crowley looked between the crossbow and the men in front of him, eyes nervous now, all sparring done. “I haven’t sent any demons after you in
“So I was thinking,” The words came out all in a rush, and Cas looked up, sensing the tone change. Dean could feel his heart thudding in his chest, and he forced his breathing to keep steady. He could do this, he’s asked a thousand chicks out. But Cas wasn’t the thousand and first chick. This was Cas, his best friend, the man he’s fought beside and fought with a thousand times before. This was Cas.
Dean pulled a face, chucking a crumpled napkin at her. “Gross, what is wrong with you?”
He tensed, wary. "What?"
"No, it wouldn't." Dean confirmed to himself. He exhaled firmly, looking back at the book, but his eyes wantonly drifted back to Cas.
It was really cheap for what it meant. He knew this crap was meant to cost thousands, be a few months pay, though he supposed as they didn’t get paid it was hard to care. But he knew it was right, that this one was right.
Dean was lying. Sam knew that much.
"Sounds like a haunting to me." Dean agreed. "Finally, something to do!"
"Balthazar is alright?" He asked, and Sam could see his face light up slightly. Of course he would be happy that his friend was safe; he had died bringing him back to life.
Sam pinched the bridge of his nose. "We could call an angel? Take their blade?"
"Get pie." Dean reminded him. "Seriously. The last one I had was three months back and it was as stale as Bobby's old hat."
." He explained.
"Whilst I am guilty?"
She tracked the Winchesters like they hunted their monsters. Eventually she managed to catch up with them, slowly following them from town to town, gathering information. They would know what had happened to her Father, she was sure of it.
“What’s happening Sam?” Cas asked, and quickly put him on speaker.
Dean had wandered on by this point, onto his third bottle of the pack. He double checked the protection sigils plastered round the house, and found his way back to Cas's room again. He was exactly as he had left him, not a muscle moved.
They waited as the seconds ticked by.
Cas frowned, confused. He had already unbuttoned the shirt that he had borrowed from Dean, and had begun to shrug it from his shoulders when Dean had cried out. He couldn't understand Dean's sudden reaction over this, mentally replaying Dean's various rules concerning personal space and nudity, now confused as to the point of the both of them being in the room. Besides, he had been semi naked twice in Dean's presence in the last two days, with less reaction that this. He paused, unsure how to continue.
"Do you mind if I grab some of these?"
Cas caught Dean, scrambling hands under his arms, trying to hold the weight of the hunter.
“You should go to bed.” Cas told him, and Dean bit back the words on the tip of his tongue.
She stroked her hands round, dancing across the skin that lay beneath the shirt, lips never parting. Then, suddenly, her hand moved down, playing with the thicker denim there, and squeezing gently.
“The bunker is heavily warded. It should keep out any demons.” Cas pointed out.
Cas tilted his head, moving on to the next display, frowning at the more gothic images before him, skulls and devils and all manner of things he would prefer not be to permanently stuck to him. "You realise that the bible says not to do this?" He reminded him, a small smile on his lips.
“Come on, Dean, you’re being ridiculous.” Sam scoffed, hauling a duffel bag over his shoulder and heading towards the garage.
"Sure you were." Dean glanced back as Cas watched him, and he turned a little so he was facing the wall, so that Cas wouldn't catch an eyeful. He was wearing boxers, sure, but they were a little snug around the front. It was a fact he was usually proud of, but tonight, with his friend who had no boundaries, and who kept giving 'little-Dean' feelings he didn't want to think about, and was currently topless in front of him... Dean felt like he was practically giving him a strip-tease. "How come you're sleeping commando?"
Couple hours drive from them, easy. Dean and Sam looked at each other, and shrugged. He saw Cas raise an eyebrow, and Dean marvelled for a minute at the expression on his face.
“Yeah, for long enough, as good as salt anyway.” He shrugged.
"Aesthetics were not my priority." He defended himself, and she scoffed.
Cas leaned forward, the long stretch of his back curved in a way Dean tried not to notice, clicking open the compartment and rummaging around. “Is this it?” He asked, holding out a small sachet, and Dean grabbed it, too careful to only touch the plastic, not Cas. He tore it open with his teeth, one hand on the wheel, and quickly rubbed it roughly across his chin, catching all the places that felt crusty. He hoped he got it all, any trace, but then felt at a loss with what to do with the napkin. He tried to shove it back in the packet, one handed, and let it fall to his feet. He’d get rid of it first chance he could.
“Take a shower man, warm up.” Dean told him as he checked the fridge, eyeing up dinner. Cas nodded, shedding his jacket, damp and caked with mud from the grass. He plucked at the denim of his trousers, also sullied. He left them on the floor in the bathroom, shivering even more in the cold room, goosepimples spreading across his body.
