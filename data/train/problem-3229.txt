It was dark by the time that Sam and Garth showed up.
“They found all of my lock picks,” Sam complained when he noticed that Dean was awake.  “Even the ones I sewed into my jacket sleeve cuffs!”  Well, shit.  These demons were smarter than average then.
“I can see for myself what Castiel did with him, and I will handle the situation accordingly.  Now, you have your orders!” the dickwad snapped.
SUPERNATURAL
“No – feathers are not just about looks Dean, they are about function.  A warrior should never go into battle with unkempt wings,” Cas insisted with a forcefulness that took Dean by surprise.
"One of...?" Dean prompted.
"That won't work against him, Sam.  He is much too powerful to be a Trickster...," Cas interjected.
"If there is anything worth dying for... this is it," Dean pleaded.  That spark in Cas' eyes was growing bigger.  Dean felt like he was really reaching him.
"They should respond to your desire to have them manifested or hidden," Cas told him.
“If the warding was underground, then I’d also have to be underground to detect it.  Why?” Cas replied.  In response, Dean held up a brochure that had been on the table – one of the local attractions was the Cave of the Winds.
“I uh, got carried away,” Cas replied, looking down.
The plan that the others came up with sounded do-able.  Well, at least Gabriel thought that Lilith would most likely show up, and if any of the other angels were watching, they shouldn’t realize the change in plans until it was too late to interfere.  Gabriel still insisted that he wasn’t going to get directly involved in the fighting because he didn’t want to blow his whole ‘personal witness protection program’ thing.  However Gabriel did agree to get some of his trickster buddies to play a few crucial roles in the plan.
“Just shut up if you aren’t going to say anything helpful!” Sam snapped, and Dean was proud of his brother for somehow actually getting Balthazar to finally shut the hell up.  “What if I came to you?”  Sam started using his overgrown legs to try to push his chair towards where Dean, Cas, and Balthazar were imprisoned.
<I’ll get the can of pie filling> Cas signed back.
“Matching backpacks?” Dean sputtered.  He could hardly believe he was seeing the two brightly colored blue and green backpacks in front of him.
“Keep quiet!  The demon wasn’t working alone!”
When Dean woke up he was disoriented. It took him a moment to realize that he had a physical body again. He had almost forgotten what it felt like. Dean was somewhere cold, dark, and cramped. Fumbling around, he found a lighter in his pocket just where he always used to keep it. When he flicked it on, his fears were confirmed. Dean was back in his old body alright – trapped six feet under.
“Hey Cas – would you be able to detect the angel warding if it was underground?” Dean asked between bites.
“It’s not in great shape – I think they were running some tests on it . . . ,” Sam started to comment, but stopped when he noticed the look on Cas’ face.
“Well, yeah, but – did you have to make us look so gay?” Dean protested.  Sam really couldn’t hold back his laughter at that one, which earned a glare from Dean.
"No, that can't be true.  Heaven is just.  Heaven wouldn't condemn an innocent man back to Hell and intentionally destroy all life on Earth," Cas insisted.
Cas smiled when he saw Dean watching him.  Then he apparently decided to show off, because the next thing Dean knew they were flying in a corkscrew spin that no bird could ever hope to achieve.  As the world spun around them, Dean expected a bout of nausea that never came.  It took Dean a second to realize why – there was no pull of gravity in this dimension.  If Cas stopped flying, would they even fall?  Or would they just hover in place with no force to pull them back towards the Earth?
“Because I found an angel feather they left behind.  I didn’t realize it was an angel feather at first or I would have said something sooner.  I thought it was some sort of a bird feather . . .,” Sam explained.  Cas narrowed his eyes at this, possibly feeling insulted that angel feathers could so easily be mistaken for bird feathers.  Dean was no expert on bird feathers, but he was a little more sympathetic to Sam since Sam couldn’t see the angelic energy that surrounded angel feathers.
“But I’m human!” Dean protested again in vain, not wanting to accept that his new wings had made him less human than he realized.
<You learned more signing!  For me?  Thank you!> Eileen signed, a big smile spreading across her face.  She attempted to initiate an awkward hug with Sam, and succeeded after two false starts.  It reminded Cas of the awkward learning experience of his first few hugs with Dean.  Eileen clearly didn’t have much experience with hugging either, but perhaps like Cas, she could get better with practice.
"Clean your room first ya idjit. You made so much noise trashing the place that ye damn well nearly gave me a heart attack thinkin' something else had come after ya," Bobby scowled. But Dean knew Bobby well enough to hear the worry in Bobby's voice caused by Dean not acting normal. That same worry and confusion was written all over Sam's face too.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
“What?  Of course not!” Dean snapped back angrily before he caught the look on Sam’s face.  Crap – he’d fallen for one of Sam’s traps.  Logically, Dean and Cas had both been in the same boat – both unable to penetrate the angel warding.  But while Dean would never have even conceived of looking down on Cas for being limited in that situation, it didn’t mean he felt any better about having fallen prey to it himself.
.  Dean definitely had to teach Sam a thing or two about
"Ah, when your conscious mind is at rest. Next time that happens, let yourself adjust and get familiar with them," Cas suggested. Dean sighed.
"Henriksen?  As in Victor Henriksen, the FBI guy that took forever to finally understand that we weren't the bad guys?  Wow, I didn't expect him to ever actually use our number," Dean replied, shaking his head in disbelief.
"The one and only!  But don't spread that around.  I've been in my own private Witness Protection Program for centuries, so call me Loki," Gabriel replied with a flourish, clearly enjoying the spotlight.
“Trolls under a bridge – really?  We couldn’t have gone for the case with the herd of rabid jackalopes?” Dean yelled into his cellphone.  The forest was near pitch black because of the new moon, so he had to be extra careful not to trip as he ran.  Dean had argued in favor of spread the rumor that it was the Full Moon that would take away Sam’s immunity, but his vote had been overturned because nobody wanted to wait for the Full Moon.  Waiting longer to spring their plan into action would run the risk of Zachariah commissioning other supernatural beings to assassinate Dean.  Apparently Zachariah wasn’t known for his patience.  So now Dean was stuck running through a dark forest while being chased by living rocks.  Just peachy.
Energy rushed out of Dean's back, and he suddenly felt a huge jolt as his wings spread out and put the brakes on their free-fall.  Pain flared through his wings and where they connected to his body, but the important thing was that they now seemed to be gliding instead of falling.  More importantly, Dean had managed to keep Sam firmly in his arms despite the jolt.
☆ ★ ☆
“This is way below the belt, Sam – tell him, Cas!” Dean snapped.  Sam was cutting himself a slice of what smelled like a very high-quality pecan pie, all the while making a big show of licking his lips in anticipation.
"Yeah Cas- um, Castiel talked to me. But his voice seemed to hurt you, and he said something about how most people couldn't hear his True Voice," Dean explained, a tenderness creeping into his voice without him realizing it. Whoever Cas was, he seemed to have a lot of heart. Sam looked disappointed that he couldn't talk to the angel too, but shook it off pretty quickly.
Multiple faces?  So Dean felt like he was looking in multiple different directions at once because he now had more faces and eyes than he was used to?  Stumbling to the bathroom mirror to see for himself was more of a struggle than he anticipated.  It felt like his different faces were fighting for dominance because it was surprisingly hard to figure out which part of his vision was the forward-facing part.  Then, of course, there were the wings, which were agitated because he was agitated.  Dean was pretty sure he cracked the door frame on the way into the bathroom when one of his wings flapped right as he was trying to go through the doorway.  The stupid wing hurt afterwards too.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
“I suspected, but I knew you’d charge in regardless of anything I said,” Cas replied cooly.  Dean couldn’t argue with that.  Cas knew him all too well.  Besides, he really shouldn’t be taking his anger out on Cas.  None of this was Cas’ fault.
“You can't run.  Not from me. I'm inside that angsty little noggin of yours,” Alastair sneered, continuing to come closer.  Maybe Dean could successfully gank Alastair with his angel blade if he got close enough, but only if Alastair didn’t see it coming…
I’ve got all the ingredients for you to make burgers tonight.  Want me to pick you up anything else while I’m at the store?
When the light receded, Dean had been transported somewhere else. Standing right in front of him was a very startled Sam. Unfortunately Sam happened to be standing in the middle of a vampire nest. He had just chopped off two of the vampire's heads, but there were half a dozen still undead and kicking. However Sam was so started by the sudden appearance of his formerly dead brother that he momentarily forgot about the other vampires.
“Hey – do you smell sulfur?” Dean asked as he sniffed one of the two tunnels that Cas had been referring to.  Just because he didn’t have his angel senses working at the moment didn’t mean that he couldn’t make his other five senses useful.
“Snacks?” Dean perked up and checked inside one of the pouches.  “Bird seed?  Really Sammy?”
☆ ★ ☆
“We aren’t far from a spot by the lake that would be ideal for lunch,” Cas announced.  Dean wondered just how far Cas could sense, and how much of it was done with his wings.
“I told you not to try to fly,” Cas reprimanded him.  “You’re lucky that you didn’t do worse damage to your wings.”  Dean felt the relief of Grace soothing and healing his wings.
“That won’t do,” the demon said, sending Sam back to where he started with a flick of his hand.  Dean could see demons’ real faces again for the first time in years, and he tried to push back the memories of the last time he’d been able to do that.  The demon chuckled and took a few steps towards Sam.
☆ ★ ☆
Eventually they had to break the kiss so that Dean could catch his breath.  Cas’ eyes darted to Dean’s wings, his pupils were getting darker and more lust-filled at the sight.  Dean looked at his wings, and saw them completely spread out and angled in a way that was very open and…. oh!
Dean wasn't really sure what he was supposed to 'watch' since there was no swirl of light or anything.  It looked like Cas' angel blade just slipped down into his hand out of nowhere.  Cas must have sensed Dean’s confusion, because he retracted his angel blade and then rematerialized it a few times.  Dean blinked blankly back at Cas, unable to discern anything.  Maybe they were wrong and Dean hadn’t absorbed enough angel mojo to do this.
☆ ★ ☆
During the “fledging” (feather growing process), Dean was finding himself both eating and sleeping a lot more.  Cas explained that the process of growing feathers consumed a lot of energy, which explained why Dean’s body was demanding more food and sleep.  Sam used this as an excuse to encourage Dean to eat even more healthy food, claiming that “Superfoods” would help give Dean an extra boost.  While Dean didn’t mind the excuse to eat blueberry pie, he drew the line as soon as Sam started talking about some sort of algae.  So instead, Dean snuck out of the bunker while wearing his backpack and raided the nearest convenience store, buying all the beef jerky that they had in stock.  Since Sam had been too squeamish to buy all of his requests before, Dean made sure to stock up on condoms, Astroglide, and a few new toys while he was out.  As his wings grew, Dean wasn’t sure how easy it would be to continue to hide them, so he wanted to make sure he had a good stash on hand for when Cas was ready to take things to the next level.
"Jerk," Sam retorted.  From the confused look on Cas' face, the brothers' familiar banter had not been considered important enough by Heaven to be included in his briefing.  But to Dean, the banter was part of his anchor to normality even when everything else in his life had gone bat shit crazy.  It was comforting.
Finally!  After all that practice, Dean was finally able to consciously feel it when Cas touched his energy.  Dean wasn’t sure if it was just time and practice, or if it had to do with his new feathers, or if it had something to do with spending so much time just as energy while Cas healed him.  In any case, Cas was too eager and excited to let Dean process for very long.
“No Sammy – you’re right,” Dean replied.  “We’ll figure this out – how I can adapt – just like we always do.”
"Yeah, well – the only thing big enough to distract a giant is another giant, so you're welcome," Dean replied.
Cas brought his wings out as well, and wow – Dean hadn't really had a chance to fully appreciate them before.  While Dean's wings were an iridescent hunter green, Cas' wings were a majestic iridescent royal blue.  The wings were made of pure energy – Cas’ Grace.  As the energy danced about playfully, the wings shifted about as if they were fluttering in an unseen breeze.  The effect was spellbinding.  Cas’ wings were not only one of the most beautiful things that Dean had ever seen, but he yearned to feel that shimmering Grace against his soul.  It was surprisingly hard to resist the urge to touch.
"At this point, Vegas money is on yeah," Bobby replied.
It felt like it had been hours when Sam and Garth finally emerged.
Dean’s hands naturally found their way to Cas’ wings.  Dean started with slow gentle strokes of Cas’ feathers, mirroring the sentiments he was licking into Cas’ mouth.  That got just the kind of responding moans that Dean had been hoping for.  Dean grinned into the kiss, only to find himself moaning too a second later when Cas started stroking his wings.  Dean automatically fluffed up his feathers and leaned into the touch.  It felt so good, so good.  Dean tried to savor every single touch.

"Dean, stop constantly turning your head like that – people are going to think you're paranoid," Sam whispered as they got to where they were going to meet Henriksen.  Dean hadn't even realized that he'd started doing that to compensate for only having two eyes.  He felt strangely blind having such a narrow field of vision, and it wasn't helping that he was still nervous about meeting up with Henriksen again.  Sure, the dude had finally realized that they were the good guys, but that didn't mean his FBI buddies would see it that way if any of them were monitoring Henriksen.  Then of course there was whatever supernatural creature who was hunting Dean to worry about.
“Sorry,” Sam mumbled.
After spending so many years as a disembodied soul, connecting to his soul wasn't particularly difficult for Dean. His soul didn't have all of the filters his conscious mind did, so the longing for wings came through quite clearly. The two parts of himself felt very disjointed. Even though Dean's conscious mind still had its reservations, he tried to give his soul permission to do what it wanted.
“Hold on to your horses, ya idjit.  I’ve got the lore books right here, and it says that trolls are vulnerable to fire…,” Bobby’s voice reassured him.
“Right,” Balthazar replied, not really sounding convinced.  “A Winchester who is part-angel – Father help us all.”  With that, Balthazar popped out.
“No you’re not,” Cas called his bluff.  “You’re exhausted from fledging.  You can’t push through on so little sleep when the feathers have consumed so much of your energy.  Get some sleep Dean.”  Now it was Cas’ turn to stare Dean down and win.  Dean was at less than 100% and they all knew it.
The gas station was completely deserted. It was actually kinda creepy just how much of a ghost town this whole area was. Dean's skin crawled with the suspicion that whatever pulled him out had to be a seriously powerful badass if his presence had cleared out the whole area.
Dean smirked, and waited for just the right moment to toss another rock at the first giant.
Dean started trying more carefully to untangle himself. Yep, whatever was wrapped around him was definitely attached to his body, and he could feel it when he touched them. After a moment of fumbling, Dean managed to un-cocoon himself. The two new fluffy appendages were attached to his back. Wings. Dean had wings. What the hell?
"We do have need of Dean's services, but I assure you that I mean him no harm," Cas assured them, not seeming to be offended by Bobby's mistrust. Bobby still looked doubtful, but Sam seemed much more predisposed to believe an angel. Sam turned to Cas with some of the biggest puppy-dog-eyes that Dean had ever seen (and that was saying something since he'd been the one to raise Sam).
"And why would an angel rescue me from Hell?" Dean asked.
"Based on the briefing I was given about Sam, I doubt that he will consider himself in a position to judge you, especially considering what he is. But Dean – it is important to remember that on some level your soul wanted this for you. You will only hurt yourself if you try to ignore it. Neglecting your soul will also increase the likelihood of your soul forcibly manifesting your wings against your conscious will," Cas told him. Well shit – Dean's usual coping mechanisms of ignoring his issues and hoping they went away wasn't going to work in this case.
“Hey!” Dean protested at the sudden complete darkness.
"Wait! Wait! It's just Cas!" Dean shouted, throwing himself in between the guns and the now trench coat clad angel. He had no idea if guns could hurt an angel, but he wasn't about to let them test that on Cas. A few sparks were still flying from the exploding lightbulbs, but Cas looked completely casual about the effect he was having on the room.
“Sam is fine – his minor injury was easy enough to heal.  But I can’t take you back to the physical world until you are more healed.  Your physical body is not strong enough to sustain you yet, and it is easier to heal you here.  Don’t worry – not much time will pass for Sam while we stay here,” Cas explained.
<This is your problem Dean. You have no faith.>
☆ ★ ☆
“I don’t want to fly,” Dean stubbornly insisted, ignoring the opposite message that his wings were trying to send to his brain.  Cas studied him closely, and Dean was sure that Cas saw right through him.  But part of what made Cas so awesome was that the angel didn’t push him.  Even though Cas was probably eager to teach him to fly, Cas wasn’t going to push him when he wasn’t ready.  Dean was sure he was
"Really, Sam?" Dean asked.  His coyote head rolled its eyes, but his squirrel part eagerly sniffed at the nuts, so with a sigh from his human mouth he fed some nuts to his squirrel mouth.  They were surprisingly good.
“Dean!” Sam was beside him faster than he could blink.  Poor Sam looked worried sick, but he looked healthy and completely healed so Dean couldn’t help a small grin.
Just like that, Dean knew that the being was gone. Dean had surprisingly mixed feelings about that, but he didn't have time to dwell on that now. Sam was hurt, and that took priority over everything.
"Shove it up your ass," Dean retorted feebly when the now familiar offer came yet again. The days when Dean could say it with venom seemed like a distant dream. It was getting harder and harder to keep fighting. After many years of trying to stay firm in his resolve to never break, Dean could feel his strength crumbling and knew that he didn't have very many protests left in him. Even though Dean wasn't much of one for believing in miracles, he knew that it would take a miracle to save him from caving in to Alastair's demands soon. More than anything, Dean didn't want to be turned into the kind of monster he'd spent his whole life fighting, but he was just too tired to keep fighting the good fight alone.
"An angel? An honest to God angel?" Sam repeated dumbfoundly. "Do you believe it?" The hopeful puppy-dog-eyes were back in full force. Sam was always so eager to believe in angels, but it wasn't so easy for Dean. Dean had believed his father when he told him that every supernatural creature was evil. After their mom had been killed, and all of the (sometimes literal) Hell they had endured, it was hard to believe that there could also be good supernatural beings out there.
"What do you want with me?" Dean asked.
Cas simply nodded and manifested two additional faces with enviable ease.  They glowed more brightly than Dean's extra faces, and they were different animals, but otherwise it didn't feel like Dean and Cas were that different.  Dean wasn’t sure what he’d expected Cas’ other faces to be, possibly some fierce warrior animals that would terrify anyone who saw them on top of a Chrysler-building-sized True Form angel.  But instead, Cas’ other faces were more… quirky choices that seemed to be more reflective of the weird little dude’s personality.  There was a honey bee on one side, and a cat on the other.  Dean found himself smiling when he realized that they really seemed to suit Cas.  It made him feel a little better about having a squirrel face too, since clearly not all angels needed to have fierce warrior faces.
☆ ★ ☆
☆ ★ ☆
Just then Cas moaned and started to stir, so Dean was immediately right by his side.
“Do you think Cas was worthless on this hunt?” Sam retorted.
"The barrier... I tried to come after you, but I couldn't...," Cas sounded more distressed and shaken than Dean thought the angel could get.  Were those tears threatening to spill from Cas' eyes?
Dean's favorite word – awesome – just had a return to its roots. The sight before him was both absolutely incredible beyond words and the single most drop-dead terrifying thing he had ever seen. Seriously. Thirty years in Hell had nothing on this dude.
“Is the place where angels normally keep their wings?  The place where, since I got my wings, part of me exists all the time?” Dean asked.  It was really weird to think about his body being both here and in the physical world at the same time.
The beanstalk suddenly shook with one tremendous force, and the loud crash sounded like the giant above them had suddenly fallen to the ground.  Dean clung to the vines for dear life as the force of the impact vibrated him up and down by multiple feet with every vibration.
☆ ★ ☆
“Can you scout the cave system?” Sam asked.
Suddenly Cas put away his extra heads and wings.  The Impala was on its way back to the motel.  The Impala was three blocks away, but with Dean's enhanced hearing he could still hear her approaching.  More time must have passed than Dean realized if Sam was already back with the food.
“I didn’t turn Dean into a part-angel,” Cas corrected, which was true – Dean only had himself to blame for his transformation.
“Alastair,” Dean spit out the name with disgust and hate.  “Didn’t think you liked how cold it is topside.”  Dean tried to keep Alastair talking while he figured out a plan.  He was good at manifesting his angel blade on command now, but if he lunged at Alastair and missed, it would be bad if Alastair spread the news about Dean’s new angel mojo.  Should Dean pray to Cas?  Cas should be finishing off his troll right about now and heading to the rendezvous point.  But what if Alastair hurt Cas?
"Who's your friend?" Henriksen asked, glaring at Cas for essentially calling his cousin a liar, but Cas was unfazed.
“But I’ve never been physically unable to provide backup if you’d needed it.  I was completely worthless,” Dean argued.
"Shh – it's okay Cas.  We're alive.  We're okay," Dean soothed.  Cas nodded, the corner of his lips raising upwards in looked like a weak attempt at a smile.
“Cas is your hunter-in-training.  Does his vulnerability to angel warding prevent him from being a good hunter?” Sam continued playing devil’s advocate.
"The important thing is that you are back," Sam replied, pulling Dean into a tight hug again.
Dean coughed and crossed his legs awkwardly when he realized that he'd been transfixed by the gorgeous spread of Cas' wings.  Maybe Dean's new form liked Cas' True Form a little too much.  For once in his life he needed to slow down and figure this out.  If Cas realized the effect that he was having on Dean, the bastard gave no indication of it.  Cas just sat there intently studying Dean while fanning his feathers.  Dean bit his lip and tried to think of a conversation starter, but his big brain (big brains?) was having a hard time doing the thinking when Cas was looking like that.
“Fascinating Sam, but I’m more interested in what they are doing in this century,” Dean interrupted before his brother could start a long geeky lecture on medieval demons.
“Wait,” Sam interrupted with a grin.  “Is this a date?”
"It has grown to a rather impressive size," Cas commented.
If I’m going to have to put up with you and Eileen being all lovey-dovey all weekend, the least you can do is get me a damn pie, Sam!
"He is a devote man. He actually prayed for this," Cas replied. Dean raised an eyebrow at why anyone would pray to become some angel's prom dress.
“This still isn’t the real you, is it,” Dean stated, not really meaning it as a question since Cas didn’t really seem all that different from usual.
"I was about to break! If you hadn't come when you did...," Dean protested.
"Well that is one of the ways I'm considered a bit strange among angels," Cas replied.
The two of them continued down the trail for a little way.  The wind was still slightly distracting to Dean, but it felt good to be moving again.  Cas had been right – there was a great spot for a picnic right next to the water.  Dean couldn’t help grinning as he helped Cas unpack Cas’ backpack with the food (including the individual servings of pie that Sam had actually remembered to buy!).  This not-a-date was going perfectly.
The three civilians offered their help in the final battle, but Sam and Dean both turned them down.  Once you were in The Life there was no way out, so it was better to not let civilians get in too deep in the first place.  But it was nice to get some of rare ‘thank you for your help’ type speeches that most civilians were too busy screaming and running away to bother with.
“Alright, alright,” Dean conceded, trying not to smirk at how excited his brother looked.  Sam gasped in awe as he touched Dean’s wing.  Dean could have sworn that Sam mouthed the words “so soft” but Sam at least was smart enough not to say the words aloud or Dean might have had to smack him.  The feeling of Sam’s hands on Dean’s wings felt oddly calming and comforting.  It was kind of relaxing actually.  Between both Sam and Cas’ hands on his wings, as well as Cas’ Grace flowing through him, Dean could just feel the tension melt out of his body.
“I found traces of angel wing oil on his hands!  So for my first trick I’m going to force him to materialize those wings,” the demon replied.  He opened a bag full of very sharp familiar looking silver instruments that made Dean’s stomach plummet.  There was no way that he was just going to sit here and let his baby brother be tortured.  There had to be something he could do.  Dean started frantically tearing through Cas’ backpack looking for something he could use.  The demon was apparently not smart enough to consider a warded Winchester to be a threat, because the demon completely ignored him.  Instead, the demon just kept grinning like a kid in a candy store.
The trunk of the beanstalk was as large as a fully grown redwood tree, with thick vines cascading down the sides.  It was hard to tell just how tall the beanstalk was, but it seemed like it was a few miles tall.  Cas could probably tell them down the centimeter just how tall the beanstalk was, but Dean didn't ask because he honestly didn't want to know.  The best way to the top was just to keep focusing on putting one hand in front of the other, and not to think about just how high they were.  Dean thought he might be sick if he thought too much about it.  He hummed Metallica to himself to cool his nerves, and give himself something else to focus on besides the climb.
“I’m glad you can still drive her for a little longer,” Cas replied.  Years of insisting that the Impala was indeed a “her” was finally rubbing off on Cas.
☆ ★ ☆
“Hold up – I thought I couldn’t be flown while I was fledging,” Dean quickly interjected, dreading the answer he suspected was coming.
“Shit!” Sam suddenly exclaimed.  “Did I hurt you?”
☆ ★ ☆
“Dean, I know it sucks to travel that way, but we’d save a lot of time if Cas could just fly us up there,” Sam suggested.
It felt like a miracle when they finally reached the top.
The flight with Cas was actually quite short, and Dean noticed that they were descending when he saw the scenery coming closer.  Panic momentarily welled up in Dean as he feared they would somehow crash, but of course they didn’t.  Cas gave his hand a reassuring squeeze as they sailed right through the surface of the Earth like it was nothing, flying down into the cave system underneath.
They were back on the seraphic plane.  Cas had Dean engulfed in a tight bear hug, pinning his wings to his body.  Balthazar was flying besides them carrying Sam (in a much less intimate position).  Dean could feel Cas’ grace coursing through his body, trying to heal whatever damage Dean had done by forcing himself through the cracked ward.  The pain was still pretty bad, but it was getting better with each passing minute.
Dean didn’t want to admit it, but the feeling of Cas and Sam going through his wings and removing all of his loose feathers felt pretty awesome.  Even without looking, Dean could easily tell if each touch was Sam or Cas because they both felt so completely different.  Cas was a lot better behaved than during all the teasing earlier, and didn’t do anything that would have made Sam uncomfortable to be around them.  Instead, all the gentle touches were just lulling Dean into a more and more relaxed state, and he caught himself starting to nod off a few times.  Dean was aware of Cas and Sam talking quietly amongst themselves, but he wasn’t really listening – something about wing oil and how that wasn’t something Cas planned to teach Sam.
“How about this?” Cas continued, and started peppering the thinner energy surrounding Dean’s neck with kisses.  Dean squirmed and moaned, going crazier than usual with the neck kisses that Cas was so fond of.  Were neck kisses an angel thing or just a Cas thing?  Because Dean could’ve sworn that neck kisses had never been this good before.  Dean tried to twist himself around so that he could get to Cas’ neck at the same time as Cas was giving him neck kisses, but Cas seemed a lot more interested in giving than receiving today.  Cas was practically devouring Dean’s neck with a ferocity that seemed very determined to make Dean become completely lost in the sensation.  Soon Dean could barely breathe, let alone return the kisses.
"Demons don't have the power to create something like that.  This is something else we're dealing with," Cas replied.
"Shut up, bitch," Dean groaned.  He was never going to live this down.  What part of his crazy soul thought 'Dean Winchester: fierce hunter & cuddly squirrel'?
"G-God? What the h-why would God want with me?" Dean stammered.
Bobby and Sam both lunged for their shotguns just as the front door flew open and a figure walked in.
“So had Balthazar,” Dean replied.  He stared Cas down until Cas looked away.
“Yeah Dean, you look pretty good,” Sam replied, with more fondness portrayed through his eyes than his words.  “Just in time for battle too.”
Dean opened his eyes just in time to see Sam plummet past him, freefalling a few thousand feet above the Earth.
Sam took the first shift driving, since it was still daylight, while Dean laid down out of sight in the backseat.  Every single bump on the road sent tingly vibrations through Dean’s wings.  At first Dean tried to think of it as a novelty – maybe if he just closed his eyes and relaxed he could pretend that it was angel-style magic fingers.  But these vibrations just didn’t give him the same kind of pleasure as Cas touching his wings did.  This just felt like sensory overload since his new “pin feathers” seemed to amplify vibrations much more than his down feathers did.  Dean felt an onset of a headache coming on, probably from his brain trying to figure out how to interpret these new sensations.
“Dean – that is futile.  Any object that was last touched by an angel or an angel’s grace is also repelled by the warding – otherwise it would pose little hindrance to us,” Cas explained.
<God is real.>. Dean noted with satisfaction that the being seemed taken aback by Dean's flippant attitude.
Dean could tell the moment that Sam completed the angel warding symbol.  He could definitely sense an invisible barrier between him and Sam.  It felt very cold and hard, like a void of energy that just screamed “wrong” at all his senses.
Dean instantly knew that Sam was home, not just from the sounds of doors slamming, but from the delicious smell that was wafting through the bunker.  Mouth watering, Dean was racing through the halls of the bunker in a split second.  Sure enough – in addition to a few grocery bags, Sam was also carrying a pie.
“You’re enjoying this?” Cas asked unnecessarily, as if it wasn’t obvious.  Dean let out a nice moan to make his enjoyment perfectly clear and fluffed up his feathers.
"What kind of angel stuff?" Sam asked with a frown.
“Don’t make me change my mind about buying you a backpack,” Sam threatened.
<So do you want to make out?> Dean continued, repeating his other earlier mistake.  Cas sighed, his eyes subconsciously drawn to Dean's soft pink lips at the thought.
<I can help you make breakfast> Cas signed.  He knew that Dean was usually hungry first thing in the morning.  Cas didn’t really need to eat, but he sometimes ate when Dean cooked because it made Dean very happy to share meals with him.  According to Sam, this was because Dean was “nesting” with extra enthusiasm since Cas had moved into the bunker with them.
The troll screeched to a halt when it saw the burning pile of logs.  It roared at Dean, and started circling him, trying to find a way to get to him without getting too close to the fire.  But Dean didn’t have time to waste waiting for the troll to come to him.  So he started throwing hunks of burning wood at the troll.  The first one landed on one of the troll’s feet.  The troll howled in pain, hopping on one foot while it tried to swat at the fire burning on its other foot.  Dean took that opportunity to throw another chunk of burning wood – and beaned the troll right between the eyes.  With another holler of pain, the troll fell over with an earthshaking crash.  Then, while it was riling on the ground in agony, it evaporated into thin air, just like the blue ox had previously.
"W-what the hell do I have to do with the apocalypse?" Dean asked, his voice coming out weaker than usual.
“You will?  Awesome!  Thanks Sammy,” Dean replied with a grin.
“Something tells me bored teenagers aren’t responsible for the art project,” Dean commented with a groan.
Cas watched with amusement as the brothers texted back and forth.  Dean repeatedly rolled his eyes and sighed with exasperation, but it was all part of their good natured banter.
“Idiot.  You actually think that boy is an angel?” Balthazar apparently couldn’t keep his mouth shut.  But the demon must be used to all of Balthazar’s yammering by now because he just rolled his eyes.
<Not just me> Sam signed after he and Eileen pulled apart.  Eileen turned and noticed Dean and Cas.
Cas initially froze.  He gave Dean a look in the rear view mirror that clearly said, “Dean – this is not the appropriate time or place for this,” and nervously glanced towards the still-oblivious Sam.  But Dean knew just how to make Cas completely forget that Sam was even there.  Dean worked his fingers through the feathers to stroke the skin around the base of the quills.  Cas quickly fluffed up his feathers in happiness.  Dean took this as a green light to explore all of Cas’ wings with his fingers – slowly, inch by inch.  Normally Cas would be moaning up a storm by now.  The music on the car stereo skipped a few times though, which showed that Cas was losing control in other areas.  But unfortunately, the music skipping was enough to get Sam on alert for any potential problems.
“Not a chance,” Dean agreed.  Not that this was a “date” but he liked the idea of being out in nature, just him and Cas.
The look of fear on Sam’s face was enough to propel Dean into doing something very reckless.
“Feel what?” Sam asked, glancing back and forth between Dean and Cas, while looking even more confused than Dean felt.  Cas wasn’t exactly being forthcoming, so Dean took pity on his wingless brother.
“I don’t know, as I cannot sense anything inside the wards,” Cas replied unhelpfully.
"Maybe there's a detour to the castle?" Shayna whispered hopefully, but even just her quiet whisper was enough to make one of the giants stir in his sleep.  Apparently the giants were very light sleepers, which was just freakin' perfect.  They needed a distraction so they could slip by unnoticed.
"Maybe it heard my prayers," Sam whispered reverently, but Dean could hear the pain behind Sam's words that betrayed just how broken Sam had been after Dean died.
Unless Dean really knew all the right words all along.
Wings.  Dean hadn't managed to manifest them on command before, but there had never been a moment where he wanted wings more than he did right now.  He reached inside, deep within his soul where he could still feel the energy of his wings, and begged them to come out.
“Pie is not just mere sustenance, Cas,” Dean insisted.  “Come over and have a piece and you’ll see.  We’ll plot our revenge later.”  At least Sam knew how to select a good pie, so some of Dean’s lessons must have stuck.  Dean would give Sam credit where credit was due.
“I’ll uh, take Sam back to his hotel room,” Balthazar was saying.  Dean then watched the weird sight of Balthazar and Sam shifting back to the physical world.  They both slowly became bright red swirls of energy that otherwise seemed frozen in time along with the dark red background.
“Sam!  Hurry and pick the locks!  You have to…”
…,” Sam tried in vain, talking so fast he got impressively far before the demon used his powers to clamp Sam’s mouth shut.
“There are hot springs in that direction.  This area has a lot of them, and they all smell like sulfur, just like the demons do,” Sam explained.  The wind coming from that tunnel did feel warmer than the wind from the other tunnel, so there probably were hot springs down there.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
“Possessive much?” Dean joked once he could breathe a bit better again.  That just made Cas blush even more, which was way more adorable than anyone had any right to be.
"I can't – there's no way I can leave them out without Sam and Bobby finding out," Dean protested.
“This isn’t over!” Dean warned Sam, and then Dean moaned as the sweet taste of pecan pie caressed his tongue.
An idea occurred to Dean, and he set about trying to find some long sticks.  He managed to find two sturdy sticks and tried to use them like a large pair of chopsticks to lift up a small rock.  It was rough going, and he almost dropped the rock a time or two, but then he used the sticks to fling the rock at the building.  Since Dean hadn’t actually touched the rock, it sailed right through the invisible wall and connected with one of the wards.
Dean slept most of the next few days, which was just as well because it was a convenient way for Cas to spend time healing Dean.  Sam spent most of that time trying to do research at the local Hot Springs library, but didn’t come up with any usable leads.  After Dean started feeling a bit better, Cas ended up flying Dean back to the Bunker, while Sam drove the Impala.  Normally Dean would have protested, but he was still a lot more wiped out than he was trying to let on, and he knew that he wasn’t really in good shape to be driving yet.  He’d have to make it up to his Baby later.
Dean wasn’t even aware that he’d stopped and closed his eyes until he sensed Cas watching him with amusement.  He felt himself turning red as he opened his eyes, but Cas was smiling encouragingly at him.
Everything looked a little bit different too.  Everything looked sort of transparent like it wasn’t really real anymore.  The motel room had all become a muted dark red, and felt slightly out of focus.  Even the floor beneath their feet didn’t feel like it was entirely there – Dean suspected that he could move right through it if he really wanted to (which he didn’t).  Sam – who was frozen in time and completely unaware that he was currently in a different dimension – didn’t quite look completely solid either, but had a bright yellow-orange color to the energy that was lazily swirling around him.  Both Dean and Cas had a much faster swirling energy around them, which was more of a yellow-green color.  Cas seemed to be patiently waiting while Dean took it all in before flying to their destination.  Dean looked at Cas and saw the same eyes staring into his very soul as always.
Taking careful aim, Dean took a deep breath and tossed a rock at one of the giants, hitting it square in the eye.
Dean tried not to panic as he turned to face the monster who had tortured him in Hell for 30 long years.  He couldn’t see the demon’s true face, but he recognized the energy he could feel from the twisted black soul possessing the meatsuit.
Dean threw a book at Sam.
"You!" a couple voices all cried together as they starred at the Trickster, who just smirked back at them.
“You want me,” Cas interpreted unnecessarily.  Dean chuckled.  His wings had no concept of subtlety, did they?
"Woah wait – kill you?" Dean asked in alarm.  Even though he'd really just met Cas, he realized that he'd be devastated if anything happened to him.  Perhaps it was the strange bond or whatever, but Dean already felt like Cas was part of him in a way he didn't understand yet.  Dean would never forgive himself if Cas was killed just because Dean had clung too tight and somehow bonded to the angel.
Shit.  Shit.  SHIT!  Alastair showing up was NOT part of the plan!
"Sammy's role in the apocalypse has been pretty much kept to a need to know basis.  Lilith would probably still hunt him for her own reasons if she thought she could kill him," Gabriel explained.
going to be ready.
"No can do.  If you knuckleheads want to do this right, Dean has to be the one to kill Lilith," Gabriel countered.
“So, with angel perspectives on time, this would mean what?  A few years ago?  A few decades ago?” Sam asked.  Leave it Sam to still be a nerd even at times like this.
Fortunately, Sam didn’t push the issue, but just said that he’d see if Garth was available to come down with him.  Dean hoped it was Garth and not some other hunter who showed up with Sam.  Out of all the hunters the Winchesters were currently in contact with, Garth seemed to be the person most likely to be tolerant of Dean’s new wings.  Too many other hunters out there would probably be quick to add Dean to their kill list, now that he was something partially supernatural.
"Hey can I talk to you for a second?" Dean asked Cas.
"Okay, well, too bad, Dean, because I think he wants you to strap on your party hat," Sam told him.
“Congrats to you both in finally getting together.  I’m real happy for you,” Garth told them warmly.  “And Dean – now that you’ve got wings you’ve got to take me flying sometime.”  Dean gaped at Garth.  He didn’t know what to respond to first – Garth seemed completely casual and nonchalant about him getting together with Cas and sprouting wings.  Either one of them would raise alarm bells from any normal hunter, and yet Garth was grinning broadly like his friends sprouted wings and dated across species all the time.  It made Dean’s head spin.
Dean found a small shovel in Cas’ backpack and realized that it was something that he could use.  There were some rocks littering the floor of their small prison, and hopefully most of them had never been touched by angels.  While the demon’s back was turned, Dean started using the shovel to scoop up rocks and chuck them at the warding.  A few of them bounced back off of the invisible wall between him and the warding, but others sailed through towards their target.  However the rocks were a bitch to aim, especially with the kind of force necessary to crack the warding.  There was a limited supply of rocks too, and Dean was worried about what else he could do if he ran out of rocks.  Surely the demon was hearing all of this, but the demon was choosing to ignore him because he’d finally figured out which blade he wanted to try out on Sam first.
"Why do you want Dean dead?" Cas demanded.
"But people won't see them, will they?" Dean asked.
"Is this guy for real?" Henriksen snapped.
“But would my feathers really work for spells?” Dean asked skeptically.  He was starting to feel more and more caught in between – too angel to be human, and too human to do most angel things.  But Sam just shrugged, not having answers any more than Dean did.
“Yeah – I’ve got that effect,” Dean teased with a smirk.  He liked driving Cas wild, so who’s complaining?
Dean tried to close his eyes to it all, but discovered the hard way that he could still see even with his eyes closed.  He could still see the dark red insubstantial scenery they were moving past.  He could still see Sam’s time-frozen form being pulled along with them (which looked creepy as hell).  Dean instead tried to focus on Cas.  As they moved faster, the energy around Cas shifted color.  In flight, Cas looked bright blue (which kind of suited him).  Watching Cas fly was fascinating.  All of Cas’ movements were both graceful and powerful.
“Er, I don’t require sustenance…,” Cas tried to remind them, looking a little apprehensive about getting caught in between the brothers and dragged into their prank war.
“Sounds symbolic of Dean – Ratatoskr transverses all of Yggdrasil, having connections between Heaven, Earth, and Hell – branches, trunk, and roots,” Sam commented.
And of course two giants sleeping not far from the top of the beanstalk on either side of the yellow brick road leading up to the castle.  So much for any minuscule hope Dean had for not having to face the giants.  He wasn't very confident that they could sneak past the giants without either of them waking up.  Dean had thought that the huge Blue Ox that had attacked him yesterday had been big, but now he had to seriously reconsider his definition of big.  The Blue Ox was proportionally the size of a cat compared to these giants, maybe even a kitten.  That made humans no more than bite-sized morsels compared to these monsters.
“Dean Winchester.  I'm Castiel's superior, Zachariah,” smug-face announced, confirming Dean’s fears.
“Seriously?” Sam complained, as much of a prude as ever.
Feathers.  Dean had real feathers on his wings.  The silver sheaths that had been covering the feathers while they had been growing hadn’t completely broken away yet, but Dean suspected that Cas had been helping them along.  The new feathers underneath were uncurling but still needed some grooming to zip the veins and get the tiny barbicels to hook together to create a solid, smooth surface.  Dean’s feathers were mostly the same color as his hair, with shimmery green tips.  Well, that is, all of his feathers but one.  In the same spot as Cas had one stray feather that had Dean’s coloring, Dean also had one rogue feather that matched Cas – black with a blue tip.  Dean still wasn’t sure how he felt about those rebel feathers, but he chose not to focus on it now.
“Think of it as a utility belt – with large pockets on both sides,” Sam replied.  “Besides, I MacGyvered part of it from a real utility belt.  Come on Dean – you need someplace to store your gear.  I already packed it up with extra flashlights, water, rope, snacks,….”
"Um, Cas and I discovered a bit of a side effect to my resurrection," Dean began.  "There was some sort of unexpected energy transfer between us, and the bottom line is that I've got some weird angel crap going on."
<Make coffee> Cas gently guided Dean's hands to make the correct signs.  He repeated the motion a few times until Dean could do it himself with confidence.
“Ah yes, well you lot won’t be ready to go after them until you’ve healed up and done a lot more research.  Seriously – if you go in all half-cocked like last time then you’ll be doing it alone.  Meanwhile, I see no harm in me taking some long overdue personal time to find some French girls off of whom I can lick off Nutella,” Balthazar replied, supplying some mental images that Dean would have been happier to have never seen.
“Poor Baby really missed me,” Dean cooed while petting the steering wheel.  Dean really appreciated how Cas not only didn’t roll his eyes at him like Sam would have done, but actually smiled like he was pleased to see Dean so happy.  Sure, Dean had to adjust to having the bench further back to make room for his wings, but it was still worth it to be out on the open road again.
But somehow Dean sensed that Sam wasn't there. There were no humans for miles. How the hell did he know that? Dean didn't have time to worry about that when he had a much more immediate problem to deal with. If there was nobody around, then Dean was all on his own to somehow dig himself out of his own coffin.
“I don’t want to fly,” Dean stubbornly insisted, refusing to acknowledge the part of him that actually did.
“A little gratitude wouldn’t kill you,” Dean snapped back.
“You think that you’ve got the monopoly on mysterious resurrections?  I don’t know, but believe me, nobody is happier that I’m alive again than I am,” Balthazar retorted.  “And now that I’m both alive
"Still, there must be something that she'd want bad enough to risk coming out of hiding for.  I'm a professor of creative writing, and I always tell my students that if you set the stage right, you can make any character do anything.  So what does Lilith want most of all?" Juanita asked.
Going back to having only one head and four limbs was a lot weirder than it should have been.  This was how Dean had lived his whole life, so why did it now feel like he was missing vital parts of himself?  He could still feel the energy inside himself that was used to manifest his angel parts, but it wasn't the same when he kept them repressed like this, and he itched to let them out again.  But Dean had the equivalent of a college degree in ‘How to Repress Anything & Everything’ so this was nothing he couldn't handle.
After all – when you stick Dean and Cas in a dark room together, and give Sam instructions to leave them alone for a few hours for “training” – what else did you think would happen?
"You think the guns in the trunk will work?" Sam asked as they ran.  Dean was struggling to keep up with his overfilled belly and food-coma sleepiness weighing him down.  The ox was scraping its hooves on the ground, acting like it was about to charge them like a bull.  Did oxen do that?  Oh why had all the close parking spots been full when they arrived?  The Impala was all the way on the other side of the clearing.
Dean felt Cas’ hand on him, and a pulling sensation.  The pain didn’t go away, but suddenly his body didn’t feel so heavy anymore.  The world slowly started re-emerging from the darkness of near unconsciousness.
“Dean – relax – I won’t let anything happen to you,” Cas promised.  Dean tried to focus on just Cas’ eyes, and that helped some.
“Well, there wasn’t enough left behind to piece together the details about what they knew.  But here’s the thing – what we saw in the cave was the aftermath of demon-on-demon violence.  So now some new group of demons is either hunting for the information, or just acquired it,” Sam replied.
“Hey Dean!” Garth greeted enthusiastically.  Dean had forgotten that Garth was a hugger, and barely suppressed a yelp when Garth threw his arms around Dean.  Fortunately, Garth’s arms avoided his backpack and the precious cargo it contained.
"Okay I get why the so-called angel can see it without the spell, but how can Dean see it?" Henriksen demanded.  But before Dean could come up with some sort of smart-alec response, he heard the sound of wing beats and Cas was gone.
Even just breaking open the roof of the pine box was enough to have dirt cascading down on top of him. Dean struggled to make the hole big enough to climb through before the coffin completely filled with dirt and cut off the last of his air. Still, he couldn't get a breath in that didn't accidentally include some dirt. Rather than hacking up a lung trying to get the dirt out again after every breath, Dean tried to hold his breath as he made a mad dash for the surface. It'd really suck to finally come back to the world of the living only to die again before he even got out of his coffin.
“That shouldn’t have made your wings itch, Dean.  You’re just trying to bait me into straightening out your feathers later,” Cas replied with a raised eyebrow and a slight smirk.  Well, that’d certainly be a bonus, and Dean smirked too at the thought.
“Er, I guess Balthazar must have encountered some demons during the years he was on Earth,” Sam tried to break the awkward silence.  It seemed to help snap Cas back to himself.
Sam and Eileen had become focused on their own conversation, and were no longer paying any attention to Dean and Cas.  Dean expressed his exasperated amusement by catching Cas’ eye and doing an exaggerated eye roll.  Cas gulped, and decided try to figure out Dean’s intentions.
“Dude – I bought you pie!  Let’s call a truce in the prank war,” Sam replied.
“Come on now!  Ratatoskr?  You know, the squirrel who runs up and down Yggdrasil, the world tree?” Gabriel replied.
“What about the other demons?” Sam jumped in before Balthazar could disappear.  “You said there was an entire demon organization studying angels.”
“Yeah okay, but this isn’t a damn petting zoo, so…,” Dean began, feeling the need to keep this moment from getting too touchy-feely (literally).
Time had no meaning anymore in Hell. It was just another day with another victim on the rack in front of Dean. He had long since stopped caring about who they were. So long as they were the ones hurting, he would be distracted from his own pain, which would otherwise consume him. It was better if he didn't let himself think or feel.
Fortunately, the abandoned hunting cabin and pile of kindling that Dean ‘accidentally’ stumbled across was exactly where it was supposed to be.  The pile of kindling was even old enough to have acquired a thick layer of moss on top – perfect for a quick fire starter.  Dean was quite relieved that he hadn’t gotten direction turned in the dark.  With a flick of his lighter, Dean set the pile of kindling on fire.
Both brothers were too stunned to move for a second. Then Sam moved with lightning fast reflexes to grab his gun. Dean winced at the realization that Sam didn't believe that this was really him.
"But Michael is one of the few angels who ever knew God.  Could he be right?  Could this atrocity really be what God has commanded?" Cas sounded completely dismayed and broken at the thought, but that didn't stop Dean from feeling angry that he could even think that.
"Alright, alright – I'll tell them," Dean groaned.
"Dean," Cas reminded him.
"Seriously Dean?  We've still got a long way to drive...," Sam protested.
“Stop beating yourself up, Dean,” Sam insisted.  “We’ve split up on hunts before, and you’ve trusted me to be able to handle things.”
Dean didn't know the first thing about flying.  Hell, he'd always been terrified of flying.  It was pretty twisted irony that Dean would end up with wings, but right now, despite his terror at the situation, he was very grateful for his wings.  He weighed his options.  He could either keep gliding until he eventually reached the ground (which thankfully their decent had slowed down enough that it would take a long time for them to get to the ground), or he could try to get them back to the beanstalk.  As nervous as Dean was about messing with what his wings were doing, the idea of starting the climb up the beanstalk from the very bottom again was not very appealing.  Besides, the longer they delayed, the worse the chances for finding Juanita alive were.

“Relax Dean – we’ve been gathering intel while you slept.  We’ve got some maps of the cave system, and get this – a significant portion of the cave has been removed from modern maps.  There are a few vague drawings of that part of the cave from a hundred years ago, but most of it was unexplored – and someone wants it to stay that way,” Sam explained.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
<Really?  You worked that hard just for me?> Eileen signed, making Sam blush.
"How did he...?" Shayna asked.
"I'm an angel of the Lord," Cas told Henriksen before Dean could stop him.
“Awesome – now this is more like it.  They might still be a bit small, but they are finally starting to look like warrior wings,” Dean commented.  No more baby chick wings, and he wouldn’t look like a porcupine again until the next molt.
"Yeah you were right.  Once I spent some time hanging out with them, getting used to them, and accepting that they're a part of me now... plus, you know, nothing makes you connect to your soul like plummeting to certain doom," Dean replied with a weak attempt at a nervous laugh.  He still never wanted to fly again if he could help it.  That part wasn't changing, but he was willing to let his soul have the other things it wanted, at least around Cas and maybe sometimes Sammy too.
“Yes Dean,” Cas confirmed.  “But in order to do so, you need to let your feathers grow in correctly.  Rubbing against chairs can damage them.”  Dean then felt the familiar warmth of Cas’ Grace healing him.  But usually the feeling only lasted a second, even with injuries like broken bones.  Only this time, the feeling was lingering.  Dean also felt his wings go unnaturally still, as if guided by instinct to make it easier for Cas to heal him.
"I convinced her to stop telling everyone else about the giants.  The local authorities were convinced that Shayna lost it when her girlfriend split town.  But Shayna is not crazy and she is no liar.  I managed to convince one of my contacts to follow up with the trail of her fiancé's stolen credit card, even though the charges haven’t been the least bit suspicious or out of the ordinary.  I'll admit that if I didn't know Shayna so well personally, and if you two hadn't opened my eyes to what's really out there, I probably wouldn't have followed up on the magic she talked about.  But as crazy as it sounds, her instructions led right to the beanstalk...," Henriksen explained.
“I’m fine Sam – didn’t hurt at all,” Dean truthfully reassured him.  The spot where the feathers had come out actually felt a little bit better, or at least less itchy.
That was, of course, when the demon decided to make an appearance.
"As in, I had wings!" Dean blurted out, not understanding why Cas wasn't acting like this was a problem.
Dean motioned for the others to be quiet and get low, and ignored Sam's frantic arm waving informing him that Sam thought Dean was going to do something stupid.  Very carefully, and trying not to make a sound, Dean snuck down to a bush halfway between the two giants.  The snoring was quite loud, but neither giant woke up before Dean was safely hidden in the bushes.  He had reluctantly put away his wings to make himself less visible, especially since the damn things had a tendency to move on their own.  The last thing he needed was for his wings to rustle the bushes and give away his position.
Dean dragged himself out of unconsciousness slowly.  He could sense Cas and Balthazar nearby, but beyond that he couldn’t sense anything because they were surrounded by angel warding.  With a start he realized that he couldn’t sense Sam, and that terrifying thought was enough of a jolt to restore full alertness.  Dean opened his eyes and scanned the room.  The cavern that they were in was dimly lit, but Dean could make out Sam on the other side of the cavern, shackled to a chair.  Sam had regained consciousness too, and was squirming in an attempt to get out of the chains.  Dean looked for demons, but they appeared to be alone for now.  Some thick-looking doors had even been built into the cavern, closing them off from the rest of the cave.  They were completely blocked off from even the wind that had been ever present since they first ventured underground.  There were a few wards painted on the walls, some that Dean recognized and some that he had never seen before.
“Er, Dean – it’s sunset, not sunrise – you slept all day,” Sam told him.
“But being human has always been so important to you,” Cas insisted reluctantly.
"You seem more at ease with manifesting your wings," Cas commented once they had found a quiet spot away from the group.  Dean relaxed and easily let his wings out again in a casual stretch.  It felt good to have them out again in a place where there was no judgment.  Sure, none of the others had done more than crack a few jokes about his wings, but nobody quite looked at him the same anymore now that they knew he was part supernatural.  Even the Tr-Gabriel seemed to have a new odd glint in his eyes when he looked at Dean that didn't use to be there.  But Cas accepted Dean completely in a way nobody else ever had.  Whatever weird stuff Dean could do now wouldn't even faze Cas.
Eventually, the top of the beanstalk started coming into sight instead of just being a vague haze in the distance.  Or, at least Dean hoped that the layer of clouds ahead of them was the top of the beanstalk.  He could see Shayna and Sam shivering from the strong winds.  But other than tightening his grip every time a gust of wind came, Dean didn't really feel that cold despite having mostly just brought the Georgia summer clothes on his back.
“I’ve packed all of our gear,” Sam continued, gesturing to two backpacks and…
"Holy shit!" Dean exclaimed, cranking his head back as far as it would go as he gazed upward.  He was amazed at the sight of the massive beanstalk in front of him, but his stomach was already dropping at the prospect of having to climb that thing.
“Er,” Sam interjected, coughing uncomfortably.  “If the demons had one of Balthazar’s feathers – is it possible that they have Balthazar too?”  Dean cursed and a new look of horror covered Cas’ face.
But this was Dean Winchester.
Somebody – anybody – help me. Dean knew that there was nobody coming for him, but that hadn't stopped him from dreaming of being saved. But it was just a dream. Maybe it was time to face reality. He had put up a valiant fight, but in the end this was a battle that he just couldn't win.
Dean should’ve known that Sam would pounce on him the first time his brother got him on his own.
"Because God commanded it. We have work for you," Cas told him, staring deep into Dean's eyes and rendering him speechless for a moment. Sam and Bobby didn't have any snappy comebacks to that one either.
Of course things couldn’t be that simple.  Dean’s wings chose now of all times to erupt in dozens of little tiny porcupine-like needles.  His new feathers were finally starting to emerge.  Dean probably would have freaked out over his new array of silver spikes if he hadn’t been forewarned that this was how his feathers would first emerge.  Sam had insisted on showing Dean dozens of photos of pet birds fledging so Dean would know what to expect.  All of the new feathers grew in while encased in a protective silver coating that would later break away.  While the needles poking through his skin didn’t hurt, Dean discovered the hard way that they caught easily on everything.
Logically, Dean knew that he’d only had his wings for two weeks.  But in that time they’d become so much a part of him that he couldn’t imagine himself without them.  They were just as much a part of him as the parts he’d been born with.  Actually the thought of losing them felt worse than the idea of losing another limb like an arm or a leg.  He didn’t feel like he’d be himself anymore without his wings.  On one hand, it was another shocking revelation that he’d changed how he saw himself so much in such a short period of time.  On the other hand, it was a relief to realize it.  This was who he was now, and he wouldn’t go back even if he could.  Knowing that made all the difference.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
But instead of talking, Cas suddenly left the trail and started tromping through the bush.  Cas had a strange way of moving through tall plants like they weren’t even there.  Dean, on the other hand, struggled to keep up.
"So you DO remember Hell!" Sam rounded on Dean, surely eager to try to get Dean to talk about his feelings, which was the last thing Dean wanted to do.
The smell of sulfur grew stronger and stronger the closer they got to the hot springs.  There were lots of pools of water in this part of the cave.  Sam started shivering a little, saying that the water that kept dripping on him was making him colder in the already cold and windy cave.  Dean didn’t really notice the cold, so he insisted that Sam take his jacket.  Even with one less layer on Dean still didn’t feel the least bit cold.  Huh.  Something to add to the growing list of angel questions for when they got back.
☆ ★ ☆
“It’s alright Sam – those were already loose,” Cas explained.  “Dean is going through a partial molt to make room for the new feathers.  He lost some feathers while rubbing on the chair as well.”
“No,” Dean conceded, knowing that currently Cas’ greatest handicap to being a hunter was his understanding of humans – something he was working really hard to improve.  Dean opened his mouth again to comment on how Cas’ passion for helping people combined with his countless years of combat experience and supernatural expertise gave Cas the makings of a great hunter, but Dean stopped himself because he knew that Sam would just turn all of those statements back around on him.  Little brothers could be annoying like that – especially ones who would have made great lawyers.  However, despite Dean not saying any of that, Sam must have seen it on his face because Sam grinned slyly like he’d just won the fight.  Sneaky bastard.  But Dean wasn’t done yet.
"Sammy behind you!" Dean shouted in warning as one of the vampires was about to stab Sam in the back.
"I don't know, Sam," Dean honestly told him. As far as he'd ever known, angels didn't exist. Not a single hunter had ever come across one. But Cas had claimed to be one of the good guys, and he had done nothing but help so far. More than that, Cas had just saved Sam's life! What kind of monster would resurrect Dean, only to reunite him with his brother and then just leave? What else could even have the juice to do all of this? Dean was in way over his head on this one.
"Or you could just use my key," said a familiar voice behind them.
“Well, that too,” Dean admitted, “but my wings really do itch, and I can’t seem to get it to stop.  Sam – did you put itching powder in my wings?”
"SAMMY!" Dean screamed.  Without thinking, Dean leaped after his little brother.
Dean had no idea how he was going to survive this one.  He tried to block out the sheer terror that threatened to overwhelm him.  The only thought on his mind was that he had to get to Sammy.  He streamlined his body into a perfect nosedive, and within seconds that felt like an eternity, he somehow managed to catch up to Sam and grab him tight.
As Dean started leading Cas towards his bedroom, Cas saw Sam sign one last word to Eileen.
“Need any help with that?” Dean asked, eager to feel useful.
“Right,” Dean replied, trying to get his head back into the mission.  “So how early do the caves open?  Can we get there before there are too many people?”  The brief silence that followed was not reassuring.
There was only a short distance to go.  He could do this.  He’d survived 40 years in Hell.  Once he broke the ward the pain would stop.  Just a little bit further…
"Right.  I'll just cut to the point then.  One of my cousins says her fiancé was kidnapped by giants," Henriksen announced.
"My orders are to capture her alive. My superiors likely want to interrogate her before killing her," Cas replied curtly as if the idea of disobeying these orders was unthinkable. Sam looked like he still wanted to protest, but Dean cut him off.
“Dean, I’m not going to keep doing laundry every two days just because you won’t cut holes in any more of your shirts,” Sam argued.
Dean tried offering a bite of his burger to his coyote head.  The coyote's point of view was suddenly primary in Dean's mind, and he grinned slyly at the thought of stealing just the meat paddy in the middle of the bun.  Only the realization that his other heads would then get stuck eating the rest of the meatless burger stopped him from following through with that desire.  Still, the coyote head really enjoyed a bite of burger.  Next Dean tried offering a bite to his squirrel head, but the smell of the meat alone made his squirrel side gag.
<Most humans cannot listen to my True Voice.>
Dean didn’t sense the wards until they were practically right in front of him.  There was a single large sigil painted on the cave wall.  It looked like it was the same kind of invisible-to-humans paint that they’d seen back in Kansas.  Sam set down his backpack and got out one of the cans of spray paint he’d brought, and they directed him towards the sigil.
“The entrance to that part was blocked off by a rock slide – I’ll have to fly us in,” Cas added.
Then Cas started doing something new with the energy surrounding Dean’s wings.  Dean felt the energy swirling and pulsing in a way that felt so amazing that he temporarily forgot to reciprocate.  Dean tried to mimic whatever finger movements that Cas was making to play with the energy like that, but he couldn’t figure it out.  However, Cas definitely seemed to enjoy whatever Dean was doing to his wings, if the moans were any indication, so Dean kept doing it.
The job of trying to sense the warding and/or demons largely fell to Cas.  Whenever Cas tried to reach out with his angel senses, he spread his wings wide and angled them towards the area he was trying to sense, as if it made it easier to catch the vibrations.  No wonder Cas had caught on when Dean had been trying to do the same earlier – the gesture was hard to miss.  Dean liked to watch Cas do his angel sensing – any excuse to check out Cas’ wings, really.  He half expected to see the cave’s constant howling wind rustling Cas’ feathers, but of course the wind passed right through Cas’ wings just like everything else on the physical plane.  Too bad.  Dean liked the thought of watching Cas’ feathers fluttering in the wind, and the expression on Cas’ face the sensation would cause.  Any chance there was wind on the seraphic plane?  He’d have to ask Cas later.
Unfortunately, Cas had chosen a can of cherry pie filling, which produced a bright pink milkshake.  He hadn't expected Dean to sign the letter “P” in the wrong location (by his nose instead of by his chin), changing the meaning from “pink milkshake” to…
“Stand down?  Dean was nearly killed!” Sam argued, glaring at Gabriel like he was still holding a grudge against him for all the other times he’d killed Dean.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
“Try to kill Lilith before the angels catch wind of your change in plans, since as the human of the group you can’t manifest any weapons that could kill an angel,” Gabriel replied.  Gabriel’s eyes briefly flicked over to Dean for a moment, reaffirming his implications.  Gabriel knew that Dean was part angel now, and he thought that he could manifest a blade like the one that Cas had manifested a few times.
"So what – just because you are big and powerful, doesn't mean that I'm gonna buy that you're an angel. What's next? You gonna claim God is real too?" Dean yelled, even though he had a feeling that the gigantic being in front of him could hear him just fine even if he only whispered.
“I am touching you Dean – just not the physical part of your wing,” Cas responded patiently (although he sounded slightly smug).
“Awesome – then while you’re out you can buy us a few packs of condoms, a whole case of Astroglide and . . . ,” Dean pretended to casually suggest, but of course Sam caught on.
<Good morning Cas> Dean signed, giving Cas a warm smile.
"Then I won't ever leave Dean's side!  I'll fight them off!  I'll fight them all off!" Cas declared with a fire in his voice that suggested he just might smite anyone who even looked at Dean the wrong way.
Cas was worried about Dean.  Both Sam and Dean had been taking an ASL class so that they could surprise Eileen when she came to visit.  Since Cas knew all human languages, he was helping to tutor them outside of class.  Sam, as expected, was “being a nerd” with how enthusiastic he was about learning sign language, and he was picking up the language very quickly.  Dean, on the other hand, had a tendency to mix up certain signs in ways that could lead to . . . . rather inappropriate mistakes in front of Eileen.
"I can't be certain that whatever creature caused this has left the area.  We should leave and remain alert for the next time it tries to attack," Cas replied, scanning the trees warily.
"What about your wings?" Cas asked. Dean blinked.
"Don't sweat it," Sam told him friendly.
Dean almost didn’t even notice when their feet left the ground.  Take-off was so completely effortless and smooth that Dean didn’t even really feel it.  Sure, Dean could see and feel Cas’ wings flapping to propel them, but it felt more like the ground had just dropped away.  The human part of Dean started panicking like crazy.  But the angel part of Dean was completely relaxed and comfortable with this, and wanted badly to start flapping his own wings alongside Cas.  The paradox of it was actually kind of creepy.  On one hand he was facing one of his greatest phobias, and on the other it felt like he was coming home.  God, his life was crazy sometimes.  It made his head spin to have two parts of himself at complete opposite ends of the spectrum like that.
"Nobody here but me. I'll be down in a minute," Dean replied, not quite looking them in the eyes. He could still feel their suspicious eyes boring holes into him for another few seconds before they went back to the kitchen.
“Well, Cas also brings lots of angel strengths to the table.  That’s more for us than the few weaknesses he has,” Dean argued.
"Same here, but apparently he has been freelancing a little with really weird cases that get reported to the FBI, but aren't taken up by the FBI," Sam explained.
“Don’t worry about it Cas,” Dean told him.  “Lead the way – we can find a nice spot for lunch down by the river.”  If Cas saw right through Dean’s not-so-subtle way to keep Cas’ eyes off his wings, he was too polite to say anything.  But first things first – that sad look on Cas’ face had to go.  Dean trailed a teasing line of kisses down the line of Cas’ jaw like he was heading for Cas’ mouth, but at the last second he kissed the tip of his nose instead.  Dean wiggled his eyebrows at Cas to imply a continuation of those ministrations after the hike, and ruffled Cas’ hair to make it look even more like sex-hair than usual.  Cas gave him a look that clearly asked ‘is that really how you plan to end all of our disagreements?’ which was accompanied by a small smile that suggested that he could get on board with that.
"Sam – I'm okay now. I'm alive again. So this isn't about vengeance. The angels will give Lilith justice," Dean reminded Sam.
“Dean, it would take a few hundred rocks with precise tosses to break all of those wards, and that is optimistically assuming that there aren’t more wards painted inside,” Cas told him.  Sometimes, Dean really hated it when Cas was right.  Dean couldn’t do this job without the help of someone who was more human than him.  Feeling his wings drooping subconsciously with his mood, Dean reluctantly dug out his cell phone.
“Just don’t invite me along on your little nature picnic,” Sam retorted.
☆ ★ ☆
Would Bobby take one look at him and reach for the shotgun? Would they still believe that Dean was really Dean, or would they think he was just some new creature that tricked them? Dean couldn't bear the thought of how devastated Sam would be if he thought Dean had never come back from Hell after all.
"Yes, I suppose the sight of these creatures would leave most humans quaking with awe," Cas replied.  Dean rolled his eyes, and went to strap on a few choice weapons.  He wasn't going to go up there without any weapons, but he didn't want to weigh himself down too much for the long climb either.  They'd just have to make plans up as they went along like they always did.  He very pointedly tried not to think about just how high he was going to have to climb in just a few minutes.  If this wasn’t a task he needed to be sober for, he definitely would have taken a few shots of whiskey to calm his nerves.
“Don’t try to fly yourself – keep your wings tucked in and let me guide you,” Cas warned him, as if Dean actually had any desire whatsoever to fly.  That’s when it really hit Dean that this kind of travel would no longer be instantaneous for him.  Crap.  Dean expected the usual two fingers to the forehead, but Cas surprised him by gently taking his hand instead.
<I did use my facial expression to emphasis just how horny I am> Dean signed back.
<Did I do wrong? I thought that you would want to see each other, since I heard you were close.>
"You've seen my True Form," Cas replied, confused by Dean's question.
"Dean – this is good news. This isn't just another round of demon crap. You were saved by one of the good guys! Now I know you're not all choirboy about this stuff, but this is becoming less and less about faith and more and more about proof," Sam chimed in.
"No problem, Sammy.  Just work on your kung-fu grip on these vines next time, bitch," Dean replied, and gave Sam a light punch on the shoulder.
"When you learn more control, you will be able to use your other eyes without manifesting your other heads," Cas told him.
Cas’ eyes were distracted by the way that Dean was nervously licking his lips.  The temptation was very strong to pull Dean even closer and do what Dean had initially inadvertently suggested that they do.  Cas was very hungry for the taste of Dean's lips.
"Dean!" Cas sounded more shocked than scolding, but Dean wasn't going to let anyone try to lecture him about 'not taking the Lord's name in vain' or any other kind of crap.
“Save it, Cas.  Just because we are imprisoned together does not mean I have to talk to you,” Balthazar retorted cruelly.  Cas looked completely crestfallen.  If Cas didn’t care so much about Balthazar, Dean would have roasted his wings in holy oil by now.
☆ ★ ☆ SUPERNATURAL ☆ ★ ☆
Somewhere in Minnesota, Dean suddenly hit the brakes.  He backed the car up, and his eyes practically popped out of his head at what he was seeing:
Dean’s senses did start overcompensating for his lack of vision – just not the ones that Cas had been hoping for.  His ears honed in on the tiny sounds that told him exactly where Cas was – like the tiniest crinkle of fabric as Cas moved.  It wasn’t that Dean was really trying to use his ears for this – but years’ worth of hunter’s training was too much to ignore.
"No – what was that?" Sam asked. Dean hesitated for a moment before answering.
"Get out of here. There is no such thing," Dean snapped back before his brain could remind his mouth that mouthing off against something this powerful was a very stupid thing to do.
<It's more fun to make out together> Dean pouted, looking like Cas had just told him that he'd eaten the last burger.
"You know this asshat?" Dean asked incredulously.
“Good job Dean,” Cas told him with a smug smile.  Dean’s jaw dropped when he realized what Cas was referring to – somehow Dean had been able to sense Cas’ hand well enough to use his wing to smack it.
☆ ★ ☆
His eyes particularly kept getting drawn to the birds flying about.  He’d never paid that much attention to birds before, but now that he had wings too he found them much more interesting.  He watched how gracefully they soared through the sky, some of them seeming to glide with so little effort, others flapping up a storm to even go short distances.  Dean’s own wings started twitching with kinship and a strange sort of yearning… Dean quickly shook his head and diverted his eyes back towards the ground, the place where humans belonged.  If he was going to be getting any strange feelings of kinship with birds, he wanted it to be something like an ostrich or a penguin – birds that were sensible enough to keep both feet firmly on the ground.
“Cas?  Hey!  You okay?” Dean asked frantically.
“How many fingers, Dean?” Cas asked.  Dean sighed as he tried to consciously sense where Cas’ hand was, including those wonderful fingers that he wanted so badly to be in his feathers and not just hovering above them.  His hunter instincts were screaming at him to use his other senses to fill in the gaps in his knowledge.  Before he even realized what he was doing, his eyes had sought out a reflection on a glass door of a cabinet.  But Cas must have caught on to him somehow, because the next second all of the lights went out.
“Don’t worry Dean,” Cas assured.  “The back is low enough that it won’t get in the way even as your wings grow.  And this green will bring out your eyes.”  Dean didn’t even need to see Sam’s face to know that Sam’s expression was halfway in between a gloating smirk and an attempt to hold in ravenous laughter.  A chuckle escaped Sam despite his best efforts.
“You’re still here…,” Sam whispered sheepishly.
Dean wondered just how far he could sense.  He tried focusing on the farthest reaches of his mental map of the area and pushing just a little bit further.  It worked – he could see farther by trying to mentally extend his senses.  It even worked around corners in situations that would be physically impossible.  But it wasn’t perfect – the further he pushed his senses, the more blurry the picture got.
"Dunno... h-hope... s-so...," Dean replied, suddenly falling to his knees as he felt his consciousness start to fade away.  Large meal or not, there was no way that he shouldn't be wide awake with adrenaline right now.  Something was wrong with him.  Of course that was when the giant blue ox decided to charge right at them.  Dean tried to fight to stay conscious, but he couldn't get back to his feet.  They were going to get trampled!
"What the hell?" Sam asked when he surveyed the room with his shotgun raised, clearly expecting a monster, and only finding Dean in the weirdest position he'd ever been in. Dean blinked back up at them, trying to think of one of his usual quick witted retorts, but his brain seemed to be short circuiting right now. He was at a complete loss at how to explain this.
“I feel the shafts forming under the skin,” Sam said, his voice filled with geeky wonder.
"Aren't some animals not supposed to be able to see in full color?" Dean wondered aloud.  It was still a bit weird to hear his three voices echoing, but he was getting used to it.
“So get this,” Sam announced as they ate.  “The writing on the walls of that cave was some kind of code, and I found an old manuscript that shows how to break it.  The code was commonly used by medieval demon orders in Prague….”
They were interrupted when Dean’s pants started vibrating (but not in the way Cas wished they would since he sadly didn’t have that effect on the hunter).  Dean groaned, and removed one hand away from where Cas was still holding them.  Dean’s phone had one new text message.
“The angels aren’t attacking Dean directly.  Zachariah, a pompous dickwad in middle management, decided to outsource the assassination so that none of his foot soldiers would ever be the wiser that he’s trying to start the apocalypse instead of stop it.  But unfortunately for him, he made the mistake of unknowingly approaching my peeps – the tricksters.  Once word got around to me what he was trying to do, I told them all to stand down,” Gabriel explained.
“I was wrong.  It is one of my greatest…,” Cas began again.
“Concentrate Dean – feel me touching the layer of energy surrounding your wings,” Cas instructed.  Dean sighed – how the hell was he supposed to concentrate when he could be touching Cas right now?  But Dean tried anyway.  He tried hard for at least 30 seconds, but it felt like a lot longer.
“I’m fine,” Cas insisted unconvincingly.  “It was just an information spell.  I’m not surprised you felt it too.”
“Okay let’s do this,” Dean said once there was nothing else to put off flying with Cas any longer.  He braced himself.
<We are fluent in all human languages> Cas signed back.
Turning beat red, Cas made a few quick signs to tell Dean that he was going to get started on the cleaning.  He was probably imagining the look of disappointment on Dean's face.  That was probably just wishful thinking.  Cas turned and stiffly walked away, trying to ignore how tight his vessel’s pants had become.
“Not necessarily.  Dean’s wings will probably still continue to grow.  If you are familiar with the terms humans use to describe birds, this would most likely be the angelic equivalent of one of Dean’s ‘subadult’ plumages, rather than the ‘definitive’ plumage he will grow after his wings are full sized.  This just means that once these feathers grow in, Dean’s wings will be mature enough for him to learn a fuller range of wing skills,” Cas replied.
"Well, that creeps me out. I mean, I don't like getting singled out at birthday parties, much less by... God," Dean admitted.
"Sleeping, or trying to anyways," Dean replied with a sigh.
"First, allow yourself to have your wings out. Your soul wants to manifest your wings – let it," Cas instructed. Dean felt like making some smart-alec comment about how would Cas know what his soul wants, but he bit his tongue.
“Look – we’ve all died a few times.  At some point you’ve got to just bury the past and move on with your life.  Gabriel killed me a few dozen times, but I got over it when he eventually came through for us in the end,” Dean began, frowning at Sam’s wince.  Sam never admitted to just how many Tuesdays Gabriel put him through, but from the way Sam was avoiding Dean’s eyes now it was like Sam had under-exaggerated the number . . . . but Dean couldn’t worry about that now.  Cas needed him.  “Anyway, my point is that you and Balthazar go way back.  If he’s alive again then maybe you can come back from this.”
Maybe having an ally in the FBI could be handy after all.  Dean made a mental note to set something up later where hunters could send Henriksen names of hard-to-find suspected meatsuits.  He remembered the time when Henriksen confessed his frustration of spending years chasing after just one monster to save a few people.  If they played their cards right, Henriksen could end up saving many more lives than his current job was letting him do, just like he wanted.  Not that Dean was going to let any of these civilians become full hunters if he had anything to say about it, but maybe just a technical liaison would scratch Henriksen’s itch without letting him get too deep.
"Do your bee eyes see everything like a kaleidoscope?" Dean asked.
So Dean and Cas decided to save their pie for later and continued on the trail.  Perhaps to distract Dean, Cas started enthusiastically playing nature guide.  Cas talked like he’d memorized an entire encyclopedia about Kansas wildlife, flora and fauna.  While Dean couldn’t quite get into flowers the way Cas could, he enjoyed all of the passion his angel showed for nature.
"Coward," Sam muttered.  Gabriel glared at him with hurt in his eyes, but didn't get a chance to snap back an angry retort before a pissed off Cas got in Gabriel's face.
"So do I need to feed these heads too?" Dean asked as they sat down to eat.
"I know that you, like all the other angels, have been buying the party line that you've been spoon fed since The Beginning, but it's time to wake up and smell the rotting eggs.  Because believe me – more and more angels have been turning sour since Dad went away, and like any rotten rebellious teenagers do when unsupervised, they are taking their feelings out by egging their Father's beloved creation.  Only in this scenario, the eggs are angelic nukes that will destroy every living thing on Earth.  So unless you want that to happen, it's time to break away from the flock," Gabriel explained.
“Get out?  Do you think I would still be here if angels could get out of this place?” Balthazar interrupted.
Dean felt something warm and wet trickling down his neck.  At first he wondered if it was blood, but it didn’t quite trickle right for blood (Dean had enough experience to know).  With a start, Dean realized that the wetness was Cas’ tears.  Cas was crying.  Dean cursed himself for making Cas cry.  He instinctively wanted to do something to comfort his angel, but he was barely conscious and every movement was painful.
<Nice to meet you Cas.  You are the first angel that I’ve met.  Do all of them sign as well as you do?> Eileen signed, looking him over and acting impressed.
There was only one thing on top of the bookcase – a very ornate golden jewelry box.  Shayna sprinted over to the jewelry box as soon as she reached the top of the bookcase, with the others following behind.
The pulsing of energy beneath Cas’ skin was definitely much more apparent from this position.  Way too apparent actually.  How was Dean supposed to concentrate on angel blade lessons with Cas’ body pressed up against him like this?  Part of Dean’s traitorous mind kept drifting to a very different kind of ‘angel blade’ that he’d rather be focused on getting to know.
"Dean is still very new to his wings, and this pocket dimension is somehow blocking my powers.  I'll make a path for us to climb," Cas replied.  Cas drew his angel blade and started making cuts into the bookcase that they could use for handholds and footholds.  The dude moved surprisingly fast too, and never seemed to tire.  This marathon of a journey was wearing a lot more on the rest of them, but they pushed on and followed Cas up to the top of the bookcase.
On the bright side, at least Sam hadn’t gotten them some dorky little picnic basket.  But on the other hand, Dean wasn’t convinced that what Sam did buy was all that much better.
Pie, pie, and PIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Dean!  Dean!” Cas kept moaning.  Dean decided it was time to move the party to their mouths.  He kissed his way up Cas’ neck and over to his lips, then proceeded to lick Cas’ mouth open.  Cas reacted by practically devouring his mouth.  Yep, Dean definitely knew how to work up his angel.  Now Dean was moaning just as much as Cas.
Time passed slowly here.  It didn’t help that the only indicators of time was the progress Cas was making in healing Dean.  By the time that the pain level had dropped from excruciating to the level where Winchesters would take an aspirin (and civilians would go to a doctor), Dean could feel his wings start to try twitching again.  But Cas’ arms were keeping Dean’s wings very tightly pinned in place, so his wings struggled in vain.
"But they just showed up by themselves this morning!" Dean protested.
Cas replied with a smile and a pleased hum.  Then Cas started taking his shirt off in a way that was surprisingly coy for an angel who’d never strip teased before.  Dean’s heart sped up faster at the sight of Cas’ bare chest, and in anticipation of what was coming next.  He lunged for his dresser’s top drawer for some condoms and the brand new bottle of Astroglide...
"Can you not tell Sam and Bobby about the wings?" Dean asked.
“You guys should get a room!” Eileen called over.  Somehow her words seemed to reach Dean’s where Sam’s hadn’t.  Dean paused the kissing to look over at Sam and Eileen with a little fear creeping onto his face.  But it was clear from the smiles on their faces that neither of them were really annoyed by the “public display of affection” to which they had just been subjected.
"So, you've got some extra faces too?" Dean asked Cas once they were alone together.
"Woah there," Gabriel interjected.  "I may have some appreciation for this crazy planet, and absolutely no desire to let my big brothers start fighting again, but I never said that I'd die for the cause.  I'm just here to facilitate things behind the scenes."
“Caves are cold Dean – you’ll need layers and a jacket,” Sam insisted.  The fact that Sam was annoyingly right didn’t stop Dean from mumbling under his breath as he finished getting ready.
"That is very probable, yes," Cas replied.  Dean sighed.
Meanwhile Sam was bouncing like a puppy as he shepherded Dean and Cas outside so they could greet Eileen when she arrived.  They didn’t have to wait long before Eileen showed up.
“Fine Dean.  If you hate your new wings so much, does that mean you want me to go back to researching a way to get rid of them?” Sam huffed angrily.
“Rhetorical question, Cas,” Dean grumbled.  Cas still hadn’t gotten the hang of knowing when humans tended to say placating things based on hope that everything would be alright.
"Angelic Grace has wing buds through which our wings can be manifested. When I raised you from Perdition, your soul clung to me tighter than anticipated. I suspect it came from how close you were to breaking, and your desperation to be saved. As a result our energies bonded and influenced each other on a quantum level," Cas explained. Dean's head spun as he tried to wrap his head around this.
