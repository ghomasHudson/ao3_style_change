Steve returns the next night as well, and many nights after that. It had been almost a week at this point, and the two boys slipped into a comfortable, yet still a bit awkward, routine. They’d talk about school, books, movies, pretty much anything that they thought of. Tony found himself looking forward to seeing Steve every night.
They climb in the car and he hasn’t even buckled before Pepper gets the biggest grin on her face and asks him, “So, how was your date.”
Tony loves Starwars. It’s only his favorite movie of all time and they happen to show it frequently at the movies. He looks down and scuffs his toe nervously as he says,
He thinks for a moment, before replying, “Well, I hate to leave my mom, so I’ve applied to some colleges in California, but also various places across the country. My top choice is NYU, so we’ll see how that goes. I am planning on majoring in classics because I love literature. Maybe art or film studies though, because I love both of those things too.”
He works for another hour before the bell rings and he sees a bunch of girls he recognizes from school come in. Luckily, none of them have noticed him in his yellow apron, so he ducks into the back offices where his aunt is.
The next day, Steve is too perky for Tony. Which isn’t saying much, considering Tony is so physically and mentally exhausted that even a small smile is too perky for him.
He sighs and starts to go to his room before his father speaks, “I have a dinner meeting. You should make yourself something to eat.” Before Tony can respond, Howard disappears into his office.
“Oh yeah, you’re toast.” The other two boys laugh and get in the car, leaving Tony standing in the parking lot about to throw up with unease.
Tony tenses ever so slightly but manages to carry on the conversation normally. “My dad works in the movie industry and my mom is a lawyer.”
He heads over to the counter and doesn’t have to wait long before his first customer of the day comes in.
He groans. “Definitely not. I would pick anatomy over PE any day. I have English sixth period. You?”
He begins to ramble nervously, “You don’t want to meet my parents. I know you want to, and I know I should, but I can’t. What we have is amazing and I don’t want it to be touched. I hope you understand.”
He grins at all the people he passes, choosing to repress his mild panic caused by having to face the day. He, hopefully not outwardly, winces when he sees Clint hanging out by his locker waiting for him. Has he mentioned he does not feel good enough to keep up his façade?
“Yeah. He said he didn’t want to put me in the position of having to choose, so even though he loves me, he wants me to have a future.”
“If you care so much, drive yourself!” He counters, with no real snark, pulling out of his driveway and out of the neighborhood.
He flops onto his bed, sighing. The ceiling stars from when he was a kid glow faintly around the edges as he begins to do his homework, focusing on his AP calculus, rather than his angry father below him .
“This is my son, Anthony. I brought him so he could train to take over the company right out of college. Isn’t that right, son?”
“Yeah, that sounds amazing.” He tells her, surprised. He was not expecting an actual sit-down meal, even if that would be typical.
“Are you fighting with your dad again?” She pries, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder, but he shakes it off.
Tony walks into the kitchen and leaves Steve near the stairs that head up to his room. He sees his mom sitting at the counter filling out some paperwork, and his dad is nowhere in sight. He lets out a breath of relief and walks over to her.
“Why would I when you live next door? I’m trying to be better for the environment.” She tries to convince him, though he knows that isn’t true.
“I insist.” He tells her, heading towards where she is standing by the sink. “What would you like me to do?”
Tony knows he is stuck. His father is fully aware that Tony will go to college no matter what, so he is forced to follow his ultimatum. It isn’t as if Tony can afford college on his own, much less MIT. So, it all boils down to his relationship or his future. How fucked up is that? He stands there, staring Howard in the eyes, trying not to cry, when he finally breaks.
Tony thought nothing of it, not until Steve wandered back out a bit later wearing only soft sleep pants and a flush that was definitely from something more than a steamy shower. Tony hid his grin.
Right now though, Tony is just enjoying the feeling of being used as he listens to the sounds Steve makes as he fucks Tony’s ass, his groans changing to the timbre that lets Tony know his lover is getting close. Sure enough, a few more thrusts and Steve shoves against him, his cock pulsing and throbbing inside as he comes. Tony can feel it, the way Steve’s cock twitches, the heavy fullness as he pushes as deep as he can go, the fat base of him plugging Tony up with what he has promised is just the first of several more offerings.
Tony made a strangled sound when Steve felt the harness of Tony's cock rub against his abs. He couldn't resist dipping down to mouth at it, taking it into his mouth to suck gently while Tony shuddered and tugged at his hair.
Not always, not every time, but enough that Tony was filled with a buzz of anticipation as soon as the invitation were made.
Somehow, that bolstered Steve, set him with determination to show Tony how much Steve was going to make sure his alpha had no regrets, no reason to fear. Tony's trust gave him the confidence to kiss those shaking fingers, to pull his partner towards their bed.
Tony shakes almost violently, sobbing as he scrambles to shut off the toy. When he succeeds, he collapsed forward like his strings had been cut.
He wasn't sure how long they had been at this, the pair of super soldiers had come at least twice each already, but Tony was denied. He would be until they were finished with him or he reached the end of his endurance. It wasn't anything new. In fact, it was a favorite of the two when they asked Tony for some time with just the two of them.
“So gorgeous, damn,” Steve rumbled. “Look at this pretty little hole, sucking up my fingers like that. Like you just can’t wait for my cock. I'm always sure it'll never fit, and I'm always amazed when it does. I love how you get all soft, so soft...stretch out so good for me. I love to watch it gobble up my dick...such a greedy little hole.”
He rubs and teases, pressing in one slick fingertip and then the other, alternating and nudging just a little deeper each time he switches. Tony is making encouraging noises, one hand digging into the sheets, and the other gripping right above Steve's knee.
“Steve, please!” Tony eventually whines, grabbing at him with uncoordinated movements, desperation edging in his voice. “I want you to fuck me- yes, yes- Please! I'm ready, I-I'm so ready. I need it, need you...please!"
He pulls Bucky and Steve each in for a long kiss, the faint taste of fruit and chocolate shared between them.
Bucky is staring at him, so close, so close. Looking at him, like he's never seen him before, like he's the thing he's been searching for his entire life.
Steve stands as well, hands out in placation, “I’m sorry, sweetheart, it was an accident! I just didn’t know how to tell you. I just wanted to talk to you about it-”
He doesn’t know what Steve sees in his face, but Steve sucks in a sharp inhale and slides his hand over Tony’s tingling ass with reverence. His voice wavers with emotion as he says, “You would let me?”
And the only thing to do is kiss him, this wonderful man, this alpha who gives things even when he is afraid, even when others have hurt him. He gives it to Steve because Steve asks for it, and - he hopes - because Tony knows Steve will give it back to him in return. Steve kisses Tony until he’s breathless, panting and moaning and squirming against him.
It's a little muffled even for his enhanced hearing, but the sounds of Tony’s short little moans are unmistakable even through the walls of the penthouse. The tone of them though…
“No,” Steve cuts in, derailing the train of thought his partner is going down. He sighs and drops his head, regrouping. When looks back up Tony is staring at him, completely bewildered. “I meant I saw you later, when I came home. The event ended early.”
“You are so adorable,” Steve chuckles out as he scoots close enough that Tony is spread on both of the super soldiers laps. Tony wrinkled his nose and blows a raspberry instead of giving that a dignified answer.
So he was armed with research, an aching want to please his partner, and a truckload of desire that threatened to swallow him whole. And nerves. Even for their first time Steve didn’t remember this wild oscillation between heady lust and faint terror.
It's driving him insane, but he can’t seem to find the right time to bring it up, can’t figure out how to even start.
“Tony, sweetheart, I’ve got you,” Steve rambles, stretching his fingers wide again just to watch the way Tony spreads around them.  “I’ll take care of you, I'll always take care of you.” It's hard to tear himself away, to slip his fingers from Tony’s welcoming heat, but his own need is roaring in the back of his skull at the reality of these past weeks' fantasy brought to life before his eyes.
“Shh, it’s okay. It’s okay, baby. Here, look at me,” Tony crooned, tangling their fingers together before he mirrored Steve’s earlier action and kissed his fingers.
The rhythm is faster now, more insistent, and Tony can only sob and shiver as sensation builds past the point he thought was able. Every drag against his rim sends fire racing to his cock, and every thrust is aimed right where he needs it, right where he wants it.
The enormity of it felt like it would swallow him for a moment, and all the nerves he had forgotten rushed back.
Tony feels scorching around Steve’s finger when he finally pushes all the way in, the tightening of muscle giving way but still clenching down around him. Almost in sympathy, Steve feels an answering clench of his own, knowing how good being touched like this can be.
But someone - or more likely several someones - had made Tony think this thing he wanted was wrong or disgusting. And as much as Steve wishes that had never happened, right now he just needs to assure Tony that he thinks no such thing.
. Oh god, oh yes. Tony is so full. Fuller than he's ever been, fuller than he would have thought possible.
He can’t resist pulling Tony into his lap in the water once they are all clean, rutting against his ass and massaging and squeezing his knot, teasing at his sensitive nipples until Tony comes again, Steve following shortly after. After another quick rinse to clean off the cleaning off, Steve carries Tony to bed.
Tony has always been willing and open to trying whatever Steve wants in the bedroom, and he's certainly introduced Steve to some things he would never have thought about. Usually Tony is pretty straightforward when talking about sex, and though it had taken some getting used to, Steve appreciates the candor, since he is less experienced.
And Tony doesn't mind being silly, not at all. Silly isn't bad, can't be, not with the way he's lighting up with being called the best thing ever.
He's draped over the wedge once more, a sheet pulled over it to guard him from the worst of the wet spots. He can feel soft kisses press down his spine as Steve whispers how good he is, how perfect, as his lips drift lower and lower.
And Steve knows. He wants this forever. Sure, they have technically only been together for a few months, but really, it's been so much longer. They have loved each other for years before this, standing together has always made each of them stronger.
Tony only manages a few garble consonants that make no sense, completely gobsmacked at the turn the evening is taken. Gobsmacked, but totally on board. Steve should drink more.
Steve is certain this is not a show meant for him, no matter what has happened when walking in on each other masturbating before. He can't seem to convince his body to move away though.
Tony blinks up at them, but words are still far off, so he smiles and nods moving to sit up. It seems his arms are still far off, too, because they flail a bit, but do nothing to propel him forward.
Tony tries to turn around, to look back at where Steve is sliding in and out, lighting up pleasure where they are connected, but they both know Tony won’t be able to come like this, not for a very long time. A slight flicker of trepidation is gathering in Tony’s mind, but before he can get a good look at Steve, one of those hot, huge palms presses down between his shoulders, pinning him in place as Steve picks up the pace and leans to growl hot and possessive in his ear, “Think I don't know you were trying to rile me up? Make me jealous? Well, mission accomplished. Now, I'm gonna...what was it?
He quickly, but quietly, leaves the penthouse, heading to the gym to get some space and work off the anxious energy pouring in his veins.
"You're beautiful, come on baby, this time, I wanna feel you squeeze me when I fill you up. Wanna watch you make a mess everywhere, yeah? Let me fuck the come outta you, just like I said? You gonna give it up to me? Huh sweetheart?"
They leave and wander back down towards the school where their cars are parked. It is a nice night because of the fact that it’s the end of September, so they are a comfortable in just their jeans and t-shirts.
They wander out and take a seat by Pepper’s pool. It is still loud outside, but without the speakers only a couple feet away and the massive amounts of people, it’s significantly better. He looks at Steve, who is wearing his signature jean jacket with a white t-shirt and jeans.
“Thanks, dude.” Clint starts to head over to his car further over in the parking lot. “A few of us are gonna hang out. You coming?”
“It’s fine, I don’t-” Steve cuts in, but is interrupted by Clint putting a hand on his shoulder and steering him towards the table of all of their other friends.
“Is your mom home?” She asks and Tony has to restrain himself from rolling his eyes. He does not want to be back on the topic of his parents again.
“Done!” He calls out, before emerging in a maroon velvet suit jacket with black pants. His hair is gelled to the side and he looks really nice.
“Of course not.” He isn’t surprised. His mother always tends to side with her husband, no matter how unreasonable he’s being. He looks at Howard again. “So, you’ll drop this whole Stark Industries thing?”
The car ride is silent, not that Tony is surprised. Howard is driving their new Cadillac, mostly used to impress potential clients, while Tony stares out the window at the passing buildings. His dad had told him nothing about the purpose of this dinner. He doesn’t know who he is meeting or why, but he’s hoping it’s nothing too bad. He can honestly think of nothing worse than a business dinner, though.
He fumbled the lube, hand shaking so bad suddenly that he felt like his body had forgotten how to communicate with his extremities. His his heart was beating like a hammer in his chest.
dirty. He's so turned on it's a bit concerning, like he might blow just from Steve's very thorough fingerfucking and strangely praise filled dirty talk.Tony's hands grasp at the sheets and he feels a pillow in his grip. He drags it back to press his face into while he tries to grind his cock against the wedge beneath him.
“So you weren't thinking about letting him nail this ass?” Steve continues, enunciating his question with a hard grind against Tony. “This gorgeous, perfect ass?
“Yeah?” Steve purrs, pushing forward steadily, watching Tony tremble when the head of his cock pops in. Nothing could have prepared him for this, and he feels a growl rumble through him, watching in fascination as he sinks further and further into Tony’s ass, his entrance softer from all the work Steve had done and almost sucking him in. It’s nothing like being with an omega, tighter and hotter, and somehow so much more fulfilling with the scent of his alpha in his nose and on his tongue.
So this is another piece in this Dom/Sub AU. It's not in any particular order or anything, and this time just happens to be Stuckony. Because I felt like writing Stuckony porn...so...you're welcome.
Steve laughs in his ear, low and dark, nipping at his earlobe for just a second before he leans back, hands sliding into the crooks of Tony’s hips so he can tug him wherever he wants.
Steve, in turn, is staring at his hand as if he’s never seen it before, eyes wide and jaw agape. As Tony watches, Steve looks back and forth from his hand to the place where Tony is sure there's an imprint of it right on the plump flesh of his cheek.
He works his finger slowly, in and out, slippery and making tiny sounds he doubts Tony can even hear. But he can, and they get louder when he works Tony's hole a little faster, a little firmer, looking up to watch Tony’s face with rapt attention until he gasps and pleads, “Please, I want another. I’m ready.”
“But you - I wasn't -” he stutters. His fork clatters to the table, bouncing and splattering dressing. Tony stands abruptly and his chair screeches discordantly before he gasps out, “That was private Steve! You weren’t supposed to see that!”
And Tony felt hot, not from the pleasure of the cock and fingers still in his ass, but from pleasure somewhere even deeper, even more intimate, at Steve's words and Bucky’s murmured agreement, pressed right against his throat. Because Tony wanted to give, he loved to give, and he was so glad his Doms weren't disappointed, weren't unhappy with him. Even though he was the lucky one, having so many, being loved by so many. Did that make him greedy?
sorry. Oh fuck, I know you don’t like that, that’s why I didn't want you to see. We don't have to talk about it! It’s fine! I don’t need it or anything, or-or at least, I don't expect it from you. You have to know that Steve, I would never ask you for something you didn't want, something that makes you uncomfortable. Please, I’ll make sure you never see me like that again, just don't leave me, please.”
Steve stands there, shocked, listening to the unfamiliar little high pitched whines as his brain rearranges itself and several new conclusions snap into place.
Time stretches and warps around him as Steve lowers him to the bed. He feels Steve leave the clench of his body, but there's very little discomfort.
"What's wrong, sweetheart?" Steve asks, curious. There's no way Tony is suddenly worried about his own size in comparison.
Tony makes a low rumble and Steve looks up the glorious, ruined mess of him, noting the come streaking the arc reactor and the knot that still hasn’t gone down. He’s a mess himself, slick on his own thighs and Tony’s come striping him from navel to chin.
“Beautiful,” Bucky whispered in his ear, “I'm the luckiest son of a bitch alive, getting to hear you and touch you like this. C'mon doll, beg a bit more, tell us what ya need.”
Tony won't bend for anyone else, he won't break, won't waver or give in. Fury knows it's because Tony Stark has seen violence, has experienced it meted out unjustly more than anyone should have to endure. And he knows that all of Tony's Dominants have meted it out, sometimes justly, and sometimes not.
“You have shown me this three times since you bought it last week.” He rolls his eyes, but nevertheless tells her, “You look incredible.”
“Hey, just because I don’t have this job doesn’t mean I won’t see you. We still have school and I’m not planning to stop our dates anytime soon.”
“Hello, Steve. It’s nice to meet you.” She looks at Tony and Steve a bit skeptically, before letting out a small sigh. She turns to Tony and says, “He seems nice enough. Go on.”
That night, he is surprised to find himself feeling a strange sense of nostalgia. As excited as he is to not have to be here every night, he is going to miss having his late-night talks with Steve and free food, though he supposes he can do that anyway.
Tony hangs out by the school after, waiting for his friends. Pepper left with her cheerleading friends already, but he chooses to wait for Clint.
“I work the night shift… I need to make a little money. I got caught smoking weed and my dad cut me off. I don’t exactly want any of my friends to know that though.”
“Are you excited?” His leg jitters from nerves, but he doesn’t think Steve can see it and he definitely won’t be telling him.
Tony can’t help but feel hurt by that, even though he wasn’t the one Clint made a rude comment about, but he decides to let it go and follow Clint to their usual table. Everyone else immediately starts roping him into the conversation and he finds himself cracking jokes and forgetting about the conversation from only moments ago.
. Tony can feel it, the pull of Steve's mouth, can picture it taking from his body what Steve had put there.
It's not violence, not even when Clint takes his turn, being sure to light up the welts on Tony's back by pounding him with rough thrusts as he prepares to fill him up even more as Natasha cries out her pleasure from Tony's clever mouth and Clint’s fingers on her peaked nipples.
And Tony is engulfed in him, surrounded and shielded as Steve huffs soft words right in his ear. "I told you to take it, to take me, but you really just can't stop giving can you? You're so sweet to me. Sweet for me."
“I know,” Steve huffs. “But what I was really trying to say was, I would like to try topping with you. Actually, I would
Behind him, Steve is going to town, completely chasing his own orgasm without any regard to Tony, and Tony feels himself going to a place he never expected to go again. And it’s not like he has missed it, this soft, fuzzy space where he can let go and just be, because Steve and Tony’s sex life is great, it is in fact excellent. It’s just that until now, Tony had no idea Steve would be interested in this kind of play at all.
He's becoming aware this is something much deeper than he had first thought. Sometimes, he stumbles across old wounds of Tony's, hurting him unwittingly, and his suspicion this is one of those times is confirmed by Tony's next words, which he delivers into Steve’s chest.
So, Tony's suspicion was confirmed; Steve was definitely a bit drunk. He chuckled. "Well I'm glad you boys had a good time."
Steve and Bucky have requested some time alone with Tony. And they have a plan. It involves both of them taking Tony, at the same time. Tony is all for this.
Steve watches as Tony tenses, his back bowing off the bed, hears him give a vicious alpha rumble as he finally comes, hot spurts shooting high enough to hit Steve’s chin, knot forming fully without even so much as a hand to squeeze it, and Steve pounds into him, chasing his own pleasure even as Tony howls his name and he comes and comes and comes.
"You're my Alpha, and I'm your Omega," he leans back down touching their foreheads together before finishing with a growl, "and right now, I really want you to fuck my brains out."
Tony was smiling up at him, but Steve could feel the fine tremor where his fingers gripped Steve’s own.
Steve can't stop watching the way Tony's ass opens up around his fingers, how he can feel the pulse of him here, in this delicate, secret place. And sure, there's nothing wrong with an alpha wanting this, but it still feels electric in his skin. Like some guarded thing has been offered up just to him.
With barely a pause, Steve starts right back up, and Tony can feel his own pleasure building, slowly, like the waves lapping up to the beach. He wonders how many times it will take before he will feel Steve’s come dripping out of him. The thought goes sticky and stretchy in his mind, like taffy being pulled on one of those weird machines. It rolls over and over on itself,
"Yeah,” Steve says, tone worshipful even if it’s a tiny bit condescending. “That's it sweetheart, take that cock, you wanted it didn't you? Don't worry, I'm gonna give you what you want. 'M gonna fuck the come right outta you...Eventually."
Steve is a master strategist, skilled in planning and implementation of said plans. So he plots, and he plans, and he maps out exactly what he wants to do. He thinks of every contingency, goes over and over each scenario in his mind.
When he goes down to the lab to bring Tony a snack and finds him deeply focused on soldering, his pink tongue licking at his bottom lip, Steve sees his mouth open in an expression of ecstasy, the shine of his lips lit up with blue light.
His attempt to calm doesn't work, and he feels how rigid the man in his arms goes before he pleads, "Steve, it's fine. Like you said, I'm the Alpha, and you're the Omega."
Innocuous things burn like afterimages into Steve's mind, leading his thoughts right back to the revelation of his completely misunderstanding Tony asking if he wanted to top.
“Mmm. I just want you,” Steve said as he pulled off of Tony's cock, lapping at the head as he did. He reached for the supplies on the nightstand, finding what he needed before turning his attention back to his lover.
Tony moans as the toy moves deep and slow into him. The alpha rolls his hips in a smooth counterpoint rhythm, heady little gasps escaping every time the slick phallus disappears inside, the base of the toy bottoming out, followed by Tony rocking forward on his braced hands, arms flexing, before he rolls his hips back to meet the next thrust.
Tony feels proud, a soft, bubbling thing. He's feeling good and floaty, happy and a little bit punchdrunk. He hears a distinct, “I’m gonna fuck the shit outta this ass.”
As if reminding him of its existence, his cock twitches, heat rolling down his spine and into his groin. Just the sight of Tony's little dusky pink hole is enough to have him burning with want all over again.
The two superhumans move like they do in all things when they are on the same page: in perfect synch, like they know where the other is without effort, without fail. And Tony is part of that sometimes, becoming even more enmeshed in them as time goes by, but in this? Well.
The back of his hand was pressed to his mouth, head canted slightly to the side, eyes shining and half lidded. His legs were splayed wide around Steve's hips, showing off the long lines of his body. Steve took a moment just to look at him, letting his gaze wander from the soft waves that he loved to run his fingers through, down over Tony’s face, where he looked back, uncharacteristically shy. His gaze wandered over his chest, where scars surrounded the marvel that protected Tony’s heart, past the gentle ripple of abs, to follow the trail of dark hair past his belly button, where his cock sat plump and full, surrounded by neatly trimmed curls.
It's quite funny for some reason and Tony starts to giggle. Steve and Bucky don't mind, they never do, and Bucky absolutely beams at him before he gently scoops him into his lap as Steve brings over a tray absolutely packed with food.
He pins Tony to the bed as he rides him one night, refusing to go any faster even though Tony shivers and shakes and pleads underneath him, and he thinks of how he really,
Even in the low light, Steve could see the color climbing into Tony’s face. It made something in him preen, and suddenly he wanted Tony naked and under him. He wanted to see him arch and pant like he had only witnessed that night in secret. It was only the work of a few seconds to untie the sash and push the slippery robe to the floor. Tony moaned when Steve lifted him effortlessly, placing him on the bed and stepping back. He quickly slipped out of his own clothes, tossing them aside carelessly before climbing on the bed and nestling between Tony's legs, bracing himself on his arms over Tony before nipping and licking his way into his mouth.
Tony rolls his eyes, but there's a gentle smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. He has no problem letting Steve carry him into the bathroom and run them a nice hot bath.
“Fine, but I can’t walk after that glorious pounding you just gave me. I think my legs have the stability of jello right now.”
During Steve's workout, Bruce, Tony, and Clint come into the gym and take up positions in front of the mirrors for yoga. They go through several poses, and Tony is beautiful and steady through them all, his muscles flexing with the power he uses to fly his suit, the grace he shows in the air flowing through him from one pose to the next.
They drop their car off with the valet and head into the elegant restaurant. Tony is immediately overwhelmed by the luxury displayed. With the pricey menu items and the overdressed patrons, Tony is not confused as to why his father picks this place for meetings.
Once Clint is gone, Tony takes that as his cue to head over to Steve. “Man, I love casually listening to slow dance songs.” Tony says sarcastically.
About thirty minutes later, they are all situated on stage and the ceremony can begin. The principal talks for a few minutes, as Tony waits for his turn to talk. His leg jitters in anticipation and he keeps exchanging glances with Pepper, who is a few seats away from him. Finally, he is called up.
“No, Tony. For once, let me pay. You’ve been doing this for me every day since you learned to drive. I have money too, so please, let me help.”
As bad as Tony thought his Sunday was, it is nothing compared to Monday when he has to see Steve again. He walks into the cafeteria with Pepper and immediately scans the crowds for his ex-boyfriend. When he sees him, he is at his usual table, but with his sketchbook open and turned directly away from the table where they are headed. His position would be too much of a coincidence if it wasn’t intentional, as he is in the spot that would make it least likely that he would have to see him.
“Okay.” He rubs his arm nervously and stares into his milkshake as he begins to talk. “We’ve been friends since ninth grade. We originally became friends because he was well known and popular and I thought it would make my dad happy. It did, because pretty soon everyone at this school knew who I was. Well, they found out I was a Stark. It got me into the good graces with people at school and I got lots of benefits. Clint was thrilled because I paid for things and got him more attention. We always have fun though. We go to parties and sneak into amusement parks and he is really funny, so we actually are really good friends. Pepper only focuses on the ‘he uses me for money’ part though, and not the actual ‘we hang out all the time’ aspect.”
He looks around at everyone, some people he’s known since elementary and middle school, and decides, “Yeah.”
“Give it time, maybe I’ll change my mind spending more time around the company.” He tells him, making it vague enough that he isn’t locked into anything but also appeasing his dad.
Tony immediately starts loading up a plate. “They have frosted cookies, so I’m not even sorry. Have you tried these? They’re the best thing ever.”
“No more extra money. You want someone to fund your drug habits, go somewhere else, but don’t associate it with me.”
At the end, he gets lots of compliments on his speech and congratulations for graduating. It is exhilarating.
“Besides, what would I have to do there other than talk to you?” That hurts him as much as a smack to the face.
“It’s Aunt Peggy’s restaurant so I get high pay and I’m able to pick my own hours. It’s a delightful place to work, thank you very much.”
“He got into Pittsburgh on a football scholarship. He’s hoping to play for the Steelers, so we’ll see how that goes.”
“Yeah.” Tony notices how his smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “At least I’ll have a better sleep schedule.”
He runs downstairs in a record four minutes. His backpack sits on the chair in the kitchen next to a piece of toast. His mother stands next to it nursing a cup of coffee, already dressed for work. Maria Stark is one of the best defense attorneys in the state of California. Because of this, she works long hours, so Tony is shocked that she is even here right now.
The next day, he feels even worse than before, if that was even possible. He hasn’t even started his job yet, so he didn’t know how he was going to manage with that stacked on top.
“There is no need to be sorry. This is what I am here for. You can talk to me about anything.” Steve tells him with a small smile, before walking over to him and wrapping him into a hug.
That Friday, Tony is nervous. He knows Pepper and Steve will like each other, but still. He can tell Steve is nervous by the way he fidgets with the cuff of his jean jacket as they wait for Pepper by the bleachers. When they see her jog towards them, Steve pales considerably.
“Me neither.” Steve puts a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder and begins to rub his back. Tony leans into the touch. “I’m so sorry.”
“I told the owner I’d close up tonight. She’s going to a wedding early tomorrow morning, so I didn’t want her to be too tired.”
The door to the en suite opened and pulled him from his spiraling thoughts. The lights in the bedroom dimmed and for a moment the lights in the bathroom stayed on behind Tony, bathing him in an ethereal glow. Steve’s breath hung in his throat as he stood, walking over to take his alpha’s hand.
“Tony, you feel so good," he moans. "I wanna eat you out next time. Can I do that? Get you all wet that way? Maybe stuff you full of my slick and lick it out, too?” He pushes forward, all the way, until his hips press into the fullness of Tony’s ass. He just stays there, enraptured at how amazing this feels, how right.
In the glow of the arc reactor, Steve holds Tony close, breathing in the scent of him and Tony together. Tony gazes at him, eyes soft and full of love.
It’s not violence when Rhodey fingers Tony open, making sure it burns just right to have Tony whimpering with delicious want. Not when he denies him, just to hear him try to beg around his mouthful of Bruce's cock as Rhodey lubes up soft thighs and slides between them, careful to only tease when his cock slides over the sensitive area of Tony's perineum until Rhodey comes.
The sounds are nothing short of obscene, and Tony prickles and burns with that odd shame, but lights with livewires of tender pleasure at the same time.
Tony was propped up on the bed, his favorite foam wedge pillow behind his back, playing around with one of his newer ideas on his tablet when Steve came strolling in the bedroom and went straight for the shower.
Much later, satisfied and happy, Steve kisses Tony goodnight and wraps him in his arms, enjoying how well the alpha's smaller frame fits to his, and it never occurs to him that he entirely missed the point.
"Yeah Tony, you're so beautiful, letting me fuck you, letting me fill you up. Can you take one more, huh? Just one more, and then I'll let you come, ok? One more...just- fuck! Oh, fuck!"
him. And suddenly, there is a tiny grain of doubt about Tony letting Steve do this to him while Steve isn't fully sober. Those doubts, no matter how tiny, are erased when Steve finally looks up to meet Tony’s eyes, the shock and worry written so clearly there Tony knows immediately that only one word would stop this whole wild night.
But now? Holy fuck, he was definitely going to be asking for this again. And maybe a lot more if Steve was amenable.
He comes again, sometime later, sobbing and shivering, with Steve's fingers and tongue shoved in his sore hole, playing him like a virtuoso.
“Nuh uh, Tony,” Steve said. His voice gentle but filled with command as he abandoned his shared grip on Tony's hip to slide him back, forcing him to follow as Bucky leaned back as well, taking Tony's weight so damn easy, like he was insubstantial fluff, and that always did something to a part of Tony's brain.
Steve grips the headboard on either side of where Tony's head rests against it, leaning back to stare down at the alpha's face. Tony stares back, mouth slightly open, pleasure written across his features, but there is something else there, too. His dark eyes have an odd look to them and it's enough to catch Steve's attention.
He was pressed so firmly between them, sandwiched and surrounded. His blood was pounding in his ears in a bass
"Thank you," he says out of nowhere. He's as serious as Steve has ever seen him. "Thank you for not treating me like there's something wrong with me."
Not many can understand the Avenger’s bond, how so many Dominants can share one Submissive, how they all are intrinsically connected and yet their hub, their center and their humanity is tied irrevocably to one Tony Stark. He's their sun, the Submissive made just for them and they for him, all of them finding each other through extraordinary circumstances to circle in his orbit.
"Nothing," Tony answers quickly. "It's just...Do you ever think about-", Tony stops abruptly, flushing while he founders for a moment. "Would you want to try me on bottom?" he blurts out after a second.
"Yep," Tony answered, matter of fact, not noticing the danger in the air.  Oblivious, he teased Steve further. "If Sparky hadn't already been taken by Jane and Darcy, who knows what might have happened. The man really seems to know how to handle his…" Tony trailed off, careful to keep his face completely straight before he finished with an innuendo laden "
Blood and death and the smell of ozone and burning permeate all that was left of the base in the middle of nowhere where Tony had been taken.
He works him for what feels like hours, pressing, rubbing, bathing in the scent of aroused alpha. Working his fingers in patterns and then randomly, until sweat shines on Tony's body and his thighs clench and quiver on each side of Steve. Those sounds come more and faster, and inside, Steve's omega basks in the pleasure his alpha is receiving from his attention.
The moan of pleasure Tony lets out at the first sip of his morning coffee echoes in Steve's skull for long minutes, until Bucky nudges him with a questioning look.
Oh fuck, Steve has really fucked this up. Tony is nearly hysterical, and it’s all his fault for lumbering into this like a graceless idiot.
In this syrupy state, Tony can’t stop a giggle, snickering as he says, “An unfortunate word choice.”
And then one position has Tony's ass in the air and his chest on the mat, and Steve remembers how Tony had rolled his hips, welcoming that toy into his body again and again, and he wonders if Tony would present for him like this even though he's an alpha.
He smiles and leans down, kissing Tony softly, and reassuring him with, "That's very generous of you sweetheart, but I have topped before. I've helped out other omegas during heat a few times, both before and after the serum, and while I really enjoyed those times, I'm entirely satisfied with what we do.
But Tony bulldozes over him, and Steve hates the look on his face; panic laced with fear and humiliation.
He laughs when he's pushed back into the now clean bed, his beautiful Doms showering him with kisses and snuggles as they show him how much they agree.
- but it's certainly not unwelcome. Neither is the way Steve grinds his growing erection against Tony's ass before he shifts back and strips off Tony's pants, underwear, and socks in one swoop, following up by removing Tony's tank top with just as much efficiency.
Tony feels the pattern of the thrusts change, and his breath is driven from him as his lover synch again, this time driving inside together.
Instead of thoughts of stopping, now Tony feels his own shock fade, and in its place forms a squirming, heated pleasure, painted on the edge with just a tinge of shame. It's good though, pure somehow. It's a surging, wriggling swell of heat that he feels safe sharing with Steve, showing to Steve, because Steve won't let it dip into that dark pool of humiliation that holds none of the brightness that this strange shame does.
Steve is straddled across Tony's lap. He presses yet another kiss to Tony's mouth, nipping and sucking at his lover's bottom lip and enjoying the way it makes the alpha rumble. He ruts against him, feeling the way Tony's cock slides against his own. Callused hands skate down Steve's massive chest, teasing and rubbing over his peaked nipples before tracing down the hard flex of his abs on their way to wrap around his cock.
, his hands feel huge like this, roaming and touching while Tony lies ass up, draped just where Steve put him.
“That's what I thought,” Steve said, voice low and deep, his hands continuing to explore. “Fuck Tony, you make me crazy.”
It's not violence when Natasha weaves ropes dyed specially to complement Tony's particular warm shade of skin, encasing him in gorgeous tapestries that do credit to her codename’s species. It's not violence when she leaves him helpless, except for the tiny bell clutched in his fingers he can ring at any moment to signal them if he needs to stop.
Steve tilts his head to the side, confused. They have done that quite a lot, so he's not sure why Tony is acting so strangely about it right now.
Instead of saying any of this, Tony just shook the images away, asking, "Wrestled? I'm assuming that's not an euphemism."
A sharp pop of flesh on flesh, followed by the ripple as Tony’s rump jiggles from the impact. The pain follows, minor really, but stinging and prickling as it settles in, spreading a soft heat that reaches much farther than just the abused flesh to which Steve has applied his hand.
Tony thinks he's sweating, watching drops fall down as his head lolls forward on a new, deeper thrust. Until they stop moving, until Tony looks to see why and Steve is staring at him, mouth open.
“Tony, I’m sorry I brought this up this way, I had all these plans for talking to you about what I saw. Apparently I’m not so good with speeches when it comes to stuff like this.”
He drifts through the next time, listening to the sounds of them together, their voices rising and falling, the smacking of flesh on flesh as Steve lets himself chase his own peak.
He pets over it slowly, gently, rubbing and pressing lightly, knowing what he likes for himself, but trying to find out what Tony prefers. Even though he knows their biology is different, and much of the things he read said not to expect most alphas to open up as easily as an omega, Steve is still a little shocked by how firmly he has to push to slip his fingertips inside. When Tony groans and arches into it, it’s gratifying in a way Steve wasn’t prepared to feel.
"Close enough. I got what you meant. You're not the first person I've dated that thought it was gross, but you were definitely the nicest about the whole thing."
Tony can't do anything but grip the arms holding him with all his strength. He's faintly certain he's making a non stop sound that is torn straight from his soul. But Steve isn't faring much better as his face is screwed up into a rictus of shocked pleasure. Behind him, he's not sure what Bucky looks like, as there is no way he can muster the needed strength to move even a centimeter,but his lover sounds nearly inhuman as he rocks Tony with his own body.
And then Steve watches Tony's profile in glorious agony as Tony chokes out Steve's name again and comes while the toy fucks him at a brutal pace.
His pumping hips must draw Steve's attention, because he's manhandled once more when Steve reaches beneath him, grabbing his cock and repositioning it so it drapes down the back side of the wedge, making any stimulation from his grinding much less.
Steve laughs, feeling like he’s just run a hundred miles, but also like he’s a little bit high. “What was that?” he whispers in Tony’s ear.
Then Steve is there, tracing a thumb over Tony's brow as he stares down at him in wonder. “How do you feel? Think you can eat something for us, sweetheart?”
She is dressed up for this, while Tony is most definitely not. He is wearing black jeans, Vans, and a green Henley shirt. Pepper, on the other hand, is wearing heels, jeans, and a tied crop top with her hair loose and wavy around her shoulders.
“You need to stop being late, Anthony. It’s your senior year so you don’t need to be collecting tardies like last year.”
“So, if that’s the case, why did you start talking to me in the first place?” Steve asks, not bitterly, but as if he is genuinely curious.
His father doesn’t say anything, so he takes that as his cue to head upstairs. He lays down on his bed and just lets out a long sigh. He is so tired of this war with his dad. He is tired of not being able to do anything he wants and having to stick to his dad’s life plan for him. He is tired of being up nineteen hours a day to afford things. He wishes he could just fall asleep and wake up in a year or so when everything is easier. But he has to get up and go to work.
He kicks his bed the second he gets to his room in frustration. Not knowing what else to do, he decides to call his friend. Pepper picks up on the second ring.
The boy pulls out a crumpled dollar bill and a hand full of cash from his pocket and then proceeds to dump it on to the counter in front of him. Tony counts it out painstakingly, before making the coffee. After the day full of cappuccinos, lattes, and frappuccinos, he was relieved to have a simple order.
Four days later, he has another deep conversation with Steve. He doesn’t know how or why these keep happening, but he hates feeling so vulnerable. He both misses and despises the times before Steve when almost none of his friends knew his really personality or anything remotely deep about him. Yet here he is, laying on the roof of Steve’s house, looking at the stars and talking about the future, like one of the romance movies his father produces.
He wants to say yes. He wants to jump up and down and scream with excitement, but the small voice inside of him that warns him of his parents wins, like usual. “I don’t know… I don’t want people to get the wrong idea.”
“Well, yeah!” His mind flashes to Clint’s irrational judgement of Steve and his dad’s almost approving look when he talks about Pepper.  “But what will people think?”
Tony is taken aback for a moment. He opens his mouth to respond, but before he can come up with something to say, the doorbell rings and Pepper leaves to go answer it. Tony grabs his drink and follows her down the stairs.
“He gave me an ultimatum: I can either commit to studying film and business to take over his company or I break up with Steve.”
As soon as he gets home, he immediately rushes up to his room. He picks up the phone to call Pepper, but momentarily hesitates. Does he honestly want to admit this to her?
“I thought it was pretty good, I can see why you like it.” He said with a small smile, avoiding his eyes.
“I don’t mean to make you feel bad about being busy, I just wish you could make more time to be at home.”
Hi guys!!! We've only got one more chapter after this to go!!! I'm so excited for you guys to hear this chapter, it's probably my favorite and I had so much fun writing it. I just wanted to warn you that there is more blatant homophobia in this chapter, so if that's a trigger for you, please be careful <3 anyway, enjoy!!
“We have all summer and I’m not going too far from you for college.” She frowns at him but doesn’t force him to raise the hood.
Despite knowing he should keep calm; Tony felt his blood boil. “I already told you, I don’t want to work in the movie industry.”
“Hey!” He called out to him. Steve looks up and sees him, before smiling and giving him a small wave.
He feels someone appear next to him, but he doesn’t look up until they loudly clear their throat. When turns to acknowledge them, he is exasperated to see a familiar face.
At the end of February, he finds himself getting ready for the school dance. While it is a weird time to have a winter dance, he doesn’t mind because of how close it is to his and Steve’s six-month anniversary. Not that he keeps track of something like that, because that would be really sappy.
“We aren’t talking about this right now.” He hates how well she can read him, despite his conscious efforts not to let her know how he’s feeling.
He gets to the movie about thirty minutes early. He can’t help it, he’s excited. He puts his car in the best place and waits for Steve to get there.
He walks over to the prominently displayed cake case and plates the last slice. As he slides it to Steve, the boy says, “So… the diner closes at two?”
On Tuesday, Steve comes in around the same time as usual. The familiar ding of the bell over the door catches Tony’s attention and he looks up to see the blond boy coming in the door.
He just couldn’t wait anymore. “I got in!” He shouts. “My letter came and they’re letting me in! I get to go to MIT! I’ve been waiting for this almost my entire life and I can’t believe it’s finally happening, and I get to be an engineer and go to college and oh my god it’s happening.”
‘’Hello, you must be Tony. It’s so lovely to meet you.” She tells him, ushering him into the kitchen.
“Of course. Try not to miss me too much.” He grins, taking a seat at the barstool across from her.  “I’ll still make sure to stop by regularly though, because you make the best milkshakes, and I need those at least once a week.”
The second they get in the car, he begins to ramble at her. “I don’t have money anymore. A cop caught my smoking with Thor and Clint and now my dad’s mad because I shamed the family and then he said he wouldn’t fund my drug habit, whatever that means, so he told me to get a job even though I feel like that’s even more embarrassing for him but obviously I didn’t say that because he probably would have smacked me but anyway now I need money for literally everything but no one else can know.”
After that is over, it is a whole lot of waiting. Not to be rude, but he doesn’t care about seeing every single person in his class get their diploma. Clint is the first of his friends to get his. He flashes a peace sign at the audience, causing a ripple of laughter. He goes a few minutes later and has to say, it is pretty amazing to get to hold his diploma and what it means. Thor is the next person he recognizes. Then Pepper Potts. Finally, the last of the people he knows is Steve.
“Hopefully MIT. I’ve been waiting to leave this place forever and now I don’t have to stay here with my dad and his constant disappointment. Plus, it obviously has the best engineering program in the country.”
“Okay good, because I don’t know what I would do without our trips to get sandwiches. Especially because I don’t have to pay!”
“Your logic is flimsy.” She pouts, but he can see the small smile on her face that lets him know she isn’t really mad.
She puts out plates and they all sit down at the table. Sarah in the middle, with Steve and Tony sitting across from each other. They begin to eat, and Tony is pleasantly surprised at how good this tastes.
The boy’s eyes shoot open with alarm. He glances to the left at his clock, only for the red numbers to read 8:00. He scrambles out of bed and rushes to the closet, grabbing the first clean pair of jeans he can find. He almost trips heading over to his drawer, but somehow manages to grab a top with no injuries. Luckily, he had done his laundry yesterday, so his favorite shirt, a worn-down Rolling Stones tee, is right on top. He decides to keep on his socks from yesterday, so he can quickly throw on his black Vans. At this point, he doesn’t bother to tie them. He slides into his bathroom across the hall to brush his teeth. He looks in the mirror and decides that, while his brown hair is messy, it isn’t bad enough to brush.
He returns home at exactly two thirty in the morning. He collapses on the couch almost immediately. Due to an unfortunate twist of fate, he hears the garage open, and a minute later, his father appears.
That Monday, he doesn’t see Steve. He isn’t at lunch, or by his locker, or in the library. He picks at his food dejectedly at lunch as the rest of his friends chatter on next to him oblivious. Pepper shoots him pitiful looks.
The next day, he is barely able to pull himself out of bed to go to school. He considers taking the day off but between the biology project due today and the disappointed look he will inevitably get from his parents, he decides against it. Instead, he gets dressed, makes himself twice the amount of coffee, and drives to school thirty minutes late. Pepper will probably be mad at him for not letting her know she would need a different ride ahead of time, but he can’t bring himself to care.
Tony takes a deep breath and decides ultimately that he wants to come clean and be liked by her instead of trying to keep a big secret. “He runs it?”
They are guided over to a table in the center of the room. They all sit down, and his father wastes no time before roping them into a conversation about the development of a new studio. Tony tries to listen and pitch into the conversation, but in all honesty, he has no idea what is happening, and he doesn’t understand how his father expects him to. They use terms that he has never heard of and discuss capacity and finances and other things he lacks the background knowledge for. Instead, he stares down at his food and lets his mind wander.
Immediately after school, he runs over to his aunt’s diner. Peggy Carter is the nicest person ever. Her short hair is always in a perfect bun and her clothes are ironed, so she always looks put together, but she has a closet consisting of mostly soft sweaters despite the weather and she gives the best hugs, so it’s okay.
“You’re a jerk.” Tony sighs and looks around wistfully at the diner. “We should keep in touch. You know, in college. We won’t be too far away.”
He nods curtly and does his best to contribute. He uses a skill he learned during group discussions at school – just agree with what the person before you has said, throw in a fancy term, and tie it all back to the purpose of the meeting. Each time he does it, everyone at the table seems even more impressed and he can’t help but grin.
When he returns home, things are not as great as at the Rodgers.’ He isn’t surprised about that though, as their house is warm and comforting and his house is empty and cold. It doesn’t help that Howard Stark doesn’t look pleased to see him.
He can tell from Steve’s tight grip on his hand that he wants to discuss Tony’s casual mentioning of his insecurities. Tony knows that he should stop saying stuff like that when he doesn’t want to talk about it, but sometimes his mouth moves faster than his brain. “I really hope you get in. How long have you been planning this?”
“It should be settled in the next few days, which I’m glad about. This last month has been tough. Maybe after that, we could catch a movie, Anthony?”
They sit down next to each other across from their other friends. The boys seem shocked that he was sitting with them again, but to their credit they don’t mention it and continue on with their conversation as if it hasn’t been months since the two last sat there. They were in the middle of a discussion about some new horror film that just got released and Clint’s plan to take various girls to see it on a date.
“Yeah, she’s pretty funny. I can see why you like her.” Steve rolls his eyes before saying, “Clint on the other hand…”
After school, he drags himself to the diner and plasters on an energetic grin for his aunt as he clocks in.
Steve scrunches up his nose. “Don’t you have some burgers to flip or something? I didn’t come here to be criticized for my preferences.”
Tony would feel a great sense of accomplishment just for that, if he had two spare brain cells to run together.
“Of course you do, gorgeous." Steve kisses him, sloppy and perfect. Pulling back just far enough to watch as Tony cries out and squeezes around him. He's a vision, a perfect partner, and just for Steve. "Look at you, made to take it. Better than any omega I've had, not even in the same galaxy.“
And it was all his, all for him. His to have, his to take. Something Tony had stopped asking anyone for probably a decade ago.
And then...Well, Steve starts fucking him for real. Hard grinds that bottom out and light up every nerve in Tony's stretched rim. And for Tony, it's like an awakening is happening, a whole new side of Steve that he's never seen is bursting into life right here and now, the image burning into him, centered by streaks of light like the rays of dawn climbing the horizon.
He's just along for the ride. And what a ride it is. The heat from them, the wet sensation of all the lube and come inside, slipping down, slicking him open and soft. It’s almost an overload of sensation, the feeling as they thrust in counterpoint, the sounds of obscene squelching as Tony is fucked by two cocks at the same time, the gasping, the moaning, the sounds escaping them all that seem to be edged right next to somewhere that is only reachable when they are all worked to such levels of desperation.
Steve nudged the robe back further, slipping it down so he could kiss over Tony’s graceful neck, nip at his collarbones. He gripped it snugly as it slipped off the alpha’s shoulders, using it to trap Tony’s elbows by his side as he looked down at him, the arc reactor on full display, lighting up the way Tony’s eyes were wide and nervous.
At least not until he comes home early one night from a glad-handing mission that gets cut short. He heads home, thoughts full of surprising Tony, but when he gets there his enhanced hearing picks up the unmistakable sounds of passion.
Violence is not the word for what's left after the Avengers are finished. It’s not enough to encompass anything that happened when they finally reached the place their Tony had been taken.
Tony's face flickers, his brows drawing in for a split second, before it smoothed out and a toothy grin takes over. His hands slip to Steve's hips and help guide him upwards.
Steve makes a punched, wounded sort of noise before he folds down over Tony, his body a weight and a cover as he slips his arms around his smaller lover.
"That so?" Steve murmured, his eyes narrowing at where Tony is propped up on their bed. "Everyone's type, huh? You included in that, too?"
Steve closes his eyes and tries to put the rage he feels at that statement aside for later. Instead, he focuses on leading Tony to the couch, where he sits down and maneuvers Tony into his lap. As usual, Tony doesn't resist.But then, he's never shown any sign of indignation at being manhandled or taking a submissive role in the bedroom. Maybe that’s why Steve is so shocked by this entire thing: he’s come to believe Tony is secure enough in his own sexuality and desires that he wouldn’t feel the need to hide something he wanted from Steve. Sure, in the field and in other areas Tony has no compunction about ruffling Steve's feathers or pushing his buttons, but the bedroom has been pretty open and welcoming for trying all sorts of things.
And then, he finds he has more to give, when Steve groans like he's dying and licks right into Tony's sloppy hole.
Steve felt feverish, like pins and needles were crawling down his arms, into his fingers, and all he wanted to do was feel them slipping inside Tony, feel the way Tony’s body would have to be coaxed open for him. "Please, Tony...Want to open you up on my fingers."
Steve felt himself turning pink, and not in the sexy way. “Sorry,” he muttered, “I’m just scared I’ll fuck this up.”
He fucks him at a steady pace, hard enough to satisfy, but still slow enough for Steve to take it all in and hide it away covetously in his mind.
When he pulls back, Tony catches his hand, pouring a good puddle of lubricant into his palm before lying back and wriggling a pillow beneath his hips. His legs splay even wider than before, and the angle reveals more of him to Steve's gaze, letting Steve see all of him, and he fights back a growl as his fingers finally slip over Tony’s furled hole.
It's not violence when Clint works Tony over with a crop made just for him. When his aim is, as always, unerring as it leaves a latticework of precision welts across a finely muscled back that shivers and arches towards the carefully measured and meted out blows.
Steve was nervous. He and Tony had talked a lot about tonight, and Steve had done quite a lot of his own research so he knew what to expect. The internet was an amazing source of information, or it had been after he had enlisted JARVIS to help filter actual useful information when he had searched ‘topping an alpha’ the first time. Not that he was against pornography, it was just he needed actual information, not the unrealistic versions of sex offered in most things he had dabbled in watching. Besides, none of them had been nearly as hot as what he had seen that night accidentally anyway, so skipping them was no big loss.
Steve's hands framed his hips, the right tangling with Bucky’s left, the metal long since warmed to skin where the two held Tony's ass at a perfect angle. Bucky’s right hand was busy working in yet another finger alongside the others pressed inside Tony, pulling him wider and wider.
His stamina is amazing, and he keeps Tony right where he needs, making sure that this time, they will crest that peak together.
“Me too. You deserved better.” His voice shakes as he says the words he’s been thinking, even since before they were found out. “God, I’m such a fuck up. I ruin everything.”
He rolls his eyes even though she can’t see him. “They’re gone. They both had work this morning and are meeting me there.”
That Friday, Tony arrived at the Potts’ residence early to help Pepper prepare. This isn’t Pepper’s first party and it definitely isn’t the first one Tony has attended. He has been doing this since her Jetson’s themed birthday party when she turned four. They have a whole routine down – Tony lays out cups, snacks, and drinks while Pepper locks the breakable or expensive stuff in her basement.
Steve places the record on carefully and it begins to play. They leave the record on and sit on his bed. Tony tells him, “You do look really nice by the way.”
Tony tries to straighten up and plaster a fake grin on his face so that his friends don’t notice anything. Fortunately, they seem too wrapped up in their conversation to look too closely at him. His smile quivers and his eyes are slightly puffy, and he wants nothing more than to curl up in a blanket and cry, but he pushes through it.
“Not me, my parents. They don’t want me to live at home forever. Ideally, I get in on my skills so I can get a degree in something random and either play pro or maybe work for your dad or something.” Tony mentally groaned at the idea of Clint and his father working together. “We have a game this weekend, are you planning on coming?”
“Sorry, I was in no hurry to get here.” Tony shrugs and crosses his arms, causing laughter to ripple through the class.
He gets to work wiping down the booths, cleaning the dishes, and sweeping the floor. When that finishes, he does his homework. After that, he puts on the radio and hums along to the songs as he about dies of boredom.
“Yeah. I mean, there’s Pepper. Other than her though, there isn’t much good in my life. You’re a bright little sunspot.”
“My mom is nice too. She is a lawyer, so she works long hours too, but sometimes she gets up early and makes me breakfast. She does her best but works a hard job as I’m sure you know.” He hesitates and chooses his words carefully. “My dad wants what’s best for me, which I appreciate. I just wish that he could also consider what I want.”
“Hey Tony! How did it go with your dad?” Clint calls out to him, when he sees the other boy approaching.
“Seriously, let’s go. Do you know how bad it looks if we are over here just chilling by ourselves with some random dude.”
“If you don’t mind me asking, what has you working here this late at all? It’s a Thursday, we have school tomorrow.”
Pepper stands up and wraps him in a tight hug. “Well I think that you’re my best friend and the most important person in my life. That matters more than your relationship status.”
“Sit.” She sits on the bed across from him. He taps his foot nervously as she stares at him. “So, you’ll love me no matter what, right?”
“Yeah and I’m going to miss the familiarity of hating him.” She looks around before asking him, “Do you have your speech with you?”
“I’ve got to work late, a huge client from Malibu is flying in. Call and tell me how your day goes, okay?”
“I should’ve told you.” Tony argues. “I should’ve come clean about my life before dragging you into this whole mess.”
“Hello, Mr. Stark!” A burly man in a navy-blue suit saunters up to them with a skinny man with a thin chevron mustache skitters along behind him.
“Yes, I do! That’s the whole point, what am I supposed to do!” Tony lashes out, throwing his hands up in the air. He immediately regrets it and folds his arms into his chest and says, “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to dump all of this on you.”
Right now, they are standing outside of Steve’s apartment, waiting for Tony to be ready to go in. Tony taps his foot on the ground anxiously and fidgets with the hem of his shirt.
“I’ll make you a deal – you draw me, and I will show you a weird scar I have and give you the story behind it.”
The boy pauses, deep in thought. He doesn’t seem excited, like Tony had thought. Instead, he seems intrigued by him, judging by the furrowed brow and lack of fawning.
The football game ends up being really interesting. They are playing against a really good team from their region and it is a close game. Tony isn’t shocked. At this point in the season, they are one of the best in the area, if not the state. For sure if they win this game. It was close until the fourth quarter when Hayes High got ahead by twenty-eight points. Because of that, both boys got a little bored. As fun as the football games are, neither of them are sports fans and most people go for the social aspect.
“It doesn’t snow here, so you think they’d have some better decorations. Like palm trees or skyscrapers. Things that can actually be found in southern California.”
“What?” Howard looks back to where Steve is standing uncomfortably next to the bed. “You should go.”
“Plus, that guy’s such a loser. Who draws during lunch?” Tony is too tired to do anything but laugh along with him.
Steve walks into their living room and sits on the floral printed couch. Tony follows along behind him and takes a seat on the couch as well.
She gives him a hug before climbing back out the window, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts. He thinks about how he is supposed to talk to Steve or even see him without wanting to both throw up out of nerves and kiss him again. He figures he can probably talk to him at lunch or at work.
“Yes, which is actually why I’m came to see you. I made it up to my dad, so he’s giving me back my spending money.”
When Sarah Rogers opens the door, her face lights up when she sees him, and she immediately ushers him inside.
His eyes drop to the floor and he taps his foot nervously. “Yeah, I know. I just wish it didn’t have to be like this.”
“You still want something to happen between us? Even though I’m being kind of a jerk?” Tony asks him hesitantly.
“Yeah, sure.” He stands up and grabs his lunch. “I’m gonna go, I have to talk to Fury about a chem grade.”
“Okay, tell me the steps and I’ll try.” She walks over and takes the tie and follows his instructions. After the third try, it finally works. “There!”
“You are running out of time! You need to apply to certain colleges, do internships, make connections-”
The boy comes and takes a seat at the barstool in front of him, so Tony asks, “Can I get you anything?”
“Well it’s either this or I break up with Steve and actually get a girlfriend.” He stands up and looks at all of the Polaroid photos lining her walls.
Steve stumbles over his sentence, trying to find the right words. “Nothing! It’s just… hard to see how you can be friends with him.”
Tony jams his hands in his pocket and keeps his eyes ahead of him when he says, “Or, if you want, we could go back to my house and listen to some of my new records. I’ve got Queen, Elton John, The Who, Pink Floyd. The Rolling Stones, of course. You know, the good stuff.”
