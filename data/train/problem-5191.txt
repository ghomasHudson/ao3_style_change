to buy a good truck,” Tony muttered, “second: you said you didn’t want to stand out. A Ford is how you don’t stand out.”
Distantly, he heard Marple bark in distress. He called her name, but it was no more than a croak after having the wind punched out of him by gravity. Wherever he looked, his dog was nowhere to be found. Swallowing and clearing his throat in a rush, he finally managed a decent shout.
“You thought of everything, didn’t you?” Tony teased, leaning in to steal a chaste kiss from Steve’s lips. He still couldn’t believe he could, and he couldn’t get enough.
As the third canister was pulled out of his body, the cock sleeve again was lifted from him and replaced with another, and the process repeated round after round, one orgasm after another, until Tony’s orgasms were dry and both women had been inseminated multiple times.
“I’d like that, Tony,” Steve assured him with a smile, chasing his worry away with a chaste kiss. When he straightened again, he held Tony’s lunch up and pushed it into his hands.
“It’s a sexist practice,” Tony grumbled in his own defense. “It’s not like men get pageants. And I had great legs when I was sixteen—no, no not ‘great’, I looked
“You’re so hot,” Tony moaned in his sleepy-heavy voice. A faint blush rose in Steve’s cheeks, and he ducked his head before Tony caught his bashful smile. “Steeeeeeve,” he whined, reaching for Steve’s carefully styled hair and giving it an impatient tug. “You know you’re hot… fuck, you’re so hot, and this uniform… god, you should’ve waked me up by fucking me in your uniform.”
“Hey!” Steve greeted them as he walked up to their table with a large basket of assorted muffins held in front of him in offering. “I’m here to join your study group. And, I brought sustenance! No nuts, but only four are gluten free, I hope that’s alright—and this dark one has no processed sugar, they made it with dates—”
Despite the noise and the dozens of strangers milling around them, it seemed Tony had fallen asleep for some hours. When he opened his eyes, it was to a darkened room and no strangers in sight.
“You’re clearly the guy we want in a crisis,” Jimmy noted with harmless sarcasm, and Steve couldn’t help but laugh.
“You… you,” Tony gasped, words failing him at every turn. Steve grinned down at him then, and leaning in, he brushed a kiss over Tony’s floundering, parted lips.
“Bruce Banner, if the immeasurably vile Johann Schmidt, heinous traitor Brock Rumlow, or self-serving Zemo committed half the atrocities recreated by 21st century cinematic masters, we should lionize Captain America for his extensive efforts to save civilization, not—not penalize him for minor blunders.”
“Good morning to you, too,” Tony grinned up at him, and as Steve made his way to the couch, he tossed his phone aside and shifted his position to make space for Steve beside him. Steve didn’t need to be told twice. He sat down on the couch, sprawled comfortably between the large, plush cushions and the firm lines of Tony’s body.
Tony thought about it. He stared at the beige-colored food on the flat stone he used as a plate, and he wondered just how bad it would be to be as dead as that water-snake instead. What did the water-snake have to worry about anymore, in the grand scheme of things?
He pushed his door open, hung his coat and his keys up on a hook by the door, then threw on the lights.
“Mom, I’m pretty sure that won’t—” Steve tried to explain, but again his response was ignored. While she continued her stream of questioning, Steve sat down at his kitchen table with a quiet sigh, resigned to the realization that this was a monologue and not a conversation. He set the phone down on the table on speakerphone, and just tried to enjoy his drink.
Steve stared at Tony, wide-eyed. He wanted to laugh. He wanted to cry. He wanted to know why he hadn’t insisted on combining his group with Tony’s so he could know what the hell dueling penises actually meant.
“I want to feel you,” he explained, his voice low and gravely with want. “Not just your cock, Steve: all of you.”
“Steve, listen. I love you, I just can't marry you. You have no idea the pressure I’m under from my family: I come from five generations of senators. My brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He just got engaged to a Vanderbilt! That’s the kind of person I need to marry,” he added more gently. “An Eisenhower, a Kensington, a Kennedy. Not a first-generation college student who pays his bills as an underwear and swimsuit model.
“Long story short, I met a guy last night, went back to his place,” Tony was saying with a self-satisfied grin while he leaned most of his weight against the arm of the couch. “Pretty sure he fucked my back out of alignment and I need you to fix it.”
“Well,” Steve said after a moment, then, figuring he had little to lose, and Tony didn’t exactly strike him as KGB or the likes thereof. He shifted in his seat and pulled out a singed USB. “Think you could get into this?”
Tony, who knew many things but would have been hard-pressed to ever identify Blackmun at all, couldn’t help but look impressed. “You in politics or something?”
“It will be an educational display, a show and tell,” Steve explained, stroking Tony’s cock leisurely, as if it was just an absent habit. “These are people working on becoming harvesters for your planet. There are few opportunities to observe a living human as part of the training, and females are more common than males. They will pay me a lot to learn how you come.”
He wasn’t sure it made sense outside of his head, but there was a look of understanding in Steve’s eyes, so Tony counted it as a win.
“I heard that you chose Tony Stark over Lieutenant Bruce Banner as your steward today,” she said, apropos of nothing, then glanced at Steve with a guileful excitement. “You have astute instincts, Captain Steven G. Rogers. I consider them both my friends, but it is only Tony Stark who will allow me up to the roof of his domicile complex to view the stars far above the city. He will nurture your differences.”
“Here, let me help,” his dad said quietly over his shoulder when all Steve managed to do was smear the ointment over the sticky flaps of the band-aid so it wouldn’t close anymore. He was an adult, damnit, but he was also man enough to admit it felt nice to be a little coddled after a long, frustrating day.
“Lieutenant Tony Stark!” Jane cried in her excitement as she rushed forward to greet them—or, by the look of her unblinking gaze, to say hello to the legendary Captain in person. “Radiant greetings, Tony Stark, is this—are you, uh. Captain, uh. Captain America, sir?”
“Right. Forgot about that,” Clint mumbled, frowning at Steve’s point. They sat in thoughtful silence for some time, Clint counting blocks of stone in his cell and Steve picking at little tufts of pilling fabric on his dress.
Except, he, too, was at a loss for what to do. He stared at the computer, his fingers hovering over the keypad at the ready, but between the adrenaline and shock, he couldn’t bring himself to act.
“Sure made me feel like shit,” Bruce muttered, rolling up on his elbow just long enough to take another long sip of his tea. Tony reached over and scrubbed a hand through Bruce’s curls, ruffling them up affectionately until Bruce was too amused not to grin back. When he was happily relaxed on the floor again, he hummed in question and asked, “So what’s going on then? Is Steven’s being stubborn? He’s a
“So you’re not just a fan, you subscribe to Stark Adventures, too?” Tony observed with a casual humor that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “I’m flattered.”
“Checked out,” Steve grunted softly. He paused between every second or third word, wheezing softly under his breath in a most stubborn attempt to contain the agony. “I’m alone.”
“In that case, by all means: please go ahead,” Steve drawled in a playful tone. “You haven’t been wrong yet.”
Tony huffed and tried to roll his eyes, but none of that mattered. He glanced at Steve one last time, reached for his hand, and connected the call.
“It doesn’t require a lot of thought once you get into it. Writing is what I know, I… when the world becomes too much, I create another one. I got home that night after the questioning, and I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t—I don’t know how you do it,” he interrupted himself, his expression solemn and unrecognizable from only minutes earlier. “I don’t know how you can have a life outside of what you do, you—lives depend on you, families depend on you. All I had to do was answer a few questions and I couldn’t function. I went through the motions, but nothing felt right. So I stayed up and I wrote. The feedback helps,” he added with a wry, self-deprecating smile. “It helped, I mean. With all this.”
The phone buzzed in his hand and undid the vestigial resistance of his guilty conscience. He pulled it out immediately and just seeing a text from Tony cleared the drowsy fog of disinterest in his head and lifted the weight of boredom from his shoulders.
Steve arched a brow and pursed his lips. “Tell me, has that mouth of yours ever gotten you into trouble, Tony?”
“If I wasn’t so happy to see you, darling,” she said over him with a big smile, pulling him into a tight hug even as he grouched and grumbled, “you’d be getting hell for calling yourself ‘company’.”
“Does your husband know?” some tech millionaire from Germany had asked him after Tony admitted his boyfriend was easy going. “Or do you still keep them separate?”
“You know, actually, Tony and I were talking about you yesterday,” he cleared his throat and took a quick breath, then tried again. “Tony’s schedule is pretty clear this week, and he—
“Yeah,” Tony grinned, and with a mischievous wink he held his jackets open so Steve could better see the design. The t-shirt hugged him without looking inappropriately small, and despite Steve’s best efforts, his mouth ran dry at the clear outline of Tony’s strong, lean torso, his narrowing hips, and the obvious outline of the swell of his ass in those jeans.
“Wait—wait, go back to; you don’t have experience besides kissing? Steve, wait,” Tony said before the thought of Superman’s son being physically vulnerable overwhelmed him. How many people could have used him against his dad if they had known?
“Nothing would make me happier, gorgeous,” Tony whispered, before turning back to Graham with a gaming smile. “Where do you want us, sir?”
Tony stood up as Natasha walked over to speak with them, intercepting whatever conversation might have been directed at Steve while Bucky worked through the shock of adrenaline and relief running through him. Steve couldn’t hear what they were saying, but he watched as Natasha and Maria shook Tony’s hand in turn and walked away.
“You know what, Sparky? I like this. This is how I want to wake up every day. First rule: no clothes. At all, ever. Your blue eyes, these soft lips…” he brushed his lips over Steve’s, as if to highlight whose lips he wanted. “Think you can do that for me?”
He spent himself twice more in Tony before pulling out, stretched out beside the young human with a bone-deep exhaustion. Sometime between Steve’s second and third orgasm, Tony had come so hard that he had lost consciousness, and Steve now pulled him into his arms again, cradling him to his side under one arm while he tugged the covers free with the other to pull over them both.
“Oh, shit—stop! Don’t move,” a man’s voice told him in a commanding tone Tony didn’t really appreciate (but obeyed instinctively). Whoever the man was he approached from behind, and before Tony could lift his head to turn and look a big, turquoise butt plug dropped to the ground in front of his nose.
Tony shrugged, and he was already queueing up the computer with an innocent smile. “We do not have an appointment yet.”
“Phil takes the best photographs of you, my love,” Tony mentioned with laughter bright in his eyes, a tangential thought that interrupted his loving farewell. “Did he say he shared a picture of you before your meeting today? You know how I love the picture he took of us at the wedding. You had never looked so handsome, and still they had not adorned you with all your medals and honors. But I look at you now and I still cannot believe my luck. Around the world people exalt a bold new leader. At home, people grow increasingly proud and grateful of you. To think you feared your hard work would not pay off,” he teased in the end, pleased and smug all at once, like he always was when Steve feared he’d never learn, or that he would embarrass Tony and their people somehow.
“I had Potts check out the warrant, it’s legit. Now, unless you want to take a trip down to Gotham PD in handcuffs, I suggest you let it go.”
“Well, aren’t you efficient? Tax dollars at work here, clearly. Odinson, be a dear and take that, it looks heavy. Oh, didn’t see that coming, didya?” he smirked at Steve while gesturing at the enormous, muscular blond instructed to carry away the box with all their evidence. “I got one bigger and better. It’s been a pleasure, gentlemen.”
Steve blinked at Clint at the question, caught off-guard. “Tony?” he asked after a moment, then couldn’t help but smile a little. “He… yeah, yeah he looked different. What happened?”
“More like, the flight,” Tony said and reached in for some peanut M&M’s he’d already opened; he took a few for himself and offered the bag to Steve, who declined. “The closest store is two hours away back home, so whatever you need… better stock up now.”
Tony hummed something in reply, and though Steve didn’t distinguish any words, there was a positive lilt to his voice that translated into high praise. Eventually, Tony picked up his head to perch his chin on Steve’s shoulder. “How’s your face, boo?”
The fourth and most recent victim was an older man who’d been reported missing from his hourly job at a custodial service four months prior. Steve and Natasha asked the Captain to put them on the case immediately. Carter had been on their side initially, and even let them bring Bucky and Sam onboard, but as weeks without leads turned to months, she grew less supportive of their flimsy serial killer theory.
The water bottle jerked in his hand and, to Tony’s horror, it gleefully tipped half its content all over the person he’d bumped into.
When the phone rang, Tony reached for it on instinct. He couldn’t think, he couldn’t speak, he only went through the motion of connecting the phone and holding it to his ear.
“In my defense,” Tony said over his excitable group that clearly had learned more about penises than any other school group in the zoo that day, “the bees also have exploding testicles.”
Although Dunn’s former neighbors agreed on what his nurse looked like, they had no other information about the young man who visited their neighbor multiple times a week. Like most neighbors in big cities, Dunn stuck to idle chit chat about the weather or slow elevators. Nobody recalled seeing him with other people, either. No women in his life, no children, no friends. From the records on file, Steve and Bucky learned that Dunn had been married briefly in his youth, but they had no children, his nearest sibling lived in Pennsylvania, and his ex-wife had moved to Georgia soon after their divorce.
“Sudy’s data came in twenty minutes ago,” Bucky said, the first of them all to recover his relative professionalism. “The Seeking people are dragging their feet. They pushed back with some demand about warning their clients that their personal information would be shared with the police.”
“Most people would think four movies in ten months, you’re phoning it in, but this movie ...you’ve got something special here, I really mean that. It is so timely and well-done in every respect.”
“That’s… great, that’s… that’s really great,” Steve muttered to himself. He put his cup on the nightstand and started to get back under the covers. He was definitely done with this conversation. “Good night, Tony.”
“My hero,” Tony purred in delight as Steve handed him his plate of food so he could undress for the tub, too.
“What’s the matter, sir?” Tony asked, trying to ignore the gnawing fear that he’d only do more harm than good by startling the survivors he visited.
He should have expected such a response, but something about the quiet way Steve said it, as if he didn’t want someone else to overhear, gave Tony pause. “Do you,” he started to ask in a whisper, glancing at the condom Steve had dropped on the bedspread within reach, but Steve shook his head.
Tony shot Clint an irritated look, but Stephanie didn’t notice. She simply shrugged and said, “There’s no recipe, I just put them over the fire.”
Tony rolled his eyes, though he couldn’t resist a big grin. “I’ll drink to that,” he mumbled into his drink, then downed the rest of it.
Whatever change Tony noticed in Steve’s posture the moment he realized what was going on, he stumbled back, howling with laughter. The voice modulator, wherever it was, worked so well even his laugh was unrecognizable to Steve’s ears, but the way he laughed - the way he moved, his shameless half-dance, half-wiggle to have gotten one over on Steve - was so patently him Steve’s knees almost gave away with relief.
“How's Sarah been? She's gotta be relieved it's been going so well after all they went through. Hell, I still can’t believe how they found him,” Bucky mused while they walked side by side for the last two blocks, apropos of nothing. “Our moms are crazy, you know that, right? Who does that kind of recon—sure you’re predictable, but to stake out a whole museum hoping to find someone matching your type… that’s a lot of work.”
Clint frowned and crossed his arms over his chest, clearly very unimpressed. “That ain’t fair! I want the best cinnamon rolls, too.”
“So what was the work you were doing?” Steve asked, attempting to move on from all the frustrations of the past hour. “Did you have a chance to finish it?”
“Steve!” Tony breathed in his sudden shock of alarm. “Oh, god—forget the cops, she knows about you! We have to get you somewhere safe, right now. Get my phone! Steve?”
“If anything, he’s comforted she’s there and she won’t let anyone push her around,” Steve told him. “I didn’t even know, about Blackmun. I’ve always thought of him as a good guy in all this.”
Tony huffed and tried not to splutter in his shock. Looking at Steve was no help or comfort either; the damn rat was laughing so hard it looked like he’d fall over any moment.
“I have nothing to report,” Thor began to say, fussing with the sleeve of his jumper with an embarrassed frown.
Bucky shoveled one heaping spoonful into his mouth. One bite, and his droopy eyes lit up with renewed life.
“Oh,” Pepper said suddenly as a jingling ringtone got her attention. “That’ll be Happy. Time to put Olive to sleep,” she said as she got out of her seat and pulled her jacket on. “It’s been so good to see you, Tony. Take care of yourself, so you can meet her the next time you visit.”
“Second, hell no,” Tony continued emphatically. “We’ve been dating for five weeks; this is not a marriage. I’m not buying a fucking pot.”
For a moment, a little frown of confusion creased Steve’s brow, but he quickly understood. He pressed a soft kiss to the bridge of Tony’s nose and released the possessive grip of his thigh.
Carol didn’t say anything for a long time. She texted a cease and desist to Sam and Bucky, but otherwise remained silent. Instead, she ordered herself a Coke, and she sat next to Steve for a long, long time. As long as it took.
“You can’t say things like that when we’re hours away from home,” Tony whimpered into his mouth. “I’m still wearing a jacket. Where’s yours?”
With monumental effort, Steve shook his head and assured Tony he wanted it. And he did, he really did, he wanted it to be with Tony. He braced himself and turned over then, settling on his forearms and wide-spread knees. He could hear Tony fussing with something behind him, but he didn’t want to know, and he didn’t dare look—he kept his eyes on the nearest pillow, as if it was a fascinating art piece.
“Why didn’t you say it in front of Bucky? He wouldn’t care ab—oh. Oh,” Steve trailed off as he remembered there was more to Tony’s visit. “So, what’s the bad news?”
“You’re just lucky you’re not close enough for me to punch,” Tony answered with a grin in his voice, and Steve couldn’t resist smiling back. “Don’t scare me like that again.”
“And I would not find a better Prince for my kingdom, but your people need you. They have not had dependable leadership for decades and you are their last tether in a new government. I would sooner see our kingdoms united than allow you to abdicate.”
Steve had enough sense to let go when those strong, calloused fists pounded at his chest, and he leaned back into the bed to watched Tony stare back at him, panting hard and flushed dark with excitement. But Steve’s attention were focused on this new prize that was his mouth, and he couldn’t tear his eyes from Tony’s kiss-swollen red lips, glistening with the aphrodisiac of his spit.
“Not that it’s anyone’s business besides mine and Tony's,” Steve replied, cooler than any man threatened with Thor’s vengeance had any right to be. “But everything I’ve learned about Tony only makes me want to know him better. And maybe someday we can find the time to go out, the four of us?”
“It does, but only having one is a rookie mistake. You’ll want to plug it in easily when you’re home, but also take it to campus and the library without a hassle.”
“I—I can’t,” Tony repeated, and he was so agitated that he couldn’t seem to decide where to put his hands; first on his hips, then crossed at his chest, then gesturing wildly at the magic Steve had created, until finally he pushed his fingers through his hair with a long whine. “I, I don’t eat sweets. Weight loss diet.”
The audience laughed easily, but Stephen’s curiosity only grew. “What’s that like, having a fight with Captain America? Cause he has that voice - the, you know the one I’m talking about?”
The audience’s laughter swelled into a roar of excitement and applause, and across the desk, Stephen looked moonstruck.
They blinked at each other in a quiet surprise. Their little dance could have easily continued for another five to ten minutes, but Tony had caught them both unawares with his easy agreement.
“I might have… insisted?” Tony finished with an playfully innocent tone that had Clint and Maria laughing. Even Howard smirked at the memory. “You know, looking back, I don’t even get how all that was legal. It took what, a week? Ten days?”
“Hang on, I did something with that,” Steve said and hurried back to his desk to dig through his binder dedicated to the case. He flipped through the pages until he got to the photocopy of the letter in question, and turned it over to read the report. “Alright: I put Barton on that one, and he found that the guy moved to Ohio in 2011 and died in a bus accident there two years ago.”
Steve jumped out of his skin and clutched at his heart. When his eyes focused on Tony, Tony was standing right in front of him, reaching for Steve’s hands. Steve reached back for him with unsteady hands, and Tony frowned in his concern.
As the fear ebbed, and Steve noticed that there was no pain, no overt discomfort, awareness returned to him in increments. It began with his gratitude for Tony’s self-restraint, for being able to stay so still and so calm; even his voice didn’t quiver with need. He remembered the first time he fucked Tony, and even now, after having had the privilege twice, he didn’t think he could be this calm if he tried.
With Lila’s help, Steve fried all the struffoli and separated the syrup into three different pans. They added one kind of nut to each pan of struffoli, stirred it all in, and at the end, they sat around the counter picking from a plate of each variety as they each considered which combination was best. Steve was fondest of his childhood hazelnut flavor, while the rest of them were split between hazelnuts and almonds. All, except for Bucky, who took to the macadamia nut struffoli with great gusto.
“I just got back from New York,” Rhodes told Steve calmly. Steve wouldn’t look at him again, but he did hold his hand up when Bucky started barking in reply, wordlessly asking his friend to be quiet. “Listen, I know he hurt you, man. But the way he’s hurting… this has been on his mind for months. I don’t know what lies his parents pushed on him this time, but this isn’t something he’s chosen to do, Steve. I don’t know how that’ll help, but just… it wasn’t anything you did, alright?”
“I’ve been trying!” Steve insisted, grumbling to himself in his frustration. “This whole dating game is not my scene; if I don’t get him into bed soon, I don’t stand a chance.”
, who so generously donated to Jess Guilbeaux's college fund!! I love you, lady, thank you for ALL THE YELLING!!!
It wasn’t a question as much as an invitation to discuss, and Steve stepped aside to let Natasha into his room. They gathered around his couch, Maria and Natasha on either end while Steve got comfortable on the rug. Quietly and calmly, he recounted everything: his first conversation with Tony about their priority to keep joint custody, and Bucky’s forgotten episodes of infidelity and intoxication.
As soon as he reached them, Tony leaned into Steve’s space and softly whispered hello. “So, was it a good surprise?” he murmured playfully, and went willingly when Steve pulled him in for a slow, indulgent kiss.
Tony licked his lips and tried to steady himself. Steve had been honest and Tony needed to keep a clear head. He couldn’t let the personal hurt distract him from what he wanted to say.
“Not for you. I’m only here a week,” Tony reminded him gently. The more appeased Steve was with the situation, the easier he would sleep at night. It was the least Tony could do. “I’ll do what I can with these data, then I’ll get some rest while you’re all questioning Preston’s friends and family.”
Tony pressed in with a slow, steady pace. He didn’t stop to let Steve adjust until he had bottomed out. Steve did his best to relax to receive him, but Tony’s cock was thicker than he had expected, and nearly twice as long as the vibrator. It was all Steve could do not to claw at the sheets or his pillow.
It wasn’t the same anymore. The idea of seeing Tony again after so long wasn’t as straightforward as it once was. Was Steve meant to be happy, as if nothing had happened? Steve hadn’t seen Tony since August of the previous year when Tony had dumped him, and now Tony had invited himself to Steve’s graduation without warning?
Finally, there was nothing left but to sit down beside Steve’s couch and get started. Steve’s leg was slightly elevated to help with the swelling, and Tony rolled up Steve’s shorts just enough to see where the worst of it was. With great care and a light touch he loosely framed Steve’s thick thigh between his hands, and rubbed small, gentle circles down Steve’s quad with his thumbs.
It didn't help that he had no hobbies or friends to distract him from the upcoming performance where all those students were waiting for him, eager to touch a Terran male for the first time. If Tony hadn’t already been dying from his imposed celibacy, his undeniable excitement for the demonstration would have been his undoing. To think Tony’s body would be their first practical application of textbook instruction on his species’ sexuality. The thought of being used by these determined and ambitious future harvesters, to be coaxed and pried open then fucked through multiple orgasms to fill canister after canister, a living cog in the machine to be exploited endlessly without regard for his needs… it was almost too much to bear through his imposed celibacy.
“‘s ok,” Steve rasped stubbornly, and when he squeezed Tony’s wrist again, Tony gasped and pulled away.
But as Tony got to the meat of the issue, Steve could only stare at his needlessly jealous husband, dumbfounded.
It took Steve so long to comply, that Tony called his name again and repeated himself. Tony was asking Steve to get on his hands and knees, to trust Tony enough to turn his back to him and hope not to get hurt.
“But how do the cocks come in?” Tony asked with a perfectly sincere delivery that Steve almost bought.
“Tony… I owe you big time,” Steve murmured as he finished up his scan and ejected the thumb drive. “I meant what I said. Give your business card.”
“Maybe they have an understanding. There are more ways to express love and share in each other’s lives than monogamy.”
a victory, after all: at the end of all this, Tony and Clint would both walk away as free men. “I spoke with Talia. She accepted my terms: I am her betrothed, and in return for bearing her a child, a daughter, she will forgive Clint and release you both as free men. Her tribe will never again bother you, Tony. You’re safe.”
In a moment of post-coital insanity, Tony wondered if he had died, if this continued high of orgasm was what the afterlife could be. The way Steve soothed and teased his insides, and left his spent, twitching cock alone, Tony could sense the impossible happening, from the tingling in his toes to the rebuilding pressure at the base of his cock: somehow, he was already gearing up for a second round. But that couldn’t be; his brain was still sluggish and doped up from his orgasm, and he could only moan Steve’s name in warning, needing him to know that his cock would be rising to the occasion again if Steve didn’t stop what he was doing.
“Hey, Captain America: you’re safe from the pony,” Tony drawled, crawling over to the edge where Steve was now sitting on the floor. “You okay, Steve?”
“Long live the king,” the anchor echoed in a somber tone. “No comment yet from King Steven, who is currently in Berlin to negotiate the potential expansion of Stark Intellicrops into the global market.”
On that night after their visit to the Christmas market, Tony woke without realizing why. There was no knock at the door, no ringing phone. He lay still and concentrated, and soon enough, he felt it. A spasm in Steve’s hands, his fingers pressing into the meat of Tony’s ass. Even in the early stages of his dream, Tony could tell Steve wasn’t enjoying some salacious fantasy, or reliving their wedding night. There was no gentleness, no love; his fingers twitched with a nervous energy, and Tony could feel the tell-tale chills of Steve’s nightmares against his back.
This time Steve immediately stopped them. Unlike his nipples, Tony’s come was valuable. Tony was still catching his breath and trying to pull himself together when Steve carried him away from the excitable masters and lifted him up onto the platform. The cushions were inviting and reminded Tony so much of their home that he immediately felt comforted, and he settled on his hands and knees patiently while Steve handled the contraption. Whatever Tony might have expected of the machine in front of him, he hadn’t been prepared for it to fold into itself gracefully and disappear into the platform.
“Just get back to work,” was all he said before hanging up on her. He got out of the Uber and was thumbing over to his email to get some last minute work done, but unlike their dates, Tony was on time for their appointment and already waiting for him.
“That’s why he’s got you, isn’t it?” he eventually said. “You can’t blame a parent for getting tunnel vision around their children. I think you just have to be patient and remember that part of your job is to have an eye on the big picture. He’s not the lawyer; you’re the one who can see several steps ahead and see how it will play out. Remind yourself of that, give him space, and you’ll get where you need to be.”
Steve sniffed and scrubbed a hand over his face, wiping away the stray tears Tony pretended not to see. “Will you, uh,” he started to say, then cleared his throat quietly. “Will you be in it, too?”
Steve made a face and finally stepped aside to show him the empty fridge. “This is the first time I’ve been home in two months. The only thing that hasn’t expired is my ice and my champagne.”
“Rest, my pet,” Steve told him in a whisper, rubbing down Tony’s flanks with a warm, reassuring touch. “I am here. No-one will hurt you.”
“You already have,” Steve replied, a corner of his lips curling up in a shy, lopsided smile. “Look, I know it can be good, I’ve seen it. I just haven’t had that, yet. I want it to be you,” he added, his words stronger and more confident. This, he had no doubts about. “I want this to be with you.”
“I didn’t want to go too fast, I thought I’d let you drive. Kansas is a little different from New York, I didn’t want to pressure you or, you know. Make you uncomfortable.”
Tony narrowed his eyes, and Steve smiled back, happy as a clam. If Tony didn’t want to count their important conversation about a potential relationship just because their food was reheated homemade comfort food, he was going to have to fight Steve for it.
“Don’t give me that, Rogers,” Tony said quietly, glancing down the hallway then as if to check for someone in pursuit. “Look, please. That was three years ago. Can we talk?”
Steve fell back against the wall with the force of Tony’s dead weight thrown into his arms. Tony clung to Steve with powerless limbs wrapped around Steve’s neck, staring back at Steve in wide-eyed surprise. He was so unfamiliar with pain, he had not known pain like this existed. Tony’s wet, stuttering gasp brushed against Steve’s lips.
A primal groan tore from somewhere deep in Steve’s throat, and with a vicious snap of his hips, he thrust his cock all the way into Tony with such sudden force that Tony cried into his mouth and pulled back from the kiss with guttural moan.
“Not really,” Steve said with a wry twist of his lips. “A task takes as long to finish as you allow it.”
“Sweetheart?” Steve whispered, cupping Tony’s cheek to gently encourage him to meet Steve’s eyes. “Sweetheart, look at me. I couldn’t care less about the shirt. Is something going on with your committee?” Steve guessed suddenly, frowning at the possibility. “What hoops are they making you—”
Now, here he was, powering through all of his assignments and homeworks for the month over one weekend. It wasn’t easy, but every minute he worked was a minute he didn’t wallow in his misery. When he slept, cloying, unrelenting nightmares of a life without love suffocated him. And if there was anything Steve could do, it was devoting himself to a task body, heart, and soul. Whether he was writing a research paper or tearing through a workout, Steve’s tunnel vision was a thing of legend.
Steve led them to the top of the marble stairs where Tony could get a full view of the villa with its classic symmetric design to his right, and the clear, peaceful pool to his left. If he said anything those first few minutes, Tony didn’t hear him. All he could think about was the house and how the new perspective showed the gardens behind it stretching out into the treeline of the park beyond. It was a mansion, a sprawling, timeless country estate, but part of its charm was how little it interfered with the beauty of the world around it. In the distance the ocean reached out past the trees, dark, endless, and full of mysterious life, a stark contrast to the sun-warm water in the pool that was so clear Tony could make out every glass tile in the vibrant blue-green mosaic lining the sides and bottom.
More often than not, they were at Steve’s place. Steve lived in a two-bedroom out in Bushwick, eight stops down from Tony’s apartment on the J line. With the two-bedroom came a bay window, a real kitchen, and a living room. There was enough counter space for them to cook together, a coffee table virtually made for puzzles and board games, and cable TV, so they could both watch the Knicks lose from the comfort of Steve’s very big, and very comfortable, couch.
Steve told the goddamn drink to fuck off, picked it and the accompanying straw up with a vindictive grip, then marched back to their section.
What rational thought Tony could muster assured him he would do the same had the tables been turned. But if Tony was honest, his facade of well adjusted poise was crumbling and he had looked forward to a night of taking comfort in Steve’s effortless strength. There was a surety to Steve that grounded Tony with purpose, and he needed it now in the aftermath of his abduction more than ever.
Steve watched her, overwhelmed with different thoughts and feelings. On one hand, he was a little jealous she’d had the good sense to dump his ass and Steve didn’t. On the other hand, he felt an unexpected sense of pride in her for never doubting what she’d heard, for believing that the blame was fully with Professor Hawley, and for taking a stance where others could easily have shrugged it off and moved on. Steve imagined a lot of people would for a six-carat diamond and lifelong financial security.
“That’s what I’m trying to say,” Rhodey said with a long-suffering expression. “This should be about you and Steve, not what other people like. What does
“We’ll see you back here at three, Mr. Rogers,” he heard Tony call his way, before Steve could make his mind up about combining groups or not. “My phone is on if anything changes.”
“This feels nice,” he admitted, rubbing at the end of a pair of silk boxers. “Not worth one eighty-five, but it’s nice.”
Tony moaned in delight at the sudden attention, already close to the edge and hungry for a fuck himself. The thought that his body had such immediate effects on whatever Steve was thrilled him; in this alien world, this was a source of power he sorely lacked otherwise, and it left him heady with excitement over the possibilities. So while Steve tried to get off with quick but painfully dry frottage, Tony sucked down one of his own fingers, coating it with as much spit as he could before reaching down and sweeping his wet finger over Steve’s full bottom lip.
“If the decorative touches in my domicile put you ill at ease, Steve Rogers,” he started, sounding a touch apologetic. “You are welcome to take this with you - I can show you to your domicile at once.”
Adding insult to injury, this was the most physical attention Tony had received in weeks. It didn’t matter that his hole burned from the extensive and abrasive intrusion, that tears stained his cheeks, or that every time the master’s blunt teeth scraped over his balls, Tony felt faint with fear. By the time Steve reacted to his pet’s unexpected shout and freed Tony from the master’s greedy mouth, Tony’s balls were drawn up against his body, his cock was leaking precome all over his abdomen, and his thighs were tender and quivering with need.
Later that night, Steve had only just kicked off his running shoes and made his way into the kitchen for a snack when his phone rang.
Steve opened his mouth, but only a helpless gust of a laugh escaped him. “It’s a really long story,” he hedged, floundering as he tried to think of a short summary. “I thought I loved a guy who only wanted to marry someone serious, so I worked hard and got into the same law program he did. Got all the way to Harvard Law School and realized he was a dickhead this whole time.”
It wasn’t shaping up to be the kind of story Steve wanted to hear first thing on a Thursday morning, but since it no longer sounded like a story that would have him punching someone’s teeth in either, he figured he could just sit down in a nearby seat and let Tony explain.
With a huff of frustration and a few choice words, Tony snatched up the water bottle and sauntered out of his own office. His private elevator took him all the way down to the lobby, and he stepped out into the lobby that he had had a big hand in designing for his tower. The tower was his baby, and he preened a little every time he saw people hanging out in the seating areas by the small cafe, the little alcove for puppy therapy, and the little indoor garden surrounded by tall windows where visitors with children would often spend some time feeding turtles or counting fish.
Tony’s lips twitched up into a smile, something curious and amused that soothed Steve’s uncertainty into hope.
“WE DID IT!” Bucky shouted with a cheer, and Steve couldn’t help but laugh along as he clung to Bucky’s borderline aggressive hug. “We’re free, we fucking did it! No more textbooks, Stevie! No more bullshit!”
“What am I supposed to do with that?” Steve asked in a small voice, unable to even look Rhodes in the eyes anymore. “If you’re asking me to wait for him—”
“Steven Grant Rogers. Is that how you speak to your own mother?” she complained before Steve managed to hang up, and really, he should have just done it anyway. He should hang up on her right now, before she started her trademark guilt trip—or worse: before she started to cry.
A cold rock dropped in Steve’s gut. He really hoped this wasn’t what he thought it was. “With whom, Professor?”
And then, she did nothing. Steve side-eyed her after a few seconds of awkward silence, and she just gestured at the computer and said, “Google it!”
Except, who would he call? He wanted a doctor to look Tony over, but beyond such a general goal, the thought of allowing anyone to see Tony so vulnerable made him irrationally defensive. If Steve had it his way, nobody would see Tony until the color was back in his cheeks and his words didn’t slur together.
“Then Thor’s a Jason Mamoa,” Jane informed him, not without pride. “Big and intimidating, but it only makes you want him more.”
Seconds turned to minutes, and eventually, Tony must have lost his limited patience. “Steve? Say something, please,” he whispered, leaning after him. Steve could feel the warmth of his hand hovering just over his shoulder, and it was almost as infuriating as if he had been touched.
“You hungry, Steve?” Tony whispered into Steve’s hair, hoping he wouldn’t wake the man if he’d already fallen asleep.
Steve must have dropped off for a moment, because the next thing he remembered was the mattress dipping with Tony’s weight as he slid in under the covers.
“So much,” Steve whispered softly, keeping his voice low for Tony’s sake. He used his elbow to bump the switch for the jacuzzi jets to come on, then climbed in with care.
“Thank you,” he said after a momentary silence. Carol sighed and braced herself for another sprinting narrative of sexual exploits or arrogance, when Tony instead said, “For yesterday. It’s really cool, you know. That you helped. I’m one of three things around here, it’s… not to Steve, though. Rhodey said you’d be good for it, helping someone you didn’t know.”
“In light of this new evidence, it’s become clear to the court that Mrs. Hansen was a minor at the time that she signed the prenuptial agreement, which invalidates the contract. Seeing as the marriage lasted longer than four years, however, we may see a case for an equal division of all marital assets.”
“We’re not here for socks,” Tony reminded him, unfazed by the clear injustice of capitalism. “Just let me know if you like something so I can stay clear of it.”
. If he wasn’t careful, if he didn’t take care of himself in these precious few hours to recover, tomorrow he might miss a step. People were counting on him to stay sharp - not just the families of the victims, but detectives and officers were looking to him for direction. Tony was counting on him. He couldn’t let any of them down.
Next to them, Mr. Perfect was looking anywhere but at Tony or the butt plug. If anyone could telegraph actively trying to become invisible, it was this guy.
“If he doesn’t throw in the towel soon, I’ll’ve to try that,” Tony thought out loud, picking up his phone to tap the idea into his project notes to be sure he wouldn’t forget. “That’s a shit move.”
“Oh, god,” Tony murmured in sudden shock. “You’re really doing it, you’re retiring Captain America, you’re leaving me to—”
Once she had settled in and gotten to work, it was easy for Steve to fall in as well. Somehow, it was easier to concentrate when people were seated and working than when they packing or unpacking. Chatting, for that matter, rarely disrupted them either.
“Good, thank you for sharing with us, Tony,” Dr. Odinson said after jotting down some notes. Then, he turned to Steve. “And then you, Steve. Tell us about yourself and your family.”
But as much as he wanted to hurry and find his salvation in Tony’s heavenly body, Steve didn’t want to miss a moment of it. He sat down on the couch beside Tony, close enough that Tony’s knee pressed against Steve’s thigh and his hand brushed against Steve’s shoulder every time Tony released and clutched at the back of the couch again in feverish anticipation. A dark flush had already colored Tony’s chest, his neck, and his face, and as Steve absorbed Tony’s glazed, needful expression, he couldn’t help but wonder how long Tony’d preoccupied himself with fantasies of how their night would play out. How many meetings had he suffered through with the distraction of his hard cock aching for Steve’s touch? If only Steve had been there with him, Tony would have left the hotel satisfied before his meetings every morning. In a dark fantasy world, Steve could even imagine himself on his hands and knees between Tony’s legs under a conference table, tending to his lover’s needs between one meeting and the next.
“You need to look the part,” Tony sighed impatiently, as if how to ‘look the part’ was information Steve should already know via default gay factory settings. Were sugar babies universally allergic to grey slacks and he was the last to know?
“Sex’s messy, ‘s okay,” was all Steve managed then, though he seemed to have given up on telling Tony to sleep.
“What—what the hell for? This can’t wait forty minutes?” Tony asked in utter bemusement. “People have been waiting a long time, some people don’t even live in the city. Twenty minutes?” he offered, before Steve or Bucky had a chance to say no to his first question. “Just, twenty minutes.”
“Officer Jane Foster, what a peachy surprise! Be well and enter,” Tony said easily, gesturing for the plush seats opposite his desk. “Have a seat, my friend.”
“There’s rocks in Mississippi with better sense than the two of you,” she shouted back, tossing the pan and ladle back on the counter. “Your brother’s home for the first time in seven years, and this is how you welcome him?”
Tony perked up and craned his neck to see from the table he was at, then, seemingly convinced it wasn’t a total waste, he came over with his own small armful of acceptable options to personally inspect what Steve had found.
It wasn’t until Steve squeezed Tony in his safe, strong arms that Tony dared to believe it was real.
“Aaaand let me stop you right there,” Steve finally said loudly enough to block out the sound of his mother’s voice. It was all fun and games until money came into the picture. “Mom! Mom, can’t you hear yourself? These are not appropriate questions for a new relationship.”
“Detectives, Mr. Stark to see you,” the officer said before leaving them to handle the awkward conversation on their own. Bucky gaped after the damn traitor, while Steve could only stare at Tony. Handsome Tony in his fitted jeans and bundled up in silk, cashmere, and leather. Steve’s fingers itched to explore the divine textures of his luxurious sweater, his silken scarf, and the contrast of his soft, smooth skin with his meticulously shaped beard.
Steve smiled back at him, but he said nothing. He bowed his head, and with his eyes closed he pressed a soft kiss over Tony’s sternum, taking that moment to let his lips linger over his heart.
“Yes, finally!” Tony said with such excitement that Violet startled and turned tail to hide under Steve’s arm again. Steve wrapped his arm around her and held her tight to his chest, while Tony, mortified, rubbed her ears and apologized profusely.
Tony smiled up at him and pressed a little kiss to Steve’s shoulder. “I’m not just rushing home for you, darling,” Tony told him as they walked hand in hand to the bar. “I miss Pepper and I miss Rhodey. I’d like you to meet them. If nothing else happens here tonight, all the better.”
“You could open it, you know,” Steve whispered. Tony glanced at him with a smile, and did exactly that.
Steve wasn’t sure he heard right, or even understood what Tony was hinting at, but if he was right… if it really was the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences calling to speak with Tony, Howard’s inexplicable morning call made perfect sense.
,” Tony said through his gritted teeth, “I’m free to be who I want, where I want to be. For the first time in my life, I get to be myself without answering to anyone. Does that answer your question,
“If you want, of course,” Steve assured him in that brief silence while Tony wrestled with his fear of being too clingy. As if Tony’s silence was a symptom of reluctance. “If you’re not busy.”
Steve watched Tony through his monologue with a tired expression, resigned to just letting him finish. When Tony finally quieted down, Steve shook his head and simply said, “No, Tony. You had no right to out me without my consent.”
, Steve didn’t say. He had no voice, no words worth sharing. He was simply too late. All he could do was nod along, wave good-bye, and pretend it didn’t hurt.
Tony curled into him and nuzzled into his throat lazily. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if Tony faded into sleep any minute.
Steve still had his phone pinched between his shoulder and his ear when he gestured for his best friend to come in out of the rain. “Hang on, my friend’s here at ten o’clock at night for no good reason,” Steve told Tony before taking the phone in hand and turning his attention to Bucky and his three bulging black and white shopping bags. “What’s this, Bucky? Did you rob Sephora?”
“Mr. Stark, you are here to answer a few questions about some recent murders, including one that took place earlier tonight,” Steve informed Tony from across the interrogation room. Bucky loomed behind him, fundamentally committed to his
“We’re watching Blade at Tony’s tonight,” Sam explained, and Tony perked up with a grin. “BYOPNB: bring your own pizza ‘n booze.”
Tony wanted to reach out to touch him, or at least repeat his question. Somehow, he resisted. Long minutes passed before Steve dared to let his hands fall away, and he opened his eyes again.
“It, uh. It’s wrinkled,” Tony mumbled, his voice unusually quiet. Steve must have noticed something was off, because he forgot the shirt and took a step closer to Tony instead.
Confirmed Foster for Ellen. Danielle Yin manuscript received and under review. Finalized Sitwell transition, re-assigned his work. Priorities on my desk for your oversight, final five accounts distributed to Wilson and Lang as you wanted.
Steve blinked at her, dumbfounded. Apart from Sharon’s mean spirited invitation, this was the first time he’d been invited to join someone in the program. So while he’d recently come home from hours at the library and he was enjoying a productive streak at his own desk, Steve told her he’d only need a minute to be ready.
The moment Clint turned his back, Tony pounced on his brother and wrangled him away from the stove in a chokehold.
“Not quite, sir,” Steve said, brushing biscuit crumbs off his hands before putting his cloth napkin away and giving Howard his full attention. “I work for a global—”
He reminded himself of Tony’s sleepy, tired smile. Of the sound of his slow, deep breathing while he slept, tucked against the length of Steve’s legs with his head in Steve’s lap only moments ago, before Howard woke him.
“So, uh,” Tony started with a feigned nonchalance. He was just a regular guy sitting in the middle of the woods giving his dog belly rubs, no big deal. “What are the odds you’d believe that this isn’t what it looks like?”
That's the image I can't get out of my head: Tony sucking on Steve's balls just a little too aggressively, hungrily, sloppily, dripping spit, while looking right up into his eyes, Steve still choking in disbelief and staring at Tony with wonder, while Tony is jerking Steve off over his own face. Tony looking up at Steve until Steve comes all over his face. Tony would moan heavily around his balls when Steve finally comes, and as Steve is coming off his high Tony finally releases them, lazily sucking open kisses to catch all his excess spit, then lapping the length of his softening cock base to tip, maybe even taking it softly into his mouth for the very last of his come. And when Steve's thighs really start quivering dangerously, and he's whimpering from too much stimulation, Tony releases him. Draws a thumb through the come across his face and purposefully catches Steve's eye as he sucks it clean. It's just burned into my thoughts. that eye contact. the Want.
Steve, however, didn’t seem to understand. He followed Tony into the room and watched everyone else filing in and taking the available seats. When nobody acknowledged that they were two seats short, he pointedly turned to look at Tony.
Steve frowned down at the phone again. This felt different. They weren’t at a place where they could talk about anything and everything anymore, not like they had before, but they also didn’t ask for permission before a conversation. This sounded serious.
Tony squeezed Steve’s hands gently, looking at them for a beat before turning back to Steve and looking him straight in the eyes as he guided Steve’s hands around his body to squeeze his ass.
It was just a divorce case, Steve tried to tell himself. Yes it was a big deal to him because it was his first real case, and yes he’d still do his best to represent their client, Mrs. Hansen, but at least it wasn’t a murder case or something where someone could go to prison if they (he) made a mistake. Alimony and child support could be renegotiated in the future if necessary, which was so much better than trying to free an innocent soul who ended up in prison because of bad representation.
“Go before you’re late, do the show and come back safely. Please don’t die,” he felt the need to say even though it sounded silly, “because if you do, I will do my best to date Anna Kendrick just to get back at you for making me a widower. Okay? And if that’s not incentive enough,” he said, lowering his voice into a deep, guttural growl. “When you come home, we will watch tonight’s show together. I am going to suck your dick through the whole monologue, then eat your ass out for every second that the musical guest is performing. How’s that for clear instructions?”
Tony was already out of breath and begging for him. “I miss you, my love,” he whispered hoarsely, looking through the camera into Steve’s eyes. Steve’s breath caught in his throat, and mindlessly he reached down to press the heel of his palm over his aching cock before he lost his mind.
With the help of other staff, their waitress filled their table with feta baked in crunchy phyllo pastries, fried zucchini and cheese patties, dolmades with spiced rice and sultanas, stuffed peppers with beef, vegetables, and feta, and a salad of grilled eggplants with a balsamic glaze. The moussaka was fresh out of the oven, the chicken stew brimmed with olives, tomatoes, and cauliflower and filled the air with scents of cinnamon and garlic.
Steve dared to look up, dared to straighten up to stand tall beside Tony. That was when he finally made out the two men standing on the raised porch with rifles in their hands.
None of his friends said a word, and chose to turn to each other for conversation after that. They knew better than to talk to him when Steve was in a mood.
“Duffle!” Tony managed in a gasp, trying and failing to look for the bag he’d so carelessly discarded minutes ago. “Lube’s in the duffle, Steve—get it, baby, please fuck me—”
The picture Steve painted pulled Tony out of whatever thoughts weighing on his mind, and he snickered giddily at this new depiction of Captain America. “Captain America, house spouse?” he teased. “That’s a big career change, Steven, you think you can handle it?”
“Good morning, welcome to the Today show! So glad you could make it,” a chipper young woman greeted them with a smile and a clipboard. “My name is Rachel, I’ll be taking you through—but first, anything you need?”
“The same month you broke up with me, I was going to propose,” Steve explained sheepishly. “I had a whole plan, I was going to propose and give you that ring and ask for my dog tags back. But, it didn’t happen, and then I couldn’t part with it. I thought I’d keep it until I got over you then sell it, but that never seemed to happen, so I kept it.”
“Right, sure. Pepper - you remember Pepper? You’d like her, Steve, she’s, she’s a force of nature. Pepper noticed early on that… maybe the women and the, the partying didn’t work for me. She’s perceptive like that. She didn’t bring it up, until my mother stopped by around Christmas last year for lunch. She, she has this way of talking that just, I don’t know, works? So, we talked, I told her what was going on, and then… then she asked the simplest question,” Tony said with a thoughtful, marveling smile on his lips. “She asked me why I don’t start my own company and hire anyone Howard fires. And I… Steve, I don’t—it had never occured to me, you don’t—”
In vain, Tony tried to block it all out by focusing on Steve’s familiar warmth against his back. The masters cupped and squeezed him in their big paws, taking turns weighing and rolling his balls in their palms, kneading and pulling on them until Tony cried out from the sudden alarming pain.
The hesitation in Tony’s look of hope and excitement eased away at last with unexpected laughter, and he brought Steve’s hands to his smiling lips for an affectionate kiss. “You, Steve Rogers, are more than that. You are more than I could have hoped for. Let’s do it, take me to your place already, because I can’t wait to see what it means to be cared for by you.”
“You,” Tony gasped, touching Steve’s face like he just couldn’t believe what he was seeing. “Are—you’re real,” he whimpered, and then he couldn’t stop touching Steve, from his broad shoulders to his tapered waist, to his long, thick erection that was unlike anything Tony had ever seen. And the camera was supposed to add ten pounds, so that was saying something.
Tony dropped back in his seat and hid his face behind his hands. He couldn’t laugh. One of them had to be the adult here, damnit.
“It’s what I get for laughing at Timmy all these years,” Tony grumbled to himself, and Mr. Perfect laughed. He laughed so unexpectedly and so freely that Tony basked in the sound, soaking it up like sunshine on a cloudy day.
“We do not know what lives in these sewers, Steve Rogers,” Tony hissed back in alarm. “There may be crocodiles, or, or mutant rats the size of crocodiles! You will walk behind me, where you are safe.”
Finally, a slick cock sleeve was lowered on his hard cock. It was unusually warm and so very soft, and Tony purred with delight. Between the tight, velvety clutch of the cock sleeve, his sensory deprivation, and the fast, aggressive thrusts of the thick canister, Tony had no chance to hold on. His orgasm rocked through his body like a storm, his hips thrusting wildly to empty himself into the cock sleeve as far as his restraints allowed.
What looked like beautiful, glazed porcelain on the outside felt like putty to the touch and smelled distinctly of motor oil.
He stared at Mr. Perfect and his perfectly pleasant smile. Not a taunting smile or a malicious smile, but a kind smile behind which peals of laughter lurked.
Color rose in Tony’s cheeks at the praise, and he preened under Steve’s watchful eyes. “Yesterday,” he whispered, watching Steve pick up a new sleeve to roll over his cock. “Did that… that thing want me?”
“Where are you going?” he demanded of his brother, who was clearly strapping something over the saddle of a horse. “It’s not the season.”
There were only a handful of bench tables, so most of the incoming law students were gathered on blankets on the lawn in groups of four or five. Steve walked around looking for Brock until one of the students organizing the small event told them to find their seats. Where could Brock be? This was orientation for their whole class of thirty-six, it shouldn’t be that hard to spot him.
“Don’t act like you don’t like it, Mr. President,” Steve teased in a deep rumble, but before Tony had a chance to respond or climb him like a tree, he pressed a quick kiss to Tony’s cheek and straightened with a more thoughtful expression.
Hours after the sun set and well into the night, Tony finished his book and made his way back to Steve, who was still lingering on some pages in Hammarskjöld’s memoir.
In the gasping silence of the bullpen, Steve thumbed through the substantial stack in his hands. With a quiet hum of satisfaction, he waved the tickets at Tony and gestured for the bathroom. “See you in a few minutes.”
The first step was to find a potential partner to pursue, and Steve wasn’t dense enough to doubt whom that was. His heart (among other parts of him) desperately desired Tony Stark.
The first four lifts of the digger were smooth and easy. There was some resistance near the end, but after several firm thrusts into the ground, Tony heard the satisfying snap of a branch giving way, and he finished without a problem.
With his head still pillowed on Steve’s chest, Tony could hear his heart racing. He took one deep, slow breath, then leaned up on his elbow so he could look Steve in the eyes. The shock and grave concern in Steve’s expression were expected, but it hurt to see guilt so obviously shaking him.
Steve was just pondering how long one had to wait before ‘boyfriend’ was upgraded to ‘partner’ when the peaceful silence was interrupted by an incoming email chime on Tony’s phone. He slid the eggs onto a plate along with refried black beans, steamed broccoli, and so many jalapeños it made Steve’s eyes water and carried it to the table for Tony.
Full of reinvigorated confidence he sauntered into the room and took a seat in the front row. All around him students unfold their laptops in silence (one smarmy soul had even brought
“Is it true, sir, that the Captain succumbed in the 21st to the evil entanglements of the villain Crossbones?” Jane asked in the silence Tony had allowed. “Did he, too, become a villain in the end?”
“Assuming I don’t fail anything this semester,” Steve hedged, careful not to jinx himself. “Mom is only thirty minutes from the clinic. She offered to cosign a lease with me, did I tell you? Maybe I’ll do that later. It just feels like a lot to figure out at the same time. Maybe I can have some savings in my pocket, find a better place to stay.”
Steve reached out to the detectives who had worked with them from the 62nd and 20th, and nearly all of them answered the call. En masse they stormed building and the apartment itself. Dunn or Kline or whatever he called himself wasn’t in sight, but there was no question they had their man. Photos of Tony were meticulously pinned to the walls like tiles, making it impossible to guess at the color or wall paper in any room of the apartment. A great variety of photos were taken outdoors all across the city, and contextual clues made it clear Kline had been following Tony for months.
But then he gave himself a shake and gently pushed at Steve’s shoulder. “Love where your head’s at, but econ first. Come on, we might as well get started,” he added, to Steve’s mild disappointment. It wasn’t like Steve didn’t think they’d work; after all, that was the main reason Tony had come down for the three days while Patrick was away. He had just hoped it would be more naked tutoring than the traditional, sexless kind.
Steve acknowledged her report with a nod. “Get a hold of PR,” he said as he considered the first print of a manuscript that had just come off the press. “Have them whip up a press release: Foster is doing Ellen.”
At four in the morning, Steve woke to the sound of an incoming message on his phone. Neither he nor Tony had any business being up at that time, and adrenaline coursed through Steve’s veins like ice. He jolted upright and grabbed for his phone with another hand automatically on the hotel phone to call Bucky in.
and realized they would hit it off and be friends on their own, Steve hadn’t felt jealous or worried about being left behind.
“Not for nothing, but that Kim Cattrall was hot,” Bucky garbled around another sizable mouthful of various cream and chocolate balls.
Steve gravitated towards him and cupped Tony’s face in his hands, kissing him breathless. Tony moaned shamelessly with delight, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck to draw himself flush against Steve’s body as he eagerly, greedily, returned the kiss.
These students wouldn’t be like the greedy, careless assholes who paid Steve to use him and had no compunction about what their scales and teeth and claws did to Tony. As future harvesters they had every reason to be gentle and attentive to his needs: they were honing the art of harvesting orgasms without waking sleeping humans from their dreams, so they all had a vested interest not to hurt him. He imagined there might still be a minority of impatient students who wouldn’t take the time to lick the back of his knees or suck his nipples raw as they opened him up for a fresh canister. Not everyone would be present enough to make him feel precious and cherished the way Steve did, or take the time to whisper praise in his ear while fucking his sleeping body.
But long before his anthropology classes at NYU helped Steve understand the complicated history of social inequality, class, and ‘race’, his mom had sat him down and explained it in words he could understand as a child. Those who judge and react with hate are not inherently evil, they are simply afraid. Whether they understand it or not, their anger belies their fears and insecurities. The typical person was never after conflict or pain, even if that was how they responded to the world.
After updating Bucky on the four letters Tony had identified and on the Ivan Antonovich, Steve called it a day. It was well past nine when he left the building, over thirteen hours since he’d gotten in that morning. He knew he needed sleep; he was tired, he could feel it in the tension in his back, the headache behind his eyes. He walked the whole way home in the hopes of feeling sleepier by the time he got home, but it was no use. The last thing he wanted to do was get into bed.
