This time Steve broke the kiss, and enjoyed the way Tony's lips chased after his just a little. “Alright, pet, if you want to do this, get up on your hands and knees, head toward the headboard, and close your eyes.” Tony scrambled to obey, and Steve took a moment to enjoy the view, his pet eager and waiting, not-quite-tense but maybe trembling a little, breathing already a little ragged; he ran his hand over the fading bruises from yesterday, and thought about how he was going to do this. “OK, right. I'm just going to do a few test smacks with each one, and then, if you don't like it, you tell me 'no, thank you,' if you do like it, you say 'yes please,' and if you're not sure, you can say 'more,' 'harder,' or 'softer.' Got it?”
of dirty thoughts rushing through his head, til Steve coughed a little. “Tony? Did you want to talk to me, or just stare at my body?”
Steve poked thoughtfully at the remains of his cereal. “I, ah, I guess I hadn't thought about it yet. Umm, but now that I am...” He looked up at Tony through his lashes. “I think I was already thinking of us as partners. We run this team together, don't we?”
Steve rumbled happily, and took the cake plate from him. “Cake for breakfast? You're so decadent.” He scooted up against the headboard.
Steve knew he was bright red as the elevator started moving, and he found that he didn't have a single thing to say, but after a moment, Tony took pity on him (or just couldn't help himself) and started rambling. “So, it's not much of a plan, but I figured, my favorite deli's up near Bloomie's, we can pick up some subs and take them to The Park, and then just walk down 5th to the museum. And we don't have to stick with the Rothko. There's the whole rest of the museum, we can totally go mock Warhol for being shallow and pretentious, or find an emerging artist to support, or-”
”, where Tony once again watched Steve be enthralled. Tony actually laughed aloud at him when he remembered the sketchbook clutched under his arm and flipped it open to begin drawing frantically. Tony only pried him away when he tore through a page in his eagerness to get something down.
not going to last long once he was properly inside Tony. Hopefully he would recover as quickly with a partner as he had every night last week, in front of his computer.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and drew him close. “Hey, hey, relax, shh, shh, it's ok. I want this too, I want you... I'm not sure I want the billboard, but yeah, I want you, and I doubt you're going to screw it up as bad as you think.” Tony tried to pull away, to protest, but Steve gave him A Look, and he subsided a little. “So, if I stay here tonight, am I going to wake up to Pepper hustling me out the door?”
She rolled her eyes. “Boss. Technically, since I'm the CEO, and you're just a department head, I'm your boss now.”
Steve lifted his chin out of the way. “Mmm, yeah... Wait, no.” He stepped back a little. “You are a very tempting man, Tony Stark, but we both need food, and then I'm pretty sure you have a job to go to.” He turned to the door, but held out his hand. Tony took it, feeling like a teenager, and let himself be led down the stairs to the communal kitchen.
Steve nodded. “Thank you, JARVIS. Alright, folks, shall we put this on hold until our team member is back?” They teased him for playing leader all the time, but they moved to the living room and Clint put on Mario Kart to keep them occupied for a little while.
Steve laughed at him, but in the nicest possible way. “The two of us probably don't, but when is any meal around here just the two of us? The rest of the team is going to show up pretty soon. Probably as soon as they smell bacon. I figured I'd be prepared.”
Steve gulped a couple of times, then nodded. “Good. It's good. You're... Oh, God, you feel so damn good... You're so warm, so hot, so tight... Please, will you, can you...” He pulled Tony's hips toward him, then pushed him back a little, and Tony figured it out. He started rocking back and forth on Steve's cock, and they both moaned. Tony moved a little faster, starting to adjust to the almost over-full feeling, starting to really get into it... Steve gasped, and clenched his hands on Tony's hips, his own hips snapping up, and Tony felt hot liquid spurt up into him. Steve dropped back down.
I'm not a "posting schedules" kind of person. Sorry. My muse just doesn't work like that. But rest assured that this story is roughly plotted out, and will probably be 10-12 chapters, AND I have a couple of sequels in the works. Plots and plans, children, plots and plans...
Tony lifted his head, grinning at- oh, my god, was Steve Rogers his boyfriend? He felt his grin getting even bigger. “Good morning yourself. I might even say great morning, but that might ruin my rep as a laid-back guy.”
Rhodey was peering at him a little, clearly suspicious. “And still I can't help feeling there was something in
weird! Though, that Necessity one, I'm not sure if I'm insulted or relieved that they didn't ask for one of the early armors.” And of course that conversation carried them into the restaurant and through the ordering and delivering of food.
, you know? I mean, I know, as a fact, that there are images from all sorts of artists that I could go find on the Internet, but it doesn't connect to the thought that I, personally, could see those images. It's like the whole world is both bigger and smaller, somehow.”
JARVIS sounded thoughtful. “I'm sure I couldn't say, Ms Potts, but on a completely unrelated topic, you may be interested to know that Captain Rogers spent all of last night in Mr Stark's bedroom.”
A cane, though, Steve knew exactly what to do with; he had, after all, gone to Catholic school during the Depression. He shifted around to get the proper range, and laid in to Tony. Six stripes up, from the back of the knees to the curve of the ass, then six back down again, in perfect metronomic rhythm, all juuuust a little harder than he thought Tony could comfortably take. On strike eight, Tony started moaning aloud, and on stroke ten he yelled. “Yes, please, more, God, yes, more, please, Captain, yes...”
Tony had originally made the offer while high on surviving not only a battle with aliens and gods, but personally escorting a nuclear warhead through an interdimensional portal. When his head had cleared the next day, he'd had some serious second thoughts about opening his home to a ragtag group of superpowered (and possibly insane) individuals, but now that they'd mostly settled in, he was strongly considering making all his decisions in a seriously altered state. It was like the best possible version of all that college crap he'd missed out on by being too young and precocious.
Rhodey waved it off and scrubbed at his face. “Yeah, I'm in Kuwait. It's fine, I'm awake enough to talk. What's up?” He scooted into a sitting position.
Tony grinned wide, blatantly ignoring the questions. “I'm thinking of calling it the Mark 69. And it would definitely
Nat just rolled her eyes a bit. “And here I was actually going to get him to eat some breakfast. Thanks, you two.” She patted them both on the head and set about making two mugs of coffee.
He hopped up out of his seat and bounced over, taking the package out of her hands. “They're here! Thanks, Pep!” She tapped her foot, and he grinned. “It's t-shirts. For the press conference.” She raised an eyebrow. “Don't worry, they're safe for prime time. Very tasteful... Well, ok, maybe if you have the taste of a 14 year old girl, but I feel like we might be falling down with that demographic anyway, not enough girls on the team... Hey, Pep, you wanna-”
all that spunk in there with him, making the whole situation slicker and hotter and... “Just gonna fill you up... Make you ride my jock all night, til you're so full of my cum you can't even move...” God, the
! Besides, I don't get viral or bacterial infections anymore.” Steve was sure he was blushing. “No, I... I just... How much of, of last night and all of this, is because I'm, you know,
Of course, he was also clearly going back to his default state of 'lost in thought'. “Yeah, dinner, good, see you then.” The connection cut abruptly, but Steve suspected he'd have to get used to that.
Steve gave as good as he got for a few lovely minutes, then pulled away reluctantly. “We should probably eat while it's still hot. We-” He leaned in and went back to kissing.
Steve cupped Tony's jaw in his hand. “Awake, asleep, or drugged up in medical, I'd rather be with you than apart from you.” He dropped his hand, scooped up his sketchbook and pencil pouch, and headed towards the elevator. “You going to work on those upgrades for Nat's Bites?”
Tony nodded eagerly. “Yeah, sure, that sounds good. And we can watch movies you've already seen, so if we get distracted...”
Tony's eyes raked up and down his body. “God, yes, can you just be just like that for, like, forever?” He bent down to kiss Steve's inner thighs and stomach, licking a little at the latter. Steve shuddered delightfully, and Tony visibly reined himself in. “Wait, no, slight change. Could you bring your knees up toward your shoulders?” Steve did so easily, and Tony just stared for a long moment, then caught Steve's eyes and grinned. “Yes, yes I am memorizing this moment, I don't ever want to forget. God, look at you...” He glanced down long enough to lube himself up and take himself in hand, then went back to gazing into Steve's eyes. “OK, baby, now just stay relaxed, this is gonna be good.” He moved in closer, and pressed his jock- OH! Steve could tell his eyes were as wide as they could go, but the rest of him went perfectly limp, totally accepting Tony's glorious invasion.
He had just started on the heavy bag when JARVIS interrupted. “Captain Rogers, Ms Potts would like to speak with you, if you are available.”
The current book was open to a quick line drawing he'd made a week or two ago, Tony down in the lab, lecturing Dummy, who was trying to offer him a smoothie. Steve smiled, remembering the moment, then flipped to a new page, already slipping into a more recent memory. He reached out, nearly without looking, grabbed a charcoal pencil, and started sketching. Just the silhouette of Tony, the skyline more of a series of dark bulges behind him... He'd meant it to be a quick study, just enough to get the memory down, but then he kept adding more detail, more nuance...
Steve reminded himself that he had a schedule to keep, and hurried about his ablutions. When he had washed the dust of the road (and at least some of his anxiety) away, he got out of the tub, wrapped a soft towel around his body, and opened the drainage spigot. He resisted the urge to watch all the water drain away so neatly, and instead headed back out to the bedroom. He had barely gotten two steps into the room, however, when he stopped short, staring at the figure on his bed.
Thor was frowning mightily. “Friend Steve, I am happy to support you, but I do not know this term either. Please explain?”
He came back to himself not only draped over Tony, but still balls-deep in him. He groaned and rolled away, and Tony sucked in a deep breath and let it out in an answering groan. Steve tried half-heartedly to sit up, but when he found he couldn't, he was perfectly happy to just lie there and breathe. (And feel the rise and fall of Tony's ribs under his arm.) Eventually, though, he realized how sticky they both were, and levered himself up and out of the bed, to go in the bathroom and get a washcloth.
And so after an understatedly elegant lunch, Tony led him in to a tiny old shop in the Garment District, where they were greeted by a tiny old man in an impeccable suit. “Antonio,
Countess Sarah gave a proper little sniff. “I think you’ll find, my Lord, that our son is stronger than he looks.”
He was just settling into his rhythm on the heavy bag when JARVIS broke in again. “Captain? Sir would like to speak with you.”
Steve had, in fact, taken the time while Tony was processing to finish dressing. “Well, I don't know that I think much of her as a girlfriend if that's the way she reacted. Are you going to finish getting dressed, or are we going downstairs like this? 'Cause I'm pretty sure if Clint sees this, he'll have something to say.” Tony shivered at the thought, and finished putting his jeans on.
Clint was sprawled across the big sofa, wearing Hawkeye pajamas and eating some sort of brightly colored breakfast cereal. There were cartoons playing on the tv, but all of Clint's attention was currently on Steve. “This is actually kind of adorable. You look so nervous. Kinda makes me want to take a ton of embarrassing pictures of the two of you before you go. Ooh, ooh, did you get him a corsage? Or are you expecting him to bring one? Wait, did you even have prom back in the 40s?”
“Hey now.” Steve grabbed his wrist, but held it lightly, just keeping him in place. “Nothing to be ashamed of here.” Tony dropped his eyes, and Steve stepped up close, putting a finger under his chin to lift it up. He gave a soft smile (number 12, I Really Care). “First of all, I knew it was there, you've had it as long as I've known you. Second,” he slid his hand around to cup Tony's cheek. “I think it's beautiful. Not just for itself, not just because it's keeping you alive, but because it came from your mind, and I think you might have the most beautiful mind I've ever known. I-” He broke off, giving Tony a kiss as gentle as the previous ones had been wild. “I don't ever want you to hide it from me.”
still, and just breathe... Tony was clearly impatient, pushing up against his palm, and Steve closed his eyes, refocused, and concentrated on exploring Tony's most private place, learning the shape and the feel of it... When his finger was sliding easily in and out, he withdrew it almost completely, then gently added a second finger. This was tougher, until Steve remembered the lubricant in his other hand. He squeezed out another drop, guiding it with his knuckles, and, OH! His fingers were delving deep, and he could feel every clench and flex of Tony's body, every gasp and whimper as Steve opened him wider and wider...
Tony grinned at them, deliberately showing more teeth than the others would find comfortable. “So very nice to meet you both. And we’re going to be seeing much more of each other. You two will be staying here in Hattan after the wedding. In fact, tonight, after this Bacchanal, I would like you to help me accompany Earl Steven to his temporary quarters, so I can discuss your new roles with you.”
Steve took his cue, twitching his hips up and down in tiny little movements that still managed to feel like he was drilling deep into Tony's body. He went back to running his hands all over Tony's skin, trying his best to make mental notes on what made him gasp or moan or clench so delightfully. It was tough, though, to concentrate, with the way Tony was whimpering and pleading, broken fragments of “fuck, yes” and “your cock's so good”, and Steve bit Tony's shoulder, just to hold off his next orgasm a little longer.
Tony gave him a quick hairy eyeball, but it was mostly for form's sake. He then turned his stare on Clint, who squirmed like a schoolboy, before bursting out. “It's not like it meant anything, right? I mean, all teenage guys fool around with their friends behind the midway, right? I like women!” He shoved way too much rice in his mouth and started choking.
Tony nodded, already thinking about how he could distract Steve. “Yeah, dinner, good, see you then.” He cut the connection, then realized it might have been a bit abrupt... No, he was not going to be the weirdo that called back to apologize for hanging up first (mostly because he was afraid that they would then spend an hour or two playing 'you hang up first', 'no, you hang up first'). He was more mature than all of that, really.
After that, the assistant brought out the trousers and jackets that they had closest to Steve's size, and he was bundled in and out of several of them, then he had to stand still as Marco and the assistant pinned and stitched and snipped over and over. By the time they were done, Marco was beaming like the sun, with a notepage completely full of measurements, the assistant looked like he'd run a race in the middle of summer, Tony positively radiated smugness, and Steve? Well, Steve had three new suits, with shirts, ties, and promises of more to follow, but he felt like he'd been trampled by the Hulk.
Steve smiled reassuringly and knee-walked around to position himself between Tony's calves. Tony's breath left him in a half a laugh, and he let his head hang down. Steve stroked soothing hands up and down his sides. “Good pet, there you go.” Without warning, he took firm hold of both buttocks, wringing a gasp out of Tony, and spread them a bit. He slid his right thumb into Tony's sphincter, garnering a groan, and he growled in response. “Oh, baby, you are so ready for me. That's good, I'm ready for you, too.” He pulled his thumb out and used that hand to grasp his jock and guide it in, trusting to his own pre-cum to be enough lube. Tony was making broken, needy little noises, and twitching his muscles randomly, as if he wanted to react more but didn't dare. Steve just kept pushing in until his hips and thighs were pressing against the bright heat of Tony's bruises. Then he leaned over Tony's back. “Alright, pet. Now I'm going to fuck you until I'm done with you. You can cum if you want, but I'm not going to stop for you.”
Steve sighed happily and fed some broccoli to Tony. “First picture you showed me when I moved in. Of course I'm fond of it.”
Captain's voice was a complicated, thrilling blend of sweetly soothing and darkly possessive. “That's ok, pet, we can find out together.” One hand went back to Tony's hair, and it really was delightfully like being pet like a dog. The other hand scooped up some more cake, and brought it to Tony's lips. “Here, you're going to need the energy.” He opened his mouth, accepting the cake but focusing more on twining his tongue around the fingers. Captain groaned. “Oh, pet, so good...” He pulled his fingers back out, and from the look on his face, he was as turned on by this as Tony himself. He got one more bite, smaller this time, and offered it up again. Tony licked his lips, just to watch Captain lick his in response, then leaned in and wrapped his mouth around Captain's fingers. He gave a short, sharp suck, and grinned (as much as he could) when Captain's whole body twitched hard. “God, pet, you are so damn sexy... Oh, yeah, suck them nice and clean...”
Tony, halfway bent to Steve’s wrist, paused and looked up at him through his lashes. “Well, I might care what you think of me. I’d like to be pleasing in the eyes of my husband.” He nuzzled Steve’s wrist, humming in pleasure at the first whiff. But then he frowned, making a thoughtful noise, and pressed half his face to that vulnerable skin, breathing deep. He pulled away, manner growing colder. “Although, first you might have to explain how you came to be pregnant.”
Steve glared around, as if said dogs would leap out from behind every tree at him. “I just- what is the
I like it...” He sighed, unwanted images flashing through his mind. “The last time I called someone partner, it was for SI, and it was Obie, and the ending of that wasn't exactly one of my favorite days ever, but...” He looked up at Steve, who was watching him earnestly, maybe even with a bit of worry, but so concerned, so caring, so lo- no, there was no way. No matter how much he might want it, Steve would never feel- But Steve cared, in a way he knew now Obie never had. “Yeah, I'd like to make some new memories with the term. Alright, partner.” He stuck his hand out like this was a business deal, and Steve started to shake it, then rolled his eyes and tugged Tony in so they could kiss again. Tony made a happy little noise and melted into the kiss.
Steve couldn’t help the grin that broke out at that idea. “That sounds like an amazing project, Tony, I can’t wait to work on that with you.” They exchanged sappy smiles, and the conversation flowed on through dinner and dessert so easily it might have been oiled.
“Oh, God, yes, fill me, feels so good, please, more, deeper...” Holy crap. Tony knew he could say some dirty things in bed, but this was so much more. He needed so much more... “Please, yes, ok, god, that's good, that's better than good, that's enough...” Steve paused, withdrew a little, and Tony managed to raise his head, and look at his face. He was sure Steve's expression mirrored his, wild with lust and need. He licked suddenly-dry lips. “Enough fingers. I need the real thing. I- ohhhh” Steve drew his fingers out slowly, almost teasingly, as Tony pushed himself upright.
Steve flinched, and when he spoke, his voice was low but urgent, forced out of his throat. “Please don’t reject me. Please, let us at least go through with the marriage-”
Thor gestured broadly from the other armchair. “Indeed, friend Clint, I am always eager to hear your renditions of the tales of Midgard.”
tomorrow, had already known the touch of another Alpha. Had quickened and caught from the other, and Tony should be wanting to rend, to tear, to destroy the interloper and possibly the child as well.
Well, and that took up plenty of his attention, so it was ok. Up until this whole “Avengers” thing, Tony had always said he wasn't a team player. Even now, he had no interest in going along with the board of SI or anything crazy like that, but he was slowly learning that it was possible for a loose cannon like himself to work with a team, maybe even long term, without someone poisoning the coffee. In fact, he found he was doing better work with other minds to collaborate with, and (though he hated to admit it) people to drag him away from the lab sometimes, to do other things with his brain. And if a little too often, the other things his brain did involved, say, Steve and naked Jello wrestling, well, it was only in his head, and nothing showed on the outside. He totally had a handle on all this, he was making all this work, it was a delicate balance, but still good.
When the meal was finished and the dishes cleared away, they trooped into the living room. Tony steered Steve into the smaller couch, then snuggled up to his side. “Alright, Brucie-bear, I know I gave you movie privileges this week, what've you got for us?”
Steve sank onto a footstool. “I- I wasn’t even sure I could.” He gasped and darted a glance at Tony. “I probably shouldn’t have said- My father wants this alliance…” He sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face. “My last heat was a month and a half ago. Th- they’ve never been terribly regular, one of the reasons the medickers thought that- Anyway, I, I have this friend, he helps me through my heats, but then when it didn’t come a fortnight ago, I thought it was just skipping the month, it never occurred to me- Wait. How has no one else smelled this on me?”
Steve's hand tensed on Tony's hip, fingers digging in a little. “Now, why do I think that isn't exactly the truth?”
would know it was a date, and so would the people waiting up at home to razz them about it later, and nobody would get pulled up in front of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, and holy crap, he was going on a date with
JARVIS apparently could answer for himself. “Sir’s scans are perfectly normal, except that his bio-signs end at the tarsals, and I have no current data on the metatarsals or their accompanying flesh. I do however have indicators that Sir is transporting ten small pieces of carbonate crystals, most likely marble.”
Tony was moving before he even stopped nodding, getting plates and forks onto the table just as Thor bounded into the room. Moments later, Clint wandered in and headed directly for the pan of bacon; Steve didn't even glance over as he smacked his knuckles, and Clint withdrew to the coffeepot, pouting. Somehow, Nat was already there, pouring cups for her and Bruce. Clint pouted harder, but wisely waited his turn.
Tony felt warmth flood him, but also worry. “I, ah. Well, I'm gonna go down there. You don't have to. You-”
Tony woke up slowly, a little confused as to why the emptiness of his bed made him upset. Then he rolled over, and smelled Steve's pillow, and remembered one of the best weeks of his life, and that he had an actual date today. Not that he could be nearly as PDA as he wanted to be, not after this week of having their hands all over each other whenever they were home. He spent a moment cursing the newfound sense of maturity and propriety that had him keeping the relationship... quiet. Subtle. He was Tony Stark, he didn't
JARVIS hesitated, just long enough for Pepper to notice. “I believe his health to be excellent, Ms Potts. As to the other, well, I'm not sure I should say. I'm given to believe that it's rude.”
Pepper was a fair bit more worried than she let on. That was some seriously weird behavior from a man who was
Steve sat up and grinned. “I definitely like this plan. Show me more of this rich man's life you lead.”
Steve grinned at him. “I dunno. I think I might need lots and lots of practice, to be sure I'm getting it right...”
And of course the others weren't far behind. Nat's reply was very Russian. “Might as well, it's not like the fanboys can objectify me more, right?”
Steve could always tell what sort of a day Tony had had, just by the tone of his voice as he came up the stairs. Good days, he would be joking and teasing Bruce, or expounding on some new area of research, or singing songs that were on the radio when Steve was in the ice. (He'd heard plenty of those songs' original versions, too, of course, but in almost every case he preferred Tony's 'cover' of it. Now that he thought about it, that was probably another clue...) Bad days, he would be ranting, sounding off on topics that might or might not have any sort of relation to the reason for his bad mood. But either way, he would come around the corner, and Steve would already be looking over, and their eyes would meet, and Steve could feel his spirits lift, no matter what sort of day he had had.
Tony realized that his plate was empty, and that the others were standing, clearing the table, and moving toward the living room couches. He hurriedly pushed himself up and joined them. “So, whose turn is it to choose the movies? I know it was Thor last week, because we saw Star Wars. Again.”
, right through the hologram and into Tony's personal space. “I think you're going to have to tell me
Once again, the first thing he was aware of was Tony's weight (and the arc reactor) on his chest. He brought up one shaky hand, to tangle in Tony's hair, and Tony made a contented noise. “Sooooo many plans for you, Cap, God.” He made as if to push himself up, then flopped bonelessly back down onto Steve's chest. “Well, if I survive you. I think you might be trying to kill me with your sexiness.” He nuzzled his cheek against Steve's pectoral. “Mmm, but, oh, what a way to go...”
about it. “I. It's... It's not like either of us have a problem with nudity. And I assume if we were doing things JARVIS didn't want to know about, he wouldn't actually have to pay attention to us. I just... I... Should it be weird?” Flustered, he reached for the food, and ended up taking a big bite of the waffle. Oh, that was awful good...
Tony waved him off. “We're going to be going to all sorts of galas for SI over the holidays, I can't have you looking less than your best. Still not as big as a vehicle, just let the man measure you.” Steve hesitantly obeyed, holding out his arms this way and that while Marco measured
“Wha-?” Steve's head jerked up and around, and he caught sight of the shiny red cock jutting out of the hologram in front of Tony. He instantly turned bright red himself. “I- Oh, my God, Tony, did you really-?” His sweatpants were definitely developing a suspicious bulge. “Wait, fantasies involving me? From before you met me?” He squirmed, caught between emotions.
Tony rolled over just enough to look at him. “Need? Maybe, maybe not. Want? Like you wouldn't believe!” He grinned ingratiatingly.
He felt it building, one last, glorious moment, but his artwork was not quite complete. He curled down to murmur into Tony's ear. “
When they had eaten everything in sight, Tony cleaned the bed by the simple expedient of dumping all the trash in the insulated bag, and tossing the bag in the direction of the door, then rolled onto his stomach and reached over the side of the bed to open The Drawer. He glanced over his shoulder. “So, I was thinking, easiest way to do this, give you a selection, right?” Steve was a little surprised at the abruptness, until he realized Tony had probably been thinking about this the whole time they ate. Tony's hand dipped down, then brought something up to lay beside him on the mattress, over and over. Steve automatically identified them (or tried to) as they came up: a cane, a paddle, something he thought might be a riding crop, a short whip, a thing like like the whip but with many tails...
Tony shook his head one more time at the putative sculpture, then turned away too. “Screw it, we want weird, we'll get really weird. Let's go check out the surrealists. You get a chance to see Dali's stuff back in the day?” They headed to the part of the permanent collection that had the DADAists and their conceptual offspring, and spent a pleasant hour lost amongst lobster telephones and men with apples for heads, until the closing announcements rang over the PA.
- calluses...) slid into him, all the way to the knuckle in one smooth move. Steve cried out, mostly in surprise, and tried very hard not to clench hard enough to break Tony's finger. He knew those muscles were fluttering anyway. “Ohh, fuck, Tony, that's amazing. God, I-” He panted, adjusting to this whole new world of sensation. “I, yes, go...” Fortunately, Tony  interpreted  that correctly, and started to move the finger, shallow thrusts in and out, twists back and forth... Steve became aware that he was making a low noise somewhere between a groan and a whine, and clenching his thighs rhythmically. “More, I, I'm good for more...”
“Tony!” Steve sat bolt upright, staring at him. “Tony, it's ok, you're home, you're safe, it was just a dream, breathe, Tony, breathe!” Tony realized he was panting, his breaths shallow and shaky. He blinked a few times and ran a hand through his hair as he tried to get his bearings. “There you go, baby, you're ok now.” Steve gave him Smile Number 15, I'm Here For You, and laid his hand gently on Tony's knee.
Clint, not far behind, still had to be his obnoxious-younger-brother self. “Holy shit, they are! Look how smug you both are!” He glared at Steve. “Stop it! Stop making that face! Captain America should not have 'I just had fantastic sex' face!”
Steve slithered down to his knees, letting Tony's ass rest on the bed, and pulled back enough to fumble Tony's fly open. Tony hitched up his hips just enough to get pants and boxer briefs down to his thighs, and Steve pulled them the rest of the way off. When Steve went to lean back in, Tony put a hand on his shoulder, and Steve looked up at him through his eyelashes. “Wait, wait. Gotta breathe a little.” They were both panting, really. “Damn, that's hot. Also, couple suggestions, just to get you started. First off, don't be afraid to use your hand, too. You can grip the shaft-” Steve's hand rose automatically to wrap around Tony's jock. “-Ah, oh, yeah, like that, and then you can use your mouth mostly on the head, if you're more comfortable with...” Steve stroked up and down a bit, idly, exploring the feel of Tony's jock, so similar and yet so different to his own, and enjoying the look of sheer lust on Tony's face. “Gah, you are
One of the Serum's side effects was that Steve didn't sleep much anymore, which was pretty useful in helping him adjust to this new, bright, fast future. He could spend hours watching musicals from the 50s, candy-colored and absurdly optimistic, or wandering through the rabbit warren of Wikipedia. He had spent whole weekends with one teammate or another, 'marathoning' seasons of their favorite tv shows. So, when not just his daytime thoughts, but his right-before-bed thoughts, and his first-thing-in-the-morning thoughts, and every single thought he
think so. Most other people treat him like a glorified smartphone. I-” He took a too-big bite of waffle and then tried to talk around it. “I's onna the thin's I like 'bout you.” He swallowed too fast and had to cough a couple times, then looked at Steve out of the corner of his eye. “So then you know that he's kind of been watching us this whole time...”
There was a friendly chuckle from overhead. “I thought that neither you nor Captain Rogers would want to take the time to cook this... afternoon, so I did take the liberty. I hope Sir is not put out?”
Almost before the picture was over, Tony was jumping up and running away upstairs. Steve made himself stay a few minutes, say good night to everyone, even straighten the sofa pillows... And now he was stalling. He told himself that if he went up and Tony was already in bed, he wouldn't bother him, but he wasn't sure that wasn't a lie. He moved with the quiet speed he still blessed the Serum for giving him, but when he caught sight of Tony, standing at the window, framed by the city lights, he froze in place, hardly able to breathe with the beauty of the moment. He could feel himself memorizing every detail, vowing to get it down on paper as soon as he could, no matter what the next few minutes brought.
Tony shrugged a little. “Nobody wants to deal with my misery, didn't figure you'd be any different.” He curled in on himself, away from the warmth and comfort he didn't dare let himself get used to. “Really, I was just going to go back to sleep, you should do the same.”
started in the background, Steve settled Tony onto the couch and knelt between his legs, hands finding their natural place on Tony's hips. “So I'm pretty sure you promised me another class in 'blow jobs'. I figured now was a good time.” Before Tony could put together a sentence, Steve was wrapping his lips around Tony's mostly-soft cock. To his utter surprise, Tony felt it twitch, stir, and start to fill.
Bruce shrugged a little, careful not to spill his tea as he settled into an armchair. “This time next week, there'll be a media circus. I figured we wanted something feel-good, so, Robin Williams. JARVIS, if you would,
Steve shifted to stroking his head. “Thank you for telling me that, pet. I can tell how hard it was for you.” He pulled Tony close, til their whole torsos were flush, and all but whispered in his ear. “I'm honored that you trust me so much. I promise I won't betray that.” The sincerity in his voice shot a thrill up and down Tony's spine that was like grabbing a 220 wire bare-handed, and Tony groaned and tried to press even closer to Steve. “So we'll start with some safety, hmm? I thought, for now, we'll use basic safewords, and then later if we want to change them, we can.” A new wave of emotion washed over him, mostly gratitude, relief, lo-fondness... He nodded. “Good, so. If you need to pause, or you need me to change something, you say 'yellow.' And if you need to stop, say 'red,' and we'll stop and talk it out, ok?”
Clint, Steve, and Thor all exclaimed and crowded close, but Strange stayed back, wiggling his fingers in arcane (Tony assumed) gestures. Tony raised an eyebrow at him, and his drew together in response. Well, that wasn’t good. Strange nodded ponderously. “I’m sad to say, it’s definitely a curse, and very likely to get worse. Nothing is jumping out at me here regarding ways to remove it, unfortunately. I’ll have to research it further. Where did you say you acquired it?”
Steve's hands shifted. It took Tony a moment to notice, but those hands were definitely drifting downward. They settled on his ass, and Tony threw back his head and moaned aloud. His hips jerked forward, and he realized how incredibly, painfully hard he was. Then, oh god then, he realized Steve was just as hard, the bulge threatening to split his jeans. He whimpered and rubbed their erections together, the fabric between them little more than a nuisance. Steve groaned into his mouth.
subtle... Except apparently when it came to two of the highest-profile men in the country, if not the world, dating each other. Dammit.
Steve burst out laughing. “Yes, because when I think of Tony Stark, I think laid back. Wouldn't want to break that illusion.” He leaned up and kissed Tony. “So, Bucky always told me, if they let you stay the night, make breakfast for 'em the next day. You want breakfast?”
Strange shrugged. “What is the solution to all such curses? True love’s kiss. But you are not a man known for giving his heart away.”
He wasn't entirely sure what to do with the riding crop, (and he wanted to keep changing things up, keep Tony guessing) so he spent his dozen strokes playing around, hitting with the length of it, or just the end, hard here, soft there... At the end, he didn't have much of a better feel for it than when he started, and Tony seemed to feel about the same. (Honestly, how could he
Steve heard Bruce in the elevator before it got to their floor. He was growling and muttering, and Steve had a moment to wish the Shield wasn't upstairs and out of reach before the doors opened and Bruce stomped out. He was barely holding it together, flushed green and eyes narrowed, but the sight of the team greeting him cheerfully and the smell of the food seemed to calm him a little. He shrugged apologetically. “I, ah... I forgot how bad Manhattan at rush hour can be. I'll be ok.”
Tony's answering grin was wide, and his body possibly even more boneless, but he squirmed in pleasure anyway. After a moment, he rallied and wriggled over to the edge of the bed, dragging his jock across Steve's thighs. “Not only did I like it a whole Hell of a lot, but...” Steve heard the click of a lock disengaging, then the hiss of hydraulics. Curious, he flopped over onto his stomach to look. Tony waved an arm. “I have toys.” From under the bed was emerging a thing like a trundle bed, but instead of a mattress, there was a thin foam pad, and laid out on it was an assortment of whips, paddles, canes, handcuffs, and things Steve didn't have names for. He shot a raised eyebrow at Tony, who looked almost embarrassed. “I, ah, actually forgot about this earlier, you were just that distracting. But I'm kinda hoping you want to try out some of these on me sometime.”
Tony beamed at him. “Moved in less than ten minutes and already ordering the robot butler around. I'll make a rich man of you yet.” He leaned over and took a bite from the egg roll still in Steve's hand, and they spent most of the picture feeding each other bites from their chopsticks, then, later, from their fingers... and directly from one set of lips to the other. Steve was amazed to find that something could be both romantic and deeply erotic at the same time.
“Shh, shh...” Steve shifted them, lying more on his back and letting Tony rest the back of his head on Steve's bicep. “Better?” Tony gulped air a bit. “There you go, just breathe.” His pinned arm cradled Tony's side without holding him down.
He shook his head. “It’s definitely a curse, but even Mr Dr Sorcerer Supreme can’t do anything about it. Time to start talking about where you’re going to display statue-me.”
.” As the narration crawl started, he tangled his fingers in Steve's hair and tugged him closer. “I feel like I was supposed to be giving you instruction there, but for the life of me I can't figure out what.” As soon as Steve was close enough, Tony kissed him deeply, savoring the taste of himself in Steve's mouth. “Seriously. Wow.”
Steve kissed him again, then pulled back, eyes twinkling. “I would love to move in with you, if you actually meant it. I- I would be honored.” His smile softened for a minute, then turned wicked. “But I'm not going to make you breakfast every single morning. Just because we're living together doesn't mean I'm a good little housewife.”
noon or just after. He shook his head. “Wow, this is some different way to live. Sleeping til noon, eating take out all the time...” Which of course redirected his attention to the food. And there was a lot of it. One container of just bacon, another of just sausage,
The young Alpha was lounging back, hands behind his head and ankles crossed, in clothes more suited to a Palace gala than a stranger’s bedchamber. When he caught sight of Steve, he swung up and around to sit at the edge of the bed. “Hello, there, Earl Steven. Well, you’re prettier than your portrait.”
He flinched a little. Oh, no, was she sore? Had he broken some code by not asking her first? Stall for time, Rogers!  “Excuse me?”
Tony was relaxed, open, joking. “Don't worry, I'm clean. I get tested every six months. Safety first!”
The gym's screen-wall lit up. “Hey, babe. Ooh, sweaty. My favorite!” Tony grinned at him, and Steve grinned back. Tony pointed over Steve's shoulder. “And Barton. Don't make those vomit faces unless you want to vomit for a week. Hey Nat.” He waved a little, then refocused on Steve. “Anyway, MoMA's got this retrospective on Rothko right now, I was thinking, tomorrow, early lunch, all afternoon looking at art that will either bore us to tears or make us think crazy deep thoughts, late dinner? No fancy clothes required!” He waggled his eyebrows.
Steve gave a little laugh with no humor and hugged him close. “I'd rather you woke me up than suffered alone. Do you want to talk about it?”
“This!” Tony stuck his foot out toward Bruce and waved it around. “This is me trying to wiggle my toes, by the way, which you may note is not happening. None of my toes will move, Bruce!” He wobbled and grabbed for a lab table to steady himself.
JARVIS made the tiny 'ping' that was his equivalent of clearing one's throat. “If I may, Captain? Dr Banner has in fact made it to Manhattan. If current traffic patterns hold, he should be here in ten to fifteen minutes.”
Next he tried suckling on the whole head, and Tony's hand immediately tangled in his hair, seeming to need the grip. “Oh, fuck, Steve, that is so fucking good, how the hell are you this good at-” He lapped at the slit again, without releasing the suction, and Tony tried to buck up again. Steve settled his other hand on Tony's hip, holding him in place properly, and Tony shuddered and went totally limp.
Tony smirked as he leaned against the counter, hands cradling his coffee. “Don't worry, I'm clean. I get tested every six months. Safety first!”
They were in the bedroom now, and wearing far too many clothes. Steve needed to touch Tony, taste his skin... take his own shirt off? Why was Tony pulling away? Was he...
When it came time to choose pictures, Steve brought up Robin Hood because he knew the basic story. There would be variations, of course, but he would know the characters, and the general plot, and he wouldn't have to pay too much attention. When the team settled in, and he was left alone on the sofa with Tony, he took it as a positive sign. He put just enough of his awareness on the picture that he could react right, and let the rest of his body tune itself to Tony. Now it was obvious that Tony was focusing on him. He wasn't even trying to hide it, his face turned away from the screen and toward Steve. He was just close enough that Steve could feel the heat of his body and the buzz of the arc reactor, and Steve wanted, possibly more than he'd ever wanted anything, to drape his arm over Tony's shoulders and pull him closer, to hold him tight...
him, and so he focused on leaving a major love bite in the space between the collarbone and the arc reactor. The helpless, breathless little moans of pleasure falling from Tony's lips, and the needy little hitches of his hips, made him feel so powerful that it bubbled up in a growl. Tony shivered all over.
. Of course, then he lurched up again, and lurched back down onto his freshly-reawakened bruises, yelped, and jolted up once more, and all of that hurt plenty. Steve, the bastard, moved with him easily, and chuckled against his cock, which just felt unreasonably good, and Tony's mind was starting to fuzz out a little around the edges.
Tony nodded. “I would rather this marriage were not a prison sentence for either of us. Steve has said you are his only two friends in all the world, and I would not take that from him if I can avoid it.”
Tony kissed him back, and gave a slightly more realistic smile. “So, on the same topic but maybe a happier note, I was thinking, within the family, and then whenever we're, you know, actually outed as a couple, since we both know it's gonna be me just kissing you in the park sometime or something, anyway, um... What do we call ourselves? Boyfriends? Partners? I guess, not that we have to decide now, but...” Damnit, now he was feeling all vulnerable and exposed again! This wasn't
Fortunately, before Clint could say anything further, Tony swept down the stairs. “I'm here, I'm here, sorry, there was just this idea I needed to jo... oh.” Steve had turned to look at him, and apparently just that was enough to make Tony forget what he was saying. He was standing on the bottom step, his mouth hanging open slightly and his eyes roving hungrily over every inch of Steve's form. Of course, Steve was doing the same right back. Tony's slacks and jacket were charcoal grey, and tailored close to his body, and his shirt was carnelian, the deep red bringing out the tint of his lips and a fire in his eyes.
It took a moment or two for Tony to get his breathing under control, and another before he shook his head, sharply, as if trying to clear his ears. “Mm, yeah. No, thank you.” His hips gave an unhappy little twitch, and Steve used his right hand to stroke up and down Tony's thighs and ass, soothing him like a nervous animal. When he relaxed, just that little bit, Steve took his hands away and picked up the paddle. He did the same set of smacks, one-two, one-two, one at medium strength, one a little harder, and one with real intent. By the time he started the third set, Tony was gasping and whimpering, and before he'd finished, he was already nodding. “Yes, please, more, harder, please, Captain!”
You'll have to pardon me, this is my first story posted to this site, I may have some minor formatting and whatnot issues as I get used to it. I'm glad to see there are already bookmarks and kudos, they make my muse very happy. She's got lots brewing, so stick around.
But mostly he was pleased. He could tell himself that it was gladness that his bridegroom would not be a shy, retiring flower in the marriage bed, and it was true enough. Underneath, however, was anticipation at having a family of his own. This babe might not be his by blood, but he would claim it as such, and raise it with as much love and care as he possibly could. (Granted, he worried sometimes that he had little love to share, having received so little in his own childhood, but that fear only ever renewed his vow to be a better parent than his own had been.)
, it was somehow even harder to grasp than the part where they were fucking like bunnies in spring, Captain America actually wanted to date
Tony burst out laughing. “That is a filthy, disgusting lie, I know for a fact you yourself were talking back to anyone and everyone, you were a mouthy little brat, my dad said so in his journals.” Steve blatantly over-acted a 'poor, innocent me' pout, complete with wide eyes and fluttering eyelashes, but he couldn't maintain it, and within moments he was laughing too. Tony leaned back and took a sip of his soda. “So, you were bitching -heh- about yappy little handbag dogs.”
Captain's left hand grabbed him by both wrists at once, at the same moment that his right hand came down across both ass cheeks. “No more thinking.” His wrists were pulled out, until he had to balance on his elbows instead, and then Captain's palm stilled over the wrists, pinning them in place. Captain's other hand smoothed over his ass and thighs. Tony shivered, and relaxed as best he could. “There you go, that's better.” Captain gave him one light smack on each ass cheek, and Tony twitched, working to convince his reflexes not to jump up and fight back. “Oh, you are going to have so many gorgeous bruises... All this tender skin...” The next smacks were harder, but not by much, and he moaned as sensation flooded through him, actually starting to understand the appeal of this part. “Alright, pet. Now, first and foremost, this is to see how much you can take, and what sorts of things you like, so I may just keep going until you yellow. Are you ok with that?”
Steve regathered his composure. “Yes, please.” He paused to run his hands up Tony's thighs, his stomach and chest, then down his arms. “God, you're so beautiful... Oh, right. Is there, um, anything in particular that you really
His entire jock was inside Tony now, and Tony's head was falling back, the olive column of his throat lit that perfect blue by the arc reactor. Tony writhed, and Steve yelped, and grabbed the nearest solid object, which turned out to be Tony's hips. Ooh, that was good too, all that wiry muscle... Tony looked down at him in concern. “OK? Are you? Is this?”
Steve sighed, and tried not to squirm as much as he wanted to. “Yeah, and then I was in a war, and then nearly everyone assumed I was dead for a few decades, and then I was living in SHIELD barracks... Not all of us have the urge for
Of course, being bitten just made Tony make a keen of pure pleasure, almost a shriek of surprise, and even if Steve hadn't been close, he was pretty sure that noise would have driven him to orgasm anyway. His hips snapped up, lifting them both off the sofa, as his world whited out. When he came back to himself a little, he realized he was licking the swiftly-forming tooth-shaped hickey in front of him. He shifted to nuzzling the back of Tony's head, inhaling the scent of shampoo and sweat and
Steve was content to let Tony steer him up the stairs and into the bedroom, where he leaned in the doorway and watched Tony bustle around, shifting armloads of fabric from drawer to drawer until a whole column was empty and standing slightly open. In the midst of it, Tony glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. “I really do want to get you more clothes, you know, nice clothes. You've got an amazing body, you should be showing it off more. And I can clear out more space for you whenever you need it.” He moved on to shifting things around on the top of the dresser.
And he opened his mouth, letting a lifetime's worth of dirty talk fall free, letting forth the predator that lived under his skin. “Oh, yes, pet, God, you sound so beautiful. Oh, you love this, don't you, you're so eager for it, just look at you writhing, look at how red your ass is getting for me, oh, you're going to have the most beautiful bruises, and I'm going to fuck you later, just dig my thumbs into these bruises til you cry out just like you are now, God, look how much you can take, I had no idea...” His jock was hard again, positively
Bruce couldn’t explain it any better than Tony or JARVIS could, and in the end they had to call Dr Strange for a medical-magical consultation. He arrived, in his usual showy way, through a portal, directly into the Avengers’ living room, startling the team.
Tony grinned at him, lo mein hanging from the corner of his mouth, then slurped it up. “Yeah, me too. Though if the rest of the team is around, we probably want to have pants on. That whole 'naked Thor' thing. Though if Nat wanted to...”
He was startled into laughter. “Well, you know, now that you mention it...” He gave Steve a quick Elevator Look. “But I did want to say... So, I know I promised you nice suits and a classy meal, but I was hoping you didn't want that
Steve grinned back unabashedly. “Absolutely. I coulda spent all weekend in there.” He paused, reflecting. “Though... um, was it just me, or did there seem to be some weird sorta
Thor raised his mug. “It is well. We will spread the superior way of Asgard to all of Midgard with our example!” He thumped his mug on the table hard enough to make the plates jump. Tony suddenly wondered what exactly he'd gotten himself into.
Tony's eyes lit up with mischief. “So if I get you to move in here, does that mean you'll make me breakfast every day?” Steve's heart flared with hope, but Tony froze, looking horrified at himself. “Um. I, ah, don't have to have said that. If, ah. I mean, I know we're probably already moving awfully fast for you, we haven't even had a real date, we can take this at your pace-”
Nat thumped him on the back, and shot Tony a mild glare. He gave her a little eyebrow shrug and plowed on. “Alright, we'll call that two ally shirts. No, really, this is excellent. Avengers Against Biphobia? Avengers Assemble for Queer Rights? Help me out, Nat, you're good at this stuff.”
Steve needed to touch him, to be fully honest, to look him in the eye and see if there was the possibility... “I would be happy to brag about you to whoever. I'm more than willing to tell people. What do
Tony practically purred. “Aww, Brucie! Checking in so Mom and Dad don't worry! You're adorable!” Bruce was turning a little red, but he was also smiling a little wider, so Steve let it go. “So, Bruce, did you have good science this weekend?”
art if it was only referencing other art, and not reflecting on the human condition. Steve found himself gesturing emphatically at a piece that seemed to be nothing more than a haphazard tower of broken furniture and discarded toys. “This! This isn't art! It isn't
Tony was already starting to float away a little. The burn of being stretched wide was the same high-proof mix of pleasure and pain and just plain
Steve was caught for a moment by the realization that yes, he'd gone off twice, and the results of both were still rather acting as lubricant. Then his brain caught up to Tony's question, and he burst out in a blush. “Been forever, technically. I've never- never before-”
Tony ushered the three Brooklynnites into the guest suite, and shut the door behind them. “Alright, let’s get the big issue out of the way first. Barnes, have you had a chance lately to scent Steve?”
Y'all should also know that I originally planned to be posting the sequel today (Musie hasn't been as cooperative as I'd like), but there are at least two more chapters to this before I can even talk about the sequel, and probably four or five in total before this part of the story is done. (The Christmas story was meant to be a one-shot, but it maaaay turn into a chaptered. I'm... not good at short stories.) And there is definitely a third part, after the Christmas story, which involved plans and endgames and fun stuff like that. So stick around, it's gonna be a wild ride!
Steve blinked a couple of times. “Huh. I guess I haven’t looked into any of that. I’ll have to try it out. Do you know if any of them are any good?” He took a couple more hearty bites of his food.
Tony didn't even have to think. “Might as well have it brought here. We can take it the rest of the way.” He stood in front of Steve and held out his hand. “After all, we have a tradition to properly establish.”
Steve shook his head. “You are never going to be a normal person, and you'd be far less interesting if you were. I'm just trying to get enough fuel in you to keep that beautiful brain of yours running properly.”
Pepper was an awful scary lady when she wanted to be. He outright shivered. “I, ah. Wow, that's a pretty effective threat.” But she was worried about Tony, and that was pretty dang sweet. He decided to keep on with his recent policy of honesty. “Don't worry, though. If I have my way, his heart will never get broken again. Though if he keeps on like this, we're gonna have our photo in the papers before we can make any announcements. Not that I mind, he's just so excited for the big reveal...” He couldn't help a fond sigh, not-quite-regretting Tony's impulsive nature.
Steve looked outraged. “What, so to reassure me, you bring up your ex? I can't believe you would-” Without warning, he pounced, covering Tony's body with his own and kissing him like they were the only two people in the world. They started to rub up against each other, but then Steve's stomach rumbled, and he pulled back and sat up. “Much as, God, I would
