He’s at fourteen when that one slides shut, enjoying the sight of Dean scrambling frantically back across the room.
“Ye—ye—
“I do believe that’s my cue, before you further traumatize my virgin ears.”
Dean can’t say how long has gone by but after a time he finds his breathing is regular, if shaky, and Sam gives him a very small smile.  His words could be condescending, but they’re not, and Dean finds himself searching warily for pity in his eyes and instead finding compassion, edged with a terrible, knowing sadness.  “There.  That’s better, isn’t it?  No, don’t say anything, just keep breathing with me.”
Instead, he devotes the first five minutes or so to some serious sulking.  His ass is on fire, he’s got what feels like the biggest buttplug they own buried to the hilt inside him, and his saliva is soaking through the tattered remnants of what
there.  I'm pretty new and I need followers!  I'm nice and, I like to think, reasonably amusing.  I'm also always accepting prompts and love to hear from my readers via asks or PMs.
and who was Dean to deny him a moment of joy?
“What does that have to do with the metric system?” Dean demanded, pretty sure that if he really let Cas get going, it could be hours before he came around to a point, and it was way the hell too early in the morning for all that.
Another hand grabbed Dean’s elbow and jerked sharply, pulling his hand away.  Dean pivoted to face Sam, offended.
Dean makes no sound.  He has not so much as twitched since Castiel walked into the clearing.  There is a sort of blankness to the silence from his direction that worries Castiel more than suppressed rage or even grief might.  He wants nothing more than to go to Dean, but instead, he waits, and he counts, and it is not until seven long minutes have passed that he finally comes to his feet and turns to the prisoner.  Dean’s eyes are open but distant, and Castiel has to swallow past a lump in his throat.
The shudder that goes through Dean at the mental picture is more satisfying than Cas could begin to put into words.  When Dean turns to leave the bedroom, Cas lays a single, very solid smack directly across the spot he knows the base of the plug to be.  Dean groans, his head falling back on his neck as he goes up onto his toes, and Cas takes a moment to thank whatever deities might be listening for giving him such a gorgeously responsive man for his very own.
“A butthead,” he declares definitively, “you don’t have to be a butthead.”
Cas effortlessly scoops him off his feet altogether and then they are striding through the hallways with Dean cradled against his chest.  It’s a familiar position, in the wake of an intense scene, and a welcome one.  That one creature can be so relentlessly brutal, so wickedly sadistic, and yet also so gentle, so tender—it should be a contradiction.  Somehow, it’s not; it’s simply two equally beloved sides of Dean’s beloved.
“Mr. Novak, no!” Dean cried with impressive passion, putting his distaste for the idea in his words, along with a hint of panic, “Sir, I have practice today.  I have a game tomorrow.  I can’t miss it, if you make me write 500 lines I’ll be here for
Dean felt like a heel.  His body, which had been hanging onto a fair amount of tension (you try being super relaxed with a knee in your stomach and your ass being set ablaze), went limp over the angel’s knee.  Cas wasn’t being a jerk when he banned Dean from seeing to Sam, he was trying to take care of him.  The way he always did.
“And,” Cas continues as if Dean hadn’t spoken, “particularly after a good spanking, naughty boys need time to think about what they’ve done, and how they are expected to behave in the future.”
In which Christmas morning has nothing on this.
the purr of a different sort of predator than the one Dean was used to hearing.  This was entirely ‘Mr. Novak,’ and Dean thought he most assuredly wouldn’t mind getting to know Mr. Novak a little better, “I cannot deny that you took the latter portion of your punishment a great deal more…maturely than the first half.”
Making a sound halfway between a plea and a grumble, Dean settled his ass back onto the hood, and a moment later the pair of fingers returned.  Dean made a low sound of enjoyment as they grazed feather-light across his prostate before beginning a leisurely slide in and out.
“Have the best relationship we can, including our sex life.  I know, Sammy.”
“Tell me why you are being punished, Dean.  Now.”
And just like that, the fingers were gone, and the twenty-third stroke fell on the underside of Dean’s ass.
Cas was again draped over Dean’s back, cock still buried to the hilt in him, which meant that the laughter that shook both of them was having interesting effects on Dean’s prostate.  Nevertheless, Dean was pretty sure if the hysterics kept up much longer, sheer lack of air would start to have a negative impact on both of their erections.
“You know you could have just said ‘okay,’ babe, and I would’ve believed you.”
“Ten feet of snow,” the angel observes.  “You dropped ten feet of snow on my head.”  There’s a moment in which the only sound is Dean’s harsh breathing against Cas’s silencing hand.  “What is my favorite number, Dean?” He snaps suddenly, releasing Dean’s mouth.
“You know those gloves you got last winter that are smartphone compatible?  I cut the tip off one of the fingers.  You should be able to use this to control the phone.  It’s bigger than your hands, so it should register.  You might have to put your back into it a little, but I’m pretty sure it’ll work.”
Dean stares at him in total bewilderment, still choking to death on perfectly good air, and Sam speaks again, voice low and soothing.
Unsurprisingly, Sam nodded enthusiastically and passed his plate over to Dean, who took a moment to be grateful that the cleaning supplies were kept in a small closet just down the hall from the library and not in the kitchen.  Cas, who had apparently opted to keep his own counsel, headed for the hallway while Dean hurried into the kitchen.  He dished out the seconds hastily, figuring he should make sure he got his ass back out into the library before Cas had a chance to make an excuse to Sam about some needed supply not being in the closet and corner him in here.  He made it back to the library what seemed to be just in time, because Cas snapped his mouth shut with the hint of a scowl when Dean appeared in the doorway.  Sam’s attention immediately zeroed in on his refilled plate, which Dean plopped in front of him before setting his own plate on the table, dropping back into his seat, and grabbing his fork.
“Look, we can give it a try and if it’s not fun, we move on to something else, no harm done.
As Cas opened his mouth, no doubt to start telling Dean about the floor plan he’d already drawn up for Curtis’s dream home, Dean strode across the kitchen and flattened Curtis with one heavy boot.
There’s a brief pause, in which Dean again wishes that he could somehow hook into Cas’s ability to converse with pretty much anything alive.  “Of course,” Cas says, a slight smile in his voice, “and you will certainly be the first to know about any progress that we make.  But for the moment, might I request that you consider going to find yourself something to eat?  Dean and I have a matter to attend to for which he would prefer privacy.”
“It doesn’t really
This time, Dean registered the sound of the door clicking shut and the footsteps retreating.
“Yep.  Could be awhile, too.  We’re looking at over a week of subzero temperatures, and it’s not like anybody’s gonna be bringing a snowplow to clear out the doorway.”
“Crystal clear,” Dean told him, slightly less grouchily, “I’m okay, babe, just being a grump.”
actually kind of on board with it.  This was sounding a hell of a lot more promising than 500 fucking lines, anyway.  There was a hint of something in Cas’s expression that said he, Cas, the real Cas, was asking him, Dean, the real Dean, whether he was still on board.  Dean gave him the tiniest hint of a nod, and Cas dropped back into character completely.  “You may change your mind at any time, but if you do, you will write 500 lines before leaving today, and every day this week.  If you refuse to comply, I will not hesitate to fail you.”
Solid to the air I breathe,
Cas blinked at him, jaw dropping open half an inch in shock.  Dean sort of thought about starting to keep a tally of how many times he shocked the angel today, but instead chose to go on.
“That seems prudent.  We will clean up the books when we are finished.”
“Snowball fights, then?”
of snow that day, he could expect a hell of a lot worse than that little impromptu spanking.
Dean’s mouth opened without his permission, and half a second later Cas’s cock was pressing past his lips.
Okay, he could get on board with this plan.  This sounded like a good plan.
Dean would be grateful later that he’d immediately engaged the safety on his gun when he discovered no real threat in the library, because both weapons clattered from his numb fingers to the floor as he whirled on his heels.
“…yes?” Cas said, looking uncertain as to why this might have been a poor idea
“Nah, that always seemed pointless to me.  Second place is just the first loser, after all.”  That was a thing John Winchester had said more than once, but in this case it seemed appropriate, and Sam appeared to buy it, shrugging and nodding.  Cas, of course, was totally on board with calling it a day on the game.
Dean, nothing daunted, took a few steps closer to the bed and leaned over, doing a little looming of his own.  “I said,” he told Cas, enunciating every word very carefully, “take off…your pants.”
After setting the final dish in the dish drainer, he vacated the kitchen and headed into the library, where Sam was intently reading something on his laptop while making meticulous notes.  He found Cas where he’d expected to, tucked into a small reading nook in a corner of the cavernous room.  The angel was happily buried in a book he’d found in some obscure extinct language, which he claimed was about bees.  Dean refrained from asking for further details, since getting him started on bees had about the same result as getting Sam started on whatever research he was into at any given time: Dean ending up with glazed eyes and possibly drooling after an hours-long lecture that he had tuned out of several minutes in.
“I mean,” Dean says consideringly, “I think that’s probably part of it?  Not that I’m sacrificing myself, I mean, just that it’s important that you do know that I still trust you and—and all that.  But that’s not
That was about all Dean could handle.  “Jesus Christ, it’s like you assholes
“What the hell?”
“Certainly you
That probably shouldn’t be as hot as it is, but whatever.  Dean’s at peace with his kinkiness at this point, and doesn’t feel even a little self-conscious at the whimper those words draw out of him.  “Yes, Sir,” he manages, a little breathily, knowing Cas expects a response.
was how he was going to play this.  Dean’s shoulder stilled, recognizing that, by agreeing to Cas’s terms, he had revoked the right to shake that hand off his shoulder and go back to the movie unperturbed—unless, of course, Cas’s raised eyebrow seemed to say, he wanted to invoke his safeword?  He could do so, even without speaking.  A specific series of squeezes to Cas’s hand and everything would halt immediately.  Dean actually considered it for half a second, not because he thought he couldn’t handle it, but because this was a dick move by Cas.  The thought was discarded nearly as soon as it arose.  That wasn’t what his safeword was for.  He’d made a bargain with the angel.  Cas had lived up to his end, and it would be churlish to renege on it just because Dean was annoyed by the terms of repayment.
“But you’re actually in a position to--”
Dean opens his mouth to answer, and nothing comes out.  His throat clicks as he swallows past a nonexistent lump.  His inability to speak tells both of them what today’s answer is.  This time, when Cas smiles against Dean’s ear, he can
“You do that on purpose, don’t you?” Dean accused, narrowing his eyes at the angel.
Cas set two fingers against one of his temples, took in a deep breath, and tried again, apparently giving up entirely on beating around the proverbial bush. “Sam, it makes both Dean and I extremely uncomfortable when you watch us engage in sexual congress.  While we certainly are in no position to judge anyone for their proclivities, we would strongly request that you vent any voyeuristic urges elsewhere.”
“Ugh, I have to pee.”  Okay, so it was a bit of a non sequitur, but he had no plans on dignifying Cas’s threat with a reply, so instead he settled for going with something that was both true and reasonably urgent.
He might, Dean reflected, have a point there.  Whisking together several eggs, he mixed them with melted butter and combined all of the ingredients, then beat them together, grateful for a useful outlet for his overflow of nervous energy.  Sighing a little, he handed the growing stack of dirty dishes over to Cas with a nod toward the sink, then set about starting to drop generous spoonsful of batter onto the cookie sheet.  He and Cas worked in silence for long moments, Dean letting his remaining irritation with the angel bleed out of him.  He felt calmer—albeit still entirely at a loss for how to handle Sam—by the time the first batch of cookies went into the oven.  Turning to where Cas was carefully drying dishes, Dean grimaced as a thought struck him.
loves Dean enough to hold him accountable for the shitty things he does and says.
As it was, Dean trusted his instincts once more and kept waiting, his thigh muscles starting to ache from the bizarre angle.  It took only another few seconds before he got what he had been looking for, another desperate plea.
“If I had known that slaughtering livestock was your idea of true romance, I would have ensured that we had several cows or at least a chicken or two snowed in with us.  As it stands, until I have freedom of angelic movement once more, you will have to make do with peanut butter, as we are out of ham,” the angel told him, typically deadpan.
“I…thanks, I guess?  But next time, could you…I don’t know, give me a heads’ up that you’re screwing around in there?”
which was not typical of their scenes.  Dean drew a startled breath, before reminding himself that Cas was still really damn riled up by Sam and likely not selecting his words as carefully as he might ordinarily.  Rather than sniping back, Dean (for once in his miserable life) acted strategically.
Dean doesn’t turn his head to look at the angel standing just slightly behind him.  Cas’s eyes rest on him, weightier even than his hand.  Dean gives Sam half a shrug with his free arm, then, indicating that there’s nothing he can do about it (never mind that he wouldn’t if he could).
That promise doesn’t have time to be tested before Lucifer presses himself off the doorjamb and stretches again.  “Welp, kiddo, I’ll be taking my leave.  Places to go, people to see.  No rest for the wicked and all that.  But rest assured, I’ll be seeing you.  Til next time!”
Cas’s weight lifted from him briefly.  Dean made a low whine of protest, and Cas chuckled.
Sam grunted again, but there was a brief pause before this one, as if he was actually considering Dean’s words first.
They breathe for a time, and Dean realizes that he was shaking only when it starts to taper off.  Only now does he remember Cas, jerking slightly as his head starts to swivel to look for the angel.
“True enough.  Let’s see if we can get this small, demonic creature to consider going to sleep so I can do the same.”
And…squishy?  His face shifted a little and sure enough…squishing.  Smelled good, too.  Earthy.  Rich.
“Eight miles east of it,” Cas confirms.
“Easy for him to say,” Dean grumbles, “when he’s not the one who—“
weird.  I have not said that.  I would never say that.  And I would prefer that you stop using such statements to downplay your own perfectly valid needs and emotions.”  Cas’s voice deepens as he says this, a hint of steel coming into his tone, a reminder that he dislikes Dean’s tendency to be self-effacing.  And, shit, just that
He moves slowly, deliberately, keeping within Dean’s line of sight as he steps in closer and then crouches.
know Sam was right about was that Cas was the furthest thing from bad for Dean.  If the angel was starting to worry about that, Dean needed to do a way better job of making sure Cas was aware of just how much goodness he brought into Dean’s life.
“You could.  Or we could just work harder to ensure that it does not happen again.”
“Thanks for noticing,” Dean tells him, and Cas has to stifle a snicker at how goddamn proud he sounds of himself.
used the last of the catnip.”
“Ca—Cas,” he garbles, and when that fails to produce the desired effect, he tries again, louder, if still somewhat muddled by tears,
for help.”
Dean can’t say for how long it goes on, just that it both feels like forever and no time at all before he feels Cas’s cock swelling a little with impending orgasm, and then Cas is drawing back with a tearing gasp, reaching down to grasp Dean’s thus far neglected dick and starting to jack it roughly.
can turn his knees to jelly and kick his heartbeat into overdrive is probably kind of fucked up, but what is a little more fucked up in a lifetime of it?  He tries, one more time, because for fuck’s sake, what Cas just did was a whole new level.
...which went about as well as could be expected.  It was funny, since under ordinary circumstances the angel held the best poker face on the planet without breaking a sweat, but as soon as he was actually
“...principle of the…”
“Sam, it’s fine,” he says.  “Look, you’re home, you’re gonna be fine.  Now we can all just…take a break, take a breather, get our feet under us.  It’s been nonstop for fucking months now.  We all just need a rest.”
Cas was at his back, a little too close for comfort, giving Dean the sense that he was being herded.  Halfway down the second set of stairs that led to the boiler room, Dean realized the wisdom in Cas’s choice of locations, which would presumably spare Sam the noise of what was to come.  His groin clenched in nervous anticipation at the realization that Cas fully intended the sounds of flesh striking flesh to be loud enough and last long enough that it would require two full floors and a maze of hallways.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s not great,” he concedes tiredly.
Cas did not give him time to catch his breath or recover any hint of his composure before he laid down the next stripe, low on Dean’s ass.  If he hadn’t bitten down on his own lower lip, Dean was pretty sure the sound that escaped him would’ve been a wail.  As it was, he tasted blood, and a second later Cas’s fingers were on his face, gently pressing his mouth open, freeing the lip he’d bitten open from his teeth.
and in response the fingers clamp still harder, digging what will ultimately be finger-shaped bruises into Dean’s bicep.  The whimper that escapes actually startles him more than Cas, and the almost surreal sense that’s overtaken him as he stares at the belt dangling from Cas’s other hand makes it seem to come from afar, despite the fact that he knows logically his own mouth produced the muffled sound.
take advantage of it, you just did not tell me.”  There were a few moments of silence as Cas puzzled it out, and then he huffed another laugh.  “Ah.  That night you dragged me out to the Impala.  I thought you seemed particularly desperate.”  Cas drove in a little more roughly, and Dean thought he was finally going to step it up, give Dean enough to really get off on, but he immediately slowed back to his previous, steady pace.
A moment later, a familiar, even sweeter smell hit his nostrils, and something soft and a little melty rubbed against his lips.  He opened them reflexively and a small square of something
he’s paid the price, not before, generally—but it’s still immeasurably reassuring.
Of course he had.  Of fucking course.  Dean had to clamp down hard on himself lest he say—or, for that matter,
These were not ordinary circumstances.
even for himself.  A little darker, a little more intently focused.  The swirling storm in his eyes had been a little more dangerous, the promises—not to mention the fulfillment—a little harsher.  He had been no less loving in the spaces between, but his edges were a little sharper.  It was, Dean realized in a flash of insight that hit him with the electrifying force of lightning, a product of being incarcerated by the forces of nature.  Dean’s instincts had been right, when they first realized what had happened, and that they would not be leaving the bunker anytime soon.  There was a bone deep unease that had settled into Cas.  With his grace fully restored, he was not used to the sensation of powerlessness any longer.  He felt out of control, and was coping at least in part by throwing himself into the things he did have control over.  Specifically, these moments between them, in which his control was absolute—over both himself and Dean.
Dean was silent for a moment too long, assuming the question was rhetorical, and the palm cracked against his ass for a third time, making him jump.  “I asked you a question, Mr. Winchester.  You are being rude.”
He had his orders.
It’s progress; he’ll take it.
“YOU—“ A pair of socks came flying past Dean’s head and bounced off the wall in front of him.
Dean trusted Cas implicitly.  Entirely.  And yet—there were isolated moments when he was reminded that Cas was an angel of the fucking Lord, a creature so ancient and powerful that Dean could neither hear his true voice nor see his true face without being seared from the inside out.  Moments when he realized how easy it would be for Cas to simply…put him down.  No more challenging than squashing Curtis had been for Dean.
And on that note, let me send some gratitude out where it belongs.
No, back to the first two voices now.
.  Trust me, you love your beta readers more than you know.  In the lady's own words, after I accused her of stealing all of my commas: "Lord almighty, I'm stealing a few so the parenthetical asides look like asides, and the commas that aren't necessary don't look like you flavored your screen with pepper."
Sam had sent Dean to the kitchen for ice water.
So, yeah, he’s been pushing boundaries all day.  He’s messed up poor Sam’s hair about six times, and would’ve gone for a seventh if Sam wasn’t starting to get that murderous look in his eye.  He spent an hour muttering “that’s what she said” after literally every sentence Cas spoke, whether or not it made any sense.  He’s managed to come up with
It was a joke.  Honestly, it was, but Cas knew how close those words struck to the heart of Dean’s only somewhat controlled self-loathing.  Something changed in his eyes, and although his hand did not release Dean’s head, Cas shifted his body until he and Dean were nose to nose, and it was no longer a strain to look at him.  When Cas spoke, his voice was quiet but solid with the weight of conviction.
He can’t even allow himself to consider the alternative.
Dean stared blankly at him.  He was still trying to figure out what the fuck Isla del Sol had to do with anything when Cas released his arm and stepped past him, bending down to neatly scoop up a duffel bag that had been resting in a corner of the landing.  Dean hadn’t noticed it before in his rush to get to the door.
4.   I've been shuttling Imp-the-Cat back and forth to his oncologists at the veterinary teaching hospital I take him to (which is enough of a drive that it requires some overnight stays) in order to complete his course of radiation.  That finished up on Tuesday, so things should be at least a little quieter than they have been in recent memory.
“Well, he recognizes my scent,” Cas rebuts, as if this is the most obvious thing in the world.  “He knows it extremely well, after all.  He does live here.”
Possibly the one highlight of his kitchen cataloging mission was the discovery that an unopened box of girl scout cookies had somehow managed to be forgotten in the back of a cupboard.  Dean dimly remembered stashing them there himself, smug at the idea that Sam wouldn’t be able to find and eat them.  Apparently, Sam wasn’t the only one he’d outsmarted with his clever hiding spot.  Dean gave himself a pass on forgetting about the box, since it had led to the happy occasion of now discovering it.
No light shown in through the entirety of the lower set of windows, and at least six inches of the higher.  They were entirely swathed in…something.  For a heart-stopping second, Dean was sure it was demon smoke, surrounding the bunker.  He almost immediately discarded the thought—the quality of the barrier was entirely different.  A second later, his brain caught up with his eyes, and he put it together.
Dean came back to himself slowly, the world painfully piecing itself together around him.
Dean stuck to his guns throughout the evening, burying himself in one of the games Charlie had installed on his laptop last year and giving Cas the brush-off when he sidled up behind Dean and started to kiss his neck.
“Well they
A strange look crossed Cas’s face, and he adopted the expression that meant he was in the process of having a revelation.  Dean lapsed into silence to allow Cas to think, finishing up his chips and popping the last bite of sandwich in his mouth.  He set the plate on his bedside table, exchanging it for the glass of water, which he took another large gulp of.  By this time, Cas was nodding to himself thoughtfully.
The stagecoach is still half a mile away, and Benny and the rest of the boys with it.  It’s just Garth and Dean against Michael fucking Novak and his crew.  Michael shoots off another round and Dean curses as Garth shouts in pain.  It’s not likely to be a fatal wound—Jeb didn’t even have time to make a sound, and Garth is cursing up a storm, or as close to actual cursing as he ever gets.  Despite whatever damage he’s taken, Garth’s shooting right back at the oncoming Novaks—behind Michael is a form that might be Uriel, and when Dean whips his head around he sees Bart and Malachi, closing in from the opposite direction.  A few others hang further back, motionless, seemingly trained on where the stagecoach will appear presently.  Dean makes the calculations in a fraction of a second, recognizing that while the Winchester crew laid an ambush for the coach, the accursed Novak gang laid an ambush for the Winchesters, and now they’re surrounded with back-up still a good two minutes out.
Dean took a couple steps back, surveying the layout, and nodded in satisfaction.  Sam should have everything he needed for survival down here, at the very least for a couple days.
“Not recently,” Dean tells him honestly, “and I’m just gonna—you know you’re like twenty times his size or something, right?”
Letting that go (because, while he had many turn-ons, synchronized swimming was actually not one of them), Dean walked forward again on his knees until his ass hovered just above the angel’s cock, which had flushed to an angry red in objection to how understimulated it was.  Dean had every intention of fixing that.
“I love you,” Cas told him quietly, “I love everything about you, and every inch of you.  You are everything I could ever want.  You are perfect, exactly as you are, and you are enough.”
Dean shudders a little.
Cas crossed the final few feet to the open door and stepped through, until both feet were firmly planted on solid ground—but then went no further.  Dean could tell something was happening, but could not for the life of him figure out
Speaking of whom, a quick glance around the room reveals no sign of the ginger monstrosity, which comes as a relief, whether or not the cat’s taken Cas’s lecture to heart.  Cas, meanwhile, nods agreement with Dean, no hint of reproach or irritation on his face.  Apparently, he
You have exactly thirty seconds to explain why Dean is drooling on a mound of mashed potatoes before I revoke any and all vows I have made not to smite you.”
“Very well, Dean,” the angel told him with a tone of voice that sounded
The next stroke did not fall.  Dean had been holding his breath in anticipation of it, trying desperately to ready himself.  He was tied up in an agony of anticipation until Cas’s words came quietly, no trace of mocking in them this time.
Dean almost groaned aloud, certain that he couldn’t handle being brought to the edge one more time only to be delayed, but Cas had mercy upon him.
“Good morning, Dean.”
“Okay, but that’s—I mean—there’s a difference between…oh, fuck it.  The next time you have a heart-to-heart with Crowley, make him tell you exactly what he did to get Rocky and Bullwinkle on Netflix, and if it didn’t involve fucking with anybody’s soul irreparably, see if you can convince him to get all the Die Hard movies added.”
Come find me on
Really?  That is…uh.  Fair enough.”
And he wasn’t done.
“Shut.  Up.”
Sam subsided, mollified, and Cas spoke up from beside them, idly.  “Gabriel insisted that I reenact a superhero movie with him once.  I would not have minded, but the costume he provided for me was quite revealing, and I was appallingly objectified by the angels he corralled to be our audience.  It was an eye-opening experience.”
“—but, as I was saying if you’d let me finish, we already know we’re never going to be able to split them up, so if Eileen and I do end up getting our own place—which we have no immediate plans of doing—they’ll stay here with you guys.”
Cas must’ve done a good job with the warding, because Sam admitted later that once he heard the clear sex noises, he’d tried everything else he could think of to get the door open without success.  It really shouldn’t have surprised either of them that when he couldn’t open the thing, rather than giving up like a normal human being, he’d decided to go
His jeans and boxers were around his ankles about three nanoseconds later with a quiet rustling of fabric.  The telltale click of a cap came rapidly on its heels, and Dean barely had a chance to spread his legs a little and cant his ass up toward the angel before a single finger slid unerringly home.
And Cas needed to understand that.  Needed to know.  And for that, he needed to forgive himself.
“You…didn’t find me in the ventilation system by accident, did you?”
Cas just shrugged helplessly.  A second later both of them jumped as a voice thundered down the hall from the library and broke against Dean’s closed door.
“That…can’t be right.  It’d be like...ten feet or something.”  Dean recognized the same dim-witted shock in his own voice that he heard in Sam’s.
“And does that explain why you just interrupted me
Once more they receded, but they weren’t happy about it, and he had the sense that if this kept up, if this inexplicable rift spun out much longer, they might not be battled back quite as easily.
“Then you may choose to remain until it is over, as long as you do so with the understanding that I do not like being kept waiting,” his voice was a little sly, as if ‘Mr. Novak’ enjoyed the idea of making Student-Dean decide between earning some form of devious punishment or disappointing his coach and teammates by leaving practice early after arriving late.
“You on watch, Castiel?” Bart asks, narrowing his eyes a bit in a way that suggests mingling distaste and distrust, which seems a bit odd given that they’re members of the same gang, not to mention kin.  Castiel’s face, so expressive thus far, suddenly seems as if it might be etched from granite for all it gives away.
Dean retired shortly thereafter, dozing off with his head pillowed comfortably on the angel’s chest.  He slept hard and woke up late with his head resting on a real pillow and Cas nowhere to be found.  Saying a silent prayer that Sam was still in one piece, Dean rolled over, grimacing as his still tender ass made contact with the bed.  Tugging down his sweatpants, he headed for the mirror, where he discovered that his ass was still tinged lightly pink, but somehow had not a single bruise on it.  He hadn’t a damn clue how the angel accomplished this, considering the level of sting he was able to impart with a palm that, by the time he was finished with Dean’s ass, felt about as solid and weighty as a two-by-four, but somehow he managed it every time.
Come find me on
“Do you think there’s a catch?” Dean asked doubtfully.
this is hot as fuck.
Instinctively, Dean’s arms come up to catch him, to cradle him, and
was love, the willingness to offer shared ownership of his beloved memory foam), they watched a movie before Cas gave Dean the kind of neck and back massage that practically had him melting through the mattress.  In addition to soothing all of the muscles that had been tied up in knots from the scene and the subsequent work-out, it also left Dean incredibly relaxed.  He fell asleep almost instantly when Cas joined him on the bed and wrapped him in those strong arms, totally bypassing what would ordinarily have been some serious tossing and turning while he tried to get the by now low-level but still omnipresent arousal under control.
about it?  If I go in there I’m just gonna end up uncomfortably mumbling random syllables at him that may or may not actually form words.”
Baby—she was more than just a car.  She was stability.  She was steadiness.  She was a constant for him, and he for her.  Dean had been there at the beginning—the moment when John Winchester made the impulsive decision to go for it and buy her—and he had been there at what should’ve been her end, the moment when a semi smashed into her and nearly took the lives of all three Winchester men.

That does it.  Dean never calls Cas by his full name, and certainly not in mid-spanking.  Cas freezes, hand presumably halfway to another swat, and Dean doesn’t actually have to explain himself, because the house gives its hardest shake yet, and a very loud and outraged squeal breaks the newly established quiet.  Dean couldn’t begin to say how the hell he knows that the sound in question is outraged, but he’s entirely certain of it.
“I do so love those little gasps,” Cas muses, “let me see how many I can earn.”
“And why are you being punished?”
Dean wasn’t sure when it happened, but he became aware that as Cas’s pace sped, a tiny measure at a time, Dean’s own hips were lifting rhythmically off the bed so that his ass rose to meet Cas’s hips.  He was pressing his ass back into the thrusts, taking a little more from them than Cas was demanding, creating a little more force in them than Cas was imposing.
He slows down now, choosing the location of each lash carefully, varying the time between strokes so that Winchester never knows what’s coming, except by the sudden whistle of the lash through the air just before it hits home.
at this point, but back to functional, anyway.  So, yeah, his presence here is a good thing.  Dean doesn’t have to stress about him, and at the moment, he really only has enough soul-crushing, heart-clenching, existential terror for one of the people he lo—cares most about.  Sam’s got the market entirely cornered on that at present.
Dean was pretty sure his innards were melting in horrified humiliation at hearing his brother and his boyfriend/(okay fine call him what he was) Dom discussing their sex life.  Still, to the degree that he was able to set that aside, he registered that Sam was giving Cas quite a gift, offering reassurance that Cas wouldn’t have believed coming from Dean’s lips but might just be able to accept when it came from Sam’s.
At that point, there was nothing left to do but head to his room and get ready.  His watch informed him that it was 6:46 PM, and he figured he’d done as good a job as possible of passing the interminable two hours.
“That’s a risk you’re just going to have to take, isn’t it?”
these days.  He’d discovered somewhere along the way that, as hard-headed as Dean is, he tends to respond to more…concrete consequences.  Dean’s not entirely sure how the hell they ended up where they are now, but he’s gotta admit it
Yeah, Dean knows that charge in the air, and he’s so startled to find it here, with someone of this name (not, he briefly and dryly reflects, that it’s the first time he’s had sparks fly with a Novak, come to think of it), he can’t even dredge up the kind of brazen quip he’s known for in moments like these.  Unsurprisingly, given his demeanor thus far, it doesn’t seem Castiel Novak is known for that kind of flippancy himself (although Dean supposes it’s possible he’s taken just as off-guard by the heat that’s settled between them) and so the silence stretches out between them.  Who knows how long they might have remained like that; eyes locked, the flicker of the lantern painting both of their faces in an ever-changing glow, if the familiar shape of Bart Novak didn’t appear in the circle of lantern light, wiping his hands on his pants in a way that makes perfectly clear that he’s the erstwhile pisser.
Frankly, if a meteor piloted by an English-speaking chinchilla from outer space had come crashing through the ceiling and landed in his lap, it couldn’t have surprised Dean more than what actually happened next.
Cas hadn’t entirely been wrong.  The amount of movement required definitely reignited the burn in his ass and thighs, and by the time he was on his feet he discovered that he was pressing his lips together to refrain from at least groaning.
Lucifer shrugs, strolling to the door of his room.  “If you say so, kiddo.”  Dean thinks for a second that’s going to be it, Lucifer is going to leave without a final biting quip, but of course he’s fooling himself.  The Devil loves the last word.
He isn’t.
on his head, Sam’s face was invisible behind the mosquito netting swathing it, draped over his head underneath the colander-cum-helmet.  Both of his hands were wrapped in death grips around two large cans of Raid.
The fingers that close around his ankle are bruising, the grasp iron, and Dean’s first instinct isn’t toward self-preservation. If it was, he would be breaking into frantic apologies for the whole go-fuck-yourself thing, begging mercy, blaming it on a lousy night’s sleep, or insufficient calories, or hell, Mercury being in retrograde.
“At any rate, I reminded her of the vow she had made and she told me with apparent relish that the promise did not count because she had been crossing her fingers.  Of course, I did not understand the relevance, but eventually she managed to convey the role of crossed fingers in negating vows.”
Sam shrugs, grinning back, then heads for the door, pausing just before he leaves.  “Oh, and Dean?”  Dean waits, not bothering to speak since he knows Sam wouldn’t understand him from the doorway anyway.  “The toilet in the bathroom in there is removable.  Just so you know.  Later!”  Wait, what?  That’s a weird fucking thing to say.  Dean’s completely mystified, but he doesn’t have time to worry about it now.  An incredibly downtrodden Cas sulkily awaits.  He sketches a wave of acknowledgement and farewell to Sam, then squares his shoulders and heads inside.
And then there were the ones that were reserved only for Dean.  The come-hither smile, that promised sensual delights if Dean would only give into it.  The darkly sensual one.  The threatening smile, and the slightly cruel one that promised swift and painful punishment.  The challenging one that just begged Dean to fight him and lose.  The exhausted, sated smile that came at the end of a really intense scene, and the smile so feral that it could’ve graced the face of a wolf in the wild.  And then, finally, there was a smile that Dean privately thought of as the “you did this to yourself” smile.
It’s no use, he can tell that Cas saw it, but they don’t speak of it, and anyway, there are things that have to happen, and both of them have gotten damn good at repressing the fuck out of emotion in order to do what needs to be done.  They wouldn’t have survived, otherwise.
Castiel’s fingers fall away, giving Dean a chance to collect himself, but Dean doesn’t seem to want much of one.  He gives himself no more than thirty seconds to enjoy the glow of release before his arms, slung loosely around Castiel’s shoulders, come to life, his hands shifting to grasp Cas’s upper arms, bearing him backward into the edge of the pool.  Before Cas knows it, Dean’s hands have fallen to grip his thighs, and he lifts, deftly seating Cas on the edge of the pool.  Cas inhales sharply, Dean’s lips curving into a grin as he gazes up, then leans down to nudge his nose against Castiel’s cock, which has been near painfully hard since before he swatted Dean’s hand away from it.
make it look like he didn’t trust Cas, didn’t it?
With his left hand.
“That is lovely,” Cas compliments, teasing but sincere, “how nicely you presented yourself for me.  We mustn’t be greedy, though.  You’ll get what you want when I’ve gotten the color I’m looking for, and we’re nowhere near it yet.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can be your friend, not foe / But first my evil eye must go / If that should fail, remember you / Can ask me back for morning brew.”
“I’ll make you a couple more sandwiches if you’ll go put this in one of the empty lockboxes and bury it so deep it’ll take a spelunking expedition to pull it back out,” he told Sam, pointing at the game which still sat, deceptively small and non-threatening, on the end of the table.  Sam gave the box a dark look, but stood up, placing a hand at the small of his back and stretching it with a grimace.  Apparently, Dean wasn’t the only one hurting from their earlier exertions.
“Would you like us to leave you alone for a little while,” Cas inquired, “and perhaps come to check on you in another twenty or thirty minutes?”  It was quiet while Sam considered this for a bit before responding.
Cas snorted a laugh.  “That is exceedingly
The supply horse Dean’s riding, a mare by the name of Missouri, turns out to be both sturdier and faster than she looks, and they make better time than Dean anticipated.  Good thing, too, because by the time the position of the moon tells Dean it’s nearing midnight, he can see that Cas is flagging.  No damn wonder, either.  The man’s gotta be at more than thirty hours now with no sleep, and it ain’t like it’s been a relaxing day and a half.
Peace offering managed, Dean took a third batch of cookies out of the oven and popped the fourth and last batch in, snagging himself a cookie that was still a little too hot to eat comfortably.  He hummed contentedly to himself, savoring his own baking skills and wondering whether he could successfully fix his Netflix recommendation screen so that he and Cas could watch a movie.
“I wish we had a mirror small enough,” Cas murmurs, “so I could show you exactly how red your ass still is.  Little lines of bruising just starting to appear—such a lovely sight.  You could have spared yourself such a painful punishment had you just behaved; you know I do not enjoy being so hard on you,” Dean can hear the “but” coming a mile away and sure enough, “but oh, I do so enjoy taking advantage of its aftereffects.”
When he spoke, he was a little impressed with the fact that his voice actually sounded a little higher than usual, an echo of the 18-year-old he had once been.  “I’m really sorry, Mr. Novak.  I had to stop off and let Coach know I was gonna be a little late for practice.  This isn’t gonna take too long, is it?  We’ve got a big game tomorrow night, and—“
"Bolivia rests as far south of the Equator as we are north of it. I could ...make some arrangements. Nobody would be the wiser save for a few weather sprites in New Mexico," Cas growls. "You know, for trying to cockblock while thousands of kilometers away...."
“—about how we handle thoughts in general moving forward, yeah,” Dean interrupted, nodding.
Sam and Dean moved down the table to settle on opposite sides of the board, and Cas sat at the end of the table.
happened.  For weeks.  Is it any wonder things got bad?
“My pleasure,” Cas told him, smiling slightly, “even if I am now left with performance anxiety due to the fact that the noises a hot pocket can wring from you appear to exceed those that I earn.”
with each other.
“Because he won’t be ready to talk to you yet—or he won’t think he is, anyway.”
Cas leaned over a little further than necessary to grab his pawn and, turning his head, murmured nearly inaudibly against the side of Dean’s face, “not yet, but oh, you will be.”
“It so happens as you’re right,” Dean says wryly, “and I do hope you’re here to change that and not just to comment on it.”
Dean’s hands are somehow everywhere, one wrapped firmly around Castiel’s shoulders to cup the back of his head, the other sliding along Cas’s side to squeeze his hip.
There won’t be time, because Dean is not carrying the bomb, Dean
Cas appears to be right.  Imp blinks again, and then a third time, eyes starting to look a little heavy, and then his jaw splits in an enormous yawn, revealing baby teeth that Dean can already confirm are sharp as shit, even through a quilt and a sheet.  “According to that website, kittens sleep almost 18 hours a day, and he did just play for almost four hours straight.  He’s gotta be pretty well tuckered out.”
The splinter, if it could even be called that—really, it was more like a
Fuck.
the library was a horror-show was that someone was refusing to come out from a literal blanket fort, leading Cas and I to conclude that if we didn’t find something in the books that would let us break out of here stat, you might actually have a complete nervous breakdown.”
The shudder of horror that passes through Dean is, just this once, not for Sam or for Charlie.  It’s for Dean himself, and him alone.  For the first time in his captivity and, he vows, the last, he feels the prickle of moisture behind his eyes, and allows himself a single moment of weakness.  He hunches inward, as if the sheer act of making himself smaller could somehow protect against what is to come.
“I’ll grab the litter box and puppy pads, you can take them to our room.”
Dean tipped his head into Cas’s hand and smiled back up at him before squaring his shoulders and responding.  “No.  I’m okay.  Green, Sir.”
“I’m, uh, not saying that’s not an interesting opener, buddy,” Dean bursts out, unable to restrain himself, “and I’m definitely not saying you haven’t piqued my interest, but…exactly how many stories actually begin with an
“Where,” Cas inquired, “do you suppose it came from?”  Keeping one eye trained on the chicken, which was clucking softly, the three of them glanced back at the board.
YOU VENT YOUR IRE WHEN YOUR BROTHER IS IN SUCH A VULNERABLE STATE?!  HAVE YOU NO SHAME?”
“As a matter of fact, I did.  He appeared to be browsing listings of apparatuses designed to be used for sexual activity.”  Dean closed his eyes and took a long drink of his coffee.  He was clearly going to need another few cups before he could deal with this crap in earnest.
He didn’t make it more than a step before a hand on his elbow brought him up short, swinging him back around.  He found himself gathered into Cas’s arms, the strong grasp winding around him, the angel’s lips against his cheek as he murmured, “And lest this be in any way unclear, my beautiful man, this is not because I do not or will not want to touch you.  Quite the contrary, it will require practically superhuman—“
So Dean hadn’t.  Maybe eavesdropping was juvenile, but he was sure as hell not planning on leaving his addled brother unmonitored with his furious boyfriend for an indeterminate length of time.  That seemed like a recipe for bloodshed, tears, broken objects, or worse.  So here he was, literally lurking in a shadowed corner and waiting to hear any indication that Sam had somehow managed to conjure Cas out of thin air.  Then he figured he could sneak down the hall and listen by the door, because if he was going to be a nosy 12-year-old he might as well go for broke.
“My attitude is pretty hard to adjust,” Dean observed, dispensing with the sarcasm and instead going for self-deprecating good humor.  Cas huffed a laugh.
“Yes, well, all I ask is that you show some sensitivity in discussing this.”
“You three okay?” He group-texts all of them, “you’ve been gone a hell of a long time for a run.”
“Shut your mouth,” Michael says, and Castiel’s lips snap shut.  “No, you ain’t coming.  You’re gonna stay right here.”
Was anything too absurd for Sam at this point in the proceedings?
There’s no goddamn way it’s a coincidence.
“You could,” Cas told him mildly, lips twitching in barely concealed amusement, “do a great deal worse, you know.”
Sam nodded and vanished through the doorway, leaving Dean and Cas staring at each other in shell-shocked disbelief for a few long moments.
Okay, gang.  Mea culpa.  Y'all had to wait a really long damn time for this chapter, I know.  I didn't anticipate the gap between updates ever getting this long, but that's what happens when you have too many projects on your plate.  Over the last month in particular, I've had to do a lot of traveling that has cut down on my writing time, and my focus has been on the (now nearly finished!!) DCBB that
“True enough,” Michael allows, yanking Dean’s head up and out of the water by the back of his hair.  The man has gone limp, and for a moment Castiel fears he might be dead, but a kick from Bart makes him stir feebly, and Cas exhales a silent breath.  “Anyway,” Michael says, “the day’s gotten away from us.  Bart, chain him to something.  I smell something good from the cook tent.”
“You will not speak until given permission.  You may nod and shake your head.  Do I make myself perfectly clear?”
“Slightly over 37,” Cas corrected, a little pedantically.
“Cas…?” he asks, and the multitude of questions go unspoken but clearly communicated nonetheless.
TITLE NOTE:
“Ye—“ he had to pause and lick his dry lips before he could go on.  Cas’s eyes followed the motion intently from afar.  “Yes, Sir.”
“How very right you are,” Gregor says, and there is a subtle but unmistakable mingling of emotions in his voice—humor and wryness foremost, but underlain with a hint of melancholy that almost sounds (although if pressed, Dean couldn’t say how he knows it) like
“Shhh, baby, no.  No, it’s okay.  It’s okay.  I’ve got you.”  Okay.  Too far, too soon.  He wanted to push Cas, yes, but not to break him.  Never to break him.  Indeed, he was aiming for the opposite, here.  He was aiming to put the angel back together, to affix the splintered shards of his heart back where they belonged, one piece at a time, smoothing out the jagged edges.
“As a matter of fact, we will be finding that out tomorrow,” Cas told him excitedly.  Dean’s brows rose as he tried to figure out exactly what Cas was—oh.  Oh.
Another minute goes by as Dean muses on this, and time is
Until.
Honestly, Dean was astonished he’d lasted this long, and it didn’t especially surprise him when his cock was totally unable to restrain itself any longer.  Cas’s cock had made contact with his exquisitely sensitive ass no more than eight or ten times before a wail tore itself from Dean and his cock was pulsing, spilling itself in spurts across both his stomach and his poor, abused shirt.
Chapter-specific tags and warnings:  intense consensual, sexualized corporal punishment with belt, butt plugs (well actually only one, but really, isn't that enough?), bondage, praise kink, and, unsurprisingly, Sam, interrupting.  (Did I forget anything?  Tell me if I forgot something)
“Omigod,” Dean panted, staring down at the dark, mussed head where his cock had been five seconds ago (and probably still was, if the hot wet pleasure that was currently suffusing it was any indication). Maybe not the most eloquent statement he’d ever made, but it was a hell of a lot more astute than anything else he would be producing in short order.
“I dislike it when harm comes to animals or children,” the angel informed him censoriously.  Dean refrained from reminding Cas for the hundredth or so time that movies were fiction.  It was a losing battle.
“Dean, help me.  Please,
The trio lapsed back into silence for a moment, still gazing upward.
to Dean.
yeah, he definitely put some stress on that particular word, “come upon us going at it, it’s not going to fuck your entire world up at this point, but you’re also not going to go barging in past closed doors or hang around to watch, if you should stumble across us.  Right?  That sounds good to everyone?”
Chapter specific tags and warnings:  Rough oral sex, face fucking, mild come play, manhandling, D/s
“That is not entirely clear, but I rather imagine we will find out soon enough,” Cas sighed.
“Oh.”  The man says, “okay.”  He nods firmly, as if this clears everything up, starts to walk again, then stops after a few steps and backs up again, squinting at Dean in renewed confusion.  “Winchester as in…Winchester?”
Several minutes later—though whether it was two or ten, Dean could not have said—he found that small sounds were escaping him at the fall of each smack.  He made a wordless sound of protest when the fingertips of each hand slid into the waistband of his panties.  It came as no surprise when Cas ignored the sound of negation, and the slowness with which he drew the panties down over the curve of Dean’s ass was just cruel.  Satisfaction just radiated from him as he leaned over Dean’s ass, bending so close to it that Dean could actually feel the hot breath against his overly warm cheeks.  Cas’s nose nudged at his left cheek before his teeth again closed, lightly and then just for a second, agonizingly hard on the curve of his right.  Dean let go a wordless cry at the harsh bite, ass trying futilely to cringe away from it.  It was unnecessary, in any case, because the teeth were removed as quickly as they had come.  Cas gave him no time to recover before he resumed the spanking, the sound of his hand falling both crisper and louder without the thin barrier of the panties to dull it.
Cas rides hard across the plains, his mare Amelia happy to have the opportunity to get out and run for the first time in several days.
The second comes on the heels of the first, earning a muffled yelp, and when the third lands unerringly at the seam of ass and thighs, Dean’s too wrapped up in the pain to feel embarrassed about the fact that he’s started kicking like a little kid.
The smile was still audible in Cas’s voice as he responded, “Dean, in our long history, has there ever—“ the knee on Dean’s back lifted and Cas interrupted himself to address his change in position, “I do not need to tell you that this does not constitute permission to move, do I?” Rhetorical.  Definitely rhetorical.  Cas confirmed this when he went on with barely a pause for breath, “—has there ever been a time in which I have proven unwilling to do anything within my power to ensure your needs are met?”  Dean actually afforded Cas the respect of seriously considering this question.  As he thought about it, Cas shifted, settling down to sit on the bed beside where Dean was laid out, at an angle that allowed him to maintain his grasp on Dean’s wrist easily.  Dean, after a quick review of the last, Jesus, close to a decade, came to the conclusion that he’d expected from the start.  Cas, unwilling to meet his needs?  No examples of such a time came to mind.
Dean knows how wiped out the angel is when he falls asleep almost as soon as Dean pulls the car out of its parking space.  It’s got a full tank, thank—well, shit, thank Chuck, Dean guesses—and it means they can put Libby far behind them before worrying about risking a gas station with surveillance video.
It occurred to Dean that, even though he was certainly not crazy about being penned in, it wasn’t the first time—and at least he was safe, warm, and with people he trusted.  For Cas, though, this had to be a new and uncomfortable experience.  He wasn’t used to being confined, particularly not on earth, when his grace was fully intact.
Oh, hell no.  Dean has no intention of earning himself any time in that horrible thing.  His voice is a little croaky, but easily understandable when he grates out a “yes, Sir.”
enthusiast.”
“You were quite right, Dean.  Once I let go of my original expectations, I greatly enjoyed the movie after all.”
you make that racket?”
Some kinds of filth can’t be washed clean.
“Oh, Cas.  Oh, babe,” Dean said, the final pieces clicking into place, blinking a little rapidly himself, feeling his heart contract at the sheer loneliness of that final message. “You couldn’t have known.  There was no way for you to know what was happening and go to her.”
“I have n—n—no—

Dean absently closed his laptop before dropping his feet back to the floor and standing.  “Lead on, Macduff.”

Of course, all of that was five solid minutes ago, before Dean’s thoughts started to get away from him, making him conclude that this idea was completely unworkable and he’d been under the influence of a brief psychotic break when he agreed to it.

The last time they’d done this, Cas had clung to the counter in the kitchen, fighting desperately against his own instincts, letting Dean maintain control.  This was the same act in theory only.  In reality, it was the polar opposite, Cas’s control absolute.  Dean was just along for the ride, holding on for dear life—except he wasn’t even doing that, not even permitted that much.  Instead, it was Cas’s brutal hold, his fingers tangled in Dean’s hair that kept him upright.
“Stuart,” Sam addresses the rat respectfully, “you can come along with me while I research if you want.  We can get you something to eat and I’ll bring you back whenever you’re ready.”
That is…that’s special.  That means something.
Dean became aware of this reasonably rapidly, when what drew him back from the blissed out abyss was the sound of raised voices.  Still, he drifted in and out for long moments, catching a word here, a phrase there.
“So it has, and—oh, hello, Gregor,” Cas interrupts himself, smiling at the entranceway to the living room.  Dean pivots, face already breaking into a grin in anticipation of seeing his little buddy, quietly taking a second to muse that if someone had told him three days ago that he would be delighted to see a cockroach, he’d have laughed in their face.  This indisputable truth doesn’t serve to dampen his delight any, and if the happy waggling of Gregor’s hind end is to be believed, he’s just as happy to see them.
“He occasionally calls me to talk,” Cas told him, his face guileless, “I think he is sometimes lonely, surrounded only by people who are endlessly obsequious.  And he told me the last time he called you to talk, you demanded to know what racket he was running and hung up on him.”
Maybe he should’ve gone with the cock ring, because he damn near came right then and there.
“And if you lay so much as a single finger on your own cock, from
The light bulb flickered on, a little sluggish but there.
“What now?” Cas asked uncertainly from about six feet in front of the Alp.
“All what?” Cas said, eyes widening in a parody of that familiar cluelessness that was often not feigned.
Cas shook his head, apparently oblivious to the effect these revelations were having on Dean.  “It is now.  Crowley called several days later to inquire how I liked the show, and when I informed him it wasn’t available on Netflix he became irate and told me he would ‘handle it.’”
He didn’t ask again.  Instead he rose and fell once more, setting a steady rhythm as he fucked himself on Cas’s cock.
that it was a prelude to Cas shoving him away, throwing him back down on the cool tile floor, unable to stand the sight of him, let alone the touch.
somehow managed to almost never get stuck with that particular chore, Dean supposed it shouldn’t surprise him that Sam was oblivious to how foul sponges could smell when they weren’t allowed to dry properly.  Cas had stared at him with such utter befuddlement the last time Dean had tried to complain to him about Sam’s lack of kitchen awareness that Dean had pretty much given up on venting to him, and settled for grumbling mentally these days.
Castiel retires from the cook tent hastily, canteen slung over his shoulder and chili guarded carefully in each hand.  Wouldn’t do to end up with both knocked on the ground by some cousin in a foul mood, and while Michael might persuade Cook to give him another round to feed the prisoner, he knows damn well ain’t nobody would authorize Castiel himself to get a second helping, no matter where the first ended up.
It was such a small thing, again, a nothing of a throwaway quip, but just like that moment in the car, it emphasizes anew that nothing is safe.  There is no topic, no joke, no easy conversation that is not in some way fraught with danger and ripe for the kind of moments that tear barely scabbed wounds wide open yet again.
It wasn’t a question, nor was it quite an order.  Instead it was a simple statement of fact, a nearly bland accounting of what would be happening hence, with no room left for other possibilities.  Trying to maintain some semblance of his usual swagger, Dean quirked a brow at Cas to inquire, “The
You're welcome again.
Stuart senses the danger (not a hard thing, considering the waves of barely suppressed fury radiating off of Cas, not to mention the threat inherent in the way he stands) and starts to back away, intent on protecting himself and his rider from this new threat.  Later, Dean will reflect that it’s kind of funny that the nearly six-and-a-half feet of Sam intimidate the rat not at all, but five inches worth of angry Cas is enough to spark his fight-or-flight instincts.
The activity around the tents rises to a fever pitch thereafter, and soon enough even young Jeremiah is called away.
Cas must’ve been creepily tuned into Dean’s metabolism or something, because he always seemed to be the first one to know when Dean would be getting hungry.  And, yeah, it was about lunchtime, but still—Dean’s stomach started growling at exactly the point in the proceedings when Cas had instructed him to get some lunch.
The arm around his waist is the lone reason Dean is still on his feet, and a moment later Cas removes the need for even that as he leans down and sweeps Dean into his arms.
to know.
“Do you want to sleep now?” Cas asked quietly.
Dean has just stood and absently wiped his hand off on his jeans again when it happens.
“So it is.  It seems to me that one hundred smacks is an eminently fair—indeed,
“What, you’re surprised?” He says, the smirk easily recognizable in his voice, “Haven’t you been payin’ attention?”
No, but seriously.  I had the final three chapters laid out perfectly.  Charted.  Outlined.  Ready to go.
“—he saw an opportunity and he took it?” Dean finishes.  “I’ll be damned.  I think we just got to the bottom of this feud.”
Castiel watches as Dean’s fingers slowly uncurl with what looks like monumental effort.  It must take even greater effort for him to force out the words, because they sound like they’ve been ground raw before emerging.  “I’ll be good, Michael,” he says, and though he’s clearly aiming for a monotone, he can’t quite conceal the tempest of emotion behind it.  There is loathing there, Castiel thinks, and fear, plus a bone-deep disgust that mirrors what Castiel finds has blossomed in his own gut.
“Now, then, one small matter to attend to and then you may be on your way.”
Endless and eternal gratitude to my wonderful beta (and beautiful girlfriend)
Michael chuckles, the sound smooth and steady in a way that might be soothing, even infectious, in other circumstances.  Here and now, it freezes Castiel’s blood just a little more.
They’re both right where they were left, Missouri dozing in apparent comfort in the shade of the rocks while Amelia drinks from the pool.  They whicker greetings as Dean appears, and he pauses to scratch both of their muzzles affectionately—when they get back to the compound, Missouri is gonna have the most comfortable retirement any horse has ever gotten—before taking stock of the day.

Dean shrieks, not daring to slow down despite the burn in his legs and his lungs.
There are benefits to either strategy, and—
Sam made a face, shaking his head, and Dean immediately realized that he had made a tactical error at the look on his face as he opened his mouth with a rebuttal.  “No way.  The Marvel universe is far superior to the DC universe.  Don’t get me wrong, Batman’s great, but the Marvel characters are much more representative of actual real-world demographics.  They’re racially diverse, they have queer characters, and they’re not political symbols, except when it’s explicitly addressed that they are.  It’s just a better universe all around.”
“It’s not like I don’t listen when you talk at
Looking reassured, Cas went on.
the chair was in that particular spot in the first place.  In two minutes, he will be kicking himself for not using what are ordinarily impressively sharp powers of observation.  In two minutes, he will be regretting a number of his most recent life choices.
Despite the limits his current state of dishabille, the dim lighting, and the cramped passage place on his speed, Dean makes it to the point at which that ventilation shaft branches out into three others in fairly short order (
“Not a big fan of doors or stairs, are you?” Dean says conversationally, lifting his head only long enough to thump it back against the wall equally lightly, feeling that this is the most diplomatic expression of ‘oh for fuck’s sake’ he can currently offer.
There’s a relatively long moment of silence now, Cas and Sam’s foreheads knitting up into otherwise identical looks of concentration, size notwithstanding.  Dean taps an impatient foot on the ground, crossing his arms over his chest in a gesture intended to emphasize his displeasure with the rat and his club of enthusiasts.  Frankly, Dean’s had just about enough of having
They made it halfway to the door before Cas froze.
“It was a gambit, Cas, and it
He wasn’t wrong.  Immediately, the belt cracked against him, laying a third stripe across the base of the plug, jarring it hard into Dean’s prostate.  As if by command, Dean’s cock pulsed.  He felt it jerk as it painted his belly and the hood of the car (poor Baby, he would give her a really good waxing job tomorrow, if he could still move).  For a second it occurred to him that last time, he’d also come untouched at the final stroke of the belt.
“Yes,” Cas said glumly, wiping his nose on Dean’s flannel.  Dean opted not to mention it, given the circumstances.
Hell, the soft sound of the angel slicking his cock up is nearly enough to send him over the edge.  Seconds later, one firm hand settles on his hip just before Dean feels a blunt head nudging at his already slick and slightly loose rim.  Cas slides in smoothly, not brutal but not particularly gentle either, and Dean makes it precisely one more thrust (right up until Cas’s thighs nestle in close behind his ass and send the abused nerve-endings to screaming) before he shakes apart at the seams.
“Welcome home,” Dean says, and Castiel believes him.
“Also,” he informed the two of them, only slightly less grumpily, “I’m still Batman.”
“Of a sort,” Gregor allows, “certainly it was a…wrong place, wrong time situation.”
Y'all went above and beyond last chapter with commenting.  You really listened to my pleas for feedback, and I can't tell you how much joy that brought me.  Now, if this chapter brought you some joy or maybe a few tingles, I want to hear about it.  Don't leave me hanging (something something hanging dick joke, remember, 12-year-old boy).  I want to know what you think.  I DEMAND to know what you think.  Don't make me get the ruler.
“I said to shut your mouth!” Michael roars, and Castiel skitters back a step, eyes wide, silenced.
The resultant groaned yell that Cas produced served as a pretty damn good simulated orgasm, and Dean went ahead and offered up some climax-worthy yells too.  Then, while Cas was still trying to catch his breath from the unexpected assault, Dean stood up, grabbed Cas’s hand, and yanked him toward the door.  Sam had obligingly stepped out of the way, and Dean had hauled Cas down the hall with a quick yell over his shoulder toward Sam.
Cas doesn’t disappoint him as a single slick finger probes at the tender muscle between his cheeks, circling once, then tapping teasingly before sliding home with little ceremony.  Dean groans loudly, not even trying to hold it back.  He’s been waiting for this, hell,
He doesn’t even get to finish the damn sentence before there’s a third tap on his forehead with two fingers, and the urge to sneeze which had appeared the instant the kitten got within dander distance suddenly vanishes.
By the time the bread (which was a perfect golden brown, much to Dean’s smug delight) came out of the oven, just shy of an hour later, Dean was ready to go and more than a little pleased with his ingenuity.  After digging around the storage room in the attempt to figure out what the hell he was going to do about lunch, he discovered to his delight that he’d missed a five-pound bag of potatoes tucked into a corner of the storage room, and only a couple of them were unusable.  Perfect.  This would fit into his plans beautifully.
squeezing.
Also, this chapter is unbetaed.  Any errors in it are most definitely my fault and mine alone.
“You know,” Dean says, smiling a little bit as a whisker lightly tickles his cheek, “I think I like Imp, too. And Sebastian’s not so bad, either.”
He scarcely heard Cas asking permission to use his grace to clean Dean off, just together enough to nod permission.  A soft fabric he recognized as his own robe wrapped around him a few seconds later, and Cas guided him to his feet just in time for Dean to discover that after four enthusiastic rounds with no break in between, his legs were still out to lunch.
So maybe he wasn’t the single most skilled pep-talk giver in the history of pep-talk giving, but it seemed to work well enough.  Still grumbling a little, Sam lifted a hand to his hair (presumably to prevent it from fulfilling Dean’s dire prophecy and fucking right off his head), staggered to his feet and galumphed off down the hallway toward the showers, but not before flipping Dean the bird.
Sam blinked silently up at the ceiling, a tear trickling from one eye into the hair that lay carelessly on the tile floor.  The floor that they
(don’t talk about it don’t think about it don’t remember it).
It led him exactly where he had known it would, down one flight of stairs and two hallways over, to the storage room in which spell ingredients lived.  Sure enough, in the middle of the stone floor, far from anything that could ignite and start a fire more dangerous, a pile of what smelled like at least seven or eight distinct herbs was merrily crackling away.
And now, as if reading his mind (despite the fact that Dean knew Cas had done no such thing), the angel had handed Dean the ability to request the specific punishment that he felt he could handle and deserved, neatly gift-wrapped.  It was an opportunity too serendipitous to pass up, a way for Dean to tell Cas that he wanted to try upping the ante even further without having to find a way to set up the conversation.
“Dean,” Castiel says dryly, “I smell more like horseshit than actual horseshit does.  I don’t,” he adds, as Dean laughs so hard he has to bend over, “think you have anything to apologize for.  And if you’re so keen for a wash, it might interest you to know that I was actually gonna ask if you minded if we waited long enough to get on the trail for me to take a quick bath myself, put on some clean clothes.”
When the plan finally occurs, it pops up fast and fully formed, and Castiel doesn’t hesitate.  He can’t afford to.
Okay, that was a little weird, but before Dean could probe more deeply, Sam started swatting at his shoulder excitedly and Dean had to turn around to squeal a little more.  He was
A thought struck Dean just as he was lifting the first of them toward his mouth, and he paused, grimacing.  “Wait, was there enough for Sam, or is he gonna be pounding down the door demanding food in five minutes?”
Cas rose abruptly, a little smile on his face.  “On that note, perhaps you will consent to come with me.”
“Mmmm.”  Under the circumstances, he thought that was actually a pretty damn coherent response.  Cas certainly didn’t object.  The silence rang out for another few moments while his brain really settled to the task of reassembling itself into some semblance of order.  Finally, Dean expanded upon his previous commentary.  “Mmm…how long?”
Sam, bless him, doesn’t even blink at this, just nods and extends a hand.  Stuart climbs aboard with Dean still astride his back.  Before Sam can lift them, though, Cas sets a tiny hand on one of his fingers, pausing him.  For the first time since rebuking him for interrupting, Cas meets Dean’s eyes and speaks to him.
rover’s twitter account (leaving aside the fact that even Mars rovers apparently had twitter now, while Dean was still staunchly refusing to jump on the bandwagon).  There were dozens of pictures taken by Oppy, modified with text to thank her for her hard work.  It was an outpouring like Dean had rarely seen before, even at the death of beloved public figures.  An entire planet coming together to remember one golf-cart sized little engine that could.
“I don’t suppose you have any idea how to make that happen?” Dean hazards, figuring if he did he’d have told Cas already, but willing to give it a go anyhow.
Dean cries out loudly, his involuntary writhing precisely as ineffective as it always is in this circumstance.  He can feel the very start of moisture gathering in the corners of his eyes, and while he really did have every intention of taking this spanking with good humor and ready acceptance, it’s one thing to decide that while face up and another to stick to such resolutions when the other end is uppermost.  “Cas, sir,
“I lied.  The answer is never, Sam.  You’re never living it down.”
okay, no matter what Sam said) and one who was completely hopeless, Dean finally threw in the towel and flatly refused to play another hand.
“No, I don’t,” Cas agrees, stealing another kiss, “you insufferable brat.”
Cas, who was spending more time watching them than the window, a small amused smile on his face, seemed a great deal calmer than either Dean or Sam after the initial shock had passed.
“But the splinters kept breaking.  They weren’t sturdy enough.  It wouldn’t work.  The cuffs were just loose enough that I knew I could slip them if I could get my thumbs out of the way, and it’s not like this was the first time we’ve dislocated something to get ourselves out of tight spots,” This was true enough, but those had always been life-threatening situations.  This was just…Dean didn’t have words, and Sam went on.  “Once I was out, I kicked the wreckage of the bucket under the blankets so you guys wouldn’t accidentally step on them and do yourselves any damage,” oh, for fuck’s sake, he had actually gone to that trouble while in incredible pain to ensure that neither Dean nor Cas got a fucking splinter?  Well, fuck Dean sideways with a cactus.  Twice.  In the ear.
“Nearly 6:30, I believe,” Cas tells him, “and it has been quite a full afternoon.”
he squeaks warningly, and Sam sighs.
“So impatient.  Don't tempt me, or I might take you dry.”
Sure enough, when Cas murmured in his ear, the growl was an order that did not even allow for the possibility of disobedience.
There it was.  That familiar swirling in Dean’s lower gut.  The slightly anxious but not-unpleasant anticipation that preceded a scene, especially one in which they were doing something new.  Dean didn’t realize he was squirming a little until he saw the almost imperceptible quirk of Cas’s lips.
Dean realized almost immediately upon registering that fact that Cas must have been working extremely hard, likely for a long time now, to conceal his desires from Dean.  This was almost certainly because Cas believed that if Dean knew what he truly wanted, Dean would bend over backward to give it to him, even if it was far more than Dean truly wanted.
“The first thing you will need to know is that very shortly, I’m going to fuck you.  That is not a choice.  That is a fact.”
They wended down three hallways before arriving at Cas’s destination, a small wooden door tucked into a corner.  Its hinges squealed in protest when the angel pulled it open before extending his hand in a clear ‘after you’ gesture.
That ain’t what he pulls out, though.
“You ain’t dead yet,” Castiel says shortly, “and anyway, outlawry for the sake of profit is one thing.  Wanton cruelty for its own sake is quite another.”
Stuart rises and stretches but turns to Dean, nosing at his hand lightly.  Since he doesn’t speak rat, Dean can’t tell if this is just some comfort or if it’s Stuart checking in on whether Dean is okay with him leaving.  Either way, he strokes the soft fur lightly, then nods, “it’s okay, Stuart.  And—whatever you hear, I’m okay.  Really.  I’ve got it coming to me.”
And those things, he couldn’t have.
With that brief introduction sorted, please continue to the main event*
“Hey, those were
He didn’t realize that tears had been standing in his eyes until he felt one leak out and soak into the soft padding of the blindfold.  It scarcely seemed worthy of notice, his attention too wrapped up in the fall of the belt, which Cas seemed to be wielding with no less force now that he was revisiting areas he’d already attended to.
“What do you think you’ll do with yourself?” Dean asks a couple hours after Uriel’s nude performance.  He knows he’s dozed some more because he can just see the dark grey of impending dawn tingeing the sky in the east.
Sam frowned, clearly thinking about whether maybe there was a cache he had tucked away from Dean at some point, then shook his head, sighing.  “Nope, don’t think so.  I gave up on hiding beer from you about eight years ago.  You’re like a goddamn bloodhound when it comes to that stuff.”
Cas stares at him, looking more concerned than ever, actually reaching up a hand to feel Dean’s forehead, presumably gauging his temperature.  “Was that a
Cas grimaces a little.  He asks too much—no matter how much he’s done for Dean, he’s still a Novak and it ain’t fair to ask them to put him up.  “Sorry,” he says, “wasn’t thinking.  I can head on to Perry or Lawrence once you’re squared away, find a bed there for the night before I ride on.”
Feeling much relieved, Dean closes the lid of the toilet, grimacing a little as he remembers that his poor, long-suffering biglittle brother is going to have to deal with that situation—and any other ones that arise.
Cas gets with the program mighty quick now that he knows they’re both on the same page, his own hands starting their own exploration, mapping the curves and planes of Dean’s back and sides, skating over the muscles of his chest and then the hint of softness at his belly.  Dean gasps into the kiss as Castiel’s hand ventures a little further down, finding the cock he had but a moment to admire earlier, no longer quite so soft.  It is thickening and lengthening, hot with the thrum of blood that stiffens it further in Castiel’s hand.
Silence, then…is that
The jeans that had narrowly missed being decorated with the evidence of Castiel’s ministrations were uncomfortably compressing Dean’s cock, and he damn near made a fatal mistake.  His left hand was twined with Cas’s, and he didn’t want to break the connection.  His right hand was a spare few inches from his crotch when something in Cas’s breathing stopped him short, and he realized with seconds to spare what he had been about to do.  Granted, his cock was covered by his jeans, but Dean was pretty sure Cas would consider that a technicality in assessing whether Dean had violated the whole right-hand-cock ban.  Curling his fingers ineffectually into a fist, Dean returned his hand to the armrest.  Cas’s head lifted from his shoulder and the lips again settled against his ear just long enough for a low, caressing murmur.
Well, shit.  When he put it that way…
“Thank you for your honesty,” Cas told him, a slight smile in his voice, “but be aware that in the future if I find that you have neglected your own well-being, I reserve the right to cancel any planned scene.  Am I clear?”  The tone in his voice told Dean that arguments would not be appreciated.
doing its job beautifully and outlasting its initial mission length, it was never equipped with the ability to return to Earth.  It is stranded there, and will continue to explore until it is irreparably damaged or gets stuck and is unable to extract itself, at which point it will likely be buried by Martian dust eventually.  It does its best to keep its spirits up, however.  On its first birthday in August of 2013, it sang Happy Birthday to itself,” he told Dean with such naked affection that Dean had to hide a smile.
Suddenly the room was a great deal darker.  Not
It probably did.
Cas nodded, reaching forward and tugging Dean’s sweatpants down to mid-thigh, letting his cock spring free.  Producing a small bottle of lube from one of his pockets, Cas poured a few drops into his palm before wrapping his hand around Dean’s cock.  It only took five or six strokes before he was stiffening and lengthening to full hardness.
“Such a naughty thing to do, turning something so well-intended into something…malicious,” Cas’s tone of voice told Dean that he did not actually think there had been any true malice in Dean’s actions, and was merely employing a bit of hyperbole, “I ought to punish you for it.  In fact, I could easily tell you that’s what this is.  That your ass is upturned across my knee because you were naughty, and naughty boys get spankings…but that would be lying.”
Chapter-specific tags/warnings: Teacher/Student role-play (implication is that both characters are over the legal age of consent, but WITHIN the role play it can certainly be read as dubcon.  Again, that's a role play, Dean and Cas both consent ENTHUSIASTICALLY to all of the proceedings), butt plugs, spanking, manhandling, humiliation, discussion of a domestic discipline type teacher/student relationship, and let's face it, the pretty clear indication that Dean and Cas are gonna be doing some more of this.  Whether or not we'll actually get to SEE that at some point in the future remains unclear.
“Better.  Pretty sure I can make it to the library for breakfast if you think you can help me stand up.”
In related news, thanks for all of the wonderful comments on last chapter!  You've got no idea how much I love the fact that y'all are enjoying this as much as I am.  As Cas would say:
A moment later, the bed shifted slightly as a weight settled on it from the other side, and then Cas’s warm, strong, naked body (wait, when had that happened?) was pressed against Dean’s side.
Grunting in frustration, Cas cracks a single eye open just enough to confirm that yes, the cat is indeed sniffing frantically at Castiel’s ear and the side of his face.
“That is not a question answerable in the time we have before Sam will grow impatient and ignore my warning not to look under here, and it would be best for now if he did not catch sight of Gregor,” Cas interrupts, and Dean sighs.
want to discuss yesterday’s incident(s), Dean padded past, pouring himself a generous cup of coffee in the kitchen before he returned to the library and settled down across the table from his brother.
Ominously, there’s been no sign of Amara in close to a month.  Nothing at all since the blood-stained message etched in the flesh of Cas’s chest, back when it still belonged to Cas.  Neither of them is foolish enough to think that someone or something else has managed to take care of her, and after talking in circles for days, they are no closer to coming up with any reason that makes sense to explain her radio silence.  Honestly, they have jack shit, and they both know it.
There’s something about this plea that is very different from the desperate begging Dean’s already been doing.  Cas recognizes it and responds, stopping.
portion of our lives together.”
You are the righteous man.  You are
Just to really add insult to injury, he dreamed about sex with Cas, in about fifty different ways and positions.
“You have my word.”
“Then might I inquire exactly what you’re doing,” Cas says, mild bewilderment in his voice.  Dean darts a quick glance over his shoulder, imparting his voice with just enough ‘duh,’ to make it clear Cas is being dim but not enough to get him in trouble for being a dick.
“You got it, boss,” Castiel tells Michael, yawning again purely for an excuse not to meet his cousin’s eyes.  He thinks if he does, he’s likely to snap, no matter how hard he’s fought for control.
Cas huffs, making it clear that the ‘him’ in question is still firmly in Cas’s own personal doghouse, despite the passage of several millennia since the incident in question, “and you were not there.  You cannot imagine how frustrating it is to attempt to make such a thoroughly irrational, stubborn creature see reason.”  Every line in his face makes it clear that he deeply regrets telling Dean the story in question at all, particularly now, as they rehash territory they’ve gone over at least several hundred times in the past six months.
Cas positively beams at him, then carefully scoops up both kitten and puppy and transfers them to Dean’s arms, where they both loll sleepily, blinking up at Dean with droopy eyes that make his throat tighten with the sweetness of them.
By the time Cas pauses for his first break, Dean is breathing hard, hands clenched into fists beside his head, feet still planted on the cardboard floor only by virtue of a lifetime of building his pain tolerance.
start this.”
He honestly kind of expected an argument and a half between Cas and Sam about who gets to sleep with them the first night (he knows better than to even begin to try insisting that the animals won’t be allowed on their beds and honestly, after watching all of that cute all evening and without the worry of his cat allergy on board, he can’t say he actually minds the idea of the two of them sleeping with him and Cas), but as it turns out, Sam immediately signs off on the idea that it’s important for Dean to get as much quality time as possible with the cat until he settles on the proper name, and everybody’s already on board with the idea that the two shouldn’t be forcibly separated, even overnight.  Sam and Eileen head off to bed around 11, Sam scooping up the puppy for goodnight kisses while Eileen snags the kitten.  Dean watches, both charmed and amused as they then switch, stocking up on pet snuggles in advance of a whole eight or nine hours (no seriously, they legitimately get like
“Hold that thought,” He tells his nephew, and stands to poke his head out of the tent to holler.  “Michael!  Uriel!  Get your backsides in here, we gotta talk plans!”
“Anything you wish to say to me?” Cas inquires, his voice far too composed for someone who has to be working up a sweat, as hard as he’s swinging that heavy strap.
you did not just scold me for having sex with my own boyfriend in my own house without giving advance warning to the pack of creepers we didn’t know were using our lives as
he grumbles sleepily, eyes already losing the battle to stay open.
“Yeah, it’s definitely on the list of things that disturb me, but that list is getting pretty long at this point.”
He has to pause for a second at the next fork, briefly uncertain of whether he should be bearing soft left or taking the hard left, and the goddamned voice in his ear (
Welp.  There it was.  Dean looked toward Cas, proud as hell of himself, only to find the angel staring at him with an expression of exasperated disbelief.  Dean’s expression immediately morphed to a glare as he silently demanded of the angel,
By the time Cas finally leaned down to brush his lips across the top of Dean’s head, he was so close to sleep that the most he could manage was a low hum of utter contentment.
In other news, we really are nearing the end this time.  No joke, no takesies backsies.  I can guarantee three more chapters at minimum, but unless another story arc comes out of nowhere and splatters me against the ruins of my plans, we're actually for realsies within five chapters of finishing up.  I know that's gonna make some of you sad--it makes me kinda sad, too--but I promise we're gonna have fun on our way there.
And yet, when the angel asked the question, there could be no doubt what the answer was.
I'm saying this at both the beginning and the end:
“So I had gathered,” Cas tells him gravely, then starts to run his fingers through the hair at the base of Dean’s skull.  “Rest awhile, love.”
Oh, shots fired.  Dean wasn’t sure he really had a comeback to that one, either.  Especially since it was still a lot more recent than the demon blood.  He settled for grumbling under his breath, and Sam grinned and laced his hands behind his head.  “Good talk.”
Angel mojo was definitely responsible for the fact that somehow, in the split second before his knees hit the very hard floor, there was suddenly a pillow where there hadn’t been one before.  He couldn’t bring himself to say something snide about it, since he could’ve easily cracked his kneecaps landing that hard without the aid of the pillow.  Instead, he simply raised his face upward and quirked an ironic brow at Cas.
Stepping away from the door, Dean reached down to snag his sweatpants, settling them back around his hips before he took a couple steps forward, crowding into Cas’s space.  The angel’s brows lifted in pleased surprise when Dean’s lips brushed against his own.  Rather than letting Dean step back as he had intended, Cas’s arms snugged around his waist (carefully settling just north of where the stinging reddened flesh ended) and drew him back in for a much more thorough kiss.  Dean was only too happy to settle his body against Cas’s, sliding his arms up the firm chest and around his neck.  Cas broke the kiss before Dean started to get too breathless (one of the hazards of kissing someone who didn’t actually require oxygen) and they stood with foreheads pressed together.  Dean could feel some of the frustrated fury that had been leaking out of Cas’s very pores easing up and felt his own equilibrium start to return with the contact.  He let the silence spin out comfortably between them for a time before finally, somewhat reluctantly, breaking it.
“It seems to me,” Cas went on, “that you are very much in need of this.  You’re very lucky I’ve taken it upon myself to ensure that you receive adequate…guidance…in appropriate behavior.  In fact,” the slight smile in his voice expanded now, so that Dean could
Stuart blinks at Dean once or twice, but before he can gather his wits about him enough to respond, an iron hand is clamping around Dean’s elbow and hauling him back toward the door of the house.  “If you’ll excuse us just a moment, gentlemen,” Cas says pleasantly, but there’s an undercurrent of steel to his voice that makes Dean’s ass clench pre-emptively.
the brick wall that was Cas cracked open enough for him to nod earnestly when Sam glanced at him.
Hey, if you're still around, do me a favor and say a thing.  I am drooling for feedback after so long without interacting with all you wonderful fuckers.
“Are you—I mean—that’s—“ Dean splutters, caught between sounding offended and like he’s about to completely lose it again.
This time, he was unaware he’d lost time until he heard Cas’s voice again, something in the tone telling him that it wasn’t the first time he’d spoken.
Sam’s booming voice is so painfully loud that Dean actually has to slap his hands over his ears, craning his neck to look up at his brother.
The pressure on Dean’s shoulder suddenly increased until it was just this side of uncomfortable.
with him.
“I can,” the angel says, “also use my grace to clean you, Dean.  It might be simpler.”
“Dean, has flattery ever actually won you cookie points?”
He had many hours while Dean slept, and he’s used them to cook up some plans.
“I will not go far,” he says, “only to the library and back.”  There’s a look of such fierce determination on his face that Dean can’t bring himself to argue more, even if he’s pretty sure this isn’t gonna be much more successful than the healing.
purpose.”
As it happens, he’s right.  Cas’s hand, which has already seen a fair amount of action today, gets right back to work cracking against Dean’s ass and thighs mercilessly.  The smacks fall hard and fast and with little rhyme or reason, and Dean is whimpering and pleading for mercy by the time Cas hits twenty.  “Ow ow ow ow, Cas, okay, please, I’m sorry, I’ll do it, I’m sorry, ow, shit,
“I meant,” he said, “for you to leave, Sam.”
He couldn’t totally avoid the scrape of the fabric against his ass, and hissed out an involuntary breath, letting the pants fall to the floor.  Taking a step toward the angel, he chose to maintain some scrap of dignity by grumbling.
may have pulled the trigger on Raphael did it honorable.  Right through the heart, he was dead before he hit the dirt.  I can respect that kind of man, even if I’ve no earthly idea which member of your gang it was.”  Dean blinks at him, gaze moving quickly back and forth between Castiel’s eyes, as if once again trying to sort out a mystery that just don’t make a lick of sense.  It ain’t the first time Cas has seen such a look on a face turned toward him.  “Now how about we get the rest of your dinner into you?”
“I didn’t ask for your input,” Cas tells him, but there’s a smile in his voice as he continues the spanking.  The burn in Dean’s ass is intensifying, and by the time Cas focuses at least a dozen harsh swats on his upper thighs, Dean can feel his eyes start to prickle.  “Now say you’re sorry.”
“Do you…want to tell me about it?” Sam says, and it’s not so much an expression of curiosity as an offer of a listening ear.  Still, there’s plausible deniability here.  Dean can—if he wants to, if he thinks he can manage it—confide in Sam a little, maybe shed some small amount of the weight of the past several weeks, under the guise of filling Sam in on how they worked the case.
See you next week, and come find me on
Sam leapt out of bed in a crouch, swinging a knife at the unknown assailant, then breaking into a fit of sneezes as the pillow he’d just slashed wide open promptly produced a small volcanic eruption of goose down all over him.  Dean laughed so hard he had to lean against the doorjamb for support as Sam coughed and spat, dropping the knife to frantically swipe tiny feathers out of his hair.  By the time the kid finally caught his breath, after most of the down settled into little snowdrifts on the floor, Dean was wiping tears from his eyes.  Sam took in a deep breath, scowling down at the sad-looking remnants of the pillow before rounding on Dean.
Back outside, Stuart and Gregor, conversing in hushed tones, turn immediately, going silent as Dean and Cas emerge.  Stuart’s nose wriggles in their general direction as Gregor waves a friendly antenna in a manner Dean recognizes from pre-elixir as greeting.  Nothing about this strikes Dean as strange (which, to be fair, is probably a pretty concise statement on his life’s current strangeness quotient)—but it’s clearly gonna take some time to accustom himself to the chorus of voices that accompanies the familiar gestures.
Dean squirmed his head away, swatting at Cas ineffectually before he responded with a laugh, “not wise so much as experienced.  I’ve spent nearly the past 40 years being pissed off at shit I can’t control.  If I didn’t learn a couple things along the way, I’d have gone around the bend a long-ass time ago.”
“Elisabeth Kϋbler-Ross wrote a book in which she hypothesized that people experience five emotional stages when experiencing grief or preparing for a loss.”
“No fucking
His small sound, the way the strength briefly went out of his limbs—these things inspired no mercy in Cas.
The angel had his determined face on, telling Dean that there was no point to arguing against anything he’d dictated.  But since when had Dean accepted when things were hopeless?
“Yeah, he’s right here, Cas.  Come closer, you just can’t see him because he’s--”
Last month, I was privileged to spend a weekend with some of the most wonderful voices in the Supernatural fandom.  They are all authors in their own right, albeit some in different ways than others.  Bella,
he demands, “
The silence continued to spin out, Cas taunting him even further by slowing the roll of his hips until he settled down, fully seated on Dean’s cock, and moved no more.  Dean whimpered in protest and plea, hands tightening and loosening involuntarily around Cas’s hips.  It was with gargantuan effort that he managed to keep his own ass flush with the bed, resisting the
Dean scrambles backward on the bed until his back is plastered against the wall, and he only dimly registers the intense ache inside his ass, the one that will turn his stomach every time he moves until it finally fades away in three or four days.
Dean didn’t even register choosing to speak, but heard his own voice and knew the words to be sincere.  “Green, Sir.
“—haven’t raised my—“
Once he felt steady enough, he opened his eyes, shook his shoulders out, and climbed back off the bed, stripping out of his clothes.  He desperately needed a shower and a shave after sleeping for the better part of a day, and maybe the hot water would help him clear his head.  Maybe it would help him figure out his next move, figure out how to fix this.
“I have been made aware of that, yes,” Cas confirmed dryly, and Dean registered yet again that he was finally really getting the hang of sarcasm, before wondering exactly how much more insufferable that would make the angel, “but we are not infrequently called to work with him, and I see no reason that professional relationships cannot be friendly.”
“You actually are, though, you’re just not showing me
By the time the rhythmic thudding that heralds Sam’s return starts to shake the floor, Dean doesn’t really give a shit what Sam’s brought him as long as it’s edible and there’s something to drink along with it.  It’s occurred to him in the last couple minutes that annoying Sam just before he went to get Dean something to eat is maybe not the single smartest thing he’s ever done.  Luckily Sam doesn’t tend to be the vengeful type (not like Dean himself).
Understanding was starting to grow in Cas’s eyes, his brows climbing on his forehead.  Dean expected him to immediately veto the idea but, not for the first time, Cas surprised him, narrowing his eyes and starting to nod, a slow smile spreading across his face as he spoke, “And the fifth is Acceptance.  You know, I think you might just be onto something, Dean.”
Dean’s hand had barely slid three inches toward his ass before the voice rang out sharply, “Oh, no.  No rubbing.  You know better than that.  Who’s the only one who gets to touch your ass after a spanking?”
“Someone is here to see you.”
understand.  Despite this not being a punishment, Cas is going to hold him to protocol, clearly aware that there is comfort in the ritual, in being held to certain standards of behavior.
Okay, Dean was intrigued.  His cock, which was every bit as interested in the proceedings as it had been while buried in the angel’s mouth, twitched again at the sultry promise in Cas’s tone.
“Really not fair to tease Etienne like that, though.”
Eventually, while still producing moans that he thought were far less impressive than Cas’s continued recitations (which Dean couldn’t even think about without dissolving into hilarity—the
But that, like almost everything else, would have to wait.  For now, the only thing on Dean’s radar, the only thing in the universe, was the violently trembling angel in his arms.  Dean hadn’t been wrong a day and a half ago when his instincts told him that this was what Cas needed.  He’d just had the timing a little off.
Cas’s face has settled into much sterner lines, and he raises a single challenging brow at Dean, the message clear:
And while I can’t speak for Dean, I’ve never trusted you more with him than I do now, because I know that you can skirt the edge of your control and still hang onto it.  You can be furious and still manage not to do something irreversible.”
So right off the bat, without even having to think about it, Dean knows a number of useful things.
sits uncomfortably on him atop an already impressive pile of roiling emotions, and it turns out that’s the straw that breaks the hunter’s back.
Dean rolled himself up from the floor to lean over the table along with Cas.
By the time he finished, Cas was seated cross-legged against the headboard, patiently waiting.  When Dean turned to him, licking the last little bit of runny cheese off of his fingers, Cas handed over a paper towel from God only knew where, which Dean accepted with a nod, wiping both mouth and hands and sighing contentedly.
Cas goes with his urging and the slow, careful penetration is cut off when a single sharp jerk of Cas’s hips buries the remainder of him inside Dean to the hilt.
Dean makes a sound that he will resolutely insist is not a squeak (or at least not more of a squeak than every other damn sound he makes at the moment) at suddenly finding himself ass up over Cas’s lap.  He ends up in this precise position often enough that it really shouldn’t ever come as a surprise, but somehow Cas still manages to catch him off-guard.  “Yeah,” he says breathlessly, wriggling a hell of a lot more than he would dare to if he were actually being punished, “pretty much that.”
Castiel’s nose screws up, just exactly as a man’s does before he sneezes.
“I should refrain from punishing you more often,” Cas complimented himself with quiet enjoyment, “it is so freeing to be unbound by any need to draw the appropriate remorse from you.  I can simply carry on until your ass is begging so desperately to be fucked that I cannot resist its siren’s song.”
In which Dean makes a decision about his punishment (and in the process finally reveals a long-hidden secret to Cas), and Sam is unsurprisingly still creepy.  Sadly, there's no food.
Again, he is bathed in sweat, but he doesn’t bother to shower.
In his current state, Dean didn’t have a chance in hell of fighting and winning the monumental battle to shove it back where it belonged.
“Did you know,” Gregor inquires darkly, apparently bearing the Winchesters no ill will and having already moved on, “that average, untampered-with cockroaches can survive for up to a week with no head?  I can assure you that this is accurate, having lost mine to a separate but unfortunate incident and for some unknown reason finding it necessary to wait until the point of ‘death’ for its regeneration.  It was…a challenging week.”
Some time later, freshly showered and laying together on the bed, Dean’s arms snugly holding the angel against his chest, the strain of the last 36 hours started to catch up with him.  Waves of exhaustion rolled in to capture him, but before they dragged him down, he lazily rolled his neck to nuzzle his face tenderly against the mussed head resting in the crook of his neck.
It’s totally sinking in.
“Now can you spank me?”
covered boundaries with him.  That, maybe more than anything else, annoyed Dean.  If Sam figured out what was going on here it could easily destroy all the progress they’d made in their recent conversation, and Dean wouldn’t have that.
Granted, it wasn’t nearly as different from his normal uniform as Dean’s clothing was, but still.  The angel wore his customary suit and white shirt, but there was a neatness and precision to it that it generally lacked.  While Cas certainly hadn’t had the time to iron it, it nevertheless hung off of him, pristine and with razor-sharp creases.  The white shirt also looked pressed and starched, fastened to the very top and—here was the big one—his normal blue tie had been replaced by a much staider dark grey one with burgundy pinstripes.  That was surprising enough, but when you considered that it was tied perfectly, snug around his throat, and facing forward—well.  Add in that his hair was neatly combed and gelled and he was wearing a pair of horn-rimmed glasses (where the hell had even
But Dean wasn’t.
“Yep, everything’s all good, guys,” Dean assures them, smiling kindly.  Gregor visibly relaxes (the fact that Dean can recognize easily what “visibly relaxing” looks like in cockroach is a whole other can of wor—okay, bad analogy.  A whole other ball of wax, then), but there’s still something a little uneasy in the tilt of Stuart’s head, so Dean steps forward to scratch behind the rat’s ear.  It’s something Cas has taught him over the years—that when words won’t suffice, especially where reassurance is concerned, often touch does the job—and it’s as true now as it is when Cas uses it to rescue Dean from a deeper dive than usual into self-loathing.  The rat tilts his head into Dean’s hand affectionately, the thread of tension in him seeming to ease.  They remain like this for a few minutes, the tactile connection as clear a demonstration of Dean’s affection and regard as anything, and it’s only when he catches a slight movement from the corner of his eye that he turns to see Cas and Gregor standing side by side.  The former is smiling warmly at them and hell if he could say how he knows it, but Dean’s pretty damn sure the latter is too.
“You know, for somebody who’s always given me shit about my table manners, I think you’ve just lost that right forever,” Dean adds as Sam finishes chewing and swallows.
Dean’s breath shuddered in and out, head spinning as he tried to figure out exactly how this moment had so entirely gotten away from him.  He couldn’t remember how it had started and it didn’t especially seem to matter now.
They should’ve known it was too good to be true.  A small and embarrassed voice snaked out of—the fucking wall?
Dean was too busy stuffing his face to come up with a verbal rejoinder, and instead settled for a rude gesture that required only the hand that wasn’t currently wielding a spoon.  Sam laughed, but any response he might’ve offered was forestalled by Cas’s reappearance with a box of some fiber-oat-cardboard shit Sam loved which claimed to be cereal.  Dean took the liberty to doubt these claims, after the one time he’d run out of Frosted Flakes and been reduced to trying it.  He’d ended up eating cold and slightly suspect pizza for breakfast instead, that day.  It was even worth the noise he’d had to hear from Sam about wasting his breakfast wood chips to avoid finishing a bowl of it.
“Arch your back.  Stick that ass out.”  The orders are terse, snapping through the air more sharply than the crack of a whip.  Dean whimpers a little through the panties, torn between terror and half-unwilling desire.  What is Cas up to?  Is he in more trouble?  What did he do wrong?  Was it the drifting?  Does Cas know that he lost track of time, that he didn’t remain entirely focused on his bad behavior?  Oh, God, what else can he possibly be planning?  He’s had Dean with his face in a corner for what has to be at least a half hour, and the sharp, heavy sting in his ass has faded to a deep throb.  Is Cas planning on renewing the sting?
The next vibration is a hell of a lot less subtle, and now Dean is absolutely certain.  Someone is in the ventilation system with him, much too heavy to be the skitter of an insect or the scrabble of a rodent, and there’s only one other human (well, humanoid) in the bunker with him.
nice and proper.”
“Mmmm, Mr. Winchester, so tight.  You fit me like a glove.  I do believe we may have found a new way of disciplining you moving forward.”
Making a beeline (or the closest thing he could manage to a beeline in his current state) for the pills, Dean grabbed them and tossed them back with a swallow of water.  Only when the cold liquid slid down his throat did he realize how desperately thirsty he had been, and he went ahead and kept drinking until he’d put away well over half of the glass.  He emerged, panting slightly but able to feel his brain start to sharpen a little.  Dehydration certainly hadn’t helped either his fuzziness or the headache, and with the combination of ibuprofen and water, he was really hoping he might start to feel like a person again at some point in the near future.
Dean was momentarily dazzled by the brightness of the lights within, blinking several times in rapid succession.  The large space was quite warm, suggesting to Dean that part of the reason Cas had wanted several hours to go by was so that he could turn up the temperature in here a few degrees.  Two hours was more than long enough to ensure that the heat permeated the entirety of the room, so that Dean would not be chilled while they scened.
Dean would definitely be willing to tell that particular policy to take a flying leap under the current circumstances, but there’s no point.  No place in Lebanon has access to the kind of technology that will give them results as quickly as they need.  No place anywhere nearby does.  Hell, the entire county has a population under 4000.  The nearest city with a decent-sized police department is Lincoln, Nebraska, and that’s a three-hour drive.
This isn’t that universe.
The hand that wrapped around the back of Dean’s neck wasn’t harsh or admonishing.  Quite the contrary, it settled there with incredible gentleness, and when it squeezed, there was nothing punitive in the gesture.  Instead, it was reassurance.  It was a reminder that Dean had been right; Cas had him.
Cas curled a little deeper into Dean’s embrace, his shoulders trembling harder as the first audible sobs shook loose, sounding like the kind of bone-deep, exhausting tears that cleanse.
“By whom, Dean?” The voice rang out, a little too patiently, from behind him.  He whirled to take in Cas, whose face was a stony mask clearly intended to conceal whatever was actually going on behind his unreadable eyes, “Exactly who or what do you suppose could have gotten into the impenetrably warded bunker that even an angel of the Lord cannot currently get
traumatized.  Winchesters pick up and move on.  They pick themselves the fuck up, and they move the fuck on, because that’s how it has to be.
He was right, too.  Dean’s hands went to the robe’s tie, unfastening it and allowing it to fall open.  Once he’d provided that wordless consent, Cas stepped forward, gently sliding the robe down his shoulders and hanging it on a hook on the back of the door.  Dean turned to head for the bed, but was stopped by a gentle hand wrapping around his bicep.  He started to turn toward the angel, a snappish retort about Cas needing to make up his mind on his tongue, but he was forestalled when Cas simply drew Dean inward, wrapping strong arms around him.
“That all you got?” he taunts Uriel, who responds with another punch to the gut.
He could do this.
And finally, all of you jerks who have admitted to bargaining with Crowley to keep me at this, you're all fired.  Because of your interference, my damn muse has me chained up in her basement and is threatening to keep me here indefinitely.   Turns out she's a scary bitch when she wants to be, and it's cold as fuck down here.  Send blankets and maybe a bolt cutter while you're at it.  First person to smuggle me out without her seeing gets to give me a prompt.
“—without me feeling deprived.”
Not when his own sleeping mind has betrayed him, has dragged him back to a place he vowed never to visit again, never to think about, never to look directly at.  It is right there, right in front of him, as sharp and clear and real as the empty room around him, as if Lucifer threw his last barb and finally walked out the door just moments ago, and not months.
Stuart’s nose wiggles in a way that speaks of mischief to Dean, and he grins back at the rat.  “Start thinking about what kind of treat you might like,” he tell Stuart, “because you’ve got something awesome coming to you for today.  My hero.”
“BELIEVE—“ Sam wasn’t the only one who was having a hard time believing.  It wasn’t like Dean could move, what with being chained to the table, but to be honest, he wasn’t sure he’d have been able to move even if he wasn’t fastened.  This took over from the German nightmare cat in a hat as the weirdest thing that had ever happened to him, hands down.
stretched enough to render the entry manageable without undue effort.
He’s not wrong.
He’d just reached back to press a single fingertip against one of the stripes (the spot blanched white and then immediately filled in brilliant red, much as a severe sunburn would), the pressure drawing a quiet hiss of breath from him, when the door opened fully and the angel stepped in (he, unlike Dean, had pulled on a pair of sweatpants before leaving the room), pausing to shut and firmly lock it behind him.  Cas was still taking no chances on Sam interrupting them, even if the likelihood that he was sound asleep at this hour was quite high.
It took him a minute to realize the groan came from him rather than Cas, when the angel’s cock was finally seated fully inside him.  Dean’s ass settled onto his thighs and the groan was replaced by a tiny whimper.  He pressed his forehead against Cas’s, breathing hard, and the angel tightened his hands strongly around Dean’s waist and eased, just slightly, the pressure on his ass.
“D’you think we should…
Exactly what in an infinite number of tarnations, Dean wonders, was that about?
“Yeah, maybe,” Dean allows, eyes on the kitten, which is wriggling anxiously enough in Sam’s arms that he relents and sets it down, whereupon it promptly starts batting at the untied laces on one of Dean’s boots that rests on its side under the long table, “but it’d be even more unfair for him to go around saddled with the wrong name for life.  I’ll let you know when I figure out the right one.  And in the meantime,” he adds, ignoring the way both Sam and Cas are looking at him as if he’s making all of their dreams come true, “somebody put a bell on it or we’re gonna lose it in this maze.”
to join us.”  He is so clearly not speaking to Dean that this time, there’s no way to tamp down the hope that blossoms in his chest.  He manages somehow to speak through swollen lips, though he has to pause and spit out a mouthful of blood.
Of course I gotta check on him.  It’s just how I’m programmed.”
He hadn’t really had much time to think or get anxious about what was coming—he’d been too rushed to make sure he was ready—but those thirty seconds more than made up for his previous distraction.  By the time the door finally clicked open, Dean was practically vibrating with anticipation and nerves.  He was also totally unprepared for what awaited him.
Cas doesn’t seem to have gotten this memo, because a few moments later he tsks behind Dean.  “Now that isn’t so hard, is it?  I knew you could be a good boy for me,” he practically purrs, “and had you just been my good boy and stood in the corner when you were told, you would be done with your corner time now.  Instead that blushing bottom has another twenty minutes to go.”
Dean’s never been real good at resisting him, and now is no different.  It can’t be more than ten or fifteen seconds later that his cock is spilling over Cas’s hand.  Cas groans in appreciation and relief as he finally releases the shreds of control he’s been grasping onto, allowing himself to follow Dean over the edge, cock pulsing deep inside.
Sam stepped forward next, placing both of his hands on the door and leaning in to press against it with all of his strength.  The door twitched what couldn’t have been more than two millimeters and then settled back again.  Eyes narrowed in dawning realization, Cas waved Sam aside and pressed one calloused palm against the very center of the door, drawing on his strength and pushing.  The door shuddered and a crack of about half an inch appeared, snow immediately squeezing through the tiny gap like toothpaste from a tube.
By the time he goes to bed that night, he has almost managed to convince himself that the nightmare was an anomaly, a one-time thing sparked by giving Sam the blow-by-blow of the search for him.
“We definitely wanted to apologize, but we also thought that maybe, uh, given all the crap that’s happened in the past couple weeks, it would be good to have a general conversation about...” Dean floundered, trying to find the appropriate word that would transmit what he meant without alienating Sam.  Miracle of fucking miracles, Cas actually picked up the slack, speaking up to finish Dean’s sentence, which had been in some danger of hanging in limbo indefinitely,
You are not sick or twisted or any of the thousand other things that, in this moment, you believe yourself to be. Your distressing tendency toward self-hatred has overtaken you in a moment of great vulnerability.  What is happening to you right now is not born of any truth.  It is all lies, and it is
“I think maybe it hurts a little less?” Sam lies unconvincingly.  Cas glares up at him, not at all fooled (or amused) by the attempt to spare his feelings.  “Look, you’re a lot smaller than normal.  It makes sense that for the moment, maybe your grace has shrunk proportionally.  You were able to heal Dean’s ankle earlier, so you clearly still have your powers.”  He raises a good point, but Cas doesn’t look especially mollified.
“As you wish,” Cas agreed, releasing Dean’s wrist with a squeeze.  Dean rolled his shoulder a few times, then sat up, grinning.
Dean straightens, hand falling away from his mouth as a nearly-silent breath huffs from him.  That’s not
“And this looks like a really old version, right?”
AKA: The chapter in which your author discovers that she is entirely incapable of writing short smut scenes, and thus gifts you with two chapters today, instead of one.
“In all seriousness, Dean, my understanding from Gregor is that nobody is quite sure why Stuart speaks with an accent that approximates an Irish one, but—“
“Okay, I’ll grant you I don’t know a whole bunch about the average cockroach’s lifecycle, but—”  Cas lifts a hand to silence Dean, tilting his head to listen intently to whatever Gregor is saying.
“Yeah, I think we’re here for the duration,” Dean agreed, settling a hand on Cas’s back and rubbing it in soothing circles, “but we’ve got two laptops, the entire internet—including Netflix—a sauna, warm clothes, lots of food, and,” he added, nearly as an afterthought, “a whole hell of a lot of books.  I think we even have a pretty good collection of board games around here somewhere.  We’re actually in about the best possible place to be snowed in.  We’ll just call it a vacation.  We can make it a lock-in.  It’ll be fun.”
For a second, Dean even thinks that the laugh he just gave Cas (no matter how well-concealed) might have dimmed his ire enough to call a premature halt to the spanking so they can get on with fucking each other’s brains out.  After all, a good thirty seconds go by without the crack of flesh on flesh, and when Cas’s hand does return, it smooths almost delicately across the curve of Dean’s stinging ass.
regardless of (or perhaps because of) the pain that stole his breath away with each stroke.  Dean nodded confirmation, but the nonverbal cue wasn’t enough for Cas, who checked in again, “what’s your color, baby?”
Well.  Sort of.  Comfort was relative.  There was this ridge in the center of the hood that was kind of digging into his stomach and chest a little now, and it really was awfully
Dean says, quite certain he must have misheard.
“Yeah, I’ve been reading some of the accounts written by the archaeologists who made the discovery. Obviously, they don’t actually know what they’re looking at, but I’m pretty sure they’ve stumbled on a trove of ancient supernatural lore!  It’ll be months before they really catalogue what they’ve found and have it available online, though, which is really frustrating.  I’m stuck trying to sift through little scraps of pictures and information they’ve posted as examples, and seeing what I can fit together from that, so—“
He is
Cas didn’t make any moves immediately, but that was cool.  Dean was flying high today and nothing seemed to have the power to torpedo it.  Nothing more happened until a good half hour had passed and Dean had moved on in his one-man karaoke session from Zeppelin to Metallica while dusting books in the library.  He was so intent on his work (and let’s face it, on shaking his butt to the music, because why the hell not) that he didn’t actually spot the angel barreling around the corner toward him until Cas slammed into him, knocking him back into a bookshelf hard enough to rattle it.
“—are
In the meanwhile, Dean was finding that, rather than getting easier the longer he held pressure on his cheeks, the pain was increasing.  He forced himself to breathe evenly, reminding himself that they were clearly working toward what he had wanted—for Cas to fuck him.  The angel was simply providing Dean with a little preview of what that kind of pressure on his ass would feel like, likely to ensure that Dean still wanted to follow through (and, no doubt, because he truly was enjoying the sight Dean presented).
“Good call,” Sam told him, heading for the door.  He paused in the doorway, glancing back at the two of them, “and thanks again, Cas.  For the healing.  I’m really sorry about impaling you.”
“No, I’m not fucking alright!  I rolled out of bed and landed on my ass on the floor, and then my boyfriend decided to turn himself into an angelic battering ram for no goddamn reason I can figure!”
And just like that, Dean knows—not the details, of course, but the general shape of where Cas is going with this—and the knowledge sends his heartrate ratcheting skyward, the jolt of adrenaline quickening the breath that had just really started to slow.
“No problem.  I’m gonna do a little more reading before I call it a night, so if you need anything in the next hour or so I’ll be around.  If not, I’ll check on you in the morning.”
, because everything they do is spectacular.
The look of self-recrimination that washed over Cas’s face was so intense and so sincere that Dean could actually feel himself melting.  The angel spoke immediately, sounding as apologetic as Dean had ever heard him, “Dean.  Of course.  I’m so sorry.”  Cas rose from the bed, sliding a hand through Dean’s hair in regretful affection.  “I’ll be right back.”
“She will,” Dean confirmed, “and maybe nobody else knows that when things got hard for her up there, every now and then a friend came to remind her why it was worth it, but you do, and I do.  So thanks, Oppy, and thanks, Cas, on her behalf and on ours, for helping her along the way.”
The gravelly voice was raw with both tears and pain when it emerged.
Dean blinks, and in the split second in which his eyes close the throbbing is gone, his ankle returned to its normal size and shape.
“Let’s just continue,” Cas said, wincing a little, “and not take anything for granted.”
“You’ve got yourself a bargain,” he says enthusiastically, pausing to let Gregor scurry out of the nursery and down the hall toward the bedroom ahead of him, moving in the direction of the master bathroom right away.
Finally, just about the time Dean was pretty sure he was going to get a hell of a crick in his neck from the awkward angle at which it was being held, Cas released his hair.  Dean let his head fall back to the pillow, taking in a deep breath and releasing it as the fingernail withdrew.  He wasn’t foolish enough to think this was over, but he wasn’t going to turn down a chance to regain some semblance of composure.
They set to work on the same floor, figuring that however he’d managed it, it had to have taken Sam some time to get out and he couldn’t have gotten too far.  Despite a reasonably thorough search, there was no sign of him, and they paused at the stairs as they tried to decide whether to venture further down into the bowels of the bunker or head back up.
Despite the weight of his hand across his mouth, the sound of Dean’s harsh breathing seems deafeningly loud to himself, shattering the stillness of the storage room.
“We’re all out of salad stuff, huh?” Sam said sadly
“No way.  No
“Yes, message received, you’re definitely not feeling guilty,” Dean told him dryly, setting the bottle back down with slightly more force than necessary, “and thanks, but if it’s all the same to you, I think I’ll stand.”
This has been happening more and more often lately.  Dean will point out that something isn’t fair, or that Cas is holding him to a completely separate set of guidelines than he holds himself to and rather than debating with him or insisting that the situation is actually fair, Cas simply agrees with him.  It’s seriously cramping Dean’s style as far as arguing for clemency is concerned, cause what can you really say when the guy tanning your hide admits that he’s not being fair but fails to see said unfairness as any kind of deal-breaker?
Dean groans, long and low, sagging over Cas’s lap.  Another game?  There’s no way this ends well for him.  No fucking wa—  “Up,” Cas says, and Dean blinks stupidly down at the floor.
“There’s
“Ah, yes.  I am—or was, I suppose—familiar with Mr. Sinclair.  He was indeed a…unique sort of man.” Gregor says diplomatically, but Dean can hear the distaste underlying his words.  He doesn’t even want to
It shouldn’t be too difficult.
Cas remained in his chair, again steepling his fingers as he looked steadily at Dean.  “Not at all, Mr. Winchester, and I advise you to watch your language.  I will not be forgetting your disrespect.  I thought I had made our terms quite clear, but if you would prefer the 500 lines, I have several extra pads of paper, and I am not the one bound by a strict schedule.  The decision is entirely in your hands."
He has forgotten that this was his first refuge.
“Anna misses her family.  I know she do, because she sends me letters.  Did you know that?  Every few months she sends me a letter.  Sweet Anna.  I ain’t never responded—she made her bed of depravity and she knew what she was giving up when she abandoned us to live in sin with your brat—but oh, I could.  I could send her a nice letter, tell her how badly she’s missed.  How much I’ve come to regret cutting her off.  I could make it sound damn good.  I could invite her to come home—just for a visit, mind.  Tell her to bring her lady friend along.  It might take months to convince her it was safe, that I meant it.  Might take years, even—but eventually, I’d get there.  I won’t even have to go looking for little Charlie, Anna will bring her right to my door, and you know what I’m gonna do with her when she gets here?” Rhetorical the question may be, what with Dean being gagged, but Michael is having too much fun not to pause as if for a response.  When none is forthcoming other than the ragged sound of Dean’s furious breathing, Michael goes on, his enjoyment clear in his tone.  “Nothing,” he tells Dean, relishing the man’s surprised blink.  “I won’t do a damn thing to her—but I
His voice rises sharply in pitch as he suddenly finds himself soaring what looks like miles off the ground, jerked off his feet by the thumb and forefinger that have closed around the back of his flannel.
“Sam has also stepped on me,” the roach adds delicately. “Twice.”  Dean grimaces.
The idea of being caught and returned to the box so quickly, without having any kind of really solid adventure to speak of, is incredibly depressing.  After all the trouble he went to in order to escape, he at least deserves to get a good story out of it.  At the
Cas took the bare minimum amount of time needed to prep him, producing silicone-based lube from who-the-hell-knew-where (it wasn’t like he had pockets what with being completely nude, he’d probably conjured the stuff out of thin air.  Hey, thanks again, angel mojo) and fucking a pair of fingers into his ass three or four times before adding a third and repeating the motions.
Dean did not for half a second really believe that Cas would actually spank him with his ass in the shape he knew it must be, but the threat was compelling regardless.  His cock, whose morning wood had been solidly destroyed by the pain and shock of his brutal awakening, started to perk up, incorrigible bastard that it was.  Giving it a firm silent message to get its shit together, Dean grimaced and slid his thumbs into his waistband, very carefully sliding it down over his hips.
The sound of a single gunshot is familiar, and Dean’s initial reaction is irritation rather than alarm.  He’s been telling Garth for weeks that his favorite revolver shoots too easy and needs recalibrating.  Dean’s just opened his mouth to make sure he’s okay, that he didn’t get his own foot or his mount when the gun went off, when he hears the thud of a body hitting the ground—and it don’t come from Garth’s direction.
The fingers that were twined with Cas’s tightened precipitously.  Cas returned the squeeze unhesitatingly in the seconds before the tongue licked a slow, wet strip from the base of Dean’s cock to the tip.  He went from half hard to painfully erect in what had to be nanoseconds, biting into his lower lip nearly hard enough to draw blood to force himself to silence.  The tongue jabbed into the slit at the head of his cock and one of Dean’s legs jerked a little, involuntarily, causing Sam to again glance at him before looking back to the screen.  Damn.  He’d need to exert better self-control if he didn’t want to end up with a situation on his hands (one that would be a much larger pain in the ass, and feel a lot worse, than the situation currently on his dick).
Dean broke the awkward silence no less awkwardly.  “Yeah, uh, thanks Sammy,” he said uneasily, heading to the chair in question and proceeding to very, very carefully lower himself into it.  Sam, again, watched him like a hawk, until both Dean and Cas shot him glares of such potency that he chuckled and headed for the seat across the table from Dean.  Cas settled into the seat at the head of the table, and both of them latched their gazes onto Sam expectantly.
He held a cellophane packet of peanut butter crackers in one hand and a bag of Milano cookies in the other.  Either was a decent snack option, and neither was what had brought Dean up short.  No, what stopped Dean in his tracks was the expression on the angel’s face, a look of focus so intense and dedicated that he might have been selecting which wire to cut on a bomb that was bare seconds from exploding and taking all of Kansas with it rather than between high-fat, low-nutrition munchie options for movie watching.  He looked, Dean thought, as though he had never been tasked with a more important decision, as if Dean’s current and future happiness depended upon the angel making the correct call.
He’s got a chip halfway to his mouth when he’s struck with the unshakeable certainty that he is being watched.  A quick glance around confirms that Cas is still inside the house and Stuart, who finished his own meal a lot quicker than Dean, has curled up near the front door for a post-meal nap (which doesn’t actually sound like a terrible idea).  His next thought is that maybe Gregor’s come back, but that’s—that just doesn’t feel quite right.
“Is that so?  Well, far be it from me to deny you aid if you require it to hold to your new…guidelines.  Do go on.”
The hand that has been squeezing the base of his cock eases suddenly, starting to move, taking up a much slower but no less titillating rhythm than his pounding hips against Dean’s smarting ass.
“Uh, yeah, Sam, you probably want to—“
Dean feels like he ought to say something, defuse the tension somehow, but what the hell would he say?  He can’t lay his mind on any semi-humorous quip to break the moment, and seconds later Castiel finds his voice anyway, obviating the need for Dean to be the one to break the silence.
A specific, even-more-than-usual shout out to
Dean had to take a deep breath, but managed to maintain a straight face with considerable effort, simply raising his brows at Cas to inquire, “and what did you think?  Any similarities?”
“You two crazy kids have fun,” Dean tells them a little absently, already salivating at the thought of the seasonal spiced caramel glaze that covers the top of Pat-A-Cake’s already spectacular Apple Pie, still steaming slightly in the box.
In which bondage has more than one use, Cas would make a terrible handyman, and Dean makes him an offer he can't refuse.
Six hours and 8516 words later, you have this monstrosity.
Dean, who realized that he still had his hands under the warm water despite the fact that the soap had long since washed away, turned off the tap and reached for a hand towel only to find Sam holding one out to him, smiling in that semi-maniacal way that was starting to seem like it might be the new normal.  Dean took it somewhat unenthusiastically and dried his hands, before detouring to put it back on its normal hook.
“I understand, sir.”
It came as no surprise to either Dean when the vibrator suddenly hit its third speed.
He didn’t have long to muse about this, and any thoughts of inquiring fled his mind precipitously a second later.  If his brain hadn’t been entirely short-circuited by the unexpected wake-up, what happened next finished the job.
“I said the same thing,” he tells his brother as soon as Sam approaches close enough, “and yeah, apparently I’m not loud enough to be heard clearly over the phone.  What I was
“Dude, you know that at some point you’re gonna have to go back in there or risk starving.”
on you.”
Dean curses himself for a fool at the fleeting urge to grab him and reel him back in.
“I used my grace, Dean.  Sam was entirely unharmed by the process, and I assure you this was a better solution than actually helping him to the bathroom.  I was…decidedly displeased with him, and needed to ensure that his needs were met without spending more time than absolutely necessary in his presence.  For his own safety.”
“It was during the two years when we weren’t really in contact,” Sam told him dismissively, waving a hand.  “After I took the queer studies course, the only class that seemed interesting that fit into my schedule the next semester was called ‘Alternative Sexualities,’ and I actually found it really fascinating.”  Dean’s eyes met Cas’s across the table and they both seemed to be having the same thought:
All of this parades through his head in a heartbeat and then he’s on his feet, chair knocked halfway across the room by the speed and force with which he rose.  He puts the table between himself and Lucifer before he lets himself really look at the guy.  It hurts, looking at the intimately familiar face and knowing that what’s looking back at him is all wrong.  Cas is in there somewhere, he knows this, Sam told him what happened when Lucifer was about to kill him, but the creature currently smiling sunnily at Dean is not him.  Lucifer lifts both hands, palms toward Dean, as if in a gesture of surrender.
Dean just barely heard his own low whimper at the angel’s words and felt his already tingling ass cheeks flex as he clenched them involuntarily.  Cas was right—Dean was totally undone by the idea that the angel was doing this not because Dean had earned it from some misstep, but simply because it gave Cas pleasure to have him bare-assed and helpless, whimpering and squirming over his knee.  Dean wanted this spanking because it was one of his turn-ons, yes, but even more than that, the idea that
“Fine, fine, fine.  The two of you have been wanting a dog and a cat respectively forever, and who am I to be the eternal killjoy.  But I have no intention of ever dealing with a dirty litter box or puppy accident or hairball, so—”
“You are, Sir.”
Nope, instead he somehow managed to roll directly out of bed and onto the floor.
The fact that the movie was actually pretty good might, Dean hoped a little desperately, be to his advantage.  Perhaps his interest in the plot and special effects could be at least moderately distracting from the sensations his body was currently experiencing—and there were plenty of those.
“Definitely,” Dean agreed, a little uneasily.  He still wasn’t sure how he felt about that.  “But I wasn’t always happy about it.  I did as I was told, yeah, but I found my own little ways to rebel here and there.  You didn’t even sneak off for a burger when you were supposed to be on patrol, right?”
A slightly stomach-churning meal (his very last, Dean reminded himself!) of powdered scrambled eggs later, Dean went back to fidgeting in front of the windows.  Cas put up with this for another ten minutes before finally standing up with a grunt of annoyance.  After instructing Dean to go shower as soon as Sam emerged, he vanished down the hallway, muttering about making a phone call.
“Should we be worried that there’s some kind of supernatural cause behind the blizzard?”
But he simply couldn’t help himself.
“Tell me why you’re being punished or this stops right now.  If you cannot provide me a coherent answer, I will not deliver the last ten strokes.”
“What?” Cas interrupts, making no attempt to conceal the amusement in his voice, “you will squirm?  You will kick and beg and whine?  You will already do all of those things.  But no,” he says, voice slightly sly, “I do not believe that is what you were warning me of.  I think you meant that if I do not stop, you may come all over my leg like a boy of 16, unable to control his own arousal.  Is that what you meant, Dean?  Answer me.”
“Easy, Cas, I was just joking.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As always, thanks for sticking with me and the boys through this painful journey.  Trust me when I tell you it's harder to write than it is to read.  Let me hear from you; it helps.
Dean kept his mouth shut, because he didn’t trust himself not to say something extremely ill-advised.  Cas smirked down at him.  He was totally onto Dean’s internal struggle, and seemed to be enjoying it greatly.
Cas wiggled his finger a little, the instruction unspoken but no less clear for that.  Dean leaned forward the necessary inch or two to take the digit into his mouth, giving it a leisurely, unnecessarily thorough clean-up.  He didn’t particularly enjoy the slightly bitter, salty taste of his own spunk, but he sure as hell did enjoy the effect this had upon Cas, who drew in a slightly unsteady breath.  “As I suspected, Mr. Winchester.  That mouth clearly has more uses than merely sarcasm and backtalk, doesn’t it?”
Cas somehow has always known the perfect length of time to wait between hits.  Just long enough for the pain to peak, for Dean to really feel each individual stripe, and not so long that he can really start to recover.  It means the pain just builds on itself, both the surface sting and the deeper throb growing ever more intense.
The brother in question appears a few moments later, carrying another tiny plate in one hand, two thimbles clutched in the other.
Sure enough, Cas is seated against the opposite wall, watching Dean steadily (and far more calmly than earlier).  Dean jerks away from the soft warmth at his back, sitting upright hastily and wiping his face, trying to clear it of the sticky remnants of dried tears.  He has no idea how long he slept, but he definitely wasn’t supposed to.  He was supposed to be thinking about what he did, not taking a nice nap.  Shit.
“We do, at that,” Uriel agrees eagerly.  Of course, he’s all for it.  “I won’t let you down,” he says, face set with intentness and excitement, and Michael feels a hint of wistfulness at missing what’s sure to be a hell of a job, even as he glories in the knowledge that he’s managed this.  He’s going to have untold hours in an entirely deserted camp with which to take his time with Dean Winchester, just as soon as he sends Bart and Castiel on ahead to meet the returning men halfway with the carthorses.  Nothing suspicious about it—it’s only smart to have them rendezvous with the men and help transport the gold the rest of the way back to camp.
“No need,” Sam tells him, “I already grabbed you some snacks.  They’re in your kitchen.  Another beer, too.”
Once he and Cas had cleaned themselves, swept up the splinters littering Dean’s room (not before a few unfortunate incidents with bare feet, infuriatingly enough) and definitively determined that the door was a total loss, Dean gave Cas very clear instructions for removing and replacing the door with one from an unused bedroom.  This was less because he thought the angel would be successful (in fact, he was reasonably sure Cas would fail, possibly hilariously) and more a result of the fact that he wanted to deal with Sam himself.  Cas surely recognized Dean’s motivation, but accepted it stoically enough.  He seemed to be aware that at this point he might actually do something irreversible, and despite his fury, he knew quite well that the one thing Dean would not be able to forgive him was killing Sam.
“I,” Cas told him conversationally, “am going to smite your brother.  Twice.”
Dean blinks hard several times, staring blankly at Cas.  Seriously?  Ten strokes of the belt and now he wants Dean to dig his own fucking hands into his thoroughly strapped and spanked ass to give him access to—
“I—wh—“ Dean didn’t even realize he’d spoken until he heard the abortive noises from his mouth.
Awareness found him slowly that morning, coaxing him from the arms of sleep over long moments.  When his thoughts finally coalesced into something resembling order, he registered the feather-light brush of Cas’s lips, dusting across the back of his neck.  There was no urgency in the kisses, no heat.  Cas was not endeavoring to start anything, just giving his deep affection an outlet in the contact.  Dean made a soft, sleepy sound of merged contentment and greeting, tipping his head back so Cas’s forehead pressed against his hair.  He felt rather than heard the smile.
at this.  He’d been the high school kid with the bad attitude, it didn’t take much effort to summon up those patterns again.
