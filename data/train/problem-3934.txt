Therefore, Cas didn’t even have to fake his impatience when their waiter approached the small table. Cutting smoothly over Dean, Cas confidently ordered for both of them. After their waiter left, Cas shut down Dean’s sputtering protests with a firm “just because something is fancy doesn’t mean it can’t taste good, Dean. Get over it.”
Dean balled his fists. What a bunch of assholes, talking about Cas and Jack like that. “Enough.” Dean firmly said. “I’ve seen the damn movie. It’s not a mystery who they’re talking about. You can skip the dramatic cemetery reveal. I just don’t see why I should care what these losers think, anyway.”
. He was on his knees in a stairway, plunging a needle into his heart, looking up at Sam with a terrifyingly blank expression.
Cas’ eyes fell on Dean’s duffel and narrowed. “Are you going somewhere?” he asked, raising his eyebrows, looking almost…hurt?
I woke up in a dark black room, I saw a demon trap and a man in it.” Hello Darling, you must be wondering where you are? Well welcome home.” I looked at him like he was crazy, “ Home?” “ Yes dear, home. Do you not remember your true home, love?” I thought for a moment my true home was with alex. “ My true home is with my mother, Alex Jones, you asshat.” “Oh dear, it seems like you forgot who I am, I am your father, young lady.” “HOW YOU ARE 20 YEARS OLD HOW ARE YOU MY DAD, UNLESS YOU WAS 5 WHEN YOU HAD ME YOU FUCKER.”
I fell on my bed as I heard a soft voice say, “ How could she do that?” Then I opened my eyes to see the red haired woman in the corner. “ Hey, lady what is your name?” “ Dear, my name is
In a matter of 3 minutes the boys were in my room, okay yesterday, Sam had the bodies, so Sam today you are going to ask their friend, and neighbors about them. Dean, no you are not going to be with Cas today, go to the crime scene and look and call if you see anything weird. Cas, because your’s and Sam’s dad is a werewolf, call him and see if his pack did anything, no i'm not saying they did, stop growling. Okay you all have your jobs now go do it.”
Dean reached on his nightstand and grabbed his phone, opened it and searched his phone for cas's number. When he found it he called. (DEAN. Cas.)
Anna Abbott.” Now that I knew her name a feeling washed over me. A feeling of knowing. “ Well Ms. Abbott, me and my family have a case to do. So you could stay here or tell me more about you but give me a minute.” i say as nice as i can to her then yelled, “BOYS GET YOUR ASSES IN HERE!”
I normally don’t back down from a fight, but this time I wasn’t ready. I took my phone out and turned the brightest all the way down and texted sam. Baby Moose 😈
I looked at the red haired woman and said, “imma text the boys though i know they would just walk in.” I picked up my phone, and hit the contact Dean-O 😈
Yes he gave me blood. “Here lilly, if you want to be strong you must drink this demon blood.” He left and shut the door, future me popped back up and said in a rushed voice, “Don’t eat the blood it made Sam Winchester go crazy. He almost DIED eating that.” I didn’t understand but I nodded.  “We gotta get out of here.” I nodded my head again, and asked, “how do i use my powers?” “you got to believe in yourself and you will poof, if they didn’t de-angel the house, to where we can’t poof out.”  I nodded my head again, I don't understand why. “Hide.” I hissed.
I remember the 1st time I heard the name Winchester, i was 15 my mom sat me down and said “ Honey we have to go to a grave today.”, because i was only 15  i didn’t know what that was. We got in the truck and met up with these people, Garth Fitzgerald IV, and his family, Jody, and a lot of people i didn’t know. A young boy no more than my age  walked up and said, “ Hi, I’m Sam Winchester’s son Dean jr. and before you say he was a murder, a killer, let me tell you what he really did, he was a hunter, and not a lot of people know what he and my uncle did. They saved people, yea they may have lost a hell of lot of people but they save a hell of a lot to. He never truly stopped doing his job, he taught me a lot, and some people still believe he was a horrible person, he wasn’t.”
Then Jody walked up and began to talk, “ I remember when i 1st met the boys,” she laughed, “ i was the sheriff in Sioux Falls, SD, they were on a case and i saw right through them so i asked to call there director and i was on call with the one and only bobby singer, and it was fun watching their faces, that wasn’t the last time i saw them, man they helped us saved the world so many times. It hurts knowing that they are gone but i know we pick up where they left off.” She got down then more people walked up and said how he, and his brother saved them.
The last thing i heard was Daddy’s got you.” The man looked like he was 20 he can’t be my dad right it’s not possible, but then again we live in a world with monsters, angels. JACK. Fuck jack. I thought. “Okay Jack, I know you are busy, but I need help, this person kidnapped me. I don't know who it is. I need help.” That was the last thing I remembered.
Dean opened his mouth and spoke, " it was my parents annavsiety of them meeting each other and that year they wanted to go to paris. When we got to the eiffel tower it was beautiful then we heard crying so me and my family ran to see what happened we saw this little guy," dean walked over to gabe and messed his hair up, " crying give it to him he was 1. Then his brother held out his hand for me to shake then the rest of the day we all became each other's best friend but when we went home the next day," sam stood up and put his arm around his brother, " a earthquake happened and me and sammy's mom died. So when I got my phone 4 years ago I remembered his mom's number, and I called them." Dean finished.
I woke up in a dark black room, I saw a demon trap and a man in it.” Hello Darling, you must be wondering where you are? Well welcome home.” I looked at him like he was crazy, “ Home?” “ Yes dear, home. Do you not remember your true home, love?” I thought for a moment my true home was with alex. “ My true home is with my mother, Alex Jones, you asshat.” “Oh dear, it seems like you forgot who I am, I am your father, young lady.” “HOW YOU ARE 20 YEARS OLD HOW ARE YOU MY DAD, UNLESS YOU WAS 5 WHEN YOU HAD ME YOU FUCKER.”
"SAMMY SHUT YOUR CAKEHOLE!" Dean yelled at him. " Hey, Cas want me to take you home, you to Gabe?" "Sure Dean-O" Gabe said. " 1205 W. Main St."
They got out of the impala and sat on the hood and Dean told Cas he was the only one who sat on the hood of baby. Then Dean's ringtone went off.
“Okay, Sam check the bodies, Cas go with Dean and check the vic’s families, I stay here and try to figure out who it could be.” They shook their heads. As I began to read the lore, and get caught up I heard a voice, “CHARLIE,CHARLIE.” As used as I am to the supernatural, I still jump now and then, but I shake my head, and continue to read the lore. “ So, I guess the victims were whores.” Sam said as he walked into the motel room. “ So, I guess we have to wait for...” as i was saying this the other two walked in. “So who were the vic’s guys?” “ Okay so we went in their bed rooms, and saw one name over and over, Jack Key.” I shook my head at that name and I remembered something.
She stared at me wide eyed. “Their dead, how am i going to know who i am?” As she was saying this her voice broke. “Hey, hey it’s okay I think i know who your parents are, but to show you I have a couple questions.” I told her, she nodded her head and asked, “What do you need char?” “I need a way out of here without getting myself killed, and with,” I moved my hand in a way so future me can come out. “Come on,” I told her. She came out of behind the old fashion bookcase. “Hey, hon. I’m her in 2030, also i wanna tell you, on Nov. 23rd of 2025 stay in the bedroom you share with your wife, don’t go to work.” After that she just disappeared, i didn’t know what was gonna happen why would i tell her, stay home unless….
She disappeared again, just as a knock on the door happened, a small voice was at the door, “Hey, may i come in.” I walked over to the door and said, “ I guess, but let me open it.” I opened the door and saw the most cutest thing, “uhh, umm, hi.” i said weirdly. The girl with one of the  bluest of blue eyes, and a cutest green eye. “Hi, do you go by charlie or lilly?” she asked me. “I go by my name Charlie.” “Oh then hi charlie. I’m Jo ellen but call me Jo.” “Wait are you named after the famous Harvelle's?” “Who are they?” she asked. I moved out from in front of the door so she could walk in, “Jo, come have a seat, and let me tell you about them. Wait who are your parents?” I asked. “All I know is the last name winchester.” “as in sam or dean?” “tell me about them please.” She asked me. I shook my head yes. “Where do I begin, uhm, Dean Winchester was born to a Mary and John Winchester, January 24th 1979, and 4 years later on May 2nd 1983 sam Winchester was born. 6 months later Mary winchester was killed,” i told her, “by the yellow eyed demon.” I whispered. “22 years later Dean shows up at Sam's place, and says, ‘Dad hasn’t been home in a few days, Dad’s on a hunting trip and hasn’t been home in a few days.’ and on that day, they began the story.” “Sam wanted to come back on monday, and he did, but he looked on the ceiling and saw his girlfriend Jess dead just like their mother. That’s when the story truly begins, they went on many cases all over the world, and when Dean was 28 his brother died and he sold his soul to save him, and when he was 29 he was killed by hellhounds, and when he was still 29, an angel named castiel, pulled him from hell, Dean stabbed him when they met but they soon became best friends, they saved the world many times, they met some angels, demons, witches, and more. They even saved Lucifer's son, Jack, who by the way is god now. Also they took Chuck's the man who was god, powers away. But about 30 years ago dean died on a hunting trip, vamps in masks, before that Castiel died saving dean and himself from billie who was death. Then about 10 years ago Sam died, and now we are here.”
“Charlie are you okay?” Sam yelled. I nodded my head, “yea, i’m just going to go lay down for a bit.”
"Cas, where do you wanna look 1st?" Dean asked him. Cas said " I really don't care, dean." " Okay, I shall show you my favorite place in school, just don't tell anyone please." Dean told cas. " i won't." " okay, i have a question for you, 1. Why are you here?, wait i didn't mean to say it that way, and 2..." Dean put his arm on the back of his neck and finished asking his questions, " you think I'm cute?" After Dean finished saying he turned beet red. " Okay i will tell you, my dad got a new job here and we moved down here, i called you cute because you were back then, but now you are really fucking hot dean." As soon as Cas said this he froze, because he just admitted to his crush of 13 years he was hot. " Cas, you think i'm hot. I beg to differ because you are not me."
Then Jody walked up and began to talk, “ I remember when i 1st met the boys,” she laughed, “ i was the sheriff in Sioux Falls, SD, they were on a case and i saw right through them so i asked to call there director and i was on call with the one and only bobby singer, and it was fun watching their faces, that wasn’t the last time i saw them, man they helped us saved the world so many times. It hurts knowing that they are gone but i know we pick up where they left off.” She got down then more people walked up and said how he, and his brother saved them.
In a matter of 3 minutes the boys were in my room, okay yesterday, Sam had the bodies, so Sam today you are going to ask their friend, and neighbors about them. Dean, no you are not going to be with Cas today, go to the crime scene and look and call if you see anything weird. Cas, because your’s and Sam’s dad is a werewolf, call him and see if his pack did anything, no i'm not saying they did, stop growling. Okay you all have your jobs now go do it.”
DEAN: I'm going to get ready. Yes I know it's only 10 in the morning but I want to look good for your 1s and hopefully not your last date.
“ I am half demon and half human. Your Mother is half witch and human. You are the most powerful thing you are not like Jack, you are one of a kind also you think you are 25, you are not hon you are, over 60 years old.” “ WHAT!! How old am I?” I asked this man how has yet to tell me his name.
“Okay Ms. Abbott, what, who, and how are you here?” “Charlie dear, these questions will be answered in time for now worry about that man that is after you because of what you are.” “What am I? What the hell, I'm a human, I'm a hunter, no.” “Oh dear, you don’t know, one moment.” I began to yell “WAIT WHERE ARe you going.” She left, I tought. The one who can answer my questions is gone. Then she came back out of nowhere. “ Charlie you have to listen carefully, go to your bedroom here, call those dumb ass boys, run.” She told me calmly. “Wait why.” I crossed my arms. “Okay, then I guess I have to tell you Your part, witch, human and,” then she begins mumbling, “angel, and demon.” “WHAT!?!?” I yelled. Just then a knock came to the front door.
She stared at me wide eyed. “Their dead, how am i going to know who i am?” As she was saying this her voice broke. “Hey, hey it’s okay I think i know who your parents are, but to show you I have a couple questions.” I told her, she nodded her head and asked, “What do you need char?” “I need a way out of here without getting myself killed, and with,” I moved my hand in a way so future me can come out. “Come on,” I told her. She came out of behind the old fashion bookcase. “Hey, hon. I’m her in 2030, also i wanna tell you, on Nov. 23rd of 2025 stay in the bedroom you share with your wife, don’t go to work.” After that she just disappeared, i didn’t know what was gonna happen why would i tell her, stay home unless….
I wake up to the sound of yelling, “ WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!” I jumped out of bed and began to run into the front of the bunker seeing a woman with red hair, “Oh, Charlie dear, look how much you grew, come to your mother.” “You're not my mom, my mom is Alex jones.” I crossed my arms, and turned on my heels, and walked to my room, until I realized I wasn't moving.”bitch come on.” I yelled. “Young lady, is that how you speak to this Alex woman?” “No because she is my mother and you are not so bye bitch.” I tried to walk again, and this time I did it.
That was almost 5 years ago. I live in the bunker they lived in with the rest of the team, we call ourselves Team free will 3.0, the last of the winchesters. “Hey guys, so get this.” Sam told the team, werewolves in Las Vegas¨, i shake my head, we heard how they went all over the united states, “Come on guys let’s go.” Before you ask, no they are my family i don’t love them like that, plus i take after my namesake. Anyhow, “guys let’s get in the impala.” Yes it’s the most famous car in the hunter world because of who it used to belong to. “DEAN, SAM, CAS, COME ON.” I yelled. We got in the car and drove to sin city.
Then this crazy thing happened and a man appeared and began to talk. “Hello, i’m Jack Kilne, i know you all know me as lucifer’s son but, he wasn’t my dad my dads was both winchesters and Castiel, but they taught me everything really, the thing i most remember is when they, got up and kept fighting Chuck so i could do what i needed to do and fix the world, and i won't forget that, thank you sam, see you with dean and cas soon.” Then he just disappeared.
Dean got up and went to the bathroom, took a shower, combed his hair, brushed his teeth and sat down and looked at the clock and it read 11:11. He shook his head and laid back on his bed and sighed. Around 12:30 he got up and got something to eat. Sammy was sitting there waiting. "So it's 12:30 and you just got up,?" Sam spoke. " No Sammy, I have been up since 10. I am waiting till 8." " What's at 8?" Sam asked, tensing his older brother. " My date with Cas." Just then a knock on the front door and Dean walked to get it and when he opened the door it took all of his strength not to cry. There in the doorway was a young man with a baggy t-shirt that had ac dc on it and black pants that were tight but not too tight. "Cas what are you doing here?" Dean asked him. " Dean, I couldn't wait at all. I was pacing, and shit, is that what John did to you imma kill him!?" Dean began laughing nonstop "Cas looked so adorable when he is mad." "Cas wanna watch a movie before the diner?"  "of course what movie." " what do you want to watch?" "anything you want to."
“Oh,” Cas rumbles. “Oh, um, there’s very nice.” Dean opens his lips to suck on Cas’ neck just below his ear, probably leaving a different kind of mark as a memorial of Dean’s presence.
Cas checked subtly to see if their tense exchange had attracted notice from the other couples, but they all seemed blissfully locked in intimate conversation. After finishing their meal, Cas walked Dean back to their bungalow. He could feel the eyes of the other couples on them, so he made a split decision and slipped his arm around Dean. After initially tensing up, Dean actually leaned into it, giving every impression of comfortable rapport.
Thoughts whirled in Dean’s head, competing to fly out of his mouth, but nothing came. Instead, he did the only thing that made sense; the only thing that seemed to adequately express what he wanted to say, and closed the scant distance between his lips and Cas’.
Dean nodded, resigned. Of course. He had been too much of a coward and avoided Cas for a month and left in a huff last night and Cas had moved on. This was a breakup speech.
Dean sank to his knees in front of Death, still clutching her coat reflexively. “I promise. I’ll do right by him, Billie. I won’t hide anymore.” Dean realized he was shouting desperately. “I’ll try. I’ll be brave. I’m not afraid anymore.” Dimly, he realized he was sobbing rather than speaking. He leaned his head forward to rest it on Billie’s feet, but his head hit the ground, and her jacket was empty in his hands. Dean lifted it to his face, repeating “I’m not afraid anymore,” over and over again, until he realized the material wasn’t worn leather but the scratchy faded blue acrylic of the motel bed’s blanket.
Dean never said “honey, I’m home,” but they did fall into a comfortable domestic routine at the bunker. He often made dinner, not only for Cas, but for any number of loved ones and friends who cycled through Lebanon regularly. They raised their little black kitten together, even though she wasn’t allowed in bed due to Dean’s allergies. Kids were firmly off the menu, but they did do their best with Jack, showing him how to live in their liminal space between humanity and the Supernatural. As long as he found happiness, they didn’t really mind what Jack chose to do, but of course he joined them in the Family Business. Dean only wore sweaters when a case required them, but Cas favored them on cold winter days in the bunker, especially ugly ones he found at the local thrift shop. Vacations were hard to come by, between their lifestyle and Dean’s phobia of flying, but they did manage to travel quite a bit and steal plenty of pleasant moments of relaxation between hunts. As for holding hands, they did that plenty.
I looked at the red haired woman and said, “imma text the boys though i know they would just walk in.” I picked up my phone, and hit the contact Dean-O 😈
I wake up to the sound of yelling, “ WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!” I jumped out of bed and began to run into the front of the bunker seeing a woman with red hair, “Oh, Charlie dear, look how much you grew, come to your mother.” “You're not my mom, my mom is Alex jones.” I crossed my arms, and turned on my heels, and walked to my room, until I realized I wasn't moving.”bitch come on.” I yelled. “Young lady, is that how you speak to this Alex woman?” “No because she is my mother and you are not so bye bitch.” I tried to walk again, and this time I did it.
My powers. I thought. Yes, our powers. I heard someone say. I turned my head around and saw no one but the other me in the room. “What powers?” “You can heal people, kill them and poof out of here.” Just as she, I finished talking, some said, “Lilly, you're food here. I’m coming in.” I looked at myself and she nodded and began to say, “omi ali homolie, luci, may,in”  i had no idea what she had said but the next thing i knew she disappeared, just as he came in the room. “Here’s your food.” he handed me the plate of……
They jumped, then they heard the sound of something hitting the roof of baby and they realized it was raining so they sighed and Dean spoke sadly, " Guess we have to go pick up Sammy and Gabe now." sadly cas shook his head. They drove in silence till they reached the school, and Dean texted his brother and said, " SAMMY, I'M HERE." Then Sam and Gabe ran to the black Chevy Impala and got in the back. " Dean what took you and cas so...Ohhhhh" Sam said realizing they were trying to get to know each other again.
For your patience, a mini chapter now. I have to admit, writing this was a little bit my reaction to what I perceived as overly fluffy fic where they sleep together and then are married instantly. Nothing against that-I read and like plenty of it, but sometimes it stretches so much out of character that I can't enjoy it, you know?
Dean protested, “Yeah, but at least it knocks you out.” But he dropped the bottle back in the bucket. “OK, then, Dr. Oz. What do you suggest?” he asked, hands on his hips.
Cas turns the steaming hot mug of coffee in his hands. Sure, it only tastes like molecules, not roasted bean flavoring to him, but it gives him something to do. Now that he’s back, he finds the times when Dean and Sam are asleep discomforting. Cas never minded being alone in the past. Now, after the Empty…
The breeze rippled through the green ocean of Mangroves. From his vantage point on the second balcony of the treehouse, he could just see the Dangriga river meandering to the ocean. The birds were quiet; it was almost noon. The peace of the setting was echoed by a deep peace in Dean’s heart.
“Please,” Dean gasped, not knowing how to communicate how much he needed it all. Cas just pulled him up into his lap, angling Dean’s hips up. He drew back and, grasping Dean firmly by the hips, pushed in completely, stroking Dean’s prostrate at the perfect angle. Dean could not hold back the filthy cry that escaped his lips.
I fell on my bed as I heard a soft voice say, “ How could she do that?” Then I opened my eyes to see the red haired woman in the corner. “ Hey, lady what is your name?” “ Dear, my name is
So, I accidentally wrote another Sam chapter. The thing is, he’s a better exposition monkey and also maybe I’m in love with Odie a little bit. Why do you keep talking about my shoulders? LOL, we are all Velma. ANYWAY here’s a long chapter and the next one has Destiel FEELINGS and AWKWARD SILENCES and GROUP THERAPY so if that’s your jam please keep reading I love you all like Sam loves books.
Cas put a hand on Dean’s face. Dean closed his eyes. It was how Cas had healed him. It was also exactly how Dean had fantasized about finally, finally, being held, drawn close, kissed.
Dean opened a game and laid face down on the bed, tapping at the screen. A minute later, another text came through.
Charlie leaned forward in the saddle. “Engage.” she whispered with a smile in Atreyu’s ear, and they were off, flying through the air back to the bunker.
“Trust issues?” scoffs Dean, hunched on the edge of the pull-out sofa. “Trust issues.” he repeats, drumming fingers nervously on his knees.
“What?” Cas blurts out, unable to keep track of the conversational thread with Dean’s scent and skin and breath so close.
Dean minutely tightened his grip on the bottle’s neck. “What?” he gritted out through clenched teeth, even though he was sure he heard Sam just fine.
“Don’t get fresh, cowboy” Charlie teased, glancing back at him enough to wink. Dean grinned. Damn. He had really missed her.
He crashed through the door, his legs protesting and chest burning. There sat Baby, sleek and black. A silver-haired female hunter sat smugly in the driver’s seat, running her hand appreciatively across the dash. Outside the open door, a line of hunters were waiting for their chance to check her out. Dean approached, heartsick, until he was close enough to read the sign on her windshield. “
I couldn't decide if this was three short chapters, or one mega-chapter, and it was a transition so it really fought me. You get a mega chapter that really puts the Unresolved and Slow in the UST and Slow Burn. I swear there is smut coming. The boys just really needed some character movement before heading into the next act, which is Angsty as Fuck, y'all.
Dean stumbled out of bed and groped his way to the window, pulling aside the curtains, upsetting a cloud of dust that rained cigarette ash smell into the room, clouding his vision and making him cough. When the fine powder settled, Dean almost shrieked. Jo Harvelle stood just outside the window.
Cas nodded, satisfied now that all members of their little party were participating in this social ritual. “To Dean,” Cas began. Dean’s mouth fell open in shock. Cas was still talking. “Even though he wasn’t able to be here tonight, he’s in our hearts. Always.” Cas raised his bottle a bit at this and made to drink when Sam interjected loudly:
They’ve done this before, Dean thinks. Nothing to be nervous about. He looked down at their hands, pressed together like pages of a book, breathing deeply, trying to calm his staccato beat of his heart and brain. The bell rang and Dean dragged his eyes up and saw a familiar, perfect, blue sight. This was home.
Jo gave him a sharp smile. “When Bobby Singer calls, I answer.” She shrugged. “Plus, I’m not gonna pass up the chance to work one last case with a Winchester.” She winked at him, then nudged his arm. “Shhh, or you’ll miss it.”
“Ha!” exclaimed Dean, partially in response to Sam, and partly in triumph at unearthing an ancient bottle of cooking sherry. He unscrewed it and took a whiff, recoiling in disgust. “What are you going to do, put him in footie pajamas and hang out his stocking for Santa?” Dean said in a mocking tone. He put his lips to the bottle and swigged, wincing at the burn.
Cas was still wondering at this conundrum when Dean’s voice broke through his reverie. “Gimme a 5 barrel sour, please.”
“Neither.” Odie’s pleasant voice had gone flat. She raked the barfly with a contemptuous gaze. “There’s no business for you here. He’s with me.” Odie then put a hand on Sam’s arm, passing him one of the beers with the other. The woman flipped her ponytail over her shoulder and waltzed away, her hoop earrings swinging with the motion.
Brian administered one particularly deep stroke and Dean felt tears well up in his eyes. Not from pain. At least, not from physical pain. Brian didn’t notice and kept working on Dean’s chest, opening it up while Dean struggled against him to emotionally shut it back down, this longing he worked so hard every day to keep tied up and locked up tight and tamed and dulled and fuck-Dean felt like his heart was actually breaking. The longing need was going to escape and it was going to be a hell of a lot more embarrassing than a stupid erection. Dean finally gasped and let a small noise escape; those less charitable to his ego might have described it as a sob.
“Fine,” she sighed, producing a straw cowgirl hat with a colored beaded band from somewhere and placing it on her head. The light dampened considerably so that Dean could look at her through narrowed eyelids. “But it’s not my fault you can’t look at it.” She pouted a bit, and looked every bit the young woman she had been all those years ago at the Roadhouse in Nebraska. Dean shook that memory away, trying to clear his head.
Odie stood, putting her hands on her hips, pacing in front of the posterboard she had tacked to her kitchen wall. “We also tried interviewing resort employees. They didn’t have any further details. The couples went to the retreat’s final ceremony-a graduation kind of thing. They returned to their rooms, and nobody ever saw them again after that.”
Cas sat on the floor beside him. He put a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I knew, Dean.” he said. “I always knew.”
“Don’t play dumb, Dean,” said Jo shoving his arm lightly. “That story was never about loving Christmas. It was about greed.”
Dean relaxed into his chair, folding his arms. At least he knew he was completely, 100% true-blue friend to Cas. No problems there.
Sam cleared his throat and Dean realized he had been standing there for a long moment, just staring at Cas and his damn arms.
Dean huffed a sigh, irresistibly reminded of, who else, Cas. but all that love bullcrap wasn’t for hardened soldiers like him. And Cas. Shit, he had learned that a long time ago, with Lisa. He would not let this change things between them. He had it all right where he wanted it to stay.
Dean had spent his entire lifetime in control. He cared for others, was the rock upon which his father, and then his brother, could rely. Any time he felt anything he associated with weakness, he postured and preened, projecting the strength he knew others required of him. This man, Cas thought, was used to taking what he wanted, but only when he was completely in control of the terms under which he got it, and when and how it would end.
A big fucking white horse stood outside his window. Atop it, resplendent in velvet green Renaissance-style gowns, sat Charlie Bradbury, her auburn hair long again and styled with a circlet crown of twisted gold. She haughtily peered down at Dean. “Hop on, Handmaiden,” she ordered, tacking a crooked smile on at the end.
Sam held a hand out, placating.  “Okay. I believe you.” He didn’t, but Sam was good at talking people down. With patience borne of years dealing with jittery victims and his histrionic brother, he changed tack. “Who are the usual suspects in these parts? Vampires? Werewolves? Ghosts? Shifters?”
Dean flopped down on the bed, crawling quickly underneath the covers in his t-shirt and gym shorts, chosen particularly for this shared sleeping situation and asked “Are you just going to sit there all night and watch me? I told you, that’s creepy as hell.” Every alarm in his head went off, but somehow Dean found himself patting the bed next to him. “C’mon, man. I don’t bite.” Dean flicked back the blanket on the other side.
Odie crossed the threshold, not pausing to see if Sam followed. “Let’s get some dinner started and then we’ll dive into the research.” She bustled about the small kitchen, putting away her goods, washing her hands at the sink. “Restroom’s through there; you can get washed up from your trip.”
Nope, his gratitude was premature because now they were in a mission-style living room. A sheet-draped figure lay on the dining room table. Dean watched himself twitch off the shroud and look away, swallowing back tears. Dean watched himself tear the sheer drapes from the windows to bind Cas’ body. Watched himself stop, overcome, forcing breaths.
The problem was, he couldn’t deny Sam anything. After this last hunt, his brother had arrived the next morning with snacks and coffee and said “Hey Dean, you know that grief counselor?” Real casual, Sammy, thought Dean. “She really helped Jack. I wanna go back.” Sam obviously thought Dean was too thick to catch his careful sideways look.
Cas deals with the fallout of his refusal to perform the commitment ritual with Dean, and Sam and Odie look for ways to slow Ixchel down.
Odie’s shoulders slumped from where she had been holding them up by her ears. “My father, Jay Reneau, was Garifuna. He practiced obeah” Her voice was so soft Sam had to strain to hear her even out here away from the speakers and crowd. At his questioning look, she added. “Black magic, or voodoo, I guess you would call it, from the Ashanti tradition.” Her mouth quirked. “Though mostly it was like he was a counselor, helping people with their problems.”
Sam sat at the war table. He leaned back, jamming his chopsticks with finality into a take-out container, and pushed his chair back, humming in satisfaction. Dean peered into the white box with Chinese characters on it, frowning at the veggie tofu dish inside. “Typical” Dean muttered, under his breath. Charlie elbowed him.
He hummed along to the radio, thumbs tapping the wheel of the Impala as he floored it heading East on I-70. He caught a glance of his face in the rearview and almost didn’t recognize his shining eyes, flushed cheeks, toothy grin. His heart was beating quickly with excitement, but it wasn’t anxious. Dean felt strangely at peace. He had made his decision, and one way or another, the stupid stuck-ness of his life was going to change today.
Dean eyed the horse warily. Again, he was more comfortable around engines than livestock. “Uh, I don’t really…” he began weakly.
In any case, sorry it took me so long to post, but I had to edit quite a bit to make it fit the rest of the case detail I added so...sorry!
“I’m not afraid anymore” Dean whispered, his voice scratchy, as he scrambled out of bed. “Thank you Jo, thank you Charlie, thank you Billie!” Dean closed his eyes, overcome with feeling. “Oh, Bobby, thank you so much! That was the best night with three women from my past I could ever have imagined.”
“ I am half demon and half human. Your Mother is half witch and human. You are the most powerful thing you are not like Jack, you are one of a kind also you think you are 25, you are not hon you are, over 60 years old.” “ WHAT!! How old am I?” I asked this man how has yet to tell me his name.
“May the winchester’s please go to the office,” The lady on the intercom said. Dean got up and graped his stuff, and went to his brother’s class room. Dean picked up his brother and then made their way to the office.  “ Dean, Sam can you take these 2 new students,” Mr. Garth Fitzgerald lV said, ”and show them around.” Mr. Garth went into his office and brought two teenagers out, as soon as Dean and Sam saw them they dropped everything and screamed “We found you guys again,” And then they ran and hugged the two boys.” Bee? Is that really you?” Dean said to the boy who was wearing a suit and a trench coat. Sam ran to the boy with reddish brown hair and said,”Gabey, is that you?”  Gabe shook his head yes then the 2 boys gave each other a bear hug.
"Dean," Sam yelled,"Wake up." while jumping on his bed. Dean mumbled "Go away Sammy." Then all of a sudden Dean jumps up in his boxers, and runs to try to chapter Sammy. As Dean was running someone caught him he was scared because he was only 5 and Sam was one. "Dean love stop running you get hurt." Mary said, laughing. " Come on get ready we're going to the Eiffel tower."
“You are 63 years old, and your name isn’t Charlie Newbrooke, your name is lily Campbell, yes you are a descendant of both the most amazing hunters, the Winchester's and the Campbell's. Also my name is Owen Porter. Don’t think you can leave darling. If you try calling those boys who will be killed."
I layed down not believing what I saw, a man in a trench coat, a blue tie, black hair and the most bluest of blue eyes, told me not to come here, fuck i thought imma get kidnapped. I closed my eyes and drifted into an uneasy sleep thinking about my past. Why was I left on her doorstep, did my family not want me? Did they not care if she didn’t take me in?, Will I ever know where I'm from?
The next time I woke up I was in an old room that I felt like I knew: blood red walls, black floor, and a notebook on the table that was next to a bed. For some odd reason I wanted to open the notebook, Dear Journal, today is the 11th of January, and my mom and dad are fighting again, about some people named Winchester. I jumped back after I read that Winchester. “HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I HEARD THAT NAME?” Just then I heard a knock on the door, “Hon, It’s me Marry Galloway and I'm your mother.” I just stood there and said, “Oh now 2 people trying to say they are my mother, yea right, Come in i guess.” She walked in and my jaw hit the floor, she looked like an older version of me with dark brown hair, grayish blue eyes, but she had a huge scar from her right eye down to the corner of her mouth. “You you you look like me.” said a little scared, “thank you for letting me in here, but i lied to you Charlie.” I looked at her confused, “What do you mean you lied to me.'' I asked her angrily. She looked at me and said, " I'm not your mom, I'm you in the future if you make it out alive.” Make it out alive?! I thought to myself. “I know you are confused, hell I am. So you are most likely wondering why I'm here. Well i’m here to help you get out of here, without the scar.” “okay how do i do it.”  “we aren’t going in the window, or the door,we have to use your powers.”
“Charlie, baby where are you.” Someone yelled. “Right here.” I had yelled back, then this man came out of nowhere and said, “You will be useful soon, not right now but soon, in 10 years you will go to Las Vegas and hear this name Jack Key, and when you do just know you won’t be back until the day you see this,” Sees a picture of a circle with an X through it. “CHARLIE,”
I put the phone down and looked up at her and stated, “ not them. Wanna help me find out and harm them?” Then she shocked her head so roughly i thought i would fly off, then she said something that made my blood boil. “Honey people are coming for you. Those are the people who have to hide.
Then Cas began talking, " So me and my family and I have a lot of siblings so yea" cas said as he put his hand on the back of his neck. " We all went to Paris to see my Uncle Uriel. So me, gabe and our mom went to the eiffel tower then gabe began crying because someone knocked him over," Dean interpreted and yelled " what why didn't you tell me?" " Because i had only just meet you assbutt, my mom told your's," Cas said then began to finished what he was saying," so after he began yelling and crying this family came over, a tall blonde woman 2 kids and a man with a beard, and my mom told his mom what happened and i went over to the tall cute one," Cas stopped to take some air in, then finished it," i introduced myself and he introduce himself and we became best friends." Mr. Garth said, "okay, dean and sam you can show them around now."
“Okay Ms. Abbott, what, who, and how are you here?” “Charlie dear, these questions will be answered in time for now worry about that man that is after you because of what you are.” “What am I? What the hell, I'm a human, I'm a hunter, no.” “Oh dear, you don’t know, one moment.” I began to yell “WAIT WHERE ARe you going.” She left, I tought. The one who can answer my questions is gone. Then she came back out of nowhere. “ Charlie you have to listen carefully, go to your bedroom here, call those dumb ass boys, run.” She told me calmly. “Wait why.” I crossed my arms. “Okay, then I guess I have to tell you Your part, witch, human and,” then she begins mumbling, “angel, and demon.” “WHAT!?!?” I yelled. Just then a knock came to the front door.
“ Sammy wake up we are going to be later for school, today is your 1st day in highschool come on.” Dean told Sammy while ripping the covers. “DEAN!”, Sam yelled at him. Dean walked away from Sammy and went to his room and looked at his plush bee thinking about his Bee.
Cas: dean are you okay are you there now because if so im going over there and giving him a pice of my mind.
Dean took Cas's hand and pulled him to a 1967 Impala. Dean opened the door for him and cas sat in the passenger's seat and dean went to the driver's seat. Dean turned on the radio and the music filled the car. Of course Dean sang the song that was playing. It was Eye of the Tiger. They drove for a good 2 hours till they reached a meadow, the meadow had big oak trees and a river in the middle of it. As soon as Cas saw this his mouth popped open with a little pop. "dean it's breathtaking."
I was hiding under the bed texting Sam, when I heard footsteps, they found me and put a bag over my head and somehow I saw through the bag, and saw a young man no more than 20 years old taking my phone and texting Sam. Then he shuts the phone down and turned to me and said in a scottish voice, “ Don’t worry your pretty head dear, Daddy’s got you.”
Dean, Sam honey we got to go home said Mary. Just then a major earthquake happened the book cases fell out of the wall, and fell on top of Mary. she didn't make it.
“Charlie are you okay?” Sam yelled. I nodded my head, “yea, i’m just going to go lay down for a bit.”
I was hiding under the bed texting Sam, when I heard footsteps, they found me and put a bag over my head and somehow I saw through the bag, and saw a young man no more than 20 years old taking my phone and texting Sam. Then he shuts the phone down and turned to me and said in a scottish voice, “ Don’t worry your pretty head dear, Daddy’s got you.”
I remember the 1st time I heard the name Winchester, i was 15 my mom sat me down and said “ Honey we have to go to a grave today.”, because i was only 15  i didn’t know what that was. We got in the truck and met up with these people, Garth Fitzgerald IV, and his family, Jody, and a lot of people i didn’t know. A young boy no more than my age  walked up and said, “ Hi, I’m Sam Winchester’s son Dean jr. and before you say he was a murder, a killer, let me tell you what he really did, he was a hunter, and not a lot of people know what he and my uncle did. They saved people, yea they may have lost a hell of lot of people but they save a hell of a lot to. He never truly stopped doing his job, he taught me a lot, and some people still believe he was a horrible person, he wasn’t.”
Hi i'm a hunter, they say, “good luck the Winchester’s are dead,” everyone knows that though, i never introduce myself, hi im Charlie, no not Charlie Bradbury, Charlie Newbrooke. My mom is, well she is like my mom her name is Alex Jones, Dean and Sam saved her from a Vamps nest, and my ‘Grandma’ Jody Mills took her in. Not a lot happened after they died, I met up with the new team Castiel Fitzgerald, Sam Fitzgerald, Dean Winchester Jr. Yea i know i said the Winchester’s are dead but they left an amazing story behind, that begins, before there time and will never end.
Dean turned the radio off and said, " Hey, Cas is this your house," pointing at a big blue house. "It is Dean-o." Gabe popped off. Dean turned and told gabe, " Shut the fuck up gabe." Sam opened his door and yelled at gabe, " race you Gabey." After the two boys ran to the door dean turned to cas and asked, " Would you like to go to the diner with me tomorrow?" Cas stared at the boy in utter shock and then dean spoke, " if you don't want to it's okay." Then cas told him to stop by putting his soft, dry lips, " Dean do you really think i don't want to go on a date with you then you are a idiot." Then cas kissed him on the check and opened the passenger side door and said, " what time?" " how about tomorrow at 8pm." " okay i be there."
Cas face was beet red and dean realized what he said so dean said something he always wanted to say, " cas, im gay and i realized it when i meet you and," dean was cut of by soft, moist lips, he realized it was Cas's lips. He backed up and then cas said, " glad you like me to dean because i realized i was gay a year after i met you." Then Dean put his big, strong hands on Cas's face and pulled him close and kissed him again, his tongue touched Cas's lips begging for entrance and cas let him in and they began to fight for dominance then they pulled away and Dean said, " Let me show you my favorite spot."
My powers. I thought. Yes, our powers. I heard someone say. I turned my head around and saw no one but the other me in the room. “What powers?” “You can heal people, kill them and poof out of here.” Just as she, I finished talking, some said, “Lilly, you're food here. I’m coming in.” I looked at myself and she nodded and began to say, “omi ali homolie, luci, may,in”  i had no idea what she had said but the next thing i knew she disappeared, just as he came in the room. “Here’s your food.” he handed me the plate of……
I decided to tell my father about cas. I knew it was risky but I had to for some odd reason. I walked to my father who was on the couch and said, " Dad, I have a date tomorrow and I won't be home till late, about 10pm." The old man looked at his son and asked, " What girl now, better be Lisa, I loved that girl." You could smell the alcohol on his breath. Dean asked himself why tell him he is just going to beat me up like always. He took a deep breath and spoke "It's a boy. His name is cas, he is sweet, caring, and my best friend." Just as dean finsed talking he felt something hard hit him in the head, and his dad yelling, " I SHALL NOT LET A FAG IN MY GOD DAMN HOUSE!" Then he began to kick, punch, and yell at dean. Until Bobby walked in and saw what John was doing to his son. " WHAT THE HELL JOHN HE IS YOUR FUCKING SON," and Bobby pulled jihn off him and said, " YOU FUCKING TOUCH HIM OR SAM AGAIN I'LL KILL YOU!" Sam rann down the staris and sreamed "DAD, I FUCKING HATE YOU, YOU BEAT DEAN UP BECAUSE YOU THINK IT WAS HIS FAULT YOU KNOW WHAT AFTER MOM DIED YOU GAVE THE HELL UP, DEAN BASCILY RASIED ME, " Sam chocked a sob and continued, " I DONT CARE IF HE IS GAY, BI OR WHATEVER BECAUSE I KNOW HE IS MY BROTHER, MY FRIEND! I FUCKING LOVE HIM." " Dean," Sam said and walked over to where Dean was laying. " come on i get you cleaned up." Sam helped dean get cleaned up he asked, "Dean what happened," Just as dean was about to explain Booby busted in the room and said, " Idjits grab your shit you are going to live with me, ellen and jo." As they were packing their stuff they heard sirens and saw red, and blue flashing lights. That night John Eric Winchester was arrested for child abuse.
Then this crazy thing happened and a man appeared and began to talk. “Hello, i’m Jack Kilne, i know you all know me as lucifer’s son but, he wasn’t my dad my dads was both winchesters and Castiel, but they taught me everything really, the thing i most remember is when they, got up and kept fighting Chuck so i could do what i needed to do and fix the world, and i won't forget that, thank you sam, see you with dean and cas soon.” Then he just disappeared.
That was almost 5 years ago. I live in the bunker they lived in with the rest of the team, we call ourselves Team free will 3.0, the last of the winchesters. “Hey guys, so get this.” Sam told the team, werewolves in Las Vegas¨, i shake my head, we heard how they went all over the united states, “Come on guys let’s go.” Before you ask, no they are my family i don’t love them like that, plus i take after my namesake. Anyhow, “guys let’s get in the impala.” Yes it’s the most famous car in the hunter world because of who it used to belong to. “DEAN, SAM, CAS, COME ON.” I yelled. We got in the car and drove to sin city.
Sam raised his hands over his keyboard again, eager. “Okay, well, I’m okay in Spanish, too. What should I look up? Aztec or Inca?” Odie was silent long enough that Sam looked up to confirm she had heard him. She was doubled over, laughing so hard she wasn’t capable of making sound. She drew in a deep breath and schooled her features.
Jo had indeed pressed fast-forward as he was zapped to a sunlit parking lot behind the Pirate Pete’s. Dean took in his past self’s defeated body language, shoulders hunched. “And now you’re gonna bring him back.” he heard himself utter in prayer. Dean’s mouth fell open. He hadn’t been consciously aware of saying those words. Had been sure he had said “them.”
Dean grabbed the interruption like a lifeline and was soon chatting with Jason and Lana like old friends. Cas smiled and exchanged pleasant chatter, all the while listening and observing for clues. He made no real conversational contribution except to point out a beautiful rainbow that appeared over the beach’s edge, where the river ran from the jungle out to sea. The two couples remarked on it seeming out of place, in the absence of rain this sunny afternoon.
“I’m going to stay in the life, with someone who understands it. I can help from here, continuing what I’ve done before on the internet, helping hunters around the world.” Sam turned and placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “I thought you were ready to try something new, too.” His eyes searched Dean’s out through his too-long bangs. “You don’t have to go back to Lebanon. You could go anywhere, do anything now, with Cas!” Sam’s building enthusiasm fed the fuel of Dean’s anger like a bellows. Dean clenched his fists.
Dean nods. “Oh,” he repeats. Dean still hasn’t made any move to get off his bed or any other movement towards actually getting this tattoo process started. Cas is a bit confused. He had thought his request would explain to Dean that his feelings are reciprocated. Perhaps Dean is more resistant to a relationship with him than he even fears. For the first time, Cas feels the silence between them becoming uncomfortable instead of intimate. Dean wets his lips quickly, then asks “so, uh, what are you gonna get?”
No. Today was about changing all of that. He took a deep breath and tried some pop psychology ‘reframing’ technique Sam had told him about once upon a time, when shit had been really bad. “I fucked up,” said Dean to himself in the dark garage. “But I am not a fuck-up.” Dean squeezed his hands around the wheel one more time and opened the door before he could second-guess himself. He grabbed his loot out of the trunk and strode purposefully into the bunker.
Dean scrubbed his scruff with a hand. “Yeah, uh, hunt. Some of us actually care about saving people, hunting things, remember?” Good one, Dean, he thought. Passive aggression. Not just for 1950s housewives anymore.
“You wanted to carry a physical memorial to me on your body permanently?” Cas clarifies, speaking quickly before Dean escapes.
“On it,” Dean replied. He indulged in a slow roll of his ass backwards into Cas’ groin. “Unless we have time for something else…?” He let his voice peter off, snaking an arm above his head and around Cas’ neck, carefully avoiding getting burger goo on those dark curls.
Dean sighed and listened for Cas’ even breaths. Focusing on the soft classical music, he quieted his racing thoughts, and was eventually overtaken by sleep.
, thought Dean. His thoughts were interrupted by six-and-a-half feet of his brother hugging him warmly. Dean hung on gratefully, and didn’t let go until Sam did first. “Merry Christmas, Sam,” Dean said. He thrust a package at him. Sam raised his eyebrows in question, but Dean just jerked his chin, indicating he should open it.
“I told you not to mention that stupid pagan rip-off fake commercial holiday to me,” Cas said haughtily. His words were harsh but there was no fire behind them. In fact, he seemed to regard Vernon with something approaching affection, taking in his long, bowed legs and lightly freckled cheeks in a weighty stare. Cas didn’t seem embarrassed at his erect cock sticking out of his jeans.
Dean ditched his empty beer bottle and rummaged in the bunker’s kitchen cabinets. His intake had been particularly heavy lately. Christmas Eve was a terrible time to run out of Hunter’s Helper. He should have asked Sam to pick some up when they were off singing carols and ice skating or whatever other Peanuts Christmas nonsense he had been up to with Jack in town. Fuck it, there had to be some ancient shit buried back in one of these cabinets, he thought desperately.
“I’m not afraid anymore” Dean whispered, his voice scratchy, as he scrambled out of bed. “Thank you Jo, thank you Charlie, thank you Billie!” Dean closed his eyes, overcome with feeling. “Oh, Bobby, thank you so much! That was the best night with three women from my past I could ever have imagined.”
Gabriel throws his head back against the green vinyl recliner. Hysterical laughter barks, harsh, into the tense silence. Dean’s smile runs cold like it’s washed right off his face. Cas’ blue eyes shuttle back and forth between them like he’s watching a ping-pong match, confused.
Jack was still doing his best Cas impression, all stoic impassivity. In fact, Cas was currently narrowing his eyes at Dean from what he could see out of the corner of his eye. Dean hurriedly added, “I never really got good, but I know the basics. I could teach you. If you want.”
“Nah, I think I’m just garden variety cuckoo. Remind me to NEVER get a massage again,” Dean joked, pointedly *not* looking as Cas crossed the room and dropped his sheet, pulling on his robe, his back to Dean.
“Sam!” Cas said in a warning tone, cutting his eyes at Jack who was watching, nervous and confused. “It’s Christmas.”
“I’m running out of time here, Dean. We’re not doing this to hurt you. It’s just the mission. I’ll speed it up if you can hang in there and we’ll get through this.” She placed a gentle hand on his arm. She managed to convey warmth through her ghostly cold fingers.
“Commie bastards sure know how to make a spirit. Am I right?” the sandy-haired angel says. He sloshes them all another hefty measure.
I wrote myself in a bit of a corner because I was all like, you know what would be great? A fun casefic mystery! And original characters with backstory! And another relationship with Sam! And...wait, I have to weave those all together and resolve them now? Ah, shit.
Cas continues. “Dean says he got the tattoo to ‘remember me by.’” Cas doesn’t use the air quotes but thinks them, nonetheless. “But I noticed the other day when you changed into a clean shirt at the motel that you did not have one.” Cas tilts his head. “At least not in a location visible on your torso.” Sam makes a noise halfway between choking and coughing, but Cas persists. “So I was wondering why Dean would memorialize me in this manner but you wouldn’t.” Cas waits patiently for the response.
Dean looked at his phone and saw it was Sammy. " Fuck, Cas we got to go pick up my brother," "Come on then i have to pick up Gabe to we can go together." They got off baby's hood and went to their seats. Then they drove to Lutheran High School-Sioux Falls. Just before they drove off, the two boys looked at each other, Cas looked into green emerald eyes. Dean looked into cas's icey blue eyes. They lean in and...
I layed down not believing what I saw, a man in a trench coat, a blue tie, black hair and the most bluest of blue eyes, told me not to come here, fuck i thought imma get kidnapped. I closed my eyes and drifted into an uneasy sleep thinking about my past. Why was I left on her doorstep, did my family not want me? Did they not care if she didn’t take me in?, Will I ever know where I'm from?
I normally don’t back down from a fight, but this time I wasn’t ready. I took my phone out and turned the brightest all the way down and texted sam. Baby Moose 😈
I was confused, I guess he saw that in my face. " Oh, you're wondering how you can be killed. You can be killed by...." Just then someone burst through the door yelling , "OWEN WHY DID YOU TAKE MY CHILD!!” That was not the redhead's voice. Then someone came behind me and knocked me out again.
“Charlie, baby where are you.” Someone yelled. “Right here.” I had yelled back, then this man came out of nowhere and said, “You will be useful soon, not right now but soon, in 10 years you will go to Las Vegas and hear this name Jack Key, and when you do just know you won’t be back until the day you see this,” Sees a picture of a circle with an X through it. “CHARLIE,”
Dean stared after him for a few moments. Then he crossed the room to open the door. No one was in the dark parking lot. Dean returned to sit on the bed, fully dressed, and turned off the TV. He had lost his appetite and left the pizza untouched. Fatigue suddenly dragged at him. He flung an arm across his eyes and passed out
They arrived in Dean’s recent memory. It was the hunt gone wrong with Cas last month. The moment he had fucked it all up and the reason he was running right now, in fact. They were in a motel room. Tipsy past-Dean had a hand on the door just above Cas’ shoulder. Cas was standing close (of course) and breathing heavily.
“Can you maybe-” Dean waved his other hand to indicate her head, shining like a beacon in the dark parking lot.
Dean sighed and crossed his legs, pulling out his phone to find a local pizza delivery place. He placed an order (pineapple and ham, just to be spiteful.) He considered getting in the Impala and finding a quiet rest stop to sleep overnight to escape the probable bedbugs he was risking here, but the temperature was just low enough to make that option dangerous. This place was cheap and gross, but then again, no better than what he deserved. He then picked up the remote and discovered the TV (so old it looked like it still had tubes) only carried four local channels. He was still flipping idly through them when a knock came at the door.
“Point is,” She finally turned her deep brown eyes to Sam. “They had a lot of enemies. They both got sick eventually. One day they both disappeared. I never saw them again. Did they get kidnapped? Murdered? Or just abandon me?”
Dean did an honest-to-Chuck spit-take, spraying gross cooking sherry all over the clean tabletop. “Cas and I did not have a fight, I told you.” Dean growled, low and dangerous. “He just flapped off to do some angel shit after the hunt. Like always. I’m not his keeper.”
Sam kicked open the cooler at the foot of the table and cracked open two fresh Beliken beers for himself and his brother. Dean took it suspiciously, studiously avoiding Sam’s eyes to worry at a knot in the teak wood of the table. Sam leaned back in his chair, stretching his long legs out and took a deep breath. A tight fast rush of anxiety fisted at Dean’s neck, and he shoved his chair out, walking to the railing of the treehouse, putting his back to Sam. It didn’t prevent him from feeling the expression Sam was making at it; parts hurt, concerned, and annoyed.
