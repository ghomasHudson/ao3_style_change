Friday was the opening night of the play and Sam gave me the best present ever. He wouldn't tell me who he was going to be when I asked. Kept saying it was a surprise and I’d know once I saw him.
My biggest fear is that he’ll shut me out and that’s the last thing I ever want. It took him so long to tell me about his life in the first place. Now, he doesn't shut down at all anymore when he talks about his family with me. And I like that. I like where we are. I like that we can share anything with each other and the other one doesn't think anything weird about it.
The morning of the trip was pretty hectic. We ended up waking up half an hour late for the airport. It was a good thing that Cas suggested we pack up the car the night before or we’d be kind of screwed. While we were checking in our bag Cas thought he forgot his passport for a little bit but it was slid down to the bottom of his backpack.
The second week after school started, Cas and I took a drive around town and found this cool coffee shop called Back in Black. Cas described it as rustic looking. I liked it because of the reference to AC/DC. It’s become our favorite place. They make the best coffee.
The whole class split up into groups after the teachers set out the rules. Basically, we had to stay with our groups at all times and we had to go to a checkpoint so we could be accounted for every couple of hours. They also gave us a scavenger hunt we could do for extra credit for history class.
When it got too quiet, I started talking about my friends. She perked up when I started talking about Cas.
And that was when Sam found his voice. It was then that I knew he was definitely going to be a pain in my ass.
Another part was when I learned how to control myself around food. This meant cooking with it and being around it. I had liked cooking for a while, but this made me love it. It was a good outlet to learn about food and control it in a nonconstructive way. I started to see food as less good or bad.
I was sent home with about half a dozen pamphlets (Sam ended up stealing those to read), a glucose monitor, about at least 50 paper test strip things, and these pens that had rapid and long-acting insulin in them. Rapid-acting was mostly before meals and pre-bolusing when I ate something that I knew had more carbs than usual. Like one cookie, probably not, but four? Definitely. Long-acting was to cover me when I wasn't eating like at night time and throughout the day.
I think I hear Kevin talking in his sleep in the other room. Not really sure what he’s saying, it’s like in another language. I gotta go, I have to record this shit.
I’m finding out that having the D-bag around is like having a full-time job that goes on every hour, of every day, of every year, that you can't quit.
I’m sure right now he’s hanging out with his friend, Sarah, studying for what I can assume, is another test. They’re two peas in a nerd pod if you ask me. Sammy says he doesn’t like her like that, but he and I know that’s not true.
Coach ended up making Benny the team captain. His brother Tim had also been captain his senior year too, so he was pretty excited about it. I gave Benny some black licorice to congratulate him.
After breakfast, he pulled out this worn envelope from his pocket. It was a crinkled check that had about 3 different pen colors on it, and it was in the amount of 20,000 dollars.
He dropped his pencil, rolled out his hand and rubbed his wrist hoping to alleviate the cramp in his hand. Dean looked at the small chip in the corner of the window. It was bigger than it had been two months ago. Probably having to do with all the snow they’d been getting recently.
I think Cas and I have either been too lowkey about our relationship at school, or people at school think I’d just cheat on Cas and date anyone with legs.
Anyway, as I'm writing this, I’m sitting in a motel room. We’re here visiting Kansas State University and I'll get to that soon, but last weekend Cas and I ditched the school’s Prom and went to the Haunted Prom.
I just feel more relaxed since going on the pump and I’m glad I got it. It didn’t fully eliminate the bad days but it’s helped a ton.
I love Cas a whole lot but he doesn't know how to cook worth a damn. The guy cooks like he’s spent two minutes in the kitchen his entire life. I’ll give him prompts for trying, though. When he kept burning the pancakes, I took over. He decided to make everyone peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch the next day. Which I thought was an excellent choice.
Anyway, Cas is coming over later after my shift to talk about the summer reading I was supposed to do. This year the book is Into the Wild. Cas says I’d like it but I doubt it. I read two pages and I fell asleep. We’re probably going to have one of those Socratic seminars or something. I usually just make up some shit and call it a day.
So that's how we ended up at Cas’ place, me in his robe with nothing underneath, hair still a little damp. And it wasn't like Cas hadn't seen me naked before... obviously, but this was way more… not sure... intimate? The flower crown that Cas put on my head didn't help. I thought about taking the continuous glucose monitor off, but it was a new one. Cas also said it wouldn’t ruin anything.
The night after our high school’s prom, Cas drove us both to the Stilinski house and I immediately thought of Bela and that pocket watch she ended up getting. She told me that the watch had been cracked and set to 1:11 supposedly when the crime happened.
Being bisexual wasn’t something I’ve really thought about, let alone considered myself before. I have always just been attracted to girls and assumed I was straight… although there’s something about Doctor Sexy that gets me. And I’m not afraid to admit that. If anyone ever made fun of me for it, I’d give them something to really laugh about.
When I was done telling her, she called me an idiot. She also said that anyone with two brain cells could tell that Cas and I definitely had something between us. Apparently I have one brain cell.
But out of everything, what scared me the most was that she wasn't wearing her cross necklace anymore. I had never seen her without that necklace. When I asked her about it, she just told me that she had misplaced it.
Cas just listened to Gospel music, which I knew he would do. Dorothy’s music taste didn't go past the 60s. Charlie was into Alternative Techno, but I don't think anyone missed it when she slipped in Walking on Sunshine about five times. I have a feeling she’s the type of person to listen to that song 35 times in a row at the BARE minimum.
After dad mentally scarred me for life, we had a family dinner together with Cas and it wasn't as awkward as I thought it was gonna be. I think maybe Dad is getting more used to Cas. Though, I’m not sure if they know when the other one is joking or not.
The fact that Cas is more experienced than me came in handy. Once I got the hang of it, it felt real nice. Never thought I would’ve been into dirty talk before I met Cas but holy shit. I was pretty much done for when he started talking in my ear.
Dean couldn't remember a time when he hadn't had the markings. The Guardians had said that the markings made them all unique. The marks reminded Dean of a circuit board. Lines and dots connected by a square. Each time those with the mark went somewhere or left the house, they always had to scan it. Dean and his little brother, Sam had once counted the dots. Sam had counted 23 dots connecting those lines on himself and 27 on Dean. At first, they had thought that maybe the dots correlated to the age they were going to be when they would be completed.
I ended up spending a lot of time hiding away in the treehouse. It got to a point where if my family couldn’t find me anywhere in the house, I was in that treehouse.
For almost three years I fed into that lie. I don't even think I had a real goal by then. It was just something I had to do to keep this streak in my head.
The hike took about a couple of hours. I kept asking how much longer, and he got so annoyed that he stopped answering me after the 10th time.
The first question I asked the nurse was if I could still wrestle. She answered with a yes and that exercise was good and it could actually help lower my blood sugar when needed.
You’re 18 now and leave for college tomorrow and I am so damn proud of you. I know I don’t tell you often and I should. I just want you to know that you’re growing up to become a good man.
I didn’t know what to think of them when they started so I just pushed them aside. Sometimes when he’d get close to me and I felt the heat on my face. Also sometimes I would watch him without realizing it. And then when Bela said something, I denied it because I wasn't sure what it all was myself. Then on the Ferris wheel, I panicked.
Cas and I just had our 4th wedding anniversary this past July. We got married on July 27th, 2024. The wedding was on a Saturday in December. We had been engaged for 2 years and out of college for a little more than a year and we both had just gotten jobs where we currently live in Lebanon and we just decided that fuck it, let’s just do the damn thing. I wanted to get married at the courthouse, but Cas wanted all the family and friends to be there. Took about all of January and February to plan the damn thing… well, it took so long because Cas was very indecisive. We decided to have the wedding in Lawrence even though we lived in Lebanon. A lot of family and friends lived close to the area so most of them were able to come.
I think it was at that moment that I decided I couldn't let him go again. I needed to mend this relationship for myself. I had held onto this pain because I was afraid if I let it go, all this hurt I had experienced would have been for naught. That Michael would get off scot-free. But I was wrong.
Actually, before we came to Bobby’s Sam and I had to clean the attack and I found letters from my mom for all three of us. It was dated when I was 10. She kept it short, sweet, and simple.
He falters a bit. “Right... the guardians used to say something similar to that. They’d used to tell us that our art was special... that we were special.”
So, the honeymoon stage is over for me. I'm kind of glad because now I can get straight down to business. I’m getting fewer lows now which is great. But, I’ve also been experiencing... I guess burnout. I know that there are people who have had type 1 since birth and I've only had it for around 8 months, but sometimes I just get tired of it.
I didn't get much sleep last night on the account that I really fucked things up with Cas. I couldn't get him out of my head and the kiss.
We ended up signing up to adopt two years ago, not really in a rush for everything to go through though. We got a call last Halloween saying that they had found someone for us, but that her situation wasn’t... “typical” but wouldn’t tell us anything else before they set up a time for us all to meet.
When it was time for lunch, I thought it would be wrong to not invite him to sit with me and the group.
When we got our album back, there were so many pictures. There was one with me and Nurse Mildred by the food truck, Garth sticking bunny ears behind my head… Max and Alicia and I showing our pumps, Cas grabbing my butt (god...), Bela and I eating some of Cas’ cake (it was his third piece, come on). A lot of good memories in there.
Cas said that he was applying for colleges and told me that I should apply too. At a point in my life, I wasn't even considering ever going to college. That was also around the same time where I cared more about calories than anything else. So, I figured what the hell, it wouldn't hurt if I applied.
We made small talk for a little bit. Asking about the weather as if we hadn’t both been in it less than 10 minutes ago.
Took me about 8 months to find another job. Now I work at this cool company that manages systems for other big facilities, but during those 8 months without a job was hard. It was hard having only Cas support us. Diabetes ain't cheap. To save money, I started doing multiple injections. And I felt… kind of useless. I began to throw myself into workouts actually. I didn’t even realize It was becoming an issue until Cas mentioned that he was worried about me. At first, I told him that he was overreacting, and we started fighting about it… actually we began to fight a lot more. About stupid shit too. So I in turn decided to workout every day, sometimes twice a day.
There’s nothing quite like having to stick a straw through the tiny hole of a juice box while you're shaking because you're low. Oh, and granola bars taste so much better when you eat them at 3 AM in the morning.
I switched colors the next round thinking I might have a chance. When that didn't work, I tried to distract Cas by touching behind his knees. Found that spot when I was using my tongue to... yeah, you’ll totally remember.
He used an arm to hold Cas’ hips down when he felt him trying to thrust up. Cas’ fingers weaved through his hair and it makes him beam. He loved when he did that.
I don’t think I’m going to do wrestling next year. Benny wants me to though. It’s Senior year and I think I want to try to get a job.
Didn’t know how to answer that question then, but now I think it means that I’m bisexual no matter who I was with. Just because I was with a guy didn’t mean I was gay. And if I was with a girl it didn't mean that I was suddenly straight either. Sort of defeated the whole bisexual part. I’m still trying to figure it all out but all I know is that I like Cas.
He always had hated the snow. Cas had always thought it made everything look beautiful. When Dean made a face, Cas would add that it was unavoidable, so they might as well enjoy themselves. Dean saw it for what it was, a cover-up. Once it melted everything ugly underneath it made itself known again.
Even though I had to pre-bolus a unit before I ate the three cookies, then another two units after I had miss calculated but, I guess it was worth the extra poke.
She kept the secret, but when everyone started noticing that she was pregnant, and wasn't married, everyone started talking. Her parents kicked her out, and she started living with my aunt Tessa in Lawrence, Kansas for a little while.
So, we started planning for Myrtle Beach back in February. This is the longest trip I’ve had to pack for since diagnosis. Packing clothes and things took me like 10 minutes. Both swimsuits, shirts, shorts, 1 pair of jeans, soap, toothbrush. Simple. When it came to the other stuff, it took me a little longer. I had some clue of how much stuff I have for my type 1 but seeing it all laid out is a different story entirely. It took up all the space in my backpack. I had to pack: my insulin pens, the needles, my meter, batteries, a ton of test strips, extra lancets, alcohol swabs, extra CGM supplies, glucagon kit, glucose tablets, and tons of snacks.
I think the reason it made me mad was that I had started to come to grips with the fact that I had been struggling through an eating disorder.
I told them about what I had been doing for the past few years. I told them about the throwing up, the fasting, the exercise, and I didn’t stop there. I told them what happened at school that had triggered my goals and about the nickname too.
Cas got a job straight out of college and he liked it at first but started hating it like 6 months in. His boss Metatron sounded like an asshole.
I figured it would be a nice distraction. I just found out that Cassie’s moving. She sat right in front of me in first period and didn't tell me.
Cas was pretty pissed and ended up taking me back to the dorms when I started trying to eat everything in sight at the party.
Since I had already lost 10 pounds, an extra sandwich or an apple, at least in my mind at the time, was going to jeopardize that. The kids at school had even stopped calling me Dean-the-Bean, and girls started talking to me.
During the first week of school, I woke up to this continuous screech at 6 AM in the morning. At first, I didn't know what was happening until I realized the sound was coming from my pod failing. I had to turn the lamp on and change it. Then I watched some tv on my computer to make sure my levels were good.
During the coming weeks, I decided I wanted to at least lose 4 pounds. Guess I picked it ‘cause it was an even number. I gave myself two weeks to reach my goal.
Cas has never made a comment about the two devices, but it’s never out of my mind. When we have sex, I just kind of tell him where each site is, and he tries not to touch it. I’ve had a couple of site dislodged during and I didn't know it till afterward. Until I started feeling off.
Also, I wasn’t allowed to go to the bathroom an hour after dinner. To add on top of the shit show, my mom ended up changing her hours to be able to be home when I was home. She was the one who would take me to and from group therapy.
Last week, I was running on the high side for a couple of days straight and finally, I thought, fuck it, I’m just gonna eat whatever I want.
Went downhill from there. Sam told me what had happened because I couldn’t remember much other than this burning sensation everywhere. I passed out. Got glucagon in my thigh. Puked on Sammy (ha). Went to the hospital for a few days.
My favorite part of the day is story time before putting Journey down for bed at night. Sometimes if I don’t have a book, I’ll talk to her about random things. Hell, the first night with her I rocked her and told her about all my fears about being a dad and the mistakes I'm probably going to make.
During my routine teeth cleaning, Mom made a comment about some slight erosion, and I thought she suddenly knew, but she ended up switching the kind of toothpaste we used at home. She thought it was the sweets and juice I was sneaking, and I didn't correct her.
This time it was some tendons in Cas’ left foot. From then on, he had trouble walking long distances because of the stiffness. Dean hadn't at all minded giving him piggyback rides, but he had wished it was because of different circumstances.
Since she died, he’s thrown himself into his job more. At first, I thought it was just a phase when he started bringing his work home, but this phase has been going on for almost a year and a half now with no signs of stopping.
I know Dad can be a little hard on you sometimes, but you've been dealing with the “d-bag” like a freaking pro. I’m not sure I could ever deal with something like that.
This guy, Victor Henricksen, was known for throwing big parties. He’s actually in one of my classes. He’s studying Mechanical engineering like me. This guy falls asleep in class every day and fucking gets straight A’s.
We were so tired when we arrived at the hotel that we barely looked around much before we took a shower and went to bed. When we did finally see it, it was nice. Cas picked a good hotel.
I apologize for intruding on these letters of yours. Sam told me about your letters to your future self so I decided to write one to add to your collection.
He then slipped in, so casually might I add, that we were leaving at 3 AM in the morning. I almost refused right then and there, but then Cas gave me his puppy dog eyes that would give Sammy a run for his money. Sometimes I don't even think he knows he’s doing it which is the worst part.
Dean’s favorite thing was to watch his lover as he came undone like this. Loved the way that his cock was leaking, all because of Dean. Loved the way that he responded to his every touch. How his eyes squeezed shut. Loved the way his hair was wet with sweat. He loved that he was the only one who had and will ever see him this way. He loved that he will remember this moment forever.
It was pretty scary to see you so out of it. You kept flailing your arms and legs but your eyes were barely open. And you were crying. And that was before dad had even checked your levels. When he did all you kept saying was “other finger” and “hurts” but we weren’t sure if you meant just your fingers or your whole body. Dad just picked the pinky and later we found out that you had pricked the pinky that morning. Sorry about that. Guess it would've hurt.
There were more bad days than good days in the first few months. I’m not talking about physically binging and purging necessarily (which I continued to do sometimes) but sometimes I would think about my body negatively. Or I would look too long in the mirror. But, even though I had bad days, it didn’t mean that I was a failure (shout out to Jody for that one).
She made that hair cut her bitch. Dorothy really must’ve done a number on her. She’s never done something that drastic after breaking up with her other past girlfriends.
My management of it has gotten better. I obviously still have highs and lows but all in all, I think I’m doing okay. My A1c is now at 7.1 which isn’t bad but It isn't much different than my last A1C back a few months ago.
I noticed something was up a little before you told us at the hospital that one day, but I just didn't know what it was. I guess I started to notice weird things like how you'd finish your plate but never ask for seconds like you used to do. Or, how you'd always go to the bathroom right after we were all done eating. Once or twice I heard you in the bathroom. I didn't understand it back then so I didn't say anything.
No, but for real. I guess following Charlie's spectrum thing, I'd say I'm in the middle with maybe more towards the lady side because I’ve always liked girls before I met Cas.
That little girl has been the reason for a lot of sleepless nights. She can roll, sit up on her own, and will grab anything in sight. It’s why depending on which arm my pump is on, I’ll make sure to switch how I hold her. She can't take it off but he has dislodged the cannula before. Not fun.
To get him back, I put a chicken bouillon cube in the showerhead. I love the sweet sound of a very angry Sam. Imagine his surprise when he realized the towel he was going to be drying off with had gelatin powder on it. When he finally got out, I was sitting eating cereal and wiping away tears from my eyes.
I wonder what would have happened if I hadn’t had passed out that one day in January—if I would have ended up like Bela. The thought has always been in the back of my mind. I deceived everyone for around three years and I know I wouldn’t have stopped on my own.
We didn't really talk about it again that night which I was grateful for. It was fun just hanging out and not having to worry about this thing for a little while.
I’m sure never in a million years Cas would have thought his mom and dad would both come to his wedding. The three of them even took a picture together.
Things started to look up by the middle of the day. When you finally had enough energy to talk, you didn't remember much of the night before so we had to fill you in. You were also still too tired to do much of anything else.
There were several parts of the treatment process that were used to restructure my thoughts and feelings about food and my body image.
Turns out I wasn’t even that bad. Better than Benny, anyway. We just told him to keep his hands off the buzzer. It wasn't that he wasn't smart, he was just a little trigger happy and then froze when he actually had to answer.
I was at the store with Benny and we were getting him more resistance bands when I passed by a scale. I didn’t think much of it at first but that same night I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I think it was the fact that it looked like our old one.
I got a diet Coke and went to say hello. The friend, Meg, asked if I were Castiel’s boyfriend. Castiel turned red and I almost choked on my soda. Spent the last 10 minutes trying to ignore the burning feeling in my nose.
It actually really has helped with my recovery. I started working out with a few people on the team because Dad said he didn't feel comfortable with me working out alone. I was annoyed at first, but working out with teammates is kinda fun. We talk most of the time about girls. But sometimes it’s just stupid shit.
I thought everyone had been asleep until I heard a knock on my door. I tried to say go away, but it wouldn’t come out.
As soon as I sat up, I could feel the headache coming. I checked my numbers manually to just be sure and all it said was HIGH. Which pretty much means you’re fucked I guess.
So, in this post or letter or whatever you want to call it, I’m supposed to tell you what’s happening in my life right now. The next entries are just random thoughts and feelings or whatever... maybe stories and life lessons I guess?
When I got back to the table my family didn’t notice anything off about me and I had room for dessert.
Benny, Kevin, and Bela didn't help when they were telling me stories of when they got theirs taken out. Benny ended up telling his dad about the time he got shitfaced when he was 16, which he denied later when his dad asked him about it. Kevin said he recited SAT vocabulary definitions the whole time. Bela said her face swelled up a ton.
I didn't think he was serious because of how casual he was about it. To be honest I wasn't even thinking about going. Prom’s never been on my radar. Jokingly, I asked him if we were going to wear matching tuxedos.
Took less than a minute for Cas to move over. We just sat there swinging for a bit. It was so hot and humid our arms were sticking together with sweat and the only thing that was keeping us semi-cool was the swinging. It was quiet and I could barely breathe but it had little to do with the air and more to do with what I was feeling.
When I was at 110 and ketone levels were at bay, Dad went to bed. I went to bed when I was at about 120. By then it was also 6 o'clock in the morning and I was also half dead and fighting off the end of a headache so I went back to sleep.
When it came to music questions, I mostly dominated them. And Charlie and Kevin knew a lot of other questions.
Bobby, Jo, and Ellen arrived this morning to spend Christmas with us. Jo and Ellen have been into archery lately and they took Sam, Cas, and me to go try it out. I’ll admit, I didn't believe Jo and Ellen when they said archery would be hard, but I should have. My shoulders and arms still hurt. Cas was complaining about his back hurting even. We’re totally going again tomorrow after I meet Bela for breakfast. It's our thing now. At least twice a year, we catch up doing the thing we used to hate the least when we met each other in that eating disorder group. She's been doing really good lately. Hasn't ended up in the hospital in almost 2 years and even has a boyfriend. I can't explain it, but she has this glow about her that she didn't before...
I told him that Cassie and I had been broken up since the beginning of the year and I had noticed my feelings for Cas in the summer. It wasn't actually that sudden.
The sky was blue and there was a cloud that vaguely looked like that fish Dory. Which reminds me I need to watch Finding Dory soon.
Dad tried to get you to eat more than a piece of toast with jelly but you said you felt like you were gonna puke. And then you went to go lay down on the couch per dad’s request since he wanted to keep a close eye on you.
We left after Sam kept shivering. I keep telling that kid he needs to eat more but he doesn't listen.
During the movie, every time there was a sad scene or a happy one, Cas’ fingers would dig into my arm or neck. I guess wherever his hands happen to be at that moment.
He told me that he just couldn't ignore his own behavior anymore. He said that he messed up and when he fully realized it, he didn't think Mom or I could ever forgive him.
So back to that senior trip. So it took a little over an hour to get there. We sat in the middle of the bus. It was really a compromise since Kevin wanted to sit in the front but Benny wanted to sit in the back.
But, even though I didn't tell them that, they still looked at me funny when I told them I had diabetes. They told me that they didn't know that younger people got that or that their grandpa had diabetes. My favorite one was when someone told me that I had the wrong type of diabetes... which, I don't know if either one is particularly right.
Benny could tell that I was off and asked about it. I’ve never been able to lie to Benny successfully. He’d gotten pretty good at telling when I was lying. I ended up telling him something vague.
So this presentation was a huge one and I really needed at least a C on it. Ended up fumbling through it so much at the beginning, I had to take a pause before I started talking again. Cas felt so bad when I told him about it that he promised to do my laundry for the next month. I actually ended up getting a B on that presentation but I didn't tell Cas until after the month was over.
But anyway, I guess when Cas asked me about his dad, all I could think about was my mom and how if I had a chance to have my mom back in my life again, I would do it in a heartbeat. The situations are so different that I guess it was stupid of me to even give him advice.
I also love how your sweet spot is behind your ear and how you like to be the little spoon after we have sex.
To think that almost a year ago, I was so sick that I was drinking a ton of water and eating a minimum of three oranges a day. I think the biggest red flag was the weight loss. I was shedding it without even trying. I knew something wasn't right but I think I was too scared to admit it. Never would I have thought it would have been type one. I can't imagine if Sam hadn't told Dad what was going on or if Dad hadn't been suspicious. I just would’ve ended up getting sicker.
Anyway, we are currently staying in Santorini. It was Cas' idea. I didn't really have a preference where in Greece we went to, but it’s really nice here. The weather has been great too. It’s only rained once since we’ve been here.
After the whole flu incident, I ended up getting a continuous glucose monitor CGM. I've had it for a week now.
And everything that I had planned to say just disappeared and all I asked was if I could have a redo.
I thought about telling Sam and my dad when it had happened, but they wouldn't have understood why I did it. I had also been ashamed of myself. I decided then that I didn’t need my dad and brother knowing how much of I fuck up I was. I didn’t need to see the sadness in Sam’s eyes or the disappointment in my Dad's.
That same weekend, she and Dad ended up changing all the other door handles to ones that you could open with a penny.
The day before yesterday, Cas told me that he wanted to take me to this new restaurant, which I was down for. The only thing I had to agree on was to see the sunrise with him at Skaros rock.
After that incident, it was as if a light switch had flipped for her and she seemed better. She started working again and had even been hanging out with some friends.
There’s a lot of good memories in there and some not-so-great ones that I wish I could forget. Hell, some of these things in here I didn't even remember happening.
We ended up going to his favorite ice cream place even though it was 20 degrees outside. Couldn't find parking close to it because of some festival that was going on in town. Dorothy recently got a job there and ended up giving us one free scoop.
The wedding was at this red barn. It was the first one that we saw actually… out of the seven that Cas had insisted we look at afterward because he wanted to see his other options... Sometimes you gotta laugh at things or you’ll just get mad.
Lastly, I had to practice “self-love.” Or a better term for it “ how to love what you see in the mirror.” I’m still working on that one.
Couldn't get the blood out of the shirt, so Cas just cut the sleeves off. While we were in front of the mirror, he told me it looked better that way and his eyes got about two shades darker than they usually were. Think I unlocked another one of Cas’ kinks…
A couple of days before he invited us to come to visit him, I did something I hadn't done in a while. I sat in my car at the light on the street my mom died on, Mary street, for about an hour that night. It was after I had heard a couple of people that looked like high schoolers at this shop close to Mary street say that they had heard that some woman died while picking up “that one son” from rehab when the crash happened.
His name is Balthazar, I’ve never heard of a weirder name than his and on top of this, he likes to knit. We have grown to like him.
During security, I had to carry all my supplies in my carryon and tell security that I had a CGM and Pump, and insulin pens. I had to get a pat-down. And let me tell you, the guy got a little too handsy for my taste. Cas thought I was overreacting, but I swear the guy for sure squeezed my ass.
It's happening soon y'all! NOBODY PANIC. But damn. almost 4000 hits. I'm proud of this story! Thank you for not letting it flop and thank you to the ones who comment everyone means a lot and I get super excited when I see the notification so thank you! The polls will all be closing soon since this story is almost done. Have a great day!
Kaia said that she didn't know exactly who the father was, but it could have been a few of the guys she met in passing. She just kind of shrugged and said it would be a fun surprise at birth.
Was hoping that this summer Cas and I could get more alone time but that’s not going to happen. His house is free some days though at least.
I also got a job down at school. I work the grill at the Biggersons grill. My boss Billie can be a bitch though. But I gotta earn that college money somehow.
I ran out of the diner but it was too late. I only saw the red car as it drove away. I shouted at her to come back until my throat hurt.
I decided to look up and I felt like my heart was working twice as hard. He moved closer and I thought if I happened to pass out, it would be justifiable.
***Here's the finished product. I actually really liked that he put the CGM on there. It actually took a week after writing this letter. Can’t show it all, at the risk of anyone else seeing my junk*
Also, the more and more I talk to him, the more I realize that Cas' definition of good music is straight-up Gospel. Like Amazing Grace and Silent Night type of shit. I gave him a brief lesson on what music was cool. It was crazy that he hadn't heard of Led Zeppelin or Bon-Jovi. I swear it's like he's been living under a rock.
After a while of doing something every day, you begin to feel numb to it. I had to start using other things to trigger my gag reflex when my fingers didn’t do the job anymore.
I took one bite of it and I swear I heard heavenly music. And what was even better, was that she gave us a pretty good calculation of the carbs and calories in it, so I didn't have to play the guessing game.
Whoa wait, I almost forgot. So, I had just gotten out of class, and I was sitting at one of the tables, and all of a sudden this really tall dude got shit on by a bird. There had to be at least five people around him too when it had happened.
He left three days later without a goodbye. I tried to contact him, but he never responded. I think his grandparents ended up moving not long after.
She immediately called me and started blaming me for him bailing. I thought Cas had said something to her already, so I said something about the kiss. Turns out he didn't say anything about it. Me and my big mouth. It wasn't the worst decision I had made. She was going to be the one in the group who could give me serious advice.
Basically he wanted to go hiking. Last year, Cas had gotten really into hiking. I went once, ended up getting blisters, and never went again. Those damn things took 3 weeks to heal.
Took a lot of convincing that I was fine and that if something went bad, then I’d tell him. And if things went hospital bad, I’d have Sammy call an uber.
Maybe writing this letter will make it easier to eventually tell you about everything that has happened to me when I’m ready.
I sometimes forget that he also has access to my numbers from his phone. Brought me back to high school when he’d used to wake me up when I was high or low.
I rolled my eyes and gave him my favorite finger and I told him that just because I liked Cas, it didn’t mean I was attracted to everything that moved.
Some side effects weren't always shown on the outside where everyone could see. Some were so deep that they only showed themselves when I was alone with my thoughts. They were overwhelming and they came at me in waves. I felt like I was drowning. It made me wonder how I had gotten to feel so empty inside. Or if that feeling would ever go away.
It’s winter break right now. The group, Sam and I went bowling the other day. Benny only got strikes or spares. It didn't surprise me, his older brother Tim, who lives in New Orleans now, used to be really good at bowling too. Afterward, Charlie wanted to go ice skating but nobody else actually knew how to ice skate so we ended up driving through a lights show too.
When we paused at the top, I gripped the bar tight again. I felt Cas grab my hand which actually helped me relax a bit. When I looked over, he was super close. We just looked at each other and I was about to make a joke, but something about the moment was so intense that I didn't. I got this weird feeling like I did when I kissed Cassie for the first time.
Dean felt a tickle on his face and went to wipe. It had been a tear, he hadn't even realized he was crying. He tried not to think about what the next day would bring. He wiped at another tear. He couldn't live without Cas.
It came with some sensors and a transmitter. I replace the sensor after 7-10 days (unless of a sensor failure which has only happened once so far) and the transmitter every three months. It was easy to insert. It came with a little insertion device and didn't hurt like I thought it was going to so I was pretty surprised. I still felt it when the needle went in, but it wasn't too bad.
First I checked the diner but didn't see his car in the usual spot. I was happy that I had more time to think about what all I was going to say to him. I was pretty much a ball of nerves when I reached his house. I sat in his driveway, I shit you not, just practicing all that I had come up with.
At first, I thought you were having a bad dream till I peeped over and you were just sweating everywhere. Like your sheets and you were soaked. I yelled for dad and he came running into the room.
Rafael reminded me to think about management as a delayed effect. Meaning most of what I do, won't show up in the body instantly. And hell, everything affects blood sugar; food, exercise, stress levels, fucking sleep. He also reminded me about the importance of not skipping a meal even though you weren’t hungry. Which reminded me how I had gotten out of the mindset of “is this food good or bad?” only to rephrase the question to “will this food raise my blood sugar?”
All of a sudden they were 15 and sharing their first kiss. 17 and clumsy as they explore one another bodies for the first time. 20 and eager to find more ways to make each other feel alive.
So, a few days ago, I had a Christmas gift exchange with the group. I hadn't seen everyone all in one place since before leaving for college in August. The only one who didn't make it was Dorothy. Charlie and her are still broken up. She still hangs out with all of us sometimes though. Charlie said she was picking up her new dog. I think she named him Toto or something. She must really like the Wizard of Oz.
Dean looked up at Cas who had his arm over his eyes and took the opportunity to lightly squeeze Cas’ balls. He watched as Cas jolts upon his elbows, giving him his full attention. He smirked before he took him fully in his mouth. He grips the base, twisting and pumping with both his hand and his mouth. Never losing eye contact. Teasing him. Cas had once told him that his lips were sinful and Dean had promised from then on that he’d never miss a chance to show him just how sinful they could be. He needed his lover to watch this moment. To see everything that Dean couldn't express with words. To watch him show him how much he meant to him. How much he would always mean to him.
My mom always didn't enjoy talking about it and would always touch this cross necklace when she would. I came to know it as a nervous habit. She would do it quite often.
When I told him that I loved him a while back, he told me “thank you.” I tried not to take it too hard.
We went back to my house since I had already planned on making dinner for the two of us. I ended up making steak in the cast iron. Learned that from Benny. Comes out perfect every time. Served it with roasted potatoes and salad. Almost had a heart attack when Cas said he liked his steak well done.
So, the first day of school went pretty well. Nothing really exciting. A couple weeks in, we made this substitute teacher for Algebra class cry. I’m betting that had more to do with his girlfriend breaking up with him then us being loud… oh yeah and most of us traded names when he did roll call…
Well, I have to go, Kevin, Charlie, Cas and I are going to the lake soon, and I gotta make sure my supplies are all packed.
So, I’m supposed to keep my blood sugar between 80-130 but under 180 after which has been easier said than done. Since the hospital, my numbers have been between 70 and 220. Dr. Walker started me off with around 25 units of insulin per day until we know how much I actually need.
Every day, I live with this constant struggle of who I am now and who I once was. When my dad began to question me, I felt like the old me again. I felt like Dad no longer trusted me.
We almost didn't even make the cookies that year until Ellen asked about them. At first, it was odd not being able to have mom around in the kitchen, but baking those cookies brought us closer to her.
I was actually the first to arrive. Michael came about 2 minutes after me and apologized for being late. Even Though we had actually both been early.
Mom told me to go get a few sheets of parchment paper, but I ended up getting wax paper because I thought it was basically the same.
That time it had been Cas’ left eye. A week after the donation, he had looked in the mirror for the first time and had sobbed. Dean had held him till the exhaustion had put them both to sleep. And yeah, Cas’ eyes had always been his favorite part about him so Dean had been pissed.
After that, we took you to the hospital. Don’t worry, I changed while Dad was getting you to the car.
Claire and Alex are actually pretty cool. Claire teaches guitar lessons and also singing lessons in the back room of the shop. One of her students, who she teaches singing to is tone-deaf. Ash, that fucking jerk, somehow got Chuck to switch all my days with his just so he wouldn't have to listen to that one student.
I think Dad was ready to pretty much disown us after that. He was so mad after. Spent about half an hour yelling at us, but it was so worth it. Sam smelled like chicken and body wash for the rest of the day. Hell, the whole bathroom smelled like it for days after that.
It was a little after Christmas when I began to feel a bit more tired than I typically had been. I thought nothing of it because like I said before, it sometimes happened. But then, it went on for a few more days. I guess it was a little different than before like I couldn't even get out of bed some mornings.
It’s like I have this insatiable thirst that suddenly hits me and I can’t get enough water. Sammy got kind of worried after I told him that and told me that I should tell Dad. Honestly, I’m sure it’s probably my body adjusting to everything but... I can admit that it’s still weird. I’m not sure if I want to tell Dad because I don’t think it’s serious yet. It’s just annoying.
Cas didn't seem like he wanted to find him, but I did some digging. Turns out Dick’s dad is the owner of Roman Enterprise. Sounds like some rich kid that didn't care that he hurt Cas. Couldn’t find anything really specifically on him, until Charlie helped me. Damn, she’s scary when she gets into her FBI mode. She was able to find his Grindr account and his girl’s Facebook.
I’ve gotten more used to the needles at least. Guess I should consider poke myself around 10 times a day. 8 if I’m lucky.13 if I'm not lucky.
He also remembered how red Cas' face turned when they fucked for the first time at an abandoned fairground when they were 17.
They went searching throughout the house and found the opening to the tunnels, where they found the body of Marin half-eaten in the casket that she had been buried in. But that wasn't the most bizarre part. They also found a casket next to hers broken open with nothing inside of it but some blood.
So, when we got to the game room, there were about 20 others already there, either playing video games, pool, or board games.
Caught me off guard. I hadn't actually heard that one before. Knew people were thinking it, but Cas was the first one who actually said it.
The first morning we were here, Benny and I decided to work out. I could tell that he wasn't into it so I asked him about it. He was quiet for a little while but then he finally spoke up and said:
After a few weeks of having it, I went over the 80 hr mark and holy hell, the sound that it made was so loud. Sam ended up putting it in the freezer because we couldn't get it to stop.
He didn’t even react to me pulling the curtain back. I found him just sitting there letting the water run over him.
Haven't don’t more than make out which I’m okay with. Cassie and I didn’t start fucking till I guess about a month in. With Cas, I wouldn't mind taking it slower if he wanted to.
The birth of the baby and the whole adoption situation was hard for Cas. He said after that it brought up old feelings of his family and also Anna. I think it softened the blow when she said she still wanted to be somewhat a part of the baby’s life even though she still wanted to travel. Cas has even been going to therapy about it all actually. He thought it was too late, but I never think it's too late for therapy. Hell, I still have zoom calls with Jody every once in a while. No shame in getting help.
When Dad got home, he wasn’t too happy that I had left him with five Oreos. Said something about teenager’s appetites or something like that even though I was only 12.
I didn’t feel any pain while they were taking the teeth out, but after, on the first day when pain meds started to wear off, it felt like at least 50 people took turns decking me in the mouth.
Well, I gotta go, we’re going out to lunch. Cas found this diner and we’re going to compare it to Tessa’s.
He didn't know that I had been struggling with it for the past few years, but it was still pretty fucked up. Having an eating disorder isn’t about what gender you are.
You slept till 11 am on Saturday morning. Dad and I didn't think much of it because you did that sometimes. But when you finally staggered downstairs you ended up just sitting down at the table and laid your head down. Turns out your numbers were a little low.
I gotta say, I am damn good with that grill. It’s like the grill and I are one, I’m telling you. If you want steaks, burgers, chicken? I got your ass.
I remember it being the chilliest day. Almost like the world knew it had lost someone great, and it was suffering too.
Strike #1 Cas. Haven’t figured out what happens when he gets to strike #3 yet, but it’s gonna be well deserved.
I’d tell a 12-year-old me that he needed to ask for help and what he was dealing with was an eating disorder. I’d tell a 14-year-old me that even though his mom had died, that she would always be with him. I would tell 16-year-old me that having diabetes was going to be hard as hell, but… but nothing, it’s just hard as hell. I’d tell a 17-year-old me that the guy who walked into English with a trenchcoat on would be the love of his life soon. After everything, my life has turned out pretty good. I have Cas, Journey, and Kaia, Daisy, my friends, and family and that’s more than I could ever ask for.
I asked him how he knew all that stuff, but he kind of just shrugged and said it was from porn. When I asked him what kind of porn he liked he just said he wasn't picky. I knew he was lying because he doesn't look at me when he lies. I was snooping on his laptop’s browser history once and it was as clean as a freaking whistle. And the history went back more than a month.
We hadn't had Mom's chocolate chip cookies in forever, and Mom never could say no to a bet, so Dad knew what he was doing. The only food Mom was good at making was tomato soup with rice, sandwiches, and a damn good chocolate chip cookie.
It started at lunch one day. Benny told the rest of the group he was going to help his brother with his restaurant in New Orleans after graduation. He had told me a couple weeks prior.
While Kevin and Dorothy were trying to take a picture next to the bird sitting on the street light, I saw this dude drop his whole ass sandwich on the ground, look around, pick it up, brush it off and then eat it.
Cas extended his hand out and Dean only takes a moment before he took it. He knew that none of it was Cas’ fault but sometimes he couldn’t help how angry he got. He would get in trouble for his anger all the time back at Hailsham. But Dean rarely ever got angry at Cas
So, remember when I talked about that one chick Benny was too nervous to talk to? Well her name is Andrea. Yeah, well they finally started dating in March. He talked about their first date like he was ready to tell her that he L-O-V-E-D her. I talked him out of it just because it was way too early, and he’d just scare her away. After that, he agreed that he shouldn't tell her yet, things were going great pretty great for them I guess.
When you started to wake up again, I felt like I could finally breathe. I think dad and I were both sweating.
Cas and I ended up listening to music in his room afterward. Castiel laying on his pillow and me sideways at the end of the bed.
The last one happened a couple weeks ago, I gave myself some insulin while we were all hanging out at the diner. He asked what it was and I just told him the whole spiel. He got red and said he thought it was drugs or something.
Well, I gotta go study for this Biology test with Cas on facetime. I’m pretty sure I'm failing this final. Garth took an 8-week online course at the beginning of the year so maybe he’ll know….
Dean was from Hailshime, and Cas had been from Shoreham. Cas had found Dean sitting underneath a tree reading a book. When Cas had asked what the name of his book was, Dean had let out a laugh and showed him the magazine in between his book. Dean was sure it had more dicks on one page than Cas had ever seen.
The other day we met up with a nutritionist and she did give me some helpful meals to keep my blood sugar at a good spot. Things like whole-wheat toast with eggs… and (I almost gagged) salsa.
I thought I was gonna have to call the whole thing off because three days before Dad left for his business trip, I was admitted to the hospital with Diabetic Ketoacidosis.
Benny is moving down to New Orleans to help with his brother’s restaurant. He’ll be taking some business classes on the side. I’m gonna miss him, but I know we’ll stay in touch. He won't be coming home as much, but he told me to facetime him whenever I wanted to, and that I could come to visit and he’d give me free food.
We all got to tour the house and some of the tunnels too. It was still a mess and the windows were now all broken from the years of wear and tear. The place also had a heavy layer of dust around it. Found a used condom too.
When we got home we were sweaty so we decided to take a shower. Things got pretty… steamy really quick. But sexy times in the shower didn't actually work out as well as we had hoped. We're usually pretty successful at shower sex, but that shower was a lot smaller than the one we're used to at home. We just ended up settling for the bed.
Then we had sex after for the first time. I kept thinking I was hurting him, but he kept saying I wasn’t because of the lube. Lube was never something I’ve had to use before, but that stuff is fucking awesome. I had actually bought some a couple months ago when I learned about it just in case if we wanted to have sex.
Yeah..... not my finest moment. He was actually pretty mad that I had eaten it in the first place. It didn't matter that I didn't know the brownie had pot in it and he still made me promise I wouldn't ever do it again. I didn’t think much about it at first, but I think it has to do with all he went through with his mom. Or maybe he was just worried about me. I’m not supposed to take too much of that stuff because then I won't be on my A-game, but I gotta say, it felt kinda good but kinda weird at the same time.
She actually didn’t ask us a ton of questions after that. Don't know how she could have with all the food she was shoveling into her mouth. She ordered 2 pancakes, an omelet with salsa, both sausage and bacon, a fruit cup, and coffee. It was more food than Cas and I got combined and when we thought she was done, she ordered a cupcake too. It was fucking impressed. She ate everything too and got a muffin to go.
It was on one of the sunniest days when they got the call that the fourth donation was going to be happening. This time they had wanted Cas’ heart. The same heart that left Dean’s head spinning when he was 15 and falling too hard and too fast for a boy he didn’t even know.
Even though I have mosquito bites between my toes (those little fuckers), it was still pretty perfect.
I opened to the first page before I closed it quickly. When I looked back up at her she had this weird expression on her face. Later thinking about it, I think it was a mixture of sadness and sorrow.
Sometimes he talks about skateboarding and shows me some tricks he’s been working on. The heal flips were pretty cool. He didn't wipe out once.
Dad found out that we were dating about a month into Cas and mine's relationship when he found Cas and I kissing (not making out). He just quietly walked away and was weird around me for a couple of days. Which, I expected.
He went on to say that when my Mom got pregnant, he thought he was a shoo-in to take his father’s job, but his younger brother Luke (who I have never heard of before) got it instead. He said that what he did wasn't right and downright unforgivable, but thought I should understand his thought process at the time.
I had heard some things about the house, but Cas’ friend Meg told a little bit of a different version.
It’s also been a year and six months since I binged and purged and it's a pretty awesome feeling. I hadn’t even realized it till I had my checkup with Dr. Walker. It was my last appointment with him actually. The scale thing was a little moment of weakness, but I think I can say that I've recovered from my eating disorder or at least pretty damn close. A year and six months. Pretty proud.
I was actually impressed with how many questions he answered correctly, but I wasn't going to say that with my team around.
And I guess that makes two of us because I applied to Kansas State University and a few other colleges in September. Only because there wasn’t an application fee.
His face got kind of red after that, and he told me that Sammy had mentioned that I had been losing weight lately. When I looked over at Sam, he was just staring at his bowl of food. I was gonna tell him that I wasn't mad at him, but Dad kept going.
It’s hard to see her and Michael’s faces in the few pictures that I had seen of them together, but the way that she would talk about him made it sound like she really liked him
Anyway, it’s always weird being back in my old room. Everything is exactly the same as I left it when Cas and I moved away three years ago. Cas and I actually live 4 hours away in Lebanon, Kansas, but we always come to Lawrence for Christmas.
The guys wanted me to go up against Cole to see if we could get Suzy Lee's number, but I let Cole win.
Oh yeah and speaking of Sammy, in the future, don’t let him con you into always calling him Sam. It’s lame, and he will forever be Sammy to me. I guess he thinks since his age is into the double digits, he’s all grown up. I’m definitely calling him that every chance I get when he’s a freshman next year.
After we had all finished with the house, and nobody ended up dead, we set up a campfire away from the house.
Last Wednesday, right after school, she brought me a couple of my hoodies and I gave her back the hair ties and books she had left in my room.
Oh yeah, I got grounded yesterday when Dad realized that I was using one needle for both my rapid and long-acting insulin in the morning. He thought it was because I wanted to save money (which wouldn't have been a bad reason now that I think about it), but really it was because I didn't want to prick myself a second time.
I felt like I had failed. I hated myself at that moment. I had a chance to at least call my aunt to get help but I didn't. And if I hadn't left to go cry like a wimp, my mom wouldn't have slipped away.
We made the rule that the driver picks the music, and shotgun shuts his cakehole. It was kind of entertaining. We all have very different tastes in music. Which not to brag or anything, but I clearly had the best taste with the classics and Country. Benny was into Jazz and the Blues.
Nurse Mildred even gave me a hug after the ceremony and wished me luck and told me to visit her whenever I wanted. I gave her one of my pins that said “Sugar-free” on it. She said she was going to wear it on her lanyard when the next school year started.
https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/conditions/osfed <----Talks about how EDNOS (Eating disorder not otherwise specified) is now called OSFED (Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders) These are the eating disorders that look different than the ones most talked about.
It’s been a week since my mom woke up. We’re heading home tomorrow. Back to normal. Tessa's going to stay with her for a little while.
We also do things that we didn't do before we were dating. We’ve only given each other handjobs and blowjobs. It was in the bunker and we were the only ones home. Cas had given me a blowjob before this and I wanted to repay the favor.
The little test strips are now littering my gym bag. Benny picked up one and ended up being grossed out when I told them what they were.
Your number was at a 32 which was the lowest I'd ever seen them. We tried to get you to drink some more juice but you refused to even open your mouth.
One day before breakfast, I ended up taking the insulin pen out of my skin too early and some of the insulin squirted out of the pen. It made Sammy laugh, so it was worth it.
Now he’s been experimenting with different kinds of bread. His favorite kind of bread to make is cinnamon raisin... which is my least favorite but I eat it to support him.
After my second glass of hot chocolate, I decided to take a nap which was short-lived, when Sam woke me up with the request to make cookies. Jo helped out too.
When I told him I was actually working smarter not harder, he turned his head around so slowly and gave me this look that almost made me think Sam was going to become an only child.
They lie there for a moment trying to even out their breaths without much luck. Cas was shaking slightly and Dean is pretty sure he was too. They're a sticky mess of sweat and come, but they don’t care. Every part of him felt boneless but he managed to turn them over, so they’re both on their sides, chest to chest. He then covered them both up again. They’re breathing is getting back to normal but he still feels lightheaded. They looked at each other, and Cas began to laugh. It comes out as breathless but beautiful. Dean doesn't know why Cas is laughing, but it's so contagious that he can't help but join in.
I gotta say, seeing you in that hospital bed was really scary. You hadn’t been hooked up to that many tubes since that one December when we found out about your eating disorder. Once we got word from your doctor that you were going to be okay, I finally fully relaxed.
And maybe it should have made me side with him more, but I just became angrier. I asked him why 3, 8, or 13 were too late to meet me, but 19- almost 20, was perfect?
I had told him I loved him a little after our 6th-month mark at the end of March. We were in the back of his pick-up truck and looking up at the stars and it just felt right, you know?
For the most part, my numbers haven't been the best this whole trip. I've been either running a little higher or a little lower than I’d like. Been making me feel kind of off for a couple of days, but not too bad. Got a text from Dad basically asking what the fuck I was doing, because he gets updates and I sent him a picture of a sandwich and turned off my phone for a little bit. Not doing anything different in particular, it’s just one of those weeks I guess. It could always be a lot worse.
Just answered the door to another lasagna. This time it was from Sarah and… Sarah’s mom. She makes the best lasagna. Sarah and Sam are now in the living room studying their little hearts out.
The few Trigger warnings are at the end. I don’t want to spoil anything but at the same time if you want to see them they’re there.
The only thing that hasn't been going great is the fact that I’ve lost 10 pounds since the season started at the beginning of the month.
It's pretty easy. Took a few weeks to get the hang of a cash register, but now I'm awesome at it. I mostly ring people up, answer questions, organize the shelves, and give people suggestions on songs.
Sometimes I wonder if she hadn't changed her work schedule for me, she would still be alive. If she were still here then Sam and I would have a mom and Dad wouldn't have lost his wife. The guilt has gotten better but it's never gone.
I was in 6th grade and Mom had just gotten me new jeans. They were a little bit bigger than my usual size and loose, but I just decided to wear them the next morning anyway. I didn’t realize when I got dressed that I had forgotten to take off the sticky tag. I managed to go half the day with the tag still on my pants until Abbadon noticed the tag. She ripped it off and showed everyone at the table my size and began making fun. Which was pretty fucked up.
When I asked him about why he was having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich when his aunt was such a good cook, he just said simply said that they were his favorite.
It’s been interesting watching her personality… bloom. She’s feisty like Kaia that’s for sure… Recently she’s been really into throwing toys and food on the floor. The first thing that made her laugh was when I made a popping noise by putting my finger in my mouth. Cas and I tried for months and she laughed at the simplest thing.
He kissed his mouth before he began to thrust. Cas’ fingers found their way to Dean’s back before he feels the sting. With each thrust, Dean could feel the pain as it intensified. The feeling made him feel alive.
Last night, when Dad asked if I was having “issues again”, I felt like he was accusing me of reverting and ignoring all the progress I had made.
A few nights after that, I decided to tell Cas about my past experiences with my eating disorder. He didn't look at me with pity or disgust like Cassie had and he didn't run away either. Instead, he asked me questions throughout and he never once said that he was “sorry.” He told me that even though he would never fully understand what all I had gone through, that he would always be there for me.
He met… well saw this girl who keeps coming into his brother’s restaurant. He’s head over heels for this chick; and he hasn't even talked to her yet. I’ve known Benny for more than 10 years and I've never known him to be this shy around anyone.
That is until Gabriel got really sick at the beginning of October. He told us all not to worry about him, and that it was just the bug, but one day he couldn't even get out of bed.
