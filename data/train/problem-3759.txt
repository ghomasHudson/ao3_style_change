Dean comes howling as soon as the Alpha’s hand barely touches his neglected cock. Before his lax face could smush into the dirt, his Alpha’s large hands flit around his torso, one on his upper chest, the other on lower abdomen and then he’s being lifted up, like a rag-doll, his back to the Alpha’s chest. Dean gasps as those strong hands travel towards his hips and in the next moment he’s being lowered, punishingly slow, on his Alpha’s rock-hard length.
But as the situation stands, he doesn’t really mind the mind-games that his Alpha’s playing here. Of course the man knows Dean inside and out. Of course he knows Dean’s secret soft spot for that cravat. Of course the man knows about the times when Dean gets just a little bit louder whenever he’s held down or tied up. And of course Dean isn’t ready to verbally admit his defeat just now, but he’s quite sure he’s done for here in the next couple of minutes.
Dean hesitates to tell him that eventually the plants will wither inside these stone walls anyway...
Disregarding Dean’s existence once again, he intently continues with the gauze and finally finishes up.
I have never been particularly good at confrontations. The dichotomy of flight-or-fight has never concerned me much – I am the flight-guy all the way. Meg knows this. She has always been my companion when I needed to run away. She was always there to provide the necessary assistance in my midnight escape plans which started from my window and ended at her bedroom door after nights that were more hurtful than others. She would never ask anything on those nights and just pull me under her green fluffy comforter. On those rare occasions when she did ask questions, I wasn’t very forthcoming in my responses. So, she eventually stopped asking and continued just being there. She knows she wouldn’t get her answers. Not from me, at least. So, I don’t feel that bad lying to her face. My acquired skill of poker-face helps too.
“Dear lord!” exclaims poor Becky, seeming even more horrified than before. Dean would’ve felt bad for her if he wasn’t trying his damnedest not to laugh right in her face.
Although the tales of Alphas turning Feral is an occurrence rarer than hen’s teeth, but there are some tales of course. And Dean’s heard the stories, alright! But the curious thing is - Alphas don’t attack their own Omegas. They physically
The Alpha takes Dean’s palm in his own and helps him get down, not that he required any assistance in the first place. He simply appreciates the unceasing touches! Seeing his barely noticeable quiver, his Mate gleans the fur blanket off Dean’s lap, gets him down, and then wraps the fur around him quite snugly. Dean is led down the cobbled path towards the imposing wrought iron-gate, with no other sign of life around, and with nothing but the sound of the wind accompanying them. His Alpha pushes the heavy gate which swung open, and that’s when Dean gets the first real look of his new home.
“No no, I didn’t know how to reach the nursery, so figured I’d wait in the main mart. Got some presents for Cas too,” he says. “Then this drove of people came out of nowhere, so a nice old lady helped me get to the side, the quiet streets. But then she was gone and this girl, I dunno-”
This was followed by a not so hushed quarrel in the Study Room later in the day between the castle Lord and the old gardener, which was then followed by a furious Lord storming out of the castle premises and then not returning for 24 hours straight. To be completely honest it was all becoming a little too much for Dean’s barely there patience!
Both try to quickly pick the presents up before the oncoming crowd stomps his cupcakes to death. Once Dean is finally up on his feet Missouri holds both his hands in hers and stills, for a long moment too. Looking deep into his eyes, her gaze penetrating, almost enough to make him uncomfortable if not for her kind smile. She then gently steers him away from the busy street towards the side of the path. He doesn’t think much about it. Just quietly follows her lead. As if in a trance. Unbeknownst to him, they reach a much quieter part of the mart, with hardly any shops around. His hands still in her hold.
“Love, you told me yourself how John would often go away for long periods of time while you two were still pups. How you had to fend for yourselves, had to care for little Samuel all on your own solely because of the failures of that Alpha. So yes, ‘Hmm’ is an appropriate reaction, I believe,” says the Alpha, too calm, too collected.
“Okay, I’ll see ya later, man! Gotta walk the dog! Come on Gizzie Gizzie girl.. Okay, leave little Stevie alone big girl.
Cas is an exceptionally light sleeper usually. He’s always awake somehow whenever Dean rouses. Staring at the Omega in his intense and not-anymore-unnerving manner. But not today. Today he’s sleeping like a log. Like he has been relieved of all his burdens. Like last night has washed away all his troubles, his worries.
Dean would’ve also felt equally happy if his Father had kept the promise. He wanted his little brother and his Father to finally bury the hatchet in front of his eyes.
gets a reaction from his husband, a deep guttural moan of approval egging Dean on. Dean obviously knows that Alphas don’t usually take their Mate’s bite, don’t like to be marked up, don’t take lifetime commitments too well unlike Omegas. But then there’s Cas, who’s lying under him with eyes so vulnerable and body so pliant, who’s
Dean.. It’s Dean. Without a shirt. With one of his hands in my hair, the other travelling from my naked(!) stomach to cup my face. He seems sincere in his query. Like this is natural. A regular occurrence. Normal. Him. Here.
Well, I can’t really complain about the noise here, can I? If Meg knew about me coming, she would’ve preferred a.. less rowdy place for the celebration, but since it is a ‘surprise’, I should keep mum and just
In between all these castle duties and polite hostility, the short amount of time that he got with Cas was spent in each other’s arms. The sex was still good of course, even if he knew his husband wasn’t all
“Castle. It’s a castle, Rosen,” says Kevin. The poor kid doesn’t even seem annoyed anymore. More like he’s conceded defeat in trying to correct this delightfully fascinating creature.
The Alpha’s eyes squint like Dean has spoken some mystical language. He had the impudence to tilt his head as if Dean is the one being absurd here, while he’s the one who has visibly stopped breathing through his nose.
Because of the Village Mart! The strange people, mingling scents and layers and layers of dust and grime. All of that doesn’t matter, though. It’s the little beggar girl he met toward the end of the noon. For Goodness’ sake! Her gender didn’t matter to Dean at all because she was a kid. A desperate little kid asking for someone’s help to find her lost sister. A kid who miserably clung on to Dean in her distress, subsequently enveloping Dean in her own unfamiliar scent. A kid who was an Alpha herself.
“This dust-pile is yours now, my gorgeous Omega. Anything and everything that belongs to me is yours. Do with it as you please.”
It’s just that, sometimes, I... like speaking for myself maybe, handling myself maybe, not being babied all the time... By Meg. By Gabe. By Bal.
“Wait a minute. Are we talking about the same thing here? Your best-fucking-friend is bleeding on the fucking floor and you’re fighting about who gets to take him to the fucking hospital..?”
And this is a cause for concern because the townspeople say if he doesn’t wed within the week, he could die from his ripe old age of 21!
The only saving grace was his Alpha’s gentle hands holding on to him, rubbing soothing circles on his lower back, bridling Dean’s instincts to hurtle off, keeping him calm and subdued, somehow. Dean had to continuously remind himself of his forthcoming life which is going to be full of new possibilities, of new faces, of a new home, of 12 potential children of his Mate(?), and of course a life full of this warmth that his beautiful Alpha exudes.
He immediately approaches the switch holders but the lamps don’t budge. He knows he should move forward, look for his husband, call for him maybe but some inadvertent force causes him to withdraw. He backtracks and enters the Dining Room instead and sees the broken chairs, the destroyed candle chandelier, and the large table split in half somehow. And how is
The Feral doesn’t stop. Doesn’t hear a thing. He tries to grab the neck again but Dean violently shakes his torso, flails his arms, kicks in every direction possible to be freed from the grasp. Or at least tries to.
I never realized that getting out of bed could be this herculean a task. Still, I try my darnedest to go outside and.. the bathroom.
Dean wanted to stop the coddling at once, but it’s the Alpha’s scent that momentarily stupefies him. The Alpha’s not someone who easily lets his emotions bleed through his scent, especially after their
I am grateful for having met Meg at the age of 7. She has always been my pocket dynamite that I can unleash on anyone at any point of time and she’ll happily oblige. Her streak of violence mixed with a little bit of insanity compliments my placid modus operandi rather beautifully. Sometimes it felt like having my own personal bully to let loose on those who tried the same with me in school. And then later in life, she never stopped fulfilling that role. Even today, Meg’s the closest thing to family I have left.
It’s not that I’m so vehemently opposed to trying new things. I have done so in the past and failed. So, it can’t be that horrible going to see this Pamela lady now. Not like I have anything to lose. Although the first time I met her I didn’t like her much. Perhaps it had something to do with her hands on Dean’s shoulder. Or perhaps not. I can’t say for sure. She doesn’t seem like a terrible human being though. Maybe smug, but not patronizing. Like she knows your entire history before you even tell her your first name. Like she knows everything about your darkest secrets and deepest desires. Like she sees through you. It’s unsettling, really.
. Much like Charlie. But, I have gotten used to her. It will still take time for me to be used to this man. Although he’s been living here for three months now, he’s still practically a stranger.
bestowed with the superhuman ability of sitting still for longer than 5 minutes. While the carriage puttered down muddy paths to country roads to cobblestones and over disquieting hills, all Dean could do was lean forward and peer through the carriage-window as people went about their day, working, walking, eating, playing... living their lives.
Like how the old gardener has started spending a little too much time with Dean in the last month, almost hovering. Like how Dean is barely left alone by Joshua, the supper and the night-time being the only exceptions, as if he’s keeping a watch. Like how he hasn’t seen Cas and Joshua talking to each other at all these past weeks. Not for lack of trying though.
There were days when Cas seemed more withdrawn than usual, purposely looking away, not meeting Dean’s eyes. But then there were also days when Cas outright refused to let Dean out of their bed, both not caring about unimportant things such as food or water, both too lost in the other’s pleasure.
Well, he’s been wholeheartedly stupid his whole life! What’s wrong with another few seconds of sheer stupidity, right? Rather than continuing to fight the raging Alpha’s harsh grip, Dean forces his entire body to go limp. He then gathers every ounce of his strength left, which is not much to be honest, and making quick work of the Feral Alpha’s sweaty fingers, he tries to twist away from the hold instead. The neck twist doesn’t do much for him other than providing a barely there window of respite to puff and pant heavily, taking in as much air as he can at once.
“No, of course not! He doesn’t despise the outside world exactly. Just the few people and the interactions and formalities and traditions and protocols that come along with being Lord of a Castle, he
them that much, okay! They leave their fur all over Baby!!! But, I’m digressing, the point is... Cas, I am with you because it’s you and because I want to be with you. Not because of some fucked up reason that you think has forced me to be here.”
“Cas, it’s okay. You don’t owe me any explanation. Or anyone else for that matter. You want me outta here, I’m out. End of discussion. Relax.”
“The will thing is dealt with. Insurance and the Shop, I’ll handle. Then we’ll move next week, okay? New place. New job. New beginning. It's gonna be just fine. Come on!”
Steve enjoys peace and quiet... Or at least that’s what I think he enjoys, seeing as he doesn’t seek out the porch of Mrs. Tran (perhaps for the fear of being shouted at, like Kevin), or the door of Ash’s dungeon aka lair aka perpetually dark apartment (perhaps for the fear of consuming unwanted elixirs), or even the lawn of Dea…Mr. Winchester, who constantly blares noisy lyrics or in other words loud yelling accompanied by a buzzing sound. Bal told me in college that it’s what they call a Bass Guitar.
“And of course, there’s little Gabriel. He never much liked the land and clothes and wines here, so after our Lady and Lord’s demise he quickly set sail to live across the Atlantic. You must’ve seen the fine silks in your closets and the French mead in the Drawing cabinets. They’re all presents from him! Our Little Lord Castiel especially adores him!”
deeper voice of heaven-Gabe. Well, he always did wish for a rich baritone.. So perhaps the Lord does listen to
apparently.. Well, howsoever long it took, I am out now. I have Gabe’s number, although I never had the guts to reach out to him before.. Or maybe I was just being a salty teen about being left behind.
Cas is an exceptionally light sleeper usually. He’s always awake somehow whenever Dean rouses. Staring at the Omega. But not today. Today he’s sleeping like a log. Like he has been relieved of all his burdens. Like last night has washed away all his troubles, his worries.
And what is more disconcerting is the fact that it doesn’t feel like his sole mission is to keep a lookout for any reoccurrence of the
– Dean hates his husband! Cas walks up to the bed, his steps unsure, stalling. He nervously sets down the tray and then sits on the extreme edge of the bed, as far away from Dean as possible, and well, Dean has had
“But you will, Dean. You will. They all do. Either willingly or they’re made to. It’s easier this way. Go, please.”
that he does. He’s someone who always makes his presence known. He also gets miffed about the fact that I am as silent as I am. I haven’t told him about my years of practice of being able to move silently through the house without alerting Uncle Zach. Dean prefers to call it ninja-skills. I like his version better.
I haven’t spoken to Gabe in 4 years now. Mother keeps a rather strict watch on the phone, which is not surprising, really. She thinks I’ll become another him. She thinks I’ll start a rebellion too. She thinks I’ll start having doubts... So, she’s determined to make me forget about my own brother over time. And she makes me cut ties with Meg too in the fear that I might become sexually active.
It was much later when I saw the broken desk in my room that I realized a fight broke out in here. I strongly believe it was between two feuding rival gangs, seeing the destruction, but the people at the party say it was Gabe and Uncle Zach. Perhaps Mother’s indignation and slap was because of the desk... or maybe because Gabe was being rather loud. And Mother doesn’t quite like such a racket in the house.
With Cas holding him now, even though barely, Dean focuses entirely on his own pleasure. Setting a brutal pace, the previous torturous rhythm now forgotten, he impales himself over the Alpha, riding him in earnest. Dean lets go of Cas’ hands then and shifts his attention to his own nipples. Encircling them, teasing and twisting just the way he likes, with his head thrown back. He’s aware how awfully debauched he must look now, but he doesn’t really care a fig.
Dean wonders if there is some truth to the town-gossip about him and his virtue, because he’s yet to see the entire face of this striking Alpha, half hidden behind his humongous hat, and he’s already up for some quick bed-hopping here. The moment he sees those clear blues close off completely, Dean regrets the words even before the Alpha has spoken them out loud.
Meaning that Cas must’ve sent the carriage two weeks ago, around the same time when the Alpha went missing for a whole day... Dean quickly glances in his Alpha’s direction, hoping that his eyes convey how grateful he is at the moment, and Cas faintly nods, blue eyes shining, chapped lips slightly curved up. Happy. Tonight’s going to be a
“Do you know of any other lodgings nearby? I believe I require a couple nights’ stay, storage for my carriage, a Carer for the hackneys and a Farrier to repair the leaf-spring, please.”
Meg was always furious about the location of my college since she couldn’t drop in any time she wanted to anymore. It was freeing for me too in a sense. Staying away. At least for a little bit. I wasn’t alone actually... Though after a point of time, it did feel like I was alone in a whole city of strangers.
“What,” innocently asks Cas, with mirth in his eyes and face so awfully smug because of successfully distracting the Omega. Dean absolutely
He doesn’t receive any answers though. Cas immediately averts his eyes and buries his head in his awfully large mahogany table.
It’s not a big deal though. Just part of the so-called coping mechanism perhaps. People might think that it makes you feel like you are floating. It is the exact opposite for me, actually. It’s the ordinary days which make me feel like I am floating.. like I am not
. And he lives right next door.. that does not help anyone, certainly not me. I have tried to mind my work but at some point it becomes rather impossible to do so when there are continued visits of different girls or even two at a time or the occasional buff guys, and here I am on work-from-home basis, painstakingly
After he saw Dean’s true to form reaction to the Voice, there was a kind of peace that fell over the blue-eyed man. But of course, it wasn’t some magical or biological response of the Omega. It was just plain shock mixed with confusion after Dean recognized that godawful rumble which made him shiver slightly. It was because of a tinge of disappointment after he heard his husband utter those words which made him lower his eyes. And finally it was a force of habit and Lady Hanscum’s words ringing in his ears which reminded him to bare his neck, so he did.
“We’re having the Handfasting Ceremony day after tomorrow, Father. I really wish for you to come. And Sammy too. Just for a few hours. We can-”
It was a breathtakingly vast expanse of beauty as far as the eye could see. The blossoming flowers and ripening berries with a shallow creek passing nearby painting a picture so bright and full of life. They meet the melodic sounds of chirping birds and whistling wind while squirrels scurry and hares scuttle around them. It was simply enthralling, the unbroken vision of Mother Nature before Dean, intact and untouched by man’s meddling.
and before long Dean’s coming again at the same time as Cas’ knot locks in place. He’s hardly lucid enough to realize when Cas stands upright, holding him like he weighs nothing, his back to the Alpha's chest still, the knot locked in place still, and starts walking out of the Keep, up the stairs and towards their room.
Dean cannot deny that there’s more than a hint of fright underneath the layers of anger and stubbornness and false confidence that he’s displaying at the moment. And he hates the fact that Cas can make out each and every one of his emotions from his scent alone unlike Dean can. But Dean can still easily pinpoint the exact moment that Cas detects that fear in his scent and the harsh grip on his wrists loosens, just a bit. The shift from an ice-cold yeti to a mellowed down but nevertheless stern husband is rather palpable.
After his last and rather hard shove which ends with Cas’ back to the godawful desk, the Alpha’s cold blues and his ever stoic demeanor finally shifts. The Alpha clasps both his wrists which are still tangled with the torn shirt-collar, and in the next heartbeat Dean finds himself forcibly turned, now his back to the desk. The Alpha’s hold is a bit too tight and Dean’s sure it’s going to leave a mark for days. He looks up and anxious greens meet cold hard blues, now tinged with a slight ring of red at the seams. Their previous fights have never come to
Ignoring Dean’s gibe, the Alpha gently turns his palm, washes the finger to halt the bleeding and starts with the dressing.
It is somehow similar to being driven to an unknown destination while being blindfolded, gagged and utterly bound. It doesn’t really matter who is in the driving seat. Either way it’s going to be me who’s bereft of their senses, who’s not in charge of
feels good. It’s like coming up for air... this temporary bout of air. But I’ve always known about the eventuality. Dean doesn’t. He thinks that I can be fixed, that I can be normal... He has hope. He shouldn’t. I shouldn’t have given him that hope. Shouldn’t have led him on. But truth be told, I am more coward than honest. And those warm embraces felt
He feels the harsh intake of his Alpha before feeling the slick and in the next moment he’s pinned on the side-wall, with both his wrists gripped so tight as to stop his blood from flowing. Golden orbs meet angry Reds and everything erupts.
Dean’s eyes linger for a moment too long on the knife, his fingers twitching for some reason, his labored breathing the only sound nearby.
Gabe is on another one of his tirades today. Honestly speaking, I have always (silently) found it pretty amusing when he and Mother fight. I am aware of the potential ear-damage it might cause in the near future but it is too thrilling to miss. However, he sounds... weird again. The last time he sounded this furious was 2 years ago.
“Dean... He’s not mis-... The sheriff said it’s unlikely that he went away on his own volition this time. There was a clear struggle... But they still haven’t found the body yet. No scent tracings, no proof, nothing. So, the person who did it must’ve really known how to... you know-” says Sam hesitantly, his eyes glancing upstairs towards the Study for a fleeting second for some reason.
“Perhaps some deranged loon then. Anyhow, it’s getting quite late! We’re much behind time, milord! Must make our departure at once if we wish reach the castle before sundown,” implores Joshua.
“You can’t just keep calling them big saucepan and small saucepan and biggest saucepan, Cassie! Your Brother owns a fucking Bakery. Educate yourself.”
“Uh, Cas..?” says Dean, hesitantly, and in the next instant he smells the Alpha’s scent deepening, thickening into something richer, almost sweet.
he still holds the Castle Keys, and is round the clock engrossed in bleach and washing soda and paraffin and powder cleansers and the never-ending supply of old rags. So essentially, nothing much has changed for him since his time at the Singer’s Cottage House.
He reminds himself of the once warm sweets in his bags that must’ve gone stale by now, and he determinedly goes further in, past the foyer. Oddly enough it’s the utter silence inside that catches him by surprise. Dean had thought that Cas would come barging out as soon as they arrive but it seems as if there’s not a living soul in here. Perhaps it’s the darkness of the hall or the unlit corridors or the pitch black evening outside the large windows.
“Well okay, let... let’s... Come, we’ll, uh, sit and... Um, okay, what do you wish to do right now, my love?”
Or perhaps this is just some elaborate hallucination I cooked up where my dead family members wrangle over what to do about my bleeding body.
going to die finally and it’s just my best friend having a brawl with my handsome neighbor while I am lying on the living room floor half naked..
Dean gasps when he feels the grip on his hips tightening, but only just so, and in the next moment Cas is lifting him slightly then pulling him down and thrusting up into him at once, matching his pace, thrust for a thrust. Dean’s thighs start quaking, sweat dripping down and soon his movements begin to falter. Just before he could lose his balance though, their positions are being reversed rather carefully, with Cas on top now, his hands boxing Dean in. Dean’s thankful that his eyes remain closed because it’s perhaps too soon for him to take in that sight again. He soon forgets about these unnecessary quandaries as Cas is pounding into him with abandon, driving Dean to the edge, and within the next few seconds he comes with Cas’ name on his lips.
Another thing he adores about their time together is the conversation they share, deep into the long northern nights. About his love for pies and about Sammy’s unhealthy obsession with salads
This was when Mr. Winchester decided to disrupt another one of our quiet afternoons with his loud shriek..? Oh, he sounds scared.. Is everything oka-
Dean finally understands the kind of Alpha this man is. He entered the premises, flared his nostrils, realized there’s a working Omega here, and proceeded to exit. Goodness, are there no fair Alphas anymore? Of course, being handsome does not necessarily warrant the presence of intellect. But Dean had hoped that at least this one would be a tolerable Alpha, if not likable. But he seems more of a traditionalist than Mrs. Butters’ great-grandmother.
, and of the nature. He feels his husband’s warm gaze on himself and it’s already one of the best days of his mated life yet.
“Dean, remember your Handfasting, the day you left… We looked everywhere but he was nowhere to be found and even Lady Milligan had no idea of his whereabouts. She said they were supposed to arrive together at the church but he never showed to pick her up, that’s why she got late and everything... We waited for a couple of weeks, thought he’d be back as always but-”
“Uh... Father had... a few drinks. He didn’t even realize, in fact. It's not even bleeding anymore, see! It was a mistake, really..”
to see those blue eyes, that he needs to be assured right now and put his mind at rest, that he needs to feel safe, feel
Well, if Dean was in his place, he would absolutely do no such thing and release the inner beast right at this second. The desk inside is a rather sturdy surface, after all!
Everything feels kind of stuck. More so than usual. It isn’t, though. It’s all moving constantly, of course. Things. People... It’s me who’s stuck in-between. There’s this perpetual state of.. not knowing. And this uncertainty – it should’ve been sufficient to throw me into a state of anxiety. But, surprisingly, it hasn’t. I should’ve been flighty, nervous or maybe just active.. in some manner. But I am not.
Dean is well aware of his filthy words and continuous pleas and downright demands for his Alpha to take him and then he does. The bite and the knot come together, and so does Dean. His Alpha stares at him for a bit longer than necessary, combs the sweaty hair back with his long fingers, and kisses him insanely, which is about the last thing Dean remembers before he finally passes out.
Dean looks confused about this sudden interrogation. Not that it matters to me. I have been living in a perpetual state of confusion in the past few months and his continued companionship has not helped in the least. So, it’s not really my concern if he feels cornered or if he wants to escape immediately or if he finally wishes to do away with this tolerant façade and show me who the real Dean is. I cannot take another day of him pampering and coddling me just because he saw the cuts... just because he views me as something to be saved... just because he saw me as the victim that I am.
? NO. His husband doesn’t need any contrived flowery oil-mix to smell good, thank you very much. The pocket-camera? Hm, maybe yes but it’s irrelevant if his husband doesn’t like travelling, right. The crack-shot rifles? Not really. His nature-loving husband doesn’t seem like someone who’d enjoy hunting.
Their horses mostly stay beside each other while Cas sometimes leads the way. Dean notices that Cas doesn’t take the usual path they’ve taken before which leads to the main village. Instead they turn to a different route, a much narrower course, not particularly suited to wide carriages, but perfect for lone riders. Further away from the civilization. Dean vaguely remembers that gift-booth girl, Becky’s words about the forests beyond the castle. And soon they’re facing a humongous wall of trees, so dense it nearly alarms Dean, if it wasn’t for his husband’s soothing scent.
“Fine. So get this, I... uh, went to our old house today. To get him, of course. And everything was... upended there, the mattresses, furniture, the crockery!”
“Well, you were thinking about it,” she continues, “come here boy, let me look at you. Hm. You look well, son!”
I was always aware of the fact that I am not going to stay here much longer. Yes, Dean feels good... having
He then meanders to the decorative gifts section which had tiny crystal globes on display and tiny gold-horse figures and carved keepsake-boxes and tiny figurines of the Indian Taj and the French Tower, if Dean remembers any of Sammy’s weird little history ramblings correctly. There are also tiny showpieces of some old cathedral whose name Dean cannot recall to save his life, and a tiny castle... in grey. Resembling his husband’s home... Castle Greystone! He picks up the tiny sphere to make sure if he’s right when–
“Him, ‘twas him, the nice-lookin’ lord. He took ‘er! Took ‘er with him, said he loved ‘er, he said! Took Meg,” she says, looking straight into Dean’s eyes, latching onto his shoulders even tighter, her stare crazed and disturbing. Manic.
“Why does someone leave? Why does anyone stay? You could drive yourself nuts asking questions like that!”
Dean thinks that the Alpha doesn’t have the heart, as well, to appreciate or even acknowledge the magnanimity of Dean’s benevolence here. He has ignored plenty of Alphas during his long life of 21 years, but he has never been on the receiving end of outright dismissal. Either this Alpha abhors his scent or admires it too much, because
So it’s highly probable that the blue-eyed man might be playing at something here. Maybe teasing Dean. Or maybe goading him into a fight. They’ve had a number of fights already in the last few months of their marriage. Sometimes about the merits of porridge as a breakfast meal, other times about the nourishment value of sugar. And their fights always end in a rather steamy encounter with Dean’s senses being scent clogged more than once.
“NO! You think Bobby...  Mr. Singer would leave his entire Yard to me and go for a 3 hours stroll if I was ‘less than adequate’ at my job?”
. It doesn’t take too long for Cas to clumsily stroke himself and in the next moment the Alpha’s coming
stay away. Because I couldn’t stay away when I moved in next door and saw you in your garden for the first time. Because I couldn’t stay away when you tried to genuinely compliment my baking skills and listened to me ramble on and on about rock bands that you know nothing about. Because I couldn’t stay away when I saw you having your daily chats and supper with Stevie.”
But Dean still believes that his nightly duties as Bobby’s employee take priority over any ill-mannered but alluring Alpha and their apparent displeasure at Dean’s scent, which is why he is now standing outside the strange Alpha’s door. Lord Milton’s (as he called himself a few hours ago) luggage has already been brought upstairs along with the bathing oils and hot water, and all Dean needs to check for is the extra bedding in the bed-box. The Alpha would be bathing at the moment and Dean has his famous ability of agility, therefore, all he requires is 20 seconds to ensure that everything’s in order.
I should apologize to Dean. Tell him it was an accident. And he should stop shouting right in my face maybe.
“So what Cas,” Dean tries again, a shade gentler this time. “You’re blowing this out of proportion, really. It’s not like it was the first time or something... He gets like that sometimes, you know! It’s just the drinking, you don’t know him! ‘Tis irrelevant, really-” he stops abruptly seeing the sharp look he receives from his Alpha.
So, here I am, back in my four walled world, sitting in the quiet living room, away from all those.. loud noises and blaring lights and sparkly drinks and unknown hands... This is not to say that I am not grateful for her.
he doesn’t know the way to the nursery by heart! (Although Joshua has given him rather clear instructions about the directions. But Dean never claimed to have an excellent memory, did he?) Moreover, Dean’s hearing ability is also not
For the next few hours, Dean purposely steers clear from the Alpha brothers, far enough to not intrude on the brother’s bonding, or fight, or whatever it is. It’s not like he didn’t try to intrude, though. Of course he asked his Mate why this big brother’s such an ass to Cas, only to get blown off in Dean’s own old words (Dean, he’s ‘family’. Families fight with each other all the time. It’s ‘normal’ is what it is).
And so, it is Dean’s curiosity coupled with his sense of responsibility, which make him push the door open, step inside and close it behind him.
“But they said these woods-” says Dean, thoroughly confused of the beauty surrounding him which was in stark contrast to the villager’s cautionary tales.
“Babe, can you look at me please. Just hear me out, okay... Cas, I’m nowhere near this definition of some ideal human being, okay. I’m my own version of fucked up. I have screwed up my fair share in life, okay. God knows I have. And I’m in no way this so-called symbol of perfection that you seem to think I am, okay?”
Dean looks rather disturbed and even more confused than before. He’s no longer maintaining that two-shoulder distance from me that he previously was, after I told him to stop ordering me around. He’s standing much nearer now and is about to cup my face. No, not my face... Why does he have to be so tender and sweet when I’m trying to be angry here... I’m so grateful for my poker-face skills and especially at moments like these. Dean can’t break me again with his gentle words and sugary desserts. I am not going to let go of this clarity of thought that I finally have after so long. It’s a no-brainer, really.
Dean deliberately avoids talking about That Day a month ago. He doesn’t want to even imagine how his kid brother would react if Dean ever told him about the accidental choking to almost death thing. There’s no need to.
at those words. Well, Dean had thought to perhaps be understanding in some manner but apparently his stupidity just refuses to let go of him. The despair in his husband’s eyes just worsens somehow and in the next instant, Cas is hastily heading out of their bedroom, his drooped shoulders screaming of defeat.
I hear my name being called. Oh, that’s not what you call "calling", the person needs to calm down. He’s
Chapter Summarized: Cas goes to attend Meg’s birthday party where her drunk boyfriend touches him inappropriately in Meg’s absence. It’s implied that he gets in shock at the time and Meg intervenes immediately. Later she sends him home but stays to deal with and break up with the guy. He’s angry about the fact that in trying to ‘save’ him, she didn’t give him a chance to stand up for himself. He’s spiraling because of his loss of agency and control. He turns to self-harming, because of his twisted theory that the pain will “center” or “ground” him. All of a sudden he hears the doorbell and accidentally falls on broken glass as a result of which a few shards pierce his wrist. In the end, it turns out to be Dean at his door with another one of his pies.
“Well, I believe I should let you get back to your work now. I’ve taken so much of your time already, Joshua.”
When they collide with each other again this time, Dean gets treated in the exact same manner as he did before. With the same kind yet somehow stern smile. Apparently she still remembers his name. Apparently him being a Lord, even though by mating, doesn’t matter to her. And apparently she owns a peculiar parlor with soaps and candles and essential oils in one corner, teas and herbs in another corner, and weirdly old and rusty jewelery in some other corner just beside a bunch of crystal globes...
“Told you he’s shady. Break it off. Guy’s old. He’ll die soon and your mark will fade sooner. Must be a lying cheat, a crook.”
Wading through the crowd, he then moves to a relatively quieter part of the mart. Quiet but still sprightly, mind you. Past the fancy gowns and hats displayed outside the Dress Shops’ lane. Past the mightily colorful lane of Gift Booths decorated beautifully. Then past the Jewellery Stores shining brightly with ridiculously ornate necklaces, sapphire pendants, diamond brooches, gold hand-chains and... Collars? Good gracious, they still do that here! Well, it’s the North. Of course they still do that here. Dean wonders why Cas never got him one. Perhaps the rich don’t follow “tradition”. But those embellished collars don’t really look quite affordable for the poor. Perhaps it’s
“Try me, then. Gimme a chance to prove how much I love you, Cas. I’ll prove it. I’ll do anything to. Just let me be with you. Don’t make me leave, Cas... Please.”
I was leaning over the kitchen counter by myself, trying to decide on what to make for lunch, which I admittedly haven’t done for a long long time, when he came up from behind and... Is there a word for cuddling while standing? He’s doing that. Distracting.
An hour or so later, Dean wakes up to a warm tongue lapping at his mark. This is when he’s supposed to come to his senses and start panicking and kick this strange Alpha in the groin and run away, but all he does is lazily open his own eyes, stare into the most amazing pair of blues and smile.
Dean tries his best to pointedly ignore the wreckage, taking in deep breaths to calm himself down, intentionally avoiding venturing into
It’s not so peaceful right now, though. Why do people buy such monster cars that look like a boat and sound like a tractor? I was aware that it was Moving Day in Mr. Turner’s old house but, can my new neighbor be more discreet? Oh, well. I think I’ll need to greet the person and maybe smile. That is still the proper course of action for new neighbors, I believe. Okay. It’s easy. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in-
“Uh, this castle...” asks Dean, or rather tries to ask before he gets rudely interrupted by a screeching sound, barely human.
Dean looks away, feeling weak in the knees, and reaches his hands to help Cas out. He doesn’t accept the invitation though, still maintaining the no-touch policy and it’s just frustrating, alright! But Dean’s also not ready to accept his defeat just yet so he tries the last thing he can think of. He stares at his husband’s still hard cock for a moment too long, inadvertently gulping, and then looking straight into those blue eyes Dean opens his mouth, licking his bottom lip and wordlessly asking for
His Alpha must be a seasoned traveler to know so much of what’s out there! Must have roamed the continent at least thrice for the amount of knowledge he has. Dean’s awaiting with pleasure the day he dons the role of the Companion on these excursions. For his Alpha to hold his hand, rake his fingers through Dean’s hair, whisper in his ears about the cathedrals of yore, and lead him to paths untraversed. Not once had his Alpha gone more than a foot away from Dean during this journey, which was enough to assure him that he’s not the only one affected by his husband’s scent.
“You think there was some burglar? Sammy, he doesn’t own anything. The whole town knows that. Burglars even from the next town over would know that.”
It’s a rather bleak chapter and there’s a bit of a descriptive dive into Cas's mind about self-harm towards the end, so if you don’t wish to read that, please avoid the part in between ~ and ~. There’s also a summarized version at the end, in case you wish to avoid the whole thing.
Dean comes as soon as Cas’ finger encircles his rim and slips inside. He’s mostly unaware of his husband swallowing him down whole and savoring his taste as Dean goes cross-eyed from the sensation, his mouth going slack.
The first time he’d arrived here, he’d paid zero attention to his surroundings towards the end of their two day’s journey, what with him being scent-drunk and half-drowned in the crook of his new husband’s neck. But now that he’s properly up and about and no longer horny for his new Mate, he’s able to be a bit more observant of the world going him by. He sits glued to the carriage window and focuses on the endless stretch of absolutely nothing for miles. Just when he was about to question the old Beta about it, the carriage finally passes a cluster of small cottages, visibly in shambles. They were clearly abandoned from the looks of it.
Onto the next one. It’s simple. Retrace the steps. So the last thing I remember is.. The birthday, yes. Remembering isn’t really helping though. Still not sure if that really happened or my mind just decided to torment me by some convoluted nightmare. The hurt is quite real. No questions there. The mouth is too dry though. Should probably get out of bed and.. do something about it. Water, yes.
moves down the torso. Dean is anticipating another round of drawn-out teasing session but when has he ever been right about his husband’s intentions. In the next heartbeat, Cas’ warm mouth closes around his cock and Dean loses the ability to make sounds or think for that matter. He leaves a harsh breath he didn’t know he was holding as the Alpha starts bobbing his head up and down. Although there’s no one pinning his hands anymore, his wrists no longer tied by smooth silk, Dean still doesn’t attempt to free himself and instead keeps them how the Alpha left them, lying over his head, utterly lost in the sensation of the wet heat of his husband's talented mouth.
But of course Dean has always been an impatient muck. Never the one to listen. Not one to bide his time. This is why he never succumbed to Sammy’s pressure about meditating too, because that requires being composed, calm, collected even –
“Cassie, I’m telling you, that woman removed all traces of my DNA from that house as soon as I left.”
By midday when they finally reach the castle, Dean starts feeling a little uneasy. He simply chalks it up to not eating much in the morning breakfast, too excited for their visit to the village. Joshua stops the carriage finally and Cas helps him step out. Dean’s nose starts feeling a little funny too then. This is when he realizes it’s because he’s smelling a foreign scent at the moment. Another person.
It still amazes him, the vast differences between the well-loved Gardens and the Castle itself, with no one there to actually care for it perhaps... Not anymore, he decides.
“I wasn’t actually,” replies Sam, “We received Lord Milton’s invitation a few weeks ago and his carriage arrived last week so-”
. Sammy can call the man a ‘sorry excuse’ for a father all he wants, but Dean knows that John Winchester is a fighter. Drunk or not, he cannot be defeated just like that. Obviously he’s alive and well. Most certainly enjoying the southern sun somewhere. There’s no person on this earth capable enough to take down John Winchester.
Dean personally believes that this godforsaken pile of grey rocks is definitely haunted by all the wealthy blood-sucking bastards that have ever lived here! But he’s not brave enough to divulge his grouchy feelings to his new husband, not yet at least. And so, he ignores the prickly sensation and continues with the sorting. He bends forward on his knees, struggles a bit to reach the back-end of the bottom shelf and out comes a monster-sized hardbound book, brown leather cover, tied with a string leaf, looking
, peaceful even to someone who doesn’t know Cas, but Dean does. Dean knows how those shoulders look when relaxed, how those long fingers splay over the furniture, how those muscles feel under his fingers when they’re loose and fluid. Calm... But this Cas is
Well, waking up is disorienting which is unsurprising, really. But the throbbing seems new. Ah, here we go again. Figuring out whether it’s real. Step 1: Observe the surroundings. Correct room, good. Step 2: Make sure you’re clothed. Shirt and sweatpants, good. They’re clean.
This was my first time writing Destiel. I appreciate any kind of feedback. If you’ve enjoyed reading it then please let me know your thoughts or head over to my tumblr at
is. Dean’s been living here for over three months now and he’s nowhere close to leaving. And this stability is not good for me. Never has been. There’s plenty of evidence to disprove the benefits of a good ol’ fashioned routine and a stable life. Why is he still here..? Haven’t I proven to him yet that I won’t slit my throat the moment he walks out of my life... That I’m perfectly fine on my own... That I’m normal or may be trying to be... That I’m not some damsel for him to save and feel good about himself...
“Heh... Uh, don’t worry. We’ll get around to other things, which are, of course, important to discuss, beforehand, and we will-”
I haven’t met many men who go around from house to house and offer desserts. He claims that he made them. I am inclined to believe him seeing the flour in his sandy brown hair.
I had hoped for peace.. at least in death. To be away from constant disagreements, fights, failures, responsibilities, expectations, friends, family.. People. Everything. But the Lord works in mysterious ways. And so he wishes for me to relive my joyful childhood even on this white plane of existence. Which is why,
to be this bow-tie wearing church-going brainless elf. If you didn’t suck up to her so hard, you’d be a normal dude, li’l bro.”
Truth be told, I am not really sure about the particulars of this kitchen anymore. Many things have changed. Different location for old things. New shiny baking equipment or whatever they’re called. A clean countertop. Huh. It’s going to take longer, decision making of any kind. And I am rather starving actually.
” he whispers, before leaving the Dining Room. Blue eyes somber now, the previous anger replaced by something else entirely.
Not that Sammy ever complains. He’s just turned 17 and eats like a starving horse, so even if Dean serves him raw leaves, Sammy will happily munch on them. Dean shudders to think that Sammy would actually prefer the green abomination instead. In his attempts to feed Sammy, Dean has never shied away from taking ‘favors’ from the town Alphas. And if he got to enjoy his time while accepting said favors, then it should not be of much concern to anybody.
“Mm.. my sister, my sister. Mm..Meg..Megan, my sister, find her, can’t find her,” she says, falling into a frenzied state, her eyes desperate.
“I fucking started walking dogs for you, Cas! I thought maybe because of them you’ll go out with me because you know, people like other people who like dogs, you know... Am I making any sense? I don’t even
The times when John would come home drunk and unable to stand properly, which was most times, and would order the boys around especially Dean for obvious reasons, the boy would always listen. He would slightly tilt his head so as to barely bare his throat to appease his father. Just like Lady Hanscum taught him after he received his first official beat-down session as a newly presented Omega when he disobeyed (read: delayed in obeying) a direct order.
before leaping first. Dean slowly opens his mouth, ready to be fed the horrible plant juice, and Cas looks on surprised... Dean’s never been the one to be readily pampered. In fact it’s the one thing they regularly fight about. About Cas’ never-ending need to coddle Dean and Dean’s relentless wish to be absolutely neglectful. And to literally be spoon-fed should’ve been out of question in Dean’s books but guess what, screw the books for today. Dean
Dean was billowing in this tragedy of senility when he heard the distinct clangor of a Hackney Carriage. He promptly wipes his hands after filling the pail of water, rearranges his apron and goes outside to greet the visitor. He hopes it’s not another one of Mrs. Butters’ errand-boy asking for carriage room while the visitors stay over at the Woodhouse Inn. Lending such favors is not good for business and kindness can only take one so far. He’s been reprimanded enough times by Bobby for it. Dean needs to unequivocally communicate his displeasure about the repeated requests.
Or maybe it’s just my mind reliving those nightmarish memories of what usually followed after Gabe decided to sip his tea from the saucer.. slowly.. and quite noisily.. in front of Mother.
Dean can handle this version of Sammy, one who’s always rolling his eyes at Dean for his weird antics, but he can’t deal with the smart Sam at the moment. Somewhere deep deep down he knows the kid’s words make sense. He knows his Mate’s and his own life are worlds apart. Realistically speaking, they
You know Alphas don’t take their mate’s bite. Who knows what he really is? You cannot simply kick him and run down the street if one day he asks you to don a veil, when you’re
“Stephen Frederick Bradbury, I implore you to see reason and accompany your Queen back to our chambers right at this moment.”
at his face properly and right away appears displeased! Maybe he wanted his ‘Little Lord’ to wed the famed Lady of Prentiss Island or something...
A couple of weeks after The Incident the two spent a whole day within the confines of their room. Next morning when Dean finally came downstairs to prepare breakfast, he bumped into a rather frantic Beta. Joshua’s weathered eyes quickly roved over Dean’s entire torso, looking for something, perhaps another injury, and then minutely relaxing on not finding one.
For the next few weeks Dean tries striking a conversation with both the Alpha and the Beta... he fails. He tries asking questions and his attempts get shut down by weak dodging techniques... so he fails again. He tries negotiating peace between the two only to get rather vehemently shut down by Joshua’s righteous fury on his behalf... of course he fails.
It's an unspoken truth that each and every Omega knows in the deepest crevice of their hearts. They are
The Alpha halts momentarily, looks up from Dean’s bite where he’s been mouthing all along, and asks, “What’d'ye say?”
“So, you mean to say that Cas doesn’t like to travel?” Dean asks, still unsure. It’s like he doesn’t even know the man he’s spent his every breathing second with, in the past couple of months.
So a young Dean slowly but surely learned the ways, the nuances and the tricks of Omega Obedience. But he would still lay awake all night long, wondering about the Voice and what it was that made the difference and soon he came to a realization. It has never been about respect or obedience for the Alphas. It’s about power. About control. About satisfying their deep-seated need for ruling the roost. About exerting their inviolable authority over the weak and vulnerable.
“Milord...?” says the gardener, sounding more apprehensive than excited at Dean’s sudden arrival. He looks behind Dean, searching for his Little Lord perhaps, and seems even more worried than before when he finds no one.
But deep down he knows that the moments closest to his heart are when Cas is simply lying beside him, tracing his freckles, worshiping them. Or gently rubbing the marks he left on Dean’s wrists not too long ago, soothing them. Or just staring into Dean’s eyes with his own too-blue ones, deep and intense, with so much...
I need him to leave already. There are things that I need to look into. And Dean’s unrelenting presence doesn’t bode well for my future plans. There’s still so much left to do. I’m yet to settle my remaining funds in Meg’s name. This legal stuff takes time. Who knew! There’s a considerable amount of money and other assets left in my charge after Mother and Gabe and the Shop. I need to consider so many things before taking the final step. And
In the past couple of weeks, Dean’s mostly done with the Great Hall and the Drawing Room, and as per his premade-schedule he’s supposed to start with the Music Room today. But he decides for a change of setting and moves on to the South Wing, which is arguably the grottiest and the grimiest part of the Castle. He settles for sussing out the Keep first, which is a rather stuffy place owing to the absolute lack of windows, then clearing out the unnecessary gubbins, and later reorganizing the dilapidated book-cabinets in there. There’s
, I need. People.. I can’t. Especially not Meg. Oh, the trembling has started again. This is not good. May be if I don’t answer the door, the person will assume that I’m asleep and go away. I
“Dean, he’s not mi-... The sheriff said it’s unlikely he went away on his own volition this time. There was a clear struggle... But they still haven’t found the body yet.”
. My initial guess regarding the reason for his steady presence was what he saw on my forearms and thighs, of course. And so it was fairly evident that he considers me a ‘basket case’ who will slit his own throat given half a chance.
He’s smiling weirdly again. Is that.. a blush? Oh, he's uncomfortable. So, standard behavior for someone trying to engage me in conversation. I think his people skills are even rustier than mine.
He follows the tiny noise coming from the fireplace and there sits Cas, on the now broken sofa. The sofa they made love on not two days ago. With his back to Dean, facing the fire slowly dying down. The hissing and the crackling the only sounds Dean can hear apart from his own heart beating like a bass drum.
“She’s not you, Gabe. She neither had the mental capacity nor the patience to orchestrate such an elaborate scheme. Can you put on your seat-belt now, please? We are still at least 3 hours away.”
This is the reason I highly appreciate my time with Steve right now. He’s quiet. It’s peaceful, sitting here with him. Perhaps being grumpy together. Perhaps silently being envious of the ease with which Mr. Winchester leads his life. Steve and I have an understanding. He does not require my constant affection.. He takes the occasional pat and of course inhales the chicken. No words needed.
The days have started to blend into each other as well, but not in a disagreeable way though. It’s not that bad waking up to light kisses that soon turn into heavy make-out sessions that then turn into shower-sex. There are days when his hands roam everywhere on my body at once and then there are other days when it’s just our tongues... at times playful, other times fighting for dominance, but mostly cherishing. What’s staggering for me is the normalcy of it all.
And as long as the Alphas thought that they were still the center of the universe, still invincible, still revered and still feared, at least on the surface that is, then all was well with the world. They would sleep peacefully with a dazed smile. They would happily snore away and be content with the assurance of their Omega’s supposed submission.
Sometimes it’s just a quick peck at the porch, and other times it goes on forever. In a slow and languid pace. Almost lazy. Exploring, his tongue. And his hands, of course. Like he has all the time in the world. Something so gentle and light at once and at the same time so intense.
“Then I think we should rather hurry, don’t you?” answers Dean with his most insolent little smirk. Though Joshua doesn’t seem so amused, he nevertheless opens the carriage door for Dean, hesitating still, constantly eyeing behind at the front gates for any sign of his Little Lord. He takes a long and harsh breath, and finally dons his coachman hat.
This is how he learned to rebel in moderation and disobey in secret. He learned to respectfully object with his head bowed down and stowed away his transgressions in front of his father.
work. A sensible person (like Sammy) would always advise against it. Dean distinctly remembers even Cas telling him to all but ‘go away’ the first time they met. But he just couldn’t.
“Oh, no! On the contrary milord, he likes to keep to himself, likes those grey walls, the inside. It’s his
“It was some beggar, a little kid,” says Dean. When Cas doesn’t say anything but just looks on, Dean continues, “That’s how people beg, Mr. Rich Lord-Man. They cling to you, hold on to you, clutch your shoulders, they
“You don’t hit me. Fine! Maybe you’re a decent person or something. But you don’t fuck me… What’s that about? Is this some weird caretaking fetish? Or some white knight syndrome? That you’ll cook for me, make me take my meds, kiss me randomly, but then you’ll refuse to fuck me. You know what I think!? I think that you found a stranger bleeding on the floor and you decided that this poor excuse of a human needs saving. And you thought that you finally got your shot at playing a hero and ‘fixing’ someone. That’s what this is about, isn’t it?”
Dean is able to scent a bit more clearly now, with no grease and sweat to obstruct his senses anymore. The rage is palpable in the scent but Dean doesn’t care about that. The cloak slips from his fingers and Dean takes a single step towards the Alpha.
Dean has no such inhibitions regarding his appearance and firmly believes that any Alpha would eagerly bend their knee for him, because Alphas are dense like that, all brawn and no brains. But there have been absolutely no Alphas, lord or not, who piqued
But Dean doesn’t really believe that there’s another Castle Servant here, because for one, he hasn’t seen a living soul in this place other than Joshua and his husband, of course, and secondly, if there were any Castle Servants then the place wouldn’t have been so...
. Which is hilarious, really. I should be able to recall that memory, at least. How could I forget when those gentle lips touched mine for the first time... Oh, I do remember the feeling certainly. Just not the time, place and other irrelevant specificities. It’s a funny thing, the mind. Sometimes, I will feel him smile against my lips on those rare occasions when I let slip a moan. It’s just everything at once. Sometimes, too much... other times, not enough.
And Dean seriously nods along like a sincere toddler, which is an oxymoron in itself. Predictably so after walking for a few minutes it doesn’t really come as a surprise when they turn to a particularly crowded street, then get shoved in by the throng of people and end up being separated in the great hustle and bustle of the mart.
Over the backdrop of lush wooded hills, is the imposing structure of his Alpha’s Castle, its turrets silhouetted against the gray skies overhead. Dean peeks uncertainly over the great many windows that are too large to take in, the hulking walls of grey that perfectly compliment the clouds above enveloped by mist, and the air of magnificence that’s too hard to miss. But what especially floor him are the gardens below, the motley of large trees and flower shrubs and fragrant bushes and shapely hedges. Flanked by a tunnel of trees is the well-loved and vast expanse of absolute opulence!
The day Bobby saw Dean’s bleeding nose for the first time, he packed their things himself and took the boys with him to the Singer’s Yard and finally away from John. As Sammy got his unbridled access to dusty old books and Dean got to work in Bobby’s Carriage House, life became fairly normal for the boys. Soon after, the town became aware of the boys moving to their Uncle Bobby’s home, 'drunk ol’ John' became the new town gossip, which then ended up turning him into an even bigger alcoholic and ruining his own coach-house business – which was nothing but a glorified shed, for no more than two horses at once, to begin with. Dean has tried to make him see reason several times but to no avail.
He doesn’t say a word when Cas gently leads him out of the Kitchens and makes him sit at one of the chairs beside the dinner table. Cas kneels in front of him, both of Dean’s hands in a tight but warm clasp still. Those eyes are so impossibly blue that Dean almost forgets what he was going to propose to his Alpha.
Dean fumbles a little, almost losing his balance when it becomes too much for his thighs, and in the next instant Cas’ hands are there, hovering at Dean’s sides, ready to hold, support, look after. This time Dean doesn’t wait and makes the decision for Cas, covering Cas’ hands in his own and putting them on his hips, hoping against hope that they would stay there. That he would stay. Dean notices that they slightly shiver but remain as is.
area of thought, miserably trying to evade the funny feeling that sight evokes in him. He forces himself to turn away and continues searching for his Alpha. After a few minutes of this, it’s a barely discernible sound of crackling flames from the Drawing Room perhaps that eventually alerts him.
“Yeah, but only a bit. Bobby says I still have a few years of growth left, just you see old man!” goads Dean. “You reckon you'll still find me as fetching after I gain a couple of inches on you, little Alpha?”
When Meg and I enter the house, it’s to Gabe being slapped in front of everyone. Mother has never done that before. Yes, she doesn’t like him very much.. she makes it rather obvious by continuously pointing out how much of a disappointment he is to her at her frequent gatherings. Yes, she never holds back from verbally berating or disciplining us in the presence of an audience but Mother has never raised her hand at either of us in front of other people. Not until today.
And so he chooses the southern wing of the castle this time, looking to immerse himself in work. Still feeling a little ditsy and out of sorts even after having a light meal. It’s not usually like this, he thinks. He can easily go without for long hours and not feel this way. Perhaps it’s the changing northern air, he guesses. Dean wipes his surprisingly sweaty forehead and focuses on the task at hand. Sometimes it does get a bit stuffy in here, alright! Must be because there’s no large window or air shafts in this part of the wing unlike the rest of the castle. Not something to worry about. And surely it’s got nothing to do with the sudden cramps he’s beginning to feel just now.
.. merely a witness to the world passing by. But the hurt.. It grounds me, the hurt. Stops my mind from drifting to another plane of existence. It centers me, in a manner.
Omegas – the pliant homemakers and dutiful child-bearers, the naturally obedient and demure beings – have always listened to and followed the Voice. Sometimes it’s because of the fear of Alpha Strength, sometimes because of the fear of being an ostracized outcast, and sometimes it’s for the love of their Alphas. But the fact of the matter is that it’s got nothing to do with biology or the gods and their supposed obsession with a knot.
“Yea, I’ll help you kid, relax! Take a breath first, you hear me? Yes, good,” he says slowly, trying his best to calm the lost girl. “Now tell me, when’d you see your sister last? Where’d she go?”
Mr. Winchester has been my neighbor for a little over a month now and I have tried diligently to accept his lifestyle. But it’s just so..
“Cas, I thought we were.. Weren’t we.. I know we never expressly talked about it or anything but I thought you.. And after the incident, it just...”
With trembling hands, I open the cabinet and clumsily try to get the required stuff out. My fingers are shaking though, so a few bottles drop outside and there’s a loud smash. Oh, was that made of glass? Why do I have it in here? Damn it. This is going to take a bit of a time for the cleanup. I can focus on that later though. I keep the stuff on the counter and… look at myself again.. breathe in, breathe out. I blink slowly. This should help. It usually does. It’s okay.
This is still troubling though. The constant presence. The daily routine, of sorts. The unrelenting attentiveness. The tenderness. The intimacy.
people at least. Mother, on the other hand, never seemed to express her dislike towards her pastel pantsuits. But I have to admit, this goth look suits her rather well, provided her objective still remains to scare the living daylights out of anyone she encounters.
It’s nearly an hour later as they’re both laying on the bed facing each other, utterly blissed out, with the Omega ridiculously gross and sticky but very much smelling like Cas, that Dean catches onto the reason why Cas felt the need to do
Dean doesn’t honestly believe the rather rehearsed response of the gardener, but he’s somewhat satisfied with the plethora of knowledge he’s just gained and more so perturbed with the sheer number of people who have either died or gone missing or are no longer living in this dreary place. He takes one final look at the imposing grey structure behind him over the backdrop of disquieting hills, ever shrouded in the northern mist, and decides that fighting the evil ghosts of his husband’s dead family couldn’t be that difficult.
No one (read: Alpha) ever cared about the inconsistencies in the stories of subservience as long as they were being obeyed. No one (read: Omega) ever corrected the old omegas’ tales. The Alphas stay contented with the assurance that they’re invincible and the Omegas do as they please, but of course in secret.
“Sammy, he even agreed for a formal Handfasting day after tomorrow. Can we stop fighting and just have a nice meal. Meet him tonight and see for yourself. Please?”
I believe there’s no point to disagreeing. Meg would disagree though. She’s insistent on finding me a suitable date. She’s even asked me on a threesome with her and her current-boyfriend. I told her I believe it’s rather a hassle – so complicated, what goes where, what are the rules of conduct. She just laughs and says there are none. I cannot say yes to that! It will be chaos for Pete's sake!
I missed my deadline. Again. Saying that there were too many things going on would be a lie. There was nothing going on. Except that constant ringing in my head, of course. But I’ve gotten used to the ringing. I should’ve been better. But I sat there and did nothing about it.
Well, I seem alive enough to stand upright, so it’s okay I believe. All that’s blurry is just who shouted what and who bandaged and.. Who cleaned the whole freaking house and Why and How do I feel so clean? I don’t remember being this productive recently. And Meg doesn’t give me such thorough baths while I am lying unconscious. And she certainly does
When he finally remembers enough of his manners he introduces Sammy to Joshua and Cas, not that they needed any introduction in the first place, Dean’s already told everyone about everyone of course. After the unnecessary civilities though, Dean is certain he imagines a sudden hostility in his oh so gentle brother’s hazel eyes when the kid looks at Cas, almost an accusing glare and an abrupt spike in the air for some reason.
Well, they smell wonderful. Can’t hurt to eat. I can ask him to leave later. There’s so much space here anyway. And it’s not like spending a few hours in your neighbor’s place is a cause for scandal. Not for Dean at least. And he says,
“..not going to the hosp.. Are you for fucking real, lady!? He needs help.. Forget it. Just step aside and let us go.”
Dean clocks a couple of shabby shacks beside a bunch of tiny stalls and a few people milling around, hardly a ‘swarm’ of people and assumes that this is the ‘great village mart’ he was so eager to visit.
He’s a kind man. He seems to have taken it upon himself, the role of my caretaker of sorts. Or maybe he just thinks that I am a time-bomb ticking and he needs to be here even the next day to make sure I don’t repeat the episode. I need to assure him and let him go his way.

“You didn’t inform me you were planning on visiting?” asks Cas, the words exactly the same as Dean had said a month ago to his kid brother, but are much more subdued and lifeless, almost accusatory, when spoken by Cas now.
“You know this could be a trick.. Naomi could be alive and well on the other line, making her minions call us, and then we fall right into her trap and then she’ll sell both our kidneys.”
