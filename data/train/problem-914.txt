‘Don’t.’ Sherlock sounded almost back to normal, sitting up in his chair and steepling his hands under his chin. ‘We’ll do it.’
And suddenly they’d collided, John pushing himself off his chair and into Sherlock’s lap, knee between his legs, hands pulling on his shoulders, his shirt, lips pressed against his, teeth biting, tongue stroking.
John sits there for twenty-four hours, waiting, and he would have waited for another twenty-four, and then twenty-four after that, but the phone rings and he gets up, walks to the phone and answers.
ago) and taken back to the palace, shown to the big dining hall. It was full of nobles; several tried to congratulate Sherlock but he just waved them off because now all he wanted was to find John, that was all, nothing else mattered.
The Eye massacre had been the single most horrifying terrorist attack on the Holmes Kingdom ever. It had been on New Year’s Eve, which meant London was more packed than usual, just as the countdown ended. John had been watching from home with Mike and Molly; one second, they’d been counting down and the next there was a huge bang that John actually heard from outside as well as on the TV and the screen went static.
‘It’s Siger,’ a voice came back, and John frowned. He had no idea why Sherlock’s dad would be at his door in the middle of the night, but opened up the door further. ‘Um. Hi?’
turn your phone off. Sherlock rolled his eyes at him, because Mycroft had to be stupid if he thought he was going anywhere near drugs or relapses or bad things that night. Firstly, he knew Mycroft would hunt him down. Secondly, he was not going through rehab again. Thirdly, Irene wouldn’t let him anywhere near drugs, and finally, he generally just wasn’t stupid. Drugs = bad. Clean = good.
And now Sherlock thought about it John probably was cheating on him. Who would want monogamy with someone like Sherlock? Sherlock was fucked-up, a freak, a sociopath. He couldn't blame John, not at all.
‘Ngng, Sherlock…’ John groaned as Sherlock licked around the head, still looking up at John with those huge eyes, the same colour as the ocean, blinking innocently. ‘Want to come, John?’
Sherlock rolled his eyes at John, who was clearly trying very hard not to laugh as he crouched next to his daughter. ‘Charlie, darling, what did you want to tell Daddy?’
Pounding into him ruthlessly, still clothed, Sherlock’s nails scraping uselessly against the silky material of James’ Westwood suit and John was banished from his mind, what James did was banished from his mind, how James had got into his fucking bedroom was banished from his mind.
Sherlock scowled before snatching the wine back, finishing off the bottle and then standing up, swaying slightly. ‘It may be shit, but it’s strong.’ He admitted. ‘We’ve shared three bottles and already I feel…’
John nodded, smiling as Jenny recounted some story from the night before. He’d been so glad when she’d found people to hang around with at the resort; it made him feel less guilty about constantly asking to come back. Thank God all three of them loved it there, because John looked forward to it all year around.
He would never admit it to anyone, but Sherlock loved his grandmother more than almost anybody else on the planet.
Sherlock smiled. ‘I shall have to help you with that, later, though my knowledge is limited. I tend to zone out when people discuss my family.’
‘Now I’m curious.’ John said, leaning forwards and smiling. But Sherlock didn’t smile back; the sadness was back, the sadness that John saw in the pixels on his TV, the sadness which was a hundred times more acute in real life. ‘I’m sorry,’ John backtracked. ‘I didn’t mean-‘
Talia cooed and Xander stuck his fist in his mouth in a thoughtful way. What intelligent infants, Sherlock thought fondly. ‘I understand why he could be frustrated but he’s downright mean. It isn’t my fault.’
Molly had blushed. ‘You know why. It’s Prince Sherlock. God, everyone adores him. He was voted best looking teenager in the world last month.’
Jim smiled and said very slowly, ‘the first reason was because, after I was given the codes to the British Security System, I used them to piece together a team of assassins and bomb experts and then blow up the London Eye.’
John stomped a bit to make it clear that he was there, climbing the structure and then sitting next to Sherlock. He noticed the younger boy’s arms were rolled up and caught a glimpse of the bloody mass of scars that were now Sherlock’s left arm; he closed his eyes and looked away (
The man nodded, clutching his cheek. ‘I suppose I deserved that. You know, that shade of blue suits you.’
‘What the hell is wrong with you at the moment, John?’ Sherlock shouted. He had enough of John. He had a right to be angry about not being able to go public with Sherlock but seriously. Every time John walked into the room, everyone was instantly pissed off.
All he wanted, all he would ever want, was John, and James Moriarty may have ruined that for him forever.
‘Mais ma loyauté est avec la France, John Watson, et tu.’ - But my loyalty is with France, John Watson, and you.
It didn’t matter, John reassured himself. As long as he and Sherlock were together, everything would be fine.
‘With a woman,’ Morag interrupted. ‘Freya Lucas. She was studying medicine. They broke it off when Freya moved to South Africa, though they stayed in touch until your mother’s death. Can you imagine what would have happened if the newspapers caught wind of that?’
Mike read it out loud. ‘People are idiots, you sometimes are too, but thankfully, those moments are few. The idiots invented this thing called the Prom, and if you refuse what I say next I’ll be glum.’ Mike winced and pinched the skin between his eyes. ‘Come to this laughable excursion with me, and we’ll be as happy as maggots in faeces.’
They would throw him out, soon. Everyone had heard how awful he was. They’d heard the rumours about the Eye massacre. There was no way that they would give him a chance. No one ever did-
‘Thought I’d what?’ John said, still looking incredibly pissed-off. ‘Gone home? If you weren’t so busy almost fucking that bitch, you’d remember I fucking lived here-
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something but was immediately interrupted by a voice from behind him. ’Well, well, well. It looks like Sherlock’s made a new
John smiled, and all Sherlock could see were his eyes but that didn't matter, because John's eyes were beautiful and Sherlock would happily live his entire life looking into them. 'That's exactly what I wanted you to say,' he whispered, and then their lips were touching again and they were kissing on the roof, and it was reckless and idiotic but that was what Sherlock specialised in and John had forgiven him for something unforgiveable; John, perfect, stupid, brilliant John was kissing him, John, perfect, stupid, brilliant John was here, with him, right then, and Sherlock felt anchored to the Earth again, no longer floating among the stars that shone above them, because he had John and John had him and as long as they were together he was utterly, completely content.
The soldiers remained silent. Sholto seemed to calm down slightly and said in a slightly more level voice, ‘fortunately for you miserable worms, you
John sat down next to the bed. ‘Well you’ll be seeing plenty of him.’ And then, shyly, ‘We were hoping you’d be godmother.’
That jolt of electricity, that same feeling that Sherlock had almost forgotten, sparking through his body as he kissed John Watson, and a feeling of peace and love and happiness and comfort flooded his brain, shutting everything down until all Sherlock could see and feel and want was John, just John, nobody but John, and he kissed him, on the roof, as the stars shone above and the lights burned below, and Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if this was reality or just a perfect, perfect dream, because he had John in his arms and the stars above him and the lights of London shining below and if there had ever been a moment where Sherlock felt completely and utterly happy it was
Probably because of the nice weather, it was busier than it had been before. Students were browsing, a couple of teachers sat in the window eating pieces of amazing looking cake, there was even a curly, black dog sitting under a table occupied by a pretty girl reading Poe. John absent-mindedly bent down to stroke it, looking around and inhaling deeply (the smell was just as mouth-watering)-
He pushed open the door to his bedroom and smiled at his boyfriend, who was sitting in the red chair. ‘Hi, John,’ he said, and kissed the top of his boyfriend’s head and grabbed his hand. ‘Have you been waiting long?’
John looked down quickly, wondering what he had missed. He was usually perfect for role-call, and racked his brains for what he had left behind or done wrong. Freshly polished boots, check; neat, clean uniform, check; rifle and knife, check-
They all gasped, completely synchronised; Sherlock would have laughed if he didn’t feel so awful. He hated this; every time he went into public people treated him like this, like he was a lion in a cage, gawped at, overreacting. He was just a boy, nothing more. Just a boy. An exceptionally intelligent boy, yes, but still just a human being like everyone else.
‘Yeah, but in the family only you and Charlie are right-handed!’ Christopher protested. ‘That’s only forty percent!’
‘Who needs exams when you’re going to be a dominatrix?’ Irene teased. ‘Revising is boring, Sherlock. Come over on Saturday. I can teach you a thing or two-‘
And now here they were again, ready to see the royal family without the man who had led them for forty-seven years. They were ready to see a widowed Queen, fatherless children (it occurred to John that both Sherlock and Mycroft were now orphans and his heart broke a little more) and a nineteen year old boy who was now the most powerful person in the world.
John nodded his thanks at the other soldier. He was popular in the barracks, with the exception of Becca, though most of the soldiers disliked Sholto's clear favouritism of him. Mostly he stuck close to Hunter, Tigger Lucas, Isaac and Smith Spencer, because they were the youngest in the barracks and in the squadron and they gave him the least stick about Sholto, and John had formed quite close bonds with all four of them during his time in the Desert.
‘Oh,’ Sherlock mimicked, ‘look at me. I’m Mycroft Holmes aka Supreme Overlord of the United Kingdom. I start wars and prevent assassinations and keep the economy from taking a nosedive but no one knows that I go home and eat cake in the shed because my boyfriend doesn't like me cheating on my diet and spend my christmas’ trying to stop my Mummy from putting potatoes on my laptop.’
John smiled and was about to say something witty back when there was a sudden cheer and catcalls. ‘What the-‘ Irene said, before breaking off with a small, ‘Oh.’
‘I solemnly promise to do so.’ Sherlock said clearly, though he could hardly hear what he was saying, and at that moment none of it mattered in the slightest to him because in the face of John being here, John being back, John being there nothing else mattered-
Lila shifted slightly, looking slightly pained, and Sherlock backed away looking alarmed. ‘I’m going to- go check on Rosie, she’s been a while. Yes. Call me if you need me.’ And, with a sweep of the coat and a shake of the curls he was gone.
‘You’re going,’ Violet said. It wasn’t a command, more of a statement, but the tears welling in Sherlock’s eyes finally leaked over and he jumped up. ‘I
Sherlock must have looked sad because John came up behind him and wrapped his arms around him. ‘Hey, Sher, it’s ok. What’s up?’
John stopped in front of them, deeply out of breath. His hair was mussed up, he’d clearly been wearing his clothes for more than twenty-four hours, and his eyes were red and swollen (
He reached the main building just as the main doors opened and Sherlock sauntered out, chatting happily chatting away with a Chinese boy. ‘John!’ He said when he saw the older boy, saying cheerfully, ‘Did you miss me too much-‘
‘Whatever I say about him,’ Sherlock replied seriously, ‘He was always there for me. As I hope you will always be there for…for the infant.’
The glare was instantly replaced by a sunny grin, exactly like John's, and Mr Watson offered Sherlock his hand. ‘You’re not a twat. I’m surprised. Henry Watson. You can call me Henry.’
It’s the choke-hold of betrayal, the twisted arm of mercilessness, the head-lock of disbelief. He’s being squeezed by something that isn’t really there, squeezed into submission because John is Moriarty, his
Sherlock turned and began walking towards John, his shoulders slumped. John could hardly believe what was happening; he had caused the heir to the throne to be disowned. This was the worst thing he had ever done by a titanic margin-
Molly turned to him and smiled evilly (she had been spending far too much time with Jim). ‘Come to mine Friday,’ she whispered, ‘and you’ll see.’
Maybe it was because they were all so much older, John thought. Irene, Janine and Mike were all sixteen and it was John’s sixteenth in less than a week. Molly and Sherlock had both only just turned fifteen, which was evident in Molly (who, upon hearing they were going to spend the last night before John, Janine and Irene went home drinking illegally on the roof had shaken her head adamantly and had an early night) but less so in Sherlock, who’d shrugged and followed them to the cafeteria before advising Irene when it was best to steal the wine.
‘Ready, Sherlock?’ Mycroft said quietly, the joking tone gone from his voice. Sherlock flashed him a quick, guarded smile. ‘Aren’t I always? Into battle, brother.’
Jacob grabbed a hunk of Christopher’s hair and pulled; the older boy retaliated by picking up his brother and tickling his ribs. Charlie held the baby still and Sherlock wormed his way out, staggering over to John. ‘They’re getting far too big for me to do that,’ he puffed.
When he leaves just after dawn, pulling his coat up around his neck to protect himself from the harsh wind, the world is red and blue and satisfying, again.
Jim sighed. ‘No, Sherlock, you’re not getting it. It could be really romantic. Like, you could give him a head and say,’ he put on a girlishly high voice, ‘oh Johnny, my head says that I shouldn't like you because I’m an incredibly intelligent and unordinary human being and you’re a stupid little pet…’
‘John.’ Sherlock breathed, squinting across the roof. A slight movement caught his eye and his eyes instantly started watering as he saw John, a dark figure just a few feet away from him, perched at the edge of the roof of Buckingham palace, and he felt his heart start beating again, noticeable once more in his chest, and he had missed John more than anything, anything,
John,’ Sherlock said quietly as he whipped out his magnifying glass and took a closer look at the victim’s neck, ‘is not my side-kick.’
‘Sherlock,’ Mycroft began, looking uncomfortable, ‘I see no way in which he would not agree to come with you. From what I can tell John Watson values you above anyone else in his life. True, I cannot see if he finds you sexually appealing-‘
isn’t.’ Rosie looked sceptical. ‘His thing with Lady Smallwood is revolting, not love.’ He gently brushed a curl away from her little face, staring into those big blue eyes. ‘Should I?’
‘Positive,’ Greg said. ‘I asked him about it, he told me to shut up and never tell anybody. But he definitely said that his mother killed himself. I asked Mycroft, but he just looked all shifty and said Sherlock had been affected worst by his mother’s death, and he might have been seeing things, or I might have misheard, but I promise you I didn't, and the way Sherlock said it...it was as if he was finally admitting something he'd kept secret for years.’
Suddenly, the little boy in all those memories of skiing holidays and Christmases and birthdays was replaced by a faceless baby who had replaced
But what John remember most clearly from that night was the image of Sherlock’s eyes as he stared at Morag, vengeful, cornered, black and so, so angry. It stayed with him especially because, when John thought about it, he realised that as Sherlock had shouted at Morag, it had seemed as if he was talking to someone else entirely.
Sherlock puffed up with pride and turned to look in the mirror. He had (finally) stopped growing about a year previously and had been left dead on six foot, one inch smaller than Mycroft, one inch taller than his father. Four inches taller than James, ten inches taller than Irene, six inches taller than John-
‘Scratches around the charger, he plugged it in several times whilst drunk. That was a bit of a guess, if I’m honest. Good one, though.’
He recognises the handwriting of the address, and opens it carelessly: he’s expecting the usual drivel from Mycroft, the
that their father would return but it had pleased their mother, and John had to admit that John Watson sounded better than John Kendrick.
John and Sherlock were well on their way into round two when the door was flung open and Harry burst in, her eyes tightly shut.
‘Enough, Irene,’ Sherlock snapped. ‘We have bigger problems.’ He sighed and crossed his ankles, hands steepled by his chin. He had adopted his thinking position (lying on bed, ankles crossed, hands steepled) as soon as he had reached his room after school; when Irene had knocked on the door and charmed her way past Houghton, the Holmes’ butler, he had simply pointed at the chair and remained silent. Irene had guessed what was wrong (she almost always guessed right, she wasn't an idiot) and had come up with her (stupid, stupid) suggestion.
. The man hadn’t signed off (at least, Sherlock insisted it was a man) but the letters were mostly about Sherlock and how Sebastian was spying on him. Sherlock had been a bit disappointed that someone else who he'd actually
‘You call him Mycroft?’ John said, feeling slightly dazed. Sherlock nodded. ‘Of course- oh yes. He’s commonly referred to as Edward? He hates that. He hates the name Edward. I breakfasted with him this morning, and I read this hilarious article in which they referred to us as ‘Prince Sherlock, Prince Georgie and Prince Teddy.’ Oh, it made me laugh. Prince Teddy.’ Sherlock snorted with laughter and his whole face brightened up, and John couldn't help but think how much better he looked like that.
‘You remind him of your mother.’ Mycroft finished, looking at Sherlock with narrowed eyes, wanting to see some sort of reaction when Mycroft mentioned his mother. Sherlock simply coughed and quickly changed the subject (
The moment he had righted his expression, Sherlock said, ‘no, Mycroft. Harry comes onto the balcony.’
They entered the village together. John decided to take charge once they reached the centre, turning around and yelling at them to
This belief had been affirmed for him countless times. When he was three, his father (William Holmes, Snr) went to the supermarket to buy milk: he was killed by an eighteen-wheeler on the way back. When he was five, his mother (Violet Holmes) went out for dinner with her friend Jane: she met a man named Siger at the restaurant, and four years later they were married. When he was six, his brother wrote a lengthy letter to the Prime Minister about the poor diplomatic decisions that were being carried out by the government: the next day, a black car arrived at the door, and Sherrinford was gone forever. When he was eleven, he started secondary school, and he met a boy called John Watson.
His eyes seemed duller than usual, but that might just have been the grief, and John found himself staring into them like a blind man seeing the sun for the first time. He had forgotten just how beautiful, just how unique, just how perfect Sherlock’s eyes were-
Sherlock’s smile when John called him a friend was like a solar eclipse. Dark, but so bright, so brilliant, that its beauty almost blinded John.
Mrs Hudson glanced at the cook, who was listening carefully, before saying loudly, ‘no, dear. He was at the coronation, though, so he might be here. It was all very surprising, we haven't seen him in so long, have we? Why don't you go and ask Mycroft?’ But as the cook turned away Mrs Hudson pointed at a little door in the corner of the kitchen and winked.
There was no one for him in all that time, not romantically. He was far too busy, and had vowed himself off relationships after Irene’s death almost destroyed him, but then…
‘You knew who I was?’ John said, blinking rapidly. The man rolled his eyes. ‘Come on, John, of course I did. We were both drunk: clearly, you were drunker. I knew you’d remember parts of me, so I decided to let you come to me. I didn’t expect it to take eight years, of course, but you got here eventually. That’s what matters.’
‘I’m tomorrow. Six till ten.’ He’d forgotten about the rota, until John said that, but now he remembers.
There was a cough. ‘Master Sherlock? Queen Patricia asks if you would do her the honour of going to her quarters immediately.’
Irene turned around and did a thumbs up, realising that John had cottoned on. ‘Love you too, Johnny!’
John had only met Sherlock’s immediate family, his grandmother and Victor Trevor, who was his second cousin or something. Victor was there, hiding at the back of the room with a sombre expression on his face, but the others…
He doesn’t know how long they are standing there, he doesn’t know how long he’s been whispering those same two words, all he knows is that John needs him. ‘It’s okay, John-‘
Morag blushed slightly and stood up straighter, angry at being humiliated. ‘Shut up, you stupid little boy. You’re a worthless waste of my time,’ she snapped.
'Why are you here?' Sherlock said, and John smiled. ‘Mycroft showed up on my doorstep. Said something about your loss breaking his heart, that you missed me, something about Morag.' He paused and looked sideways at Sherlock. 'He needn't have tried to convince me to come. The moment I saw him I knew I would go, no matter what he said. I would have broken into that fucking Abbey if I'd had to.'
Rosie nodded, and John’s heart clenched in his chest as he watched the two of them together, tall and small, dark and light, father and daughter. ‘You mean, come out
Sherlock had always told him that Mycroft was emotionless; nothing scared him, upset him, made him feel joy. Mycroft was empty inside, Sherlock said.
‘Look who’s here!’ Irene grinned, and John awkwardly smiled. He hadn't exactly planned what he was going to say when he saw Sherlock (he hadn't even decided if he wanted to see the boy), although he had expected it to be tense, difficult and a bit
About an hour and another bottle after they started playing, John dared Irene and Janine to go for a ten minute ‘walk’ in the forest. Half an hour after they’d gone, it was obvious they weren't coming back, and Mike sighed as he hauled himself up. ‘I should be going,’ he explained as he gently edged off the roof. ‘I have a volleyball game to referee early in the morning.’
Sherlock stood up, smiling tightly. ‘What do you mean, step-mummy dearest? Do you mean that my daddy will disown me? Possibly have the person I love exiled, killed?’
‘I see you made an effort.’ Mycroft broke the silence, staring at his brother in interest. ‘New cologne, new suit, even combed your hair.’
doesn’t break his wrist: rather, his soulmate does, and, of course, the injury reflects itself exactly on Sherlock. He’s awoken by a horrible pain and screams as loudly as he can: his mother runs, his father runs, even his overweight brother runs, crowding around his bed as he cries and cries, watching the bright red bruises pop up all over his left arm. It’s happened before, of course it has, in the form of red scratches or red lumps on a banged head, even red spots all over his body from what must have been chickenpox, but never like this. Never this bad.
‘Go on, then.’ Morag said. ‘Mrs Hudson and I are going to go downstairs to see how cook is doing with lunch. Aren’t we, Mrs Hudson?’
‘Oh,’ Jim said suddenly. ‘I’m afraid I might have told a little white lie when I introduced myself, John. Although most people call me Jim,
‘What were they?’ John gasped, and Sherlock wanted to tell him to shut up, to leave, now, and he wanted to tell him everything he had kept from him before James could, but his mouth wasn't working and his voice was catching in his throat and he couldn't believe that James Moriarty still had the power to paralyse him like this. Once again, Sherlock felt like a lonely fifteen year old who couldn't believe that someone was actually showing interest in him and he
Seven people had come out onto the balcony, aged from about thirty-five to twenty. At first, John didn’t recognise any of them (were they the doctors who had examined William’s body?) and tried to look past them, searching the balcony for Sherlock-
‘But not the others?’ John asked. Sherlock shook his head. ‘Morag won’t let them anywhere near the castle. But when my father dies, I’m going to summon them when we do the balcony speech, and everyone can see what exactly goes on behind the scenes of our lives.’
That’s what he called it: the line of dark blue skin that encircled his left wrist, exactly like a bracelet. He’d seen bond marks before: he’d touched both of his parents’, marvelling at the slightly puckered skin, but he’d never seen one quite so prominent as his. It was so noticeable that it was always the first thing anyone commented on, and then he had to tell them that no, he wasn’t with his soulmate, because all he could remember about his soulmate was curly dark hair, a masculine voice and brilliantly soft lips. He didn’t have a name, a number, an age, even a nationality. He had nothing.
John waited a moment, not trusting himself to speak, before saying hoarsely, ‘And I don't want to leave. God, Sherlock, I don’t.’ He paused. ‘But I have to.’
John sniggered before losing interest and hauling himself out of the chair. ‘We should play a game.’   He wandered over to the desk before pulling out two post-it notes, flourishing them extravagantly. ‘Aha! Sher, Sher, Sher.’ He passed Sherlock a post-it note. ‘Write down a person.’
‘I know.’ Sherlock leaned against the table, hardly able to believe what he had just done. ‘God, John.
‘Goodbye, James Moriarty,’ Sherlock whispers. With a kick of his flanks, Hadrian is running, and Sherlock is free.
John, who was more surprised by the suggestion that he should dirty dance with Sherlock, stared at his friend in bemusement.
‘No idea?’ Sherlock said. ‘I don’t understand.’ ‘You’re brilliant.’ John murmured. ‘You’re amazing, Sherlock, and you have no idea. How could I not love you? How could anyone not love you?’
And now here they were again, ready to see the royal family without the man who had led them for forty-seven years. They were ready to see a widowed Queen, fatherless children (it occurred to John that both Sherlock and Mycroft were now orphans) and a nineteen year old boy who was now the most powerful person in the world.
‘Consulting detective, I know.’ He kissed Sherlock lightly on the lips and held up his paintbrush. ‘But, at the same time, I think you should let me paint a little rainbow on your cheek so you can take your place as King of the Gays.’
As Sherlock led the way down the corridor Victor, who was looking at him anxiously, whispered, ‘they still won’t-‘
‘Tell me, John.’ William continued. ‘Did you actively try and make my son a homosexual? Did you deliberately turn him towards ideas so unnatural, so nauseating, so wrong? Did you-‘
‘They don’t speak of it.’ Sherlock said quietly. ‘They pretend they never knew anything. Mycroft and Trisha are fine with it, but everyone else…it’s the ultimate sin. I told them it was an accident, a one-off, and they believed me. I hope.’
John Watson glared contemptuously at Jim, then turned around and walked towards the door, and quietly left the room without so much as a backwards glance at Sherlock.
‘Clever?’ Sherlock was just throwing out adjectives now: he had absolutely no idea, and he’d already forgotten the premise of the game. He just liked seeing John happy and smiling and at Baker Street, away from
Mycroft sighed and exchanged a ‘married’ look with Lestrade; Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘It’s not that bad.’
But Sherlock was standing there, a wicked smile on his regal features, and John wanted to know why he looked so sad.
with the whole situation: the dying, the riddles, the lack of control. Maybe Mycroft’s right, and he’s been Moriarty’s puppet for months and months, but at least until recently he didn’t
Sherlock ducked through a door and began effortlessly making his way through the palace. John was grateful they didn’t pass anyone, though not surprised; it must have had over two hundred rooms, six floors and huge grounds. Sherlock ran up four flights of stairs and down two hallways, stopping when he saw an older woman making her way down the corridor.
But he had to, because he couldn’t tell them who he really was. He could never see the disappointment in his father’s eyes, could never hear the whispers around the palace, could never watch them turn his little brother against him because of the gender he preferred.
David Nathaniel, the baby of the family, instantly guesses what’s going on. John finds this odd, because he’s only eight, but doesn't contradict him: instead the two sit, side-by-side on the sofa, and talk. John tells him about the old days, about Sherlock, about Nathaniel and about love, and he tells David that he shouldn't be sad because John’s had a long life and it’s time to go to sleep, now. Finally,
Morag was standing up, arms crossed. Sherlock was on the other side of the room, dressed in a dark suit, his mouth open in a strange expression.
Jenny nodded, a strange look on her face. Sherlock wondered what was wrong but detained from saying anything as the woman smiled. ‘It was lovely to meet you, Prin- Sherlock. Surreal, but lovely.’
John stared at him in amazement (clearly at how clever he was). ‘Are you…we don't even have a King!’
It was only a few minutes longer before their son was delivered into the world, with big blue eyes and a few errant dark curls stuck to his forehead, wailing with a dramatic air that befit a son of Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock was right on the edge of the building, just a step from falling. His head was held high, his hands outstretched. He looked like a dark angel about to fall from heaven, John realised numbly.
John turned away from Sherlock and stepped out of the resort, guilt and vengeance twisting in his gut.
‘I think you do,’ Sherlock agreed, and when he reached out to take John’s hand, John let him. He let Sherlock hold his hand, and he let Sherlock drag him through the crowd and into the heart of the parade.
I just- I haven't seen Sherlock for a year, and he’s my best friend, and suddenly I come here and I’m not-‘
Sherlock squared his shoulders. ‘You’re right. I need- I need to do this.’ He sighed. ‘John. We’ve known each other a fair few months.’
It was no-brainer. John watched Sherlock walk towards his father and he resigned himself to the fact that of course Sherlock would choose his family, of course he would. It was the only sane option, particularly when you stood to inherit the most powerful nation in the world, God, John was being so, so stupid-
It doesn't matter that this goes against John’s policy of breaking Sherlock because he has never seen the younger man so sad, and for some reason it hurts
Suddenly, a hand seized Irene’s shoulder and pulled her towards them; Sherlock frowned when he saw Charlotte Bennet, Irene’s once-favourite client. ‘Irene,’ Charlotte whispered, ‘I need to tell you something.’
Irene rolled her eyes and smiled fondly at Jacob. She would never say so, but Jacob was by far her favourite of his children; she was even his godmother.
Mycroft had kept it hidden well; Sherlock had had no inkling that his favourite brother was gay, and that was saying something because Sherlock was very, very rarely wrong. And now Mycroft looked so vulnerable, so open to harassment, and he was just looking at Sherlock with that resigned expression, as if Sherlock was going to tell him he was stupid and that he was going to get hurt and that if their father ever found out he was totally buggered.
‘Go down now.’ Irene said, gesturing at the door. ‘You’ll be able to formally greet all your important guests of honour.’
Sherlock’s tongue in his mouth, Sherlock’s face cupped in his hand, Sherlock’s chest pressed again his.
It’s John that reaches up, in the end. It’s John that presses his lips to Sherlock’s, and it’s John who burns out Sherlock’s matchstick, blows out the last lick of fire, and consumes his soul with the universe. It’s John who snakes his hands into Sherlock’s hair, pulling him close, desperately kissing him like everything is ending, everything is broken, everything is destroyed, and all that’s left is Sherlock and John in the remains of the lives they’ve built for, with, against each other: the lives they might have had, if Moriarty and Reichenbach and Mary and Magnusson and the aquarium had never happened.
Sherlock crowed as he finally untied the kayak and shoved it into the lake. It was for two people and John hopped in the back before he could change his mind: Sherlock tossed him a paddle and then leapt into the front seat. ‘Keep quiet,’ Sherlock warned, and took a paddle. ‘Now. Follow my lead.’
if this wasn’t something he’d even considered (or at least, thought he’d considered) before twenty-five minutes ago,
‘Stop, drop, roll,’ Dante interrupted, and John looked disturbed as he put his son on the floor next to the girls. ‘He’s sixteen months old, Sherlock, and he knows what to do in the event of a fire. I
Sherlock was hot, and he didn’t care that he might never see him again, because he’d had the night of his life regardless.
John furrowed his eyebrows, unsure what Sherlock could possibly mean. ‘What, me getting shot?’ He meant it as a joke but Sherlock looked up at him, eyes brimming with tears, and nodded. ‘People get close to me and get hurt, John. I’m a canker. I’m poisonous. I’m dangerous-‘
‘Right then,' Mycroft said pissily, eyebrows raised as he finally took off his headset. ‘I will go on the right of John, Harriet on the left of Sherlock, Archie on the right of myself, Trisha on the left of Harriet. Family unity. Parker,’ he addressed the announcer, ‘you shall announce Harriet first, then Trisha, the then me, then John, then Sherlock.’
‘He likes her because she’s new and exciting,’ his mother comforted. ‘He’s known you for two years and you’ve Skyped almost every day for the last year…’
‘I’m sorry,’ Sherlock sniffed, the tears finally stopping. ‘I’m sorry for putting you through that. I’m sorry for not telling you about my mother. I’m sorry for the roof, I’m sorry for even thinking about leaving you, John.’
thing to say, with a sneer on his face and rolling his eyes, but James wasn’t here and Sherlock could do as he wanted.
‘Ah!’ Sherlock said, looking incredibly pleased. ‘Guy talk? Let’s see. John, let me take out my cellular device and show you some pornography. Is that guy talk?’
He couldn’t mean that. Surely Sherlock hadn’t meant to say he was willing to give up his throne, his family, his home for John?
Eventually Xander made his way onto John’s lap, crooning up at his uncle with intelligent babble; John nodded, smiling at the little boy, pretending he knew what he was talking about. Greg watched them, laughing as Xander attempted to climb onto John’s back and up onto his shoulders. John obliged, pulling the baby onto his shoulders and cantering around the room as his nephew laughed hysterically. Talia protested, not wanting to be left out, and John had to do it again, a small child hanging onto his head.
That was how it was with siblings, Sherlock thought fondly. Mycroft still lived in Buckingham, along with Sherlock and his family, with Lestrade, Xander, Talia and Ruthie, whilst Archie toured the world promoting the Holmes empire. He couldn’t imagine growing up with either of them, particularly Mycroft.
‘Furthest shelf to the left, third row up, far left.’ Sherlock shot John a quick, insincere smile, and dropped back to the floor, hidden from view.
‘I didn’t mean to.’ Harry said, words slightly slurred. It hadn’t been as noticeable when she was shouting, and John was hit by an unmistakeable wave of disappointment. ‘I just-‘
Sherlock paused and looked down at John. His eyes were conflicted, John could see, even through the lust still visible. ‘No,’ he said carefully. ‘I’ve never been in a relationship before.’
‘Fine,’ John whispered hoarsely. He could barely believe this was happening and he only just noticed his hands were shaking and
A creak of a door, and Sherlock raises his gaze to meet the eyes of a thirty-year-old with eyes that have seen over eight decades, leaning heavily on a sword.
John smiled again, softer this time, and laid a hand on Sherlock’s bicep (the younger boy tried hard not to shiver) and replied, ‘of course they will, Sherlock. They’ll see you as I see you, and they’ll love you just as much.’
James smiles, kisses him lightly, and leaves the room. Sherlock hears him go downstairs, hears the slam of the front door, and then watches as he breaks the blanket of snow.
Jenny looked at him warmly and put a hand on his shoulder, seemingly forgetting who he was for a moment. ‘I’m sorry, dear.’ She said quietly. ‘It must be hard.’
Nathaniel graduating is one of the happiest days of John’s life. Watching his son walk away from the top University in the country with the highest honours makes him proud, certainly, but it’s watching Nathaniel with his friend’s before and after the ceremony that truly makes John smile. He’s so easy with them and clearly very popular: almost all of his classmates stop to talk to him or congratulate him in some way, and John can almost imagine Sherlock standing next to him saying
‘Sorry for interrupting the sexy times you had scheduled with Lestrade then,’ Sherlock smirked. Mycroft rolled his eyes. ‘Must you, brother mine?’
‘They’ll kill you if I don’t, John.’ Sherlock said, voice resigned. ‘They told me that they’ll kill you-‘
would be accused of being gay? If so, that was absurd, and Sherlock had a good mind to snap at John about it.
Sherlock nods, moving closer to the younger man, clasping the back of his neck with his hand. ‘Yes. Yes, you’re right. ‘A pause. ‘But to stop the sounds I’d have to stop doing this,’ he kissed Victor, gently, ‘And this,’ he threads his hands in Victor’s hair, ‘And this.’ He pulled them back together, craving the feel of Victor, every part of Victor, back against him. ‘Do you want that?’
John sighs and sits up because he can’t stand his daughter looking at him like that, eyes crinkled and mouth tight. She’s had just as bad a time as he has: she lost the man she considered a father, the man who had brought her up. Mary had died three months after Lizzie’s birth, and John had moved in with Sherlock, her godfather, when she was one. By the time she was three John and Sherlock were intimate and Sherlock had legally adopted her on her tenth birthday and she had changed her name from Elizabeth Sherlock Watson to Elizabeth Sherlock Watson-Holmes (
‘Everything will go back to normal,’ a woman dressed in a suit just behind William (John thought it might be his sister but he wasn't totally sure) answered.
‘Irrelevant.’ Sherlock dismissed, waving his hand anxiously. A woman was walking up the gravel towards them, and although Sherlock couldn’t see her properly from this distance it looked terrifyingly like Morag. ‘Physical appearance?’
It wasn't in that way, at first. They were just together, in the innocent sense, like they’d been when they were children and happy. Everything was simple, everything was perfect, and John was content with it just as it was.
John is everything, and as they give themselves to each other in the swimming pool building where Carl Powers breathed his last, Sherlock is absolutely fine with that.
‘I love you.’ Sherlock gasped as John pulled away again, kissing his chin and his neck. ‘God, John, I love you, I really, really do.’
John let out a laugh, a half-overjoyed half-bewildered laugh. ‘Sherlock, we’re not even officially dating. What happened to ‘I don’t like labels’?’
It hadn’t done any good, though. The boy had died; his name was Sherrinford Scott, and he was twenty one years old, the exact same age as Sherlock.
John laughed. ‘God, no. No, Molly’s just a mate. I don’t like her like that, and even if I did, I couldn’t compete with Prince Sherlock. She’s got the biggest crush on him.’
Jim didn’t stop him; John actually thought he looked a little relieved. The Irish man waited until Sherlock had crossed away from the edge and was standing right next to John before smiling, chuckling as he looked at the two men.
‘You’re an idiot.’ He said to himself. It was too quiet so he screamed it, repeating the same four words over and over, shouting to the sky, ‘you’re an idiot!’
is the group aged between ten and twelve.’ Mycroft pointed at the curly-haired boy’s group. ‘The second,
don’t beat, but there is something so fragile, so beautiful, about the steady thrum of a mortal heart, and Victor’s mortal heart is all he has. It’s all he needs.
Sherlock grabbed James’ tie and pulled him towards him, their lips meeting in a wet, passionate, lust-filled kiss.
This time, they make it to the bedroom. John fucks Sherlock for most of the night, tearing orgasm after orgasm out of him as the adrenalin grows and grows and
‘I’d marry you whatever you’d said, you stupid sod,’ John whispered, and then they were kissing, Sherlock’s lips fitting perfectly around his, side by side, touching all over, together forever.
The announcer stepped forwards to the microphone and Sherlock groaned inwardly. On a bad day, this process could take up to an hour. ‘On this day,’ the announcer bellowed, the sound echoing around the courtyard and through every screen in the Kingdom, ‘the seventh of August, the country and her kingdom celebrates the sixty-second birthday of our monarch, King William VII. Presenting, King William Henry Siger Richard,’ his father stepped forward and waved; the crowd went wild. Sherlock sighed and shifted to his other foot; he was always last. They started with the King, out of respect, then went from least important to most. ‘Princesses Octavia Rose and Lila Penelope, daughters of Prince Richard Stephen Thomas; Queen Patricia; Prince Edward Mycroft; Prince George Francis Archibald and,’ Sherlock glared at the floor and prepared to step forwards, ‘the heir apparent, Prince William Sherlock Scott.’
‘You should have let me go with John, Mycroft, you know that.’ Sherlock replied in a tight, clipped voice. ‘There was no reason for you to forbid me-‘
After the ceremony Nathaniel runs over with Charlotte, smiling as widely as John has ever seen him smile. He’s so like Sherlock that it hurts to look at him, sometimes: the same sharp cheekbones, the same tall, slender, dancer’s build, the same eyes and the same curly black hair. The only notable differences are the dimples, the left-handedness and slightly shorter face, which Nathaniel seems to like. ‘I don't want to be his clone,’ he’s said more than once. ‘I’m my own person.’
Mycroft groaned. ‘You are determined to make everything harder for me, aren’t you, Sherlock? Fine, Harriet can go out, but I’m afraid her…’
It isn't just these sporting activities that gave him the thrill, though. John regularly taunts the other children, the bigger the better, just so they will chase him round the playground and he can run from them. He’ll pinch and whine and bite just to provoke a reaction and feel that rush of pure
‘I’m surprised,’ Irene says, voice as calm and collected as always. ‘Why do you want to marry me, Mr Holmes? Do you love me?’
The astonishing thing was, John realised, that he was being completely and utterly truthful. He didn’t want to live without Sherlock; that was probably unhealthy, ridiculous but John honestly didn’t care. A life without Sherlock wasn’t a life at all; a life without Sherlock was truly and utterly devoid of meaning.
Lestrade nodded, blinking rapidly. Sherlock felt slightly guilty which was absurd; he never felt guilty, why would he suddenly now? He was Sherlock Holmes; he cared about nothing and no one, ever.
‘I have a temper,’ James replies. ‘I have a temper. I’m sorry about that, but I love you.’ Silence. ‘As you love me.’
Mike was scrawling on a piece of paper. ‘If you write him a sonnet, that’s a love poem, he’ll think that you’re a genius.’
Victor followed him as he sauntered towards the gate. The sun was too bright; it made everything look more…there. Sherlock often got a headache when he went into London; the noise, the people, the stories, all around him. Sometimes…
Mary is getting suspicious. John knows that he shouldn't have named all three of his children after Sherlock but he
‘For real,’ Rosie said, and both John and Sherlock turned their heads to look at their daughter. ‘Are you going to stare into each other’s eyes for the rest of the evening, or are you going to collect your child? Christ, fathers.’ Sherlock chuckled slightly, his colour slowly coming back, and chucked Rosie under the chin. ‘Alright, alright.’ And then, glancing at Greg, hair covered in dust from the untouched room and coat swaying around his shins, ‘You’ll have to solve this one alone, Lestrade. We have to go and have a baby.’
‘Car,’ Sherlock said, and John could hear him moving, sitting up maybe. ‘I didn't want to get instantly shot down when I did this.’
Because it was Sherlock, his Sherlock, his face on the television and John had had no idea just how much he had missed that face, missed Sherlock, until he saw it for the first time in what seemed like forever.
the summer,’ Sherlock spat. ‘Because it’s brilliant. Fucking brilliant, and then it ends, and you have to go. It deceives you into thinking everything will be ok, and then it takes it all away at the end.’
‘I’m not in the mood.’ Sherlock stepped back, fixing John with a pale-blue stare so intense John felt himself blush. ‘Um, I need-‘
Sherlock made his way back to the throne and sat down. The crowd stood; those in the Royal Box stood; John stood.
John knows he is dying when he collapses in the supermarket a few days after his ninetieth birthday. The doctors say it’s a brain tumour, inoperable, and that he’ll be dead by the end of the summer: he doesn't mind, doesn't want treatment, just wants to let nature take its course. He’s had a long and fulfilling life and he knows it’s time to finish, now, leaving behind all of those people he loves.
This continued for most of the night. Eventually John fell asleep, crouched next to Sherlock on the floor, and when he awoke, Sherlock was plucking his violin, watching from his armchair. He wasn't crying anymore and his eyes were scarcely pink, but he didn't say anything. He just raised a finger to his lips, smiled such a bittersweet smile that John’s heart cracked a little, and continued to play.
. Sherlock didn’t know how long they talked, only that when he finally turned away from Hamish to glance at the hall the tables were gone, and everyone was dancing.
: the walls inside are still blue. They sell the same kind of coffee, and they sell the same kind of cake. But now a different teenager sits behind the counter, reading Hemingway and ignoring the customers: different regulars come in weekly, trying to find that one novel that will allow them to escape for seven days. There are now two children who run around, a blonde girl and her dark younger brother, stealing cake and running upstairs to share with their fathers.
John was a worrier, and by the time he reached the palace, he had convinced himself that Sherlock had died in some horrible way and that he had been summoned to be informed of this by Sherlock’s grieving father and crying brothers, dressed all in black.
Many had thought she should remain as the Queen when William turned eighteen and there had been public outcry from millions all over the world. However she had gracefully declined the offer to stay on the throne when her son offered it to her, retiring to Windsor with her younger children and assisting from afar.
John caught sight of a smirk before the boy put his head back down, talking to the table. ‘I have a message from a Mike Stamford? He can’t make it. He’s on a shift.’
‘Glad to hear it.’ Jim, who was carving something into an apple with a wickedly sharp knife that clearly did not belong on the table, stood up. ‘Excuse me a moment.’
He was even willing to attend the stupidest social occasion ever invented if it meant John would come with him.
Sherlock was utterly dominant; Sherlock had the personality of someone who was born to be in charge. Yet with James he was hit by emotions so subservient it pained him to even think about it, most of the time.
Mycroft didn’t attempt to comfort him; the moment John had stopped speaking he was off, sprinting surprisingly quickly and leaving John in the hallway, alone.
anything. You should never underestimate Jim Moriarty, though, you’d said it so many times, and by the time I’d got to you there were bullets through that brilliant brain and you were dead.’ John puts his head on the gravestone. ‘I can’t do anything about that now, Sherlock, though
It was beyond humiliating to be approaching your boyfriend completely naked after cheating on him with the biggest threat to the security of his country since Al Qaeda as the come of the biggest threat to the security of his country since Al Qaeda slid slowly down the inside of his legs.
Henry was looking between he and John in a way that was most disconcerting. It reminded Sherlock of the way John looked at him, sometimes; like he could see everything Sherlock was thinking. John and Sherlock were very similar in that aspect, although while Sherlock deduced pure fact, John deduced emotion.
John sat in the red chair and checked his phone for messages; nothing. Sherlock was still looking at him, as if waiting for him to speak, and John suddenly felt incredibly uncomfortable. He was in Buckingham palace, seemingly illegally, with the heir to the throne, and what the hell did they have in common? They came from different worlds, for God’s sake-
‘I do wish you’d stop calling it the creepy telepathic thing,’ Sherlock mumbled into his hands. ‘You mentioned it to Alicia Cooper-‘
‘I’m over here, idiot.’ John approached the counter timidly, before leaning over and looking down. ‘Hullo?’
Anderson looked shell-shocked; the other detectives looked a mixture of envious, scared and angry; Sally looked like she was going to throw up. Sherlock smiled slightly to himself as he followed Lestrade across the street to where the other body was lying under a blanket, covered completely.
The guilt was responsible for all the hardships in Sherlock’s life, and if that guilt had just been banished when he was a child it could all have been avoided.
John covered his face with his hands. ‘Please don’t say you like my sister just after you've given me a blowjob.’ Sherlock had grinned before leaning towards John slowly, smiling down at him with an expression that even John couldn’t read, and he didn't even seem to care that Harry knew. Although the whole world now knew it was John who was Sherlock’s mysterious best friend, John had asked his family not to talk about Sherlock with anyone, and Sherlock seemed to think that this would still apply despite Harry knowing that they were in a sexual relationship.
‘If I want to what?’ John said, and he was suddenly angry, so so angry, angry at this nanny and Sherlock's father and that
He fell to his knees and looked up at the blue, shining sky. The grass was scratchy, even through his trousers, and the ground felt hard on his knees.
‘Thank you!’ Sherlock beamed. ‘I mean, that would be wonderful.’ He turned to Harry and bowed his head. ‘Pleased to meet you, Harry.’
John was now just staring at him. Sherlock continued, all that anger he had been holding inside him about his sexuality and the hatred towards LGBT John seemed to possess flowing out. ‘You’re my best friend, John, and I love you, but seriously. I am taking no more shit about who I am. Yes, I’m gay. No, it’s not a phase. If that makes you feel sick, if that makes you want to stop being my friend, then get the fuck out-‘
‘Technically,’ Sherlock drawled, ‘I have nine half-siblings. Including Mycroft and Archie.’ He frowned slightly. Sherlock thought of Mycroft at least as his full-sibling.
‘Say that again,’ he says, and Sherlock complies, promising himself that no other word will ever leave his lips. ‘John, John, John, John,
‘I am afraid,’ he said, voice cracking slightly, ‘that I am bearing bad news to you today. Yesterday, my family was hit by tragedy.’
John wasn’t gay. He made that very clear. What he was…was appreciative of attractive people. Yes. That was it. Appreciative. That was all. He didn’t let it bother him, just tried to avoid males.
Smith told him what happened, when John woke up. He told John how the shots had stopped as soon as he hit the ground, and he and Isaac and Becca had carried him and Hunter back as quickly they could. John had lost a hell of a lot of blood, Smith said, and it had been touch and go for about twenty-four hours.
John didn’t say anything, a cold feeling settling in his stomach. Was Sherlock talking about Jim? Oh, god, was he still in love with Jim?
'It doesn't matter,' Jenny spat. 'Why would she do that?' Jenny Watson hated Morag, advisor to the royal family, with a passion. She had seen Morag as the main reason why nobody could be told of Sherlock and John’s romantic arrangement and had been outraged when the older woman had literally threatened the Watson family if they dared breathe a word of John and Sherlock’s relationship to anybody.
‘But it’ll be funny,’ Sherlock pleaded quietly, smiling at the paparazzi on the other side of the street. God, he hated them, those leeches, following him around like parasites. ‘Please? All you have to do is pull down your pants and run. They can't show your face so you're home free. Please, Jawn?’
‘What did you do to her?’ Sherlock almost growled, standing up. His eyes were wet with tears but he looked so tall and threatening that John had to resist the urge to back away.
That was the thing about James. He was a fucking master manipulator, and his manipulating abilities were never better than when the person he was talking to did actually believe what he was saying, and Sherlock knew that Jim was being truthful. Jim did understand, Jim would never say those things to Sherlock, Jim had always listened to him-
. I might not have known Dad, but I sure as hell know you, and I am naming my son after you whether you like it or not.’ Nathaniel pauses for breath, looking almost angry. ‘Well?’
‘I love you,’ he snarled, and the words were as twisted as the emotions that Sherlock felt towards this man standing in front of him, because Sherlock did love him but not in the right way. It was not a healthy, good love, not the sort of love that Sherlock felt for John and that was why he knew that choosing John was right and perfect and brilliant. ‘But I hate you, James Moriarty. I hate you, and I hate myself for loving you-‘
‘You’ll see what we’ve been dealing with for the past nineteen years then, won’t you?’ Mycroft had retorted, looking incredibly smug. He had been delighted that Sherlock had been hired a sort of
Before Sherlock had the chance to violently combat the statement, the woman with the paintbrush eagerly turned to John and shouted excitedly, ‘Movement! We’re moving, Team Rainbow!’
They’ve been cleaned up and John can easily see that they are beautiful, beautiful children. One is slightly bigger, with a smarting of blonde hair and Nathaniel’s eyes, whilst the other has dark curls and bright blue eyes.
Sherlock bowed his head and closed his eyes, as the voice belonging to the person that he loved most in the world and the voice that he wanted to hear least in the world washed over him.
‘But I thought you liked John!’ Sherlock had whined, glaring at his brother. ‘Remember? The Ritz? ‘I believe that John Watson is good for you’? Mycroft, please!’
and shown to the screaming crowds, and then he was signing papers and talking to world leaders and finally, finally he was pushed into a limousine (realising that it was dark outside; he had been crowned
Sherlock’s voice softened a fraction as he said, ‘are you really going to do this? Disown me, Father? Just for…just because of who I am?’
‘Four months, eighteen days, two hours.’ Sherlock interrupted. John threw him an exasperated look, though inside he was freaking out (
‘Sorry, Master John.’ Jack said easily. ‘I address the Holmes family and their guests with the same titles, as I am required.’
‘You have.’ A man interrupted. Sherlock could hear the low tone of a commander and knew instantly this was John’s father, an ex-soldier. ‘You go to school at eight, go straight to God knows where until eleven at night, and then leave again at eight the next day. You’re never here on weekends, either. I would get angry but your marks at school have been so good there’s nothing to be bothered about-‘
Above the till, there is a picture of a blond haired man, younger than he is now and smiling in a tuxedo in front of a wedding arbour, leaning against a taller, dark boy, who has captured the light of the day in his eyes. Next to it, in the sloping handwriting of a genius, it is written:
John could see that something had happened to make him feel like this, possibly more than one thing. But Sherlock couldn’t, or wouldn’t, tell him.
John paused, put his head in his hands, and said, 'the thing is, Sherlock, that I can't help but love you, even though I tried, I tried
John didn’t say anything. Sherlock sighed. ‘I came to apologise. You must understand, I don’t- I don’t do this sort of thing. Communication with new people, talking about my life, what I’ve done.’
A very tanned, smiling french man with fluffy brown hair came up behind Mycroft, casually touching his waist as he said, ‘ Vous aviez besoin, ma chérie. Votre père vous veut là-bas, l'organisation de la chose déclaration de la police.’ He made a face before kissing Mycroft on the cheek. ‘Je ne comprende pas.’
He coughed as he said, ‘To some people,’ stuttering on the S. Sherlock leaned very slightly forward, and John leaned in as well (subconsciously?). ‘Do people,’ he said quietly, and for some reason the alcohol clouding his head seemed to be evaporating, ‘Like me?’
‘We need everybody we can,’ Violet said. She looked terrible: worried and pale and sick with anxiety. ‘Thank you so much, John.’
Sherlock’s hands, which had been on his shoulder and in his hair, moved suddenly downwards, hitching John’s leg up to his waist, pressing John further into the door and lifting him up, and John could hardly breathe at this point, as he stared into those dancing eyes and felt an unimaginable urge rising up inside him, up and up and up until he felt like he was going to explode with sheer
It was a voice that had haunted his dreams and his reality; a voice that Sherlock had craved yet despised because even as it made him happy it made him heartbreakingly sad. It was a voice as sticky as honey, as warm as a summer’s day, as clear as spring water.
John had arrived at two in the morning; Sherlock had snuck him through the back door and up the stairs. Unfortunately, in his fatigued state (DI Lestrade, who was both a detective inspector at Scotland Yard and a constant member of the royal family’s police guard, had snuck him in a delicious double homicide and he’d been awake for one hundred and one hours solving it, bouncing ideas off John as he sat, amused, in his favourite red chair), Sherlock had forgotten to lock the door, and when Mycroft had heard voices in the early hours of the morning coming from his younger brother’s room he had (fairly, in John’s opinion) assumed that someone had snuck in and was attempting to kidnap Sherlock. It wouldn't have been the first time, and it certainly wouldn't be the last.
‘There was no body on the roof.’ Mycroft was pacing, tapping his umbrella against the floor. ‘No body.’
Sherlock had done an unscheduled address, a few weeks after their births. He smiled as he remembered the look on Mycroft’s face when he told him.
Sherlock quickly took out a piece of paper, jotted something down on it with the pen Irene had left on the table, and pocketed it. Ignoring Hamish’s curious looks and Mycroft’s querying gaze, he followed him out of the room, up two flights of stairs and into a small room that overlooked the hall: he could see Irene talking to Anthea, Jim sitting next to a huge blonde boy with stupid eyes. ‘Why did you take me here?’ He hissed, ducking down. ‘They can’t see me, I’ll be called down-‘
and John shakes his head because Sherlock is more than that. Sherlock is the one that John loves and Sherlock will always be the one that John loves, but John has spent much too long orchestrating this to stop it now. He’s chasing the biggest thrill of his life and he will
’ John fought, trying desperately to remove his father’s hands, but they stuck firm and before he knew it the sounds and smells and sights of the parade had disappeared, and the Watsons were walking away from the happiness.
way, Sherlock, which in my opinion is a lot better because at least I can have normal, human relationships and at least people generally
Sherlock talked about a little boy who had been hit when he didn’t get dressed quickly enough, slapped if he didn’t eat his dinner and pinched if he tried to play the violin or dance. A little boy who was told by the nanny that it was his fault that his mother had died, that he was a curse, and that if he hadn’t been born she would still be alive, and his father would still laugh, and Mycroft would still be at home where he belonged. She told him that everyone would be so much happier if Sherlock just wasn’t there, that he would be a terrible King, and that if he told anyone what she did to him she would tell the King that it was Sherlock’s fault his mother had died, because at the moment the King didn't know that it was all Sherlock's fault, and didn't Sherlock want to keep it that way?
Later, as they frame the photograph depicting Sherlock sprinting towards the falling photographer, Irene half-standing and Felix smirking in delight, Sherlock broaches what Mycroft said: what, for the majority of the day, has been playing on his life. ‘Marry me, Irene Adler.’
‘He might be faking it,’ Sherlock conceded, ‘But I don’t think he is. And he seems to enjoy this arrangement, us all together at Baker Street. And Mary practically gave us her blessing!’
‘Amen,’ echoed the crowd. Sherlock just stood there, a robot, still, not comprehending what was happening because all his brain could say, shout, scream was
William looked relieved, completely swallowing Sherlock’s load of bullshit. ‘Of course you are, Sherlock. See, mother? Right, boys. We’ll rendezvous in the morning. You must be tired, mother.’
‘This can’t continue.’ Morag said from behind William. She was actually smiling, John noticed. What bitch smiled as she broke the hearts of two teenagers? ‘William,’ John remembered she was the only person who called Sherlock William and grit his teeth, ‘you will be banned from leaving the palace without supervision. You will not be allowed to see your friends, you will get a therapist to see if he can work out why you’re having these unnatural urges. John Watson, you will never set foot in this palace again. In fact, your highness,’ she turned to the King, ‘now I think about it, maybe we could get a restraining order against him.’
Jim hadn't seemed to mind; he had kept himself occupied with Sebby Moran, a national shooting champion with an IQ of about 90 and a height of about six foot five who had become almost devoted to Jim in the five years since he had started at their school. He was in the year below, so Sherlock rarely saw him and Jim together, but Irene had confirmed that Sebby was smitten and even Jim seemed more than impartial-
They soon reached the two pitches. The older two groups took one (Harry was pulled in by a pretty girl with blonde hair and smiley brown eyes) and
John hesitated before frowning. ‘God, why am I considering this? Seriously, Sher. I’ll be kicked out of the country. Do they still execute people in the Tower?’
Sherlock took out his Infant Notebook, flicking through the pages until he found what he was looking for. ‘As it’s Lila’s third birth, I’m hopeful it will be fast. As long as there are no…complications.’ For a moment, he looked as panic outside as John knew he was inside, but it was soon hidden back under his façade as he pocketed the book and laid a protective hand on Rosie’s shoulder. ‘And you’ll only be alone for a little bit, darling.’
The man smiled, and reached up, kissing John quickly on the lips. ‘Obviously. The name’s Sherlock Holmes.’
‘Listen, John. I don’t want to be talking to you anymore than you want to be talking to me.’ She paused and sighed. ‘I’m here with Jim-‘
‘We each ask three questions, you can skip one. Or answer them all. Your choice.’ John wondered suddenly if Sherlock was going to laugh at him and tell him he was immature or stupid, but he needn’t have worried: Sherlock, having pondered the suggestion, nodded. ‘I’ll go first. Where’s your father, who is the girl who’s been texting you nonstop, and why did you give up on the army?’
And Sherlock was panicking madly, running towards the door, throwing it open and screaming John’s name but the older boy was gone, gone forever and it was all Sherlock’s fault, and he wanted to follow him but that sensible voice in the back of his mind was telling him he couldn't run around the palace naked, especially not with the most wanted man in the Kingdom lying on his bed with his come drying on the bedsheets, and so Sherlock went back into his room and started grabbing his clothes. It was desperate, it was pointless but he had to go and find John, he had to try, though he knew he wouldn’t be let out of the palace, he couldn’t cause a scene, but he had to at least try because a life without John was a life without meaning.
Lizzie goes first, scuffing the ground with her shoes. ‘Hi, Dad. Long time no see. I’m in my first year at Uni now, studying English and History. I can almost imagine what you’d have said- you’d have been pissed that I wasn't becoming a detective like you! Sorry, I just didn't have that talent. Natty does, though, so maybe one of your kids’ll follow in your footsteps. I miss you every day, Dad.’ She sniffs and turns away from John and Nathaniel: she hates crying in front of other people. ‘I bought a chemistry set from the Uni, I had one of my friends nick it. I remember when you did your experiments and I’d help, and then Papa would yell at us.’ She pauses once more. ‘I miss that, Dad. Love you.’
Sherlock didn't generally like new people. Although he was popular with every single child in the resort, the only ones he really liked were John, Janine, Molly and Mike. He’d know the latter three since he was tiny and John…well. John was an anomaly, and John liked that.
John nodded in agreement, smiling supportively at his mother. It was their first holiday together since the divorce and he wanted it to be a success for her. ‘I think this’ll be great,’ he lied. ‘I really do.’
John shook his head and lay next to Hunter, staring at the wire mesh on the top of the bunk, and dismissed Sherlock from his mind. He couldn't think about the other man without feeling that overwhelming sense of despair, and he couldn't be incapacitated out here. If you didn't concentrate, you died, and John was determined not to die. He had to get back to Sherlock.
‘Maybe,’ Sherlock said doubtfully. Personally, he thought the idea of body parts was brilliant (actually, truly brilliant, he would be amazed if John ever did anything like that for him) but he saw John being less than delighted. In fact, he saw John vomiting at the sight of the tongue, gazing in horror at the teeth and fainting clean away when Sherlock tried to tap dance with a pair of severed feet.
John could feel himself blushing but cleared his throat, saying as jovially as he could, ‘thank you. Mate.’
Sherlock stopped in front of a door and turned, making sure John was still with him. When he saw that he was, he smiled and opened it up.
‘Midnight. Just past, actually.’ John could almost feel Sherlock smiling down at her, love sparkling in his eyes, and in his voice. ‘Your sibling is almost ready to arrive, though, so I thought I’d wake you.’
Sherlock sighed and stroked John’s hand gently. ‘But they will, John. I can’t keep being seen out with you, not the way we are. We look far too…’
‘Busy.’ Sherlock replied shortly. He had always hated Morag; she took constant delight in getting him in trouble and preventing him from having any fun. Apparently it was dangerous to dance on the roof at midnight, or to test uranium in his lab, or to bribe the servants to bring in body parts with the food supplies.
He doesn’t notice that John’s pressed him against the wall until his head clashes against a metal pole with a hollow
Sherlock wasn’t quite sure who leaned in first, but somehow they ended up locked in an embrace, John pressed against the living room wall, spoon digging into Sherlock’s back, lips connecting the two of them in bright, heated light as Sherlock’s world imploded around him, walls crashing, cities burning, and John Watson taking over his entire brain for the rest of his life-
John nodded, still thinking about Sherlock. Obviously it was horrible to have a parent die, but would it traumatise a clever little boy like Sherlock more than the nanny incident? Sherlock had been in the palace when it happened but…it didn’t seem right.
‘You’re not boring.’ The boy mused, leaning back in his chair, and John felt a brief spark in his chest: the boy had said he was not boring, and no one ever said he was not boring. ‘I might as well…if I want to stop being bored…what’s your name?’
He didn’t even know the boy’s last name, he hadn’t even touched him, and he already felt giddy with everything about him.
‘Have you ever done this before?’ Sherlock could barely manage to get the words out. John wasn’t surprised; the younger boy was rock hard, a pearly drop of precome dripping from his slit.
The crowd screamed even louder and cameras flashed; John’s eyes, which were open, were soon blinded, though he caught sight of Mycroft having a miniature meltdown in the corner.
Sherlock slipped through the door to the nursery. Lestrade was fast asleep in one of the chairs and Sherlock smirked, half-debating taking pictures, but he decided it was slightly perverted and walked past it to the cribs.
if Sherlock was going to have his heart broken, because John had been breaking his heart since they’d met and this kiss, the best kiss of Sherlock’s life, was
‘I’m always right.’ John smirked. Sherlock laughed again, giddy with joy and relief and happiness, and said, ‘we both know I’m the clever one.’
Indeed, the illegitimate children of King William Henry Siger Richard were retreating, sending a last wave at the crowd. John leaned forwards as he spotted a shadow behind the curtain; it was twitching.
‘Dad.’ John groaned. The balcony doors still hadn’t opened, but he was eager to see them. He wondered if Prince Edward or Prince Sherlock would be next to the King. Probably Sherlock, he decided.
'How could I not be here?' Sherlock murmured hoarsely, and John almost laughed, because he couldn't believe it, that he was back with Sherlock after such a long time apart. 'I can't believe it-'
he’s looking for, and therefore cannot find it. He starts Uni with a heavy heart, sure he won’t find whatever he was looking for buried in books and lab equipment-
Jacob fought to get down, sprinting at his father and jumping into his arms. ‘I’m best!’ He crowed, and Sherlock smiled and whispered, 'yes you are, my little genius.'
John stood up, shaking his head. ‘No. No, that can’t be right. He’d have told me.’ Greg was looking at him with what could only be pity. ‘John, mate-‘
‘I know, I’m sorry. After Sherlock threw me out…I swear, I’m not really with him, I just didn’t have anywhere else to go, and I’m so good at being a criminal…it’s no excuse. I’m sorry. I heard the gunshot, I’m assuming you killed Morag?’
‘I know,’ Hamish replied, voice hoarse. ‘Your names are too pretentious for you not to be related.’ He paused. ‘My name isn’t Hamish.’
‘The Holmes’s are the richest royal family in the world,’ Sherlock said quietly. ‘We have the most land, the most subjects, the most money, the most resources. My great-great-grandfather, King Thomas V, built Buckingham and it is widely recognised as the best and most expensive residence in the world.’
Sherlock and Irene had been inseparable since she had arrived at the palace the September before his father died. She had apparently been sent there to try and encourage Sherlock to be more aristocratic and live up to what an heir should be (and, though nobody said it, to help him get over John) and Sherlock had been outraged when he had been informed. ‘I’m going to be stuck with a snobbish, arrogant noble?’ He had cried. ‘But- but- but they’ll be boring! They’ll be over-confident! They’ll probably be a terrible person!’
After that, it’s easy. He dresses, puts a note under the head servant’s door telling him to get out as quickly as possible, and goes outside. Hadrian, his horse, is easy to saddle: Sherlock estimates that he has about half an hour before James realises he’s gone, and Mycroft is about an hour’s ride from him.
When he was brought in through the main set of doors at the front of the palace, which Sherlock had taken him through maybe twice, he was taken immediately to what Sherlock had once called the ‘main conference hall’. On their original tour, all those months ago, it had been a large (extraordinarily large. The size of a hall, even), empty room with chairs stacked to the sides and John had seen no reason to go in there again. Sherlock had said when he first showed it to him that no one ever goes in there, John, unless there’s been a huge disaster. The last time it was used…it was in the days after the Eye massacre. At this point Sherlock had adopted that hard facade across his face that often came when the massacre was mentioned and had moved swiftly on: John had forgotten the room existed.
Silence. It is not a phrase they use, not a phrase many people use, and Sherlock realises that he has almost forgotten what love feels like. He loves Mycroft, he supposes, but it is a love that had evolved into something that doesn’t quite fit the bracket of the word. He loved his family, his first love, Francis, back before he stopped aging (almost three hundred years ago, he realises with a start). He’d thought he loved James.
The image was instantly projected onto the screens surrounding the courtyard; the resulting gasp was ridiculously loud. John swallowed hard but remained stock-still, staring ahead.
John wasn't exactly sexually innocent (he’d lost count of the number of girls he’d got to third with by his sixteenth birthday), but Sherlock’s oral sex was magic compared to anything and everything John ever had, or would, have. It made masturbating seem downright boring; thank god John rarely ever felt the need to get himself off anymore. Sherlock was more than willing to go down on him; John didn’t even need to ask. Sherlock seemed to sense just when John needed it the most.
She looked suddenly serious, eyes shifting and (Sherlock took her hand) her palms were sweating. Instantly Sherlock was alert; something strange and possibly dangerous was going on.
‘We need to go.’ John said instantly, standing up and reaching out his hand to Sherlock. The younger boy smiled and grabbed John’s hand, pulling himself up and turning to Mrs Watson. ‘Please excuse me, Jenny. I am unavoidably required at the palace.’
arms. Sherlock felt that once-unfamiliar feeling in his chest (sort of what he felt for Mycroft, but more intense and with less hatred) and buried his nose in her soft blonde curls, hugging the warm little body tight to him. ‘Hello, Rosie,’ he murmured softly. ‘Shall we talk about Daddy?’
‘John. John. John.’ Sherlock was just repeating his name now, over and over, and John paused, trousers scrunched in his hands, before finally looking up.
‘Good.’ Ellie blushed. John tended to have that affect around people, especially girls: he was renowned for being sporty, academic and polite to everyone, even the younger years. ‘How did- how did your GCSEs go?’
‘What do you want, brother mine?’ Sherlock mimicked, plucking his A string absentmindedly. He had misplaced his bow again, and he was far too comfortable to stand up and look for it. ‘Quickly. I’m incredibly busy.’
Sherlock sighs and stands up, slipping on a gown and walking to the window. James’s horse, Sebastian, is still here, standing quietly next to Hadrian (he names all of his horses after his once-family, as it helps him to remember them), and the snow on the ground looks undisturbed. He must still be in the house, somewhere, lying in wait, ready to-
John led the way up the street, still ignoring the paparazzi trailing after him. He led the way to number 4 (
‘Alcohol’s over there,’ Mike said, his mouth still firmly attached to the girl’s. ‘People everywhere. Don’t bum anyone out.’
‘We go home at the end of August, and then Jim’ll be gone,’ Dick continued. John’s heart sank. ‘So do I.’
‘That’s because you stalk me.’ Sherlock snapped at his brother. ‘And I bet you told Trisha, you gossiping whale-‘
‘I think it’s adorable.’ Jim wiped his mouth, grinning widely at the scowl that seemed permanently fixed to Sherlock’s face. ‘Look at them.
‘Brilliant. Come over here, darling. I’m a huge fan of casual sex, especially when I’m drunk.’ Victor waggled his eyebrows, and Sarah flicked him off before storming away, out of the door and towards Mary.
‘Not gay,’ John blustered, and Sherlock raised an eyebrow. ‘Right. Well, Victor is a friend. We have this thing where we fuck and he gives me information on heroin.’ On John’s expression, he frowned. ‘Not for me. Well. Not anymore.’
Mycroft sighed, a martyred expression on his face. ‘John, Gregory has requested your presence downstairs. Some sporting event?’
Here, John bent over Mycroft’s shoulder and told him about Sherlock in as low a voice as he could. John told him about Sherrinford and Jim, told him about the plans and the money, but he also told him everything that Irene had been telling him since the previous August. John told him about the smoking and the drugs, the cocaine hidden in his sock drawer, the heroin in the bathroom cabinet. John told him that Sherlock wasn't eating,
John nodded, blinking rapidly. He didn’t know why he was crying, for God’s sake. He hadn’t liked the man much. The feeling had been mutual.
‘I never thought it would be me!’ John looked quite agitated now. ‘You were brilliant, and beautiful, and smart, and your friends were
John nodded, blinking rapidly, and put his head in his hands. 'Why am I crying? I don't understand why I'm crying, Mum, Dad. He was a total prick to-' John took a deep shuddering breath and Harry patted his arm gently. 'I'm sorry, Johnny.' John looked up and noticed her eyes were rimmed with red: Harry had been
He was vaguely aware of someone taking his arm, leading him to Sherlock’s quarters and dumping him in a chair and he could see Sherlock, curled up in his own chair, but they didn’t speak because John couldn’t and Sherlock wouldn’t and now John was thinking about how close Sherlock had come to killing himself and trembling, literally trembling-
Sherlock’s mouth dropped open. Mycroft finally turned to look at him, eyes flashing, and Sherlock realised that he was the first person that Mycroft had told about his homosexuality. Who else would he have told? Mycroft’s closest ‘friend’ was their third cousin, the heir to the estates in Yorkshire, and even if Mycroft had seen him in the last year Sherlock doubted he would share something so personal and with so much potential to do damage with a mere acquaintance.
