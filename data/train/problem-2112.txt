in interrogation than she did from those two big lugs..."
"Nothing too important," he answered mildly, hitching himself slightly to the side as a harried-looking young constable bustled through, loaded down with papers. "Just filling time, really."
Are you okay?"
Brewster's affable, kindly expression slipped just a bit, and his eyes flickered to one side.
"An impressive claim," Anna said, chuckling. "So why'd you put on such a bad accent, on those first few dates of ours—you know, when we were quoting Kevin Kline at each other, and all?"
. Can you stand?"
"All right," Greg said softly. Now that they were close, they didn't have to strain to whisper across the room. "Broken, you think?"
? Really? Like he's some sort of wild, savage beast?"
"What is it? You require medical attention, right now!"
I haven't got my head together
"Same here," he grinned. "You're a sight for sore eyes, love. So beautiful."
Her wide smile threw amused creases around her eyes, and followed him out as he hurried away to deposit himself on a bench near the main doors.
John tensed under Greg's hand, and a split second later the sound of his phone's text alert trilled. It seemed loud as a scream, echoing in the closely walled space. Wincing, John pulled it from his pocket and looked down; standing so near, Greg could see the message as John read it:
"More, or less, relaxing than micromanaging a third-world coup?" asked John, raising an eyebrow in disbelief at the thought that
He rode through eight stops before his internal monologue threatened to spill out in the form of venomous critique directed at everyone within spitting distance; at the ninth he stalked off and returned to the surface to avoid temptation. The

would be more than enough—and he'd worked so hard to reassure Sherlock of the same, once it had become unexpected reality—that the thought of proving himself wrong was almost too much to bear. He began to fear that the restlessness would make itself apparent to his partner, showing through his skin like a bruise, contaminating his every word and action. The evidence would surely be obvious, if John allowed these thoughts to gain purchase.
Sherlock shrugged minutely. Conversations like this made his skin crawl, even after all this time. Emotional confessions were simply not his area.
John considered that gravely, staring across at the static line of light at the entrance to the little cellar room. Might knowing they had a police detective on their hands change their treatment of him?
brings it up, no worries there."
Brian wore a crisp and well-tailored navy suit, his fine white button-down paired with a sumptuous-looking green silk tie. By contrast, Anna felt dowdy and underdressed in her fuzzy cable-knit jumper and jeans. She'd heard him say "meetings", but it hadn't even occurred to her to think of what that meant, before she'd already stepped into the cab with him and it was too late to change.
The vague possibilities of escape seemed hazy, indistinct. John jerked his drooping head upright with a start. "Don't fall asleep," he muttered, an admonishment to his companion as well as himself.
"So much to look forward to," she murmured absently. A short silence followed; before Greg could find more to say, she cleared her throat, and her next words were bright and energetic. "Well, the turkey won't baste itself, and it's high time I get my sweet potatoes started! I'll get you to Anna now; she's probably eager to have you back. You take good care of yourself, Greg, all right?"
Continuing northward towards the river, Sherlock considered what other stops might need to be made on this impromptu memory-altering tour.
Shaken, Sherlock lowered the crystal as Anna and Lestrade came back in to serve dinner. His skin suddenly felt too small, somehow, and his throat was tight; he was painfully aware that if any one factor had changed, the man seated at his side would never have received the confession of his sentiment, and would most certainly not have brought himself to admit reciprocal feeling. Recalling the tension and animosity that had been so frequent between them since his return, he doubted the likelihood that the situation could have improved much on its own. He and John had actually been interrupted in the middle of a vicious little row, on that afternoon in September—John had snatched up the files for Lestrade and stomped downstairs with them to get away from Sherlock, and had certainly not planned to bring guests upstairs.
"Well," said John, reaching out to finger the lapels of Sherlock's dressing gown, "if you're sure I can't convince you to come along..."
"Ah yes,
"Mm, yes. Some of them are."
The rational, honest side of him shouted frantically inside his head as he continued chatting, but he could find no opening to pull the casual, lighthearted conversation around, no way to force the truth past his smiling teeth.
The blond laughed and turned his attentions to Greg, meeting the man's defiant glare with vicious amusement. He spoke again, and this time John heard a definite air of menace in whatever he was threatening—he drawled the unmistakable word
John gently put his hands in place and waited for Greg to settle himself; the little he could see of the older man's profile turned toward the still-silent door to the next room, assessing. After a moment Greg faced forward once more, deliberately raising his right forearm to his mouth, and then nodded his readiness.
John was shocked into stillness as the impassioned declaration sank in. Sherlock, too, seemed taken aback at his own vehemence; he briefly tightened his arms around John's torso and took a few deep breaths before quietly changing the subject.
, aren't I?" She seated herself, pulling a wrapped sandwich from her small shoulder bag, and they grinned together.
Squinting uncharitably at his new surroundings, Sherlock found himself on Goldhawk in Shepherd's Bush.
"Oh—are you sure?"
"Nah, I got mine back in one piece," Greg replied, shutting the door behind himself. "The arsehole who nicked it on the Tube—I think Sally and Sherlock put the fear of God into him, frankly."
"Ah. And have you managed to find anything?" Mycroft pointedly looked him up and down, and John crossed his empty arms defensively.
There was something in the older woman's voice—appraisal, or amusement at his nervous babbling? He couldn't quite get a read on it, but he thought she sounded fairly pointed as she replied, "I'm sure the boys and I will start getting plenty of photographs in a few weeks. Won't we?"
Now, the anticipated loneliness stings already.
Not yet.
"But the rest
Sally had paused in the office doorway, reaching her arms high overhead and gripping the top of the doorframe; as he approached she dropped the stretch and quickly stepped aside to let him pass. Rather than sweep on by, though, Sherlock found himself drawn to pause alongside her, in the space just beyond Lestrade's office door.
I tell my friend.
stares he regularly took from Sherlock...but Greg got the general idea, nonetheless.
"Huh? Oh. That'd be Old Floyd. Some kind of authority figure in the local homeless community, I gather. I've never met him, myself, but Sherlock meets up with him now and again. It's one of the ways he always knows what's going on."
Sherlock felt a small frown furrow his own brow.
"Sorry, boss," Sally's strident voice said in response. "Come on, lean on me, I've got ya. You're all right."
"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm

"If you're sure."
She looked at him sidelong, making a clear effort to tolerate and support his enthusiasm. The ranks of antique mounted dog heads, however, obviously did not strike her fancy. She actually went a bit green after meeting the glassy eyes of the bulldog, and strode past it with determination; Sherlock led her quickly on past the canines and across to a tall display case he particularly enjoyed.
At last, he cleared his throat to speak.
"Or both," Mycroft agreed. "It's a simple enough solution to your problem, unless you feel the desperate need to infuse the occasion with your typical excess of sentiment."

Sherlock held a large sip of hot coffee on his tongue, letting the sweet bitterness suffuse his mouth as he allowed his thoughts to skitter back to the sparking, slow confusion of the night before.

There was no landmark moment.
"Twelve hours."

The matching up of names and descriptions to the subtle tells John exhibited was nothing too difficult, not after having spent so long in continual study. But, although Sherlock had, as always, succeeded in distinguishing and defining John's emotions, true understanding remained frustratingly out of reach.
"Sorry! Had to get away," Sarah replied, a little breathlessly. "Jenny won't give me a moment's peace; all she wants to do is natter on about how I should consider hiring her brother's new business for our cleaning contract. It's driving me

"Sherlock?"
He released a deliberate breath and looked over, saving one more image of John's gentle face gazing at him against the backdrop of the sunlit skyline, and filing it away for reference.
going out." Sherlock capped his pen and stood, glancing blithely down at the ruined trousers visible beneath the hem of his dressing gown. "These were still on the top of the basket, and they're warmer than my pyjama bottoms anyway." He turned his gaze up to John just in time to witness an eye-roll of fairly epic proportions.
While Anna sat smiling at that comment, Sally leaned back on the sofa and continued, "I dunno. Meeting the family's not necessarily so serious, is it? I don't think either of us are the type to tie ourselves down, not long-term. I mean, it's nice while it lasts, but I haven't got

Another shift:
time he'd scathingly assessed a stranger's personal habits on the Tube, three people had filmed him on their mobiles and posted it online. Notoriety did have its disadvantages.
"You're not worried about the things, though. If you were, I'd be catching you fondling the books and knick-knacks, not stroking the doorframes. So you can go ahead and laugh at me for picking up mystic tendencies from my yogis, but I'm convinced you're feeling a connection to the home itself."
"I know." They gazed off into the kitchen and drank together, letting those words sink in; then Sherlock murmured, "I sometimes suspect he's jealous of you for having known me longer."
They were family, the three of them.
"Be glad he's not here right now, to hear himself being analysed. Don't think he'd take too kindly to that," Sally pointed out, interrupting his brief fugue of realisation. "Pretty sure he'd call
The quiet here felt oppressive, and Greg couldn't help but lower his voice to a whisper. "John. I'm not loving this."
He shook his head, already stepping behind them to take the pull-handle for Anna's case. "It's no more than I expected," he chuckled. "Welcome back, Anna. Are we ready to get down to the baggage claims, or do you two need another minute?"
. And all from—?
"So, why?"
There was a long pause. Anna waited for her friend to continue speaking, or to return to the living room; when neither of these happened, she made a frustrated sound in her throat and got up to follow.
Martha Hudson answered Greg's knock on Wednesday evening with a delighted coo. "Oh, Gregory, John mentioned you might be by! Come in, come in! You'll catch cold in all this damp, standing about outside with your coat open like that."
Sherlock hesitated. He looked down at the box in his own arms, which bore postage labels marking it received from Chicago. "Out with what?" he muttered, distracted.
"It's not as if this is taxidermy for entertainment's sake," Sherlock protested. "It's a tangible, physical record of species as history. Just look; how else might one study the wing extension and specific musculature of the Eurasian Eagle Owl up close, frozen in time? Or, over here: the various breeds of domestic dog common in the twenties and thirties—a fascinating visual example of artificial selection in breeding. See how remarkably

There was a long silence. "That...is not the sort of question I'd expected you to ask," answered Lestrade at last. "I'm—okay. It's good to be back on the job properly. I still get sore pretty easily, but that's a bit better every day. And aside from that, well. I wouldn't say everything's peachy, but I've felt worse."
"Left shoulder hurts like hell. Dislocated, probably. They coshed me over the head at least once, and my guts feel a bit scrambled."
"Impressive! Well, if anyone was ever going to be able to tame that man, it could only be someone with your particular brand of determination."
, to speak these words now: words he couldn't have imagined ever giving voice, when last the faces of the Runnell girls looked out from the sitting room wall.
"Not often. If there's something he needs watched, where just one or two helpers won't do...or, if he needs to gather word of mouth from all over the city, fast..."
"Thank bloody Christ," he wheezed. "Not that this is all that much better."
They wasted no time in beginning the half hour cab ride towards the destination Sherlock had chosen, but a spot of traffic extended that to a little over forty minutes. As they crept onwards through the city in a solid line of vehicles, Anna amused herself by pointing out various pedestrian passers-by.
"It was a great day, really!" Mindful of the busy atmosphere on the other end of the line, he summarised the case and its satisfying conclusion as he flipped through the pages of old photographs. The album was one he'd sat and perused with Anna's narration, during his Chicago visit, and he imagined her curled on the seat beside him to listen.
John reminded himself, panting as he backed off to lean against the wall, sitting on his heels.

Quirking up an eyebrow, Sally opened her folder and began to read off the basics of the crime. "Eliza and Justine Runnell, sisters aged fifteen and eleven, found dead in a school basement in 2003..."
He stared at the closed door after she left, stunned and thoughtful, until Jenny buzzed from the front and reminded him it was time to call in his next patient.
"At least another hour or two; Greg said he might be able to get out of work a little early, today. Why?"
Intrigued by the scene playing out in his mind, the detective hardly registered the movement going on around him; he tuned out the auditory distractions completely. Objectively, of course, his eyes remained open, and so he saw Anna enter the room, loaded down with stacked dishes; he saw John eagerly jump into action to help set the table; but he let it all drift past his field of vision, unconcerned. When a place setting appeared on the mat in front of him, it simply gave him a new set of data points upon which to focus. He did so, with interest.
, you're going to need to get changed, so you should really go do that, now."
." The sound caught and scratched in Sherlock's throat; he cleared it with a quick sip of tea and tried again. "No. Not—not particularly. I'd thought—perhaps there was—" Words threatened to fail him once more, and he gestured impatiently with his free hand to spur himself on. "Something I'd failed to do. Or not done well enough, as a romantic partner."

"It's—your brother, sir." Still reticent. Amy so rarely is.
"Of course, sir."
We worried together over silence down the hall; when they emerged, I'm not sure which of us was more relieved.
That instability had been a weakness that had nearly crippled him, thrown him out of his comfort zone just when things had begun to go sideways. He'd been forced to take far more of the man's support than he'd intended, and he could only be thankful that Brewster was one of those rare, trustworthy people for whom generosity and fairness came easily.
Brian laughed and quipped, "Take my advice, don't ever jump to conclusions! I live my life under the assumption that Fran is pretty much
He considered remaining behind out of sheer stubbornness, but abandoned the idea by the time Lestrade had reached the upper landing. As he stood, the DI's gravelly voice floated down from above.

John lifted a brow, shifting weight onto his heels as he processed the response. "That's a new one. Care to explain?"
. Yeah, so what?"
Blondy chuckled, saying something to the man behind Greg that made his stance shift and his grip tighten. Then, flicking the knife open with a
John nodded, feeling the tickle of Sherlock's curls pressed against his nape as he forced a response past the lump in his throat. "Sure, we can go together. At least I won't have to answer any more questions. We should go out afterwards and get me a new mobile, as well..."
"I'm pretty sure it wasn't about his
John was stunned speechless for a moment; his crossed arms slipped apart and dropped to his sides. After a few slow, disbelieving blinks, he took a different tack. "You do know why we're
Alone once more, John moved in the opposite direction, intent upon revisiting the candle vase he'd earmarked for Miriam. As he went, he replayed the highlights of the encounter with a faint sense of bewilderment. Before long, he remembered the book he'd been given to purchase; pausing, he read the words embossed in gilt on the fine ochre-coloured leather of its binding:
A more impulsive man might have been driven to retire for the evening, to take the situation in hand. It was tempting...but it was also barely past nine, and he knew he still carried too much restless energy from his day to be truly satisfied with what he could do on his own. Expelling a long, loud breath, Greg dragged fingers through his hair and willed himself to calm.
There was no answer from the silent flat. He was still searching for one within his whirling thoughts as he slipped into sleep, exhausted.
"Oh? No, can't say as I have," he replied, scraping up a last smear of syrup and licking his fork clean before passing his dishes across to her. "How big is 'giant', then?"
The box he grabbed was far smaller than all the others Anna had sent him, and when he brought it out into the light he saw that it lacked the international labelling to which he'd become accustomed. Its return address had been water-damaged beyond legibility; only a piece of packing tape had protected his own name and address from a similar fate.
Preparations for the holiday have all been made, and there's nothing left to be done. There's plenty of time, however, for Sherlock to amuse himself.
unexpected."
Sherlock had to lean over her lap a bit to clearly see the girl she'd indicated. "Shagging her professor, obviously," was his dismissive verdict.
The plane touched down about thirty-five minutes late, having been inexplicably delayed in a circling pattern long after the safety belt sign had blinked on. This time, Anna kept a sharp eye out for surprises as she strode purposefully away from the customs line. No warm, strong arms flung themselves about her shoulders, and no startling burr-edged voice husked unexpectedly at her ear—it was admittedly a
At that, thankfully, John seemed to regain his common sense somewhat. Blinking up at Greg's worried expression, he allowed Greg to pull them backwards a pace towards the nearest wall.
A friendly question from the cabbie startled her out of her rapt attention. "Long visit, eh?"
"I'll just get you that coffee," she said quietly, and turned to go.
"Maybe I'm just a genius, babe," grinned Liz. "Come here. Sit
John had looked for normal. He'd tried. He'd even gritted his teeth and braved the hated crowds at Harrods for an afternoon, remembering the types of things that Miriam had enjoyed browsing. But nothing had struck his fancy; it all seemed too familiar, too presumptuous, too commercial, too trite. Nothing John found was
"Firstly: if you're cold, turn up the heating. Or lay a fire, if you like. I know you prefer that all the mundane details of actual human existence simply be dealt with on your behalf, but sometimes you've just got to take initiative. Secondly: you
"You'd know all about those, I presume."
Honestly, with all of the other preparations looming ahead, Anna had expected furnishing the flat to be one more stressful chore to bear. But as she itemised her various ideas for the rooms to her new friends, she was surprised at the giddy excitement she was feeling.
name out of it, once he figures out what you're up to! Anyway, the pen-pals he's had lately have been more harmless crazies than lovelorn pensioners."
Mycroft considered his answer briefly. "Tedious. Mundane, saccharine. Excruciating. Yet...oddly restorative."
"Okay," he sighed, getting up on his knees and turning to approach his friend, "sit up straight, facing away from me. Ever had this done before?"
Greg's an
it. Turn around."
By the time they got through two-thirds of the second wine bottle, they'd delved into discussing the rooms in which they sat, and future plans for them. This flat was still new to Greg, nearly as much as it was to Anna, and it had a hodgepodge, half-finished feel to it. Many of the furnishings Greg had transplanted from his old flat seemed a bit lonely and small, marooned amongst still-bare walls and open spaces, even though the rooms weren't all that much larger on the whole.
threat.
Invariably, John would pretend he had been woken, mumbling and yawning before rolling into a comfortable position; almost certainly, Sherlock knew it to be an act. They never spoke of it.
in friends, before these two women unexpectedly reentered my life.
"Meanwhile," Mycroft blithely continued, "Father enjoys the holiday season for its annual indulgences, above all. He takes great pleasure in shirking his doctors' recommendations during these celebrations."
"Well, it's all quite exciting, isn't it?" asked Charlotte. There was that unidentifiable lilt in her voice, again. He wished he were there in person; he'd always been far better at reading people when he could watch their faces.
The estate sale was being held on a rambling old property in the general area of Watton's Green, northeast of London—nearly an hour's drive in the little car John had hired for the day. He hoped the excursion would turn out to be worthwhile, although his optimism was heavily tempered by the knowledge that anything he did find would likely be unsuitable, or far beyond his price range. At this point, however, he'd dithered over choosing gifts long enough that he would have to settle on
Upstairs, Sherlock found Lestrade in what was apparently being set up as a guest room. He paused in the doorway, taking in the details: a double bed, recently delivered and still lacking bedding; an old cabinet-style record player repurposed as a bedside table; two tall, quaintly mismatched bookshelves that stood mostly empty.
"Did you hear me?"
Who'd be daft enough to love
"All right." Nodding, John gamely accepted the book. He tucked it under his arm to extend his hand. "Good, uh, good seeing you, Mycroft."
"Sherlock," murmured John, reaching out to pull him down. He tasted the rain that gathered upon their lips, mingled with the tang of blood washing from his face and the slightly night-sour flavour of the man's kiss. "Oh, love. I'm okay, my love, we're okay," he spoke into Sherlock's suddenly desperate mouth, clinging to him, heedless of the cold rain beginning to soak them both through.
Greg's interest turned to mild confusion as he pulled a single item from the box. Unwrapping it revealed a figurine of coloured resin, about a handspan tall: an old stone church, complete with a quaint tower and round-arched windows. It was beautifully detailed; the moss-covered roof over the nave, the contrasting patterns of the stonework, and the bright blue of the doors had all been meticulously painted by hand.

"Any idea where we are?"
sorts of gifts possibly be appropriate, for people who had raised men like Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes?
"Brian, I've got no excuse for answering like that. I'm sorry. I thought it was your brother, fooling around!"
When he pushed me to tell him about Mum, I realised I hadn't really told anyone else. Who to tell? I'm a cop; chatty girlfriends are hard to come by. Hannah's asking about setting me up on a date—her friend's got a footballer cousin—but...
from her, since, never mind keeping his job.) And after everything in John's life had fallen apart—after he'd spent over a year in mourning and then shambled back into her surgery, severely sleep-deprived and desperate for a way to make some use of himself? She'd had no good reason to hire him back; any doctor with a modicum of common sense would have turned John away, at that point. Sarah had merely asked him to wait two more months to get himself together before coming in for his first shift.
Anna piped up, "Personally, I think that sounds amazing. I haven't had a good filet in a really long time."
A need coalesced in Sherlock's mind, and he made a quick decision. "Would you be amenable to walking awhile?"
"What about?"
in a way that sent a shiver down John's spine.

"How hard did you guys try to make him come along? I hope you didn't
He nodded, absently stroking his jaw with his right hand. "Yeah—picked 'em up yesterday after lunch. Haven't had the chance to get into them, yet; anything important?"
"No? I'd have thought it right up your alley," countered Mycroft; a year prior, it would have sounded malicious, but now John heard a clear undertone of teasing amusement.
"You either want to complain about something, or ask me something. Right?"
John nearly dismissed the man, then and there, just for the colours he wore. With buff shirtsleeves beneath a khaki tweed vest and olive trousers, he certainly seemed nothing like the stuffy embodiment of the British Government. But although it was informal, it was clearly an impeccably tailored ensemble, and this gentleman seemed to hold himself like a poised peacock, gliding among the common folk...

Such a relief, when Sherlock finally called. We made reservations right away; I had Cliff's tux cleaned.
"John," he rasped. "Thank
He nodded, satisfied with his efforts. "I'd best get going. I wouldn't want to keep John waiting..."
Something in that statement didn't make sense to Greg. No, scratch that—a
A quiet warning klaxon sounded in Sherlock's mind as he finished his sentence. He saw the downwards twitch of the brow, and the clenching jaw; his own snapped closed. Had he let his irritation slip out too obviously?
"John's had trouble sleeping. It's improved over the last fortnight, but that's only served to draw my attention to the fact that...I'm experiencing...similar issues."
John closed his eyes and allowed himself a small smile before letting Sherlock help him the rest of the way up.
"...Tests?" Greg managed weakly, still reeling.
But before she could ask, Molly turned to her and shifted the topic abruptly.
"God, Sherlock," whispered John, failing to suppress a tiny shudder at feeling the rush of breath behind his ear. "You don't really mean that?"
I've no excuse. My love wasn't enough.
The firefight was over within three seconds; in the ringing aftermath, John looked up to see familiar figures shoving through behind the small crowd of response officers.
John hopped out promptly, but Greg leaned in and put his hand on Anna's knee when she moved to open the door on her side. "Love, how about you just wait here? Won't be a moment, we'll pop your bags inside and then we can get straight to dinner with no delay."

Between this building and the next behind it, there was even less light; only two wall fixtures were in working order along the entire alleyway. A tall pile of discarded shipping pallets hulked threateningly at one wall, and a little further down a large and battered-looking skip blocked the sight line to one of the closed shops' rear doors.
Neither of those acclimation periods had held quite the excitement and charm of this time, though. And she supposed that was fitting, after all...it would most likely be her last.
It pulled an involuntary gasp from her lips, and she shuddered against the warmth of his body pressed all along her back, speaking in a trembling sigh. "Oh

phone call, which rested in its entirety within a small, securely locked metal box.
Sherlock opened his eyes to meet John's concerned gaze. Swallowing the mouthful of coffee, now only lukewarm against his throat, he lowered the mug he still held before his face. "Yes."
------
"Okay, that's true enough," she laughed. "But you obviously don't feel right, getting rid of it."
Could he?
Sherlock felt the corners of his own lips turn upwards as his glass rang a sweet, clear tone against hers.
"Yeah, well, for a level-headed illuminator, you do a hell of a job keeping yourself in the dark!"
She rinsed and set the last glass carefully aside in the drying rack; when she turned back, Greg had disappeared. His voice came from out of sight in the living room, light and casual. "Yeah, maybe so. I don't remember her mentioning it. Hey—did you maybe want to go furniture shopping, today? If we can leave soon, we should have plenty of time before I have to work tonight."
"Off out?" Ronny asked him, raising his head and tossing the longest bit of his glossy black hair from his face. "Have we pinned down the source of the cash, then?"

"Mm. Sherlock

, Anna-bear."
Rapists, kidnappers, abusers, torturers. Murder in seemingly every form possible...though there was always something new waiting to be witnessed, something awful and unexpected to turn his stomach and make Sherlock hop for giddy joy. Greg took comfort in his work, anywhere he could—the knowledge that each solved case and each convicted perpetrator was one more victory on the side of justice in his city; the faith that his efforts, his long hours, and his frequent bone-deep exhaustion all had the chance to make a difference. He tallied up saved lives and their potentialities against the gruesome images in his head, when he found himself too wound up for sleep.
John watched Sherlock's dark curls dip low in front of him, struck by a surge of affection—a near-desperate need to give himself up to enjoyment, to accept the happiness his partner offered and forget his worries.
It was meant to be a comfort, but hearing it
The quicksilver flashes of potentiality narrowed inwards as Sherlock twisted his glass from side to side.
Sliding, skin on skin, lights out. Sensation: unnecessary. Superfluous.
John checked his watch and nodded. "Yeah, okay."
"Are you all right?" he inquired next. It wasn't really a fit expression of the things Sherlock really wanted to ask, but somehow the only appropriate one. There had been a very limited number of suitable opportunities over the years for him to truly ask John to explain, and he knew from experience that it was considered Not Good to pry, in his typical analytical fashion, when his flatmate was actually experiencing the negative emotions in question.
That was
They reached a wide stairwell, where Sherlock urged him to sit before calling out imperiously for one of the nearby officers. Soon his coat and shoes had been restored to him—the sight of Sherlock kneeling to tie his laces for him made John's throat tighten painfully—and then he was led briskly upstairs and outside into the rain, the arm about his shoulders rigid and trembling.
The man's head snapped up and around—it
His perception still sharpened to an ultra-fine point, Sherlock experienced the celebratory toast as if in slow motion. He observed Lestrade leaning forward to join in, grinning around the table at his friends with an unashamed sparkle in his eyes. He saw John tilt his head toward the older man, parting his lips in a more reserved smile that was no less genuine: it pulled deep, friendly creases into his cheeks as he raised his own wineglass. And, finally, he considered Anna—artistic, loyal, sharp-witted, utterly
"Yeah. Well." The DI had the good grace to look chastened for a second or two, but he couldn't hold back his smile for long.
"No, no; she was right, I wasn't about to make any more progress tonight. I'll sleep on it, come at things fresh in the morning."
Greg's eyes flicked across to John's; the angry bravado had drained from his gaze, and now all John could see was a sick, fearful certainty.
She ate slowly, savouring each sweet bite while she watched him finish up. When he turned off the hob and brought his plate to sit on the stool beside her, she still had half a slice left, cutting dainty pieces and sweeping them through her syrup while he happily dug in.
days off? Next you'll be telling me you build birdhouses in your spare time, or knit hats!"
The leader gestured at the two of them, and snapped out a short command; Blondy answered in a clear affirmative, but before stepping back he delivered a swift punch to the DI's stomach.
He knew that trust was surely a function of their years of acquaintance, and that the respect he accorded the DI as a colleague was justified in measurable terms. Even so, he sensed that there was more to their relationship than the older man's obviously paternal attachment to him, and the mutual comfort of long familiarity. There were few in Sherlock's life to serve as a measure for comparison, and he was frankly glad of it...but Lestrade's manner around him sometimes raised the possibility that their memories stood on unequal footing.
Drink in hand, he noticed that a plate of Mrs Hudson's cranberry scones had been left on the worktop; the stretched cling film stood up higher than the empty plate in two places.
John couldn't lose what he'd built. Life with Sherlock—love, with Sherlock—was
There was another brief silence as John considered this statement. Mycroft replaced the Keats, and strolled around to the opposite side of the long bin; John watched him warily.
"So you made a few assumptions. Got caught up in things. We've all been there," Greg told him.
He and Sherlock weren't really talking much at all about the mechanics of their relationship. They'd achieved a beautiful sort of equilibrium, an ebbing and swelling tide of domestic contentment that had carried them through months of pleasant days and nights. There seemed to be a mutual understanding at play, the two lists upon which they'd tacitly agreed:
"Oh, no, I've heard worse," he assured her, turning to slide two freshly finished slices onto her waiting plate, and then his expression turned devilish. "At least
"But it's okay with you if I want to, right?"
Sarah knew, of course. John had confessed it to her not long after Sherlock's demonstrative reveal to Scotland Yard that June, and while she hadn't already guessed, she'd been unsurprised—almost annoyingly so. Still, John hadn't divulged all that much detail since then about the nature of his partnership with Sherlock; it had always felt as if that would be overstepping one invisible line too many.
By the time Anna rejoined the others near the baggage carousel, it was already in motion, surrounded by a crush of impatient people. Greg had claimed a space for himself near the conveyor; he glanced from his scrutiny of the passing bags to speak over his shoulder as she came near. "Um, I already recognised the two bags with the green trim and passed them to John, but I don't remember what your others are like..."
A little over an an hour later, Greg left for work, reluctant but grinning from ear to ear. Anna watched him through the small bay window, striding off towards Goldhawk Road with a spring in his step. She smiled, sipping her coffee thoughtfully, and twitched the sheer curtain back into place as he moved on out of sight.
Quite some time later, after a prolonged, frustrating struggle, John managed to loosen the knotted nylon rope around Greg's wrists. As the DI pulled his left arm around to the front of his body at last, his involuntary noise was sharp and strangled, but still fairly quiet.
Pursing his lips, Greg nodded. "All right,
"Sort of, yeah!" Anna watched a quick, furtive expression pass over Brian's face. He and Greg were different in many ways, but their faces held eerie similarity: on Greg, she knew that look signalled nervous embarrassment. "But you don't have to go into it now. We've got plenty of time to get to know each other; there's no rush."
Still...Sherlock's insistence upon remaining home, today, had clearly crossed some line in John's expectations. Apparently it wasn't enough to fulfil the myriad concrete requirements of romantic partnership, one on one. Everyone who made any difference (and many who didn't) already knew they were together; belabouring the point served no purpose as far as Sherlock could see—and yet, needless as it was, it appeared that socialising with friends
He couldn't quite keep the disbelief from his voice as he stepped closer. "Mycroft?"
John crossed his legs and continued, "Pity that Antoine was one of the ones killed, really. Sally probably would've got more useful stuff from
She sputtered theatrically into her coffee. "It's not
Brewster began their conversation casually. "So, I saw the news reports online, back in June: alive and kicking." He turned away from a poster depicting the construction of the skyscraper in which they stood, and looked up at Sherlock as if he expected some sort of heartwarming story.
he seemed to want to
"Upon re-examination, I found that my original theory was sound. It simply required a clarification in my testing procedure, to make the data gel," he explained airily, without turning around, as if his rare admission of defeat were so easily erased from memory. "This should be enough proof to obtain a warrant for Mitchell Beaux before tomorrow afternoon. If you hurry, Lestrade, you can bring the killer in well before the new year!"
With that, the three of them moved apart, Lestrade stepping lively in the lead as a gust of chill wind finally made him shiver. Anna started to follow him at a more reserved pace, shaking her head in amusement.
She nodded, smiling again. "Delivered yesterday afternoon, and it chills like a charm. So, how was your week? Nothing so unpleasant, I hope?"
Even working with one mostly useless arm, Greg was able to make far quicker work of John's knots with the advantage of facing them: perhaps only twenty or thirty minutes elapsed while he cursed and picked at the rope. Rubbing gratefully at chafed wrists, John glanced at his watch—half past two in the morning; they'd left the lab at Barts over five hours earlier.
Certainly, their rapport was much improved, of late—but Brian still had trouble remembering which buttons not to press. Greg slipped off the stool, taking a few restless steps into the living room; his shoulders were suddenly tense as he said, "Can you not, please?"
"It was that, or nothing." Greg tried to keep a tight rein on his emotions as he explained. "D'you think I was simply minding my own business, the other night? Out for a nice evening stroll, when the gang we'd been after for a month just
Sitting here, only a few paces away while Sherlock selected memories from the past weeks to rub out of existence...while he deliberately erased people he'd seen, conversations he'd had, and presumably anything else he didn't deem vital to his work...it felt like standing by as witness to an invisible destruction: strange, and disquieting, and somehow eerily beautiful.
I want to hit something
John had anticipated his temper, however, and had held the device securely out of reach as he'd sent an affirmative reply. "Sorry, Sherlock," he'd said, smiling fondly across the booth, "it can't be helped. Sarah gives me leeway every single time we have a case, and in return I take my lumps. At least I got to finish eating this time."
"You're still upset about the abduction, yeah, but maybe you're worried more about why John got us into it. I mean, what you said—that was dead on. I know I should've tried harder to pull him back, but he was on a roll; there was definitely something he was upset about. Had you been fighting?"
"You're my best friend, John," he blurted, before he could rethink the words.
Said meeting was unsurprisingly tedious and redundant, instructing all of the department's inspectors on end-of-year review policies that hadn't changed significantly in the last four years. Afterwards, he shut himself into his office with a fresh cup of coffee and pulled the unfinished review forms from his drawer with a guilty sigh.
"Not so much as you'd think! A lot of the time, he gets
he realised.
"Just so," uttered Mycroft dryly, peering at him over the edge of the book.
The cab pulled to a stop before the flat in Shepherd's Bush; Sherlock stepped out along with his companion, and as he made payment he saw movement ahead at the door. Their excursion had run long enough into the afternoon that Lestrade had already returned home from work, and now he was stepping out in his shirtsleeves to meet them on the front walk.
"I'm okay," said John, and he smiled, sending the sleuth's mind from its startled stillness into overdrive once again.
Grinning, he answered her, "I'll get on that straight away, love. Why don't you unpack this file of yours, and you can show it to me while we eat?"
John had to give him credit for taking the initiative. It was frustrating and a little unnerving that his aching head was still so muddled, leading him to ask such slow-witted sorts of questions; he appreciated that Greg, at least, seemed to retain most of his focus. Watching the man's slow struggle with a frown, he offered, "If we turn back to back, maybe I can help with it. But it's likely to hurt you more while I'm trying..."
Sherlock slipped the phone back into his pocket, frowning. The reply he'd sent had been distinctly ill-matched to the message he'd received, but he'd had to expend considerable effort not to write something unpleasant. If Lestrade took this as a moderately confusing dismissal, at least he was unlikely to find it insulting.
Greg got the sense that John was stunned—as for himself, he felt like the bottom had dropped out of his stomach—but there was no time to share a reaction over it. In the seconds that followed, their attention was necessarily focused on more pressing matters.
"And you know exactly how to sweet-talk an old woman. Flatterer."
"Truly, still?"
It wasn't as if John had ever been a consistently social man; he made noises about civil niceties, but when left to his own devices he reverted to self-indulgent isolation nearly as consistently as Sherlock did. He had a far-ranging network of acquaintances, whom he inaccurately termed "friends" even though most of them were inattentive at best, and a few were even openly antagonistic. (Those conditions actually seemed to be mutual in a number of cases.) If he'd made himself available to receive adequate emotional support from any of
Sherlock smiled at the immediacy of the reply. "Sorry, but I can't wait around for Lestrade any longer," he said, turning from the window.
"Oh, oh, do that one," she requested, elbowing him lightly to draw his attention out the window.
And Mr Dwyer? Landed yet?"
Stubborn; maddeningly high-minded; holds grudges like
He smacked the folder open across the desk to quickly hide his comments on Ronny from view. "Oi! None of your business, back off..." The spread of photocopied photos clipped in at the front of the file caught his eye, and he trailed off in confusion. The two young victims pictured looked distinctly familiar. "Sherlock? Did I give you this?"
(See the end of the chapter for

Greg looked down at the image of the woman on his computer screen, tracing his eyes almost hungrily over her familiar features. His mind was filled at once with a dizzy echo of the sinking, desperate feeling, in that final minute—the press of the knife at his belly and the sudden certainty that he wouldn't make it out alive...
"I can handle the pain, John." Without hesitation, he was already shifting and turning, willingly presenting his bound wrists.
John moved the wineglass from his own place to Sherlock's. "I'm not saying you have to load up your plate, or put on an act...just, she likes you an awful lot. It'd be nice if you were present," he reasoned softly, reaching over to retrieve and pour the fourth glass for himself.
grade A relationship material, is it?"
He chose not to answer that. "Undoubtedly our mother will be so enamoured with the novelty of your presence that your choice of gift will be entirely immaterial."
Anna nodded, chuckling. "Don't worry, I know you've grown out of refusing to care of yourself." As she ran warm, soapy water into the sink, a thought floated up to the surface of her mind, popping into her awareness as delicately as the bubbles.
"So, out with it then," Lestrade said, marking his presence without turning. He'd set his box on the bare mattress and begun digging through its contents, his back to the door as he chose out newspaper-wrapped items and set them aside.
"Right. Right," Greg mumbled in reply, his voice starting off a bit fuzzy as well. "Wouldn't want 'em coming back and catching us napping, would we?"
"Okay, sorry, I have to hang up, now! Three weeks, baby, just three...more...weeks."
enough yet to resume weekly posting on this one, but I will try to put something up every other week, at least, for the next little while. Possibly on random days. :)
Her curls bounced in an abrupt nod, and she left without looking back.
—Sherlock had been tempted to snatch the phone from John's hands and return a message informing her that she should see to disciplining Dr Bressler, who'd clearly been taking advantage of every possible excuse to skive off work frequently. Nobody's daughter could possibly be
"I'm all right. Can't complain, you know. Work's been good, and the new flat's getting settled..." He trailed off, feeling awkward.

! Liz and I were so busy dealing with that the whole weekend that I didn't even realise I hadn't texted you at all. I'm really sorry."
"I'm angry, yes. You've got
It seemed to Anna as if the air had become thick between them, charged with electricity, the distance separating them both reduced and painfully enhanced. For a long minute, neither of them could find anything to say, although their eyes spoke eloquently.
, and none of the rest mattered...what would you do? Don't think. Honest answer,
Liz said something in response, but it was muffled by the spoon sticking out of her mouth. "Sorry," she tried again after a bit of swallowing, "being the voice of reason makes me hungry. Peanut butter banana sandwich, with marshmallow fluff—want some?"
Meanwhile, Greg had remained on grudging desk duty while his dislocation healed, handling a series of routine investigations during which his team had run all of the legwork for him. He'd complained to John of boredom, of course, but the protests had seemed half-hearted. John thought he might understand that, actually. The bland normalcy of his own part-time work at the surgery, once he'd returned to it, had seemed oddly reassuring and safe, where once upon a time he'd spent many of those hours desperate to get away. He knew it would balance out, eventually—that his irrepressible desire to "see the battlefield", as Mycroft had so delicately phrased it, wouldn't stay away for long. Likewise, Greg's inquisitive, purposeful nature was gradually returning to the fore, and once he'd received clearance to stop wearing the shoulder sling he would be ready to take on his usual sorts of cases once more.
"Congratulations, girl," hummed the stranger, in a tone of frank approval.
"Yes," Sherlock confirmed, in the falsely patient voice he used to signify the blindingly obvious.
"I'll stay home tomorrow, all right? And—thank you."
haven't you
"How was work?"
"Hm?" Anna blinked and turned her head to look into the next room, where her best friend lounged on the sofa.
He brought his mouth close to her ear, and when he spoke her shiver had nothing to do with the cold. "I rather thought so."
Greg sighed and frowned at the file he was trying to study, trying to rub the growing ache from his forehead with the fingers of his free hand. Unfortunately, a fresh wave of sharp words from the opposite end of the conference room made it clear that his efforts weren't likely to succeed. Sally Donovan and Phil Anderson had gone five rounds already on the trace evidence that had been pulled from the counterfeit bills, and they didn't show signs of coming to an amicable agreement anytime soon.
The more open and airy style of decorating was very much in line with Anna's old life, oddly enough, and she'd been perfectly comfortable with it then; her home in Columbus with David had boasted high, skylit ceilings and great expanses of clean beige carpeting. But since then, she'd spent months in the cozy mess of the little Chicago house. Surrounded so closely with her own things and the things her old friend Andy had left, and later Liz's belongings as well, she'd become happily accustomed to clutter. It seemed odd to have so much less of it, now.
what that impatient prat's got up to." John tapped out a quick text message while shuffling through the various papers and notes left near the workstation.
They breathed together through their respective hurts, until Greg shook himself and moved to stand. "Thanks, John. Next order of business," he muttered hoarsely. "Checking the room."
Proper clearance was required, naturally. Mr Holmes' raised eyebrow spoke volumes. Still, he gave grudging approval.
Sally Donovan gave a perfunctory knock as she opened Greg's office door and popped her head in. "Sir?"
"I suppose, then," John eventually said, throwing an aimless glance over his shoulder, "for Mum, the Art Nouveau candle vase; for Dad, something alcoholic. Or, sweet?"
Sherlock stepped out into the hard grey glare of the sunshine outside New Scotland Yard, feeling oddly lighter than he had when he'd gone in just minutes earlier.
had resulted in pressure on Sherlock to escort John to the Yarders' pub night, or the surgery's staff luncheon! Even the brunch that Mummy had arranged in honour of Mycroft's forty-fifth birthday had been easy to sidestep, given the right excuses.
Liz shook her head in fond frustration. "You
"Are you mad?" I ask her.
Sherlock took a deliberate pace backwards and did his best to regain his customary detached expression. It felt slippery and unstable on his face, his lips too firm and his eyes too wide, but he held it in place by main force as he scrabbled internally for an answer to the question.
"I understand it's short notice, Sally, but if you haven't got plans for tomorrow evening, John and I are hosting a gathering at 221B. Please, consider yourself quite welcome to join us."
Granted, the physical signs were minimal in this case, and there was a
chance his observations were off; but he was fairly sure of himself in this, his own constructed science. He'd most certainly seen the echoes of regret, delight, sadness, and anger...
"That's my Greg," she said approvingly, standing to take her plate to the sink; the wine glasses and dessert plates from the night before were still waiting there for her attention. "And you've
Sherlock gave a tiny sideways twitch of his head.
"Phenomenal, I promise. The stuff on the menu's not too shabby, either, from what I hear," he told her, winking.
"No, I know you are. And it's not just her, it's Greg! He asked. If 'friend' isn't an accurate term for Anna, in your opinion, I've got no idea what you consider
"Yeah, well. It's—" Turning, he saw Anna coming down the stairs, her steps slowing as she met his eyes, trying to determine what she might be interrupting. "It's fine," he continued, rubbing a hand down his face and trying hard to banish the rush of unpleasant feelings. "Don't worry about it, yeh? So. Why'd you call today? I know it wasn't to hear about my breakfast."
of things are changing, lately."
When John reached 221 and stepped inside, he found Sherlock waiting at the upper landing, holding a cup of tea.
"Well, I took an early day to get caught up on this mess," Lestrade grunted, stooping to pick up one of the cardboard boxes stacked by the wall. "If you came looking for conversation, you'll have to follow me upstairs."
Wine open, she grabbed the box of crackers off the worktop—the cheese plate had been getting a bit low—and returned to the living room in time to hear Molly finish.
"So sorry, Mr Bond, but I'll never tell you my master plan," she said in a comically villainous accent, as she brought the phone to her ear.
She threw a friendly glance to Sherlock as she passed him, but made no further comment until she had made a quick substitution of the discs in her CD changer, setting the new selections to shuffle. "Dinner should be ready in just a few minutes," she announced, then left the room once more.
"Happy Tuesday, Anna! Um, sorry I didn't stay dressed to call you, I was well and truly knackered..."
"Mm. Well, if that's what it takes to take your mind off—
"Big enough that she and Hannah should really have had help getting it inside." She held a soapy glass up to the light, twirling it between her fingers and squinting to check that she'd gotten the last of the dried wine. "They nearly broke one of the carvings, doing it by themselves. I told her she should have at least called
Greg set aside the mug, freeing his hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. "You
Their dinner was lovely, and all the more appreciated for the long wait leading up to it. They talked and laughed together for over two hours, dining with indulgent slowness: sharing appetisers, and drawing out the meal with wine and dessert. When the waiter came with their sweet kulfi and strong coffee, John ordered a meal to carry home to Sherlock, thus giving them the excuse to stretch the pleasant evening even further...but eventually, Sherlock's takeaway arrived, and they migrated outside to say their goodbyes.
. Clearly, a fine addition to the family! Teach this lunkhead a thing or two, won't you, Anna? Right, so I'll get your meals started, and leave you two to talk..." With that, the charming restaurateur nodded happily and bustled away.
of a time getting it into my flat! Almost snapped a cherub’s head clean off. Theo was out of town; just bad timing, I guess, that there were no strong men available to press into service."
even joined the force?"
"Will do."
"Hi guys, Happy New Year! I hope you both had a good day!" Anna wiped her hands on a towel as she emerged from the kitchen, looking slightly flushed and quite pleased; her expression was an obvious confirmation as to the source of Lestrade's good humour.
Brewster gave a hearty laugh and moved on to the next exhibit.
anything trying to drag him out the door, John!"
—and somehow found a quick response. "Maybe I should bring along a bottle for you and me to share. Troop reinforcements, as it were."
Greg didn't have much to dispute John's tirade. He'd witnessed similar behaviour from his wayward consultant numerous times, over the years, and it had certainly made him feel angry and protective. Still, none of that quite measured up to the possessive fury of John as a boyfriend, apparently.
"You're the boss."
The noise in the background faded quickly away, followed by the sound of a door slamming, and Greg grinned. Obviously she'd run off to talk to him somewhere private: probably Charlotte's bedroom, judging by how fast she'd gotten there.
"I could say the same, John. Estate sales don't quite seem your cup of tea."
!" A few seconds of loud celebration were shared between the brothers, then Ryan said, "Justin. First two weeks of April, think Tiff will be cool?"
"Not particularly." Frowning at the improbable line he had apparently drawn inside his mind, Sherlock pivoted away and continued toward the bridge, his strides lengthening as he went.
more people on his list of unavoidable obligations this year than last. Anna certainly would be no problem—theirs was a fairly casual, low-contact friendship, and he could tell she would genuinely appreciate nearly any small token from him. No, it was the Holmes family who gave him serious pause. Mycroft was a potential issue; John no longer really harboured ill feelings towards him, but he'd done so for years, and they both knew it quite well—and besides, the man was obviously picky and a master of the passive-aggressive comment. Then there were his parents. John had only just met Miriam and Cliff that April, but they'd welcomed him readily and acted as if they'd known him far longer...and now he and Sherlock were obligated to attend the family celebration on Christmas Day, out at the Holmes country home. The very idea of it seemed so against Sherlock's general principles that it was sure to be disastrous, but they were going, and John knew he needed to be prepared with offerings to make up for whatever catastrophes of insult might arise.
John looked much more himself now that he'd eaten; they'd both been quiet for much of his meal, wrapped up in their own thoughts, but it seemed to have been a more restorative period for the doctor than it had been for the detective. He stepped out at Sherlock's heels and looked up to him expectantly, every economical motion of his body communicating attention and eagerness for action.
Greg suddenly found himself worrying about an aspect of things that hadn't really troubled him as of yet. This whole holiday thing—was Mrs Faber really as unhappy about it as Anna and Becky both seemed to think? Was he risking getting off on the wrong foot with his soon-to-be mother-in-law, right from the start?
"Is that it, then? That's your big advice, 'keep it'?"
much correct."
John's smile widened, and he dipped it into the steam of the tea Sherlock had made him. "Had to get my blood pumping," he agreed.
"Yeah?" He squeaked a little on the response, his throat unexpectedly tight, but Becky didn't seem to notice.
"What?"
been in it for good, as far as I hear. Sally told me a story last summer about how Bert had to drag you off a case, because you wouldn't stop to get over your 'flu..."
"You're doing it again."
"Some time...Sherlock, these are the
After another minute's silent work, Sally blew a stream of air upwards across her face to flip away an errant curl. "Pass over that stack next to you, would you?"
It wasn't, of course; the envelope was plain and unremarkable, labelled only with his name and New Scotland Yard's mailing address in simple block printing. All incoming correspondence was scanned six ways to Sunday before coming into the building proper, so Greg didn't hesitate in slicing it open. His rarely-used letter knife was a gaudy old thing of brass and dark wood, one of the few mementoes passed to him upon DI Harwood's retirement; he absently stroked its handle with his thumb as he unfolded and read the terse, unsigned note.
"John, for God's sake..." Ashen and wide-eyed, Sherlock placed shaking hands on John's cheeks, curling forward and touching their foreheads together before pulling away again. "You're
"I'll miss you too—wait, clueless?" The penny dropped, at last, and Anna's eyes widened. "You're not saying..."
"Really, it shouldn't wait," he said through not-quite-locked teeth, and reached for the nearest plausible excuse: "I still haven't picked up a Christmas gift for John. You understand."
"I'm sure Anna's very pleased that she still gets to visit with you."
"Hugh, you know I'd be in here every week if I lived in town. And likely about four stone heavier, as well! Here—I'd like you to meet Anna Clark. She's to be my sister-in-law, in a few months! Anna, this is Hugh Delancey, proprietor of this fine establishment."
"That's amazing," said John instead, exclaiming intermittently from the opposite end of the sofa as he scrolled through the typed notes. "I can't even imagine how you thought of testing
more out there.
. Well, Christmas isn't my favourite really, as far as it goes."
No; it was enough to accept the hypothesis that Lestrade knew things he no longer did, and somehow felt all the more attached to him as a consequence. It was enough to allow Lestrade's presence to be an occasional, if seldom utilised, comfort—to open himself, trusting and vulnerable, and to receive sincere advice in return.
I set my tea aside. "Show me."

"Yeah, Sherlock mentioned that. I can only imagine, with them having wasted over an hour tracking down your phone and chasing its signal all the way to Hackney, only to find a clueless drunk kid? I'll bet they pulled out

from the bedside table near her ear, a momentary precursor to the droning buzz of the alarm clock; by the time the louder sound began, Anna had already rolled quickly over to lie on her back. It took three or four more seconds for the man beside her to stir, and when he did, he lifted himself up on one elbow to reach over her head to the clock. She was ready for the groggy, careful manoeuvre, and took advantage of its predictability to catch him by surprise.
The mention of children suddenly brought to mind the joke Greg had shared with Ronny earlier, and he realised he hadn't thought to check in before leaving Barts. He reached into the breast pocket of his suit jacket—then the pockets of his coat—then, frowning deeply, he patted down his trousers before starting all over again and hoping for a different result.

"And, you've slept very poorly, the last three nights. This is hardly a suitable occasion to leave you unattended. I've gone without before, many a time; I can skip it."
"I heard. Sure,
Sherlock had devised it, then, as a possible means to shed light on a particularly opaque cold case of Lestrade's...but his work at that time had been hindered by distraction. When John had run off to New Zealand with Sarah Sawyer, Sherlock had been left alone for two weeks. Dissatisfied with the thought of taking small cases by himself, bored and dispirited without their stimulation, and unsettled by the awkward tension that had built up in the fortnight following the incident with Moriarty at the pool, Sherlock had practically begged Lestrade for a worthy puzzle to solve. The case he'd received, as it turned out,
In other words, it was nearly intolerable.
With a small frown, he crossed the room to stand opposite Lestrade, depositing his burden.
had disliked me...I'm not sure things could have worked out for him and me. You know?"
"Nah, he couldn't could he? It was the beginning of November."
The older man gave him a look that clearly communicated suspicion.
The door from the hall opened once more, and the counterfeiters' apparent leader stalked in. He was jowly and heavy-set, perhaps a few years older than Greg, with lacklustre grey hair that flopped down over his forehead. Another man followed after him, closing the door as he came. John recognised this man as the fifth participant from the fight; he sported a black eye that must have come to him courtesy of Lestrade, because John didn't remember putting it there.
be a bad thing.
She held it in successfully, right up until the moment he cleared his throat and said, "When I say 'old friend', well—"
"I'm certain I haven't."
When Lestrade began to drop hints about supper, Sherlock promptly extricated himself. Clouds were rolling in to obscure the deepening sunset as he walked back to the main road and hailed a cab; alone in the moving vehicle, he pondered the events of the afternoon with sober concentration.
Greg's eyebrows rose as the argument reached its apparent peak. "Well, those are some interesting obscenities...Now the first one's done. Dunno if he left, or if he's just shut up." A door slammed, and he looked in again. "Five in the room, now. The light-haired one who hit you with the pipe, and an older bloke we haven't seen."
"Wow! Now I'm wishing I

"I'm fine! Just—just stop. Come here?"
Shaking his head, Greg unlocked his office just long enough to retrieve his coat and shut off the lights. On his way back out, he passed the cubicle where DS Patel was busy at his computer.
"It's contagious, I think," Sally mused in response, nodding approvingly to her own glass as Anna moved to pour for her. "All you lot, all paired up—I'm running

"This is a nice place," Anna said as they strolled in. "You've been here before, right?"
"Hah! You know what I was like at fifteen, come on."
Of course, he'd still wind up being involved with the case as it rolled on to its close; assuming the killer could be found and brought in (and he'd found no immediate evidence that the man had fled in the past decade), Sherlock would almost certainly end up giving expert testimony in the trial. That would be far down the line, though; hopefully Lestrade would take the hint Sherlock had just given, and keep his appreciative outpourings to a tolerable minimum in the meantime.
! You'd better bring that smart mouth of yours over here, mister, and convince me to forget that remark..."
Grinning, Anna chimed in, "I think he did! When he gets home, I'll have to ask him whether he actually managed to save it. I'm pretty sure Sherlock spent a large chunk of the party, after that, just trying to get his hands on that phone and delete the evidence..."
Obviously, Charlotte Faber wasn't cut from the same cloth. Everything he knew of her so far made her out to have a heart of gold...but he'd been in her presence less than a week, nearly a year ago, and now he was luring her only daughter out of the country! No mother could be blamed for a bit of protective resentment, in a situation like this.
Giggling, she released her hold long enough for him to lift himself farther and smack the button. When the buzzing ceased at last, he collapsed atop her dramatically, burying his face at the side of her neck with a relieved sigh.
But Greg had always been a realist as well as a romantic. He knew there was
As they approached the Chicago Theatre he paused briefly, recalling that Monk's Pub lay only four blocks west.

Sherlock looked up from folding what had turned out to be a tiered peasant skirt, pulling it reflexively against his chest. "You know exactly how it came about.
But then the call connected; he heard "Happy Tuesday," and suddenly, the smile was real.
When he brought his American girlfriend around, I expected no change. His
"Look, I...don't get the wrong idea, here, Sherlock. If you think I've got some special insight into what makes John tick, or that he's told me personal things about his relationship with you—" Lestrade frowned and turned to rest both elbows on the worktop, plainly trying to find a way to verbalise his thoughts. "He's about the best friend I've got, these days, and we do talk a lot. But he's really private, when it comes down to it, you know? He wouldn't necessarily tell me something like
trust Lestrade.
To the ladies at the senior centre, I've become somewhat of a celebrity. My tenants' fame brings endless questions; I answer what I can.
Horrified, John watched the blade pause and begin to press gently inward near the centre of his friend's belly; he steeled himself for a last-ditch struggle, to try and lunge forward and stop the man—and just then a riot of noise erupted in the outer hall. He was pulled roughly around with a cry, as everyone in the room reacted with confusion. The door burst inwards; black-vested policemen pushed through with weapons drawn. From the corner of his eye, John saw the quiet one rushing forward with something—
, clearly, but I can't complain! From the sounds of things, I presume Anna made it in safely?"
he said, and laughed, glancing back at her saucily over his shoulder.
Doesn't mean I liked being shut in the car with them.
Sherlock sighed, long-suffering in the face of her relentless sentimental logic. "

, to be monitored and coddled! He nearly snapped out the angry reply that immediately sprang to his lips, but thankfully managed to stop himself in time. Every throb of the ache in his arm was a vicious reminder that the last time he'd let his short temper get the better of him, it had been completely unwarranted.
Sherlock accepted the letter and read it aloud. " 'Lucky I wasn't there.' "
"Ah. I'm sorry about that, Becks. Things'll be a little different, from now on—but I know your Aunt Anna will be in Ohio, next Christmas."
Breaking the pensive hush, Greg began, "Well, then—"
, love!"
to be kind and loving!

Sherlock joined her in a brief laugh over her imitation. He could well imagine Lestrade's mortified expression at reading such a missive. Before Lestrade had had the good fortune to meet Anna, and somehow found the courage to pursue her, he'd always struck Sherlock as the sort who entirely failed to appreciate or understand his own draw.
Listening intently, he detected faint strains of music through the door, and then the high, tinkling edge of Anna's laughter; at last, Lestrade's heavy footsteps hurried toward the front room, accompanied by a laugh of his own.
wanted a place to vent his irritation, when he'd first arrived. But the vitriol had somehow drained from him, in the few minutes he'd been here, leaving him with...what?
"He really hasn't been," John responded honestly. "We're getting along great, actually. He hasn't started a ridiculous fight or thrown himself into a sulk for months!"
"Chaz. Sweetie. It's fine," Anna laughs. "She can stay these few months while I pack up the house. Assuming Philly can wait that long."
"Shut it, you," a rough voice spoke from somewhere above him—and then he was stepped on, the bad shoulder grinding down into the vehicle's floor under a heavy boot until stars exploded behind his eyes and he was out again.
Greg growled low in his throat. "Lay off him!"
, have a good evening. We'll talk—I'll probably work late tomorrow, god, maybe Saturday? Can I call then?"
"I hope so. Or, where I'm needed, at any rate. I just want to be in a position to do the most good, right? If they offered me Detective Chief Inspector, they'd have to give me a hell of a good reason to take it."
Brewster had, of course, been speaking of the dubious pleasure of being a new grandparent, and the fear of losing custody of the child. But those words had resonated with Sherlock at the time, pulling a sympathetic vibration from his core that had severely shaken the carefully constructed mask of his alias. He suddenly remembered—more clearly than he expected to—how tightly he'd gripped the pint glass between his palms, and how his voice had cracked even as he'd kicked himself firmly and unforgivingly back into character.
Such a lovely, idyllic afternoon; it seemed a shame to return. The sudden urgency afterwards was quite shocking, in contrast.
Chatting with Anna's youngest brother was far less emotionally affecting. They started with jovial small talk, during which Ryan gave him the rundown on the first of the day's two American football games, and he made a valiant attempt to follow along. The second game was well underway, and from the sounds of things, Justin was quite invested in its outcome; periodically, a hoot or shout of excitement interrupted them, and if the action was good enough, Ryan joined in, too.
"Must have been hard on you. And your friend."
was exactly why.
"Hm. Fair enough, I suppose."
"Um, I just thought you were going to say...Greg." Anna bit her lip and gestured a little helplessly as she said it. She knew she hadn't been the easiest person to live with, these last few months.
There couldn't be, literally—Anna was in midair; the landscape of clouds passing outside the window came with no demarcation lines to trace the boundaries of international waters below, and there would be no cabin announcement until the final descent.
"Morning," announced Sherlock, breezing in with a dramatic flourish of his overcoat.
John had no real talent with language. He remembered a bit of Pashto and a few fragments of German from his RAMC days, but otherwise he was hopeless. Turning to Greg, he whispered, "They're fighting in French. I can't get a word of it."
"You shouldn't worry so," Mycroft said softly, startling him. "They're hardly what you'd call picky."
He's an arse...but, he's my

." John blinked up at him, drawing him close.
There was no note, or receipt—he checked the box again—but he'd sent gag gifts to his own sister-in-law before without a message. Perhaps one of her friends had begged the address from her, and sent this as a cheeky reminder of their upcoming wedding?
Sally's response to this insight was to stick her tongue out at him quite rudely, but as she bent her head back to her filing she wore a small smile. "Look, I'm just trying to keep up the status quo. Someone's still gotta give you a hard time now and again, right?"
"Charming," muttered John.
"Yes, of course! We'll be in touch over Christmas. I mean, not that we'll be
he'd answered Sarah.
"I really, really don't," Sherlock told her, returning his empty cup to its saucer. "My opinion on the matter should have no bearing whatsoever on your compatibility with Lestrade."
The Underground lacked the wholly irritating sunlight, and provided no shortage of stupid people to glower at. Had Sherlock been in a better mood, or known where he wanted to go, he would have preferred a cab; today, however, stewing in his distemper surrounded by strangers felt appropriate.
He tilted his head. "If you really want to handle patients today, why don't you just take Barry's? You don't have to worry about me."
But lately? Gone was the skittish cat, for the most part—Sherlock had grown comfortable with John's attentions, now, as long as they remained relatively constant. Between them, they enjoyed frequent contact, quietly murmured endearments, polite consistency. They ate together, and slept in the same bed; they worked cases when cases presented themselves. On John's days off, when there wasn't a case, their habit of lazing about in the bedroom—or, sometimes, the sitting room—persisted. They also made a point of discussing a few of Sherlock's Hunt stories each week in the continuing effort to resolve those discomforts between them, although their frequency and urgency had begun to drop off. Occasionally (on the average of once every nine evenings, although John tried hard not to think about the fact that it might be a specifically calculated frequency), Sherlock offered a physical encounter, generally one of a handful of types that they'd found satisfied both of their needs adequately. John couldn't complain.
Sherlock covered the remaining two blocks to the river at a fast pace, so wrapped in his consternation that he failed to fully discern his surroundings until he came up hard against the stone railing at the beginning of the bridge's pedestrian walkway. With a startled huff of breath, he leaned on his forearms out over the barrier, bracing one foot between the bulbous carved balusters, and stared out over the river as he tried to reorder himself.
Before he could say anything more to try and pacify John, they heard a noise, the metallic squeal of a door being opened, perhaps a few metres farther on.
been worthy...but Sherlock himself had not.
"Beaux really did it? We thought he alibied out!" exclaimed Greg, flipping through pages of numbers and charts.
?" John rolled towards the centre without thinking as he said it, and caught himself with a hiss of pain that watered his eyes as he turned over quickly to face the opposite direction.
They walked a few steps further in silence.
"It would, if you just listen to my reasoning! You keep on interrupting! And where is Sherlock, anyway?"
As John stood frozen by the revelation, Mycroft's eyes shuttered over, and his posture changed; by the time he drew a long inhale through his nose and pivoted smoothly to face John, he'd regained a measure of his usual detached humour.
"You were thinking it."
"We did! I really enjoyed myself," she answered him, turning beneath his arm to face Sherlock with twinkling eyes as she said it.

"Okay," Liz said gently, "we'll just leave the issue of
He rolled his eyes and grumbled around another bite of his breakfast. "Sal
While he and Greg had waited for Anna's flight at Heathrow, the previous Friday, John had made mention of his concerns with some embarrassment. To his credit, Greg had seemed nearly as discomfited at the idea of having to pick out Christmas gifts for the Holmeses as John was. He did suggest looking for something offbeat and antique, though, and so John had spent his free time over the weekend in a renewed search. Finally, he'd bumbled into a small antique shop. The proprietor there had helpfully informed him of a large estate sale taking place that week. It would be a trek, but Sherlock had already informed him that he planned to spend most of Monday with Anna...so John had decided to go ahead and take the chance.
So it dawned on her slowly, creeping up on her; like the dry eyes and sore throat brought on by the recycling air, but far less expected. Somewhere between the meal service and the end of the trashy historical romance Liz had stuffed into her carry-on, Anna began to gradually notice a tightness in her stomach and an intermittent restlessness jiggling her knee. It wasn't until the last hour of the long flight—when she looked up from a Sudoku puzzle, briefly stumped, and glanced across to see the sun almost completely gone—that the full import struck her.
When Sherlock finds himself in a sour mood, he often relies on John to understand and soothe it. But if John is the unwitting source of that confusing ill temper...where else can he go?
The look he received when he glanced over was more amused and less pointed than the

—he yelled "Down, Greg!" and wrenched himself out of his captor's loosened arms, diving towards the floor as shots rang out on both sides.
"I just—"

longer? I could fill you in on what we found today, looking for Beaux..."
Now, as she settled in for what promised to be a pleasant conversation, she began to realise it wasn't so strange, after all.
"Bring up a box, will you, kiddo?"
"In the area. Really? Sherlock, you haven't pounded on my door in daylight hours in—I don't even know how long."
Greg was pleased to get a few more minutes to speak with Anna, after having run the gauntlet of her family, but she was clearly distracted by the gathering. As dinnertime grew nearer, the children were becoming antsy and wild. Adorable though it was, by the time they'd suffered their fourth loud interruption they were both ready to give it up for the night.
"I like her too," he finally answered his partner, bringing the fine cut crystal up before his face to peer through it introspectively.
John smiled. "I'm not surprised you're tired. You've been working like a fiend since Saturday! When Sally told us you'd stayed home today, I honestly thought Sherlock was about to hug her."
It startled a spluttering laugh out of Lestrade. "Hardly! You think?" At Sherlock's nonchalant shrug, he shook his head and grinned into his cup. "Well. He missed out on a real treat. You were a bloody piece of work, at twenty-eight."
Shrugging, John moved to the cabinet and retrieved a small glass, then reached on tiptoes to the back of the shelf. He'd stashed a bit of his favourite Canadian whiskey there.
When the lights went out, John stared bleakly up at the ceiling, waiting for his eyes to adjust. Sherlock shifted and fidgeted beside him, kicking irritably at an errant fold of sheet beneath the covers before stilling all at once.
"Nah, most of that gets culled down in the post room. This is weirdo mail, stuff that comes in addressed to DI Lestrade specifically. Or to Ronny or me—not as often, though. One time I had some bloke get obsessed with me after I handled him in an interview. He sent me letters for a year and a half, pretending I was his wife and he was travelling abroad while I waited for him." She gave an exaggerated shudder to illustrate her opinion of the memory.
that he didn't reciprocate. It wasn't even that her declarations in regards to their friendship had caused him discomfort—though they certainly had, on some level.
It was a valid observation. He hadn't worked on Christmas last year, of course, but if he hadn't been in the States, he knew a couple hours at Baker Street would have been the full extent of his celebrations. Greg shrugged, acknowledging her scored point. "Yeah, well, things are different now, aren't they?"
Lestrade nodded slightly. "I'll give you that much, though I'm sure it was accidental. But the way John chose to react to those circumstances was under his control. Just as my actions were under mine."
"Now, now, it's not flattery if it's true..."
"So, you must have dragged yourself in pretty late last night," she said. "Sorry I didn't wake up to say hello; by the time the girls left it was almost midnight, and all the wine had gone to my head."
"Absolutely not. To you, anyway."
"He often run off to see this guy during a case?"
"Brian, you daft old bugger! It's been absolutely ages!"
I think I'll keep my calendar quite full, for a while...and invest in earplugs.
"I wasn't aware that I
The next morning was a lazy one, for both Anna and Greg. While she'd entertained at home, he'd been out late with two of his longtime colleagues: Albert Underhill had been a sergeant alongside him, years ago, and the two of them had been in the same training class as Stan Cartwright. Cartwright was currently a DI in the Serious and Organised division, and although Anna hadn't met him she'd become acquainted with his two sergeants, Martin Dane and Bev Gartner. She hadn't yet had the opportunity to meet DCI Underhill, either, but she was happy to wait for another time: the celebration of Bert's early retirement was an understandably private occasion.
The new flat boasted a generous peninsula worktop that separated the kitchen from the dining area; Sherlock settled himself in a slouch upon one of three stools, looking in as Lestrade clattered about with the tea things. The older man's movements were spare and confident, illustrating an ease his guest didn't share.
"Good morning to you," she purred against the stubble beneath his lower lip. "...Gonna get that?"
I do hope Anna isn't easily scared away. She balances him beautifully. I can already imagine her as a daughter.
"Oh, it's got later than I thought," John yawned. "Sorry; I'll bet you're eager to have the sitting room to yourself..."
. Really." She began to extend a hand towards him, seemed to think better of it, then reconsidered a second time and patted him gently on the arm, dropping her hand to rest on the seat between them. Then she turned to look out the window again, watching the approach of sunset.
When he entered the sitting room, John wasn't smiling either; he was fiddling with a shiny new phone, regarding it with an air of resigned disappointment. The bruises underlining his eyes had turned a sickly green. "Ah, Greg. You can have Sherlock's chair," he said when he looked up.
It was, ever so briefly, the unguarded expression of a lonely man with regrets and worries beyond the telling.
Part of his mind failed to be eased by John's declaration—he still felt he'd missed a critical observation today, somehow—but it was a small part. Infinitesimal, and shrinking rapidly under the gentle onslaught of John's loving touch.
I wish Liz, at least, would stay.

New Year's Day had been bright, sunny and practically warm: a promising omen for the year ahead, if one went in for such ridiculous folkloric views. Within an hour after sunset, however, the temperature had dropped drastically from its six degree high. As Sherlock followed his partner up the walk to Anna's small concrete patio, he saw a slight shiver run through John's frame.

"Then why—"

"All right."
"Are you sure, John? You're the one who had today off."
He nodded his thanks. "I certainly do hope Sherlock is right about it being an easy collar. I wouldn't want to have to cancel plans; we're supposed to be in Cambridge on Friday."
I had a thing, and I got sick of holding onto the thing in hopes that I would magically have more of the thing left afterwards. :P

He liked to tell himself the count meant something.

John looked at him like he'd hung the bloody
Sherlock had, on numerous occasions, analyzed furnishings and tableware to determine the personalities, motivations and relationships of victims and suspects. This was not much different, and in fact the mental exercise was made easier by virtue of the fact that he already knew so much of this woman's personal traits and habits. Here on the table, and in the other items which had been added to this small home since he was here less than twelve hours ago, the detective could clearly deduce many of the deeper stories behind Anna Clark. He was frankly surprised at himself for being so eager to learn them.
"Er—I think it was really her mum, as much as her, and I

Sherlock covered a sigh as he paced the smiling older man, strolling slowly with him past the display walls of historical photographs. Brewster paused to gaze at every single one, clasping his hands over his round belly.
more.
"It's not as if he ever actually acted on those warnings," he sneered.
By the time John progressed into the third sale room, he was feeling moderately confident. He hadn't actually chosen anything, yet, but there were a few items he thought he might return to consider. When the new room turned out to house multiple waist-high bins displaying old books, he knew he had at least a fair chance of finding something that Cliff might find worthwhile.
Their Skype call lasted only a few minutes longer, but by the end of it Greg felt as if he'd been put through an emotional wringer. Shoving his computer abruptly away to the empty side of the bed, he dragged off the dressing gown and flung it across the room with a growl of frustrated anger at himself.
"Great, that works for us—go, go, c'mon,
Sherlock stifled a sigh at the tedious question, instead keeping his response light and pleasantly even. "Of course I do, John."
John thought. The landing ahead of him was dark, but light spilled from beneath the kitchen door; he took this as confirmation of his theory.
The older man's eyes lit up with pleasure, and he immediately launched into a torrent of information that interested Sherlock not in the least. He smiled, and nodded at appropriate moments, but his mind wandered to the events that had brought him to take the decided risk of trust in Graham Brewster.
"I say...I should probably get my realtor on the line," Anna responded, breaking into a wide grin.
"That was only two weeks after I came back. You can really tell the difference?"
"Cool. And Greg...congratulations, man."
Words propelled themselves from his lips before he could even consider them. "No, nothing exciting to report. Been a slow week out here, really."
Still, hearing Sally's obvious implication made Anna a little more confident she'd made the right choice.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and inhaled steam. Lestrade took this as acquiescence.
An alien sensation rose up within him in tandem with that observation, and he wondered if he'd made some sort of involuntary noise at it—for at that very moment, as if summoned, John turned his head and threw Sherlock a small, knowing smile and a wink before returning his attention to the nonchalant study of the menu board. He'd clasped his hands loosely behind his back, and was idly tapping the fingers of his left hand against the back of his right in a slow and patient rhythm; it only served to draw his partner's attention all the more to the composed confidence he exuded in his parade rest posture, and the coiled, impressive strength Sherlock knew resided in that compact frame.
"Aw, well, surely it could wait just a
"Nah, they already know what they should be working on. If they're not at each other's throats, anyway. I'll be in touch."
"What?"
This brought a deep, amused chuckle from Brian. "Still jealous, after all these years? Don't let Pietro hear you."
"No," replied Sherlock, breezing past him into the flat. "I was in the area."
"Dunno. It's likely as anything else, innit? They've got our wallets. Assuming they've looked, they know I'm a copper."

"Meet your new tenant." Liz placed a hand over her heart, and raised the other in a solemn vow, half-eaten sandwich and all.

"Oh-ho! Well, don't let us keep you, then. I'll just email you the juicy details later tonight, and keep you updated as we go tomorrow. And we'll see you and John on Thursday, yeh?"
, exactly; he asked more for the comfortable rhythm of their banter than anything else. He was in a rare social mood. It was probably something to do with the approaching holiday and its attendant rush of strong memories.
"Just be careful to measure anything you end up picking out; it might look great in the shop, but just watch out for logistics," Sally recommended. She leaned forwards to pick up the dwindling wine bottle, refilling her glass, then topping off Anna's at her nod. "My sister Hannah bought me this
"Perfect timing, John! I've solved it!"
"No surprise, when most of his adult life has been a series of horribly prolonged unpleasantnesses." He said it in a fairly flippant tone, but the accuracy of the offhand statement gave him pause.
he thought, watching Brewster consider his words. It was, of course, an overstatement; Sherlock didn't truly believe that Anna had anything to worry about. Paulos was now in custody; the evidence Sherlock had seen indicated that he was clearly the more intelligent of Crannock's pair of incompetent hired hands, and that wasn't saying much at all. Furthermore, the circumstances that had led to the gallery owner's death were obviously linked to Anna only tangentially, through the possibility that scaring her might have brought Drew Hardwick out of the woodwork. No, the only thing to be concerned with was tracking down Crannock himself, and doing so quickly: Detective Garvey's investigation would no doubt be bumbling and inept enough to send Teufel Der Kunst into hiding.
Liz goes off to the restroom, but Anna doesn't follow. She's nursing her margarita and a case of jetlag.

"The man in the blue coat? At this distance, I'd say...lower management, something in the textile industry; just passed over for promotion and suffering anxiety over telling his wife the news; one child of toddler age, and she's recently started actively trying for another."
Pausing at the gate, Sherlock called out. "Anna?"
Back came the dazzling smile, even white teeth in a perfect line across Brian's tanned face. When she'd first met him, Anna had thought it a bit off-putting—a salesman's layer of smooth artifice covering over what her eyes still saw as Greg's features, turning them into something disturbingly insincere.
His voice was husky and rough, too, as he replied, "All right, sweetheart. I'll be dreaming of you."
"Sure thing, sir." His dark eyes flashed with mirth; he was the youngest on their team by nearly five years, as well as least senior. "Any orders you want me to pass along?"
? You know as well as I do the sort of shit Sherlock gets himself into when he goes off looking for bloody trouble on his own! Does Jeff Hope ring a damn bell?"
The older man's balance faltered; John experienced the moment as if in slow motion. The hollow squawk of the bucket scraping against the floor was shockingly loud.
Until this morning, I hadn't really understood. Still don't, quite, but sitting with them outside the suspect's home while they argued over old aggravations was like hearing Papa fighting with my older brother.
"How have things been for you, the last four weeks?" Sherlock returned his gaze resolutely to the contents of the box as he said it.
He saw, now, what he hadn't been willing to admit to himself on earlier reflection: he hadn't broken his alias with Brewster purely because the man had earned his eventual respect.
such an idiotic, impulsive thing?"
"Too bad you can't just send Jenny home."
"Oh yeah, I remember. Well, he was tough—seemed like there was nothing too gruesome, nothing too heartbreaking for Jim. He could handle scenes that had the forensic techs heaving. But Justine and Eliza...
She blushed and glanced away, fiddling with the neck of the forest green jumper she wore. "You know, I almost called you in the middle of the night, last night. You would've already been at work for the day, though; I didn't want to bother you..."
Greg asked the first question. "Who's 'O. F.'?"
John let a sip of the whiskey linger in his mouth, warming his throat as he swallowed it down slowly.
Her expression softened fondly. "Well, I'm glad. It's nice to hear that London occasionally takes a break from gruesome murder. I'll bet it's got Sherlock on edge, though, hasn't it?"
-----
While Sherlock ate, he explained the ins and outs of the Runnell girls' case, and how he'd gone about proving their murderer's identity. He didn't get into the details of what had delayed that solution for so long, but John didn't seem overly curious about how it had come to be stored beneath the bed.
Dinner came from a microwaved tray; there was nothing good on television, but Greg eventually found a documentary on marine biology. He left it on for the comfort of calming voices while he stubbornly forced himself to unpack one of the boxes in the kitchen. Not another morning would go by without the use of his favourite frying pan...that decision was final.
"Good." He sighed. "I'm sorry, Greg."
"Here, let me listen."
He nodded. "It was more about remembering our early days. Y'know, back when we were all young and stupid."
Shopping was not John's strong suit. Gift shopping, even less so.
"Your words, John, not mine," she threw back, then laughed lightly at the look on his face. "Yeah, all right, not 'tame', maybe...make him less prickly?"
"You gave that back to me, god, it's been years ago now; you said it was hopeless. Yeah, I remember that word, distinctly.
Sherlock shouted silently, blinking hard so that the little diamonds would stop their damnable blurring.
Sherlock scoffed aloud. "Why would I want that?"
indeed, Sherlock mused.
John deposited his own mug on the table, then returned to the counter to wait for his sandwich and crisps. This time, Sherlock's eyes followed him across the deli, watching his friend's steady, measured stride and the perfect balanced ease of his stance, the alert openness of his face in profile—and, incidentally, the immediately receptive reaction of the young woman behind the counter. She smiled over the register at John, and her body language shifted in subtle invitation as she casually brushed a lock of fine blonde hair away from her not unattractive face.
Blinking at the wave of realisation that had passed over him in a matter of seconds, Sherlock deliberately allowed his posture to loosen, and put out a hand to carefully take up the glass of wine John had allotted him. His friend's words from only moments before repeated in his mind, then, as if providing the final argument in his proof.
John turned to face forward, and they sat for a few minutes in silence, taking stock of their dismal situation.
, right? Okay. So I'm Sherlock. I'm a ridiculous, overconfident
Shaking his head to clear it, Sherlock stood and firmly reoriented his concentration to the wall, the data, and the case at hand. He'd given this matter five full minutes of his attention, and now it was time to focus.
He took a mental snapshot of John tying his shoe before the mouth of the alley where he'd first attempted to lose the tail Verrone had placed on him. A few blocks later, John checked his reflection in the window of the same State Street boutique Sherlock had ducked into in desperation, when the pair of musclebound men had failed to be deceived by his ploy.
Anna's relying on me for an informed opinion, and I believe in thoroughly testing the waters; I wanted to know how Greg handles surprises.
"You mentioned it once," John hummed, clumsily shuffling himself around. "You were seventeen or so, right?"
"Well, he's a touch taller than he looks in the photos, for one thing. And he seems very kind, which I'd expect of course, but underneath he's a force of nature, isn't he?"
"One of those 'soldier through it' kinds of occasions?"
But it was fitting, wasn't it? And whatever discomfort John, or Mycroft, or even
felt in regards to the sentimental proceedings of Christmas, there was no getting around it.
remembered terribly much of it. When they'd dropped him at his flat just after sunrise on Friday, he'd dragged himself straight to bed and stayed there until four the next morning, stirring only for physical necessities and his scheduled doses of painkillers.
The idea apparently took his friend by surprise, but he agreed almost immediately, with a small shrug. "All right, whatever you like."
Sherlock paused before making a reply. Sorting through the influx of new information, he picked out a handful of points for further consideration before tucking the rest away. "I'm thinking. Is there a problem?"
"Sure, she's put up with your shite, what? Twenty-two years running? S'pose I'll bow to your obvious expertise, in this case!"
It wasn't a pretty one.
"What's that, lad?" Greg asked.
They exchanged a thin smile, and for a few minutes they returned to mutually ignoring each other's presence, although they continued through the room side by side like casual companions.
"I wouldn't have pegged them for yours, either. Don't you have staff, for this sort of thing? Personal shopping service?"
This chapter takes us back in time before moving forward, beginning the day before Greg's actions in Chapter 3. Just wanted to point it out in case anyone gets confused.
To his further surprise, Mycroft gave a low chuckle at the joke. "You really ought not to believe everything my brother tells you about me, John."
It's a quiet day, a perfect chance for Anna to adjust to her new home...and an opportunity to accept an unexpected invitation.
"Ah, the usual. Stress and bother. I've been trying to get those damned compliance reports together, today, but now...I'm considering taking the rest of your appointments myself, just to stay out of the line of sight of the reception desk."
"Somehow I feel like I'm better off not knowing much more."
sick of something about me; it's served me well so far!"
John looked up with raised eyebrows. "Hi. Why'd you text me asking for a progress report, when you were already on your way over here?"
I haven't given up yet! Thanks for being patient.
John and Greg are holding out hope for help to arrive...but until then, they must do what they can to make the best of a very bad situation.
"Aw, really?"
He barely registered the response behind him, beyond a vague sense that, without a doubt, John would follow; his thoughts were spinning madly once again, railing in shocked confusion against the dichotomous treatment he'd apparently chosen to give the events of his travels.
, or can I tempt you with something else? We've just got some truly magnificent filets mignonnes, and the roast aubergines with cranberry balsamic glaze are perfect with that..."
to the airport, right?"
he surmised, turning the figure to study its intricate brushwork. It wouldn't be the first time, if so; she'd had her last few orders of specialty threads and other embroidery supplies delivered straight to him, even before he'd moved. This little church didn't seem quite her style, but it was beautiful in its own way—and as much as he thought he'd got a handle on her tastes, she was still surprising him.
Sherlock's mouth opened, and closed; he looked between the two happy, expectant faces, and produced a passable smile of his own. "Thank you for the offer, Lestrade. But I've got some business to take care of, yet tonight. I should be getting on with it."
"Ah, Sally. Sweet of you, trying to emulate our old balance, but I already know you're really just concerned for us."
John grunted. "He's here. This is the place, I can feel it. C'mon, there's surely a way around back." Off he went around the corner, slinking quickly into the gloom with the grim determination of a soldier, and after a second's nervous hesitation Greg hurried along after him.
,"—he brushed a fingertip lightly over the hard knot distending the bicep, and John shivered—"the film you've just watched is always your go-to choice whenever you feel under the weather."
will, too, right?"
"Always,
John gave barely a glance to his surroundings—a church he didn't recognise, hulking behind him in the darkness, and the flashing chaos of police cars and ambulances ahead—before tugging on his partner's coat to stop them.
John didn't respond directly to him; instead he began to muse aloud in a hushed and angry voice, pacing down the centre of the alley with his friend close at his heels. "He's got to have come this way. I just have to think like
up?" he questioned, far too innocently, returning his attention to the bowl.
"I have a lab,
"Hm? No."
Whatever it was, he already knew it had to do with Sherlock. Something in that casual little chat with Sarah, something John had said that had gnawed at him afterwards...something that he'd immediately wanted to cover over, and push out of his mind...
Anna did want to laugh, just a little, but she couldn't exactly dispute her friend's claim. Andy Hardwick had lived here; he'd struggled with his addiction here; he'd hidden messages in the very
"What, you think they just dumped us somewhere and went on?"
But his request—a minor appropriation of CCTV surveillance, one street, one evening—wasn't for himself. The explanation: unselfish, utterly sentimental.
A balding man wearing a dark suit and a chunky signet ring came by their table before long. Brian stood and gave him a combination handshake and rowdy clap on the shoulder—clearly, this friend went way back.
"Hello, love. Not a bad time, I hope?" he asked, remembering the friendly chaos that had reigned in the Faber family home the previous Christmas.
," Greg hissed, staggering backwards away from the door, and tripping over the bucket with another dreadful clatter; John rushed to his side to steady him as the door was unlocked and thrown open.
in the situation. Mrs Hudson was still cooing over them and bringing them surplus baked goods at every opportunity. The personnel at Scotland Yard had calmed the majority of their disbelieving squawking, and Sally seemed to have positioned herself as their staunch defender;
