I blinked at this. Retrieve it? As in…
Mycroft sighed. She really did look very much like their mother, and at that point, sounded very much like her as well.
He roused himself a bit. “Yes, John,” he replied.
He was running his fingers (always so delicate—a musician’s fingers, or a scientist’s?) across the hearth, tracing the outlines of the bricks. He glanced up, once, and for a second—or less—Mycroft thought he saw something. It was the merest suggestion of an expression—that thoughtful but calm look he recalled most often when his brother was deeply engaged in a chemistry text—what he thought of as the “real” Sherlock—his little brother—whom he had missed more than he could ever say.
“As I deduced, yes, one of the horses had lipped the ring right off his finger and swallowed it.”
He, apparently cooled by my ablutions to his upper half, gave a slight shudder. Then he focused his sharp eyes on mine and his voice dropped quite low. “I believe that you were somehow stimulated as I performed my investigation of the scene—and you were so ashamed that you fled, claiming to be a victim of the heat.”
“Was she able to determine what set him off?” the older brother asked.
Now I heard his footsteps retreating over the gravel walkway, but the desperation of my situation was not retreating in kind. I stripped off my coat and laid it across my lap.
Thomas nodded dolefully.
So, it was likely that the trespasser had been a guest of Mr. Harper’s at least once and it had been a recent visit, during which perhaps this person had simply noted the defect—or perhaps had damaged the latch intentionally so as to have a means of entrance?
And so here we are—Mycroft had sent a message to his housekeeper to prepare the rooms that we are to inhabit for the next few weeks at the least—whilst I in a stroke of inspiration explained to Sherlock that he was not going anywhere on his own. I would be joining him. He was so very delighted that, quite disregarding the presence of his brother, he threw his arms around me before essentially dragging me to my bedroom to pack—and completely missing the fact that I had not actually specified that I would be going to New York with him.
And suddenly everything else was wrong, too—wrong house and wrong dishes and wrong spoon and wrong clothing and wrong man…
No. No injection. They wanted to knock him out. Make him helpless. No.
I found that I could not respond. I was torn. Part of me felt grateful that he had a brother who had the means and the decency to offer such an arrangement—while another part found itself resentful and jealous because it was clear that I could not offer my darling the safety and care he required.
“And…?”
His older brother seated himself gingerly next to him. “I am sorry about all this,” he remarked, almost to himself (he wasn’t sure if his brother was comprehending, listening, or even aware of his presence). “I know that you want to go home—back to… everything. But surely, Sherlock, you do understand that that must be handled with the utmost care.”
He was dreadfully pale, making the shadows under his eyes and along the gaunt cheeks even more terrible. His dark hair was a riot of short curls; as I know he does, he must have been raking his fingers through it. He clutched at the blanket draped over his shoulders, but even the heavy wool could not obscure the fact that he was trembling.
This admittance actually did, to my great surprise, seem to deflate him a bit, as he has apparently lost interest. He has returned to whatever it was he had been doing during my absence
"Call me. Whenever he gets like that just call me and I'll be right here to keep you sane." Victor swore, his arms wrapping back around John and holding him tightly. "I will always be here for you, John. Whenever you need me. It's not nearly enough to repay you for what you've done for me." He kissed his neck once, well aware that that was going too far. But just for the moment he didn't care. He wasn't even sure John would notice. "You've taken care of me so much, I want to do it for you too."
"Just how big do you intend our family to be, John Watson-Holmes?" He grinned and held John closer. "We can't leave Mrs. Hudson, we need her. England needs her." He chuckled again.
"S-Sorry, I haven't..touched myself down there in a while." Sherlock confessed as a sort of apology for moving. John wasn't really focused anymore and he just let Sherlock off the hook.
A few months later Victor moved out, he'd purchased his own flat and decided it was time to try to build his own life. But John didn't have time to think about that because shortly after Victor left Sherlock and he were called on a case to investigate the grisly murder of a young couple. While on the scene Sherlock shouted at everyone to be silent and leaned down opening a hidden trap door to reveal a baby boy who was screaming his lungs out. Greg, John, Donovan, and Anderson watched in confused awe as Sherlock cuddled the child close, bouncing him and whispering to him.
"Correct!" Mycroft exclaimed grandly. "Alright then you little pirates." He straightened up and motioned. "You may sail through!" He chuckled softly, watching Greg's face as Greg moved over to him and hugged him. "Close your mouth dear or you'll drown." He chided gently.
"Sherlock?" Mrs. Hudson called softly. "There's a doctor here for you."
"No, Greg. It's fine. You didn't want to tell me in the first place remember, but I kept asking and asking. It's my fault." Greg ran a hand through his hair and huffed out of frustration.
"You're getting yourself worked up... I will save Italian for when we have a holiday alone." Mycroft teased, his voice actually full of arousal but also sternness. He felt Greg's hand slipping down towards his waist and he smirked. "Arrête ça." He commanded in French, pinning Greg's hands in his own. "Do you want to upset our son?" He purred softly in his ear. "Arrête ça." He repeated, but it was clear he was enjoying this. Greg smirked, he had no idea what Mycroft was saying but he was quite sure he was telling him to stop.
"I'm here." He whispered softly.
did. I'm not like them. I'm just a normal ordinary man. I'm not..." He couldn't say it even though it was circling his head.  "Maybe I'm just too tired." He said dismissively, trying to shelve his emotion. Sherlock didn't dare let him go. He held him tighter in fact still kissing his skin trying to let him know his heart was his here. It wasn't anywhere else, it was right here in John's hands he just needed to remember that.
"John," he said, but it came out as moan because their hips were moving faster. "I want you both." He said in a pleading voice but his moved his lips back to Victor's desperate for more. He moaned into his mouth as Victor brought his hands to his hair, playing with it gently as they rocked against each other.  John groaned, he wanted to be touched. This was bloody torture. He retreated to the bedroom for a moment, returning with the bottle of lubricant and making sure the doors were locked. He then came back over to them, setting the bottle down.
"I'm sure you will find out soon enough." John smirked and wound his hand back into Sherlock's once he was out of the car. "Mycroft are you blushing?" John leaned forward some, surveying Mycroft closely. Mycroft tensed.
"Mummy," He whimpered and Greg's heart broke all over again. He didn't know what to say, what to tell him. How does one tell a two year old his parents have both died? How do you explain death to a child? The boy snuggled closer to Greg and fell back asleep.
a princess." Sherlock said darkly, opening his eyes to watch his family. "You will find out when you are older." Sherlock smiled.
"We will be here at nine sharp." He stood. "Do you need anything?" John didn't answer, his eyes closed tightly and his focus on counting his breaths again.
"Can't afford to, Sherlock." Victor mumbled suddenly grabbing his head. "Please, don't scream right now, alright? I feel like my head my is going to explode."
"Now that your tea is ready I will help them, if there is anything left to do." Mycroft stood and moved to Greg's side. "I brought lunch for you as I know you are accustomed to eating a bit before now each day." He whispered to Greg. John was looking over the instruction manual for the phone Mycroft had purchased. It was a lot nicer than the one he'd had previously, likely it cost a small fortune. Leave it to the brothers to make a war even out of replacing John's phone.
"Alex!" Sherlock said brightly. "You look well. I take it you joined Victor at the gym?" He smiled. Sherlock hugged him back, rather more friendly than John had and Alex said nothing, simply because he was too polite to mention it. He grinned broadly at the detective, winking slightly as he did. Sherlock for his part liked Alex, he was loud, charismatic, but polite. "Mycroft," He said shaking his hand as he emerged from the staircase and then walking over to shake Greg's. "It's good to see you two as well."
"Hey you two," He greeted as he moved to sit on the floor with them. He sighed softly, he felt better knowing they were okay and being near his son. He was sure he was just being paranoid because of the events of the day before but being away from Marius for too long made him nervous.
thought about this.
"No, no, no. We're done." He said sternly. "Christmas is in a few days. We're on Holiday from this moment on and we’re done." He said it firmly but he could still see the glint of curiosity in Sherlock's eyes. "Sherlock," He said warningly.
"I'm not important right now, you are. Getting you better is what is important to me." Sherlock sighed as he said that and kissed John's lips softly. He pulled away and smiled at him softly.
was why Sherlock loved him. He truly trusted him. It wasn't like everyone else claimed to trust him but really didn't. John honestly did. He didn't even question him. He just did it, like it came naturally to him.
"Oh, John I feel like I want you to fuck me," He begged, his hips bucking into John's hand because he was absolutely desperate to focus on this pleasure. His mind was completely blank of anything except the most primal instincts and urges and it was utterly perfect. He didn't just want this he
"Don't." Sherlock scolded softly, his hand turning John's chin to look at him. "It's perfectly natural for you to be jealous. I was. Maybe because of that it seemed like I was trying to flirt. Maybe I was. I do stupid things when someone else fancies my husband." He spoke quietly so as not to disturb Hamish. "But there is nothing wrong with how you feel. Are you ill? Have you been pretending to be healthy again?" His fingers deftly moved to check his pulse at his neck, his eyes narrowing. "Is something still wrong?"
it was going to be. No place has ever felt like home the way this place does." He pulled Sherlock closer, nuzzling his nose into his hair. "But even knowing that nowhere is home without you."
"You know better than to jump on someone like that, Hamish. I got hurt helping Marius and you hit me where I got hurt."
"Did you hear any of our conversation?" He asked curiously. Hoping John had at least heard some of it so he wouldn't actually have to tell him. "He...He was my first, boyfriend." He whispered, not really sure why he felt nervous about telling John that. He bit his bottom lip nervously.
people?" He asked before he took Sherlock's lip into his mouth and nibbled on it, before pulling away with a grin.
"I have thought about that before," he said, his voice muffled by the pillow. "I did more than thought about it actually, I sort of...fantasized about it. But, I won't tell you more because if I do we'll end up having sex again for the second time since we woke up." He chuckled as he felt John climb back onto the bed. "We haven't had to put on clothes today though. Ha! Now that's a benefit I never considered when I thought about being with you. We're going to be naked all the time now, aren't we?" He asked with a smile as he peeked out from the pillow.
"My, he is observant." Sherlock teased. "But that is exactly why Hamish Watson-Holmes, we wait for our drinks to cool before we drink them. Daddy should know better, he's a doctor."
Sherlock let out a gasp when John pushed him down, he honestly hadn't expected this from John. All of the data he'd acquired suggested that John was totally submissive, especially where Sherlock was concerned. He'd imagined John doing this but once John confessed to desiring Sherlock to be his master, his
A bit more explanation now that you have read the chapter!
"Yeah." Marius said, nodding into Hamish shoulder. "I never had a fwend befow." Mairus said with a sniffle. He pulled out of Hamish's arms and gave him a weak smile. "If dey my new daddies are you my coswin?" He asked, sounding a bit hopeful about something for the first time since he’d come to Baker Street. Greg’s phone chimed softly.
"Sherlock..." John almost whined his name as his body shook, moving faster. His instinct took over and he moved in so many ways just to make Sherlock shiver like that, just to see him trembling. It was addicting to know that he could make Sherlock so open like this, that he was the one who could make him feel this way. He murmured all sorts of sweet things as he kissed his mouth, jaw, neck, and chest still moving hard against the tightness enveloping him. "So beautiful... The way you move, how you look... God no one will take you from me... I won't let them... I love you." John whispered, nuzzling into his neck for a moment before pulling back to look him in the eyes. Sherlock moved his hands to John's face, bringing his forehead down so they would touch. He gazed into his eyes, hoping John could physically see how much he needed him. He moaned, not being able to stop himself as John kept hitting that spot.
"Well, I'll be sure to say when next time." John warned him with a teasing smile but he leaned further into his touch. He couldn't stop himself. It was an instant reaction. It was not often that Sherlock Holmes touched his husband so affectionately in public. He gently nodded to the bench behind him and the two easily sank down on it together. "He's a lot more like you than me. He's already so smart. It's amazing. It's almost like he really is your child. He picks up on things so quickly. He can read people's faces. He studies everything." John smiled brightly at Hamish when he started to climb across the tiny monkey bars all by himself. "We're you like that as a child?" He asked curiously. Sherlock blushed, not overly so but enough to tinge those damn cheekbones.
"Just a panic attack? You say that as if it's nothing. You've never had one like this before, at least not while I was with you." He turned on the shower and slipped off the shirt he had on. "You must hear yourself." Sherlock was almost pleading and it made John pause. "Please take care of yourself as much you need to? John, tell me, when is the last time we have done something or you personally did something for yourself? Because all I can recall is you doing things for me and remembering later you should do something for yourself too. This morning for example you sat down with me and before you thought about making yourself breakfast you worried about my injection. That's not healthy." Sherlock was irritated by how incredibly stupid John was being.
"Sure! Of course. On the house." Sherlock sighed, shaking his head.
"We... Home?" Hamish mumbled sleepily.
"You're anything but ordinary, John." He spoke into his ear, "You're wonderful and interesting and you can make me laugh. Victor could never make me laugh. Only you could do that. And Irene certainly never made me laugh. She just piqued my curiosity for a moment." He nuzzled his nose into John's hair, trying to figure out a way to prove that he was more than just an ordinary man. He needed to prove that he loved him. Then he remembered it: a file on his laptop that he’d written about John when they first met.  "Stay here." He whispered as he jumped off the bed and hurried into the living room. He came back with his laptop and logged on. "No, don't you go lying down. I want you to read this." Sherlock insisted as he pulled John back up and wrapped his arms around him like before.
"Yes, do stop, Sherlock. You're making our son cringe." John said with a smile as he held Hamish close. "We'll walk to the park; it will give us a chance to get used to the cold." He explained to Hamish and he started to wonder why Sherlock was walking behind him. "Are you coming Sh- Ah!" John couldn't help but yelp once he felt Sherlock pinch his bum. "What has gotten into you?" He said, his face bright red as he giggled, praying Hamish hadn't seen that. Hamish wriggled and squirmed until John put him down, taking one of each of their hands. Sherlock easily held his son's hand and looked at John quizzically.
"God you are incredible!" John breathed in awe against Sherlock's mouth, his hips pushing back into his lover with each thrust. Trying to draw him out, trying to bring both their releases. "Come undone with me." He whispered, wrapping himself around him as best he could, one hand carding through his hair as he desperately pressed their mouths together again.
"John, stop it." Victor's voice was tight with pain. "Why do you insist on lying? He's going to go mad. Tell him now. You saw how he was acting up there with Mycroft. He's trying to be different." Victor put his hand on John's shoulder. "You owe it to yourself, to Hamish, and to him." John took a deep breath because he felt like his heart was racing out of control. He didn't want to tell Sherlock right now. Right now just didn't feel like a good time but he knew Victor was right, Sherlock was trying to be different. He was trying to reunite the family so that they could have support. As John really stopped to consider everything that happened, he blushed. Sherlock was doing this for him. Trying to make things better so that John could have an actual family.
"Though that comment about the riding crop was wholly indecent." He grinned and leaned in kissing Sherlock softly. "I knew after that meeting that my life was going to change and I was pretty sure that there was no way it could get worse. I was however completely unprepared for how much
"Okay Papa." He leaned out so Sherlock could hug and kiss him.
"There's tissing people outside."  He giggled more.
"Good evening." Mycroft said softly. He took Greg's hand and put some cash on the table.
"So far the cameras suggest he is still in the flat at Baker Street." Mycroft's glare darkened. "But if he leaves and you don't tell me why - I will not hesitate to have Lestrade find him and take him directly to rehab." Mycroft warned darkly.
"We love you too, 'Mish." Sherlock was more than content as they made their way to the small park. The two men watching as Hamish ran off immediately and climbed all over the playground. He put an arm around John's waist, pulling him close for a moment. "You wanted to be reminded, so I'm reminding you." He whispered in John's ear, his voice soft. "I am always thinking about the ways to make you beg for mercy, John Watson-Holmes." His attention focused seemingly on Hamish as the boy scampered about. John swallowed thickly and he couldn't stop himself from leaning into his husband.
“Testifying for or against Sherlock?”
I was silent, realising that the subject that I had rather facetiously introduced had changed into something quite serious and close to my love’s heart.
“And she is. Without a doubt. The salmon she made the other day was delightful. I noticed that Himself quite enjoyed it, in particular.”
“Let me examine you,” I responded instantly. She nodded, and I gingerly pressed on her foot, over the bandages. “The swelling has increased,” I reported grimly. “Has the pain, as well?”
“Do you really believe he’s ready to go home?” Anthea demanded.
“Obvious…” he stopped speaking and swallowed hard again. His eyes glittered in the dim light.
“Henrietta Tobin,” she introduced herself.
She shook her head. “He’s been to hell and back. I wonder… I mean… do you think he’ll ever get back to normal?”
, that he knows the liniment is nothing more than macassar oil with some scent infused, so he must not be treating an actual injury but just maintaining the appearance of one. I think that she believes his story about an old injury making it impossible to... fulfil his husbandly duties, and that in her mind, their ‘arrangement’ refers to both of them keeping this information private. So even if it was not the same information they wished to hide, they both had a secret that I threatened to reveal.”
He liked drawing better than colouring in a book. Daddy said it was because he liked to use his imagination—and that his brain was not quite like other little boys’ brains. That made him special and he liked that, too.
“Are we... of course we are!” Mrs. Bloom’s voice raised above the restrained modulation she had, until now, managed to maintain.
Of course, there is always a point at which I must give in to my own need for rest, and I reluctantly bid him good night and close myself in my own room. I never sleep well when he is in such a mood, of course—between my concern for him and the disruptions of his frenzy of activity, it is virtually impossible, but I still do sleep more than he. In the mornings he is dishevelled and incoherent.
My mad man.
No, that is not honest. I did not wish to release myself. I wanted my love to release me. I desired for us to be back in our rooms, innocent of all clothing and lying on his bed together. I wished to be pressed up against his taut body. I longed to feel his thin, white fingers as they caressed first my face, and then my throat, and then my chest.
And now, both men found themselves somewhat uneasy. They were continuing to monitor everywhere for signs of crimes of a certain type—Mr Holmes was keenly interested in kidnappings, for example—but they knew that ultimately, they would have to go backward. They needed to work through it all again, vigilant about any sightings of the younger brother—sightings they had missed the first time around.
She closed her mouth.
“Your brother sent me in the right direction. Come away from here, Sherlock—it’s vile.”
“You’ve had a lovely sleep. Now, how about you try to use the toilet?”
It was only when I announced it was time to retire that he even acknowledged my presence. Then, slowly, he raised his face to mine where I stood before him. I reached out my hand to him, and he hesitantly took it. I pulled him up and extracted him from his nest. “Come to bed, my love,” I murmured. He nodded and allowed me to tug him to his bedroom.
“Sorry, sir,” he mumbled. God, he had put his foot in it, hadn’t he?
“That sounds perfect,” I agreed.
It just seemed so terribly fussy.
“You have some too?” he offered haltingly. “Missus… Mrs… makes… it’s good.”
“His teeth are in good shape,” one of the nurses remarked a bit wryly, flashing a hand with a vivid half-circle of red marks on the back.
“Just a little game. You’ll like it.”
a shirt?” I gasped. I considered how he was dressed now. His shirt was not tucked in. No braces. Barefoot. I reached under his shirt. His trousers were not fastened. I slipped my hand inside them. No drawers. My heart sank. “Oh, my love,” I sighed, “you mean that you were
I had finally given it up and, donning my coat and hat, I struck out. It had, as the scent in the air had promised, rained during the night, and the city was cooler and brighter. The streets were full of folks bustling about.
He seemed disinclined to feed himself, and Solomon patiently fed him one forkful at a time while Sherlock gazed at the crayon marks on his hand, lost in thought.
“Well, maybe you
That our marriage had ended by divorce rather than death was undeniable. Mary and I had been legally divorced (and if the means by which that divorce had been obtained—necessitating a stage-managed ‘assignation’ on my part as proof of adultery—we were assuredly not the first nor the last people to have play-acted in such a manner to achieve their goal).
He did not care to recall the condition in which it had arrived, two years earlier—spattered in fake blood and real dirt from the pavement and pungent with his brother’s sweat.
“Hm? I see,” Mycroft hummed noncommittally. The nurse had been explaining exactly what had transpired upon his arrival—not that he had been able to elucidate much on the subject. Observing how his brother behaved and knowing what was going on in his head were two entirely different things. The government man had tuned his rather droning voice out as soon as he had started.
“Well, yes, John. Of course.”
Yes. She could see it now. It wasn’t just that he was silent; it wasn’t just that he was engaged in activities that were usually considered childish. It was—everything. The way he moved; the way he tipped his head and pushed at the books. The way he sprawled on the floor now, beaming as he opened one of the books and began to look at the pictures.
I took a moment to absorb this. “So, you found the ring?”
“How did you know to come?”
“Why... I... that you and the doctor... live together...” she managed, stammering terribly.
That was going to take some good, old-fashioned “fibbing.”
He looked at me sharply. “What do you mean?” he demanded.
safe, and this is
Mycroft rose slowly from his chair. He was visibly distraught and horrified by his brother’s act of self-injury. He took a few steps toward the bed, on which I was now sitting, cradling my darling’s head in a pillow laid across my legs. I was speaking in a hushed tone in his ear, reassuring him (and myself) that it was all right. He would be well again soon and this would all be in the past. His brother approached us.
He tried to curl up but was prevented by the cramped space.
“Yes,” he replied, “now that you are here.”
“Sherlock, you’re ill,” Mycroft explained. I could hear what a strain it was to keep his voice level and low. “You are not thinking clearly.”
He had no idea what people thought about his absences from his shop.
never again
“A runt like you? Your sister’s got a better chance of taking us—she’s big enough.” Derek—who was the taller of the two and older by two months and liked to lord it over his mate—snorted.
“He did. It was his idea, really. He’s as worried about him as I am, and he thought this might work… well, that it wouldn’t hurt to try.”
Derek glanced at Mark, confused. “Did he just call us poufs?”
“Third time! She’s lucky no one died.”
The man nodded. “Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Apparently young Mr Holmes here was trying to get over the wall when he passed out.”
He stopped again and I simply waited, giving him a moment to collect himself. Finally, he continued. “So, you see, we had no choice. We brought her to one of those places—one of those places where they take folks like her. It was… we had to keep her safe, didn’t we? And she’s not a frail thing, sir—she is more like me than most woman would care for—oh, sir, I have never done such a hard thing. That place—I do understand that they need to be that way, but to see the poor wretches in their rags, lost and frightened and confused…”
“No,” I said sharply—for I was truly angry at this point, “you did not think. That is exactly the point that I am making. I do not believe that it is your fault, my dear friend, but what you are proposing to do has nothing whatsoever to do with ‘thought’. And the thought of you, so far away and alone, is deeply distressing. I cannot bear to consider it.”
Sherlock was not supposed to stop all communication. He was not supposed to fall off the radar. He was not supposed to be damaged to the point of insanity and tortured to the point of death. He was not supposed to finally resurface on a dark street, filthy and strung out and injured, and eventually end up in his big brother’s house, so broken that he was unable to speak.
He remained silent for a few moments, his head down and his countenance obscured from me. “Do you mean that?” he finally asked, mumbling against his knees.
Between the soup and the fruit, he finally consumed the two women were satisfied that he had gotten enough into him. He seemed to lag a bit at that point.
But it was like trying to move a leg when it had gone numb. For some reason the signal from his brain was not reaching his mouth. And as they continued moving smoothly through the dark streets, he began to be aware of an odd feeling. Everything was becoming confusing and overwhelming; the street lights were making his head ache and the car was moving too fast and he was suddenly very glad that the driver seemed to know where he was going because it was far too com… comp… something.
He reached up and grasped the hand his friend offered.
“And what do you deduce from that?”
“My books… damn.” He realised an instant too late that he had just agreed to leave with his—what was he? Former schoolmate? Accompanist?
“Let’s see,” Greg requested, moving from the sofa to Sherlock’s chair, which had been slightly displaced by the tree.
“Sherlock, does it ever bother you—”
We were fortunate in that it was only a few days later that we hired Belinda. She was tall and healthily built, with brown hair and blue eyes. Her accent, according to Sherlock, indicated that she had lived as a child in Yorkshire, but she had gradually refined her way of speaking and did not sound out of place in the metropolis. She was dressed modestly and neatly, and she gave every impression of being capable of hard work whilst also attending to the smaller niceties we might require. Her references were impeccable. She and Mrs Hudson got along immediately, and in fact she started her labours for us that very afternoon. I hung the “position filled” card on the front door with great satisfaction.
“It looks like you are kneading dough, which means that you are standing, which is in direct defiance of my orders to stay off your foot.”
“A rather nondescript barrister with a bad chest who had spent the past several years in Canada.”
And then he walked out and left me with an astonished expression on my face.
Oh, right. A disguise.
“You are feeling somewhat better?” I hung up my hat and coat.
It’s another dreary January day, cold but without the pleasantness a bright, cleansing snow sometimes brings to the squalid London streets.  Indeed, it sometimes feels as if nothing will ever penetrate our oily dense as I open my bedroom curtains only to be faced, once again, with a blank, dark wall so thick I cannot see the buildings across the street.  I dress quickly, glumly noting that our gas bill will likely be just as bad as last month’s, given how little daylight we have enjoyed of late.  Not the best start to 1897.
“Yes, so it would seem.  And a rather unusual research he has focused on, as well.”  With one slender finger holding his page, Holmes flips the cover of his book closed and taps the title with his other hand.
“Any simpleton can replicate the process,” Holmes says dismissively.  “One simply purchases white carnations, then adds green dye to the vase of water.  The flowers draw up the colour through their stems.  But their artificial nature is why inverts use it as a signal to identify each other – it’s not something one would wear without being fully conscious of its meaning.”
By necessity I’m standing very close to him, close enough that I can hear the slight hitch in his breath before he repeats “
“A new case?” I ask, as I take my place and settle my napkin across my lap.  Holmes is not prone to reading fiction, so it is likely his book is of a more informative nature.  He has been particularly busy of late, sleeping and eating even less and partaking of his dreadful opiates even more recklessly than usual.  These stresses upon his body have pared even more flesh away from his already-spare frame, and left shadows beneath his dark eyes.  He still seems as focused as ever, but I worry about a new case inflicting additional strain upon him.
"What?" He mumbled, surprised to find John at his side.John chuckled and rested a hand on Sherlock's back.
word, it did horribly wonderful things as it rolled through Sherlock. It made every high he'd ever had seem like a buzz. It made something inside his chest purr and roar at the same time. "Your Master is the only one that came make you feel like this, isn't he?" He asked darkly, bringing a hand to John's hard aching cock. He was rewarded by a soft gasp and a trembling intake of breath. He slowly started to stroke him as his lips moved closer and closer to John's sensitive balls. "Hmm? Has anyone else made you feel like this, John? Has anyone make you feel as good as your Master has?" John groaned again, his nails clawing into his palms more deeply. The sound of that baritone trembling in his sensitive body.
"Four. My brain's not addled Sherlock." He grinned and pulled Sherlock down for a soft kiss. "I'm laughing because this is just us, so bloody us. Both of us scrambling around in the dark trying to help the other without a clue what in the bloody hell we're doing. Because I'm falling apart ignoring that I'm sick trying to take care of you and now you're going to try to pretend you're better than you are so you can take care of me and it's just... Us." He smiled and stroked his thumb over his cheek, staring into Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock couldn't help but smile at John. It was really
"Papa!" Hamish said firmly, pulling on his shirt.
"I think he already knows, but he has never actually said anything. He just makes little statements about how I'm not trying to cuddle him to death or demanding to know why I'm not clinging to him." John whispered, flushing with a bit of guilt but not really wanting to let go. It was just hugs, it wasn't like he was snogging Victor."I like holding you though... It feels comfortable." Without thinking he slid his hands through Victor's hair. "And it makes you relaxed and happy. I'm supposed to keep you happy when he isn't around, those were his orders." He grinned, looking down at Victor as the two of them giggled. "But I will miss our moments like this..." He turned redder but didn't look back up.
"I already have two teenage daughters. It's almost Christmas, Donovan. Have a heart." He snapped and she just fell silent and waved him off. Greg walked out towards the car, biting his lip as he saw Sherlock's fevered pacing and overheard him muttering things like "All my fault," and "Not good enough." He sighed and shifted the boy in his arms carefully. "Sherlock, I hate to ask you this but do you think you can drive us back to Baker Street. I'm holding Marius and I'm afraid he'll wake up if I move him." He explained and when Sherlock didn't immediately answer he sighed. However thirty seconds later Sherlock's attention snapped up to him and he spoke.
"You what?" John's eyes opened and went wide as they did. He blushed more. He never would have guessed that he was part of all the noise in Sherlock's mind. "Wait..." He furrowed his brow as he tried to put things together. "Sherlock, did you start using because..." He shuddered again. "Was it because you started feeling something for me?" He asked it with no ego, almost with a tone of doubt. There was no way he could have been that important. He didn't believe it, but the question worked its way out of his mouth despite it. "I'm still really pissed off. You lied to me for months, you have been high while putting yourself and me in danger on cases, and ruining your health without even asking me, a doctor, about other options. But... It's hard for me to stay full of rage around you. You just look at me and smile or touch me or just have this look when you feel something and don't understand it that just makes me melt. You've wrecked me and unmade me. I'm not the same man I was the first time I walked through that door." He tentatively reached up to touch Sherlock's cheek, shyly. He was afraid of making a wrong move and scaring Sherlock away. Sherlock however, couldn't help but lean into that touch. It made him feel warm and... Well it made him feel a lot of things that for the moment were too advanced of emotional quality for him to name.
John, Greg Lestrade, and the new character Marius - Cay
"Please it..." John's words became grunts and noises as Sherlock slid inside of him. His breath caught in his chest and he trembled hard. "Sherlock," He said his name in such a soft, needy, desperate, and loving voice - less speaking and more like breathing his name. It was so
"Oh go take Lestrade to a hotel and relieve some of that pent up stress of yours, Mycroft." He shot back at his brother. Why would he need more medicine? Sherlock sighed, how long was it going to be like this? Greg came back into the room, a tray filled jam and toast, some tea, and scrambled eggs.
"I know that, but it is hard to watch someone so smart be so stupid. I will try to mind my tongue a bit more." Mycroft finished the tea and poured John a mug, watching him thoughtfully as he drank. He set out cups, plates, and silverware for the four of them waiting for Sherlock and Greg to reappear.
"It isn't your fault." He slipped down so they were lying side by side, his mouth next to Greg's ear. "All of this isn't your fault." He slipped his arms around his husband, letting his body soften as he pulled him close.
"Oh," Hamish said softly, looking a little disappointed. "I would like a brother or sister. Someone to play with." John gave Sherlock a frown that said, "
"Oh I would love to make that little arse blush." John growled and it was perfectly clear he'd thought about it before. "But that's not what you need." He pushed Sherlock down gently, moving his full attention to his neck. He bit, suckled, and nibbled until he knew for sure it would be purple and he could feel Sherlock begging for more, begging for John to touch him more. "I'll forgive you this once. But trust me when I say I will put you over my knee if I have to. Don't move, if you move you'll be in trouble." He growled, moving to the other side of his neck and repeating his actions. He knew how much touching meant to Sherlock and depriving him of it was one of the strongest punishments he could give.
"Oh we have
"I am angry. You didn't tell me because you were worried about me. He made you suffer. I could murder him." He snapped and pulled his shirt off forgetting he had a huge bandage over his shoulder.
Victor had been surprised when his phone chimed. He was sitting in his study looking over some information for a meeting he was going to attend in January. He replied quickly, pleased to finally have heard from the boys.
"Fuck..." John groaned unable to contain his words. He pushed his mouth to Sherlock's almost desperately groaning as he did. His kiss was pure love, pure need. He poured everything into that kiss his heart hammering against his ribcage as he tried to give Sherlock the best kiss he had ever given any of his lovers. "You never have to hold back with me." He whispered barely pulling his mouth away. Sherlock was honestly stunned by how powerful this kiss was. It took his breath away. He gasped when their lips parted for just a second as they continued to kiss. The water may be freezing cold but Sherlock no longer could feel it. Things were starting to warm up very quickly.
"I will not." He said as firmly as he could, already half asleep. "You brought that on yourself. Instead I shall wear a triumphant smirk all day tomorrow while you are reminded of it every time you move."
Hey lovelies! It has been properly brought to our attention that we should warn you about the state of the Baker Street Boys! When we started out here we had no idea the characters would take things the way they have so we have updated the tags and are putting forward this note. Victor does become a part of John and Sherlock's relationship but in a Friend's With Benefits/Crush sort of way. There will be some fun ahead, but Victor's presence is only temporary.
"John do you want to take a shower first?" He offered, draping his jacket over the chair.
"No not you." John said with a soft smile.  "I got your gift ages ago." He assured his husband. Sherlock nodded slowly, searching his mind to make sure John hadn’t forgotten anyone.
"Nothing's wrong. Daddy's okay." Greg lied. "Are you okay, sweetie?" He asked gently, not moving his face from Mycroft's chest because he didn't want Marius to see he was crying.
"Otay. Is she my Nan too?" Marius asked Greg who nodded, as he lifted one end of the kitchen table while John lifted the other, the pair carrying it to the living room.
At that last message John felt his heart give a painful ache and instead of forcing himself to reply, he set his phone aside and turned his gaze to Hamish.
"Yes, they need us to leave." Greg said gently as he stood. "Feel better soon, John." He said as took Mycroft by the arm lead him out the door.
"I... Well fuck he's managed to do it." Sherlock hissed. Of course he wasn't going to let Victor come stay with him. He wasn't insane. But he also didn't want Victor staying with some addict or dealer who would abuse him. He ran a hand through his hair. "What the hell do I tell him? He's not staying here. I'm not going to let him stay here and so that... But I don't want him staying with some dealer pervert either." Sherlock crawled off John and gave a huff.
"Sherlock, I'm not..." He sighed and then laughed. "Isn't this your favorite shirt?" He slipped on the clothes and slid out of the fort, padding into the kitchen. The purple shirt barely fit over his arms, which were thicker than Sherlock's but he wore it all the same. The purple a start contrast against the white undershirt. Sherlock blushed slightly as John turned to look at him. "I just want to make sure that our new flat mate isn't put off by our broken table."
"Have you imagine doing this to me before, John?" He pleaded sounding aroused and needy. He was desperate to know he pleased John. "Am I as good as you imagined?"
"Okay!" Hamish giggled, watching his movie about horses. He was very happy. "Hurry up Daddy! Come get in the fort!" He shouted at John
"Of course, dear." He moved closer to Sherlock, already noticing his husband's behavior. "Sherlock," He whispered. "Are you alright?" He asked with concern and when he got no answered he bit his lip nervously. "Would you like to tell Hamish about how we save people?" He asked, trying his best to bring Sherlock out of his mind. He tried to shift so he could touch Sherlock but he had to hold Hamish to him with his uninjured arm and was unable to reach him.
"No problem, love. Let me know if you need anything else." He just nodded and handed the paper and crayon box to Sherlock who took it, looking a bit puzzled and rather angry. John didn't understand why. He hadn't even registered that the waitress was trying to flirt with him as she pushed things around on the table. He honestly didn't pay attention to anyone who flirted with him anymore, not now that he had Sherlock. "Hamish don't start yet, I'm going to make it snow on your pancakes remember?" He promised as he poured some syrup on them and then grabbed the tiny cup of powdered sugar. "Close your eyes, I'm going to do some winter magic." He said softly, watching as Hamish grinned.
"John, if that is honestly what you think about yourself, I am not being a good... Partner. Well a good anything really." Sherlock whispered. Maybe this was proof he shouldn't be with John. But he didn't care, even if it was he would ignore the proof because he was selfish and he wanted John all to himself. Maybe this problem was fixable, it sounded like it was purely psychological. He wrapped his arms around John and gazed into his eyes. "Before we were together like this, before I left... Every morning you would get up, shower, make breakfast for yourself, and go to work. You'd eat lunch there. And when you came home you'd make dinner or I'd order take away for us." He could see the look on John's face that said 'So?' "My point is that you used to do things for yourself. I used to do things for myself. Now... Since we started to cross into this territory of becoming a couple it's almost as if we move in unison. I move, you move. I shower, you shower. I eat, you eat. We've became one person and I'm worried that it's not healthy." John actually smiled.
"Greg, it's okay." He whispered, kissing his cheek.
Sherlock chuckled, wrapping an arm around John as they started to walk down the stairs. He held John close to himself, a bit protectively. Both of them using unspoken body language that anyone who saw them would understand. Stay away from him, he's
"I can fix it Mrs. Hudson." John called out. "Come back up in a few hours."
When Sherlock woke several hours later, just after daybreak his arms were wrapped around someone. He smiled and hugged that warm body more tightly to himself, his smile bursting into a full grin.
Sherlock." He pulled a needle out of his kit and filled it with the medication, forcing himself into doctor mode. "I... I can't believe you feel like you can't talk to me." His voice betrayed how deeply he was hurt by that. "And I cannot believe you think this is funny." He wiped Sherlock's arm almost carelessly with an alcohol wipe and held his arm firmly within his grasp. He administered the medication without asking for Sherlock’s input, doing it whether he wanted it or not. Though he was somewhat mollified that Sherlock was compliant for the moment. He then stood and moved away from the couch, away from Sherlock, as if it physically hurt to be near him. "I..." He paced, not knowing what else to do but desperately needing to move. "You have the most brilliant mind  of anyone I have ever met, always racing around and trying to figure out everything about everyone, but when someone wants to help you... You just don't care. You push them away! Why do you even want me here if you can't talk to or rely on me?" He clenched his fists again.. His anger forced him to consider that this was it, that his relationship (whatever it was) with Sherlock was over. He picked up his phone and furiously began to type out a text message to Mycroft, his emotion getting the better of him. He typed:
"I started when I was five." Sherlock said firmly, bristling slightly. "My only resistance is finding the right sized violin for him. If I can, I will inform Santa  to bring one for him. What about some biology experiment equipment?" Sherlock asked Hamish who nodded eagerly.
"Really!? I will!" Hamish exclaimed clapping again. "Can we pick out a big tree? Can we get Nanny a prezzie too?"  Sherlock simply smiled a John, his head resting gently on Hamish's as he asked questions.
"Oh that's good..." He panted, running his hands over every inch of Sherlock he could reach, groaning at the feel of Sherlock's body pressing down on his erection. "Fuck Sherlock, yes there!" He grunted as Sherlock passed over that sensitive place again making John's hips buck automatically back against Sherlock's. John wrapped his legs tighter around Sherlock to pull him closer and deeper. Sherlock buried his face in the crook of John's neck, moaning and panting like an idiot but he couldn't care less right now. John was
"I'm glad I met you too." Victor whispered, one of his hands moving up to play with John's hair that was almost as nice as Sherlock's. Victor felt that same thrill of danger in his chest. He knew he was pushing his limits, usually he only asked John for one type of contact - today he wanted them all. "You made me better, you and Sherlock both. But you really helped me. You cared about every little detail. Like the night I was having that awful withdrawal, Sherlock was off at Saint Bart's working on something but you, you stayed right here and held me through it. Even facing his wrath when he came home angry you hadn't answered his texts." He smiled fondly at the memory. "It was awful but you made it all seem so much better. Just like I'm sure you did for him." He nuzzled his face into John's chest, trying to memorize the way he smelled. John shuddered and sighed softly surprised by the nose against his shirt and the fingers in his hair. He'd come to truly love either of them touching his hair and scalp, sometimes it made him feel like a puppy who was getting his head scratched in praise but it always made him melt. He tightened his arms around Victor a little more, sighing contentedly again as he breathed in that somewhat spicy smell Victor carried.
"Naked." Sherlock answered with a weak smile at John. "You have noticed I walk around naked in a sheet, right?" He asked as he watched John dry his hair. "I should think you noticed when we were at the palace." He teased.
what would frustrate Sherlock the most and he wasn't above using it again him. His mind was once again jarred loose of his thoughts and he moaned as John attacked the other side of his neck.
"Papa Myc!" Marius giggled with glee as he brought three pillows that were bigger than him from the closet. "We gotted dem." He said and he shrieked with delight when Mycroft swept him up and took the pillows from him. "I wanna help." Marius said with a bright smile as he watched Sherlock take the blankets from Hamish.
"I don't think we should wake him." Victor whispered to John. "He rarely ever gets this much sleep." He pointed out as he gazed down at Sherlock's sleeping form, he looked truly peaceful and innocent like this. Content and happy, his sentiment easily read on his face. Victor realized he and John were still holding hands and he truly hoped they wouldn't have to let go yet. He enjoyed this. Being near the both of them. It was amazing to be near Sherlock at all but to be near someone who loved Sherlock too, it made him feel like he wasn't completely alone. Especially now that he knew the depths of what John felt. John understood him and still cared enough to want to make things easier for him. "He keeps talking in his sleep. Saying your name mostly." He added with soft giggle. "He has said my name once or twice, though." John smiled and without really thinking about it he gently squeezed Victor's hand.
"God..." Victor forced out a sigh, looking hurt.
"Tell your Uncle that, 'Mish. He started it." Sherlock said wistfully, acting as if nothing happened. John let out a scoff of laughter as he finally felt his breath returning. Greg began to chuckle as well and it took several moments before they stopped.
Already Hamish was walking and talking, he was deducing things about his parents, and becoming more like Sherlock every day. John still couldn't get over how precious it was to find Hamish looking over a Lego crime scene with a magnifying glass. He had adorable dark hair and soft brown eyes, a caring heart like John and enough mischief to make up for it. John was exhausted from trying keep up with the two of them, especially now with the back to back cases, a alarmingly emotionally awkward and confused detective, and a precocious three year old. Not to mention Mycroft and Greg's constant lectures about the two of them continually leaving Hamish with them or Mrs. Hudson to run all over London on these cases that Greg also refused to stop giving them.
"Such a good boy." Victor smiled and ruffled Hamish's hair. "I'm going to go up and see your Dads, yea?"
"Goodnight, Sherlock." John whispered back, still running his hands gently over Sherlock but slowing then over time to let him sink to sleep. He kept his thoughts soft, focused on just being there for Sherlock but it took him awhile before he fully relaxed. He didn't quite catch the moment he drifted to sleep, but he slept lightly - hyper alert and aware so that if Sherlock moved he would be able to jump to action.
"Why don't you go back to bed. I will make sure your Daddy stays happy and sleeps." He smiled, running his fingers through Marius' hair.
." John got up and swept into the bedroom, he rummaged around until he found his jacket and pulled out a flask with some whiskey in it.
"I know you love him." John said softly, rather simply. He stayed out of the way of Victor but didn't leave. He looked up at him as Victor turned back and met his eyes for just a moment. "And I know how that feels to sit there and carry that feeling inside of yourself and believe it will never come back to you. Honestly I really can't see why you haven't beaten me up or something. Because it happened for me and not you and you were there first." His voice was soft, he looked down at his hands. Victor let the break in eye contact allow him to turn away as he headed for the door. "But maybe for now it's okay to just go with the fact he loves you in some way, that he cares enough to throw his own life under the bus to save yours, and let that give you something to be going on with?" He sounded almost hopeful, he was pleading with Victor to not give up. Victor's mind reeled and hurt as it throbbed, trying to understand what this man was doing. "It's not the best solution, I know - and I don't have answers for you - but I know one thing and that thing is that Sherlock Holmes does not give pieces of his heart away easily and if you have even a tiny corner in it you owe it to yourself to be the best human being you can be." Victor was glad John couldn't see him because he would have seen the tears streaming down his face. John was absolutely right it should be enough for him to go with but he could help but feel awfully jealous of him. He was getting to have the thing Victor had always wanted and the only reason Victor didn't beat the shit out of him was because he knew that would upset Sherlock. Which was something he never wanted to do.
"Sherlock! I'd hate to rush you but we need to go!" Greg shouted and when Hamish snapped him for shouting he bit his lip, "Sorry." He mumbled. When John heard the shout, he cringed and covered his ears, his head falling on to Sherlock's shoulder. He gave a whimper, the throbbing behind his eyes hurt so much.
"I said prepare me, you may touch me as you wish. I will let you touch me how you want, but when I say stop you stop. Completely. When I tell you to stop you will bend over that table and present me your amazing arse. Do you understand?" He growled the question, demanding the answer.
“Mummy, why not come hold Stephen’s hand while I get him fixed up? Even pirates can have Mummy hold their hand.”
According to Mrs. Watson—although she did not out of decency use these
Who was it? He had been wondering for days. Sometimes he nearly had it. Sometimes he knew. And then it would slip away again.
So, her first glimpse of the familiar dark curls both thrilled and saddened her. She already knew that his stay would be more of the latter type than the former; the crowd of medical personnel that had paraded into the second-best sitting room had not been encouraging. But now they were done, and she had been more than a bit surprised when he had appeared in the kitchen with a nurse in tow—literally.
—always—
“I sent her after some sausage and things, and I made it clear that she was, absolutely, to return to us. I told her that she did not need to hurry, however—she needs some time to collect herself.”
The government man had rather numbly indicated the samples that he had collected so they could add them to everything that would be tested. “Breathe, Sherlock,” he had murmured to him. “It will all be over soon. You’re safe now.”
“Although—I will confide in you because I do love you, John—” and then, so close to a revelation, his resolve dissolved and he stopped speaking. I was intrigued—and his words “I do love you” sent sensations throughout my mind and body that I cannot even describe... I took a hold of myself.
No. Mycroft frowned in some bafflement. It was neither.
[Sherlock has written, in quite small letters:
“Dangerous?” Solomon echoed.
Then I had begun on the silver. There were multiple forks, knives, and spoons, set fastidiously on either side of the plate. I had no idea what some of the forks in particular were for—I knew there was a special knife and fork for fish, and one type just for oysters. I found it rather ridiculous but I knew that to some people it was terribly important to know which fork was for meat and which for cake.
“It’s about time they sacked her,” the blonde woman added a bit sharply, pouring some milk into his teacup. “It’s the third time she’s done it in six weeks.” She handed him the tea cup.
I settled him against my shoulder and began.
“I’m sorry. I’m not sure what you want. Maybe once we get to know each other better—would you like that? For us to get to know each other?”
“John? Are you well?” He sat up as well and reached his hand out in the darkness, laying it on my chest. “What has alarmed you?”
“She has a houseful—her sister’s entire family is staying a fortnight—including the four boys.”
“Are you sure about this?”
“Obviously.”
But there they were.
“Cap… tain.”
“Yeah. Older brother. This is his house. He’s got some super-secret position in the government. Got these guys in black suits all over—dark glasses, ear pieces.”
“And I to you,” I confessed.
John leaned forward and gently laid a hand on each shoulder. “Love, why did we start ‘this’? Why did we start playing?”
“It’s this damn… excuse me, my dear lady. It’s this abhorrent heat. I was taken over queer at the scene of a very odd break-in and was forced to take my leave of Mr. Holmes mid-investigation.”
Greg thought about that conversation often over the next five years. The young man seated next to him (he started his motor and turned on the car’s heat when he began to shiver) had launched into the most amazing description of his theory—how someone was doing valuations on expensive homes as a way of scouting out small, portable valuables, then hiring people to burgle them (he would obviously be taking note of security systems as part of his assessment), then having the burglars killed off after a few jobs, presumably to keep them from talking, exposing themselves or him, or possibly to prevent pilfering some of the stolen goods and keeping it for themselves. The body that had been discovered that night certainly bore part of that theory out—he still had in his possession one of the six priceless rings stolen two days prior. That the object hadn’t been retrieved was likely due to the killer being interrupted.
[The doctor had apparently numbered the small stack of notes; each had been written on a half sheet of high-quality stationery and folded over. The following is the first note.]
I am grateful for the—for lack of a better word—guards posted in the corridor at all times. Sometimes it is Mycroft’s own servants and sometimes it is strangers experienced in such illnesses. The windows are barred and the doors to the corridor locked. If he was more himself I would not put it past him to obtain egress regardless, but as he is now, he cannot gather his thoughts enough to muster the concentration required to pick the locks.
“There’s a sticker. It says ‘The Perfect Christmas Gift’ with a little ivy frame. Pretty sure they don’t put those on in the summer.”
I needed to think.
I did not allow my thoughts to stray far, however, and praised Sherlock, who had just reappeared with a newspaper with him as well as paper and pencil, so that we might peruse the advertisements already published as a model for our own.
The coffee was warm and fragrant and creamy and sweet.
“Mrs Hudson, you are an angel here amongst the heathens,” I professed—and I meant it. What had Sherlock and I done that was so good that we had earned the care and attention of such a lovely lady? I rose from the bed where I had been seated during our conversation, and then I could not resist. Protocol be damned. I bent and kissed our landlady gently on the cheek.
“Sherlock,” I finally interjected, “have you read my manuscript on your latest case? I wish for you to do so before I send it to my editor.” That was brilliant, if I do say so myself, as he quite obediently went straight to my desk and retrieved the neatly-stacked pages, and he actually did begin to read it. And even though as he was done with each page he simply allowed it to fall to the floor—and he was somehow pacing through the room without looking where he was going—he not only read it through but the endless torrent of words was finally reduced to muttered commentary on the story. Bliss.
“On a Sunday? Did you plan to convert your pounds to American dollars here or upon arrival?”
“Thankfully, nothing too bad—the patient realised it was the wrong tablets before he took any—but obviously it could have been much worse.”
“Yes… oh, John. That is so lovely.”
Anyone could discover with relatively little effort who had been letting those houses at that time; estate agents were generally quite generous with information of that sort. Discovering that the Watsons and the Blooms had been neighbours would not prove anything beyond the manner of our acquaintance.
.” I do not exaggerate when I described the utter loss of colour to his cheeks at these words. He was clearly quite stricken. Still, we all managed proper introductions.
I wonder if I should stretch out on the settee or the bed. I prefer the bed, of course, so I can easily check on my friend during the night. Yes, that is what I will do, and I will encourage our faithful attendant to wake me halfway through the night so that I can relieve him and he might sleep a bit as well.
And one look at the emaciated, wounded, shaking,
“Did they mention how far behind I was on paying my bills?” I was feeling ill. I reached up and pressed my hand over his.
It was china that I was after—china and crystal and silver. Feeling so very helpless in my banishment, I determined to at least use the time to improve my knowledge of the subject at hand. Even if he had already solved it, I wanted to set in my mind a better grasp of these things. For who knows when the information will be needed again?
“I needed time to cool off,” I explained. “I was angry and hurt, and I did not want to exacerbate the situation by expressing those feelings when I was so hot.”
To hear—oh to hear him exclaim, one final time—
“It helps me to focus; you know that,” he added defensively.
He blinked blearily at her. “Bee?” he mumbled.
which cities
what lab?
“Hey, Sherlock—how about you give Greg his gift from us?”
man—how can you consider yourself a decent person when you live with such a creature?” She tugged a handkerchief from where it was tucked into her cuff and dabbed at her eyes.
would do—he wasn’t interested in that bit. He was curious about what
He nodded, and then I became greatly alarmed when he began to rock himself—exactly as a small child, bereft of any other comfort, does. And perhaps this is what caused me to do what I did. I cannot think of any other explanation. “Come over here,” I invited, spreading my arms wide.
I am livid. Sherlock has absolutely pushed me to my limit. I have been astounded at his behaviour these past few weeks, but today he insulted me so cruelly that I very nearly struck him.
So now I stood in the middle of my room, staring down at it as bits of the lovely dream drifted through my mind and wanting nothing more than to wrap my hand around it and bring myself to release.
It did seem to stimulate him a bit; he began to take notice of our surroundings and, as always thrilled me, to explain to me the music that we were about to enjoy. I always got some much more out of our evenings when he did so—I was (and still am not) an expert by any means, but I have found that understanding more about the composer and the pieces did wonders for my appreciation.
?” she said a bit sharply. “I rarely have the opportunity to sit down, let alone put my feet up, until the supper washing up is done. You two create as much work as a household with ten children.”
Sherlock managed to maintain his show of resilience until we boarded the train for London. There, he finally allowed the façade to drop. He brought his feet up onto the seat, wrapped his arms around his knees, and, with his face hidden, rocked. There was little I could do in such a public setting other than pat his shoulder. I could not get us back to Baker Street quickly enough, and longed for the ability to fly.
“I don’t particularly
Matilda’s patient, sprawled out across the mattress, groaned unconvincingly. “Oh, poor you,” she responded lightly. “You’re going to have breakfast with your brother, and you’ve got a nice new suit to wear.”
Then he had the audacity to send me to Farnham myself, claiming that his “research” could not be disrupted.
“Come with me.”
“It was the cook—Mr Woodward—who read the advertisement for an upstairs maid in a very large house here in London and suggested I apply. I got a reference and there I was. It was very different. It was rather horrid, to be honest.”
“Retreating! Leaving. Running away. It just seems rather—please forgive me for being so blunt—cowardly.”
“Yes, John.”
I believe sometimes that spending my life with Sherlock Holmes has done something horrible to my brain and I will never be able to look at a bicycle, or a bell pull, or a china setting without suspicion again.
The sight that greeted me as I crossed the threshold of the always-warm room caused me to take in a sudden, shocked breath. Mrs Hudson was seated at the worn work table—not at all an uncommon sight—but instead of being engaged in chopping or peeling something, she sat with her hands clenched into fists in her lap, and one of her legs was propped up on a second chair.
I could not respond to that; my throat was tight.
and he weeps.
“He did,” I supplied, intrigued as much at the interaction of the two brothers as by whatever it was that Mycroft had reconsidered. “Should I fetch pen and paper and record this moment for posterity?”
“That is more than enough, I should think,” he murmured.
“John Watson, stop being ridiculous. You and he are worse than two children—all the quarrelling and running away.”
“Oh… white bread, bacon—absolutely everything not good for me…. Yes, please.”
This word, however, despite his low tones, rather startled me. “Aroused?” I repeated. “Explain yourself.”
“Oh, yeah. That’s infected, all right. Tell you what. I’m going to clean it out, and then you’ll have to take tablets and keep it clean.”
And was alarmed when the smile suddenly faded.
“Do you think she would be willing?” I wondered.
“How reassuring,” had been the government man’s dry reply. “You’ll be doing proper scans tomorrow?”
“Because that is what I do not understand! it is just my body—it is a tool; nothing more. It allows me to move about—to gather information. It is not… when I am working, it is not… it is not the same as when we are together in that other way. It is not the same thing
Fortunately, due to the sturdiness of British cloth and the dullness of the misused blade, coupled with Sherlock’s unsure, jerky movements, he did not manage to do so much as remove a button. Mycroft made a noise that I can only describe as an exasperated sigh and without hesitation grasped Sherlock’s right wrist in his left hand and adroitly removed the weapon with his right. Without taking his eyes off his brother, he handed it to me, and I instantly closed it and dropped it into my coat pocket.
“He has been admirably solicitous and somewhat calm—somewhat—but I know how upsetting events of this sort are to him.”
Sherlock had not moved a muscle the entire time I was reading, and he did not now, either. He sat bolt upright on the sofa, his head bowed and his hands clasped tightly together in his lap.
“He’s not as careful as he should be about himself, sometimes. Sherlock, sit down and finish your soup. Do you want something else? A pear?”
“So I’ll look like a pirate!”
I was somewhat astounded at the usually stalwart man’s reaction to this light teasing. He hesitated—I have never known Mycroft Holmes to hesitate. But we both kept quiet and he almost instantly recovered his usual haughty attitude and expression.

For the second and possibly more alarming factor was that he dashed our door open with no warning whatsoever—eliciting Sherlock’s ejaculation, complete with the pejorative word “devil,” which was so rare for him. We were fortunate that we were both, having had received our early-morning visitor, completely and properly dressed, and engaged in our conversation with Sherlock in his own chair and I in mine. What if we had not been so keen on the case? What if we had been engaged in a rather more personal conversation—or even more intimate activities?
“I do enjoy your stories, Doctor,” he admitted. “Did you send your latest manuscript off?” (He was referring to the story I had distracted Sherlock with on the day of our “departure.”)
“He flushed. Up his neck and to his ears. He looked down at my hand where it rested on his leg and then at me. Most significantly, he did not object.”
“But…” His voice was tight and I detected the slightest tremble in his thin frame. “I cannot fathom why my activities during an investigation would lead you to… it just makes no sense.”
“That is my point. He is a husband singularly disinterested in his wife, and that is because he prefers to be with men.”
“I am somewhat faint but not bilious,” I assured him as I allowed Mr. Harper to help me up. “It is this damnable heat.”
He sighed and grabbed an apple from the bowl on the tiny kitchen table.
He described, briefly, his upbringing. He was literate and intelligent and at one point had managed a rather large farming estate.
He shrugged in his old, eloquent way, but she wasn’t fooled for an instant. She knew that haunted, pained look in his eyes.
He walked past me, and I was surprised to feel him brush against my shoulder as he made his way to the table reserved for his chemical experiments. “Use my cup,” he offered suddenly. Of course he had followed my train of thought as I examined the contents of the table.
Mrs Hudson’s relating of the beginnings of the life of our new friend had piqued my interest, and now I encouraged her to share her experiences with me as she swept and wiped and beat cushions.
“I see.”
“I see.” I was still not entirely convinced, but it seemed the most likely explanation for Mr. Bloom’s unexpected interjections during his wife’s condemnations. And if it were not true, he would have either professed ignorance or objected vigorously against Sherlock’s declaration that they had an ‘arrangement’. He had done neither.
“But I did,” he admitted, his voice hoarse. “I did not mean that I did not
The doctor laughed and shut his new backgammon set, placing it on the small table next to his chair. He rose and stretched. “Okay. If we’re going to have Christmas dinner before midnight, we’ve got to get going on it. Come on. Into the kitchen with you. You’re doing the chopping.”
“You did too.” John said. “You survived.” He was squeezing Sherlock’s hand hard and the detective placed his other hand on top of John’s.
John restrained himself from blurting, "so do you!"
John scooted closer to his sub and lifted their clasped hands to place a quick kiss on the back of Sherlock’s. “Tired?” He asked.
Sherlock put two pieces of bread in the toaster and went to the fridge, opening the door and bending down to grab the butter. John stared at his arse under those fine trousers and when Sherlock rose, butter in hand, he caught John’s eye and smirked. He always felt a little more submissive after a case was solved. He’d long suspected it was the adrenaline boost and surge of confidence that brought his dynamic to the fore. Sure he wanted to sub at other times too, hence the bouts of self-bondage or even just kneeling by himself in contemplation. He’d been doing that sort of thing for years. Seb never indulged him—was never interested in any kind of bondage or foreplay or ‘scenes’. He only wanted fast sex. Sherlock would never ask him anyway. Sex with Seb was best described as ‘meh.’ The post-case submission was part of his ego wanting to show off to a dom. To John Watson, as it so happened tonight.
“After I finish cropping you, gorgeous, I’ll let you blow me.” John slipped the crop out of his mouth. Watch yourself take it.” John commanded. Sherlock nodded, watching with wide eyes as John lifted the crop and snapped it against his thigh. The little shock of pleasure-pain burst across his face and John almost came from the sight alone. He fisted his hand in Sherlock’s hair, holding him steady and facing his reflection as he snapped the crop across his back and his thighs a few times. More tears coursed down his face and he jerked his hips at every blow. John loosened his hold in his hair, petting his head again.
Sherlock swung his head back around.
“Anytime now.” John grinned at him and Sherlock got on the bed. He straddled John’s thighs, then decided he was too low. He moved up, sitting right on John’s warm bum. Oh yes, this was perfect. His cock jerked and he looked down, contemplating for the first time what it would be like to penetrate his dominant. He tilted his head in thought. Would
" John assured him.
Sherlock
on his knees, staring up at him. He opened his mouth and took his hard cock into his hot wet mouth. Sherlock gasped and fell back against the mantle. The skin on his back screeched in pain but it only made him feel better. John was blowing him?! Doms didn’t blow their subs. It just didn’t happen—doms…oh…John swirled his tongue over the trembling head of his cock and flicked his tongue at the slit. Sherlock stared down at him as the man sucked and licked, rubbing his tongue over the sensitive shaft. Sherlock’s knees quivered and in a few seconds he was spilling into his dom’s mouth. He humped languidly into the pliant heat, reaching down to grasp John’s hair as every drop hit his tongue.
Sherlock rotated his arm. “See?” He bent his arm to prove it.
“John.” Sherlock’s neck flushed and he looked away.
"Ah yes, a friend of mine. He'll be joining us.” He gripped John by the throat. “Get ready, whore. You’ve a long night ahead of you.”
“Flunitrazepam.” Sherlock murmured, reading it. “A date rape drug.”
“John?” He walked in. The dom sat up. “Are you okay?” Sherlock asked.
At this, Sherlock aimed his laser gaze at John. "Afghanistan or Iraq?" He asked.
John nodded, absently touching the two-shot pistol at his hip. It had been a lucky day when they'd robbed King Jim's tax collector who was carrying the lovely little gun. Gun ownership was rare outside of nobility what with gunpowder being such a new and rare and thus expensive commodity. Many a fight had been won by its small but mighty presence with no shots fired.
Sherlock took a step forward, paused, then walked over to him. John spread his knees and took his sub’s arm firmly and guided him down over his right thigh. Most of Sherlock’s torso was supported by the bed. “You’re getting a warm up and then you’re getting the paddle and I don’t want to hear a word of complaint. You use your safe word if you need to, but otherwise I want you thinking about just how foolish this was and why you ended up over my knee.”
Lestrade shook his head and jotted some notes. “You wouldn’t happen to know how long his body parts have been in the water or where the rest of him is, would you? Or if he’s a dom or sub? Anything else?”
Sherlock stepped back. John had never shouted at him like this. He didn’t like it one bit even if a part of him kind of thought he deserved it.
“About a year?” Mike said, thinking. “I ran into him at Bart’s—he’s a good kid, he really is, he’s just, kind of in a bad way right now. Getting better though.”
The longer John stayed in the room, the more interesting he became. Sherlock had already deduced broad strokes of his life and now he had a chance to focus on the physical. John's eyes were a rich, dark blue. His hair was a bit shaggy, the color of sand and honey with grey washed throughout. His expression, tight and neutral when Sherlock had first laid eyes on him, was softer now. An echo of
“Healed plenty enough for you to give it some attention,
John stared at him, horrified at how imposing this idea was.
“There’s a few collar shops that are reasonably priced and have good reviews.” Sherlock showed him a short list of places in London.
“No, no—he’s not ill. Don’t worry.”
"No. I only do it when I get bored." Sherlock said, defensive. "I'm not addicted." He put the tea down and clenched and opened his fist, remembering the loose and limber high floating through his veins. "I'm not."
“I don’t want anything!” John growled. He cracked the knuckles on his fist one by one.
"Hey, it's a family program, don't bring up cherries at a time like this."
“Roofies?” John blinked.
“That hurts!”
"Okay." John nodded. He shoveled the last of the eggs into his mouth.
Sherlock snarled. “You don’t get to decide what cases I take.

Goodness. Not only was he handsome, he was a bloody scientist. John was even more intrigued. The judges wished Sherlock well and John smashed down an excited screech as Paul and Mary and the hosts approached his counter.
Both men let out equally obscene groans of pleasure-surprise. “Excellent.” John leaned over his back, kissing his shoulders and neck and everywhere he could reach. “Well done, love.”
Sherlock paused and looked out the window. He bit his lip and nodded confidently. “Of course. I’ve barely left this flat since coming back from hospital.” He stood and sent a text assuring Lestrade John would be fine. He reached for his coat.
“Don’t you dare!” John pushed him down on the desk, keeping in place with a hand on his back and Sherlock squirmed around. He enjoyed the swats and bucked his leaking cock forward. Any moment now…
“Not by much.”
Sherlock tried. The throb ratcheted up to a burn and he winced, curling it in on himself again.
Two hours later Sherlock was tucked into a luscious Chilgrave guest room with windows draped in fine emerald velvet, a plush feather bed, a roaring hot fire, and thick carpets under his feet.
“Uh-huh.”
"Ulgh!" Sherlock recoiled. The smell would make a skunk vomit.
The warehouse roof was caved in at random spots throughout. A spidery string of catwalks criss-crossed the shadows above them. This place had probably once been a bustling factory. There was a second story overhang area that had a wall of broken windows facing the main floor of the factory. Big bosses likely stood up there in their cushioned offices and surveyed the scurrying workers below. No more. This place had been abandoned by humans for ages and now housed rats, cats, and strays. He stood beside a patch of dying evening sun shining through to the floor like a spotlight. Dee, also dressed in dark clothes, pulled open a purple velvet bag with gloved hands. She extracted the emerald and gold necklace and held it into the light. It sparkled.
change.” John added. It was like this guy had been talking to Ella, which for all John knew he actually had.
Sherlock scrubbed a hand through his hair and paced in the sitting room. John had nearly died. The first good thing to come into his life in ages and he damn near loses it in the blink of an eye and a hard jab with a spear. His heart hammered his ribcage and his bones vibrated in tune with it. Tonight could have gone very badly indeed and Sherlock realized to his dismay that he
“There’s a great deal of protein in semen, despite the taste,” Sherlock began conversationally. John grunted and spread his hand across Sherlock’s damp back, pulling him close and attacking his other nipple.
"Alright?"
He was surprised when John came over to him, knelt before him on the hard tile, and hugged him ferociously around the legs. Sherlock rested his free hand in his dom’s hair and looked down at him.
John glanced over his bottom. It was splotched bright pink, vivid and neon. Time to talk. “Let’s talk about why you’re getting the paddle.” John began. “I’m sure you know—genius that you are—but let’s humor me. Tell me why you’re here.”
“The one?” Sherlock spoke as if he had a bad taste in his mouth. “Surely you could find anyone to grovel for?”
“Henry and Kate, you’re serving the Marquess and Marchioness of Burgundy in the emerald room. Paulette, you’re serving the Baroness Hilma Gustavsson in the diamond rooms…”
He sensed John step up close to him. He relaxed when John wrapped his arms around him in a gentle hug.
John blinked, a hint of genuine amusement crossing his face before he schooled his features back into something stern. “Oh, you are getting punished for
“Mycroft said you’re in Defense.”
"There's worse things you could be doing." John said reasonably. "Giving gifts to kids? Making them happy?"
“I know. I wanted to, but then so much time passed. He stopped sending them for a bit and I thought he was done, but then…”
"Yeah okay." John sipped his brew. It would be fun to catch up with Mike and meet his dom. It would help him get out of his head and make him feel more normal in any case.
"I'm sure he'd say the same." Mary winked at him and John was instantly mortified.
John was quiet for a second. "Would you like to try the cherry filling? I have some extra." He scraped it off the bowl with a spoon and held it out to the other man. He thought Sherlock would take the spoon, but instead he simply ate directly off of it. Some dripped down his chin and John laughed, handing him a napkin.
“Leave it there. If I catch you at those filthy habits again, you’re getting a bare smacking over my knee, understand?”
“Yes I will.” Sherlock pulled away and went down the steps. John peeked through the window and watched him hail a cab and disappear.
“What?” The doctor looked up.
Sherlock threw himself over John’s thighs and sighed when his dom added more cool lotion to his backside.
His horse had other ideas. It had just about enough of all this business of walking in the woods and decided to show Sherlock the exit. It bucked up, lashing out with its back feet.
"No, thank you! Everyone is just getting settled in."
Sherlock stared at John’s dark, dark eyes with his own mouth open in shock. His dom’s lips were red and his face was flushed. He was taking deep breaths and he was hard in his jeans. Sherlock wondered how long he’d been in Defense. “I’m fine.” Sherlock assured him. “Let’s go.”
Apologies in advance for any incorrect German translations.
Seb’s voice shook as he said,
“Someone’s unhappy about being punished.” John said.
“Does anyone else hear a dog barking?” Sherlock said, his voice pointed and sneery as he glared at the other man.
“Good.” John kissed the top of his head just as Mrs. Hudson came up the steps and through their open door.
“What about your clothes?” John said with a small smile. “I don’t want you to throw off your whole life for me.”
The sub let out an aggravated sigh.
good.” John said. There were no prices on the menu. The only two options were a list of six vegetarian dishes or six non-vegetarian dishes.
“—Don’t tell me, ta. No,” his voice got quiet. “It was some blood play and cutting. Some asphyxiation. Some whipping—pretty hard whipping. It was all legal though. I was a member of some certain clubs that catered to…specific tastes…but not anymore. Not for a long, long time.”
“What would you guys do together?” Sherlock asked.
to make him shudder, or how to suck on the spot just under his collar to made his cock twitch higher. John pressed little kisses over his face and fingers and he grinned at the wide dark circles that his sub’s pupils had become. John slipped two slick fingers into Sherlock’s bum and tickled his prostate, making him gasp and shiver and claw for more contact. When he couldn’t take anymore he lifted his legs and curled his toes and clutched John close, whining and reaching for his cock.
"Who?"
Sherlock nodded hard and went to fetch it.
He reached his hand through the gap and found an old bit of rope hanging there. He tugged it and the door gave a feeble creak. Standing, John put his weight against the thing and shoved. It shifted and some dust fluttered down into his hair. He pushed on it again, this time grunting at the effort. It squeaked and sprang open and John went down on his knee from the force of it. Mildewy damp air and cobwebs brushed against his face and he scrambled back and went silent, listening. There were no sounds behind him, no footsteps coming to investigate. Nothing coming out of the void-black space in front of him either. Curious, he crept forward again, heart pounding. He could hear…voices? He slipped silently forward on tiptoe, moving very slowly into the dark space. He nearly tripped down the two stairs he encountered and it was then that he saw it: a tiny crack of light coming out of the floor in the corner.
“Go on in the bedroom. I’ll put the ointment on and then maybe you can nap?”
“Mmm, let me look you over. That’ll help.”
A little voice in his head asked.
Sherlock had left this morning and he could be gone for days, even
"Well, thanks, but I think Sherlock did the heavy lifting on this one."
An arrow whizzed out of a nearby tree. John recognized the fletching Mot and Dot used. It sank into the guard’s shoulder. As if on cue the carriage doors flew open and a stream of armed Hibernian guards flooded out. John swore. There were too many. The last payroll carriage hadn’t been guarded this well. At most his team had encountered two or three guards. Never five—no, six. They all had guns. In no time at all John’s team was overpowered. Guns were no match for knives and bows.
“I don’t think you are. I think you might need a punishment.”
“No, no, son. Come on in.” Coel stepped aside and Sherlock gave him a watery look.
“John?” Sherlock blinked at him and came closer. He took his hands, looking concerned. “Was it the sushi?”
“Barring that, there’s always glitter and gold tassels.”
Curiosity won out and he went back to the door-wall. He ran his fingers over the wooden slats, searching for a weak spot, a hinge, something that would mean there was more to this wall than what met the eye. He felt along the bottom and up one side and found nothing but rough, solid wood. Frustrated and feeling stupid he thumped his fist on it. A neat square chunk of it fell away, through the wall and clattered to the other side. The noise of it echoed and John licked his lips. What was this space? No light shone through the little break in the wood and John carefully crouched and peered through the fist-sized hole. It was completely dark on the other side but there was definitely a room of some sort in there.
“Leave me alone.” He growled. He grabbed the phone, intent on hurling it across the room, but saw Lestrade’s name on the display.
“You’re too overdressed for this, love.” John undid the buttons on his shirt and pulled it off his arms, yanking it away and flinging it on the floor. His cock was stiff and ready and he growled under his breath, nibbling Sherlock’s exposed neck and tweaking his nipple. Sherlock yelped in surprise and John broke the kiss and reached for his trousers next, tugging the button open and yanking the zipper. He stood up and pulled Sherlock to his feet, holding him by the bicep as he tugged his clothes down in jerky pulls. Sherlock stepped out of them and John guided him firmly to the sofa on his front. The detective licked his lips, his sweaty fingers finding the edges of the cushion. He way John was breathing and handling him, Sherlock could tell he was very aroused and feeling very dominant. He was pleased and surprised to find he was a little nervous, a little excited. His cock was flickering to life. John leaned over his shoulder, breathing across his neck and palming his backside.
“Sure.” John said, “Or—you wait outside the door, like it’s my office, and then I’ll call you in? Does that work?”
So far, John didn’t know about the texts and Sherlock intended to keep it that way. He’d debated briefly about telling him but reasoned it wouldn’t do any good. John couldn’t stop Seb from sending them and it would only irritate him to know that he was getting these messages. He’d probably get jealous, and Sherlock didn’t want him jealous. Seb was always edgy and defensive about other doms, threatened by Lestrade and even
“So you decided the best place was the floor?” Mrs. Hudson scolded. “Sherlock, this silk is expensive!"
yes.”
Jim said smugly.
“Do you want to hit Sherlock like you did these other submissives, Doctor Watson? Do you want to make him bleed?”
“You and your checking.”
"The auction tonight, your name’s on the list.”
“Damn right!”
John tossed a folded chenille blanket on the floor in front of his sub. “So you have something soft under your legs.” He murmured. He wedged it under his knees. It was denser and much softer than the rough carpet. “Better?” John asked.
“Yep.” She said. “I don’t know how much was in his system initially, as the body had been in the water for so long. Evidence of fifteen milligrams of it were found in Owen’s tissue. Dixon’s limbs didn’t have traces of anything.”
“Jealous doms losing their tempers.” Sherlock growled, satisfied. “Jilted lovers are so stupidly predictable.”
John caught his gaze in the mirror and winked and Sherlock smiled around his toothbrush before spitting and rinsing in the sink. They made breakfast together. John didn’t know where everything was in the kitchen, and Sherlock gathered items as requested for him to cook. With both of them working on the meal, it was done quickly and they were soon sitting at the desk in the sitting room with cups of coffee and plates of food. John took another headache pill and tucked in hungrily, making happy noises about the eggs and tomatoes.
“Cancer. Liver, spleen. Spine.”
“No.”
“Alright?” John supported his bicep as he stood, stretching his long legs and flexing his toes.
John pointed at the screen. "This is funny though. You might even like it."
“How many people work in this garage?”
Eight, seven, six…
“No.”
His eyes went wide and his mouth dropped open. She wiped her eyes. His voice was hoarse and he pulled her into a fierce hug. “So am I.”
Paul examined the burnt dry petit fours and John wanted to sink into the ground.
“Of course.” Sherlock murmured. Damn. It would have been interesting to see if he could perform some sort of pain-perception experiment while John was spacing, but no matter.
“Would he have wanted you to kill subs?”
Mycroft gave him a fake smile. “John. Your request is duly noted.” He nodded, twirled his umbrella, and left the flat. Sherlock stood up and locked the door behind him.
She hummed, intrigued, and went into the sitting room with the plate.
The man turned to him and smiled. His crystal blue-green eyes glanced him up and down. "I suppose." His shoulder went up in a shrug.
An hour must have passed because he heard familiar steps banging up the stairs. The door opened. He didn’t move. John set his bag and down and wandered over, looking down at him from above.
"What are you two up to later? Molly asked once they'd exchanged pleasantries.
Thank you, readers! I love the kudos and kindness <3
“Yes it was bloody awful and he’s a terrible—” He stopped chewing and looked at her. “Wait—how do you know I got punished?”
John smiled. “You’re right about that.”
“John? Is he alright?” Betsy followed.
“Sherlock.”
"Is what?"
"What do you do, Sherlock?" John asked, popping a toasted carrot in his mouth.
made something sad and ugly appear in his heart. He pushed the feeling away. Dwelling on the past or future was useless here. There was only today. Every day he only had to get through today.
"Of course." Sherlock nodded and stepped back as if  he'd been the one inconveniencing John. He unpacked the rest of Sherlock's things.
"John‒" Sherlock's voice was pitched slightly into a whine.
John smiled bitterly. "Lucky me, hm?"
“She was always gettin’ at me, sayin’ I weren’t a real man.”
“Yes.” John’s smile put the sun to shame. “Yes, I will move in here.”
Sherlock carefully moved the cooked biscuits to a wire rack and John noticed his bowls of black and yellow icing. They looked a little lumpy and worryingly runny but he said nothing.
“Bored.” Sherlock mumbled.
"Mmm. Would you do my back?" Sherlock held out the sponge.
"No. And I don't much want to talk about it."
"It didn't rise!"
Sherlock made a face and pushed his plate away. "I think I'm going to be sick."
The End
"Naturally." John sipped his coffee. He couldn't believe his genius flat mate was devoting this much brain power to such a ridiculous notion. It was kind of cute.
"Gonna decorate the flat. It's already the 4th and we don't even have a tree."
comfort. He rubbed lotion into sore skin and checked how tight the ropes were. He was fine with cuddling in bed and the days spent together were strewn with sweet little touches—a hand on his waist, brushing hips, a nuzzle into his neck or a kiss on the cheek, often accompanied by the words ‘gorgeous,’ ‘amazing,’ ‘fantastic’ and the like. That Gordian Knot of feelings that was so constricting a few weeks ago had unraveled and his view of John in his life was much clearer now.
A rusty, grimy red barge that was big enough to carry half the buildings on Baker Street was idle in the brown water. A narrow, long ramp wrapped with yellow crime tape led from the shore to the boat’s dock and Sherlock breezed past the milling officers with barely a glance, thumping up the ramp. John nodded to them and bounded after his sub.
“There we are. You’re free to go to your palace now.” John stroked his hand over his back. “Sally was wrong, you know.”
Molly leaned in to whisper to John, “he’s not that bad. Paulette saw him last and he didn’t make her do anything as bad as all that.” Paulette had only been with them for a few weeks before she was sold at the auction.
The boys go shopping. An old 'friend' makes a visit.
“Oh dear, I know that wince.” She winked at him and sat down in John’s chair. “Was he rough on you, love?”
John clenched his teeth and said nothing.
“Is Melissa dull?” John asked. She smiled as she pumped the cuff.
“He’s fine. Long story short—he decided to take a walk and now he needs to be picked up. Thanks for the meal Betsy, I’ll call you guys tomorrow?”
"Fold everything." Sherlock said. John did, the corners of his clothes crisp and neat and military. He set them on the bed and then stood at attention, awaiting orders, and it was here that Sherlock paused. What now? What should he have John do?
“You alright?” John asked.
“I won’t need it—you won’t do anything I don’t like.”
“Thank you.”
John was knocking on Ella’s door an hour later.
“No.”
John stared at him, his water glass halfway to his mouth.
Sherlock suddenly kissed his cheek and the doctor blinked in surprise.
“Yes, good, and I’ll not tolerate it. Why
“You couldn’t just
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Jim started walking away, Sebastian beside him, and John was more or less ignored. He blinked in the watery sunlight. What about his own noose? A horrible thought popped into his head. Jim was cruel and insane enough to have something worse in store for him. His team, God rest their precious brave souls, had gotten off easy.
“And yet you live?” Sherlock’s voice was awed and amazed.
She nodded and took it.
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, John.”
Sherlock shivered and lowered his head further. John licked his lips and leaned forward to reach lower. The water was steaming hot and John was starting to sweat. A slight shiver danced down Sherlock's spine and John’s throat went dry.
John nodded, agreeing with everything they were saying. "Thank you." He nodded. It had hardly been his most successful signature bake, but they had at least liked the flavor on the parts they could eat.
, he reasoned. He didn’t share his feelings easily with strangers. Sure, he’d been seeing her since he came back to London, but he could never open up fully. Maybe he just didn’t want to.
She smiled. "Ta, Mrs. Hudson." She turned and strode away.
Mycroft took a fortifying breath. “Be reasonable. It’s a fine day.”
"No! I refuse to do that!" He leaped out of bed. Someone had put a pair of loose cream trousers on him. He was glad of it. Shouting at his brother while naked would take the heat right out of his anger. "You can't force me to stay here like a prisoner and I refuse to go to Hibern! I hate that odious little toad and I…I'm the Prince!" It was a weak argument and Sherlock knew it.
“Will be fine.”
"Who cares about decent?" He grumbled. He finished the rest of the tea.
He stopped and stared at John.
"Er, no!" John blurted. "No, I'd…rather be anywhere but in the herana."
John gradually relaxed as the stream of facts stamped out his panic and he gradually, horribly realized where he was and what he was doing.
“I don’t want to hear another word about it unless it’s your safeword.” John told him.
“Good boy.” He said. Sherlock looked up at him and grinned, then glanced at the items on the table and blinked.
“Tosser.”
John laughed. "I will."
"Oh it was delightful. He's such a gentleman." She giggled. "So generous in bed. Clean. He's attentive and easy on the eyes, you know? It won't be for much longer though." She said sadly.
"Pass out on your stomach." Greg said. "I'll put ice packs on your back for the swelling." Greg went out to the kitchen. John had told him to do whatever necessary to keep Sherlock comfortable, and Greg appreciated the trust the dom was placing in him. He vividly remembered a Defensive John beating a serial killer unconscious and Greg didn't want to do a damn thing to provoke that wrath. He opened his freezer and moved a frozen pizza and an ice tray aside and found two blue ice packs. He wrapped them in tea towels and stopped at the hall closet enroute back to the bedroom to pick up the sage colored blanket Sherlock liked to use when he slept here. He tucked it under his arm.
John stared at her profile picture. “Tell me you didn’t get all that from
"Mmm. A couple wouldn't be amiss."
“I….the footage.” Sherlock lifted his head out of the pillow. “I need to see if Dixon is there….”
“Yes?”
Greg nodded, feeling immensely proud of both of them.
They both smiled and John went back to his work space. He separated and flattened his dough, then added the basil and cheeses. Satisfied, he covered it with a tea towel and placed each into his proving drawer and hoped to God it would rise. He set the timer for forty minutes and allowed himself a short break and a swig of water. Sherlock was still working at a blazing pace and John wanted to help him. Doing so would certainly get him disqualified though, so he kept his distance and smiled when Sherlock snuck a glance at him.
hungry. He thought for a moment, consulting with his stomach, then, “do you want
“About…?” Sherlock leaned away from him.
“Not true.” John said. “The police like it. I like it.”
John had no idea what Sherlock’s issues were. Mike had just said he was abused. An old firey anger awoke deep in his soul, the same one that made him shoot the cabbie and the one that sent him to the desert. John very much wanted to hurt Sherlock’s old dom. Hurt him slowly in a way he wouldn’t recover from. That wasn’t the important thing now though—the important thing was to focus on Sherlock and earning his trust.
“Does the Equivo help?”
“You might not know it yet, but you will.”
“Because….because you’re just a stand-up bloke.” Mike shrugged. “Always liked you.”
"Dear, I suggest you start speaking normally again, your Papa can only handle you using improper grammar for so long." John said with a chuckle as he held both mugs of hot chocolate firmly in his hands. "Come on, you two can have it in the fort. Do you want to watch a Christmas movie?" He asked them as they all walked into the living room.
"Talk to me Sherlock, please."
"Rest," Sherlock said in a whisper. "I'll just be out in the living room so I don't keep you two awake." He promised, he needed to pace and he couldn't do it in here.
"He'll get bored if we keep arguing." He said softly, smiling wide.
"A Christmas tree." He smiled.
"What?" Sherlock grunted, opening his eyes. He sat straight up, confusion straight on his face. His face hurt from the imprint his finger had left and he was very groggy. Hamish giggled more, watching as Sherlock winced a bit. He fell back on the bed, groaning and wrapping himself in the blankets.
Sherlock smirked as John said he wanted to dominate him again, wearing that amazing uniform he hoped. His heart fluttering at the thought, oh he would love to do that again. If John wanted hell he'd be willing to start all over again right now. That was how much he loved being with John. How much he enjoyed seeing how deeply John enjoyed being Captain Watson.
"You can always sit on my shoulders, Mish." John said happily helping his little monkey climb up on top of his shoulders where he held him carefully. He looked over at Sherlock with a smile. "Do you remember how tall our last one was? I ask because last year it was bit small and I think we can go another foot or two." John said, simply thinking out loud as they began to walk around the many rows of Christmas trees. "Hamish, do you want to put the star on top like last year?" John asked with a bright smile, looking up at his son.
"Oh you two..." Mycroft sighed darkly. "You have to stop this, Greg. You did what you could do. The trail went cold and you couldn't pick it back up until a year later. You've done everything you could with what you had. It isn't your fault that people died. You can't save everyone. You stopped them, no other children will suffer like Marius and Hamish have. Everything will be okay. You two will bring the ring down and things will go back to being a little more normal."
." He kissed John's lips softly as he pulled out with a bit of a whimper, "I love you." John grunted slightly at the emptiness left behind when Sherlock pulled away.
"Well you're doing a shit job." John forced out, gripping Sherlock's hand tightly. "Let us have a little time. Come back tomorrow morning and we will talk about this like adults okay?" John pleaded. Mycroft crossed his arms, he wanted to solve this now. But a look from Greg made him think better of it.
"Being with you turned me naughty." John said with a giggle before he weakly pressed his lips to Sherlock's. "I love you too. Don't ever doubt that." He whispered, still completely breathless and shaking. "I love you, you're the most wonderful husband in the world." He rubbed their noses together softly.
John wasn't sure what they had in the kitchen but he really wanted to make something for Sherlock. So rummaged about for a bit before finding enough of something to make a decent meal out of. It took about twenty minutes but he managed to finish his work and brought Sherlock a fairly simple meal of chicken, rice, and a very small amount of peas. Sherlock meanwhile had managed to feel alright while John was away in the kitchen but he did begin to feel a bit cold. He wrapped himself in the heating blanket, listening to and watching John work as best he could from his vantage point.
"He never touched me romantically." Sherlock assured him with a smile as he hugged John tightly to him. "He tried to," he mumbled. "But he never pleasured me. He never got to see my skin. He's never got to touch me and hear me the way you have." His soft smile turned into a smirk as he kissed John a little harder. "Maybe I really should get that tattoo to make you feel better," He teased.
"Which Grinch? The old Cartoon?" Greg asked curiously and Marius shook his head.
"It's okay, 'Mish." Greg whispered in Hamish's ear when he noticed his eyes start to water a bit. Marius had noticed what Greg was saying and at first he thought he was talking to him, but then he peeked over to see that Hamish was upset. Why was he so upset? He hadn't lost his Mummy and Daddy. Marius furrowed his brow as he watched them. Oh, but he had. Marius remembered now, he’d said so. He frowned and squirmed out of Mycroft's arms muttering
"I can get it for you, John." Greg suggested softly, but John shook his head.
"If I have a concussion I shouldn't sleep." He said with a frown. He wanted to sleep. He felt like that would help. He hugged Hamish close, running his fingers through the boys' hair in an effort to ease him back into sleep.
"Why the military look John, are we going to war?" Mycroft retorted sarcastically.
." Sherlock growled.
John let out a breathless laugh.
"I had word from Donovan a few minutes ago that they caught the murderers. That's all she had time to tell me as she went to the scene. I expect they'll be home soon." Mycroft said softly, intentionally leaving out the news that Sherlock had been slightly injured. John could worry about that when Sherlock returned in one piece. The living room was dimmed except for the lights on the tree which Mycroft had already strung up. He grabbed a few of the pillows from the bed, calling Hamish over. Hamish took two of them and set them on the couch waiting patiently beside it for John to come lay down. "Lunch is available whenever you're hungry. Hamish has already eaten and is eager to have his Daddy resting by the 'pretty tree.'" He motioned to the couch.
"You're going to kill us if you drive any faster, Gregory." Mycroft said as he gripped the door with one hand and his other hand holding his phone tightly. "Slow down. Having us get into a car crash will not save anyone's life."
"I'm hoping it's gotten better but I have yet to learn how to make that man tell me what he's thinking. How do you get Victor to do it?" Sherlock grinned. "I'm sorry if it bothered you that John did that. I never really thought they would bond the way they did." Sherlock flushed slightly.
"FUCK SHERLOCK!" John shouted, completely unable to restrain himself. Whatever he had expected Sherlock to do, that was not fucking it. His mind sputtered to a halt and went insanely blank. It took all he had not to grab onto Sherlock and move, his hips fighting not to buck up into Sherlock as he worked. "Oh my God, what the... Sherlock!" He whimpered and groaned, thrashing his head slightly.
"I can't help you if you hide from me. You know this is difficult for me but I am trying." He said it a bit too firmly but held Greg closer. Trying his best to keep his body soft as he held his husband tightly and ran soothing circles over his back. "They died because the killers were clever. Because the men who did it were evil. Not because of you." Greg heard the hurt in Mycroft's voice and he saw through the imagine Mycroft so carefully built for the public. He saw down to the heart of his husband and realized he had hurt his feelings.
"Not if I can help it." John smirked slightly but coughed again, looking up to meet Victor's gaze. "We're all adults here. I know what happened was bad and it means I'm not going to be leaving the two of you alone together any time soon but if Sherlock doesn't want you gone then Mycroft has no right to make that decision. This is our flat, we pay the rent." He leaned over and put his head on Sherlock's shoulder without thinking about it. Sherlock smiled softly and carded his hands through John's hair.
"Oh! Your little doctor got you walking a straight line now, yea?" He chuckled darkly, teasing Sherlock. "And here I thought he was the reason you were using again. Isn't that what you said? You started to care about him and you tried to use drugs to block those feelings out. So what did he find out or something?" Victor laughed again. "No, your idiot brother told him didn't he? Set your little guard dog on you. So what, is he
"Yes, Sir." He whispered. Sherlock bit his neck and Victor moaned. "Yes, Sir." He said loudly his eyes fell on John from across the couch. John was still completely overwhelmed which meant Victor could dominate him. He licked his lips and reached for him but Sherlock pinned his arms above his head.
"If it wasn't the truth you'd have lumped me in with Lestrade and the others the second day you knew me." He grinned. "Yes, I remember you kept talking about that for awhile after we got home." His eyes burned into Sherlock. "It isn't fair the imbalance of power in our relationship." He giggled softly, already aware that Sherlock's single touch to his hair completely derailed his mind. Sherlock gazed down at John with a smile.
"Oh, thank you darling." Greg smiled and gave Mycroft a quick kiss on the lips while Sherlock wasn't looking. "Well, we're all finished up here. Nothing left in John's room unless he had things hidden underneath the floorboards." He joked as they all walked back downstairs. Sherlock took a seat next to John and rested his head on his shoulder attempting to remain indifferent but coming off as possessive.
"He does sound happy, doesn't he?" Mycroft said softly. He closed the book and took Greg's hand in his own.
"What?" John said, pretending he had no idea what Victor was even talking about. "Nothing's wrong. I don't know why you're even asking. I'm happy, Victor." He insisted and he moved closer to give him a tight hug, sighing when Victor wrapped his arms around him. This was what he needed. This was what was wrong but he could never admit it.
"Hm, bring clothes." Mycroft smiled.
"Have a nice life, Sherlock."
"Oh lord, he would kill us both just for having considered it. We can't... But... I'm glad to know you care that much." He put his head on Victor's shoulder to stop himself from the train of thought banging around his head. Victor was a crush, Sherlock was his soul mate. "Well we do like to live dangerously and madly don't we?" He smiled, his hands never leaving Victor. Victor chuckled and nodded.
"Kitchen, furthest cupboard to the left inside the cereal box." He answered without thinking. John tried not to sigh but could not hide his emotion and Mycroft retrieved the box with disdain on his face.
The heat pooled in Sherlock's eyes as he held John's for a long moment before Hamish started to squirm. A small smirk playing on Sherlock's lips. John felt his breath slowly starting to return to normal as Sherlock spoke.
Victor loves Sherlock but has come to understand that he is not ever going to have his heart. So he basically takes what he can get.
"Yea! A palm tree!" Hamish squealed and tackled Marius in a hug. Marius giggled and fell back on the bed with Hamish.
"I saw you!" Marius said from the bottom of the stairs.
"You have one of da funny looking palm trees. Da leaves are geen."
"You would now. Before I had to make ups silly excuses to make you come home to me." He grabbed John's arms and carefully wrapped them around himself. "I do feel a tad guilty for making your dates dislike you. But I couldn't stop myself. I didn't want you out with them and I didn't know why or how to make it stop. I probably should have said something but that was before I properly knew I had feelings for you."
John finally heard them go upstairs and he quietly exited the bedroom. He couldn't be in there anymore, it was driving him insane. He moved first to his chair in the living room but it was no better than the bedroom. He moved instead into the kitchen, pulling a chair in the corner and wrapping himself tightly into it - so that all he could see was the kitchen. But within ten minutes he started cataloguing all of Sherlock's experiments and tools. It became too much for him again so he opened the door to the stairs and curled up in the corner of the landing, looking blankly at the wall. He curled up as tightly as he could, digging his hands into his palms as he rested his head on his knees and he sobbed quietly.
Sherlock paused, thinking, then—“dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane.”
They had told Mycroft and Harry about the engagement, as well as all their friends. Mike and Betsy of course were thrilled and excited for them. Betsy had cried. Lestrade was overjoyed and Molly shrieked at the news. Mrs. Hudson hadn’t stopped smiling and she promised to bake them a cake and a massive meal to celebrate. Mycroft and Mike were witnesses at the register office when they signed the papers that said they were now an official couple. John wore the smart blue Hugo Boss suit at Sherlock’s bidding and the detective wore a tailored Dolce & Gabbana number that did amazing things for his curves. Mike gave them both a hug when they signed and Mycroft congratulated them, sneaking a glance at his pocket watch.
“I wanted them to be the same.” He said. “Because we’re the same, in this. In marriage. Partners.” Suddenly it sounded insanely cheesy. “I guess…” He muttered.
“Alright, calm down.” Greg said. The last thing he needed was John going in Defense. “He probably took him to The Broads.”
“Sherlock.” John glanced at him. “Yes you do. I’ll help you sit up.”
Lestrade whirled around. “You will not argue with me anymore. Either go to Mudd with Sally, or don’t work this case at all.”
"Good afternoon, your Majesties." John said in a dull, neutral tone.
“Ah, Holmes.” Donovan sauntered up to them and the mechanics eyed her lustily. “Boss told you to wait.” She said, ignoring them.
“Mrs. Hudson? I’d like you to meet Betsy Hannigan. She and Mike introduced Sherlock and me.”
John’s phone chimed. He pulled it out of his pocket. Sherlock.
“I’m going to run up and drop the bag and look for that coupon.” John patted his jeans, looking for his keys.
"How long are you leaving it in?" His voice was a touch impatient and John collected his thoughts. "Oh, uh, forty minutes?"
"Really?" John said, remembering the gossip in the herana. "Never?"
“So I wake up and there’s a guy in this place with me.” He swallowed. “He had a black mask on, so I didn’t see his face. He had knives. I was tied down.” He added quietly. “There was a lot of blood. He looked over at me and came to me with a knife.”
“He’s fine! He said so himself.”
“Sally’s not back yet.” Lestrade said. “Any luck at Mudd?”
“Arse.” John muttered.
John was strolling up Baker Street to do some food shopping that afternoon, whistling. He had a very satisfied submissive at home currently in his mind palace and they were both feeling much better than they had been yesterday evening. Sherlock hadn’t been nearly as pissed off at him and he’d feared, and rubbing the cream on him had helped immensely, as had breakfast. He hoped they were back on the road to a good place.
The scent, miraculously, seemed to be expanding like a mushroom cloud. Gone was the light mint and in its place was an industrial factory chemical reek that had only ever dreamed of candy canes.
He pulled on white smalls and a long tunic. The brilliant white fabric was soft from use and he liked the way it settled on his sensitive skin, the silk and cotton blend light as air. Black stockings and trousers came on next. He pulled a pair of bespoke, velvety black shoes on his bare feet, the interior soft and fleecy and good for walking around indoors. He found a tunic, striped in alternating shades of dark blue, and threw it on over his head. He didn't bother to lace up the neck. There was no need to look his best. It was just Mycroft. He found an embroidered cloth belt flung over a chair where he'd last thrown it and tied it sloppily around his waist. He mashed the sodden licorice root around in his clean mouth and went to the ensuite bathroom. He tossed the used stick through the toilet seat where it would fall several floors and float towards the moat surrounding the palace before carried off into the Thames. He rinsed his mouth clear using a fresh pitcher of water a servant had brought in. He splashed some on his face and, invigorated, wiped himself dry.
“Did he say anything to you?” Lestrade asked.
"Why has it been so long since you took a case?" John asked, trying to steer the subject away from the police. "Did you go on holiday?"
Jaffa Cakes hadn’t been the only thing he was out shopping for this morning.
“Nope. Called me ‘some cook’ and said their son wasn’t going to marry down. Posh bastards. Anthony wasn’t like that.”
"If you must." Sherlock put the mug up on the counter and stood, wincing and bracing himself on the edge to lever up.
“John!” Sherlock rolled onto his belly and grabbed one of his ankles. “I’m so bored!” He wailed into the floor.
“I’d rather stand.” John growled.
He sent it off, then followed that with another one.
"Oh." Greg blinked. "We'll let Mel know."
He hissed, trying to squirm away from the burning sting of the knife.
“He does stuff for his cases there. He uses the equipment in the labs.”
Sherlock was wearing his black Gucci suit, dark grey shirt, and fine black leather shoes. A black beanie was pulled over his hair and he'd purposely let his stubble run wild to complete the disguise. His character was a dominant stock trader with more money than sense. He was attempting to appear wealthy enough to purchase multi-carat stolen diamonds, but new enough to a life of crime to be a bit naive about the whole thing.
John took his hand and brought him to the bedroom. They slipped off their shoes and got in bed, Sherlock snuggling into John’s side in the almost-dark of the room. The dull yellow lamps outside made the curtains a sort of murky grey-yellow and created little mountain ranges of bedsheet. He lay there, tense and thinking. Something should happen now, he was sure of it. Something to celebrate the fact that John didn’t die. He could have lost John tonight without ever knowing what really subbing for him would be like. He licked his lips. That couldn’t happen again. He couldn’t miss that experience.
His cock was…well, ‘massive’ was the only word that really encompassed it. It poked out of a nest of blonde-auburn curls, half hard and eager. Sherlock’s own cock jumped at the sight and he wondered if that torpedo could even fit in his arse.
"Let me." Lestrade leaned down in front of him, easing the buttons apart and sliding the scraped up, bloody shirt off. He tossed it on the coat and then unfolded the fresh Tshirt. Greg saw the faint long line of bruising beside his spine and bandages covering his ribs. Tomorrow was going to be rough. Sherlock snatched the Tshirt from him with a slight scowl and managed to get it over his head, minding the bandages. He reached for his trousers.
He didn't know it, but the following day was one of the worst days he'd have at Castle Chilgrave.
“Doing alright?” John shuffled around in front of him and tilted his chin up to gave him a kiss.
“Jump back up there and you might get your wish.” She said, too used to him to be sympathetic or obsequious. The cry of “land ho!” cut through the air and Sally sighed in relief as Sherlock swore and stomped to his rooms below deck where he could work himself into a raging sulk that would likely last the duration of the trip.
Sherlock was grinning like a madman.
Sherlock held as still as he could while John ran his hand down his ribs and over his hip. “So gorgeous, and all mine.”
“Oh, something that I should have done a while ago, I think.” John picked up the cuffs and turned to him and Sherlock held his hands out. John cinched them on his wrists and the sub examined the new cuffs. They covered more of his wrist, and each one had a little bar he could comfortably wrap his fingers around. Hm. He wondered what John had planned. “Stand.” John said. He got on a chair and threw the chain up on the hook, then got down and clipped the dangling ends to his sub’s wrists.
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded. John looked at the leg some more.
“I didn’t lose him—he wandered off! He does that.”
Sherlock got up and John hid a smile. He strolled out to the kitchen. As he expected, Sherlock followed very close behind, nearly walking into him. Subs liked to be close to their doms after punishment. John saw it every time he either punished a sub or had a particularly intense scene with someone. He did it himself too, the rare times he earned punishment from a dom. He enjoyed the proximity and he liked watching over his sub.
"Fair enough." She added a few more things to the paper and put the quill down. "You can put your loincloth on."
“Hungry?” John asked.
Prompt: Busking
sub. His shoulders jutted forward at an enticing angle. His cock was stiff and glistening, leaking slow lines of precum. His legs were almost obscenely wide as John adjusted to the cords running tight between his cheeks and on either side of his balls.
The doctor laughed and removed his hand.
“What are you doing?” He stamped down the roar of jealousy in his ears.
Sherlock grunted as he stormed past and Mrs. Hudson frowned. A passel of scribes and servants followed Sherlock to his rooms and Sally lingered in Mrs. Hudson's doorway. "I don't know what happened." She said. "He was alright at Chilgrave‒seemed almost happy, in fact."
I have had the pleasure of working with Holmes for about six years by now, and what a marvelous period of my life it has been.  No longer consigned to my previous lonely flat, there have been ample opportunities for interesting and frequently lively discussions, contented evenings of shared quiet and, of course, the fascination of watching Holmes make astonishing – and accurate – deductions about a case.  These events, in addition to my usual medical practice, have made for an exceedingly satisfactory life.
I wake perhaps an hour later, alone in Sherlock’s bed.  His side is cold, indicating that he has been gone for some time.  Still, I allow myself a moment to remember all that has recently transpired between us, feeling again a sense of wonder that my long-wished-for desires seem to have finally come true.  Quickly, I find my discarded clothing and dress, noticing as I do so that there is no longer the sound of wind and rain lashing the cabin, and the sky outside Sherlock’s wind looks overcast but no longer forbiddingly dark.
“And your client was wearing one, I take it?”
The next morning the village girl, Cecily, arrives to take care of the cleaning and to collect our laundry.  After accepting our garments, including Holmes’ sodden items from the previous day, she hands over a small envelope.  “From th’ vicar, sirs,” she says, with a quick bob of her head.
In truth, there is not the slightest possibility I will refuse his request, and he knows this.  I am a doctor after all, and the welfare of my patients trump all other concerns.  I swallow, steeling my resolve, then nod.
My feelings now, however, seem rather different.  I live in our glorious capital, where there are ample opportunities to encounter ladies if one simply walks out the door.  And, indeed, I have seen many charming young women as I go about my business, but none have, as yet, truly caught my fancy.  Meanwhile, there have been an increasing number of moments where I have longed for an added closeness to Holmes, in ways that cannot be merely dismissed as an effect of male-only companionship.  Yes, all my spare time
“Think nothing of it - I was glad to–” I protest, but he holds up a hand to silence me.
In the many times I have, rather ashamedly, imagined undressing Holmes with my own hands, I have never imagined it under these circumstances, tending him rather than him willingly coming to me for pleasure.  I therefore take more care undoing his trouser buttons and easing the drenched wool down his long legs, trying not to touch his skin too much, and trying not to admire how well-muscled his limbs are from all the walking.  I end up kneeling on the hearthrug, allowing Holmes to brace one hand against my shoulder while he stands on one foot, and then the other, so I may completely remove his trousers.  Unfortunately, this leaves my face extremely close to personal parts of his anatomy; like his wet shirt, the wet drawers hide very little from view, although I’m trying hard to avert my eyes.  I exhale a shuddery breath, trying to get a grip on my feelings.
“Of course not,” Holmes replies with that maddening calm of his.  “But he was clearly far more distraught over the absence of a ‘friend’ – as he claimed – than might reasonably be expected; plus, of course, there was the very obvious symbol of the green carnation in his buttonhole.”
of warmth I sometimes feel for Holmes.  It was, I admit, not the first time another man had caught my eye; however, that had last occurred in Afghanistan, and I had dismissed the event as simply being the natural result of lack of contact with any of the fairer sex during our service.  It was not uncommon for the men to find brief reprieve with each other, and so I had not dwelled overmuch on my own experiences of that nature during my tour of duty.
Although it is spring, that does not mean the weather is always co-operative.  Indeed, about ten days into our stay, a sudden storm blows in from the ocean.  I am nodding over my reading when the unexpected slam of rain against the windows wakes me with a start.  A quick check through the swiftly dimming cottage confirms that Holmes has not yet returned from his daily constitutional; I can only hope he is near the house.  Unfortunately, fifteen, twenty, thirty minutes pass in an agony of slowness, as the winds howl like vengeful ghosts, and rain lashes the building.  I would go out in search of him but, as usual, I have no idea in which direction he has set off that day.  All I can do is hope he has found shelter somewhere, or that he will momentarily arrive back home.
“Naturally.”
“A moment.”  In his haste to be off, the hound chasing the fox on yet another case, he has neglected to properly wipe his lips of egg residue.  It’s not the first time and will likely not be the last he has neglected some aspect of his appearance in his eagerness to strike while a trail is hot.  I snatch up his discarded napkin and, wrapping it around my index finger, brush away the offending remainders of his breakfast from his mouth.
I nod toward the book now lying open next to his abandoned plate.  “Has your reading proved fruitful?”
“It meant nothing.” It sounded like a question, painfully unconvincing even to his own ears.
“Experiments mostly. What about your day?”
Mrs. Hudson paced back and forth in her rooms, wringing her hands and listening to the rain beat at the windows. This wouldn't do. Sherlock was a moody lad at the best of times, but Sally‒unflappable, stoic Sally‒usually brushed his snide comments aside. Water off a duck's back. That she spoke up at all about Sherlock's moods was indicative that something was very wrong. Mrs. Hudson had expected Sherlock to be thrilled to be back at Sherrinford, surrounded by his books and science contraptions and his falcons. His bird, Beatrix, was brooding. Sherlock had been waiting for the bird to lay an egg for some time now and Mrs. Hudson had noticed the round egg when she'd gone up to the falconry to check on her own bird, Leopold. She wondered if Sherlock knew yet.
Sherlock gave him a quizzical look.
Sherlock smiled. “Yes, it does.”
"No, well…not for sexual gratification.”
John walked into the room ten minutes later, sporting only the mildest limp. He was wearing fresh trousers and blue striped long-sleeved shirt and holding a duffel bag with an old comfy pair of sweats for Sherlock and one of his own black undershirts. He purposely had worn it and not washed it, knowing that Sherlock would enjoy wearing his clothes. A few tired lines were carved around his eyes.
“Why?”
"I, oh…" he put his hand on his stomach and grimaced. "Ex‒excuse me‒" He darted to the crackling fire and threw up into the flames, a bitter mix of bile and semen. The fire sparked and spit and John grimaced again and shivered. Fear laced his empty stomach. If Sherlock complained, if Jim got the slightest hint that John was unfit for duty, he'd have him tortured and executed. "Apologies!" John gasped. "My lord, er, your Highness. I, I just need a moment to collect myself…"
Sherlock was quiet, then, “yes.”
John pulled them on and crouched by the leg, focusing on the ragged, scabbed flesh. Sherlock was silent, letting him work. He really wasn’t used to working with dead bodies, persay, but he had a leg up on the average layman.
“And this is a very particular brand of work boot that compensates for fallen arches. It’s sturdy and filthy with what appears to be the same substance that’s under his nails. His toenails are clean enough—he clearly wore shoes at all times while surrounded with this oily grease. Look at his knee—rough skin at the top of the tibia, just under his patella. He spends a lot of time on his knees, something dear Donovan here knows all about—” he waved a vague hand at Sally, prompting another scolding, “Sherlock!” from John.
"I need a concubine."
Hm. Lowballed it. Here, take this for now and my coffers will sort the rest later."
“Clearly!” John barked. “I would not have let you wander over
John’s dominant side couldn’t let go. This was a hurting sub—an interesting fellow too (seriously, who invented their own job?). He wanted to find out what was wrong. He wanted to make Sherlock’s pain go away. Betsy wasn't the only one who was worried about him. John picked up his phone a week after the dinner, texting Mike.
swear in my presence.”
He walked off again. Sherlock listened to him rummage in the loo and then open a wardrobe somewhere. A bag unzipped, then the rustle of cloth. Sherlock hunched down a little bit and wrapped his hand around his cock. Plans? What kind of plans? Sherlock let himself go and folded his fingers. He wanted to come, but he wanted to experience the ‘plans’ more. He heard John set down a bag ten minutes later, then turn off a few lights, leaving the one over the door on.
Sherlock found himself laughing, genuinely laughing with John. Good Christ, when was the last time he’d really laughed at anything? They mutually decided to eat on the sofa, as there were several cultures growing in petri dishes on the kitchen table (John didn’t even make any disgusted faces). They sank into the leather and Sherlock propped his foot up on the edge of the table. John kicked off his shoes and crossed his socked feet on top of a quarterly journal. It was nice, this. Sherlock found he felt completely comfortable around John. He’d never once felt this way around Seb. Never this…relaxed.
John’s brows rose. The letter again.
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded and John scrabbled to untuck his finely tailored blue shirt.
Another murmur, “stand, please.”
"Like fucking hell I will!" Sherlock used the last of his strength to reached across his bedside table, looking for something, anything else to throw. Mycroft caught his wrist again and squeezed.
Sherlock looked down. "As much as I could. He's the most fascinating human being I've ever met and now he won't let me forget him."
Sherlock snatched the long list and read it over, nodding. “Yes, many of these I can get at home. Mike would know…” he turned away, taking the quill and making notes in the parchment’s white spaces. He opened one of his books, cursing his lack of supplies. He knew exactly which tome he needed but it was tucked away on the shelf in Sherrinford’s infirmary. Damn this whole trip. He sat down, flipping pages in the subpar book and making notes on how he could pinpoint exactly which poison laced this arrow…
“Exactly. And that brings us to our last point—danger.” John rubbed his sub’s back. They were almost finished. “You do not put yourself in dangerous situations—on purpose. I know that what you do is inherently dangerous. Solving crimes puts you, us, around some unsavory people.”
“Yes she was but I’m not talking about Donovan. I’m talking about Lestrade! You can’t just deduce embarrassing things aloud about people—and that was completely uncalled for, what you said to him.”
Mike’s voice crackled.
His eyes were hazy with peace and he blinked slowly. “Yes.”
“I don’t remember a lot of it. I was coming home from work, walking towards the Knightsbridge Tube stop….someone must have attacked me from behind. I don’t know, it gets fuzzy around then. I woke up later. It was dark. I was inside, like in a cabin or hut of some kind. There was a fireplace and a table and chairs. There might have been a deer skin rug but I could have just hallucinated that. There was a lot of blood around me on a tarp—most of it mine. It smelled like wood.”
He snarled, rising to a sitting position. "What the bloody hell needs my attention now? Is there some simpering diplomat on board I need to commune with? Another fucking royal duty I haven't completed? Is everyone lined up outside to kiss my arse?"
"I see that, John!" He snarled. "But
Most of the tell-tale signs that a mad genius lived in the flat were gone, but there was a key on the kitchen table and a note beside it.
He slammed his fist down on the counter top. He was
“Lestrade. He—there’s a body. Dom. Suspected poisoning.” He paused, shuffling his feet and looking longingly at his coat. “Interested?”
Sherlock folded his hands over his sacrum and finally, finally went quiet. John took a deep breath. Boundary testing, that’s what this was. So far they’d had a pretty easy go of things, all things considered. Sherlock obeyed with a general minimum of fuss and any fuss was met with scolding that usually turned into groping and orgasms. Sherlock had been happy to be away from his dick of a former dom and wasn’t giving John any grief because of it. Now though, it seemed he was testing his dom to see how hard he’d have to push before John pushed back.
Or forever.
He made another little whiny sound and stuck his face back in his arm. “No more!” He said at the bed.
"John?"
“Sherlock.” Mycroft said.
“Going out, love?” Mrs. Hudson’s door was open and she looked to be in the midst of cleaning. A kerchief was tied around her hair and she had yellow rubber gloves on.
and John was about to…do what exactly?
“Cock.”
"They taste so very scrummy." Mary said.
"I'm making a sourdough." Sherlock said.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment and John looked up at him, bracing himself for the worst. His sub was just standing there, staring at him.
John appeared in the doorway. He licked his lips and watched Sherlock jack himself off, his lips pink and wet and his eyes closed in pleasure. “Holmes!” He snapped. “What the hell are you doing?!”
The doctor stepped out of the room.
They both fell into a doze. Sherlock’s phone lay forgotten in the other room and they missed the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. The creak in the hallway had them both lifting their heads.
"Oh God yes." Sherlock breathed. They surged together, kissing like two men drowning, kissing like they were the only people on earth.
“Sherlock.” He peered into each stall and looked around blankly. The room wasn’t big. If he was going to see him, he would have seen him by now. Maybe he was in the cab. He stepped out of room and into the corridor. He glanced around. The door to the women’s room was across the hall and the fire escape door was clearly labeled with a big red sign. John went back to the front and turned to the hostess.
"Finished?" He asked.
"Are you still in Paris?" He wished his voice wasn't so raw and whiny.
Sherlock stood up. “I think I have some passable public school clothes...”
“Here we go…” He flipped through them. Chinese, burgers, Vietnamese, some kind of kebab thing, ah, here it was—
John said.
Sherlock shrugged, pleased. "I observed. I looked at you, at your posture. I listened to your tone of voice. Simple."
“Let’s not do that again, yeah?”
A nod.
"Alright there, your Highness?" Angelo came out from the back kitchen and spoke in a low voice. He touched Sherlock’s shoulder.
“‘Bout twenty.”
Mel had already made him promise to save her one (or five). They just had to cool first. He eyed the clock. He had plenty of time.
A sleepy blue eye looked up at him. “Y’welcome.” Sherlock mumbled.
"‒can't you look at me at your surgery?" He blurted. "It'll go faster and we can go home faster and I don't want
Greg shrugged. “You can ask him yourself if you want. He’s in Mercy hospital.”
John was delighted.
Sherlock was staring at the soot through his microscope. "I think John's reaction speaks for both of us."
“No…” John looked up at him and cradled the side of his face. “I’m sorry.”
“Haven’t heard from him since the dinner.” Mike said. The waiter brought his soft drink and he took it with a grateful “thank you.”
“Was he a sub?” John asked.
"I see." They held out their hand and John's chain was passed over. The guards left and John was drawn through the thick doors and into a grey stone entranceway some eight feet high and ten wide. He glanced about, seeing not much more than a ragged rug on the floor and another doorway to his left that lead to a little alcove with a table and a brazier in the corner. He was pulled along past this and tugged through a thick curtain draped like a doorway.
“I’d say so.” He said.
“The police station…?” Sherlock frowned.
“I said I was sorry.” Sherlock looked away and a flush crept up his neck.
He pocketed the phone and stepped into the lift, pushing for the third floor. He slumped against the wall as the doors closed and sighed. He had no idea how bad the damage was. Sherlock wasn't in hospital so maybe it wasn't too terrible. Knowing his sub, he likely
think the worst? Oh God, if anything at all happened to him...
Headmaster Watson crossed his arms, looking pissed off. “I’m getting sick of this snotty attitude, Holmes. Keep it up and you’ll walk out of here with a sore, well smacked bottom.”
Still nothing.
“Love you too.”
"Sherlock Holmes!" Mycroft thundered.
“They questioned me about Owen. Hell,” He chuckled, “for a while there I thought they thought I did it!”
"That's why I don't do it." Mel said.
Let’s have a shower and I’ll rub some lotion on you.”
“Other people slow me down.” He groused.
the tub, John. Before and after the experiment. I wasn’t too keen on bathing in pig water either.”
“Despite the state of the body,” Molly began, “we could tell that his spleen and parts of his liver and stomach had been partially removed.”
She seemed surprised, but she lifted the tape and permitted him past. Every officer on site was staring, watching as John walked beside Sherlock up to where the leg and arm lay on a blue tarp. A stained brown boot was beside the leg. They both crouched down to get a better look. “Didn’t realize I would be taking center stage.” John murmured at his sub.
"What? They're just two blokes."
“I…met someone.” He said. He had never been entirely comfortable with Ella. It wasn’t
“I don’t think you would hurt me, John.” Sherlock said, settling down again. “Not from what I’ve seen so far.”
“He’d better be. Give me one moment.” John got out of the cab and went back inside, a not so good feeling in his chest. The hostess looked up at him.
“What did he die of?” Sherlock asked.
“No. An officer talked to her this morning. She’s expecting us and confirmed on the phone she wasn’t in Defense.”
"Not the point." She tossed it into the basket, not really angry.
“Fix it!” John wailed.
John crouched and rubbed his shaking hands through his hair.  "
“Wood?” Sherlock asked.
"The moment we've all been waiting for." Sue said. "All of you should be extraordinarily proud of yourselves. All of your bakes have been amazing and I wish we could crown you all winners. Alas, there can only be one champion."
“And you will be polite to them none the less.”
"Take off your clothes." Sherlock stood, his hand lingering in John's as he gave the order.
His sub was laying serene and still, his hands steepled under his chin.
“Fine. Tomorrow, meet Donovan there at ten.”
“Thanks for doing that.” He said. “For letting him stay with you.”
“Yes.”
“What?” He asked, tightening his hands on Sherlock’s flanks. “That’s your ‘don’t bother me I’m deducing’ face.
“Okay.” John fingers twitched as he thought of ideas. “Okay, what do you definitely not want to do?”
Again Seb didn’t respond.
Sherlock giggled and picked up the menu, asking about various dishes. His voice was pitched slightly higher and the chef leaned over his shoulder, their bodies practically rubbing as he pointed out different things on the menu he could switch.
“Hands behind your back.”
Sherlock exploded.
A warm hand in his left palm made him startle. Molly. She lead him slowly away from the bloody mess. “Is it broken?” She asked, nodding to his arm. He unpeeled his right hand and frowned at the aching spot. The skin was red and starting to swell. He was sure it bruise badly. His eye and nose were starting to really ache from the fistfight, brief as it had been.
the bloody case. The killer would want him out of the way for sure. He wanted to drag Sherlock home, lock the door, and hunker down in the flat protecting him until this all passed and the murderers were behind bars. He shook his head to himself. He didn’t want him on the case. If that made him selfish, then so be it. If that made him domineering and overprotective, he didn’t care. He finally had someone he loved
“Is it safe?” She asked, glancing around for John. “Is he still in Defense?”
His shoulders sagged in defeat but Mary was a little more forgiving. "The taste is delightful and wonderfully savory. It rose very nicely. It just needed a few more minutes."
One of Moran's men rode ahead several hours later, presumably to notify the castle of their arrival with a surprise band of the highwaymen members in tow. John, again, cursed himself a bleeding idiot. How could he have been so stupid about all this? He'd been expecting a regular payroll carriage, not this posh arsehole's personal cavalry.
“Let him do it.” Sally commanded the crew. “If he falls it’s his own stupid fault.”
“John, hello.” She opened her door and gestured him into her sleek office with it’s grey rug and papered walls and green fluffy plants meant to liven the place up.
Sherlock pouted but conceded. He crawled up and sat on the bed.
Sherlock took the headband and placed it squarely on his head as if he were a king donning his crown. "Much."
“Well of course.” Sherlock set his bag down on the table and gave John a small smile. “That was
In fact, it was all so amazing that Sherlock wondered how long it would all last. He had nothing to go on. No experiments that could provide data, no hypotheses to test. John was here now, but how long until he got sick of him? How long until the severed limbs and case work got to be just too much? Mycroft always told him his
"This John, you spent time with him when you were in Hibern?"
“I think I’d prefer you sticking something else into said ‘other places.’
“What do you mean? Do you want me to leave?”
He washed his hair and simply enjoyed the heat and steam of the water sluicing over his skin. He felt much better by the time he turned the water off and dried. He slipped the gown on again and closed it tight, then walked into the bedroom. The bed was turned down and looked sumptuous and soft. He wandered into the kitchen and found a mug of fresh tea waiting for him. John was in the sitting room, just sort of standing there. It was obvious he had been pacing. Waiting. There was no sign of the cuffs or flogger or that anything had happened at all, just a really sheepish John. Sherlock sipped the tea. It was delicious and touched with sweetness and he drank deep from the mug, enjoying it.
“No.” Sherlock scoffed. “He had a long, bad night in the toilet though.”
Fluff and schmoop and more BAMF John.
"How long?" John asked.
John put the phone away. “You’ll live. Here, finish your tomatoes.”
John examined the color of his arse, running two fingers over the hot skin. Very pink and getting darker, but no bruising yet. Good.
John came back in the room. "Turn to the side." He said. Sherlock shuffled around. John took the exposure screen out of the panel and fed a new one in. He readjusted the lead shield by his legs. "Raise your arms over your head."
I used three prompts in this one: winter, escape, and snowball fight.
“I…left you a key this morning.”
Forty minutes later, John checked his bread. It had risen a centimeter at best.
He flopped down on his green chair with the biscuit and winced, straightening up as Mrs. Hudson brought him his tea.
or so.
"I didn't put that there. Mrs. Hudson must have moved it."
“Greg…” She moaned, smiling. “C’mere….” She tugged him close and wrapped her hand around his thick, muscled arms, going slack and still.
—and I prefer spending my weekends experimenting on severed limbs rather than partaking in pub crawls.” He took a deep breath. “That’s not normal.”
John extended his hand with a smile. Sherlock finished with his phone and looked up at him. He gave John the once-over, his face devoid of emotion, before blinking languidly and looking back at the screen.
John swatted him again.
When the bag was empty and everything was folded or draped or put in the basket, John opened a side pocket outside the bag and pulled out a little clay tub containing a hard chunk of what looked like clear green stone. Wondering what it was, John put it on the desk.
“Yes. Do you want to see?”
“For certain foods, yes.” Sherlock sipped his water and John slid his foot under the table, questing for his sub. Sherlock kept one eye on the kitchen door. Of course he didn’t have a sensitive palate, but if he’d been right in his conclusions (and he usually was), then the killer worked at this restaurant—and had access to the kitchen specifically. Slipping the drugs into drinks would be so easy. John made comments about the decor or his shift at the clinic, and Sherlock made all the right noises until someone, unmistakably a chef, appeared and headed towards their table. Sherlock watched him intently. He was certainly a dominant. He was tall and his build suggested that he would be more than capable of subduing a person and killing them, even someone struggling. None of the victims had been especially brawny. Submissives in general tended to be on the smaller side anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Enter.” John’s voice. Sherlock pushed open the door and blinked a few times. John had moved the furniture around. The desk was pulled away from the wall and cleared off, save for his own laptop and a desk lamp and a pencil cup. A stack of papers was stacked neatly in the corner and it looked, well, not unlike the desk his own primary school teacher had looked. A thick wooden ruler was beside the laptop. One of the desk chairs was missing, replaced with a simple wooden stool. Sherlock looked at John. His dom was standing in front of the coffee table, wearing a black suit with a black waistcoat underneath patterned in very thin blue plaid lines. It looked tailored. His shirt was a pale blue that matched the plaid and a pocket square the exact shade of navy as his eyes was tucked against his breast. Damn. John didn’t wear suits very often and Sherlock was pleased to see they worked on him
“Stay here.”
Sherlock nodded. “Yes, John. Please.” John nuzzled his neck, inhaling the sweet hide scent and his sub’s natural and familiar smell. It buzzed up into his brain and made his dominance roar.
“Did you see him leave?”
“I know! I’m sorry—I’ll never lie to you again!”
The attendant read off some names and John’s ears twitched when he heard:
“Sh, come on, love. Take your clothes off and we can settle, alright?”
Lestrade’s phone rang. Ian.
“I love you, John.” He settled his cheek on the top of his dom’s head and they simply stood there, breathing together.
“Yeah, like a sweet wood smell and maybe, like old standing water? Onions and garlic too, just a little bit.”
“He probably forgot. Maybe Molly got a bunch of diseased limbs in and he’s tearing through there like Christmas morning.” Betsy smiled.
“Can’t say I disagree with her...” John mused.
“You’re damn right.” He kissed him on the head, then snarled as the doorbell rang.
John swallowed. “You had dead fetal pigs in the same tub I take baths in?”
John stood up. If Sherlock really was that fucking bored, he could provide plenty of distraction. He deserved time with his sub. Without giving himself the benefit of pausing and actually thinking rationally about the thundering thoughts that had just pounded through his head, he barked out an order at his sub.
“You look good with that in your mouth.” He slipped his hand down to Sherlock’s bum and ran his fingers through his crack. “My cock would look even better between those nice pink lips.”
“John.” The deep voice filled his ears. “You were having a nightmare. I woke you up. It’s me, Sherlock, your sub. You’re in London, on Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson is our landlady. You worked a shift at the clinic yesterday. You take your coffee without sugar and write a blog about our cases. You..”
The rain picked up outside, a steady soothing
Sherlock shifted in his chair, still able to feel the faint crop marks on his thighs and shoulders. His bum was even a bit tender from the paddle. Sherlock stifled a smile at the thought of last night. John had pulled his clothes off and laid him on the bed and instructed him to keep his palms pressed against the headboard. He’d then cropped his back and thighs, generously skipping over his sore, recently paddled spots. Afterwards John had rubbed something cool and soothing into his skin and kissed all his tender parts until he was shivering, his hands leaving clammy spots of mist on the wooden headboard.
“No.” Sherlock looked down. “But the shower will probably exacerbate everything.” He ran a delicate finger across a healing slice on his ribs.
The attendant paused. "John is otherwise engaged tonight, Highness. I can send up a different‒"
“Are you going to punish me?”
“He looks stunning.” She said, glancing up at Sherlock admiring himself in the reflection of a display case. “You both seem so happy.”
"I'm glad you said yes, John." Mike said as they went up the stairs to his flat later that evening. "I always regretted losing touch with you.”
Sherlock looked back at his feet, then grinned devilishly. He slipped to the floor and shuffled between his dom’s legs, pushing his knees apart. John peered around the edge of the page, watching Sherlock scoot closer to the sofa and then reach for his fly. He tossed the magazine aside and lifted his hips as Sherlock pulled his button and zipper, shucking his trousers and pants to the floor. Sherlock knelt up and wrapped his mouth around John’s cock. One hand was braced on his bare thigh as he bobbed and sucked.
, and
"What is…all of this?" John asked, nodding towards the table.
Sherlock gave the next girl in line a present wrapped in pink paper. She giggled at his costume and he aimed a fake smile at her. "Happy Christmas," he ground out.
John smiled at him. “Sherlock Watson-Holmes.” He said, enjoying the taste of that.
Sherlock’s nose woke him the next morning. His nostrils flared and he blinked in the morning light. The bed beside him was empty and cold and a big mug of steaming coffee was on the side table, as was his phone. A note was taped to the ceramic cup.
“Do you want anything to drink?” She offered, bringing them into the kitchen and gesturing at the table for them to be seated.
“With you…I could. But with him…When I was with Seb, I didn’t enjoy sexual contact or intimacy. Even before him, it was never a priority for me. He never made it enjoyable or something I wanted to do with him. Sometimes, the rare times I would feel the urge, I took care of it myself. Alone. It was easier that way.” Sherlock said. “I could take care of it and he wouldn’t need to know.”
“Perfect.” John sat on the bed in front of him, his back to the headboard, and straightened his legs out, sliding his left between Sherlock’s spread knees. He grabbed the fabric around his thighs and heaved, sliding his sub along the sheets towards him until their naked groins were crammed together. Sherlock snuggled close and rested his head on John’s, breathing fast and hard into his hair as he nudged forward even more, getting in as much skin contact as he could manage and sort of hunching his bound shoulders forward.
