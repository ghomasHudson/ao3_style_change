Jack wakes up screaming at night and Sam tries to help but there isn’t much he can do when Dean sleeps in the same room. He‘ll wander in only to be sent back out, leaving Dean even more sleep deprived and exhausted, clutching a screaming baby to his chest.
The next fic will be a little sad still and will mainly deal with Cas learning how Dean was while he was gone and how he reacts to it along with some insight into Jack’s powers and his angel side.
He doesn’t love her and he doesn’t desire her, not willingly. Dean doesn't want her touching him, he doesn’t want to kiss her. Avoiding her is natural, it’s
He buries his face in Cas’s neck, cups the back of his head as if he could somehow bring Cas closer. He stays like that for as long as he can stand. Feels Jack squirming between them, feels Cas’s arm cautiously come to rest on his waist, like any sudden movement would scare Dean away like a skittish animal.
Dean will protect him, he’ll keep the angels and demons away from him, he’ll make sure that they make it back to the bunker, where they can tuck him away. Because losing Jack would be the final straw. The final failure in a long list. It would mean that Dean let Cas down
Irony sits like a lead weight in Dean’s stomach as he walks up the front steps of Cas’s house. It makes his stomach roll, bile climbing up his throat and he buries his nose in Cas’s hair.
When they get back to the bunker they're going to have to talk. A part of Dean is dreading it the same way that he dreads every conversation about feelings, but another is almost giddy, because this was it; this was the win he needed.
The process of burping him was unnerving as well, Dean worrying he wasn't patting hard enough or too hard. Jack is so small that he seems dwarfed by Dean’s hand, spanning nearly the entire length of his back.
This wasn't fair. Nothing about this was fair. Why did God get to frolic in the tulips with his sister while Dean lost nearly everyone he ever loved. Why does Cas have to die for a girl he barely knows, a baby he never even gets to meet. Why does Dean have to be the one left behind to mourn everything he wanted?
A part of Dean, something he can't name, aches and wants to go home. Dean didn't have a home for so long, but he feels like he had finally managed to make one. In Cas, in Sam, in Charlie, in Mary, in this family he has built and one by one he has to watch them burn like every other home he’s had before.
When he gets back to the Impala, Jack is absolutely screaming, tears running down his tiny face, beanie askew on his head. Sam is looking at him as if he was a bomb ready to go off at any moment, which honestly wasn't too far off the mark. They don't know what causes the shockwave scream that happened at the pyre, but he worries that it will happen in public.
He waits for Cas to settle comfortably on the bed before shifting his arms around, stuffing a pillow underneath and handing him back the bottle.
He lets his arm trail all the way from Cas’s neck to his hand, tangling their fingers together and tugging him back to the impala.
done too much shit to talk about blame right now.” Dean takes a ragged breath and is stuck by a thought that kills any anger lingering in his body.
“I was.” At the sound of Cas’s voice, Dean leans his forehead against the impala, letting the cool metal settle something in him before he continues to unbuckle a very disgruntled Jack. “I was in the empty, asleep until I heard a baby crying.” Dean raises his eyebrow at Jack as he finally pulls him from his carrier. Jack gives a gummy smile, as if he knows what's going on, his blue eyes crinkling.
“I hope you have his optimism.” Is blurted out as Dean gives Jack a bath, his little legs kicking up water.
Sam had to pull Dean kicking and screaming from the other world, away from Cas striding towards Lucifer like he was nothing more than some random demon. Like he couldn't kill him without breaking a sweat.
Cas lets out a huff of laughter and turns to check on Jack. Dean looks up at his sharp intake of air and sees Jack’s wings out, corporeal enough that a few feathers drift down to the blanket below him, still glowing the faint gold of his grace.
The qareen lights up from the inside out, it shines from his chest, his eyes, his mouth as he screams in pain. He folds in on himself, dissolving into his core, like a star collapsing.
Dean sucks in a ragged breath and looks down just to make sure that there was no ash, just the absence where the qareen once stood. The
It seems like Jack hadn’t woken up again, Cas wouldn't have been able to get him off or back on Dean’s chest without waking him up, no matter how careful he was about it. This means Jack was no doubt hungry, explaining the rude awakening.
. Like he said, he’s not stupid. He’s known that he’s loved Cas for a long time. The word doesn't process in his mind, though. It carries a different weight, a dangerous one.
“Wha-” Dean sputters standing up. “I just offered you food!” Dean could hear Sam’s laughter echoing from the hallway as he threw his hands up in defeat.
One day, Dean wakes up to the door of the bunker slamming closed and he bolts out of bed, skidding to a stop in the entryway, gun cocked. All he finds is a scrap of paper on the radar telling him that Sam had left for a hunt and would text him when he was on his way home.
Cas’s other hand tentatively comes up to brush through the back of Jack’s right wing. As soon as he brushes through the feathers, they light up a pale orange. Almost puffing up to meet his fingers, which begin to glow the white-blue of grace to match. The lightshow fades as soon as Cas’s hand pulls away.
Eventually, it becomes too much for Dean, the awkward silence and heavy glances digging into his skin. It makes him want to scream and rage just to do
“Because after everything that you've done, you owe us, you son of a bitch. So you get your ass down here and you make this right, right here and right now.” Dean's voice rises with his anger, tears gathering in his eyes without permission. This wait is longer, a minute before Dean suddenly erupts punching the wall in front of him until his knuckles crack and bleed. The pain grounds him.
It's a test of his patience each time, the process taking anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. By the end of this round he can feel the world blurring a little around the edges, telling him that he’s been awake for far too long.
The transition into a demon isn’t a smooth one either. It happens in leaps and bounds, indescribable pain like being burned alive slowly. Like slipping down the side of a mountain, clinging to every handhold you can as if it’ll stop you. Like sitting in a hospital as your heart stutters and stops and starts again in your chest, your father nowhere to be found, ignoring your calls. Like the burn in your lungs when you're trapped in a coffin six feet down. It's being consumed in the worst way possible.
He reaches up to rub at the stubble on his cheek and Dean catches his hand with his own, resting them on the table between them.
All inky blackness, so dark you can’t tell where the floor ends and the sky starts. So dark that it all turns into one uniform smear. It’s so close to the gaps in his memory, drowning in the absence of everything until Michael took pity on him and pushed him into a new memory.
Dean leans down to press kiss to the crown of Jack’s head, feels the wings stretch out in contentment before settling back into their folded position, like a cat pushing into an owner's hand. Each wing is about a foot and a half long and he knows from experience that the longer he sits here the more solid they will get.
“After you,” Dean pauses again, still unable to look at Cas. “Mom, she-” Dean nearly growls at himself, frustration settling deep in his bones.
He watches Sam light it instead. He listens to him say thank you, say goodbye, teaching Jack how to mourn, how to be human. Dean watches him pour the gasoline, the silver lighter turning gold in the light of the flames, and he can't look away.
Instead, he screams all night until Dean drags himself out of bed and lets him sleep in the newly bought bassinet, close enough that Dean could run his fingers along one tiny arm.
In the distance he can hear the faint rumble of something big, something bigger than he could ever imagine, but he just smiles at Cas and flashes a ruin carved into his free hand.
At three weeks old, Jack has quickly grown accustomed to life in the bunker, but apparently doesn’t like the fact that he is now sleeping in his own room, even if it is less than 15 feet away from where Dean sleeps.
As Jack gulps down his bottle and Cas patiently burps him, Dean takes the time to think. Because, the thing is: He knows what Cas is talking about, no matter how much he plays dumb he’s not actually stupid.
“You left and I couldn't do anything about it, and all I had left of you was Jack and I just-” Cas tilts Dean’s head up gently, until green meets blue.
It is strange to not have a baby in his arms or strapped to his chest while he works, and when he turns around at the end he’s struck still.
Every moment that Cas was gone, every day he spent without him, Dean walked a tightrope. He wanted to drink but he wouldn't let himself, remembering angry words slurred out from his dad's mouth like acid. He wouldn't let anybody take Jack because he remembered the burden of caring for a baby that shouldn't be your responsibility.
“Okay, you want to take a trip, buddy?” Jack is finally passed out in his arms, leaving Dean talking to the empty air. His voice echoes along the walls of the bunker and it hits Dean just how alone he is. His breath catches in his throat and he's overwhelmed by the grief flowing through him.
Sometimes, everything you’ve ever wanted can be contained in one memory, one moment in time, and Dean finds he can’t pull himself away.
Jack sounds almost excited, like he hadn’t just sent Dean’s mind in a spiral. He doesn’t say anything else though, just sits back into that stiff, uncomfortable looking position and watches the tv.
“Because of this mark” Michael spits out the word, ignoring him and glancing back at the mirror, locking eyes with Dean who grits his teeth. He can feel the smugness flowing through Michael. He’s confident in his position, in his ability to control Dean if he needs to.
Cas lets out a laugh, tossing his head back, and Dean is tempted to lean down and bite his collarbone.
So, he’s stuck in his own mind. He wanders his memories, though childhood games and laughter, through mistakes and regret, though memories of family and love. Each time one ends he finds himself in a new one, a never ending movie, his best hits.
How many times had Cas been tricked for him to have given up so wholey. How long has he been stuck here, constantly reliving his rescue only for it to be fake, for Dean to collapse in a pile of black ooze. For ‘Dean’ to openly mock him for his sentiment.
Dean recognizes Jack, and Jack recognizes him, a part of him that even he doesn’t quite understand. The same part of him that feels empty when Cas is gone, that only settles when he’s in arms length. The part of him that wanted to climb right on that pyre and burn as well.
“Do you actually believe that?” Cas asks, focusing on Dean’s thumb brushing along his pulse point. Dean wants to lean over, catch his blue eyes, but instead he focuses on Jack who is looking up at them with a golden glint.
Then all at once, reality crashes over him and he launches himself forward, fingers grazing the edge of his sleeve before the floor drops out from under him and he awakes with a gasp on his bed, already reaching out for Jack.
“Please, Cas.” Cas does nothing more than turn his face away, his eyes squeezing shut once more as if it’ll somehow make Dean go away. “Cas look at me.” And he does, blue eyes opening blearily, locking with green, but Dean can tell he still doesn't believe him. He still looks resigned to his fate, searching Dean’s face like it's the last time he’ll ever see him, but making no effort to get up.
Dean is already wide awake, having spent the last two hours trying to get a colicky Jack to fall back to sleep, when Sam emerges from his room. He’s fully dressed and on the phone grinning bigger than anything Dean had seen in a long time.
The expression on Sam’s face is telling, his eyebrows drawn together, shoulders tense. It's a relief to see him, the few updates he had gotten not providing nearly enough info to settle his nerves. Dean has avoided the news for the past couple days, more focused on getting the nursery together and getting Jack into some sort of routine, but now wishes he hadn't.
“And he's out.” Sam mumbles, turning to face the window once more. Dean nods, silently relieved. The kid was loud when he wanted to be and Dean didn't have the frame of mind to quiet him.
Something about the Impala soothes him, maybe it was the noise or the vibrations but inevitably, when they pulled over to feed him he would start crying as the car drew to a stop.
Dean tugs the couch as close as possible to Jack’s bed. Not that he actually uses it that much that night.
It was interesting to see the three together, just how much of a family they looked like. Three sets of matching blue eyes, and with Claire’s blonde hair, Jack’s light brown didn't seem nearly as out of place. Cas just looks like a father with two kids.
It was all of Dean’s feeling for Cas, bottled up into one ache that starts at his shoulder and reverberates down into his chest, echoes throughout his entire body, consumes him.
“He can sense your emotions and reacts to them.” Cas finally moves close enough to hand Jack over. Dean's hands ache from holding on so tight, but he cradles Jack gently. Always so careful. “It's possible that it’s the reason why he had woken us up last night.”
Cas whispers “it’s over” into his ear, and Dean can do nothing more than lean farther into his hand.
The thing is: They still needed to talk things through. Dean didn't particularly think his half asleep ramblings after a nightmare counted towards a serious conversation about what they were. You couldn’t just kiss someone (multiple times) and then
The man wearing his skin smiles at him in the mirror, all teeth, more like a shark than a human. “I know how you keep escaping.” He gives Dean an interested look before glancing down at Dean’s shoulder, at the handprint hidden under layers of fabric. “He calls to you, doesn't he? Just like you call to him.”
“She didn't take it well, according to Jody.” Dean admits. His hands itch to hold Jack. Two months and he’s already gotten used to the weight in his arms, the ability to hide his face in Jack’s baby soft hair. “We told Jody that we could drive there to tell her in person, but she said she would handle it.”
For the first time since they had found Jack on that bed, covered in blood and slime, burning the sheets around him, Dean was utterly lost. He doesn't know how to make Jack feel better. He can't calm him down when he can't even calm himself down. He can't form the thought to sing to him. All he can do is stand there, the screaming baby held in his arms as he tries to save this.
“Of course.” As if it was obvious, as if there was no other option. “I don't sleep, it only makes sense for me to watch over Jack at night, and since his bassinet is in here it easiest for me to just stay in here.”
But Dean didn't want to live without him, gladly would have let Chuck have his way if it didn't mean taking Jack and Sam down with him. He would have let Chuck have his way if his way didn't mean living forever without Cas, because even God knows what his true weakness is, what he couldn't live without.
“Dean last time I left, I came back to you destroying the nursery,” Dean feels his lips pull into a scowl. “I'm not leaving again.”
“We have to check this out. Dodge City is just down the road, it could be a day trip,” Dean pushed himself up from the table, gathering everyone’s plates and cups to take to the sink. “Hey, I bet we could even find a tiny cowboy hat for little Doc Holiday over there.”
Michael knows what he’s doing. He knows what memories to pick, the exact right way to line them up that has Dean sinking into memories so sweet that he doesn’t want to leave.
“Please,” He begs, falling to his knees, head cradled in his hand. “Please God, just bring them back.”
The boy presses into Dean’s side when they sit on the couch and Dean can just as easily see Sam in his place. Oh so small and tucking perfectly into Dean, it didn’t matter how old he got. Six months, a year, twelve, even now if he ever wanted to he could probably still fit just right.
Dean can feel the rage rise like bile in his throat. It's animalistic, inhuman; it takes another chunk of his soul with it. It sends Dean skidding farther down the mountain, tumbling farther and farther away from the human he used to be.
Sam is still looking down at them, his brows furrowed. He opens his mouth as if to speak before letting it snap shut again. Instead he sits next to Dean, lets his fingers brush along the hair at the top of Jack’s head. Jack coos in response, reaching out his arms.
He remembers the bloody handprint, he hasn't managed to wash it away. It sits on a chair in his room, pushed out of his sight, but still he finds his eyes drawn to the place it is hidden without his permission.
“Yeah, I know kid it's weird isn't it?” Dean rests his hand lightly on Jack's back and snorts. Sam had found a onesie at the store with ‘Daddy’s Little Angel’ plastered across the front and tiny wings sewn onto the back. “Apparently it helps your shoulders and neck, though, so you’ll have to suffer for a while.”
“You are already the better person because you’re trying.” Cas insists. “You're doing your best to make up for the wrongs you have caused, that have been done to you. And isn’t that what you told me? That’s all that matters: that you try.”
Dean and Sam have fought before. Hell, they’ve split up, gone their separate ways, the whole nine yards over fights. This shouldn’t even be on their radar.
“Yeah,” Dean's voice is soft, nearly drowned out by the sound of food cooking. “Surprisingly, he was even smaller when he was born, I think when we finally got around to weighing him he was 5 pounds 12 ounces.”
“Give me a minute.” Dean is ashamed to admit it, but he almost begs, turning away from Cas once more. He’s trying to get his thoughts in order but they seem to bounce around his head faster than he could even hope to process them.
“We’ll talk about this in the morning.” He says, sliding down so that he’s curved around Dean and Jack both. Their fingers are still laced together and neither of them make an effort to untangle them. “Sleep. I'll watch over you.”
The baby is a solid weight on his chest and it grounds him as he nearly stumbles down the steps. Dean can see Sam outside, piling wood up and takes a shuddering breath as he draws close to where Cas lays peacefully on the table.
“I think you did a wonderful job raising Sam and you’ll do a wonderful job raising Jack too.” Part of Dean wants to disagree. Sam was wonderful, smarter than a whip, and more headstrong than almost anyone else Dean had met besides maybe Cas or himself. But, Dean knew that the two of them had their issues from being raised the way that they were.
There was a reason why Dean doesn’t like to have these touchy feely chick flick moments. They always seemed to leave him exhausted, on the teetering edge of drained and far too emotional all at once.
Dean gives in and slides closer to Cas, leaving Sam and Claire to their case talk. It didn't matter if Dean listened or not if he’d be sitting this one out. Claire finally wanders away from Cas and Jack to look closer at Sam’s computer.
If anything his words make Cas even more upset. Dean bets that if he wasn't holding his wrist he would be pacing back and forth across the room like a caged animal. Instead he lets out harsh breath through his nose like he’s trying to calm himself down.
Cas’s face is still pinched, uncomfortable, for the first time since he’s started to get used to Jack’s presence.
I am planning another sequel for this that'll cover season 13 in more detail but I don’t know how long that will take me and I haven’t even started on the outline yet. I’ll probably take a break for a little bit and work on a different one shot before I start though.
Dean absently wonders how long it has been for him. Nothing exists in the empty, but time still passes in a strange way. Years could pass here in less than a second of earth time, milliseconds can equal days. It's unequal, happening in leaps and bounds before slowing to a crawl, like it forgets it’s supposed to exist at all.
Sam stands awkwardly off to this side, still tucked against the impala as if he was having trouble standing. Dean ignores him, motioning for Cas to come closer. He props Jack up against his arm so Cas can get a good look at him.
“Of course, Missouri, I’ll be there.” Sam says, placing his gear bag on the table and throwing books in seemingly at random. He pauses at Dean’s raised eyebrow holding up a finger. “No just me. You'll probably know why as soon as I get there, so I’ll let it be a surprise till then.”
He can hear the shuffling as he finally manages to guide Jack’s other arm through the pajama sleeve and quickly zips it up. He turns to hand Jack back to Cas so he could get dressed for bed but quickly pauses.
. But there is something stuck in his throat that burns like a brand and Cas’s face blurs. “Stay.” The words continue to spill out of his mouth like a confession.
walk away, but he can't be here right now. Instead, he pulls them to the Dean cave. There's no tv in there yet, he’s still trying to pull together the finishing touches, but Dean sets up his laptop on the coffee table.
The blood stings in Dean’s veins. It burns a path through his body and he can't tell if it's actually curing him or killing him. With every dose, the pain in his shoulder fades as the blood flows like acid through him. He’s sure that death would be preferable to this. He wants to beg and plead for it to end, but all that leaves his mouth are screams that shake the walls of his cell.
It was suddenly hard to focus on anything else besides that faint curl of Cas’s lips. It’s hard to imagine where this all started, how much effort it used to take to get Cas to smile, to laugh along with his jokes. And now, while it wasn't done as freely as Sam or Dean, it’s common. But, it never fails to settle over Dean like a warm blanket and make his whole day brighter.
Feeding Jack was another thing Dean has to grow used to, it was far different from feeding a six month old.
Jack curls a hand around a beer bottle and winces at the taste, digs into shitty Chinese food like it’s the best thing he’s ever tasted, because it is. Everything is new to him.
“My name is—” He starts again, and he can’t remember what he was supposed to say. It worries him for a moment before he can’t remember what he was worried about, why he was in the room to begin with. There’s someone looking at him in the mirror, tears falling from his eyes and he looks horrified.
Dean wanders back into the kitchen taking stock of Cas, still sitting at the table as if he has nothing better to do. He has a furrow in his brow, though, and Dean prepares himself for the inevitable.
So, he wanders the darkness looking for him. Dean follows the tug in his shoulder and lets it guide him home.
Dean secretly wonders if it will always be like this. If the sense of something waiting in the wings to snatch this from him will ever leave. If they’ll ever stop clutching and clinging like the other will disappear in a puff of smoke. Like a child hanging onto the fading memory of a dream.
“Dean….” Cas sounds breathless, and when Dean looks up he looks blown away, his wide eyes tracking the wings movement. “Jack has….”
“Okay.” Dean sighs and pushes off his chair. Jack quiets at the sound of his voice and Dean watches as his eyes attempt to focus on Dean. “Okay, let's get you some food.”
Dean just shifts Jack until he’s over his shoulder, rubbing his back to warm him up as they walk back to Dean’s room. He hums the opening notes to Ramble On softly under his breath, hoping the familiar song will calm him some (Or at least calm Cas, who looks like he's two seconds from trying to help with his grace).
This chapter is only out on time because my friend Ds9 bullied me into finishing it yesterday, so a big fuck you (affectionate 💛) to her.
“Dean, you're not John. Leaving him with Sam for a couple of hours while you actually sleep is not the same thing.”
It's almost harder, Sam not being there. No matter how much they fought and argued, Dean couldn't bear anything happening to the kid. What Dean had said to his mother, even if it was said in anger was true.
“He tends to fall asleep within a couple minutes. You can usually move the bottle and he’ll wake up.” He makes sure Cas is holding the bottle properly before settling back on the bed. “I usually go like this on his cheek or hand to try to keep him awake.” Dean runs his fingers along Jack’s where they’re grabbing at the bottle. He can feel the delicate bones as they shift and move. They’re impossibly tiny under his hands.
It hurts to look at the nursery. Dean can see Cas in every aspect. The crib is slightly crooked in some places, the walls a soft blue, the paint a little messy. Tiny imperfections that spoke of Cas without him even being there.
“This was never written, it’s nothing more than an abomination.” Rage pours into Dean’s mind, and he can't tell if it’s his or Michael’s. The two mix and meld in his head creating a confusing rush of emotion that makes him nearly nauseous. “It is a stain on your soul.” As if anything of Cas could be dirty, as if any part of him could be evil.
Holding the baby burns, its skin hot against his arms, searing only for moments before cooling to a normal temperature. It grounds him, bringing him back from whatever plane of existence he was on; for a moment he’s overcome by a feeling that nearly brings him to his knees.
When it’s all said and done, they're sitting around a shitty motel coffee table and it’s as if nothing has changed. But it has.
“Okay.” Dean pointedly doesn't look at Cas, hoping that he didn't notice, what was no doubt, a long ass pause.
Dean pulls Cas into a hug, squishes Jack between the two of them, because suddenly even the little space they have between them seems too much. If he doesn't get closer and closer and closer, Cas will escape like ashes from a pyre; he’ll take Jack with him this time.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been stuck in his own mind, jumping from memory to memory, drowning in darkness, tearing himself apart looking for a way out.
It still smells like Cas, mixed with his own scent and Jacks, and he knows that soon even that will fade. Eventually, he’ll be left with nothing but faint memories and photos. Cas’s scent, his voice, the vividness of his eyes will fade and Dean will be left with
“I don't think-” Claire punches Cas in the arm and Dean can see the way he rolls with the blow to keep her from hurting herself. Then, she unceremoniously throws herself into Cas’s arms. It's only for a moment before pushing away abruptly and turning her sights on Dean. As if she moved quick enough no one would ever be able to tell it happened.
Cas deserves to know that he is loved. That Dean would do anything for him, because he would. He would do anything to keep Cas safe and keep their family together and to make sure that they made it out of whatever situation whole. He would do anything, say anything to make sure that Cas keeps smiling at him, keeps telling him that he loves him, and Cas deserves to know this.
“Uh, yeah.” Dean started placing his phone on his chest and letting Jack grip his other hand as well. He was worried that one of these days the kid's super strength would kick in and he'd lose a couple fingers. “One of us has to.”
Dean patiently waits for him to continue, eyes tracking the way Cas swallows nervously. And if that doesn't send anxiety spiraling down Dean’s spine.
He manages to catch Dodge City and Dave Mather before Sam slams the laptop shut with another glare. Dean nearly jumps over the counter to pull the laptop away, almost tipping Sam backwards off the chair, his next bite going flying across the table.
go,” His voice is like gravel as he leans his forehead against Dean’s. “I’ll go with you.” Dean lets out a shaky breath and feels Cas’s lips brush against his own.
Dean knows, now, to hold a burping rag under Jack's chin, carefully patting his back. His eyes flutter shut as he drinks from the bottle, hiding those blue eyes from view and making Dean’s chest ache. Blue eyes and brown hair, pale skin flawless and baby smooth where Dean runs his fingers along one cheek. He looked like a doll more than anything, any puffiness and redness already gone. That makes Dean pause because he knows that it can take a while before babies stop looking so… smooshed, but here Jack is.
Dean turns away from the flash of light, away from the searing of wings into the ground, only to find that the ground is no longer there.
Dean really doesn't want to make breakfast. The heaviness in the air that surrounds them turns Dean’s stomach; he doesn't think he could eat even if he wanted to. There was no Sam to cook for either, his absence settling around them.
He wonders if they’re gonna end up making a habit of kissing with Jack in between them and chuckles to himself as he pulls away.
Dean and Sam's childhood was crap, surfing from motel room to motel room, with the occasional stop at a babysitter or Bobbys. He wouldn't- no he
He doesn't notice that his hands have stopped moving until he feels the delicate brush of shadowy wings on the edges of his fingers.
It's the same feeling of fear that keeps him awake this time as well. Fear that, even with the promise, he will wake up and Cas will be gone, disappearing into the night to deal with his anger.
He knows what those signs point to. Knows how the dots would connect in Cas’s mind and he’s not wrong per-say, but Dean can’t talk about it.
The picture is of Cas, Sam, Claire, and him. He's not even sure of when it was taken, though he’s sure it was Jody’s handiwork. Claire is laughing at something Sam had said, her legs thrown over Cas’s, but Cas is too busy glaring at the camera. It's Dean himself that catches him off guard. He's looking at Cas like he hung the stars, like there was nothing more important in the world.
Claire cringes, taking a step back and Dean just sighs, waving for Sam to throw him one of the numerous burping rags lying around. He makes sure to clean up Jack’s face first, the outfit they had dressed him in a lost cause.
Cas’s trench coat stares back at him, folded over the bars of the crib like a blanket and all at once the fight goes out of him. He can hear Jack screaming from down the hall, and his breath is leaving him in sharp pants as tears finally fall.
“Did you want me to take the bottle to the kitchen?” He doesn't wait for an answer, reaching out to grab the bottle.
Instead, he tucks Jack into the crook of his arm after digging out the can of formula in the diaper bag. The trip to the kitchen is rather uneventful, Dean had to learn very quickly how to do things one handed. It was about half way back to Dean's room that Jack began to get fussy, tears and drool quickly making a mess of his face.
Instead, Dean curls up on his side as Cas leans back against the headboard. He buries his face in Cas’s hip, squishes the still bawling baby between Dean’s chest and his thigh.
This was originally supposed to be a really short sequel for the original fic and is slowly morphing into a whole fic in its own right.
Dean’s mouth snaps shut, shame hangs heavy over him but the anger still sits at the back of his throat.
is, or the man who’s spoken to him, or the woman perched on a chair, her hair spilling like blood over her shoulder) but he’s important.
Cas had died for them four times now, and only one of them had left a body. A human body that slumped over in the chair, who’s face he had cradled so gently, as if it would somehow save him, as if he could heal him with the anguish that swirled in his gut.
They had bought a soft cushioned carpet specifically for this reason about a week in. It was laid haphazardly in between one of the armchairs and the new couch they had also bought. It was soft enough that Jack would be comfortable, even when he got too tired to hold his head up and laid it in his hands.
“Cas.” It’s a word. A name he thinks. Something important, something that he’s forgotten. It’s significant in that it’s absence creates a hole in his mind where it should be.
He finds himself lost in the details, small scrapes and scuffs that Cas didn't bother fixing, a button nearly falling off, a smudge of paint along the cuff. But eventually his eyes are drawn to the hole where a silver knife had ended one of the last truly good things in his life.
“Change.” Dean himself turns around, willing the blush to leave as he peels off his flannel and henley. It doesn't help that he can hear Cas suck in a sharp breath, and his ears flush even more, no doubt a very unattractive shade of red.
Regret settles like a pit in his stomach as he looks at the carnage. Jack doesn't deserve to have his stuff destroyed because Dean can't handle his own grief.
He gets the crib and buys a playpen and other necessities, trying to block that entire conversation out of his mind. Jack is slowly growing discontent with staying in his carrier and he would be due for a change and a feeding soon.
Dean had thought that they learned their lesson with every single world ending event that had happened before. They needed to trust each other, talk about their plans and what they knew and didn't know. In their line of work keeping secrets gets you killed.
But that doesn't mean he doesn't want to. Dean wants a stiff drink with every fiber of his being. To get lost in the haze of alcohol and maybe kill a few things while he’s at it.
Cas wanted this kid. He wanted this kid enough to die for him. It is written plainly everywhere he looks. Cas and Kelly put so much thought and research into this, bought the best they could. They did their best to make this a house that Cas could raise the baby in. No matter what, Lucifer's blood or not, this baby was Cas’s.
“Do you want breakfast?” He says instead, ignoring the photo that’s already burning a hole in his front pocket. He carries it around with him everywhere, couldn't make himself to part with it. “I just finished cleaning up, but I'm sure I can find something quick.”
There’s so many things it could be, the ever shifting nature of their lives creating hundreds of reasons to put him on edge. There’s always something new, a new monster, a new villain, a new ally, and sometimes Dean finds it almost stifling.
Jack would have to be set up in Dean's room until they could find him a crib, and even then he would need around the clock attention for at least another 2 months before he could start sleeping through the night.
“He was that small?” Dean leans over to run a hand down Jack’s check, watching as his eyes fall shut. It never fails to make something in his chest ache. Jack was just so small and so trusting. Dean leaned over to kiss one of Jack's tiny hands that had latched onto his own.
When did he get on the bed? When did the tv get turned on? What show was this? The questions enter his mind and leave just as fast.
Dean is laying on the new carpet of the library, Jack on his stomach next to him, doing what the weird lady online had called ‘Tummy Time’. His little head lifts from his arms and he peers at Dean next to him, cooing quietly.
It was strange knowing that this was one of the most dangerous beings in the world, possibly more powerful than Lucifer himself. That nearly every force on heaven, hell, and earth was after this one being who couldn't be trusted to not scratch his own face. He couldn't even hold up his own head yet.
“I can get a general sense of his emotions most of the time.” Dean whips around to look at Cas. “Like right now, he likes the warm water, but he’s also slightly hungry so we should hurry.” Cas continues as if he didn't just drop a bomb on Dean.
It comes out of his mouth like a confession, a secret, meant to stay between him and Jack, who lays curled up on his chest. He rises and falls with every breath Dean takes, the motion calming his most recent crying fit.
.” Immediately Dean wants to get up, wants to cover his ears so he doesn't have to hear this. He doesn't want to hear Cas what Cas thinks of him, he would rather stay blind.
couldn't be without Jack. Dean clung to Jack as the last piece of Cas the same way that John had been so careful with Sam, in the days he was there, clinging to the idea of Mary in her youngest son. The thought scares him more than he would like.
The baby is completely silent for its first bath. Dean distinctly remembers the way that Sam would scream and cry when the water touched him. Bathtime was torture for the both of them until Sam was nearly three. But not this one, he simply looks at Dean throughout the entire process. Even as Dean pours the warm water over his head to wash the gore out of his hair, careful to keep the suds and water off his face, he simply squirms.
“Sam.” He tries to make his voice strong but, still, it wavers. Sam bolts up as if Dean had woken him. He regrets it, momentarily, this would turn out to be the longest drive home and he needed to stop every two hours to take care of Jack. That is if he even stuck to a normal newborn schedule.
He thinks, maybe, if he was here in front of him, things would make sense. As if the presence of one man would put him back together. Because he can feel it now, pieces of himself slipping away, bigger gaps where he should know things but he draws a blank.
So, they don’t talk. Even as they silently agree on tummy time, sitting cross legged with Jack between them, peering up with his too sharp eyes. They just stare blankly away from each other.
Sam pours the gasoline and the salt. Dean’s hands shake too much for him to hold anything but he cups the back of Jack's head through the wrap’s fabric. When he looks at him his eyes are open and bright, shining gold as he stares at the bodies. Dean has a feeling the baby is smarter than they know. It's as if he knows what's happening.
The tug in his chest rises into a full scream as Cas lights up from the inside, a sliver of that beauty shining through his eyes.
Dean’s breath catches in his throat the longer Cas is gone. He tries to focus on Jack in his hands, but his mind keeps coming back to the empty room. It's the first time Cas has been out of his range since he got back and Dean can feel his breaths coming in shorter and shorter.
Dean sees Cas’s eyes flickering from Jack back to himself, as if he couldn't choose what to look at first. He’s still standing too far away for Dean’s liking, the space between them drawing Dean forward until he’s toe to toe with Cas.
It makes sense; Dean knows it does. They’ve shared rooms before, hell Cas has been on and off traveling with them for nearly nine years. This wasn't nearly the weirdest thing that they had done, they’ve managed to squeeze the three of them in the Impala before. He’s slept huddled in between Cas and Benny for warmth more than once.
That takes Dean aback, startled by the sheer honesty lacing Cas’s voice. It’s not what he thought Cas was going to say, but this almost scares him more. This truth, thrown into his face, terrifies him. Because, that cuts to the quick of things doesn't it?
“What makes you say that?” Dean asks, finally placing Jack into the tub. He sucks in a shocked breath but doesn't cry. Blue eyes flash a dangerous gold for a split second before fading once again. “He usually doesn't cry in the bath, but if he does you can put a washcloth on his chest and he’ll calm down.
Cas had only been back for a day and he was already doing so well with Jack, so overwhelmingly gentle for someone who could just as easily kill a shapeshifter with a hard enough punch.
“He’s…” She pauses tilting her head slightly. It’s eerily similar to Cas’s confused face, up until the moment her nose scrunches slightly, like a bunny. “Squishy looking.” Sam snorts from his place across the table.
The ache in his chest has been constant since the pyre. It’s like he can’t breathe. Like there’s a vice grip on his lungs, his skin stretched taunt, too tight for his body.
Cas’s death is no longer an open wound, bleeding out, staining everything, but it sure is a bruise. Unnoticeable until you move the wrong way, put too much pressure on it, and then it’s all consuming.
That is until Dean tried to make Jack take his nap in the playpen and was met with earpiece shrieks.
She sits behind his eyelids like a ghost, haunting him. He can’t think, can’t breathe without feeling her absence like an ache. And the worst part is: he doesn't
Dean smiles as he drinks in the sight in front of him. Can’t help but sigh as Cas locks eyes with him, relief flooding through his veins, because Cas made it.
Dean tries to be okay for Jack, but he's slowly fading. He doesn't want to be here, on this earth where he doesn't have his Mom or Cas or Charlie or even Sam at the moment. He wants them back. Dean just wants and wants and wants and the ache in his chest never leaves anymore.
beg. This monster that has stolen his face doesn't deserve to make Dean beg, doesn’t deserve to hear the pleas fall from Dean’s lips.
But he doesn’t. Cas just presses him closer, a solid line of heat along his entire body. His arms are strong, Dean has seen them lift thousands of pounds, he’s seen them cradle a broken bird with a tenderness even Dean couldn't match.
Dean places his hand on the back of Jack’s head and pushes himself into a sitting position. Cas is looking at him, that same intense stare from the night before, as if he’s expecting Dean to suddenly get it.
“Hey Cas,” Dean’s voice breaks and he's forced to clear his throat. “I want you to meet your son, Jack.” Cas doesn't respond. Of course he doesn’t, but Dean desperately wishes he would. Wishes he would get up and ask to hold Jack. Dean would teach him how to support his head and make sure that he was secure. But, instead, the only noise is his own harsh breaths as the pain in his throat grows and Jack’s small snuffles against his chest.
Dean stumbles into the room, not startling Cas but making him glance up with a soft smile anyway. Jack is distracted by now, chewing on the horn of his moose while You Shook Me slides into D’yer Mak’er in the background.
The baby is squirming on the bed, the sheets around him charred and black. Someone (probably mom, his mind supplies, sending a bolt of pain through him) had started to clean Kelly up, but there was still blood on the sheets, coating her thighs.
Instead he carefully lays Jack in the middle of the bed. He is far too young to actually roll off the bed, but better safe than sorry. His cries slow after he has a fresh diaper and a full stomach. Instead he was letting out small whimpers, his eyes never leaving Dean.
Weeks of Cas being gone and Dean had already begun to forget the small little details. The taste of static and ozone when he was near, the rough texture of his coat, how feather soft his hair was and just how much Dean wanted to run his hands through it.
Cas watches with a blank expression as Dean carefully sits on the floor, his knees aching in protest. Dean pats the floor next to him before moving to place Jack face down on the carpet, rearranging his hands so that he could rest his head on them. Cas stiffly folds his legs underneath him as well, his knees knocking into Dean’s lightly.
Cas who he cared about. Cas who he had cared about for who knows how long, the two of them dancing around each other. Cas who had rebuilt him from scratch, but left his calluses so he wouldn't hurt himself. Who placed every freckle and mole.
“I didn’t mean to, Dean.” Dean’s hands shake as his name falls from Cas’s lips. “I just had to get back,” He pauses, tightening his grip on Jack, who is looking up at them as if they are a particularly interesting telenovela. “I could hear you calling me all the way back through the portal and I couldn't-”
The impermanence of their childhood means Sam never truly learned how to settle in one place. Even now, his room was consistently less lived in than Dean, his sheets with hotel corners, his shelves nearly empty, no furniture to make it truly his own. Sam didn't know what a home was. Maybe he almost figured it out when he was at Stanford, with Jess, but then Dean came to rip that away from him too.
Fleetingly, his mind is drawn back to the task that lays ahead of them. His mom is still out there somewhere, they had to figure out a way to keep Jack under the radar, but at this moment they don't really seem to matter.
It’s like looking at a stranger. Michael wears a dark tuxedo, a bow tie tucked neatly under his chin. He’s dressed to the nines, his hair slicked back perfectly. It’s not Dean, he looks far too comfortable in his skin for it to be Dean.
Dean wonders why Cas is being so open with him, looking at him with eyes that say none of this matters. Cas has never cared about speaking his mind, but it was unlike him to be this open. He was never so obvious about his emotions, not when he knew it would usually make Dean uncomfortable.
Neither had Dean, to be honest. Sam and Bobby John had both been about six months old when he started to care for them. Sam was able to stay sitting up, support his own head, and babble at Dean. He had already grown past the stage of waking up at night.
He takes a second to breathe, trying to calm the pain in his chest and he walks to the head of the table.
Dean can see it, a window opening into Michael’s mind, a blast of grace that singes Dean’s soul. It reminds Dean of the first touch of Jack’s grace, with none of the childish clumsiness. Any harm Jack had done in his first days on earth, it was done out of naivety, a child figuring out just how much pressure he can put before something breaks. Michael knows what his grace is capable of, how much it stings to be in contact with it, the harm he causes is purposeful.
The tall one pushes him into the bathroom, away from the woman who he doesn't seem to trust, who looks at him with curious eyes. He sets him on the toilet as he sits on the edge of the bathtub.
Dean wakes with a gasp, automatically reaching towards Jack’s bassinet, his cries still ringing, only to find him missing. He spins wildly until green meets blue and feels his breath catch.
His only company is the baby's soft puffs of air against his chest and the slowly cooling body of his best friend.
He slides a hand fully under his shirt, until his fingers line up against a scar he can’t see but he knows is there. He doesn’t even know how he knows it, but he does. It sends an ache down to his very bones. There’s a feeling in his chest, like he’s being ripped apart and put back together. He hopes that the ache will somehow bring him clarity.
Part of him feels a little silly. It's a common phase, but after last night it had taken on a new meaning, his whole world readjusting, his mental dictionary rearranging so the phase sits at the forefront.
Suddenly a scream rips through the air, so loud Dean has to cover his ears. It's loud enough that it moves the flames making them ripple through the air.
“I know.” Cas’s voice is like gravel as he stalks up to Dean, but his face is brighter, happier as he leans in to press a kiss to Dean’s mouth. Dean lets him, a smile tugging on his own lips making it more clumsy than he would have wished.
A whole night in an empty room, no steady rush of breath from the bassinet, no crying to wake him up from whatever nightmare has taken over that night, no fluttering heartbeat as he rests Jack on top of his own chest. The thought alone is making him freeze up as he slips one of Jack’s feet into the sleeper.
Dean never told Cas to stay until it was too late. He didn't understand what Cas had meant until he was leaving a bloody handprint over a faded scar and sacrificing himself so that Dean could live.
Dean can't bring himself to talk, mouth opening and closing but nothing comes out. Sam keeps looking at him that same guarded look in his eyes that he got every time their dad was upset. It makes Dean want to scream, and rage and punch something until his knuckles crack and bleed.
It’s nothing more than a press of lips, definitely not Dean’s best work, but it's with Cas. Far from perfect, with Jack still between the two and in some dark alley in some shithole town and his asshole brother trying to be quiet as he slips into the car behind them. But Dean honestly couldn't care less.
Dean knows Sam still feels guilty over their mom’s death, over Jess’s, Madison’s, Amy’s, Kevin’s. The hundreds of people they’ve failed to save, the thousands they’ve put in danger just by existing. Sam blames himself for everything and Dean is doing nothing but giving him more blame. Another sin to weigh down his soul.
Instead he leans down and presses a kiss to Jack’s head as he lays back down, facing their way this time.
It's not a picture perfect moment like the movies where he runs and Cas rushes to greet him, arms open wide. Dean moves with cautious steps as if Cas will disappear if he moves too fast. He walks up to Cas step by trembling step until they're in front of each other. Neither looks away.
“Why are you so upset?” It's a genuine question and Dean knows that Cas is looking at him so earnestly, a little frown on his face that makes Dean want to smooth it away. “Dean, we’ve kissed, we have a child together.” It's said like a question, one Dean doesn't want to answer. He knows this must be confusing for Cas, it's almost confusing for Dean himself and he struggles to put it into words.
Sam gives him a disbelieving look but waits until Jack has passed out and Dean has managed to get him in the playpen before he speaks again.“What's the worst that can happen Dean, we're in a warded bunker and you'd be an hour away, max.”
Every two hours Dean pulled over into whatever stop he could find, pulling the camping stove out of the trunk to heat the bottles of water taken from Cas’s house. With steady hands he measures out the powder into the bottle perched on the trunk of the Impala and struggles to pull himself out of the memories threatening to drown him.
Dean aches for revenge, against Lucifer, against Kelly, against Jack, but he could never get it. Lucifer is gone, took his mother with him, Kelly is dead and Jack….
It doesn't help that Jack is obviously picking up on their mood, whining and squirming while Dean changes him. He gets a hand in Dean’s hair while he's carrying over his shoulder and yanks so hard that Dean lets out a cry of pain, delicately trying to get Jack’s fingers untangled.
It's three days later that Sam finally comes back. Jack is asleep in his playpen, having just eaten, and Dean is taking a break from painting the nursery a beer loose in his hand.
A child who doesn't look like a child, who looks enough like Cas that it aches. His blue eyes peer around curiously and he is so innocent, not even a day old.
“You're just going to…” Cas pauses and tilts his head, his nose wrinkling in a way that should no way look cute on a man who's pushing forty. “Put him on the floor.” That manages to drag a chuckle out of Dean, lightening the mood just slightly. His quiet words are enough that it starts to sooth Dean’s dour mood.
Dean looks down and sees Jack's face, screwed up and crying. Something in him breaks and he feels a tear fall before he can stop it. He can't find the words to comfort Jack. Words never come easy when he is going through shit like this, so instead he sways side to side cradling him in his arms and buries his face in baby soft hair.
“Dude, shoes off! I don't need mud and shit on my bed.” Dean exclaims. Cas solemnly places his feet back onto the floor and leans over to unlace his shoes, kicking them off in a manner that strikes Dean as so human it nearly takes his breath away.
Dean wasn't going to be the kind of dad who's always leaving, even if it means he has to put serious hunting on the backburner for now. Maybe once Jack gets a bit older he can start going on day trips, but not now. Not when Jack needs him to be here.
He tries to memorize every piece of this moment, from the blue of Cas’s eyes to the ozone smell that surrounds him like the beginnings of a thunderstorm. The weight of Jack in his arms and the warmth emanating from Cas like a furnace. Even Sam awkwardly coughing in the background.
The walk back to Jack gives him more time to let the shame settle somewhere in his chest, doubling as he walks into the main room.
The first blow comes while Cas is changing Jack, leaning down to blow a raspberry onto Jack’s stomach with the most serious expression Dean’s ever seen. Jack is letting out wheezing giggles. Dean has seen Jack smile before, but hearing him actually laugh? It knocks the breath out of Dean. He leans heavily on the doorframe, his face in his hands and tries to work through the feeling in his chest. He turns and walks away, only to be drawn back to the scene a couple minutes later, Cas and Jack giving him matching gummy smiles as he walks inside the room.
Cas’s anger is rarely loud. It's not like Dean, where, even before the mark, he exploded in rage. Dean’s anger is fast growing, quick to leave. So overwhelming in the moment that you can't look away. A bolt of lightning: deafening, blinding, gone in a blink.
“It’s fine.” He says instead, slightly more confident this time. He slips a sock onto each tiny foot, and the onesie over Jack’s head, trying his best to keep from spiraling. He counts the little bees on the onesie and quickly realizes it's the same one they had taken from the lake house. It makes his heart jolt sharply in his chest.
Jack has always woken up strangely for a baby, no outward sign that he was really awake besides his eyes, flickering open and focusing on whoever was closest at the time. Usually Dean.
Crowley doesn't appreciate being dragged around the country. He cares about Dean. A crooked smile curls over Dean’s face when he thinks about it, the King of Hell
He can feel Cas’s eyes on him all throughout dinner. They track his movements, catch his own gaze as they pass Jack back and forth, feeding him and getting him ready for bed. He wants to say something. It sits in the air between them, sours the lighthearted mood they had finally started to get back.
The flashback to Cas sitting on a motel bed, pawing through Dean’s toiletries like he owned them, is so vivid that Dean has to push himself off the bed. He has to pace around the room, his arms feeling strangely empty.
Dean grabs the can of paint lying on the floor and launches it with a roar at the far wall, yellow splattering like blood. His own boils in his veins and he's so, so angry.
He presses his face closer to Cas’s side, because Dean knows. Cas may have read 74 parenting books but he’s read more than a handful of mommy blogs trying to figure out how to not fuck this up. More than a couple had said how dangerous it could be to co-sleep with a baby, how you could roll over, or push them on accident.
“Of course, Dean.” As simple as that, Cas seems to act as if everything was okay, as if he didn't just pull the rug out from under Dean’s feet. He walks up to Dean and pulls Jack away gently, pressing the baby’s face into his shoulder and humming under his breath.
you to stay. I can’t do this without you. I don't want to do this by myself and-” Dean shuts his eyes and turns his face into Cas’s palm, he can't think about the look on Cas’s face. The way his mouth softens, pulls into the smallest smile. The tears that gather in his eyes.
For long periods in time, Dean floats untethered in the black abyss of his mind, Michael giving up his attempt to subdue him with memories.
Last time he had checked, the bags under his eyes had developed their own bags and his hair looks had been sticking up at random angles, three day old gel flaking off.
Finally, Dean can't take it anymore, pushing to his feet, careful of Jack who is still peering up at them. Cas doesn't seem to be scared of him leaving, just watching as Dean paces across from him. He keeps talking.
Dean presses a kiss to Cas’s hair, his forehead, anywhere he can reach, just to assure himself that he was there, that this was real.
“Claire looks like you.” Cas says matter of factly, as if he didn't make the bottom of Dean’s stomach drop out. “She acts like you, too. It’s why I encouraged
Dean can pretend all he wants, has been pretending from the moment Cas has fallen limp on the grass. That Cas wasn’t actually dead, that he would one day walk through the door of that bunker, that he himself was okay. That he was dealing with this the right way.
But still, she has the power to drag him around like a dog on a leash, digging her claws deeper and deeper until she’s all he can think about.
seen Sam in Jack’s place. The boy with demon blood, Lucifer’s pawn, the world coming after him because of something he can’t control.
Dean then let’s one hand run gently along soft brown spikes of hair, careful of the soft spot, and curls the other behind his head.
It isn't until Cas pulls gently on the baby’s hand that he finally lets go. He takes Jack from Dean’s arms, their fingers brushing. It makes Dean inhale sharply.
Dean nods along, far too exhausted mentally to reply in any coherent way. It just seems par for the course at this point, Cas can sense Jack’s emotions and Jack can sense Dean’s and Dean is just lost, adrift alone and trying to figure things out on his own.
“Wings, yeah.” Jack sleepily looks up at Cas, eyes glowing the same gold they always did when his wings were out. “Happens when he’s really happy, or upset, or even when he’s tired.” Dean pulls open one of his nightstand drawers and adds the feathers to the rapidly growing pile in there.
This was a different kind of pain, though. This is inexpressible, his soul slipping piece by piece into corruption.
Dean had kissed Cas, had spent the last two months that he was gone mourning him like a widower. He was inconsolable when he was… gone, he hasn’t let Cas leave his sight for more than a couple minutes at a time since he had gotten back. They’ve slept in the same bed for the past two nights. Hell, Dean looked Cas in the eye and
Finally he pulls back, lets their cheeks brush, stubble against stubble. Rests his forehead against Cas’s, eyes closed, feels the brush of air as Cas lets out an unsteady breath.
“You-” Claire’s voice seems to almost crack and she squeezes her eyes shut for a moment before opening them in a poisonous glare once more. “You’re not allowed to die again.” She states simply, and it's all Dean can do to hold in a bark of laughter. “That’s my dad’s body you're wearing and you better take better care of it or you can find a new one.”
Before he placed the sheet over Cas’s head for the final time he once again leaned over, pushing Cas’s hair away from his eyes.
Dean had never understood comfortable silences until he met Cas. He always had to talk, fill the silence in a room, or else it would smother him.
It takes Jack 20 minutes to finish his bottle and by the time Cas shuffles forward, Dean is nearly asleep.
There’s no answer as it is, Sam stays silent as they spiral closer and closer through the looping halls of the bunker.
“Why would I want that?” Dean insists. Cas’s eyes look wild. They look haunted, like he felt every one of his couple million years in that room right there, pressing down on him at once. It's the same look that he had while he talked about his brief stint as a god, about the terror and destruction he reigned down on heaven. The same look he gave Dean while telling him he couldn't live with the guilt.
Family doesn't start or end in blood and Cas had chosen this baby as part of their family. Who is Dean to spite his dying wish?
Sam leaves him alone in the bathroom, shuts the door softly behind him and immediately picks up a hushed conversation with Rowena.
He looks back at the trench coat lying over the edge of the bed, and then looks back to Cas who is watching him intently. He still looks scruffy and sleep-worn in Dean’s clothes, even without having actually slept. Dean doesn't think he’s ever looked better.
Why did they have to talk about this? Why couldn't Cas let a good thing be? Don't fix what isn't broken (even if at the moment they did seem pretty broken, trading stolen glances over their son).
Never has Dean prayed to whoever would listen to bring him back. Never had he fallen to his knees and
But now, with his screaming baby tucked against his chest and the person he loves staring at him with questions in his eyes, he just
Dean snatches the trenchcoat up and collapses against the wall like all his strings have been cut. He lets his tears stain the fabric as he buries his face in it.
The words strike somewhere deep in Dean’s soul, somewhere so ugly and dark that no one deserves to be subject to. The pit of self doubt and blame and shame mixed into some fucked up tangle of emotions that Dean himself doesn't want to touch.
There is something about the night that makes things seem hazy. Like what you say and do don’t quite matter like they do in the daylight. The daylight exposes too much, gives another layer to vulnerability that Dean can’t afford to lose.
“You know she doesn't think of you like that.” Cas gives Dean a look, but lets him keep his hand. “At the very least we’re like the weird uncles.” Cas moves to take his hand away, but Dean pulls him back. “No -look- Cas, you can't change what happened, but you’re doing the absolute best you can to make it up to her, now. And
If you want to hear my insane ramblings about supernatural I’m @deanwinchesterforbatman2k21 on Tumblr.
“Yeah, look.” Dean rests his hand lightly on Jack’s back, just to reassure him that he was there. They watch as Jack lifts his little head, peering at them with his head tilted in a way that reminds Dean far too much of someone. “He’s lifting his head up and when he gets tired he’ll lay back down and eventually his head and shoulders will get stronger.”
Cas looks away as if he has something to hide, but Dean can feel the prickle of his gaze on the back of his neck when he’s turned away. Even that is wrong, it doesn’t carry the same weight as it should.
Dean’s honestly too tired to figure out what that means. He just drags a hand down his face and tries to hold in one of the biggest yawns of his life.
“Cas.” Dean grounds out. He can feel the prickling heat of a blush on the back of his neck and refuses to look away from a squirming Jack. “Just get on the bed.” Because there was no way he was making Cas sit on an uncomfortable chair all night. He wasn't that much of a dick.
“You?” Dean starts, climbing to his feet with Jack clutched tightly to his chest. “Sammy, you’ve never been alone with a baby for more than five minutes, no way am I leaving you with Jack for ‘a day or two.’”
“No one took care of him besides me.” Dean finally admits when Jack has finally stopped crying. He falls back into a peaceful sleep to the rise and fall of Dean’s chest. He knows the reaction he’s going to get, but he’s frankly tired of dancing around the fact. “I got up with him every night. I wouldn't let Sam take him, not even if he tried, and trust me he tried.”
“Here,” Dean starts and grabs Cas’s arm. “Hold your arms like this okay, you need to remember to support his head, he can only hold it up by himself for a little bit.” Cas gives him a wide eyed look but lets Dean position his arms properly.
“I wish you could listen to me for once, Dean.” Dean nearly snarls, marching away from where Jack was sleeping. This might get loud and he honestly didn't want to risk waking him. Sam continued to follow him all the way back to the war room. “If you keep going like this you're gonna wear yourself out and then you'll be no use to anyone.”
blue. They’re so blue the sky framing his face seems washed out in comparison. Dean wants to run his fingers through dark hair.
The thing is: Dean wants this thing that they have between them to be permanent, he wants to keep Cas. He
Dean is so consumed by his own guilt and fear that Jack’s cries sound far away, his fingers tightening more until he can feel the bones creak.
Dean wants to scream. He wants to kick him out, to send him on his way. The kid had no right to come into their lives and just destroy everything, tell him things he didn’t need to know.
Dean wonders what she did to deserve Sam’s ire. He draws a blank. He already can’t quite remember what shade her hair is, what accent she has.
Him and Cas had watched Tombstone before, but Dean needs something familiar. He collapses back into the couch, careful of Jack already half asleep in his arms, and drags Cas down with him.
It leaves Dean with nothing to do but think, nothing to do but grasp at the memories he can already feel fading.
“We've lost everything and now you're gonna bring him back. Okay? You're gonna bring back Cas, you're gonna bring back Mom, you're gonna bring them all back. All of them. Even Crowley.” Another pause, a breath, then two. But there's no answer. No phone call from Cas, no laugh as Crowley appears out of nowhere like the goddamn cheshire cat. Absolutely nothing and anger rises like bile at the back of his throat.
Dean pushes off the counter, opening his mouth to argue back, before Cas gives him another look and he settles back with his arms crossed.
Dean scoffs but settles on the bed anyway, patting the spot next him. “Of course he does, I painted and decorated it myself.” Shame and regret burn like acid at the back of his throat. Images pop up in his mind, unbidden, of furniture knocked over, baby clothes strewn across the floor, the crunch of wood under his boot and he does his best to ignore it.
Cas is trailing him through the halls of the bunker, Jack’s tiny form in one arm and the other wrapped around a bottle. He’s looking around, categorizing the changes, the sudden cleanliness of the halls and walkways.
Dean walks over to Jack’s dresser and pulls out a sleeper, socks, and a clean onesie. It was cold enough in the bunker that they had to dress him in layers along with whatever blanket was in the bassinet and Cas’s trench coat. He tosses them onto the bed and turns to grab Jack.
He spends time with the people he’s lost. Laughs with Charlie, settles in to watch a game with Bobby, sits back and clinks his drink with Crowley.
“I think you're the only thing keeping me alive right now.” He admits letting his cheek rest on baby soft hair.
Jack is awake by the time they set his carrier on the radar in the war room. He’s gazing around with that same wide eyed curiosity, like he didn't live there and see the room daily.
They don't talk about it and, although part of Dean is scared that it will fester and drive Sam away again, he’s almost relieved. Dean knew he was being an ass, knew that he can’t do this alone
Dean was put in charge of a kid he had never met before, who could already care and think for himself. Who could take an angel blade to the chest and survive. This wasn’t a baby, even if he was born yesterday.
So no, Dean can’t hurt Cas. He holds the knife between them but they both know he will never use it.
At one point Cas mentions wanting to start a garden, and Dean begins making a to-to list in his head.
It’s a devastating mixture of the two that surrounds Dean. They’re looped around him, a hand on his chest and another wrapped around his waist, pulling him closer with a hidden strength that makes Dean’s bones creak. He can see Cas out of the corner of his eye. Truly
“I said change.” Dean picks up his clothes and throws them in the hamper across the room before walking back over to Jack’s bassinet. “If you want Jack to sleep at all tonight you're going to have to hand over the trenchcoat.” He listens to the shuffling behind him and tucks jack in. Sometimes, if Jack was particularly colicky, Dean would have to swaddle him like a little burrito, but tonight he’s already half asleep. He reaches out for Dean's hand as he pulls up the pale yellow blanket. Dean smiles down at Jack, leans over to kiss his forehead gently, suddenly overcome with affection for him.
“Ready to blow this joint.” He waits until Cas smiles and nods tears still shining in his eyes, until the rumble of something in the distance turns into a roar before activating it and watching the darkness around them disappear in a flash of light.
“Dean,” The harsh gravel of Cas’s voice makes Dean’s eyes fall shut, scared of what he has to say, and more scared of him not saying anything. “I promise you I'll do everything I can to get her back.”
A thought strikes him and Dean glances over at the library, scanning the new couch they had placed in there. He tugs Cas with him, finger slotting together just as perfectly as they have every time.
Dean doesn’t care about Amara, she’s nothing more than a stranger, and a dangerous one at that. She was a baby, someone who Dean had naturally found the need to protect.
For all intents and purposes it's just a baby, and something in Dean softens. Then, he sees the baby's eyes and nearly takes a step back, sucking in a sharp breath automatically.
“I, uh,” Sam stutters, sliding his laptop back towards himself. “I already called Claire to help me take care of it.” He admits, scratching at the back of his neck, making Dean spin back around with an upfronted look.
Dean takes a shuddering breath, trying to calm himself, trying to figure out a way to tell Cas without this blowing up in his face. Trying to find a way to keep the both of them from getting hurt.
They shine in the low light of the motel room, reminding Dean of every quiet conversation he and Cas have had in some dingy motel while Sam slept behind them. It was the innocence, he guessed.
Sam can’t be a monster because he’ll always be that tiny kid, curled into a playpen, tucked into the corner of a motel room. And, Dean can’t be a monster because Sam will always idolize him. The grander than life big brother who protects him from the monsters under his bed.
