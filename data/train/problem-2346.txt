“But I am disappointed in you now,” Sherlock said between kisses, his voice husky with arousal. “For taking so long to understand what I was trying to tell you. I thought you were more intelligent than that.”
John pondered for a moment. “Maybe . . . she never paid up then? Since the spirit never got its end of the deal before she died, wouldn’t it stay until someone else set things right?”
“The Walters have a history of schizophrenia, and there’s a good chance it lay dormant in Josephine since birth. You know this already. And John, with your history of PTSD, we don’t know that this wasn’t some kind of panic attack. With utmost respect, we can’t really trust your word either."
“No, please!” Victor blubbered. Moriarty stood and nodded to the man holding Victor at gunpoint, his eyes void of any emotion or sympathy. The man clicked a bullet into the chamber of his gun and, without a second’s hesitation, shot him in the head.
John silently swore to himself. He would have to get through three of these parties with Sherlock. Specifically, with Sherlock looking like
The two of them had been living together at Baker Street for one month now. And although they’d settled in fairly quickly, neither were used to the safety and security their new lives provided them. Sherlock worried when John didn’t arrive home when expected. John worried when Sherlock didn’t answer his calls. And so on. It was natural, given the chaotic and dangerous lives they were used to living. It would take more than a month to let go of the effects those experiences had on them, but they were making progress.
Instead he focused on cleaning his chest. He brushed his thumb over a patch of skin a bit too slowly . . . a bit too softly . . . lingering a bit too long. His eyes met Sherlock’s for the briefest moment before darting back down to the cuts.
“Who said anything about taking lives? I’m simply going to take what I need from them, and if they seem to possess valuables, rob them of everything they own that could prove to be of use to me.”
Sherlock’s concentrated eyes darted back and forth between his, probably trying to tell if he was having a panic attack or not. John took a steadying breath.
Glancing up, he found Sherlock gazing down at him with mixed confusion and awe. He straightened back up, running his hands over his bare torso.
And the time they had shared a room at the Baskerville inn. Sherlock had caught him watching him as he slept in the middle of the night. Neither had said a word to break the silence, but instead continued to watch each other in the soft intimate darkness.
Sherlock had stopped visiting him after the drugging incident, and John had never gotten an explanation. So it took him by surprise when Sherlock turned up this evening. Before he could even begin questioning, John decided to fess up.
John gritted his teeth. Hearing her joke about their closeness, which she did quite often, always irritated him to no end. She didn’t know what it was like for him before Sherlock died. She didn’t know how essential they once were to each other’s being. She didn’t know anything.
Dear God, she knew they kissed. John just knew it. She had to know. There’s no other reason she would be calling.
Their knees knocked contentedly under the table, and neither made any attempt to move them. Sherlock’s fingers drummed lightly. But not impatiently, like they usually did. More like there was a tune in his head, as he was tapping it out absent-mindedly.
“Do you know why I told him to kill himself?” She shook her head again. “It’s little Johnny boy,” he whispered like it was a secret. “He’s a sum of everything Sherlock has tried to shield himself from all his life. All those pesky feelings. So I gave him a choice. Kill himself, or see his dear doctor die. Either way, they were to be permanently separated. And thus, his heart burned out.”
Fire surrounded them. Smoke clouded their vision. Keeping low to the ground, they looked for an escape. All of the entrances to hallways were blocked off by fire except one. They nodded to each other in understanding, and bolted toward it, making it out just before it was overtaken by flames.
When the sun went down and the sky had gone dark, John and Sherlock prepared for their trip back downstairs. Flashlight batteries were all freshly replaced to avoid a repeat of what had happened last night.
Aggressive footsteps thudded down the stairs. Sherlock, John, Molly, and Greg looked curiously towards the sound. It was late into the night, and they had all just gotten comfortable and were dozing off.
She’d also met a woman named Gretta Norton. They’d been married for one year. She told him all about their life in New Orleans. She said there was no need to write back. She had just come across John’s blog on the internet and wanted to reach out. She preferred to write rather than call or email. Ever since leaving London, she’d done her best to stay “off the grid.” The only thing Sherlock could find about her on the internet was her photography.
“A trusted coworker of mine, Ryan. He’s very good, I promise. He said everything seemed to check out fine.”
John’s heart nearly leapt a foot out of his chest. He swallowed and chose his next words cautiously, careful not to sound too hopeful. “So, what you’re saying is-”
“Umm, excuse me?” John said, taking a step forward to signal that he wanted to pass. His body heated up inside his jacket, despite the evening chill. Adrenaline coursed through him, almost as a conditioned response. The men still didn’t move.
Victor laid a hand on his shoulder. “Will you be going to bed now, Captain?” Sherlock brushed his hand off none too gently.
When the silence dragged on a bit too long for comfort, John loudly cleared his throat and averted his eyes.
As the man pulled his arm back to punch, a deep, baritone voice bellowed out, “Mr. Jackson!” The man released him and John fell to the ground on his back. He heard authoritative footsteps slowly approach them. “If I wanted our prisoner beaten and pummeled I would have given the order to do so as soon as he was brought on board. And I certainly would not have assigned the task to someone who spent his first ten waking minutes today struggling to wrestle out of a tangled, inside-out shirt and then proceeded to spill his breakfast all over his lap like a bumbling idiot. For future reference, Mr. Jackson, you are to do only as I instruct you and nothing else. Is that clear?”
John heard the men scurry away and finally dared to move. He attempted to sit up when a shiny black boot on his chest shoved him back down. He looked up, and on the other end of it was a tall, lean man squinting down at him. He had a pale skin and head of messy, black curls topped off by an impressive black pirate hat. He wore a thin, white shirt with a long, black coat that trailed behind him dramatically.
“It’s in my coat,” he said. Sherlock’s enthusiastic smile dropped somewhat, and he nodded his thanks.
This is the first time I've every written something romantic like this! It was quite fun ;) Please, please comment with your feedback!
He got a few mumbles in return, and a genuine smile from Leah. With that, he turned down the hallway and walked down to his bedroom. He paused in front of his door with his hand on the handle. It was only 7, o’clock, he thought. He still had another five hours before he had to call Sherlock. Five hours to himself where he knew everyone else in the motel would be engrossed in a game. He pulled his hand back from the knob and looked down the rest of the hallway that he hadn’t explored yet.
He was taken back to that first day they spent together. When they were on their way to dinner after the case and Sherlock had looked at him like there was something . . . more.
“Sherlock,” he breathed, looking down at the foamy, white bubbles where his companion had vanished. All feeling drained from his body as he fell limp and slumped down to the floor once again. This time, Molly’s soft arms enclosed around him, cradling him to her chest. Greg kneeled on his other side putting his hand on his shoulder.
Furious, Sherlock stormed up several levels before reaching the captain’s quarters, resting his hand on the door handle, and closing his eyes. His cold-hearted antics had always gotten prisoners to crack almost instantly in the past. Why was this one being so infuriatingly stubborn? And his hat looked fantastic on him, thank you very much!
Throughout the rest of the blissful day, John tried to ignore Victor and just be happy with Sherlock, but he could not ignore the sight of him, Jackson, and Bolt muttering secretively in a corner shooting fuming glances at the two of them.
The whole time, Sherlock listened, silent and still. Never once interrupting him or moving from his spot half-climbed up into his lap.
When it finally began to ease up, he was a red-eyed, sniffling mess leaning heavily into the corner of the walls. He could breathe easily once again, minus the occasional hiccup and shuddering breath.
“Alright,” she said, unbelieving. “Well, Stace and I should be heading out anyway. We’ll leave you to find your . . . er, friend.”
Sherlock looked around, exaggerating his motions with big, bugging eyes. “Okay. Got a feel for it. I’ll go upstairs and you take the cellar. Not afraid of the basement are you?” he said with a smirk before walking away.
John stood in front of him. He looked completely and utterly lost. Normally when Sherlock couldn’t explain something, he grew frustrated. He would stay up all night, screeching away at his violin, and being an utter pain until he figured it out. It was a game to him, and he didn’t like losing.
Sherlock chuckled in amusement at his act. He couldn’t help it. The boy looked back at him, his eyes positively sparkling. He cocked his head as if to say ‘You can do better then? as the next verse approached.
He landed on top of Sherlock, cradling his head to prevent it from hitting the ground. “Thank you,” Sherlock said coarsely.
In the kitchen, he and Sherlock stood with their backs facing each other, one getting the cream and sugar, the other getting the cups and kettle. John reached up into the cabinets and pulled out three mugs. His back prickled with the feeling of someone standing close, and he turned to find himself face-to face with Sherlock, their noses nearly touching.
Sherlock finally turned around and took in his sleepless, baggy eyes, his unchanged daytime clothes, and most importantly, the bags at his feet. Immediately, his demeanor softened. He set the violin down and rushed forward to help him with his bags.
But finally they had arrived at the hotel and were being escorted to their seats. The party was in a gorgeous, lavishly decorated hall. The walls were lined in intricate wallpaper and small candle lights. A beautiful, grand chandelier hung from the center of the ceiling, casting bright light onto the scene below it. Several round tables draped in white tablecloth were scattered methodically throughout the room. Up front and center was a wide, open space: a dance floor, no doubt. No one was currently on it, though light, casual music played softly in the background.
As he listened, he looked past her for a moment as an odd sight caught his eye. Up on the bow, Victor was shouting viciously at Sherlock, who flinched multiple times at the verbal abuse. He was too far to hear what the argument was about, but Sherlock looked so hurt and defenseless, he knew there were very few topics that could weaken him like that.
The intro piano chords to Faithfully filled the room. John’s head snapped up, nostalgia flooding through his chest; he knew those notes anywhere.
Up in his second-floor room, he changed into his t-shirt and pants and climbed into bed. The last thing he had wanted to do was go to bed by himself tonight after what had happened.
Mary glared down at them. Her cold, distant mask had shredded. In its place was a horrid scowl, a furious red-hot glare. She shook her head at John’s stupidity and pulled a spare gun out of her coat.
“This man is a business thug. He runs several companies that all operate in a complex network composed of blackmail, bribery, back-alley deals, and crime. He’s the kind of man who always gets what he wants. The money he earns for himself and for his business is tarnished. Almost never acquired legally.”
Then came a hard thud in front of him. He opened his eyes and saw Moriarty falling to his knees, his glassy eyes looking right through him. A dark circle expanded on his chest and pooled down the front of his white shirt. He fell forward face-down with a final thud.
They anchored off of Moriarty’s ship leaving his crew lost and confused without their captain. Sherlock reassured everyone that nothing of value had been lost and it was not worth risking their lives again to try to win their stuff back. It was best to leave them be.
They looked at the gun and then at each other. John started towards it, but stopped when she made a move towards Sherlock instead.
He shook John’s hand firmly and released it, leaving John dumbfounded. John shook his head in confusion and turned back around. The men were still standing in his way.
John knew he was the one who needed to apologize. For for keeping secrets, for pushing him away, for abandoning him, for putting him in danger. For all of it.
“I told you what was going to happen to you for leaving me, John. I told you I would burn the heart out of you. Just like Moriarty told Sherlock he would right here next to this pool. I gave you one job, and since you failed me, you get to watch him die right here in front of you. By your own gun, in fact.”
His eyes snapped to him in question. John smiled and rose from his chair, walking across the floor to turn on their radio. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Sherlock,” he breathed, relaxing into the door as Sherlock began running his nose along his cheek and jaw. He brought his free hand up to card through the curls on his nape. His other hand was lifted by their joined fingers and pressed gently into the door.
John smiled devilishly and climbed back up his body on all fours, more than happy to comply. He dipped down and captured his waiting lips in a soft, caressing kiss. As he lapped into his mouth, he wormed his hand down between his legs.
After stepping side-to-side for some time, Sherlock lifted his hand slightly. John picked up on the suggestion. It was the beginning of a routine they they had done countless times during the dance lessons.
John woke up the next morning to the sound of rattling keys and his cell door creaking open. The gray-haired man called Lestrade smiled weakly at him. “The Captain wants you up on deck.”
“It’s fine. I’ll try again tomorrow.” Tomorrow. He thought. John will go without food or drink all the way until tomorrow. If intimidation and food deprivation had no effect on him, there was no point in denying him something to eat.
“Sherlock, look at me. Look at me.” He none too gently smacked the man’s cheek until he opened his eyes. Molly helped John lift the shivering man until he was heavily leaning on both of them in a sitting position. “Get him a blanket,” he ordered no one in particular. “Quickly. Now,” he said when no one made a move. After another moment, he looked up and directly at Victor. “DO IT!” Victor scrambled to the nearest room, Sherlock’s quarters, to get a blanket.
He jogged to keep up with Sherlock who was bustling around giving orders and only half paying attention to him.
But he would rather have Sherlock as a friend than not have him in his life at all. If that meant a lifetime of unrequited feelings and unspoken love, so be it. At least they would be together - sort of. He heaved a heavy sigh and at last got out of bed.
That night, John and Sherlock laid together in bed, Sherlock’s head on John’s chest, his soft curls being stroked lazily. John had decided not to bring up the previous night again. If Sherlock wanted to tell him, trusted him enough to tell him, he would do it on his own. Luckily for him, he did.
Sherlock looked over at Molly, who was removing her dishes from the cabinets and placing them in a container. He normally didn’t socialize much with anyone who wasn’t John. The time he spent with others was limited almost solely to family or work-related events. He just didn’t see the point in spending useless time with others. But John must have caught him in a good mood, because the idea of going to a group dinner with these people – his
“What on earth would we do at the flat? Let’s stop somewhere for lunch instead. You didn’t have breakfast before meeting me at the morgue.”
“Sherlock told me about what happened at the pool with, er, Mary,” he said, as if unsure it was okay to say her name. “Nasty business.”
John took his time eyeing up his entire body, drinking in every detail. Realizing his mouth was hanging open, he quickly snapped it shut and finally met Sherlock’s gaze. Sherlock looked smugly back at him and adjusted his tie, as if he knew exactly how he looked. Lowering his head slightly, he gazed at John through his ridiculously long eyelashes and smirked playfully.
He couldn’t get enough. The feeling of Sherlock’s warm lips pressed so firmly against his filled his stomach with warmth that spread through his whole body. After waiting so long, once he was able to do this, he couldn’t stop. His heart expanded with the love he felt for him, and the complete fulfillment and certainty of this.
“I’m calling bullshit.” A pair of large hands grabbed John by the hair and pulled him up to his knees. He was unable to tell if the scream he heard was out loud or just in his mind. He tried opening his eyes again, but they lolled back into his head. A cold blade pressed into his neck.
“It reminded me of that purple shirt of yours that I like. I just thought you might like something different. But if you want your old one, blue and cotton, I can return it. It’s fine. Not a big deal. I just thought you might like this one. But if you don’t, it’s okay.”
“For the sake of your well-being I suggest you cooperate upon being questioned. The faster you surrender the information I ask of you the better off you will be.”
Giddy smiles grew and remained plastered onto both of their beaming faces as they danced in careless circles around the living room.
John breathed heavily through gritted teeth, fighting through the pain in his throbbing head, his burning chest, his aching ribs.
"Thank God," he breathed. The tiny tingle of panic in his chest settled down as he fished through his pockets and pulled out his phone.
John had happened to own an identical flash drive and had scrawled Mary’s initials on them before Christmas dinner. That was the one he threw in the fire while the real one remained safe at home.
Moving his hands up, he undid the buttons one by one. Pushing open the two halves of his shirt, he dove in and lapped over a dark nipple. Sherlock threw his head back and released a guttural moan. As John sucked softly, his hands roamed all over his back, shoulders, neck, and sides. He rolled the little nub between his teeth and pushed Sherlock’s shirt off his shoulders before switching to the other one.
He opened the top flap and first took out a few of Sherlock’s shirts. The purple one he’d always liked (he was shocked Sherlock never noticed it was missing after his return), the sky blue one, and one of his many black shirts. He lifted one to his face. Sherlock’s scent lingered there, but only slightly. John didn’t bother keeping track of how many times he’d fallen asleep with his face buried in one of these shirts when he was living alone.
For several seconds they sat in the grass, the distant red police lights flashing around them as the officers sorted things out.
So much we wanted to get to peace. But we did. Dad's dream has come true. Today begins the Age of Earth. That is how this era will be called, in which vampires and humans will live together, as one race. Mom and Mycroft are part of the first government.
"We can go under that tree," the mother suggests, pointing to an oak that stands majestically and lonely, not far from us.
of family I considered valid for any purpose, without the owner can do nothing to stop me. According to our laws, still in use, I could take Dr. Watson away from you and turn him into my personal whore. I could give him to every vampire I want and I could let him using Dr. Watson whatever he wanted, even to convince him to stand up on my side. I do not have much time, Sherlock. Do what I have asked you or I will have to use methods that would repel me, but that I would not hesitate to use. You'll take time until this afternoon. If you do not accept, I will send Anthea to take Dr. Watson. Do not think you can leave London with him, without I will know it. You know I always control what's happening in your house."
"It was not foreseen that Mycroft would make his number on John! If my dear brother had kept his fangs away from John's neck, all this would not have happened!” Sherlock replied, just as angry.
"Mycroft is right. The only chance of salvation for humans and vampires is to find an agreement. I'll go to the meeting with Mary and I will accept anything, every insult to convince her that the resistance has to come to an agreement with the Vampires," I murmured, trying to show a security that I did not feel. I did not look up to look at Sherlock in his face. I heard him pick up his cellphone from the pants pocket and send a message. The answer did not wait long.
I burst into laughter without cheer: "Influence? What influence could I ever have on a woman I have not seen for nearly ten years? As far as I know, Mary might want to spit in my face and tell me she would have preferred me to be dead, rather than being your slave and bitch," I replied in a harsh tone.
I do not know how long Sherlock kept repeating these words, whispering them directly into my ear. Stroking my back, with slow and light movements. His touch was gentle and delicate, not intrusive or aggressive, enough to make me feel his reassuring presence.
Sherlock seems to be protesting, but Daddy still touches his hand, always turning to look at him.Sherlock snorts and crosses his arms over his chest, his face faced with a bronze worthy of a willful child.I can’t hide an amused smile.At that moment, my gaze is intersecting with that of my father.He smiles at me.He understood why I was laughing at his vampire.He raises his eyes to heaven, as if to explain to me that this is his habitual behavior.
The end is waiting for you next Thursday, always here. Possibly in the company of a good stock of handkerchiefs.
This series, really intense, ends here. It has been a long and painful tale that has cropped in over three months. Thanks to all of you who have followed it consistently, despite the presence of certain passages that are not very light. Thank you for comments, kudos, subscriptions and bookmarks.
"Mycroft is trying to get in touch with the leaders of human resistance, to try to reach an agreement with them and bring it to the Council, so that families can accept the release of humanity."
Sherlock made one of his rare radiant smiles, illuminating his face and eyes: "I'm always ready for everything. For science, of course."
When I got back, I was in the bed, which I shared with Sherlock. I had been wiped and dressed. I heard the voices, argue animally. They were not in the room, but I heard what they were saying.
I do not hear him coming.We have not seen him since the funeral.His voice is low and deep: "Miss Watson?"
Did I betray my wife? With my body, surely yes. I had made love with another being. It did not matter why I had done it. It took little care that I had never told him to love him. I had consciously accepted to make love with Sherlock, betraying the vows I made to my wife on the day we were married.
When I heard the front door closing, I got up from the table. Sherlock was right next to me. He pulled off the dressing gown and laid it on my shoulders, lifted me in his arms and took me to the bathroom. I had learned not to ask him questions and did not object to him when he was angry. At that moment, I could see an unusual fury glitter in his eyes. I had witnessed various altercation between him and his brother, but this time it seemed really different. I also seemed to be involved in the lite, but I did not understand the reason. Upon reaching the bathroom, Sherlock put me on the edge of the tub while putting the cap and opening the water. I took my eyes on him. Sherlock knew I wanted an explanation, but he was not ready to talk to me yet. I respected his silence, aware that only leaving his times I would have all the answers. When the tub was full, Sherlock slipped into the water and sat down, stretching a hand toward me. I slipped the dressing gown on the floor and reached it. The water was pleasantly warm. I sat down between Sherlock's legs, leaning my back to his chest. Sherlock clutched me in his arms, inhaling my smell, as if it were the only thing able to appease the anger that closed his throat. After a few minutes, he took a sponge and began to wash me. The torso, the arms. He was very delicate, but always closed in his stubborn silence. I knew he was sorry for what had happened: "He did not hurt me. He was efficient and quick," I tried to reassure him.
I saw that Sarah was determined not to let the subject fall, so I said, "Thank you for coming and taking care of me. I'm sure everything will be fine."
At that moment, I did not want to remember the laughs shared with him and the conspiratorial looks. The sweet caresses, unconsciously handed, as our bodies brushed, in front of the microscope or sitting on the couch. The beat of my heart accelerated when he approached me, staring at me with burning eyes, full of hunger, passion, and desire, making me feel as though I only existed in the world. As if I were all his universe.
It seemed tometo make a pity on my dad, hating his vampire.As far as this hurt me, I know my dad loved Sherlock, which was important to him.Sherrinford is right.If I really want to honor my father's memory, I must accept that the Holmes are a part of my family.Now, anyway, it's not hard for me to think of them this way.Over the years, I've been to Sherrinford for a long time.We found ourselves well together.We fell in love.And we got married.We have become one of the first couples legally recognized by the new laws on inter-races unions.Mom was not enthusiastic about my choice, especially as it seemed to her that another Holmes had taken away the only person who remained in the world.Now, the idea of becoming a grandmother makes her happy.Sherrinford and I are expecting our first baby.Yesterday we knew he is a male and decided to call him John Sherlock Holmes.In memory of great friendship and deep love.
"Mycroft managed to organize a meeting with some of the leaders of human resistance to discuss a non-aggression pact. It would be a first step to get to sit around a table and negotiate a peace agreement between our two races. To attend the meeting, Mary made the condition to talk to you before or she will  not come. From what my brother revealed to me, Mary Morstan's opinion is taken into consideration, within the resistance. If Mary agreed to sit at the negotiating table, the majority of human leaders would join her."
I was shriveled over myself, shaking my arms around my knees. I wanted to disappear. I wanted to dissolve in the air and vanish. For the first time, since I was separated from Mary and Rosie, I really wanted to be dead. I wanted to have had the courage to commit suicide or to have provoke Sherlock in such a way that he had killed me. My daily life had led me to accept the collar and the leash as annoying but necessary. They had become an emblem of my donor status. On some occasions, they had even saved me from the unattractive attentions of some vampire a bit too insistent and intrusive. If in the early days I had considered the collar and the leash as degrading symbols of my being a prisoner and a slave, they were now entering my daily life and I almost did not notice them when I wore them. The people, which I encountered on the street, did not matter about them. Anyone, who was part of a vampire's herd, had a collar and knew what it meant. No one judged me for what I was and I did. The other humans understood how much the donors were indispensable because of the precarious balance on which the Vampire Age was based. We nourished the dominators of society, allowing our people to continue living their lives, as if the vampires did not exist. For others, after all, it had not changed much. After stabilizing their power, the Vampires had given some freedom to the Humans, who had succeeded in subjugating.
This was the news that prompted me to resume writing my diary. But I think it's best to tell everything from the beginning. Perhaps, so, it will be easier to understand the decision I have taken.
I'm on the door, leaning against the jamb. I watch the dawn, which is illuminating the plumbean sky. Soldiers and vampires are making to prepare the pyre, on which we will burn the daddy's body. My dad will have a funeral worthy of an ancient hero. His ashes will be dispersed in the wind. We are contended him in life, no one will have his body in death.
Sherlock rose, moving away from me, turning back and shaking hands. I sigh, resigned. It was painful for him as much as it was for me to address that discourse, but we had to do it. Although we did not want to admit it, we both knew that our common life would not last long. I was not old, but I was no longer in strength, not for a young vampire and in full vigor, like Sherlock. Perhaps for an older one I would have been well. Vampires exchanged donors? Would I end up in the bed of a senior member of the Holmes’ family? Was this what Sherlock and Mycroft were talking about? Did the older brother want to assign me to another family member and find a young donor for his little brother? I felt bad. Almost I was about to vomit. If this was to be my destiny, I would have accepted it without objection. For the sake of Sherlock. Perhaps, seeing me calm and serene, he would have resigned and would accept the change, without fighting his brother. I put a hand in his fist, forcing him to sit back to my side.
Sherlock drifts over to Moran, grabbing him by the throat and lifting him from the ground, at least a meter, without making any effort.He gives a low, deaf, fierce, wild snarl.The soldiers fought among vampires and General Robinson, pulling arms and screaming at Sherlock to leave Moran.The beautiful vampire puts hierself between the Consul of Albion and the soldiers, while the other vampires have formed a semicircle in front of their boss and scream to the human soldiers to lower their arms.Mycroft Holmes cries to his brother to leave Moran, and orders him not to kill him.He begs him not to kill him.Robinson screams at his men not to shoot.Mom kneels beside Dad, who has fallen to the floor.She calls him desperate.Sherlock's face is deformed by fury, which has overwhelmed him.He really looks like a fiery beast, thirsty for blood.The two fronts face, ready to trigger a massacre.I can’t move.I'm paralyzed by the horror of what's happening.Peace has never seemed so distant, as at this moment.Suddenly, Sherlock's features relax.Fury and anger vanish, replaced by devastating pain.Sherlock launches Moran, as if he were a rag doll, and rushes to my dad.Later, Mom will tell me what Daddy called him.A whitish whisper, unbelievable, in that chaotic cacophony of voice.For anyone, except for Sherlock.
“You always hear about people striking deals with these things, right?” John knew how completely ridiculous he sounded, but he pushed on. “Maybe that's what Gina did.”
On most days, Sherlock woke up far earlier than him, bustling around the kitchen, creating a ruckus, and not making an ounce of an effort to keep the volume down for him. On some days, they woke up at the same time, usually in a jumbled mess of tangled limbs. Sherlock was a cuddler. Often times, his face would be tucked snugly into John’s neck with his arms wrapped possessively around him.  They’d open their eyes and gaze adoringly at each other, their faces flushed, their hair sticking up in all directions. Then they’d melt into a fit of sleepy giggles and kiss lazily until they had to get up.
“JOHN WATCH OUT.” Sherlock shoved him into the door to the master bedroom, covering him with his body as a massive light fixture fell onto the spot they were just standing.
John tried to look elsewhere, but Sherlock’s intense gaze on him was too drawing. Once they had locked eyes, neither could break away. He found himself leaning more and more into the gentle touch. Sherlock complied, pulling him further in at his waist.
“Sherlock . . .” he breathed in relief and alarm at the same time. He appeared relatively unharmed, just a little disheveled. But at the same time, one finger on the trigger of that gun could end his life at this very moment. His heart dropped in his stomach like a dead weight.
Heavy footsteps thudded urgently up the stairs, followed by the door crashing open. Sherlock turned to find John in the doorway – as expected – sweating and disheveled as if he’d sprinted here from his flat.
Sherlock passed them over without opening his eyes. They rode in comfortable silence, with the only sound being the occasional crispy crunch. John pretended not to notice when a large, bony hand slipped in every now and then to take a few.
Also, I have a question for ya'll. My creative writing professor was recently talking about things that ruin fiction, and he mentioned alternating perspectives as one of them. Because you get really deep into a character's pov and then you're suddenly pulled out of it. It got me thinking, and I'm curious what you guys think about the use of alternating pov in this fic? Just curious! You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
He knew they were pirates. He knew this was what they did. What did he think? That suddenly after he joined they would renounce pirating and they would blissfully sail the seas together as one happy family? Stupid.
Mary nodded in understanding. She’d seen for herself how Sherlock felt about John when he jumped into that bonfire without hesitation. It enraged her to no end.
Not ten minutes later though, John started to feel the cold bite of the October air through his thin t-shirt, and it was him who was bloody freezing to death instead. He rubbed up and down his arms, and tried to ignore the white puffs of breath appearing in front of his face.
“Sherlock. . . They’re bombers. He’s contacting bombers.” His stomach felt more and more hollow as he scrolled through the list of contacts, the full-blown explosives Evans was collecting. Near the bottom, he came across another attachment – a PDF labeled “Anarchy.”
John felt the rejection like a stab in his heart. He wanted to go back in time and smack himself. To shove his stupid words back down his throat. That one little slip, and their relationship was changed forever. That one little word, and he could never brush this off as the work of adrenaline.
“No, it’s…. I’ll do it myself.” He disappeared down the stairs leaving a confused Victor squinting after him.
There was a massive circular bar in the center island. All along the black-painted walls were circular booths decorated with plush, hot pink cushions where stylishly dressed men and women were sitting together and enjoying drinks. There of course was a dance floor, accompanied by light background music and the faintest hint of a strobe light. It was already occupied by groups of people who had possibly already had too much to drink. The dim, yellow, orange, and hot pink lighting hanging from the ceiling cast a warm, evening glow through the entire place.
Sherlock looked taken aback. “And why on earth would I be disappointed?” he asked, sounding almost angry at the ludicrous suggestion.
John stood on the floor for several moments as his brain caught up with what had happened. Whereas a moment ago he had hated Julia with every fiber of his being, his heart now went out to her. They were fighting the same battle, and he mentally wished her all the best. At least he didn’t have to worry about tracking her texts like he had with Irene Adler, he thought on a slightly more positive note. Finally shaking his head clear, he wormed his way off the floor and set out looking for Sherlock.
“SHERLOCK!” John bellowed at the top of his lungs as he bolted up in his bed.  The afterimage of Sherlock’s cracked, bloody head lingered in his vision.
Sherlock smiled tightly at him and looked down. Both were avoiding the obvious topic of John’s abrupt departure during the dance. But neither would bring it up.
"Will you just shut up and go with it, you big baby?" With another dramatic huff, Sherlock read the paper out loud in mock-excitement.
“So,” John finally said, leaning forward and resting his forearms on his knees. “What are we going to do about Moriarty?”
John’s hands clutched the edge of his chair so tightly it hardly felt like there was anything between the wood and his bone. He kept his eyes fixed firmly on his sandwich in front of him, which now seemed as unappetizing as the stringy hairs between Victor’s eyebrows.
“No,” Moriarty finally concluded after scrutinizing them carefully. “Leave them. They’re my… shall we say, tokens.” With a wave of his hand, he sent his men scattering around the ship.
She first laid eyes on John Watson six years later. When she had a sniper rifle aimed at him from over a ledge.
Sherlock now knew that they both wanted more than what they had. For years he had thought his feelings were unrequited, that he was doomed for a lifetime of silent longing. But now that he knew otherwise, all he had to do was tell John. And he had been planning to for several days. But the right opportunity had never arisen.
"Why do you care so much about finding Moriarty? I mean, what's the deal with this guy?" Sherlock looked at the ground and replied quietly, almost as a whisper.
“You’re just upset that I’m finally getting everything you wanted. Just because you failed doesn’t mean I’m going to. I won’t. And you get to see it all happen, front and center. Because I now know exactly where Moriarty is and we’re heading there right now. On we sail, boys!”
“Moriarty’s mission is to burn the heart out of Sherlock,” she said softly in reply. “And mine is to burn the heart out of you.”
John held him there at gunpoint seething with rage, his eyes never leaving his face. Finally, they heard police sirens wailing outside the club.
They usually slept in the same bed when they traveled together, purely out of convenience. It had started on one case when the only hotel room available had just one bed. It was cheaper and smarter to be in close quarters if something came up and they needed to reach each other. Plus, with John’s history of PTSD, it was easier to have someone with him at night when sleeping in an unfamiliar setting. It just worked for them.
“So,” he started, working up the nerve to ask. “That man…,” he trailed off after seeing the expression on Sherlock’s face. His eyes were wide and practically bulging out of their sockets with an unnerving, mischievous gleam. His closed mouth was stretched in the most unsettling, predatory smile he had ever seen. “What…?” he began to ask. Sherlock’s bulging eyes darted down to his bowl of soup and back up to his face, and his smile widened even further.
“What’s the matter Annie?” he asked in that fake, sticky-sweet voice he used when he was toying with someone. “Aren’t you happy to see me?” He looked down at her bulging stomach with a raised eyebrow. “Or should I say, both of you?”
He mouthed down to his belly. When John felt him smile slightly into his skin, he looked down again. Sherlock was hovering over the second bullet wound on his ribs. This one was too fresh for Sherlock to touch it directly, so instead he pecked tiny, gentle kisses on the sensitive skin around it. When finished, he beamed back up at John with the same radiant smile as before.
John wiped a single tear from the corner of his eye as he rested his head back down again. Never again would he doubt that Sherlock loved every bit of him unconditionally. Never.
He felt sort of bad for her. The poor girl at least deserved to know if the man returned her feelings or not. He watched with pity as she talked through her concerns with him, wringing her wrists and stumbling over her words, desperate to know if Greg felt the same for her or if she was delusional.
“Wonderful eye, John,” he said. “This would have been easy to miss if you didn’t know exactly which wall to shine your light on.” John tried to deny how much his heart swelled with pride upon receiving praise from Sherlock.
Right before he drifted off, he felt Sherlock’s warm lips press on his forehead and whisper into his skin.
He flipped through the channels, but nothing captured his interest. His restless sleep from last night began to catch up to him. His eyelids grew heavier as he began to nod off listening to the news reporter on the screen. Within ten minutes, he had drifted into a dreamless sleep . . .
“Very well,” he said. “I suppose I’ll just have to visit John again. He needs to be taken down a notch anyway.”
“Exactly. You're can't be sacrificed, and have no child yourself. You're in the bloodline that has denied him his end of a deal for two generations, but have nothing to offer him. He has no reason to not just kill you himself out of spite.” They ducked as sparks flew their way. “And probably doesn’t help that we’ve been on his trail all weekend.”
“This is not where I left it. I remember perfectly well setting this on the dining table to look at later.” John felt it would be a bad time to remind him that
Sherlock scowled down at him and spat, “Fine. Stay down here and rot.” And with a dramatic flip of his coat behind him, he was gone.
“No. I don’t want to hear anything you have to say. Don’t speak. And don’t move.” Ray nodded frantically and clamped his mouth shut.
He had never heard of a pirate lord aside from Sherlock in his life, let alone the name Jim Moriarty.  But if Sherlock Holmes thought he was some great leader withholding valuable information, John was sure as hell going play along.
Pulling back and pressing their foreheads together once more, his hand lowered and grazed over the bandaged bullet wound.
“I know. You only have to stay with her until we know it’s safe for you to leave. We just need to collect enough solid evidence to be damning.” John sighed heavily through his nose and looked away. “You’re strong, John. You’re stronger than anyone I know. You can do this just a bit longer.”
They were silent for a moment, looking down into their laps. John was hyper aware of how close they had scooted together during their conversation. Their thighs and knees bumped with every shift of their weight. It reminded him of all the late night post-case taxi rides they used to share, in their old lives. The darkness of the night in back of the car, their legs bumping and their tired bodies drifting to sleep next to each other – it had all felt so wonderfully intimate. John missed it immensely.
But he couldn’t talk about it now. Not just yet. He leaned in to try to capture Sherlock’s lips again, but he pulled back.
“No, it’s not that I don’t want it,” John said. “It actually sounds really nice. I just don’t see it happening with us.” The man nodded thoughtfully. “You know, I should probably find him,” John said. “He was somewhere around here . . .”
Sharks drifted ominously behind Mary in their tall, glass tank. Their shadows cast an eerie dark shade over the wavy, blue reflections of the water on the carpet.
“What do you want, Victor?” As invaluable as his second-in-command was to him, he did have an annoying habit of showing up at the worst times.
He grabbed his arm and pulled him towards his laptop. He had several ancestry documents and records of family history already pulled up.
went unspoken. John broke the eye contact. He couldn’t face it. Instead, he went to set his things upstairs.
“Welcome to the crew, mate.” Glancing over Greg’s shoulder, John glimpsed Victor staring daggers at him. He began to wonder if that’s how the news spread. It only happened last night, and John and Sherlock hadn’t told anyone, so how did the entire crew find out? If Victor knew, he would have told Jackson and Bolt. Greg, being his roommate, would have been sure to overhear something and would have in turn told Molly. It was the only thing that made sense. But how could Victor possibly know unless… No.
“Good. Well, let’s get some rest then. And in the morning we can try to find some evidence to back our claims. Gina and William are both long dead, so charges can’t be pressed. It would be impossible to track down the children's families nearly two generations later. We just need something tangible to show Josephine.” Sherlock stood and gave John’s shoulder a comforting squeeze before heading to his room.
As he had watched Sherlock in that surgery room (the first time,) and he felt those pangs of butterflies, and as Sherlock sat beside him now, relatively healthy, John could say there was definite attraction. John would even call him handsome; only to himself of course. For the most part, John had been in denial about the whole thing. There was the initial revelation, but John had put it down to the stress and possible trauma caused by the capture. Some need to be close to someone he knew in an alien place, or maybe the doctor side of him took hold of him, Sherlock was an ex-patient of his so it did make sense. And besides, John didn't think he was gay, was he gay? He still likes women anyway. Many women throughout this airport even were paying him a lot of attention for a blond head in China was a rare thing. It confirmed to him that he still liked the attention from women. Attention from Sherlock almost always ended in John blushing. Maybe that was a sign, of some sorts. Essentially John didn't know. He has been certain in the recent past, but in hindsight, as of that moment, waiting for the plane to take off to London, sitting next to his friend, flatmate and colleague he did not know. John was actually contented. For once, not knowing was comforting. All he knew was that Sherlock and he were still with one another, on their way home, to interview a murderer. Perfect.
Sherlock returns from his final surgery, and Sherlock makes a suggestion to John too painful to hear.
Sherlock began to become excitedly animated, which put smiles on both Molly and John’s faces. “Someone has broken into her home, they’ve bound and gagged her, and maybe they’ve told her something that was so destroying it stopped her heart. Or maybe it was the attacker itself that was the shock. Or the fear of impending pain or death was too much to bear. So could be an accidental death. Brilliant! John you’re brilliant!” With that Sherlock ripped off his gloves and began to practically sprint to the door, leaving John to once again rush after him, on the way out John too ripped off his unused gloves, threw them in a bin, and shouted a thanks to Molly.
John outstretched his left hand and dragged it hovering over the board, pondering his tactics. He went right across his pieces and then moved a pawn from H7 to H5 before sitting back in his seat.
The body of Eleanor Scott is wheeled out by Molly Hooper, and John and Sherlock attempt to find something to a very obscure cause of death.
"Sherlock you are scaring me, what is 'this'?" Sherlock squinted his brow as if the world around him was lopsided and no longer a place that was trying to understand him. "John, I am and have never been good at being someones friend, I see all of their flaws and secrets laid out in front of me as clearly as I can see them entering a room. Due to this, I constantly feel the need to fix and sort and compartmentalise everyone and everything about everyone." John leaned forward in his chair and rested his elbows on his tired knees, "Sherlock I don't understand, you've lost me."
“Cases, murders. That is what I need. Otherwise I go stir crazy. I need something to understand, fix. I’ve never met anyone whose been able to keep up with the logic it takes to locate and solve all the moving parts a murder case dictates and demands. The police, they need me. It works because they are all useless. If any of them were good at their jobs they wouldn’t call on me so often.”
Sherlock and John had a very uneventful sleep. John talked in his sleep several times, however much to Sherlock's disappointment most of it was indiscernible. There was something about a bed, definitely a bed, and given the circumstances of unusually sharing a bed, such sleep talk was understandable. John was grateful to hear that Sherlock was in the shower on awakening. He did not particularly fancy that awkward encounter. What if he had bad breath? Worse! What if he had morning wood?! Oh god that would have been awful. Thankfully the hiss of the shower was bliss to John's ears. And even more than that, Sherlock was singing. Sherlock was singing in the shower. Really loud singing in the shower. Sherlock shower sings. John was learning more and more and he began to laugh so hard into his pillow that the force of it nearly made him fall out of the bed. John stood and tiptoed to stand with his ear pressed against the bathroom door to hear what it was he was singing. He appeared to be singing 'let it be' by The Beatles, rather enthusiastically actually. John was surprised by the quality of his voice, he supposed it made sense, his voice was a deep baritone always, so why not also in song? John was about to join in with Sherlock, but he stopped himself. It was going to be a funny way of making fun of Sherlock, John would have caught him out. Just as Sherlock had with John the night before about him changing in private. But this, this was different, much more personal. John did not want to make Sherlock self conscious in such a way. John wanted Sherlock to be comfortable enough to do anything he pleased in front of him, social deterrents were the opposite of what John wanted for his fast becoming dear Holmes. So he backed down, stepped away from the door and slid back into bed where he pretended to sleep. Eight minutes later, Sherlock walked out of the bathroom, wearing nothing but a robe. His hair sodden and droplets dripping from his hair to soak the towel like fabric hanging loosely from his shoulders. He saw John exactly where he left him, the sight of John in such peace made him smile and hum content. It was a shame to wake him up really.
Sherlock was very weak at this stage, he needed some more professional medical attention and John was thinking of how to get it to him whilst scouting out for the right airline desk. He settled on British Airways, as they would definitely be able to associate with John’s sense of urgency. None of this lost in translation, time wasting bullshit. He wheeled Sherlock up to one of the front desks and said, rather out of breath, “hi, we need two tickets for the next flight to London please.” Once more John and Sherlock were left waiting for a woman to stop typing which seemed to go on for an age.
"I'm afraid, dear Watson, that you've quite opened the floodgates and so have no choice in the matter."
In reality Sherlock thought this game pretty tedious, but he really was bored and antsy so he agreed to John’s game.
Now the doctor and the detective walked side by side, about a meter away from the door Sherlock pulled John back to face him. He hesitated slightly for in his apparent boldness he realised that he hadn’t actually thought through what he was going to say. “John, I just, erm, I simply wanted to say that I am glad you, well I am pleased that you, or rather I am happy to be in your company.”
Sherlock is bored on his shared road trip with John. After Johns suggested car game goes to far, they have a conversation that's be coming for a long time.
“She is our landlady John, she has her flaws like all goldfish but she is a nice woman who understands my needs, and is never particularly bothered if the rent is paid late or not, I ensured her husband went to prison, something she was hugely grateful for,” Sherlock rolled off the knowledge at his normal demeanor.
Sherlock sat down in front of John and what sat before him were a glass of water and an assortment of fruit.
It was fast approaching one in the morning. The night was cold and both Sherlock and John wrapped their coats close around their goose bumped necks. They walked alone on the black streets that smelled always of the sea; all bar the decade old orange tinged streetlights. Some blinked menacingly, forever threatening to go out. They hummed and could be heard without being seen before one turned every corner. Once in view the moths that circled their potential paradise swatted around the lights in a manner that the planets orbited the sun. The single star, that has and continues to provide us with life and will ultimately take it from us. To the moths, this was their sun. Sherlock and John most definitely orbited each other. However, not in conventional polar order, they were more, elliptical. Working with one another they were at the closest point, it was rapid and electric. Without the work they weren’t in that place, not yet anyway, much slower, at least it was for now a continued orbit, always heading towards the next quick point. Gradually however, it was morphing from elliptical to polar. Closer and perfectly timed. In tune with the other, all signs read and acted on in the right way without threat of a mistake. But just like gravity, whilst liberating, it cannot be rushed or argued with. Yet, at the same time ‘because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing.’
John and Sherlock are flying to Shanghai for a case, and about half way through the long flight the two very bored companions decide upon a drinking game in an attempt to ease their boredom.
John and Sherlock find something crucial to a development in their case, and it's much bigger than either of them ever anticipated.
In one swift motion the tape was ripped from John’s face and he whimpered from the sting. The larger of the two men got very close to John’s face, eye to eye, and said in perfect English. “You are John Watson, and you are prying in something that is bigger than you and your albeit smart friend.” With the simple sentence, the two men walked out the room and shut the door with a bang. There were no windows in the room, the only thing John could call company was the CCTV camera that was placed over the door. It pointed paranoid, directly at John and on John noticing the camera it made him shrink into himself. He could do nothing other than weep. He was so clueless, he didn't even know what time of day it was and this country was supposed to bring clues and adventure, not this. The man was right, this was bigger than him. An ordeal such as this is something many couldn’t cope with. During the war, at the time when John was a soldier, this was what he feared the most. A scenario in which he was away from his comrades, alone, in the dark unknown with nothing but the doubt in mind and the fear in his body. Where was Sherlock?
John orders some lunch, Sherlock gets changed and considers friendship before a game of chess alongside which the discussion of war ensues. Could get heated even before their first mouthful of garlic bread.
If I had been lucky, my heart would stop working and I would never know what my wife and daughter thought of me.
"I do not need to say that John can’t feed you for a few days, is it Sherlock?" Sarah interrupted him, still at the doorstep of the room.
There is a small chapel near the clearing where the meeting took place.We made up the dad's body inside.General Robinson and Mycroft Holmes reached an agreement for the first meeting between Humans and vampires.It's a great achievement.I just wish Dad was here to attend the meetings as a representative of donors.I've seen his relationship with Sherlock.He would have been the best to plead their cause, to explain the relationship between the vampire and the human being, who nourishes him.
Mom and Sherlock are inside the chapel, but they are ignoredeach other.Even if they are accrued by the same pain, even if they are crying the same person, they are sitting away.They lost the man they loved.Still, they can’t comfort each other, because each of them feels the other as an intruder, someone who does not have the right to be alongside myfather's womb.They tolerate the presence of the other and they do not hunt, just in respect of my father's memory.
"It just seems to me that you have to claim what is yours, do not you think?" I whispered, in a succinct tone.
Sherlock and I are doing it, despite the beginning being anything but positive. Especially for me. Following the vampire laws, Sherlock treated me as if I had been an animal that would satisfy his cravings and his hunger. Now, that's not the case anymore. We have sexual intercourse, because the ampless is an integral part of the meal, for the vampires, however, I'm agreeable. I accepted to make love with the man who feeds on me and I did not regret it. I have to say that Sherlock can be a very fanciful and fulfilling lover. Together we have fun, not just having sex. Sherlock helps Scotland Yard in the most strange and complicated investigations. In addition, he is assumed by private desperate citizens, for various reasons. I'm his assistant. When it comes to interrogating humans, I always do it because they have less fear and confidence in me than in Sherlock. Also, I help him with his research and experiments. In short, we are a couple which works in a close and respectful way. We live an intense, fun, exciting, and fulfilling life. Unfortunately, when we leave the 221B of Baker Street, I still have to wear collar and leashe because Vampires have not changed the laws on the symbols of human submission to them. They can’t do it, until they come to a non-aggression agreement with members of human resistance. Humans will not make a deal until our rights are restored. A dog who bites his tail. None of the two parties want to give up at the negotiating table for the first time, not to look weak.
We never talked about my family. Mary and Rosie never existed for us. My life had started again the morning when Sherlock had captured me. And I was re-born the first night I had accepted to make love with him. All that had happened before had been canceled. As if it had never existed.
We were embraced for a long time, while the outside world began to celebrate by the end of the year.
I hope it does not look boring, but it seemed right to deepen the impact of Mary and Rosie's return to poor John, as well as explaining Mycroft's strange behavior in the previous chapter.
I do not know how much influence I can have on Mary. But I can promise that I will do anything in my power to see a society where Humans and Vampires live in peace, as do Sherlock and myself. Because I believe it. I know it's possible. It will take so much patience and much work. I know. And maybe in the new world, I can continue to attend Sherlock, even if I'm no longer his donor. I do not want to lose him. For me, Sherlock has become very important. I wish Mary and Rosie understood my relationship with him and accepted him, including him in our family. Probably I’m pretending too much, but why can not I dream? If we did not dream, we would never reach the goals we set for ourselves. Whithout dreams, we would not be human.
do not know. As far as I know, your wife might want to become widowed and kill you. If you are set apart, how can I protect you from her? Besides, I was sure the news of this meeting would upset you and I did not want you to suffer. Mycroft insisted, pointing out how important it is to find an agreement with human resistance. I replied that I did not care, that my only interest was your serenity. That he had not right to ask you to deal with your wife without knowing what she wanted from you. He had to find a way to force her to join his table without involving you. Unfortunately, because of our current laws, Knights have power of life and death on family donors. Obviously, if we came to sign an agreement with humans, we would be forced to change the laws on the treatment of Humanity in general and the donors in particular. What I did to you after capturing you, and the current rights of Knights on family donors, with new laws would be considered as crimes. We could not do it unless we went to very severe penalties. Mycroft wanted to remind me that
"Will you or will you not be continuing with your plans for catching Moriarty? Or is lover boy all you care about now?"
Sherlock’s eyes darted down once more to the finger-sized purple marks covering his throat, and the scabbed red line where the chain had cut him. His eyes softened for the briefest moment, but were stone cold again just as quickly. He scoffed and resumed his frantic pacing.
As their handshake came to a stop, neither let go. Sherlock’s smile grew. He thought maybe, just maybe, he might have to thank the host after all.
With the other gun still out of reach, John shoved Sherlock out of his arms as hard and far as he could.
"So how was your first day?" John chuckled. He could almost hear Sherlock regretting his choice of a conversation starter.
Greg and Molly’s wedding ceremony took place outside a church on a sunny afternoon. It was small and simple. Only family and their close circle of friends attended. As they kissed, the audience cheered, and John whistled with his fingers.
“Well it’s hardly safe for you to be here anymore. You’ve nearly died on more than one occasion and I’ll not have you getting hurt anymore. It’s best for us both if you return to where you’re safe.”
“Yeah, great,” John said. He sat on the bed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’ve got my own room, so we’ll have privacy when we talk.”
“John, enough,” she said calmly. Her eyes suddenly went dead cold once again. She was ready to kill.
“Sooo . . . since they’re happily back together now,” he didn’t miss the flash of anger in her eyes at his wording. “We need to try again. But this time I want him to suffer harder than he ever has. More than when he was away playing dead.”
John struggled against Jackson’s grip on his arms, but it was no use. On the ground, Sherlock put a hand to his nose, which was covered in blood along with the entire bottom half of his face.
He buried his face in his arms as his whole body trembled with shuddering sobs. Hot tears streaked down his face. They spilled onto the forearm he was biting into to muffle the sound. Though, he knew it was no use.  He was positive Sherlock could hear him downstairs.
?” Sherlock tore another chunk of wood off the wall and several connecting bones fell alongside it in a loose pile.
His face scrunched up and all the welled up tears spilled from his eyes. He released a single, gasping sob and slid down against the door, pulling his knees up into his chest.
He was vaguely aware of someone shouting his name in a panicked frenzy, though it was muffled and disoriented. There was some shuffling, someone yelling . . .
“Well maybe there are one or two things that I’m capable of that you aren’t.” He unlocked the cell door. “Out. Now. And I don’t want to hear another word unless I ask you to speak.”
“Ah. And so will he,” John added pointedly. He shot Sherlock a look saying he knew he hadn’t eaten since yesterday, and not to think he can get out of meals around him.
Right. She was gone. Because Sherlock shot her. “Thank you, Sherlock,” he finally said. They hadn’t had a chance to discuss it in the hospital.
"So, what is it that you're looking for on the ships you track?" Sherlock's eyes darted momentarily towards him before returning to the ocean.
John continued, barely keeping under control with heavy, angry breaths. His voice echoed low throughout the pool. “You called, and you cornered me into an eternal hell by not allowing me to go further with Sherlock. You said it was my punishment for leaving you. You forced me into a life of endless suffering by keeping me under your thumb this way. And you knew what it would do to us. You knew we couldn’t stay apart. You knew one of us would crack, giving you the perfect opportunity to come back into our lives and finally kill him.”
He smiled to himself and rolled over to examine Sherlock’s sleeping face. He never saw him like this; features completely relaxed, forehead free of creases, mouth gaping open. A tuft of dark, curly hair fell delicately on his forehead. His eyes darted back and forth behind his eyelids. He looked . . . peaceful.
“Ooh, you bastard,” Lestrade said, all too thrilled to see the man. But John remained motionless. Their gazes remained locked on each other as Sherlock cautiously approached him.
His eyes darted down to John’s throat. He reached out and touched his thumb to the spot where his skin had broken.
Similarly, Mrs. Hudson always shouted up a warming before coming up the stairs. She too had learned her lesson after walking in on them many times and in many various positions.
Sherlock made none of the usual attempt to make John laugh over dinner or even mildly entertain him. Nor did he reveal any more information on the case. They both knew John was there as a formality, even though he was just itching to be involved. He could see Sherlock’s scrutinizing gaze sweeping over the crowds of people, thinking through the case and how he would carry out his plan of action, whatever that might be.
“Now then,” Moriarty said loud enough to get all three of their attention. “Who, might I ask, is the captain of this sad excuse for a ship?” John, Molly, Greg, Jackson, and Bolt all readily looked at Victor.
Sherlock lunged forward and captured his lips again hungrily, pushing his head to fall back onto the top of the chair.  He moaned into his mouth and climbed fully onto his lap, kissing slowly along his jaw and all the way up to his ear.
He remembered the night they returned home after the bomb incident at the pool. Standing squished together in the doorway, neither wanting to enter first. Sherlock asked again if he was okay and they had looked at each other with an intensity he had never experienced before. He had looked at Sherlock’s lips and begun to lean in but Sherlock had moved.
John’s heart stopped as the ship jerked to one side, lifting Sherlock’s feet high off the ground before slamming him back down to the floor. Apparently not learning his lesson, he leaned over the edge again. This time a violent wind knocked into him while the ship lurched sharply in the same direction. Sherlock legs flew overboard, leaving him hanging off the edge by his arms.
The music came to an end, but the crowd cheered on for several moments as they caught their breath. The boy grinned warmly and stepped in so Sherlock could hear him over applause.
She watched him buttoning his shirt from the bed, smiling at him like a mom who knew who her kid’s crush was. He averted his eyes in annoyance. He’d very much like to tell her where she could stick her comments about Sherlock, as he could be in great danger right now, but he held his tongue.
After Sherlock set up his experiment with the feet at home, he spent the entire afternoon helping Molly, Sally, and Leah disassembling furniture and transporting them to Greg’s flat to reassemble. He made several trips in their rented van. At first, he wondered why they didn’t hire professional workers for this, but soon realized that it wasn’t so bad if you had enough hands helping. Greg even stopped by during his lunch break and helped for a bit. When Molly had first asked for his help, he thought he’d dread the entire day. But he ended up enjoying the time he spent with the three women.
And he knew the last piece of the puzzle to complete his happiness was to be with Sherlock in every aspect of the word. And now that possibility was within his reach, but he still couldn’t have it. That was the worst punishment Mary could have inflicted upon him. She really had burned his heart out.
There was one king sized four-poster bed against the center wall with blood red curtains draping on either side of it. Matching pillows of all sizes adorned the plush, beige comforter. The rest of the room was lavishly furnished with dark brownish-red furniture, beautifully engraved with intricate designs. The only lighting came from the dim candles and lanterns around the room.
Around them, everyone was at their assigned post. The two thugs were working the sails, Greg at the wheel, and Sherlock and the brown haired man conversing at the bow.
This time when they reached the deck, Sherlock was there to greet him with a large, though entirely fake, smile.
John swallowed and felt a sudden flash of heat burn up inside his shirt. He resisted pulling on his collar to fan it out. Did they seriously suspect that he was the thief?
He pulled back and moved down to his neck, kissing hard but lovingly, picking up where they had left off on the chair. He mouthed up the side of it and sucked slowly right under the corner of his jaw. John hissed and tilted his head further back. Sherlock grazed his teeth lightly over the spot, followed by a slow swipe of his tongue. After one last, tender kiss, he moved lower, giving his pulse point a similar treatment.
“Lestrade, he’s about to turn the corner of Main Street. We need back up,” Sherlock huffed into his phone.
John’s heart hammered at the reminder of how much he talked about his past life with Sherlock in the two years he was gone.
John and Molly’s heads both snapped towards Lestrade, who was now red in the face, sputtering like a deer in headlights.
He turned to look back at John and smiled weakly, heaps of love in his eyes. “I need you to be strong, John.”
No response. He peeked into her room and was startled at what he found. Her bed sheets were stripped. Her drawers were all opened and emptied. Her backpack and all her clothes were gone, and there were no signs that anyone had lived in this room for at least a few days. Sherlock backed out of the bedroom, took his phone out, and scrolled to Irene’s name in his contacts. His thumb hovered over the call button, but he put it away. Later, he decided. He didn’t know what was going on, but he didn’t want to possibly endanger her by calling.
It was such a weird middle ground to be caught in – he felt like a game of tug-of-war was being played inside him. Was he allowed to mourn the loss of their - friendship? It’s not like they had broken up. How could they break up if they had never been a couple? But of course, surely he was allowed to be upset. They hadn’t known each other very long, but what they had – it was special, whatever it was. They clicked so instantly and easily it was like the universe had always meant for them to come together. Their lives and minds merged together so seamlessly it was hard for John to believe there had been a time when he didn’t know Sherlock. They had become a team, a unit, within minutes of knowing each other. Surely John was allowed to be upset about the loss of such a relationship. He could be upset that Sherlock had essentially sent him away the moment things got a little coarse between them. He could be hurt that all this time, Sherlock had only seen him as a tool and himself as the puppet master, twisting and turning him in whichever way he needed. Surely, that would be painful to anyone.
All John could do was stare at him and wonder what happened to the man from last night. The small, terrified man who had admitted he saw what happened and climbed into bed with him. The man who ran his thumb along his bleeding throat and apologized with his eyes for not believing him before.
John smiled at the little quip. It seemed Sherlock knew him well enough to point out his unease before he had even noticed the pooling anxiety in his stomach himself.
He started at the end of the ship furthest away from Sherlock, whose eyes he could feel fixated on his back. He pointedly avoided eye contact with the pirate, knowing he had probably spent quite some time in his room waiting for him to show up. A few times he noticed Sherlock making his way towards him. At this, he deliberately mopped in the opposite direction, still refusing to even look at him.
It was possible that they were similar in the sense that they both got off on danger. Perhaps he had just needed an immediate outlet, and John happened to be a nearby, willing party.
John raised his eyebrows at him in question, silently begging for a response. A word, a look, anything.
He noticed how perfectly their hands fit together, too. It felt as though an enormous weight had been lifted off his chest and the icy boundary that had been between them since the wedding had melted away.
Back on deck, Sherlock stood staring out into the direction John had stormed off, his parting words still ringing in his ears. Victor rushed up to him and grabbed his arm. “Sherlock, we have an update. There may have been another miscalculation. This ship actually doesn’t have any information useful to us and has had no affiliation with Moriarty in any of its records.”
From this assessment he then looked down at the room as if he was a bat hanging by its claws from the ceiling. He decided on watching John for a while who at this stage was entirely focused on the job at hand. John was looking through a number of envelopes that were found piled up on the right armrest of one of the expensive sofas that was found in the large lounge multipurpose space.
Sherlock walked from his allocated room to John’s now welcoming office. He felt the cold floor press against the balls of his feet. It was almost liberating. He could see why John did it. On nearing the door Sherlock felt what seemed to be butterflies in the pit of his stomach. He was excited. Why was he excited? The questioning look on his face remained until he passed through the doorframe.
John gave a wide smile and his response made Sherlock finally look at him, “no, and thank goodness you’re not.”
"Car games?" asked Sherlock, inevitably inquisitive at such a suggestion. John gave a slight nod and a slow "yes." Sherlock uncrossed his arms and sat up straight, preparing himself for whatever challenge John suggested. "What do you recommend?" he asked whilst staring determined at the flying tarmac. "Well most car games involve memory, which seems hardly fair as you remember every fact under the sun, so I believe it may be a fairer cop if we play 'name that tune.'" Sherlock immediately rolled his eyes, this would be dull. He had expectations of earth shattering Hawkins maths equations to take a crack at. "John I would rather read your emails." John pulled his head back in dismay, "my emails?!" Sherlock raised a half smile, "the ones to your sister are particularly fascinating." John was upset once more, "but that is password protected?!" Huffing consumed Sherlocks whole being, "easy, you are proud of your military career, Kandahar71, took me three attempts." John scoffed, he was impressed but what a dick-head. "Sherlock just please, just, we'll play one round and if it is really that unbearable then we'll do something else, we have like another eight hours of this so please just." Sherlock saw John grind his teeth, he didn't want to upset his only friend in this life. He wasn't used to having to control his behaviour, "fine John, you go first." John gave a relieved nod of the head, "thank you, right let me think." After a twenty second interval John said a "got it" before bracing himself to hum.
Sherlock continued John’s voice full symphony and refused to let it neither end nor die out, “Brother Henry, potentially worked with the gang, I didn’t think, I know that the suit and tie boss loved Eleanor, he did not do it. Henry and Eleanor were more than likely lovers, suggests a dark and lonely past and something lacking in their collective present. Henry is married to a nurse, his family are young, two children, a stable job surrounding a law practice, he’s bringing in a Mark Warren to defend him, so he has friends, at work, and most likely outside of work. Keeping an incestuous relationship with a half sister, his children’s aunty is probably easier than most think, they could act close to one another without a worry of people making assumptions, Eleanor died of shock, maybe he threatened to call it off, maybe she loved him very much, she was clever, but still a gold fish. Love is a human error and maybe she made it. Maybe she tried to cut it off and he bound and raped her…” John’s face changed and it expressed a mixture of disgust and shock; it was an option he had never considered before. Sherlock continued, taking into account John’s expression, “it’s an option, we don’t know this man, he worked with the smugglers, clearly not someone too concerned about following what is right, especially in his own interest, in a moment of madness, or love, whatever the motives usually are in such scenarios, we have to consider it all John, no matter how grim it is.”
Whilst it was only three or four rows in front, John felt uneasy about not being able to see Sherlock. He was worried for his health, and arguably selfishly felt like he needed the company, needed Sherlock’s company more specifically. Sherlock was too focused on his survival to worry about seating arrangements. Once everyone was on board and the doors were closed John was still looking for some catch. Some one would jump out, yell surprise and shoot him in the head, or maybe the entire plane was in on it and they were just waiting for John to relax into his seat and give a contented sigh before all collectively trampling him to death. Even whilst the plane was taking off he couldn’t shake off the feeling that this wasn’t safety. It was only when the seatbelt lights went off that he began to truly believe that he wouldn’t die in China, and maybe, just maybe he would die at an old age in the comfort of his own bed. Just has he took a deep breath and undid his seatbelt did he hear a crunch and a loud gasp before someone shouted “is anyone a doctor?! This guy just collapsed!” He knew it was Sherlock.
Sherlock looked confused, almost as if Lestrade doing something intelligent was impossible. “Oh, I thought you had… finger cramp or something. Right were is the crime scene?”
In fact Sherlock thought that he might just give up on life entirely if John were to leave. How could he have become so dependent on someone so quickly? Loneliness doesn’t depend on how little people you are surrounded by, it depends on how you feel when with other people. It’s a state of mind, not how little people you know or judged by how much time you spend alone. Someone can spend their whole life with one other person and not feel lonely. Sherlock would feel lonely no matter who or how many people he was with. Maybe John was this one person that didn’t make him feel lonely.
“Easy, say everything on your mind. I do that anyway John. I have a new rule, every question asked we both have to answer.”
Sherlock nodded, soft and grateful at the offer, with that John went and set about one of his favourite routines- tea making. Gracefully darting from collecting mugs, to teabags, to a teaspoon, to milk; all whilst the kettle boiled obviously. As he poured he began to whistle, Amazing Grace for some unknown reason, just popped into his head from apparently no where. Lifting the kettle high and pleasantly watching the steaming water stream in a watergaw arch all the way to join the ever filling mug. The milk dispersed like that of an unfolding umbrella, and when stirred the cloud became one desirable brown colour. On returning to the living room with a smug face, John found Sherlock was not there to receive his tea. Maybe he'd gone to get dressed.
“It’s Doctor Watson, and yes, I think I will, because for fucking god knows how many days I have been pent up in that little room wondering if this man is dead.”
They faced the mirror, looking at each other and analysing themselves. "Name?" Sherlock asked, "Detective superintendent Joshua Williams, yours?" Sherlock whizzed the syllables off his tongue, "Detective Lewis Williams, aged thirty-seven, we met when I was twenty-eight and married only two years ago despite such a long relationship, our first date was at the Natural History Museum, you bought me a ridiculous hat and I threw a penny into the Thames on your behalf and made a wish that only you know of, our wedding was elaborate and took place in a tiny village not far from Lille, it was rocky in the beginning and we faced our trials and tribulations, especially considering the fact that you are bisexual, but we settled down and work together by happenstance, we met as police officers and have made are way up until we are almost in the same position, we adore France, we have been assigned this case because you have a masters degree in American social science and wrote of Karl Marx, and the relationship between American Governors and their relationship with money, I am on this case because I am an expert on boats, having sailed the world twice over alone, and a very good detective, that one is not a lie but it fits as we are in these positions we are able to do so."
The first night in rehab was famously the worst. Cold turkey wasn’t easy. Sherlock was shown to the best room in the whole premises and Mycroft had sent over Sherlock’s necessities. Sherlock stripped off his clothes and climbed under the sheets almost glad to a small amount of privacy. Within half an hour he was shaking violently and the nausea was excruciating. Ten minutes after that his sheets were absolutely soaking from the volume of sweat that was leaving his pores. His body was working extremely hard to force out the toxins from his body. From that point on every fifteen minutes through the night an array of Doctors, including John would open the door just to ensure that Sherlock hadn’t done anything desperate. At around 1am John entered the room and came to take Sherlock’s temperature. Sherlock had already vomited into an assigned bucket by his bed several times and the exhaustion on his face was obvious.
The ping noise went off and Sherlock ignored it and continued to play Bach whilst pacing around his bed. "Sherlock? Another email's come in..." was the only extent John went to, who sat on the sofa with a steaming mug of tea. Sherlock rolled his eyes and said, "check it if you want to but I'm sure it'll be just as easy and boring as the other fifty-two I've received in the past thirty-six hours." John stood up with a teeny audible moan, put his mug down, and went to the open laptop on the rickety desk. John nudged it by waving a middle finger across the touch pad. The screen shone to life and the email was entitled, "Body on a beach." John clicked on it and began to read. After reading the first paragraph alone, he smiled. 'Sherlock would like this' he thought. John stood upright once more, and said loud enough, "Sherlock, you'll like this one." Bach stopped his melody. John heard Sherlock shuffle through his door frame and waddle through to meet John's side. Sherlock held onto both sides of the sheet and leant down to read.
"Why yes in fact I do. Sounds like you lads have got yourself caught up in one, don't mean to pry clearly, you work for the police?" Before Sherlock had even drawn a breath John spat, "yes." Sherlock shot him a darting look, Sherlock loved to tell people he's invented a job and that it was entirely unique. John just shrugged and rolled his eyes. "awight awight" was Raj's response. Sherlock continued his train of thought, "did you hear much of what we spoke of?" Raj all of a sudden shifted in his seat and sat up straight, he swallowed before replying.
Sherlock huffed and folded his arms as if discontent, as John put the box on the table and sat he saw Sherlock go into himself all at once. His body language was all wrong and his eyes were once again gazed outside, but not, in actuality Sherlock wasn’t looking at anything at all. He was in his head. They were only discussing feet.
Lestrade held onto the letter between one pair of fingers, and used his now free hand to smooth his brow. “Sherlock you have known me for over a decade and you didn’t know my first name?”
Once laughter settled, the papers came back into mind and they turned their mutual attention to it once more, Sherlock pointed again to the aforementioned section, "it details a deal over Oil." John scrunched his face, still not there. "An Oil contract between the Bush government and Bahrain." John's eyes widened, this was big, bigger than he ever thought imaginable, John took a step back and crossed his arms, as if protecting himself from the paper itself. "Why would Delaney have these?" John said, Sherlock walked the short distance to the table and picked up the last piece of paper and walked close to John before handing it to him, John scanned it and it was a series of signatures, it seemed to be around thirty or more names. On even closer inspection things started to become clearer. There he was. Large and bold,
The landing was fast and so abhorrent in its rush that John had to hold one hand out in front of him to stop him from getting the same gash as Sherlock had upon his scalp. Most of the other passengers had to do the same. Then everything but not enough happened all at once. Four people were on the plane in maybe around 120 seconds of the plane stopping. They had a canvas stretcher, so old fashioned that the sight of it made John nervous. As they all collectively tried to lift Sherlock, John couldn’t help from barking, “watch his head!” or “it’s his lungs, he needs surgery immediately!” They all just nodded and continued with their jobs, as if they had seen this all a thousand times, the hysterical friend or family member telling them how to do their jobs. John couldn’t help himself. What if Sherlock died, what if Sherlock, this brilliant new friend died; died on foreign soil for a case that no one really cared about. No one apart from Sherlock, and even John was on the case for a selfish thrill, but now it had ended up with Sherlock hurt, possibly even dead, John was invested. He wanted all those fuckers who did this to him dead.
Sherlock poked John in the chest with his right forefinger to emphasise his words. The slight pressure of the finger-push made John almost fall backwards into the aisle. At this stage they were so drunk that they probably believed they were having a very serious conversation, when in reality they were just spouting utter shit. John took his next words as seriously as he could muster, he too put his drink down and licked his left forefinger before proceeding to smooth down both his eyebrows with the saliva atop his fingerprint. The action made Sherlock chuckle like a giddy schoolgirl.
His lazy stretch turned into a pounce. Just like that he was at Sherlock’s throat; he had run at Sherlock so hard that the force had taken both Sherlock and the armchair down. In a chokehold Sherlock gasped, “John please.”
Mary soon intervened with a worried set of hands and a “John come on now.” Very helpful Mary. Yet then John loosened his grip, and began to laugh. Properly laugh. Soon both he and Sherlock were lying side by side on their backs wailing with laughter. It seemed that they both were relieved. For different reasons. Sherlock was glad of the possibility that John didn’t want him dead and John was glad that Sherlock was definitely alive. He was still bloody angry with him. Basically pissed off. The cock. How could he ever think any of this was okay?
Sherlock wrote her name on the top left hand corner of the board in a very messy scrawl, but John could just make out the letters. In a flamboyant set of ‘T’s’ Sherlock then resumed his questioning, “Age and theory of death?”
He rubbed his free hand with his contorted brow. Both Mary and Sherlock could tell that he was fighting the tears. Mary placed her free hand onto John’s knee, which he took kindly.
“It’s pretty gross anyway Sherlock.” John glanced down at his watch. “Gosh look at the time! We really haven’t followed your program, not even closely. There are these sheets that I need you to do. You will obviously find it tedious but would you mind doing them? It’s for paperwork purposes; I’m to send them to your brother to prove that you are in fact getting better…”
“Why were we laughing so hard?” John asked. Just the question alone made both parties giggle. The two men landed in Shanghai, on leaving the plane they sheepishly passed the 'thanking' stewards, well at least John did, Sherlock couldn't give a fuck. John even apologised to the air-hostess who served them all those drinks. But Shanghai, a place neither of them had ever stepped foot! John was so excited he felt the butterflies in his stomach rise right through his torso and make his brain contort. A month ago he could never have envisioned himself doing anything like this. His life was so mundane, so futile, yet now he had purpose and a new friend. A really really good friend. Sherlock could not remember ever feeling this comfortable with someone. He realized he never had been this close to someone. On stepping off the plane he made the assessment that he wanted to be friends like this with John for as long as possible, maybe even until one of them dropped dead.
On pulling up to the hotel John’s jaw dropped. It was the nicest looking hotel he had ever seen in his life. It was called “Lotus” and resembled a palace that would befit any royal family. John could barely function until they got up to his room. Sherlock handled everything, he paid the driver, he checked them in, got their room keys, and led them to the lifts. All John could do was gape. He was even impressed by the elevator. Their rooms were on the top floor. They had two ensuites with an adjoining door, so it was more like an apartment really.
Lestrade gave his orders and Anderson gave a slightly less dramatic protest but he submitted quickly, this was actually his job after all, and they both exited through the door without a farewell and in the almost the exact huff stroll. John raised his eyebrows and said a kind "nice to meet you Greg,” before departing to follow the two malicious detectives, one the lesser professional, one the unfathomable genius.
Sherlock and John smiled at one another and Sherlock replied whilst still looking at his Doctor, "Scotland Yard." John's mouth turned into an 'o' shape of surprise. "I thought we were going home, you need rest anyway, it's been a very long flight and you are still in recovery, and Sherlock I am very tired." John's stature sagged as he spoke. Sherlock interjected but still talked calmly "John you go back to Baker Street if you wish but I need to see Lestrade, I need to know how far this case has gone and where they are in this investigation. They may even be bringing the brother in for questioning this evening, but if you've had enough..."
"And would not it bother you, feel like I'm having sex with the new donor? Would not you be jealous of being set apart and replaced with another one?" Sherlock asked irritably.
Sherlock is the one who speaks: "I will not do anything that can compromise peace.I promise you, John."
"No. Mycroft told me that Mary knows that you live with me, but she did not tell him anything else. Just want to see you ... and talk to you privately, without anyone listening to what you say. Me neither."
My heart missed a shot while Sherlock came out of the room, slamming the door, as if a hurricane had passed.
The vampire at his side emits a kind of grungy incomprehensible, as if he were reiterating an already-exposed concept, of which we know nothing.It is clear, though, that he disagrees with and disapproves of that meeting.This increases my hostility towards the monster, which has separated me from my father.How dare he oppose a family reunion that he has destroyed?What right does he think he have, to prevent my dad from talking to us?I clutched my fists to stop me from knocking him on, as he deserves.I do not want to give him an excuse to take Daddy away before Mom and I can explain him what we think we do to bring him back to us.Dad touches the fingers of the vampire.Sherlock Holmes, grabs his hand, twisting him tightly.Dad reverts the grip, reassuringly.They do not look in their faces.Their exchange is limited to the simple one grip.Yet, it is as if rivers of words have been exchanged.Their intimacy, their confidence, their complicity, come from that small and insignificant gesture.Mom and I have taken it for granted that Dad wants to be with us.Suddenly, I wonder if Daddy will accept to return to live with us or if he would prefer to stay with the vampire.
"I will not let anyone harm you. I will protect you from anyone. No one will hurt you. Breathe. You just have to breathe. I will think about all the rest. I promise you. It'll be all right," Sherlock was still whispering, in a comfortable and humble tone.
After months of exhausting negotiations, the non-aggression agreement was signed. It is the first important step towards an integrated society of humans and vampires. Now the really difficult part begins: to create a single society in which humans and vampires can live on equal terms. Who knows how much it will take, to make sure everyone agrees. We will think about it tomorrow. Today we celebrate the goal achieved. The party is held in the building Mycroft Holmes has built in the place where Dad died. In this same place, meetings will be held where the future will be sought. The main room is furnished with a single round table, around which are the chairs of the representatives of the various factions. In a corner, lit by the light coming from the windows, there is a niche where a statue is in place, still covered by a white cloth. Mycroft Holmes puts himself in front of the sculpture and clears the voice to attract the attention of the present: "Ladies and gentlemen. Today is a memorable day. We have reached an important milestone, but we are only at the beginning of a long journey. During this journey, we will experience difficult times where we will not see any way out. That is why I decided to put a statue in this place to remind us of what the goal we are going to achieve. I wanted to call it the 'Statue of Friendship' and I hope it will be a great source of inspiration during the months of hard work that await us." Mycroft Holmes pulls a piece of linen, discovering the statue of white marble. Two men, a vampire and a human, look into their eyes, smiling and shaking their hand, in greeting gesture. The audience applauds, with great smiles and assent. I am surprised and confused. I recognize the faces of the men who were carved in marble.
It is a few days that in the main talk shows they talk about a Mayan prophecy that the world would end on December 21, 2012. Usually, Sherlock and I listened to these debates, with my vampire demolishing every theory, systematically and calculated, using a contemptuous tone, towards any supporter of any theory.
I turn to the door of the chapel. Robinson was talking. There are some soldiers with him. I look at Mom. She shakes my hand even harder. I smile. I do not know how I can do it. Mum sighs: "You're right, darling. It’s time."
My body recognized that loud voice and adjusted itselfs to the words it felt. I began to breathe, restrain my breath and exhale, following the slow and regular pace that imposed on my lover's sweet and firm voice. Friend. Companion. Comfy.
"Anthea, dear, it is not the time to joke. I apologize for my assistant. She has a sense of humor a bit special, but she will not hurt anyone ... without my order."
"You can come and take him," I tell him.It's the first words I've ever spoken since we left the base.They explode in the silence, attracting Mom and Sherlock's attention.They have the same desperate look.That of someone who is not yet ready to let the loved one go.I feel the tears pinching my eyes.Pain, for the loss of Dad.Anger, because the monster who tookhim away from us for ten years, has no right to grievefor him.I lean back to tears.I can’t collapse.Mom only has me.If I collapsed, mom who could lean on?I approach her and shrug her shoulders with oneofmy arm: "We must let him go, Mom.This is just a body.Dad will stay in our hearts.Forever."
I watched Sherlock, who did not look away from his brother's eyes, almost challenged him to move on. Unlike me, Sherlock was severely opposed to his older brother, hoping to retire from his intentions. Of course, Mycroft did not give up on anything and never seemed weak and remissive. He was the Knight of the Holmes’ family and could not afford anyone to disobey his orders or to challenge his authority. And Sherlock was no exception. As far as I wanted to go back to the room and not be involved in their dispute, I could not disobey a direct order of the Holmes’ Knight. With much reluctance, I approached the two armchairs.
Neither Mom nor Sherlock move.TheeldestHolmes awaits, patient, that someone confirms that they can proceed.No one looks at him or talks to him.
"The vampire looks for another donor ..." I urged Sherlock, with a loud voice, that I could keep up.
The return of Mary and Rosie not only involved me, but Sherlock too. He had to know how much I loved them and how much I missed them. And he must be aware that I loved and missed them, even at that moment. Just because I did not see them for nearly ten years, it did not mean that I had deleted my feelings for them.
Behind him, two other figures appear.One is a tall, thin and dark hairedman, with an irritated expression on his face with beveled cheekbones, wrapped in a long black coat.Next to him, there is a lower, blond man, who clings to a beige jacket.He's nervous and he does not know who or what to look at.My heart accelerates the beats.I would like to meet him and throw my arms around his neck.I would feel his arms tighten to me, savoring his warmth and strength.Instead, I can’t move a single muscle.I remain starving at my father, as if he is a ghost, emerging from the mists of the past.
"John had collapsed due to loss of blood, you drunk his blood immediately after you and your brother you have,
"He just wanted me to understand that I could not say no. That he would get what he wanted. Mycroft would prefer us to present ourselves as a couple and to demonstrate what a human's life might be, if someone voluntarily agreed to feed a vampire. If we were to refuse, he would take you out by Anthea and bring you to the meeting, threatening you with any kind of retaliation, if you do not do what he wants."
I became paler. I was definitely astonished and very confused. During the nine years I had spent at Baker Street, Mycroft had fed on me once, when I was just coming. He had come other times but he had never shown any interest in me. Of no kind. I looked for silent support in Sherlock, but he kept watching his brother straight in the eyes, furious.
The next appointment with all the courageous people who want to know what will happen (and perhaps come to tears) is always on Thursday.
Sarah stared at me for a few seconds, uncertain about what to do. In the end, she sighed, “As you want, John. If you need something, do not hesitate to call me. At any time. I'll come right away," she smiled.
He does not add anything else. I fix him, confuse. I do not know how to react. What to say. Mycroft Holmes gets himself as if he's back from a far away place. He gives me a tired smile: "Excuse me, Miss Watson. I would like to stay with you, but I must take care of other guests, though some are really less charming than you are."
Dad leaves the hand of the vampire and takes a step toward my mother, who smiles at him, reassuringly.Moran put himself among them, determined not to move: "No one will go anywhere, until I have searched this man."
"That's what I told my brother, even though I did not use these terms, referring to you. You are no longer my slave or my bitch. We have built what should be the real relationship between a vampire and a human. None of them should overpower the other, but we should complete each other. Just like we do. Mycroft wants you to explain this to your wife. Vampires and humans can live together."
"Good. It's a good step forward," I replied wryly. I did not understand what this had to do with me.
"I've never had a fixed donor. You are my first ever. Usually, when consenting donors became old, vampires start looking for a substitute, someone who can meet their eating needs. It becomes very difficult if an intimate, sentimental relationship is established between the vampire and the donor. You've seen it happen in some of the cases we've been following together. Very often the human does not accept to be put aside and replaced. He becomes jealous and possessive. That is why it prefer to keep separate reports with the donor. Fall in love makes everything much more complicated."
When Sherrinford told me of Sherlock's death, part of me was happy.To know how much he had suffered, it seemed to satisfy my desire for revenge for everything Sherlock had done to my dad.On the other hand, another part was grieved, because I had lost the only person who could have tied me to years that I could not live with my dad.Besides, I could not forget the last words from my father's diary.He would have wanted us to become a family.That we were all together.The people he loved.Mom, I and Sherlock.
"It's not a request, Dr. Watson. It's an order. Do not let me repeat it. I do not want to make things more difficult than they already are for you. Don’t force me to punish you." The tone was kind and friendly, but firm. A tone that would not allow replies or bargaining. Sherlock did not say a word. I knew I could not disobey Mycroft. I did not know what a Knight of the family could do, but I did not even want to find out. Between the two bad thing, I chose the minor, hoping Mycroft was fast. I pulled off the dressing gown, removed my pajama pants and slippers, leaning all in a chair, and put myself in front of the elder Holmes, as he had ordered me.
I interrupted him, leaning my lips on his and shutting it open, so that our tongues could interweave and play, invading one another's mouth.
Among all these assumptions, I heard one which fascinated me. According to a young vampire whose name I do not remember, the world would not be destroyed literally. Simply, it would change society, how to interact with people. Even between Humans and Vampires. The young woman was immediately silent and opposed to propagating the ideas of those who want peace with human rebels.
Iturn around and I find him in front of me.He's paler and slimmer than I remember.Deep dark circles areunderhiseyesand cheeks are even more pronounced.It seems as if Dad's fire is still consuming him.I bend my head, "Mr. Holmes.Do you attend the meeting?They have just begun."
I stretched my legs, leaning my knees on the bottom of the bathtub, near Sherlock's sides, and I put myself on top of him, placing my hands on the edge behind his head.
"I hope you do not mind, if I used your father's face, for the statue. When the sculptor asked me what features he should give to the two friends, I could not think of them. I do not know anyone, which could represent friendship between our breeds better than my brother and his father."
Sherlock opened his eyes. The pupils were completely dilated due to excitement, and they covered the iris, hiding the light blue. I smiled at him, standing up on my knees and aligning with his erect cock. Sherlock, grabbed my hips and helped me penetrate myslf with his cock gently. I did not need preparation, thanks to Mycroft. When Sherlock was completely inside me, I stretched out to kiss him with sweetness. Sherlock rejoined with passion, embracing me as if he wanted to reaffirm his right to own my body and my soul. Slowly I moved, up and down. Sherlock took my cock with a hand, but I stopped him: "No!"
Now, however, Mary and Rosie had come back to the equation, suddenly and unexpectedly. And I could not avoid seeing myself through their eyes. Asking me what they would think about my condition. About me. I could not think of anything that was positive. I could see their eyes staring at me with contempt. Disgust. Piety. Compassion. Only their eyes. I could not retrieve their face or smile from the coffer where I had locked the memory about them. It was as if the last time I had thought about them last time had compromised my ability to recover the pieces of my memory.
The Consul has found his usual disposition, helpful and friendly.I look at him as he moves away from me. He smiles and talks, passing from one guest to the other.
"Dr. Watson is kind, make happy the colonel.We have nothing to hide.Anthea, of course, will look for Mrs. Watson.What is right for one, it is right that it also applies to the other," Mycroft Holmes intervenes, in an accommodating tone, which does not allow replies.
I felt the bang, but I did not realize what it was. Sherlock's arms wrapped me down, while his low, velvety voice cradled me, repeating the same words as if they were a reassuring lullaby, "Breathe, John. Inspires. Treat your breath. Breathe out. Breathe. Inspires. Treat your breath. Breathe out."
Over the years, Mary and Rosie had no longer been part of the equation of my life. After agreeing to become the lover of Sherlock Holmes, as well as his assistant and adventure companion, I had resigned myself to not have more news of my wife and daughter or to look for them. I had set the memory of them in the corner of my mind, closing it in a coffer from which I did not ever go out. The very rare occasions I dared to think of them, the pain of our separation had overwhelmed me, shaking my heart in a painful and ripping grip. To save my mind, I had carefully avoided any thought which would bring to them.
And Rosie? My little Rosie. What would she think of a father who never  looked for her, deciding to live with a being who raped, beaten and humiliated him?
My heart beat, crazy. It seemed to be trying to get out of my body, to escape as far as possible from me, to stop suffering. My lungs could not get oxygen, because the breath was so fast that the air stopped in the throat.
Sherrinford's words leave me breathless. Family. For the Holmes we are a single family. I would like to rebuke him that I can’t say the same. That his brother stolen me years of life, which I could share with my father. That Sherlock's happiness was based on my pain and suffering. That the love my dad had donated to his jailer had taken it away from me and my mother. I do not have time to say anything, because Sherrinford smiles me cordially and makes a slight nod with his head. He reaches Mycroft and puts himself to him side. I look at them, furious. Family. That vampire does not know what they are talking about.
"Sherlock.He was killed by a very rare illness, affecting some vampires.We do not talk about it.It makes us look weak and fragile.Sometimes the relationship between vampire and donor is so deep that it becomes almost symbiotic.When the donor dies, the vampire can no longer feed from another human being.He seems to betray the previous donor.The taste of blood does not satisfy him anymore.There is no way to force a vampireto feed.Those who suffer from this illness die slowly, starvation.It is a painful agony, both for those who let themselves die and for those who are assisting in the slow flight of a loved one, helpless."
It is strange the date chosen by Holmes and Robinson for the first meeting. I do not think they are two romantic men. Most likely, they did not think of the day of lovers, but only the first useful date to bring everyone around the negotiating table, in safety. I accompanied my mom, but I did not attend the meeting. I’m waiting in the atrium, along with bodyguards. Mom and I are surviving Dad's death. There are times when we deceive ourself that he still lives in London with his vampire, and we do not suffer, but we are waiting to meet with him. Others where the awareness of his death strikes us like a fist in the stomach, taking our breath away. Fortunately, we have one the other, or I do not know how to overcome these atrocious moments.
"I will not do or will ever say anything. To make the Albion’s Console angry you are enough," I grinned.
I did not know what to say. I was not even sure to be able to talk without my voice trembling. Yet, I had to tell Sherlock what happened. I had to explain why my collapse. As he had not already deduced it. From the scream I could not suppress. From the horror that had to distorte the expression of my face.
Today is December 31, 2011. It seems like fate is fun to make many important things happen in my life during the end of the year. I have not written in the diary since Christmas 2008. Three years have passed, during which I was a happy man, despite everything. Sherlock and I have built up, hardly, a peer relationship. At least in the house. The faction of vampires, which is working to make peace with humans, is finding a lot of resistance to completing their own project. With a bit of regret, I have to admit that humans are also sabotaging this deal, continuing to take action against Vampires, which put those who are struggling for human rights into trouble. No one more than me understands that the Vampires have made serious mistakes and enormous mischief for us, but if we can not leave our past behind us, we will never find an agreement or achieve peace. None of the two races can completely overpower the other. If we came to the open war, we would destroy each other. I would like to avoid this. I firmly believe that it is possible to live together, even though I know how difficult it is to find a balance with the Vampires.
A lament came to my ears. A scream of pain and despair. I wondered where it came from. Whoever was crying, he was suffering, deep and hopeless.
Dad smiles at him, "I'm a doctor, do you remember?I know what my conditions are," his voice is a whisper.He's struggling to talk.
Everything around me, my own memories, was centered on a single person, who had become the hub of my life and around whom I turned, like the Earth around the Sun.
We're just out of London, yet we are in the middle of nowhere.It will be the fault of the fog, which makes everything unreal.It's dawn.It's cold, but it's not snowing.Nervousness is palpable.Colonel Moran looks in the direction that vampires should come, as ifhe is expecting an attack.He was stubbornly opposed to the meeting.Moran would like us to release the atomic bombs in London and everywhere controlled by vampires, by deleting them from our world.He does not matter to the Humans, who would be killed by the explosions.Hedoes not matter to the devastating damages that would be caused to Earth's ecosystem.Moran calls them the necessary side effects.I wish he was not here.I do not like him.I do not trust him.Moran, however, is the chief of security.It was not possible to leave him to the base, because General Robinson camewith us to establish with Mycroft Holmes place and date of the first meeting between vampires and Humans.Mom is right next to me and her hands clutter, nervous.The soldiers behind me are thirsty and stiffen at every unknown sound that breaks the silence.
"Really delicious. - the Knight of the Holmes said - Tonight I have an important dinner. I have invited some Knights who could stand on my side in the Council, and vote the reform of the treatment of Humanity, without waiting for the rebels to make the first move towards peace. If I offered them to feed on John, I'm sure I'll take them on my side without having to strain too much."
fed by him. What has passed through your head? John is no longer so young and strong that he can satisfay the food needs of two adult vampires!" Sarah was screaming, furious.
In the last years, I learned to appreciate the security that Sherlock's arms infuse me. In those moments, it seems to me that all the problems of the world are solvable and that nobody can be injured me, physically or psychologically. Even today, I found my calm and strength to face the confrontation with Mary, tight in Sherlock's arms. I know it will not be easy, but I'm also aware that I will not be alone. I often wonder if it was right for Sherlock to give him so much importance in my life. As I have already written, we have never talked about the feelings that bind u sto each other. I know I even lie to myself, when I say I consider him a friend. At the same time, I feel I do not make him wrong. Sherlock is definitely my best friend. I can talk to him, with the confidence that he hears me and supports me, making me feel safe and secure. I never asked him what he feels to me, because it is useless and superfluous. Nothing will be eternal among us. I am a human, with a very limited life span, compared to Sherlock. Knowing his feelings for me would change this? No. None of us can do anything against my mortality. This has always been the main reason why we have never talked about what we feel about each other. Whatever we admire would not change the fact that I will soon die while he will continue to live.
I did not realize that Consul of Albion had reached me. I turn around and smile, "I can’t say you are wrong, Mr. Holmes. I am convinced that Mom will approve of your choice. Did they tell you that she could not come because of a bad influence?"
I took Sherlock's hands between mine. Perhaps it was time for us to speak frankly: "You know Sarah is right. That's why you're so angry. You know, soon, you'll have to find another donor."
Mycroft Holmes appears from the fog. We all know who he is, he does not need to show up. He walks with almost regal elegance, leaning on a black umbrella. He wears a complete black three-piece, more suited to a meeting at the palace, rather than in the middle of nowhere. He smiles relaxed, as if he had everything under his control.
"I will be fine. It was nothing serious. I should have eaten something. I no longer have the age to ... "
The soldiers take away Moran to secure him, but Robinson remains in there: "Colonel Moran did not receive orders to kill Dr. Watson nor informed me of his plans.This was not supposed to happen.You must believe me, Mr. Holmes.We are really seeking an agreement for peace."
I could not help but think that it was perfect as a soundtrack for this chapter, all about John and Sherlock.
"I'm not saying that tomorrow I will go. I do not even know how it works, this thing. What happens to donors, who can no longer perform their function?" I asked, curious.
Dad has always been this way.He never needed a lot of words to explain what he was thinking or trying to do.His face has always been very expressive.Every emotion and every thought was painted on his face, obvious, visible and comprehensible to all.
"And did not he have another way? The next time your brother want make a point, can I tell him to take it directly with you and leave me alone?" I was trying to joke, to relieve the pitiful atmosphere, dropped home after Mycroft's visit. Evidently, Sherlock had refused to do something his brother had asked for, and Mycroft had thought to punish him through me. It was a new tactic. They usually argued until they found a compromise, which disobeyed both of them, making both victorious and defeated. Although I was curious to know why Mycroft had changed the strategy, involving myself in their dispute, selfishly, I did not want that lite to ruin the celebrations organized by the end of the year. Not that we had prepared a big party. Simply, I did not want to start the year with any problems. Absurdly, it seemed to me that would be a bad year, if it began with a problem. I had never been superstitious, but since the Vampires had assumed power, I preferred that January 1 be a quiet day without any problems.
Dark shadows emerge slowly from the fog, drawing more and more out of what they are.The first, to be recognizable, is a woman.Tall.Her long, black and slightly wavyhair fall on her shoulders.She wears a simple black dress that emphasizes her perfect body.She moves safely and sinuous.She looks like a panther, ready to jump on her prey.She stops in the open space, in front of us, without saying a word.Her black eyes look at us as if she is radiographing us.Her gaze passes on each one of us, inscrutable, and stops at Moran.Hersmile is mischievous: "I'm sure you have an intriguing flavor.It would be interesting to taste you," she whispered in a melodious and sensual voice.
The next chapter will be the last of this story and series. You already know what to expect. You can not say that I did not notice that the happy end was not foreseen.
As Dad and I change the accomplice smile, Sebastian Moran begins to search for him. He raises his arms and loosens his jacket, palpating daddy's body roughly. Before anyone can figure out what's happening, the colonel pulls a dagger from the sleeve of the uniform and pushes it in my father's abdomen with a quick gesture: "Die, damned bastard! There will be no peace with the vampires. I will not let you become us all slaves of them and bring us to ruin!" Moran cries, furious.
As I write these pages, Sherlock is playing the violin. He is performing the "Capricci" by Niccolò Paganini, with a very firm touch. Maybe a little too. I am surprised that the arc does not break, under the pressure it is subjected to. Music has always been his vent and his way of collecting thoughts. I've always loved listening to him while he plays. I can almost follow the thread of his thoughts. What he does not tell me in words he tells me in the notes. I perceive his concern, his anger, his fear. Which are also mine. Only I can’t reveal what I feel, because I would make things even more complicated than they already are. I can only pray for tomorrow to be all right.
"You have no idea, John. Under his boring bureaucratic appearance, Mycroft can be very creative when he comes to revenge. Promise me you will never do or will ever say anything to cause my brother's wrath."
Mycroft Holmes was sitting in the armchair I use when Sherlock and I discuss cases or welcome clients. I could not see the older brother's face expression because he was giving me back, but Sherlock was clearly furious. The two Holmes brothers love and respect each other, but they have a very controversial relationship and it is not uncommon to argue. I wondered what might be the reason for the controversy, the last day of the year, but I did not come near, not wanting to intrude into their discussion. I was about to go back to the room waiting for Mycroft to leave, but unfortunately he noticed my arrival: "Dr. Watson, come here," he ordered, without even turning to me.
My dad smiles. Helooks with love to both people, who are beside him.His expression is serene when his chest stops rising.Mom mourns, desperate.Sherlock's scream has nothing human.I ... I do not know what I feel.I feel emptied of all emotion.Daddy smiled tome before Moran had stolen him.I will never know if he has recognized me.
It was useless to ask why. I did not want to know the answer. I did not want to admit how much Sherlock made me feel fine. In peace. How much he made me feel accepted, important, indispensable.
This morning, I did not stand up just woke up, because I wanted to sleep a little bit. Hunger, however, forced me to review my plans. I should eat or I would stay weak all day long. Against it, I stood up and put on the pajamas and the dressing gown. I left the bedroom, going to the living room. I was thinking of finding Sherlock immersed in his mind palace, in planning the activities of the next few days, but he was not alone.
He does not answer me right away.He looks at me, as if looking for something: "You have John's eyes."
"Strip you. Completely. Get on your knees in front of me, with your face on the table," Mycroft ordered, without moving his eyes from his younger brother. His face was a mask without expression.
The echo of the door slamming shut off for a few minutes and I had no reaction. Mary. My Mary had become one of the leaders of human resistance. I could hardly believe it. My Mary had always been a wrist woman, determined and strong. I knew Rosie would be safe with her. I tried to imagine Mary during the resistance encounters, trying to put in place the military, who wanted a frontal attack as she sought a confrontation with the Vampires, to reach an agreement that eventually brought peace between the two races. Or not? Perhaps Mary thought I was dead, killed by the vampires who had attacked our little village. Perhaps she sought revenge and urged that there be no pity on the enemy of humanity. And Rosie? My little Rosie ... was no little. She was twenty-one years old. She was a young woman. If I met her in the street, would I recognize her? Or would I pass by without I recognize in her my little girl? The little girl for which I read fairy tales and for which I controlled that there were no monsters under the bed and inside the closet. A shiver crossed my back. The joy of knowing that they were always safe was evaporated, leaving me an unpleasant feeling that closed my throat. Did they know about me and Sherlock? Did they know I not only fed a vampire, but did I have sex with him? Did they see my recent pictures? Did they see me as I walked for London, led to Sherlock's leash, as if I had been his faithful and obedient dog? What did they think of me? Were they ashamed of what I had become? Did they considere me a traitor, a whore, a man of no dignity and honor? Could I bear to see the contempt in their eyes? Or would it have been worse if they looked at me pityfully?
Mary reading John's texts was inspired by that scene where she reads his blog despite his requests that she doesn't. It said a lot to me about their domestic life.
John removed his graduation cap and tossed it above his head. Cheers filled the air as caps came raining down on him and his fellow graduates. His face lit up with joy, and pride filled his heart. Never in his life had he been so proud of himself. It hadn’t been easy to go back and finish medical school. He’d had to relearn a lot of material and retake a lot of exams. But god, it was worth it in the end. In fact, he should have done this so long ago.
John heard familiar footsteps climbing the stairs. With a pang he remembered how Sherlock had left him that morning. Not even bothering to ask him along on a case. Coddling him. Treating him like he was weak and in need of pampering. He pushed all thoughts of Mary aside and stood to face Sherlock entering through the opening door.
“I have to go.” John pulled the door open. Sherlock didn’t resist him this time. He rubbed his sleeve against his eyes and darted down the steps.
He screwed his eyes shut for a moment to gather his courage, and looked up at Sherlock. As he did, Sherlock reached out to tilt his chin up and leaned in.
Sherlock knew of his reputation. All the girls went crazy over him. Not that he could blame them, he thought, now that he was getting his first good view of him. With those muscled arms, that golden-blonde hair, those sparkling blue eyes. . . oh shit they were looking right at him.
“I fucked up, Sherlock. Really badly. I was stupid to not come to you in the first place. I just thought I was keeping you safe by doing what she wanted.” He swallowed tightly, leading into his next words with heavy emotion. “I overestimated my abilities to stay away from you, and it nearly destroyed us both. I could’ve gotten you killed and I don’t think I’ll ever live that down.”
“SHERLOCK!” John bellowed at the top of his lungs. But with the howling wind and ferocious waves, he could not even hear himself. Another aggressive wind smacked into Sherlock leaving him dangling above the water by one slipping hand.
The lights dimmed just slightly, and everyone on the floor slowed down. The mood shift was obvious; they were about to play a slow dance. The couples threw their arms loosely around each other, swaying gently in place.
He nudged John so he would scoot over and make room for him. After they both settled in, leaning back against the headboard, John retold his dream.
A few years later, she heard him say he needed someone to seduce John Watson. Sherlock Holmes was going to die, one way or another, and someone needed to watch his companion to make sure he was dead. If he somehow escaped his inevitable death, John would be the one to know.
Some of his anger must have still been lingering on his face because Julia then asked, “Are you alright?”
One hour later, a rough bump in the road jolted him awake. He didn’t even notice when he’d dozed off. But he did notice the weight of another head atop his own, and the slow rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest.
No matter how many times he was hit, John refused to stop struggling, stop breathing, stop trying to hit back, or shout for the help he knew wouldn’t come. At some point, he was thrown to the ground and beaten severely by all three of them. After a particularly hard kick to his gut, all the strength drained out of his body. He fell limp to the ground, and after another kick to his face, he blacked out.
From then on, John made sure to tell Sherlock he loved him more often, kiss him in public even when Sherlock pretended to be embarrassed by it. They came up with their own rituals and traditions to celebrate their love. Sherlock noticed the effort John made. He felt stupid for even doubting him in the first place. But the question of their commitment and loyalty to one another was never again an issue from that day forth.
Mrs. Hudson found all of this to be vastly entertaining.  “Happy birthday, dear. So sweet of John to do all of this-"
John cleared his throat. “Did I mean what?” Even to himself, his voice sounded cracked and unsteady in the still, quiet kitchen.
With one last particularly hard suckle on Sherlock’s mouth, John released him. Sherlock smiled breathlessly, his face still in John’s firm hands. “Let’s take you home, John.”
“So . . . you somehow locked yourself in a dark, scary room and then felt a draft?” John didn’t miss the amusement Sherlock was trying so hard to conceal in his voice.
God, he was still pissed at Sherlock for making a joke out it. He swore, on the days when he wasn’t fantasizing about tracing those damned cheekbones with his finger, he just wanted to fucking punch them in.
“And then you moved back in. And I thought maybe . . . now that it was all behind us, maybe we could . . .I thought that maybe there was something . . .” he swallowed the rest of his sentence.
Sherlock’s eyes almost seemed to glisten with tears, but the illusion quickly vanished when he blinked it away. A small smile tugged at his lips, which he resisted. But John didn’t care. He knew Sherlock had heard him. He smiled and put a hand over Sherlock’s. “Come on. Let’s go to a pub.”
John’s vision went hazy as he slumped down against the wall. Sherlock kneeled by him, allowing the man to dark around the other side of the building and escape.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he told himself not to do this. That he was approaching dangerous territory. A soft mental alarm wailed in warning, but he ignored it over the warm, fuzzy buzz that had taken over his brain and body. He felt so good right now. So right. He wasn’t that drunk, after all.
And now by some miracle, he was back, and John was in his arms squeezing around his torso. He would never take his presence in his life for granted again.
When John pulled back for air, Sherlock chased him for another all-encompassing kiss, and then they broke apart, equally gasping for breath. He pressed their foreheads pressed together. Eyes closed and hearts racing, they remained that way for several moments.
Kicking and struggling, he grasped at the chains, trying to uncross them when he felt the sharp metal break into his skin.
Sherlock’s hot, wet mouth engulfed him halfway down. He bobbed up and down a few times, going lower and lower each time, and sucking unbelievably hard.
They kissed like they had been doing it since the dawn of time. Like it was a choreographed dance, and they could predict each other’s every move. Like they were a single unit, moving in harmonized union.
He wanted to take it back instantly. To reach out and hold Sherlock’s hands and tell him just how taken he was with him that first night. How he’d have been willing to move into his bedroom right that very night if he’d just asked. But the words died in his mind before they could even reach his throat.
“Sherlock, I was with you by your side when you were homeless. Jobless. Using drugs. I wanted to be with you. So yes, of course I’ll be with you now. And in the future. As long as you’ll have me.”
“Yeah, well. There’s a fucking draft upstairs too,” he joked half-heartedly, earning a warm, groggy chuckle in response.
The air was muggy with an oncoming thunderstorm. They’d be lucky if they made it home before the rain started to pour.
He was mumbling all kinds of jumbled nonsense back in the alley, and said so many things he probably didn't mean to say. On top of that, it seemed like Sherlock had been on his own for a long time. His question was probably just his drugged-up way of asking if John really cared for him. Which, of course, the answer was yes. That much should be clear to him in the morning when he wakes up in his bed. Besides, what would it matter if John did supposedly love him? What would someone like Sherlock want to do with someone like him in the long run? Sherlock was so far out of his league it was almost unbelievable that they'd even struck up a partnership at all.
Their eyes locked again, but with this time it wasn’t in question. In those clear blue-green eyes, John saw his future ahead of him. He saw himself living a happy life and growing old and retiring somewhere quiet. All with Sherlock by his side. He looked in his eyes and saw the one love of his life.
They remained like that until Lestrade forced Sherlock to lift him up, and helped the two of them into a cab.
That evening, John sat in his claimed armchair by the fire while Sherlock paced in front of him, pulling at his hair.
“Victor, no. It’s not tracking him down that’s impossible. You can’t possibly hope to take him on and survive. He’s too dangerous.”
“No you fucking don’t,” he growled again. He wrapped his arms securely around his waist and pulled them both through just before the gate closed with a final bang.
Sherlock and his brother - Mycroft – seated themselves around a corner of a large, rectangular table. Steaming cups of coffee were placed in front of both of them. The room was only somewhat private; they were isolated enough from other people, though entirely visible through the glass walls.
He slowly dragged his fingertips down his bare back, making him shiver unconsciously. He drew circles at his sides and then trailed back up again.
His heart pounded in his chest as he struggled against the man’s arms. He watched Sherlock walk forward, head held high, and step onto the plank.
John and Sherlock were on their way to see Mycroft. He had sent out for all information available on Mary and wished to go over it with them, as well as look at the hard drive she had left John. Afterwards, he would advise them on how to proceed.
He walked up and down the area until he found a small opening through a side door leading into the same area. He knew he had no business there but curiosity got the better of him. Especially when he heard Sherlock's voice, easily distinguishable among the other muffled sounds.
Scanning over his appearance in the mirror, he half-heartedly vowed to behave himself this time. Although, deep in his aching heart, he knew he wouldn’t have to try as hard. Whatever chance he once had with Sherlock was already ruined beyond hope.
“Is there anything you can’t do?” John said jokingly. “Martial arts, the animals, the band . . . quite the list of skill sets.”
John chuckled at his partner’s deduction. They had been dating for five months now, and he still never failed to be impressed by him, even with the simplest displays of his genius. “Don’t even know why you’d want to wear that thing out anyway.”
Sherlock stared back at her with his mouth agape. Whatever she was about to ask, he knew he owed her one.
Molly led him to the front door of Sherlock’s room before smiling at him and leaving. As he raised his hand to knock, he heard a familiar baritone voice say, “Come in, John.”
They descended the stairs together, flashlights in hand. John allowed himself a private smile when Sherlock graciously entered first. Because no matter how much he teased and laughed, he truly did care that he was nervous about going back down there.
The spotlights slowed down. When the first one came to a full stop on Sherlock, he snapped his head up from his book in horror. Cheers broke out once again as Mike choked on his drink.
“Get started on that side,” he ordered. “These beams were taken out by someone and put back. Very poorly I might add. Obviously someone was trying to hide something here.”
“How are you doing by the way?” Sherlock asked softly, when at last he couldn’t stand the sight of him sitting there looking so small and hurt. So
Btw, my tumblr is @one-thousand-splendid-stars if you want to say hi :) As always, I hope you're enjoying, and comments are kudos are appreciated!
A full body shudder ran through John as thunder lightly cracked in the distance. Sherlock pulled him snug against his body and wrapped his coat around both of them. The tips of their noses touched as he watched rain sliding down the other man’s lips.
Their lips broke apart, the sound of the releasing suction deafening against the silence between them.
Sherlock, with his head now resting on John’s chest, and John brushing through his curls. Sherlock lazily stroking John’s side with his fingertips, and John nestled into the top of his head. Both their bodies sticky with sweat and come, both with content grins plastered onto their faces.
“That man over there? Cheated on his wife last night. She walked in to find him and his girlfriend together and proceeded to kick him out. He had to get ready for tonight in a two-star hotel. He even hit on the room service ladies and got one of their numbers. Also got slapped by a hotel waitress. ”
Then, in an instant, they drew together like magnets, pressed against each other in a desperate, earnest kiss. John brought his hands up and tugged at Sherlock’s curls, deepening the kiss, needing more reassurance that he was really there, alive and breathing- needing to feel him, to taste him, to breathe him in.
“Oh, please,” she said. “I’d have to be blind to not notice how many times you looked over at him.” At the panic in his eyes, she switched tones to reassure him. “Oh, don’t worry. Takes one green-eyed monster to know another.”
“I missed you too, John. More than you can know.” John’s smile stretched, and a small grin tugged at the corner of Sherlock’s lip in return. He let out an affectionate chuckle and reached for his napkin.
“No, he doesn’t. So that’s what the first party is for. The selection. In the second, he gets them alone and kills them. Always perfectly staged. Always meant to look like a total accident. Or like someone else did it. Or sometimes it’s not even documented for weeks. The third party is for rewarding those who were worthy enough to stay another year. But of course, none of them know that.”
John thought. He turned Stacey back around to face him, gripped her hips, and pulled her in tightly. He graciously returned her eager smile, and then looked back to Sherlock.
Sherlock’s face finally relaxed, and he let out a soft, breathy laugh. One last tear trickled down his face and onto John’s thumb. John took Sherlock’s hand away from his mouth and kissed each fingertip in tender admiration.
He could practically see the calculations flying around his head as he tried to figure out how it had moved on its own.
He never should have let Mary play him like this. He never should have lost control of his life.  He never should have led Sherlock on when he knew there was nowhere they could go without putting themselves in danger. But most of all, he never should have let himself fall in love in the first place.
The boy cocked an eyebrow in question at Sherlock. When he didn’t respond, he simply shot him an ever so charming smile. Sherlock’s knees nearly buckled. Now he
Sherlock might be able to brush this under the rug and pretend it never happened. Heck, the man had probably already deleted it, now that he had no immediate need for sexual stimulation.
They broke apart simultaneously gasping for breath, thick raindrops racing down their faces. A moment later, they tilted their heads the opposite direction and suctioned their lips together once more. They breathed each other in. Their wet lips slid against each other marvelously as the kiss grew deeper and deeper, rougher and more desperate. When they finally broke for breath again, John smiled up at Sherlock and ran his finger along the purple satin scarf, wet and clinging to his pale neck.
John and Sherlock are in to interview the suspect at hand, brother and lover of the deceased Eleanor Scott. Did he do it? Find out in the 'final' (maybe not) chapter of this super long fic.
John, his John, the man all this was for, lay before him with a sad face and pained legs stretched beneath his cold form. His eyes were closed yet the disappointment could be seen plainly, for his face pointed towards the wall. Away from a living Sherlock, away from all of this. Sherlock thought that maybe unconsciousness would be better than this. He had regressed and now his miscalculations had seen him pay the price. He didn’t even notice when Mary’s fists connected with his rib cage. Nor did he notice when Mary was ripped away from him, or when the police were called and arrived.
“I just like playing chess with you John. I’ve only ever played with my brother, and he is a bad sport. You on the other hand have expressed you want a fair game regardless of who your opponent is. You must have been an honorable soldier.”
John extended his hands from one another, "what?! Are you telling me they don't actually do that?" Sherlock shook his head before considering this response "only the idiotic ones do." John nodded and ducked out his lips, "fair enough."
“Amazing” said John before chuckling. Sherlock smiled at his Doctor before turning to Anderson with a stern look, “Anderson is there a printer with a photocopier in here?” Anderson practically jumped out of his skin.
John and Sherlock awoke almost four hours later when it was announced that they would be landing soon. They both shot awake a tad startled by the loudness of the words that came out the speakers. “Good evening passengers, I hope you’ve had a pleasant flight, we will be arriving in Shanghai in just under twenty minutes.” John rubbed his eyes and Sherlock stretched out like a cat, both yawned simultaneously. "You alright Sherlock?" John asked in a rather croaky voice, Sherlock just hummed back.
"He's coming in tomorrow morning, he wasn't happy about it, and a lawyer is coming in with him.." Sherlock began pacing and shouted "Oh God! What did you tell him?! He can't know anything we know, he can't know we are thinking he is a suspect, why would he believe he needed a lawyer unless we think him a suspect... unless..." Sherlock stopped in his tracks and John completed the thought out loud "unless he's guilty. He's a lawyer himself surely you'd think you could just rely upon your own knowledge." Sherlock looked at John, "he may be a terrible lawyer though, but I prefer the guilty hypothesis."
John wanted to jump over the counter and do it all himself. “Is it just carry on luggage you have with you today?” John replied with a fervent nod. She typed for another ninety seconds before declaring, “the next flight leaves in an hour, you’ll have to hurry, but we have two seats available, direct, the seats are not together, but they are only several rows apart, I see one of you is, erm potentially needing some form of erm, assistance, so it is necessity you sit with one another? If yes then we'll need to find another flight.” John could have jumped in the air, a fucking flight, a way out, but he kept it together and replied as calm as you like, “I am this mans friend and doctor and I can inform you that he is fit to travel without me being right by his side.” John let out a nervous laugh and Sherlock faked a smile and the woman nodded. It seemed they’d convinced her. “Passports please gentlemen.”
Sherlock unfolded his arms and looked Lestrade close in the face to the point that the D.I could feel the breath on his face, “reasons.” With that Sherlock was out the door. John and Lestrade looked at one another and then simultaneously realised where Sherlock was heading. In a panic they lurched from their positions, John bag in hand and Lestrade close behind, and leapt at Sherlock, just in time to both grab him before he entered the interview room. In a semi-whisper, semi-shout, John said “Sherlock! You can’t just stroll in?! We need, we need a…” Sherlock replied cool as ever, “plan? Oh please John you know that is not what I do, besides we are more than prepared, why wait for the show to begin?” With that he released himself from John’s grip and opened the door using Lestrade’s key card. It seems he had pick pocketed the Detective Inspector whilst John was drilling off the necessity points. Lestrade reached for his pockets, utterly dumbfounded, John shrugged and immediately followed the spontaneous interviewer through the door, which closed immediately behind him. Lestrade remained watching unable to now open any door as he had been locked out of everything. He wasn’t even able to watch through the mirror-window. He had been left out in the dark. John and Sherlock were left with a potential murderer and his secretly gay lawyer, and it was 100% his fault, ‘if only Sherlock wasn’t such an arse’ he thought. With that he practically sprinted along the corridor, let himself out through the bland deceitful door and ran to his office. He had never been so happy to see Anderson in his whole life. “Anderson I need your key card!” The urgency had knocked Anderson off his feet, his face scrunched up and the speed was unbearable. “
Sherlock gave a curt nod, almost embarrassed by the realization that he was still in his dressing gown, he tightened its cord wrapped round his waist. John noticed, of course he did, he notices everything (much to the impressed surprise of Sherlock- another person who notices everything, finally!!)
On hearing her name Lestrade immediately exclaimed ‘How do you know her name?! That’s our most secret case Sherlock!” Lestrade acted once more as if Sherlock had never been away. Always trusting Sherlock’s words it seemed.
Before they knew it, they were outside of Scotland yard. "That'll be furty' squid mate." Sherlock handed over cash before John could make a fuss about expenses. Raj handed them their change whilst using the rhyming cockney slang, "yer' lady and yer' shrapnel lads." They thanked him and whilst exiting the taxi Raj said kindly, "hope you catch em' lads." They thanked him, John arguably a bit too over the top, but it was definitely appreciated. They walked over the concrete, suit cases wheeling behind their heels. Then they were through the famous spinning doors and were understandably forced to leave their luggage by the doors and searched at security. On a successful entrance they walked to where they knew where Lestrade would be. There were some stares as they walked around the large building,
Once parked up, they headed to the deck floor, John purchased two cups of average yet welcomed teas. Once the boiled liquids were paid for, John left the line to turn around and find that Sherlock had indeed fucked off. Typical. John bit his lip and flecked his eyes, he had to remain calm, it had been an incredibly long roller coaster of a day, and they were so near the end. Where would Sherlock go? John walked determined, hovering the steaming throw away cups as he went. Thankfully, it became clear that Sherlock had not strayed far, not that he could really, it was a pretty small boat. He was outside, arms resting across the banisters, staring back at the land they had just departed. The darkening evening was becoming storm tied and when John handed over the tea allocated for his companion, he used the free hand to pull his jacket collar closer to his exposed neck. "Cold?" was all Sherlock asked, "you know you are not very good at small talk right?" Sherlock smiled and watched the waves turn from unending blue to a curled shocking white foam.
The car stopped and this time Sherlock paid. They walked onto the pavement and John couldn’t bring himself to look upon Sherlock’s face any longer.
Lestrade looked up in surprise, hearing a new voice in such a familiar environment was strange. “All of it Doctor Watson.”
He towelled his hair dry, careful not to dampen his suit, and left it to its own doing as per usual, and on sitting to tie his shoe laces, John exited the bathroom wearing the duplicate of the same robe Sherlock had worn moments before, except John's went down to his ankles, whereas for Sherlock it draped around his mid-shin bone. Likewise the sleeves essentially touched the base of his thumbs, whereas for Sherlock, they hung tightly around mid-forearm. The pair connected eyes for the first time today, and John cleared his throat before awkwardly uttering, "you, look, erm professional." Sherlock leant down to his toes and tied his left show laces without losing eye contact with his doctor, "you look like you could use some clothes." John laughed and agreed whilst remaining under the door frame. John then unzipped his bag and produced a bland grey t-shirt and his favourite sandy coloured woollen jumper, followed by some practical jeans. On re-entering the bathroom as he had the night before, he realised he had forgotten his underwear. After considering to wear the pair he'd slept in he decided against it and just went full blown commando instead. He secretly liked doing this and would always do it if he required a bit more confidence that day. A little inconsequential secret such as the fact that he's wearing no underwear for some reason made him more comfortable with himself, thus making him feel more able to face any problem. Maybe it was suitable for today after all.
Sherlock and John gain access to the docks to help with their case. They are looking for a huge mofo of a boat, and on finding it some things happen that cause both hysterical laughter and terror...
John at this point had two options, either use his available castle in H8 or use his Queen who was admittedly a gamble.
Now John looked even more confused. “No I’m sorry, I’m calling bullshit on that Sherlock. You spend you’re whole life ensuring people DON’T WIN. You are the good guy on that, meaning that YOU are the better man.” Sherlock gave a brief sigh.
Meanwhile, Sherlock’s face transitioned from shock to confused to calm and collected in a heart beat. Ten minutes ago she was trying to kill him why would she want to help. Sherlock did a quick series of deductions and besides a ‘secret tattoo’ and ‘liar’ he didn’t find much else. Liar. Liar. Lying about what? Maybe she wanted Lestrade to leave so she could try and kill him again. So be it, if that is the way he goes, he deserved to die in such a way. To be murdered by his best friends future wife in her own home, right well. At this Sherlock took a seat and didn’t bother to wave as Lestrade shuffled his way out as if a snail had found a shell that wasn’t quite big enough. So be it. Sherlock placed his hands in a connected steeple position under his chin. Although they were not there for long for as soon as the door shut John began to stir.
sign directly above it. John thought it was fun, it was great that such a thing gave purpose to an entire generation. Paddington was just as historical due to that famous lost bear from Peru. However it was scattered, the boards where old and small and all over the place. So John had a favourite, however the thought of a case with Sherlock over rode his inhibitions. He didn't voice any of this to Sherlock, he'd probably call it trivial or something and mention his 'A to B' thought track.
He took a deep breath and began “On the roof I realised that there were only a number of options, either I…”
“Brother mine, I’m sending you to rehab.” Sherlock scoffed. A most expected response, but Mycroft was in a state of genuine concern, a joke was the last thing this could possibly be. One must look after ones own.
"Sherlock!" There he was, John, seeming unharmed. Sherlock felt his gut untwist. Thank fuck he thought. "Hands up!" A gun appeared in Sherlock's peripheral vision. He did as they asked and walked calmly to John's side. "Very rude of you, I'm hear to retrieve my phone." It was flung at his feet, the screen smashed against the stone work. "Well this has been a waste of my time hasn't it." Sherlock loved this part. The talking to get them to give him some time to figure it out. There were two of them alright, both smartly dressed, but not overly so. One was blonde, died by the looks of it. He had manicured nails and was holding the gun with absolutely no confidence. His face was smooth, clean, and his eyes showed fear. He bared remarkable similarity to Paul Delaney. "What was the last thing you said to your father?" The gun shook more. "Shut up!" He barked with a bespoke American twang. "Sherlock" was uttered by John. He did not want them both shot. This could not be the end. The second assailant seemed stronger, less stressed. Less emotional. He was darker, tanned, his eyes spoke vengeance. Sherlock spoke to him directly, "you are the one that stabbed him aren't you? Your toy boy here couldn't hack it." His face became smug, confirming his guilt. "So what homophobic vengeance? It is so cliche. You wanted Daddy's money? You were cast out weren't you. Daddy never intended on paying into your college fund. Uh, I was hoping for something much more interesting." Sherlock looked at John, smug himself that he had figured it out. John grabbed Sherlock's wrist. It conveyed desperation. John wanted Sherlock to stop.
Sherlock nodded and a tear finally did what it had no choice but to do; it flowed from his eye, frequenting the detectives cheek and lips before falling to dissipate on not his palm, but the back of John’s hand. They both looked at the water change from its significance to not being there at all before they allowed their hands to separate.
I actually really like this chapter. I cannot wait to write the conclusion guys. Who knows where these two will go next.
“We haven’t even be on a case yet John and you already see me as a hero. You have so much to learn John. Someone once told me John that I am on the side of the angels. But I am no angel John, and I can tell you that you are the better man out of the two. On the simplest level to begin with, you are ex-military turned altruistic doctor. You have fought for your country and yet on return you refuse to lie down, despite an injury may I add, you endeavor to help those who made bad choices, non-judgmental and beneficial. Yet I am a high-functioning sociopath who solves crimes not out of generosity, but out of a sheer selfish need. You are the doctor, I am the addict. Thus making you naturally the better man.” Sherlock sat back in his chair and for the first time in their meeting, John was speechless.
is my phone?" Sherlock said the words before he even made it into the hotel room, and he was upset on finding that John was not there. "John?" Sherlock spun in a circle and buzzed into the bathroom and back. He threw his arms in the air, exacerbated and headed down to the lobby, hoping to find his friend there. "Bonjour, avez-vous vu mon court ami à la stature de l'armée et le visage grincheux?" The chap behind the counter was momentarily taken aback with such a description, yet a wave of realisation washed across his face. "oui, il est entré dans un taxi ce matin." Sherlock responded baffled, "il est parti?" Fervent nod accompanied words, "Oui, il avait l'air inquiet." Sherlock walked away with concern rising in his belly, his head was racing with the multitude of possibilities. Why would he leave? Did he say something the night before? Shit, did John finally leave, had he had enough of the case? Enough of him? Despite all of his words and promises, of course he would leave. Sherlock placed his hands in his pockets and kicked his feet, swinging one after the other. Then his pockets felt empty. "The phone" he breathed to himself.
Within a minute Sherlock was sauntering over with two of the most ridiculous drinks John had ever seen. They were a milky brown like hot chocolate, and like
John sat attached to that chair for what felt like days. It more than likely was for all he knew. He was given water and food by the same man who would impatiently feed him with a spoon, in what was most likely twice a day by John’s calculations. After a few days of nothingness and numbness, a metal camp style bed was wheeled into the room and John was detached from the chair and instead attached to the bed. The mere two steps in between the chair and the bed had John wincing. He hadn’t stood for days. His backside hurt from the constant contact with the chair and his arms refused to move from the position they had been locked in for however long it had been. His entire body appeared to crack and he even treated himself to cracking his neck when he sat down on his new form of prison. The chair was wheeled out and once more he was alone besides the camera that’s light blinked constantly red, watching him deteriorate away, chip piece by piece.
John just watched him through out all of this. Lips slightly parted and eyes with almost a film layer on the iris, John couldn’t take his eyes off the detective. Maybe he’d gone into shock. Maybe it had finally hit John at what he was doing. They barely new anything about each other. Sure they had recounted events, things that had happened to them, and even if they were personal whomever you tell the story to, they are completely and utterly detached from it.
When Sherlock awoke he rubbed his eyes, gathered his thoughts, and had a realisation that potentially changed everything. It is as if he had run full pelt into a brick wall. John sat in front of him as he had a few days previously, awaiting eagerly for him to say something, anything. Well maybe anything but this, "John I can't do this."
Sherlock awoke maybe an hour after John awoke from his own disturbed slumber. In that whole time John paced anxiously, questioning whether his feelings where genuine compared to some sleep deprived or stress induced insanity. If they were, should he tell Sherlock? If it turns out not to be, should he tell him about his dream anyway? God this was all so confusing. When Sherlock woke up John just said, admittedly timid, "hello. How are you feeling?" Sherlock just groaned and said "what happened?" John took a cautious step closer to Sherlock's cheap hospital bed and said "you collapsed on the plane, we are in a hospital in Nanjing, they had to emergency land, it was all very dramatic, you would have loved it." A nervous laugh escaped from John's mouth. Sherlock was now fully out of the depths of sleep and went to prod around his chest.
Sherlock smiled, "I like your thinking Doctor Watson." So with that, it was home ward bound for the crime solving duo to get onto the next case that lay ahead.
Sherlock on the other hand, was a completely different story. As he entered his hotel room he did not even give himself time to close the door. He dropped his bag and was out again. He rubbed his eyes in the lift and shook his head in an attempt to wake himself up. He was in a case, of course sleep was not his priority. He waded out of the hotel he'd spent approximately six minutes in and ignored everyone around him. The marina was open to anyone to wander around and he took out his phone that held images of the missing Cleopatra he had been aptly given. He flicked through them and looked at the boats illuminated only by the infrequent lights along the floating dock. It was difficult to see every detail due to the lack of light, but sure enough there she was. A ketch sailboat, approximately forty-five feet long. Her sails were down, clearly not going anywhere any time soon. Much to the happiness of Sherlock, the glorious word 'Cleopatra' in its green and white glory remained along the impressive boats flank. He brushed his hand smoothly along the entire word, making it more real that he'd actually found the boat. Immediately he added to his image of the murderers, they had either been too lazy or cocky or stupid to remove the word, could have been all three. Or potentially they were short of time. The last idea gave Sherlock hope that this case may be closed soon. Hot on their heels, feeling the pressure, on the run from whatever storm they knew was headed their way. 'The east wind is coming.'  Sherlock smiled as the sentence breathed through his mind. John and Sherlock were that storm. And he was determined to make the run aways feel its chill. He snapped several photographs of the boat and sent the best image to John; 'Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, Goes to, and back, lackeying the varying tide, To rot itself with motion. -SH'
John internally panicked, oh god he saw, Sherlock could see, he'd barely been conscious and he already saw straight to John's heart. John just swallowed and shook his head and said "no, nothing, there's nothing, else." Sherlock looked doubtful and did a series of deductions about his assistant, he did see it, he did in fact see it. Dilated pupils, hands closed in front of his body, legs crossed, defensive body language, he was chewing the inside of his lip, nervous, twitchy, overtired, quickened breathing, definite stress, he saw it all but he couldn't quite put it together. He decided that John probably wanted privacy, even though he knew the 'nothing' was a lie, he would realise it soon. He always did.
So that was that conversation over. The two men sighed and Sherlock could feel himself on the verge of needing to leap out of his seat and
John received a phone call informing him of Sherlock's apparent kip nap. Will he make it to the meeting point, or is it all a rouse...
One moment, Sherlock's eyes were fluttering closed as he decidedly gave in. The next, they were jumping apart at the deafening crash behind them.
“Sherlock, I thought-!” He stopped himself and straightened back up, seemingly calmer. “Just leave a bloody voicemail or text next time, alright? You had me nearly scared to death.”
John looked up and realized he still had his hands on Sherlock’s chest, and had been gradually inching closer. So close, he could see his small reflection in Sherlock’s aquamarine eyes. They were serious and slightly stern, pointedly staring back down at him.
Sherlock swished off to begin his exploration leaving John to haul all of their bags to the master bedroom himself. When he finally found it, he stood in the doorway for a moment simply admiring it.
Leaning on the edge of the ship, he looked out into the deep, indigo water, calm as he had ever seen it. He heard light, cautious footsteps approach, and in a moment, Sherlock was next to him gazing at the vast ocean ahead of them. Neither of them spoke or moved for several minutes, before Sherlock decided to break the silence.
But… I’m curious. Yes, curious. That’s it. Completely objectively curious as to the relationship status of this man I only met yesterday.
“Good, good. I’m working on a case today. An ongoing one, in fact. Been working on this one for a while. Most interesting case for months. Want to come?”
Honestly this was supposed to be a one-shot, like no longer than 4k. And it turned into . . . this. Lol, so thank you for reading and being patient!
Greg chuckled in good nature. “No, actually uh . . .” He trailed off. There was something cautiously delicate about the way he spoke. He averted his eyes to avoid Sherlock’s, blinking rapidly.  “I, uh, got a call that you’re wanted back at the precinct.”
The more John yelled, the angrier he got. All his built up rage spilled out before he could stop himself.
Sherlock expected he would look around the room, reminiscent of the time he’d spent here. But he simply locked eyes with him, one corner of his mouth twitching up. “Yeah. Home.”
Here he was spread open and exposed with his legs propped up and Sherlock’s face just inches from his dripping cock. If he didn’t suck him off
Sherlock ran through the yard in the dark, led only by the light of the lantern in his hand. He called Lestrade, explaining where he was and begging him to come with the police force and an ambulance if necessary.
The man laughed. “Well, you’re pretty impressive yourself. I never could’ve gotten into medical school.”
Sherlock, now all but foaming at the mouth, struggled against the ropes. This only made Moriarty smile in satisfaction. John, on the other hand, was so very close to freeing his hands.
