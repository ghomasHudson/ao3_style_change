“Buck knew I was gay, didn’t he?” Judging by her erupting in laughter, he would say his suspicions were confirmed.
Tony stretched his legs out a little before turning to cuddle next to his husband and daughter – taking a breath before reassuring her.
“Money isn’t everything, Harley. We are fortunate to not live on the streets, but we don’t judge those less fortunate than us. All that Alpha was doing was bragging about his extravagant life that was
“I saw her in court just before she started school here. I was there for…well that’s not important. What is, is that she gets a second chance after what she went through.” Peter nearly melted at the genuine comment. He didn’t expect the next petty words to come out of his own mouth.
“S’okay Harley, Daddy is safe with us. He’s not going anywhere,” Peter reassured his sibling while Tony shifted a little.
“Steve, you know she was joking, right?” Tony stood seriously in front of his husband to emphasize his point; Steve was always a little sensitive about stuff like that. He smiled when those gorgeous blue eyes were visible again, his eyes trailing down to his husband’s lips which were also now sporting a smile.
“That’s the male lion, male lions have manes and act like protectors. But they’re really just lazy, the ladies do most of the work.” She heard both Clint and Steve chuckle at Peter’s explanation, though she didn’t see what was funny.
“-You didn’t! You didn’t tell me you signed up for the army! How long ago was this? Jesus you ship out a few weeks after graduating?”
His eyebrows furrowed as he turned to get a better look at her face. She looked a little skittish but also kind of excited, nervous energy evident as she bounced back and forth on her feet. He did a quick three sixty scan, trying to see if it was obvious what she was talking about.
“Shit,” he muttered to himself, holding the phone to his ear to listen to the voicemails. His phone beeped to indicate low power, Steve cursing under his breath again with frustration.
“Oh, dear. Do you have any kind of identification on you to prove that?” Rebecca asked again. There were a few nurses in the background, but none had noticed the interaction yet.
“Of course baby, what a great idea! You are such a sweet boy,” he said as he added a few kisses to his cheek. Peter squealed in delight before trying to escape his grasp.
“Steeb go?” he heard his baby brother ask in disappointment, the toddler walking over to throw his hands up at the blonde.
See…her Dad had kind of asked her to go straight home after school to do her homework. And only then, could she hang out with Bill and Kristen.
“Miss Emerson, based on your heart rate and physical symptoms I believe you are having a ‘panic attack.’ I can help you through this…”
He definitely must’ve zoned out if enough time had passed that Steve had read several stories and kissed their son goodnight. Steve always told him he’d tried to limit it to two…but those puppy eyes got him every time.
“Oh, what an interesting turn of events,” Steve said with a smile as he looked thru his mom’s old recipe book.
“I...it’s not that I don’t want to meet the kid. And it’s not that...I haven’t necessarily forgiven Kimberly...I just...it feels like going means invalidating what happened to me. And I know it shouldn’t...I know even with all those years of therapy and medication I should be-”
“I’ll see you Monday,” Steve said with a small smile, which Tony easily returned when face to face with this handsome teen.
“You say Steve brute. Steve carry mate back to house,” the blonde said in what Tony presumed to be a ‘caveman voice’.
A few minutes later he heard feet approaching, looking up to see Jarvis looking down at him with a smile. His parents weren’t as forthcoming with physical signs of love, but Jarvis and his wife always were. He reached his hands out and Jarvis immediately pulled him into his arms, cuddling with him on the couch.
“-James,” Clint interrupted his quiet ramblings. “I’m still processing the whole...we’re still together part - are...are you sure you even want to be with me?” he asked, because fairytales weren’t real; even if he brought Lucky up to his face to accept more kisses.
He felt several soft kisses to the back of his neck before his husband’s hands moved to grip his waist. Steve brought his hands down as Tony turned him around to face him. He wrapped his arms around his husband’s waist as his love moved to wrap his arms around Steve’s neck. Steve pulled him in to kiss, relishing moments like this that they get together.
“Actually, that particular scar was from a ‘her.’ So, rip her…ovaries out,” she managed with a small chuckle, sitting up to face him on the couch.
Tony tipped the kind workers so they could run straight to their secluded beach on the open ocean, letting the three take care of the luggage as they raced each other to the waves like little kids. They started stripping and running when they hit the sand, leaving on their underwear as they dived into the water.
Steve really, really did not want to tag along with his brother to the bar, no matter how many times the jerk nagged him that he needed to get laid. Just because Bucky’s known his Omega since kindergarten, and the pair have loud obnoxious sex in their shared small two bedroom apartment, didn’t mean Steve needed to stick his knot in any Omega that looks his way.
“No we don’t,” Barnes argued as he stood up with the baby and proceeded to take him and the diaper bag to the nearby restroom.
“Alright Harley, the internet is back on. And don’t think I didn’t notice the small footprints climbing up the table. Care to explain that?”
“Peter,” Tony repeated, looking at the pup wrapped in a blue blanket. A little fluff of brown on top of his head. He was perfect.
What happened next, Miles will be the first to admit he could’ve handled it differently. It’s just, Harry lunged for the spider, so Miles felt compelled to do the same. However, the spider wasn’t the only thing on the table. There was the chemicals they had experimented with.
“Hey there Daci, want me to show you what I’m making?” the tall blonde offered, which Daci took with a nod and raised arms. He gently lifted her up by her armpits before settling her on his hip. She had gotten better with physical touch and had begun to trust the Avengers, starting with Steve and Tony.
The other side of her craved reassurance and loved Steve despite his many faults and relished at the idea of at least being near him…
“But you don’t, baby,” hating himself for the break in his voice as he slowly shook his head. “You keep bottling it up until it explodes and hurts someone you didn’t mean to.”
“It’s Pepper,” the blonde said walking the two in the direction of the closest guest room. “I wouldn’t be surprised if she put lube in there, knowing us. Oh that reminds me,” he walked back to the table. He then balanced Tony’s weight on one arm, squatting down to pick up his gym bag. The brunette wiggled his eyebrows at his love, laughing as they went to make up for lost time.
“Did you forget they live streamed the official first meeting of the accords? I watched you guys argue and bicker like kids over stuff that isn’t worth it. What you two have – I’ve never seen anything like it. And while I’ve come to find your impromptu make-out and/or groping sessions often embarrassing and gross, I’ve never seen the kind of love…never thought something like that was possible.” Steve was suddenly feeling very guilty and confused, moving himself to sit directly next to his sad child.
He wasn’t sure what he was expecting from Steve, maybe secretly joy? But his stomach sank when the blonde frowned.
"Also, yes," Wade answered with a smirk as Peter pulled back to glare at him. "So damn cute when you pout," Wade said as he pulled Peter by his jacket back into his embrace and onto his lips once more.
So yeah, he went to the roof to smoke a joint. What he really hadn’t expected was for Coulson to follow him up there and confront the teen about it.
“Come on,” he murmured aloud, standing them up before bringing him into his arms without even thinking. Leo was limp in his grasp, not protesting as Peter walked the two back. He realized after a moment that the boy must’ve fallen asleep.
“Would you like to go on a hike together?” he finally spit out. Steve raised a brow at him a moment before responding.
“And I’m pretty sure I just told you grounded children don’t get to make any rules,” Tony said quizzically.
“Go pick out a few books, Jo,” he said as he glared at his brother, seeing her scramble off the couch out of the corner of his eye.
“MY EGO?” Steve roared. “If you took two seconds to take your head out of your own ass, you would hear me long enough to –”
Avoiding both his parents, Jarvis and his wife Anna was a difficult task, but he knew if they tried talking to him he’d spill the beans. He thanked Tesla that the hallways were empty.
“Alright! Enough pillow throwing you two. And Clint dear, you’re a tad biased,” their Ma said with a smile, reaching for a cookie and giving half of it to a giggling Harley. “So Tony, would you like to see baby pictures of Stevie?” The Alpha had taken a drink of lemonade and choked on it from the question.
"Hey husband, do you want to know what your daughter did earlier?" Steve asked as their daughter tried to protest with a mouthful of hot chocolate.
Steve, the wonderful Alpha of his, signed on to take over Stark Industries so Tony could actually run it for himself when Howard finally retired. Steve turned into a full time house husband while still doing part time work for Pappy’s gym.
“HEY!” she squawked as she tried to wiggle free, not exactly enjoying the two grown ass men dog-pile crushing her…but laughing nonetheless.
After everyone had finished their breakfast and gotten dressed, Steve drove them to a barber shop Sam had recommended. The man had offered to do it himself, especially since he "finally had a kid who loved him." But Steve wanted Miles to have the experience, plus they could also do Emerson's hair. Win win.
“You did that for me?” she asked quietly. He nodded in response, not thinking it was that big of a deal at the time that he did it.
She won’t lie, she coughed. A lot. Kristen got her a glass of water and told her the one hit was probably enough for her.
“You’re an easy target, Clint,” the girl replied without much sympathy, which got another laugh out of the super soldier. Clint gasped in fake offense as the elevator dinged again, revealing a sleepy looking Bruce.
"Maybe," he said as Steve said "no." The blonde shot the brunette a glare but Tony ignored it, piercings - unlike tattoos - can fade.
she thought to herself as she noticed Isaac was suddenly out of the pool, somehow sans floaties and running to the deep end where his fathers suddenly noticed, panicked and screamed to swim to him just as he jumped in,
“Take your time, baby girl, we’re right here” she heard Tony’s voice next to Steve’s. They must be on speakerphone.
“Oh really?” Steve asked with a raised brow, their flirting interrupted by the loud and obvious coughs coming from their kids.
“I think you’ve helped in here enough, sweet pea,” Bucky said with a brow raised while she turned to giggle mischievously back at him.
The blonde started making plates and bringing them over to the island as he saw Miles shimmy down from his other father.
“No way in hell,” Steve answered quickly, looking to see if his husband disagreed. The man didn’t, probably just as concerned about the injury as he was.
“Can it wait until I’ve taken a shower?” the blonde asked, pushing past his husband as he heard the sounds of his grandkids attacking his youngest in the living room.
"So you really think you and Buckaroo will have a pup? You'd make a great Mama bear, you know. It's part of the reason we made you godmother," Tony said with a smile to his friend, loving the blush it got from the blonde.
deserve the one thing she asked for on her eighteenth birthday?" the man asked with a smirk, seeing his girl give her best puppy eyes to her other father. Steve squinted his eyes as he looked back and forth between the two a moment before instantly conceding; he smiled and shook his head at the pair.
Tony caught the crying boy who had flung himself at him, quickly scanning his body for injuries as the boy pointed behind him.
Steve was frozen, hands held in front of him unsure what to do. Wade quickly stood back up to readjust his sunglasses and rubbed his face – which, the super soldier noted…was sans fake mustache – turning to nod at Emerson.
Tony turned to his husband who was frozen in place, feeling his instincts take over as he ordered his assistant to relieve Pepper of Peter duty so she could take care of the PR nightmare.
“Em-” Tony began as he sat down where Nat had. He was stopped by his husband who held a firm grip on his shoulder.
“You wouldn’t,” she said hesitantly; Steve unable to stop the smile from spreading across his face when she brought his attention back to her.
That was Tony’s take away from all those fucking tests that Bruce ran for him. He might’ve said ‘minor heart surgery’ but all Tony heard was that he’d need to go under to be cut open for a huge serious surgery.
The first day Sarah came home from the hospital, Tony was the one who kept trying to keep Joe and Steve from fussing over her as he wheeled her into her house.
“Wait wait,” Tony giggled as he stood up with Steve, taking the blonde’s free hand in his. “Just, let me set the record straight,” the brunette said more seriously, kind of scaring the blonde for a moment. “I’d marry you tomorrow, but I’m not an idiot like Barnes and Barton - who are miraculously still married - and I want to live together first. But make no mistake Steven Grant Rogers,” Tony purred as he grabbed Steve’s face in his hands, “I do plan on spending the rest of my life with you. Got it?”
"The dean of one of the colleges I'm looking into is a huge fan of Stark Industries and I was hoping you could butter him up a little, now move stinky Pete," she said as she used her foot to push him in the direction of his room.
“If it makes you feel any better, I told him he was delusional. Offered him a ride to the hospital,” he said, smile spreading when he heard Tony chuckle a little in his arms. He snuggled him closer, smiling into his hair as he let Tony postpone the inevitable back-story.
So today, instead of meeting Tony at some restaurant, he was going to his apartment to cook for the two Starks. Steve had felt bad for not inviting Tony back to his apartment, but the Omega understood the teasing from Bucky and Clint would only get worse if he came around.
“Your obvious homophobia shouldn’t inhibit my opportunity for a happy life, you piece of shit.” The other adults in the room looked at her in shock, Peter noticed his parents wearing matching smiles.
” before kissing his boyfriend. His love murmured it back as he wrapped his arms around the blonde and even deepened the kiss.
“What did I say would happen, huh punk?” Steve smiled as the wiggle worm continued flailing and failing to evade his captor’s embrace. Emerson scooted a little closer to Tony, not wanting a stray limb to hit her.
They bid their teammates goodnight when they got off at their floor, Steve taking the opportunity to pinch his husband’s behind. Tony squealed adorably when he did so, turning to glare at the man who suddenly took interest in the ceiling. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see his husband’s hands go to his hips and a pout on his face which made Steve’s face break into a smile.
forgive you…which means…your parents will too.” She heard the woman turn and quickly walk in the opposite direction.
“That’s it,” Dr. Carmichael reassured with a smile. “Bodies get used to medicines over time, we just have to up the dosage and you’ll be right as rain.” Tony turned to his husband who shared a look of relief with him.
"I am telling you," he said with an eye roll, "if I could go back ten months ago, I still wouldn't have worn the condom."
“Hi Steve,” Daci said as she walked around him to see what he was making. She stood on her tippy toes but she was still too short to see what was on the stove.
“Yeah he’s been busy with work,” Tony easily lied again, having read that SI’s stock was currently tanking. He looked at Steve for a moment, who had a small frown on, like he wasn’t buying Tony’s story but he also didn’t want to push it. The blonde eventually stood up and walked him to his car, pulling him in for a long kiss before eventually pulling away.
Steve had reminded him that Tony had the ultimate veto power, he could keep Stone out of Harley’s life...but the way his pup had lit up at the mention of a man he’d never even met before...Tony couldn’t see it in himself to deprive his son of knowing the Alpha.
Steve actually took the time to look through the papers, getting another laugh from Tony as he already knew they'd be going to the animal shelter. Em apparently did too as she smiled brightly at the shorter man in excitement.
“Well Sir, with this physique it was either that or stripping.” Emerson choked on her water, hands covering her face to prevent any further laughter. Peter closed his eyes, hoping his dads understood he was joking.
“Oh? Did um...did any of them make fun of you for...you know…being here with me?” Tony asked nervously, remembering being shoved into a few lockers after his bleachers dance.
Later, when he pulled up to the gate, he suddenly found himself nervous. It was easy to forget Tony was the son of a millionaire and therefore lived in a mansion. It was intimidating, but it didn’t stop Steve from entering the code and following the driveway to the entrance.
Steve tried his best to conceal his laughter but was unable to when his husband's stomach rumbled from his own cackling.
“So that makes Em…” Steve said thinking as Tony finished for him “four.” The husbands looked at each other for another sad moment before Peter interrupted them.
Steve’s finger shook a little as he dialed the phone, putting his back in his pocket as he held the other one to his ear. It only took two rings.
He knocked on the door, opening it and stepping into the room when he heard the faint, “come in.” Emerson had her comforter wrapped around her where she sat on the bed. She looked a lot younger sitting like that. Tony scanned the teen’s room, noting a new poster near her bed. Another Emerson quote, the father noted reading it quickly.
“Can I see what you were working on?” Steve asked, cutting off Tony’s ramblings in favor of seeing what the genius had created. In their English class, he’d occasionally sneak a look at what Tony was working as he scribbled on a page sideways. He never understood anything and it looked complicated, but that usually only meant it was awesome. Steve had heard several stories of the fire department having to come put out the flames from his ‘experiments.’
Tony could’ve stayed there forever, the genius’ hand caressing the blonde’s face as they slid around his neck to pull him even closer. Except they were interrupted suddenly.
“Tony, I wasn’t always like this. When I was younger, I was incredibly sick. I had asthma and I was frail and scrawny. The doctors didn’t think I’d make it. But my Pop found this doctor with an experimental drug. They said it would cure me of my ailments, make me stronger...but I would be infertile for the rest of my life. I accepted I could never have my own kids. It’s why when I saw you at the park...and I saw you had a pup of your own...I thought I could have everything I ever wanted…”
"So, you going to finally tell me what Bucky said that upset you?" he asked his husband who fondly rolled his eyes at him; the man must've known he'd bring it up sooner or later. His love took a breath before answering quietly.
“You’re still grounded for the weekend,” the blonde added, enjoying the groans coming from his three children.
He snapped back to the present when he had one last member to tend to, helping them sign in before walking over to the ring to watch.
I was changing your dirty diaper. And when you made me read Green Eggs and Ham so many times I started reciting it in my sleep?” he took the time to pause, glad to see her smile at that. “Your first word was ‘dada’ but you know what your third word was? Seeb.” She laughed a little at that, curiosity reading across her face.
“Tony, honey look at me,” she said gently, continuing when he finally did look at her. “Steve loves you. I didn’t think it was possible for anyone to love you more than Jim and I, but
“Mr. Jarvis, can you help? I don’t...I don’t know what to do. He dumped me a few days ago and since then he hasn’t been in school and won’t respond to anyone,” Steve said.
“Carolyn…do you know I’m gay?” The older woman almost choked on her water, taking a moment to catch her breath before responding.
Her face scrunched up before she answered, “my dad was for a few weeks.” When she finished she refused to look at him, which was fair because he was gawking at her.
“Technically Harley won, since you fought dirty,” Pappy said to Steve before turning to the smaller blonde. “And you, you ready to tell me what got ya so angry?”
"She'll say Granddaddy eventually," Helen assured him as she placed the diaper bag behind the couch.
"I don't know what you're talking about, I don't see any Jamie here," he said teasingly as his grandson laughed and his daughter simply glared at him.
“Are you breaking up with me Steve?” Tony asked with a sly smile as he took his own sip of coffee.  Steve couldn’t help but laugh a little at that, wondering why he was fighting the warmth in his chest just sitting near this man.
When Clint politely shook his head no, she decided then and there that she was the one who needed to do something about this.
But for now, he settled for watching his best friend walk happily away just as his own boyfriend made his way back into view, walking up to Steve with a huge grin.
“Rhodes, can you stay here for me on standby?” he asked, not waiting for an answer as he grabbed his husband’s hand to lead them to the bathroom.
He was left with Nat and Clint, as the other medics had left, who looked almost as pissed as Sam had seemed. He wondered how much time he had before Fury possibly fired him to find out exactly what happened, when of course their radios went off and they had to leave for a call.
“I didn’t use my powers,” she said in her defense, leaning against the man who already said it was fine. When an arm wrapped around her, a smile broke across her face. When she looked up and saw her Tati squinting at her Daddy, her smile got bigger.
"You're welcome Thumper," he said with a big smile as he moved out of the blankets, still remaining on the bed with her. She pulled the blankets back as well, sitting up and stretching next to him.
“And if that’s not enough!” she said loudly, causing them both to look back at her in surprise. “She did swat me on the leg with her slipper,” she said with a sudden pout.
“Skootch,” he said to Peter, who took the hint and moved to make room on the bed for the larger man. “You don’t have to nap with me, but you can at least lie here quietly,” he said as he cuddled up next to Peter. Once he readjusted the blanket, he reached into his back pocket and handed Peter one of his Dad’s tablets.
“It’s good though, right? You know you can tell Tony if you need any updates,” Steve replied, smiling at both his friend's comfort and his husband's genius.
“Yes, call the school if you don’t believe me! I did get detention from my stupid English teacher! I thought…I just…needed a second before babysitting again and then time kind of got away from me…”
“Hi there little one,” Clint cried out, not caring of the free flow of tears as the puppy began to wake up and started licking his face.
Physically, he was fine. The teachers rushed over the second Harley kneeled at recess and separated the little assholes from his son before a fight could break out, but mentally...well...his pup was essentially a zombie.
"Like you ever have to worry about that," her Dad teased at him, getting a giggle from the boy sitting in between them. The giggle could also be attributed to the fact that Max had scaled the couch and was inspecting her little brother's food.
“Oh Tony, you didn’t need me,” Steve said with that goddamn sincere smile of his. “You could’ve done all that on your own.” Tony couldn’t help flushing from the praise, taking the blonde’s hand back and dragging the two to his car.
“Hey, don’t just walk away from me,” Steve said as he followed his husband into the kitchen, where the brunette had his back turned as he rifled through their tea selection.
He sent Steve a text on their way home, sitting in the back with Jo – who was listening to music on her headphones – while Happy drove them.
“Rogers,” Fury called out before Steve could round the corner, “let me know if you need anything,” he said kindly, surprising the blonde.
“Oh, I’ll talk to Pop about it tonight,” he assured her, failing at ignoring the several other pings coming from his phone.
“You know who would love that performance Petey-pie? Joey! Why don’t you go play her some songs so Steve can study?” Tony encouraged with a smile as Steve wondered if the toddler would fall for it.
After messing with JARVIS to give her a heads start, and using Tony’s voice to call and pay for a cab, she was on her way to her destination, ignoring the odd look from the cab driver. He didn’t comment though, so maybe he was just confused about a child traveling by themselves.
speak about my son that way again,” Joe said with an alarming calm, towering over the man who was struggling to sit up. “It’s bad enough you speak to your sweet boy that way, who I’d be honored to call a son-in-law, but you will not speak about
Steve’s hand gently slipped into his, reminding Tony he was here - further affirming the genius that he wasn’t alone.
Tony hummed in approval, a smile appearing on his lips as Steve started walking the two back to their bed. His love fell back and bounced on the mattress, putting a smile on his handsome face. Steve smiled back at him, moving his hands along his love’s abs to lift his shirt up.
Even if Leo and him didn’t always get along, it was refreshing to see the boy get along so well with his dad. He made it a point to visit his parents more often - especially since they lived closer now - to see the two bond. And yes...maybe also give Peter a break. He was tired of being the bad guy.
“What? You don’t think I know my own company?” he asked as Jo felt her eyes widen in shock, which only earned a laugh from the adults.
“He’s cute,” Pete admitted quietly, not enjoying the giant smile spread across his love’s handsome features. “But I’m going to need more convincing than his looks. I learned my lesson from you,” he sassed the man who smiled mischievously back at him.
“Jesus Tony, can we order lunch first?” the older man asked with a fake laugh, snapping his fingers up in the air to grab a waiter’s attention.
Steve and Tony exchanged glances, concerned about their son as well as the sweet young girl they had gotten to know. “Tell her she’s welcome anytime,” Tony said before insisting on his Pop’s rule.
“…what did your uncle tell you?” Joey’s own eyes narrowed at that question; Carolyn’s gaze not leaving hers as she continued.
“I’ll be up whenever I finish,” the grumpy genius replied, not even looking up as Steve left the lab.
“It’s just you know...hard to shake off some things from the past,” Clint added with a shrug, weaving his arms around James and smashing his face in his neck. He smiled when he heard James hum in understanding, returning the hug and placing a kiss on Clint’s temple.
A cry caught her attention again, jerking up and seeing the source of the sound. Her Dad had squeaked in excitement as Leo swam several feet on his own. She watched with a smile as the other members of her family cheered the boy on.
“It’ll be a supervised visit in Melanie’s office,” Wade reminded him, sharing a look of uncertainty with Peter.
“Sorry Barnes, Strange said it was a combo of blunt force trauma and exposure to a different smell. How are you feeling?” Stark asked as his armor retreated off Bucky.
“Another time, he tried to jump off our second-story balcony because there was a kitty on the ground,” she said with a teasing grin. Joey looked shocked and turned to frown at him.
“He asked you…wait…so you KNEW?!” He was not amused by the giant smile on her face, nor the fake-innocent shrug she offered. “Why wouldn’t you just tell me?”
She knows better than to turn around, but does so anyway and isn’t surprised to find her arch nemesis walking towards her.
“Thank you,” she said with misty eyes. “I love you, Dad.” His eyes got waterier than hers as he smiled brightly back at her.
“Harley, do you want to come sit on my lap? Maybe let your Daddy breathe for a bit?” Steve asked, surprising Tony as his Alpha sat on the chair behind him.
“Because I want to encourage my daughter, Steven,” the nineteen year old said with a smile, only ever using his full name to annoy him. Joey took that opportunity to crawl over her uncle’s leg and towards the couch, where the camera sat.
“His name is none of your goddamn business cause he is not your son. I’m bonded, Ty. I have a new Alpha and soon he’ll adopt
“I don’t like it when people lie to me or talk down to me,” she began – continuing when she saw Kate taking notes, encouraged by her sincerity. “If I don’t want to talk about something in that moment, I ask you don’t push it. I can…maybe…in time…but, sometimes it feels like my brain shuts down. Like, whatever I was thinking about is ripped away from me…” she trailed off, feeling it happening again.
“I’m pregnant, bambino. You’re going to be a big brother!” Tony added, hoping his enthusiasm would catch. It did not.
“Uncle Clint! Can we have pizza for dinner?” Peter asked the man as he flew past them, joining his siblings on the floor.
Using his height to her advantage, she weaved throughout the course, laughing at his frustrated noises when she kept just out of reach.
“I don’t know, maybe it’s just a weird gut feeling I’m having,” he began turning back to the dishes before his husband interrupted him.
Sure, having his own room for the first time in…ever…was nice, but he missed his big bro and baby niece. Even when said niece was a screaming lunatic…like today.
"What'd you do, get Wade pregnant?" his Dad asked jokingly before his Pop visibly went rigid behind him. Peter couldn't help but laugh a little at that. "Babe," his Dad continued, "two men can't get each other pregnant. Remember, we've tried? Many times?"
“Watch it,” Steve said sharply, motioning her to stay on the counter as he cleaned up the rest of the glass.
“Bucky, please,” Steve said as Tony kissed Morgan before handing the much calmer baby to Clint. “Clint’s injured and this is too last minute to call anyone.” Daci just stayed in his arms, waiting for him to decide and smiling when he leaned back against the couch with a groan.
The squirming increased the smacking intensity, which increased the leg kicking, which meant kicking off her shorts to god knows where.
“Even when I pull stupid shit like this?” he asked when he pulled back, eyes focused on how puffy Steve’s lips were.
“Hey you two, why are you guys hanging out in the shallow end?” her Dad asked as he swam over to sit next to them. Emerson looked over at Leo, giving him a chance to answer before she made something up for him.
“Or you could come back with us? Sleep in an actual bed again tonight?” Howard teased the pup who only snuggled closer to Tony.
“You...felt the crash didn’t you?” Tony asked, getting his answer when his mate looked away from him. “Oh Steve, I'm so sorry.”
“The same man that I thought was straight forward with me since day one, only to find out you also made sure to tell your
“Zip it or I’ll recode the sass out of you,” Tony threatened, too busy working on his calculation for an armor upgrade to put any real threat into it.
“It’ll make you feel better,” Steve answered the silent question with a shrug, smiling at his pup who suddenly became excited.
"Morning Iron Man, can you show me your pulse blaster stance?" Steve's eyes rolled as the two stuck an arm out with their hands extended. He then stole a glance at Emerson, who was sticking her tongue out at the returning five year old. He coughed to get both their attentions as they quickly stopped, then he had to shoot a glare to his husband who had simply laughed at the childish antics.
Bucky signed at him, enjoying the purely offended look Clint gave him before the blonde quickly opened the containers and dug in. Bucky chuckled as he watched him, placing a gentle hand on his boyfriend's leg (and far away from his sharp teeth - learned that the hard way) and smiling at the scene before him.
“Steve’s bonded, who cares? Did you know my Alpha wants to fuck another Omega?” The attention temporarily turned to Bucky who looked shocked and angry from the question.
"Yeah, that's what I thought," the brunette said smugly as he wiped his hands on the closest towel. He walked quickly out of the lab to find his distressed little boy.
“You must be really bored now that you’re retired, old man,” she said as she began copying his movements. Even though the man was technically over a hundred, he still only looked to be in his early forties – minus a few grays that recently became visible. Compared to her Dad, who had ‘salty sideburns’ and constantly threatened to dye it. Her Pop gave her a look that snapped her out of her thoughts.
And sure enough, a butt naked toddler zoomed in to rejoin them in the living room. Tony and Steve burst out laughing as they saw Joey look at her son in horror.
she realized with a frown at his hesitancy. Tati had explained to her something called ‘good vs bad touch’ and Clint was just trying to give her a good one.
The AI paused a moment before contributing, “shall I give Sirs a call then? They are currently in Yemen on mission and Mister Stark explicitly instructed me to contact him if necessary. And before you interject” Damn, he really was good. “Sir would remind you that your mental health is your priority, and therefore necessary. And I also happen to know for a fact that the two are not currently busy, as they are accessing YouTube on one of Mister Stark’s tablets.” Well damn, that made her smile and even maybe chuckle a little.
And kicking his tiny legs like he was running from something...or possibly after something. It got the two teens chuckling fondly and sitting up fully. He watched as Clint reached over and grabbed the basket of food, bringing it in front of them before leaning into Bucky's side.
“Daddy!” his baby screamed as he literally jumped his little body up and down in joy. May, bless that beautiful woman, stepped back and pulled her phone out to snap some pictures as Peter ran into Tony’s outstretched arms.
“…Strange…” Tony confirmed as his husband walked over to inspect the bottle as well. Peter decided that it was time to switch fathers, Tony trying not to groan as his son squeezed him in a tight hug.
It didn’t hurt anymore and was wrapped in a white bandage…but she was still upset she had not only had a seizure while she slept and was
“Um, I have a Daddy. And he says you’re my father.” Tony couldn’t help frowning at the scoff that came out of his ex.
“No no, the deal was a new couch; we aren’t getting you presents because we love each other. Children should be happy their parents are happy!”
“Be not the slave of your own past – plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep and swim far. So you shall come back with self-respect, with new power and with an advanced experience that shall explain and overlook the old.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson
Two weeks after they brought Peter home, Steve could barely stand on his own two feet. He was so incredibly exhausted. Every time Tony got up to feed, Steve got up as well. The Alpha insisted on changing diapers and got up with the colicky baby whenever it wasn’t food the pup was after.
She snuggled closer to her father and watched as Morgan pulled his long hair, smiling to herself as the two interacted with one another. Maybe one day he’d consider having more kids, she might not mind having siblings.
“You wouldn’t have let me see her anyway!” she said, feeling her own anger grow in her chest at this emotional ambush.
“Wait, Nat move,” the doctor said with a hand resting on her arm. Both he and the redhead turned to him incredulously before the doctor took a deep intake through his nose.  “Tony, do you smell this?” one genius asked the other, getting Stark to stand up and walk towards them.
“What the hell are you talking about?” he growled out, feeling more anger zip up his spine. “I think I would’ve noticed if my girlfriend injected me with something…”
While the burgers were sizzling and the fries were baking in the oven, his little brother asks if he can ‘handle the rest’. Pete throws a glare his way before waving the teen off, not a fan of the smug look the brat gave him.
He handed over a single piece of paper, the genius carefully taking it and gazing upon the image before him.
After several conversations with Steve and a few negotiations with his ex, they finally decided to meet up at a mall. Tiberius had begged Tony to let him take the pup shopping, so Tony scheduled for him and Steve to get massages for an hour before the four met up at the food court again.
“You could always…punish me for my disobedience,” he responded suggestively while he hopped down. He squealed internally when he saw the flicker of change in Steve’s eyes. The hungry desire that usually means he was about to get rough. In an instant, Tony found himself turned around and shoved down against the table while a solid body pressed up against his back.
“Your phone’s been blowing up,” the brunette said after a yawn, reaching over to grab the phone on his bedside table to hand to Steve. He saw him glance at the screen, cheeks turning pink when he noticed Steve noticing him.
Miles was curled in on himself, crying in the middle of his bed. Tony walked over, sitting gently next to the boy. The movement stirred the bed, causing the kid to look up into his father's eyes.
“Don’t fret Steve,” Tony said as he used one hand to pat his shoulder in comfort. “Can you call her? See where she went?” Steve felt his eyes close in anger.
"You all must be exhausted from your trip. Please, follow us as we provide refreshments and show you to your rooms," T'Challa said as he clapped the blonde on his shoulder and talked as they made their way inside. Shuri immediately grabbed Peter, pulling him back a little to speak with him. Emerson stayed in the middle of the group, not wanting to intrude on their conversation but most definitely planning on intruding on their conversation.
“Every parent makes sacrifices for their kid,” Tony said with confidence as she shot a little smile his way. “It’s pretty obvious how much Steve loves you.”
Wearing dark jeans and a tight shirt, he joined Bucky and Clint in the living room, where the pair gave him thumbs up in approval. Steve just rolled his eyes again.
“Barney?!” Clint suddenly shouted in excitement, seeing his big brother sitting on the carpet playing with his pup. The shorter blonde ran over and tackled the vet, who he momentarily forgot was hospitalized several months ago.
He was jealous to admit it, but they got along well together. Which could prove to be a terrible thing, knowing his Dad.
“Fuck…” Tony began, “I’m so sorry Steve! Son of a bitch probably ambushed you at work, huh?” he asked as Steve’s face morphed into shock. “Of course he fucking did. I’ll take care of this, I promise. Shit, fuck no wonder you’re so pissed…” he rambled as he started pacing around Steve.
kid. Not yours and not yours,” Tati added angrily while pointing his fingers at Clint and Steve in turn. With his hand still gripping her arm, he pulled her along towards the exit of the zoo. She could hear the two men calling after them but was too focused on the metal grip on her arm.
Joey extracted herself from Tony to run to Steve, who stretched his arms and embraced her with a “hey baby girl.” He rubbed her back as she began to calm down. Steve eventually looked up at Tony with a small smile.
It was about another hour until her father returned, and in that time the three kids woke up from their naps and - along with Tony - joined them in coloring in the living room. When she heard the elevator ding, she internally squealed before she grabbed her best piece of paper and ran to greet him.
"We got called to the Stark Mansion...and Tony Stark was hitting on our Steve. I’m telling him to take the compliment,” Sam said matter-of-factly as he went to grab his food from the fridge.
“Wade Wilson…” Peter growled at the man, not surprised when his husband quietly added “Stark” to the end of his name. Wade had actually taken Stark for his last name when they wed, no hyphen or anything, just making Wilson his new middle name. Told Peter not to take Wilson, since they and all their kids could have the same last name.
This stopped the teen, feeling as though the woman had literally stabbed her through her heart – chills going down her spine. She was equally amazed and furious.
“Hey…what are you two doing up?” he asked as he made his way over to the bed. When he got close enough to her, she turned to wrap her arms around his middle.
“Nuh uh. I covered for your ass, you owe me a straight answer,” she said as she stared him down, chipping away his resolve.
“Are you sure?” Clint asked immediately, shifting the toddler in his arms to hang him upside down above his head, hands gently holding his hips. “You sure do
“It was Cheryl,” he said quietly, hanging his head as he felt James wrap his arm around him again. “She kissed me on the head and...it...reminded me of an old foster mom.” He took another shaky breath before continuing, glad James was being quiet and patient with him. “She uh, you know...molested me…”
"You formed this big family that we love, you helped Peter get the courage to date the man he'd eventually marry, you brought Miles into our lives...we just wanted to thank you, Emerson. With your past...we're just so proud of the person you've become. And we love you so much for it," her Pop added, smiling when Emerson felt her own eyes water at the sentiment.
“I’m dead, Steven. Your daughter killed me. It was a tragic tale and one that involves me writing her out of my will.”
Steve looked down at his niece, kissing the top of her head as he imagined his future extravagant single life.
“This is Clint, he found my wallet and brought it back to me,” Bucky explained as they heard the sounds of the ‘monsters’ joining them - screaming out ‘MOMMY!’ As he watched her squat down to give all three a hug, he suddenly felt like he’d outstayed his welcome.
“Second of all, your father was a great man, and snotty little shits reducing him to a white trash carnie when he owned and operated his own mechanic shop for ten years is…
"Well hot damn. Can't really be mad when you look that good, Em! I love it!" Tony said as he focused his attention on playing with their daughter's new hair. Steve moved to sit next to Miles, who leaned tiredly against the father, as the two of them watched Tony and Emerson fan over her new hair.
Steve actual made all the phone calls, able to get his shit together when he had actual tasks to perform. Tony enjoyed just holding Joey, who seemed to just be sleeping peacefully. When Steve finally calmed down from thinking she was dying from cancer, he asked to sit there and hold her. Which worked for Tony, who saw an opportunity to fix something that was broken – planning on giving it to her later.
Tony watched as Joey helped a still sleepy Peter eat, freezing when she held some peas to his lips. Maybe it was because he was tired…but Peter ate the peas without protest.
“Okay, let me see if I can do this,” the woman said as the teen looked back at her with furrowed brows.
"Stevie, I read my father's notes, the serum won't make you live forever," he said in reassurance, using one hand to guide his face back to look at him.
“No, this faggot needs to learn his lesson!” As Clint was rolling his eyes, he missed his boyfriend moving around the table to tower over the drunk jerk.
“HEY! You all get out of here and out of the line, unless you want us to call the cops.” Peter looked at Emerson, prepared to explain the situation when the group behind them spoke up first.
“Oh, okay. I see where you were going,” the blonde said absently as the older brunette shot him an offended glare. As his two ridiculous parents began arguing, he took their three empty plates to the sink to start cleaning them.
Pete took that as a sign to stand up and introduce himself, instantly freezing when the boy startled back in fear.
"Well, I think I know where some is, give me a second," he said before Emerson could interrupt. She tried anyway.
“Yeah Pops, she’s only been at my school for a few weeks. Kids speculate about what she did before, you know?”
“Jesus, you okay Joey?” he asked as he pulled the teen back to look into her eyes. She nodded yes, though her eyes told a different story, which brought her right back into the genius’ clutching embrace.
"Barnes, this is Miles. Miles, this is your Pop's friend from childhood. Remember what I told you about being nice to the elderly?" the smug man asked as Miles giggled into his shoulder.
“So what do you think? Should we grab a bite to eat?” he asked as he started the engine of his Camaro. Joey thought about that before an idea popped into her head.
She grabbed a throw-blanket from the closet before making an executive decision. Before she could talk herself out of it, she flapped the blanket in the air before settling herself down on her Pop’s lap. Who, thankfully, didn’t say a word, just helped her spread the blanket out before wrapping his arms around her. He rested his chin on her head, still waiting.
His husband bit his lip and raised his arms up, making it easier for Steve take the shirt off completely. He smiled at the small scar on his husband’s chest as he gently shifted the man further up on the bed where he could lay them out.
Her friend Xavier bumped into her passing through the halls, begging her to go shopping with him after school for his mom’s birthday present. She whined in protest but ultimately relented, deciding to drag him to some of her favorite stores at the dreaded mall.
“Don’t feed his ego, Steve. He doesn’t deserve it,” the genius finished with a glare at the bot, who seemed unfazed as it kept chirping happily at Steve.
“Oh, um…remember when you correctly identified me as the Cher in the relationship?” he asked, smiling as she laughed at the memory. “When Steve referred to Sonny's death…I saw you both look away – both of you thinking about your dad.”
“Actually my love, as your parents, we have the legal right to take you to a hospital against your will. Especially when you are injured,” Tony said, ending his statement with a growl.
“Wanna color, Leo?” she asked the boy while pointing to the table. Leo looked hesitantly over to Wade for confirmation as the man smiled brightly back at the boy.
But he got it, hearing more than once around school that Clint was the ‘girl’ in the relationship. There wasn’t a girl in a male-male relationship, it’s literally there in the fucking name - but he understood the ignorance behind it. Didn’t agree with it, but he understood.
The teen looked like she was genuinely thinking it over, before turning to the man and responding with a head shake.
"I think I'm going to call it a night, kiddos have dentist appointments tomorrow," Steve said before standing up and stretching his arms above his head. "You coming sweetheart?"
“Tony, introduce us to your friend,” Obie somewhat growled out, and it was the first time Tony had ever seen the man thrown off.
He took the thermometer out when it beeped and checked - one o' two point one. Okay so sick but not hospital worthy. Whose he kidding, he'd just make Uncle Bruce come fix them if it got to that point. And depending on their behavior...he may keep that info in the back of his mind anyway.
“Then you have nothing to apologize for, now stop sulking and show me pictures of little Tyrell!” she demanded as the two walked to Stark Industries.
“So she just sat back and watched you get your ass kicked? That’s worse!” Steve said incredulously before sighing heavily.
"Can I get it cut like Black Panther's?" he asked as he climbed the stool at the island. Steve smiled at that, how his kids were changing their hair for the trip and how Tony would get surprised by it.
“An old homophobic coworker of ours came to visit…apparently got upset when he couldn’t find Steve,” the male paramedic explained as Tony kept his hold on the shaking teen.
“Sounds like someone could use a nap,” Steve said loudly and pointedly, not caring that her cries increased at the prospect. Buck simply glared back at him, hands on his hips before he responded back.
“May I have this dance?” the blonde asked, hand extended. Tony didn’t even look at Bruce, though he felt his gentle nudge, before grabbing Steve’s hand and following him. The timing was damn near perfect, as at that moment the music switched to a slow, love song.
“We should go, I promised Emerson she could help me make breakfast.” Steve sat up and got off the bed, righting his clothes as Tony stared at him. “Whatever you say…Pops,” Tony replied while wiggling his eyebrows. Steve rolled his eyes before leaning down to steal one more kiss from the brunette. “Come on, our kid is waiting,” Steve said while helping the brunette detangle from the bed.
“Love you Em,” the blonde called after her. He smiled at her “love ya too” she offered without turning back to them. He finally turned to his husband whose arms were still crossed as he smiled at their kid walking away.
“I still don’t,” the blonde answered truthfully, earning more laughs from the brunette. “But what I do know is I choose you, Tony. And there isn’t a single person I would rather have on my team than you. I came here because I need you to understand that. That my friendship with Bucky will never, ever, come in between me and the most important man in my life. The man I love,” he took this opportunity to grab the hand of his best friend. “If you wanted me to, Tony, I would cut off all ties with my past. For you. I’d stop talking to Bucky, I’d quit the Avengers, I would denounce the ‘27 Yankees if it meant having you in my life, by my side, for all of eternity.” He released his hand and pushed the ball closer to the speechless genius.
“Never mind, can we just…go kind of slow?” Steve asked, not letting his hands move from the man’s body. Tony’s demeanor suddenly changed, his brows furrowed with concern as he cocked his head to the side.
The brunette looked down at their girl, who was awake but looked too upset to talk. So he turned back to the blonde, who smiled back tiredly at the man.
“Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb,” she dragged out as she also added some tiny feet stomping. Steve turned to his brother. Bucky had his brows furrowed, not buying her act for a minute.
“Okay, well I ought to go tell him goodnight.” He began making his way out of the kitchen to his son’s room, pausing to look back at the smiling teen. “Goodnight, Emerson.”
She knew this was a possibility, of course, seeing him again. Thought it was a small possibility after the name change, new identity and superheroes as fathers. But then again, the universe never really seemed to be on her side.
“Yeah, I think so. When’d you know?” she asked, turning to curl up and face him. He had to think about that, wondering if he should tell her the whole truth to that story.
“-woah, woah! I would never meddle in your marriage. Just observe from the outside and call you things like ‘dumbass’ and ‘man-child.’” Tony only glared at Rhodey as he heard the sounds of his family greeting each other, following his friend who led the way back to the living room.
“That’s right bambino. One of your punk classmates used their premature Voice on you. Stevie here brought you back to me,” Tony said with a smile, rubbing his pup’s back and feeling nothing but love in that moment. The Omega went so far as to pull his feet up on the couch, one hand rubbing Harley’s back and while the other rubbed his swollen tummy, all while leaning into his Alpha’s side.
“If you can’t sleep, I can play a movie or something. Or we can talk, or just sit here quietly,” he offered as she began playing with the covers. She thought about his offer as she sat silently, before shooting a smile at him. When they heard footsteps walking down the hall, he raised his brows at her and grinned at the teen – who held her breath as they both looked at the door.
“Well jeez, Rogers, don’t sound so desperate,” Tony muttered, desperately trying to save face. The blonde saw right through him, a warm smile on his face.
She could only find cranberry cocktail and that was basically just sugar. She really really didn't want to interrupt their love fest and ask, but so far her only help had come from the AI - and Jarvis' suggestion was to check the kitchen.
He approached her quickly, which startled the teen enough to jump back, even when he raised his hands up in surrender.
“There’s already no contact orders, restraining orders, and she’s got the Avengers on her side if need be. Don’t stress over this, Bambi.” Tony rubbed his hand along Peter’s arm.
“Nat!” the man whined again as the redhead put a pillow on the coffee table before yanking one of his legs to prop up on said pillow. His left foot was wrapped in a brace of some kind as it sat elevated.
. He needed to let Bucky go in that aspect. Pull him off the ‘perfect dad pedestal’ to give Steve the chance to be her father figure. He’d never replace Bucky as her real dad…but he needed to stop with the uncle/authoritative guardian shtick.
"No, your family has been planning this for months. I told you before there was a possibility that I couldn't go," Wade retorted as he hastily threw clothes in the black suitcase he took everywhere.
Not that he wasn’t great in the beginning; his boyish charm and rugged good looks made Tony an instant gonner. He just remembers how he had been a little…inexperienced.
“Exhausted from parenting, are we?” he teased with a quirked brow. His love simply growled in response, which got another chuckle from the brunette.
“Yeah...there’s this blonde…” the brunette said with a small smile that immediately piqued Steve’s interest.
“Hey, sorry we’re late! We’re here we’re here!” Clint shouted, interrupting his train of thought as he and his family rushed into the waiting room.
“I’m not sure, Harley. But whatever happens, I’m here and I will always protect you.” He wasn’t sure if it was the right thing to say, but he smiled when the pup’s head rested on top of his own.
Those words, sincere and heartfelt, broke the dam she spent fifteen years building. The well of emotions overtook her as her body began to shake from the sobbing. As she curled in on herself, she couldn’t help the flinch her body threw at Steve’s attempt at physical comfort. With the second attempt of placing his hands in hers, she allowed it, screwing here eyes tight as she felt Tony grab her other hand. Even in her fragile state, she recognized they were respecting her boundaries, feeling some small warmth in her chest knowing they weren’t trying to force her to do anything.
But the pup got his stubbornness from Tony, who lifted an eyebrow and stared back until the pup caved first and looked down at his plate. The Omega looked over to his Alpha, who was quiet and contemplative during their talk, now looking sad and small.
And then Steve entered, eyes furrowed at the sight before him. He was in his uniform, one hand on the handle as he slowly shut the door behind him.
“Fair enough. I accept your apology. But I still want to apologize to you for being insensitive. I just…it kills me to see you in such pain,” he said with his eyes downcast.
She did suddenly find herself laughing, however, when she heard Steve chastise his husband for the unhealthy proposal.
“Sweet! Thanks Pops,” she said smiling at him. She stood for a moment later, obviously waiting for Steve’s reaction. Remembering Tony’s words, he simply smiled back and replied, “of course, baby girl,” before turning back to his drawing.
“Because,” he started, not stopping to see if Steve was following them, “you could use that time to cool off and seriously think things over.” The blonde tried to not look offended as he quickly caught up to them and begrudgingly got in the backseat behind Joey.
"Make a wish, baby girl," he added, arms still wrapped around his husband. She smiled at him before closing her eyes and blowing out the candles, immediately followed by cheers from the large group.
He woke from the sound of his son slamming their door open, blinking at the boy screaming good morning to them.
“Daci? Want some help doing a handstand?” he asked the girl as Peter started walking on his hands, still being assisted by his uncle. When he looked back toward the girl, he burst out a laugh seeing the look on her face.
“Unca Bucky!” Harley cried in excitement, wiggle down from Thor before toddling over to her father, who sighed heavily before obliging the toddler and lifting him up into his arms.
Can faces turn purple from embarrassment? Because mine has got to be so far beyond red. Peter was frozen, possibly from shock. Did I really just say those words out loud? He thought, angry at himself for continuing the awkward silence between the two.
“Yes,” Kimberly responded quickly. “I put the address of the cemetery in the folder. Your father he uh…didn’t want to pay for a funeral, just the hole in the ground. She doesn’t have a proper tombstone, but she has a wooden cross and she’s buried next to my mother.” Emerson carefully brought the folder to her chest, cradling it preciously with both arms.
“Right, well, I’m off for a run,” Steve said in a clipped tone. “I need you back to watch the boys by noon, Morgan’s got a doctor’s appointment at twelve thirty to update her shots.” Tony mumbled what he thought was a confirmation, but he was drifting off to sleep, barely hearing Steve ask JARVIS to remind him of the appointment.
“Seriously? You need to grow the fuck up, man. Not my fault you’re too chicken shit to leave the closet-” he stopped talking to dodge a punch from Brock, which was especially easy considering how drunk the other teen was.
“Peter, I don’t think I used those words…” Steve began. “But yeah, I do brag about you a lot. Apparently,” the blonde said pointedly to the boy, hands moving to his hips in mock anger. The boy giggled in response while Joey found herself smiling as warmth filled her chest.
“My name’s Tiberius Stone. Been on and off with Tony since we were sixteen? The true love of his life?” the stranger said as he puffed his chest out.
“I need to apologize for what happened and…everything else,” she said sincerely to Joey after sitting across from her at the small table.
is ready to talk about it. That might take time, and I’m not saying that won’t suck. But if you love this boy, and I think you do, you’ll just need to be patient.”
She smiled again at her Pop’s words. “No to both. I don’t want to think about him. I just want to hear your voices.”
“Everything okay?” Steve asked after a moment, shifting on his feet at the feeling of still wearing his uniform - but wanting to be there for his friend if he needed to talk about anything. Getting Bucky to talk was like pulling teeth, so if he was willing to talk Steve would seize the opportunity.
The archer was a much better man than Bucky and at the very least deserved an apology. Buck cleared his throat awkwardly when he made his way to the pilot’s chair, frowning at the flinch coming from the archer.
"You...wait...you like me?" she asked, biting her bottom lip as hot, unwanted tears dripped down her face. Dark chocolate eyes looked back up at her green ones, growing watery as she nodded her head in response.
He closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths, clenching and unclenching his fists as he heard the sound of the back door open. He listened as his boyfriend moved to stand next to him, his gentle hand grabbing the blonde’s clenched fist until Clint relaxed and returned the hold.
"Whatcha drawing, Picasney?" came the voice rough with sleep. Steve smiled at his brother before turning the picture around for him to see. Bucky hummed in approval before glancing back down at his daughter with a smile on his face. "How was school today, punk?" his brother asked as he carefully stretched out below the still sleeping baby girl.
“Peter do you know what ‘privileged’ means?” he asked the boy. Peter shook his head with confused eyes.
“You think that’s bad you should hear him snore,” Tony quipped, somehow still looking sexy even as JARVIS mechanically helped him remove his the last of his suit.
“Well, I mean technically yes. But he got cleared so now it isn’t...unless of course Fury somehow found out they dated before that...but I don’t know kiddo why don’t we watch some cartoons or something?” Clint responded, using one hand to fumble for the television remote.
“You know da Hulk?” she asked adorably, staying near Peter and still looking a little skeptical at the other three.
He found himself thinking about Lacy again, and how much this little girl deserved a mom. Also had him thinking, not for the first time, that he would probably never have kids.
Tony found himself smiling when the man tightened his arms around him, still just watching in silence.
Not only did they shower him with love and gifts on Christmas, but they genuinely seemed to like Clint and enjoy his company. It was still weird to get used to.
“Hey, so…I don’t think either of your dads are dying.” Joey practically had whip lash turning back so quickly to him.
Normally when Wade came home after a long trip, he'd immediately jump the spider's pants. Usually he'd barely get a chance to say hello before the man tackled him in love. Today he just gave him a kiss, before quickly calling his future father-in-law upon hearing the news.
Their friends were happy for them, even if some thought it was a little soon. But once everyone had found out about the soulbond and Steve’s childhood sickness, they all got excited with them.
He wished he could’ve laid there longer and not interrupted the scene that made his heart melt, but the serum never let him sit still for that long. He carefully lifted Em’s head as he slid his way out, surprised when she didn’t wake up or even stir when he placed her head under a pillow. He took another moment to look at his family before moving to use the restroom. When he opened the door again to the bedroom, he smiled again to see his family hadn’t moved.
It was funny. Clint had sworn to himself a long time ago he’d never have kids. But this whole situation felt weirdly intimate and domestic, something Clint only assumed happened in Hallmark movies.
“Of course honey, just don’t feel obligated because of your ridiculous father,” his Pop chided at the man before he went back in their pantry to grab more ketchup.
“Story Steeb?” she asked as she rubbed her eyes with her tiny fists. He looked back at his brother who was giving him his own pleading look, huffing before finally relenting.
“Um…well. May called cause she got a promotion which will require a lot of traveling so…the next three months?” he answered apprehensively. Steve’s face morphed into a surprised-excited combo, Tony still unsure how he actually felt about the news.
“I don’t know what I want,” she answered honestly. Past shrinks have either told her what was wrong or spent the whole time being condescending to her.
“Alright, let’s set some ground rules, cause neither of you bums are puking in the jeep,” Bucky started as he parked among the rows of cars. “When I say we’re leaving, we’re leaving, deal?” he asked the two, though he was directing his gaze at the stubborn blonde.
