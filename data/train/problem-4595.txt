isn’t in this body anymore. “It was before we claimed each other, too, but it’s like my well-being is tied to yours now. I couldn’t be okay if you weren’t okay.”
He stands up and pulls Jack into a tight hug, so glad that they get to have this. Fuck what Jack said about being in the raindrops or whatever – there’s no way they’re going to let the kid stay away for too long. His eyes meet Dean’s over the top of Jack’s head and they come to a silent agreement on that.
“You can tell me, you know. If he’s... whatever.” She was clearly attempting to come off nonchalant, shrugging as she turned away to pick up the towel and plate again like she didn’t care about the answer one way or another, but Dean saw it for what it was. She was worried. “I mean, it’s not like he’s actually my family or anything.”
He’d tried not to get his hopes up, truly, but the words struck like a physical blow nonetheless. God fucking damnit.
Sam was apparently determined not to be disheartened. “Well, it’s more than we had yesterday. And anyways, I might have a few ideas. I’ll get started looking through the archives, maybe something will turn up.”
"Yeah, well. Wrestling with the Devil is pretty much above and beyond how far most people would be willing to go."
He was still trying to figure out how to respond when she took pity on him. “Fine. Look, I know this is asking a lot, what with you and your macho bullshit -- don’t give me that look, Winchester, I’ve heard plenty of stories -- but just. Be careful with him, okay? He’s more fragile than he looks.”
“I think Dean and I have things to talk about,” Cas tells Jack, but he’s still locked in his staring thing with Dean (and yeah, it’d been weird without it, but now Sam’s not so sure he should’ve been so eager to have it back). “I’ll pray to you tomorrow, and we can figure out how this will work. I… I’d still like to help. But I think… I’d like for my home to be here.”
Alex had helped do the cooking, so Claire was on clean-up duty. Dean hadn’t missed the glances she’d been throwing him all day -- clearly there was something on her mind -- so he decided to bite the bullet and grab the rest of the dirty plates, following her into the small kitchen. “I’ll wash and you dry?” he offered, rolling the sleeves of his shirt up.
“I love you,” Cas says plainly, and it’s enough to stop the laughter. The sudden quiet apparently unnerves him, because he shifts, his smile dropping a bit when he adds, “Just so you’re aware.”
They trudged on, until, in the midst of the whole lot of nothing on the horizon, a figure appeared. He was somewhat plain: olive skin, average height, and a forgettable face, but beside Dean, Cas heaved a heavy sigh of relief. “Thank you for meeting us,” he said as they approached.
“It was that good, was it?” Cas asks, chuckling quietly. Dean huffs out a small laugh himself and wraps his arms around Cas’s waist, letting the familiarity of Castiel’s body soothe his racing heart. “It feels like that every time I kiss you, Dean,” he says, more seriously now. “From the first time I held your face in my hand outside my bedroom door, I felt something inside of me call to you. I don’t know that I could resist it if I wanted to, so I suppose it’s a good thing I don’t want to.”
The first chapter of a brand new fic by me is coming Monday, so keep your eyes peeled, and again, thank you so much for reading 💙
forgiven Cas. As much as it kills him, he’s accepted that he can’t get those two weeks back. He hasn’t forgotten that Cas lied to him, but he’s 100% sure that Cas won’t do it again, not about anything. And like Cas said, at the end of the day, he wants to be with Cas regardless of their shaky start.
Castiel’s smiling brightly when he hands his phone over, feeling sparks shoot up his spine when his fingers brush Dean’s.
He wasn’t planning on it, but he’s also not about to turn him down when he looks so frightened. He squeezes Dean’s hand to reassure him. “Of course I am.”
Mostly because with every day that passes, it becomes more and more clear that he isn’t just physically attracted to Cas. He likes him a lot, too. Each day he comes home from work to see Cas smiling and feeling good about finishing another shift at work makes his heart fill a little more. When Cas talks with pride about mastering the slurpee machine and up-selling lottery tickets, Dean feels proud of him, too. When he swings by to pick Cas up on his first Saturday shift and goes inside to pick up a pack of gum and some jerky just to see him in action, his heart damn near flies out of his chest when he gets a glimpse of Cas in his little blue Gas N Sip vest. And that’s
He might have felt bad about that, except the look on Dean’s face is a new one and not at all remorseful. It’s heated and only partially satisfied but still unbelievably smug, and the punch of lust Castiel feels straight to his gut knowing that
“Oh, I don’t blame yas. Honestly,” she says, starting to pack her things up. “It’s real nice to see the two of you together. I don’t always see next of kin so willing to help.”
That has a genuine laugh spilling out of him before he can stop it because Cas has a good point. Cas is really fucking awful at getting to know people. “You’re right, I totally forgot about that.”
“Roll over so you’re facing away from me.” Castiel follows his instruction and rolls over onto his side. He startles slightly when Dean places his hand on his hip, and he feels Dean exhale a huff of amusement through his nose. “I’m gonna scoot in nice and close, okay?”
Dean’s so handsome when he smiles that Castiel feels like a fish on a line, pulled in for a kiss without even thinking about it, and he’s pleased when Dean’s hand comes up to cup his face and prolongs the seal of their lips for several seconds. Once their lips part, Castiel nuzzles into his palm and takes a slow, deep breath in when Dean guides him down to his neck. Castiel scents him and pulls Dean’s arm around his shoulders so that he can snuggle in, and with Dean’s scent fresh in his nose and Grace hanging out in his lap, he feels at peace for the first time all day.
Dean and Cas join in while they’re asked, and Dean makes a mental note to get the stuff to build the sandbox and buy some outdoor toys so all of his indoor stuff doesn’t get dirty. The last thing he needs is an extra reason for a kid to drag dirt into the house. They stay outside until 7:00 when Donna says it’s time to go home because Liam has to get back to Miss Mosley’s for his last night there.
“Not my entire high school career,” Castiel admits, pulling back to straighten up so they aren’t so close together.
Like that’s what he was waiting for, Cas’s finger breaches his rim and sinks inside of him as deep as it will go. “Fuck,” Cas breathes, wiggling his finger around curiously. “That’s tight.”
Fuck, Tie Guy is good at this. He’s good at looking over at him with his pretty pink lips hanging open like they’re just waiting for something to be shoved between them, so good at maintaining eye contact and making him squirm with the severity of his stare, good enough that Dean feels like an electric current is running from his steady gaze straight to his cock.
“Oh shut up.” He makes sure there’s no heat behind it, and Cas’s smile spreads accordingly. He turns away in a childish attempt to hide his growing blush, and says, “Leave your shoes at the door there so I don’t have to sweep twelve times a day, and then I’ll show you where you can stash your stuff.”
“You’re one to talk,” Cas flirts, gazing at him so softly now it makes the butterflies in his stomach take flight again. “If you keep looking at me like that you’re going to make it a very long seven hours until Liam goes to bed tonight.”
It doesn’t take him long to come to a conclusion now that Dean’s asking the question out loud. “Maybe not in exactly this way, but yes. I still think so. You’re too talented not to get discovered at some point.”
He looks over at Cas for that, who’s now close enough to have his big hand resting on his lower hip. “Really?”
“It was great. Pretty sure mom got drunk on wine, which was hilarious. She even got dad up to dance,” Sam says, grinning. “He’s been in a weirdly good mood ever since...”
“I was gonna say something, but I didn’t want to interrupt you making a claim on Ken Doll,” she smirks.
Thoughts of he and Dean replace the dream he had last week of him and a faceless man sitting out on a porch swing. Now it’s Dean, sitting at his feet with the sun shining behind him, caressing the breathtaking angles of his face with its rays as Dean plays him all the love songs he never bothered to listen to before. He can see it so clearly, how Dean would suddenly get that playful smile on his face and tug him to his feet. He remembers exactly how it felt to be pressed up against him, how smoothly the skin on his cheek rubbed his on the dance floor, and it’s so, so easy to imagine how it would feel to have Dean’s arms wrapped around him with his low voice humming 'Simple Man' into his ear while they dance on the porch.
Dean blinks rapidly, trying to clear the mist from his eyes while he’s out of the spotlight. “I am sad,” Cas admits. “It’s okay to be sad, though. It’s okay to miss somebody.”
Dean licks his lips, but nods as well. “Alright, let’s get my ass out there before I change my mind.”
“I guess I’ll go first,” Cas agrees, which makes Dean smile even bigger. He’s obviously excited, and as Cas’s smile spreads and his heart beats a little bit faster, he realizes Dean’s enthusiasm must be contagious. He needs to be careful, though, because Dean tends to go a little overboard on gifts. Thankfully, the size of this one leads him to believe it’s not as bad as it’s been in the past. He tears through the paper and wiggles off the lid, but his mind goes blank when he sees a key fob inside.
Dean smiles much more genuinely then, and Castiel knows in this moment that nobody would ever hold a little white lie against him if they knew it prompted a smile
Castiel nods, and when Dean still doesn’t say anything, he tries to make him less nervous. “I’m sure whatever it is isn’t as bad as you think.”
Castiel snaps his fingers and points a finger at Dean. “I did, and I would have forgotten it if you didn’t say that, so thank you.” He hurries into the kitchen, grabs the lunch that he made and put in the fridge last night, and heads back out towards the front of the house.
“And I hope a lesson about greed has been learned,” his mom says sternly. “One slice is plenty, and I’ll personally make sure you’ll get your blueberry the next time you come by, Cas.”
art show!” Cas confirms. “The first place prize is $3,000 and a personal art show in the summer! Not that I expect to win, but that’s a huge prize!”
—now, yeah, but just as often when they’re not in bed too—he pulls him down for another kiss, desperately needing to cling to that connection.
“Another boy?” She sounded confused when she asked it, but he heard her breath catch a moment later as she got it. “Are you asking me what I think you’re asking me, Dean Michael?”
He keeps what he hopes is a covert eye on Castiel as he gets back into his trench coat and wraps his scarf around his neck again, but just when the bell jingles and he thinks he’s in the clear, Castiel turns back and their eyes meet across the room. He can’t be completely sure from so far away, but it looks like Castiel’s blush deepens. He doesn’t get a chance to linger over that, though, because for some weird reason, Castiel gives him an enthusiastic thumbs up and a cheesy smile that has Dean releasing a bark of laughter.
“Sit, sit, sit,” Charlie demands, ushering them both into seats for the first time in what definitely
His sentence ends on the dirtiest fucking moan Dean’s ever heard, and because Dean was already so unbelievably close even before that, his body moves instinctively to get him what he needs. He lifts his hips to chase the friction, to rub against the hard length of Castiel’s cock, matching the leisurely pace that’s undoing them both as if they were fucking like madmen instead of clumsily fumbling in the dark.
He never really paid any attention to the decor of the office, so for lack of anything else to say, Dean says, “Cool.”
“I couldn’t sleep,” Cas says, like that’s a completely reasonable explanation for waking Dean up in the middle of the night the same way he used to when they were teenagers. “What
He smiles when he sees people RTing and liking it right away, and makes sure to like those, too, hoping that however minimal it may be, his praise towards Dean’s fans for sharing his music will encourage them to share it more. He bursts into laughter when he clicks on lisafranenstn’s page and sees her basically key smashing in response to him RTing her post, and that’s what seems to wake Dean from the dead.
They’re still bickering about that when they find a seat around the rink and sit to put on their skates. Dean finishes first and stands up on his skates in front of Cas. Once Cas is finished, his gaze travels up Dean’s torso as he lifts his head, but his eyes get stuck on the big black letters knit into Dean’s sweater he couldn’t see when Dean was driving.
His eyes fly open when he feels the first tentative touch of something wet and warm at the seam of his lips, but then he realizes that it’s Dean’s tongue and it’s like his veins are lit on fire.
The man’s lips turn up in the corners, like he wants to smile but doesn’t quite remember how, and then he’s going in for more.
“God, Dean. I’m so sorry. I barely even let you in the door before I started weeping all over you. I’m beyond embarrassed. I swear I’m not usually like this.”
when it comes to dating (which probably explains the lack of significant others in his life). He supposes Dean bringing coffee could be a romantic gesture, though it’s also something friends would do for each other. Dean complimented his appearance, too, but again,
“Even I knew that one,” Dean says, catching a quick glimpse of it before Liam runs his hands down the back of it.
how your parents met?” He screws his face up into one of disgust and Cas laughs, then pats his knee once more.
Castiel springs into action, hurrying down the stairs to hold the dust pan for Miss Moseley so she doesn’t have to. “I don’t think we’ve properly met,” he says a minute later, offering his hand for a shake. “I’m Castiel.”
“Fair,” Dean decides. “Are you goin’ into the whole soulmate thing hoping your other half’s the same way? Untouched or whatever? ‘Cause I gotta warn you, I don’t know many other people who would’ve waited as long as you have.”
It’s a struggle to make his body cooperate enough to do it, but he rolls over so they’re face-to-face. Cas looks tired, but he looks scared, too, and even in Dean’s semi-conscious state, he doesn’t want that. He knows it’s sappy, but he smooths Cas’s hair back and tips his chin up so that he can kiss Cas on the forehead.
He tilts his head to the side, hitting Cas with a level look. Because the angel thing is a little weird, yeah, but Castiel should know it doesn’t change anything they have between them. He still loves Castiel’s smile more than anybody else’s, still wants to hear him laugh every single day, and still wants to get to know him better.
“Oh. I’m sorry. That must have been difficult for you.” Dean nods, but doesn’t confirm it in any other way. Sensing this isn’t something Dean likes to talk about, he asks, “So what do you really do?”
Dean glances back towards the living room, only to find Cas looking back. His eyes widen slightly, like he’s surprised to be caught looking, and for a second, he thinks about what Jess said about the lingering looks behind each other’s backs. Cas pushes a hand through his hair, making it look all kinds of sexy and disheveled, then says, “I could go for a drive.”
Cas hadn’t said it and he hadn’t asked, but the rejection had still been enough to prompt his mostly drunk brain into thinking the smart thing to do next was to order another tray of shots. Shot number six soothed the burn and put him right back into Cas’s space, and if he remembers correctly, he got a little hard from the way Cas’s hand ended up snaked under his shirts, resting so low on his back he was almost touching his ass crack.
He introduces Dean to the majority of his co-workers, which also goes well, and just when he’s starting to think he might be lucky enough to miss Zachariah all together, he hears him.
“Shit,” Dean says breathlessly, unable for think of anything more eloquent with the way his head is in the clouds. “You’re making my head spin, Cas.”
Dean hums quietly in response and just keeps filling out the GIC application in front of him. He’s aware of Cas approaching his desk and gathering up the pumpkin and other fall decorations he put out, but he doesn’t look up, and Cas stays eerily silent as he works. It isn’t until he’s finished putting out snow globes, white sparkly felt that he guesses is supposed to look like snow, and a couple of big, fat, smiley snowmen that he finally speaks again. Quietly.
Dean cleared his throat, the story feeling far too uncomfortable and relatable for reasons he pretended not to know. “Is it true? Did it work?”
“Whatever, bitch,” he yelled back, saying ‘thank you’ in the best way he knew how. He owed Sam far more than one.
So Cas has spent time Googling cat videos. Dean can’t even be surprised anymore. It’s ugly as hell, but the way Cas cradles the thing to his chest sparks something deep and warm in his own chest, and he knows they’re going to end up taking the damn thing back to Claire. “All right,” he says, quirking his lips upward, clapping his hand to Cas’s shoulder. He lets it linger for longer than he would usually dare, reveling in the small, fond smile he gets in return. “Let’s get a gift bag and get the hell out of here.”
Then they were alone. Cas was still hovering by the door, and for a few, long moments, the silence reigned. “Hey, Cas,” Dean finally said, breaking it.
Sam’s pretty sure his eyebrows have taken up residence near his hairline. He’s still not sure what’s going on here, what they’re talking around, but Dean openly admitting to being full of shit and using the word ‘posturing’ is a rarity.
Cas has been Grace-less for two months now, but the look he gives Dean is so full of holy righteousness that it’s as if they’ve been transported back to the apocalypse. When he opens his mouth, Dean half expects him to start talking about seals. Instead, what comes out is, “You’re being a
Cas closed the folder and pushed it back Sam’s way. “I don’t know. The theory is sound, and the spell itself looks reliable, but ensuring that it would distort the Mark may be--”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean says, something slow and purposefully patient about his tone, and it’s really not fair that
Dean had apparently missed the moment where they’d gone from hypothetical Grace to Cas’s very real, very toxic burning Grace. “Wait, what?”
It’s not fair to attribute everything to Chuck. All of their successes, all of their failures, all of their growth. No matter what the artist formerly known as God threw their way, it was still theirs to deal with, theirs to live. But maybe there’s something to that after all, and maybe none of their adult lives were
Sam picked up on the second ring. Dean barely had time to take a breath before Sam started in on him. “Dean! How’s it going? You meet Ramiel yet? Did you find anything?”
Their trip to Heaven felt like it had taken at least the better part of a day, but once the two of them stumbled from the playground back to the car, Dean’s phone read just after midnight. “I’ll call Sam,” Dean said as he slid onto the seat and started the ignition. “Why don’t you get comfy, get a few hours.” He resisted adding the obvious, ‘You look like you’re about to keel over.’
Cas’s smile was wry and fond. “No,” he said, though there was no regret coloring his tone, “I suppose not.”
choice for the job. And it hurts, but if this is Cas’s happy ending, who is Sam to stand in the way?
Cas’s outstretched hand wavers just a little bit before he slowly withdraws it, cradling the mug to his own chest. “If I’m overstaying my welcome--“ he starts, words careful and hesitant.
On paper, that’s nothing new: they’ve spent most of their lives on this bench seat, driving from when the sky’s grey and not fully light yet well into the stretches of night that feel endless. Many of those drives have been done with only a handful of words exchanged. But the quiet is rarely ever
“So this was a waste of a trip, that’s what you’re saying?” He’d been trying his hardest to stay calm; the last thing they could afford was for him to go off in a fit of rage, Mark-fuelled or otherwise, but that was turning out to be easier said than done. They’d wasted their time and, more importantly, wasted Cas’s ever-dwindling time and Grace, for nothing.
Sure enough, Dean almost jumps, eyes darting to Sam and then to Jack and then back at Sam for another beat, and the flush strengthens. But stronger is the set of his jaw, and even if Sam’s still a little lost, he knows that look on his brother’s face. “So. It’s… you could stay. If you wanted.”
“Have I done something, then?” He still sounds confused, but less so, like he’s starting to suspect there’s more to it than Dean just being frustrated with something he did.
“Sam?” Cas’s voice came from the doorway. “Is everything all right? I thought I heard…” He trailed off as he came into the room, clearly catching sight of the two of them, awake and both grinning like morons. He looked a million times better, eyes more alert, skin healthier, the confusion quickly dropping from his face to be replaced with a hesitant smile.
“I’m always careful,” Dean said with a smirk, then turned around and walked past Cas through the door to the dungeon before he could think better of it. He inhaled sharply, ignoring the prickle at the corner of his eyes as he forced himself to focus on the devil’s trap painted onto the floor. He didn’t look up as dark shoes came into view a few moments later. “Just promise me one thing,” he said to Cas’s feet, voice gruff.
“Google says it’s a popular store amongst teenagers,” Cas says gravely as they walk in, and nods to the bored-looking girl behind the counter.
Dean tried to catch Cas’s gaze, but Cas refused to meet his eyes, his line of sight instead flicking to somewhere behind Dean’s shoulder. When he turned, Dean saw himself walking back to the table, a plate in each hand. “Alright,” his memory-self said as he sat down, setting one plate down in front of an empty seat and the other in front of him. He peered over at the empty seat -- where Cas had been sitting that day, Dean suddenly realized -- and began chattering away through mouthfuls of his burger.
“No time like the present?” Sam said, a bit of anxiety evident despite the awkward smile on his face.
Between trying to be as open as possible (for him, at least) about the Mark and Amara, and then trying to work things out with Mary, the last few years have seen some major improvements in terms of talking about his feelings. But with Cas, it’s always been that much harder. There’ve always been so many layers of things that are impossible to touch, and trying to navigate real, open conversation around them has always felt a little bit like a game of Battleship. But something’s gotta give, and Dean’s starting to realize that if it’s not his aversion to talking about his feelings, sooner or later it’ll be Cas. And maybe in some ways that’d be easier (hard and miserable as fuck, sure, but easier, perhaps, than the alternative), but Dean’s starting to realize that, if nothing else, he owes it to the both of them to try. He takes a deep breath and lets go of Cas’s sweatshirt, swiping a surprisingly steady hand across his eyes. “No, you’re right.”
Cas just pursed his lips. “You’re right,” he said on an exhale, turning to stare out the front window. “It’s burning up again. I thought I would have more time, but the decay… it’s much faster this time.”
And Dean knew he should press, should piggyback off of Sam’s concern and get at the truth, but he’d never been good at… this. He couldn’t sit and listen as Cas laid down yet another problem, couldn’t let himself give into the worry and concern gnawing at him. So instead, he inhaled noisily, reached for his half-empty beer bottle, and said, “Good.” He steadfastly ignored the bitch face Sam threw at him. “So where do we find this Ramiel guy?”
“Yes?” Cas asks idly, and fuck, he’s already reaching for the door handle. Whatever hopes Dean had that he’d somehow taken a wrong turn are rapidly disappearing.
“Yes.” If Ramiel could tell Dean was pissed, he didn’t react. “It is the same thing that happened to Cain.”
Cas swayed a bit, but remained firmly human-looking. “It’s… requiring more effort than I had anticipated, taking us both here.”
Dean's not laughing. He certainly feels like he's missing a punchline when Cas leans in, too bright and too sure, and Dean crumbles. Their lips are so close that he's almost afraid to breathe, as though even that small act would finally cross the line.
Now Dean looks up, something close to confusion on his face. And that’s even sadder than Sam gave him credit for. Is the idea of a happy ending that much beyond comprehension?
“What’s that supposed to mean?” He can’t tell whether he was more uncomfortable by the insinuation or the nagging feeling that Claire might be more right than he’d like to admit.
Yeah, that’s reassuring. He’s not exactly chomping at the bit to get back to Sam and Claire, but he doesn’t really want to spend the next three hours in here watching as Cas lolls from one end of the store to the other, either. “Cas, man, come on. Are you sure even getting her a gift is a good idea?” He’s tempted to bring up the whole ‘you’re not her dad,’ thing again, for all the good it’ll do.
“I...” How was he even supposed to answer that? He didn’t want to worry her, not when there was no reason to, but he was fairly certain that if he tried to tell her everything was fine, it would come out sounding like a lie. “I saw him like a week ago, texted him a few days after that. He looked fine, if that helps.”
Cas’s shoulders slump, and he looks down at the table once more. There’s something awful on his face, something broken and so human that it hurts to look at for more than a moment, and Sam tears his gaze away. “I didn’t have to.”
Sam shifted a bit, his smile fading. “We’d need Grace. Which is why it was scrapped, I guess, since there weren’t any angels running around then.” His eyes panned over to Cas. “Would it work?” he asked, voice softer than it’d been.
For as long as they’ve known Cas, he’s been so full of guilt. He’s been forced to make difficult choice after difficult choice, and it’s led to a lot of pain, and a lot of destruction up in Heaven. He’s actively torn down his home, killed fellow angel after fellow angel in the name of free will and doing the right thing. For him to now have the chance to go up and fix it? To take the time he’s spent on Earth, the understanding and love and appreciation he’s come to have for people, the absolutely unique point of view he’s had as being both an angel and one of humanity’s staunchest defenders, and pour it into Heaven? To make paradise as it should have been, in the way that even their former God failed to do? To stand beside Jack, who he’d defended from the first, who he’d passed on all his lessons of hope and compassion to? Yeah, Cas is the
“Cas, hey.” Dean had a hand on Cas’s back before he could give it a second thought, rubbing between his shoulders like he’d done so many times for Sam. A second later his brain caught up with his body and he felt his whole body freeze. He was already on edge from the location and the previous conversation, and the sudden proximity wasn’t helping to clear his head any. Despite this, he deliberately kept his hand where it was, swallowing his cowardice out of concern. “You okay?”
The short but satisfying encounter with Ronny or whatever the hell the dude’s name was at the bar was enough to keep him from lashing out, but his veins are still thrumming with a low-key discontent. If Cas is just fucking around with emojis or whatever the hell he does in his spare time, Dean’s going to kill him. He’s about to demand some freaking answers when Cas finally looks up and over at him, the glow from the screen illuminating what is very clearly Cas’s “mission” face. This can’t be good.
Dean sighed. “Look, he had a rough day a while back.” He didn’t elaborate that the ‘rough day’ involved the literal devil and God’s evil sister. “It shook all of us up. But I’m sure he’s fine. He’s always fine.”
That sounded promising. Dean slid the file to Cas, who picked it up and immediately began rustling through it.
It isn’t until they’re home, uncapping two bottles of beer in an unspoken, bittersweet, fucking sham of a toast that Sam exhales, finally feeling something settle beneath his ribs. It’s still there, and he has a feeling it’ll be there for far, far too long, but he can inhale without feeling like he’s going to vomit, and when he clears his throat, he finds he can speak. “It’s pretty quiet.”
In the end it comes down to Jack. Jack, wonderful, inhuman Jack who even stands differently now, appears in the war room and sends a stack of books flying. Sam’s running on probably ten hours of sleep total over the past four days, and judging by the collection of dirty cups and filters full of used coffee grounds that’ve appeared in every nook and cranny, Dean’s had even less. But when Jack beams at them and says, “I think I figured it out,” all three of them are like live wires, and preparations have never seemed easier.
Cas sighed and shook his head. “The only person who knows why Crowley does anything is Crowley himself.” There was a beat of silence, and then Cas continued, voice quiet, but firm as he added, “And no. I won’t kill another angel to give me more time.”
Cas grumbled something uncharitable under his breath, but turned over and curled up against the window without any further complaints. Unsurprisingly, he fell asleep in under a minute, a tiny patch of fog appearing on the window with every deep, even breath.
He hates to admit it, but Sammy was right. He had no idea how perfect it would feel to be with the one person he’s meant to be with. It’s unlike anything he’s ever felt before, and he doesn’t really know Cas that well yet. He can hardly even imagine how amazing it will be when they know each other as well as Sam and Jess do, and right now, in this moment, he’s so fucking glad he listened to his brother and gave their relationship another shot.
he is. He’s in the wedding, too. It’s just weird that Sam and Jess never mentioned Cas at all, and there was a text chain of what felt like a thousand messages picking a time that worked for them all.
He doesn’t want to cry, but the weight of his regret is staggering, and he can hardly stay standing let alone keep his emotions at bay. The first and second tears fall rapidly, one after another, but he ignores them because he knows he has another dozen apologies to give. “I’m so sorry. I’m so, so sorry.”
His mom squeezes his hand briefly, Sam claps his back once more, and then he’s left alone in his bedroom for the last time as an unmarried man. Hell, this will be the last time this is just his bedroom. By the time they come back here later tonight, all of Castiel’s things will be here, too. The thought warms him, and it reminds him of why his family and friends are willing to risk it all to make sure this wedding happens. Because he’s in love with Cas.
fit perfectly, with his arms on Dean’s strong chest, his shoulder tucked under Dean’s arm, Dean’s cheek pillowed on the top of his head.
Cas’s voice is soft and genuine, and one look at him proves his expression is exactly the same. “Anytime,” Dean says, hoping he sounds just as genuine.
Dean’s eyes go a little wide and his mouth actually pops open when he first gets a glimpse of Castiel. Castiel reconsiders going to hide under the bed, but before he can even say hello, Dean’s toeing off his shoes and reaching out to ask wordlessly if he can take Grace from Castiel’s arms. Castiel hands her over, and when he realizes it’s the first time he’s been able to put Grace down for more than two minutes since 12:30 in the morning, all he can do is bury his face in his hands as his shoulders start to shake with his sobs.
Dean doesn’t even get a chance to start talking before Cas is ripping the principal a new one, his anger rightfully redirected. “Are you seriously about to tell me we have to take our son home after he defended himself from a bully?”
He watches hungrily as Cas’s teeth dig into his plush bottom lip, only inches away from Dean’s as he rises and drops again, expelling a long breath he feels on his face. “Jesus fuck you’re big,” Cas sighs. He starts a rhythm of bouncing in short, fast little movements, using only his thighs to propel each one, and Dean’s fucking mesmerized.
Thankfully the little guy is eager, and just like in the hospital, it works out much easier than even the nurses anticipated, and he latches easily. It’s such a strange sensation that it leaves him a little tense at first, but once Hunter settles with his blue eyes closing and his little jaw moving as he sucks and swallows down whatever he manages to get out of him, Dean relaxes too.
with the look on her face, and he huffs a little for show. “Guess I’m going for a drive.” He softens the expression on his face and leans in to kiss his mom on top of the head. “Thanks, ma.”
to work in a scrapyard for the rest of my life?” Dean asks back. “I wanna be a mechanic and restore classic cars like Baby, but there aren’t enough hours in the day to go to school and work full-time, and if I wasn’t working full-time, I wouldn’t be able to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. I didn’t have a choice. That’s the kind of shit parents are supposed to help you with, except apparently the only parent I have left just stole every cent I’ve ever saved.”
something that should be completely platonic but instead was often used as a term of endearment when they were together—rubs him the wrong way. He thought he could handle this. He thought he could handle being in a room with Dean again now that they’ve been broken up for a year, but he’s been here five minutes and it’s already so much harder than he thought it would be.
“He’s okay,” Dean says to Cas. He can see that Sam is watching eagerly, and he gets what he was more than likely hoping for when Liam comes over to stand next to him.
“I think I had better do it seeing as you’re not even of age,” Castiel says, reaching for the bottle.
When the next day rolls around, Dean’s feeling better about his impending fate. Honestly, he’s starting to feel like he might have been a little dramatic about the whole thing, but his saving grace is that he got his shit together around dinner and managed to catch his mom to say goodbye before she left. He asked if she was still okay to go with how things were between her and his dad, and she assured him that she could handle herself, and added in a whisper that maybe the time alone would give her a chance to talk some sense into his father’s head.
your husband.” He opens his hand and shows off the simple white gold band in his palm. “Marry me, Cas.”
He feels Dean’s lips plant a chaste kiss on his neck, making goosebumps pop up along his skin as Dean says, “Ain’t got nothin’ on you, sweetheart.”
The sound Cas lets out is something close to what he imagines a dying animal might sound like, but because it’s
“Feels incredible,” Dean admits, his voice quivering with the effort it’s taking his body to stay still. The sensation of three fingers inside of him is
that’s it for these two, but make sure to subscribe to the series just in case I decide to add to it down the road.
Well, except maybe that adorably geeky thumbs-up and the possible blush on Castiel’s face after their eyes locked...
Castiel smiles softly before bringing their lips together again until the tension he didn’t realize he was holding in his shoulders and spine relaxes under Castiel’s gentle ministrations. Only then does Castiel move things along, and his heart soars when Castiel peppers sweet, gentle little kisses to his cheeks, his forehead, and that sensitive little spot behind his ear that always turns him to mush.
“You want my knot, Castiel?” Dean asks him, voice low and incredibly sexy as he pulls out and does it again.
It’s kinda awkward to roll out of bed buck naked just to brush his teeth, but he’d do a hell of a lot more to kiss Cas in the light of day knowing that they’re into each other. He’s wanted this for so damn long that a part of him feels like he’s going to wake up and find out everything since they got here yesterday was just a dream.
into tears. Big, fat alligator tears stream down his face and drip off his chin before Castiel can so much undo his seat belt. By the time he gets his seat belt undone and scoots over in time to pull Dean into a hug, Dean has snot leaking from his nose, his shoulders are shaking, and he’s legitimately sobbing.
about Cas. He can’t imagine a better way to start the day, and knowing that he and Cas are going to get married tomorrow and that this could be the new normal certainly has a spring in his step by the time he’s getting dressed.
Without thinking, he reaches for his wrist and turns the dial like Benny showed him, changing his bracelet to orange.
He wraps his arms around him, clinging to Cas for everything he’s worth, knowing without a shadow of a doubt that Cas has him. That Cas will always have him, not only because Cas is meant to be his other half, but because of who Cas is. One of the most loving, understanding, supportive people he’s ever met, who he knows he can lean on now and forever.
Cas’s blue eyes flash icy hot, but then Cas has his face in his giant hands, pulling him up to slam their mouths together. Cas licks into his mouth and sucks on his tongue just right, so fucking dirty it has him rutting his cock into the side of the mattress just for some friction and moaning into his mouth when he finally gets it.
“If you want it so bad, why don’t you get your incredibly talented hand out of my pants and go present for me?”
For both of them. He wonders what high school would have been like with a friend like Charlie? With a boyfriend? Would he still be here, now, if he had gone out with Dean back then?
Dean grabs two and pops the tops off, then turns back to him. “Wanna move into the living room?” Cas agrees by pushing his seat back and following him to the couch. “The best seat in the house is my recliner, if you want it,” Dean offers.
Dean snorts a bitter laugh and tries not to get distracted by how carelessly hot Cas looks smoking. “Yeah, that.”
And before Dean can even begin to process how unbelievably gratifying that is to hear, Castiel kisses him again, stealing his breath with the sheer amount of tenderness between them. The unique, masculine scent of Castiel swirls in his nostrils when he inhales, and as Castiel sweeps his tongue into Dean’s mouth, Dean tastes the fruity wine upon it and groans against Castiel’s plush lips as he gives himself over to the older man. There’s just something about the way Cas kisses him that has him sinking into it every single time, his mind going blank and his body going lax, and it’s so toe-curlingly good that all he can possibly do is take it, cherish it, and silently wish that this never ends.
for the gentle press of Dean’s nose to his scent gland when the phone rings and snaps him out of it.
That gets the three of them started on another animated conversation, and Dean realizes he needs to spend some time at the bookstore so he knows who the hell everybody’s talking about. Cas must realize that he feels left out, because he brings the conversation around to Netflix, and they start talking about You instead. Thinking about watching that with Cas lifts his spirits, and things go back to normal between the four of them until Sam brings the spinach dip out for everybody to mow down on.
in jeans and an old t-shirt that Cas still can’t keep his eyes from giving him a once-over even after a whole year together.
brought up at dinner after not seeing each other for five years, and when Cas laughs along with him, their laughter carries on for several seconds, leaving him feeling lighter and more relaxed than ever by the time it trails off. “Nice to hear I left an impression.”
“I—I didn’t mean for it to come out like that,” Dean admits, slowing down enough to take a breath. “I’m just freaking out a little here.” Sex before marriage isn’t as taboo as it once was, but for royalty, it’s almost unheard of. How else to protect the royal bloodline but to keep the royalty untouched, after all? His stomach twists with unwelcome jealousy at the thought of the body that was pressed against his this morning being that close with anybody else. “Are you a virgin?” Dean repeats, more calmly this time. “I don’t care either way,” he lies, “but if we’re going to get married and try to be together... like that... then I think I have a right to know.”
It’s actively happened now, he literally saw it with his own two eyes, and Dean still can’t believe it.
Happiness fills him like air in a balloon, and the smile that spreads on his face is entirely genuine and full of hope. “That’d be awesome.”
“Obviously I have some, but we haven’t spoken in years. Last I heard they were somewhere in Europe, still scandalized that their only son is attracted to men and women.”
thought Cas was going to do it!—and when Cas starts mouthing at that spot on his earlobe he’s learned does
Dean laughs but pushes him towards the wall as they round the corner, and when Cas trips slightly over his own feet and falls against it, Dean’s about to apologize when Cas makes a mad dash towards him.
Dean doesn’t bother trying to suppress his quiet chuckle, but he does say, “That’s cute.” Cas pins him with a decidedly unimpressed look, but unfortunately for him, he doesn’t look any less adorable even when acting grumpy. “The constipated look kinda works for you, doc.”
Dean’s on his hands and knees, sweat rolling down his back with his body aching from head to toe. He’s
“She was an absolute gem. We stuck to your schedule, so she won’t need to eat again until around 7, which should give you enough time to make yourself something for dinner before then.”
Cas’s eyelids flutter closed and he can literally see his blush as it starts to creep down his neck and onto his chest. “Enthusiastic,” he croaks. Dean grins, remembering himself answering the same way about staying over here tonight.
“Holy shit,” Dean grunts, but he holds Cas’s weight and hugs him back even though Dean has no idea what the hug is for. “What’s happening? Are you okay?”
Dean shucks his coat, empties his pockets, and now down to a tight white v-neck t-shirt and skinny jeans, he follows the guy through a metal detector kinda like he’s been through at the airport. Once he gets the all-clear, Benny gives him a surprisingly soft smile and says, “Have fun, brother. Got a feelin’ you’ll find exactly what you’re lookin’ for here.”
“No,” Castiel disagrees, his heart squeezing painfully when he realizes that’s what Dean thought all this time. “It was never that I felt pressured or uncomfortable with you, Dean. I’m sorry I made you think that. That was just the agreement we made at first, remember? Dating and spending time together in a public setting so we could keep it casual.”
“Like that, Cas?” Dean whispers, remembering perfectly well the way he liked it in the shower not too long ago.
“If I have to keep sending my men there to defend the Angels, that means I have to keep training more and more here. We both know that Bobby is already overrun because of the extra work. We need to hire more people to do the training, and that’s going to cost money we don’t have. The agreed upon sum of money from the Angels will provide us with more than we need—more than this kingdom has ever had—and uniting our kingdom with the Angels will give us a position of power that’s more than I’ll ever be able to offer my people without it.”
“Once I heard that beast of a car start up this morning, I posted in the Nextdoor App, and everybody came out to hang up their flags,” Ellen says. “A few more will go up over the next little while from folks who weren’t home, but this was one hell of a turn out for a twenty minute warning.”
his head spinning and his lungs burning, fireworks exploding behind his eyes and along more nerve endings than he’s ever been aware of until right now
Castiel can’t help the way his eyes mist over or the breathless huff of laughter that escapes him at the memory. “You were so beautiful, all flushed from alcohol and all the dancing. I never imagined your heart would be even more beautiful than your face.”
“That’s why I’m doing it,” Cas lies, and Dean laughs quietly. Cas sits up suddenly, looking every bit like there should be a little cartoon light bulb lighting up over his head. “We should post that Taylor Swift video.”
“Alright, cool,” Dean says awkwardly. He feels kinda bad about it, but it’s not as if he can pay her back, so he lets it go and crouches down to get Liam’s attention away from where he’s talking a mile a minute to another little kid. “Hey big guy, I’m goin’ to work.” He doesn’t have to ask for a hug, Liam just looks over and throws himself at him.
“We’re idiots,” Cas laughs, pushing Dean’s boxers down. Feeling damn near giddy at the idea of Cas fucking him, he agrees with a laugh of his own. “In more ways than one.”
“It’s nothing.” Cas brushes him off with a lazy wave of his hand. “But I was craving a little bit of extra comfort today and it’s a cold day, so I thought it would work.”
Dean sees Cas’s eyes widen in disbelief before he even responds. “Well, I don’t know about that,” he says dubiously. “But we were managing pretty well until last night.”
but it’s intense as Dean splits him wide open and doesn’t stop until every inch of his thick length is buried all the way inside and his heavy balls are resting snugly against Castiel’s skin.
He doesn’t have to ask twice. Cas envelopes his cock with wet heat, and as Cas screws his lips down further and further on Dean’s length, Dean pushes his fingers through the wild locks on top of Cas’s head. He doesn’t try to guide him, just holds on as he watches Cas’s cheeks cave in when he starts to suck.
have been glaring at them for staring, and yeah, he might have let out a small grunt of frustration at their lack of manners, but
He aims a smile over his shoulder. “No, I just can’t believe I work a few blocks from here and I never noticed there was a restaurant on the roof.”
on board with Liam getting to know his dad. He can barely even force himself to think this way, but if there’s a silver lining here at all, it’s gotta be that.
feel the same way?” Dean’s heart swells so fast it aches. If Cas loved him back... he’d have everything he ever wanted. “You’ll never know if you don’t tell him.”
Cas says, his voice strained. He wraps his massive hand around the pair of them and the sight alone is nearly enough to send Dean over the edge then and there. “Is this okay?”
Castiel leans in to press their lips together gently. “I don’t want to be the kind of man who tells another what is okay or not okay to do with their own body, even if it may go against what society expects from us. If you’re comfortable and sure with what just happened between us—”
Even though they’ve barely gotten started and he’s only felt the sublime friction of Dean’s lips sliding up and down his cock a few times, he knows just from the way Dean’s curling his tongue along the underside of his cock and his fingers are flexing firmly enough to have Castiel rocking into Dean’s mouth that he’s not going to last like this. He presses in just once—nice and deep until his balls are resting on Dean’s chin and Dean’s eyes are opened wide with how stuffed full his mouth is—concentrating on the sinful sensation of Dean’s throat fluttering and struggling to hold him in place before he pulls out with a shuddering breath.
Dean smirks, pleased with himself and Cas’s glowing review, when Cas suddenly cups Dean’s face with his hands. His gaze is all soft the way it so frequently is when he’s looking at Dean, and Dean feels something come loose in his chest. Cas brushes his thumb over Dean’s bottom lip before he leans in and kisses him gently, once, twice, three times. “And then,” he says, but his lips are still brushing against Dean’s like he can’t quite tear himself away. “I’m going to need you to lose some clothes, because I’ve been thinking about you naked since the moment I met you and I don’t want to wait another second if I don’t have to.”
Cas grins the unfairly sexy smile Dean’s played back in the shower with a hand on his dick more times than he can count, and he’s suddenly incredibly glad for the fly of his slacks in the way so that Cas can’t feel the way it legitimately twitches at the sight.
After Dean posted his first video, Charlie posted the link on Twitter and tagged both he and Dean in it, and he gained more than a hundred new followers in a few hours. He sees that a few of them have Tweeted out the Taylor Swift video since they’ve tagged him in it (even though he wasn’t in it this time) along with Taylor Swift herself, and he makes sure to go through each of his notifications to thank them for their support and helping getting Dean’s music out there. One of the Tweets from lisafrankenstn includes the video, praises Dean’s voice,
“Least I could do,” Dean says. And because he’s uncomfortable with all of the insistent gratitude, he says, “And you don’t have to thank me every thirty seconds. I know you appreciate it.”
As they continue to chat and catch up as the afternoon passes, Sam and Eileen ask Cas questions sporadically enough that they seem interested without grilling the guy, and every time Cas says something that makes everybody laugh, Dean feels his heart fill just a little bit more. It’s easy being with what’s left of his family and Cas at the same time, and it brings him a sense of peace he’s never experienced before.
“That’s weird,” Liam comments, but apparently he’s finally out of questions now, because he turns back towards the TV.
“His whole body went limp,” Cas finishes, and Dean squeezes his eyes closed as his heart plummets. He can’t even imagine his own reaction if he had felt that. “In my arms. One second he was crying but he was fine, and the next, he was completely lifeless. For a second I thought—” Cas doesn’t finish his sentence, but he doesn’t have to say the words. “I’ve never been so scared in my life.”
“You got that right,” Dean agrees, scraping up the last of his coleslaw. “Another thing he gets from Cas.”
The smile he gets in return is nothing short of dazzling, and for a split second, his confidence wavers. How could someone like Dean, who is smart, funny, and breathtakingly attractive be interested in somebody like
Despite the way his body is still working on cooling itself down, the reminder is enough to have his face splitting on a grin.
We open where we left off, with Cas, Dean, Meg, Sam, Eileen, and Jack all glaring at Bela as she smirks at them all in return.
Dean and Cas look at Jamie, passed out in his seat, and the girl next to him screaming as the black smoke makes its escape.
"I know right?" Charlie fangirled quietly, glad to find someone who agreed. Lucifer only smiled at the three of them before he turned and walked off again.
Dean sits on a beach towel, smiling out at the scene of his family before him-- Sam and Eileen stand about waist-deep in the ocean, splashing each other; Jack, Cas, and Meg build a sandcastle together, Jack’s hair wet and sticking up in every direction-- It’s far from normal, but Dean can’t help but think of his family as perfect.
Emily gets up and crawls into her and Wesley's tent as Wesley nudges Nathan with his shoe to wake him.
We gotta keep moving. Meg, I can’t believe I’m saying this, but how about you stay behind Jack, watch out for him.
As you probably figured, this was originally intended to be posted the week of Dean's birthday, way back in January, but life (college) really got in the way of that. Finals are finally over, though, and I'm back home, so be prepared for more updates! I'm not sure yet if they will be weekly or bi-weekly, but I will definitely let you know when they're coming, so, if you haven't yet, head on over to @spnseason16 on tumblr and give me a follow to get all of the updates and sneak-peeks!
"Uh... just a heads up: I'm a lesbian." Charlie stated when she felt Dean's hand slide down from her elbow into her own hand.
Something’s up with you. Do you want to talk about it? I may not be able to hear, but that doesn’t mean I’m not a good listener.
"So, is this Charlie? I'm Castiel Novak." Castiel finally said, looking at the redhead who was still giggling.
People should be free to travel wherever they wish and be with whomever they wish. No more individual Heavens where everyone just relives their favorite memories. I want everyone to be together, free to do as they please.
Dean knocks back his glass and reaches for the bottle to pour himself another couple of fingers, and Castiel holds his glass out to Dean.
"Okay then, since my best friend is an assbutt, I'm Castiel Shurley. Nice to meet you." Castiel said.
That’s why I was calling you. I didn’t realize it was her at first. I thought you lot were getting rid of all of my sales demons, so I was going to ask you to stop.
Sam looks as if he is about to complain about Dean not being in charge of him, but Dean cuts him off before he can do so.
Eileen sits in front of the tv, completely unaware of Sam’s internal conflict as she watches a show.
Dean’s attention shifts to Cas, clearly startled by his appearance as he bursts into the room looking panicked.
We focus the camera briefly on Dean and Cas’ hands as Dean shifts to grab Cas’ hand and wind their fingers together before we focus back on Dean and Cas’ expressions. Dean shudders out a breath, tears apparent in his eyes.
We’ve got something in common, you and I. It seems we’ve both fallen for a Winchester boy-- in more ways than one, in your case.
Ectoplasm drips from Emily’s eye as she fits the noose around Sam’s neck and drags him towards the tree in the center of the clearing.
It just said it didn’t like me. It had a deal with Chuck, but it didn’t like me, so it won’t make the same deal with me.
Call Rowena and make sure she’s okay, for one. Research on how to fix the Empty situation, for another.
"Yes, Dad." Everyone groaned as they headed off to their rooms. Dean followed Cass up to his room and flopped onto his bed.
Well, in short, I had a lot of time to do some research while I was waiting for Sam to die so I could reunite the two of you.
We ZOOM IN on the phone, where the notification is still displayed, showing one message from Sam Winchester reading: “I’m here”.
"Too many. There's Michael who's 25, then Lucifer who's 24, Raphael is 22, and Gabriel and Balthazar are 21, then Uriel is 19, I'm 17, Anna is 16, Hannah is 14, Hester and Naomi are 9, then Samandriel, who we call Alfie, is 5. So that means I have... 11 siblings. My parents need to learn what birth control is." Castiel listed.
Dean lifts his hand and wiggles his fingers in a wave, and although he can’t hear Rufus, he’s pretty sure he’s cursing him under his breath as he turns away from them. “Guess I better have an awkward chat with them and let them know that I give my enthusiastic consent to having you back me up against any hard surfaces you can find.”
It’s stupid, because as nervous as he is, he’s only here to watch tonight. He has a general idea of what’s going to happen when he walks inside, but there were no photos of the rooms online, and obviously he has no idea what kind of people are going to be here tonight. If they’re all old as shit he might not even wanna do anything.
without sounding like a clingy, unhinged scorned lover? “I don’t... God, Cas—I can't lose you for real, okay?”
His words cut off when Cas just sucks harder, but then he pulls up to release his nipple, looking up at him questioningly. “I thought you wanted it both ways?”
been the one, but it just never worked out. Timing, moving, work, wanting different things. There’s a million reasons why nobody felt really right, you know?”
“I thought he was fine. He had already lost consciousness once and did it again in the ambulance, and I didn’t even know there was anything wrong with him. If it wasn’t for those other moms, he would have been at home with us when he lost consciousness again. He could have been in bed and we might not have known, and—”
So he’s going to do what Sam suggested they do: start over from the beginning and take things nice and slow. He’s going to be honest with Dean and let him know what he is and isn’t okay with, he’s going to continue to apologize for his own bad behavior and prove to Dean that he can be a trustworthy partner, and if he gets his way, he’s going to live happily ever after with his soulmate. But before he can get into any of that, he
from the inside out. It’s only moments before Cas’s mouth is hot on his sweaty skin, and he groans again when he feels Cas sucking a hickey into his neck, high enough that there’s no way he’ll be able to hide it.
Cas fucked him and knocked him up and they had a pup together has his cock swelling so fucking hard it hurts, and he cries out like a wounded animal when Cas starts to suck.
The elevator dings and the doors open, and Cas walks inside in his sweatpants and with cum stuck to the inside of his t-shirt. He lifts his head to give Dean one last look, and almost wishes he didn’t when he sees Dean’s eyes shining with unshed tears. He wants to tell him how much he loves him, how much he will
“Where do I go?” Dean asks him, but Liam’s already tugging him towards the yard filled with children. “I guess I’m gonna need to find one of your... teachers, right?” Dean says, unsure what they’re called.
whines at the loss when Castiel’s mouth leaves his. But Castiel isn’t done with him yet, and a brand new fire begins burning inside of him when Castiel’s lips start a blazing trail along his jaw.
Cas to put Dean’s mind at ease. Now it’s his turn to fit himself up against Cas’s back, and even though he’s exhausted, he’s not
“Oh.” Dean swallows hard, trying not to think of Lisa’s and Liam’s apartment just sitting there with all their stuff in it. “Whatever he needs, yeah. I’m
You’re telling me. I was just about to text Sam to see if I could go bug them tonight. You could probably come with if you want?
Dean was expecting this. He knows what he looks like. He’s tall but thin from missing too many meals, his leather jacket hangs off of him, his cheeks are smattered with freckles, his lips are full and pink, and his eyelashes are long and dark. He looks like a total twink, but it works for him with the guys and the girls, so he doesn’t mind one bit.
“Thank you for apologizing, and for explaining a little bit more,” Cas replies. “I think I needed to hear that.”
“Why is that?” Cas asks. “I know she hurt you, but the options must be endless for you. You could have anybody.”
He crosses his legs in a futile attempt to hide the state he’s in, and while his face is all kinds of red, he answers, “Can you blame me?”
He wasn’t expecting Cas to bring it up after a week of complete radio silence, but he probably shouldn’t be surprised. Cas never lets shit go. It’s one of the only reasons a relationship between them ever worked out in the first place. Dean’s preferred coping method is to ignore his feelings and his problems, but Cas’s is to face any feelings or problems head-on. Being Cas’s friend (and then boyfriend) meant learning how to deal with his bluntness and how to love him for it, and eventually, opening up about his own shit.
Dean smiles seductively and gets right back down to business, starting a new path from the tip to the base and back up again with a mix of tongue and spit-sloppy lips, arousal burning hotter low in his stomach with every single sound he wrings out of the man above him. Cas’s legs twitch and shudder each time he gets closer to the head, but it’s not until he’s swirling his tongue around it like a melting ice cream cone on a hot day that Cas finally does what he’s been waiting for all along and
around him. Unexpected warmth in his chest goes to war with concern for Cas, but Dean’s still coming and he can’t even think straight, but fuck—
Dean blinks, obviously set back by the question. “I mean, I never really thought about it, but as long as you make it the right black, I don’t see why not?”
“It’s a piece of me, so if anybody should have it, it should be you, my love.” Castiel smiles at him with his eyes, and lifts the hand that’s holding the blade between them. “It will match your wedding ring.”
“Fffuck.” Cas’s voice comes out on a stuttering breath that quickly gets sucked back in when Dean wiggles his finger inside of Cas along with Cas’s other two. Cas is incredibly tight, Dean’s panting he’s breathing so hard, and just
“No.” But Cas starts slinking towards him so sexily it can’t be anything but deliberate. Cas puts one hand on Dean’s chest and trails a finger downwards slowly as he speaks. “But I do want to
“Even if you don’t want to,” Dean confirms. Liam doesn’t look too pleased about that, so he tries to up the ante with a bribe. “Then if you do it fast enough, you can use your manly muscles to help me mash these potatoes for Cas, too.”
“I won’t have to worry about that anymore, thanks to you,” Cas smiles. “You really outdid yourself.”
Although he’d like to say it took more coaxing than that, he winds up lying on Cas’s bare chest while they watch Friends on Netflix. Cas strokes his back, his hair, the back of his neck, and even though he hasn’t solved a single problem that had him feeling so overwhelmed in the kitchen, he feels undeniably better after four episodes and another shot of whiskey.
“I’m not going to care about you any less if we fuck now and date later, if that’s what you’re asking me,” Cas says bluntly.
Castiel didn’t expect to be, but he has to admit he’s impressed by the sight laid out in front of him.
Cas rises up to kiss him again, a whimper leaving his throat as his lips part Dean’s, and Dean’s suddenly aching for it, for the connection he feels to Cas when they’re as close as two people can possibly be. He reaches between them and guides Cas’s cock between his cheeks, and their lips never part even when Dean sits back and takes him inside of him one delicious inch at a time. He feels whole once he’s totally seated, complete with Cas tending to his needs in every way possible, and he’s so chock-full of everything
Dean figures he’d probably want to do the same if the situation was reversed, so he nods his okay and heads to his room to switch out his jeans and boxers. It becomes immediately apparent that he’s gonna need a little wipe down, so he wets a cloth in the bedroom to take care of that and figures that’ll do for now, but he’ll
Pointedly scraping off his plate makes him realize that Cas hasn’t even touched his piece, but when he goes to ask why, Cas just shakes his head slightly like he doesn’t want Dean to mention it. It’s fucking
“I feel like the lesson here is don’t send Cas to do the shopping alone,” Dean says, making sure Cas can tell he isn’t actually mad. “This room looks like a Pinterest board vomited all over it.”
He finds Liam’s cup next to the sink. “Let me know if you need help opening that,” Dean tells him. He fills his cup with water and hands it to him, noticing that he did manage to get the granola bar open, though the wrapper is in several tiny pieces for his trouble. Liam grabs the cup and heads towards the living room again. “Woah, woah, woah,” Dean says, stopping him with his tone of voice. “Who do you think’s gonna pick up your garbage?”
“It’s a nice shade of blue, but your eyes still put it to shame,” Dean declares, turning Castiel’s head to the side to look at it more closely. Castiel is blushing adorably, and so Dean continues to say the entirety of what’s on his mind. “You deserve to have everything your heart desires, Castiel. If you want flowers, music, the stars from the sky, just tell me and I’ll do everything within my power to give you what will make you happy.”
Castiel’s curious and concerned enough now to poke his head around the corner, which is when he sees Dean laid out on their bed, pregnant belly bulging with life while he tries and fails to get the button done up on his last pair of jeans that “fit.”
“Wanted to up my game a little.” Dean opens his arms a little, and it’s then that Cas really takes in Dean’s appearance. His hair is slicked back, he’s in a long, black peacoat that hides his shirt but shows off a red tie, black dress pants, and shiny dress shoes.
with you, and I want you just like this, breathing hard and pink-cheeked, flushed from head to toe with pleasure. And then I want to slip inside of you, as easy as breathing, and share myself with you in ways I’ll never share with another.”
He never took into account how Cas’s arousal would paint his high cheekbones pink, how Cas’s confidence and ease swallowing down Dean’s dick would light a fire in his belly, how Cas’s wild hair would feel slipping between Dean’s fingers when Cas starts to take in more of his cock.
He knows it’s against the rules, but it feels right, so he leans in to give Dean a quick peck before he responds. “Thought you’d never ask.”
“Don’t worry, I’m still gonna choose you when you’ve got water comin’ outta your ears like a fountain.” As he gets within arms reach of Jess, he puts his hand out, palm up. “You can always let me do it. You know you wanna see him looking like a drowned rat.”
“Then maybe telling you again without joking will help even more. I have never cared for anybody as much as I care for you. Every day I fall a little bit more, and a part of me knows it’s impossible and absolute madness, but I feel like it could be any second now that the rug is torn out from under my feet and I’ll fall the rest of the way in love for the first time. With you, Dean. Only you.” Castiel brings his hands to cup Dean’s face, and finally, Dean looks up. They make eye contact, and the way Castiel is looking at him—as if he’s the only thing in the whole realm that matters—almost brings him to his knees. “And I will tell you every day I am lucky enough to have the chance to. Every hour. Every minute if you want me to. No one else comes close to you,
When Dean smiled, Cas’s stomach did a somersault for the first time in his entire life, and that was all it took. He didn’t understand why at the time, but from that moment forward, all he wanted to do was make Dean smile again.
“Hold up there, little man,” Dean says, walking away from Cas and over to Liam. “Are you tellin’ me you have the choice between riding in
His nerve endings light up with pleasure when Dean relents and gives him his first shallow thrust, and
“I figured you might have a hard time, so I got the morning off to drive you. If you don’t want me to anymore because of all this tonight—”
“I thought that’s what you would say, but I just wanted to give you a warning before I showed up with one more mouth to feed.”
the guy you’re in love with for the holidays? I just watched a movie about this on Netflix!” Then, laughing delightedly, “You
“It doesn’t matter because she’s full. So is my third choice, and so is every daycare I could get a hold of on a Saturday.” Cas looks down at the table, and for the first time since they started talking about this, he sounds scared and broken when he keeps talking. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
Dean doesn’t have a lot of regrets in his life, but one of his biggest has gotta be telling Charlie that he’s going to ask Cas to marry him someday. That was over two years ago now, and he’s pretty sure she’s asked him about it at least once a week since then.
His mouth pops open and he can’t think of a single thing to say for about three seconds before he huffs, “Shut up.” The worst part is that even though he can’t see him, he knows
Cas’s arms give out on him in the exact same second their groins slot together entirely: two swollen cockheads, along their long shafts, and all the way down to where their balls are nestled together intimately. Cas hides his face in Dean’s neck as he collapses, and then
as if anybody could possibly go on one date and know that. His mind must’ve been more clouded than he thought from Cas in that sweater vest for his thoughts to go off in that direction so soon.
It isn’t until the next day that he realizes he didn’t fall asleep wishing for his soulmate there next to him for the first time in as long as he can remember.
“In a weird way...” He chooses his words carefully, still not wanting to say too much. “I feel like that’s the one thing that didn’t change. This stuff, when it’s just you and me, it’s
With nothing important to dress for, Dean throws on his most casual clothes, a pair of thick but surprisingly comfortable black slacks and a long-sleeve shirt, and then he takes off down the hallway and walks towards the kitchen. Technically, he’s supposed to eat in the dining room, but he and Sam spent so much time stealing food out of the kitchen growing up that they have their own little stools in the corner by the fridge.
Cas’s tone of voice makes it clear that this isn’t the first time Cas has said his name, which makes him flush hard. “Sorry. Got lost thinking about the suspender/belt/shoe combo you got goin’ on. You look amazing.”
“You used to fuck me so hard the headboard shook when he was inside of me. I think he’s okay with it.” Cas takes his eyes off of their son for the first time since he took him out of the back of his car, just to shoot Dean an icy glare. “Plus, he’s so strapped into that thing you could probably drop the whole thing upside down and he wouldn’t even budge.”
“That’s what that was all about?” After Dean nods, Cas groans into their next kiss, but he sounds annoyed and frustrated instead of brimming with pleasure like he’s used to hearing when their lips are pressed together. “You’re such an idiot.” Dean’s lips are stretched into a bigger smile when Cas’s forehead comes down to rest against his, because he knows Cas is probably right, and god it feels good to hear him be something other than
“‘Night.” He lies there in Cas’s arms, thinking over the events of the day while he tries to fall asleep. As something occurs to him again, he says, “If those socks are still on the floor when I get home tomorrow I’m gonna be pissed.”
jeans are suddenly a hell of a lot tighter. He jolts and looks at the concrete floor guiltily when Cas straightens up and nudges the car door closed with a bump of his hip. “Can you get the door?” Cas asks, nodding to the door leading to the bunker.
“When it comes to bein’ parents, it’s a little bit different with two boys instead of a boy and a girl. You can’t call me dad
“No... problem...o,” Donna replies slowly. Because she sounded a little distracted, Dean’s curious enough to spare a glance over his shoulder to see what caught her attention. His insides freeze when she nods to the blanket and pillow still on the couch. “Trouble in paradise?”
Just when he thought his dad couldn’t fall any further in his eyes. He really thinks Dean would do that to somebody? What’s Dean ever done to give him that impression? He’s genuinely insulted by the insinuation.
Cas’s voice sounds rougher than usual, raw even, and his frozen heart shatters into a million different pieces when he thinks about Cas being out here on the too-small couch feeling even half as upset as he was in his room.
He’s going to come in his goddamn panties before Cas gets a hand on his bare skin and he still can’t seem to stop his hips from rocking into it.
Castiel leans back on his hands now, too, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Don’t ever tell my father or yours, but I’m so glad you don’t speak like I do. I’m hopelessly endeared by the casual slang you use when you talk. I’ve never heard anybody with status talk like you do.”
and turns his head to the side to follow the path of a vein down with his tongue, smooching his lips along Cas’s flushed skin up to the head, flicking his eyes up to watch Cas watching him when he drags Cas’s cock along his lips like he’s applying lipstick.
“She’s right,” Cas says firmly, still speaking loudly enough that the lady can absolutely hear them. “And even if not everybody agrees with that—”
have his best interest at heart. While he can’t come right out and say he forgives Cas the way Cas has forgiven him so soon, he can say, “I don’t know, man. Maybe this was how it was always supposed to be.”
“I hate to be the one to break your big, gay bubble of oblivion,” Sam starts without looking at them, “but people already know.”
Liam scrunches up his face, looking over at the woman who Dean himself is way too chicken to look at now. “How come?”
“Oh.” He needs to actually eat breakfast in the dining room, doesn’t he? “I, uh, whenever’s fine with me. Do you have a preference?”
“Yeah,” Dean answers, and Cas is surprised to hear how low Dean’s voice is. He’s never heard it sound like this before, but he likes it quite a bit. “It didn’t feel weird for me either.”
Dean and Cas follow him down the hallway and into the office where they see the Daycare Supervisor sitting with Liam, who looks like he’s been crying.
Dean looks up, paying attention to his surroundings for the first time since Castiel took his arm. They’re on the path to the stables. Though he wasn’t consciously thinking about bringing Castiel this way, now seems as good a time as any to see how the man he’s promised to marry reacts to his favorite pastime.
He carries the memory of it with him back into his own shabby apartment, and it’s still on his mind when he climbs into bed for the night.
“As much as you want!” Dean says, making Cas laugh again. “I didn’t know what you liked so I just got a little bit of everything.”
“You kids don’t deserve this crap,” Ellen says frankly. “You don’t cause nobody any trouble, and you look out for those around you. Now it’s our turn to have
He admires the way she doesn’t hesitate for a second before she holds her hand out for him to shake. He takes it with his grin still fully in place and gives it a solid shake. “I’ll draft up the paperwork and we can make it official.”
“Neither did you, until you thought it was the end,” Dean says, and despite the audible frustration and hurt, there’s no venom in it. “Anyway, it’s not like I didn’t
Even with how disconnected Dean had felt from everything, with the unease burning through his veins, he still felt a twinge of fear and dread at the resignation in his friend’s voice. “Sam said you were worse, uh, this summer.” It was awkward, mentioning the six week period he’d spent as a demon so casually, but the way Cas’s jaw clenched said that he knew exactly when Dean was referring to. “And you got better,” he added, somewhat unnecessarily. “At least for a while, anyway. Whatever you did, can’t you do it again? Just until we find a more permanent solution?”
, like hope and terror and grim determination have all carved out space in the frown lines. He knows the feeling: he doesn’t think he takes a full breath until the air crackles and the doorway opens, black nothingness giving way to a silhouette larger than the one that went in.
It wasn’t much. It was barely enough to justify the trip up here, and it certainly wasn’t the cure-all Sam and Cas had been hoping for. Dean felt numb, the little optimism he’d managed to summon up deflating at yet another dead end. But Cas stepped forward and grasped Ramiel’s hands in his, beaming. “Thank you, brother. Truly.”
Cas just hums. “That can be arranged,” he mutters, and then leans back in, fitting their lips together once more. The relief is beginning to set in, both of them realizing that yes, this is really happening, and each kiss is more and more frantic, as though they’re trying to pour years of lost time into each one.
"Family? Hah, okay. You keep telling yourself that, bucko." Lucifer gives him an exaggerated wink. "But between you and me, I'd work on the delivery a little more. Once more, with feeling. Maybe then the next time lover boy here is mooning over you, he'll listen. Not that you really need him to believe it, anyway. He
And then on day eight, Castiel appeared at their front door, alone, grim-faced, and weary, and said, “I may have found something.”
“There may be some precedence to that,” Cas murmured, not looking up from the file’s contents. “There are some stories about Kabaiel. She was stationed on earth, in Uruk, when she supposedly fell in love with a demon. Many say that she gave him her Grace so that they’d both be able to live a mortal life together.”
got him back, because this is the first time they’ve had the chance to just be, all three of them, it… makes sense? The thought of losing both Cas and Jack at once, in only seeing them in small snatches here and there when they can pull themselves away from their work up in Heaven
“Yeah,” Dean said flatly, the word feeling sour in his mouth as he instantly recalled the disastrous year they’d learned that for themselves. He refused to look Cas’s way. “I’ve heard.”
“There was an angel after Hannah and me. She would have killed me, but Crowley appeared. He killed her, and poured her Grace down my throat.” He said it so fucking calmly, like Crowley showing up to save his bacon was a thing that happened all the time.
“Ah, yes.” Ramiel’s smile slipped some. “Well, that may be a bit more difficult. Soul magic is dangerous, and mostly hypothetical. I am afraid I cannot offer more on that.”
Lucifer scoffs, planting one hand on his hip and shaking his head in faux disappointment. The melodrama of it all looks
And Sam still has no idea what they’re talking about, but it must mean something to Cas, because he jerks his head up so sharply, Sam all but feels his own neck twinge in sympathy.
“One of the first souls I escorted to Heaven was Abel’s. He was a righteous man, and was horrified to learn that it had not been our Father that he had been speaking with, but the Serpent. He asked me to go to his brother, to see if there was anything to be done.”
It’s almost absurd, how the next few hours feel, but every time Sam starts to settle into the normalcy of it, something jars him from it. Cas’s Grace is dampened enough that he needs to sit down and rest. The pizza doesn’t come from a run Dean makes to the town over, but from Jack, popping out and back into the bunker in a flash and proclaiming it’s straight from Sicily (it’s delicious, but still so fucking weird). There’s no underlying tension related to some Big Bad being out there, undefeated. Weirdest of all, maybe, Cas won’t look at Dean. Dean keeps looking at Cas, both when he’s talking and when he’s not, but the usual flow of things is different in ways that seem even more jarring and off-tempo than when they’d do their weird staring thing, something Sam didn’t even realize he was used to until now, when it’s missing. It takes a while to notice, too, but Dean’s not saying a word directly to Cas. Every time Cas looks Dean’s way only to look away a moment later, Dean looks more and more like a kicked puppy, and that’s…. This is supposed to be
Sam reluctantly let go, but his grin was still firmly in place. “Sorry, man,” he said, though he didn’t seem it in the least.
It was clear that it wasn’t Dean she wanted to say this to, but if Cas was being radio silent, he’d listen for him. It wasn’t his place to tell her that he was happy for her, that he hoped she was happy here, that she deserved some peace and stability, or all the things he imagined Cas would say. Instead, he just smiled. “Jody and Alex are good people.”
, or some glib remark about finding it in the bottom of one of the bottles of whiskey around here, or even something too honest about not thinking there’s one in the cards for him.
Sam cleared his throat, the sound cutting through the building tension like a blade. “Okay, guys. Back on subject?”
Given how Sam’s eyebrows immediately drew into a frown, Dean was guessing he wasn’t the only one that saw a problem here. “Awesome. Well, the last time Sam and I went knocking on heaven’s door, it was via the business end of a shotgun.” The laugh that punched out of him was hollow and dark. “Considering what happened the last time I died, I’m pretty damn certain that’s not an option we have now.”
Since taking on the Mark, Dean’s patience had been even shorter than usual, and dealing with pretentious winged dicks had him at the last thread of it. He grit his teeth, clenching his fist, and felt a flash of longing for the solid power of the First Blade in his palm. He was aching to put his fist through the asshole’s teeth, but he settled for a pained grimace as he waved at Ramiel to continue.
“What the hell, guys?” Dean interjected, shoving his chair back from the table with one violent move. “We’re not seriously talking about this, are we?”
-- and Dean looks his way, throws his head back laughing like an idiot, and then makes a point of threading his fingers with Cas’s. “I’m not saying you’re going to want to put your noise cancelling headphones on, but I’m also not
For what feels like the first time all night, Cas looks up and directly at Dean. There’s something just as broken, just as desperate in his expression, and it makes the small smile on his face look wrong. “I’m needed there.”
“Great.” He sighs and takes a moment to contemplate when the hell his life had become this, driving an Angel of the Lord to an outlet mall to buy a birthday present for the girl that tried to set up her friends to kill him with a fucking axe the last time they met. “Do you even know what you’re looking for?” he asks, and almost immediately regrets it. He’s not sure he wants to know the answer.
“Why the hell not? Man, you saw what I did back in Pontiac. You and I both know it’s just a matter of time before I get ganked one way or another, and I’ll be damned before I make Sammy deal with a black-eyed version of me again.” He snorted and, unable to help himself, added, “Literally.”
Once Dean’s peeled himself away from Cas, Sam goes in for a hug, too, and doesn’t miss how tired and shaky Cas’s smile looks. “Glad you’re back, man,” he says, words barely making it out through the lump in his throat.
They were standing in a small diner, nautical images scattered along the walls, a quiet murmur of indistinguishable conversation and the clatter of dishes providing a steady soundtrack. It took a moment for Dean to get his bearings, but the moment he recognized their surroundings, he fought the urge to be sick. It was the place he and Cas had eaten at a little over a week ago (and Jesus, it felt like it’d been at least triple that). He’d shooed Sam away to give himself the opportunity to ask Cas to kill him (and, if he’s being honest, out of no small amount of fear that the bitch would bring up Destiel or Casdean whatever the hell he wanted to call it just to fuck with Dean), but he hadn’t anticipated just how much it’d feel like, well, a
It’s starting to dawn on him that he seriously screwed something up. That, in itself, is a pretty familiar feeling. What’s less familiar is the fact that this time, he has no fucking clue what it was he did. Cas tugs on his sleeve a little bit, but Dean only holds on tighter. “Seriously, Cas, what just happened? And don’t say ‘nothing.’”
The drive back to the bunker is tense and pissy, and by the time they roll in at nearly midnight, Dean’s jaw and knuckles are both sore from clenching them. They don’t say a word as they head in and to their separate rooms, and it isn’t until Dean’s door has shut behind him that he feels the tension leaving him in one long, drawn-out exhale.
It’s a damn good question, and one that Sam’s not sure Dean even has an answer to, if their discussion from four days ago is any sign.
“Google,” Dean repeats, the slightest bit amused despite himself. “Seriously?” When he’d seen Cas frantically typing on his phone, he’d been picturing more of a life-or-death, ‘I just had an idea about what that guy said about the faith healer,’ ‘this may be a lead,’ type thing, but no, Cas had been asking Google about birthday presents for a teenage girl. Okay.
For all that Cas seemed unmovable and so unknowable when he’d first barged into Dean’s life, since then Dean’s actually become pretty good at reading him. He’s miles and miles away from the blank-faced angel he’d been back then. He feels so much more and shows it. But at the moment, Dean can’t, or won’t, figure out what the look on his face means.
What? Yeah, Cas had taken more than his fair share of hits like the rest of them, but he always landed on his feet. He didn’t get bogged down by the angst and trauma like he and Sam did, the lucky bastard.
“You could end this,” he spat. His whole arm was raw, the Mark throbbing in time to his rocketing heartbeat. “Right now. Hell, I basically
They turned back to the dwindled stack of remaining dishes, silently and unanimously agreeing that the moment was over.
Cas just keeps staring, and when he finally makes a move, it’s to look at Jack, face all screwed up. “I—I don’t—”
He reaches out again -- Dean recoils, has to throw a palm out behind him to steady himself on the table, but Lucifer ignores it, reaches out and pats him on the shoulder. "Well, you have fun in that guilt spiral you're heading down. Call me when you're ready to take on the Darkness. You have my number." And with that, he blows a mocking kiss in Dean's direction and saunters up the stairs, whistling to himself.
“Yeah, well, right back at you, buddy,” Dean mutters. He chooses to ignore how expertly he’d just illustrated Cas’s point, and instead follows.
It wasn’t, and given how Cas suddenly refused to meet his gaze, Dean knew Cas hadn’t forgotten what he’d asked of him last time they met, but like hell was he going to bring it up in front of Sam. “Fine,” he said. He knew which battles to pick. He knew, deep in his bones, that this trip would be a waste of time and energy, but it’d give Sam at least a day or two off from hovering and worrying, and it’d give him time to talk Cas into doing what needed to be done. “When do we leave?”
in their eyes?? Something’s both familiar and weirdly, completely new and it’s throwing Sam for a loop, because it’s almost like –
Cas has been standing so still that when he moves, Dean almost flinches from the suddenness of it. Instead he just stands there, frozen, as Cas grabs the mug from him, places it on the counter, and crowds him against it. And it’s not like they’ve ever been good about personal space, but Cas is closer now than he ever has been, so close that Dean can
They were only paces away from the bunker door when it swung open. Sam had that bright-eyed, slightly crazed look of someone who hadn’t really slept in days and his hair was reaching frankly appalling levels of gravity defiance.
in a way that Sam hasn’t seen in a long time; one hand’s got a death grip on the bottle, the other is tracing the raised edges where they’d crudely carved Cas and Jack’s names into the table besides theirs and Mom’s initials.
And what the hell can he say to that? He settles for an, “Okay,” torn between exasperation and affection. “Okay.”
“Every human soul, yes.” A flicker of something passed across Cas’s face as he finally looked away from the scene, but it was gone again before Dean could get a clear read on it. “Angels don’t have souls.”
Frustration was beginning to war with the exhaustion on Cas’s face, and Dean wasn’t sure whether to count it as a victory or not. “What does that matter?”
.” He grabs the machete from Dean’s hand and strides out of the barn without another backwards glance.
this much, like the Mark had put a damper on all his emotions. It hurt, but he wouldn’t take the alternative, not for anything. “Shit. I think it worked.”
"Of course." He's still smiling, easy and unhurried, and it's almost enough. Something passes his face quickly, too quickly for Dean to get a read on, and then he adds, "I always come when you call."
to be found on the Mark, they would’ve found it ages ago. Instead, he stayed quiet, halfheartedly leafing through boxes upon boxes of files as his brother tore through every room in search of answers that just didn’t exist. The only time he tried to say something other than ‘hey, let me go whip us up some sandwiches’ or ‘pass me that box,’ tried to bring up the possibility of there not being an answer, Sam put a stop to it before he had been able to get a whole sentence strung together. Days passed, but it felt more like prolonging the inevitable than any true calm before the storm.
Cas just makes a small humming noise, still focused wholly on the selection of novelty t-shirts. “I’m sure I’ll know the right gift when I see it.”
.” The way Cas stands seems almost like an afterthought, like he’s barely aware of anything else right now except Dean. …Which is probably accurate, to be honest. Neither of them seem all that aware that Sam and Jack are still here, and Sam clears his throat almost automatically.
“C’mere, kid,” Dean says, and it’s his turn to tug him in. “We’re proud of you, you know that, right?”
“It is something, Dean.” The relief and tentative hope in Sam’s eyes felt like a punch to the gut. “Look, man, we’ve been hitting nothing but dead ends. At least this gives us someplace else to start.”
. For all he was so gung-ho on saving Dean now, he hadn’t given a damn before Dean had woken up with black eyes. Dean had nearly killed Sam. If he’d been even a little bit less interested in howling at the moon and a little more interested in embracing his dark side, he could have done some serious damage. And Cas had known, the whole time --
Dean, still feeling a bit spiteful about the lack of sleep, was unable to resist. “I’ll alert the media.”
Jack stumbles out, grin so bright Sam’s not sure he’s not actually glowing. Cas looks a little worse for wear as he staggers out too. His trench coat is dirty and creased, the bags under his eyes are deeper than usual, and he looks as exhausted as Sam’s felt the past few days, but he’s
Dean combs back through his memories of unloading his whole pathetic life story to Charlie when he first found out she was a lesbian. He’s pretty sure a decent chunk of that life story involved Cas and how much he loved and missed him at the time, thanks to the margaritas Charlie kept pouring him. She’s the only one in L.A. other than Bela that knew about Cas at all, and unlike Bela, Charlie was
He’s just putting his card back in his wallet when the door chimes, and when he turns around to leave so the tailor can get to his next appointment, Cas is standing there looking nervous or embarrassed, or maybe a combination of both.
“And he is very much enjoying being close to you,” Cas replies. “But he has to piss like a racehorse.”
Dean.” Cas gasps against Dean’s lips as Dean swipes his thumb over the tip of his cock. “Faster,” Cas urges him, diving in for another fiery kiss.
“I’m not likely to get one from you, now am I?” Castiel teases, but still, he hesitates. “Is the water safe?”
Castiel’s cock drags wetly against the cool wall, and apparently that little bit of friction is all he needs to set him off with Dean’s knot locked inside of him, because the next thing he knows, he’s clenching down hard around Dean’s knot as he comes with a muffled cry all over the wall in front of him. Dean sags against him, breathing hard into the side of his neck as Dean’s hips keep fucking him shallowly, smearing Castiel’s cock along the wall and tugging on Castiel’s rim, unintentionally prolonging his orgasm in the best possible way until he’s shaking with over sensitivity.
That’s encouraging enough for him, so he purposely leads the way to the stables now while he tells Castiel about his dinner with Hannah and how she was automatically put out of the running when she said she hated horses. Castiel asks him what other things would give him an ‘automatic out of the running,’ and Dean laughs while he explains some of the Dean Winchester dos and don’ts, thinking of what Jo and Ellen said before about a cheat sheet. He ends up explaining that bit, too, and Castiel says he’ll be sure to pick the womens’ brains just as they arrive at the stables.
. He doesn’t look at anybody else like this. Dean knows that for damn sure because he’s tried to see it. But it’s only him. As usual, it leaves him feeling too warm and just on the good side of panicked, but he still can’t look away. Thankfully there’s nobody around to notice right now, so he indulges himself and keeps eye contact while he can. He’s all-too aware of how hard his heart is pounding in his chest, how he and Cas have somehow moved close enough to each other that he can feel the heat coming from his body, and finally, his eyes drop away from Castiel’s - but only so he can look at his lips.
His stomach muscles jump when he feels fingers on his fly. Their kiss comes to an abrupt halt and they’re both breathing into each other’s mouths, warm puffs of heavy breaths landing on lips as they wait each other out, trying to decide if they’re going to take this further or not.
“You’re really strong,” Liam says, his little arms still around his neck. “But still soft and snuggly.”
His thoughts are interrupted by the wet sound of Cas rubbing his hands together to warm up the lube, ramping Dean’s anticipation up to 11, and he’s already breathing hard when he feels two slick fingers sliding between his cheeks. Castiel circles his rim with gentle fingers for just a moment before a single digit sinks inside of him without resistance, making him shudder a second time as arousal slams into him like a fist.
ticks all his boxes whether he’s being fucked or fucking, and wrapped up with the way Cas is looking at him like he’s going to fuck him into next week has his throat feeling so thick with desire that all he can do is nod.
Cas carefully pushes forward the last little bit that he can, and just that small amount of friction inside of him is enough to have him biting back another groan. Cas gradually pulls his fingers out to slip back in a little bit at a time until the full length (and significant width) of three fingers is working in and out of him in earnest, and he’s
He can’t frigging wake up this fast. He needs to lie around for a few minutes first to make his brain start working enough to find his way to the coffee pot, and only after
suction. It's freaking weird, but combined with his thick fingers up his ass, it’s undeniably effective at making him feel like he’s going to blow his load any second now.
He earns a low, rippling laugh from Castiel for that. “I would,” Castiel starts. He lowers his voice so that only Dean can hear him when he finishes with, “But I’m much more interested in learning what these lips of yours look like in a pout.”
Dean wasn’t expecting it, but he sure as fuck isn’t complaining, especially not when it triggers a second, incredibly powerful orgasm. Bliss rockets through his body, shooting from his extremities straight to the core of his very being, and it only multiplies when he realizes he’s filling Cas
It isn’t until a truly sweltering day in June that a new idea presents itself to him in the form of an unexpected customer at One Page At A Time.
“And I’m sure you were smiling and being altogether pleasant towards those children when that happened?” Cas asks. “No glaring or grunting while towering over them by several feet?”
“Yeah, none of that is new information.” And frankly, none of it was doing anything to help the irritation throbbing at Dean’s temples.
Well now Dean just feels even shittier. He knows he’s been a dick. Ever since Cas decided to give up his Grace and officially move into one of the empty rooms in the bunker, Dean’s been on edge. And for once, it’s not like he’s just been waiting for something to give, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Yeah, it usually does, and usually finds a way to kick them in the ass on the way down, but he’s slowly starting to believe that maybe, once in a while, they can have a win. Lucifer and the British Men of Letters have been taken care of. Crowley and Rowena are still out there, but closer to reluctant allies than any true danger they need to worry about. Mary moved out, but they’re slowly working on their relationship. Having Cas here full-time, close and dangerously human is the cherry on top of a pretty damn good year by their standards. And that, more than anything, is what has him on edge. Because if the universe is finally starting to give them good things, he’s the only thing standing in his own way. It was hard knowing that Heaven and Hell were personally standing in the way of his happiness. It was hard as hell always having something come between him and Cas. It was hard only getting days, maybe weeks when they were lucky, scattered here and there before another crisis pulled one or both of them away again. But for all their spiels on free will, somehow it’s harder having Cas here with him all the time, only having himself to blame for not being brave and taking the step they’ve been dancing around for years.
sound like that – “and I’m starting to think that maybe I’m a little too good at the posturing shit.”
, this dorky, goofy little dude with messy hair, annoyingly blue eyes, and trademark coat that he’d almost forgotten that, underneath, Cas was still
“Fuck, no, Cas,” Dean says, rushing to dispel that notion before Cas dwells on it for too long, “that’s not it at all, man. I lo- I like having you here.” He can feel his cheeks starting to flush, so if for nothing else than having something to do with himself, he reaches out and grabs the mug from Cas and takes a sip like that’ll actually help. Maybe if it’d been whiskey, it would’ve, but all it does is burn the fuck out of his tongue. He winces.
She snorted, more of the derision he’d come to expect from her coming out. “What show have you been watching?”
“No, Dean, I didn’t. You asked and I listened, but I never agreed. Not once you actually elaborated the favor you were asking, that is,” he amended.
Dean looked away, feeling his face flush as Sam sent him an unsubtle wink and headed out of the room. “Dude. Pie,” he called after him. If he was going to go along with Sam’s completely transparent excuse, he at least deserved to get some damn pie from it.
Son of a bitch, that was right. A quick glance over at Cas showed that he looked just as stunned as Dean felt.
that Sam doesn’t have the heart to make a pointed comment about the brazen purple mark on his throat. “You always were a little slow on the uptake.”
“Be careful,” Sam said once they finally let go of one another. His eyes darted to the side, over Dean’s shoulder. “Both of you.”
"How?" It's only one of the million questions sluggishly making their way through his brain. His voice sounds like a stranger's, coarse and cut into a million pieces. "Was it Rowena? The spell she did?"
The moment Cas’s fingers closed around the Mark, Dean shivered. There were discordant notes of irritation and violence clawing their way through the thrill of want, and he was dizzy with it, unsure if he wanted to launch himself at Cas to kiss him or to tear open his flesh, to taste his blood, to feel his heart stutter and gasp as he ripped and cut and --
Another sigh burst through the line, crackling with static at the edges. “So we’re looking at soul magic.”
Sam hears a choked, awful noise from Dean and has to blink back tears. Between one blink and the next, Dean’s launched himself towards them, wrestles Cas away from Jack’s shoulder and has him in a hug that looks so tight it looks painful, words muffled as he bites them out into Cas’s coat. From here, all Sam can hear is snatches – the overarching theme being, of course, how much of a fucking dumbass Cas is – but it feels right, and for the first time in a long, long time, he feels whole. His family is here, and when he reaches out to grab Jack into a hug, too, it’s easy to forget for a moment that their kid is the new God, and that they’re all just a little broken, and that healing is going to take a long time.
He couldn’t -- or wouldn’t, whatever -- read the expression on Cas’s face. Whatever was running through his head, though, Cas had apparently come to the same conclusion and opted against a long, drawn-out goodbye, for he stepped forward and rolled up Dean’s sleeve, exposing the Mark.
knew? What, leading your frigging angel army too much for you to even give me a heads-up? What the hell, Cas?!” Beneath the anger and hostility was the too-familiar sting of betrayal. Cas hadn’t breathed so much as a warning, hadn’t shown any signs of dread or
“Dean?” He hadn’t noticed that Sam was asleep in a chair beside him. Dean’s voice must have awoken him. “Oh thank God, you’re awake. How you feeling, man?” He leaned forward, hovering a bit.
“We have plenty of time to make up for it,” Cas said softly, and then leaned in again to begin to do just that.
It feels… off. The words feel like they should be an ending, a milestone, a way to close out this chapter and figure out where the next pages take them. Instead, it feels like a mockery. Sam wonders if Dean feels it too, with the way he hesitates, his whole body straining like there’s something that’s trying to break free. If there is, it loses the fight: there’s a small, half-bitten off sigh, and he raises the bottle to his lips.
Dean wanted to laugh at the mental image of how Cas would have (should have) reacted to that, but he couldn’t. It was clear from Claire’s expression that she thought something was really, truly wrong.
Sam’s face broke into the widest smile Dean had seen in a long time as he leapt from his seat to wrap Dean in a bone-crushing hug.
She kept her eyes down, focusing on rubbing the already-dry plate, but when he didn’t turn back to the dishes, she folded. “It’s just. Ever since he broke me out of the group home, he’s been trying to like, I don’t know, be my friend or weird replacement pseudo-dad or something. Way too hard, most of the time.” She gave him a wry smile, but it looked forced. “I’m sure you’ve noticed, but he’s kinda a doof.” It had been almost a year since Dean had last seen her. She was nearly nineteen, but whether it was the more muted makeup, the pigtails she wore her hair in, or the glimmers of fear in her eyes, she somehow looked far younger now. “Anyway, he’d like, send me all these stupid texts, talking about a bird he’d seen that day or some stupid cat video, or just a fu- freaking string of emojis.” She snorted. “It was kinda annoying, you know? But then a few weeks ago he just... stopped. I sent him a couple texts just to tell him I was alive and to tease him about dropping the ball. That since he stopped texting me maybe I’d go out and try to rob another store and it’d be all his fault for not entertaining me with YouTube or whatever.”
He’s a bit quieter after that, and follows sedately as Cas makes his way across the store. It’s a few minutes later when he hears Cas say his name. He looks up and drops the Hawkeye toy he definitely was not messing with to see Cas clasping the ugliest looking stuffed animal Dean has ever seen. “I found it,” Cas announces proudly, holding the thing up.
Does he think that Sam will judge him for this or something? They’ve had a lifetime to build these kinds of habits, and it’s going to take longer than just one long day to break them. And, well. It’s

you to, and yet here we are, wasting our time on a friggin’ field trip to Heaven. You told me that if I went off the rails again that you’d--”
He wants to deny it. He wants to stand firm, laugh straight in the Devil's face and believe that Cas had been tricked, been robbed of his consent. But even as he feels the nausea rise, he knows it'd be a lie. "No. He knows he's important. That he's family," he says, but it's feeble, ringing false even in his own ears.
“His name is Ramiel.” Cas had shed his overcoat and was now seated across from Sam at one of the tables in the library. Dean wasn’t sure if it was the way the sleeves of his shirt were rolled up to expose his forearms, or the way he was slouching, or the dark circles under his eyes, or the general air of defeat around him, but Cas seemed almost broken, and too close to human for comfort. “He was one of the first angels to interact with humanity. If rumor is to be believed, he knew Abel personally. If there’s anyone who would know more about the Mark of Cain, it would be him.”
“Aaron Birch,” Cas said, still clutching his cup. He hadn’t taken a single sip of his coffee, though he’d brought it up to his lips and simply inhaled a few times. “I remember.”
“Alright. See you in six or so hours.” He tossed the phone to the side, spared another glance Cas’s way, and then fixed his eyes forward on the dark expanse of road before them. He grit his teeth, rolled his shoulders back, and hit the gas, heading steadily onwards.
Dean wishes he could be irritated with how genuinely taken aback Cas is, but the worst part is he can’t really blame him. “Yeah,” he says, and scrubs a hand down his face.  “Look, you just… I’m still not used to you being, y’know, breakable. So when you pull stupid shit like that -- and I’m not saying that it wasn’t necessary,” he adds, seeing how Cas’s face immediately shuts down. “Hell, maybe it was. But it just… it freaks me out, man. So, yeah, I was kind of a dick. Sorry.”
Dean just sat and looked for a minute. It was the first time he’d really got the chance to look Cas over since this all began. His skin was wan and waxy, dark circles smudged like bruises under eyes that were surrounded by far more lines than Dean remembered. Damnit. He swallowed hard, trying to ignore the hollow knot that lurked beneath his breastbone, and then tore his eyes away. The moment he pulled onto the road, he grabbed his cell and hit speed dial.
