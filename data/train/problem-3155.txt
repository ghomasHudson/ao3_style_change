“You mean it’s your fault that he’s human?” Sam frowns. “That’s not your fault, Dean.”
Sam blinks blearily up at his brother’s face as it fades into focus. “I feel— I think I feel… good?”
“You can’t lie to me, Cas,” he says, voice quiet, carrying only as far as the man to his left. “You been off since yesterday. Something happen?”
“Probably ‘cause I can feel you starin’ at it.” Dean haphazardly rubs the sleep out of his eyes with the back of his knuckles. He groans into his pillow as he thinks about dragging himself out of bed. He finally does, lazily trailing a towel from his duffel over to the bathroom and locking himself in without a further word.
“You gunna execute us then?” Dean asks, bored by their mockery. It hardly registers after a lifetime of every jibe you could possibly imagine.
“You don’t know that.”
‘Parents’. God. Being called old
is a lot less pressing than what the hell they thought of them
Before Dean can close his eyes, prepare himself for what comes next, the word turns dark of its own accord, and Dean is floating through the abyss.
Noticing her surprise, Cas comments, “I believe the heavy warding may have slowed the rate of decay. The wards don’t keep out critters, but they certainly deter them to a certain degree.”
“It’s bad, Dean. The demons are advancing on the citadel and the angels are gearing up for an all out war.”
“Angelic grace,” Castiel says. “Mine. It’s not much, but it’s potent. It should be enough to heal your brother.”
“He was so good with his kid too. The way he smiled at that kid, it was like he felt just so lucky to have him. Every five seconds he was squeezing him, or ruffling his hair, or kissing him on his little forehead.
“The third charge, please.”
” Castiel stresses. God how Castiel
“You can quit, Dean,” Cas reminds him, dropping into Alex’s desk chair.
“What about you?” Bobby directs his question at Castiel, who’s still painting on the kitchen window. Castiel lowers the brush to face Bobby, feeling the weight of the man’s gaze on him like no human he’s ever met. “You’re the one who dragged the boys into this mess. You got anything to add? Any angelic wisdom?”
When Cas returns to 2021, ‘older Dean’ is just Dean again; there’s no remnant of his past lurking around anymore, and normalcy is restored. The four of them make the most of the free evening and share a dinner together followed by a few beers. The atmosphere is casual, but there’s a certain stiffness in the air after the whole ordeal.
“Dean that’s ridiculous, we already touch.” Cas protests.
“Of course I’ll wash it,” Cas says, pulling out a plain greyish-blue shirt.
“Shut up, I’m smelled food and now I am.”
“And you didn’t…” Dean raises one eyebrow.
“Oh, I see.”
The sun was long past the horizon, the high street illuminated by the yellow-amber glow of the street-lights and the dim coloured lights spilling out from the bars. The spring air was cool and still, the whoops and hollers of the rowdy Friday night crowds echoed through the centre of town.
Dean had largely relented on the tea front, though he still scoffed when Cas had the audacity to order it in public.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean can see the guy move on without a word. Cas doesn’t seem particularly bothered, but then Cas never has particularly cared about upsetting the sensibilities of the random humans he encounters. Dean wonders though, if the souped-up God-powered Cas would have totally smited that guy. He likes to think he would have.
“Anyway, sorry if I was a little confrontational with you yesterday- hey kid, you wanna slow down,” the older Dean says softly yet sternly as he turns his attention to Jack, who’s drinking milk directly out of the bowl with loud, eager slurps.
As Castiel sets Dean down, he drifts, unaware, towards the tree. It is at glance just an ordinary oak, but there’s something about it that draws Dean in. He places a hand to it’s firm trunk and feels a spark spread through him from the point of contact.
“Of course,” Cas pouts and gives one decisive nod. “Although it would appear Sam is here now.”
Dean pockets the feather in his satchel then plops onto the cool grass. “Sit. I brought lunch with me. I know you don’t eat, but I brought some berries ‘cause I noticed you seemed to like them.”
Sam sits frozen in place, brows furrowed and lips slightly parted as though poised for words that never come. “You went to the angels for help? You?” Sam pauses. His tone is more of surprise than disappointment. “What did they say?”
“Why’d he do that? You didn’t sell him your soul did you? I’m guessing it don’t work like that for angels.”
“No. Well, yes, a little. It was when you pulled your hand away. I never know with you Dean, how close you want me,” Cas says, frustration evident in his voice. “When we’re alone you don’t have a problem with me touching you or being near you, but as soon as someone can see it, you shove me away. You’ll be resting your head on my shoulder one minute, then Sam walks in the room and you’re three feet away. It’s confusing, Dean. It’s
“Any humans?”
“The beef juices make it even better.” Dean pauses before his next bite, a devilish grin spreading across his face. “Cas, you’re missing out too, here.” He dips a finger into his burger to get a drop of relish, then holds it in front of Cas, waiting for him to make his move. “Try it,” Dean goads.
And with fingers poised to grip his blade, to strike fast and true, to deliver righteous justice, Castiel hesitated. He had looked into his assailant’s eyes— green as the summer foliage and equally full of life and fire. He had seen this audacious man who had stood against him; an angel; equipped with only a primitive hunting knife, and felt oddly charmed.
“You alright there?” Sam asks, his head dipped a little to the side as he watches Cas cautiously, worried that he’s crashed and trying to interpret the error message.
Lunch is stilted and awkward. Victor tries, bless him, but there’s just no way he alone can temper the prickly atmosphere. In a flush of guilt, Cas attempts to steady himself and make his best effort after lunch. He starts with Jo, taking a moment with her as she, seemingly compulsively, sharpens her extensive collection of knives.
“Yes.”
deserve.”
“How the tables turn, huh?” Sam whispers to Dean with a nudge. He darts back towards the shelves of books and starts running his fingers along the spines as he scans the rows of titles. He seems so friendly, so warm.

“Ouch, alright, don’t sugarcoat it, Cas.”
Sam looks unimpressed. “Dean, come on, I know you.”
“Who the hell are you?” the young man slurs, voice lazy and hopeless.
The trees behind Bobby’s house make for substandard practice dummies, but they’ll do. Apparently Castiel still packs quite the punch, as he accidentally snaps a thick branch right off. Upon this discovery, he shifts to a less destructive activity; knife throwing. The trees make excellent static targets.
“I can see you there,” Castiel says, flat, spying the human-shaped shadow cutting through the beams of sunset filtering through the leaves. The shadow stills. With a heavy sigh, Castiel moves again towards the forest with speed and drags the figure out into the light of day. “I told you not to come back here.”
“Yeah, I know they do.”
“Why would he give this to you?” Sam asks, brows furrowed in concern.
Dean’s wringing his hands in his lap. He looks up and smiles at Castiel, but Castiel only frowns in response. “That’s a very long timeline for a demonic blight. I’ve never heard of any lasting for more than three or four years from the onset of symptoms, and approximately six to seven years from the initial contact in total. Even without knowing the date of contact, your brother survived for
Dean leaned back, his hand pressed into the floor behind him for support while Cas rummaged in the box with his back to his husband, grabbing two items.
Dean shrugged. “What? It’s my house.”
Cas doesn’t want the other bed. He gives another bullshit excuse about not sleeping much. As pissed as Dean feels at the guy for the shady shit he pulled in Hastings, he really can’t stand to see the way this guy refuses to take care of himself.
will. Dunno about you,” Dean mutters to Cas as he unlocks their door. A single king bed. Awesome.
“Just hold your arm out,” the other Dean orders, not in a bark, but in a cool, steady tone. It’s almost reassuring, kind of dad-like in a way.
breathing!”
It’s completely insane when he really thinks about it, to have successfully hit on an angel. To have played tongue hockey with a holy warrior of God. Kissing Castiel had felt divine, but Castiel himself felt so… down-to-earth, like he could see him and touch him and have him if he wanted. Dean dares to think that maybe he could, heaven be damned.
. Lame.”
“Terrible, Garth. People died,” Dean says, flat. “And I need a shower and drink. Or a bang to the head— anything that’s gunna put me to sleep.”
“There are angels patrolling human settlements? That’s—” Castiel contains his surprise. Uriel’s flat delivery evidently did not convey the severity of the situation. If the angels are sanctioning patrols of local towns then they either don’t know how large the threat is and are taking extra precautions, or worse, they know
“I thought we were-”
Sam passes a wide-eyed look between the two before slinking away with a murmur about ‘staying out of it and getting some sleep’.
Dean takes a small step forward, undeterred, holding out a wary hand.
Angelic strength or not, Dean felt compelled to protest. “I can carry the heavy ones too.”
. The message is communicated one way or the other, with Cas busying his hands unbuckling his belt and dropping his slacks.
“Well, hey, we sent me back, no harm, no foul,” Dean says with a stretch and a groan. “If my 13-year-old self shows up tomorrow then maybe we got a bigger problem, but right now? I’m taking the win. And I’m gunna turn in. Cas?”
“The court needs to hear your plea, Castiel,” Naomi presses, her lips spread out thin in a smarmy business smile. Castiel cannot respond. “Either you confirm your plea verbally, or we will assume your silence to indicate an acceptance of guilt.”
He doesn’t know why he’s crying. Except, he does.
They pull up outside a small farmhouse on a quiet country road between the two towns, silent and still aside from the odd owl call or passing fox. The four of them unload and bring their bags into the house.
He’s got a lot to think about. He’s decidedly not going to think about any of it. Not how he keeps getting more and more comfortable with each passing day. How each line crossed sends him reeling at first, then doesn’t seem so daunting once he’s firmly on the other side. How, even without the fear, his heart is still racing and there’s nothing negative left to attribute it to.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Oh, a girl, huh?”
As Cas swipes at the overgrown mess of nettles and thorns, he moves with swift assured swings. But the rest of his demeanour is different. He seems jumpy, antsy, jerking and flinching at every brush of a blade of grass or every gust of wind. He moves at a comfortably swift pace, but there’s a feeling like he’d start running if he could.
“Right. ‘Cause he’s an asshole,” Dean remarks cooly, returning his attention to the literature selection.
Castiel wants to scream.
“This is Jo, and this is—”
Castiel thinks for a second. “I’m not an angel anymore,” he says. “But outside of that, I’m not sure what I am now.”
“Figures,” Sam says.
Dean takes a breath and gives a salty smile. “No, not at all.”
Dean steps towards Cas, who’s feebly attempting to wipe clean his blade with leaves. There are already a few blood-stained leaves discarded at his feet. Dean rounds him and places a hand to his shoulder.
“It was stupid— I was 20 and drunk off my ass, had a disagreement with some guy at the bar— he was acting like an ass and harassing people. He had some things to say about my dad— I wasn’t even disagreeing with him… But then he started talking shit ‘bout Sam. We got into it and the psycho shanked me with a broken bottle. Not my proudest moment, honestly.”
“You know I could show you how to make some more stuff sometime,” Dean sighs as the tension dissolves as if it were never there in the first place. “Better you learn from me than from Sam - gotta learn how to make
The first thing that really strikes him is just how much of his back he can see, how cleanly his vision cuts over his shoulder unobstructed. Then his attention settles on the two large patches of pinkish scar tissue marking his upper back.
“You know what, forget it.” Sam holds a hand up and moves to get back into his book, migraine-inducing tiny, monospace text preferable to dealing with Dean’s various neuroses.
“Then how are you sure we’re in the citadel?”
“Efram said that the angels are looking for the tablet. We have zero leads, if there are any to be had at all, the angels will have them. Besides, if the angels are looking for it, we can’t afford to be even a single step behind.”
Bobby looks Castiel squarely in the eye. “And how do you feel about that, huh?”
brazen as to test the wrath of an angel not once but twice.
“Where the hell are you going?” Sam protests.
Eventually, he reaches the forest’s edge and sees the unmistakable signs of life ahead of him. He limps onwards, an anxiety growing in his gut like a guttural scream in the back of his mind increasing in volume with every step taken.
“But it is something, right?”
He could burn it. That could be cathartic in it’s own way, letting the fire consume it and watching it fade into ash like a ghost. He could throw it out, let it rot on a landfill, let the scavenging rats and birds bear witness for decades as it slowly returns to the earth. Fuck. No. This is something he has to do with his own hands; he needs to scrub it out.
“Garth said we’re working with Cas too,” Jo says.
“No Cas,” Dean says, soft. “You gave me an out behind that diner. I chose to take the bet the first time and I chose to keep going after that. You don’t need to feel bad about that.”
Sam shakes his head. “Hmm, not exactly,” he says, voice croaky and dry. “People were being kinda weird, looking at me funny. You know like when you walk into a room and everyone’s just been talking about you.”
Dean turns round, his eyes meeting the source of the yell’s own eyes dead level, not a millimetre in it. The face Dean finds himself staring down is familiar. The man’s eyes are a little wearier, his face a little weathered by time and struggle, but the face is undoubtedly, unmistakably his own.
It’s still as grand as he remembers; a lot of white and gold, pristine and pearlescent shine. It’s horrible, actually, Castiel decides. The only foliage here is tame and unblemished, untempered by wind and rain and rot, only growing where the angels have allowed it, in neat lines in pots and ordered curves around pillars.
“He’s from 2005. I’m taking him to the bunker tomorrow. Sam’s coming.”
Dean pops the cap and stares at the open bottle for a long while, contemplating. Glass or just neck it from bottle? He opts for a glass, because he’s still a cut above Crazy Jim (for now). He pours out a healthy four fingers and raises the glass to his lips when there’s a crash out back.
They eventually set themselves up in their cabin, Jo cross-legged on her bed and Dean sat opposite at the end of his own.
“Dean,” Castiel places a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean jerks it off.
“What do you mean?” Dean asks.
“We were gunna head in about a half hour. Drink up, get dressed and let’s head.”
As the two leave the diner Cas makes it very clear that they’re
Dean just gives a dumb smile, inhaling deeply before letting out a motorboat sigh. “Yeah,” he nods. “I, uh- well this isn’t what I expected,” he finally admits.
It’s the afternoon when they’re finally ready to head out of the camp. Dean and Jo are already waiting in the back of the crappy little cart they’ve got for transport. It’s hardly the height of comfort, but it’s practical and affordable for what is essentially a backwater militia. Cas goes up front with Victor, not particularly fond of the idea of making small talk with fake-Dean and the girl. Victor at the very least has an appreciation for a comfortable silence.
Dean feels his chest swell. “And he doesn’t know me, or you, and he put his ass on the line to help us anyway.” Dean huffs out a short breath. “Sam, we’ve run out of options. You prayed every night for a miracle and Cas— Castiel just gave us one. This thing is gunna kill you, man. You gotta let me help you, you gotta let me try. What else—” Dean’s voice breaks. “What do we have to lose?”
“No.” Jack asserted confidently before bursting into giggles and burying his face in Dean’s shoulder to stifle his laughter.
As Dean is slowly wrenched back to reality, he cycles back a step - “Wait. Do you really think my shirts are crappy?”
“Hey, you know I don’t need a pity party. It’s fine, I’m just saying it would have been nice. That’s all.”
“Did you like it?”
“Is that just what you say to make yourself feel better?” Dean presses.
“Stop being a jerk then, jerk!” Sam snips back. “We talked about loads of stuff, like how fucking awful this place is, how we wanna do more with our lives— you know,
“Oh my gosh,” Yulia gasped, more excited than this particular revelation really called for. “I think coffee shop guy did say he was a mechanic at one point.”
“We don’t have any relatives and we’re all out of friends,” Dean says, the grim reality of their limited options clouding over them. “Where the hell do you even go to hide from angels?”
Dean’s face dropped into a grimace. “No,” he said. “Don’t touch that.”
“Yeah, uh,” Dean clears his throat, and tries to push the words out through his dry mouth. “Me and- me and Cas- Cas and I are… romantically entangled.” Dean winces at his own clunky wording.
“I know. Eurgh. Now I get it with you, and that’s a whole different kind of weird,” Dean adds with a small grimace.
The wound is small, the beads of blood seeping from it are bright. Castiel presses his fingertip to his lips and sucks on it for a moment, stopping to drip-slow flow of blood. The pain fades somewhat, and when Castiel takes his finger back, all that remains is a slit in the skin, a clean cut through the swirling pattern of his fingerprint.
“So do I,” Cas says, planting a kiss on the top of Dean’s head. “You should go to sleep.”
He looks at his phone and sees it’s 6:00 a.m. The jet lag is messing with his sleep. He gets upstairs and turns on the coffee machine. It’s rather surprising when he hears soft footsteps while he sips his first of many cups of coffee. Hannah wraps her arms around him from behind and rests her chin on his shoulder.
“Careful, I’ll learn,” Dean spits out, barely containing a chuckle, “But you may break a nail just from looking at a wrench.”
“I’d never- …, you know, with him if I knew he’s not single.” Cindy’s blushing and gives an apologetic look.
“When is your flight?” He startles a little when he hears Hannah at the doorstep.
“Thank you, man,” he slurs a little the words, clutching Cas’ shirt. “I…- uh, you’re great.”
“It’s not for work actually, it’s a personal project.”
“He’s lucky to have you though,” Cindy smiles a little. As Cas is pushing Dean into the passenger seat, she adds nervously. “If I knew, I’d never do it.”
Generally Dean can defend himself well enough. He is good at ducking. Avoiding flying objects. Getting himself out of harm’s way. Those skills have helped him survive some fights against opponents with significant physical advantage. Those are the skills he thought he’d need tonight. Ditching dinner organised by his girlfriend for her uptight yoga friends was not a smart move. But that New Age-y crowd really isn’t his scene and he could not resist a bit of temptation. Therefore he expected a scandal. Expected yelling. Things to be thrown. This, right here, is not what he expected.
“She does,” he stares at Dean’s profile then adds “It will probably just be a couple of weeks.”
“My pleasure,” Charlie stands and drops the rag on top of his head as she’s walking away, “Laters, bitches!”
Dean and Lisa have done this so many times, for different reasons. For the last decade they’ve been together on and off again. There always was something stopping them to go all the way in one direction or the other. Dean’s inability to stay monogamous. Lisa’s troubles with her ex. Dean’s affection for Ben. Lisa’s horrible ways with money. Dean’s emotional unavailability. Pick your choice. So the pendulum is once more swinging in favor of a break up.
“Castiel, my boy, long time no see,” he says with a smile, that is further away from warm than an ice cube.
“Hope he’ll be ok,” Dean opens two beers as they sit directly on the grass before their creation. “It’s coming on nicely,” he notes content and hands Cas one.
Castiel doubts Hannah knows what his brother is actually up to most of the time, otherwise she wouldn’t be as benevolent to him. Gabriel is the black sheep of the family much to their mother’s chagrin but since he stopped attending church a couple of years ago, she barely speaks to him. Once or twice Hannah has mentioned wanting to get him back in God’s flock. Castiel doesn’t tell her Gabriel was never part of the flock in the first place.
“No, my car.”
“Castiel, how gracious of you to join us,” Barth greets loudly. Castiel is sure it’s meant for everyone to hear the well hidden reproach. He refuses to look away from Bartholomew’s face. After a moment the host turns to Hannah, “and your beautiful wife! I have to tell you the flock takes good care of her while you’re away.”
“Where am I?” Dean croaks, rubbing his hand down his face.
“Actually no,” he says, straining to control the nervous twitch in his hand, “I have some work to do.”
“Oh, screw that. I have a friend in the woodworking business. We can go today and pick the wood, have it delivered tomorrow. We can start by removing the rest of the fence, it’s broken anyway,” the
“I was a fool” Hanah mumbles, barely audible.
“Fine,” Dean groans.
“To what do I owe the honor?” Dean asks.
“Gabriel, that’s absurd!” Castiel cuts him. Naomi Novak may not be the tenderest and most loving mother but implying favoritism is too much.
It’s just in time since Dean barely manages to open the door and stumble out, falling to his knees before throwing up what seems like a gallon of liquor and bile on the side of the road. Castiel sighs, gets out of the car and goes to him. He crouches down and without any real reason, forgetting to be mad, starts rubbing soothing circles on Dean’s back. He hates seeing Dean like this, all stripped of his dignity and his usual upbeat personality. Cas knows his coping mechanisms enough to know something must’ve happened. Last time Dean drank himself like that he had had a fight with Sam, they didn’t speak for a while and it really took a toll on Dean.
“Then you didn’t really know my dad,” Dean says, jaw tight. “All due respect, but he’s my brother and yeah, he
“Yeah, you’d better,” Bobby agrees.

(See the end of the chapter for
There’s a laboured sigh from Sam which prompts a huff from Dean as he braces himself for the oncoming—
“No, dude, really I-” Dean stops as a thought pops into his head, an important realisation. “Hold on, this changes things. You can’t play ‘gay chicken’ if you’re gay, that’s cheating!”
“Are you sure you want to tell me?” Dean challenges. Cas’ jaw visibly tenses. It’s the smallest of signs, but it’s all the confirmation Dean needs to know that he’s heading in the right direction. So Dean removes his hand’s from Castiel’s and instead places them on his waist, gently pulling him a little closer til they’re almost groin to groin.
“Why are you standing so far away?” Dean remarks as he attempts to fluff a crappy old cushion. Castiel shuffles into the room, resting a hand on the back of the armchair adjacent to the couch.
“Doesn’t matter, I still think I have a shot.” Tia shrugged. “What ‘bout you, Sara? You got your eye on anybody? Some nerdy glasses guy who reads Jane Austen or whatever it is you’re into.”
A wall of brick in pristine ivory, catching the light in it’s textured divots with a pearlescent shine, stretches high into the sky. The soft glow of the setting sun casts the wall in peach and amber light, the line of demarcation between stone and cloud indiscernible to the human eye.
“Don’t say it like that.” Cas said, frowning in an amused disgust.
“I’m going to stop this war, and wipe as many angels off the face of this Earth as I can in the process.”
“I know that you wanna help us,” Dean says (to the ceiling). “But sacrificing yourself isn’t the way to do that. We’re safer when we’re all together.”
Bobby dips his head to the side and sips at his beer. “Yeah and looks like your neighbours knew it too.”
“I should be able to soothe pain,” Castiel says, pressing a palm flat over Sam’s forehead. There’s a soft golden glow and in a moment, Sam’s face softens in relief.
Cas finally turns his attention back to Dean, frowning. “Didn’t you? Really? You had
“I don’t think it’s true that you don’t change,” Sam says, confident. “If you have free will and a mind of your own, then change is inevitable, right? You experience things, you meet different people, and you’re a different person, or angel, than you were before.”
Dean nods, “Yeah. When- what, uh, what year is it now?”
“Hey, man, mi closet es su closet,” Dean says with a grin, gesturing across the wall of flannel hanging neatly in his wardrobe.
“Should I carry you over the threshold?” Dean joked, leaning over to Cas, face plastered with a grin.
— it turns his stomach, forcing Castiel to withdraw suddenly.
Castiel balks. “I got them killed, I think they’d want me in their place.”
Dean’s older self shuts off the engine, but pauses. “I know the whole ‘giving up hunting’ thing is weird for you,” he begins. “I just- You know, a lot’s changed. Obviously I’m still you, you’re still me, but I- I’ve learned to let myself do things the way I- the way I always wanted to.”
“Yeah, a couple,” Dean says. “Missouri’s got a leaking roof, Mrs. Lewis needs a wheel replaced.”
“No, I- You think I look scarier when I dress in jeans and flannel. It’s- I don’t know.” Cas wears a tired smile as he stumbles around a point.
Dean figured now was the time for a little lie of convenience, undoubtedly the first of many.
With knives and forks crossed over empty plates, Dean finally musters up enough courage to speak.
Dean stands up to take the rose and looks at it, inspecting it like he’s looking for a bug or something. “Do I have to?”
Bobby’s lost everything, too, Castiel supposes. One night when Castiel is, predictably, awake, and Bobby is, also predictably, passed out on the couch, he wanders into the study, a room he’d only ever briefly passed through until now. There are bookshelves chock-full of all sorts of books, from fiction, to science and mathematics, to literary analysis, philosophy and theology. It’s an impressive collection, and Castiel chastises himself for presuming that such a man would not possess anything of the sort.
The impromptu chat is cut short as Cas and Jo enter through the front door, Jo beaming and chatting away happily to Cas as they walk in.
“I got enough for two, you want? There’s coffee too,” Dean offers, busying himself with his cooking.
Eileen hovers there for another moment, smiling at Dean and eyeing him up with a smirk, like she’s picking out stuff to make fun of later. But she doesn’t say anything else before she swivels back round to join Sam dredging through the books.
. He wonders if Cas can hear him, if his need, his plea, constitutes a prayer. His pulse is racing fast and hard enough for him to feel it. He can feel Cas too, hard against his thigh. It’s the opposite of off-putting, only worsening Dean’s desperation for Cas to do something,
Victor’s face drops a little. “Yeah, yeah, I know,” he says. “He’s been, uh, off with you, I think. Don’t tell him I told you this, but he said to me that the guy he lost, the one he loved? He said you look like him, and it reminds him of what he lost. So, just be patient with him. He’ll come around.”
“Yes, we weren’t expecting you this evening, I thought you were working?”
“Murder of an angel, three counts.”
Dean’s face dropped into a weary expression, though really he was always humoured by Cas’s snide remarks.
Cas finishes up taking a long sip, draining half the glass. “I apologise Dean,” he says with a sad smile.
“Before you were a couple?”
It’s taking everything in Dean’s power not to part his lips, not to close his eyes and just feel Cas. His breaths turn long and deep and slow, such that it almost makes him feel like he’s no longer breathing at all.
Jo raises her eyes to Dean and passes him a pitying, if judgemental,  look. “No, he said we have some time while they settle in. I also asked Garth if he had any headache tonic. He did. It’s on the floor to your right.”
“I’m not— Why would you think I’m a test?” Dean asks, brows knitted together in confusion and worry, likely for Castiel’s sanity as he loses composure.
“Hmm,” Cas hums. He places a hand on Dean’s shoulder, pushing him onto his back. Cas leans over him, tracing a hand down Dean’s side, Dean bristling at the gentle touch as they send tiny sparks through his skin. “I think you overestimate your allure. I can go pretty far, can
“What? Guys can cook!”
Castiel takes a moment to catch his breath, which he’d been holding apparently, before he follows on.
“Dean,” Cas finishes, standing up from his seat, machete abandoned on the table.
“Like hell it is, Cas. We’re not abandoning you,” Dean stresses. He looks to Sam for backup. “Right?”
“Cas, you gunna go with him?” Sam asks, seeing Cas stood there like a lemming.
Dean dragged himself up off the floor and sauntered over to Cas, wrapping his arms around him, kissing him with an almost desperate pressure, nearly knocking Cas off his balance before Cas brought his free hand onto the back of Dean’s neck, pulling him closer still.
“Will you shut up?” Dean snaps, seemingly more pissy that he usually would be if it were simply a case of sleep deprivation. There’s definitely something else weighing on Dean. More than that, it’s two things pushing on him, squeezing his brain from two opposing sides.
Castiel shuffles his feet, head downturned. “I don’t know…” he says. It’s only half a lie; he couldn’t say for sure— it’s not like there’s a procedure for this. But he suspects that at the very least they’d want the man who managed to turn the head of an angel, want Dean.
“Cas,” he says, taking his hands. “Listen, there’s something I need to say.”
“What?” he snaps.
Dean knows he should probably stop looking. It’s not good for him. But then he closes his eyes and sees those blue eyes, and he keeps on looking. So he makes himself another cup of coffee and settles in for another night of reading old books until he passes out from exhaustion.
The kid smiles and holds up his hand. “Hello, Dean.”
been through, it feels like he’s finally found that one thing making it all worth it.
Dean swallows down all the doubt and fear. “I love you, too. I’ve loved you for ages, but it took you saying it for me to realise it and I’m so sorry for that. I’m sorry I was too stupid to see what we could have been for years.”
“I—” he starts, “I can’t. It’s too much—I—
It’s not like he hasn’t tried. All those sleepless nights were spent in the bunker’s library, going through books and trying to find a way to get into the Empty. He didn’t find anything, not even a spell that can get him in, but not out. Usually those are easier to find. And Dean would be lying if he said he wouldn’t use that spell. At this point, an eternity in super-hell with Cas sounds better than a lifetime on earth without him. God, Dean is glad Sam can’t hear his thoughts. He’d smack him across the head for even thinking about that. But there’s no use in denying it. Especially since Dean has evolved to making note of any spell, or ritual, or whatever that could potentially turn him into an angel or a demon. You know, anything that goes to the Empty after dying. He knows Jack could probably do that for him, but he doesn’t want to get the kid involved. He also doesn’t want to explain to him how he intends to off himself the moment Jack turns him into an angel. It doesn’t matter too much, though. That search has only brought up one ritual and several of the ingredients needed are extinct by now.
real. Cas is really here.
All those years, Dean was too blind to see it. Fuck, he’s loved Cas for a decade and it took his angel sacrificing himself for him to admit it. Dean would have kept thinking the bond between him and Cas was only platonic for the rest of his life if those three words weren’t on replay in his head.
And everyone knew. Sam knew, Bobby knew, Mary knew. Everyone they ever met saw it. Hell, even the monsters, the demons, the angels. They all knew. Except for him. Everyone knew Castiel was in love with Dean Winchester, except for Dean Winchester.
—I—I’m sorry.”
It’s two months, sixteen days and twelve hours after Castiel’s death when Dean finally breaks. He’s having dinner with his group of friends turned family. Sam, Eileen, Bobby, Charlie, Stevie, Donna, Jody, Alex, Claire, Kaia, they’re all there. And it’s fun, it really is. Dean made burgers and they’re telling jokes and sharing stories and things are fine. But as it gets later, it also gets quieter. And soon, Kaia and Claire are cuddling on a sofa and Stevie’s sleeping on Charlie’s shoulder. It’s hard, to see them so in love, but Dean can handle it. But then Sam and Eileen are giggling and Sam signs ‘I love you’ to her and suddenly Dean’s crying.
. Cas went to the empty,
He wants to go back, wants to go back to the beginning. To the first time Cas chose him over everything he knew. And Dean wants to grip his angel tight, and tell him. Tell him that he loves him.
He can’t even control it, one moment he’s fine and the next he’s bawling his eyes out and drawing everyone’s eyes on him. They’re all worried, he can see it even through the tears. Sam gets up, ready to comfort him but Dean can’t deal with that right now. He stands up abruptly, pushing his chair back.
Cas hugs him back, maybe even tighter. Dean can barely tell. All that’s in his mind is
. Because that’s just what it is, you know? I
He has no idea what the hell Jack’s talking about. How could he have woken anyone up in the Empty? That’s not how things work. But before Dean can say anything else, Jack disappears in a flash of light. And in his place, someone else appears. Someone Dean didn’t think he’d ever see again. But now, he’s staring into blue eyes that look just as confused as he is.
He closes his eyes and everything he sees is Castiel’s face. A tear runs down his face. His legs give out and he falls to his knees, hands balled into fists.
And he runs. He runs to the one place he hasn’t been able to visit even once since that night. The dungeon. The place where—
Sam isn’t in the bunker right now. He never is, these days. When they won, when Jack brought back everyone Chuck has dusted, Eileen came back too. So, of course Sam’s with her most of the time. Those two are perfect for each other, and Dean doesn’t even have to lie when he says he’s happy for his baby brother. Sam deserves to be happy. After all he’s been through, he deserves to be with the woman he loves, deserves to finally have that apple pie life he always wanted. And he’s getting it. They get to decide what happens, now.
Not really having the emotional capability to have much of a reaction, Dean just looks at Jack and waits for him to go on.
“Cas?”
. Four words left unsaid, but no less true for it.
“Yes,” Cas says.
Both brothers freeze at the familiar voice. Dean’s eyes are wide and his mouth drops open.
Right now, all Dean wants to do is get blackout drunk and sleep. He makes a beeline for the kitchen, but Sam stops him before he can make it even halfway across the room. Dean turns around and glares at his brother. There are still tears in his eyes.
A hand grips his. It’s warm, and it feels
“Goodbye, Jack,” Sam says.
, to save him. And Dean didn’t even get the chance to process what Cas confessed just before he did. He didn’t get to tell him he loved him too. That he still loves him.
So this is what being free feels like. Dean never wants to let it go.
back?”
“Well,” Jack says, drawing out the word. “You know I’m all about balance, right? See, that includes being at peace with other cosmic beings.”
Dean takes a shaky breath. “Okay,” he says. “Uh…well…back when Billie was attacking and you…sacrificed yourself? You said something, and I never reacted to it.”
Dean can’t sleep. They won, they defeated
They stare at each other. But the confusion only lasts a few seconds before it gives way to pure joy. Dean chokes back another sob, but a happy one this time, and pulls Cas into a hug. Immediately, Cas winds his arms around Dean’s back and burrows his head into his shoulder.
him and Dean didn’t know. How didn’t he know?
Dean hates the fact that it took him twelve years and Cas dying too many times, and one final time. He hates that, had Cas never confessed his feelings, he’d still be happily pretending he’s straight. There was a time when he cared about things like that. A few years ago, Dean would have punched anyone who even dared to suggest he was anything but straight. Now, he can’t bring himself to care, and he wonders why he ever did. Looking perfectly straight isn’t so great anymore when the love of your life is dead and in a place you can never follow him to.
“Can I kiss you?” Dean whispers.
He slides down to the floor, leaned against a wall in the exact same spot as that day. And he cries and remembers and cries some more. He doesn’t know how long he sits there until he starts talking. Only some of it makes sense. He talks about how he blames himself, about how he hates that even though they won, he still lost. He talks about how much he regrets saying nothing.
“I just stood there,” he chokes out between sobs. “You were confessing your love and I just
They’ve lost so much, and yeah, they’ve won now, defeated the ultimate villain. Defeated god. But Dean can’t forget what they lost. Jack brought back everyone Chuck snapped out of existence, but…well, there’s someone who didn’t die because of Chuck. Someone who sacrificed himself for the world, for
“Not after everything with Michael she won’t.” Gabe chomps on the banana and gives Castiel a pointed look, “Do you realise, little bro, that you’re the only one still playing our mother’s games?”
“You love the church,” Cas says, not feeling as certain as he sounds, “You insisted on staying in Lawrence when we married, remember?”
“Of course not, Mr. Big Engineering degree,” Dean throws him a smirk. “It looks like a very stable frame but it would take some time even if it’s both of us. And with you gone I will go slowly.”
“‘M sorry,” she mumbles against the skin of her knee. “I just got-got-, I panicked.”
The conversation flows as easy as the whiskey, mostly talking about nothing. Castiel almost forgets he’s leaving tomorrow. This moment of companionship and warmth can last forever. Or maybe it feels
“It’s fine,” she mumbles, as she takes the barstool next to him. “Didn’t want to see you early anyways.” She gives him a knowing smile and he tries to smile back. “Anyways, I just have to get to work early. There’s so much to do with the foundation’s latest fundraisers.”
“In the car.” Cas doesn’t feel like small talk.
Dean raises his eyebrows, giving Cas a disturbed look. “That’s nice, Frank.”
Hannah measures him with a long look and gives a tiny shake of her head.
“I guess.” A more firm answer would be more appropriate because that’s how it’s supposed to be, right? “People need to have a companion in life,” he recites from some sermon and it almost doesn’t
“This explains the trenchcoat,” Dean chuckles, tapping playfully Cas’ shoulder.
“The coffee helped too,” Dean clears his throat and a soft smile curls Cas’ lips.
“You haven’t told me.”
big glass of water. He forces himself to drink one too. When he comes back to the bedroom Dean looks asleep, across the bed, on the covers, lips slightly parted. Cas decided that moving him in a half decent position is the good Christian thing to do. It’s a struggle to move him even a few inches since the angle is awkward and Dean is boneless and actually quite heavy. Cas is reaching around his shoulders to move him up a little more when a few inches away from his face a pair of green eyes open.
“Yeah…” Dean furrows his brow in sleepy confusion,  but he has that eerie feeling like he has forgotten the stove on. “Sorry, Hannah. Didn’t mean to..-”
Charlie just stares for a second. “You are such a moron,” she concludes coldly. “The more I know about your dad, the less cool he seems, you know?” There’s some concern on her face at the end. Dean can’t stand it. He chews the inside of his cheek, eyes on the ground, and doesn’t say anything. “I’m giving you a pass here,” Charlie says after a while, “I’m leaving now, so you don’t lose a friend along with your girlfriend.”
“Yeah,” Cas chuckles, “And when you look in her eyes-”
It all happens so quickly, too quickly. The kisses are simply presses of lips, confident and not lingering. Dean pulls away slightly, but remains only a few inches away. “Sorry”, he chuckles, like he’s just told a joke no one else gets. “I’ve got to sleep this off,” he stands and walks towards the bedroom.
“As good as it gets, buddy,” Dean’s voice is thick with the bravado, but the tension is obvious. “Thank God this is the last one,” he exhales sharply, holding the large rafter as Cas puts the last couple of screws.
“You should take it,” Dean looks away and suddenly sounds much less drunk than he did a few minutes ago. “It would  totally be worth it. Sammy is talking my ear off about this course in Seattle…”
Then it dawns on Dean. He has forgotten the party. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.” He fusses around, rushing to get his stuff. “I fucked up so bad.”
“I- My name is Cindy” the girl stumbles with her words, “I-, I-, your friend and I met tonight and-” Her voice is shaking and sharp breaths interrupt her sentences.
“Tomorrow,” Cas says, feeling a ping of guilt, “I meant to tell you but it didn’t come up.”
This is hard for her. Of course, this is hard for her. Castiel pulls himself together, wraps his arm around her and she rests her head on his chest. He kisses her hair, drifting into dark thoughts, as Hannah whimpers quietly from time to time.
“It’s not charity, Dean, it’s an opportunity,” Sam sighs again. He tends to do that a lot lately when they’re talking. “Besides leaving Kansas will do you some good.”
“When are you leaving?” There’s subtle sadness in his voice.
Sunday morning at the Church is as pure and enlightening as religious revelations go. This is the most busy sermon of the week, full of people so everything goes by the book. Sunday gathering at the Church is where the basics of a good Christian are laid according to Zacchariah. The bright side of this is that the preach is fairly mild, less fire and brimstone, more love for your neighbour. This is something Castiel can really get on board on. Also Sunday is charity work day and a lot of the Church members go helping in the local homeless shelter.
The memories of the previous day slowly emerge, leaving the pleasant sensation of a nice relaxing evening for the first time in a long while. Maybe he’ll call Dean again today. Or maybe not since it’s Friday which means dinner with the church.
Cas lands to the ground with a few well measured maneuvers on the frame. Dean on the other hand carefully climbs off the ladder, “Jesus, Dean! You look like death.”
The living room is a mess, but a familiar one. The stereo is blasting The Doors on full volume and Dean is sitting on the floor, back to the couch, a glass of whiskey in his hand. He seems so immersed in thought and the music is so loud, he doesn’t notice Castiel entering, just hums the guitar solo. Cas isn’t sure how long he stands there staring, smiling, but then Dean starts to sing under his breath the lyrics of the Crystal ship. His voice is rough and quiet, slurring the words a little, sending shivers down Cas’ spine. This song always has that effect on him. He decides to clear his throat before he turns into a puddle on the floor.
“If you go Bible studies on me, I’m punching you,” he cuts him off.
“This is amazing, man,” he says in awe, holding a giant cup of coffee “This is so detailed and it has measurements and everything.”
Dean looks so wrecked and Cas doesn’t have the heart to refuse. So he goes with what he can do. He sits, legs propped on top of the covers. It’s a big bed, enough room for two and Dean is slouching
sound hollow.
“Shut up,” Cas giggles and throws a crumpled napkin at him “I don’t need your mockery.”
Dean takes a silent gulp and hands over the bottle. “I got back together with Lisa,” he says out of nowhere.
“I know,” Cas whispers back, smiling against Dean’s shoulder. “I heard you. I love you too.”
The voice comes from right in front of him. Dean is trembling, lips quivering. He’s scared that it won’t be real when he opens his eyes. He doesn’t think he could take that.
“Dean?”
He stands beside his brother, the one person who’s been there since the start, watching Jack disappear in a flash of light. Dean understands the kid can’t stay, he does. It doesn’t make this any easier. This moment feels like the end of a story and Dean
. And suddenly, Dean’s snapping his eyes open. He’s met with blue eyes and dark hair and that
“No, no,” he says quickly. “It’s a good thing, I promise.”
“Cas,” he breathes out, and pulls him into a tight hug.
), it was the final straw. The one thing that is too much, that hurts too badly, for Dean to cope with. Because Cas
Jack sighs. “The Empty is…unhappy. I said it could sleep, but now it can’t because someone woke up. Now, usually it likes to keep the people in its realm, but wanting to sleep is more important than any deals it made right now. So, it gave me permission to take the one who’s awake. And since you’re the one who woke him up, I thought it would only be fair to leave him with you.”
did it. Dean still has a hard time believing it, even as he watches all the people Jack brought back go about their days. For the first time in their whole lives, they’re more than just puppets in Chuck’s game. They’re finally free.
Cas looked so happy when he said it. Like a burden had been lifted from his shoulders. He must have been hiding it for a long time, probably afraid of Dean rejecting him. Oh, what Dean wouldn’t give for the chance to tell him he doesn’t need to be afraid. If he could have just one more moment with Cas, just enough time to tell him
“Dean?” the voice calls again, only it sounds closer now.
Dean laughs. “Yeah. Yeah, we won. Jack did it, he made Chuck human. We’re free.”
They won. They
“You did.” Cas frowns. “You said ‘Don’t do this’.”
Castiel’s smile wavers a little bit, just for a moment. Dean sees it.
Dean, even though he wants nothing more than to never let him go, pulls away from the hug. “How?”
Sam gasps, gaze frozen on a spot behind Dean. He can hear his own heartbeat going faster and faster. Holding his breath, Dean turns around ever so slowly. Halfway there, he closes his eyes. He’s afraid of what he will see. He’s afraid of what he might
“Dean?”
A sliver of hope starts to grow in Dean’s heart. He pushes it away, afraid of being disappointed and having his heart broken again.
“Jack,” Cas says and smiles. “He came and pulled me out of the empty. I woke up back here. Did we—did we win?”
Cas dying, Cas
It’s strange, now that they have that. Ever since he found out Chuck was behind every decision he’s ever made, everything that ever happened to him, Dean has wanted nothing more than be free. He is free now. And somehow, it’s not everything he ever wanted. Sure, it’s nice to know that there isn’t another apocalypse lingering around the corner. It’s nice to stop being tossed from one battle into the next. It’s nice not to loose even more people. But that’s the thing, isn’t it? He’s already lost too much. Dean has always been able to move on, to keep living, keep hunting, when he lost yet another loved one. That’s different now. Or maybe it’s just Cas that’s different.
The bloody sigil is still on the door. Dean doesn’t think Sam knows it’s there, otherwise he’d probably have washed it off by now. He’s glad he hasn’t. It’s the only thing he has left, that and the jacket with the bloody hand print. That one’s still in Dean’s closet. He doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to wash it.
Dean breaks off, more sobs wrecking through his body.
Dean blinks. “What?”
you. I’ve loved you for ages, and I didn’t understand until you said it and now it’s too late for me to say it. But it’s true. I love you. I love you so much. And I don’t know how to keep going. Being free isn’t worth it without you.”
. Because every time he so much as closes his eyes, he sees dark hair, he sees a familiar trench coat, he sees that damn beautiful smile. And he wrenches his eyes open because that smile hurts more than anything else ever could.
say it. And you died thinking we could never—that I didn’t—”
Dean bites back another sob. “Why are you here?”
“Yeah, but that wasn’t—I was asking you not to sacrifice yourself.” Dean squeezes Cas’ hands. “You told me you loved me. And I was too shocked to respond. I—I couldn’t process it fast enough, and then you were gone and I never got to say it back.”
, got to write their own ending. And Dean still can’t
Dean follows his gaze and stops short. On the table is a yellow post-it note. One Dean is pretty sure wasn’t there when they left. They look at each other and rush over to look at it. Sam moves to pick it up but Dean swats his hand away and leans forward to read it. Sam reads it over his shoulder.
Dean goes to get ready for his ‘date’ at around 6:45, assuming that it’ll only take him 15 minutes to get ready and then he can spend the last 30 thinking of ways to cope with and even best whatever Castiel’s got planned. It should have only taken him 15 minutes, even less considering Cas all but picked out his evening attire for him, but somehow he ends up fretting over shoes, styling and restyling his hair, debating whether or not to shave (does the scruff make him more or less irresistible to gay guys?), and even considering whether or not he should dig out some of his old jewellery for some pizazz.
“Your experience with time travel?”
“Y-yeah,” Dean says meekly, digging his head into the mattress in a feeble attempt to get some space. One of Cas’ hands rests on Dean’s waist while the other goes to caress his cheek.
An itch to protest creeps up Dean’s spine making him shiver. He inhales deeply trying to focus his mind on something other than Castiel’s hand in his, or the implications of his brother’s immediate response. He thinks of all the work he has planned for Baby when they get back to the bunker. He makes a mental list of the parts he needs to order, trying to recall what he’s already got in the garage. “Sure did,” he eeks out. “And now, we are a couple.”
Cas just tuts and slides him a coffee. The older Dean chuckles to himself and takes his coffee over to the breakfast table where he sits beside Jack.
There’s a gentle rap at the door that snaps Cas back into reality. He turns his head but simply stares at the closed door in silence. Eventually the knocker loses patience and pushes the door open, slowly peeking a head round.
“What the hell? No way!”
“Okay, Sam you stay here and babysit baby me.”
Cas’ face is even closer now, the distance between their mouths so minute it’s immeasurable at this point. There’s barely just a ring of blue around Cas’ eyes, and Dean can’t help but wonder if he looks just as fucking helpless. One of them is about to lose this bet, and like this it’ll be pretty much impossible to tell who. Dean can’t bear it, he-
“No. Water sucks.” Dean pauses to burp, which results in more disgust from Sam. “I’m gunna go take all of the ibuprofen.” Dean makes for the door, dragging his slippered feet slowly over the cool kitchen tiles.
“Well duh,” older Dean says, shaking his head with a calm smile. “It’s been a rough few years, you have no idea.”
“So this is your thing now; you and Cas sharing clothes like a couple of sorority sisters?”
“Of course not. If I have an issue, I’ll raise it— you know I don’t take shit lying down. But I’m not gunna start getting pissy because I don’t get to know every confidential detail.” Jo bites her lip. “Or because my cool superior isn’t giving me enough attention,” she adds pointedly.
“Dean, no,” Cas pressed. “It’s just a scrape.”
“Wow,” Dean says, nodding slowly, mouth perched open in awe. “I feel like I’m in an after-school special.”
But there’s a hand over his, ring over ring, as Cas looks the older Dean dead in eyes. “Dean,” he says, his voice kind but stern. “Don’t.”
Cas licks his lips. He supposed he hasn’t been very subtle. With the veritable storm of panic and emotion bubbling and burning under his skin, it might be fortuitous to let some of it out by confiding in someone. “It’s— it’s Dean.”
In a moment, Cas strikes from behind, with one hand over the angel’s mouth, and the other plunging his blade into the angel’s side. Cas wastes no time in shoving the angel into the brush to dim the flash that accompanies an angel’s last gasp of life. Once it’s done, Cas beckons the rest of them over.
“Wow,” Sam says, slow and patronising. “That is amazing. You know I’ve been buying fabric softfener ever since we moved in here, right? You just never use it.”
“And where is ‘safe’?” Dean challenges. “How do even hide from angels?”
Dean nods. “Yeah, worked with him a couple times before he went big shot and moved up to headquarters.”
The woman looks over to the table, then back to Dean, who’s eyes lingering are on Cas too. She then spies the drinks and nods. “Hm,” she huffs. “Yeah, okay. Honestly I thought you might be,” she says, disappointed but not particularly put out. “Thought you were hot enough to be worth a shot though. Ah well.” She pauses, about to take her leave, but before she does, she adds, pensive, “Your boyfriend looks pretty hot too actually. Shame.”
For the first time, Castiel watches Dean leave with a sense of warmth and security. He clutches the book to his chest, his physical insurance that Dean will come back, that he won’t have to face his watch alone anymore.
Dean scoffs. “Huh, could have invited me. My aim needs work, maybe you could give some pointers, Cas.”
Dean sighs. “Not in private either. But you make it really fucking hard.”
Victor’s call draws the man’s attention up. As he lifts his head, Dean gets a glimpse of his bright blue eyes, in stark contrast to the tousled dark hair and scruff of stubble.
“How conscientious of you,” Dean mocks. He shuts up pretty quick when Cas’ arms are wrapping around his waist from behind.
This afternoon is windy. There’s more than a slight breeze slamming against the trees, pushing some of the recently turned leaves off of their branches, littering to floor with an ever-growing carpet of yellows and reds. But then even among the commotion there’s a larger disturbance. Castiel dares to raise his hopes, his lips spreading into a smile, until they are dashed as Castiel catches sight of the almond-coloured feathers the adorn Uriel’s back.
“Okay, let’s do it.” Cas says.
Dean collapses onto the bed as soon as it’s in reach, burying his face in the sheets with a groan. “Hate this,” he grumbles.
They both vanish.
It’s a relief, as it turns out, to be distracted with preparatory work once the team is up and about. There’s not a great deal to do, and a lot of time to do it in, so most of the tension weighing down the air comes from anticipation. Neither Dean nor Jo has ever faced down against an angel before, and it shows. Dean’s nervous ticks are more obvious to Cas; the way he bites his lip until it bleeds, the way his hands can’t seem to stay still, clenching and flexing his fingers, rubbing the back of his neck. Cas doesn’t know Jo, (he doesn’t know Dean either, he has to keep reminding himself), but her nervousness is apparent too. She keeps flicking out the blade of the small butterfly knife she usually keeps stashed in her back pocket.
“Not yet,” the angel replies. He passes a glance to Sam, his face scrunching up in disgust. “What’s wrong with your brother, Winchester?”
have. And something you
Castiel wishes he could take the time to be sentimental. Dean’s the only friend he’s ever had and he’s sure this would be a beautiful moment that he would cherish for the rest of his eternal life if Dean weren’t being so monumentally stupid.
In that moment as Cas had ordered them out, he’d felt something powerful from him, like a divine wrath. If he weren’t so het up he’d probably be impressed. Dean wants to listen in, but god knows if it’s the warding or just a damn good door, because he can’t hear a thing.
“Not exactly,” Cas starts, picking up one of the bones to be used in the spell and fiddling with it in his nervously agitated fingers. “He looks like… someone I knew once.”
Dean stops scanning the array of titles and screws up his face in disbelief. “What? No,” he denies with the utmost contempt. “If anything,
made the lasagne though. Turns out all I needed was a real kitchen; I’m a pretty decent cook.”
“He’s sick, he’s dying. It’s a demonic blight, deep, and it’s really advanced. I’ve tried everything—doctors, faith healers, witches, hell even some whacko calling himself a shaman, asshole tried to fleece me. The only thing that can save him is magic derived from angelic grace. The citadel’s my only shot, and I can’t give up on my brother— I’d rather die trying.”
Dean climbs up his ladder once it’s stable enough and away from the reach of the passers by.  He may not be as prone to panic and paranoia as the average sheltered resident, but he would be lying if he said he weren’t a little unsettled at the presence of angels in town. It’s unprecedented, really, and god knows it can only be a bad sign, especially if they’re not there for him, meaning they’re looking out for something far worse than an audacious human with a weakness for blue eyes.
Castiel follows Dean’s movement, then follows through even further, straddling Dean’s lap to get in even closer. Dean’s hands work their way into Castiel’s hair and there’s an exchange of tongues as the kiss deepens. Dean is overcome with warmth as Castiel’s wings spread around them, enveloping the two of them like a shield from both their worlds.
“What? ‘Cause you’re not-” older Dean huffs as he returns to the table after placing the dirty plates in the sink.
“Well, he’s point on this. And second in command I heard is gunna be Cas.”
“What’s his problem?” Dean mutters to Cas. The guy’s burly-looking, dressed in an old beat-up leather jacket and jeans. He might have a lovely smile, but he looks as if he hasn’t worn it in an age and his face has permanently morphed into an expression of misery and rage. He looks kind of like John, Dean thinks. It’s in the eyes.
“Like what?” Cas asks, voice gentle.
“Don’t start.” Dean waves a hand in dismissal before Sam gets the chance. Not that it deters him any.
“No, c’mon Dean, I have to.” Sam’s eyes are watery and his voice fractured. “You’ve done so much for me, more than dad ever did. Even when we were kids, and you’d— you thought I didn’t know, but I figured out that you would go hungry so that I could eat. You fought and stole and conned and let that whole town
Victor follows close behind and says, “Cas,” in an exasperated tone. “Come on, man. You gotta meet our new people.”
“So? You dirtied it, you wash it,” Dean retorts, shaking the water and suds off his hands as he finishes up his own dishes.
Eileen rolls her eyes, smirking. “Sure,” she says, getting up and carrying her plate over to the sink.
“This fine?” Dean prompts, eyebrows raised expectantly.
“You’re still on this?” Dean turns to face him, expression tense as he holds just barely back his frustration. “The Men of Letters can help you too. And you know, you could probably help them a hell of a lot.”
about breaking in.”
“Well,” Dean said, nodding his head slowly in a pre-emptive defeat. “Where do we start?”
Jim exhales and shakes his head. “Yeah, okay Dean, I’ll drop it for now. I just care about you is all.
“Wow,” Eileen exclaims. “Smells amazing.”
They can’t pull into that motel soon enough. As soon as Dean shuts off the engine he swings round to Sam. “Sammy, you go get us our room, I gotta talk to Cas for a second.”
The two lie there, breathing deeply through the come down, sharing each other’s warmth. Cas rolls over onto his back beside Dean, having fared better than Dean in terms off mess. “There’s a washcloth,” Dean says, words lazy and contented. “There.” His arms flops down and points. “Could you pass it?”
Castiel feels his chest tighten and his lips spread into a smile that he can’t quite hold back. “Okay, I’d like that.”
“Dude, it’s like 3pm. Get. Up.”
“Right,” Dean says, throwing Jo a look that says,
Dean pauses for a second. “Well, yeah. I mean, it’s- I’m not saying it’s weird for two guys to be… y’know. I’m saying it would be weird for you and me. Specifically.”
“Well at least I was there; you got one thing right.” Dean said, grinning before planting a kiss on top of the angel’s head.
“He was.”
“How can either of you be okay with this?” Dean snaps. “Because he’s not human, is that it? Sam, Cas saved your life once and you don’t even wanna return the favour?”
Dean’s face is flat, his lips pouted. “Whatever, shut up.”
Cas rolls his eyes and goes to the sink to get both himself and Jo a glass of water. “Morning drills are important. As is team building.”
Dean gets a hand on Cas’ skin; it’s warm and surprisingly firm. His thoughts are thrown out as Cas dives back into the kiss, pulling Dean in with a hand on the back of his neck. Dean’s hands are on Cas’ hips, his thumbs dipping underneath Cas’ waistband, in his mind begging Cas to
And Cas stands in the centre of the barn, over the bowl of spell ingredients and right in the centre of the holy oil. As the minute turns to 8:15, Victor gives Cas the signal, and he begins the incantation.
Dean sucks in a breath. “Yeah, I don’t know, it’s kinda more than that,” he admits, rolling the beer bottle in his hands, fiddling with its peeling label. “This whole thing’s kinda my fault so I just wanna be helpful, y’know?”
“G’morning,” Dean murmurs as he comes to.
Dean doesn’t respond, focussing on his work. He sees Missouri’s twisted expression out of the corner of his eye before she eventually goes back inside, leaving him to work in a silence scored by the recently woken birds and crickets.
“Dean, I am 32, I have a 10 year old kid, I need someone who’d be there when I need him.”
“Dude, with your math skills and my handiwork, we’re a dream team. Cheers!” Dean knocks their bottles together and takes a big gulp. The way his lips wrap around the neck of the bottle makes Castiel
Behind the rim of his glass Dean spots a curvy blonde throwing looks at him. She’s a young thing in a very short, very revealing dress. To be honest she looks a little out of her place here. Dean would peg her like more of a glam club kind of gal. He gives her a smile and she smiles back then goes back to talking to her friend.
idea but he should use a rational argument.
“Cool.”
“Oh, do tell,” Charlie beams and makes herself comfortable on the hood of the Camaro from yesterday.
Cas sighs from deep in his chest. A lot of diplomatic answers float in his head but none make it out. The annoyance on the other hand bubbles out with a sharp “Would you mind that?”
Hannah’s on the bed in a bathrobe, brushing her hair. Cas tries to force some warmth behind his smile. She’s not the enemy. It’s not her fault Castiel is all wrong and nothing he does fixes it.
“Yeah, I’m picking up Cas from the airport,” he says, digging his foot in the dust.
“Dean wouldn’t mind?” She presses her lips into a thin line, “Besides you’re gone most of the time anyway, so it would be mainly him using it.”
“Is Lisa invasive?”
“We’ll see,” he answers dryly. The Dean pile makes an effort to move and Cas pulls him up roughly by the arm. He’s not really able to stand on his own so he leans almost all his weight on Castiel, draped like a cooked noodle around him, an arm around his shoulder, Cas’ hand on his middle for support, face buried in the crock of Cas’ neck.
“Rowena is not giving me a lot of days off since this year is very important for us,” his brother states dully. His new job probably got him beyond tired. Ambition requires so much effort. That is why Dean prefers not to pursue it. At least one of them should be easy going.
Whatever has been souring his mood seems to be pushed away.
“Sorry about last night.” Castiel finds himself apologizing a lot. It’s one part anxiety and two parts guilt. He just doesn’t know what to say. His wife probably deserves a lot better than a permanently absent husband. So he tries to make it up to her by agreeing to everything she wants. Almost.
“Not horrible for two amateurs,” Cas smiles.
Castiel is so far gone in his thoughts he almost doesn’t join the applause that slowly rises.
“You’re such a hippie,” he smiles, taking another sip.
Cas is about to pull away as he feels a firm kiss on his cheek. Now, that’s weird. Before he has any time to process it, Dean plants another smack at the corner of his mouth and then on his lips. Castiel freezes, his mind short circuiting. His brain simply cannot process what is happening. He can’t even manage to kiss back, he just thinks about how surprisingly soft Dean’s lips are.
“No- it’s my fault” Hannah looks at him with teary eyes, her lip quivering, like she’s just now seeing him. She pulls the sheet tightly around herself. “Can you please just hold me?”
“Dude, no need to explain yourself to me,” Dean says, but smiles nevertheless.
When later that night Castiel stares at the mirror in the bathroom before going to bed. His reflection shows a blank expression of a tired man in his mid thirties with growing bags under his eyes. He does feel tired, like half his life has passed with him being in the wrong place. His heart sinks at the thought about all the people he’s disappointed. What would Hannah say if she knew how much he hated tonight’s gathering? Would his mother be appalled that he resents his wife for how much she enjoyed it? His mind drifts back to Dean. He’s Castiel’s only friend outside the church. His only friend, period. What would he think of their little soiree tonight? What would he think of Castiel after that? What would any of them say if they knew what Castiel does when he’s all alone and far away from home?
He doesn’t know how long he kneels there, but after a while Sam comes and helps him stand up. He leads Dean to the impala and Dean doesn’t even protest when Sam takes the driver’s side. For the whole ride back to the bunker, he just stares out of the window. He sort of zones out, so Sam has to practically drag him inside once they arrive.
. The words unsaid create a regret that, unless dealt with, will spiral into destruction. The words said, even though they were uttered in goodbye, create the opportunity for two brothers to finally write their own story.
Sam stirs as soon as Dean starts moving around in the kitchen. He lifts his weary head and blinks slowly. “Dean?”
“You know nothing of angels,” Castiel says. How could he? How could any human? “But I suspect you know better than to disobey. Leave.”
“Yeah, I never do,” Sam says. Dean shrugs, not caring to protest that blatant lie, and makes his way out.
“It’s fine,” Cas dismisses quickly, avoiding meeting Dean’s gaze still. “I’m sorry if it seemed I— It’s fine.”
Dean takes it in, but is seemingly unmoved. “I just don’t know why we’re still having this conversation. I don’t get why you wouldn’t even want to— to
transparent? As if it weren’t bad enough to have his heart crushed into dust, now he’s gotta talk about it.
“Well have a think on everything, an’ we’ll figure out what the hell to do about you boys in the morning,” Bobby says, getting up with a groan.
“I’m gunna go die now,” Dean grumbles, starting off to his room without making time for pleasantries.
“What happened? To Stanford, I mean. To being normal, and getting out?” Dean asks, pushing his words past the lump in his throat.
“Sam, this is uncharted territory, even for me, but if there is one thing I am sure of, it is that there is nothing that could darken your soul,” Castiel offers, earnest. “Even if whatever this is changes you physically, it cannot change who you are. There is no force on this earth powerful enough to do that, not if you don’t let it.”
“Uh,” older Dean searches for an answer. “Jack, why don’t you go upstairs for a bit, okay?” He places Jack back onto the floor and is met with a childish pout. But Jack obliges and trudges up the stairs.
He’s not gunna think about
“Why? I got nothing to offer, man.” Dean’s tone is sharp, almost accusatory. “I’m pretty sure you don’t actually want to be a hunter, you got your own clothes and everything now. You got no reason to stay.”
“Yeah, two whole hours ago,” Dean scoffs nervously. He swallows down his desperation to
. He wants so desperately more than he’s ever wanted before. More than he’s ever wanted to serve, which is his only true purpose in this world. Ever since Dean he’s dreamed— an
Dean returns home late as always. By now, Sam’s given up on waiting up for Dean, and (almost) given up hounding him for his misguided evening activities. Instead, Dean finds him sleeping, his breaths uncomfortably shallow.
“I’m going to find Azrael and ask him what happened to Cas.”
Castiel frowns, a hand poised over the hilt of his blade on instinct. Dean’s face is warm and open, the low light glittering off his cheek, his face bathed in a golden glow illuminating the smattering of freckles gracing his cheeks. Castiel’s hand lowers.
“I… yes I’ve heard,” Castiel lies, keeping his face steady in his surprise. Castiel is unsure how he could have missed such reports, though he hasn’t exactly been attentive as of late.
- I know you’re human now, but I don’t really see a difference - and you’re here wasting your life hanging around me. And what have I ever given you but hand-me-down flannel and crap?”
“Bull,” Jim scoffs. “There’s no girl in the world who’d get you to leave your sick brother alone of an evening.”
“Yeah,
Cas squints. “You haven’t beaten me yet. In fact, if we’re keeping score, you’ve barely been able to affect me at all.”
Along the back wall there is a high judiciary bench, populated by a council of angels adorned in ceremonial robes. Either side of the aisle through which Castiel is dragged is an audience of his peers.
“Out,” Cas repeats in a harsher tone. “I’ll speak to the angel alone.”
“Maybe, if they were desperate enough,” Dean says. “I mean, I don’t think most of the folks in this town would.”
Jo passes a glance up at Dean. “Uh, the angel? Yeah I saw. Pretty messy.”
“What reason? ‘Cause these backwater fucks said so? I didn’t make any fucking
“Not sure ‘calm’ is the word I’d use,” Bobby says with a raises eyebrow. Castiel shrugs. “That’s a pretty vicious aim you got there.”
“If he hurt himself bad, you’d heal him though, right?”
Cas returns with a dozen eggs after about ten minutes, giving Jody what she needs to put some breakfast on. Dean stops her though. “Hey, you did dinner, I’ll do breakfast.”
,” he repeats for good measure.
Cas slumps and averts his gaze, ashamed. “Not exactly. The man whose body this was, he- he’s dead. It’s just me in here. And this body’s been completely deconstructed and reassembled a number of times. I wonder if it’s even truly still his.”
“So you were injured in a battle, huh? You weren’t kidding about being a soldier.” Dean likes to imagine it, Castiel fighting off the demon horde. It doesn’t seem so strange after seeing his great wings and feeling his strength firsthand.
Jo’s eyes wander around the old kitchen. “This place looks like it’s been abandoned for a couple
that it would be weird, even if he can’t explain it. Maybe it’s because Cas is an angel that he just doesn’t
“Of course,” Castiel confirms with a nod. “What brings you?”
Dean sighs. “Yeah.”
Dean pauses, he frowns as he goes insular, thinking and digging through his mind. “Yeah,” he finally says. “I think my dad probably- he always used to… I don’t know, he’d say stuff.”
“Care to share with the class?” Dean asks.
Dean’s face twists into outrage. “You people don’t answer,” he spits, an accusatory finger pointed at Castiel. “Sam’s
Cas is standing in front of Dean as he comes to. He can’t remember falling asleep, and he can barely remember whatever he was thinking about when he did. A glance to his left tells him that Sam and Eileen are gone.
“Okay, you’re right,” Dean conceded, biting his tongue on whatever stubborn argument he wanted to make. “I just hate to see him suffer.”
There’s little to wash up as Dean’s very much a ‘clean-as-you-cook’ kind of guy. It’s pretty much just plates and cutlery, so he makes a start while Sam and Eileen clear out. Cas sticks around, though not to help. While Dean’s hands are suds’ed up and his focus is set on the scrubbing every last spot of dirt from those plates, he’s the unwitting recipient of one firm smack on the behind.
“Yes, Dean
The man furrows his brow. “Have you ever killed someone before?”
Dean is practically frozen solid. A tad more solid that he’d like in some places, which he’s trying very hard to ignore. “O-Okay then.”
The days following the vamp hunt are relatively chilled. There’s no world-ending threat to research in the down-time between cases, so the Winchesters’ and Castiel spend most of their time reading, watching movies, and doing chores. It’s the remarkably ordinary interlude in an extraordinary life.
“So…” Dean starts in an attempt at normal, polite conversation. “He yours?” he gestures between his older self and Cas.
Sam’s eyes widen. “You mean I’m— I’ve been purified? Completely?”
“Weird if you and Cas were an item?” Jody’s face scrunches up. “How would that be weird?”
“Hmm.” Cas squints. “I suppose it is.”
“When Jo and I were in town we— well she thought it would be nice to use the leftover cash to get something nice for you guys. I don’t really know what kind of stuff you like, but you always go on watch, so I figured you must get bored so…” Dean rubs his neck and takes a a breath as he pulls an old worn book out of his bag.
Carol paused, unable to hide her confusion as the cogs in her brain connected dots in ways her traditionally-wired brain couldn’t comprehend.
“He’s tall- actually not
“You know if I’d known you were moving in today, I’d have made a casserole,” Carol began to ramble. “Do you like casserole? Oh, everybody likes casserole. In the next few days, you’d better expect a casserole.”
“This is… quite the collection,” Cas comments bordering between impressed and terrified.
, he doesn’t say. Cas shrugs and folds it over his arm. “What about at night,” Dean adds, sitting down in his desk chair as Cas continues to browse through his shirts. “You got stuff to wear when you sleep?”
“That’s… An excellent idea,” Castiel says. He turns to Sam, who’s still some distance away from Castiel. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Sam. I’m very glad to see you well.”
Castiel furrows his brow in thought. “I couldn’t say. There aren’t many cases of an advanced demonic blight being cured— angels aren’t typically forthcoming with their miracles as you know. I haven’t heard of it as a side effect, but there isn’t a great deal of recorded data, so it’s impossible to determine what is and isn’t ‘normal’ in a case like this.”
Cas returns to the kitchen, sliding a hand over the older Dean’s lower back as he slips past him so casually to the sink, where he pulls out the plug to let the water drain away. Dean watches them from his front-row seat. He can’t hear them talk, as they do so in hushed tones, but he’s not particularly interested in what they might be saying anyway. Instead, he’s transfixed at how cooly their hands seem to drift around each other. A hand on the waist, the hip, the shoulder. And the glances; the soft, loving looks and the smiles. Their bodies are so close, shoulders brushing together, Cas’ head practically sitting in the crook of Dean’s neck. Dean feels almost like he shouldn’t be watching this. It’s so innocent, yet so
Older Dean takes a sip from his own glass and smiles. “Not so much.”
“And you’d be willing to
Cas sets the two mugs down on the table and sighs. “Dean and I are probably the most qualified people to help get you home you know.”
“I’m not giving up, Dean,” Castiel says, leaning forward, serious. “I have no intention of ‘throwing myself to the wolves’. I will fight, I might be able to find somewhere remote where I can hide out.”
Sam sits up and frowns in shock and confusion.
Cas ignores the taunts and twirls his blade in his hand, staring Efram down with a steely gaze.
The whole situation is rather unfortunate, at least from Cas’ perspective. There are several hours to kill and a whole heap of nervous energy poisoning every second. Despite his reputation for being aloof, Cas actually prides himself on being a kind and attentive commander. Those who have worked with him know that, it’s just that not many people have actually worked with him. In a situation like these, he’d usually be quick to jump in a reassure his teammates. Today he is no state to reassure anybody of anything, since he’s brimming with the same level of anxiety, only for a very different reason.
Castiel can only be thankful, possibly for the first time, for the slow turning wheels of angelic bureaucracy. It’s likely that by now they will have sent over more angels to the Winchester’s home, but shifting troops around and reallocating resources is something that takes time.
“I get it, you’re out of the game,” Dean says quietly. “I bet you probably want nothing to do with me. I must be hard to look at.”
“I don’t know,” Dean says. “Maybe. Probably.”
“Aren’t you gunna say it?” he asks tentatively, as if
The party gazes around the back entranceway as they enter. Cas follows them inside, closing the door behind them. There’s dirt and debris all over the floor and the air is heavy with damp, but the house is still standing.
“Without cause?” Azrael scoffs, haughty. “These humans have been colluding with demons, Castiel. They have earned just retribution.”
His older self lets out a heavy sigh. “Cas told me I should be kinder to myself,” he says. “It’s not the first time he’s told me that, but it’s the first time it’s been so literal.”
What do you mean you ‘don’t care’?”
Sam clears his throat and takes the coffee Dean slides over to him. “No, like I said, we just
